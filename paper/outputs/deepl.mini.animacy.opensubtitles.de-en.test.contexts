I knew you could do it, Xander. You brought the world to us. The world is big, The world is big, But it always fits in your heart. Always carry it with you.
It is safely stored. That wasn't part of the plan. After all these years, you're still shocked when I improvise? No. But the mission was to destroy it.
Move. This looks like trouble. Ready for some fun? Turn off the music! Turn it off!
Phoenix from the ashes. Eighteen hours in the chair in Mexico. I drank my weight in tequila to get through it. That's actually the most important thing. That's when I decided to change the world instead of rebelling against it.
No. I look okay. Why didn't your dad stop you? It's my dad's. He's dead, so I'm wearing it.
Uther, we cannot win this battle. I know Mordred. He would accept submission. Hold the crown! And hold it!
The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon, or his direct descendant. You felt it, didn't you? The power? It's mated you. You just don't know how to use it yet.
Ryll, you're not getting anywhere with this. - He is a mercenary. Unworthy. Don't tell me about my past. I've lived it.
Hey, if the vegetable hat can tell us that Hefty is strong, then maybe he can tell me what an Ine is. Turn it on, Brainy. Fascinating. What happened? Instead of sending out energy, you absorbed it.
What are you doing... Why? I'm really freaking out, you guys! Everybody stop. Okay, get the tunnel survival packs out of your backpacks. Take the tube labeled "Light" and shake it hard.
Simon says that sometimes. He says, "Say yes to life, Veronica." Say yes to life. That was a well-intentioned anti-drug campaign in the '80s. And we've always expanded it.
What do you want from the market? A rose. Like the one in the painting. You wish for it every year. And you bring it with you.
Hi, folks. Hi. Mack, did you see the game yesterday? Since when do i have control of the remote? One day you'll get it back.
Okay, Ray, I'm sorry. You're gonna have to turn in that union card. Come on. Ray, why don't you pick up your stuff another time? We'll keep them.
- The map. Go ahead. Take a look. And guess what... I won't give it to anyone.
Look inside. And guess what? I won't give it to anyone. Only to you. I wrote it for you.
Did you write those? Let me see. I cut myself. Now, where's your card? I don't have it.
Let me see. I cut myself. Now, where's your card? I don't have it. Styvesan told the boss that you have it.
Styvesan told the boss that you have it. He said that you said it was your best card. So, tell us! The woman asks. She read it.
After all, she is my legacy. I have only the very best in mind for her, and she will never hear from her useless, drug-addicted father or her whored mother again. No one is better than the other. After that, I gave them the damn card. They marketed it in a nice way, and that was enough. COMPETITION WINNER "GIRLFRIEND DAY
Trying. Stage fright? Tom? Come on! If I gave you a chance to run, would you take it?
This is from Tolstoy. "The higher a person is on the social ladder, the more people are connected with him. The more power... " War and Peace, Volume Two, Book Nine. My mother is from Eastern Ukraine, I got my Russian from her. In order for her to show me off, I always had to memorize classical literature to recite to other people.
Inside was the water filtration system. Whatever this substance is, it reacts incredibly strongly with water. And the cargo hatch? - That's where the payload was dropped. None of this helps us find them.
See? We're replaceable. They fired Irv. This school wants to fuck me up? Then I'll kick their ass!
Sometimes here, sometimes there. Life is a journey. It is in a bottle, the city of my dreams. You need bite and patience, a little blessing from above and a lot of guts. Then you have nothing to fear. This world is wrong. By doing crooked things, you straighten it out.
Your smile has a paralyzing effect on my tongue. Then I want to... just look at you. Then take me into your world. God willing. When "My World" is finished, you'll be the first to see it.
She told me to relax. - Was it nice in London? - Yes, it went like this. Did someone hide the sun? Did you lose it in the war?
I'm Landsat field supervisor Victor Nieves. This is my colleague, Steve Woodward, our data tamer. (ALL LAUGHTER) Our expedition takes us to a place that has been avoided for centuries on all known maritime trade routes. As our satellites show, the island is surrounded by a permanent storm system that keeps it hidden from the outside world.
There is more out there. What do you mean by "more"? This world never belonged to us. It belonged to them. They're going to take it back. The question is, when?
No, let's go in here. - Did you have another little meeting? - The monthly refresher. Confession is good for the soul. If you can erase it. - What is TD 12?
Anything. Mary left a message. A message? John Watson never accepts help. From anyone. Not ever. But you must know he never refuses it either.
Excuse me, sir? What do you mean? The door is blocked. Did the door jam again? It does that all the time.
- Why not, with the alternative? - And his brother? - Mycroft is fine. So you'll be away for a week? I'm spending it at home.
It is an experiment. You have to be strict about it. Take the gun, Sherlock. It's your turn. If I tell you to use it, - think what can happen.
- For whom? - For you. - How so? Someone else has to die. You want to do this with your hands? You're wasting valuable time. Best you just take it.
See? I was right. No. I've seen this somewhere before. We need to replace it with something.
Spit it out! Come on! Disgusting! The beast's skin is too thick to penetrate from the outside. I have to cut it open from the inside.
All right, Taserface. Say hello to the other guys, Taserface! What about the little plant? Can I crush it?
What about the little plant? Can I crush it? No, Gef. It's too cute to kill. Take it to the tailor.
When I finally found it, it was all so disappointing. And at that moment, I came to a fundamental realization. My innermost desire to find other life was not for the reason of wanting to participate in this life. Peter, I found my purpose. I see it.
Yes, the key is in it. Thank you. Welcome. You wanted to see the world. Here it is.
I had to see it for myself. And? It won't be a problem. We have an agreement. You must honor it exactly, or there will be consequences.
But here it is at last. I hear you crying in your room at night. How you cry for your lost parents. This grief is a weakness. Banish it.
Living as long as I have, you see the world change in many ways. But that change feels significant. The devil of Hell's Kitchen. The man with the unbreakable skin. And now an immortal weapon has left K'un-Lun, not to do his duty, but to hurt her.
I wasn't always homeless. Sure. Sorry. Most people move on. I need information about the factory, the guards, and the woman who runs it, Gao.
You said you had it under control. I thought I did. I, uh... - I lost it. - Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand. If you know how to control it.
All the questionable shit we did for Rand.... That's not true. That's very touching, but time is up. This blade has slain kings, emperors, lords and tyrants. If someone had told me I'd be using it for a businessman...
It has given us so much. This is a chance to give something back. Besides, aren't you curious? So the discoverer of the box is granted three wishes. But we discovered and touched them all at the same time.
From good old Ozzie. The wish box is mine! The wish box belongs to no one. No one should have that power. That's exactly why I should have it.
- You started. Seriously? - Why isn't he vulnerable? - What kind of fist is that? - I deserve it.
- Why is he not vulnerable? - What kind of fist is that? - I deserve it. - What? He deserved it.
- In greater safety than we are. Small mistakes. Personal relationships. They'll use them to take you down. - What about your hand? - I cut it off to free myself.
millennia. Unimportant. But long ago, the elders of K'un-Lun came together to learn to control their chi. The energy of life itself. They wanted to use it for healing.
- Don't worry. He didn't go as Matt. - You gave him the costume? - I didn't open the door. I gave him a chance to close it.
What is that noise? What's going on? Shit. You're wasting your energy. Save it for the bigger fight ahead.
How are you? You, uh... You still thinking about Matt Murdock? He loved this town. He sacrificed himself to protect it.
- Around the twist. - Shit. Really? One time there was one because Allan left his bag at the sports center - and they thought it was a bomb.
- No, thanks. - No need. Take the flashlight with you. But use it right. When you hold it like this, it's not just a flashlight,
Order confirmed. What is it? He has completed the task. The debt is paid. Mark it.
He has completed the task. The debt has been paid. Mark it. If Mr. Wick is not already dead, he soon will be. Would you mark them, sir...
Next stop: Broad Street. Broad Street. End of the southbound C train. The blade is in your aorta. Pull it out, you'll bleed to death.
It's not too late. I mean, you're pretty. The ranch has been in my family for four generations. Stella, a ranch means dirty business. If J.T. couldn't save it, how are you gonna do it all by yourself?
Did you hear about José's exhibition? It was incredible. - It really was. The reviews are full of praise. - I'll take a look at them.
And I sneak through the subway and the underground parking garage. Isn't that where the protection zone is? You can get through the protection zone with special keys. We were able to get one of them in the fight against the clones. You have to take them from the clone commanders who are protecting the area.
Just ice. That's weird. I could swear there was a Russian secret base where they refitted old submarines. From a purely technical standpoint, it's no longer Russian. The base was taken over by a terror militia of military separatists a month ago and the Russians haven't recaptured it yet.
You know them! Doesn't ring a bell. - Did Ginnie leave an address? - Yes, she did. It's on the fridge. Could you get it, please?
- Do you play well? - Your father thought I was good. Before or after he lost his mind? Love is a kind of madness. Is it, Mr. Thoyt? Or have you never known it?
No decent woman would be interested in him. And you would not have to be on your guard. We have the same father. You are a box of seven seals in every respect. Whenever I think it's empty, I hear a tiger roaring inside.
And it burns. - Do you know what's in it? - Yes. The truth. I would burn it.
- Do you know what is in it? - Yes. The truth. I would burn it. Because the river could bring them back.
Then, Mr. Coop... he's a man you can do business with. Have you been sleeping in a nest? We need a carpenter. Yes, in winter the door sticks. If you plane it off, it's loose in the summer.
We are not here to bully, to intimidate. We are not here to shoot first and ask questions later. We must not be guided by fear and mistrust. We are here first and foremost to support the civilian population. And that is why we must not kill them under any circumstances.
You always say what's wrong with people, but you don't do anything about it. All you do is complain. About 100 people protested the White Tower restaurant's preference for whites in Baltimore. The protesters were opposed by advocates of racial segregation. As much as we regret it, integration is here, and I want to do what I can to stop it.
My private blog. Has quite a few clicks lately. Take a look at it. I don't recognize your authority. I don't recognize it.
We are losers who win We win How do you solve a problem like Maria? How do you catch a cloud And nail it down?
He could stop them. The Nazis lost the war. Why is he still so obsessed? What does he want an army for? He doesn't want it for them.
His mom summoned him. To fill the void after the Wild Hunt passed through Canaan. Mom... What if Sheriff Stilinski fills a void? What if he fills it with Claudia?
Okay, hold on a second. So this woman, "Lenore," she conjured up her dead son? She was the only one left behind. She had a void to fill. So she filled it with her son.
Fire. Cremation. These are images that have never been in the video before. Primitive cultures believed the only way to free a soul was to burn the body. If you can find it.
As much as you may dislike looking inward, the thoughts are there, don't fool yourself. Do you believe in the soul? If not, close your eyes. Good. If the soul existed, where in the body would you place it?
Well, it took me a while to figure it out. First I thought of the Norwegian trick. Then I noticed how he sorts. With the first card, he signals the suit. If he puts it to the left, it's spades.
You're not that innocent, Jensen. I don't care what she says. Mr. Foley, let's go. Get to the classroom. You too, Mr. Jensen. So there are different ways to get help when you need it, or a boyfriend or a girlfriend.
No, right? I doubt it. People like you never act selflessly. That's some crazy stuff! "Today I'm wearing black lace underwear just to know I'm wearing it."
What if I don't hold the note? "What if no one hears my tunes?" Does everyone read this stupid paper? I'm a fan. -You don't read it?
She was drunk today. She's fine. She's totally fucked. And so are you. Jessica deserves the truth. But she'll only believe it from your mouth.
What happened to your face? I'll show you. Couldn't it wait till later? Copy the tape. I'll pick it up after the first one.
Bend your knees. You need to keep it down. I heard you a mile away. Okay. And if it happens, if we allow freedom to ring, if we let it ring in every town and every hamlet, in every state and every city, we'll make it sooner to the day when all God's children,
You too, I guess. Tick-tock. Chop-chop. And, Rick...when Daryl shows up here, two days, two months, hell, two years from now, just know that there's no statute of limitations on this. Keep your axe handy. You're gonna need it if he shows up at your place.
In the library are more. Much more. You... You have a library? Your friend Daryl didn't get a chance to see it before he skedaddled.
In case you were wondering. I was out there all day and there wasn't a single one. Not a real one. The thing is, I had a gun. I was going to use it to kill Negan.
And what happens after that? After that, we continue. Yeah, but... Negan ran the world his way. It's up to us to reorder it when he's dead, right?
Morgan. He arranged everything. He blocked the road yesterday so we'd be late. That was all him. And we had the donation for you guys when we left...we had all of them. He took one out of the load and hid it... when we stopped.
Yes, that's right. Pop, remember how he used to read standing up? Yes. He used to come up to me and say, "Cisco, buddy that plant there has root rot, my boy. Take that plant away from there and plant it two beds over if you really care about it."
The risk I took for your needs. Emmit Stussy. Eden Prairie, just around the corner. I wrote it down for you! No, you said... I did what you asked. The address in Eden Valley, I found it, and now...
- Yes. - Sorry. - Let's cut the cake now. He'll be back on the phone in a minute. You're not supposed to... - Is that how you cut it?
Envy... But I don't want that anymore. So... I'll give you the stamp. You're not giving it to me. Yes, I am.
I will. You can't give me something that was mine to begin with. Okay. No, that's... Take it.
Ok. No, that's... Take it. - It's yours. - I said take it. I don't want it.
- His brother. - Maurice's brother? No, the brother of the guy who hired Maurice, Stussy. - Like your stepfather. - Exactly. Gave Maurice an address maybe, he lost it.
- Maurice's brother? No, the brother of the guy who hired Maurice, Stussy. - Like your stepfather. - Exactly. Maybe gave Maurice an address, he lost it. Or forgot it, and then he made the wrong choice.
That is the engine of progress. Of course, technology has other advantages as well. Safety, for example. A safer car, an artificial heart. And a gun today can be equipped with a fingerprint scanner. So that only the rightful owner can use it.
That is, you are guarding my body. Isn't that right? Not if you're robbing a bank. Now my body is going into the bank. He's not robbing it.
I gave you the wrong coin. The one I gave you was my lucky coin. You shouldn't be so careless with a lucky coin. It's a good thing to keep. Tell you what, I'll give you back your lucky coin if you tell me how you plucked it out of the air.
The one I gave you was my lucky coin. You shouldn't be so careless with a lucky coin. It should be kept safe. Tell you what, I'll give you back your lucky coin if you tell me how you plucked it out of the air. I plucked it out of the air. That's how I did it, you bug-eating child molester.
That's a good thing to keep. Tell you what, I'll give you back your lucky coin if you tell me how you plucked it out of the air. I plucked it out of the air. That's how I did it, you bug-eating child molester. Now give me my coin. I threw it away.
Tell you what, I'll give you back your lucky coin if you tell me how you plucked it out of the air. I plucked it out of the air. That's how I did it, you bug-eating child molester. Now give me my coin. I threw it away. Where did you throw it away?
- Officer Myerson. If you ever want to work on the weekend, give us a call. You have my card? Yes, sir. Keep it.
As a plumber, would I have to stop plumbing? As a plumber, you wouldn't be able to post bail. The police called. They still have a box of PJ's things. They want to give it to the family now that he's officially dead.
Did you give Pernell my cell number? No. - He left a message. She's cute. Do you want to hear it?
Wait. We're not the only ones who miss him. I'm not talking about PJ. There's a memorial website. You need to see it.
"The Great Gatsby. A truly beautiful novel. A man who desperately wants to belong is struggling to reinvent his past. Then I should watch it again. Watch the movies. You should have watched this young man's speech before he gave it.
No. And I paid dearly for it. - She stole from PJ and had his wife raped. Just for the damn Bathwater software. Maybe I can find her.
What's up? I sat in the car for an hour trying to talk myself out of it. You were right about PJ's suicide note. There's a message in it. I just don't understand it.
The marriage certificate must be somewhere. As I said, in the monastery. But I wouldn't know where and what to look for. Besides, this place scares me. Could you get it for me?
I am in a good mood. The new uniform looks better on you. And color suits you better than black. The sun always rises in the same place. We have to turn to catch it if we want to go on living.
Why? - Well, this is a Chake amp; Irwin. Were known for their grandfather clocks. This is the only mantel clock they ever made. There aren't many of those left. Did you have it appraised?
There's your security. We'll get the paperwork done, and Troy will be there to mow the lawn in no time. - I don't know. It belonged to Mr. Metzger. - You'll get a receipt. And we'll put it in the safe in the office.
- This is a real lawyer's office. - Is there somewhere we can talk? - I thought about how long it's been since I've heard your voice. - Please. Let me finish. I was thinking about how long it's been since I heard your voice and then I heard it.
- One second, sir. - How did you get this address? - From the e-mail. What e-mail? Who sent it to you?
Which email? Who sent it to you? - One of your people. I don't know how your people work. - I need to see them.
I have meetings all day, all the way up to the warden, and they all want to know how the scumbag we had in custody got back on the street. So what do you want to tell them? Everything, including how you used a recording between me and my informant to get your bomber released. So I need to know... the recording. Where did you get it?
Of course, I had no idea what was happening. I mean the explosion, I still don't believe it. But because Sekou was released because of the recording, it's important evidence in the investigation. I just told the FBI-I wouldn't say where I got it, and I won't, but....
What is the problem? There were some inconsistencies during his interview. Evasive behavior. - Whereas. - A gap of one year in his resume. - How did he explain it.
May we? Could we be alone, please? I'm sure you can imagine why I'm here. My affidavit. You want to know why I didn't make it.
- What if the American people made a mistake. - They didn't. Does it matter if I am not so sure? Thank you, Christopher. - The pasta was excellent. - I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Open the damn door! ... Of dozens of arrests linked to the assassination attempt - on the president this month. - What the fuck? According to David Wellington, the president's chief of staff, those arrested include officials from all branches of government, including the Defense Department, State Department and CIA. Today the President sent a clear message to the American people, our democracy is strong and stable and that we will do whatever it takes to defend it.
I am on trial. For embezzlement, from the company I founded when I was 24. My family no longer speaks to me. This morning I was sitting in the park where I spent pleasant hours with my then little half-Vietnamese son. I watched a little boy who was completely engrossed in building a magnificent sand castle. Then he got up and, laughing happily, crushed it back into tiny grains of sand.
WEDDING OF RICHARD WAYNE AND KIMMY SCHMIDT ...of the Almighty, whom you know from Italian blankets, I hereby pronounce you Superman and wife. Thank you, oh great and mighty kind one! I'll see you later in paintball heaven! Believe me, I wish our marriage was as fake as the tooth fairy. Unfortunately, someone in the state of Indiana takes them very seriously. One of us used the marriage status as a tax break and used it to buy jet skis!
She's probably not as beautiful as the libraries you know.... -She's wonderful. -Beautiful. It is? Stunning. She likes them, too.
It's in the tow yard, Katie. The impound lot. Barbed wire, surveillance cameras, cops. - So you escape... Your getaway bag is in there. Get it, and I'll drive you to the station.
Good question. I'm not allowed to talk about it, but I'm on a list. What is that list? There are over 1,200 people, here in the United States, who will be treated separately in the event of a mega-disaster, nuclear war, terrorism, natural disaster, things like that. If our society is destroyed, we are the ones who get it going again.
Today, the Pilgrim capsule completes its eight-month return flight from Mars with its precious soil samples. Preparing to receive the samples has been the purpose of our mission for the past few months. But the Pilgrim capsule was damaged. At 0630 UTC, Pilgrim was hit by debris and went off course. Rory Adams will go out into space to make eye contact with the space capsule and bring it in with an extension arm.
Did she just move? Hugh? My God. It worked. They woke her up.
Control center, this is space station. Space station to control center. The location of the species is unknown. It is classified as hostile and deadly. We intend to isolate and destroy them according to regulations.
Zelda, calm down. We can go anywhere and do whatever we want. If you want to go to Paris, we'll go to Paris. If you want to ride a camel in Cairo, I'll go with you. The world is ours. And I want to see it with you. As long as we are together, it doesn't matter where we are.
You know, what you feel, the hurried look in your eyes, doesn't come from nowhere. Then where does it come from? Inside your being beats a tiny little heart. Do you mean something like my soul? A part of it, yes, the smallest part, but it has a certain power. It is called a "shadow."
You copy the whole universe? The symmetry is broken down to every free quantum particle. With one difference: The echo universe is free of organic compounds. Instead, it is a lifeless cosmos that holds an unlimited amount of matter that can be converted into energy. The tower, acting as a dimensional ladder, creates multiple gravitational portals that harness the echo mass and convert it into pure electromagnetic energy.
The box compensates for any instabilities that may occur in the echo. Instabilities? Really simple. It is installed directly in the echo tower. But someone has to put it there.
May I? Just plug it in? That's it? That's it. There's a data station right down in the echo tower. You jump over, bring the box to the tower, plug it in, and jump back in time for dinner.
You belong with us. Not anymore, Abby. Just get me in the tower. The tower? What are you going to do without the box? You destroyed it.
And what about the box? Is it safe? -Yes, sir. -Good. Don't let her out of your sight.
I can copy my ID for you. It won't do me any good. Here. I can give you this watch as a deposit, it's very good. My father gave it to me.
- No, Booth! Bones, what the hell are you doing? Get out of the way. No, Booth, you don't understand. The syringe, he wouldn't use it on me.
Forget the evidence! I have to get you to safety. The door! It's closing! Booth, did you find her?
- He survived the explosion. - Look at that. Why the broken clock? It stopped when the bomb went off. When the lab reopens, I'll hang it in my new office to remember.
So: This conversation is over, and I'm going to meditate before the stunt. Did you hear Susan's comments about the séance scene? - No. - She thought it was "too dramatic".
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Did you write a paper on The Window on the Yard? "What was the original title of The Stranger on the Train?" Get lost! There's no original title for that. My professor loved it and wanted to discuss it with me.
I need to find out what kind of research our victim was doing. Dr. Vaziri, I think I found something. Look at the distal end of the left ulna. Twisted spiral fracture. I've already documented it.
All of that was forgotten in the City of Light, but now it's back and so here we are. The bullet presses against his carotid artery. It's cutting off the blood flow to his brain. As soon as I get it out, he should wake up.
Do you understand that? Before you know it, you will have earned to survive. I hope so. The youth who inherited the earth. And they have six months to save them.
They do no harm. The idea that carbohydrates make you fat is completely ridiculous. Carbohydrates in themselves do not make you fat. We have in our muscles and liver. Depots for carbohydrates, namely glycogen. So when we eat carbohydrates, we store them or burn them.
Milk is a hormonal fluid that is full of sexual hormones and natural sexual steroid hormones such as estrogen, progesterone. It doesn't matter if it's conventional milk, or if it's organic milk. Milk without hormones, that's a contradiction in terms. Organic milk products have just as much saturated fat, cholesterol and galactose, everything you don't want, as conventional milk products. Dairy products in general are linked to many other products, not the least of which is pus. There are even laws that limit the pus content in milk so that it can still be sold.
So I was brought home by the police at the age of five with my Beauty and the Beast blanket. That's when I realized the key to happiness. Which was? Active denial. I thought about this thing and didn't see it as real.
Maybe the universe is trying to give you a little gift. Thank you for taking the bullet for me. You're my hero. Yeah, it was no big deal. Especially since I didn't take it for you.
That doesn't work. It just turns him on. Oh, the good cop, my hero. He knows the truth, Barbie. And I'm gonna beat it out of him.
- I am not a scientist. How can you be? - All his research is there on film. Okay? Slink says all you have to do is find the film reel with the instructions for the cure. Okay, let's say I find it, then what?
Because the truth is... No matter what shit you've been through, it doesn't justify hurting other people. That's what he taught me. Then it's a lie. No, the truth remains the truth, no matter what idiot says it.
Yes? Why don't you come inside for a minute? I can hear you fine from out here. Come on, we've already crossed the line. You want to cross it again?
The producers assigned to this show decided to test it, in Jersey.
Drink. You must not fall asleep. Did you take care of the battery? Yeah, it was dead, but... We replaced it a few hours ago.
- You are not like him. - You don't know that. Jace... Join me and my son! Together, we will rid the world of the demons that plague it.
We both have a healthy competitive spirit. I grew up with Jace. I didn't have a choice. Some people can't stand that energy. I, on the other hand, find it invigorating, as do your ex-girlfriends, I suppose.
- What kind of rune? - I don't know. - It's not in the Grey Book. - Can you show it to me? Is it possible that my mother sent it?
Gideon said the motorcycles that Darhk and Merlyn stole are here. So you want us to look for a sign that says, "This way"? Good idea. LEGENDS DOWN HERE If you subjugate the world, don't save it.
The trigger is rusted through. - That's good, right? That's a good sign? - No. It's really bad news. - It means we can't disarm it.
- AA thing. Sorry. Have fun. I just need to talk to Andy about an AA thing, so can you pause the episode or is it bugging everybody else? We'll let it run, but come back as soon as you can.
- What? Are you okay? A car hit my shopping cart. A grapefruit exploded where my head could have been. This grapefruit. Look at it.
- Well... - In that data pool, they had exactly what you needed for that particular guy, - it must have been huge. - The term is more like "colossal." What? One of the last things my father said to me when he gave me the rags was that they have a power that most people can't even imagine and that I needed to respect them and protect that power, not abuse it.
It is called living. Prometheus has you so fixated on what's wrong with you that you don't even perceive what's right anymore. You know, John and Felicity listen to you because you have more to offer than just this. Your past is a part of you. You can't do anything about it. You can't change it.
Walker was on his way to the hangar. - In all likelihood, the bomb is there. - Felicity! Why the trick? Why sell a nuke only once when I can steal it back and sell it to some other rebel shithead.
- What do you mean? Any attempt to defuse the bomb will exponentially shorten the countdown time. What are you doing? Hoping I can figure out how to fly a plane. - What? - I can't disarm the bomb, but hopefully I can get it to a less populated area.
Would it be a good idea to alert all emergency rooms? - Do that. - What were you doing here with a gun? Judging by how I tagged the guy, I'd say I was saving people's lives. Your security said the shooter dropped his first weapon. - We need to get to them before the police do.
- Mr. Mayor. What is this? My resignation letter accepting sole responsibility for the cover-up. - No. - The cover-up was my idea. - I approved it.
Thank you. - What happens next? - You mean what do I do with your secret? I'll keep it to myself. I care about the city, and... and you're working double shifts to make it a better place.
Oliver. We're not targets, buddy. We're your comrades. We're your strength. You give me strength until Chase turns it into weakness.
Fortunately, we have both friends and money. As I assume, your presence here means that our agreement has borne fruit. The shipment has been routed to this location. The BIC codes are inside. All you have to do is get them back.
Fortunately, I got a chance to see the file they were working on. Orechovo-Suyevo. That's a shipyard in Moscow. Then we go to the shipyard. We stop Kovar from recovering it.
How long does it take to crack it. (3.1610^18) (E^6) (75 teraflops).... 13 months. I know someone who can do it faster. Kord Industries. They developed the cipher, they can also decrypt it.
What do you mean you hurt her? I heated up some soup for her. It was just all I could make her.... And she was on the stove and I was passed out from the booze. Poor Zoe tried to touch it and pulled it down and she burned her hand really bad.
How's it going here? Every defense attorney in town just found out the DA is a serial killer, so not good. Do you think the court will overturn Chase's convictions? If I didn't, I wouldn't have called this emergency meeting. It would be quite nice if the mayor would chair it.
We checked every incoming and outgoing call from Burkhardt's cell phone. Besides the ones we had already checked, there is only one number that occurs repeatedly. - Which one is? - Probably means nothing. We checked it. It's one.
- But I'm fine. - No. I'm not leaving until you talk to me. You said, "When everything goes crazy, don't push me away." When I was tortured in Valentine's body, the rune of pain awakened my worst memory. And now I can't get rid of it.
Yes, all good. A Iratze could help you with that. Oh, no. I don't have my stele. I must have lost it in the water.
- Yes, I mean, theoretically. And you insulted my portal. Maybe I can. On the other hand, my stele might come in handy. We should get back to the lake and find it.
Mom, you don't do that. I mean, it's supposed to be private. In our family, you do it. Simon's father started this tradition. And now we're keeping it in his memory.
- Otherwise? - She might lose her mind. Remember my eighth birthday? You gave me my first seraph blade. I was so happy to use it that I sneaked out of the hut.
Oh yes, this is the pendant for her 16th birthday. -Are you sure this is all Rebecca's? -Oh yes. I wanted to get her something for her housewarming, not to be clingy or judgmental, but a good mom. And that's when I tried to find her new address online, because she won't give it to me.
Shit, that's mine. -Blocking code? -7-1-8-7. Nate writes, "Thanks for the air mattress. I'll bring it back next week."
No backing down in this game, okay? Not with a gun or a knife, unless it was self-defense. I think I would use my brain. My best tool. Reading people. Words. I'd find out their weakness and... exploit them.
Nothing out of the ordinary. Good. Well... I recommend that Dolly try medication for a while. I thought I'd get the meds. I'm not saying I'm going to give them to her, either.
You may fool others, but I know you, Jeannie. I'm not trying to fool anybody. Imagine if you had to live in that two-room apartment. I like that apartment. Oh, I know you do. I'm still paying for it.
They try to distract with intimidation and lies so that one does not recognize their truth, their guilt and their shame. These are deeply rooted in their history. In their experiences. Even in their childhood. Some people want power because they no longer want to feel powerless. They need an outlet. To really feel power, you have to exercise it over something or someone.
- By the way, thank you for the gift. - What gift? My coin. Yes, I know someone who is looking for that coin. But he can't get it.
- My lucky coin, you room fire. - Shit. My husband gave me the coin. Curse his dark eyes. Just gave it away.
This man deserves our respect. Fuck respect. My gift to you. We're telling this story, Shadow. You can tell it any way you want or don't want.
So you failed. So no one came to your opening. Don't let it end like this. Greatness takes time... and you know it. When a string is knotted, patience will untie it.
Antibiotics will not work. We have to do something. Nothing is not an option. Okay, what do you do when a banana ripens too fast? - Put it in the freezer.
That's what worries you. Another life that could have existed and never did. Caitlin and Ronnie should have had it. A family, a future. The future doesn't always come the way we want it to.
Sounds like she's in trouble. - You step back, I'll kick the door down. - You step back, I'll kick the door down. - I didn't mean that because of the sex. I just wanted to...
She is an incredibly brave, strong woman. One look is enough and you can see it. And she wants to be with him. No matter how afraid she was to tell you, no matter how dangerous it is to be with him, the only thing that matters is that they are together. And when you find a love like that, you have to hold on to it.
He calls himself Abra Kadabra. - As in tricks? - He's clearly got a lot of tricks. Yes, we think he has some kind of nanotechnology built into his body that allows him to do unusual tricks. Teleportation, telekinesis, take your pick, and believe me, I've seen them all.
Okay, slowly. - Come on. - Easy, easy. - Yeah, yeah. - Give me the X-ray machine, bring it here, would you, please?
He can learn. - I still know what to do. I can teach him. Maybe you can defeat Savitar that way. But there are still many villains in this city, and no flashes to protect them.
- So, we're building a cannon. - That's right. - A bazooka thing. - It's kind of a trap. - To turn it on, - we need something as a power source.
For what? It doesn't matter. - Should I stop her? - No. Let them take it.
Anyway, according to the descriptions, the dimensions of the bell are exactly the same as those written about by Dalton St. John. That's what Seline was looking for in 1883. Why would she be interested in a church bell? Peter Maxwell was the last person to hold the witch bell. Until he threw it off a bridge, 20 or more years ago.
- Any more unnecessary demands? I will not free them until you bring me that bell. What do you need the bell for anyway? I'm sentimental. I want it.
I will not free them until you bring me that bell. What do you need the bell for anyway? I'm sentimental. I want it. And I need your help finding it.
Are you okay? I'm fine. I just need to find Sybil an antique bell that your dad threw over Wickery Bridge. Wait, slow down, I haven't kept up since "I'm fine." When your father lived in Mystic Falls, he took our founding bell to Wickery Bridge and threw it over the railing.
I'm fine. I just need to find Sybil an antique bell that your father threw over Wickery Bridge. Wait, slow down, I haven't kept up since "I'm fine." When your father lived in Mystic Falls, he took our founding bell to Wickery Bridge and threw it over the railing. And now Sybil wants it back.
Also, we know Sybil's trip is near Mystic Falls. - We are going in the right direction. - All because she wants a bell. I've never heard anything so crazy. Says the guy who threw her off the bridge.
What were you actually thinking about? - I was thinking about the parade. - What? The Founder's Day parade. That's when the Founding Bell is attached to a float and some rich kid rings it while two douchebags stand next to him wearing musty Civil War uniforms?
I figured it out through Dalton's measurements. With the Maxwell heirloom and the tuning fork, you can put together a swivel, the hammer that swings inside a bell. These three missing things are part of a bell. When put together correctly, this bell becomes a mystical, supernatural super bell. It makes you wonder what would happen if you let it ring.
No. You know him by another name: the devil. Seline is also here. She has the tuning fork. They force Ethan to attach it to the bell.
Beatrice has a plan to stop the sirens. You did it. You're trapped. So are you, Mr. Maxwell. You made the bell and the witches cursed it, so the blood of hundreds of souls is on your hands.
I mean, of course, if you want to hear how we're going to exterminate every last vampire in America. You're always caught in the middle. Why don't you pick a side for once? The hellhounds. When you sell your soul to a demon, - they're the ones who come and rip it out of you.
You slaughtered the competition. Sometimes literally. And yet I never slaughtered you, Ketch. Well, we were having a lot of sex at the time. I studied the American situation and how to fix it for years.
Many police investigators, concerned citizens, and television employees expressed doubts about how the Baudelaire orphans ended up in Count Olaf's care. The scene behind me is a flashback. That word means it happened during the last episode. Shortly after the Baudelaire fire and during the Baudelaire children's stay with the Poes. I show it in the hope that the police investigators, concerned citizens, and television employees will finally leave me alone.
Count Olaf is after our fortune. Killing us won't do him any good. What does he get out of our appearance in The Heavenly Wedding? Marriage is like licking bitter ice cream or being in the back of a horse costume. Even on stage, you should only enter into it with someone you love.
HELLO MONTY You're a tasty meal For the living dead The sturdy oak barrier! You have broken through it!
"used so often it's an annoying cliché". "In the meantime at the ranch" describes how plot lines are connected and has nothing to do with cows or salad dressing. I mean by "in the meantime at the ranch," "in the meantime in the reptile room," where the adults were having an adult conversation. If we put the peaches in a row towards the cage, the snake will follow the trail, and we can lock it in.
Uncle Monty's handwriting. He copied it out in the movie theater. We were sitting next to him. We would have noticed a message. Unless he got it secretly.
Still, Kirkman is smart. And he's learning more and more. I saw relentless candidates who barely survived a term as president. That's not something you can learn. Come on. I mustered all my strength to get back in the mix, and I'm not going to let amateurs push me out again. There's a connection between MacLeish and the shooter, and I'm going to find it.
I am sure. - No. No. Why? Afraid of Dockery bail? It's good to change it now and then.
Which I now set at $2. 500. I fucked up. Chuck set me up again. The recording? He made sure Ernie heard it, right?
I fucked up. Chuck set me up again. The recording? He made sure Ernie heard it, right? He knew Ernie, God bless him, would tell me... and I'd try to destroy it or steal it.
Without physical evidence, a taped confession... ...if I could get one, was the safest bet. By itself, it would be too weak. But it was a start, the basis for a more watertight case. Jimmy must have felt the recording was evidence enough. Otherwise he wouldn't have destroyed it.
Each of them was happy to come here to support their attorney. Jimmy reached out to people...who otherwise might never have gone to an attorney in their lives. He made sure they had wills...that were in accordance with their Last Wills...and that they could afford. Because Jimmy McGill cares about people. He devoted the last three years to his brother's well-being. He got up at 5 a.m. to get Charles' favorite newspaper, at the only newsstand that carries it in this town.
Hey. What's up? New guitar. Check it out.
And I know that for sure, as only a twin can know. But Jason would not want us to grieve all year. Jason would want us to move on with our lives. That's why I asked the school board not to cancel the dance party. Rather, we should use it to get over it together and celebrate my brother's far too short life in this travail of the earthly.
Admit what? If I had a football game tomorrow, would you stop me? - I'd... I'd... - No, because you understand football... respect it. But my music, ever since I told you about it, you don't care about it. You don't take it seriously.
He has a lot of power. And he has put our last dime into this business. So he's really... He's a businessman. He saw an opportunity and he took it.
Someone put the gun, Jason's murder weapon, in fp's trailer. It wasn't there when we searched him. This is a setup. - Maybe you missed it.
All of us. We shouldn't have broken in there, but we did. My dad just got arrested for murder. The gun wasn't there when we were. Someone put it there afterwards.
Arrange a meeting place for the handover. But before I could do that, the boy got loose. Tried to escape. And then you shot him and stuffed him in the freezer. When things calmed down and you stopped looking for his body in the river, I dumped it there.
- Betty, it's not just the police who have it in for the snakes. The whole town agrees with Mayor McCoy. The crime is spreading. There's real anger out there, Betty. And they need to vent it somewhere.
- Um...I... - I'm a live one. So we don't want the cops snooping around. I can get rid of the body. Just help me lift it.
- I'm a live one. So we don't want the cops snooping around. I can get rid of the body. Just help me lift it. Help him lift it.
Where have you been, Norman? Ham goes better with sourdough bread. I'll have wheat bread. The kitchen was quite a mess. I cleaned it up. I guess I cleaned it up myself and forgot.
It's all right. Then why do I feel so terrible, Mother? Are you all right? Sorry about the lamp. I'll pay for it.
But you couldn't save her. All you could do was watch her being abused. I don't want to feel this. You wanted to know the truth? - I don't want to know anymore. - You wanted to understand who I am?
I am sure that you saved my life. That was my goal. I know I had a gun with me. Where is it? You must have dropped it.
I have read all your poems. I am one of your biggest fans. "My candle burns at both ends; it does not last the night; but ah, my enemies and oh, my friends, a beautiful light it makes!"
So if a straight guy and a girl are equally hot and hang out together often, does one eventually develop a crush? - Usually the boy. That's biology. - I missed that chapter. Jonah got a text from Grace, and she wouldn't let me see her.
It's... It's hard to see him lying there. I understand. I was serious about tonight. And he gave it to me in class.
Twenty-two years! I never cheated. Not once. And I had the opportunity more than once. But I never took advantage of it.
- Bye. What, "I CAN DO IT" Finally, our blissful ending. Pick up the ball cards from the student council. Siri knows the capital of Finland. Why do I have to learn it?
Tarly, I want to see you in my lab tonight. How bad is it? I'll find out in the evening. Where are you going? I surrendered to this disease as soon as I saw it.
- Stranger things happen. - What are they? The grain supplies are being loaded onto carts, my lord. The new harvest? We're having them brought in. From all the farms in the Expanse.
Cersei Lannister does that, not me. I am not here to murder. And I only want to destroy the wheel that rolls over rich and poor alike, for the sole benefit of the Cersei Lannisters of this world. I offer you a choice. Kneel, and join me. Together, we will make the world a better place than we found it.
Of course. Take your time. I'll wait out here. Does Otto know? I'm the owner. After the stroke, we had it signed over to me.
-Usually alone. Thank you for making an exception. Please. I hope you'll forgive Mr. Zerk's hands-off approach. Perhaps. I won't forget it.
- Red. - Red. Then make them red. Change it. Make the wall red, Mary. Make it red. It is red.
I've been in the tub like this before. Frankie... That's the TV remote. Oh, good, a nice nature documentary would be great right now. The remote's in the phone cradle? -To help me find it.
Yes. But God won't let me stew forever for it. -I guess it's a matter of gradations. -Yes. Religion is most beneficial when enjoyed à la carte.
If her words were to be believed, and she was anything but certainly not a liar, then her book on battle magic should be here. - In this room. - Why? She told me. "The battle magic will be where the knowledge always is. The day you need it, I promise, it will be your last hope."
You know what I like to do? When I've had a bad day and it feels like I'm just in trouble? I like to go into the bathroom and lock the door behind me. Go ahead and open it. You open it.
Look. Look in his eye. Heather. Heather. Interesting. You had a gun and you didn't use it.
-You're cursing a lot tonight. -Yeah, I noticed that too. I guess I didn't think we'd bury the box. What did you think, honey? That we'd take it home, clean it, stash the tax receipts in it? Which we can't, because the lid's missing.
Do you want to fuck her? Yes, we want to fuck her. All night long. So, how much would it cost? We would like to take her, because we are shy.
- What's going on? - Right away, ma'am. Dan Wells, Portland PD! I need you to open the door. Dan, if you don't open this door, we're going to break it down.
For it is written in one of your mother's books that blood is associated with the passage into death, like fallen warriors on the battlefield, or the prey of a hunter in his final state.... Human sacrifice on the altar.... and sometimes blood is used as currency. Eve, not so fast. What if blood could be used as currency to get to the other world? Blood magic is very dangerous. We would only use it to get to the other side.
No entry for people without night shift. Yes, but I only need a moment. I forgot my purse. I'm sorry. Get it tomorrow.
You can see the negative side, cry and complain. Or the beautiful side, enjoy, laugh and look forward. That's my choice. Everything in life has a good side, even Madrid. Even if you don't see it.
Don't tell me you're here to renegotiate the terms? I'm not taking it. - Mike, just... - Just listen to me. When I was on trial, I said that... I was given a gift and I didn't use it.
I'm here for a fresh start. I assume by "new beginning" you mean doing something to help Mike Ross now that he's out in the world. Anita, you heard his speech to the jury. He was given a gift and he squandered it.
These kids need your help. I wanted to help people as a lawyer, not as a teacher. What's the difference? The difference is, clients actually want my help. Michael, these kids need it.
- Watch it, Harvey. - Robert... I'm not looking for a fight with you. But as my partner told you before, we don't need your charity. Then I'll stop offering it.
Your Honor, Mr. Grady gave me a copy of this bullshit 20 minutes ago, and he specifically agreed that it was not relevant. That is a lie. You may have called me, but we did not talk about it. Your Honor, she called 20 times. Yes, presumably to say why her rent payment is delayed because she never paid it.
Did you think I wouldn't check up on you if all of a sudden a Queens legal clinic started acting like an inner-city law firm? Well, I did. And if this goes to court, I'm going to take him on, and we all know what happened last time. You wouldn't be here if that was all you wanted to tell me. Why don't you give me a number and I will forward it to my client.
It's better for legal counsel to think that I have confidence in them, not that you don't have confidence in me. - They are back. - And how I am back, because I have looked at what they are doing and why they are doing it. There's not really much to find there, Mr. Specter. Let me break it down for you. Velocity Data Solutions has stolen your technology and they intend to bring it to market quickly, so you want to stage a business takeover to get back what's yours.
No. For can ask for a special exception and.... And I said no, you understand? You are not a person who is allowed to appear in court. They won't allow it, and this is not your job. Then at least I can sit near him.... Listen to me! I gave you a chance because I needed it, but if you put the reputation of this law firm on the line over a tenant dispute, I will fire you and make sure you never set foot in a courtroom again.
Do you understand that? - You're not screwed. - I don't have a choice. Just put the gun down. Put it down.
He doesn't do that. He said I was like a son to him. No, never. You ever wonder where the murder weapon is? The night of the murder, Shakowski tells you to get it and bring it to him.
I cannot move. I can't do anything. That's bullshit. It's like a date fajita. You give me all the ingredients, let me put them together, and then burn me.
Give it to me. -Jump up. -You bitch! I didn't need any help. But you took it.
Someone here bought a jacket from me some time ago. With a parrot on the collar. Yes. It belongs to the pet dragon. She wore it when we visited the big cave in Kentucky.
She wore it when we visited the big cave in Kentucky. That's great. All my current grief started when I sold the jacket. So, uh... I need it.
She paid a lot for it. Well, I can give her 2,000 in cash. It's yours. Will she fuck the jacket? And then sell it for more money.
-I'm here, gentlemen. Put your cocks away. I'm not gonna do that. Chuck, your death scene gets longer and more moving every night. The crowd loved it.
Do the others. You have to be patient. Our website should be easy to use, but also look cool. Customers shouldn't think they're shopping for dull textbooks. That's great, but who's going to make it functional?
Okay, Donna, it's going to be a show of force. Son of a bitch. Otis Redding's first album? You sure Harvey won't mind me taking it? Are you kidding? No, he says if this collection isn't for everyone, why would he even have it here?
There will be a lot of blood. We need to wrap him in something that doesn't leak. We need to get him to the car in something unsuspicious. With a body in it, that box is going to be very heavy. Then we won't carry it.
You're welcome. Okay, that's not how it was supposed to go. We're both Inhumans. Like you said, we're stuck with each other. Why not make the best of it? I read your written statement and believe it.
Vijay, don't do this. You're making a mistake. He's not safe with her. Jemma, Vijay had a choice, and he made it.
Please be patient. Meanwhile, could you please tell me why you are so opposed to Inhumans. Yes. Some of them are monsters, true, but.... These Inhumans have not suffered and toiled to become what they are. They have great power, but they didn't earn it.
Until now. Pure Terrigen crystals. I got a few samples last year while working for a previous benefactor. His goals were the opposite of yours. I worked on improving the connection, making it grow.
Yes. Wait. What? That blue soap that everyone uses? Hydra pumps them full of chemicals.
Must be contraband. Busted my neighbor yesterday for a laptop. - The drone. It's in my bag. - It's in my bag. I was gonna bring it back myself so you wouldn't get in trouble.
We freed that last year. This is a Quinjet? Yes. And the fleet that Mace described? You commanded it.
I didn't think Fitz was capable of doing something like that. Oh, my dear. Depending on the circumstances, anyone is capable of anything. Just look around you. Please tell me you put a back door in and Aida didn't destroy it.
He has no reason to lie. Maybe someone else found it and took it. The backdoor is part of the framework's digital infrastructure. - You can't move it. - But you could hide it.
Regret. You have built an empire by eradicating the regrets of others. How does it taste on your tongue? I want to burn this world. I thought you wanted to rule it.
Ok. See you. What about me? What about my soul? We can test it.
Fuck. A rose is a rose, except here. Here it must mean something. It's beautiful. Mrs. Waterford cut it off specially.
Harvey, I'm running out of ways to tell you that I don't want to be a corporate lawyer. I'm offering you a deal. One for you, one for me. I don't want to fund legal services for just one year. I want to fund it for two years. And on every case that I want to bring legal counsel in on, I get to bring them in.
At the very moment when all hope is lost, our Savior will show Himself to the terrified masses. Genius. The world on its knees, looking for guidance, like the ugly girl at a gang bang. Her uniform. Some find it a bit extravagant.
That turns you on? We never tried to feed you fish. You really should talk about me differently. No. Frozen is almost as good as fresh. We'll buy a freezer, put it in storage, and when we kill someone, I'll chew off a piece if I want to eat.
I could not control myself. And over there the road. Maybe someone saw us. What are we going to do? Okay, there's no one here, it's dark, there are no surveillance cameras. We'll put the body in our car, take it to the camp, you can eat there.
-Mine is broken. Really... Okay, the heavy day today has taken its toll. We don't have time. We have to move the body or the dogs will find it.
Wait a second. "Like a dewdrop clinging to a blade of grass." That's good. Really? You think so? I find that metaphor rather ordinary. I think it's beautiful. Blade of grass.
-It's unlikely, but.... -Whatever it is, I'm in. You are? Abby is going to grow up to be a wonderful woman, and I want to be a part of that as much as I can. If there's a chance for a cure, no matter how unlikely, I want to take it.
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES THE STORY OF CORA WOLF Sometimes the world rejects the one person who would be able to save it.
Something that is 500 years old will help me. And here... is the remedy. It took me years to find the modern equivalent of the medieval Serbian ingredients. You can't just find myrrh in the supermarket. I have tested the formula and it works.
Yes, I have. Finally. Some truth in the night. Julius, I work at a counseling center, but not as a lawyer. The opportunity arose to become one, and I turned it down, but then I had to sit there and watch a woman get kicked to the curb because I couldn't help her.
Some truth in the night. Julius, I work at a counseling center, but not as a lawyer. The opportunity arose to become one, and I turned it down, but then I had to sit there and watch a woman get put out on the street because I couldn't help her. And I knew that I would have to watch that happen over and over again. When the opportunity came a second time, I took it.
Why are you showing me the peace sign? - Double it. - What? I don't want to fund legal services for just one year. I want to fund it for two years.
You're welcome. I'll let you get back to work. I just think you're rushing it. And I mean, when you overthrow a dictator, you don't leave his statue built up in the square. You tear it down.
- Concentration. God, the Lord, built a woman from the rib, which he had taken from man, and brought her to man. And the man said, Woman shall she be called, because.... from man she was taken. Both Adam and his wife were naked, but they were not ashamed of each other. May God bless this union... and make it fruitful.
One more try. What's that? Whitford gave me a gun. Just in case, okay? Do you know how to use it?
Whitford gave me a gun. Just in case, okay? You know how to use it? Yeah, a little. I know how to load it.
Yes, something. I know how to load them. We need to be ready, okay, June? Just in case. Then show me how to load it.
They would have sent my bag to the wrong hotel. Is your little suit in there? If she wants, she can expose it as a lie in two seconds. No courier brought my bag. No hotel picked it up.
I think she has it. The bag went missing. - How? She just had to get from A to B. I've heard that before. Occasionally. El-Mashad's wife was supposed to take it today.
- Daya, you want to take a rest? - Pidge still has to give me the gun. - What? She gets it, but I don't. She's giving it back to me.
I already experience enough shit here on earth. - I don't think about space that much. - You sound like Nurse Ingalls. She hates space travel. She thinks it's a waste of resources.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin. But my capsule went off course, and when I finally arrived, my cousin had already become Superman. So I hid my abilities until an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world. To most, I'm an assistant at CatCo Worldwide Media. But secretly, I work with my adopted sister for the DEO to protect my city from all who would threaten it.
Honestly, you idiots still haven't figured it out? It all started when we blew up the time masters. History is messed up. But we can fix it.
Previously on Legends of Tomorrow.... It's a compass. Have you ever heard of the Holy Lance? The lance could change reality. We broke it into four parts.
I trust you. I don't understand why you can't trust me. That was good. Is there a technique to that, or was it just a kick in the butt? Because if that's a technique, I want to learn it.
You have to be careful, because Cadmus has a weapon. - What kind of weapon? - A nuclear fusion bomb. They're gonna destroy National City and blame it on aliens. - How did Cadmus get it?
- What kind? - A nuclear fusion bomb. They'll destroy National City and blame it on aliens. - How did Cadmus get it? - They built it.
He hid drugs in his bedroom. Sorry I'm late. Do you have my wallet? - No. I have it myself.
They're checking the surrounding businesses for surveillance cameras. Yes, well, there's nothing here to suggest he's been on a date. Guitar accessories, but no guitar. No, he'd have that on him. If he had a guitar, he wouldn't give it up.
Okay, so he sees Keith with the guitar or he sees the killer himself who took the guitar from Keith. - Follow him home. - We know Woody found his targets at the mall. Why does the killer take the guitar to the mall? Was trying to sell it? Wanted it valued?
She got her hands on your disposable cell phone, dialed the only number in it. She blew your cover. - You're wrong. - You found the recording later, after the raid went south. You found it... and you erased it.
- It's not sustainable. What do you really think about it? - Of what? - The president's warmongering. Most people in Washington think it's scandalous.
Now try to look relaxed. But you're still covering the same part of the kayak as you stand there. Is that so? - Can I take a look at that spot? It's no big deal. I want to see it.
It's no big deal. I want to see it. The crack is not big at all, quite superficial. Just like the ad said. - I want to see them.
Mom, I'm cold. Vincent, what is it? The witch used personal items to bind them to the spell. Totems. I know this magic. I can reverse it.
I think I will keep it for a while. It was not a gift. Today showed that Marcel is a danger as a victim or as an obsessive. - Still... - What's the point of having a gun if you don't use it?
No. We've hidden them, haven't we? - Really? - In our secret place! Yes. Where no one would ever find them.
- You stole our gun? - No, it was in her belt. - Angie, are you kidding me? - What are you kidding me for? You had it in your belt!
- Told you. Yes, I understand about the cloaking device. But why this shape? Why do you like it? - Who says I like them?
Yes, I understand about the cloaking device. But why this shape? Why do you like them? - Who says I like it? - You kept it.
Are you not listening? Hit the reset button. All computers have one, and anyone can find it. Especially if you happen to be a scary, pretty genius from outer space. I reinitiated the entire command structure, keeping all the programmed capabilities, but deleting the complementary preference architecture. - Turned it off and on again.
Pressed the reset button. All computers have one, and anyone can find it. Especially if you happen to be a scary, pretty genius from outer space. I reinitiated the entire command structure, keeping all the programmed capabilities, but deleting the complementary preference architecture. - He turned them off and back on. - I turned it off and on again.
-She's already gone. -Reroute her, then. Where do we... What do we do? -Where do we send her?
Thank you. Usually street art scares me, but this is totally beautiful. Beautiful it shouldn't be. Well, I like that it tells a story. That love gives you legs to stand on, and without them you're a gross, deformed cripple.
Can't we just enjoy having me back? I've missed you. Come here. The cops are gonna be pissed that you're on TV before you talk to them. Exclusive interviews only make sense if the story reaches a worldwide audience before you tell anyone else.
You shot a guard and you say "Hey"? - What's wrong with you, anyway? - Everything, apparently. Where did you get a gun? That Humps brought it.
He will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked." Your feet must be disgusting. That is the problem with female prisoners. Men understand violence. They respect it.
After a victory, even a warm beer tastes good. We just reached one million viewers! A million people have seen what a violent worm you are. Your hand fit twice around that girl's arm. Yet you had to break it to stop her.
Piper, honey, is that you? What are you doing here? My kid is part of a prisoner revolt. That's where you come in. Tell me you're not leading them.
She is not yours or your red-blooded king's. I can't let you go with her. You have no choice. Good technique. I know her very well.
The constituency leaders fought tooth and nail. And you wanted to provide troops. I tried to do that as well. I mentioned the arrangement to Roger Frank of the ACLU. He revealed it to Barney Leonard of the Black Coalition.
They simply cease to exist. So no trace of them remains? They become extinct? Slade? What's the point of having this gift if you can't use it the way you have to?
More lemonade, please. A country bumpkin and a hillbilly are walking down a country road talking about the Garden of Eden. The hick drinks whiskey as he walks and believes that Adam and Eve had a right to this apple because if God were kind, why would he deny them this delicious fruit? The hillbilly listens and nods. Then the hillbilly drinks the bottle and throws it on the ground.
Martin Byrde. He said his client would not allow it. That's how he put it. Even though he saw the body himself? I saw Sheriff Nix fish it out right in front of him.
Anything. Thank you. Okay, bye. Where's my toy chest? - You lost it.
Until the baby is here. And then we'll figure out what to do. Where are you going? Pray, damn it. A commitment we take so seriously that we never break it.
Aren't you going to help him out? You hardly care if he goes to school. He's smart, he can miss a few days. If you want the dough so bad, you do it. But you learned how to wash it.
Drink this. Where's the gun? It's safe. The gun is safe. I hid it.
It is safe. The gun is safe. I hid it. No one will find it. - I need it.
- All right. Then you'll be back in 30 minutes. Do me a favor. - I want your phone number. - Write it down.
I think we should wait until he comes. We'll have to think about that to make your story believable. Forensics is top notch these days. It could have been almost anyone. It used to take a good story, now we plant the DNA, they send it to the lab.
I won't stop until we have a solution that saves everyone. If I'm on the list, you're on the list. Write it down, or I will. Bellamy, I can't. Now let's put it away and hope we never need it.
Luna, Nyko, it's time. I said let's go. What's going on? A.L.I.E.'s rules... Frikdreina can not cross this border. I have never crossed it.
Of course, Clarke and Bellamy should be there. Strong leadership is essential for survival. All right. Don't like the list? Consider it shredded.
Looks empty. Anyone want to take a crack at it? Whatever killed him could still be in there. The electronics store has a drone with a camera. Dad and I took a look at it the last time we were there.
-Yes, you can. -What does that have to do with me? Sam... We have evidence that someone hacked Pastiche's Facebook account and sent out the invite for her blackface party. Shit. My editor wants to run the story as soon as possible, but.... If someone else publishes it before we do....
Before this party, a black person on this campus couldn't even think the word "racism" without being told they were imagining things. Just like it took a Sandra Bland a Trayvon Martin and a Philando Castile to wake some up this party was needed to wake up the campus. Listen. I sent out the invitation. I wrote it.
Just as it took a Sandra Bland a Trayvon Martin and a Philando Castile to wake some up this party was needed to wake up the campus. Listen. I sent out the invitation. I wrote it. Hacked Pastiche's account and sent them out.
- Father, I will kiss you. What do you say Cumali? - Father, I'm going to kiss you. - Are you crazy, son? Raise your hand, I'll kiss it.
Grapes? Oh, wait a minute. Is it fertilizer? I bet you like coming here and doing mortals, because back home in the land of the gods you have little to say? Watch your mouth, or I'll cut off your tongue and eat it right in front of you.
Duck! - Shit... - What the hell? The chain was the only thing keeping my hand from... - Put it back.
Sam White was. Why would she do that? Otherwise, no one would have known about the party plans. The party wouldn't have happened without her involvement. But she didn't throw it, she uncovered it.
The party would not have taken place without her intervention. But she didn't throw it, she exposed it. If we print that, people will misunderstand what she's trying to say. We don't control what others do with the truth. We can only report it.
Don't worry, I'll delete the post. Sam? Shit. My editor wants to run the story as soon as possible. But if someone else gets to it before we do... You know what I mean?
No, you're one of a kind, man. Anyone can see that. -You want to hear some music? -Clear. I sent the invitation. I wrote it.
Everyone can see that. -You want to hear some music? -Clear. I sent the invitation. I wrote it. Cracked Pastiche's account and sent it.
The party was needed to shake up the campus. KORDELL: FAIRBANKS TO VICTORY! CLIFTON: GOOD LUCK TODAY! THANE: BARACK OBRAUNSKI! I sent out the invitation. I wrote it.
And of course, there's no way you can turn such a machine into a sports car. Or maybe you can? First of all, we need to remove this clumsy body. You can't do that with modern cars, because the body is the skeleton. If you remove it, there's nothing left but a bunch of individual parts.
One second! Have you put on the purple one yet? I'm not wearing purple! I hate the jacket. I love it.
I just think about how it changed everything. I thought you said it was all beautiful. O, it is. So is the eruption of a volcano or a tsunami. Few things are as beautiful as destruction, but that doesn't mean I enjoy it.
Do you know why, Gregory? Hurry up! - Is the door locked? - Come in. Boys, open it for him.
I love you. Where are you, Eddie? You're a denier. You're the son. What's behind that door? If you don't open it, you'll never escape.
We were going to start her world tour, but now she wants to take a break and just hang out on the beach. The venues are booked. Millions are at stake. Fear... At least that's what I hear. The key is not to remove that fear, but to channel it, to use it.
Have you seen the Black Hat Reservation? It's a rest stop. A motel, a supermarket, rocks and asphalt, booze and pills.... They're drunken welfare freeloaders. I understand your liberal thinking. I can understand it.
Abby, are you there? I'm here. There may be a solution. That's great. But to find it, I have to do something I never thought I'd have to do.
The president has big ideas for the future, as do we. The President made it clear that gun control is very important to him. We see things differently, but to address the issue openly, as Chairman, I am reintroducing Bill 8180 from the former Congress, which supports State background checks. I am opposed to the bill, but as part of the bipartisan debate, I would like to bring it before the Senate.
Oh, my God. Agent Wells, what do you have for me? This was found in Brooke Mathison's house, the woman Charles Langdon knew as Claudine. This looks like the threat assessment from the Capitol. The same strategic group made it.
- Did you find the helicopter? - Blacked out license plate. There's no FAA flight control in the area. Like flying into a vacuum. Have they secured the ammunition? Special Forces got there after Hannah called them in.
As a result, the Maryland State Police secured the area, and waited for the FBI. It then looked like this. That flash, is that the grenade going off? Yes. At first we assumed he was shot before, but the coroner's report is inconclusive. He could have detonated it intentionally.
But now I need your advice. What are my options? You don't have any. That's the problem. Deny the story, commit perjury. Confirm it, confess you don't know who did it, which panics the country.
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you. Ready for tonight? Satisfied with your speech? I hope so. I wrote it myself this time.
Sit down. I just need a second. Okay. You have a lovely home. Thank you, dear. So let's form this band of robbers and call it the Tom Sawyer Gang.
Wait here. I'll get Detective Mills. Yes? Hi. I'm still waiting for that e-mail. - I'll send it.
From the beginning. Unfortunately, Tom. Alas. He's had a rough year. Before his time at McMillan. It took a lot out of him. Maybe he had trouble carrying the responsibility. He carried it for a long time. Alone. Really.
Where is the money now? I left it in plain sight on the dresser in the policewomen's room. I like your music. My girlfriend gave me the CD. She didn't like it that much.
Oh, you stupid American pig! You think you can escape me, but I grab you by the hair. I turn you around and then you experience the "social case". And I pull you up, make "potato soup" with you. Eat it up!
Trust and thrift. God, you sound like a Protestant. Is that bad? Hey! If any of you know where my video camera is, or happen to steal it, bring it back immediately.
I wear these glasses and I'm very smart One day I'll be a Nobel Prize winner How did you film this? With the video camera from my locker. My video camera... was in your locker? Yeah, somebody must have put it in there.
History is behind me. Tradition is behind me. I know you are also behind me. To take away my crown would be nothing less than theft. You stole it, didn't you?
And I understand it. I don't think you do. You're fired. Put your gun on the table and I'll walk you off the property. Put it on the table!
I'd like to know that, too. Don't worry. Your brother smiles. He wouldn't operate a machine without reading the instructions. He's excellent at it, isn't he?
-They're not... -We're on a school trip. Right, because we're school kids. The sawmill is not a safe place for children. And I should know, I run it.
I am the boss. Where was I? Yes. The reason the whole town will never forget your parents. They burned it down.
Then come with me. - I'll take your bag. - I can manage. It's not heavy. All my belongings are in it, but it's not heavy. And you have to carry it right, or it will open.
- Where is my brooch? - It must be by the scarf. It's not there. It's not in the jewelry box either. Did you take it?
It is not there. Not even in the jewelry box. Did you take it? I was just playing with it. - You shouldn't touch it.
- I am sorry. - She is so beautiful, it could not be otherwise. - You should put the scarf - on the chair. - I did. I looked everywhere. The brooch is nowhere to be found. Give it back, now.
- You should put the scarf - on the chair. - I did. I looked everywhere. The brooch is nowhere to be found. Give it back, now. But I don't have it, Miss Cuthbert.
If I don't confess, you'll send me back? Admit what you've done. Then may I stay here in Green Gables? Did you take the brooch or not? I lost it.
Did you take the brooch or not? I lost it. I was playing Lady Cordelia and went outside with the brooch. As I was getting water from the fountain, I bent down and it fell in. I heard it splash as it disappeared into the depths.
Jasper... You're gonna love it. Give it a minute. They'll figure it out, - if we take the still. - We don't need it.
And if she were here, the clans might have listened to her. But considering that there is no commander to lead us... there will be war. What are you doing? I know you have the flame. - I know Octavia gave it to you.
That leaves us 90 minutes to complete a six-hour preflight check, pick up the oxygen generator from the lighthouse, convert a two-person cockpit into an eight-person one, and load the hold with enough supplies to keep us from starving in space until the algae starts to thrive. I thought you said it was going to be hard. This isn't the hard part. Becca designed her rocket to dock with Polaris, not the Ark. That means I have to steer it into the hangar bay in the ring.
Understood. - Is the equipment packed? - Almost, yes. Hurry up! He wants it on the roof in five minutes.
- I'm already looking. Oh, maybe that. Okay, "Find the current defendant using..." Yeah, no, I need the number. - Okay, I found it!
And we don't want it to spread any further. Of course not, but it's major surgery, so... Yeah, I can handle it. I'm fine. I want the next surgery as soon as you can do it.
Why don't you get some rest? I woke up hours ago, feeling great. I'll take that for you. So I watched the news, did some laundry. Then I noticed the pantry wasn't cleaned up, so I rearranged it.
You're gonna make my lasagna. No, mom. I can't, uh... I can't... It's your thing. I don't know how to make it.
You see? This is what happens when you carry around the past. The past is dead. Let it go. Exchange it for the present, that's the only way you can be happy.
Karel didn't mean you should have a garage sale. It was meant more spiritually. That we shouldn't look at the past because it weighs down our present. We spend so much time trying to solve old problems that we forget about what is right and important now. You have to let go of the past because it doesn't exist.
We have everything to go home. Azrael's blade. Are you sure? I am. If we could stop your brother from drinking, he could show us where he hides it...
The point is, despite everything, she went to great lengths to help him. Yes, she's right about that. The doctor saw a side of me that I hid because it was, well, scary. But she accepted me anyway and helped me overcome problems that I thought were insurmountable. I appreciate that statement and I will add it to the notes.
Right, Dani? Of course. We're just delaying the announcement of your promotion. I see. Danielle, you've been dangling the shareholder position under my nose for three years and you've always snatched it away.
- This way I won't have to stick the needle in over and over again. We have to drain the fluid from his brain or we will lose him. If you move the needle even a little, - he's as good as dead anyway. - I get it. Thank you very much. Okay, you put it in.
Hey, is that Liam? - Little Liam with the religious parents? - He is. I saw his name on the board and couldn't believe it. How did you get approval? I didn't need it.
They're needed in the OR. What do you think Wilson and... Edwards were standing around waiting for an opportunity to shine? No. - They took it.
I looked up and... suddenly it was as if the whole of nature had come to life. Frogs came out of the ground. Salamanders came out of the lake. It seemed like the birds were fleeing from something. And then a big toad came and ate it right from my hand.
Do you have two minutes? I'm stuck in a church. Shoot. I know right now this thing is between us. Can we just forget about her for a second?
He didn't see shit, because... I took you upstairs... took your shoes off... tucked you in... and let you sleep there alone. - Let me touch your hand. - No. I want to show you that nothing is happening. I'll touch it and let go.
Then we vote on them. If the majority is in favor...then the decision is made. Okay? You want to write it down? We ration food, divide it equally.
I have never held a man's hand before. I've always wanted to... but you know how men are. I thought he was going to kill me, so I made a promise to myself that if I survived, I would. I would hold a man's hand. I would hold it...walk down the street and not give a shit what anybody else thought.
- I guess I'm kind of a colleague, too. But they're terrible, man. We wrote for a TV series. - Shitty series. - Shitty series. We can't name them or we'll get sued.
Crazy. - Evidence completed. - Concluded. - We finish the evidence. - We finish it.
You're wearing my jacket? Yes! We're twins! No, we can't! I asked you where you got it, you told me.
They never realize when they are in the presence.... of true power. Do I get an amen? Power can be lost, lost for centuries, and then turn up in the most unlikely places. But in the end... power can never be hidden. Not for those who deserve to control it.
Yes, demonic symbols. Each sigil works a different kind of killing spell. Sigils are usually written down in occult texts, not burned into a person's skin. Yes, because as soon as you access a sigil, it burns up.
His ability to take human form. Not only that. It would disguise itself as someone familiar, someone close. In the case of the Pilgrims, it was the father of the dead girl Mercy Bradford, Captain William Bradford. Eventually, they subdued the creature, buried it in an underground chamber, and sealed it with an enchanted rock.
From the guy? Simple gunshot wound, open and shut. I spent the rest of the morning analyzing the drug from the club. - And by analyze, you mean? - I broke it down into its basic components, reverse-engineered it, and ran a field test on quite a few of them.
Brilliant. Right? You want to know where I got the idea? You know what? You should put it in the script.
With good wifi, it's like being there. - No, it isn't. - He has his problems with it. Keep going. - There's a whole world out there. - Yeah, I've seen it.
So, you said there were two men? One had a gun. They forced me into the hallway and started yelling, "Where's the money?". - Nobody even noticed. They said they gave Adam half a million dollars - and they wanted it back.
Wow, look at that! Very nice. Listen. I have to tell you something. I think that you... I have a message for you right now. Whenever you want to hear it, you put it to your ear... Then you can hear me.
I'm losing my mind. Snart and I got along so well because we trusted each other. Have you ever heard of the Holy Lance? The lance could change reality. We broke it into four pieces.
Make way! According to this map, Jesus' blood is somewhere over there. The lance feels the blood. We don't survive out there. Nor can we use it.
What? Come on. - You're all thinking it. - Absolute power corrupts, even with the best of intentions. That's why I tried to destroy it.
Born of blood, destroyed of blood. And what does that mean? We have the lance at last. Let's figure out what to do with it. - Find a way to protect it.
We finally have the lance. Let's think about what to do with it. - Find a way to protect it. - No. You destroy it.
Maybe he's already eaten it. The Legends have the complete lance and we don't have to look for the parts anymore. For me, the glass is always half full.... The idiots are overwhelmed with it. They will hide them or destroy them. And when they do, we will be there. And wait.
Make way! According to this map, Jesus' blood is somewhere over there! The lance feels the blood. We don't survive out there. Nor can we use it.
I know the rifts between us are deep. They may even be insurmountable. But I implore both armies to join forces for this one moment and observe a truce so that the wounded can be recovered from the battlefield. One day, our courage may leave us. We give up friendships and sever the bonds of comradeship. But today is not that day. And if we show our humanity, maybe we can save them.
We must restore time. Even if it doesn't matter, because reality itself is in danger. Maybe not. Last I checked, there was no off switch on the lance. What if... What if they don't know how to use it?
Last time I checked, there was no off switch on the lance. What if... If they don't know how to use it? I must say, well done. I've heard of your skills as a thief, but this is a whole new level. Truly masterful. For one of them to steal them for us.
Star City is my home. I never stop fighting. Sure you will. Kill them. Get rid of that. But I'm taking this mask. I can add it to my collection.
Sara, why do we always get into this situation? Because you're always on the wrong side. Good job, Mick. Now give it to me. Mick, no. You already gave it to him once.
We are having trouble finding this Dr. Rosa. You still don't remember her last name or where you met? I'm trying. When my officers were tracking you, you were heading toward the border. I assume you intended to cross.
- Come on! - I want to hear the music! You're gonna get me in trouble. Everybody knows there are ghosts in the hill. Wait! You'll hear them soon.
Quickly! Put out the fire! Move your ass, Roman! Close the trapdoor. Block it, we must block it!
Thanks, but no thanks. I'm happy the way I am. I don't believe you. You say that only to hide the real reason why you don't take your chance at love. You think you don't deserve it.
I can no longer imagine life without all that. So Tinker Belle was wrong then. That wasn't your happy ending. No, it wasn't. But it gave me hope when I needed it most and that was just as important.
He attracts them, they elude the scatterbrained authorities, they fall in love. I can't imagine why you would want to throw this one away. I would have thought it was your favorite movie. I don't know if it's my favorite movie, but.... it's not exactly The Godfather trilogy, but the DVD was definitely not in my trash can. They broke into my house and found it there.
I think not. Why? Okay, the milk here, does Ryan always buy the same brand? There's a new brand in the fridge since a few days ago. Did you see who put it in there?
Tighter. This is Rachel. Something's come up for me. I need to know what you found, Detective. Ma'am, there's a body here, but we can't identify it yet.
- Why? - It doesn't matter. - What happened to the bar? I'm really excited about the booming regional Long Island wine landscape. Some people are calling it the new Napa.
Max... This is our show. It's started. We have to do the show. People are going to love it.
Lisa asked me to look at the apartment, too. Lisa and I are friends too, right? I know you're friends. - This is a strange neighborhood. - Wait till you see it.
- Yes? I had dinner with Jonathan Franzen. - And he ditched Oprah. - Right. This woman had Oprah on her yacht. And she was jealous of her.
Given how hard the ground was due to the cold, something would have to have been heavy and warm for a long time to leave such an imprint. What's a manhole doing in the middle of the woods? I don't know. Maybe that's why our killer brought a crowbar. Cut through the lock with a blowtorch and used it to open it.
Do yourself a favor, leave before I call the police. You deny knowing Raymond Thorpe? I've never heard that name in my life. Please. I admit, the search of your house revealed no evidence of a connection between you and Thorpe, or perhaps you hid it well.
You know. So I went back and my date was like, "You okay?" And I was all, "Sure." Another round? I'll get it.
You can't depict African Americans with this shade of black. - It hasn't bothered anyone yet. - Have any black people seen it? I've never had any African American guests. So I'm the darkest-skinned person who has seen it, and I find it offensive.
I see. And what do you want, Mary? You've blossomed into a beautiful woman here that others look up to. It's true. It's hard for you to believe in that power inside you. But I can see it. The light shines in you.
My name is not Sam. What are you doing to me? I'm painting flowers on the walls of your ruin. Your necklace... Where is it? I gave it to the man who deserves it.
I paint flowers on the walls of your ruin. Your necklace... Where is it? I gave it to the one who deserves it. I deserve that necklace! I deserve it!
Make sure everything is covered. Like this. -Tell me what to do. -Stay there. His kidney's shot. -I have to get it out. Otherwise he'll die.
I need collateral. Well, okay. Here are my house keys. You can take care of the mail and the cat. What do I feed them to?
This. I want you to go back to work on the ranch. Dad, we've been through this. I know you want your own ranch. If you get the chance, I want you to take it.
Honey, it's going to look so great on our front porch. I can't believe you did that. It was nothing. I made a few phone calls, drove half a day... Had Campari and haggled with a pushy gay landlord, Took the swing apart, shipped it in a van, ran out of gas in the desert, got harassed by a windy State Trooper and drove back with a nasty migraine.
- Here you go. - Busy today, sir. I assume you have a reservation? Yes. My wife made them.
But it must be favorable. Make an offer. In return for peace, as compensation for the loss of Eoferwic, I offer you a fortress. - At Dunholm. - Kjartan is there. Yes. We'll join forces and take it.
Holy cow! - Doesn't look good. - What happened? This guy stuck a toothbrush up his butt. I have to remove it.
Not really. Today, a lot of things end up where they don't belong. I'm sorry, Carol. He'll be all right. I'll get her out somehow.
You know what? Apparently, I'm not the only one who can do magic around here. Did you just make that up? No, I used to say it to my wife years ago, and then we started having this hard time right now. You marked your card and put it in the deck, didn't you?
I don't want to continue hosting this show. But I have an idea. When I proposed my travel show, you declined because I'm unknown. And I get that, you're right. But let's do it together.
Maybe not all the way out, but by the door. And when we're together... it's great. It feels so good. There's this energy. I felt it after the Chef Jeff dinner and tonight.
I must not be late. - Don't move. - No. The ferry. I can't miss it.
Hopefully it's true. It's a comforting thought, isn't it? And the bank manager, who happens to be my uncle, said the Cuthberts are poor. Snow is supposed to be a sign of God's forgiveness and.... By covering the barren and cold earth, making it more beautiful.
Did I say something wrong? We can't keep Jerry. The sale of the horse should cover part of his salary. But who's going to run the farm? We don't even know if we can keep it yet.
I don't like these budget cuts any more than you do, but I want you to know, I am in there with you. I've cut my spending. All the executives are flying coach. But I want you to know that your voices are being heard. So not only is my door always open to you, I've actually removed it.
I've been sick a long time, Sarah. Oh, my God. Why didn't you tell us? Cosima's working on a treatment. She's testing it on herself right now.
There was only one part missing, so to speak. We needed a wiping system to keep the glass clean. Richard and the team wanted to work with time-lapse. CAMERA TECHNICIAN We should design something for them. This is a little dirty. We designed a magnetic arm that pulls a wiper around the glass to keep it clean for a very long time.
I'm zooming in on Hawaii. As you can see, it's 2.6 °C warmer than it should be at this time of year. If you look at some of the other hotspots around the world, it's 6.3 °C, 2.8 °C, 4.5 °C warmer than normal. There's a heat wave moving across the planet, and where it's coming in, the corals are dying. Now we have a small window of opportunity to capture coral bleaching and make it known everywhere.
He knows how long it takes for the body to break down the substance. He advises us. He is the most important specialist. The ARD documentary about the Russian whistleblowers... What did you think when you heard the allegations? The documentary was so inflammatory that they were afraid to air it while the whistleblowers were in Russia.
The analysis is done on the basis of the A sample. The way the sample is taken, the reliability of the sample, the division between A and B samples.... The system is very safe. The lids of the bottles are designed in such a way that they have to be destroyed if you want to open them. In the laboratory there is a device to open the A sample. This is the only way to open it.
The Russians and the Chinese report the same thing. Report what? What is inactive? The pyramid. We are keeping them under surveillance.
Because they still offer the deal and ... And I'm the only one left. Tell them it's flattering, but don't do it. What's consent supposed to mean? You have to ask for our help and want it, and know that you will then be ours.
And from now on ... two airplanes! One for me and one for my enchanting assistant ... Erica! Say "hello" to your folks at home, Erica, and let me through the door. Bill, get out of the pyramid now! I can't open it.
What's going on? 3614, this opens the door, but I can't see the digits. One minute, 20. - What's the problem? - Combination lock. The Sonic will only calculate the number, but I have to enter it.
This show is the shit! Looks like punks have invaded our studio. -You don't like my show? -Yeah. The biggest bullshit! -You think it's tacky. -Aw!
Hello? Wally's Mattress Store. You want to return the mattress? Because of the lifetime warranty? You broke it during sex?
I told you. Once you are dead, I can channel your powers and use this sword to open a portal. I have helped you. It's the only way. The spider... You brought it here.
It is the only way. The spider... You brought it here. You couldn't kill me yourself. Unfortunately, you were much stronger than I expected. And even though I created it, controlling it is something else entirely.
These are Lost Boys. Where are we? Neverland. Kill them! Where's a giant can of bug spray when you need it?
I think so. Ms. Swan... where's Gideon? Did the beast kill him? That beast was his pet. He brought it here to kill me.
The Hancocks are absolutely off limits. Why? That's the independent. We can go after whoever we want. This newspaper is independent of Winchester because its founders fund it, the Hancocks.
Some kind of test? Not for you, but maybe for me. All right, I'm confused, but you know what this fixes? The past always catches up with us, doesn't it? Past, present and future are a disaster no matter how you slice it.
No. No one came to see you who wanted to get in? -No. -Your key card, where is it now? I don't know. I can't find it.
They certainly don't expect us to come to them. The hunted becomes the hunter? Ingenious. That's the tagline of six of my favorite movies. I made a list of the latest Galra attacks and analyzed them for similarities and differences.
-So... Where are the Galra? Their closest base is there, on the planet Taujeer. Then we have our destination. You should rest. Tomorrow we'll hunt down the Galra fleet and take them out.
How do you keep a planet from going off the rails? -By patching it up! -What do you mean? The green lion's new weapon makes vegetation grow. If you point it at the cracks in the planet, the vines work like ropes.
Vrepit sa! Vrepit sa! Prepare my escape pod. -They're crashing into the ark. -They're ramming it!
Can you confirm his statement? Is this blade really his? I don't know. Shiro, you know me. I didn't steal it.
-Get out of there. We are leaving. You're not leaving with that blade! It's not yours! -You couldn't awaken her.
I paid... Uh... I'd better not say anything. There were... Some payments were large. If you, Miss Maclaine, know of any evidence of the existence of aliens, let me know and I'll make it public, but I'm skeptical.
A suppression trial went back to the lower court. - The stalemate in the court increases the chaos. - Do you read the papers? Billy wrote something about it three days ago. Declaration of war? Underwood hasn't mentioned it in weeks.
I checked with Seth Grayson about Lisa Williams. Why did you think that was appropriate? - You should drop the story. - Is it a story? No one is writing it.
No, I mean for Usher. The body is remarkably well preserved, except for the extremities...they're frozen. But the teeth are intact. Our contacts in Antarctica are cooperating. The body will be there in 12 hours. - I'll send it over when...
- You have to confess... - that you killed Zoe Barnes. - Listen to me first. - You're the best bet. - You were desperate, drunk. We'll make up a story and leak it.
Let the record show that the witness answered in the affirmative. Mr. President, thank you for being here. I hope we can clear some things up today. Go ahead. Be as long or as short as you like. If you have written testimony...we will include it afterwards and put it in the record.
- Never mind. You should have talked to me. Instead of making decisions on the fly. I didn't. I created this confusion to take advantage of it.
Where's my gun? Here you go. What guarantees do I have? I gave you the gun back. But why did you give it to him?
Look there, what do we see? The queen of spades is gone! Where could it be? In Frank's pocket. I saw you put it in.
I can wait another 79. No, Dad. You're too nice. This is your bachelor party, not yours! You're ruining the whole night. You ruined it when you planned it.
- Okay, okay. My passport's inside. Wait, this guy... he's got my bag. Nice try picking my pocket. I see you've already recolored it.
Pam, you are rude. You're disrespectful. And you take another bite? ! Put the fork down! Put it down!
Let's get one thing straight, you're dragging you down, not me. It's snowing. I had a snow cannon set up. Good thing Liam didn't cancel it.
You might even catch a glimpse of the Christmas bells. Bell. What bells? Robert is not giving my toast. - Cyrus. - I'm holding it.
The idea is probably not so good. - Why not? - Well, first of all, you insulted Beck on the balcony. And second, you've been an ass all day. Robert holds it.
We are all battered. And our hearts are broken. But we are a fighting nation. That's what we do. We stand up. We keep going. We fight. We face things bigger than us with dignity and courage. And we ask for help when we need it.
We think he shot the guy. In a warehouse they owned together. Watson sent me a message from the crime scene. Police have been searching for hours, but still can't find a murder weapon. If we don't find it, a jury might believe his story that "some black guy" killed his partner and then fled.
- She was my protégé. It was only a matter of time before she was out of my life. I'm just saying. She's a detective now, Watson, so she's one of us. She needs our help, we give it to her.
How sure are we that this is our husband? Mrs. Durning said she saw him when she left the house right before her husband's heart attack. She also remembered him carrying a briefcase. I bet that contained a hypodermic needle and whatever else he needed to break into the Durnings' house. Local police are passing the sketch around, but we're going to personally take it to the morgue in Paramus, see if anyone there saw this guy contact the coroner who overlooked the murder.
Or whether you should just give up. So what should I do? "Okay, I'll try to make it." I knew this could be the last time I saw him. It was hard to know how.... How to be affectionate with someone you hadn't been for 30 years. So I just... I kissed my hand and pressed it to his forehead, and just felt for this dying man, you know?
Out of town. I'll give you my card. Don't bother. I'll just lose it anyway. No, take it anyway.
Yes, aren't they wonderful? Yes. Did you kill them all? Taxidermy is the diminishing art with faded species. Darwin would never have gotten a place on the Beagle if he hadn't known about taxidermy. He learned it from a freed slave when he was studying medicine in Edinburgh.
That's how we are. I overdo it and you act without my consent. That's our relationship. We can end it. Or we can just accept it.
Is something wrong? Because of my dead wife? No, but... Memories are often exaggerated. In memory, everything seems better than it was. You love breast milk when you're a baby, but when you drink it as an adult, it's nothing special.
That's why we're such a good team. Fuck it. If I go down, you go down. Put the gun away. You'll never use it anyway.
Vilma is fine, for sure. Fine. Yes. I took a blood sample that day. You stole it from a defenseless human.
Why? -I wonder why I'm here. -Really? -Really? -I guess I made a name for myself bouncing around campus. And Perry is the most promising student in my seminar. His last term paper impressed me so much, he's presenting it to my philosophy class.
I can't get it to work. It's supposed to be for the greatest possible benefit. If I see someone without shoes, I'll give them mine. Nobody wants Swedish shoes! If you have pizza, give it to the hungry.
I will not do that. Of course you won't. You bitch. Telling my story might help some viewers. But it's my story. And I don't have to tell it.
I mean, silence? That's crazy. What about the music, right? Well, there will be music. You'll be able to hear it on radio headphones.
In Denmark, it's called "hygge." It's about living in the moment, making the ordinary extraordinary and the normal special. When we take that into account, we are more open with each other. We become much closer to each other. This creates community in interesting ways. For example, in the kitchen. We've made it inviting, with a large table and objects on it that imprint themselves on the haptic memory.
Get a HAZMAT team in here right away. I think he was given something toxic. What? Is it radiation? The past is never where you think you left it.
Wait, you were working while I was out? No. I was a very fickle decorator. I ordered and then turned down new carpet, ceiling molding, and a new bathtub. You're right on time to pick out a new wallpaper for your bedroom. Since you're going to send it back anyway, just surprise me.
Apparently she is the perfect mix in terms of origin, quality and legend. She's a 1957 Carfax Desperado, a year of manufacture that's already being called the "Stradivarius of electric guitars", they fetch up to a million dollars on the collector market, and that's without a famous pedigree. Add to that the fact that it was apparently lost during Mr. Clapton's 1971 tour.... Then you have a piece of rock history worth killing for. And we're sure our shooter is the one who took it from Azoff's girlfriend's house?
What kind of crazy person would do that? Hypothetically? You put us in touch with him, and I'm sure the DA would be very grateful. So where's the guitar now? My husband couldn't find it.
Hypothetical? You put us in touch with him, and I'm sure the prosecutor would be very grateful. So where's the guitar now? My husband couldn't find it. Wait, you mean he didn't take it from Azoff's house?
How the hell did he get the guitar? We didn't hear the whole recording he heard. Wolf's hit man told us that Azoff told him the location of the guitar before he died. That wasn't on the tape we all heard. So Cosmo must have erased that part before he sent it to the police, then stole the guitar before Vennek could get it.
-I could stay here all night. Because you're the boss and you don't have to get up early. Future or past. We all have to decide at some point which direction to look. Whether to hang on to the past, stick with what we already know, or leave it behind and look to the future.
-Today evening. It's a little early, but I can't wait for him to.... Doesn't matter. I'll ask Sara if I can go to the bank and withdraw money for the trip. Did you get Mario's permission? Yes, I got it months ago.
-There are more fish in the sea. -Excuse me? Their relationship was at an end. She had no future. Pablo wanted to leave you, but he didn't dare.
When I was at a loss, I got a tip. Someone saw you here. Is that true? We had a chance, Alba. And she destroyed it.
I am not satisfied with my performance. The next candidate is Rafael Picolo, an award-winning surfer from São Paolo, Brazil. São Paolo is in the house! And he believes his surfing talent will be an advantage in beating the beast. No matter how high the wave is, I can tame it.
You're being rude, and I want to teach you a lesson." "I don't even want the bag." "I'm buying it, though, because I have enough money. And not only that. This bag is for me, and I want you to wrap it."
I walked out of the store full of pride. I walked out of the store with dignity. When I got to the car, I was like, "Yes!" I drove to the nearest Bloomingdale's to exchange the bag. I didn't want it, but I had taught her a lesson. That's all that matters!
You may remember my TV show, Cristela. Thank you. I, uh... - I liked the show and... - Bring it back!
Let's get this convoy moving, soldiers. Daddy! Isaac? Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan, where the state government has authorized Reiden Global to quarantine children under twelve. CEO of Reiden Global, Leanne Ducovny, defended the action, comparing it to the country's own history of military service as a civic duty.
So, I kind of understand the other stuff, but why the lollipops? Oh, they're for me. For later. Let me get some tranquilizers. When I was 14, Jamie heard me on the phone with a friend, about throwing a beer party in the woods. She offered to host it instead.
- It's me, Jackson. You, your lions and your lovely little friend have been following me. You have something that belongs to me. The disk. Consider it a gift.
Let me tell you, they have not. The owner of the pussy may have given you the impression that she has defeated the pussy, but she is alive and well, my friends. Every time someone says that, I ask, "Do you actually understand how impressive a vagina is? Do you understand how strong it is?" That's why men have always wanted to suppress them.
Are we still talking about the spoon? It's nice that you're taking a serious interest in Amy's work. So, don't get me wrong, neurobiology is nothing more than the science of some gray matter. But, you know, when you combine it with physics, well, gas up the Ford, Martha! We're going for a ride.
I can hear your face talking, so I guess we're even. Well, either you blow your nose or you teach her "Oh the doo dah day." All right. All right. You want me to blow my nose? Well, I'll blow it.
After a stay in England, he returned to Hollywood. When I was about 25 years old in London, a whole series of circumstances led to me eventually being completely bankrupt. I could have asked my father or friends for help. But like gamblers, I'm convinced that you can't do anything about a run of bad luck. You just have to ride it out.
He had to create something, not a documentary representation, but a representation of reality à la John Ford. The question of whether to show the film as Ford had made it went through the entire chain of command until finally Roosevelt saw the film. He gave me a small roll of film and said.... VOICE OF ROBERT PARRISH "Don't look at it and don't put it in the film until I say so." Of course, I looked at it as soon as I came out of the editing room. He found a shot, and we'll never know if he shot it on location or if he got the shot somewhere else, but it was a shot of President Roosevelt's son.
Close enough to touch, yet so far away. 25 documentaries were nominated. Four of them won Oscars. Battle for Midway and Prelude to War were among the winners. In his speech, Mellett assured the studios that the government will not insert propaganda into their films. This government is at war to save and preserve democracy. Not to destroy it.
Where are you? The party started an hour ago. I told the kids you were coming. And it would be really uncool if you didn't show up. And would you please lose the wig? Leave it at home.
Or do I stay with Abby while Heather has my baby? I can't answer that question. Shit! That's what Siri said. I can't answer it because the question is wrong.
As a partner. Partner? I want a share of the gross revenue. That's impossible. - Mary Pickford got it from Zukor in 1916.
- According to Dell, this was the 20th attempt. This is art for art's sake. I see you're still wearing the watch. - I need to know what time it is. Give it to my daughter so she doesn't spend all night with your German pervert!
No wonder you were afraid of the rehearsals. Again! Again! Again! Again! It can't be that hard. You take a peanut, put it in your mouth and chew.
Once more! Again! Again! Again! It can't be that hard. You take a peanut, put it in your mouth and chew. Then you take another peanut, put it in your mouth and chew, just like a normal person.
- Oh, Dick. I'm glad to see you. I wanted to talk to you... Do you know where the bathroom is? No. I'll find it.
This is his arm. So it can't be his belt. It just looks like it, but actually you have to.... There's an app. You point it at the stars and then you get exactly...
Let me do it. If I make it, you benefit from it. If I screw up, I'm a dead man. Rules are rules, and you broke them. I saw an opportunity and I took it.
The best source of sperm. At least for me. My porn name is Jax Slayher. I slice them up. I just... I slice the pussy and pound it, finish it off and....
I started drinking. I don't know why, but it helps. You guys are really great. Thank you. I have had my period for two weeks because I tried to skip it this month.
Maybe we still have a chance. Maybe he wants to work things out." But then he read my message at exactly 11:11 and didn't reply. Well... He retweeted three minutes ago and 27 seconds ago and one minute ago, three minutes ago, five minutes ago. When you don't reply to my message and I see you read it, it hurts.
Apparently, they were never very close. That changed earlier this year. Carter's CMT went from bad to worse. The disease is inherited, and symptoms follow a similar course in many families. No one on his mother's side had it, so Carter turned to his paternal grandfather to find out what to expect.
So far away, in fact, that I haven't managed to recreate it with my own arms. Maybe you need a stronger arm. After a youth spent on the cricket field and two decades of training in martial arts, my arm strength is slightly above average. This tropical fruit is filled with a synthetic blood that I mixed myself. And I'm going to use it... with a candlepin bowling ball that is almost the size and weight of the marble award that was used.
All right, let's talk about something you definitely don't have: an alibi for the night of the murders. Because you were in Carter's apartment. He and Fred told you things you didn't want to hear, so you took Carter's award off the shelf and killed them with it. It's only a matter of time before we find them.
The sins of said athlete will be swept under the rug by his promoters. I'm sure Mr. Fontino's family will enjoy the blood money he earns once Houston Spivey's name is in the contract. The lab says the blood in Fontino's trunk matches the victims. And he knew about the murder weapon. He knew about it, but he couldn't provide it, could he?
I'm sure Mr. Fontino's family will enjoy the blood money he'll make once Houston Spivey's name is in the contract. The lab says the blood in Fontino's trunk matches the victims. And he knew about the murder weapon. He knew about it, but he couldn't provide it, could he? He said he threw it off the Staten Island ferry.
After all, Fontino was a pitcher in college. Yes, he was. That was 45 years ago. Now he's a retiree with herniated discs and arthritis in both hands. I mean, he'd have trouble lifting the murder weapon over his head, let alone swinging it hard enough to send blood flying to the other end of the room.
But also because Kennedy's hair fit much better than Nixon's. So I went to the lunchroom, and I told every kid in line, "Nixon wants to make Saturday a school day." The mock election was held, and to the surprise of the local newspaper, Democrat John Kennedy won that election handily. For the first time, I understood the value of disinformation. I have never practiced it since.
The what? -In the movie I Walked with a Zombie. -The zombie title character. I'm not a fucking... I'm Lieutenant Cyril Figgis, LAPD, you walking saps! -I showed you my badge! -And if you show it to me again....
When he asked you to frame a detective for pointing the gun at you, you did that. I think I need to talk to a lawyer. That's an option. Or you could realize we're throwing you a lifeline. Grab it.
-Shall I show you? You have to pull it towards you, not away from you. Otherwise you'll just get crap and lose control of the carrot. Pull it towards you. Then turn it and continue on the other side.
One day, when he was at work, I just flew home. What? Without saying anything? But you did talk to each other afterwards? I've tried to write an email to him a hundred times, but.... But every time I try to send it, I think that maybe... Maybe it would be best if we weren't together.
A great maneuver by Timo Bernhard in the #17 Porsche! So Mark Webber's car is in the lead. I wanted to take the lead early. The three Audis were fighting hard. Once I took the lead, I didn't want to give it up again.
I think it's time for a raise. Easy, tiger. Mike, seriously, I thought you were busy with this pro bono case? Donna said you needed my help, so I gave it to you.
Justice for Catherine Cesnik and Joyce Malecki, is run by Abbie Fitzgerald and myself as administrators. This site is for the purpose of gathering information, from anyone who might know something about what happened to Sister Cathy. We have journalists here, law enforcement officers, retired police officers. People can send us private messages. PLEASE PM, IF YOU If I have a question on this page, all we have to do is post it and get lots of answers.
"I don't want to." And Maskell spoke encouragement to him. I was sitting across the table from him, and he had a gun. And he takes the bullets out, one by one. And he says that my father, if he ever found out that I was lurking around.... And he took the gun, he put it to my temple he pulled the trigger and he said that's what he does then but he leaves the bullets in.
So she went to Muhly's. She said she wanted to buy an engagement gift. When they searched the cart, they didn't find a gift. It didn't show up. At Christmas after Sister Cesnik's disappearance, Ed gave me this necklace, among other things. He snuck up behind me and put it around my neck.
And I thought to myself, what's with the wedding bell when we had been married for over a year, almost two. He hadn't bought it for me. It was as if it was for another person, only I got it. I put it in my jewelry box and never wore it. I don't know why I kept it.
It was like it was for another person, except I got it. I put it in my jewelry box and never wore it. I don't know why I kept it. I mean... I just forgot about it.
I put them in my jewelry box and never wore them. I don't know why I kept it. I mean... I just forgot about it. Debbie's aunt gave us the necklace, told us to keep it.
I think I'm just looking for answers, you know? Thanks, Pete. Bye. He's 85, the conversation was pretty muddled, except when Gerry's name came up. He repeated the story over and over again. I think he told it so many times, had to tell it, that it was....
The entire mall was searched by investigators at the time. They wanted to find a store where she might have been. There was no indication... BALTIMORE DISTRICT POLICE ...to that purchase. Maybe she had paid cash they just didn't find anything, but they could never conclusively determine if she had actually made that purchase. I saw the necklace for the first time yesterday. And looking at it, the bell would be a wedding symbol, which makes sense since we had gotten engaged the week before.
She thinks that this necklace has meaning, and she wonders if you got the necklace from Sister Cathy that night. None of this means anything to me. Did you meet Sister Cathy that night? No. Now, if one were to think that this was the necklace Sister Cathy bought when she disappeared and you gave it to your first wife, do you understand why one would become suspicious?
This woman died because she wanted to help stop what was happening there. And because the... JUSTICE ...Justice for Cathy group, because Cathy's sister has the courage to join in, ask questions, and find her own peace I too am taking another step toward that closure where I can say it's good. The truth remains, no matter how deeply you bury it.
It's a shame. Hey! Sheriff, do you really think Rob and I would steal those hats off our own children's sweet little heads? Besides, you've been trying to buy our house ever since you got here, you pompous mustache twirler! I'd rather see the boardwalk destroyed than sold to you!
Mr. Holdout. You remember the ridiculously long name of a long-dead parrot and every other detail about the pirates, but you have forgotten a saying that might have made you suspicious. You were also surprised that Brenda and Tommie had disappeared, but not surprised that the salt pearl had been stolen. And when we made a noise in the secret passage, you all looked at the picture, while the police, when we made noises in their wall, assumed that the noise came from outside. Wait, where were you? You even said to Mr. Monkfish when he denounced you that you would rather see the boardwalk destroyed than sell it to him.
She'll probably fall asleep soon. It's already late for her. This bag... is beautiful. It's a designer bag. Daddy bought it for me in Paris.
It's already late for them. This bag... is beautiful. It's a designer bag. Daddy bought it for me in Paris. You can have it.
Thanks. I probably won't make it, but.... Don't forget to think positive. There's an emergency chocolate bar around here somewhere. If you find it, it's yours.
There you have it. We are the yerba mate tea bags steaming on the counter of American pop culture. But who are we as individuals? Do you mind if I tell my story? See the stage, use it.
- Done. - And then a... potentially non-existent disrespect and go straight to level 7. What the hell are you talking about? Panic, sadness, self-hatred, spite, justification, self-hatred again, and anger. I refer to them as the 7 stages of Louis.
But that also means with everything you get, they know it came from me. Except you just told me to fuck off, in front of all your buddies. And they saw that you meant it. That's why you came to me at the prison. Now you got my back. And I suggest you use it.
Honestly, I do mind. Excuse me, Stephanie, I'm talking to you. It doesn't matter what year you are. I'm the director of associates. If I give you an assignment, you do it.
This, this, and this. - Katie... - Nope. New ideas for fall color? I'm still working on that. It's like I see her mentally in the corner of my eye, but when I turn my head, she's gone.
Now the first guy in college with a British accent gets it. So thank you for that. You know what else is missing? Your penguin necklace. I lost it on Tuesday, and I really, really miss it.
That was really deep, man. Okay. Here's what I'm gonna do. I did to Paige what Julia did to me. And that was very bad. I'm going to make it up to her by finding her necklace and giving it to her at the prom.
I trust you on that. Look here, Agent Penguin. Oh, honey, look. - How did Zahid get your number? - I gave it to him in case of emergency.
Look here, Agent Penguin. Oh, honey, look. - How did Zahid get your number? - I gave it to him in case of emergency. But he only uses it to send me selfies.
Enjoy yourselves. - Okay. - Have fun. Here we go. Okay, Paige lost her necklace on Tuesday. If I retrace her steps, I'll find it.
Camp Firewood. I could have destroyed it ten years ago, but I didn't and have regretted it ever since. Help me settle an old score. What do you think, Mr. President? The fact is, in my last year in office, I stole a nuclear weapon and buried it under Camp Firewood, in a secret bunker that I financed with black money and where my elite private team works.
We are inexorably approaching noon. Hello, noon! The ball is in 510 minutes, so it's time for decorations. So let's meet in the main square for some happy crafting. Take a handful of hay, dip it in the paint, and stick it to one of the sticks.
I thought your family had disappeared. If that's a polite way of saying "hated, burned, and driven from their ancestral lands".... Then you know magic. And finding a story in our past doesn't mean it originated here. The smartest, most clever of our mages know that time is not absolute, that it is possible to hear stories from the future. So you think there is someone sleeping under the city who can save it, - and you are here to await him.
I have to pay 1,000,000 yen every month, right? What are you talking about? That's what it said in the invitation. Can you show me the invitation? I don't have it.
The bland routine of a woman working in a café. The incoherent conversations between her and her bedridden mother. Even on the last page of the novel, we don't learn the names of the characters. However, what remained with each of us who read it is an undeniable emotion. Although I am an author myself, I cannot describe it well.
So, here it is. Quietly. Cat? Here. We took her because we thought she was yours.
Cat? Here. We took her because we thought she was yours. Yes, that's our cat. Minami must have been protecting her.
A fresh start. Hi, Sam. This is my sweat jacket. You're wearing my sweat jacket. I got cold in your closet. So I put it on.
-Paladins, do you read me? -Yeah, what's going on? Heavy artillery fire. We need air support. I see them and I'll take them out.
I'm gonna miss you, buddy. Rosa? Not what I expected. But I like it. Yes, on Altea we wear that color in honor of our fallen warriors. I wear it in honor of the old paladins.
-Then they falsify the measurements. -Only the Galra can access them. Activate the heat sensors and fire around the anomaly. Why? We'll shoot it down!
That was a compliment. You are wonderful under the behemoth. Bye! The bar is ten minutes away. Why don't you go pick it up?
You are certainly the whitest everywhere. - We'll be open in five minutes. - I just want to pick up a credit card. The name is Elsa Gardner. I know that sounds like I'm an ass, but I'm only allowed to give it to the owner.
Don't. I need your permission to jump. Get the frak out of here. Not until I have your permission. Fine, you got it.
Technique, feeling. Everything except discipline. As a jumper, he was so disrespectful ... to the sport that I'm afraid he's the same as a coach. Just no pressure. Where's my jacket when I need it?
Time for the restroom. This is the common area. Good for relaxing. You can see I'm set up for a long stay. The aquaponics system cleans the air and keeps it fresh.
You are a man who sees the world as if through a keyhole. You have spent your life trying to enlarge it. To see more, to know more. Now that you hear that it can be magnified, in ways you can't imagine, do you reject that possibility? I reject it because I don't believe in fairy tales, about chakras or energy, or the power of belief.
Not forever? We are not prophets. When are you going to tell me what we are? Heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical threats. We wizards protect it from mystical threats.
After a world beyond time, because time enslaves us. Time is a humiliation. Death is a humiliation. Doctor, we don't want to rule this world. We want to save it.
"We came across ruins of an ancient city. Everything was full of gold, there were streets, temples, ancient symbols. What, like El Dorado? No, gentlemen! No, I call them "Z".
Him I meant. These are... Hi. May I ask when was the last time the paranormal apparition was seen? And if you had to rate it, between a T1 and T5....
These are... Hi. May I ask when was the last time the paranormal apparition was seen? And if you had to rate it, between a T1 and T5.... Garret saw it Tuesday. He peed his pants.
You put all the sticky stuff on the floor. You opened the basement door to scare me. We didn't open the basement door. The basement door is open. - I didn't open it.
Until she dislocated her jaw and ecto-spit on you. Yeah, that got everywhere, by the way. In every crack. But I have to say, even that was kind of incredibly beautiful. I could detect a big ion discharge. I could smell it.
Just a little setback. You know what, guys? I think we can do this. We're going to be the first scientists to prove the existence of the paranormal. All we have to do is find and capture an apparition and put it in a controlled environment.
Oh, no! Yes! I wish we could still do that demonstration. It was really great. I wish I could have seen it, man.
She was really great. I wish I could have seen her, man. - You might get your wish, Patty. - No way. What, you still got it?
The beam would travel back into your body and the atoms would implode. - What! - Holtz, open the trap! Okay. I'll open it on the count of three.
Once the cat is out, it won't go back in! I put cats in sacks all the time. But once it's out, you say, "The cat's out of the bag!" We just want to put the cat back in the bag. The cat was already out of the bag, people lose interest and stuff it back in.
There is always something more exciting. Sheriff in New Mexico has seen a UFO. The crew of the SS Ourang Medan dies under mysterious circumstances. The entire population of Langville, Montana disappears. Does it?
What kind? Mankind flies to the stars, the greatest migration of all time. The greatest story ever. But you don't know the people who read it. But they would read it.
The greatest story ever. But you don't know the people who read it. But they would read it. Or they would have read it. I can't write it anymore.
What do you mean? The outer hatch is jammed. We have to get the hatch open so the reactor cools down or the ship will blow up. How? I have to open it from the outside.
I am ready. Let me know. All right. The hatch won't open. I have to override it.
Or children. I don't kill women and children. I do. I was born with the devil's gift. I hated it all my life, but I grew older and stronger.
I don't kill women and children. I do. I was born with the devil's gift. I hated it all my life, but I got older and stronger. So I started to use it.
Apparently, I'm in this cab for a reason. You ordered it. No, slim brown friend. Love is a wonderful thing. When you find it, the whole world smells of daffodils.
- maxi You're welcome. I'll take you back to where you found me and you can phone home. No, you will generate this tachyon energy your whole life. That's what I feed off of. Without it, I would probably starve.
- He has venraul to you. - We trusted you. That was a mistake. You want the power? Then go get it.
- Bob, is that really my jacket? - Yeah. Oh, my God. Where did you get that? I sleep in it, but I had it cleaned.
I was wrong, put the mask back on! Disgusting! I can't be your friend! Disgusting! Put it back on!
Please don't do it. I do. - Please don't. Let go of me! First you open the straitjacket and put it on, okay?
It follows the decoy transmitter. What are you doing? It doesn't matter. We're isolated. I'm turning it on.
- Clay, can I ask you a question? Do you think my leadership style is too timid, or too cautious? Do you think I'm, um, taking it easy instead of reaching for the stars? I wasn't listening just now, so I didn't understand your question? I can repeat it.
You are bleeding. - That's not my blood. How is he? - He's out of surgery. He's got a bullet in his head and they can't get it out because the brain is swollen.
That's why we're $186 billion. We worry about every bill. And I worry about my rig. My crew lives here. They just rent it.
I would like a room, please. With pleasure. It's a weekday evening, so you're in luck. But the only room available is the Presidential Suite. - We'll take it.
I don't know where they are. But you know where they were. You have no idea how long it took me to get here. The closest loop was in California. Through them I got to the loop in Tokyo.
Let's play a game. Show me your credit card. Hold out your credit card to me. It's just a game. Put it away.
Aguilar was the last person known to possess them. You need to find out where he hid them. I thought I was supposed to be cured here. Violence is a disease, like cancer. And like cancer, we hope one day to control it.
Hold on. Walt Camby's on a plane? Hurry up. This is just like my grandma. I don't want to talk to you through the door. All right. I'll leave it open next time.
I don't want to talk to a cop. Don't think of me as a cop. What did I say? No cops. Turn off the line. Turn it off.
- That's true. I want an OB van with a recording studio downstairs in 2 minutes. Lenny, where are you? Where's my connection to Lenny? I need it.
Just shoot him. I know a better way. Up, up, up. Take off the vest. Put it on him.
I don't know. What did we talk about? You were going to give me your badge. I kind of like my badge. Why do you want it?
The business with the demon rum. And that no one should control the lives of others. If you controlled the rum trade, you'd be a king. Just not finished with Albert White. But how will you hold on to power if you own it?
I am not a terrorist. - Aren't you? I disposed of the bag, but I didn't know about the bomb. I'm sorry. - Who gave it to you?
- Aren't you? I disposed of the bag, but I didn't know about the bomb. I'm sorry. - Who gave it to you? I stole it.
That's how he earns his money. - Hey! You don't judge me. They're RAPID cops, Karen. The bomb was meant for the National Party. To plant on a mosque?
Tell me your name. Tull. Love is a lie. It is a trick played by the cruel to the foolish and the weak. Forget them.
- What did he say? - It's okay. - No, I'm not going to put up with this. - Sure you will. Watch your tongue or I'll rip it out.
The bridge is wobbling. Of course it's shaking. Just shut up! Did you see that? I never took it off.
What is it? Chases make me hungry. OK, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, if this is really you, I have a few questions. This time we deserve the truth. You deserve it.
Do you have a make-up case with you? I never leave the house without it. I got a new one yesterday. It's magic. This little box is the secret of my success. Almost anyone can use it, but no one knows this particular shade of red.
I'm good at getting new designers started. Seriously? I don't know, I thought what if you hated them? If you thought I sucked? I wanted to earn your approval. I didn't want to be awarded it.
It's not that. You miss her. Don't you? The darkness. What it brought out in you.
He knows the way. And what about the Sphinx? Have you forgotten? Sphinx? Seth captured her to guard his fire.
That was your test. You did not test him. I gave Osiris the crown of Egypt. And when the time came, he did not insist on his power. He gave it willingly.
When you're ready, put them back in the pile. Don't do anything stupid. Keep aiming at me. Very good, Earl. I couldn't possibly know your card because I couldn't see it.
You're coming with me. Come on. Three days. The gun! Give it to him.
They say the nightmares never go away. Do the nightmares often deprive you of sleep, Mr. Faraday? Put on pants if you're going to fight. Bogue's coming up from the south. He'll probably attack from above. But we'll lure them into town, where the shooting gallery awaits.
For me, she is the love of my life. She is very direct and never overshoots the mark. - Easy now. Put the gun away, son. Her name is Ethel. - Put it away.
Clamp the leg. Stop the bleeding. Find us some ammo. You did good. We are giants. Brought to Earth to rid it of evil and preserve all that is good.
Challenged Abraham Brant to a Helena duel by Jesse Kingston, for which we are now gathered. Take care of my boy if I lose. We'll do that. Gentlemen, step forward. God made this world, Jesse, and it pains me little to rid it of you.
"The Lord will bless your bread and your water and turn all sickness away from you." God calls you to conquer your fear. Release your faith. The serpent is the darkness in your souls. Your fear irritates it.
- Ask them. Are you afraid to step up to the lectern, citizen? - The audience is demanding. - I don't know any fear, boss. We'll ensnare them and elicit plenty of gossip.
This is the beginning of your story: the day they left us. Are you okay? Even though I know where the journey is going, I'm open to it. And I'm enjoying every single moment.
Look. Would you like a crown? Pretty? - Yes. Do you want to wear it?
Pretty? - Yes. Do you want to wear it? - Yes. Shall we put them on you?
We won the battle in Madrid. We will win! Oh yeah? I hate propaganda. I don't care who spreads it.
Look. Troop movements from this morning. Where did you get the map? I drew it. You drew it?
- Here you go. Hasn't shown up yet. Thank you. Throw away a card. Maybe she has it.
To sell the shares. I'm doing all this for you, Alice. For a good start. Five minutes ago, I was a captain. This is no profession for a lady. Time is against you, and you don't respect it.
Your grandma died. I'm signing the ranch over to you and your brother. Remember you were there when you were little? What would I want with a ranch? Anything you want-- except sell it.
Nasty. - Gross. Sorry, folks. The larva of the beast fly is a multicellular parasite. You can remove them quite easily.
Do you understand? Stacey? I'm here. Do you remember where my gun is'? Find it and carry it with you at all times.
(Heavy breathing) (Gasps for air) "How shall we imagine, an exceedingly gracious God, showering down His favors on children whom He loves, scattering evil with His great hand? A God came down to uplift our afflicted race - He came to earth and did not change it."
I'll get it. It is not your place. There is a world outside Jerusalem. Greece, Persia, Egypt. I want to see them.
This is not yours to do. There is still a world outside Jerusalem. Greece, Persia, Egypt. I want to see them. Not just read about them or hear reports from travelers.
I said, "Committed, dammit! We can settle this right now." When I said that, he backed off a little bit. And all the coldness went away from me. I bent down, grabbed the sickle and threw it as far as I could.
She loves you. Hell, I don't need anybody to tell me my wife loves me. Cory, go in the house and find the other saw. Where is it? I said, find it.
Damn, I don't need anyone to tell me my wife loves me. Cory, go in the house and find the other saw. Where is it? I said find it. Find it till you find it.
That I would have liked to laugh lightheartedly and feel good? You're not the only one with wants and needs. But I stood by you, Troy. All my feelings, desires, needs and dreams I have transferred to you. I planted a seed and prayerfully watched over it.
Ok. Label. Do we have scissors in the bag? I don't know, Clark. Believe it or not, I rarely pack them myself.
But that's pretty expensive, isn't it? I'm going to blow up this company... and then invent a whole new one. Now let's take a look at the future. Private aviation. How about making it even more effective?
- All right. What do you need the gun for? Come to us and we'll take care of it. Edward? I, uh, I just need it.
- No, absolutely not. This is self-tanner and my legs are still wet. I can see your vagina. Well, congratulations and you're welcome. You know, I had it tightened in 2010.
- Lord in heaven. - Yes. We were eating sushi once and he tried to speak Japanese to the waitress. I swear there were Spanish words involved. He's going to sell it on.
Clara! Why do you always want to see me off when you're late? My mother is dying again. I have good news. Well, I think it's good.
Well, I think they're good. They printed my story this time. That's the good news? You'd better get on with your real job. - Wait till you read it.
But it is absolutely true. You put it in the tube for half an hour. The melon, not my willy. Half an hour, and you cook it at 120 degrees. At 180 you cook them.
And now? I am there. Take a can now. - I have one. - Put it back.
Put it down now! - Alonso, holster your weapon. They're cops. - Don't. - Drop it!
They're cops. - Don't. - Drop it! - Put the gun down. - Put it down, Castro!
- Don't. - Drop it! - Put the gun down. - Put it down, Castro! - Drop it!
The world has always been broken, so we need good cops. Like you. With all due respect, sir, a good cop... ...should serve and protect. Help the city. Not divide it.
Who are you? Someone who is interested in the same man as you. Really? I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph that belongs to me. Did you find it?
Oh, I don't think you've ever known a woman like me. You know, it's true what they say about little boys. They're born without a natural inclination to share. I didn't steal your hard drive. I borrowed it.
You know, it's true what they say about little boys. They are born without a natural inclination to share. I didn't steal your hard drive. I borrowed it. You'll find it in the glove compartment of your car.
People have courage. I bet your parents taught you that you were special. That you were here for a reason. My parents taught me otherwise... -- dying in the street. For no reason at all. They taught me that distance only makes sense when you force it to.
You can always tell by the Red Flower. They love their Red Flower. The Red Flower doesn't seem very dangerous. True. But let it loose and it kills everything around it.
The Red Flower. I don't have it. You are human, aren't you? It makes you human. You can call in the Red Flower and control it.
It makes you human. You can call in the Red Flower and control it. I was forbidden to get close to the Red Flower. Do you know why? Because whoever possesses it is at the top of the food chain.
You can deceive them, but not me. It was I who saw your future. I saw what you will become. Go ahead, use the Red Flower. Use it against me, as your father once did.
Probably in kindergarten. I was a little obsessed. Dante designed our current image of hell. Our idea of it hasn't changed in the last 700 years. Botticelli painted it, but Dante created the hell we know.
You seem clearer. Yes, so am I. What's your middle name? Yes, it's me. Zobrist is dead, but if there is his plague... then this map is a trail he laid for someone to find.
He is the Dante scholar. The owner of the mask insists on a barrier.... to hold back the visitors. Not even the staff is allowed to open the display case without him. So the mask doesn't belong to the museum at all? No, a private collector bought it from us... and gave it to us as a permanent loan.
- Please, sit down. - I'll explain it to you. - It's not all right. I don't know where the mask is. But I will do everything to find it and bring it back.
You might want to turn on the light... for the Dante mask. It's barely visible. I know, I'm sorry. The Dante mask is no longer here. It was stolen. Really? I was just looking at it.
Oh, I was going to quit smoking anyway. - Margaret? - Yes? Do you have your school uniform for tomorrow? Yes, Mom, I'm getting it now.
A worthy lover believes you have good reasons for everything you do! - Certainly I do. Barely an hour had passed when I learned that he was leaving Churchill. Something had to be done! Patronage was necessary, though I abhor it!
A giant sea creature on land. No. Its body evolved in a water environment. Therefore, it could not move in gravity. Do you want to see the show? I have recorded it.
Shouldn't there be a truck? Where the hell are we? Stop it! Wait, did you place the tube wrong? No, I placed it in the truck.
We wanted to create real magic. And he probably managed to do that, but you didn't? That's what he'd like you to think. My vision was a perfect blend of elegance and technology. But Owen wanted it alone and humiliated me by showing my private documents to the board and convincing them I was unstable.
And eyes open, wide awake. Go. Excuse me. These people are following me. Maybe you better check their pockets. Then we need to get to the lab as soon as possible and get the map to the market, where I'll hand it over to the Eye so we can finally go home.
Do I have all my stuff? I think I had more stuff with me. Didn't I have more... You don't think so? Sir, I think you still have my wallet. I gave it to you when I came in.
I think I had more stuff with me. I didn't have any more... You don't think so? Sir, I think you still have my wallet. I gave it to you when I came in. It'd be nice to have it back.
It was really funny to know that you escaped from me at the lab just to bring him here to me. Did you really think I'd let you escape? How did you do it? Everyone has their weakness. You find it, you go blind.
You know they are playing with you, don't you? They want to trap you. Yes, but the threat is real. This card can crack any system in the world, including ours. They have it and they will use it to expose us.
That's already two nights in a row. Of which we know. By the book, we can't just sit by and watch this for so long. I'd like to stay with him tonight. If you don't mind. You signed for the file. You can take it with you.
- You, come here! Chicks and kids. I hate this shit! Drop the gun! Throw it away!
Do you think you're faster than my index finger? Todd, please. - You want to take your chances? Where's the gun? Here. I got it, I got it!
Take these! DOREEN: Everybody, move forward! Over the wings! If you have a life jacket, put it on.
I don't suck on a guy's shoulder. - That's totally gay. - Do it. People have been expelled from the city for being vegetarians. The bullet was filled with the poison of the Lonomia caterpillar. I'll be dead in 90 seconds if you don't suck it out.
Welcome to the school for the gifted. Doesn't feel like a gift. It never does at first. To understand a power, you must know its extent. Only then can we teach you how to master it.
I know what kind of mutant you're looking for. And I know where to find them. This is my first time in America. I'm looking forward to learning about the culture. You won't find them here.
No way. One day she'll be walking home from school, or on a date, or meeting up with friends. And you won't be there to protect her. Okay, one more time. Now take the gun and hold it lower in front of your chest.
Okay, again. Now take the gun and hold it lower in front of your chest. It was a little too high. - Okay. - Take it.
Open them. Open them. Open that one. I said, open the box! Open it.
She has jaundice, but she will be fine. She'll be fine. I think I'll call you... Bronwyn. We need you down on Earth. While she's still around. OKAY?
This is crazy. I'm out. Hello! We're putting on a show here. You should all come and see it!
Alright. I'll give you my card... - and if you do, call us. - Don't waste a card. No, please, keep it.
- Yes. - No. Is that my toothbrush? What about my Kandahar story, Ed? Jerry shot it down.
- No. Is that my toothbrush? What about my Kandahar story, Ed? Jerry shot it down. Wait a minute, who shot it?
Hey! Do you want to know what I do with assholes like...? Holy shit! He's got a baseball bat! Yes! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Take your pizza and shove it up your ass, you bastard.
I know what "blue paint" is. Tonight you will receive a call at exactly 2307 hours. Repeat the time, Wing Commander. 2307 hours, sir. You pick up and write down a message where your wife can read it.
And I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Did you send it? The message! Did you send it?
Why the hell did Mellizo see the hard drive before we did? I don't know. But I do. It was many years ago, at the beginning of her political career. Her first government post after winning the elections. Valencia '95, narrowly missing an absolute majority. She needed an abstention to win the election, and she got it.
"So that's how I'm going to be when I get older." When you get older. When I get older. I hope I will. I want to see what the world becomes when she has conquered it.
Monsters! We have to stop them! You can't go on like this, BFG! BFG? Where's my warm blanket anyway? I thought you had it.
BFG? Where's my warm blanket, anyway? I thought you had it. Where is it? Slightly much in my cape somewhere? - Oh... I may have left it in the land of giants.
- Please. That's enough. Come here, all of you. We will instruct you... in the true nature of the Lycan warrior. For this lesson, our esteemed guest, Selene... will play the role of the death dealer who bravely defends our fortress... and I take the role of the evil Lycan... who seeks to destroy her.
It's a cold, bleak outpost, full of pathetic peace-loving cowards. It sounds like you've already been there. Where do you think I was when Viktor wasted years with Selene? Be ready. The journey is long and you must make it alone.
Just as my generation was blamed last time. Believe me, you don't want to carry that burden. We'll start with an aptitude test. Each of you will set up a secret communications network in your hometown. You install it, back up your website, delete it, and restore it.
Maybe your opportunity is wearing a green hospital gown and lives about 100 feet away from you. But that's work. And you don't even like having to go out of your way. What do you think you're doing? I should squirt lemon in your eye. - Drop it!
My grandfather and I often went out here to fish. He left the island to me when he died. This is where I always come when I want to be alone. And, uh... I don't know, I wanted to show it to you.
Interview everyone who has ever committed a crime like this. You know, the usual suspects. Shall I get them so you can get started? - Yeah, if you had that list... - Okay, I'll print it out.
Your pocket watch there contains a photograph. I caught a glimpse of it once. A photo of Irene Adler. Caught a glimpse? When I fell asleep, you looked at it.
What is it? And? What and? Where did you get that? I left them at the crime scene.
Just leave me alone! Of course I won't leave you alone. What is a name? What is called rose to us, as it would also be called, would smell lovely. Be so good as to keep the speech, as I recited it to you, lightly off your tongue, but if you take your mouth as full as many of our actors, I would just as soon hear my verses from the crier.
As if he were here. I am here. Here with you. And I'm not leaving. You're a hard man to get rid of. I'm stubborn, just like my husband. Let's talk about the future. How we want to change it.
You're leaving me alone with the mortician? You'll be fine. What's going on, Mr. Day? She threw a lit cigarette next to the gas pump I was standing next to. I put it out.
What's going on, Mr. Day? She threw a lit cigarette next to the gas pump I was standing next to. I put it out. Is that how people usually put out cigarettes, on other people's car windows? I know people who put them out in their mouths.
- AC. Did you say Macy's? - Air conditioning. - Macy's? Macy's? Sometimes Conner has an idea and implements it, Stay clean with CONNER4REAL and 99.9% of the time he's right. So you just have to believe he knows what he's doing.
- What do you say, dear? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - You're welcome. Honey, what do you want to call her?
- Thank you. - You're welcome. - You're welcome. Honey, what are you going to call her? I'm going to call her Maximus.
We look like terrorists. No one will believe our story. I wouldn't believe us. Fred Johnson has thrown us a lifeline. I say we take it.
This is my daughter, Kiri. She and, um... She and the other children were diagnosed with something doctors call hypoxic brain injury. This is the result of a work environment with low oxygen levels. She got it when she came to live here with me.
You're looking at, I don't know, some kind of bio-weapon? - Where did this recording come from? - Phoebe, I think. Phoebe Station. - I meant where you got it.
To a guy like me, that means something. Squatting in the trenches with others. Going through the shit together. So how about once we reach Eros, or wherever you're headed, we shake hands and forget this ever happened. We'll cross that bridge as soon as we reach it.
- Great series. Yes! Did you receive my friend request? Yes. You didn't accept it.
Just because it's a well-rounded thing. I have a horseback ride planned for us, a sunset champagne picnic on her favorite cliff where she climbed around as a kid. - What's a cliff? - A kind of cliff. You can see it from there.
- 300 men. They will reach Henry's fortress in three days. We cannot wait, we must attack. Otto, we can overrun the lion and his castle. It is impossible to take them in three days.
To pay homage to this masterpiece, as well as your esteemed presence, it is high time for the Macallan. Neal. Not the bottle from the auction. It is 62 years old! Exactly. What better moment to decant it?
If the Unsullied recapture Astapor and Yunkai, who will defend Meereen? - How do we stop them without fighting? - We don't. The masters know only one language. I have heard them for a long time and know them better than my own.
We have Ed on the line from.... How does Richard Crooks get on...? (Ed) Mr Crooks, the boys here, we love the shot. I lost my left leg and half my face on Guadalcanal, but thanks to the lady, I have a zest for life again! Can you play it again?
Here was suddenly the purest madhouse! It's not easy when you're gone. Yes, I'm very sorry. Tell me something, how did Richard Crooks get the recording? - He got it from her.
It's not easy when you're gone. Yes, I'm very sorry. Tell me something, how did Richard Crooks get the recording? - He got it from her. And he played it all weekend.
Drop your weapons! Trunk, drop your weapon! On the ground? Yeah, motherfucker, on the ground! Stitches, drop 'em!
I want to nibble on the little arms! Come on! And the life insurance? This is the second notice. You have to pay it.
- Inside yourself. I'll have to think about that. - Be here all night. - Good. You know I have a gun, and I'm going to use it.
Amahl, what's going on out there? - It's bad. Not good. - Amahl! Amahl, can I have my gun? I'm sorry, I think I need it.
I'm downstairs. I have to break up with him before we leave Libya. Why are you letting me stay on D when there's a party going on? Hey, that whole ambassador story. I don't believe it.
We accept your condition. Well then, gentlemen, it is decided. Understand me correctly. I will choose a bottle of my finest wine as a gift for Cumberland. I will present it to him when he is my prisoner.
And I hated you for it. And with the hate came the sorrow. I had never cried like that before and never since. The world was never the same. You destroyed it.
I'm ready when it's time. But at some point, you're going to need something hot and black. Mr. Bulletproof. You and your nicknames, Pop. You said your transition girlfriend took a shotgun, held it under your chin and pulled the trigger.
This is his son, Earl. I didn't know he had a son. Earl's dead. Scarfe forgot to lock up his gun one night. Earl found it and accidentally shot himself.
This does not help him. His temperature is dropping fast. That's it. The pH is not the problem, the temperature is. We need to turn it up.
But his real son was named Carl Lucas. But here's the crazy part. Nobody said a word. And Carl and I grew up best friends, but all the time there was this tension. You could feel it like a draft blowing under the door.
I focus on Harlem's Paradise and use it as a power base for community relations. That's a smart move. But you've also made dumb ones. You should never talk about murder over an unsecured line. Open it up.
It's okay. I'll see you soon. You trust me, don't you? Because I trust you with the future of the entire human race. And I'd like to show you how you're going to save it.
Welcome aboard. I'm so glad you're joining us. Hop on in, I'll explain. Tommy, this is Richard, my chief scientist. The machine will amplify your power and channel it through these tubes, this will allow you to send anyone wearing one into the future instantly.
Not my first murder case. - Are you all right? - Yes. Where's the cat? I have it. Do you want it?
Where is the cat? I have it. Do you want it? No. You have your cat? Do you want it?
I have them. Do you want her? No. You have your cat? Do you want it? I don't want it.
No. You have your cat? Do you want her? I don't want it. - Then why do you have it? - Why?
I mean, that's his name. What do you want from me? I didn't call him that. Is this just a coincidence with the pharmacy over there? - I didn't put it there.
Take care of mama and Nana, do you hear? You are a child of God. You have a destiny. Inside of you. The Lord has given it to you and no one can take it away.
I'll whip him when I see him. Whip him? Nonsense. I'll teach him. If the good Lord gave the boy the gift of reading, it would be a sin to let it go to waste.
You've been lied to. - Do you believe in magic, boy? - Of course not. Well, your father had magic in him. And you have it in you, too.
Well, your father had magic in him. And you have it in you, too. It flows through the Shannara blood. If I carry magic, why couldn't I save my mother? You could have if you had known how to release it.
They told of an elf who lived in the Vale. He told how he won the war of the races all by himself, armed with nothing but a magic sword and three elf stones. My father taught me to believe only what I see. You think just because those pointy-eared bastards say there's no magic that it's true? How do you know I haven't seen them?
What happened to the shelf I put there? Kyle didn't like it, so he took it out. He didn't like it? Who doesn't like custom wood shelving? Heavens. Half of us build the world, the other half tear it down.
This was supposed to be a bigger surprise, but.... Your bar? "The Yo... Yo... Yoknapatawpha. We call it "The Yonk."
So, keep looking. See you tomorrow. Well, my dear? Was it a good show? - Yes, it was. Was it nice? - You missed it.
How cute they are. And they get along really well. - Yeah, funny, they hardly ever fight. Did you have time to listen to my record? Excuse me, I'll bring it back to you later.
Do you know where Mom is? - She went to the tennis club. I think it was to a cocktail reception. - Oh, right. Fatna, have you seen any papers in an orange folder? I can't find them anywhere.
Trade sector 2 secured. Prepare 51 for Spartan-7.... Bishop... Will be good to see you in uniform again, Bishop. Who says I'm gonna wear it?
I don't think we should bet on those. I just understand that it's data from a multi-layered development approach that affects Godzilla, that's all. Seems more like an abstract pattern than a chemical diagram. It resembles a mandala. If you don't know the answer beforehand, you won't find it, which is paradoxical.
Then why are you awake in the middle of the night? It's a process. Okay, let's see how your therapy goes and maybe I'll talk to someone. Your jacket's all wrinkled. - Don't do that! - You could have ironed it.
Collins noticed that the camera in the parking lot wasn't working. When he went to check it out, two masked men with guns made their way in. Do we know how they turned off the cameras? The wiring seems to be intact. We'll take them to the crime lab.
Yes. Yes, there is. Leave the stuff with me. I thought you said we'd never find his signature. No, I said you'd never find it.
When did this happen? The night you robbed the Pot Palace. Would you like to explain the gun in your waistband? I found it. I didn't want a kid to pick it up.
It is legal in the state of Massachusetts. If you have a planting permit. Do you have yours handy, Charlie? No, I, uh... listen, I have a friend. He was gonna get it for me.
- I will go. - Do you know him? No, but I speak his language. Do you have an address? I'll text it to you.
Kiki will be glad I skipped a meal. - I have something. - Hold on a second. Contact. We still have a mine. Don't move until he's tagged it.
- What is it? - A favor worth a lifetime. What do you want to do with the bomb? Protocol is to blow it up on site, which we will do as soon as the sergeant is safe. Is there any way to disarm it so we can keep it as evidence?
We never really talked about it, but I always wanted kids. Both of us. - Right, honey? - Yes. "Fill the earth and subdue it."
Arcadia was too small. Next door is San Bernardino, but a new place was too expensive. That's when my brother had a brilliant idea. Tell him, Dick. - So... - He says, "Let's take our pad there." We put it on a truck.
- What is there to cooperate with? - Cersei is the mother of the king. He gives her his ear and trust. The King also speaks frequently to the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras. The High Sparrow seized power knowing we would quarrel rather than bring them back.
You do. I'm through with fighting. Even if it's for your own protection? Violence is a disease. You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
I'm through with fighting. Even if it's for your own protection? Violence is a disease. You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people. You don't cure it by dying either.
Good. Three lords walk into a tavern--a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale, but when the innkeeper serves them, each has a fly in his cup. The Lannister gets indignant, pushes the cup aside, and orders another. The Martell fishes out the fly and swallows it in one piece.
Time for plan B. See? - I deserve the crown. - No one deserves the crown. Then I'll take it.
This is no place for elves. We are on an important mission by order of King Eventine Elessedil. It is an honor to have such a distinguished visitor. Unfortunately, the passage you seek was destroyed two winters ago. An avalanche destroyed it.
I do not know. I saw ruins. Like those of an ancient city. Of humans, not an elven city. I did not recognize them.
I challenge you to prepare for what is to come. You must be prepared against the Dagda Mor. You challenge to see if I will fold. It's not so pleasant to have someone read your mind, is it? Your power may grow, but be careful how you use it, and for whom.
Thank you, Beetle. Knowing that Kubo has a friend to watch over him when I'm gone. That would be a nice ending to my story. Your story will never end. He will spread it and then those he told it to.
Just forget about it. Here's what we're gonna do: You listen to the tape, Richie. Then we'll make a record. I'll promote it.
Kitchen. The wallpaper is a bit oppressive. - No, it's cool. When we get bored, we paint over it. We take it.
I have a date with Bea to study. Do you like it? - Yes. Tomorrow we'll do the living room. You don't have to. I've gotten used to the wallpaper. And Bea thinks it's cool.
When we moved to Madrid and I fell into this depression, I didn't tell you. But the feeling of being to blame for the death of your father and the man on the train cut me off. I always avoided talking to you about it. I wanted you to grow up free of guilt. But you felt it.
It is the truth. I can show you. You know that she is the one who set off the bombs that destroyed the world, right? Wrong. She didn't destroy the world. She saved it.
- So was the commander. What Clarke did at Mount Weather made them weak. the ice nation is emboldened. Their queen wants Clarke's power. If her people think she has it, she will break the alliance and start a war.
- You can't stop me. - And how I can and I will. You are too young to have a death on your conscience, Master Bruce. I know how your parents deserve justice. I know you won't stop until you find them.
Okay. My necklace. The one you gave me on our first anniversary. It's on the nightstand. Would you bring it to me, please, sweetheart?
The one you gave me on our first anniversary. It's on the nightstand. Would you bring it to me, please, darling? Go. I'm strong enough to use it if I have to.
You are at home. - Yes. - The forensics report came in. The timer on the bomb was activated remotely, by phone, which was pretty smart. So he could plant it and detonate it whenever he wanted.
Someone set me up. Head trauma, due to external impact with a blunt object. - Captain, listen to me! - The murder weapon was a crowbar. We found it under the couch.
- The murder weapon was a crowbar. We found it under the couch. With your fingerprints on it. I used one at Union Station to open the locker. Someone must have taken it there.
Revenge. - Remorse. - Remorse. Let's talk about it. I feel them.
And Kringel personally told you she was heading south with Dougherty? Not personally. She left a note. Can I take a look at it? I didn't really think of it as a keepsake.
I have a gun. That's a good reason. Please. Tell me where he is. Come on, boy. You won't even point it at me!
And for that, I have to go back to Gotham. You little bastards! I told you not to take that bag! Do you have any idea who you're stealing from? Leave it!
I believe you ran Pinewood Farms. I believe you restarted the program, - and I'd like to know... - Why are you really here, Mr. Gordon? I beg your pardon? This whole town turned its back on you, even though you risk your life to save it over and over again.
Look. Helzinger? He can't stand criticism because of an overprotective mother. He wants love and approval. He gets angry when he doesn't get it, so I give it to him.
Who are you? I am Azrael, righteous scourge of sinners, and I have come to kill you, James Gordon. Put the gun down! Put the gun down! Put it down now or I'll shoot!
Close your eyes. Imagine that I am God. Almighty. I am God and I am redeeming you from all your guilt. I have laid this guilt on you, and now... I take it away.
The lab is sealed. - There must be a way in. - We have to go! We have to go now! Tell me how to get to that bomb and shut it off, or I'll beat you to death right now!
The bagles were quite fresh. Now they are not. I called you eight hours ago. I told you to handle the Zeppelin thing. But not only did you not handle it, but you told her manager about the deal with the Germans on top of that?
Hootie-Tootie-Disco-Cutie! Hootie-tootie disco cutie! My sweetie's at the door. "Nick Locke shot the Rasta in the neck and the Rasta was thrown through the wall and was instantly dead. Nick let the gun swirl around his finger and stuck it in the futural as the Rasta came back to life.
A tobacco vaporizer, dad. Katherine Heigl has one, too. Smoking kills. Where's the pipe, Jackie Lynn? I held it up in the air, a hawk stole it.
These are the wrong ingredients. In 20 minutes, I agree with you. But it doesn't matter, does it? This is New York, after all, where everyone is morally relative. Order a ham and clam pizza, and some schmuck will make it for you.
$150. My last name is Gross. Like "gross," only with a double S. You can't get the idea out of your head. You hum it to yourself on the train.
You can't get the idea out of your head. You hum it to yourself on the train. First you like it, then you hate it. It's not good enough. You write it down to get it out of your head. You pick up the guitar and put it to the test.
Sweetie? BEST EASTER GREETINGS HAPPY EASTER As you know, there are only a few days in a woman's cycle when she can get pregnant. And you take the ordinary mini pill? Do you take it every day at the same time?
I read that you look slimmer and more toned with a shaved chest. I'm back on the market and taking more care of myself since I'm single. Really? I started tinkering with popsicle sticks and sometimes the ice drips on my chest and everything gets sticky. That's another reason I shaved them.
I'm going to go on a little bit more. Excuse me. Could you not do that, please? My cat's gone. Have you seen her?
- God, I'm sorry. - Shit. That's okay. It's just bad timing because I just signed a one-year lease on a really nice apartment. And I turned down a part in a movie with Liam Neeson because it intersected with Witchita. I'm going to get it back.
And yet somehow it was able to get into the hands of a British law enforcement officer named Angela Burr. Here's the problem. Only two people in the world have this list in their possession. Sandy Langbourne and myself. So how was Angela Burr able to get it?
The palace tends to get a little testy about such things. They are looking for a new private secretary. Some newcomer has made too many mistakes and they want someone with sensitivity and experience to take over. Tea with the Queen. Nice job if you can get it.
Listen to me carefully, I really want this to stay between the two of us. Why don't you just tell me the truth? What did you do with the list? What list? Who did you show it to?
She conjures up who-knows-what with the book. What? More demons? Yeah, more demons. Demons, devils, whatever goes bump in the night. So, I'm gonna go down there. Kelly and you... You guard the door and keep it open at all times.
She said, "It's okay to be afraid of the dark. Truly tragic is when you are afraid of the light. Get your bag! - Where are we going? - Get it, go!
Out! Back! Back! Drop the trowel! Drop it!
If she had any faults, lack of loyalty was certainly not one of them. She was loyal. . . And careful. ... Not like her at all. She seemed to act most concerned about the new narrative. She felt it would be best to put it off for now.
We are now on his land. Are we better. ... Because if we're not, you're wasting time I don't have. In your opinion, Wyatt has the woman I love. If there was a shortcut to hell itself, I'd take it.
You remember. You two seem to have found yourselves in the same new narrative. They say in this country ... the only people who survive are men of conviction. Mine is to save Dolores or die trying Wyatt's is to claim this earth ... or raze it to the ground.
- Oh, ok. I.e., if JFK is saved, there is no Vietnam? Johnson! It was his fault that everything escalated in Vietnam at that time! If Kennedy had survived, there's no way the escalation would have continued. And a lot of those guys would still be alive. AI, I understand that, but I don't know if it's right to change the past to make it what you think it should be....
He is educated, charming, rich. He is a member of the Dallas Petroleum Club. And in 1962, he becomes Lee's best friend. Uh, we heard about a couple that moved here from Russia and, uh, this couple was having a lot of financial problems. Tell me, Jake, why is this guy hanging out in Lee's seedy apartment? Maybe they're swingers? And she said that Lee took her cigarette away from her and put it out on her shoulder.
Listen, I am ready to take responsibility. But if you want to handle this another way.... I got maybe $20, $30 on me, that's it. Okay, now you're lying. I saw your wallet. I want to see it. Let's see it.
The two of you were arguing...about whether you had hit his car. Then there was a scuffle, and he took your gun. My gun? Your gun from your pocket. He took it, and that's how his fingerprints got on it.
- He doesn't say that. Can we hear that from Mr. Ehrmantraut himself? The gun did not belong to Salamanca. That's all I can say. That's what you said. You said he pulled the gun and pointed it at you.
I think I'll succeed with this one. If I can still make out the letters. What the hell is this? It's music, stupid. I know music when I see it.
One of the rooms was not locked. There I saw a bottle of perfume. I wanted to bring it to my lady as a gift, It smelled so nice. I put it away. I still have the bottle, but after everything that happened, I didn't dare give it to you,
Okay. Tonight we'll meet at Murphy's. Okay? And you can take the rest of the day off. Hold the kid's hand a little bit. - All right. "A bullet pierced the door, Officer Santos kicked it in, an assault by the suspect ensued..."
The stores on Rodeo Drive and Fifth Avenue? Well, the fashion department has been abandoned. The perfumes and sunglasses keep everything else going. You're important in the world, you know. As long as it's there and your son is okay, you matter.
But... Looking into his eyes when he told the story.... - we were immediately captivated. - Okay, from the beginning. Today is October 11, 1997, and this recording will be my last will and testament. Maybe. I want to tell the truth... as far as I know it.
What's it like in California? It's like we've landed in the Twilight Zone. You got the map? Yes. I got it right here.
- Hello. How is she? Well, she's okay. What's with the music? Morgan finds it relaxing.
Just kidding. They will love you. Well, she can be very persuasive. He's staying with Kirkland. That's all that matters. You went behind my back. I saw an opportunity, and I took it.
-Then why do you mention shellfish? -He's allergic! Your butt cheeks. So he made a big donation to this stupid food allergy organization. They should call it the Organization of the Weak Pedigrees.
Maybe it's been 20 years, but if anything, she's even hotter-- how would you know if she's hot? She was basically just a pair of sunglasses and a big hat. Trust me, Lana, she's still hot. And you're the stupid one, if I have rabies, now you have it too.
So, about the disk... They want to get us. -They want to get it back. -No, Mr. Archer. You have to get it back, urgently.
-I mean... -I mean, if we don't get that disk for that big-ass bitch, we're gonna have to shut down. How's that gonna help? It's our fault the disk was stolen in the first place. Since we stole it.
They are lucky to be alive. She trusted me! Veronica trusted me with the disk. I let her down. Maybe so. But we'll get it back.
We were set up and blackmailed Veronica Deane, popular Hollywood star. Yes, definitely a contra. But then I got the disk back. I'll give you a pro. Although I couldn't deliver it to her personally.
No, yeah, got it. Yes. Yep, he said no. And that even if they wanted pizza for the hostages, which they don't, the perpetrators wouldn't eat it because they know about the sleeping pill in it.
To go, however, is not nice. Okay, listen. I'm sorry. I just... I got this chance. We have this chance. I want us both to take it.
But I did take a few personal items that will help us find him. That sounds like a good investigative plan. First of all, though, we should get out of this hotel. Once upon a time, there was a village that was plagued by a man-eating dragon lizard. The local policeman tried everything to kill the creature, but nothing could stop it.
Kera. I thought your species was dead. I am the last. Earth is my home. And I will not let you take it away from me.
To the city with the white church. Listen. Can't you hear its bell? Yes. Yes, I can hear it now.
- I was away for six months, I don't know anything about that. Did she give her name? I only have her first name. Annette. And I have a phone number. I've read the murder book a hundred times. I could recite it word for word.
Ronnie took Shannon under her wing with much fanfare. Then, suddenly, little things disappeared. Women's things. Like lipstick, perfume, costume jewelry. One day, Ronnie wanted a hair clip. Shannon says she has one. Have an assistant get it.
Shove your smile, you fat ass. Shit. I'm taking that gun to L.A. tomorrow. How soon can you make it? I'll take it to ballistics myself.
Corrupt police officers kill a colleague? You're saying they're covering it up? - The mayor and the police chief? They will delay the investigation until after the election. Then they'll quietly let it disappear.
They killed Tony. Fuck you! Put the gun down and nobody gets hurt. - Put the gun down! If you want it, get it.
I've already told you that. Tell me again. Remind me. A horse kicked me. I've had it ever since.
Of course, he wormed his way up to the captain. Then I heard last year that a detective in Hollywood threw his ass through a plate glass window. Into the duty sergeant's office. That really made my day. We're pulling a major operation tonight. I came in early to plan it.
Lonely. But there is one feeling we should never show. Anger. Because no man wants to be threatened by a woman. To survive, we learn to suppress it, and wait for the right time.
Council of Time Masters But if we have the opportunity to stop him, and again do nothing, that blood is on our hands. As a long-time Time Master, you seem to forget that our job is to protect the timeline, not to protect humanity. You wish to undertake the very kind of time manipulation we swore to prevent. And yet, if we abandon humanity to destruction by evil, the guardians of what universe would we be? What if, in trying to save the world from Savage, you make it more vulnerable to another, even worse, despot?
What if, in trying to save the world from Savage, you make it more vulnerable to another, even worse, despot? We are not warriors, Captain Hunter. We do not have an army. Nor am I asking for an army. Just a single time ship and your permission to change history before Vandal Savage ends it forever.
It is too late to turn back. Someone has removed the main processor unit. - Are you sure? - I designed those processors, - so yeah, pretty sure. - Well, HIVE would only remove them if they knew....
Nothing. All the money, all the buildings, all the inventions, didn't matter to the world. My life didn't matter in the end. Rip is giving me a chance to help save the world. I have to take it.
Do you actually know what an extraordinary chance we are given? The chance to be murdered by an immortal psycho. No, thank you. I'm a 20-year-old auto mechanic. The world is better off without me trying to save it.
No thanks. I'm a 20-year-old auto mechanic. The world is better off without me trying to save it. I don't understand your decision. But I respect it.
What are you doing? We prayed together. Prayed that God would save our city. Our prayers have been answered. God will save Alexandria... because God gave us the courage to save her ourselves.
I see that now. When I was out there... with them... when it was all over... when I knew that we... had this place safe again... I had this feeling. It took me a while to remember what it was...because I haven't felt it since I woke up in that hospital bed. I want to show you the new world, Carl. I want to make it a reality for you.
This whole thing at Tulane... It drove a wedge between us as a family. He didn't feel supported, so he left. But I gave him my credit card, for emergencies. But he never used it.
What do you want from me? Stop asking us. It's up to you. The poison of this particular species is particularly dangerous. If it comes into contact with a person's spinal fluid, it causes it to boil.
Are you looking for him. Evan? - Mom! Mom! - The door is locked. Kick it in.
Yes. (LAUGHS) Ms. Dunhill is our new librarian. Oh! - Great... great. - I was reading on a bench and... and I didn't think about my purse, and he was nice enough to bring it to me.
This is your way of life now. The more you resist, the more difficult it becomes. When someone knocks on your door, you let us in. We own that door. If you try to stop us, we will break it down.
Go to the morgue tomorrow and see him. You'll find all the answers there. But tonight you must try to sleep. Byers' body was found in this quarry lake early in the evening. Policeman David O'Bannon discovered it shortly after sunset.
All students, please listen up. There will be an assembly in the gym to honor Will Byers. AUDIO VIDEO ROOM -Fourth period is cancelled. -To. -What? -Hey, can you open it?
I was. So what? So what? You make the same mistake? I heard the future of the company. - I heard it!
Shut up, Scott. Shut the fuck up. Hey, I'm a junior partner! Guys, the three of us built this company. - And now we're selling it.
I can stand up for you if that's what you want. Is there any... Is there any reason I can't continue my work? No. What do you mean? I heard about a position, so I suggested it to you.
- Softball. Underhand. Give me some insight into how you handle information. The press acts like information is a dirty word. Everyone has access to the information. We just know how to analyze it better.
Take it all the way in. Hello? - I miss you already. How did you get this number? - You gave it to me.
Turn it off. Turn it off. David wants to see me. You wanted to see me? - Close the door. I'd rather leave it open.
Let's be clear. To make the changes we need, Ed and I need a mandate. And for that, Ed needs to win by at least ten points in November. So I'm not just asking you to win over the Bronx. I'm asking you, Francisco, to let you and your people take down the competition. Wherever you find them.
- I know. - No, you don't. Music is the only reason. It will push you forward and open doors that everyone says are closed. You get the whole damn world for free if you just love it and hold nothing back.
We can scratch it without harming the plate. I would never allow anyone to damage your beautiful plate. - Did you really like it? - More than that. I need another one so I can play it over and over again.
I would never allow anyone to damage your beautiful record. - Did you really like it? - More than that. I need another one so I can play it over and over. No, you want another one so you can totally scratch it.
- More than that. I need another one so I can play it over and over. No, you want another one so you can totally scratch it. That too. But I want to play it, over and over again.
Yes, I'm proud of that too. - I'm Mylene Cruz. - Hey. Leslie Lesgold is listening to our record right now. Maybe you'll listen to it, too.
- I'm Mylene Cruz. - Hey. Leslie Lesgold is listening to our record right now. Maybe you'll listen to it too. If she thinks they're cool, I'm not just listening.
I was hurt. Let's not beat around the bush. - Have you listened to Mylene's record? - Really good record. - My DJs would love it.
- Have you listened to Mylene's record? - Really good record. - My DJs would love it. - I'm glad you said that. I don't give it to them though.
- Diane was going to shoot us. There's this vow of silence about our marriages. I'm not going along with this anymore. Robert, it was an accident. I shouldn't have had a gun in the house. Especially not where that stupid bitch can find it.
They are $12 each. That would be nice for the kids while we talk to them. I have a good idea. We'll make these at home, it'll be great. We'll whip cream and freeze it. That will be ice cream.
TULIP: Quick! - The flap! - TULIP: Forget her!
Strawberry Rhubarb Cake. You're mine. So... I installed the trial version of an accounting software. The good news is, after 30 days I can renew it with a fake email address. But...
The host that got lost is the woodcutter. Looks like the rest are stuck here waiting for food. Can't you program more than one idiot to start a fire? We could, but thanks to a new directive from your boss, only one of them is authorized to handle an axe. The rest of them can't even touch it.
Come on, Logan, you know she doesn't belong out here. If you leave now, that no-good outlaw Slim Miller will definitely get away from us. Damn it, no way. You dragged me along on this stupid bounty hunt. The least we can do is go through with it, okay?
So, my brother took him off the leash, and at that moment the dog spotted a cat. I think it must have looked just like this piece of felt. He ran. Never did a thing look so beautiful as the old running dog. Finally, he caught it.
My partners and I are here to relieve you of your freight. Somebody's been telling you boys fairy tales. Nothing in this car is worthwhile. The story I heard, that a bullet from us, will blow you like nothing to the kingdom of heaven. Well, then you understand why we can't give them up.
I'm going to... We'd best go this way. - It's heavy. - Yeah. Could we put her down?
"Unfortunately, the previous information was too optimistic." That's the situation. When did they agree to let the guerrillas go from the building to the helicopter? What is it? The pump is fucked. He can't afford a new one. So I'm fixing it for him.
It is a gift. That's just the way it is. It's not funny. I'm complimenting you. You're lucky to have such a gift. But you're not using it properly.
I have lived in the shadow of the noose for a long time. I am used to it. But these poor people... You preach rebellion? Is it rebellion to fight against injustice when you see it?
Is it rebellion to fight injustice when you see it? Or to rise up against an unjust enemy? Possibly you and I are not so different. Lean on me, lean on me, Hubert, like this.... I see a better world coming even if we may not live to see it.
You are hurt. What are you doing here? The conceit of this man! Beaufort must lie awake at night worrying about snivelling greed. He wears his nose so high, he should be careful no one cuts it off.
We trusted you! I will see to it that justice is done. Do you expect me to believe such words anymore? After all that has happened to my friends? Put this burden on yourself and you will carry it forever.
Koen. Uncle Jimmy, what are you doing here? What you got in the bag? Is there anything dead in there? Take it.
Go ahead. Your father would want you to have it. Hey, that's not a toy. Sure, Jimmy, whatever. Give it to my big brother.
I just put my clinic on the line for you. - I have it under control. - You murdered someone. The authorities say otherwise, and they'll come after them. And who will take care of the people in the zone if they close it down?
Yes. We are already further along than we thought. We need to speed things up. What do you want me to do? Get this thing... ...now. We need it for the next step.
He wants what you want. There is an international consortium responsible for the redevelopment of the zone. Matthews has been working behind the scenes to make that happen. - Cleaning up the zone is the first step. - Yes, cleaning it up from the people.
Call your uncle if something happens. Her mother had never arrived at the factory. In the bicycle cellar she suddenly felt miserable and crawled back into the apartment. A disease had struck her. Her uncle called it cancer.
Hi. Weren't you supposed to take your stuff to LA? Isn't Becky waiting for you there? Yeah, but I forgot my lucky guitar, Priscilla. I put it here, but I forgot it.
Don't I get streamers? That's not what I meant. Quick! Get out of here! D.J. and I are fighting over the clothes rail. I let go, and she rams it into the wall of Dad's room.
- Wow. - That's great. - Cool. Great cow, Mom. Where did you get it?
- Okay, are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Can you, uh... Will you make sure Darren records the show? I want it for my files.
May I see the message? I suspect it is not as incomplete and deleted as you claimed yesterday. WANTED PERSON SHARIF ZAMANI IS IN OSLO. WASIMA IS AT THE P-HOTEL IN DECKUNG. -Who sent it?
We need them to get Abbie back. My husband's power has gone to his head. That's not going to happen to me. I don't want to destroy this world. I like it.
Do you know what pension they're collecting? No, we are not in heaven, not at all. Is this hell? The cake is too good. The last time I saw you was in the grimace of a demon.
Previously on "Billions"... Since when is it a crime to become successful in this country? Everyone has access to the information. We just know how to analyze it better.
Sorry, I was short on Kevlar. The damage to a single bit of the machine's code, now in a compressed state, would be equivalent to losing terabytes of data. Irretrievable, unrecoverable. It's running on lithium-ion reserve now, but when the light starts flashing, we're in big trouble. Our best hope is to get back to the subway and stabilize it.
Our best hope is to get back to the subway and stabilize it. Even then, it's unclear whether I can repair the battery, let alone unpack the machine. It would require a tremendous amount of computing power, which I don't have at the moment. Don't worry, we'll find Root. She will help you get it working again.
Then we get Shaw back, start working with the numbers again. Mr. Reese, we don't know if the machine is the same as before. She could be mortally wounded. You don't know that. We'll fix her.
Is all the data gone? The battery is dead. It has no power supply. There might be some residual charge in the backup battery. If there was any, I burned it out.
The battery is dead. It has no power supply. There might be some residual charge in the reserve battery. If there was, I burned it out. Finch, there's got to be a way to revive it.
This is a shitty idea. We know who planted the bomb, but we can't do anything. -Because we didn't see... -You know... I'm not finished! Because we didn't see him plant it and set it off. We saw the explosion, but that's not enough. -Listen, Jon Petter...
Because we wear helmet cameras on all missions, and you should return the ones you took. Can we clear this up? Did you steal the camera? Jon Petter Hals made a nice claim there. He's a soldier, I'm a journalist. I uncover the truth so it can be talked about.
A machine that spies on you, every hour, every day. You gave it the power to see everything... record, retrieve, and control the lives of ordinary people. The government calls these people irrelevant. We don't. But to them, you are all irrelevant,
- Maggie, the wedding photographer. - Yes, we need that camera. Grab Maggie at her dinner. Cut the camera strap with it. Bring the camera here where I remove the memory card and then I copy it to the laptop hard drive.
A machine that spies on you, every hour, every day. You gave it the power to see everything... record, retrieve, and control the lives of ordinary people. The government calls these people irrelevant. We don't. But to her, you are all irrelevant, victim or perpetrator, - if you are in her way.

Your sociopath of a son hit a child on the neck. The victim didn't report it because he feared retribution. The boy has a ruptured trachea and can't sing in the state competition. Accordingly, I don't care where the violence comes from or why. I don't want it at the school.
Ok. Come on. Come on. There's a door in front of you. Push it open.
Yes, my voice changed after that. It was completely different. I don't know. He, uh... He could never hear it.
For her, he could do no wrong. Mothers are sometimes like that with sons. He was my twin brother. And it's true what they say, there is a connection. I destroyed it.
Since we're talking so openly... may I show you something unusual? - No, not at all. - Come on, let's go. The cold room in the back. Open it.
I thought you didn't see any. At the beginning I don't look, but at the end I look over the crowd. It's like sleeping with a stranger, and when you leave, you ask for their name. To validate the intimacy. Or to invalidate it.
Yes, why do we keep trying to understand everything? The future is dark. Not in the sense of evil. Just dark. You can't see it.
It will be very difficult. It will be very painful. "But you have to stay alive to give them this." And a white moth flew out of her mouth into mine. I swallowed it.
It will be very painful. "But you must stay alive to give them this." And a white moth flew out of her mouth into mine. I swallowed it. I kept it inside me, waiting for you to come.
Please come back to the room. Come back. I'm busy, Nance. I'm gonna make myself a waffle. And then I'm gonna eat it.
Pretty sure? - We could go both ways. - That's the first clever sentence. - We'll meet there. - I don't think so. If you want to keep your hand, you should keep it in check.
Many, many, many thanks. I am at a loss for words. Call me when you find them again. - I don't have your number. - I entered it: Alexandre.
- Maybe you'll find it again. What? Well... The beauty you lost or let go. It's still out there. On this trip, you'll find it again or let it go forever.
You want a hit before you kick my white ass? Some of you haven't been down south much. Let me tell you a story so you understand what I'm talking about. There's a forest-and-field plant down there that looks like turnip weed. And everybody calls it "polk salad."
Other than what they have in common? I'm serious. I'm worried about Alex. This has to stay between us. She was with me last night. She wasn't feeling well. I tried to offer her my help, but she didn't take it. Since then I've been trying to reach her and she doesn't pick up.
You know that? Forget control. This is about justice. Don't forget that. We can still get it, Simon. Together.
He planted this homemade bomb on this truck that went off in the Santa Monica Gateway. I want you to find him. - He's with the resistance? - No, he's greedy. Someone paid him to put it there.
No. One dollar here was often not even enough for the jukebox. I could get used to those prices. I know how they got to Justin and the armory so fast. They have... this huge database of information... and, more importantly, they have a woman who knows how to use it.
Nothing was certain. And the change in our timeline is proof of that. Stopping Jennifer Goines and destroying the virus changed history. We pushed back the plague. We delayed it.
She could be extraterrestrial. She could be from another dimension. Not from this earth? We don't know that yet. So it can be captured.
It could be from another dimension. Not from this earth? We don't know that yet. So it can be captured. Can it be transported?
I know. I'm great. But so is she. How can we help? If you don't improve my formula or make it permanent, you can't help.
Ana helped me draw some plans for a containment chamber. It should be relatively easy to construct. These are the plans. You should take a look and see what materials we need. I would like to build it as soon as.
- I discovered this when you were unconscious. Just answer me this one question. Do you hear it? - Hear what? - The voice... It's like it's coming from your own mind, but it's coming from somewhere else. Do you hear it? Do you hear it?
- He could destroy zero matter. - Maybe it could cure Jason Wilkes. - Or kill Whitney Frost. You've already got me admitting I don't know. You think you can build it?
I have always loved fireworks. Well, actually just the fire. What if it doesn't work? The crack will open. Zero matter will leak out and you and I will absorb it.
Two hours ago, you tried to frame me with a fake file. If I wanted to help them, I wouldn't be here. But I'm here with you. The rift will open. Zero matter will leak out and you and I will absorb it.
Where's my gun, Chief Thompson? At the SSR. It's being repaired there. I'm here to buy us a little more time to finish it. Vernon wants it operational before we hand it over.
That's all right. I just want to use it once. What for? Dr. Wilkes has my zero matter. I'm going to get it back.
With his kidney donor. That was real. Come on. Stop it. I don't even want to go to her wedding. -Why would I go through with it?
He found out our plan. - What plan? - To turn the gamma cannon into a bomb. - When will the bomb go off? - It has a remote detonator. Thompson will blow it up as soon as he's sure.
I am... The zero matter. She... She's gone. - I couldn't hold her anymore. - It seems that you have repelled her.
- The answer is right in front of you. How do the most successful scientists achieve true greatness? Considering your history, through lots of alcohol and romps with easy girls. That's a good guess, but it's wrong. They let smarter people do the research and then steal it.
- I'm thinking. - How long until the gamma cannon is loaded? - At least another 20 minutes. - It doesn't have enough power to fire. - Could we blow it up in the crack?
- Peggy, let go! - No, Daniel, hold on! - Hey, he shouldn't be in there! - Jarvis, what the hell are you doing? The gamma cannon can't fire, but you could blow it up in the crack, correct?
- Okay, yeah... Okay, I'll organize that. Okay. I need you to give me your gun. Take it.
Okay, I'm going to organize that. Okay. I need you to give me your gun. Take it. Take it now.
Okay. I need you to give me your gun. Take it. Take it now. Take it.
Take your time and let me know if you want to rap. I'm sorry, Luce. I can't right now. Is it the neck brace? I'll take it off.
- You are a hopeless dreamer. You almost died in your search for another world! Oh dear parrot, Papperlapapp, watch out: In the air hangs the scent of papaya. What do you need the other world for? I don't care about your chatter. There is a bigger world out there and I will find it!
Rebuilt. After the fire. Yes. The story is full of darkness. If you'd like to leave a message, I'll be happy to forward it to Mr. Pembroke.
We are receiving a signal from the Ark. - This is the signal. - This is ours. The queen of the ice nation wants Clarke's power. If her people think she has it, she'll break the alliance and start a war.
You don't give a shit about my people. I know why you're here. I made you look weak at Mount Weather, and now the Ice Nation is taking advantage of that. If you want the power of Wanheda, then kill me. Get it.
About what? Raven, come on. You're not leading anybody on. I'm not trying to. If this machine was broken and you knew there was a way to fix it, wouldn't you do it because it might be too hard?
You know, you give me the little finger, I'll take the whole plate. - Can I try these? - Yeah. No, no. You have to hold it like this.
What? Why? Are you shooting a scene with it, or...? - No. - Well, can't I keep wearing it?
I'll show a card trick if you want to see it. Could you choose a card? - Sure. - Pick one. Look at it, and put it back in the deck.
You need mouth skills. This card was folded in my gullet one, two, three times. Was that your card? I don't know. Should I remember it?
Should I remember it? It was the nine of clubs! That was her card. Trust me, it was the nine of clubs. He just told me to look at it.
I drink my water. I'll be right there. Let's have fun, okay? What's next, Mom? Take the fork and run it along the dough like this.
You shouldn't be here. Arya and I are good friends now. She's way cooler than this stupid tour. The studio tour sucks. My uncle thought it was boring as hell.
There must be a way to correct this somehow. Fortunately, Gideon is only showing us a prediction for the future that you all created. Time is like cement. It takes a while for it to solidify. In this case, until Savage's team unravels the secrets of your future technology and adapts it to its goals.
- You can't let her die. - I don't intend to. Severe internal injuries from multiple ruptured major blood vessels. BP 82 over 30 and stable. I'm irrigating the wound and cauterizing to stop the bleeding.
- Yeah yeah. What's the point? - Nothing. Oh, yeah? Did you ask me if you could show the apartment? If we're going to sell it, we need an appraisal.
Don't play dumb. I'm talking about How on Eagle's Wings. - What? - I'll bring them tomorrow.
~ ♪ Teachers S01E03 ♪ ♪ Duct Duct Goose Original Air Date on October 10, 2011 Today I get the new video camera. No one else is grabbing it.
Is gentian not strong? That's not the point. Gentian is a strong liquor, Ricky. Nobody denies that. But the phrase has nothing to do with gentian. - Maybe you just don't know it.
Flag. Sophie, get out your fake flag. -Hey, guys, I've got the flag. -Hey. -Hey, look, she's got the flag. She's got it.
-Ok. Otherwise you'll call the police. Now please be so kind and give me this time capsule. You want the kids' time capsule? Just give it to him, Hal.
Let's take a look at your hand, Grandpa. I was a nurse. That's how I met Ronnie. What's the prognosis? Can you save it?
You want to help me understand. Do you have any files we can look at? Anything that can help us? This place was broken into and they took my laptop and my cell phone. You had a formula for cancer and you lost it?
-Negative, Kojak. We're still looking. Hurry, Charlie. We gotta find that formula. We'll find it and give it to the Nazis, and then the nightmare will be over.
I am sorry. I'm just looking for the right way out. Shit. It's right that he won't give them the formula. But we have to find it first.
I have the formula! -What? -Are you sure? -Yes! I have it in front of me!
-What? -Are you sure? -Yes! I have it in front of me! Ronald hid it as an app on his tablet.
We just brought more medicine. Gregory wants the best deal possible. Yes, but we also want things. We need food. We came all this way, we're going to get it.
She is worried that we will be attacked. When they come, we're going to end it all. It won't be like last time. We are preparing everything and these people now know what to do. The world is ours and we know how to take it.
We were lucky. We figured it all out together. That's what it felt like. After everything we've done. The world is not what we thought it was.
Did it work? Every single hacked file is deleted, including yours. Adios, gonzo, sayonara! Okay, so Dominic's people won't find out about me? Never. Once I knew it was him, I followed his downloads to the IP address and formatted the hard drive. He doesn't need it anymore anyway.
Copy that. We'll stay on Sinclair. Bellamy's coming to you. Sinclair, what are you doing? Raven said the solenoid was acting up, so I thought I'd replace it.
That's what got Monroe killed. You're about to cross a line, Kane. No. No. I crossed it.
I am a spy, Bryan. I've been passing on information... Hey, shut up. I found the bug. Did you put it there?
Let them go. I'll let her go if you give me what I want. The technology Clarke is carrying, it's mine. No way. Clarke, just give it to her.
It's actually pretty boring here. As always, with love, Vanessa. She told her story. Yes, master. - Did she believe the doctor?
Something must have come together. - The card. - Yes, the map of Helena Blavatsky. A 19th century Russian occultist. The map supposedly allowed her to sense the presence of demons. - I don't have it.
- Why are you so sure? - Because there is no alternative. - Nice piece. - So where's the map? Atticus Nevins bought it earlier this year, but after his Jimmy Hoffa stunt... all the treasure hunters and dealers jumped all over his collection.
It's funny. I didn't even know I had the map. But when I heard you were looking for it... I hid it in a safe place. So, thanks for the warning. Tell me you have it.
How so? The Prime Minister sent his personal attaché Yuri Krupin here. The reason, the immediate suspension of the entire project. The Prime Minister is against the refuge? Because his opposition supports it, and indeed the ministers who are in front of you.
Now then. I guess we're done. Excuse me. Just a second. About that favor, you wouldn't happen to have the number for the attorney general's office, would you? That's all right, I've got it.
That's how much she hated you. But I didn't care... because I saw something. I saw a future. Our future. We had a future until you started destroying it.
And I will, with you or without you. No, I will not have this conversation. I'm not going to indulge any longer. You need to shut up. I can be part of your campaign or end it.
Something you like better. Do you have the pen I sign with? Put your hand on the wall. - Sir? - Put it against the wall.
- However. I handed over all my correspondence like everyone else. That doesn't prove anything. I'm trying to save this campaign. If I wanted to sabotage it, I'd let the president do it... - ...instead of contradicting his VP stunt.
I have to make some phone calls. I'll be in your office later. Put me through to LeAnn Harvey. Milkin will be staying with this man, Anton Khalski. He owned the second largest bank in Russia... until Petrov seized it in 2013.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What are you doing? We should fall back. I have an opportunity to stop Blake. I'm gonna take it.
Go on. Marilla? I took the brooch. I didn't mean to, but there was this irresistible temptation. I took it with me when I went to Diana's so I could play Lady Cordelia.
Marilla? I took the brooch. I didn't want to, but there was this irresistible temptation. I took it with me when I went to Diana's so I could play Lady Cordelia. I thought I could put it back before you got back, but when I crossed the bridge, it slipped from my fingers and fell into the deep, sparkling water, and it sank forever into the lake of shining water.
Did your brother think there was something else there? I don't know. And you? Everyone has to face this question once in their life. There's nothing wrong with asking it.
Ms. Thawley are you prepared to give your testimony? Yes, Your Honor. Do you understand that you must answer all questions truthfully? No matter how you feel about it and that a violation can be punished? Yes, I am not afraid to tell the truth! I'm just afraid of not being allowed to tell it.
Long story. Although Daisy is so convinced of her Inhuman abilities that she thinks she can change the future. That's funny. We're trying the same thing. Power is intoxicating, isn't it? And he's right. You never feel it until you take it from someone else.
I have heard many good things about you. You have earned a good name for yourselves. Thank you very much. We missed you at the wedding. I am sorry to have missed it.
- True. But that's... - No, there is no but. Even a dog wants discipline. Once he has it, he forgets that he was beaten.
That was neither fair nor natural. Women give life and are worshiped. Men perform deeds. This show is my kingdom and my mission. I am taking it over again.
Anyone who blabs gets waterboarded and buried in the desert. Clear? - Absolutely. - Good. Because we're under observation this week. And I want people to watch what we do best, and that is: romance! So we're taking our love story and stuffing it in their mouths until they choke.
Okay. You know how we, um, talked about how most Inhumans have a feeling where nothing feels right, just empty? Yeah, like I've spent my whole life searching for my parents. That's a classic attempt to fill that void. So I tried to fill it with vodka, but couldn't control it, neither the drinking, nor my temper.
And don't forget our government type disguises. I've always wanted to be a spy. So, the file we're looking for is in a secure archive. To gain access, we need to borrow a magnetic key card. Because that's so much easier than just shrinking down and stealing it.
The Atlas rocket... can take us into orbit. It ascends and puts the capsule into an elliptical orbit. Earth's gravity acts on the capsule, but it is so fast that it misses the Earth. This keeps it in orbit. How we get it back down is the great unknown.
How we get her back down is the great unknown. Yes, Katherine. So the capsule spins around the Earth forever because it's not slowed down? That's right. Braking it at exactly the right moment and at exactly the right rate, that's the job.
Thank you. Planck-Einstein. The problem is the transition of the capsule from an elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit. There is no mathematical formula for this. We can calculate takeoff and landing, but without this change, the capsule stays in orbit, we can't retrieve it.
It's chaos in there. It takes a while to restore order. What are we supposed to do with them until then? You have a garrison. Use it.
Two million livres! It took me six months to design the lock and two blacksmiths a month to build the door. It is over 30 cm thick. My tools and plans. You have until noon today to open it.
My tools and plans. You have until noon today to open them. But if I remove just one piece, the mechanism will block the door. You must believe me. If you try to blow it open, the roof will collapse.
I felt sorry for him. He was in the battle for Salas, Porthos. What was there? The Spaniards had surrounded the city for almost a year. The people defending it had to eat dogs, rats.
-Noah has a crush. -Really? -You liked her? I didn't. I thought it was dull.
He appeals to your lust and desire. You are more than that. You are spirit and soul. You want to have her soul. I do not need it.
If we lose Ethan to evil, the night will never end. And if it is a prophecy, what is your role? Are you the savior? The warrior who ends the night? Or are you the wolf who loves it?
Over and over again. You know what needs to be done. You don't have to remind me. This reckoning is long overdue. I will enjoy it.
I can make you whole, human. Free from the burden of hate. Untainted by sadness. My sadness is mine. I would never give it up.
Go into those dark streets you know so well, those wretched backyards and secret alleys, and find me a wicked man! An unfaithful husband, a cruel lover, a rich despot, a debauched suitor who fucks a girl like you, who slips his hand. Find him and bring me his right hand! Yes! Cut it off and hold it bleeding to your chest!

Schrödinger's cat. Ah, apparently I impressed you with my drawing talent. Schrödinger puts his cat in a box with poisonous food. And, until he opens the box, the cat is theoretically alive and dead at the same time. But when he opens it, it's either "Hello, mittens" or "Goodbye, socks."
Also a shitty friend. - Ethan, I'm sorry. - Whatever, dude. Avilo offered me a collaboration. I'm taking it.
- But practice patience. He will come. - No. It's something else. This box has been my only companion for over 4,000 years. I don't know why it's so hard for me to let go of it, but it is.
You know what I remember? Your voice. You used to read to me, sing songs to me. I loved that voice. I'm sorry you haven't heard it in so long.
- How is he? - No one comes to me for their feelings. Yeah, that makes sense. What about the base? Still working on strengthening it.
We are colleagues, after all. That's us, Dr. Simmons, and, um.... That's us. That is this working relationship that I would like to keep intact. - Yeah, we shouldn't do anything to disrupt it.
Then you'd have Daisy back and the three of you can live as a little twisted family again? - That's a last resort. - This is insanity. I want your help. I need it.
No way. Okay, coach. But we know you're okay. I have an insidious disease. It's called "I'm not gonna let another arrow go through my gut."
I'm just not stupid. Don't you realize she could kill us? You're the one with the power. They want you to put it on, Josh, because the mask's properties are based on electromagnetism. Lift it up and you'll see.
We know you're not on our side, Theo. You said you wanted to help Lydia, but you left Oaks with something else, didn't you? You mean the mask? - Is that what you're worried about? - Did you put it on?
We want Mason back. Okay, the only difference is we want him back alive. Well, I'm open to compromise. Do you still have the map of the telluric currents? Bring it to the O.R. in two hours.
But you'll need it if you want Mason to trust you. - I can't take the power from him, can I? - No, only from the Beast. But with the full moon dangerously close, the opportunity may present itself sooner than you think. - Good. - As soon as you see the opportunity, take it.
What are you talking about? Oh, that's right. Spoiler alert. While you were busy with me, Julian stole Stefan's body. I'm going to get it back.
The people you think you need to protect, Elijah, Rebekah, even Hope.... sometimes you hurt them more than anything. What? What you just said, protecting Rebekah. I know what the weapon is. I made it myself.
If there was any way to bring Aiden back, I would do it, at any cost. If there's a chance for you to be with the man you want to be with, you have to do it. I'm guessing you're a little upset right now, but trust me, you have nothing to worry about. I just want back what's mine, starting with my dark objects, and I figured I needed to get your attention. Do I have it now?
Traitor to my family, - thief of what is mine. - Don't be so dramatic. As I said, I just wanted your attention. And since you're here, I got it.
You are nothing like me. You really believe that Aya will keep her promises. She already has. She gave me the spell to help the person I care about the most. All I need is power and I will do anything to get it.
I have my sources looking for Marcel. It won't take you long. I can't imagine this turn of events will increase your chances of winning. The game is not over. If the Strix find Marcel, they'll take the charter and hand it to me.
Been studying them since I was a kid. That's how I was able to chase them out of New Orleans in the first place. I rebuilt that city under my imagination and my rules. Made alliances with my friends and got rid of everyone else. This is my city because I took it.
Shadowspire. It looked familiar to me right away. I ran into a lot of them back in "Stan." I need to talk to my brother again. Who would have thought the reward for seizing an opium shipment would be the duty to guard it?
But there are no seams in the housing. I know. It's made from a single piece of aluminum. The entire surface connects to an induction charger. - How did you get the cooling to work? - Actually, Curtis Holt got it right.
The police, the FBI, they would never stop looking for me. I realized that a life on the run is not the life I owe you or your mother, so I disappeared. - You thought you were doing the right thing for us. - Exactly. I've been waiting for that explanation my whole life, and it's like, I don't even know if I believe it.
This tiny piece of plastic has more processing power than most high-end laptops. I'm already thinking about rebuilding it for Palmer Tech. But first? Yes, I found a small vulnerability in the operating system code. I'm sure I can exploit it to open a backdoor into its main system.
Me? I knew you were going to ask me, so I thought I'd beat you to it. Are you all right? A man, a brilliant man says he can put a microchip in my spine so I can walk again. I'm enough of a geek to know science fiction when I see it.
There is still so much we don't know about Darhk's powers. We... we don't even know what their source is. Wait a minute. My powers come from this necklace. Without it, I'm just a wannabe fashion designer living with her foster father. So far, everyone with mystical powers that I've fought has had some sort of totem like mine.
Cutter is... sick. I mean, attacking happy couples? Come on. Well, it makes sense if you look at it from her perspective. Love failed her. And now she wants to fight it.
- The bee is inside you. - Then cut it out! Do you guys have any anesthetics or anything? - Curtis, just do it! - I can't find it, Oliver.
Okay. You can't hack them. Can you coax them out with some kind of... I can't believe I'm saying this, some kind of digital honey or something? Not really, but if they're really built after bees, then.... They function on a special frequency to orient themselves. If we can disturb them, we can drive the colony away.
We immortals tend to stay out of people's affairs. Unless someone owes you money. Do you know this handsome fellow? - Darhk has a similar totem. - It gives him his power. It just channels it.
Andy told me that Genesis was coming. I don't think so. Phil Collins said that they would never tour again. The Old Testament, the book of Genesis. God wanted to give the world another try, so he destroyed it.
I don't think so. Phil Collins said that they would never go on tour again. The Old Testament, the book of Genesis. God wanted to give the world another try, so he destroyed it. He destroyed it with a flood.
I know. I don't know how. Because of his magic. His magic is too strong. I've seen it before, back on Lian Yu, and it's not just magic.
The only way I know to fight the darkness is to become the darkness. And I don't want to be that type of person anymore. I'm running for mayor. And I promise you that I will never stop fighting to save this city. So you're all worried about the extinction of the city. I'm here on behalf of an organization that wants you to make it extinct.
- Too bad she would have been wrong this time. - Hey, come on. - We can't just lose hope here. - You already have. I can see it in your eyes. I just can't believe I thought I was the one uniting this city while Damien Darkh was trying to destroy it.
Someone needs to spread some optimism. It doesn't seem like anyone here has the head for it. Then you know we lost the city. No. I know you're running out of time to get it back.
After three terrorist attacks, we were done, but then, the night before we were going to start packing, Green Arrow appeared on our TV, and he reminded me that this city is worth saving, that my home... that my home is worth fighting for. This guy gave me inspiration. He gave me hope. And if he could give me hope then, why couldn't he give it to others?
And kind of great, too. I think you've been hit on the head harder than you think. No, no, he's right. I can't hack this system. But if the missile's close enough, which it is... We could use the missile's line-of-sight and disarm it.
Get out of this town! "Get out." This heartwarming performance would be much more meaningful if I hadn't seen all of you tearing each other and your city apart. That's why I did it. Humanity is useless. And I wanted to cleanse it of this millennia-old rot that has infected it, and I'm going to do it!
Rubicon; designed to stop any country, including our own, from launching a nuclear missile. Darhk ripped it out. Darhk would control the world's nuclear stockpile. Andy told me that Genesis was coming. God wanted to give the world another try, so he destroyed it.
Darhk ripped it out. Darhk would control the world's nuclear stockpile. Andy told me that Genesis was coming. God wanted to give the world another try, so he destroyed it. - He destroyed it with a flood.
- Yes. - Yes. Okay, we're busy. HIVE is behind the explosion at Havenrock. They stole a cyber weapon called Rubicon and now they're using it to harness the world's nukes, so we have less than 24 hours to stop it or the world will see the sequel to "Wargames."
Are they? He's not wrong. The world is falling apart, just like Star City. I mean, it's worse than it's ever been. Only because Darhk's been trying to destroy it for a year.
Time is older than man and infinite. But in the here and now we help it to think. Time needs us. Some of us more than others. Primary. living, breathing cogs in the wristwatch of time. We keep it moving, stable and in sync. Tick, tock.
- Are you sure you're a real doctor? - You're right. We need a trigger. - What are you doing? - Your file from J.D. Peoples. I kept it.
What do you want from me, Aaron? I want you to understand. It doesn't have to be that way anymore. There's only one way to stop the clock, Cass. The Witness destroys people like me, the ones who stop time from collapsing in on itself, but we can't keep it up forever.
(LOUDLY) Don't let them win now! Don't let them steal your soul! TALIA: If anything, I have purified it for him.
- BATWOMAN: Get her! (LOUDLY) So she's won again. KATE: Nightwing explained it to me like this: Once the programming is destroyed, you can't reset it.
No. Do you feel guilty? Not really. I don't see the world the way you do, Christian. How do I see it?
There is a loaded shotgun pointed at your back. Do not turn around and do not move! Drop the gun! Don't think I'm gonna tell you again! Move it.
In the dark depths, it was a ray of hope. Do you know why I keep watch here? Why I hide in this place while the others live in the light? Once all the gods formed one. We took all the evil of this world and hid it... in this box, Pandora. The task of guarding it was given to me.
We have to shield it somehow. Jen? Let her go. I won't tolerate any more interference. My power is mine and no one will steal it from me again.
It was the uniform of the eighth Virginia regiment. Much of the Eighth Regiment died... ...at the Battle of Monmouth, but some committed desertions. There was an entry in Franklin's notebook. After Washington captured a deserter... ...the Sisterhood of the Glowing Heart tarred and bandaged the prisoner... ...with infernal materials... transforming him into a creature known as the Eternal Soldier. Revere must have put him in charge of protecting Betsy's flag. When we tried to take it down, we woke up the soldier.
- He was a Freemason. - Right. During the war, the British captured artifacts everywhere. From the Capitol, the White House, and other important places. Like Paul Revere's house. So before Betsy's flag could fall into the wrong hands... Key took it somewhere safe.
There must be something to calm him down. Only I can do that. This power has sealed all drainage grates, windows and ventilation shafts. Mystical energy barrier. Nothing can penetrate it.
We need a creature. And we have one standing in front of us. - Nice try. - What would happen to me? The dark energy we draw out of you... would be directed at the barrier and break through it.
The barrier, destroy what you created With my remaining strength I plead to you by your name Joe. He is in pain. What's wrong? I can control the power of the beast, but I cannot direct it.
I don't know what I hate more about you... the way you talk... - ...or the way you treat women. - I'm glad to help. I know the value mortals place on love. I take your love... and turn it into pain.
It just takes time... and distance. No. I should wake up every morning feeling like this, remembering every drop of blood I shed. Do you still have that memory machine? The one you used on the Strucker boy?
The one you used on the Strucker boy? - Daisy, stop. - Put me in there. I bet you're already thinking about it, aren't you? To refresh my memory. So put her in here.
- Daisy, stop. - Put me in there. I bet you're already thinking about it, aren't you? To refresh my memory. So put her in here. Make her my bed and bring every memory, every detail right to the surface where it belongs.
- And. Your concerns about their tactics have been noted and will be passed on to General Maxwell upon his arrival. However? He believes the tactics are appropriate given the situation. They will destroy the city and our ability to govern it.
Georgie. Father, please come back. We are desperate. Father. We need to eat, Father. The bakeries that the rebels haven't taken over are all closed. I can't offer you bread or milk, but if you have a message to a rebel, I'll deliver it.
- Not at all. Well done. It doesn't get any better than that. Just stop defending your old show. Millions loved it!
- The series is being discontinued. Wait, what? Why? The series is exhausted. It's not right to milk it for all it's worth.
They break our fence. Once a week we clean up the bodies. Everything okay? He had a pickaxe in his hand. He was swinging it and...
I would try to do something... Do something different with my life. Something... something better. You want to give up the farm? Well, I'm only renting it anyway, I'll be broke because I put all my money into the barn, but what the hell.
Well, I have seen the world after all. It is beautiful. Smaller than you imagine. Yes. I just wanted to make it better.
I know you don't want to kill me. Want is irrelevant. I serve Ra's al Ghul. Do you remember the move? You taught it to me.
Because Geronimo is not a terrorist. He's an ad guy up in the Green Zone. Snyder's trial was a farce. The only thing Geronimo led was a clever street art campaign. Some down here rallied around the message, used it for violence.
The drones fried my congressman, but they spared this guy. Tell me you can find him. He landed here for a reason. There's got to be a local connection. I'll find it... and then I'll find him.
It's worse than I remember. The rage. The hunger. I'd like to blame my anger on Finn, but it's gotten worse since I came back. I never learned to keep it under control.
The Strix are becoming fewer. It's back to the day-to-day Nola business. I'm afraid our vacation plans have been put on hold. Three of our higher ups are missing, including Fukuda, Bailey and Flynn. In the wake of Aya's death, you can understand our concern, although you don't seem to share it.
Kol is tied to the candle, whatever our two love birds say, our witches will be able to hear. I don't think a few minutes of privacy is too much to ask. I don't give a crap about young love. They have a job to do. You better finish it.
For better or worse, you're connected to that nasty coven. That means if I take you out... The sisters go down too. How are you gonna work magic? I'll draw it from the candle that keeps me here.
A Tibetan singing bowl that I put in a dark object in the 19th century. It's like an echo chamber. With Finn's blood, we can strengthen his connection to Vincent. But like everything of mine, she has Klaus' ex now. - I may have to pry it out of her hands.
With Finn's blood we can strengthen his connection to Vincent. But like everything of mine, she now has Klaus' ex. - I may have to pry her from her hands. Cami's my friend. Since you can't be nice, you stay here and I'll go get her.
He deserves the torture. Besides, you know how much I love setting things on fire. Klaus, when you said you wanted to work together for Hope, I wanted to see what that looked like. And now I do. I appreciate you helping me save the wolves, but if there's a chance to make Finn an ally, you should take it.
Well, my friend was one of those consequences that you don't care about. He's hurt very badly because you got sloppy. You're just so sloppy, man. So yeah, I'm gonna get the church. I'm gonna make it a sanctuary.
- No, that's the wrong answer! - No, no. I know this is war, but I have also lost many friends. Today I need your help. Then you shall have it.
The same power that was used to create Lucien. Once I have it, I can make Lucien vulnerable again. So, what's the problem? Everything comes with a price. To take the power of the elders, you must steal it.
Is that what you want? You realize that if you become like him, it will only add to your already considerable misery. Lucien cannot save you from yourself, nor could Tristan, nor could I, for that matter. You have spent centuries in an attempt to cure your madness, and yet you are still no closer. You hold your wicked tongue or I will tear it from your wicked skull.
What if I'm a liability? I've trained, so I can hit a bag, but in a real fight? Cami, here's a lesson about being afraid. If you do the things you're afraid of, all that fear is for nothing. You either turn it into anger or you walk out the door.
- And what would that be? - "If you want to paint a picture of the future, imagine a boot stepping into a human face - over and over again." My point exactly. The situation is bad enough. We don't need to make it worse.
A four carat Burmese ruby. The necklace has a special meaning for Bane. A gift for his lover at the time, Camille Belcourt. - Camille and Magnus were together? - Warlocks get around a lot. Magnus bought it in 1857 for the proceeds of his London home.
Magnus bought it in 1857 for the proceeds of his London home. Now the jewel is enchanted and warns the wearer of demons. Beautiful. Magnus longs to get the necklace back. Offer it to him.
- Yes. W0 is my sphere? - Which sphere? My snow globe. I told you to leave it in the car.
How's your research going? He is a teacher. A tutor for young Per Degaton himself, it seems. You say that like it means something. After the death of his father in five years, Per Degaton releases the Armageddon virus, which decimates the world's population, making it ripe for conquest.
I have seen the world. - What have you seen? - Salvation. - Heaven. - It really exists.
You should become a therapist. Okay, fine. I'm just saying you should listen to other people. I'm listening to you. Play around with the ladder for a few minutes, do what you can't help doing, and give it back.
And... I didn't leave him because he keeps me happy and loves everything I do. I'm making a silly bag out of macramé. And he says, "This is a masterpiece." You know? I just don't want to wear it.
She said it so many times that I went to the eye doctor. I like your pipe. -Thank you. -It's cool. I like having it on my lips.
So what does it matter what they think? It shouldn't. I love my father and like his act, but.... She could be a lot better. Sarah loves her.
Two things. First, it's sausage night at the waffle place. All you can eat. Second, how do you think it went out there? To be honest, I was worried about the poop, but they sort of gobbled it up.
-Stop playing dumb. -Ok. -Do you know how you looked? -Ok. -Do you know? -I hear your criticism and I appreciate it.
Let's do it. We're risking everything, aren't we? We're against the Clave, against the Shadowhunters.... Valentine wants to destroy the world. We want to protect it.
That's quite a lot of cream. That causes a lot of mucus. Oh, no. We don't drink that. We flick it.
[Father on screen] We want chocolate! Give it to us! [Father on screen] Yes! [Laughter on screen] [Father on screen] We'll give it to your sister.
If you have any recordings, it would help me a lot. I am much more capable than the cops. We still have a camera. Or we did. We hid it somewhere where it wasn't allowed,
We hid them somewhere where it was not allowed, - and that's why we didn't tell the police. - Where? - Up there. - And it's still there? Yes, we tried to get it down.
- We share the drilling rights? - Yes, sir. China is investing more money... ...but we supply our drilling technology. - Should we really be sharing? - They're trying to steal it anyway.
Get involved. But Tepper's not talking voluntarily. Reyes has him by the short hairs. And he's had plenty of time to make his version watertight. We've got 12 hours to shake them.
You won't believe it. Holy shit. Why are the Yakuza digging a hole? Give me the flashlight. - Did it hit the ground?
A man like this city needs. Because, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this town needs help. And it needs it now. Not tomorrow or next week or the day the corruption that has been rampant since Wilson Fisk is defeated and the police department finally recovers. We need it now.
They refused to take action against Savage because he is not a threat to the timeline. But if he comes into possession of future technology.... It means he would manipulate the very same time that the Time Council was created to prevent. So ultimately they do nothing about the destruction of the world that Savage caused. As far as I know, the Time Council was on the edge of the timeline and it seems these dumbasses are just managing to hold it together.
The whole time I was wondering why it was so difficult to find you in the course of history. It was because you were moving through history. So you just came to learn that this is one of many things we have in common, Gareeb. We're both doing what we need to do to save the world. Subjecting the world to your rules does not save it.
You are not a ghost. You have to come back to the world. And I will, after we take out Savage. I became Atom to make the world a better place. And I'm sure saving it counts.
In 2175, less than ten years after Savage conquered the world, Earth is attacked by a warring race of aliens from the planet Thanagar. Without Savage to unite the worlds under an unusual rule, this is what is coming to the world. - This is the work of Savage. - No. This is what happens on Earth when Savage is not there to guide it.
The source of all our information about the timeline. - Why didn't I know about this? - No captain does. The existence of the Oculus is known only to the High Council, along with its greatest secret: the Oculus is not only our window into time, but also lets us shape it as we wish.
It looks like your friends have put you on the back burner. How long do you think you can stay in power if the Time Masters won't help you? I'm afraid not for long, but they've equipped me with this time ship. I no longer have to rule this world, Chay-Ara. Now I have the power to change it.
It's not that you're afraid you don't have power over Chloe. it's more that you're afraid she has power over you, but neither of those things are true. - No? - No. Humans don't have power over us. We give it to them.
Mr. Morningstar. - Yeah. Ryan Goldburg, Kimo's manager. I wanted to thank you for posting his bail. You know, Kimo never would have been able to pay it.
- The FBI is taking over. - We're going after the same guys. - We're in charge. - Okay, how do we get the wings? After the raid, you get them back after 30 days.
Amenadiel found Dr. Linda. Wanted to control me as an angel on her shoulder. I wonder how my angel brother comes up with such a devious idea. I wanted to protect you. I told you I would ward off any danger whether you saw it coming or not.
Let's make a toast to Dr. Linda Martin, therapist to the Corporeal. That should be on the door sign. He seems to have real problems. I'm having a hard time getting through to him. You play along with the metaphor without quite accepting it.
Detective Decker, step away from your vehicle. Put your hands up and walk calmly towards me. If you do not... I repeat, if you do not, we will have to shoot you with our new bazooka. Actually, we're finally going to use it, so step on it.
And yet you call me a threat. (SCOFFS) Hmm. When I was a little boy, my sister and I were once allowed to accompany our father to the movies. We saw the movie The Day the Earth Stood Still. It was about an alien, like you, who came to Earth and threatened to destroy it unless people finally lived in peace with each other.
And for bait, half of you will do. J'ONN J'ONZZ: It's me you want, not her. You may not have a soul, but we have a telepathic connection. I'm reluctant to use it, but you leave me no choice.
The guy can't be knocking all day. He's obviously not home. You're gonna have to pay for that pizza. I don't have any cash. Can't you pay for it?
Just pull yourself together. Don't be too you-ish. -Jewish? -You. Don't say anything against country clubs. No references to your manifesto! And not a word about the BP oil spill and what it can do to crabs.
Hill was ambushed at home yesterday, wife and daughter were there too. Are they okay? Yeah, but he wants to know who's offering the bounty so it doesn't happen again. - Sure. But there's something funny about this accountant he asked me to check out. According to the professional guild, he got his license eight years ago, but only used it for income until four years ago, nothing after that.
"I did... When... When Jeanette came over, she didn't.... She brought the yellow cup that.... She didn't want to kick the ball back, but I said.... Because Brian's cup is red, that if you.... if you don't have it now, then you don't have to have the blue....
Introducing myself to a bank. That's the best way to be remembered. If you really want to stand out, send them a thank you card. It's more personal than an email. Write it ahead of time and drop it in on your way out.
It's okay, Barry. Don't worry about it. I just wanted to pull out the details, go over them again. A high school from Camden was on a field trip near your workplace when two girls approached you. One of them took your hand and put it on her chest under her shirt. So did the other girl. Then they ran laughing to their friends.
The whole world will follow this process, and each of our discussions and decisions. All the more reason to follow the jurisprudence of Nuremberg. Yes. As I said, we face an enormous challenge. I am confident that we will overcome it.
So: Isabelle Blanchard was walled in alive. She starved to death and died of thirst. She scratched into the stone wall with her fingernails, trying to escape. The door must be here, right behind it. Have it opened and then let me know.
You can believe me, Marion is innocent. Nothing. Let's go. Something's not right. If Marion has the page, she must have hidden it with her.
I don't want to leave any stone unturned here. Agreed. But right now we have more urgent things to do. Where is the box? There it is. We can't let it get away!
Maybe a hundred. I should kill you on the spot. These facilities are meaningless if we can stop the master. You said the cargo was at the Tremont Avenue facility? But they moved the crate before we could get to it.
Sure. But the worms do not serve solely as disease vectors. They also seem to be the core of their nervous system. I'll never eat pasta again. Coffee? Turn off the microwave! Okay, turn it back on.
There is probably a small chance for that. I know you want to hear something different, but.... Any chance is better than no chance at all. And if that chance should come my way... Then you should take it.
I'm just saying you can't judge me. Didn't your girlfriend just leave you? - Really? - I'm pretty sure she did. Hey, Harry. Wait, so if your app gives you eyes and ears all over town, why don't you use it to find the next Ms. Right?
I'm fine. We have to go. Vorza will call for backup. All right. We have to move the body before someone discovers it.
-No. I have to go. -Grace! -Sir, you need to pay your bill. I was just about to bring it to you.
Not if Conway has to fend off the public. Think about what data they already have. When you sold us this, it was a last resort... not the only one. Getting surveillance authorized doesn't hurt. Whether we use it or not.
- Norman. Hey, calm down or we'll kick you out. Hey, get your paws off me, man. - I'm just looking for my buddy, man. - Shut the fuck up or I'll shut it for you.
I don't want to sit around anymore. You weren't sitting around last night, you must have been beaten up. That was an old thing, nothing to do with what... It did. You have a gift, son. I want to help you use it.
I should probably show you houses. But first... ...check out my super cute apartment. My MTV pad. Paul and I always wanted a vacation rental. You're welcome to use it, Maria, since I'm your best friend from the Midwest.
The guys from Meta Beta are tough guys. They call me "Shower Bear." They pass me around. One time... I came back from my room and found a turd in my Mets cap. "Put it on," they said.
Not a euphemism. And look what we found... your violin. Play it and see if it still works. Mom, I hate this violin. Burn it, please.
Because you already have everything. You have a hot English boyfriend. You're Jewish, which is really cool. And I need this part. I need it bad.
That was just my patented black Sarah Silverman humor, "nobody knows if I'm serious or not." You assholes! Maria, you can have the part. I don't need it.
Stay strong. I am weak. You married a weak man! Give it to me. Give her...
-This does not help. A Himalayan vessel in the shape of an elephant skull. I use it to rinse the mucus out of my nasal cavities. -I found it in the kitchen. -Then I hope I threw it away.
Really? Awesome. -The quiche is great, Mom. -Thank you. -I think it's fucking bland.
Wicked. -The quiche is great, Mom. -Thank you. -I think it's fucking bland. -I think it's delicious.
"Dearest Frankie, I heard these brushes are the ones Picasso used to paint "Guernica". If that's not so, I want you to know I had a lot of fun sleeping with two Spaniards to get them. But really, the postcard is the most important thing." Oh my! LOTUS GALLERY WORKS BY FRANKIE B. "I rented the gallery, hang it full.
Your wife said for almost 50 years? That's right, people know me, they trust me to make it something that can be used in a variety of ways and that makes money but doesn't look like a damn Vegas on the coast. So what do you have for me? People come here because it's one of the most beautiful places in the world. They want to experience that beauty here, but they want it to be pristine, they want it.... pure.
It's called "Velocity-9." That's an erotic name. What is it? It's a speed drug. Jay took it when you were on Earth-2 to save the city from a metahuman.
I have gathered you all here because I need your help. The future of the world is in danger because of Vandal Savage. You have turned your back on the institution you swore to serve. The Time Masters refuse to take action against Savage because he poses no threat to the timeline. The Oculus gives us not only a window into time, but also the ability to manipulate it.
Savage still has Carter and Kendra. - This is a time ship. - A small gift from our friends. I no longer need to rule the world. Now I have the opportunity to change it.
It's just a suit. But the wrong one. I noticed his embarrassment and wanted to spare him further embarrassment. That's why I tried to save the situation. If I were as highly decorated as you, sir, I would wear my uniform all the time and never take it off.
I don't want to see my wife today. Ludwig, please. Let's prepare ourselves for what's coming. No one knows how much time I have left in this world. I'm not spending it listening to your lies.
- That one, man. It's three bucks. - Is that the melon from the fridge? - Yeah, it's been eaten! - Yeah. You ate it.
Replacing drugs or alcohol or porn with a "higher power" just exchanges one crutch for another. That's a sad way to look at it. Why don't you just tell these people the truth? Maybe we just need to accept the world as it is. What about making the world the way we want it to be?
What about Penny? There must be something we can do. You have to read between the lines, Quentin. Jane's doll wasn't special because she looked like Jane. She was special because of where she came from. Jane's mother gave it to her before she died.
More energy than I have ever felt. - It felt good. - It felt dangerous. The reason you treat magic like a drug is because the people who taught it to you act like drug dealers. They buy it and they sell it and they fight and fuck for it.
That is not the only way to live. It's the only way I've ever known. I'm a pretty good magician and I do this. There are good people out there, Julia. People who are trying to learn from the world and make it a better place.
- That is true. But you have to be a monster to defeat Hitler. Did Jock give you the box? Yes, sir. - What's in it? - Shall I open it?
But you have to be a monster to defeat Hitler. Did Jock give you the box? Yes, sir. - What's in it? - You want me to open it? Unless you have X-ray vision, open it to tell me what's inside.
I told her, if so, we'll make sure the law goes through. Would you hand me a towel, please? Meechum's hand. What? I traced it down on a wall...that was a while ago.
You got the access. You were supposed to tell me what people wanted. They didn't know they wanted jazz until they heard it for the first time. I can make them like the music. But I can't compose it.
So I can get parole. The meeting's starting. What's the matter, Mac? The shower's still not working. Bungalow 3. They ought to fix it.
The French police found five cartridge cases, but only three bullets. One in Sabine, two in the wall behind her. And what exactly piqued your interest in a case two years old and nearly 6,500 kilometers away? Mason left his facial recognition software on our computers. I used it to search online for images of your father.
Where are you going? To the bathroom. Do you want to come with me? I like Raina, but her signature on the petition is problematic. The imam who circulated it has made countless inflammatory statements about this country.
When you're out, I'll just take you to a clinic. - You need help. - Okay. You can take me to the clinic when this is over, but I think you need help now. Where's my bag? I threw it out here.
Hello. - Time to open your package. - Now? There's an identical can in the senator's bag. Replace it with the one you're holding.
- Why were you outside? - I followed you. I didn't think you should be out there alone. I had my own gun in my duffel bag. I registered it when I got to Quantico.
- I followed you. I didn't think you should be out there alone. I had my own gun in my duffel bag. I registered it when I got to Quantico. I was going to unregister it when I left, too.
What if they disappear again and you never get the answers you seek? I know you, Shelby, and you will always continue to ponder. When I lost my father, there was so much left unsaid. You have a chance. Take it.
I helped to build them. With my own hands I helped to build it. To build what? The nuclear weapon. You must find it.
With my own hands I helped to build. What to build? The nuclear weapon. You must find it. Please. You must find it. Quickly.
Zero negative, I am a universal donor. I'll still have to check, handsome. You're pretty banged up. You may be bleeding internally. And what about his bite mark? Keep it clean.
Listen to me, Vincent, I'm begging you. I can no longer act illegally, and neither can you. We've been over this. But we have a lead. And Morgan has promised to pursue it so you can prove your innocence, but you'll have to turn yourself in first.
That was a devious clan. It is a devious clan. Sorkhatani ordered my sister Ogul Qaimish to pledge her allegiance to the House of Tolui. She refused. So they stripped her and bathed her in boiling oil before peeling off her skin and flaying it off her like leather.
That's how stupid we are. It's not bad. Milo's. That watch is worth at least 10 grand. You want to keep it?
The watch is worth at least 10 grand Do you want to keep it? I don't know. You know what? You should have it.
They're not testing you, Vincent, they're testing us. It was my case, my turf. Great. So what am I supposed to do now? Return the gun? Pretend we never stole it?
461 Pell Street, in an hour and a half. Chinatown, the Triads. Don't give them the gun. You can't let a Triad member go free. I'm gonna have to hand it over if we're gonna make this work.
Chinatown, the Triads. Don't give them the gun. You can't let a Triad member go free. I'm gonna have to hand her over if we're gonna make this work. Or we can switch them.
Haters hate, bakers bake. Cake in the morning. What about this cake? My class made it for Hunger Action Month. Shouldn't they eat it then?
What about this cake? My class made them for Hunger Action Month. Shouldn't they eat it then? No. I took it away so they could learn the true meaning of hunger.
You must have felt like you were at the pool every day. Hot dad brought his son over late, and I had to flirt with him. Did you come up with ideas? - Yes, I did. A compliments board is a great idea. I think we should dedicate it by complimenting each other.
Valentine is... His stele. Where is it? Back pocket. Get it.
Let me guess. She's wasting it agonizing over Snow White. You need to talk to her. She listens to you. - Tell her to let go of this feud. - She doesn't have to let it go.
You have to talk to her. She listens to you. - Tell her to let go of this feud. - She doesn't have to let it go. She needs to end it.
I tried, but he doesn't take firsts. You're just his type. That's why I'm sure you'll come up with something. "But where's the door, Martin?" "There's always a door to Fillory if we really need it."
Braxton knew about Muirfield since his time at NSA. He said he had a foreign client who was interested in Muirfield's services. Turning people into killing machines. Ecklund was supposed to buy out Muirfield, and you determined the formula? No, I improved on it.
We are ready for takeoff. The energy is very weak. It has been asleep for a long time. So have I. Let's see if we can wake her up.
Absolutely not. Do not seek Jace through the Parabatai connection. It weakens you both. - Or cut the connection. - Jace has already weakened it.
- I will help you. On one condition. - What condition? You don't go too far. Your bond with Jace can withstand a certain strain. But promise me you won't let it break.
We need to wake her up. She is very fond of you. She's always been like my second mom. She got me the new copy of Battletoads. I didn't care that she had opened it.
Do I need my mom. It's okay. Join me and my son! Pledge your allegiance to me! Together we will preserve our race and rid the world of the demons that plague it.
I mean, really blatant, unique magic. Maybe it would set you free. Forever. She'd have to be pretty amazing. She is. I've seen her.
Marina. Run. Help! Help! There are good people out there, Julia, people who understand the world and want to make it a better place.
God. You are doing time magic to change what you have done. Yes, but only a random natural time witch could accomplish such a thing. I researched everything there is and one day I realized I was looking at it wrong. We don't have the power, but it's not like we have to generate it because someone already has it.
- You had to take the call. I had been trying to solve this case for years. Homicide within the family. A witness came forward. He was going to be deported, we had the smallest possibility, so I took it.
I want to bring people into reality through provocation. That's how they change. He meant well. He blew it. He set the bar so high that I don't know if you can even reach it.
He taught you that you don't have to do anything to be loved. All your needs should be met. He is a great person with a big heart who broke you. He made you think you had a right. If that's not the case, you're confused because nothing works out. You can withdraw your love if you don't receive any, because you are not afraid to lose it. He always gave it to you.
An energy is flowing through you, and you can celebrate that with your voice. Be ready. Open your eyes when you are ready. You can stand up when you want, and you can stretch and feel the energy growing within you. Let it grow.
At one point I felt, "Yes, I can trust. I'm in the right place." Everyone wants to know what happened after the call. I came here carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders. I put it down and don't want to pick it up again.
- Stay the fuck away from him! - I'll do it. - I made a total mess. - Yeah. You really messed up the bowl this time, didn't you? And now you want me to put on the rubber gloves and help you scrub it clean.
Ma won't like that. We'll see how she likes it when we can't afford her liquor when work stops. Hey. Remember how I showed you. Turn off the water and release the pressure. And Jonas, when that snake finds its way back here, you kill it.
It's gonna be tough with Blaze. - Looking for the gun? It's gone. - What? - I threw it away this morning.
- I threw them away this morning. - When you were fast asleep. - Casey, why did you do that? Because it scares me. I'm more scared of what we're gonna do without her.
- Set a trap. - A trap? - On your roof. - What happened? - Tried it out.
And now to the situation in Shady Glen. Authorities are calling it a bath salts incident, and we're on our way to bring you more details. Reuben, right? What about the lemonade? Mom always makes it.
What a turd. "I'm gonna kill you." Are you kidding me? Did you see what just happened, what I just did? Your best chance is to stand up, grab that axe, and smash it into the back of my skull.
He can help us. We save him. He can save us. Mom, we already followed that trail. It was cold. Then we'll follow it again and keep going until we find a hot lead.
His... His teeth can break your bones with one bite. And those eyes... They burn right through your soul when it finishes you off. Nothing can defeat this monster. That's not true. I know exactly what kind of beast it is... and how we can defeat it.
Great God. We must send a warning. To cover our asses. Kenneth, it should come from you as chief science officer. Send it to the prime minister.
We need to send a warning. To cover ourselves. Kenneth, it should come from you as chief science officer. Send it to the prime minister. He won't read it, of course.
To back us up. Kenneth, it should come from you as the chief scientific officer. Send it to the prime minister. He won't read it, of course. The important thing is to have it sent.
Kenneth, it should come from you as the chief scientific officer. Send it to the prime minister. He will not read it, of course. The important thing is to have it sent. I'll send it to Downing Street.
Donna, I don't think you understand. There will come a time when you have to choose between yourself and them. And I'm not going to let you screw up your life with either one of them. You know what, Louis? If they come after me, so be it. But until then, if Mike and Harvey need my help, I'll give it to them.
It doesn't matter if Forstman finds out or not if he doesn't have someone on the inside working for him. What are you saying? I'm saying that if they want me to point a finger at somebody, that means I'm holding a gun. She's still alive. Did you think I was going to let her die?
What are you saying? I'm saying that if they want me to point my finger at someone, it means I'm holding a gun. She's still alive. Did you think I was going to let her die? No, but I thought you might give it away.
She won't take the email back. Shit. What did she say? What the hell do you think she said? She said that she knows you're a fraud. She's not going to take it back, and now that she's found out I was a part of it, she can't see me anymore.
The sight of me is repulsive to her. Louis, I know you feel bad, but right now Donna is under pressure. What do you want me to do about it? I don't know, but if she doesn't take that email back, and they find her-- No, they won't find it because she sent it from a general faculty email because she's ashamed, just like she's ashamed of me.
Since you made me come all this way, I figured I'd save the taxpayers some money by hiring an intermediary. An intermediary for what? For your fiancée. I'd like to ask her a few questions. Get out of here. If you want to hand over a warrant, hand it over to her.
I did not report. They found me. And I'm not pulling any associate crap. Then what do you call this pathetic excuse of a candidate list? I call it unavoidable.
And no one plans to risk their career for a job that might not be there in a month. But they could if you convince them to. - Louis, I can't do that. - Sheila, please. I came here once before with the hope of a second chance, and you denied me it.
If you don't do something, he will. Jack, I don't often go outside for my coffee, but when I do, it's because I long to be alone for a little bit. I came out here because I figured you wouldn't want anyone to hear what I had to say. Are you here to tell me you can't do the job? No, I'm here to tell you that if you want it done, you're going to have to reach into your wallet.
And now there's an accusation that he took entrance exams for people. I can't believe it. I took the test myself. And I have a responsibility to protect the reputation of this university. And what exactly do you propose to do to protect the reputation of this university? By eliminating all threats to it.
If I lose because of my decision, then I can handle it. If I lose because of yours, then I can't. It's not just about your life. It's about all of ours. Like I said... it's my decision and it looks like it.
Please, these people need your help. I didn't sign up. They found me. And I'm not pulling any associate crap. Then what do you call this pathetic excuse of a candidate list? I call it unavoidable because our students can read.
Because I have never been ranked on any, and I am the best legal secretary in town. That's a funny answer, Ms. Paulsen. But if you were doing such a good job, how can you allow someone who has not even been on the interview list to come into a room alone with Harvey Specter? I'm sure you remember that list. After all, you wrote it.
- Hello? - Are you in the office? It's Thursday night. I'm watching my show. Then record the hell out of it, because I need your help.
No, he doesn't, and it's time for him to put down the clipboard and get in the game. - Harvey, - Donna, this wasn't just some move to get testimony. This is Mike's life. It's his story, and he needs to be the one to tell it.
All my life I've wanted to be a lawyer so I could help people like Clifford Danner. People who have no one else to fight for them. No one to believe in them, but instead, as a lawyer, I've merely worked day and night to move money into the hands of rich people. I was given a gift and I squandered it, and I'm ashamed of it.
Mike, they could take days. I don't know what to tell you, Harvey, but I can't leave here. It's okay, Harvey. Listen, Mike, if we're really out of time, I don't want to waste it here,
- It could have been zero. - They were... Why couldn't you just wait for the verdict? Because I'd have to live with it my whole life. I made a choice, and I... I can't turn back time and change it.
Wait a minute. I want to talk to him. Call him. - I don't have the number in my cell phone. I have it.
Who is with you? Listen, call me when you're alone. I need to talk to you. Call my number. I don't know it by heart.
If you want to touch, you have to let yourself be touched. No one has cracked the boat yet. Is that it? - Almost. The Ben box is still there. Didn't you open it?
Someone's in the house. Hey, Lee, I'm not staying here alone. Where's your gun? Where it should be, locked away in a drawer upstairs. Do we have to go back and get it?
And I find that sad. You're addicted to affirmation. You care too much about what others think. It's about what's important to you. You need to find your voice and listen to it.
Between you... Tell someone who wants to hear it. Ashley, you should... - Take a deep breath. You need it.
He is a liaison for... For? Look, I should only tell you as much as you need to know, okay? I got a number. I need you to trace it.
There is a runway here? The mining company had it built before it was shut down in the 80s. Pirates have been living here ever since. This island is basically a safe haven, as long as the water doesn't get in their way. But they use it too inconsistently for the government to be willing to take action.
And who are you? Good afternoon, Assistant Director Mayfair. Chief Inspector Fisher, this can't be good. Your unfounded negativity toward the OPR from the Department of Justice represents your poor leadership skills, Bethany. My negativity is not unfounded, and I do not direct it at OPR.
No, for that you have to enter the stratosphere. The plane. Yes. They have a Pegasus rocket. They want to put it in the fuselage of the plane.
Is he... - I don't know. - I'm gonna go find him. Wait, wait, he's buying us time, okay? So let's use it. - It's on.
He told you all that on a postcard? This is not how it was supposed to end. You are ZOMO. Isn't that right? We only found your prints on that postcard because you wrote it.
It belonged to your mother. She bought it after you were born. It goes well with your eyes. Where did you get... After she died, some of her things were sold. I knew how much this necklace meant to her, so I bought it.
We will be ready. What is honest, and what is fair. Chang. You have your security clearance. Senator Haas signed it herself.
It's the CBRN team. The bomb is gone. Emergency team confirms. It's gone. The terrorist has it.
- Maybe none. Still, we need to get the bomb as far away as possible. He's right. Thousands of people are here. It's our only chance. We could take them to the firing range.
Are you no longer worried about blood pressure? According to your medical records released after the election, you have no problem with blood pressure. Accordingly, you are not taking any medication for it. So I don't understand why Liam O'Connor blackmailed me into switching pills you never took. Did you ask a question or are you accusing me? I'm giving you a chance to tell me the truth before I go all out to prove it.
Go. First a bomb threat. Then a forced evacuation? I always knew it was you. Put the gun down, Ryan. I'll put it down when you tell me what you're doing with my computer.
A whole city dedicated to his new religion of the sun. But of course, his people didn't want to be sun worshippers. They just wanted their old gods back. - What did they do? - When Akhenaten died, his people left the city and abandoned it to the desert.
Half the day we gossip among ourselves, wondering what is this fantastic object that your men are carrying forward. And they think there is a desire for this story? Mr. Carter. Right now you are the talk of the world. You could give me a laundry list and I'll put it on the front page.
I could not save his. I couldn't save his. You had a couple of scenes today with the prop gun. Any idea where you put it? - I didn't put it there.
This is what you get when a TV show worships at the altar of youth, chicks and machos running around screaming in a school where apparently shop class is the only place to see something wooden and poorly constructed. This one needs to remember the emotional truth of her character. That's the essence of acting. It's a search for truth. Tell me more about that truth and where to find it.
- Puberty was hard for me. Think of your hips as a bowl of fruit. Don't tilt too much to one side or the grapes will fall out. Okay, now second position. Do you remember it?
- Beth. - What are you talking about now? That's why she tried to kill me. Beth put a gun to my head. And Evie put it in her hand.
I want to leave and I don't even have a credit card. Here, take mine. No wait, you already maxed it out. - It doesn't matter. I didn't need it anymore.
We do. But we can't repackage you, unfortunately. - What's that? - I'm sorry, Evie. This absolves Brightborn of any wrongdoing and protects the patents from legal interference. I developed this technology, and I'm not giving it up.
Maybe we'll under-deliver for once, or maybe one of our own will look at one of them the wrong way, or maybe they'll just decide to renege on the deal. Then it will end badly. And when it does...the kingdom will fall. I had a family. I lost them to this world.
I'm not saying he fucked her. Why else would he? The guy is weird. He came to see me last week. We were having drinks, and a cockroach came out. And instead of stomping it, he threw it in the blender.
The machine is in a permanent splinter sequence. Now that we have the array, we can prevent the machine from dispersing any more temporal energy. If we can't shut down the core, this machine will turn this whole facility into a giant crater. Crater I get. Look, Mr. Deacon, you have to make sure they shut it down.
It's over, all over. The woman has a daughter. She wants to find her little girl. How are you going to get out the front door? - I'll open it for her.
Sight, sense of smell, sense of taste. Also the sense of hearing. Old injuries heal. I had a bad shoulder. I can feel it again now.
Nothing. Just military stuff, most of it blacked out. Even your real name was blacked out. Where's the file, Axel? Give me the goddamn file. I left it at the base.
At first I was skeptical, but within these walls we are freed from the horrors of the outside world. Or we hide from reality. I had a friend like you. Walls and barricades meant safety, but eventually the real world will come crashing in. If there is a better alternative, I never found it.
He made sure that it was not just in one place. He made sure that there were multiple hiding places. - I don't know why. - Hey. It's okay. We're gonna find her, okay?
To change the world. But in your case, that's true. That is your purpose. And you're going to do it. But you're not saving it.
Back. Doc... Die! A wooden box, 1.50 m by 0.60 m by 0.30 m. Doesn't ring a bell. I saw you take it.
There is a cold going around. I sense a struggle. Deep inside of you. Your soul is torn. You have to protect it.
"And because rhymes with jack..." Hi there. "Linda, the first time I saw you, I knew you were one of the only Lindas for me." Yeah, that works. 2. Q: Got it. Strap on old chainsaw, let it howl, done.
I only have to see Baal once and ram it down his throat. Even if he then skins himself, I can find him and take the chainsaw.... - up Baal's ass. You're the daughter I never had. Your chainsaw will never stop Baal, no matter where you drill it.
A large part was here when it started. Some wanted to escape, but there was no escape across the border. What do you want? We want your help. We need you.
No. Do you know who I am? The Baby's Choice Award winner, and he's won the Oscar seven of the last 15 years. That's right, that BoJack Horseman. The guy you send your paper to, even though I never subscribed to it.
Driver, I'm starting to feel uncomfortable with you. Yeah, Todd. What are you doing? Did that creepy driver ever give you his number or tell you that you remind him of his dead ex? Or repeated your address like he was trying to remember it?
And you steal our food. You know too much. Smoke bomb. -Why a plum? -I thought it was a bomb.
Maybe he'll be worth something someday. You're sweet. Don't waste it on people who don't deserve it. You want this plum? I found it in the kitchen.
Penny? So on the bright side, she looked really okay. Until she saw you and freaked out. But she'd probably be fine if you hadn't shown up. The wound was healed before you showed up and ripped it open again. - All the pain was there again.
What? All I ever talk about is my boring, great life. How are you doing? Well, I'm doing this new series now, The BoJack Horseman Show. -Maybe you've seen it...
... Look. ... You have to look! Oh, William. There is beauty in this world. Arnold made it so, but people like you spread in it like smudges!
There is beauty in this world. Arnold made it so, but people like you are spreading in it like smudges! Okay, I don't know who the hell Arnold is, but your world was ... built for me... and for people like me. Not for you. Then someone needs to fumigate it.
We are at almost 3500 meters, at the continental divide. It's a beautiful spring day. The snow that falls on this side melts, flows into the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. The snow on this side flows into the Pacific Ocean, completing the circle. Travis took the idea of the hydrological cycle and turned it into this epic journey.
The hydrological cycle, which can also be described simply as... the weather. We take a lot of the magic out of things when we give them names. It's this beautiful, choreographed cycle of life. If you stood on the moon during the day and looked back at the earth, you would see a blue planet. The ocean captures the sun's heat energy and turns it into a solar machine.
- I've never been here before. - Sure, you have. You even brought me here once. Of course, back then the whole town was buried under sand. Ford must have dug it up again.
- ( To Dr. Ford. ) - ( Cheers! ) Translation and times by jog (c) 2016 [ Subtitle Edit 3.5.0 ] Drop your weapon! Drop it!
As I said before, I am desperate. This is my last attempt before I go to a psychic. But, hey, you've got your hands full, I'll just let you know how the crystal ball goes. Leave the file there. I'll take a look at it as soon as I have time.
Remember that map? Of buried treasure, underground missile silos - or whatever you thought? - I didn't think anything. The map is for Danni. Remember Danni? A customer of Danni's wants it.
Sorry. I can come to them, or they can come to me, whichever is easier. - I'll call them today. - Thank you. To new beginnings, Mr. Mayor. To me and to this city. How the sun shines when you look at it in peace.
We were watching you. We waited. Now we are here. You are in possession of an incredible power. We need it back.
Davie throws the salt. That's enough, thanks. Angie. Ben. "Then God cast lightning upon the city, "and set it on fire with all its inhabitants, "and devastated the land with fire."
What about the church? What, you don't know yet? - It's being torn down. - What? The preacher gave it to Mr. Quincannon.
- It will be demolished. - What? The preacher gave it to Mr. Quincannon. He was supposed to. He gave it to him?
Retreat. Is that it? All right. Put the gun down, Donnie. Don't make me use it.
Why? How do you think Fort Rozz got out of the Phantom Zone? For decades, I searched the Phantom Zone with my mind for a way out, and then I found you. I activated your space capsule. And linked it to the prison.
To most, I'm an assistant at CatCo Worldwide Media, but secretly I work with my adopted sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anything else threatening. I'm Supergirl. HANK HENSHAW: Previously on Supergirl... She discovered a story as big as Watergate, and they were eager to pitch it to my biggest rival.
Help the Martian with the remaining handcuff. No need. Let's go. J'onn, Supergirl. Be careful! Save them for me!
I just want to enjoy a little longer. And you will. I promise. Your hand is still on my knee. I can put it away.
Because of her, the apartment became wonderful. She made it a real home. If it had been up to me, it would have looked like a student flat. I lost her in the first attack at the stadium. It was completely destroyed, full of smoke, and I couldn't find her anywhere.
But to take the past for inspiration I think is wrong. Britain is no longer that of the previous coronations. The assumptions of when my father-in-law was crowned, 17 years ago, are out of date. That's why I'm proposing an adjustment to the ceremony. Let's make it less pompous.
I have often seen such things. You're talking about your experience with soldiers wounded in war? The emotional recovery can be harder than the physical, but there is nothing more important than hope. A city employee found a body off the highway. - They're taking it to the lab now.
That would be wonderful, honey. And you know what? My guitar is supposed to come today. My harlequin guitar, direct from Esteban. Will Esteban deliver it himself?
- A lycanthrope. What's that? A bloodbath on steroids. Make sure the isolation cell is available. We're gonna need it.
And we thought we were dead. Not a single bullet hit us. We thought it was some kind of miracle. But, this story can be interpreted two ways. The way I like to interpret it... we weren't supposed to die that day.
But, this story can be interpreted in two ways. The way I like to interpret it... we were not supposed to die that day. God or time or whatever... didn't want us to die. Thinking about it has helped us through some tough times. Believing that... there's something out there to help you. What's the other way to interpret it?
He had never embroidered anything in his life. What about my father? What was he like? He had a strong sense of self-preservation... and ambition. He built this machine and I made it work.
The report mentions a place called Titan and a man called The Witness. - That's it. - We go back to 1961, we find Kirschner before the Mossad does, we find Titan, we find The Witness, - we cut the head off the snake. - That's not going to stop the storms out there. We save the world by killing the One who destroys it.
We stop the paradox, we put time in order? It is more a hope than... certainty. - Are you all right? - It's come to this. If only the world had a better physicist to save it.
The cosmic treadmill. A time machine driven by my super speed. At least in theory. Flash and I designed this machine, but we haven't been able to test it. If we activate it, it could rip a hole in the time stream, causing a chain reaction in the universe and swallowing up everything in space and time.
I want to show you something. Do you still have all the money from our account? We did that with it. You bought a gallery? We bought it.
- We have an arms contract. If the stock exchange learns of a possible claim, we will lose billions. If he sues, it will be for involuntary manslaughter. Let's draft a reply. Let the mouse write it.
My condolences on your loss. I don't think he is our killer. He seemed pretty shaken up about his nephew. Someone with a death wish might want to send a message to Mr. Boss. And we just delivered it.
Hey, you know what? I took some makeup classes at this community college. - I could give you a little makeover. - She's beautiful, Ma! Yeah, so is the sun, but you can't really look at it.
! To brave the elements! Keeping the family dry! That's what ! What's the plan, Luke ? There are no bad ideas, but waving a metal shovel around in a thunderstorm might have a downside, so let's put it back in the garage, okay?
You won't even touch me. And then I find Beth's uniform? So tell me, okay? What do you even do with it? Do you sniff it, cuddle with it, hang it on a coat hook and dance with it?
Through folk art. More specifically, through chainsaw sculptures. One uses a chainsaw to make elaborate sculptures of a bear, or perhaps an eagle, from whole tree trunks. All rather kitsch and extremely loud. I retrieved my chainsaw from the attic and was oiling it when the fire broke out.
The funny thing about this toothbrush is that it disappeared at the same time as the test. The private lab that compared the two samples blames this on human error. We think the impostor had an accomplice, someone from the lab, who ran the DNA test on her own counter sample and then made the toothbrush disappear to prevent future testing. Frankly, Captain, I am surprised you don't find this theory more compelling. I find you devilishly compelling, but I also think I am the only parent in the room.
I will not miss you. This pathological liar brain is going to get me in trouble. - I can feel it. - Not on me. I know the truth when I hear it.
Maybe I should go down and help him fight. Look. Can I be honest? You want power. I offer it to you.
He could have seen the agent enter the code and then gone back at any time. Let's go get some... decent coffee. This is the apartment the air conditioner fell out of? It was pushed out. Yeah, I took a look at it.
Any idea as to the brand? There was a canister at the scene, but the label was burned off. What's going on? Blaine's dad had a cabin up in Whistler. I finally got the Canadians to let us search it.
But what? - I don't know. Excuse me, but I really have a business to run. But come back when you have a court order. The door is right where you left it. Behind you.
No! What? Where's Janko? We were fighting over the tranquilizer gun, and we were rolling around, and it went off, and.... He had her set up for a massive overdose.
It was self-defense. You saved both our lives. Maybe we just don't report it. And we... We, we smuggle the body out and dump it in the bay.
Maybe we just don't report it. And we... We, we smuggle the body out and dump it in the bay. Is that how you do it? You dump it in the bay under cover of darkness?
Yes, absolutely right. I understand. A deposition is not rocket science. There are five simple rules. If you don't understand a question, ask them to repeat it.
The old rifle range at Quantico? Isn't it closed? Yeah, ten years ago. Every class that went there had a unique baseball cap. So he put them in the back window to look real to cops and other agents.
She's scared, Andrew. Can you hear her breathing? Do you remember feeling that fear when they rolled you up in that gym mat? You see what power is... Holding another person's fear in your hands and showing it to them.
- I do not judge you. - We saved your life. - There may be a solution here. A weapon. It sounds like we can use it to kill the beast if we find it.
I can't teach it to you. Most people can't do combat magic, except for spontaneous bursts. Like baby trapped under the car situations. - But you can do it on cue. - Yes, because I've been learning it for years.
Everything. There's this thing about you, Q. You actually believe in magic. - So does everyone. - No. We all know it exists, but you believe it.
There's this thing about you, Q. You actually believe in magic. - So does everyone. - No. We all know it exists, but you believe in it. And you just love it, plain and simple.
I was really in the dark on that one. Okay, so what does Jane have to do with the Beast? Remember the gift Jane got in the book "The Girl Who Told Time"? Yes, Ember gave her a watch and a locket. Ember gave her the ability to play around with time on a cosmic level and Jane used it to create a time loop.
- 39. 39 times. And if you die a 40th time, at least I'll never have to hear you ask me that question again. Jane's dead, Quentin. The loop is over. There's no one to restart it.
The loop is over. There is no one to restart it. - So that's it? - That's not my problem. My problem is that I am strong enough to recognize a time loop, but not strong enough to change it.
Due to Mr. Cooperman's medical condition, cross-examination did not occur. Denying the defense this right is prohibited by law. It is unfair and unduly prejudicial. They are therefore instructed to ignore Cooperman's testimony entirely. It does not go into the record, and it has no probative value. They must disregard it altogether.
- This request just came in. - Should I send out a memo? - No. He likes surprises. I'm not giving up my permanent position. I'm not giving it up!
Oh, yeah. - She's, uh... She's adorable. - Yeah. So hopeful. I like her work, too. Yes, you should see it, in her studio.
- Wait! Wait! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Give me a napkin! Please, please, please! - Dry her off.
System restart. System restart. System restart. System restart. I was on a mountain yesterday, and I painted this landscape here. I thought it was so peaceful and beautiful. I wanted to show it to you because it's so...
Wow. The last time I saw my grandmother, the most exciting thing was watching the ash from her cigarette get longer and longer and wondering if she was going to fall into her pudding or not. Did she? Yeah, straight in. She just ate it with her.
Since this is our session, can I say something about the damn music? That infernal elevator music. Is that music? It feels like. If so, please turn it up so I can recognize it. Otherwise, turn it off. You're driving me crazy with this Guantanamo torture shit.
Lopez, Takata, you're up. Here. This pause. What is it? Sorry to disappoint you, but this is normal for Takata.
She's extremely focused, competitive as hell, and closed off from everyone. Kind of like you were back in the day. Hey, hold on. We didn't find Bardot's tactical gear in his room. No, we have lockers that they can store it here.
I do not remember. What's in the bag? Why? I don't know. You put it on the table.
Good. You learn quickly. Thank you, Captain. We found the murder weapon. A garbage diver found it in a garbage bag.
A trash diver found it in a trash bag. The gun was wiped clean, but the bullets in the magazine were not. Listen to this. Prints match Bardot. If Bardot loaded it, he must have been the one who stole it at the academy.
-Where you say it... -Which is? -Storage. Inexpensive, reliable energy storage. How do you store heat without losses when you don't need it?
-Which is? -Storage. Inexpensive, reliable energy storage. How do you store heat without losses when you don't need it? And how do you get it back when you need it?
It is trapped by quantum mechanics, but can still move freely. It will never stop. No friction, no energy loss. This material can conduct electricity. So we can transport electricity without resistance, we can store it and use it when we need it. Loss-free.
You have ruined us. -I didn't mean to. -I should take you to court! You have no legal authority over the company. You sold it to us.
The evidence that has been collected is.... not normal at all. Okay, why don't you show me what you have? Cam finished her analysis of the meat. It didn't dry out because of environmental factors. But because the killer removed the skin, soaked it, and then scraped off the fat.
I'll run a tox screen. Ms. Warren, what do you say regarding the surgical rod in the victim's right femur? Remodeling? I'm referring to the rod itself. There are no nails to hold it in place.
They do not want to be afraid of it. Who embodies them, brings them to life. Their uncle, Edward VIII, almost did the same. Imposed his individuality on the institution. Brought it to life. And he almost destroyed it with it.
He is more like his European father than we are. Machk. Why are we going to Malcolm Brown? It's reckless. That's why Samoset was killed. Watch your tongue, or I'll cut it out. Why don't we go to Kamenna?
The lead with the witness paid off. He's making his statement to Marcus right now. After that, we'll set him up with a sketch artist. Where are you? I went back to Lily Cooper's office at the social. As soon as we get a sketch, I'll send it to you.
You owe me big. It's payday." "I know ways to kill you." It was sent from a suppressed number. Let's see if Vikram can trace it.
We will meet again. If I mean the least to you, your brother, your family, you will not walk out that door now. Save a good bottle of bourbon for me, brother. We're gonna need it when we sort all this out in about 60 years.
-Erik? Jan says you agreed to divide it into three equal parts. So you each have five million. But if you want to buy more than one soft ice cream without the state getting suspicious, the money has to be laundered. Here's what we'll do: You're going to set up your own garage. We can call it "Bimse's Dented Cars."
I have only heard rumors that you are not as good an investment as you claim. Are you thinking of withdrawing your investment? Yes. Maybe we are. Or at least reduce it.
Look at that, you must have completely shaved. There you go! Um, one question! This is my first hot tub. Is that supposed to have a rat swimming around in it? Yuck, really? Get it out of there!
What did you want to make clear to me? That they see me. What's so funny? We started a movement. We should lead it too.
It's not far from here. Do you want the address? -Thank you. That's nice of you. -I'll write it down for you.
I have repaired everything as discussed and put the chassis in order. -Does that cost extra? -No, it's part of the service. We'll send you a collective invoice when I've gone through the other cars. Send it to me right away.
We are talking about 440 million kroner. It would be helpful to get that out of the way. And what do you propose? We invest the missing amount in a new company to be founded. Then we let the company pay back the amount and close it again. We then let the amount go under "Other expenses".
Still, it doesn't change what happened to you. The person who did this will be punished appropriately. Having said that, you still need to fix this thing for me. Our site has been offline for far too long. The good news is, once you get it back online, you'll get your money back and in time, God willing, your health back as well.
Darlene has never been good at asking for help. But on the other hand, who is? The admission of weakness. You have to recognize the simple truth. The only way to fix a weakness is to expose it first.
Extinction is always the answer. We destroy parts of ourselves every day. We photoshop our warts off. We edit the parts of ourselves we hate, and modify the parts we think others hate. We curate our identity, chisel it, distill it.
We need the gun. And I'll talk to my truck. Good news! She took the bait. She's getting it for us.
- That was a good one. Oh, my God! Is that Wyatt's gun? You knew where it was the whole time? I was 12. I threw it away in a panic.
I haven't seen a buntline special in years. May I? You may not. I think I know that gun. Wyatt Earp named it the Peacemaker.
I have no idea. Silence. Silence. How did you know the answer? I read it.
I know. Everyone in life has a story. Yours... is a very short story. Put the girl in this box. Close it up and go to the customs guy.
Then we'll fix things with your wife, won't we? You have a gun. - It's for my work. - Yeah, but you have one. Yeah, and I try not to use it.
They took him out with this big hook. The big blue hook. And there was blood everywhere in the water. Me and my brother were terrified. From the time we were supposed to go to swimming lessons, we skipped them.
Huh? You killed Bill Primm? I set aside your share. - A million dollars. You earned it.
"If you see a good move, look for a better one." Elliot. Be careful. When I finished the move, I also made sure the site wasn't generating traffic exclusively through TOR. Stop here and don't move. I just had to get it indexed by a few search engines and with the added advertising, on the best advertising sites, it is now discoverable by any scumbag searching for "Thai girls for sale".
The problems with the economy also affect the prison budget. You've been lucky. Don't screw it up. This card is worthless on the outside now. Do you want it for sentimental reasons, or would you like me to dispose of it for you?
You were lucky. Don't screw it up. This card is worthless outside now. Do you want it for sentimental reasons, or do you want me to dispose of it for you? Dispose of it.
Mark's hacker was able to read data from the card from the old man's garden. - It came from the hotel? - Yes. The data is readable until it's overwritten. I know who used it last.
Where did you live before you moved in with the Callaghans? With friends. And then in a cheap hotel. What did you do with the key card to your hotel room? I think I put it in a bowl on the counter.
And then in a cheap hotel. What did you do with the key card for your hotel room? I think I put it in a bowl on the counter. - Why? - They didn't take it with them.
I think I put them in a bowl on the counter. - Why? - They didn't take them. I just told you. - I put them in the bowl.
- They did not take them. I just told you. - I put them in the bowl. - No. You said you thought you put them in.
We need to redesign the front page. I want a new lead. "Rebel rabble defeated at Monmouth; Washington withdrawn." Delete the first column - replace it with advertising.
Find anything? I understand, Dean. The longing in your heart... I feel it, too.
Yes, who does something like that? Who makes a schedule for their family? Don't go in there. I need my wipe-off cream. I can't find it.
But this will not be the case with all. You should put this beauty in your garage. - I don't have one. - Oh, really? Just out of curiosity, don't you have a garage because you converted it into the guest house where your grandson is taking a shower?
Well, I thought she had died. And I was no longer myself. Yeah, the pain was... it was very intense, so I started to self-medicate, and then my work started to suffer, and I made these little mistakes. Little mistakes at first, and then much bigger ones. And finally my ineptitude was so obvious that.... I couldn't deny it.
- Hear, hear. Now, I think Major Burd has something we'd like very much.... - A message from the field camp. - After lunch. A note from General Washington that you should read it at once.
The Islamists give their children only such. Other dolls are impure. They would offend the image of God. And...? They brought their children to school.
That propelled him onto the bookshelf, disturbing its balance so that it fell on him. That was an accident. I had to give a presentation to the astronomy community. Scott took my medication and I had a panic attack. This community meant everything to me and I lost it because of him. - So you killed him.
Well, I have it on very good authority that you are seeing the Major again. We are not together. Do not try to deceive. I know your acting. Either you help me give the major his punishment, or you will get it.
- No. Where did that come from? - Come on, Pinky, get out of here. - I got a wallet. Let's run it for prints, see what we get.
Look at that. Look at the mantel. The hourglass. Yes, it's not in the Christmas photo, which was taken just a few months earlier. It could have been purchased recently, or they put it there from somewhere else in the house.
The hourglass. Yes, it's not in the Christmas photo, which was taken just a few months earlier. It could have been purchased recently, or they put it there from somewhere else in the house. Except we know that the perp stayed at each crime scene for an hour. What if he brought it with him as some kind of stopwatch?
Then the next president. Delphine, you wanted the weapon to be kept safe in a house of men of knowledge, didn't you? I am from the bunker. That's how I knew how to find you, through your communication with Henshaw. So now if you clear the way, I can get it there for you.
The latest victim is Vice Principal Jemma Moore. -What is this? -That's why we're here. We need access to all files, records and memos. If there's a trace, Thomas Shaw will find it and destroy us.
The confession of the girls connects them with Iosava, then we let the Germans arrest them. If the Germans cooperate. Valerie? It's your operation. Do not ask me for my opinion, only to reject it completely.
On our wedding night there, uh, he was very rigid. Didn't want to kiss me. He just asked me to close my eyes. And I did. And then he took my hand, and he put it on his body.
It belongs to me. And if you try to destroy that bond, there will be consequences. For both of you. How's your clothespin? Are you wearing it right now?
Uh, Lee, I just broke your lamp. - I'm sorry. - I'll give you a hand. It's all right, it's all right. Just, uh... Uh, I knocked it over with my arm.
Is everything okay? - No, it's not. - What's wrong? - I want my necklace. - Mom said I could have it back.
Danny didn't threaten me, okay? He wasn't dangerous. There are things you can't understand. I don't care what shit went down between you, but he's my uncle, and that necklace is the only gift. I want it.
Where are you? Will you call me back, please? And tell me what's going on? Okay, bye. Bye. Bye. The shower's been leaking for a year. I can't get anyone to fix it.
No. It was a seahorse. - A sea horse. - Yes. - I was looking for it just the other day.
-You live there, Kirk. -I'm not lost. I started a new company. A ride-sharing company. I'm calling it Ooo-ber.
Eduardo will make you coffee. -Can he do magic? -He cooks on the stove.... He's really... I'll put it back.
Back from London? She's back there. You can't get a hold of her, can you? It's all very simple. We plant an egg in a body, fertilize it, then we have a baby.
To put it this way. I had the idea that my familiarity with Nick Cave and Radiohead and a little Stravinsky were half the battle. I'll never forget the day I realized that part of the composition course was composing. I did it. I wrote a melody, I added harmonies, I wrote alto and bass clefs, I wrote whole notes and half notes, quarter notes and rests, and even though my composition will never be heard in public, through this experience I can also see music when I hear it.

I wrote a melody, I added harmonies, I wrote alto and bass clefs, I wrote whole and half notes, quarter notes and rests, and even though my composition will never be heard in public, through this experience I can also see music when I hear it. Before, I only heard it.
To him yelling at me, punishing me, putting me down, telling me how much I had disappointed him. Nothing came. Finally I plucked up courage and looked up at him, and he was standing there with a pretzel. A huge pretzel with mustard.... And he handed it to me and said, "Come on, let's go."
I'll go to the therapist. I'll do the franchise if you want it, I'll be a cook at your Inn. I'll give you back the cabinet. I only took half because you insisted. I thought someday you'd take it back.
Just like in real life. That's your house, that's the jeep, that's the hospital where you took me back then. -Oh, God, that's... -My fingertip. You picked it up and put it in your wallet.
-Oh, God, it's... -My fingertip. You picked it up and put it in your purse. Which, by the way, was brand new. We went to the hospital, the doctor sewed it back on.
-My fingertip. You picked it up and put it in your purse. Which, by the way, was brand new. We went to the hospital, the doctor sewed it back on. -You soon cut it off again.
My heart. It has been bleeding for quite a while. And only your voice can save it. I fell in love with your voice the first time I heard it. I was 13 years old. Maestro Rivera brought it with him.
I fell in love with your voice the first time I heard it. I was 13 years old. Maestro Rivera brought her. They sang "Tosca." I heard it over and over again.
Marcus? Hey, I thought you guys would like to know that Vincent Bader's body turned up. The coroner's looking at it right now. The body was found wrapped in a tarp and tied with rope. A couple discovered it on a trail in Forest Park.
All I want is her. You desire what I already have. And have for months. And her name isn't Shippen, it's Arnold. We've had a home wedding. Do you still want her?
He said if I didn't watch Robeson, he would reveal my affair with Anna Strong. The death of my son would be the last thing I'd see in my life. He finds out everything about you, secrets, and then he ties it around your neck like a noose. I thought I heard your last lie. No, I can prove it to you! I have proof, I'll show you.
They somehow got past the foundation! Hey, sis! Here we go again. We need that gun! Wyatt Earp christened it "Peacemaker."
- Forget it! - Wynonna, get the gun! - What? What gun? Where's the gun? The boss said I'd never take it from you.
Where's the gun? The boss said I'd never take it from you. I'll show him. No! Put it down!
The boss said I'd never take it from you. I'll show him. No! Take it off! Get rid of it!
- In a way. - This time you represent the law, and innocent people depend on you. - Your gun. - Your gun. You can't get in with that. You'll get it back, Earp.
May I? Come on. I certainly won't do it here, I promise. First, I would stop by the hardware store. Buy a nice big plastic sheet, lay it out nice so I don't make a big mess.
Are you okay? Yes. All right. - We're gonna get you home, okay? - Wait a minute. If you know where my merchandise is, get it right now.
Oh dear. Close the restaurant. I'm sorry, I... I saw the fire and I wanted to help. If a pan's on fire, just cover it.
Xavier. Let's leave it at what we know. Have you noticed that it can get quite windy here? Have you noticed that the weather vane on the square always points west? I took it down, oiled it myself, it works, in all directions.
No, no joke. I really think I might have found a body. What do you mean, you might have found? - Is there a body or not. - I don't want to look at it again.
- Now I know how she feels. - Pretty awful, huh? This guy seems to have bathed in toxic waste. Well, what the killer actually used was hydrochloric acid. The local police were smart enough to neutralize it with baking soda.
If there's a problem, you can stop an outbreak by pressing a button. A genocide... Mass murder! It was the army's idea, not ours. When the technology became available, they wanted to use it.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries".... The Phoenix Stone is filled with vampire souls. - The stone gives the sword its power. - Stefan... As long as I have this scar, Rayna will hunt me. What if I told you I could transfer it to someone a little more deserving?
Oh my god. My God. Where does the acid come from? Preserved lemon. Val added it to the braised rabbit.
Yep. Why are you printing out an evidence log? Well, I couldn't find any pictures of the alley from the night of the shooting, so I thought I could go through the log and see if anyone mislabeled the files. But the alley was not part of the crime scene. I mean, the police cordoned it off for a quick search, but....
Forensics finished their investigation of the alley. - Okay. What did they find? - Nothing. Alice's DNA isn't on the fire escape. There's no smudged fingerprints, like she wiped them down.
- Yeah, I am, but I... I thought the guy was just trying to grab my ass. I didn't know he was stealing my wallet. What a bum. Can you tell us how it is that your wallet is in your possession, given this photo? I found it on my doormat this morning.
I didn't know he was stealing my wallet. What a bum. Can you tell us how it is that your wallet is in your possession, given this photo? I found it on my doormat this morning. I thought I just dropped it when I got home.
You don't think I had anything to do with this, do you? I think until you can verify your whereabouts, you should probably come with us. Let's go. Who doesn't know their wallet's been stolen? And then miraculously gets it back?
Let's go. Who doesn't know that their wallet has been stolen? And then miraculously gets it back? The zombie girl story stinks. It does, but we can't disprove it until we place it at the scene.
The four purses from the crime scene all had the victim's blood on them. Christine's purse also had the victim's blood on it. So Christine's purse was with him when he fell and bled? Most likely. Well, then she pulled it out of his pocket and left.
Probably rubbed off during contact. So this wasn't normal zombie makeup? No. Microskin is expensive. Applying it is trickier than regular makeup. And you can only get it from the manufacturer.
So this wasn't normal zombie makeup? No. Microskin is expensive. It's trickier to apply than regular makeup. And you can only get it from the manufacturer. He used it because he needed it. Right.
As soon as she passes the mailbox across the street, leave the bag on the bench and walk away. I'll make the drop. No one moves until she has the bag in her possession. She won't take the bag until the car is out of sight. She has it.
Yes. Test. Test, 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3, Test. The new karaoke machine. Anyone want to try it out?
I just don't know what I would do if I didn't work in the medical examiner's office. Well, there are always alternatives. Science and medicine are not just parts of my job. They are parts of who I am. So I don't know who I would be without them.
I had just lost my wife. I couldn't lose my stepdaughter as well. What exactly did you do? Clair and I made up the story that Michelle fell down the stairs. I took the murder weapon straight to the storage facility and hid it.
I was waiting for her to come home and we.... She had called 911. And why did you keep the murder weapon? I didn't know what to do with it. I didn't have time to destroy it, so I just hid it, figured I'd take care of it later.
And why did you keep the murder weapon? I didn't know what to do with it. I didn't have time to destroy it, so I just hid it, figured I'd take care of it later. Is that what you did tonight? I told Clair I'd get rid of it, put this behind us once and for all, but I guess she figured if you found me with the murder weapon, you'd be convinced I was the m--.
Until you do the autopsy. Very funny, but true. What about the white rose? Was she wearing it? No one I interviewed mentioned it.
I guess the bomb is not in there? We're not sure there was a bomb. My team would still have to find a detonator or casing, consistent with conventional explosives. The bag's clean. SpuSi can have it.
I just got the DNA results back from the victim's body. Are we any closer to identifying him? It's really hard to tell. It says the sample came from the inner thorax, just behind the sternum. Because that's where I took it. Yes.
So, do you think I should get a rough shell? You have a rough shell. Maybe even a rough undershell. Don't talk about my subshell. I suggest you keep it.
What is used for what? It is an insulation most often found in old commercial buildings. Like the evidence storage building. Yeah, except the only place we found it was the evidence box. Well, that means the thief must have left it on the box when he opened it to steal the cutting board.
They are molting. They wear colored plumage only during the mating season. Let me tell you what Rihanna should have done. Thank you for helping her get through this really terrible time. She would not have survived it without you.
It's hard to say. But it doesn't rule him out as a shooter? No, it doesn't. All right, well... we're widening our search for the gun. Maybe he tossed it when he ran from the scene.
I'm seeing three patients today. Okay. Good for you. - What's the news? - I don't want to spoil it.
Doesn't mean they knew each other. But they could. Okay, so Kate Mason knows Ben Norton and kills him for some reason. Then she asks her brother to help dispose of the body? Sam Mason embalms the body to buy himself time and - disposes of it when the next funeral comes around? - But then what?
You know, if you move back here, I could help you with T.J. No choking. I don't know, ma. I'm just putting it out there. It's your decision, and I respect it.
- Do we have a deal? - We have a deal. Then the lead is yours. - Bobo already has the lead. - Not according to Constance. - Did he lose it?
They underestimated Ward. They went after his daughter, then Wynonna took Peacemaker, and everything changed. So Bobo will try again to get out with the heiress. But what is the leadership? The heir is the leadership. He had the leadership and lost it to Constance.
The prophecy. "The willing heiress with the revenant of her choice at the winter solstice." Peacemaker. The heiress is none without the weapon. I have it.
What have you done? We're almost over the line. This is going to hurt. We all played here under a poplar tree. The year Willa disappeared, lightning felled it.
What about the chest? Do we hide the chest? Why should we hide the chest? There's nothing in it. Yes, I know, but what if they know Uncle Felix had it?
Do we hide the chest? Why should we hide the chest? There's nothing in it. Yeah, I know, but what if they know Uncle Felix had it? If they know Uncle Felix had it, then they know he gave it to me,
Why should we hide the chest? There's nothing in it. Yes, I know, but what if they know Uncle Felix had it? If they know Uncle Felix had it, then they know he gave it to me, - and if they know he gave it to me....
He wants the best for you. For all of us. - I know, but I... - You asked for his help. He's giving it to you.
I was starving, not thinking about it. When I realized what I had done, I left my food and asked for forgiveness. What happened? He smiled and... held out his hand for me to shake. When I complied with his request, he took my hand and... slapped it on the table.
If Roman and his men find out you're here, they'll kill you. I'm not going anywhere. Maybe you're right, Jeremy. This disease has been with me too long. Maybe it's time to cut it out.
Was that three continents in two days? If you count Berlin. We were only there for three hours. The Inhuman call was a hoax, that was immediately clear in the apartment. - I saw the bong. - I smelled it in the hallway. Jokers.
Teacher killed, house burned FOR ROOM SERVICE We only stole one box. I don't even know what was in it. We loaded it on a semi-truck. We parked it in a warehouse and left it there.
Hello, glad to see you finally... Hello, I'm glad to finally... What the hell? I enhanced her power supply to compensate for the image processing. I've overridden it. Reboot.
- Let me tell you what Gwen said about you. Hey. Where are we with the waste management company? It's a new company called Bullseye. We're not sure who's running it, but rumor has it there's a new player.
So far with requests... It won't stop as long as Roman is alive. You don't have to go after him alone. It's incredible. A natural born witch gets her magic at puberty. - You have it now.
Dr. Saroyan, we are very busy. Is there anything we can do to help? I finished analyzing the victim's lung tissue and found no trace of garbage particles. That means the victim was dead before he came in contact with the garbage. And the only reason a body ends up in the trash is if someone is trying to get rid of it.
Eventually, the boy's landlord packed up all his possessions and gave them to Brandon's father. There's really not much in it. We have the DVD "Full on Nuts," a few old magazines, and oh, yeah.... A whole bunch of burned CDs. Apparently the victim was a big Linkin Park fan. Not big enough to buy their music, of course, but big enough to steal.
Angie, I found the murder weapon. It's a high-end ice pick. - Jesus Christ. Do you know who it belonged to? - Oh, no, they gave those babies to everyone on the team, but I think that's how the killer must have kept them.
I have done my homework, Dr. Hodgins. I know that you would look at the evidence and understand that government forces are backstopping my investigation. I looked at the evidence. I read everything available about the body you found in France, the scout of the last heist, but I did not find a cause of death. That's because we couldn't determine it.
No, but no more ghosts either. I guess we'll never know. You know, I wouldn't have believed it either, and then after Lance died, I saw him, and he told me to get on with my life. And it really helped, so I wasn't trying to be funny or mocking, I just wanted to.... If someone was trying to send you a message, I didn't want you to miss it.
It's something I should have given you a long time ago that you can use to be close to Daddy forever. Lily, we're going to open Gram's presents together! I couldn't wait. Gram left you a watch. The note says, "Your grandfather ripped it off the wrist of a dead German."
But she is Buttafuoco's mistress. Why does the mistress kill the wife? Maybe you should change the plot. Yeah, man. I never thought about changing it because it's... ...because it's based on fact.
Do you know where... What? What's going on? What the hell were you thinking? Leaving his body where it could be found.
He's weird with new people. Stay behind me. - Sure. You know what I call a vagina? - No, what? I call it a Happy Meal.
That's all she sold me. Yeah, that's Carol Fincher's. This is Harper Benjamin Williams' watch. The brother recognizes it, and the engraving confirms it.
Well, who's the biggest guy in the yard? It's highly unlikely he'll just come out to play, but as my younger brother used to say, "Don't fish without bait." Thank you all for coming out. With all the pain our city is in, I think it's fair to ask why we should spend time and money honoring anyone, why we should commission a statue and have a ceremony to unveil it.
That will never happen. The you I know from the future is not that stupid. Soon you won't even remember that you are Flash. And when that happens, this world will become permanent. Time will be set in stone, and nothing will be able to make it go back to the way it was.
"You're a real Einstein." They'll say, "You're like one of the Einsteins." That's so crazy. I can't believe we changed history. No, Dr. Heywood, we saved it.
March 23, 1972, you came out of a motion picture, "Slaughterhouse 5." You loved it, walked right into a big Marine and just knocked him out. You were embarrassed and he laughed it off, said you could make it up to him with a cup of coffee. So you went to Mulroney's and talked, he was sweet and knew the words to every Zeppelin song, so when he asked you for your number you gave it to him even though you knew your dad would be pissed.
You're just... bad at your job. - And you're better? - So much better. You back up roads, you pick up cases at random. You get information on a body, you check it out, and maybe you even kill the thing that did it.
You have to bring me something as compensation. The "Antoinette" file from December 7, 2010. Excuse me? A life is in danger, and you want me to steal a file? Bring it to me by noon.
Because it is not true. It's not reality. The truth is, what's going on between us right now is a damn favor to you. This station is a disaster. I'm doing everything I can to hold it together.
No. No, that is not an option. I love you. But this, this is my decision. And I've already made it.
They are three years old. They should have nothing to do with this world. Lizzie sucked me dry the other day. The girls were at a friends birthday party and Lizzie took Josie's snack bag. I took it back from her and then she grabbed my arm.
Do you really think it was the right thing to take Caroline against her will? One hundred percent. You said you knew what it was like to love someone. And for a second there, I actually believed you. I thought that my love for Caroline was so strong that I would do anything to protect her.
Damon actually did the right thing. Something selfless. We held out in that room for days. Stefan didn't sleep. He threw everything, including himself, at the door to open it.
But we can track their vehicle from our office. Oh, that! That's what I was talking about. "Chapter 10 - Why I never answer prayers, and you should be glad about that." And "Chapter 11 - The truth about divine intervention and why I avoid it at all costs."
You created worlds. I was stupid. Naive. I thought that if I could show my sister that there was more than us, That maybe she would stop being... Being her. But... every time I created a new world... she destroyed it.
- It looks like the sun is.... - Is dying. Why would Amara do that? The sun is the source of all life on earth. Without it, everything will just... just wither away.
What does it smell like here? I don't know, clean? Look, a bottle of wine for us. Don't touch it. Sometimes they charge if you just move them.
That's my middle name. Jameson "Rooster" "Behave" "Big Dick" Bennett. Boy, am I beat. So am I. If somebody said there was a million dollars in the field, I wouldn't pick it up.
What the hell are you doing? You're a good 90 meters from the nearest police station. I'll be back in an hour or two. We had a deal. If there's a story there, you'll get it.
Your body is starting to expel what we have changed in your DNA. You feel it every time you use your... ability. How do you fix that? Stop using the power. Every time you use it, new cells are activated, but your body expels them.
They have him safely hidden somewhere. The fact that he's helping me is just the beginning. I want an army. I want an army like me! And he will give it to me.
Yes, they will. Mitch will. Mitch? Yes. You give that Mitch a lot of credit if you think he's going to discover your little message made of rocks, then still know you left it, and then make it to Caraquet.
Like you taught me. Someone in our organization betrayed my prison visit. It was the only way the Asians could attack us. I'll find the rat. Crush it.
Habib. Hello, Patrick. Boss, we need to talk. All good, all good. My merchandise... I need it back.
I should hope so. Get it for me right now. Okay. I don't have access tonight. But she's... she's in a safe place, I promise. Okay, I'll... I'll get her.
Okay. I don't have access tonight. But she's... she's in a safe place, I promise. Okay, I'll... I'll get her. It's not a problem. I'll bring her to you, I swear to God.
- I finally had to become your opponent. - You were too hasty. A month later, Marseille would have been yours. That would have been too easy. Do I give you power, or do you refuse it?
No, but when he said goodbye, I realized something was wrong. I gave him this little frog for good luck. Who killed him? (AN AST KNOCKS) Before Dan left, he hid a bag at my place. He told me to take it to the police if he wasn't back by July 1st.
Who killed him? (AN AST KNOCKS) Before Dan left, he hid a bag at my place. He told me to take it to the police if he wasn't back by July 1. I'm a cop. Okay. I'll go get it.
- Hello, did you have a nice day? - Yes. I bought you a pizza. Bake it up for you at 225 degrees if you're hungry.
Maybe a sponsorship deal would be the right thing after all. Come on! That too. Sorry about your mural. I didn't mean to break it.
Come on! That too. Sorry about your mural. I didn't mean to break it. I heard different from the kids, they saw you destroy it on purpose.
Tommy, I'll be back later. Good news, Herrera. You know, of all the incredible things you did for me yesterday, the flower is the most memorable for me. Great. I'm glad you liked it.
Good news, Herrera. You know, of all the incredible things you did for me yesterday, the flower is the most memorable for me. Super. I'm glad you liked it. Yeah, I liked it.
Hey, what are the fucking deals? Dude, yeah? Now? I put the list in the wine cellar this morning. I know. I saw it, but...
Who will hopefully find me. It looks like we are on Honshu Island near Kyoto? Yes. How do you know my language? I studied it for many years.
Masako. A pretty name. The shogun asked you a question. Where did you get the armor? I made it.
Kill them. You are completely wrong. Ichiro should destroy the blade after the death of his son. Very well. Then I will destroy it myself.
And he's waiting for me at home. I've mitigated Mr. Rice's injuries. Incredible. Advice from an old man who saw the world change, mostly for the better. If you are lucky enough to find love again, embrace it.
But what happens when a man like him inherits your abilities? We have seen this on countless other worlds. That's why we must destroy your species before the scourge of your planet becomes the scourge of our planet. He's lost it. What if he's right? What if we use our powers not to improve the world, but to destroy it?
- I'm pissed off. - Let it go. You can't do anything about speedsters. We'll see. In a nutshell, Rip had a secret armory. Grey and I found it with Barry's message about the coming war.
Let's take you to the lab. What's that? To test how your ability affects molecular motion. This column is solid tungsten and it's heated to over 2000°C. I want you to cool it down and when we determine how you can do that, we can figure out how best to help you.
Car alarms, transformers. Where's the connection? Yeah, we'll get to that, folks. We've got to keep trying. Maybe someone is drawing power from the transformers and using it to power the monster.
"Come to this earth. Start from the beginning". What about your resume as a world-famous genius scientist? You've got a point there. Guess we're even. When a string is in a knot, patience will untie it.
Who you are. He knows you're Oliver Queen. Should have been out there with you today, Oliver. Dig, you said you needed time. Don't be afraid to take it, and tonight wouldn't have made a difference.
Is that official? If you want a real quote, Ms. Williams, you can go through official channels. This meeting is strictly about the rezoning ordinance. Councilmember, as you know, I am seeking a unity platform, but it is hard for a city to be united when so many zones within remain excluded. We need to include them, allow more affordable housing, give people a chance to start over and build. The moment the money starts rolling in, these families get fleeced by favoritism capitalists.
Branson brought up a new poll, regarding last week, and our approval rating is up, but not as much as I would want. Are you okay? No, not even close. Have you been hitting the bottle again? Well, I'd have to let it go first.
Keep your guns down. So you can just shoot me? We're on the same side. You're out of control. This town is out of control, and you haven't been able to save it.
So if you'll excuse me, I have a class to teach. - Thank you. - Thank you. Dad, what are you thinking? Lars found the lamp and of course he rubbed it, but that makes him a master djinn, doesn't it?
- Thank you. - Thank you. Dad, what are you thinking about? Lars found the lamp and of course he rubbed it, but that makes him the master djinni, doesn't it? But if no one has rubbed the lamp since and I discovered it... that would make me the new master of the Djinn.
You need to call me next time you see them so I can interview them. I need to make a wish list. Oh, my God. I have so many! - How am I going to whittle them down to three? - That's funny.
And you will tell us everything you know. Come on! By the time we had the area locked down, the truck and the treasure were gone, and because you don't know the license plate, we have little chance of finding them. It all happened so fast. That's right, and yet you had time "to sneak up to the lamp, examine it, be held at gunpoint, rub against the lamp, make a wish to the lamp, whereupon a djinni appeared in a puff of smoke, and hit the gangster on the head with a board."
Shit. Don't move, asshole. - Take off the mask. - Take it off or you're dead. Take it off or you're dead.
Please put the gun down. You have to trust me. Put the gun down. Okay. I put it down.
You do not know him! You don't know what he's like! Dr. Monaghan, you say you trust this guy. How well do you really know him? Because I thought I knew my supervisor, too, but he had all the power, and he used it against me.
They're not that close. Who always soothes him when he's upset? Penny, but... Who's the only one who can convince him to take his medicine when he's sick? I tried to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spit it out.
If you had to. In fact, I want you to put them in the order you would eat them. Listen to your gut. My gut is telling me very loudly not to play this game. Guess I could cut the mold off the crab apple, give it a good wash, and technically? the cockroach is edible if I cook it....
- Not really. - Well then. Man, how much wine did you drink? Not that much. I just couldn't until you were gone. The shrimp from hell springs up from the hot spring! You fight it off with the shield.
Taro is running again. - What does that have to do with me? - Taro is too old for Marseille. He doesn't understand the city anymore. He wants to modernize it with excavators.
I don't know what to say. How are you? I'm fine. My hand is always tingling. Sometimes I can't control it.
If this continues to spread, hundreds of thousands of people will starve. And you think there's an animal behind this glass? Well, it didn't come from a plant. And given your work linking mutations and environmental events If there is a link, I will find it.
This... is what Jackson's DNA looks like. Because of the mutation, a third strand has developed. A triple helix? And this structure isn't unique to Jackson. He shares it with the vultures, the ants, the sloth...
Okay? Let's go, Edwards. Apparently, you got my message. Yes. I got it.
I have received them. Of course, it didn't mean you. I hope not, because that sounded very painful. It was very unprofessional. I should have been more careful. Edwards, you should really conserve your energy, because you are going to need it.
Here's the thing. I've had one for a long time. You have a gun. Why? Like you said... for protection. Have you used it?
- Huh? Did you leave your charging cable in the car or...? were you texting or watching TV? No! The police already asked me all that. Yeah, why were you gone long enough for them to open a drawer or a closet or whatever, take out a gun, and fire it?
Didn't even realize she was there. I want to know where she is. - She's in a box under the bed. - It's under our bed? That's where we'd need it.
So, please, do my family a favor and get the hell out of here. Thank you, Dr. Edwards. That'll be all. So it's a simple decortication procedure, except for a slight abnormality. Yes, I'm sorry, I can't take your decortication procedure because I've already taken it.
The point is, we've grown up. Mer and I have grown up. We've been through this. Hell is behind me. I see it in the rearview mirror and I'm not going back.
You have quite an entourage these days. No, Allison, it's not that. I asked you to give me competitive cost estimates on all the projects that Emil Kurtz handled. - I still don't have that list. - I will give it to you in the morning.
The report we read said nothing about a propellant. Probably because it burned up in the explosion. It usually does. But now I think it was a chemical often used in pesticides called nitroguanidine. One of the characteristics of nitroguanidine is a tendency to decompose metal, as well as a very distinct odor like latex paint. The condition of this belt buckle suggests that Krasnov not only placed the bomb, but built it.
- No. Shh. The couch we bought. Yeah, what about it? Do you want it or...
Yeah, what about it? Do you want it or... - Come inside me. - No, it's fine. - You can keep them
-Lock the door behind me. -Ren. Ren, don't go. The door is reinforced. Only a ZMP could break it down.
Torus Manager... Man, why do you keep listening to this propaganda? Know your enemy, my brother. Well, the Pope tells it like it really is. Those who don't know the past are doomed to repeat it.
Torus Manager... Man, why do you keep listening to this propaganda? Know your enemy, my brother. Well, the Pope tells it like it really is. Those who don't know the past are doomed to repeat it.
Torus managers accuse Arctic Parallel of providing safe haven for block leaders. Man, why do you keep listening to this propaganda? Know your enemy, my brother. Well, the Pope tells it like it really is. Those who don't know the past are doomed to repeat it.
Has Olympic size. That's a lot of agua. Or the laundromat. Maybe he needs to wash the mask. He wears it all the time.
Just like you. When all this is over, a new world will emerge. I'll make sure of it. Where's the list? Let me go with the two girls and you'll get it.
- I get it. I know you do. - But, uh... - I get it. I'm still not paying $1,000 for this stupid bottle of wine. - We'll finish it.
Even caught in the act, you don't admit it. No, this is more about you. You broke into my house. If you can't be nice, you know where the door is. Use it.
What does mom always say? Don't rub your eyes. You'll get the germs in your eyes. Don't play with the doll. I'll clean it first.
Listen to me, go back right now! Meng Meng, Mama will be right back. Mom, the pizza's here. Can I open it? I just ordered it.
Then we have nothing to connect her to the beach case. And if Linn isn't behind the murder of Nils Wendt, we're left without a killer in either case. Thank you. There's something about this mark. - Have you seen it before? Where?
Not over them, or around them, right into them. Did you fall asleep, Jim? Yes. Show me. Take out your gun and put it on the floor.
Then give me something to fight that until I find him. Usually it's a trigger that puts you in the hypnotic state. What's the last thing you remember? He took out his watch. - Asked if I could hear it ticking.
There he is, the man of the hour. I got a surprise for you, Butch. Not in the mood. What's in the box? Open it.
- What. Trixie's best friend Landa got a new All American doll, and now Trixie wants one. So what does she do? She destroys her old doll, - and expects me to replace it.
You think everything I say is a metaphor. Now if you wouldn't mind, you're destroying my buzz. - Ladies. - My door is always open in case you change your mind. Feel free to close it.
You want me to smuggle an 800-pound bomb past them? Not the bomb. Just some of the explosives inside it. Getting past them is easy. - It's a joke. The Japs will get it out tomorrow.
Gallo, Gallo, you are like a brother to me. But physically only a little one. You don't believe me? Okay, take the tangerine. Throw it at my willy.
Jerry redid the papers. Apparently, the old ones had too many curse words scribbled in the margins. Is that okay with you? It is to Rooster, that alone is important. The ranch was so important to him that he sacrificed his share to keep it in the family.
- Just now you said he placed the same device. And for a very good reason. One that I'm not inclined to disclose at this time. Suit yourself. If I had a white flag, I would raise it.
- Who says you have a choice? We can expose you to the Iranian Government. Mr. Holmes, there are at least a dozen names on this board that I fear more than my Government. I have a family. And Joshua Vikner will defend his position as rabidly as he fought to keep it.
I appreciate what you do. I know how you work. Falsifying evidence must be hard for you. Desperate times. Sometimes you have to bite the orange to peel it.
Just FYI, whoever brought you here, you're in this bar now. And exactly $100,000 richer. I'm gonna buy that bottle. Don't buy it. If you really want it, we'll steal it.
Whoever brought you here, now you're in this bar. And exactly $100,000 richer. I'm gonna buy that bottle. Don't buy it. If you really want it, we'll steal it. Somehow I feel better about buying it.
8,000 euros. What happened in the forest? I don't know. And you didn't even make up the story. You saw it.
Many images are associated with fire and smoke. I want to know what's behind it. Do you think it might have something to do with his father? We got the cabin from my grandparents. We didn't have anything to rebuild it.
Get out of here. Everybody get out of here. Over there. Come on, close the door. Close it already.
Jin-hee. Jin-hee. Open the damn door. - It's locked. I can't open it.
Mr. Wilson, would you like to see a magic trick? Sure. But I can do it too, I'm not easily impressed. Pick a card. Memorize it, put it back.
I like you. So I am giving you the opportunity to help yourself so that you can be forgiven for the sins you committed today. I know you didn't steal the watch for yourself. I mean, what are you going to do with it? Are you going to wear it to school?
I know you didn't steal the watch for yourself. I mean, what are you gonna do with it? You gonna wear it to school? Maybe. - No. You stole it, and then you sell it, like all the other stolen watches.
I can never collect it again, okay? What was that about a watch? I'd buy you anything you want. Tell her. I took it for you.
I took it for you. I thought it would be cool for you. A watch from this store? No. That I stole it.
- Wow! How can you do that? - Tried it. Impressive, but a waste of time. She emailed the file to herself and sent it to Emma as a "secret friend".
- The camera in the camp. It came from the killer. That's how he knew about the recording. He didn't see us, he heard us. He knew I would take it.
Audrey, wait! Did you know about the party? No. Okay. Listen. Someone's selling it as ours.
He really went over the top with it. I consider myself lucky. I have to tell you something. What? I stole the sculpture from a certain person's studio. Martin was supposed to sell it, but he gave it to you. So...
I don't see so well, but it's okay. - Are you Robin? Yes. I'm sorry. I saw your purse on the floor, and when I leaned down, I must have knocked over your glass. I didn't even realize I'd lost it.
Paula Hawkins Is that your pseudonym? Oh my God. - No, no. I'm the ghostwriter. You know, Paula wrote the first half of the book and sent it out to publishers right away.
All right. It's a five-star hotel with 18 rooms. If a necklace is stolen here, the whole place is treated like a crime scene. You'll blame the maid. You take it to the front desk and say: You found it.
I already found a wallet. What? Robin... Bill's wife. I stole it for fun, because then I don't drink.
What did you do? - I went to a movie site. - Movie site? One where you can watch movies for free. I tried to go to it, but it stopped working.
No. Number two would be prison. You should consider that. -Fuck you! -The mask is a gift. Without it, you remember everything you've done.
She banged her head on the desk. Really hard. Then she knocked me over. That's probably when the bottle broke. She picked it up and started cutting herself with it.
- Neither. This is about your wife. How can you not be interested? You have a safe and effective option available to you. Use it.
Simply the best. She can do simply everything. She is the salt in the dessert. Cynthia plays with inexplicable abandon and sadness. Use her.
There are no signs that recovery is not complete. But there is none for it either. Dr. Latham. I realize that like every doctor who teaches here, you have your own methods. But I assume if I have an opinion on that, you want to hear it.
And we were not alone. The DEA, CIA, Centra Spike and the Army, all under one roof. The universal solution, so to speak, to the Pablo Escobar problem. After Gaviria put $1.4 million on Pablo's head, Colonel Pinzón set up a new hotline. Apparently, he thought Javi and I should take it over.
Yes, Maritza. We'll do it together. But you have to trust me. - Give me the address. - Write it down.
Yes, we have our own. There we can drive as fast as we can on the road, but after that you go to jail. - At 61 km/h. 62. Sometimes 63, but only in exceptional cases. We had thought we could take it with us, like this tent.
I can't remember the title. "Cock Tease." Yes. It was very messy, but Mrs. Bumgarner loved it. She asked you to stand up and read it to the class.
My turn, Mrs. Finley. My turn. I told you I can't play like this. Tara, have you seen the instructions for the organ? I think Mrs. Finley has them.
Casey, stop! Father? Hey, mom. What are you doing up here? Father Tomas killed a rat, hit it with a book.
Freeze, asshole! Come here, you little shit. If it was up to me, you'd be dead already. You think I forgot you threatened me in front of my house? But now we have an agreement. And Don Pietro said we'd honor it. So you have to keep it too.
This is about our ability to tell ourselves that we are truly a democratic and free people. That's how important it is. In return for our democratic rights, we have been promised prosperity and security. Are these promises credible? The coming election is about democracy and how highly we value it.
One side knows when one side is a priesthood and knows how it all works but the rest of us ordinary citizens don't know how it works, A massive transfer of power is taking place. It is designed to ensure that the great mass of people cannot control the government, ever again. WHO IS IN CHARGE? Problem #2: For a democracy to work, you have to know who maintains it.
And at the same time, they give other people the right to fish in the same waters. Ah, that's right, oh yes. For fishermen here, being in the EU doesn't mean that Britain has more influence over European affairs; it means that Europe has taken control of our affairs. We didn't gain power, we lost it.
And these sets of rules pile up one on top of the other, to such an extent that no sane person can have an understanding of all the rules they must obey. You have thousands and thousands of bureaucrats, officials and administrators, and their job is to push paper around, scribble on paper, put rules on paper, pile up more and more paper. All they get is a huge amount of growing phonebook-sized rulebooks and regulations, one after another, non-stop, endlessly. That's actually what the bureaucracy thinks it's for. If they were to compile the list of all EU regulations into one document today, it would take more than two men to carry it around.
The EU has slipped from free trade to favoritism and protectionism. Protection hurts consumers who have to pay more for inferior products. It hurts the industries whose costs are forced higher. In the end, it hurts even those companies that have been protected. Protecting a company from competition does not make it more competitive.
Despite decades of economic decline, the EU elite ruthlessly carry on. They remain impassive in the face of criticism, blithe in the face of popular discontent. But the frustration of ordinary people is beginning to show. We must now focus on building a firewall to prevent contagion within the Eurozone. What you can see everywhere is a conflict between the visions of a rather thin, working middle class that determines European politics and the reaction against them by the great mass of the European population.
My mother didn't have a scar when we moved to Africa, Abe. I was just looking at this old picture. No. My father... He gave me the injection before we left Boston, but... but he obviously didn't give it to my mother.
It was said that they had developed a synthetic, bioactive compound there that allowed them to recreate animals that were already extinct. I didn't believe it... until now. Max. We need a saber-toothed cat. Well then... from the sounds of it, there's only one place in the world to find it.
I am a friend of your son. Jackson is in trouble and I think he may be looking for you. Please. He really needs your help. Hello? Were you able to trace it?
- Sir. - What about the security guard? - Take care of him. I just emailed you the correct formula. Test it.
This is halothane. Stun gas. Whoever's after the DNA is already here. - There she is. - Let's grab her and go.
When my thumb releases this button, if I were you, I'd better take cover. - No. Absolutely not. I need that DNA. - Why? So you can sell it?
So you can sell them? - Don't you have a soul? - After I collect the money for this job, I don't need one. If Davies gets his hands on that DNA, it's over! We have to destroy it.
But that was all in my imagination. Henry didn't know my dad at all. And neither did I. I knew your dad. And, uh... he didn't invent chocolate milk, but he liked to drink it.
You know, I'm starting to think about things. Casey, it's your fault, bro. It's not the writers' fault that the show is so bad. And it's really bad! It's not the fault of the network that airs it either.
Yes, it's for the pocket. It keeps me in practice. - Guitar is still my weapon of choice. - Of course. I haven't heard you play in a while. Maybe you'll bring it along for the ride?
See the brooch my mom is wearing? Very hard to miss. I know what she tells the wife. When I was little, I made four dollars a week doing housework. My friend Amber's mom would take us into town for Christmas shopping. And in a crummy little store, I saw this brooch. I really wanted it for my mom.
My friend Amber's mom took us into town for Christmas shopping. And in a crappy little store, I saw this brooch. I really wanted it for my mom. I was sure she would be happy about it. Now here's what I'm sure she's not telling you. The brooch cost $16. I didn't have enough money on me. When no one was looking, I just put it in my pocket.
- I want nothing to do with it. Ring the bell! We are not professionals! Shut the fuck up! Before we rip it off your face and throw it in the garbage can!
The machine I use is in my lab. Take yours to travel back to where you started. Wait a minute. Where's your time machine? - Shit. - We forgot it.
- Stay here. - Farah, wait. - Stay here! My God! We have to fix the machine and send it back.
Yes! Now you don't have to worry anymore. You have the cat with you. But of course. Why did you take it from the crime scene?
I am on the way. I have a theory. A theory that I don't like at all. But it is my theory and all I have. So... I'll explain it to you, and if you understand it and think it through, you'll....
This dog is extremely important. Because he is Lydia Spring. - Yes. - How was she turned into a dog? They took the soul out of her body and replaced it.
- You killed her? - The shark did it. - And where is the machine? - Here. Here. We put it together, and maybe it's not all where...
Jenk is in your office, waiting for his son to pick him up. I hope you don't mind, but I found something. After Dan shot those wolves, someone set up this website. Looks like a debt website. Who set it up?
And pull down the blinds, okay? What the hell are you doing? Hey! Give me the camera. Give it back.
Grace, before I met you, no one cared about my art. Or me, as if I mattered. I love you, baby, and I'll do anything to regain your trust. I'm working on a surprise for you. But you'll only get it if you come to the show tomorrow.
Okay, I'm coming with you. What about the trial? Stan's got it covered. For evidence of Grace's innocence, I'm not gonna sit around and wait. I'll help you find her.
- Did you get the physics problem? - What? Oh! - Don't "Oh" me. Fine with me. Although, I didn't really understand it either.
Incredibly nice, but also very gentle. As if my mother and I were glass figurines. I'm not made of glass. What he did back then is of real great significance, but if we let it rule us, it will do it to us again and again, for all time, and I certainly don't want that. I play folk music because I love it.
I'm not thrilled about working with a mass murderer. Delaney? We changed the course of history. Yet she's developed the most dangerous weapon of all time. -If the military hadn't kept her...
Go. I've already closed the valve, so you don't have to pretend. Major dickless didn't have the balls to do it himself? You mean Major Gleason, who took your antimatter? No. We stole it from him.
You will be delighted with the remains. You will miss many graduations, anniversaries, weddings. On the birthday of your children, ammunition will rain on you on the mountain. Still, every second will be worth it. Even if this love gets you down or kills you, you will not let it go.
Then how do you explain what just happened? A kryptonite-laden cyborg almost killed Kara and me. Talk to me, J'onn. A shipment disappeared four months ago. We've done everything we can to find it.
Hit them hard and fast with special ruthlessness. They never suspect that. Mort, the sea air is very good for you. I know. I like to have it in my belly.
Quiet, Flora. I'm hiding from my parents. Are they coming? Do they have the bell? Can you hear them?
Knock, knock. Anybody home? The parents. The bell. And they will ring it.
You can't lose. Come on, let's go. King Julien killed him, murderer! The excitement is palpable. Can you feel it?
You are a wicked little butterfly. A bad butterfly. King Julien, I can't hold him much longer. Sure you can. Dorothy, watch the movement. I call her the "Total Diva."
I said. Let's get started. Yes, of course. I offer this flower as a symbol of peace. I hope you will accept it and we will end the war and have peaceful peace again.
He said found, but it sounded like a cliché, so I spiced it up à la KJ. King Julien, I knew you would return. Use my hat as a talisman. It's yours. Take it.
The torch fills the dark room with light. You see a door in front of you. What do you do? I am opening the door. How do you open it?
The doorknob does not turn. How do you open it? - I don't know. - The doorknob does not turn. - How do you open it?
- She has you with that. - I know. Dad? I love this town. I really love it.
- I know. Dad? I love this town. I really love it. I love it just the way it is.
So... this show? Did you start it or did Katie start it? She did. Why? Katie! Oh, it's just... weird that they're sending her again now.
Yes, because she betrayed them. After they took her to the man in the High Castle. Do you have any proof of that? Eric, will you excuse us for a moment? The medal behind your desk. May I look at it a little closer?
- Do you want me to connect you with him? - No, it's okay. I'll call him later. He wanted your mobile number. Did you give it to him? Yes.
- No, it's okay. I'll call him later. He wanted your mobile number. Did you give it to him? Yes. I'll give your mobile number to anyone who wants it.
- I'm scared. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I want you to go home, and I want you to take my gun. What? Keep it with you, just in case. And if I'm wrong about Mike, you don't use it.
Feel more closely. Wouldn't it be better with some support? Yes, maybe. Perfect. I'll get it for you.
Hey, I have a new trick, we should add it to the program. Okay, ready? Watch this. Look at this ordinary banana. I'll make it disappear within two seconds.
Do you know how to find April? No. But we know someone who might. As far as we know, he's the only one who can use the gun. Yeah, but he won't. All this time, he's been fooling me into thinking it doesn't exist at all.
- It's possible. That you have no other choice is up to you. Yeah, sure. I'm not changing my phone number. I'm keeping it.
What if it was forever? Forever, then. Do you know the feeling of dread? The fixation is prepared, Your Majesty. Once I put it in place, it will hold the heart in your body. And you will be whole again.
- Where are you from? Why did you kill those three? I only entered to eat noodles. But suddenly the boy grabbed my gun. I tried to get it back, but the gun went off.
If something goes wrong, we will die. You know exactly what the young leader is like. If he wants to have fun, nothing will stop him. If he wanted them killed, we would have done it already. Besides, we want to rule over the city, not destroy it.
You only understand people when you put yourself in their shoes. When you slip into their skin and walk around with it. Yes? You know what? Right now, I don't want to walk around in Dennis' skin. I want to slowly peel it off his bones.
Pretty messy. - So you snapped? - Yes, and I really did. There was a statue of Jesus filled with pills. I knocked it over.
- Sounds like it. - Did he say anything to you? - Yeah. Said I was spreading poison on the reservation. Then he took my merchandise and burned it.
Too much stress makes me nauseous. Do you have his name or anything? I have his business card. There's no name, just a number. Did you keep it?
What else is there?" Do you remember back then, when was that? Last year or so, when we were doing cancer research at Columbia. We were talking about mitosis. And you say, "How do we get these microtubules to grow in the middle of a cell and divide it?"
That's the way it is with firearms. The more often you look at a gun, and you see one where there is one, it's very likely to be the gun you're looking at. That's the most dangerous thing about a gun. If you're thinking about owning a gun, be clear: If you buy it and put it somewhere, it's probably still there when you look again.
Ex. Thank God. Now he is someone else's problem. So why is he chasing you? Well, I, uh... I thought I lost this necklace, and then I see it around the neck of J.P.'s new wife.
- Yes. - Whoa. This asshole stole it from me and gave it to another woman. Okay? I saw her at the Blind Tiger and I took her back.
- Whoa. This asshole stole it from me and gave it to another woman. Okay? I saw them in the Blind Tiger and I took them back. You stole them off his wife's neck.
This asshole stole it from me and gave it to another woman. Okay? I saw them in the Blind Tiger and I took them back. You stole them from his wife's neck. No, I didn't steal them.
- No, we have to take her to the hospital. - No. If we take her to the hospital, they will call the cops. The cops will come and think I did it. Why would they think you did that? Maybe it's because I broke in here to get my necklace back after that unconscious bitch ripped it off my neck in a bar fight yesterday that everybody saw.
I was so embarrassed, I.... I just drove back. I drove all night. Can you give me the address of his house? Yeah, I know it by heart.
I was taking pictures and stumbled upon a homeless man. Where is my camera? Where did you find it? - In front of a condemned building near Bed-Stuy. - She wants her camera back. She can't live without it.
Is that fairy dust? Stop! That's poison from the Evil Queen. You know the story. I know it, yes.
He did it because he knew it was the best chance any of us could have. It's hard to believe he's still alive. Blood invaded the lungs and pleural tissue on the left side, reducing lung capacity and limiting respiratory metabolism. After removing large amounts of blood and blood clots, severe damage to the spleen became apparent. I was able to safely remove it. However, his vital signs remain unstable and his life remains in danger.
I have informed them. It's a little too ambitious right now. You don't go to Mars without ambition. However hard Ed Grann's team worked to build Olympustown's infrastructure, Mars worked even harder to tear it down again.
I talked to Paul and he seemed very detached. He's just focused. I checked his food rations and he hardly eats anything. Sometimes he forgets. He lives for his work and can't do it.
An important Jap general is in town. Thanks to you, we won't have to sacrifice any of our people. You want me to build you the bomb? No. You and Sara figure out where to plant it.
Yes, there is. Turner v. State of Michigan. How the hell did you find that? Being a paralegal for so long was apparently a blessing after all, because no one is better at research than me. Super. Draft up a statement and bring it to me as soon as you're done.
I haven't exceeded shit. I don't think so. Because not only does Kevin live in New Jersey, but his accident was there, which means you were out of your jurisdiction. You better drop this lawsuit, because if they're coming after me-- They're not going to target you, Sean, because I haven't filed it yet.
What I'm trying to say is that I'm not in denial about the kind of person I was, or even the things I did, because those are the things I did. If I could go back and change what I did, I would, but I can't. I can swear to you, though, that I will never be that person again. You crossed a line when you took Jill's money. No, Mike, I didn't, but I'm about to cross it now.
- I can't believe it. I'm about to give the most important cross-examination of my life and you guys show up now? Jessica, we've left dozens of messages. Jim Reynolds' board moved up the meeting. Well, tell them to move it back, because I can't leave right now.
Jessica, we left dozens of messages. Jim Reynolds board moved the meeting up. Well, tell them to move it back, because I can't leave right now. God damn it, don't you get it? They moved it up so they could get it over with.
I mean, we didn't dive deep enough into her story. But Jaclyn has said that she had a beautiful childhood. But you said that your work was to develop behavioral strategies for her to say no to her husband. That's true. Saying you had a beautiful childhood - doesn't make it so. - Well...
That is true. To say that you had a beautiful childhood, - does not make it so. - Well... You know my perfume collection? She discovered it, she wanted to try one.
Besides the obvious hypocrisy of pretending Nicole is facing expulsion over a teaspoon of herbs, with the Layton girl selling pills on campus last fall and yet I just saw her in the hallway. Okay, what are you doing? I'm the transmitter. It's very simple. We thank you for your consideration, but we don't need it.
And we're going to stop Murphy from creating his damn mongrel race. That's why they call him "The Man." They're all going to come after us. The battle for the future of mankind is about to begin. And I intend to win it.
So, aren't you ready to go? There's still time to find out what's making these people sick. What if we get sick? Is it worth the risk? Why save the world when there's no one left to enjoy it?
"Mandatory sentences." We don't want judges to continue to factor in the circumstances of a crime. We're setting mandatory sentences. That's been hard for judges. They want to do justice every day and they can't do it anymore. In many California communities, civil trials were canceled to work off criminal trials. We took away the discretion of judges, the most neutral party in the court, and gave it to prosecutors.
I threatened to tell people he was an informant, but besides that, I found a way to get him parole. Parole? Are you crazy? He's not going to get parole. Who's to say he deserves it?
Are you crazy? He won't get parole. Who's to say he deserves it? You know what, Harvey? Instead of coming here and saying I should betray my cellmate because Gallo will never get parole, maybe you should help me get it for him.
He's never going to help that son of a bitch with anything, and this isn't about Gallo, and you know it. No, this is about you asking me to testify against the one guy in here that I trust because of some scheme that Cahill has that we don't even know is going to work. No, Mike. It's about giving you a chance to get your life back while it still looks the same. So are you gonna take it or not?
I don't know what you're talking about. Who is Nathan Byrnes? The CEO of Exodyne. Oh, that Nathan Byrnes. In this case, I said I can sell this stock because I own it.
He promised Mike that he wouldn't tell her, and Harvey is true to his word. If he was true to his word, he'd be here right now. So what are you going to do? I'm going to do what should have been done from the beginning. I'm going to tell Mike's fiancé that he has a chance to get out, but he doesn't want to take it.
How does that help me? It doesn't. It helps me. - Donna! - Okay, listen to me. If you really want my help, I'll offer it.
I have no idea what you are talking about.... It doesn't matter, because I'm not going to press charges without knowing that I could win the case. And you're not going to be able to win the case unless you rattle the tree and see what comes down. Damn it, Harvey, I'm not going to collude on this thing, and you're here wanting me to bring an indictment against your own client. Because if you make that charge, I will shoot it down, and if you don't make it, and continue to investigate my client, then I will sue you, which I would do anyway, no matter who it was about.
I'm glad you're doing well. What's on your mind? I want you to pass on a message from me to the director. Sure. I'll pass it on to him at our weekly brunch.
That's not reason enough to turn us against Leonard Bailey. Never question my financial wizardry again. Spit it out. I pondered for a long time, trying to find a way to stop the withdrawal, but then it dawned on me. We don't have to stop it.
I suppose if I asked you who he paid, you would have the same answer. If I find out you're lying, next time you'll be the one in solitary, and it won't be just one night. - What? - I'm just thinking about what's gonna happen when this asshole finds out that you're gonna undo his bullshit rehab. William, I'm gonna invalidate it, but I want you to sign this first.
I need a big, expensive house in the Hamptons. Why are you buying a vacation home? Because I told Tara Messer I had a property out there, and I hired her to remodel it for me. Damn it, Harvey, I'm not going to collude on this, and you're here wanting me to bring charges against your own client. Because if you bring that charge, I'm going to shoot it down, and if you don't bring it, and you continue to investigate my client, then I'm going to sue you.
You may as well be on your way back inside, because I just got back from Sutter. I assume he told you about our little conversation today. If by conversation you mean you went behind my back and got his investment firm, then yes, he told me that. I didn't go behind your back. I saw an opportunity and I took it.
I assume he told you about our little conversation today. If by conversation you mean you went behind my back and got his investment firm, then yes, he told me that. I didn't go behind your back. I saw an opportunity and I took it. Now he sees an opportunity and he takes it.
- Can't. - Why is that? Because Sutter wants me to file an immediate motion to dismiss. What, you got me to bring this charge, and now you want to get rid of it?
Then Mike's chance to get out of jail is gone, which means Cahill is not the only one who has to use this to try to get something. I have to admit, Ms. Zane, when you said you were looking into the Bailey case, my interest was piqued. That was a long time ago. You've obviously come a long way since your time as a public defender. You don't exactly see role model people doing that work, so you can only do it for so long.
Now we're trying to straighten the damn thing out. You mean by finding Maria Gomez. I mean by postponing the execution. Jessica, Leonard's right. What's the point of postponing the execution if we can't stop it?
Defending my own client? Bullshit, you weren't trying to defend your client. You were trying to ruin my case because you're pissed off about Mike. Sure I am. We had an agreement, and you broke it.
Bullshit, you weren't trying to defend your client. You were trying to ruin my case because you're pissed off about Mike. Sure I am. We had an agreement, and you broke it. So now I'm breaking it, too.
- Did you get the apartment? - The... - Did you call? What did they say? Yes, I did. I called and... they gave it to the graduates.
- Yes? - I know that we... we don't often get the chance to... Did you take the sculpture? Did you... take the sculpture? Did you steal it?
Just a tomato sandwich? Yes. Is that a problem? No. I don't want to know about the surprise party, but could you host it at my place, this Friday at 7:30? That'd be great.
Yes. Is that a problem? No. I don't want to know about the surprise party, but could you host it at my place, this Friday at 7:30? That would be great. I can throw it and act surprised, but if you...
I can see it in her look. I should get rid of all of them except you. Then I'd work all day instead of playing with this. Art never judges. I envy her.
Just heard. Our banger, Marco? The CT shows that the bullet is not in the midline or touching the aorta. It's in the left paraspinal muscle. Is that where the surgeon's gonna take it out?
I know what that means. It just seems trivial to me. You have to understand, this is a delicate time. Public opinion is very important. Without it, everything collapses.
It doesn't look right. But it doesn't feel right. We'll find the culprits when Miami has power again. They're definitely using EMP devices. The power outage affects an equal area everywhere. The effect is randomly scattered, it's hard to pinpoint the source, but I've got everything I need to find them, turn them off and....
She always went out when you were already in bed. - And did what? - I don't know. Where's the necklace now? Well, she liked it that way, I put it on her, down in the, you know.
Ok, in this high security building is one of the servers for the registration of Inhumans. I know how my agency works, thank you. Every day at the same time, Agent Elizabeth Albi brings a hard drive here with updated data. I swipe her ID card. Then I clone her and put a fake identity over it.
Yes, but she had that at the time, too. Didn't prevent it from ending up in the ghost toaster. There must be something there, something new. Did you get my Momentum Labs inventory list? Yes. I'm looking at it right now.
Eli, no, please! It's not finished! It's going to kill me! You didn't mind Joseph getting the power. - You just wanted it for yourself.
They thought I was cheating. They believed I was incapable of it. They excluded me. Well, guess what? Guess what I'm capable of now. I can create a city out of nothing. Or I can cover it with volcanic rock.
I have proved that this is not true. I am rewriting the laws of nature. You are drunk with your power or very gullible or believing in power, I don't know. But you're not creating energy, Eli. I'm stealing it?
In the meantime, we do trust each other. The way you act, I don't trust you. Your insurance. Under the warrant. It's a copy, keep it.
Han, what happened? Did you meet Eun? - What? Where's the gun? What gun? Where are those fuckers, I gotta get them!
A box, a locked metal box, entrusted to me at home by a very important person. A party official? He would not tell me what was in the box. He ordered me to wait for delivery instructions. I had to get it back.
He would not tell me what was in the box. He ordered me to wait for delivery instructions. I had to get them back. Torres had many warehouses, many offices. It took a week to find out where he had them.
We're looking at his ex. Unless she's over six feet and incredibly strong, I wouldn't bother. That said, I think I can identify the murder weapon. I can, too. Forensics bagged it 20 minutes ago.
Unless she's over six feet and incredibly strong, I wouldn't bother. That being said, I think I can identify the murder weapon. So can I. Forensics bagged it 20 minutes ago. The killer left it behind?
All I have to do is share my suspicions with my clients and you'll be the next one to get chopped up. You wouldn't. Confess. If you are arrested, charged, and convicted, I might be able to convince them that justice has been served. If Jimmy Koslow had been offered the same opportunity, I believe he would have taken it.
Man of God? Mighty Mark, a nothing. Smells good, honey. What happened to your blouse? I'll put it away for tonight.
- It's not what you think. - No? Because I think my teenage son is dealing. Possession with intent to distribute, that's a felony. Penny found it.
No, come on in. Tyler Richmond must be ignoring my calls. I'm very sorry about what happened. You wrote a great eulogy. Too bad he didn't hear it.
I don't think so. Let's assume we're right. Aaron came across a piece of film worth blackmailing. Except the person he was trying to blackmail turned the tables and kidnapped Beth. If the recording is there, I'll overlook it.
Then I knocked louder and called for Meredith. At some point I asked, "Raffaele, could you please break down the door? I don't know if Meredith is there." He tried twice to kick it in, but it didn't work.
Red Russian and green Iranian wire do not work. Ignition too low. Human error cannot be ruled out. The people who took out our U.S. Capitol in one blow didn't test the triggers? What do you mean? What if the bomb didn't go off for us to find?
Probably like everyone. I was with Andrews. The bomb that was found, the UXO, it could say something completely different. Okay, I'm listening. Okay. What if they wanted us to find it? So we'd settle on al-Sakar, rule out others.
Someone blew up the Capitol. Who knows what else is possible? Even more so, there is someone sitting in the Oval Office who was number 11 in the succession. I can't give him speculation. If you want me to put your theory to him, prove it.
I'm going to try some of this before it's all gone. Hi. - I hope you are feeling better. - For the most part, yeah. You know what? I would love a cup of coffee, but I don't have time to drink it before they get here.
But as long as it is me and only one man is in danger, we do not do anything that further compromises our safety. I agreed to 12 hours. These terrorists came to us, killed our people. Any sacrifice we make to wipe them out is a worthy sacrifice. If there is a snake in your kitchen, you don't invite it in, you cut its head off!
- I'm happy for you, Kara. - Thanks. I have an idea for an article, but I don't think my boss is too keen. And neither am I. Reporting is more complicated than I expected, and I had imagined it to be complicated.
- Pure joy to eat. - No. Mon-El, there is a place and time to eat sweets. Yes, now and here. No. This is your workplace. When James assigns you a task, you should finish it, not Ms. Teschmacher.
You're in charge at Cadmus. Are you going to lecture me like you would Lex? No. There was some truth in what you said. Ask me for help, and I'll give it to you.
- Well, thanks, but I have my own. Lucky you. "Tribe Called Red"? Native American fight music. Put it on.
- Right. This military guy came to Howard's door. - He was terrifying. - What did he say? He gave me his business card, and asked me to give it to Howard.
- I bet it was Barbara Chen from the retrovirus lab. She probably heard me when I was throwing up. Since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she's the greatest. Why don't you want anyone to know? I'm supposed to get the immunotherapy trial, but if they find out I'm pregnant, - they'll give it to someone else.
The three of us developed the guidance system. - Hi. - Hello. - And this is our friend, Raj. I'm not working on the patent, I'm just here because there's a bumblebee buzzing around my office. I've seen it.
Let's cut to the chase: the Air Force believes it has use for this technology and we are interested in funding your research. Well, thank you very much, but you should know that we are a little concerned about its use in weapons. Well, I can reassure you on that. What we use it for is not your concern.
One evening he sanded the back of a drawer. To paint it. I asked, "Dad, why are you painting the back? Nobody sees them." He said, "I see them."
He said, "It's nothing, but you need to get some rest." I said, "I can't take a vacation every week." Hey, Patrick? This music depresses me. I'll tell Stéphane. We'll change it.
I was working in a bar in San Diego when I started dating this man. I thought it was love. One day I took a picture of him and was going to send it to my family. He got angry. He took out the SIM card and put it in the microwave.
Oh, she must have fallen off. - You know, she's really thin... - Stop it. Roger. Okay, I took it off.
- Barely. Murtaugh, tell Riggs you're sorry you hit him. You know what? New statement. You'll hate them.
When did you two set up this little rendezvous? While I was shining on air? - He called me today. - How did he get your number? - He said you gave it to him.
Newly married. He spent his honeymoon training with me. Nonstop sacrifice. Commander, I need to know something. Admiral Chernow is confident about this operation. But I need you to run it.
Wait, this Kaier is Shadowcat? Could someone enlighten me? It's a pseudonym of a hacker on the dark web. He's hacked into White House and Navy intelligence servers, even the Pentagon's internal network. So someone who was supposed to protect our infrastructure abused his position to undermine it.
Shut up! We found the bomb. What's the situation? It looks very messy. Indeed, it is difficult to remove it.
What is the situation? It looks very messy. Indeed, it is difficult to remove it. - The bomb is attached to the pipe. - Is there no way to loosen it?
When the bomb explodes, the bag dies. Was American retrofitted. Pretty heavy, huh? Can you hold out till the police get here, Captain? - How do you disarm it?
"What is time for a pig?" That's a riddle. Or what is it? No, I hate riddles. It asks one to consider what burden one is carrying is really necessary or if it can be shed if one just tries.
That is part of it. - And fermentation takes place here? - Exactly. This is where the beer becomes beer. We make the wort here, pump it over, where it mixes with the yeast, and two weeks later it's beer.
I hardly think so. That's all right. Would you like the menu? Yes, I'm hungry. Leave it.
It's ok. Would you like the menu? Yes, I'm hungry. Leave it. - I'll look at it.
Got it right here. The day after the murder, several calls were made from Parks' cell phone to a cell phone number in Montclair. The number was registered to a woman named Lori Hammond. A 35-year-old single mother currently employed at a travel agency. When I interviewed Lori Hammond, she told me that the Montclair cell phone number was part of her Friends Family cell phone plan. She had set it up for her brother Woody, a Gulf War veteran. who lived with her and her son.
I take a cup and you take the cockroach and dip it in the ice water. - How do you touch them? - Just from the side. - Good. - Yes, you have it.
Is it like a thundercloud that discharges electricity - as lightning? - Yes, it is exactly the same. You build up energy in the cloud, then the lightning follows. Here, we store the energy in capacitors. Our solid-state circuit transfers it very quickly into the Tesla transformer.
I think there's something wrong here. How much does this resemble a real superpower? - It looked real enough. - Yes. I was able to control electricity, use it to fire and hit my targets. If one of those bolts of lightning hit you, you'd be dead.
Since then - they belong to the California nobility. - But that doesn't put them above the law. No, but they have an entire law firm on their payroll. Good. If this Dylan guy killed our girl, he's gonna need them.
Someone else knows, too, because they saw it in the file. You looked in our file? It was an accident. The doctor left the file on the table. It's not my fault I opened it and looked.
Gabby, I'll solve this. I promise. Hey. The brunette, Lizzie, left her number. She told me to make sure you got it.
I understand. You were scared. I was scared to death. But there's one thing I don't understand: Dearing only had one bullet in his gun and he used it up so fast.
Only for the tracker? - Yes. What's it made of? - Leather, I guess. Did you sew it yourself, the little leather bag?
In recent years, carmakers have tried to develop more efficient and environmentally friendly engines. No attention has been paid to environmentally friendly bodies and interiors. It's all still steel and plastic, using a lot of energy. So we thought about whether more sustainable materials could be used. To do this, we each bought a Land Rover Discovery. We removed the sheet metal bodywork and replaced it with materials that we thought would secure the future of the planet.
When I awoke the next morning, Clarkson and May were harnessing me to protect the rhinos. They were convinced that we could use our buggies to track the poachers. They're already right about rhino hunting. It's absurd. Every day poachers kill two rhinos in Africa and sell them as a cure for cancer, impotence or drunken nights.
Yeah, no, actually, no fun. She was just talking about herself the whole time. It really just seemed like she needed an audience. And when the bill came, you know what she didn't do? Catching them.
If you can someday find a way to show as much kindness to a person as your parents did to you, that would be enough of a gift for me. But I really like the snow globe. Yes, sir. I bet my cabin in Montana looks just like that right now. You can light it up.
If I understand correctly, the bar will remain in Maggie's name. And as far as owning the ranch, you sign your half over to Beau. I've been thinking and I want to give my half to Colt and Rooster. What do you want to do? It's my half, I want to give it to them.
And as far as owning the ranch, sign your half over to Beau. I've been thinking and I want to give my half to Colt and Rooster. What do you want to do? It's my half, I want to give it to them. You better give it to the cows, they deserve it.
I would be thrilled. I'm sure the next attempt will go better. Yes, it will. I'll take over again. Beau, you gave them a task, let them finish it.
Are you still fucking cows? I thought it was sheep. So you admit it. So... what's new? I'm just hanging out at the old McConnell ranch. Some Hollywood douche bag bought it.
Change? There are still 48 stars on his flag. Yes, and if Colt asks, there must be that many. I think your dad really believes in what he says, but in the end he'll do it again like he always does. Remember the John Wayne DVD collection at Christmas? He used them as props for his John Wayne video collection.
You're not going to decide this. This isn't about you. It's about our little girl who's missing. You think I don't think about that every second? If she can help us get Casey back because she's Chris MacNeil... Crazy! If there's even the slightest chance, we'll take it.
We need to get ready. Gather the others. Prepare for an attack or a siege or both. The battle for the future of humanity will soon begin. And I intend to win it.
I can not. Convene press. Making an announcement. - Your first press conference. - This is not how I imagined them.
- You polished them? - You broke our deal. If you want to go Woodward, get a better Bernstein. All I said was I wouldn't do the story, and I kept my word. You gave it to somebody else.
You should not make him your enemy. He could block your economic planning for three years. You have no choice. You must accept my resignation. I appreciate the question and understand it.
Stimulus designs, jobs.... These things go through the committee and Hazelton. He rejected my resignation after the al-Sakar video. He barely knew me then. - He won't let a trusted advisor go. - That's why you have to take it.
Good. It turns out that America's favorite vice presidential candidate and the CIA's most wanted mercenary know each other. I take it you don't see that as a coincidence. Sorry. If Catalan was a spy on the 11/14 mission, the CIA would have a file. Have you found it?
You must tell me all the names that had access to this file. I gave the file an ORCON rating. That makes for a limited number of people who saw it. - Then it went to DoD security. - They all died at the Capitol. - I also sent it to the NORCOM director.
I think that is unlikely. This file had an ORCON rating. I can count on one hand the people who saw it. You're the only one who survived the attack. They sent it to me, but I never read it.
This file had an ORCON rating. I can count on one hand the people who saw it. You are the only one who survived the attack. They sent it to me, but I never read it. The file was reclassified by the Secretary of Defense and electronically recalled before I could open it.
From the White House. You will be placed in custody until we confirm your testimony. I understand. You have a serious problem. And even if you don't want my help, I'm offering it, sir.
If she's one of them, I hope she's dead. I don't understand them. - They're wankers. - They're ungrateful. The island offers salvation to all, but they despise it.
- To do handstands. We have to form groups. Who has a good memory? We need eight people with good memory. Everyone memorizes a line and brings it to the respective room.
Turn off the camera. That's enough. Come here! Come here quickly! - Turn it off.
You have about ten seconds to explain to me what this is about before I pour the water over your head. Describe to me the picture I just pasted on the cabinet there. And I'm not allowed to move? Yes, but keep in mind that Mr. Enriquez specifically said that he was carrying the punch bowl to the concert shell to put it down when he heard the gunshots.
- Yes. - Was here. - Yes. This is all you found on the flash drive? These messages, plus several drafts of Russell Cole's paper. He didn't write them alone, he had help from a partner.
Cole wanted more money. The partner agreed to talk about it and told him to come back to town. They were supposed to meet at Cole's apartment two nights ago. The night Cole was murdered. We thought someone who Cole's treatise hurt murdered him in anger, but it turns out he may have been killed by those who hired him to write it.
- You're right. Why use science when you can guess? I've seen this before. It's a message. You don't dispose of a body like that unless you want someone to see it, right?
What about you, Father Tomas? Are you taking a break? No, these torments showed me some things. They strengthened my devotion. My community needs me, and I have neglected it.
And then he built them a sandbox. And he filled it with palpable and sensual pleasures. Pleasures we could never feel, taste or experience. He created paradise, and he gave it to a pack of primates who wrote in the sand. That world was ours. And we are going to take it back.
Or don't. It's your decision, not mine. You have the power, not me. You love the power, don't you? Well, I only like it... because it allows me to do good things.
Yes, of course. But look, any information you give me helps me a lot. I only saw the engine cover. You were in the casino during the robbery. Your mom said she saw it because you weren't supposed to be there.
The Irish have left their mark on us. You can trace their influence to how New Yorkers respond to compliments. - "Hey, nice hair." - "Fuck you. What's bothering you about it?" - "I think it's beautiful." - "I get it."
"Your glasses are fogged up. You better clean them." "He lives in the computer store, he stinks of space bars." "Yo, your book bag is dirty. Pick it up."
Even if one arises naturally and the other was bred in a laboratory. Pereya obviously knew that. So Sherlock thinks there's no way he would have submitted bad research to the FDA. So he went to Next Century Meats, and got them to give us Pereya's unredacted research paper. And you compare it to the paper that was submitted to the FDA.
Tell them where you are. Tell them you want to talk about what happened last night. Call them, or I will. Let me tell you a story. If you don't believe it, just press send.
That's why you were at the scene almost an hour after the murder took place. Yes, the police showed up shortly after we did. But we ran away. - Which one of you threw the gun away? Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago.
But we ran away. - Which one of you threw the gun away? Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago. He said if I was going to be with SBK, I had to have it with me. I took it to Whitlock and said I didn't want it.
- Which one of you threw the gun away? Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago. He said if I was traveling with SBK, I had to have it with me. I took it to Whitlock and said I didn't want it. He said it would be too suspicious if I didn't keep it.
The stress, the time and effort to take care of Ethan, I couldn't have done that. And I never could have hurt her. So where's the gun now? In the garage by the house. I stashed it in my tool drawer after I shot the man who attacked me and Janine.
Hard to imagine I missed a gun. Well, you have to. Either that or... What? Or someone took it.
"In three and a half hours we will kill a guard." This was not the first time such information reached us. This message was clearly addressed to the media. From a distance, one could not read the threat. The prison administration had already heard it.
That is terrible. No one should have to go through something like that. Prisoner Negotiator. Please be respectful and let us get the body. We have to get it and go back out.
I've never heard of anything so crazy. How did they come up with it? Through a photo in a magazine smuggled in from the West. You just can't leave that story out. I had to recreate it, using the methods and materials of the time.
But we do not use it. It is only used to drill a mounting hole for the right drill. This is quite different from the drilling machines you know. This is the anchor. Just putting it together is a challenge.
- Come on, Guv. - Come on. - Give it up. Guvnor, let it go. They're so close to the prey they can almost smell it.
At 7:40 p.m., the plane takes off, with only Cooper and four crew members on board. But Cooper has no intention of landing in Reno. The Boeing 727 had a very special feature. There was a fold-out staircase at the back of the plane. And D.B. Cooper knew he could unfold it in flight.
Those who want to apply must come in long-sleeved blue shirt, yellow vest, blue jeans, hat, goggles and work shoes. And on September 30, at 11 a.m. sharp, to the parking lot in front of the bank. There, 15 identically dressed workers show up. Now comes the clever part. D.B.'s disguise has Velcro fasteners, so he can take it off immediately after the robbery, while the others unsuspectingly provide a distraction.
"Control not available." - Oh, my God. - It's taking over the drone. You can't do anything. My device can move it, turn it, or stop it. Or let the drone land gently before you crush it.
- When will we get them? You'll probably see them in two years. Here's my first candidate. A sci-fi promise from Star Wars. In 1977, the idea of recording a hologram message and then dropping it off was a radical vision of the future.
But then I find a flaw in the system. Oh, really? Come on. I ran out of card. I had to stop, take it out, and put in card two.
Arm candlesticks on the streets. Four contenders vying for first place, and here's a fifth. This time, I'm the center of attention. This invention has become popular around the world in recent years. You can see them at every landmark.
Remember the days of listening to records.... cassettes... and CDs? When your own music collection was material? Times are changing. Today, you don't have to own music. You can stream it remotely.
Today, you don't have to own music. You stream it through remote access. A music cloud. One has access to it around the clock. And you can listen to it on your phone.
- I can hear it here? - Yes. Yes, I can hear it. It's a sine wave. By connecting the tones to the keyboard, the telharmonium can make music and play it through the phone.
First, the finishing touches. When Baker covered his car, he used wood and canvas. We use the same materials. We take a 0.6 cm thick plywood, cut it into 7 cm wide strips and lay those over the frame. Then we stagger them and nail them down. Once we have our basic shape, we spray it with foam to smooth it out.
And right outside this window... there was someone digging. And this digging went on for several days. I thought they were going to bury my body there. I used to get the newspaper around 7 o'clock in the morning. When I opened it, there was a headline about the kidnapping.
I said, "Rachel gets these books." We were allowed to exchange books. And in the books I put my two crossword puzzles. And he said, "Okay, no problem." And he disappeared. I didn't even know if Rachel was going to get them. About 40 minutes later, he came back with a bag and gave it back to me.
Berezovsky never did anything for free. Wherever he went, there was blood. As time went by, HC changed and his hair became all greasy. I remember one morning I was let out of the room and HC was just sitting there. He had made a kind of little sculpture out of his toothbrush and toothpaste. And he was just looking at it.
Harmeet, are you asleep? Yes. You had to ask permission, "Harmeet, can I use my hand? I want to finish this mosquito." Of course, I never caught it, and then, "Okay, I'll just feed the mosquitoes."
It's a simple mechanism. There is a small spring, and when you lift it, it opens as if by magic. The little nail became the instrument of grace, as we called it. I remember the first night with free hands. I could pull the blanket up under my chin, tuck it under my shoulders, and it felt so good.
Master Jim hasn't trained for an hour yet. Fix your eyes on the interpreter of signs. He will reveal your true nature. Put your right hand in, troll hunter. I'll get it back, won't I?
Save Jim! -No, this is Jim's fight. Rule three! What? Deja's mercy! -He found her!
Jim, hang in there. Great Gronka Morka, the shape-shifter was right. The bridge is complete. And it's been here all along! Oh dear... If young Atlas won't open it for us, maybe he'll open it for you.
"Emptiness" sounds like a hollow word. And like something unpleasant. And are we talking about happy ghosts or soul-eating poltergeists? They don't eat his soul. They look into it.
And I have the address... -No. -You lost the address? No, of course not. You don't have it in your head, do you?
- No! I'm not getting down on my knees. If you do, I'll go on in there with you. So you don't want to. Let's hold on to this. You want this dry spell to continue. I wanted to end it. You don't.
I'll let you know when I'm leaving Noel often talked to them about money and one he even offered work at Avid Life. Once a month, I could come to Toronto He turned out to be a real sugar daddy himself in the end. Is anyone available right away? The Ashley Madison story was obviously based mostly on lies. Send me 2 girls and I'll pick one Hard to say if the mainstream media would have given Noel and company so much air time if they had known what was going on behind the scenes. Ashley Madison is not the inventor of prostitution, but the emails suggest that they are helping to automate it, to make it available to everyone.
During my travels, I met a strong and noble people. A woman belonged to it, who accepted me as I was. Who loved me. It was not the life I was meant to live, but it taught me something. If you long for love, you must be willing to travel to the ends of the earth to find it.
Why do you think you were created in the first place? I don't know. Maybe you were once very, very bored. Scientists usually serve something greater. Helping people, improving the world, saving it.
But I... I just can't help it. I can't help it. Drop the gun, Leo. Drop it.
Now I notice all kinds of things. And I want to know how they work. Like this clock, for example. Fantastic craftsmanship! It belonged to my great-grandmother. I want to take it apart and spread the parts out on the floor.
Everyone knows that we do business with World Jai Alai. Who is everybody? We're freaking everybody. Brian. Take the bag, I want you to have it.
We're fucking everyone. Brian. Take the bag, I want you to have it. Yes. I want you to have it.
Say it! Henry! Put the gun down. Henry... Put it down.
I'm not a great writer. I'm not Hawthorne. But ever since I first heard about it, this story has haunted me. It consumes me. If I don't write it down, I fear, I will never write again.
But since I first heard about it, this story has haunted me. It consumes me. If I don't write it down, I fear, I will never write again. What else? If I write it down, I fear it will not be as good as it deserves to be.
- But it doesn't. Nothing can make up for the destruction of dreams. What? I'll tell you "what" because it all makes sense to me now. Take your great record, wrap it in the fur coat and talk to my lawyer on the phone.
Wonderful that this inspires you. Are you coming back in for the party now? Honey? Do you like the new necklace? Yes, I love it.
I believe that a whole new universe lies just beyond what is visible to us. I know your memorandum. - Once we get there, we could have new resources at our disposal. About energy sources that will renew our own. We can use it to learn more about the Earth, possibly even save it.
(classical music) (knocking) So, someone stole my design. - Nobody stole anything, Victor. Someone else came up with the same idea and managed to implement it.
I think all of us. Unless we're the first. Why don't we just do it? God, this thing works, okay? We can go over there, it won't take five minutes. We take a flag, put it up, leave our mark and be the first. Fuck what anybody says.
But not stronger than all of us together. This place has given him his powers, but it has also given us ours. This is what we are now. Maybe this was always our destiny. We have opened this door, we will close it.
Hey! Now it's round! This better work. (Johnny) Let's get the hell out of here! The world doesn't know what you did to save them, but everyone in this room does.
- Guess. - I don't know. Do you think we're just going to take the loss? No. We repackage it and put it in a CDO.
I found this at the bottom of the store. Is that a good idea? We don't have to... - No, no, no, no, no. One bottle will be fine. - Let's open it.
Come on, John. Come on! - All right. I'll see you. I can't find her.
Go! Wow. (JUPITER SNAPS FOR AIR) Are those flying boots? They use gravity and redirect it into a differential equation tilt so you can surf.
It was stupid to make me immortal. - Kaulder, I want to help you. - Chloe. I told you not to... Immortality isn't yours. It's mine. You wore it just for me.
Drink this. Thank you. The witch queen has returned. I thought my immortality was her punishment for me. But I was just a tool. She wanted it for herself.
You're not a member of the Russian royal family, are you? Are you a Romanov? Europe gave Mexico many things. And Mexico gave back maybe only one thing. Syphilis. It was called the Mexican disease for a time.
Europe has given Mexico many things. And Mexico gave back perhaps only one thing. Syphilis. It was called the Mexican disease for a time. Then the Spanish disease. The Spanish brought it to the Italians in southern Italy.
Oh, you like puke fruit! - Well, sure, I love durian. My mother used to use it, too. It's a ritual of mine. I take the menu card and fold it up.
Put them on the floor! - Drop them. - Come on, get down! Drop the gun. Drop it. Put it on the ground.
(man) When I was 6 years old, I read a book about a jungle. It said that king boas swallow their prey whole without biting it.
Yes, I like it. - It's nothing special. - Yes, it is. It's beautiful. I read the story very carefully. And I thought it was kind of weird.
Great danger! Sir! Please stay in your room until the situation has calmed down! The goggles? You never used them.
Chappie. Bring back one of Daddy's cars... for the money. Where do I get it? From the naughty man who stole it. Take this gun and point it at him.
Ok. And now? Consciousness is like energy. The helmet reads the energy. I have to get it out.
Yes. This is Persian, in the medieval variety. Can you read it? - Yes. "So I scattered the seeds of wisdom and nurtured them with the work of my hands..."
Miss Bell. Welcome back. Welcome back. Before we get down to business: congratulations on escaping the Turkish authorities. I had a permit. You understand? How did you forge it?
Would you like to take a shower with me? And then make a list of your goals. I have a girlfriend. Great. It's important to have a woman by your side on the street. What do you call her? My gutter bitch?
Oh, okay. Learned! Hi. Hi. I told you I'd bring the paint. I'll put it by the pool, okay?
Bye, Dan. You think Cahill's got something? - Maybe. The story's not for us. Ben thinks it's good.
You! Drop your weapon! Put the gun down! - Drop the gun! Drop it!
Weapons down! - Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop your weapon! Drop it!
The 12 district leaders will call for free elections tonight. Paylor is likely to win it. She has become the voice of reason. I regret placing such a heavy burden on you. I know you will carry it forever.
Is that a good idea? Come on, let's get out of here. You were expecting them? My hat. - Leave it.
A signal from another dimension. Sent from here. And to Earth. What if it doesn't just predict the future? It sends it.
- Ideal for your last days. The monitor is an antenna. It not only receives tachyons. It takes a possible future and... It amplifies and transmits them like a feedback loop.
The bomb. Where is it? One minute to detonation. 45 seconds. The bomb, how do I turn it off?
- What should we do? Nothing, I'm afraid. I lack the necessary instruments. Do you have a pocket watch? Give it to me.
Victor, you can't. - No. Excellent! Get back to me soon. Not you create this technique and now tell me how to use it.
We discovered that with emotional stimuli.... primitive belief systems. Of course, that's because they're not yet capable of higher logic. Where is the creature now? Poor thing. I had to put it down, didn't I?
Thank you. I don't know what to do. You already do. Frankenstein, open the door! We're breaking it down!
We have to leave! And leave them my machines? Over my dead body! Trapdoor to the sewers, the only way out. Open it.
Earth's rotation. The biggest hurdle in opening a wormhole is generating enough energy. Much like the enormous amounts of energy it takes for a planet to rotate on its axis. The energy is there. I didn't have to generate it.
The biggest hurdle in opening a wormhole is generating enough energy. Much like the enormous amounts of energy a planet needs to spin on its axis. The energy is there. I didn't have to generate it. The only question is how to harness it.
I didn't have to generate them. The only question is how to take advantage of them. Kind of like we do. I mean, the energy is there. We're just looking for a way to harness it.
He knew I needed a correlation between side A and side B to prove the machine was working. Otherwise, it would just be a couple of blinking lights. Once I send the dahlia back to me, my machine is his. Wait, what are you going to do? I'm taking it to its rightful owner.
You could at least buy me breakfast before that. The biggest hurdle in opening a wormhole is generating enough energy. Much like the enormous amounts of energy it takes for a planet to spin on its axis. The energy is there. And I just figured out how to harness it.
Look. The house of cards. Oh, wait. Wait a minute. Your rocket. I hid it there. I'll take Riley to the moon in it.
I am glad. Grateful that I can still do it. You fear I'm breaking my marriage vows because of you. But it stems from the love behind it. Love is so rare. When you find it, you can't doubt it.
Someone with your skills should be inventing technologies, not installing them. No, sure. I'd like to do something else. I had my chance as a boy, in the arcades. But I blew it.
What happened to Jane upset all of us. We would like to fix that. Do you want me to let my men know? No offense. But I prefer to ride alone. If you don't watch your tongue, I'll cut it out of your throat.
I am retired. How old are you? I was born in Phoenix on September 20, 1980. That's accurate. I built a company and later sold it.
Hello? Mr. O'Neill? Yes? A message from Damian Hale. I think you should hear it.
This is an earthy Bordeaux that fits perfectly with the fact that I'm going to rape you. Look over there! Looks like the better man won! Don't worry, I'll let you have a go. Really? I'll buy a cheap devil mask at the supermarket and fuck her with it until she's sore.
This is not a good design. Your invitation was sent to the whole galaxy! Uh-oh. "Uh-oh," you can say out loud! Our enemy, the Gorgs, will get it, and directions to us to boot!
Next idea! We log into the fugitive Boov's mail and delete his invitation. Or we log into the fugitive Boov's mail and delete his invitation and.... What again? So the gorgs don't get it.
We log into the fugitive Boov's mail and delete his invitation. Or we log into the fugitive Boov's mail and delete his invitation and.... What again? So the gorgs don't get it. So the Gorgs don't get it at all!
Almost poetic. And while I'm wiping a tear from my eye, let me say this: I don't have lofty principles, but when a man gives me his hand on doing something, I expect him to follow through. So be here Tuesday before closing time and sign the papers. Say a hearty goodbye to this town or live with the consequences. I'm not gonna pretend that you and I ever agreed on... about anything, really. I'm not asking for forgiveness because I don't think I deserve it.
Would anyone like a garbage burger? Enough niceties, Plankton! I'm asking you for the last time: where is my formula? As I said, I don't have it.
- Patrick! SpongeBob! Why aren't you at the Krusty Krab making Krabby Patties? I'd love to, but the formula's gone. According to Mr. Krabs, you and Plankton stole it.
I'd love to, but the formula is gone. According to Mr. Krabs, you and Plankton stole it. No, that's not what happened. It just disappeared. We're putting together a team to find it.
A refugee boat. It was sunk by terrorists. Why can't I feel my body? Mira, your body was injured. We couldn't save it.
A ghost hunter. And possibly my fur coat. I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here. So you found your coat. You promised to take care of it.
In short, you have a new mode of transportation. The world has seen a few upgrades since your death, Cage. Drones on board, anti-aircraft guns, and tanks big enough to circle the globe three times without landing. You can take your coat off. No one will steal it here.
X looks out for his people. This can't be true. We didn't make it. Xander, Marke's activated the satellite, and it's moving toward us. Then I'll have to take him out kamikaze style.
Do you still have the golden bird? Oh, Nanny Jo. You don't even remember it, do you? You bet I do. I don't know why I'm embarrassed. but right after you gave it to me, I lost it.
Never heard of it. - I have. According to legend, a ruthless despot ruled here. - From what I've heard, he was merciless and diabolical. But ruthless works, too. When they rediscovered the planet, they quarantined it.
What's going on here? None of your business, nosy. All right. Hey, if the vegetable hat can tell us Hefty's strong, maybe he can tell me what an Ine is. Turn it on, Brainy.
Clumsy, pull the lever! Really? You said not to. Is this a trick? Pull it now!
What did you tell him? The truth. That he was a family heirloom. I just didn't tell him it wasn't my family. I almost gave it to him as a gift.
I'll send you your share. It's no use, Veronica. I'm spending it all on fabric. All right, all right. I'll send it to Gail.
Exactly. Yes, that's it. This way. To the east wing. Or as I call it, the only wing.
I will never tell you. You'll have to tell us what was in it. Oh, I know what. Give me his stinky finger. Yeah, slice him.
I wanted to... I can't remember what I was going to tell you. If dropped, the cargo would have fallen into Titan's atmosphere. But the container was designed to withstand an entry. Can we locate it?
You stay where you are. Just now I found the 1971 school championship bat in the trash can outside my classroom. I wonder who put it in there and why. We thought it was funny to throw the bat out and put the computer with the porn in it. Put it back.
Yes, sir, the foot's about to come off there. But before it gets out of there, let me try to explain. A-all right. Important announcement; - - anyone who finds a two-inch penis, please bring it to Director Tyler.
- Yeah, she's gone now. I thought she'd drop another firebomb on your pathetic sloop. This place would have looked a lot better. I love this beer mug. Found it on my first dive into Poole.
Respect. People like you have cost us the support at home. Do you now want to blame the unarmed for the lost war? Cameras are much more dangerous than guns. And we didn't lose the war, we ended it.
Don't you like the way I do things? You know where the door is. You got this rolling when you led us here. And I'm not backing down now. I know an enemy when I see one.
Bullshit! Slivko, get them out of here! You know that wouldn't be right, boy. (PULLS UP NOSE) Get rid of it, sir.
Yes. I'm John Watson. Dr. Watson... - I love his blog. - His blog? - Don't you read it?
Well then... - A parting gift. - That's nice. - A walking stick. - I needed it a long time ago.
- It's closed on Sunday mornings. - What about Mrs. Hudson? She is expected to vacuum for another two minutes or so. She stores the vacuum cleaner in the back of the house. Isn't that the safest place for her to stow it?
- You hear that? - Sherrinford. - I've never heard that name before. Sherrinford? - Forget you heard it.
Do you shoot electric shocks from your face? That's metaphorical! Yes! For what? The name scares anyone who hears it.
It's simply a goodbye salute. I like it. Do we chat tomorrow? I'm not running away. Where did you get the film? - A German scientist left it.
I mistook my stubborn will for a sense of destiny or something. I never considered what it would mean for my life. You got the job? I fought for it. I earned it.
What kind of things? Are we on the right side? I don't know. Did you know that a gang called the Yang Clan had a deal with Patel before we bought the pier? Someone was using him.
What are these for? I need a drink, and you keep me company because I hate drinking alone. Glass. Back in the monastery, Brother Kuo harvested plums every summer to make wine. He hid it in big clay jars and fermented it in the bell tower during the winter.
Me too. You know, that coat of feigned bravery you wear.... I know why you wear it. I do the same thing. It keeps people out, but... You don't need it with me.
This is an Iron Fist. Why are you interested in the Iron Fist? I spent my whole life in and around dojos and monasteries, training with many masters. I listened to their stories and legends about immortal weapons. I thought they were fairy tales for children until I saw this movie. When I saw it, I was obsessed with learning everything about what the Iron Fist is capable of.
Hi. You scared me. What are you doing here? I'm just looking for my laptop. I lent it to Ricky.
She will find her peace. I pray that you will find yours too. You have always liked this place. It's a miracle that this park exists at all. That this city didn't tear it down to build skyscrapers.
That was in my first life. Before my pilgrimage to K'un-Lun. Before I learned about the substance... and founded the organization. She was intelligent and kind.... And death took it from me before I learned how to defeat it.
- What does "revived" mean? His ex-girlfriend. - He thinks he can save her. - Is that why we almost died? When I said her name, she recognized it.
I doubt we'll see him again. Oh really? They stabbed the devil in the back and forced him to do what he had just abandoned. They set fire to the priest's temple. And burned it to the ground.
It is dangerous. Life-threatening. It could kill them. This is the generator. We have to turn it off so Larina can blow up the whole structure.
You love me. And you won't shoot me. You should have given him the case, cause I'm not hunting you. Okay. I'll just take it off the dead girl.
I can't! This thing is in attack mode! The door won't open until you remove the chip! Tej, we don't know what we're looking for. I got him!
But before we go into that, I want to ask you a question. You may ask me anything. Anything. What's my last name? If you find out, let me know.
Well, now he has returned. Delaney's will leaves him everything. Including Nootka. Do we have a copy of the Nootka sound contract yet? Our lawyers could take a closer look at it.
Yes? From Mr. Delaney. I'm going to heaven, James. I have come to know the truth. My cage is my own body. But I can cast it off.
Hello? ...and former lobbyist who thought the war in Afghanistan was completely pointless. Are you kidding me? I'm not going there. Until he was offered a lot of money to market it.
We have a problem. Your report has been leaked. The Washington Post has a copy. No. - Somebody gave it to Bob Woodward.
It's called "Witch Hunt" based on the play by Arthur Miller. What happened to the dance then? No, we... I never performed it.
Here you go. Oh, man. Why does my head feel so heavy? Touch my head, please? Touch it.
It was at home in my mother's bed. Oh, boy. My pants around my ankles, and with this awful sweater. It was a worn one from my cousin and.... I had to throw it away.
Oh, man. My pants around my ankles, and with this awful sweater. It was a worn one from my cousin and.... I had to throw it away. I... couldn't see it after it was over.
So, departure in five minutes? You promised to help us. We still have to find the rift. I didn't promise to help you commit suicide. If you can't help, we'll find it on our own.
But... he was the closest thing to "Mischief." His mother called him that until.... I remember when... when Stiles got his Jeep. It was his mom's. She wanted him to have it.
We have seen him disappear. They remembered Stiles, creating a new rift. - If the sheriff can do it... - Maybe we can too. - But the rift has closed. - Then we open it again.
Even consecutive impacts. Mason, are you sure this is going to work? Well, whatever's inside that cage is shielded from any electrical current outside. So the ghost rider can't use lightning to escape. We put a lightning rod on the roof and connected it to this cable line.
- The train. It's coming. Okay, so how do we stop it? You can't stop it. But you can reroute it.
Junior FBI. I guess we're not the same kids who were looking for a body in the woods. No, we're not. You can keep the jeep. No, I want you to have it.
Julia. See? I said there was a bird. Julia! But I saw him.
I don't mean existentially, but physically. From the senses. Are you in your body, but don't belong to it? I am in my body. I feel it.
Rain. - Rain. It has been raining. Do you hear the rain? Do you hear it?
- Rain. It has been raining. Do you hear the rain? Do you hear it? Look for it.
Do you hear him? Look for him. Let me know if he's there. Look at me. I have found him.
The hammer. The one I used to kill. It's dull now. The secret to keeping it clean is use. Yes, blood nourishes it, gives it luster.
Like the one about stopping someone from committing suicide upstairs. Maybe after death we travel to another version of our lives. A second chance? Then we wouldn't have to regret our biggest mistake. We could fix it.
Did you expect this after the shoot? Did you think it would be...? Get this big? No. In 2008, I was just on a movie set and during a break in shooting I checked my messages and I had one from Drew at Hustler and it said, "We want to make a movie about Sarah Palin and we want to call it Nailin' Paylin.
I was their first porn star. In the 80s, when it was cool to be a porn star and celebrities wanted to meet you, I had lunch with my lawyer and Milton Berle. I was 21 years old. I was sitting in this Hollywood restaurant with dark wood and red leather chairs between my lawyer and Milton Berle and Milton Berle undoes his pants and lets his dick hang out. He just unwraps it in front of me in this restaurant.
I was sitting in this Hollywood restaurant with dark wood and red leather chairs between my lawyer and Milton Berle and Milton Berle undoes his pants and lets his cock hang out. He just unwraps it in front of me in this restaurant. I try to keep eye contact with him, but it was more difficult. I kept looking down. He never tried anything, he didn't touch me or play with it. He just took it out and left it hanging outside during the whole meal.
But then it went to court. It went all the way to the California Supreme Court. Fornication in public was the charge. More power to fight dirt I said, "I'm not putting my dick in these women. I'm pushing it to the side.
I mean... No. Have you heard of the "male gaze"? No. We have. We don't know exactly what it looks like, but you do.
I like the angry, Audi-scratching Clay. He's got spunk. I think I'm losing my mind. Sanity is overrated. Lose it.
People are so mean, Tony. Sick. Zach still has the letter, did you know that? No, i didn't. He showed it to me.
Sick. Zach still has the letter, did you know that? No, I didn't. He showed it to me. Asked me if I wanted to read it.
Zach still has the letter, did you know that? No, I didn't. He showed it to me. And asked me if I wanted to read it. I couldn't read it because... I'm starting to understand why she did it.
So she dug at this rock in the road, with her hands until they bled, used everything she had to pull it out. It took hours. And then... when she went to fill up the hole, she saw something in it. It was a bag of gold. All right. The king had put the rock on the road because he knew that whoever digs it up, whoever does something, deserves a reward.
Jared, get the hell up. Let's get the hell out of here. Can I, uh... Can I have my cane back, please? Somebody gave it to me.
The dead are quite ruthless when it comes to those who want to be alone. I thought our efforts were quiet enough not to be noticed by you. It was you who opened the door. You walked across my wire. I thought I saw it in time.
I am not a farmer. I need help with this. No, you don't. I saw a blueberry bush outside. When it's young enough, I'll dig it up and plant it here.
Grab the groceries. Did you remember the yogurt? Nope. Wasn't on the list. I only eat yogurt. Then put it on the list.
Thanks. Hey... What are you doing? Nothing. There was lint. Got it.
You are very special, young lady. - Lucky me. - So are you. Because we can remove it. Not today. The tumor is right next to your thyroid. We're doing chemotherapy to shrink the tumor enough so we can get to it.
I am Derrick Flout. -Derrick. Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you, Derrick. Nice to meet you. So, my function here is to approve your loan application. Or not. I'm forwarding it for underwriting.
Old Chief. You don't think anything of it either? Not that I don't think anything of it. I don't like them, but that's not.... We can do without it. We'll type up a report and fax it.
No more whitewashing. And no more hiding. She had a gold engagement ring with three diamonds on her finger. I assure you... - Someone stole it.
She liked his Mercedes. A simple janitor doesn't have one of those. That's right. That's how it was. After Papa Gene punched him, he ripped the Mercedes star off his car and bolted it onto his Caprice.
A simple janitor doesn't have one of those. That's right. That's how it was. After Papa Gene punched him, he ripped the Mercedes star off his car and bolted it onto his Caprice. Then what did he call it?
That's something. I've heard that you're supposed to be crazy. But when you witness it, with your own eyes, it's pretty fascinating. So... I'm going to give you back that fancy tear jerker. You'll need it sooner than I will.
- I know where which one is. Explain it to me, Juli. You gain fame and run away at the best moment. No, when it was over. Fame only lasts a second. I enjoyed it and disappeared.
I was trying... to die... and so at least my death has a meaning. All I ask... is that you always take good care of her. I swear it. I don't want to be buried with the victors. A war only ends well if you lose it.
I'll make a lot of money soon. How much? - Your safe is full of cash. $150,000 or more. I'll have someone open it for me in the morning and I'll memorize the combination. And at 2:00, I'll meet with Mr. Success.
I'll be happy to come along and you show me how to fill out an agreement. I thought we'd both do it here... at the office. Why don't you give me some time with my grandson? It's been 20 years, for Christ's sake... Good. By the way, I was able to convince my old boss to write my last paycheck, and I have to pick it up at two o'clock.
Are you hungry? - What? - Let's have lunch. I'd love to, but I have to pick up my paycheck. Why don't you have it mailed to you?
So I guess I can hardly say no, as much as I would like to. Thank you very much. That's very kind of you. What should I do with the check? - Send it to 6325 White Oak Highway,
- I am not here to draw conclusions. I am here to find objective evidence for a parallel program. Forgive me, but I doubt you are objective. Everyone knows you support a deal with Iran. Just like everyone knows you're convinced they're undermining it.
- And you will tell Dar Adal? - I will. - Thank you. - You must be pleased. And you disappointed. Just because I think there are benefits to the deal doesn't mean I'm any less concerned if Iran undermines it.
So they looked at it in the light of day and let you go out of the goodness of their hearts. - What do you mean by that? - I'm saying... Pressure was exerted. I exerted it.
- Ma'am, do you need something? - My team. Wait, what's going on? Say again. The van with the bombs on board... Sekou drove it.
- No, no. No "but." Nothing. I did nothing. After you pressed me about old times, I did entirely what I had to do. I filled out a contact report and sent it upstairs.
For example, she brought the mentally disturbed veteran Peter Quinn into her home. I thought I explained that? That led to an incident where Mr. Quinn held Franny and her nanny hostage for several hours. - I wrote that in detail in my report. - I have read it.
I expect you to keep everything gleamingly pure. "Gleaming?" Pure. The stove is like a servant. You have to kick it sometimes to make it work.
Take a breath. - I don't know. You're gonna go all Agatha Christie on me and tell me who did it. You're gonna stick that stump up your ass. You want me to stick it up my ass?
There is an alien inside me? Your teacher must think so. Rory Adams Flight Engineer Here's another question from Mari, age eight. Do you bring the alien with you to Earth? No, we keep it and study it here where it's safe.
And how does he feel now? Like a bird. But don't get me wrong. I don't hate my chair. I love it.
Like a bird. But don't get me wrong. I don't hate my chair. I love it. For the sake of the anonymous genius who invented it.
- No. They work independently. Can we run a remote diagnostic? The transmitter's malfunctioning. But we can only get to it from the outside to make contact with Earth.
I lure Calvin into boat A with the candles. I close the hatch. I press the button for full manual steering. If I can hold the stick, I can change course. And if I hold it long enough, I can prevent reentry.
A transport vehicle will take you to the Alterplex command center. Stay where you are. Since the dawn of mankind, we have strived for things beyond our capabilities. We have watched the birds and built airplanes to fly. We have watched the moon and built rockets to reach it.
Dr. Brennan. - I think you need to come with me. Let's find you a place to sit. - No. Dr. Faulk warned us that someone would interfere, manipulate the case.
And I need your advice. I'd say go for it, but you already shot me in my arm once. I need your honest opinion. Do you think I really have a shot at getting this job as a lead anthropologist? Because the thought of not getting it makes me feel like a failure.
Hattie Finnegan? I don't know who that is. That's a resident who died a month ago. - Wait, that account is still active. - Yeah. And someone was using it to sell prescription drugs online.
And I'm assuming these are Dr. Sweets' notes.... All of them with Dr. Addy? Yes. Booth and I were already reading through all of them, hoping to find something that might exonerate Zack. But we could definitely use someone with your expertise. Agent Aubrey, if you would pursue your desire instead of fighting it, I think you would be able to get back to the important stuff.
Take your food from my car. Nice tools you got, too. Is that blood on that wrench? Dude, I don't know who you think you are, but if you don't take that away, there's going to be a lot more blood on that wrench. Put it down.
Dustin's not saying anything, Ray. Dustin's dead. I don't believe you. I think you're trying to trick me. Ray, I could trick you by pretending to throw a ball at you and have it disappear in my hand.
According to this, there might be one left. Hayley. You searched for five years. You found nothing. Suddenly I hear about a clue. What if someone else found it too?
Does that help with the guilt, considering what you are? What did you say? Keelin, you have to listen to me. - How do you know my name? - I got it from a friend.
Were you drunk? - No, butterflies are the classic. - They're stupid. Ok, I'm sorry I didn't take your artistic advice and get a butterfly. I think it's beautiful.
- I don't like your name very much. - What? Ellen doesn't suit you. It's too old-fashioned. - I never really liked it.
- What? Ellen doesn't suit you. It's too old-fashioned. - I never really liked it. - Then change it.
You'll be fine. - You're asleep anyway. - Yes, I'm tired. There's a chamber pot. If you need it...
And you will pay for it. You didn't mention my backyard. Well, your garden is part of the backyard, so it's automatically included in the ground that goes to Jenn. The garden is part of the house, mom. I think they should mention it by name in case some dirty judge wants to trick.
Half a rainbow? Aren't you going to finish it? No. When you're done, I'm done. You know, your clients seem to like the rainbow. Do you think they'll miss it?
Anyway, here's the thing... That shit is expensive. Really expensive. Mom works hard for tuition. She's a medical assistant in a doctor's office. I'm not eligible for financial aid because dad's in trouble with the IRS. Another fucked-up story from a troubled girl. Anyway, so... I stole a check and used it for drugs.
So all of this is just a bunch of crap? Including the key? No, the key was real. And it means everything. But I didn't want you to find it.
I have to go to the bathroom! Now, now, no premature outbursts. We need everything you've got. Aki, whatever you're going to do, you don't have to do it, you don't have to do it.... If you want to pick the best apple, you have to pick it straight from the tree.
I'm not... I'm not smart enough. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, kid. - No, no, it's not your fault. All right, plan B, then. If we have the controller, he can't hurt us. So we steal it from this dandy sack, shock him until he falls over, and get out of here.
The race is mine! Oh, please. There's no bigger dandy than me. There's a reason you failed. Do you want to hear it?
Move. Hey, dude... welcome to paradise! Can I get a beer? Oh, I love, love this little pit stop. Yeah, we'll see how much you love him when we lose and our heads explode.
He once ordered the number 3 with potatoes and coffee.... fearlessly ordered salsa... and paid with cash from his front left pocket. Took his tray, sat down at a table on the east side of the diner. - And set the backpack on the floor. - Where? Under the bench between his legs. No one touched him.
I have to get back to work. - Don't writers work in cafés? Do you want me to show you around? As long as you promise to give me the coffee afterwards. Sure, I'll make it extra good.
And then everyone challenged me to poop in my hand. And I did. - I pooped in my hand. - Okay. And then I walked around there for an hour with a turd in my hand, presenting it to people:
You are finished. - You can't kill me. - Look here. I surrender to the authority of the Clave. Look at you. You have your stick ready to use and you can't use it.
How do you know that he wanted to communicate this? There is no other explanation. When the demon touched the sword, they both dissolved. Luke, I've never seen a demon like that. Then find him.
- Are you sure? She's about this tall, with pigtails, always wears a scarf. Hey, where did you get that scarf? Nowhere. I found it.
As a last resort, the soul sword destroys all the underworlders. The angel Ithuriel. Valentine wanted to activate the soul sword through him. Clary could have a blood connection with the angel and activate the sword. If Clary's death is the price, I'll pay it.
- I do not know where he is. If you're lying, may the angel help you.... If you were smart, you'd use me as bait. The only way to control a great demon is with the angel's cup. Azazel would do anything to destroy it.
- You wanted a brother so badly to share your pain. - Stop it! - I can't. That empty feeling that eats away at your soul and makes you wish you were dead, day after day.... It never ends. Take that pain, and use it.
- For Shado, that was it. No time for nostalgia. I know where they're going. Do any of you know anything about this place that might give us a tactical advantage? I've only seen it once, and that was from a distance.
- It's great. Could you tell Victor that I.... How do I say I thought the movie was great or that I'm a huge fan? He thinks the movie sucks. He gets upset when I mention it.
- Where's Walker's man? - Curtis and Rory are keeping an eye on him. I think she means they're protecting him from me. Oliver, I still think it's a mistake not getting the scumbag to tell us where he's selling. We won't have to. We'll know him within the hour.
Gentlemen, I will keep you informed of the status of this investigation. I would not panic just yet. We don't know if this report is admissible. I think it would be safer to assume that it is. The question is, who sent it to Pike?
I'll tell the vultures you're making a statement. Okay. Do you want me to write a draft? No. I'll write it.
- The prosecutor came to me and.... You are referring to Adrian Chase? That's correct. He instructed me to amend the report to suggest that the throwing star killer was responsible. This report. And you did that and signed it, even though you knew it was wrong, and then it was passed on to the police.
- The hood. - Yes. Reports of the man with a bow and arrow disrupt business, the Bratva and otherwise. That's interesting. I heard some reports myself that you were having trouble with Gregor because of his deal with me. I questioned him, yes.
- Death by Elevator. - This doesn't seem like Chase. At first I thought Chase might be trying to cover his tracks, but I couldn't find any connections between them. He still had his Argus security key on him. Why enter the elevator if you're not going to use it?
- What is it? The problem. After Damien Darkh stole my security implant last year, I put new protocols in place to seal off any sensitive Argus information or locations so no single person could access it. Access now requires two of those security keys. But Agent Pierce's key was not stolen. You found it on him.
- What is this thing made of, anyway? Keltium. It's a proprietary alloy developed by the U.S. government to repel nuclear explosions. Are you saying that even with a nuclear bomb down here, it wouldn't work? Cisco seems to have made this place such an impenetrable fortress that he turned it into an impenetrable death trap.
If they don't try hard, five, maybe six hours. - Okay. We're here. Now what? - The mainframe has a built-in cell chip, but our rewiring isn't generating enough kilowatts to power it up externally.
Did you come here to tell me that, or are you just wasting time? See you later. Pain. It's fascinating, isn't it? Some men would do anything to avoid it.
No, I don't, but only because you're wrong. I told you, Oliver, everyone around you is suffering as the price for your sins. And the only way to keep them from paying that price is to let me go. I'll find another way. Find it fast.
and not in a normal way. He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children. I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the curse. Even if he is dead, he could still persist. We will find a way to break it.
I don't want you to get any deeper into this than you already are. I don't like it, but okay. We're still searching Laurelhurst, but so far we've got nothing. We've already searched several blocks from the parked car. He parked it there so we could find it there.
The first time I saw a death grip on a dead person. I saw those symbols on his face when I was there.... and also on the cloth. Maybe there was more on the cloth than we could see. - Do you still have the staff with you? I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
Of course. - I can leave today. But first, let me show you this fabulous Indian. - My favorite. - Why do you think I picked him?
Jesus. Don't waste your powers. Or have you forgotten that you held me captive in this cellar for almost a year? I struggled against the chains. If there was a way out, I would have found it.
Jonathan is alive. Jace? Is he all right? I can only point you in the right direction. - You have to walk it yourself.
He's at the institute and well guarded, I assume? Only the elite guard knows where he is. It's the safest way. Jonathan went to Elliot and Dot about the mirror. He knows we have it, and he's going to get it. Yes.
That is, Jonathan came to the Institute without our knowledge. He is Valentine's son. We were trained to do the impossible. If Jonathan attacked Max and tried to steal the mirror... He wouldn't leave without it.
Your whip. A man on a mission. Wintergold is missing. I suspect Jonathan is getting closer to the mirror. I'll guard it myself.
- He got away somehow. Are you all right? Does he have the mirror? No. And no one will use it to destroy the underworld.
I am not so sure. Even with our pure angelic blood.... Isn't it strange that Clary's runes can destroy an angelic insignia? And why wasn't the sword destroyed? What if it wasn't the angels' mirror? Why did your mom have warlocks protect it?
Even with our pure angelic blood.... Isn't it strange that Clary's runes can destroy an insignia of the angels? And why wasn't the sword destroyed? What if it wasn't the angels' mirror? Why did your mom have warlocks protect it? She thought he was.
- We have to leave. - What happened? My position at the Institute has been blown. Where's the mirror? I said, where is it? Clary took it from me.
-Yes. It's good to see you again. It's the only thing I'm doing for myself right now. -I have my appointment at... -Yeah. You rescheduled it for later, -and Gwen will take care of you.
Hot buns Hey, Claire. Don't do that! - Suck, suck. Suck it.
For the best change for you. Ever heard of a vape? Man, I can roll a joint, okay? At least I think I can. Smoke it before you talk shit.
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Is this seat still available? I was holding it for someone, but he's late. Here you go.
No, he's... he's... my friend. It's getting cold. - What? - The tea. My mother always drank it scalding hot, you know.
Probably something more... More poetic? We're not poets, Tarly. - Archmaester, just a moment... - This is your moment. Use it wisely.
- What? - Do you want coffee? Coffee? Come on. Go get it.
We were really cute with each other. So, uh... let the goodbyes be sweet, too, okay? Are you saying no? Drive. I really like this song. Will you sing it for me?
We can't help it if they fill their time differently now. That's all you do. Fill their time. We have given back. We gave them meaning. Then give it to them again.
I hear it when a voice has not yet shouted abundantly. Anyway, I don't belong here. I was just down the pub for a pint of ale. Good lad. I was even going to pay for it when some wanker pushed his way in like he was fucking King George.
You can do this, Wallace! - I don't know why you even ask him. - What was Wells doing with me? His plan was more methodically constructed than John Doe's in "Seven." And he had a little more time to work it out, like 15 years.
- Hold on, everybody! - What's happening? - We're going to move the train. - How are we going to do that? I'm going to vibrate it.
- What is happening here? - We are going to move the train. - How are we going to do that? I'm going to vibrate it. I'll vibrate it fast enough so it can phase through there.
Is it gone? If Savitar gets his hands on the stone... - He'll get away for sure. - You can't get rid of that stone, Wallace. You're not fast enough to throw it into the Speed Force all by yourself.
- She is not breathing. - We need to call an ambulance right away. H.R., grab the crash cart. Cisco, grab the oxygen. Roll it over here!
What else is unique about the shellac flakes? It's the accelerant used in all the arson cases associated with Heat Monger. Such an embarrassing name. I like it. I think he's great.
With pleasure. Here you go, after you. Thank you. Reminds me of "Jaws." They didn't show the shark because they couldn't afford to make it look good.
- Why didn't it work? - I spent an eternity in a trap like this. Do you think I didn't know how to prevent it from happening again? The Philosopher's Stone. It's made of calcified Speed Force energy, and you gave it to me. No...
I want to figure out how to get back at her. And since our only weapon is currently traipsing around Paris... - You mean the tuning fork? - Actually, it's called the Rod of Arcedius. - Cade's enemies forged it in the fire that killed him.
I am so sorry that this happened to you. But you will forget that night in the hospital. You will pull yourself together and turn your life around. When you get a check in the mail from Stefan Salvator, you will ask no questions. You will cash it and put the money to good use.
I called around about all the hunters who died. Every one of them had years of experience. We got a letter from Eileen. Eileen? She sent it four days ago.
In a... real rat? Wasn't so bad, actually. Gave me time to think. You know, I focused on keeping my job for so long. Never realized I hated it.
-Do not shoot! Don't shoot! -Shoot them! Shoot them! Threw him back again.
I hate it when others decide about me. I go to bed when I want to. I don't care about food pyramids. I don't care what Titus says, I'll wear gloves before my coat. How do you button it?
I'll take care of it. And tell your grandson to pay for dinner at Tony's. And here... Give him back his fucking watch. Keep the bat, bought it at Herb's 10 minutes ago.
Where was it hidden? The sound sounds good, so he wasn't between the sofa cushions? Wrapped tightly in an emergency blanket. Out of sight. So I didn't get a chance to see him in your house.
I can't suddenly become a commercial filmmaker. Wait. Repeat after me: For a short time, we'll shoot your commercial today and air it tomorrow. For a short time, we'll shoot your commercial today and broadcast it tomorrow.
Free of charge. I'll shoot the commercial for free. Free of charge? You want to shoot this commercial for free? I'll shoot your commercial and broadcast it.
I don't want to be petty. But this commercial doesn't actually belong to you. It is the physical and intellectual property of Saul Goodman Productions. - Hardly. It's our faces. - Our store. And my commercial, you can't show it without my permission.
Riverdale police combed the river looking for Jason, but he was never found. If he is dead, Hal, I hope he suffered in his final moments. - Jason Blossom should burn in hell. - He is missing. So a week later, the Blossom family buried an empty casket, and Jason's death was declared an accident as the story Cheryl told made the rounds. Cheryl had dropped a glove in the water and Jason had leaned down to get it out. In the process, he said, the boat flipped over. He panicked and drowned.
The Registry could use a Lois Lane like you. I think I know something that might help with the investigation. - Cheryl said she heard a gunshot. - She claims she did, yes. I heard it too.
- About you. She believes in you, Archie. So do I. What a revelation. When did you have time to write it?
Make way, outsider. Quite a déjà vu experience. Twelfth grade, we're watching Candyman's Curse here. I hated that movie. You picked it out.
Fortunately. What am I not wearing? The ring, Polly. The ring has been in the Blossom family for generations. Always keep it close to your heart.
What am I not wearing? The ring, Polly. The ring has been in the Blossom family for generations. Keep it close to your heart always. But don't tell Penelope I gave it to you.
The ring, Polly. The ring has been in the Blossom family for generations. Keep it close to your heart always. But don't tell Penelope I gave it to you. She'll come and cut it off your finger.
Hello, Mr. Andrews. - What's the matter? - Well... I just told you. Did you hear about the SoDale contract? Andrews Construction got it.
I'm sorry, Ethel. What my family did to yours. What your father did is not your fault. And you were the only one there for me. And not just once. The seat's still open if you want it.
What did you find? My grandma's ring. The one she gave to Jason. He asked me to marry him with that ring. Then why does your mother have it?
He asked me to marry him with the ring. Then why does your mother have it? I don't... Hands off, Gollum. The only way she could have it is if Jason gave it to her or your dad. He would never have given it away.
Not just at Thornhill, all over the city. You can feel it. Something nasty is coming. Your article was great, by the way. Good, because I've already posted it on the Blue Gold website and the paper version will be out tomorrow. FP JONES INNOCENT
Come on. We're doing great. You're expecting too much of yourself. Everything's gonna be fine. Can we talk about the earring? You kept it for a reason, and I know you say that chapter is closed, but there's no such thing as an absolute.
You said you drove by Falls Lake last night. Yes. We pulled two bodies out of the lake that night... Jim Blackwell, as I said, and an unidentified female. Her body was too decomposed to identify, but we're working on it.
You don't hear that they are from Montgomery. Tallulah is an actress. Is she, darling? I love your Southern accent. Don't lose it.
- Mr. Broun. Pleased to meet you. I read the Tribune, of course. - And I've read your debut novel. Quite an interesting... What did I call it?
Pleased to meet you. I read the Tribune, of course. - And I read your debut novel. Quite an interesting... What did I call it? We all know what you called it, and also that you were wrong.
You were right. It's like riding a bicycle. So you don't think my novel will stand the test of time? I can't say that I do. I haven't read it.
That will be all. Thank you. Why did you send Tana away? You didn't feel like it. All right, I'll get it myself.
Or a kiss? At what point do I stop acting like a Muslim? I could eat ham. Nobody said anything about ham, but you don't have to wear a hijab. - I can't just take it off.
- Oh, God. You understand. I didn't wear my hijab today because I was mad. But if I'm honest, it always felt foreign. I never wore it at home until I was forced to.
I hate it! I hate you! The mirror belonged to my grandma. So what? I always thought it was ugly.
-Do you think so? -Don't flatter yourself. -Is that so? There's a good article in the New England Journal of Medicine about the first 90 days after a stroke. Read it out loud to yourself.
-Is that so? There is a good article in the New England Journal of Medicine about the first 90 days after a stroke. Read it out loud to yourself. -Good! I read it with a British accent.
- What? Why? Well... I know you've been through hell but we're afraid "Last Exit" might be too inspiring. Too good, then? Sometimes one suicide attempt leads to another, especially if you glorify or romanticize it.
You would never survive what I survived. I guess we'll never find out. What are you going to do with this letter? I don't know yet. Who have you shown it to?
I guess we'll never find out. What are you going to do with this letter? I don't know yet. Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?
You are afraid, aren't you? What are you afraid of? You have done nothing wrong. No one is going to hang you. You're afraid I'll show it to Jon
Go! Now! You're faster without the hammer. Give it here! Give it here!
Something activates the dormant virus and only Arias knows what it is. Until we find out... everyone is a potential weapon for him... the living and the dead. If we don't figure this out... there won't be any small towns left where you can drown your sorrows... in alcohol ever again. I found a vaccine. I tried it on myself and it works.
- Exactly the. 239 plus tax. Do I get a discount? How? - You can find out. Do you want it or not?
According to the radiation detector, I had a dirty bomb. I had this one with me. I found this on the farm when I was a kid. On the edge of the pond. I was skipping rocks, eventually found this nice black rock and took it.
Don't screw up. Where are you taking me? Get out of here. You're Will Bowman's other son. I knew your name once, but I'm afraid I've forgotten it.
Where was it again. There! Found it. Hold on. There you go. He knew he had to write back or call to say he didn't want the space. But somehow he couldn't get the envelope out of his pocket to send it.
The last time we saw each other, weren't we talking about your movie Pattycake? The movie you were watching when that monster dumped the body in your front yard. That was a terrible night. I'll never forget it. I went to see it because you made me excited about it.
A woman lay dead on the floor with you. Because of your fragile ego. You panicked. You went into the neighbor's garage and cut her up to make it look like a serial killer. The cuts were so sloppy because your hands were so creamy and the tools slipped away. Then you cut up her body and threw it in your front yard.
Something ... uh... Something's wrong with it. Could I talk to him for a second? Stay the hell away from me. Something's wrong. Like with the toilet? We had a locksmith here, and he couldn't get it open.
What just happened? We're not coming up from the floor. No, my back. What happened to my back? You were trying to help and you hurt it.
Driving around town looking for a fence without a gate? I might as well hang myself. - What the hell... What are you doing in my car? I was cleaning it and I fell asleep.
-Oh! -Well... Listen, we don't want to draw attention here, Judy. Could you go take a shower and leave us alone? Still mad at me after all these years, really? -My record player... -You never used it.
-Hey, what brings you here? -I read the article. We have a website visitor. Bud counts too. -You read it?
No. I can't! "For the triumph of evil, it is enough for the good to do nothing." My father had framed this saying and hung it in the living room. I saw it every day.
They say I'm a snorer, so when it gets annoying, you just nudge me. Are you expecting someone? Only the stars. Have you considered that maybe God has a reason for disappearing? Sure, but I want to hear it.
You can say no, but would you please come with me? - Can I show you something? - God, of course. - I love this place. Don't you? - I hate it.
It's that simple. So damn simple. Oh my... Would be great if there was a lid on it. -I couldn't find it.
-Yeah, I noticed that too. I guess I didn't think we'd bury the box. What did you think, honey? That we'd take it with us, clean it, put tax documents in it? Which we can't, because the lid's missing. -All right, I won't look for it.
It's grueling. You know the saying, "Waiting for the other shoe to drop"? Yes. It emerged in the late 19th century when people started moving into big cities and living above each other in these huge apartment buildings where night after night after night they had this shared experience where tenants would hear their neighbors coming home from work by the thousands, sitting down, taking off a shoe, dropping it on the floor, right?
Yeah, I don't know if there's a word for them, but.... I know what they do. They get inside your head... - and feed. - Feed on what? Well, they feed on your sleep. Basically, they steal it.
We are looking for a little background on some of the employees, Scott Mudgett and Eddie Holmes. Do you know them? I don't take care of the property on a daily basis. I inherited it from my grandfather.
Okay. Okay. - Set up the cameras so you have a view of the entire room. - Copy that. And the only way And the only way to hear us is with these headphones, but don't plug them in until you're in your room.
Exactly. And where you gave me the key. Nick! I brought the key. Here, uh... I'll give it back to you.
Look what David has in his hand. Oh, my God. I thought David killed Goliath with a slingshot. He also had a staff, but for some reason that part of the story is not supported. Apparently David left this very staff to his descendants, and the Davidic kings use it as a scepter until the destruction of the temple, when it miraculously disappeared.
How can I help you? One moment, please. This is Dispatch. You have a call from 235. Will you take it?
Yesterday you got along fine. -But I... -When things go wrong, the others step in. This is an important moment for the company, Carlos. You're jeopardizing it with your flirting.
-You will not be unemployed. Carlos destroyed the dialer. I think he's going to stop. I think something else. They're rebuilding it. Miguel says it'll be operational soon. Let's go.
-One? A million for you. Are you installing the dialer here? Good news travels fast. I thought you destroyed it after your father died.
Do you love me? -Lidia... -Do you love me? Will you do it for me? Forget about the dialer, we'll go on without it.
One less problem to worry about but there are others. The girls lose their jobs. They accuse me of concealing the dialing machine. If only you'd listened to me. I told you so. You could steal it, but you'd break the rich boy's heart.
I steal the plans. Too late. The machine is built. But not patented. Only the person who has the patent can build and install it.
And someone else's. Miguel, we know you quit. Yes, but that doesn't change anything. The voting machine will be unveiled tomorrow. We want to sabotage it.
Because it's about a baby. You want to merge? Jessica, you've been pushed off the summit. You won't make it back to the top without help. My name has been in first place too long, I can't see it in last place again.
- When did you do this? - Half an hour ago. You said 3:00, so I called them in for 2:30 because I knew you wouldn't give me the opportunity to meet with them, just like I know the other side will walk up to them if you're not there. - They can't. Because it's unfair? - Because it's illegal. - Only if she charges them. Which she will never do, because they will find out what her vulnerabilities are, and then they will offer her exactly the amount she needs to survive, and then she will take it.
Maybe I have, but the truth is, I'm not ready either. What do you say you and I act as interim managing partners? I would be honored to do that. I think the first order of business should be what do we do with the firm name? I don't know about you, but... I think we should leave it exactly as it is.
Ten thousand dollars, not a penny more. Through all my experience at an inner city law firm, I know you are authorized to go up to 20, so let's say 25 and leave it at that. 25.000 $? A criminal charge, Linda. If I were you, I would write the check, consider it a bargain, and hope the little boy doesn't get any worse.
Get out of here, you weirdos. You don't know what you're missing. - That suit was so... - Tight. Tough to get out of, I think. Or he never takes it off.
Then I moved. So the bill was lost. And that unpaid bill for $19 screwed up my credit rating. And the real low blow: the bra didn't fit. I only wore it twice.
What should I do? It's like She Loves Him - She Loves Him Not. I never saw that movie. I had a ticket, but I didn't go. I wonder what my life would have been like if I'd seen it.
And a little bit off. So it's going to be great. Yeah, sure. This jumpsuit. Where did you get it?
-We should have more. -How many more? Ten, 20, 50, as many as we find. One stubby tail isn't enough. We'll make it bigger.
They made us all sign these things. If any of us violate it, it nullifies them all. So nullify them all. That's easy for you to say. I'm dying of something with a name so long I can't even tell you.
Which means this thing is going to take forever. And we're going to go all in on him as soon as he gets to Harvey. Now I don't want to see you again until I meet you for the first time at the hearing. Don't run away from me. I hired Harvey to do a job, he passed it on to you against my will, and you're going to fucking listen to me.
Yeah. I'm not so sure about that. Soon they'll find the ones we took out. What's the situation? We have good news and bad news. The good: the truck is parked by the tool shed, so we can take it out.
Soon they'll find the ones we took out. What is the situation? We have good news and bad news. The good: the truck is parked by the tool shed, so we can take it out. The bad: a squad of heavily armed men is guarding it.
Probably much more than she pays you. If you want this to be an offer, go ahead. We have two choices. Either I crush that case to the size of a baseball and nobody gets what they want, or.... Or we kill you and take it.
I don't know. The code is advanced. 5th generation syntax. I have never seen anything like this before. Whenever I want to change it, it goes back to the old one....
And how are you going to cure death? By turning me into an android? I've stopped with robotics. My breakthrough goes far beyond that. I call it the system.
But to be honest, I feel a sizzle there, sexual and all, so I'll probably give it a try. But it will probably go wrong. Americans... They talk too much. Our biggest weakness. Our unit was told an object was found here. We are to recover it...
You are in danger. I have so many memories of snow. My first ice skating on the neighbor's pond. A month stationed in the French Alps. But in truth, this is the first time I've seen it.
This is a serious accusation. Someone is deceiving us. You know, my father always said you have to have faith to be deceived. Treat the mole like cancer. - I'll cut it out myself.
You know what? How about we make some popcorn and watch a movie? "Chopping Mall"? - That stupid robot movie again? - Come on, you love it too.
Daddy! - She's just a kid! Let her go! No! - Daddy! Daddy! The hangar was a mess when we found it.
If Hydra sends a quinjet, there's bound to be an assault team on board. - They know we're here. - What do you want to do? Burrows, take the film. Take it back to base.
My head, which you cut off, now controls many of these machines. And you don't know where it is. So do what you want with this body. My plan is already in motion. And nothing can stop it now.
I could have gone in, could have broken the window, but didn't. Y_BAR_ Imaz believed that Deniz could change. But the more he was punished, the more he resisted. Deniz's room key. Keep it.
Hey, man. - Hey. Am I glad to see you. - Yeah. I gotta get rid of this backpack. I can't take it.
Can someone take the backpack? - Yes. You need to get in there and give a muff lecture. Holy crap. I got him.
Something about the hands. Joel played trumpet in high school, so he's good with lips and hands. And he has a sense of rhythm. But thanks for your advice. I don't think you'll take it.
Y'All step back, I'm 'bout to dance Suits S07E01 "Replay" - presented by SubCentral.de translated by convenio - I'm just letting the feel of my new office sink in. Do you think a bike rack would fit on this wall? You put a bike rack in here, you'll be representing yourself at your first free consultation after I shove it up your ass.
-I would be ready. -Not yet. There he is... Oh, God, no! Where is he? I need him.
That was funny. That only helps in the short term. We need a plan. I love this room here. The way the light comes in and dances with the colors on the wall. I don't just need to use this room, I want to use it.
Because you killed our neighbor. What's the plan? Are we going to keep him? Am I finally getting a brother? We have a plan, but I don't think you'll approve.
What do you want? My wife's life is in danger and so is yours if you don't give me the stick. -You're pissing again. -Can't stop it. Here you go.
Because I didn't fly all the way here to put pressure on the woman. And I know the story of the wind and the sun. What the hell are you talking about? She's talking about Aesop's fable. Which says in essence that if you want to get a man to take off his coat, you don't blow it off his body, you make it warm, and he will take it off himself.
The last monarch rises in June. The last monarch rises in June. The tank has a regulated power supply that keeps it locked. We must first disconnect the generator, - then pry it open.
Unfortunately, I can't. The ship's primary temporal surveyor was lost in the impact. What if we find the surveyor and fix everything somehow? All systems would be back to normal. I'll get it.
- We have to get out. - No. - Why not? The white Martians have tampered with the reactor. You have to shut it down. No.
But why not go to him? This guy conjured up... - Hey. - What? Oh, my gosh. He conjured up a bad guy and unleashed him on National City.
I love saying it like that. Hey, come on. Not even a smile? What's up? I'm trying to decide if I'm going to blog my article myself. - What happens if you blob it?
- The fact that I'm a prince doesn't change anything. - Not the way I feel about you... - It changes everything. It's bad enough that you lied, but that you're the prince too? I thought you were just born on a cruel planet, but you ruled it.
Even if we free him, it does not mean that he will also release her. - She's his insurance policy. - Okay, people, let's get to work. Winn, any luck with Alex's implanted tracker? He's been offline since 10:00 P.M. Whoever's holding her turned it off.
I want what I have suggested. I want us to build a transmatter portal together. It exists where I come from. L-Corp has already built a large generator ring. We could adapt it very easily.
Where he broke in, stole a deadly virus, and used it to kill aliens in this here bar. He discovered that your cousin kept a phantom zone projector among his Kryptonian artifacts. A projector? That sounds technically simple. They used it to beam prisoners up to Fort Rozz immediately.
A projector? That sounds technically simple. They used it to beam prisoners up to Fort Rozz immediately. - That's very high-tech. - I can convert it to beam us up to the Daxamite starship.
If you want to be Secretary of Education, you should read more than just one book every four years. That's mean. - By the way, I told your air conditioning joke today. I stood there like a fucking idiot. Thanks for that. I'm sure you told it wrong.
It's okay, Don. I know she called you. Well, listen, I have a couple of hours to offer if that's something you're interested in. You know anything about a snowplow? You know, it's got a steering wheel, so I can drive it.
- What is this, a suffering contest? Because I admit defeat. You're an asshole, to answer your question. You don't just get into this job, Delorme. You don't do it half-assed until something better comes along.
The gentleman I was talking to, please wait for me. Governors, we are running out of time. You have come to this emergency meeting on short notice. This shows the people that you are as concerned about their safety as I am. Terror is unacceptable. I will not tolerate it.
Did you see her? I'm gonna go say good night to Hope. Hayley, wait. That's an impressive boundary spell. Unfortunately, it only lasts as long as the witch who cast it.
There will be no exchange. She needs Elijah's death to channel the energy from his sacrifice. She poisoned him with rose thorns. She wants the bone today. If she doesn't get it, she will take it.
Marcel. "Olivia Tierra Del Robles." Tierra means "land," as in "defended by the hearts." Look out. There's our bone. - Give it to me.
- Angie, are you kidding me? - What? You had it in your belt! I didn't even know I was wearing one. I must have put it on when I was high.
Lot. -Go. Go ahead. -Miss Garrison. I don't know your operation. Accordingly, I have no tips on how to improve it.
Are you on my team? I'm on it. Hey. I wanted to tell you how I got on. You ever been in a sleazy hotel where the TV is chained to the wall? Even if I could somehow get the TV loose, it wouldn't do me any good to steal it. After all, I don't have a home anymore.
-So... -Are there instructions included? I'm not big on instructions, so that fits. But if it says in a book that it's edible, can we...? We can eat it?
I've never met people so completely and so personally, and I can't wait to celebrate, to appreciate the magnitude of this success when it's all over. 15,888 KM OUGHT Hopefully people understand that we're not ocean rowers. We're not people who have done a thousand crazy things. That hasn't stopped us from dreaming a big dream and making it happen.
The one percent. - The one percent. - That's right. I want to keep my one percent neck. I just had it tightened up in January after Colicchio said it had more rings than a cookie roll.
Even technology has become a weapon in their hands, used to poison our minds. I know you are in pain. I know you are afraid, but it doesn't have to be that way. There is a way out of the darkness. I can show it to you.
They cannot fight. - Their power has been taken away from them. - Hide yourselves. Like frightened little children! I know a way out of here. I have walked it before.
What did you do? You are not the only one who is special, little brother. You used to fight for the right causes, Waruu. The younger hunter, he made a stronger, much bigger boomerang. He takes the boomerang, smears it full of blood like lava.
Wendy, I'll drive you to the station. -Ok. Go. -You can take my car. -Is it running again? -Yeah, I had it fixed.
-Crazy. But you have to do what I say, okay? Every last detail, so listen up. When you go into the trailer, you put on a movie. Turn it up really loud.
It's going to cost me my family, okay? The deal stood. You could have come home. Now guys are gonna be looking for answers that I don't have. They made a deal with us, and they're gonna keep it.
I can't see anything. I tried to warn you that there was something out there. You wouldn't listen to me. What was it? My dog ran into the fog and something killed him.
If it explodes, you will destroy the entire ship. That's the plan. And the ship? I was a prisoner on that ship. I hate this place, but we need it.
- I saw it. - I'm sorry. I, uh... The shadow you feel inside you? Talking will get rid of it.
- I'm fine. But listen: - The deal with the Cubans... - We're calling it off. I'll call Esteban and we'll postpone it, okay?
- No. - Has the vizier died? - The vizier is not dead. Then why did you bring us the vizier's finger? And if you brought it, why did you touch our buttocks with it?
Go! Show me. Show what? Our dance? I didn't learn it.
Show me. Show what? Our dance? I didn't learn it. I didn't think it was that important.
Me too. My ass still hurts. Enough! Listen up. I can't stop the curse, so the plan is to let it run its course.
Suggestion. Remember that Sumerian protection spell we learned in school? How to protect yourself from shattered glass or something? The spell is simple, but it doesn't mean it's not powerful. Especially if all three of us use it.
Here is a photo. When the car was launched in 1990, it was remarkable because it was fast and exciting like a Ferrari. But unlike Ferraris of the time, it was also incredibly reliable and very easy to drive. Honda stomped it out twelve years ago. But now there's finally a successor. And I tried it out on our test track.
You cost our production company 10,000 pounds. Not true. I set a minimum price. What is it? - 100,000 pounds. 100.000? - So you didn't sell it and cost us 14,000 pounds.
- I am completely objective. You have seen it. It's super! Now we have to find out how fast the Quattro thing is on the Eboladrome. And for this purpose we give it to a man who thinks tennis is an invention of Stalin.
Until he comes back up. I can't go on. - I'm dizzy. Let's keep going. Why don't we just hook it up to the generator?
Switch to manual. Murphy. Thanks. We've got to catch them before they get to Polis with the fuel. They'll use it to make bombs.
Thank you. We have to catch up with them before they get to Polis with the fuel. They'll use it to make bombs. They'll kill everyone. You mean they're going to use it to wipe out the Ice Nation.
- What? The truck is not here. How the hell do you know? Because everybody does what's best for their own people. It was my men who took it.
We don't have that much cash around. How about a bill? Hawk... - What is it, Hawk? - They're delivering the flooring. They won't hand it over until we pay cash up front.
I'm not. I'm just glad you're... - Damn it. - You okay? I just want a coffee, and I can't even get that. - No, it's fine. - You need it more than I do.
Otherwise, they leave. Every single one of them. We have to protect this ranch with our lives. Or they will be slaughtered. Every last one of them. This place is all we have left. And right now, it's in jeopardy. The only thing that can save it is us.
He thinks I talked you into becoming independent. I'm sorry. -Hello. -Monsieur, there's a call for you from Paris. Will you take it?
Which Pablo? Yours? He's not my Pablo. Yes, he is. I gave him to someone...
-What does it say? -I don't know anymore. Marga! Where's the letter? I put it in the mailbox.
Father Pyrlig was also once a warrior. That's how it is. But you get tired of putting iron in other men's bellies. I'm sorry to leave you. - You have the letter safely stowed? - Yes, I did. I put it next to my privates.
I remember when I was a little boy.... I'm not here to talk about me. I'm here because of you. I am truly sorry that you lost your job. What can I do to bring it back? Nothing at all.
I didn't agree with that, but yes, I understand. - I have to earn your trust. - Not just mine. That of all of NATO. Very well, but I want to start with France. We dreamed this dream together for disarmament, and I need you to make it happen.
What? - Nowadays, people give their fingerprints so lightly. Unlocking your cell phone. Most people still don't understand that the real world is no longer the only reality. What happens to a fingerprint when the police find it?
Or a family man into a bomber. What do you want from me? - Give me the access code. Access code? - Kaufmann e-mailed it to me.
- He wants to play. So don't be a bore and let him. You'd better tell me what you've got. The code is too complex. I have to send it.
Everything clear? Now comes the "but." He enters the wrong date and travels back in time to the 1950s when she was a horny teenager and she spends the rest of the movie screwing him instead of his father. I've seen the movie. No. I haven't shot it yet.
What is that supposed to mean? We only talked about that on the way here. I'll bring the mare in. Take off your hat. Put it on the bench with your bag.
I've never been to one of these before. Can we go, Miss Cuthbert? Let's see. Diana and I are soul mates. She would be very sad if I were sent away. Take my shawl upstairs, please, and put it on my chair.
Initiation of ground launch sequence occurs. Raven. Becca. You can say it's none of my business, but why live in a hole in the ground when you have a 1A rocket? Are you ordering the ground or stabbing it?
What do you want me to do? Live? The radiation will be here in six days. You agreed to share the bunker with us. Why not share it with the Trikru?
Survival. You have tried to take the bunker for yourselves, and yet here I am, willing to talk. The Trikru Alliance holds the temple. Of course you are willing to talk. And the Azgeda Alliance has it surrounded.
You don't have to kill all twelve warriors. I only have to kill the last one. Octavia kom Skaikru is victorious. Skaikru will not take the bunker alone. We will share it.
One champion per clan, one death instead of thousands. Whoever wins gets the bunker. I fought for all of us. Skaikru will not take the bunker alone. We will share it.
It will be fine. We don't have any tools or weapons. Then we'll give her the extra suit. - We don't have an extra suit. - Yes, we do. Take it off right now.
Come. Clarke, you have to put on the suit. It was meant for Jasper. At least he's doing something good now. You should put it on.
- All right. Slow down. Breathing is also important. What's the plan for oxygen? According to what Murphy says about the lighthouse bunker, I'm guessing, no, praying, that there's an oxygen generator there. We'll take it with us.
Times slowly. Breathing is also important. What's the plan for oxygen? According to what Murphy says about the lighthouse bunker, I'm guessing, no, praying, that there's an oxygen generator there. We'll take it with us. You set it up.
- T minus 51 minutes and falling. Set it down. I've got it. Go find your glove. I can't find my other glove. - I can't find it Where's the other one?
Oxygen level critical. Hey, Monty, Monty, Monty, no. Hey, hey, it's connected. What do I do now? The switch, flip it.
And don't give me that crap about eating healthy being expensive. Go to the supermarket. They throw vegetables at you. "Here's the celery. Please take it with you!
She's talking to a gorilla. Who wouldn't talk to them?" I had forgotten my wife and shouted, "Ask him how much he can lift! Ask him how much he can lift!"
So, the... Kitten... was hit by a car.... and it's dead." The gorilla understood immediately. He understood it immediately. His lip began to tremble. He made the sign for "cry." And later in the evening he was heard crying in his house.
Then I felt my wife's head on my shoulder, and she said, "That was so sad. It was beautiful, but very sad." And I thought, "Get away from me. Get away from me." I closed the laptop, put it away, got up and paced.
The babies eat sand all the time. I turn around, sand. Where does the sand come from? I don't know. So I let them eat it.
Well, a neighbor called 911, and then the firefighters broke down the gate. Listen, they saved your life. Damn barbed wire. I had most of it down already and then I fell off the ladder into the whole mess. They took it down?
- The top coat, I know. Do you want some water? Do you want me to keep going? I brought my engagement ring with me to Seattle. It's in the house in my jewelry box and I want you to have it.
Do you want me to keep going? I brought my engagement ring with me to Seattle. It's in the house in my jewelry box and I want you to have it. - Mom. - Your father gave it to me.
I brought my engagement ring with me to Seattle. It's in the house in my jewelry box and I want you to have it. - Mom. - Your father gave it to me. He would want you to have it, too.
You two are not going anywhere. We can print the documents here. I know a guy with a printer. I hope it prints. I take it apart and put it back together every 2 hours.
No, verbally bad. Horrible grammar. I see. - Did you see the fight? - Everyone saw it.
That's who you've been suppressing. All the anguish and heartache you feel about what happened to your mother. And Chloe. I know it's hard. But the only way to get over that pain is to live through it.
That. I didn't think that was possible. It wasn't part of the plan. Maybe we... Maybe we'll make a new plan. And this time we'll do it together.
And guess who has the key? Don't keep me in suspense. Who is it, brother? It says that God entrusted the key to His favorite son. Of course he gave it to you.
What are you talking about? The only keys I got are these. What else did you bring to Earth, Luci? Your ring. I've never seen you without it.
- This is our end. - The trial happens... On a full moon, and the chief prosecutor turns into a werewolf. But for real. He says, "Objection." Then the judge throws the gavel, eats it or retrieves it.
You decided I was a lesbian, not bi. Fuck you for making decisions that are both of our business. Fuck you for half-heartedly following me around, you asshole duo. What are we going to do about the mush? We can ignore it, but I can still smell it.
Hey... Friend. Hey, friend. I hear you! Man, I didn't set no alarm. - I turned it off.
- Yes. I know. I'm okay. Candace, does the kit have a resuscitator? - I'll get it.
I was curious. Also, I was in the hallway. I thought I should clean up the huge, horrible tumor or something. - I have a huge, horrible tumor. - What? I was up all night studying it, and I think I did it.
- Yes. - ... please let him know. I'm clean, I swear. Sir, we're on high alert here. I need to see your I.D. I don't have it on me.
I... I spent six years in prison for doing some pretty bad things. So if that were the case, I would be the first one to be taken. What were you looking at? That gray shadow out there, can you see it?
- reddish-brown substance. - This is the liver. - Get the retractors. - Okay. Okay, I got the retractors. - Be ready to pull it out of the liver.
I knew for weeks that I wanted to hurt him. Then one day, after practice.... he smiled at me. And then what happened? I beat him up. I took his arm, twisted it behind his back, and broke it.
- No one said such nonsense. - No. No one said anything like that. The joke is a little outdated. - Should we update it?
That must be Dreyfuss. Indeed. But going after Dreyfuss now would be a costly distraction. The curse is out. And we need to narrow it down.
- Yes. I know what I saw. Could be right. I think I saw this place on a list of Dreyfuss' holdings. They're turning it into a server farm.
Let's take this moment to pause. And... become one with the loss. - Right? - Yes. And we need to take that loss... ...and hold it in our arms and tenderly care for it like a child. Only then can we let it go.
What the hell is this? Okay. Got it. The transmission's been interrupted. It's a British tradition. I had radio contact for a moment and lost it again.
He should have come himself instead of sending the chick squad. Rude. Well done, ladies. Star City owes you a debt of gratitude. We're just doing our job. Yeah, but you do it so well. And with such style.
What a surprise! So. - Name him. - Lord, if I may. And to save time and ink. Perhaps you'd like to name a price. An acceptable price, not an impossible one. Name it.
Stop being brave. I cannot stand brave people. I carve history in the stone. Give your name to the air. It will be seen for centuries.
I know that they do not work. This arrow is a tool. It lets you take a look at the person you love the most. The fairy told me about the man with the lion tattoo. You could use it to find him.
Cut the crap. Why are you here? Look, I just wanted to make things right. I don't want my job back. Good, 'cause you're never gonna get it back.
-Crap. Does she know I'm upstairs? -No, but she wants to see you. Is my briefcase down there? Yes. Put it in my car and I'll sneak out.
Now back to work. Make sure they don't scratch my table. This thing cost me a fortune. Come on! Don't! Put it down.
We can't tell her how bad her food is because that would destroy her. So when I found out that Chef Dumont was coming to town, I signed us up for his class so he could do it. I know. Pretty impressive, right? Now I just take the sensor and mount it....
It's my son. - Luke, what's wrong? - Dad? I think there's something wrong with the dryer. But I fixed it.
- Luke, what's wrong? - Dad? I think there's something wrong with the dryer. But I fixed it. I fixed it fine.
That's incredible. 23, if you count breaking in here. When did you have time to practice? My deal died. Actually, I blew it off.
That's right. I've barely dealt with it, though. I know you look down on me, Rachel. You're probably wondering why my sisters put up with me. But I've been in this fight from the beginning, even with Beth. Even before Sarah. And I'm gonna see it through to the end.
Oh no. Jon changed the code. What? What do you mean Jon changed the code? Well, sometimes he changes it.
- Hey, you. - Hi. - Oh, my gosh! What happened to your ankle? - I twisted it.
I'm fine. I think you're having trouble with your new job. I love my job. It's great. - I hate it.
I think you're having trouble with your new job. I love my job. It's great. - I hate it. I hate it so much.
I hate him so much. - He's awful. Marianne! He's all right. But you hate him. So don't stay, life is too short.
It's a virus, but not one she's ever seen before. Now that we have his mug shot, someone will know what it is. She found it very suspicious that it was both UV and chlorine resistant. She can't rule out that it's a natural mutation, but she said it's much more likely that our suspect was grown in a lab. Someone has engineered it as being specifically made to survive the protective glove of the water warranty.
That's Roy coming out of his law office. He is the defense attorney who is her opponent in the Pulaski case. Chantal's assistant admitted that Roy talked her into telling him when and where the two of you were meeting. Then Gulbenkian flooded her office with paperwork to keep Chantal from showing up. It was a trap. Chantal is probably the only female prosecutor who is up to speed on the case and qualified to lead it.
Hello Ravn. My condolences. I have done everything I could. I did everything I could with out breaking the law. If I believed in the treatment plan, I would have approved it.
What do you mean? You don't tell her anything. You got away with it. When I drive home drunk, I don't call the cops either. I pull over, pick up the mailbox I rammed, throw it in the trunk and move on.
- Cool. 6,500. Congratulations. This cop is way overpriced. I hope you get it home.
"Dear Maggie, Patsy Cline was playing on the radio and I thought of you. You've only been gone a few weeks, but it seems like forever. I don't know if my mustache suits me. I'm sure I'll shave it off again.
Great dream catcher. - What? - Your dreamcatcher. I hung it up the day I took over the bar. You're the first to notice it.
See you then. I missed that. We could do this every day. I told you not to ask Rooster. He fixed it.
He fixed it. None of this makes any sense. He needs a job, we have one. I offered him the job. He turned it down.
None of this makes any sense. He needs a job, we have one. I offered him the job. He turned it down. Did you offer it to him?
I called your house earlier. Yes. I'm sorry. Colt turned off my ringtone at church a while back. I don't know how to turn it back on.
Walnuts. - Hey! - Good, you're here. - I'm taking the truck to Mary's. - I need it tonight.
- I would like to speak to Lord Uhtred. - You cannot. - I want to serve him. - You can't. Now shut your mouth, or I'll stuff it with my boot.
Hammer! I've never flown in a helicopter before. Neither have I. I've had this gift certificate forever. - I need to cash it in.
I go in and ask. - Why do you have this plate? Watch out. - I'm... I'm... Or they'll call you a thief, too. No. The lady brought it to me yesterday when she was sad.
- You stop it. I hope they don't get confused. Seniors tend to do that. They don't like to, honey. I don't like this cookie. Then don't eat it.
That leaves little to the imagination, that's for sure. Well, I think you should decide for yourself what you want to do and be, and then go for it. Maybe school wouldn't be so bad now, with Diana and Ruby. You have a clear, lively mind, Anne. Why should you limit it?
I think you're really belittling this atrocity. Let me do the talking. Fine. I don't feel like talking. You spend 30 years nurturing a dream, only to see it go up in flames like Pete's eyebrow.
I thought about it Who comes here? There's nowhere to park here. Oh, my God, that's it... a parking lot. That's not bad. We can build it for practically nothing and pay off most of the loan tomorrow.
- Okay. What happened then? - Well, there's not much more to tell. I decided that my mother probably just thought of me as a kid because I never went through a rebellious phase, so I got an earring pierced. My mother made me take it out immediately.
They resemble seahorses, but they are 25 cm long dragons unknown to most people. But then came a year when they all disappeared from my favorite diving grounds. That was one of my all-time favorite animals. You ask yourself, "If one of my favorite creatures disappears, what else disappears?" And that's when I realized that the ocean has a big problem: You don't see it, you don't think about it. And that's a matter of advertising.
All cool. I got it. See ya. You forgot your cake! I'll leave it on the porch.
And that makes sense to me. You're a good person to talk to. Yes, you're good to talk to, too, which is good, or you'd go broke. When a Gentoo penguin chooses a mate, he makes an offer. He looks for a pebble, he takes his time to find the smoothest one, and he presents it to the female.
So when our guide Terrell said he had a way out of there, we all said "yes." This syrup thing was his idea? No, from a friend of his. This guy had all the details worked out. Knew where to get the syrup, how to get the boats, where to take it once it was on land.
He, and all the darkness you have ever faced, was born from a single depraved soul... that of the Black Fairy. And if we don't try to stop it, it will spawn much worse. How's it going, mom? It's... slow. Casting a sleeping curse is one thing, but breaking it?
I saw your parents. I realized something... something I saw the last time we talked. The expression of someone who needs hope. Henry had it all those years ago when he found me and told me I was the savior. Now you have it.
Have you never wondered why the Black Fairy collects all this dust? Many years ago, the Black Fairy used this dust to create a terrible spell. It was called the Dark Curse. The Dark Curse? She was obsessed with perfecting it and never stopped collecting dust.
Well, then I guess you're not going to New York either. - Back to your cell. - Okay. Wait. All right, I'll take him.
I'll let you in on a secret: This is Perrier mineral water. It's just shot into the air here. I recently heard that a cab driver found a gold bar worth 800,000 pounds in his car next to umbrellas and cell phones after a hard day's work. Someone had left it there and didn't even realize it.
One of the Unilu. Can I help you? Yes, can you tell me where the other market is? The what? Well, I guess they call it the black market.
Carefully take off the lid in the middle and put it on there. Aren't they poking through the suit? Are you sure? Do the same with the lid. Put it down neatly.
So you're not worried about them? Of course I'm worried about them. I was in the war in '96, I know what these things are capable of. But I also know what my daughter is capable of. And I know this planet is safer because she's defending it.
What am I supposed to do with this, Russ? NOT FOR DUKE! TOP SECRET So not for Duke. You're lucky you don't have anything to do with this. I'll do anything for your family's happiness. If I give it to them, we earn some goodwill. But then I'm cheating you. There must be a way to keep the cake and eat it....
You look reasonably happy. Good. Not good. Francis, enjoy this moment. You've earned it.
Okay. Shall Seth and I prepare a statement? Where is the truck? We don't know. When do we find him?
Phil Knight took the floor and said, "Glad you're here. We waited some time, but hopefully it was worth it. Please, Tinker." I'm more the type to touch things. He started talking and drawing and showing me all kinds of pictures of the shoe. But I have to hold it to be able to judge it.
These shoes were one of my favorite projects. Also because Michael finally opened up and told me things about himself. E.A.R.L. PRODUCT INTRODUCTION This is our first step toward total customization. The shoe laces itself when you put it on. Who tries it on?
a blank sheet of paper, an empty table, and usually someone sitting across from me. Either an artistic director, a playwright or, in the case of a pop show, the singer. Then we talk, and I sketch out what we're talking about. If we were talking about my work, I'd start by drawing a little pair of scissors. There's often something like that printed on cereal boxes. It's meant to be an invitation to cut open the cardboard, change it, and make something else out of it.
You make me the happiest man in the world. I don't know how to say this without sounding shallow, but I need to take a closer look at the ring. Yeah, sit, sit. It was my grandmother's. She hid it in her hollow wooden leg during the Great Depression.
Maybe it came in that way. Impossible. If it came in over the roof, there'd be broken tiles or monster tracks or.... or my monogrammed money clip. I got in through Joe's window last night because it was after curfew, and I must have lost the clip on the roof. I had to get it before Mom saw it.
But I know you're lying. Good. I was in here last night. I went through the window because I came in after curfew. I dropped my money clip and was about to get it.
Here I look like a cockroach. He must be here somewhere. - Who? - The figgy pudding. The palace chef prepared it and put it in the fridge somewhere.
After that, ask for the key. Stay cool. Tell me, my good man, could I have a little girl's room here? Here you go. Throw the key out the bathroom window, I'll take it to the locksmith.
Sounds racist. I just think of them as movies. You probably think I think they're documentaries, all right. I know through my black friends that when a new slavery movie comes out, the suggestion to watch it can't come from a white person.
That's how we win! No, we win when Neolution is exposed and Westmorland is stripped of its myth. Where's your smoking gun, Rachel? There's nothing here for you. You gave it to her.
In return, I want you and your people to leave my daughter alone. Forever. Or? No need for "ors." You'll understand a good deal when you hear it, and I'll only make the offer once.
I can see that. What's wrong? It's nothing bad. This letter is mine. -You read it?
Why did Thawne use the Holy Lance to shrink you? I don't think he did. I assume he used Dr Palmer's exosuit. It should still be in his lab. We'll steal it and make the ship bigger!
I do not control them. I believe in you. You are stronger than you know. There's no place like home. The cork broke, but I think I was able to save it.
Doesn't everyone? Is it a coincidence that "go ogle" in German is "geh gaffen"? -Yes, it's morally a gray area. -Ne! Some things are totally black and white. Newspapers, penguins in front of the blender, a rainbow as seen by dogs, and snooping around in other people's lives.
Including sticking a gun in your mouth and pulling the trigger. I'm sorry. I want to be helpful, but Cy prosecuted so many cases. The Kotite trial was big. People in England followed it very closely.
Ideas come in all sorts of different ways. I get the best ideas in the cab when I'm stuck in a traffic jam. That's when my subconscious takes control. And I can associate freely. You have to be in a playful mood, otherwise you can't design anything creative. You should start with this bar. Put it two millimeters down. With "pier" behind it, it will look great.
That's why I thought I would at least take a look at it. Speaking of mysterious vehicles. Marcus? You were right. A construction company in Astoria reported a truck stolen this morning. They said a drywaller took it yesterday for a job and never came back.
Would I be correct in thinking that your incarceration would cause concern for some of your former employers? So now would be a very good time to think about avoiding crowds. My assistant's name is D'Agostino. Mr. Azoff... is at the bottom of Jamaica Bay. I cleaned his truck and had it stripped at a garage.
Yes, but sometimes it is not. You're not the first girlfriend in this situation. Thanks, but no, I can handle it. My dear, there's a call for you. Do you think you're well enough to take it?
-Yes... and no. Why? We need a prototype that proves it works. Without the prototype, these papers are worthless. Once I build it...
How did you get this job? Was it legal? I will not be insulted. Carolina has the letter. She'll give it to your wife.
She will give it to your wife. That's why I'm here. No insults. What? I never read it.
That is why I am here. No insults. What? I never read it. She stole it from me while I was away.
I never read it. She stole it from me when I was away. It can't be. Because of Ángeles, I didn't have time to tell you. I don't know if she has it yet.
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Carlos, we need to talk. I know how this ends. That's actually my line. I think I even made it up.
I don't even want to think about that. I was hoping for some help. Thank you, Victoria. I need your photo for the ID. You'll get it today.
Good afternoon, Miss. I am Mrs. Pérez. Excuse me, I didn't see a ring. I'm allergic to gold. I had to take it off.
You kept your girlfriend a secret when you were courting me. It was a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes. -Break it. -Why... Break it!
-Here. -Thank you. -See that? -Yeah. Can you fix it?
His feet caught it! Come! I think he got into the blood with his toe. He hasn't got it yet. He's still got something to go, has to get momentum, and he's got it.
- Silke, smooth, baby! She goes to the next obstacle, Spinal Descent. She loves it! Oh no, her shoe is stuck! Grab it!
She goes to the next obstacle, Spinal Descent. She loves it! Oh no, her shoe is stuck! Grab it! She can't reach it.
A girl you think you know, but she is a liar and a thief. She stole intellectual property and I need it back. It's simple, if you want Isaac, bring me Clementine Lewis. I took the schematic Mansdale got and put the bio-drive into sleep mode, so it won't transmit anything. I'll leave it in.
"Don't be a penis," is what you should say. Scotland taught me so much. Beautiful place, beautiful people, rich in culture. My favorite pastime there was learning the Scottish accent. I messed it up, but no matter.
Howard. Let me finish; there was $5 in a card I took from Bernie's wallet. The notepad isn't in the bathroom either. I can't find it either.
Run! Get in the wagon. Hurry up! Isn't it broken? I'm fixing it now.
He wanted to make a movie. He smuggled his movie into Washington. VOICE OF ROBERT PARRISH, CUTTER I don't know how. He probably declared it as a cigar box. I don't know, but he smuggled it out.
Move in with your mother for a while." In truth, of course, he knew that the bureaucracy would catch up with him, and he would be asked if he had brought film. So he could just say, "No, I didn't." He had to create something, not a documentary representation, but a representation of reality à la John Ford. The question of whether to show the film as Ford had made it went through the entire chain of command until finally Roosevelt saw the film.
Huston's version of the film was over 40 minutes long. More than twice as long as Lowell Mellett wanted. These filmmakers wanted to create a work, but the Army wanted a short 20-minute film that could be shown before the cartoon and the main film. There was bound to be infighting, of course, between the government and directors of such caliber who were making films with their heart and soul. After Mellett's intervention, Huston decided to turn to the New York press. When newspapers reported that the government was withholding Huston's film, the Army was forced to release it in full.
He now worked closely with director Anatole Litvak on the fifth and largest film in the series Why We Fight: The Battle of Russia. While Capra and Litvak were making the film, the Red Army began to push back the Nazis at Stalingrad, in one of the most costly battles of the war. For the first time since the strong Wehrmacht began its successful blitzkriegs, subduing one European country after another, this German army faced a country that did not submit. It was intended as a training film, but The Battle of Russia was so acclaimed that Capra was allowed to release it in theaters.

"We don't need that kind of thing anymore." Not only from a practical point of view, but also from a human point of view. After three days without a sign of surrender from Japan, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. I hereby call upon the representatives of the Emperor of Japan.... SUPREME COMMANDER OF ALLIANCE ...as well as the Japanese Government and the Daihon'ei to sign the surrender declaration in the places marked. Let us pray that peace will now return to the world and that God will preserve it for all time.
There was one among them that was particularly close to me because it was shot right after the war. Most of my films are fictional, they tell fictional stories, and they didn't really involve me. But because I served in the military during the war, I made the film The Best Years of Our Lives right after the war. The film really satisfied me because it contributed something to social life at that time. Through it, people could understand veterans better.
- I've got what I need, Margo. I've been trying to lure Margo Taft away from Cohn for years. Yeah, I admit it, Pat. You did a good job. Make your movie, for God's sake. I'll pay for it.
She empties out her purse. Two dimes and a nickel. She puts the dimes back in, but the nickel she puts under a whiskey bottle. There is a box of matches on the stove. She puts the gloves in the stove and lights it.
You look good. - Thanks. I was wondering if I could use the room. I know it's a lot to ask... What do you need it for?
I did not fight for the Skaikru today. I thought I was fighting for myself, but... I know now that this is not true either. I was fighting for all of us. Skaikru will not take the bunker alone. We will share it, equally, because we are the same.
Aside from jail time, she could be registered as a sex offender for life. If she is willing to testify, her case will likely be treated more leniently. But only if she is willing to cooperate. The facts are not in dispute. She filmed the act and broadcast it live. MARINA LONINA'S LAWYER
- Work. I know. You're always working. I applied for a job yesterday. I don't know if I'm gonna get it...
Get ready for the cumshot scene. Get him all stiff for this scene. - He has to be completely stiff? - Halfway? Half, then you squeeze him.
Roger is a good man and a patriot. He is a tough dog, but well-liked. He is so loyal and wonderful. Thank God for the Breitbarts and the Daily Callers and many other alternative media outlets where we can tell the truth and spread the truth. This is not conservatism as we know it.
"Silent majority, the forgotten Americans." "I am the law and order candidate." It wasn't me who created this trend. It was the people before me. I just saw Trump's ability to use it to become president.
That's all I could find out about him. No criminal record, but you might find more than I did. Thanks a lot. Yes. I recognize this letter. Because I'm the one who wrote it.
-Yes, this morning. Sara was really panicking because Sana had probably noticed something. Luckily she was able to talk her way out of it. -I feel a little sorry for her. -Hello! She's pretty stupid if she doesn't realize that the bus is ours if we pay for it.
"Sally Sweet" is a gold mine. "Enemy" is our most expensive film. And our biggest risk. You wrote me a blank check for this. That's right, I did. And now I'm tearing it up again.
IT CONTINUES TO TURN. OH GOD, NOW I'M SURROUNDED. Rafa, did I leave the monitor? Is it there? I'll get it.
Are you a man or a woman? The first answers sounded like, "I am a man." And I use a language, culture, etc. that is supposed to be feminine. I enter this realm and claim it for myself as well.
We knew we were fast. Our hybrid system gave us advantages on the single lap. But we know: The race lasts 24 hours. We know that Audi has a lot of experience. We have that in mind. The rain always comes when you least expect it.
- No, he just died! Mike has to give up the case. You want me to break my word because your client is harassing you? It's a pro bono. He can drop it.
Mike has to give up the case. You want me to go back on my word because your client is harassing you? It's a pro bono. He can drop it. If I give you a job, you have to do it!
I know you have not felt valued at Pearson Specter, and I wanted to apologize for my part in that. I also wanted to let you know that it was never my intention for you to be fired. I hope you're not here to offer me my job again. - And what if I did? - Then I would turn it down.
She took it instead of going to court. And I'm telling you, she regretted it for the rest of her life. Oscar, no amount of money in the world is going to ease the pain. By what, then? By doing everything possible to make sure no one else has to feel it.
And I was an altar boy with different priests. One day, when we were preparing everything for Mass.... The altar boys had to come early. He entered the sacristy and... He took a revolver out of his pocket and put it on the... On the sacristy table.

COUNTY POLICE BALTIMORE I started with the Baltimore County Police in July 1997 and transferred to Homicide in February of 2000. I have been working there ever since. I've been dealing with this cold case for a couple of weeks, going over it again.
It was Cathy's handwriting. I called my father, who worked at the post office. He said, "Tell me everything that's on the postmark." BALTIMORE MD ON NOV 8, 1969 He said, "This was mailed after Cathy disappeared, not before. Stay there, don't leave, don't open it. This could be evidence.
I wanted to give them my contact information since my parents were dead. Is there anything new? Is anything being done? Do they know who did it? But also to say, I would like my letter back. I understand it's evidence and if I can't even touch it, could we...?
Is there anything new? Is something being done? Do they know who did it? But also to say, I would like my letter back. I understand it's evidence and if I can't even touch it, could we...? Could I just look at it?
Is something being done? Do they know who did it? But also to say, I would like my letter back. I understand it's evidence, and if I can't even touch it, could we...? Could I just look at it? Read it?
Does anyone know who it was? But also to say, I would like my letter back. I understand it's evidence, and if I can't even touch it, could we...? Could I just look at it? Read it? You said it couldn't be found.
Could I just look at him? Read it? You said you couldn't find him. He existed. He existed, without a doubt.
They said he could not be found. He existed. He existed, without a doubt. There is no doubt that he was handed over to the police. There is no doubt that the police have him.
I almost get teary-eyed when I see the two of you. GERRYS WIFE I just want to cry. We were talking about the ring. -I wonder. Do you have it with you?
My best friend, my sister. I carry that around with me. But they are also suffering. And there has to be a world, a place where we can live, where people want something done about it. Whoever it was that murdered her got away with it, and there was never the slightest bit of justice for her. It's been almost 50 years since Cathy's murder, but I firmly believe that it will be solved.
Is there anyone out there?" And it's still quiet. But we hear each other because we all come up through the crack. And in the process, it happens that we meet on the way to the crack. And before you know it, the power of the voice coming through the crack will rip it apart.
- Where? - No. He said a spell? Oh. Yes. You know, they never found Belle and Sause, but the parrot they had aboard the Salt Pearl used to recite this spell about the treasure. - May I hear it?
"You have a hook for a hand. How do you deal with that?" And she would have said, "Thank you for being sincere." Nobody's sincere to me. "You're welcome to shake it."
My father knows no boundaries. I don't know if he had skimmed the book. It was Tasteless Jokes, volumes one and two. I remember the first joke on the first page. It was a paragraph long, but I can tell it briefly.
All hell broke loose in the Twitter-verse. At 8:05 pm. I tweeted, "Why is my dog's poop coming out of his butt cold?" As I said, I had set the tweet. That's how good I thought it was at the time.
We love it here. But I really want to sit on Raven. Today. Magazine cover's in the bag. Susie, I told you not to wear the same nail polish as me. Sorry, I'll take it off.
Everyone who sees the beast falls down dead from fright. But no one knows more about the horse. Only his name. His name is whispered by candlelight. Those who hear it freeze in fear.
You empty a roll and think, "There's only one roll left." Flash forward, the '60s. I'm at Columbia University as an infiltrator. I'm handing out flyers for this cult I joined. I'm the only one who's ever been kicked out of a cult for taking it too seriously.
How many people died in the nuclear attack on Dubai? I've had enough of this. If you know everything so well, why did you want to meet with us? Report what you want, but leave us alone. We had foreseen the attack, but we could not prevent it.
I do not need. I read that yesterday. I have one at home. And by one, he means ten. Are you sure you don't want to watch it again?
Donna, I need to talk to you about something. About what? About the fact that I'm angry. What's going on? I gave Stephanie Patel an assignment, and she passed it on.
I just want to make sure that you don't have any conflicts with any of them. Maybe the grandmother of one of your clients goes shopping at a supermarket across the street from number 12? I'll check it out. Good, because just to clarify, if I had known there was going to be a conflict, I never would have taken the case. I appreciate you dropping it.
Maybe the grandmother of one of your clients goes shopping at a supermarket across the street from number 12? I'll take a look. Good, because just to clarify, if I had known there was going to be a conflict, I never would have taken the case. I appreciate you dropping it. I was pushed to drop it, just like I was pushed to sign this.

And everybody's freaking out, but he's like, "Cam F. Awesome. What do you expect?" People are like, "What is he doing? That's ugly." They don't understand his style, but his opponents do.
I look too good, man. The best thing for you to do is to graduate, okay? I will. I'll try. No, I'll do it.
Now there are 17 weight classes, each with at least four different champions. The value of the belts has diminished, and an undefeated record as the best evidence of dominance is more important than ever. Jab uppercut. Yes, but give me the uppercut. Give it to me.

Did the crew abandon ship? Unclear. But they didn't come without the spacesuits.... There's someone in there! Thanks to King Alfor, we found the second meteorite. We recovered it, but it's causing serious interference.
Shiro? -How... Get back! You'll never get the meteorite. I'd rather die than give it to the Alteans.
What if Voltron is trapped in the other dimension? In the other reality, Ezor. What if Voltron is trapped in the other reality? If Voltron is trapped there, we get rid of him. If he comes back with the meteorite, we take him.
Can you hear me? Are you okay? Coran, we're still alive. Allura, you did the right thing. Hira wasn't supposed to have the meteorite. -but now Lotor has it.
We are always clueless. That is why my father sent the lions away. To protect them from this reality. -At last I understand. -We'll get him back.
Not to brag, but I had a really good day with Sam. He's a good kid. - What happened to your arm? - Nothing. It was a nail in the garage. Show it to me, I'll pound it in.
God be with you and protect you. Thank you. This bird is no good. I tell you, he's no good. The priest will not accept it.
I have to make a sacrifice. Kid, do you want this bird? An unclean bird? - Huh? You want it? - Yes.
Trying. I need to boil water to make a tea. I'll get a bucket. - I can do it myself. No, you stay here, I'll get it for you.
Of course. We have to go north. - Mhm. It's not your fault we lost the war. Even though you tried to win it all by yourself.
You know, I was thinking... Not that I'm trying to tell you how to wind this up, I'm just curious. Michelle... How close do you think she got to the air filter? Do you think she touched it?
Not that I'm trying to tell you how to wind this up, I'm just curious. Michelle... How close do you think she got to the air filter? Do you think she touched it? Yeah, I'm pretty sure she touched it.
Only it was Emmett's turn. Sorry, there was no other way. Well, the point is mine. Sure, it's mine. You earned it.
How could you correct a spinal cord severed at C7 and C8? I did not correct it. He couldn't walk, I convinced him he could. Does that mean it was psychosomatic? When you suture a severed nerve, do you heal it, or does the body?
You've read them all? Yep. Come with me. All right. This area is reserved for the masters, but at my discretion, others may use it as well.
Wong. I'm breaking the laws of nature, I know. Well, why stop now? If the temple stands, they'll attack again. We must defend it.
Looks good. What is it? Looks like one of those things that makes cotton candy. It's a PKE counter. If there's a ghost around here somewhere, this baby will find it.
This is one of my favorites. I think that's a mistake. I don't think that's for us. Yes, yes, it is for you. The flying hot dog means that a ghost is holding it.
- Yes. - Yes, I saw a ghost. - You too? Yes. Could you describe him to us?
Did you put sugar in this time? I hate coffee. - Yes, sugar's in it. - Sugar's in it. I'll take it.
- And how. You know what we're going to do? We're going to catch a ghost, we're going to bring it... God. We catch a ghost, we bring it to the lab...
Nice! Yes, my mistake. It makes a medium poof. This baby I call ghost chopper. Hollow laser technology, sucks in the ghost and neutralizes it.
Ok. Okay. Now I'm going to push the wire through. Yes. Yeah, I got it, Dad.
He prayed with me, sat at my table with my wife and ate my food. I wasted my knives on the meat. I gave him this ring. Only had two of them made. You should have ripped it off that motherfucker's finger.
Light. Sorry. When I release the module, the computer shuts down. And then? I boot it up as fast as I can.
Savior One Zero, do you copy? Savior One Zero, the LZ is secure. Boss, they're not talking to me. Our bird has been captured. Shoot it down!
- Okay. I have tons of questions now. I'll tell you. A woman cut off her husband's dick yesterday. She drove off with it and threw it out the window on the way.
We record. It must always be facing forward. And you have to press the button. Okay, all right. - Did you press it?
Doesn't the fall kill you before impact? Depends on the height and where you land. There's a story... I don't know if it's true. It's about an accurate killer who eliminated over 30 targets in his short career. In his last assignment for the British, he poisoned a Venezuelan general in '88. The agent fled in a helicopter, but was shot down.
She has a database and says she'll help us find Derek. And she's hot. I trust her. Before Bieber died, he tweeted this look. He posted it on the blogspot for his summer concert tour.
What about it? It is about an enemy. He must be destroyed before he reaches us. Hold on. I had a case study in Brazil where my patient did not describe the circle as "fear." He described it as an "enemy.
- Caution. The old radar truck was supposed to go to the Smithsonian. It was not picked up. Fortunately. Drive it to the highest point.
Dad said the first time was special. You're king now. Yes, I am the king. But I should share this moment with the kingdom. Eat it!
If you are looking for a new stable, I would need support in the personnel department. I'm actually looking for a new stable. Mary, you're showing a lot of skin. Is that regulation? It's kind of sexy, isn't it? - Plug it in.
Yeah. Why would she shoot down her dealer? With her drug problem. Keep your fucking voice down. I'm not a dealer, okay? I deal with pleasure and bring it to some fucking select few.
There he joined a gang. After that, he couldn't get away from it. With the gangs you enter into a blood pact that will end bloody. After Isaac was murdered, Bianca couldn't see anything good at home. She blamed me for his death. Said I could have prevented it.
-I close the hole. -Finger away. You have to push the emergency button. We're not authorized to do that. You're not going to touch it.
Dale, the boat is leaving! My crane is falling on the derrick. -It's falling over! -Get in the boat! I'll stop him or he'll kill us all.
Stay away. Grandpa, did you take your medication? The key to the gun cabinet was in the drawer. It's gone now. Yeah, Dad's got it, OK?
Are you coming? Sorry. Wait for me. I mustn't forget the calendar. Would you get it from the salon, please, Miss Avocet?
Then there was a deer standing there. You picked up the rifle, but the deer just looked at you. He just kept grazing. He wasn't afraid. You wanted to pull the trigger. But you couldn't. You cried like a little girl. So I had to take the rifle and kill him for you.
Yes. I am not a bad person, but in certain situations I have to ask myself the question: What would a bad person do? I appreciate you keeping my name out of your statement. I didn't know why I would have mentioned it.
- North. If they come after us, we'll kill them in the mountains. The magnet. - Too heavy. - I'll take it.
- There is an underground channel. - Has it been breached? - The Tao Tei should be above it. - And the prisoner? We load him and we feed him.
Spill my blood, but don't go back to the animus. Why? The apple contains the genetic code for free will. They will destroy us with it. I will find it and watch them destroy you.
- Our insurance. In case Geran tries to kill us instead of paying. Don't forget that. Where do we get the second truck? We'll steal it.
Who wants to teach me something here? Hail to the stranger! I am the one who drinks the whisky with water. Is that right? Nick, bring the gentleman the whiskey the way he wants it.
Oh, Mr. Blackburn, um... I'm sorry. He meant that I should, um.... I'm the one who first noticed the short... the supposed shortfall. Yes, I see. I'll find it.
Of course. Stupid of me. What else? She's not your problem. Go to the trailer, hook it up and get out.
Because you out there pay attention to him all the time. "Winnetou"... The circle goes on. - Shut up. Thank you. We'll just ignore him.
You were a dancer, weren't you? Of course I was, Sherlock Holmes. Up. For pirouettes you must master your dizziness. Keep your eyes on a point. Never lose sight of it.
No. That was not the deal. All right, that's enough. You've wasted my time. The truck leaves at dawn, and I'm not going to miss it, so hand over the badge.
- What are you doing? Nothing. What's this letter? A letter from my mother. Why don't you open it?
But as deputy chief of police, I like to take a closer look at Bobo. I'm going to freshen up. Was that necessary? I didn't start the fight, Joseph. So don't blame me for the way I ended it.
(TIRESQUEAKING) (CRASHING) (LIGHT PANTING) (FIRE RATTLING) I ran a half-mile, stole a car in North Reading and traded it for a Dodge in Somerville.
Okay. Um... There's a tombstone in the backyard. It's probably just from a dog, but Lucas is scared. Could you dig it up? I want to make sure it's nothing.
Yeah, if you like it better that way, fine. It looks to me like your little group can't get along without me. No... Whatever power the mirror has, I won't let Freya use it. We'll find it and take it to the holy place.
Thank you. How did you find the store? Yelp? That's what I do. I talk to people, find new places. If I like a place, I show it to others.
Stay in my shadow. Why? - Just do as I say. Praise be to you, great God Ra. Otherwise, if a bird lands on my ship, I'll kill it before it can shit.
The bait. It's too dangerous. Are you worried about me? No, it's just I'm not as accurate with the spear anymore. Then get closer before you throw it.
I know. Father... I saw the tower. Impressive. I built it for you.
Even after her death, she tries to help us. Come, demon! Seth has the Spear of Ra. He lures Apophis to the Nile, to the source of all life. Why? To drink it.
To destroy all life. Ra is not dead. And only he can do it. But he needs his spear. So how do we get it back?
One-eyed people always fall for my bluffs. Bring her to me... Chisolm? Should I know that name? You know it from your obituary.
- Pleased to meet you, dear Count. - Citizen. Citizen deputy Malfète. There are no more titles. If you don't want the title, I'll take it.
You are rude. An appropriate question considering the task. True or false? This man has to wipe my ass. I'd wipe it so that when I'm done, there's no shit left on your ass.
What? No. It's a problem. It's a big problem. You can go up and look at it and tell me about it.
We need security. We need to record an album. You'll get it. Security, please. The shooting of "A Hard Day's Night" was fun for us. We had taken it seriously.
Mom? Yes? Why is my name Hannah? Your name is very special because it is a palindrome. You can read it from the front as well as from the back.
- It's okay. It's all right... Darling... I have tea for you. I'll leave it here.
At least I thought so. Here. I found this one. The first hat from my hand. I thought it was in the garbage for a long time.
Yes, a bad fall. You can't change the past. But I dare say you learn something from it. The first hat from my hand. I thought him in the garbage for a long time.
You cannot change the past. But I dare say you will learn something from it. The first hat from my hand. I thought him in the garbage for a long time. He kept it.
Jeremy Chalker. He's letting me stay here in exchange for hunting coyotes. There's beer in the fridge. You stole my hat. I borrowed it.
Hell, they're less cooperative than Toby's lawyer. Marcus, he's not a suspect, and you're retired. Oh, I'm listening. You like the desk? I don't hate it.
But you will not be alone in this. It will haunt me, too. If you come over, maybe I can give you inner peace. Maybe I can. - Maybe I'll give it to you.
And I too will become a Sabbath keeper. From this day forward. ♪ Song "Sweet by and by" plays ♪ "I also gave them my Sabbaths for a sign between me and them, that they might learn that I am the Lord." "So the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath." "Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and sanctified it.
Edson, why aren't you eating? Because he's full of food we shouldn't be eating. Willie, stop getting your brother in trouble. Our focus should not be on bad food. It is more important that you understand that your body is God's temple, and you should treat it as such.
And then Saint Peter went to sleep and told me to wake him up when the gate is to be opened on the Last Day. Well, come on, I'll make you a batch of cookies. Hey, Troy. Saint Peter has your name in his book. I saw him.
But your name he has. One morning Saint Peter looked into his book. He underlined names for the Last Day and let me see your name. He had it under "M." Rose's name he has too. I didn't see it like yours, but I know it's in there.
That's 365 days. I want you home tomorrow after work. Rose, I don't spend my wages. You know that. I'll take my pay and give it to you.
I'm taking this pie to church for the bake sale. Lyons was going to come over and pay you your $20. It's right here on the table. And here comes my pay. Put it on the table. I can see it.
- Go ahead. - Put down my bat. - Throw me out! What's wrong? You're so tough. Throw me out! You'll have to use it.
- Throw me out! What's wrong? You're so tough. Throw me out! You'll have to use it. To threaten me with this bat, you'll have to use it.
- I don't want to be like Troy Maxson! I just want to be myself. You are who you are, Cory. That shadow was nothing but your maturing self. You either catch up to it or adapt it to you, but you have to deal with that.
We went for walks. We took naps. We both liked to sleep. One night I was outside chasing a butterfly or a car. When I caught it and ate it....
You're doing this on purpose! You know me too well, KH! You're looking out for me. You see that car? Yeah, I see it.
You know me too well, KH! You watch my back. Do you see the car? Yeah, I see it. We're about to hit it.
- We write a song. - We are writing a song. - It's called "Boat." - "Boat." It goes like this... Let's just sing it.
Look at those waterfalls! Those fjords! Those rolling hills full of Corvoxian red cabbage. That's just what I need. But, sir, this entire area is heavily guarded by Galactic Rangers. I want that planet! We're going to take it by going on the offensive.
No, go on. We should listen to what you two have to suggest. Since we can't very well take out a planet, I had the idea why not take out the weapon that targets the planet. The deplanetizer? - Let's throw it out of its orbit. Okay.
My question to everyone standing here is: Is he loyal to you, Tasha? Because when I was going through his phone, and I'm not going to lie, I lost my cool a little bit at the contact list. Especially with the faves. The first name I came across was Colette. Me: "Who is Colette?" And, "What ringtone does she have?" I played it.
- Bree? - Yes. Who is she? What ringtone does she have? I played it.
Let go of my ankle! Leave me alone! I don't want to die like this! I don't care! Keep it!
Blueberry? Pass. Come on out, Judy. Take the suitcase. Take it to Bogo.
You'll find it in the glove compartment of your car. Mr. Wayne. Do you have it? The stone. Yes, we have it.
Nick Barrow can. Get this straight. Each of you has chosen to leave the straight and narrow. He fights as fiercely as you fight when you have a good reason. Figure it out.
Don't kill me. - Shut up. You don't know me. But I know you. You and Pope had a deal. He's dead, but he'll keep it.
She is dead. Yes. Here. Take the laptop. Have it scanned.
The wolf who holds it will prosper, and die the wolf who breaks it. Like a liana, the law twines, forward and backward, up and down. The strength of the pack is the wolf, and that of the wolf is the pack." Soon the rains stopped and the dry season set in. The heat crept through the jungle, turning it first yellow, then brown, then black.
And have worked with her. To look for Zobrist's project. When Dr. Sinskey brought you in, we saw an opportunity. It was Elizabeth who came to me. Yes. Dr. Sinskey had the Faraday pointer from Agent Bouchard. She wanted you to decode it for her.
When Dr. Sinskey brought you in, we saw an opportunity. It was Elizabeth who came to me. Yes. Dr. Sinskey had the Faraday pointer from Agent Bouchard. She asked you to decode it for her. She even secured it with your thumbprint.
During the Justinian Plague... 5,000 people died every day on the streets of Istanbul. The border between East and West, another gate. And the reason for its choice. If the pouch is intact, we can contain it. But if someone rips it open before we get there, 95 percent of the earth's population will be infected in four to seven days.
No, but the responsibility to act just when no one else is doing it. You want to do something? Fine. Then scream at the top of your lungs. Invent, go ahead! If you love humanity... If you love this planet, you'll do anything to save it.
We have both seen the same non-human spirit. If we continue with our work, you will be killed. Your visions are a gift from God. And if God shows you my death, there is a reason for it. To prevent it is perhaps your destiny.
"you didn't ask me to, "but I'll follow you to your death." A name. You did not ask for it, it is given to you. If we know the name of the demon, it gives us power over him and we can cast him out.
Sure. But we don't know his name. Maybe we do. How? Why else did he give us that clue? He must think that we know him from somewhere.
I asked you. Tell me who you are. And you told me. You told me your name. And I wrote it down.
And I wrote it down. I need my Bible. Why, what's wrong? What is... The demon's name gives us power over him.
Mr. DeCourcy arrived at the most inopportune moment. Lucy Manwaring had just crowded into Mr. Johnson's study to whine to him. Oh, has she no pride at all? Unbelievable! She made a terrible impression. She stormed out of Mr. Johnson's library, howling like a beaten child! When she saw the letter with your handwriting, she snatched it from Reginald and read it aloud!
Listen, even if we get that stick, he's never gonna let us go. We can't trust Walter, okay? The Eye has a history in Macau. They're the only ones we can trust. If we give it to them, they can clear us and get us out of here.
You get Merritt, okay? We got a lot of work to do. And put your seat belt on. Oh, no, it's not... She took it off and... We didn't...
And if not... I promise you, you will end up much worse than in a comfortable prison cell. What if the riders don't need rescuing at all? The lab consists of two levels: The safety zone and the clean room. The stick should be here in the center. So we have to get under it, pull it out and replace it with a dummy.
Thank you. Good. - There you go. Sorry. The flash drive is metal. How do we get it out?
You put your phone on a data transmitter. Once again... science is superior to magic. So, the flash drive? No. I have it.
Damn it, Dylan! Wait, let her go! Did you really think I was just gonna leave? Give me the stick! Give it to me!
What are you going to do? Shh. Teen's in a jam, I'm trying to listen to her. Where's Newt's suitcase? I think this guy Graves took it.
Yo, Amir, where you at, man? You gotta be fucking kidding me. No, no, no, listen... Just borrow your brother's car. Just borrow it.
Farewell, brothers. Join us, tribune. Jerusalem means only trouble. Trouble and the spirit he promised. We are called to receive him there.
I'll let her out, okay? Let me get the key. - Where is it? In my boot. I'll get it.
You guys have a plan, right? I don't know anything about prisoner transfer. Now you do. I want to see the transfer order. I got it!
To stop an asteroid? The last 2 asteroids hit in the same place. And it's happening again. We need to go and see what is attracting the asteroid. If we know why it's coming, we can redirect it somehow.
The last 2 asteroids hit in the same place. And it's happening again. We need to go and see what is attracting the asteroid. If we know why it's coming, we can find a way to redirect it. This plan is so stupid, I'd like to slap him.
We need to go and see what is attracting the asteroid. If we know why it's coming, we can redirect it somehow. This plan is so stupid, I'd like to slap him. Let me get this straight. Instead of running from the asteroid, we're supposed to go right at it?
That won't fix the wall! I need a bath or a massage. Who knows acupuncture? I need to let out my anger. Out! I've been holding it in too long.
It doesn't work like that. The half pipe! Manny, I have a plan! The crystal has to go down there! We're going to throw it into the volcano.
It's the best lead I've had in six months. I don't want to lose Rumlow. If he sees us, that won't be the problem. Sam, you see that... see that garbage truck? Mark it.
Hey, you want to see something cool? I found it in Dad's stuff. Kind of fitting. Roosevelt signed the Lend-Lease Act with it in 1941. That's how the Allies got supplies when they really needed them.
Stay down. Final warning. Can go on all day. The shield is not yours. You don't deserve it.
That was 20 years ago. We are here to help. And I am black. The Russians are black now. If we build the well, you can't blow it up.
- I am sorry. - No chitchat, silence instead. - I'll see you when you're released. - I'll see you when you're discharged. - Did you steal that hospital gown? No, they gave it to me because my T-shirt was missing.
Wait. I have an injured cat here. You did it with the dogs. - He's in the jacket. - What did you do to him? Nothing. I just found him over there.
- Wing Commander. - Frank. Sit down. We haven't been introduced. Okay, Frank, whatever the job is, I don't want it.
No, not on the elbow, the other! Now on your foot! The other foot! Now it's all over your butt! I got him.
- OK. - Can you get it? There you go, take your backpack. - There you go. - I got it.
There you go, take your backpack. - There you go. - I got it. - Good job, good job. - I got it, I got it.
Why you stay here and not go home and family? Are you kidding me? This... My left foot is on a mine! If I move it...
Once an outcast, I am now one of the three elected elders. From the hunted to the highest honor. I have lived for a thousand years. I may live another thousand years... or die tomorrow. But I no longer fear death... because I have already known it.
- What about this one? - Yeah, go ahead, Lewis. Now the question is, somebody builds a safe in a grocery store, right? - And we found it.
Do you know what a television is? Pictures. There's the water. There's the water. You can open it.
Proud and excited for the next section. - Cheers! - To success! Are you still waiting, or can the plate go? - Take it away.
- Cheers! - To success! Are you still waiting, or can the plate go? - Take it away. - Leave it there.
- Leave him there. No, he can go. Make him stop. You don't think he's still coming? Just leave him standing there.
- Yes. Yes, we would have to tell him that you called him. What do we do then? In the kitchen, we were seasoning a roast. I put my hand under it and turned it over.
A service like the one in Geneva? Matt was a mistake. I shouldn't have asked. -You didn't. I asked for an assignment like that, and you got it for me.
A warmer climate might help. If we decide Hawaii would be better for you, I'll go with you. Janine, how did the conversation with the White House go? I made it clear that we had a real FISA warrant. They wanted to see it, which we refused.
- Hi. - You're closing on Friday. I can't, I have an audition. Do I care? Postpone it.
No, I don't get paid for it. I have to pay for it. He's doing well. He's opening his own jazz club, which is going to be great. No, he hasn't opened it yet.
Why am I so tired? Lieutenant! Excuse me. Aren't you wearing a wedding ring? I took it off, you can lose it in the showers and treatments.
- Like a boomerang. - (Ben) Unbelievable! - (Boys laughing) - Don't even start! - Can I just say one thing? If it's "boomerang," I'll tie the anchor to your balls and throw it overboard.
And where is she going? Damn, can't we... To the Western Hotel to meet the businessman. Rentals. She was showing him off to distributors.
Very clever, Holly. Thank you. I liked it, too. I liked it, too. Why did you throw cold coffee on me? I found it in the hall.
That's where we looked. Glued in. What? It was pasted into the other film. Go get it.
Is the only explanation. - I am immortal. - Where is the film? Up there. We just have to get it.
You can choose from several company car models. We can arrange a test drive. Company car, wow. They will drive you the car whenever and wherever you want. And if you don't like it, you can always exchange it.
Jordy, what's up? DNA test is ready. Hurry up! I don't want to miss kickoff. - You'll miss it today.
I beg your pardon? Not "he," she. Yes, of course. Thank you for a fascinating case. I'll telegraph when I've solved it.
He thinks he's being dragged to hell by the body of Mrs. Ricoletti. That's nonsense, isn't it? You bet it is! Did you bring your revolver? - What good is it against a ghost? - That's what I mean. Did you bring it?
This is where you and I will end up. Always here. Always together. You have a great mind, Moriarty. I admire it.
- I don't know, idiot. Pull yourself together and follow me. Come on! Move your ass! Kick it!
Sarman, the food. What's going on? He asked again if he could go to Mohenjo Daro. He is angry because I said no. His anger is like a dewdrop, the wind soon blew it away.
Is that really possible? We have confirmation, Master Shredder. The container with the purple slime is in the police headquarters. Take a team. Get it back, no matter what the cost.
Let's talk about the future. How we want to change it. You mean preventing the Jacobite uprising? We agreed on that, didn't we? We agreed to discuss it. If it comes to a war against the English, we should find ways to win it rather than prevent it.
What are your references? Remind me again. Who are you? Look, uh... when we walked into that courtroom on day one, he was wrapped in the cloak of presumption of innocence. He's still wearing it, and will continue to until he testifies, then he takes it off.
Remind me again. Who are you? Look, uh... when we walked into this courtroom on day one, he was wrapped in the cloak of presumption of innocence. He's still wearing that, and will continue to until he testifies, then he takes it off. He forfeits it the minute he goes up there.
I have never been there. Now I know. I remember what it was like! I abandoned you, and you wrote all the text. You wrote it, and I never thanked you, and why?
I left you, and you wrote all the text. You wrote it and I never thanked you, and why? It doesn't matter to anyone who writes what. It only matters who performs it. Actually, only one person in the whole universe cares about being mentioned who wrote it, and that is you!
Feeling confident? Come on, let them do their thing and we'll have a drink in the crew lounge. You sure? I could use a drink. We'll have it written on Fred's lid.
- Who said you could speak? - I did. Just don't let up. That won't help either. If you disable the power supply to the magnetic seal, the safe's fuse will kick in and leave it closed.
- On the roof. I was up there watching the sunrise and I heard something through the window. I'm a curious monkey. Todd, I planned this proposal before I met you. So I'm going to do it.
- Ok. He's not gonna bite me, is he? - You can do it, man. - No. - Come on, Rog, get him.
- Come on, Rog, grab it. Yeah, come on, pull back hard. You've got to have a little flair. Come on. Get him out.
And I hope I never see you again after this vacation. Okay, you seem upset. Because you sabotaged my proposal and then stole it. I didn't steal your proposal. You gave it to me.
Quite well, I think. I'm just polishing my speech. To make sure I say everything I want. Oh yeah, I know it's going to be fine. I meant, how are you doing with the whole Todd thing? How do you think? It's clear he stole your proposal or maybe you let him have it?
Me? You're pouting? The hat is stolen. Don't be silly. I just didn't give it back.
- Your hat? - Yes, my hat. - A man's hat. - That's right. - Did a man give it to you?
Le Chasseur francais. And the period of the ad? My whole life. This hat makes you crazy! But without him I am nothing, I create nothing.
- Your wife sent me. - That's good. At the risk of sounding crazy, your hat changed my life. If you hadn't lost it, I never would have met the man of my dreams. Your ad... I found the hat. Only I don't have it anymore.
Even if you think I'm crazy, your hat changed my life. If you hadn't lost it, I never would have met the man of my dreams. Your ad... I found the hat. Only I don't have it anymore. Now a homeless man has it.
Thank you. Thank you. I found my hat. I found my hat. I found it, found it...
I have the memory back. I have the memory back. This place is actually closed off. The smell. You love it too?
Can you look where that hat is? She'll be back. Thank you. Mr. Aslan, thank you. Yes, take it.
He said monsieur. Yes, that's right. He said monsieur. I got him! I got him!
Yes. So I'm guessing right, this is not your hat? I think you know whose it is. If you don't mind, I'll keep the hat. I'll return it myself.
This little clause has cost us around 5 million Danish kroner per quarter. We have now corrected it. This will save us 20 million kroner every year. -Oh, so that was... -The passage was not from us. -That's why we deleted it.
We have rules about that. In Denmark, people are not treated like that. -We follow him home. -I have an appointment in a few minutes... Cancel it.
- It's okay, I'll be right there. - Go ahead, it's okay. - I loved the ball. - Okay. - I didn't want you to catch it.
Give it back or I'll have to call the police. Get out of my way, old man! Let's not escalate, okay? I'm offering you a way out. Now, give me the bolt or I'll have to take it from you.
I'm offering you a way out. So hand over the latch or I'll have to take it from you. Touch me and I'll scream rape, you cocksucker. Now let me pass. Give it back.
- Not a good idea, chief. Joe, we love this place as much as you do. I've been coming here since I was a kid. But it's just a store. You can replace it.
Okay, let's do it! I want access to every surveillance camera in the city. We're gonna track down that fucking emergency van. He's got to be out there somewhere. Find it.
The first of your George Washington over 200 years ago. The man was kind of into escape tunnels, to all the buildings. There are them all over the city. The tunnel under the original church was closed in the '50s. But we opened it up.
Yes. These figures and his artwork speak very much of craziness. Excuse me, do you happen to have this letter from your uncle? You just mentioned it. The lawyer gave it to me with the deed.
These figures and his artwork speak very much of craziness. Excuse me, do you happen to have this letter from your uncle? You just mentioned it. The lawyer gave it to me with the deed. - May I see it for a moment?
But only in dreams. She says her body is somewhere on the estate, and we just haven't looked in the deep cellars yet. You said these are dreams? - She was talking about a demon. I saw him in a nightmare. Rose called him 'veiled demon'.
Are you serious? I knew they were fucking with me. You really got that shit? - You really got that shit? - Yeah, I just took it.
Now... come back. The '94 is the best, I think. It tastes like a mixture of scorched earth, plums and incense. Well, you obviously like scotch. I'd drink nail polish remover too if someone put it in front of me.
And I will give away 1,000 cards. To the... To the soldiers. Because we need to support our boys. Well, uh... I admire your courage. And, uh... no one would rather see you triumph here than me, of course, but... the room is so incredibly large. This... this... that's almost 1,000, ah, 3,000 seats. Well, Lilly Pon's voice filled it, and she's just a birdie.
- This is December. - December? Yes, for the calendar. I didn't tell you about the calendar? Look at it.
- That's amazing. - Thank you. You can really make money with this. Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not selling it.
Three weeks to go, baby. That's all. 21 days. And what are you going to do with me then? I'm gonna dig in your cleavage with this mustache right here. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna bury it in there.
- Even better. - Doesn't all this impress you? - I've always been proud of you. This place was a cockroach trap when Mama Mabel died. Look at it now.
Country boy. You know that fluffy wind you could stuff in your pillow right before a heavy thunderstorm? Harlem's like that, too. Trouble has a certain smell. You can smell it... ...with your hands.
If you played, who won? Me. I'll hold on to the truth even if Pop is dead. - What's going to happen to this saloon? - The bank will take it over in the end.
"You clean the windows, brother." It wasn't a question. We have to keep the parlor open. I know. You want to run it?
Bring me back Daddy's ring. You know what he was like before he couldn't take it anymore? Eddie's a damn fine guy. All I got left of him was this ring. The only reason he didn't pawn it was because I took it away.
You better focus on that. Make sure you're Geoffrey Canada, there's money in that. Forget the money, Cornell. And the club. Sell it.
We have to treat you. Drink this. Otherwise you'll dehydrate. You were still looking for the shooter. Did you recognize him?
You're welcome. Hello. Come on. She's off the case. She transferred it to me and doesn't want anyone from the company wasting time on it, so I'm looking for outside help.
I don't think so. Why do you ask? Maybe it was an overdose. The autopsy report still hasn't come in. You should have received it by now. When did you send it?
You should have received it by now. When did you send it? I don't remember. When you asked me to. Did you send it home or to the office?
When the verdict was announced, I even feared an acquittal. But honestly, you should be satisfied. Remember, you had to persevere for 13 years to get this far. Today is a victory. Promise me you'll enjoy it.
Worrying and unpleasant and terrible. And what can we do now? Everything humanly possible. I will write a report to the Cardinal. And he will transmit it to the Holy Father at the next opportunity.
Where is he? Do we have a visual? Negative, he's gone. Damn it, Bishop! I had him in my sights.
We have destroyed the atmosphere. We alone are to blame. And he asteroid? I was at the crater. Saw it with my own eyes.
Me too. Why did you come back and risk all this? I was a slave. I dreamed of walking across the ice as a free man. No matter how many tried to drive that dream out of me, I hid it deep in my heart.
The only thing I want confirmed right now is whether Christine knew Collins was going to shoot Otis. Your friend Jeff shot and killed Teddy White - and he shot your husband in the head. - I don't believe you. They're just trying to pin the robbery on him because they can't solve it!
Please. God, I hate these guys already. Hate it. Hate this shit! Hate it!
That doesn't fit. - Ray? - What? A letter from San Bernardino. Read it to me.
May I? Irresistible. Well? We'll test it. If it's a hit... Offer it everywhere.
Until our children arrive. May they have your talent. And your dirty thoughts. A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
Together they are equal to all the others. We can start small and build up. The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for him, from the white port to Ramsay's own door.
I have sworn to protect you, my lady. You heard her. We need more men. And my uncle has an army. We can send the Blackfish a raven. We can't risk ramsay intercepting it.
I then joined them and never regretted it. - You guys are really good. - My last monologue sucks. In my defense, though, I have to say the text is bad. So change it.
Now, watch. You put your left hand on the lady's neck. Your right hand holds the narrow one from the lady's backside, like this. Very romantic. Take your middle finger, yes, and push it right into her bunghole.
The way he looks at her. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I would prefer to work with the little brother over that. Come on, you're the one with the magic dick. You must have shown it to her by now.
It is not you who have failed me, but the world. I need you by my side. - But not on the throne? - Not until my work is done. If you won't give me the throne, I'll have to take it.
We have done it. Your time on this earth is over, Druid! Okay, where's the seed? I was going to tell you earlier. Have you lost it?
It is me, Wil. I am the seed. What do you mean? I have to become the Ellcrys. It's the only way to save him.
Yes, blue is ok too. Yeah, I mean, either or.... As long as you're standing on it, everything looks good. I was thinking about the blue rug. Maybe we'll buy it for our apartment?
It's not so much about God as it is about community. But I want to apologize, okay? Here's my way of apologizing to you. The late service is great. You're going to love it.
I pay more than it costs plus extra tip. No. Go home, get your money, and buy your coffee. I need that coffee, damn it. Please, dude. I need it to get me going.
And let go! - Yes! - Perfect shot. Perfect shot! Not bad. So how do we get to the fish so we can actually eat it?
That was 11 years ago, and it was my sister. She fell in love with a fool and betrayed our father! She was an ungrateful coward! And who is the coward now? I got him!
She fell in love with a fool and betrayed our father! She was an ungrateful coward! And who is the coward now? I got him! I got him!
This is my father's fortress. Yes. The last piece of armor. It's here? Follow the setting sun, and you will find it, in the place that could have once been your home.
Get off! I slept on something. The sword Uncomfortable. The helmet. I know where it is. I saw him in a dream, Beetle.
- But? - The port thing is not important. Of course it is. The port is Marseille's most important asset. If we don't develop it, we're finished.
- This is Julieta. - Excuse me. And this miracle is Antía. Do you have a suitcase? - Yes, a brown one. With my name on it. - Can you get it?
We could fib and spread the word that she's at Gotham General, but what happens when Fries attacks? It's full of people who are too sick to take away. This is the most rational way. Sometimes the rational way is not the best way. If there was a better way, we would take it.
What are you going to do about it? I wish I knew. I wish I knew. My health forbids me to drink, but at least I can see you enjoying this sherry. It was my father's favorite.
I have no one else to turn to. You know, Harvey... it's very rude to wear a hat inside. You like the fabric? It's Italian. I love it.
Have you seen my jacket? It's freezing outside. Sorry. I fixed the sleeve. You tore it.
I was there. Remember? When you were assigned the Wayne case. I know what it means to you. You think if you can solve it, you can close the door on the past.
I was in Blackgate for murder. But that was self-defense. Well, people are afraid of strange things. The jury convicted me. One day these men showed up, told me they'd fix my arm. Not just fix it, make it better.
Bring everything possible to the remote facility. Then destroy all evidence from Indian Hill. - By destroy, you mean... - You have an explosive device. Use it.
And he won't see Lucius and me as a threat. I call Bullock and he storms in with a hundred cops, Take you away. Bring everything you can to the Upstate facility. You have an explosive device. Use it.
Nothing... is impossible. Holy... No. This town is in big trouble if we don't find that bus. - So we find it.
"We have means to get you to sign." We're so close, I can smell it. This is yesterday's German pussy. And I hate that mustache. I'm trimming it to a Hitler brush.
I did not order them. I found them. Am I the only one here who doesn't do something? Scrap that paste! To the cave with him! Where a demon with a thousand peckers will shrink him forever!
His credentials aren't that special. Lucky for you, old Jorge needed a sous-chef so bad, he didn't even check you out. You faked those, Pine? I needed the job. I needed it fast. I didn't have time for formalities.
We have one, two, three cups. We put a cup like this, one like this, one like this, and one like this.... Do you understand? Now I'm going to take the ball and put it in the cup. Shake the cup and turn it over.
Oh dear. Take a look. It seems your daughter has found your vibrator. Stella. She finds it all the time.
I served God, protected my flock... but I doubted. Then I came to your house... and I saw that the devil exists. And I doubted no more. My path was clear. I think it was not by chance that you set me on the path, and now here you are, treading it yourself, facing it again.
- Was it? - I checked the code. It had been changed. ... Clumsy fingerprinting by a QA technician. When you find cancer in an organization, you have to cut it out before it can spread.
I'd love to. My husband will kill me if I lose another purse. I see. No ladies in the room after 7pm and this is the common room. You may use it whenever you wish.
Very simple, Kim. Did you know about the commercial or not? I... Yes. - He showed it to me...
I feel like... Like Carnac. Remember how Johnny Carson used to imitate Carnac? He'd give the answers before the questions. You know, Ed used to give him the envelope. And Johnny would hold it up to his forehead and give the answer like you'd have to be an adult.
I recognize his handwriting by now. Everything else is encrypted. The seal was already removed at least three times before I did it myself. We're not the only ones interested in the Stuart correspondence. Can you decipher it?
Oh yes! Into every man who passes by. Shut your sassy mouth! It's incredible. What did you do? There's a nerve running there, and when you hit it, it numbs the sensation in the lower extremity.
Good. This is normal. I brought you some herbs, they will help. You have to boil them in hot water. When the infusion is cool, you can apply it with a cloth.
You're acting like an idiot. Is that what you want? That was a rhetorical question. Take off the other boot. Take it off.
I bet you Lallybroch idiots turn your asses and run as soon as the first cannon is fired. - You take that back, you son of a bitch! - What do you think you're doing? Come here, I'm gonna slice you from belly to bone. Put the dagger down, or I'll ram it up your ass until you taste it.
There are still things to do. Like the terrace in the back. Seventy-six, I'm probably not going to finish it. Okay. Yeah, I'll give you the brownstone. You don't have to sell it if you don't want to.
I was there. And how? I wanted to give him some leeway. It was hardly worth it. I thought he didn't want to use it.
And how? I wanted to give him some leeway. It was hardly worth it. I didn't think he'd want to use it. Should we give him back?
It was hardly worth it. I thought he didn't want to use it. Should we give it back? No. Then someone else will take it.
You will get the money. Don't worry. (door opens) Hey, analysis on our shooter's heroin. Jamarr was an amateur. The stuff's been cut with synthetic opiates. Makes it super-potent, kind of a fast track to overdose.
Come here. I heard that it feels like a permanent orgasm. - It's gonna hurt like hell. - Perfect. - I'm gonna write a song about it. - Pull it out, I want to see it.
Or rather a kaleidoscope of human suffering? It is not a picture. It's a feeling. Like the haze on your face on a cold morning. You can't see it, but you can feel it...the dampness. I can feel the moisture...when you're standing so close to me, Johnny Boy.
I am the queen of every hive. I am the fire on every hill. I am the protective roof over every head. I am the spear of battle. I am both the tree and the lightning that strikes it.
But he does not listen. Get your seat! That's what I'm going to do. - You need the seat. - No one touches it. - No.
Listen to me carefully, Mr. Pine. Your nephew is my friend. But I don't deal with dicks any more than you do. He does. But that's his business. You don't have to belabor it. If you do that again in my presence, I'll take the stick, stick it up your ass and break it clean off.
There we were in the tunnels all the time. - We were underground. - Right. The 12 Monkeys may be able to predict the future, but they can't find us that way. They must have put a tracking device on me. We need to find someone who can find it and cut it out, some kind of back-alley surgeon.
Shit. And there we have it. Subdermal tracking device. That's how they found you, my old friend. You gotta get it out of me, Ben.
- Like black bookends. Makes a good impression, they said. You're invited, too. I was looking for an excuse to get a new Sunday hat. There you have it.
-Crap? He's on the board, Archer. One word from him, and A.J.'s in. -Yeah, but... -Yeah, but shut up! -Yeah, but shut up! This is your daughter's future, you idiot! So you take this case and you solve it, and A.J. goes to school here and becomes a heavyweight in business or an astronaut or some shit!
Thomas Edison. He killed an elephant by shoving an electrical cord up its ass. -What? -Yeah. The nice magician from Menlo Park bought an old circus elephant to murder it.
You smell sick. I saw it. They took one. Why does opening it mean the end of the world? The pathogen would be aerogenic, you catch it when you breathe.
And what is this... I've never seen those on her before. The... the date on it has no meaning. It's not a birthday, it's not the anniversary of my father's death or Melissa's. And what's with this quarter, why is she wearing it as a necklace?
I want my dog. I didn't want to be here without my dog. Sir, go to your room. The dogs are at the shelter. You can find him there.
I'll do that. - Thank you. I cut myself on the paper. There is a letter. - Read it aloud. "Dear Susan, I have written a novel that will be published soon.
Go home, I'll advance you your share. Someone will bring it to you. - When? Tomorrow, the day after. Don't worry, you'll get it.
- Yes, thank you again. These are the people responsible. These are the motherfuckers who killed your son. So what now? Tomorrow we get a warrant and serve it.
He's as much in the dark as I am. A friend of mine trains at headquarters. He says Irving's there every noon. He's working the bag. Beats the hell out of him.
- We now assess the case differently. The surviving policewoman is cooperating. She made a statement. She did? She says Nash planned your husband's murder and the team carried it out.
Let's look at the calendar. May and June are the first to be booked. Excuse me, Mrs. Allen, but why our church? You don't look Armenian and your name.... My late husband changed it for business reasons:
- So you let it go. I had no choice. - Fuck "no choice." And his real name? The assholes didn't give it to me.
I need to be there for Maggie. - I said no. - Carl. You've been wrong before. This place isn't too big to protect. I just need you to stay here and help protect him.
Just go. I'm not leaving you behind. I said go. Please, just go. If you care about anyone, there's a price, Morgan, and you're gonna have to pay it.
Give me your shit or I'll kill you. Today was open house. We've invested a lot in making sure you know who I am and what I can do. You work for me now. You got shit, you give it to me.
Something like that. They won't find you. It'll be over if you just hand over the chalice. Never. After all these years, you still want it?
They mean nothing to me. Kill them both for my sake. My people want the Cup. Why do you think I've been here all these years? If I find the chalice, I'll keep it.
Clary, come on. I don't see the cup! We looked. It's not in the apartment. You didn't find it, but it could be there.
- ¿Qué te pasa? - I meant no disrespect. - A real Pierre Cardin? - Yes, it's a real Pierre Cardin. Got it from Gimbels. How much?
How long do we have to wait before you supplant that Misty Holloway at number two? Oh, the new song? It's great, tío. It's great. Why don't you perform it tonight at my benefit?
- Frances, wait. - What? - You have to take the dog. - What? The dog. I can't keep him in the apartment anymore because of Cole's allergies.
- What? I didn't buy the dog. That was Diane's birthday present. Don't you remember? She asked me to take him.
They were already starting to get unruly. My friend and I were just admiring her tattoo. We would love to know the story behind it. I like your hat. Maybe I'll keep it.
You've never seen a greyhound, have you, Bill? Seen a few showdowns in my day. A greyhound is a racing dog. Spends his life in circles, chasing a bit of felt that looks like a rabbit. One day we took him to the park.
What the heck? There's a common misconception that hosts don't log their sexual encounters when they're underground for reprocessing, but ... like I said, a misconception. Oh, shit. I need something. QA sent a body down here. The lumberjack from sector 14. I want to see him.
You think you're on this journey because you're some kind of rival, a ... a threat to me. I chose you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone. My sister probably chose you for the same reason. I earned my place. No one gave it to me.
We abandoned that system decades ago. Yes, there are still transmitters out in the park, and it looks like one has been turned on. - Where? - An abandoned theater in Sector 3. I'll look for the transmitter and find out who else used it.
Logan's sister. - Yes. And when I get home, we're getting married. Oh. The place you're looking for... I will help you find it.
It's the people that confuse me. This building is not in any survey of the park. That's because we use hosts to do most of the surveys. They are programmed to ignore this place. They literally could not see it if they were staring directly at it.
- You promised! - I didn't promise you anything. Mom said you'd get in trouble. Shut up and get the ball. You got it?
I pay more than it costs plus extra tip. No. Go home, get your money, and buy your coffee. I need that coffee, damn it. Please, dude. I need it to get me going.
Shit. What? Your bandage is bleeding through. Are you okay? I'll change it.
Right right. Junkyard dog... Oh, someone who gets angry in court. Oh, well, I'm afraid I don't appear in court. I'm preparing the case, not presenting it.
-Mistake number one. -You know him? -The job's a bust, no loot. -Something happens. Tell Eddie, he wants me to pay him off.
What if I get a funny tail? Kent is a "Niehart." - What's that? He never gets really hard. I fold his penis up like a balloon animal and put it in my vagina.
Lloyd said you wanted $4,000. Is that right, Mac? - Honey, please. Could you... - All right. Take this check. Cash it. Then we'll never have to deal with you two again.
We're in Sioux Falls, and George McGovern is now entering his campaign headquarters. Songbook His wife Eleanor McGovern is with him. Thank you. Here, among friends in South Dakota, where this campaign began nearly 22 months ago...we will end it tonight.
What does that fucking shit have to do with me? I don't know. We barely have enough for a week. We need to talk to the Marcellos about supplies. Take your little barge down and pick it up.
- Why are you away from her? We have the studio until tomorrow morning. Why don't you teach us your song? What Richie said, our music would be the mirror of our lives or something.... Leave your song to me. I'll rearrange it, make it my own.
I think you might like this. "Coffee?" Yeah, it's a political statement about skin color. The thing about coffee is, it's always coffee. If you drink it black, it's coffee.
You're up next. Jackson and I will cheer you on. No, you're not. I'm not going out there, mom. I need my super magic scarf, but Aunt Stephanie took it.
- Ready? - Bye, honey. Uncle Jesse, do me a favor. Tommy wants a double cheeseburger. But put it in the blender first.
Again! And you insult me? You insult my family? I've invested half my life savings in this station. I believe in it.
Stand up. I need the key to locker number 143. Turning the handle inside out sets off the alarm. For a pittance, you'd risk your life to protect someone else's fortune? Turn it to the right.
- What do you want me to do? - You're gonna fix me. Come on. Tell me, who were you trying to steal the pin from? Why did you want it so badly?
Medium sized company, has a large distribution contract with Yumtime bakery company. They hold the 50%. The fundamentals are solid. I don't see a short. I don't want you to see it.
Until... and you were there, Chad... Your grandfather asked me to size up a putt on the third hole. It was a left-to-right putt and that's what I told him. I watched that shot all summer. He turned the club in, followed through and missed it by a foot.
No, you won't. You need that $9 million. Because not one of you... not one... worked a single day since the moment your sorry ass grandfather fell face down on the sands of Palm Beach. And after surveying your holdings, your business interests, your debts, I know that this check is the only thing standing between your family and bankruptcy. So pick it up, put it in your pocket, and get out of here.
That's not OK to store an arm there. -Did you find the report from 2008? -Do you need it? -Hjörtur is no longer under suspicion. -I want to see it.
One is 19, the other 13. Of course, they have already been raped. On your ship, wasn't it? Did you yourself rape her, perhaps? You were looking for a snowman the other day. And you found him.
It was never going to get out. Someone had to do it. -Everything in the report is true, right? -Yeah. Put it back in its place.
The cluster burns. We are losing it. - Move aside. - Liquid nitrogen? Phone companies use it to cool phone lines all over town.
- This is a spoofed call. - So is Warren's voice. Someone used recordings of his calls to Max to mimic his way of speaking. What did this poor guy do to deserve a fake suicide? Max found a secret code hidden in the radio signals and asked Warren to help him decipher it.
You know what? You're right. But he can. - Good thing you brought the mop. - I'm never on the road without it, boss.
- I think, Harold, it's time for another conversation. Our cat-and-mouse game seems to be coming to an end. I don't think of it as a game, and it's not over yet. It's not? You uploaded the virus, but you didn't activate it.
It's okay. Turn it off. Alan. They'll hear you. If you had a bad dream, write it on a piece of paper and put it in the box.
Your balls are going to explode, my friend! At least jerk off. I can lend you some magazines. You gotta take the bull by the horns! But you're not strong enough to ride him.
Please. What's up, crazy? It looks funny here. I have a mobile router. Plug it into your laptop. Boom, connected and all paid for.
Here it looks funny. I have a mobile router. Clip it to your laptop. Boom, connected and all paid for. - My God. - Should I install it?
Yes. What was it like there? The sun was shining. You have to get my ring. I hid it upstairs when he brought me here.
The sun was shining. You have to get my ring. I hid it upstairs when he brought me here. It's in the bathroom. You must get it for me.
You have no idea who Don Knotts is. He was this strange little man. And in the movie, he turns into a fish. It was half a cartoon. Probably miserable, but he loved it, so I loved it.
I didn't see how much pain it caused Scott to have to watch all the time. Not feeling the rush of bravery, the feeling of being part of something bigger than yourself. I told Homer we needed to figure out, first and foremost, what it was that he was taking from us. But a plan is one thing. It's another to then put it into action.
Saturn's rings. They sing. That's where you were. Khatun won't give us the fifth set. She doesn't want him to have it.
They sing. That's where you were. Khatun won't give us the fifth set. She doesn't want him to have it. We'll get it.
- Is that because it generates heat? - French gave it to me. My last one. - That's okay. - We can share it if you like.
I felt like shit. I wanted to hurt someone. I messed up. I'm driving around with the check. I don't want to cash it.
Oh, yes, the knack. What is it? How do you get it? It's not a thing. It's just... You just get it.
I suspect the bird was a huia. It is said to be extinct. That's pretty rare. Boy, a lot of people would be interested... to see something like that. And those who discovered it would become famous.
When I was little... Well, when I was a kid, we lived next door to a farmer. Do you remember? Next to Grandpa Leon was a farm. There was a tractor on the farm. I dreamed of driving it.
This is an emergency protocol used by the provisional authorities in Seattle. They defeated a riot with minimal casualties, which pleased our hosts. Where did you get this? The governor general there was a friend of mine. Your boss needs to take this plan to Helena... and convince her that he's the man to implement it.
The virus appeared earlier? Correct. And much worse than we know it? That's right. But there are other changes as well, at least from my perspective. Spearhead, for example, in my reality, we attacked, confiscated their core, and used it to continue our mission.
What could she have done? I don't know. Weren't you here last week? The movie's the same. Do you really want to see it again?
I had prepared a whole speech. It was not planned to ask you to marry me with my hands in the sofa because I lost the ring. I can't find the ring. That's why... That's why. Let's look for it.
How are we going to do this? It's time to use my connections. I wake up, search my pockets, and it's gone. The ring has simply disappeared. I can't find it anywhere.
He can recognize talent. How about this? An improved motion detector that can measure to within 15 meters. If someone tries to sneak up on us, we'll know. Can you operate it?
Can you operate it? I think so. What are you doing here? I came to return your memory inhibitor. Thank you for letting me borrow it.
And I can't stress it enough, don't let them touch you. Fine. No touching. Dr. Wilkes designed this device to allow for quick removal. You press the vacuum button on the side and release it once the needles have touched the skin.
Dottie is my responsibility. I wouldn't leave her or anyone else with someone like Whitney Frost. Don't leave her behind. The kill switch on the necklace is linked to another circuit. Activate it and be done with her.
People have a psychological habit of always looking for the supervillain, but in my experience, reality is far more complicated than that. - So who is Geronimo? - That's a very good question. You've never let me see behind that curtain before...why now? Well, you were sort of forced to take this job, but there are very legitimate reasons that you should do it well.
What's wrong with him? Why didn't he tell us? The remote detonator has a radio frequency, right? - Yes, it does. - So you can jam it.
- Have a nice day. What was the name of the movie with Ronald Reagan and the monkey? Bedtime for Bonzo. That movie was terrible. I never saw it.
- Yeah, that one. I don't watch that crap. - What? Have you seen it today?
Well, I wouldn't say that. I threatened to shoot you. Yes. I remember. It's not entirely your fault. Vernon Masters saw your boundless ambition and exploited it.
What's wrong? - The radio control is not responding. - Can you fix it? - I'm working on it. - The rupture's becoming unstable. We need to close it before we lose control.
- You are not my superior. As a supervisor, I feel obligated to tell you - that your actions were ill-advised and reckless. - Reckless? You're damn right. By your own stated rules, you should have allowed me to get sucked into the rift and shut it down. Period.
You've got to be kidding me. Good luck with that shit. What the hell do you want? Hello, my dear. I'll make sure you don't destroy the park before I get it back.
Yeah, because that's a pump for volleyballs, footballs and stuff. Why don't you use my air compressor? Because I can't drive the car with a flat tire. No, Ricky, it's portable. You could have just brought it here and...
- No, Mr. Lahey. What the hell is going on here, Barb? What do you want? I want justice, Jim. The park was stolen from us, and I want it back, and so should you!
I want justice, Jim. The park was stolen from us, and I want it back, and so should you! But I don't want it back. You understand? If you want it, then go get it and keep my share.
The baroness was infertile. - No experiments. A cure. She was pregnant at her wedding. Before they burned her, the villagers cut out the fetus... and threw it into the spring.
Here is your origin. I don't want this. You know, you look just like her on her wedding night. The night she was taken from me. The villagers cut out the fetus... and threw it in the spring.
Then we find ourselves at an impasse. Does it hurt? He is ready. It takes away the pain. It does not cause it.
Today we have gathered, which is why we have done it countless times before, to see a man die. Wanheda... Vengeance is yours. No. I don't know if your death would bring me peace. I only know that I do not deserve it.
But this "true magic" is still completely fake. True. They don't really do magic. It's not like they're magicians or anything. You should perform a magic trick better than anyone else and make it your own.
Today, you throw everything away as soon as there is a problem. If the passion fades, you throw away the relationship. But nobody's perfect. I spoke to Antoine on the phone. I sent him Boris' budget and he thinks it's very reasonable.
Don't sleep with her. Oh, man. It's absolutely fabulous out here, Zack. How can you afford this place? My dad left it to me.
- Let Porthos go. I'm not running away from any fight. You won't change things that way, Christophe. You both know the enemy doesn't give you victory. You have to take it.
-Show her your dick. -No. -Show it. Don't think about it. Come on, show it.
That is not gay. This is torture. -No. -It's different. Ripping out my nails or keeping me awake for 12 weeks, that's torture. But greasing up a dildo and pretending it's your dick and sticking it in me, that's homosexual.
As I said, I think there's only one way in and there's no way to break through that door without waking the others. We don't have to. They'll open it for us, just let us walk in. You want Gregory's head, don't you? We'll give it to them.
Using your mind and this self-build ammunition thing, that's part of your skill set. Just like eliminating undead and living enemies is one of mine. If you really want to survive longer in this world, I'd suggest you learn that as soon as possible. Okay. Thanks for your protection. I definitely needed it between Houston and here.
Where is the other car? We parked two cars to it yesterday. One of them is missing, the one we put between the houses. You can hardly see between the houses from up there, - especially at night. - The note, can I see it?
The town is about a mile away, a beautiful walk.... and if you need anything, I'm upstairs in my house. Okay. Thank you, Norma. How do you know my name? I saw it on the business card.
I regret it so much. It hurts me so much. It's okay. This rabbit is from her childhood. Maybe you can give it to her.
I'm just tired. You know, Nate... Maybe you're going about this the wrong way. The demos, the speeches, the politics... They're not going to bring change. The unknown soldiers will bring it, the unled resistance.
We've had problems here in London. Murders. - And you're involved. - And your proof? I'll find it.
Murders. - And you have to do with it. - And your proof? I'll find it. I always find it.
The god's words caused ripples on the water and they broke at the ferryman's feet. "Now tell me your name," said Thor. And the ferryman, he stood up, and he shouted, "My name is Harbard! It is seldom that I conceal it."
And I'm sorry about that, Jemma, because.... maybe there was another way... Will died saving me. What you killed was a thing, a monster. You've been nothing less than extraordinary all this time. So, um... this... Trench, as you call it.
We need to increase the population in the City of Light. The more minds engaged in the task, the more powerful A.L.I.E. becomes and the closer we get to finding the second A.I. There is one problem, when Abby put us on hold, - Pike confiscated our chip maker. - Then we have to get it back. - How?
Do you have something to say? What do you want to know? Everything. On the ark, you taught your students about the promise of our future, about the responsibility our descendants would have when they finally set foot on earth. We did not start this war, but you can be sure that I intend to end it.
You rule without the wisdom of the commander's mind. Your people will soon find out. I can offer you something far more powerful than the flame.... The true legacy of Becca Pramheda, all power, all wisdom in one simple key. All you have to do is swallow it.
I don't know what you're talking about.... No. Good. Now take out the clip. Throw it in the aisle.
I thought I had him. Being crammed into a jet isn't really good for blood circulation. - Where's the homing device? - Oh, wait. I got him.
- What did Manny say? - I'll take your shift, bro. - What about the car? - The Fusion. I can reset the speedometer and park it out front.
Thank you. Have fun. I'm David Grimes from the Cleveland Plain Dealer. - Where's your ID? - I stupidly have it in my car.
We have enough work tracking Malick. How did the S.H.I.E.L.D. review go? Fine, I think. Guess we won't know for sure until Coulson gets the evaluation report. - Got it.
Uh, it's a liquid, so.... - We could freeze it. - How? - Liquid nitrogen. There's a, um... We use it in the gas cooling of the containment module.
Is that a technical term? Do you know a better word? Grace, I'm gonna be honest with you. Nobody wants your case. And I have it because I'm at the bottom of the senior partner list.
- And who are you now? Daisy Johnson, ATCU. Um, Edwin, right? How did you know my name, Edwin? When you called 911. - Because I just heard it.
- Yes, all of them. - Daisy. - May, if I don't get to go on the mission myself, I'll damn sure do what I can from here. Not all of them! Do you understand? You and I have developed a similar algorithm to find Dr. Garner and some servers are running it.
I sentence you to death. Do you understand? Stop it. Look... This is the dagger. I'll put it here.
The other, the other man... We can't let him! Steel yourself for the work ahead, Henry. If you can't stand the nightmare, you shouldn't go to sleep. I can bear it.
Already my life long! Good, because I can probably help. With what? With the relapse. I can extend the duration of the change, maybe make it permanent.
"This girl has real balls!" I have balls. Only in front of the computer. The bikini doesn't look like balls. - I'll put it on then.
Hey, your body is not a commodity. You decide what you do with it.... My body is a commodity, okay? It's my asset. And I will protect it.
- Close the door. - Is my courier here? - Not yet, boss. Let me know when he arrives. I need him right away.
This is my offspring, my future. Do you want to hold him? This screaming meatball is the result of your infidelity. He came out of your wife's vagina. No, I don't want to hold him.
Okay. Ladies, all right, here I am. Good, you guys look really great. I shouldn't play football in a suit. Take it off, come on.
- I had to know. "Paradise Lost." - Whitehall was right. - Whitehall is a busybody. Dad... he replaced that stone during the ceremony, looking for the notch to make sure he never pulled it.
They're on their way. Are you familiar with extremely high-energy cosmic radiation, Captain? The radiation released in that chamber will kill everyone but me. Despite your imperviousness to nuclear energy, you are not bulletproof. I just need someone to shut down the core, then I can safely remove and shield it.
And your wallet, but it wasn't personal. What the hell is that man doing? He doesn't know what the core is capable of. Relax. He's the one who invented it.
Don't flatter yourself, sweetie. - I'm not the sentimental type. - No, but your partner is, the physicist with the big brown eyes. Get that core back up. Start it up again or I'll put a bullet in your friend's head.
Raymond, what's going on? The core has been rebooted. Sorry, Professor, I had to do it. You idiot. I can still remove it.
If I ever get my hands on you, I'll tear you a new one. I won't forget this, comrade. We must leave immediately, Colonel. There's still one intruder, and he's got the thermal core. We don't need him anymore.
We have to go now, Colonel. There is still one intruder and he has the thermal core. We don't need it anymore. We have something far better. Fortunately, they were able to catch him.
-Hans Juhl, ISS officer from Helsingør. -The pig should be shot. -He's as Danish as you and me. So keep your voice down. The train is on its way. We have to stop it before it gets to Gilleleje.
I think that was when we began to look like we do today. That was the age when our species came into being. That was before we got different skin colors. That was before we had different languages and before we spread out geographically. That's where I would like to go, right to the origin. I would like to express my fascination with that ground by kissing it.
How are we supposed to mop the floors when there's always some cow shuffling through with dirty slippers? We are like the one the gods made roll a rock up the mountain, only to see it roll back down.
That's cute. My dad called me Solnischka. That means "little sun." Since then I've grown bigger and hotter. And he's dead. What are you going to do with the plunger now that you've taken it?
No, really. He's really tough. -I know, Vinnie... -Oh, God. -Vinnie, put him in me.
Yes, and then we'll knock Heavenly Father off his cursed throne. I have long dreamed of this moment, of being close enough to you to touch you, to smell you, to feel you. Tell me your name. You can read it on my tombstone.
You tracked that son of a bitch from London all the way here to the devil's asshole because it's your duty? I think there's more to Mr. Talbot than meets the eye. That's the tragedy of it. The serum only lasts a few hours, then they fall back. I can extend the duration of the change, maybe make it permanent.
Wait a minute. - How are we going to get there? - Fix that shit. - What do you want me to say? - Fix it.
- But your home is with me now. - It's called... it's Daisy, actually. My name is Daisy. - Grant knew you as... - Yeah, I changed it.
He put the recorder in the cup to amplify my voice. It didn't just amplify your voice. It gave it a direction. A focus. Valack used your scream as a tool by focusing it.
It didn't just amplify your voice. It gave it a direction. A focus. Valack used your scream as a tool by focusing it. If you're going to use it as a weapon, you have to learn to do it that way.
Kira has made it. Where's the card reader? It should be here. It has to be here. They must have removed it when the Dread Doctors went through there.
Maybe someone should revive them. Don't go. My dreams are not like yours, Lydia. I'm not just a messenger of death. I cause it.
Damnatio Memoriae. They erased every little thing about him. Everything he signed, everything he owned. They burned everything. The name of Sebastien Valet was forgotten for over 150 years, but if he is remembered....
If you get me close enough, I will. We're not killing your best friend. This is mine. He's a family heirloom. I'd like him back, please.
And I dropped it, okay? And now I'm picking it up again. How much? I'll write you a check. It's not for money. You want him out of here, okay?
- Not without hinting at what his plan might be. How do you shut down a city...? Oh, no. What? I had thought about what would happen if he used the Web-Nuke to shut down the Internet, but if he used it properly, overloaded the power grid, shut down equipment at the hospital, caused burst water pipes.
He had no reason to lie. Whatever Reiter has planned, he's gonna kill everyone here. Mr. Queen... It seems we're close to my prize. I want you both by my side when I claim him.
Oliver Queens publicly defamed my client by accusing him of a terrorist drone attack. If Mr. Diggle works for Mr. Queen for free to help Ms. Queen buy drugs illegally, isn't it really that much of an imagination to assume that he would also perjure himself to help Mr. Queen's campaign to damage his reputation? You were there when I took an oath. And then I saw you break it.
Hold on to something. - What? Why? - Why? This elevator only stops at the basement level, and we have to stop it... on the conference room floor.
Now give me the damn... That was embarrassing. I have a tumor on the L4 of my spine. The darn little guy has wrapped itself around my spinal cord. The only way to cut it out requires surgery, after which I am paralyzed from the waist down.
I have a tumor on the L4 of my spine. The darn little guy has wrapped itself around my spinal cord. The only way to cut it out requires surgery, after which I am paralyzed from the waist down. Even all the bees in the world couldn't make a cripple walk and then I read about your miracle chip. Of course, I can't afford it.
Khushu is an ancient Arabic word for humility, a word I would not associate with you. When the first Homo Magi forged these totems, they did so in the image of those whose powers they wished to combine, so attention to detail is essential. There is one piece missing. The Ribalvei stone. They must have hidden it somewhere else.

The Ribalvei stone. They must have hidden it somewhere else. Find it, or Genesis is the least you and your daughter need fear.
Oh my God, it worked! Whatever you guys did was incredible. We only took out one warhead. We still have 15,433 to go, give or take. The code for the targeting hack, can you get it out to everyone? - I'm on it.
How about a bomb threat to clear the store, or a real bomb. Just a little one that won't hurt anyone, but we have to.... Maybe we should just go in. It's too risky to carry the equipment in daylight. What about the elevator at the old hideout? Mr. Dennis shut it down after Larvan's attack.
It doesn't drive out. That never happens unless.... That happens. We can't leave the processor here. - We can if we clone it.
- Is he really going all Star Trek VI on us now? - He shut down our system with a virus. It's an x-axis bi-numeric algorithm. I know it's a bi-numeric algorithm. I developed it in college.
Traumatic events recorded in their environment.... in time. And there are the tranquilizers. You don't believe in ghosts, do you? No. You have to open your mind, Doc, before someone opens it for you.
What? - You don't say that. - What? - You never say that. - No, I was going to say I love whiskey, we should find some and drink it.
Okay, here's what you need to do. See the laser circuit in the back? You have to break it with the mirror. Don't touch anything else. Okay, hold it there.
The round went to the Hidden One. The next one we win. We have a problem. My compass is broken. - Without it, I can't locate the lines.
They have their troublemakers under control. You mean the Catholics. This is my home, Edward. I don't leave my children. One of them is a good-for-nothing who doesn't deserve our protection, and the other has run away and doesn't want it.
It's Maureen. No. I forgot to turn off the stove at Mom's. You're not cooking. That's probably why I left it on.
- Anything new on the killer? - You were right. Large amounts of demon venom in Vargas' blood. - It's a shape-shifter. - It's a shapeshifter. I'm going after him.
Should have gone with the turkey casserole. I'm just saying. Never seen anyone stare so grimly at a turkey casserole. He, uh... reminds me of someone. Do you mind if I eat it?
Don't. Out-of-control chemical transporter heading south on Kester. Copy that. Hey, I can't stop the truck! Somebody rigged it! - Excuse me!
They should have been back by now. I think that counts as "absolutely necessary." I shrunk my exo-suit, I can make myself small and sneak around a bit. You haven't used the suit in two years. And that's after you took it apart for parts of your time beacon.
- We will not be hanged. You will exchange us. For Culper. Where did you hear that name? Sergeant Hickey must have heard it when he was on guard duty outside my tent.
- We all testify at the convention. - He's your relative. - No, I can't possibly do that. Boy, come here. You look like a dear boy. Could I ask you to take the letter in through that door there, put it on the big table in there, and then run back out?
The day... will come. The day will come. Bram and Gracie? I'm back and I have apple juice. I almost didn't get it.
Chick, what are you doing? Chick! Drive your name! - My name? Then you can read it on Google Earth.
Yet, at that moment, she began to freak out about firing white oak at Klaus, well, words were said, hearts broken, veins dried up. You're one to talk about trust. Who was it that gave my dead husband's heart to those who helped murder him? I bought your life with that heart. But hey, you know what, you called me here, so if you have another plan, please, let's hear it.
- Are you sure? - I saw him with my own eyes. Finn must have come back when Davina revived me. The spell was tied to the blood of the Mikaelson line. Either it worked on him or he found a way to claim it for himself.
- You don't need to know. This part is just for you. This is it. This is the spell that created the original vampires. It took an entire coven ages to reconstruct it.
It will take a while, but if I can concentrate it in their heart, we can extract it with this, destroy it, and make sure we don't have to face any more - of these unkillable monsters. - Good. Meanwhile, I may have finally found a way to kill Lucien. My mother once tried to destroy my siblings by reversing the original vampire spell, and according to her grimoire, only the witch who cast the spell can undo it.
- No. At some point I will give in. But there is another way. Where did you find this? The first thing I did when you brought me back was to find that, to make sure Nik didn't put it in me as soon as I nagged him.
And likewise on the detonator. You see? I'll leave the detonator to you. It's armed now. You will keep it for the master.
! Oh, shit ! Fet, they are fighting. - With Palmer. - Turn on the jammer! Turn it on now!
- I never... - Magnus Bane? Maybe. - How do you know that name? - The vampiress said it.
Never seen action movies? We're on our way. What's taking them so long? A fire. Find him!
Wow. Father José, I must not have seen him for two years. I'm curious, come on. He didn't tell me anything, Father Lucas. He just asked me to give you this letter. He said it was urgent. I'll read it and get back to him.
Lucas, I know my wife. I know she is very devout, a strong woman with indestructible health, but now.... Now she's changed. She keeps calling the name of a priest. All night long she calls the name of the priest. Creepy. Do you know what name? I'm sorry, Lucas, I don't remember, but your mother wrote it down at home.
You are scum! In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and all the saints and angels, I command you, say your name! I will not... Go on. Say it!
That is the worst story I have ever heard. You don't understand. Yes, the boy was devastated. But he realized his father was right. He should tame the bird, not grow fond of it.
You sure? They lied to us. They told us what to do for a long time. We must respect the Lightwood name. They have sullied it. They are hypocrites.
Of course. You're right. Do you hear that? That's the sprinkler. Your dad will be mad if we leave it running overnight.
A criminal with wit. No, not that. I pulled some strings and managed to get you to teach a cooking class. I see. I was thinking of calling it "King of the Kitchen," or "Le Cordon King."
[Dalton laughing] Oh, my God! You are the cutest thing in the world. I love you so much, Michael. If you love me so much, come over here and help me zipper up the suitcase. Let's close it on three.
He was a good boy. And now he's dead. You've been out of the business too long to remember. Death is part of the business. Let him be.
You come along. Let's go. The Deputy Prime Minister offered me a job today. In New York. Are you thinking of taking it?
It's about the war. With what? With everything. Roxxon, the Midland Circle, the damn hole, Elektra... Ever since I've known you, you've used this war as a pretext, but never explained it.
This has been on my mind for centuries. The best magic tricks have the simplest solutions. I bribed your guard with a state-of-the-art pen. It had a picture of a woman on it. When you turned it over, she was no longer wearing a bra.
The best magic tricks have the simplest solutions. I bribed your guard with a cutting-edge pen. It had a picture of a woman on it. When you turned it over, she was no longer wearing a bra. I won it from a drunken GI in a Filipino bar in 1944.
- Thanks again. - Yes. Such a tragedy. Well, it's always a tragedy when someone is murdered. No, I'm talking about the tiger. I would have bought him if I had known.
How, we do not know yet. Man, killed with his own award. That must really suck. It was actually... It was very moving when they gave it out.
Man, killed with his own award. That must really suck. It was actually... That was very moving when they got it. When they got it.
- For smoking pot at the crime scene. Excuse me, do you want a drag? No, pull, don't step out. - You brought a joint? - No, I found it here.
Excuse me, do you want a pull? No, pull, don't step out. - You brought a joint? - No, I found it here. You found it here?
What do you want? Congratulations, Palmetto is locked. You got the guy who shot at me. That's what the suicide note said, right? How long did it take you to write it?
I'm looking for Andy Kleinberg. Do you know where he is? Don't waste your time with him. I'll get you a drink. Keep it in your pants, Tommy Bahama.
Your presence is no longer required here. Thank my agents for their help. Your idealism is the downfall of this planet. No. It is the very thing that will save it.
A long day, and yet I have a feeling we have a lot ahead of us. SENATOR CRANE: Any word on our monster? Supergirl, fortunately, has agreed to personally apprehend the assailant, which, I might add, is a great risk to herself. Once she has him, you're free to go.
No, thanks. They think I'm losing my memory. Maybe they're right. I've gone over the test a dozen times. Why can't I pass it?
- Hey. - What? This thing with Richie. Draw up the letter. - To push him out? - Yeah, to force him out. All right, but I'm not giving it to him.
No idea. We are closed, gentlemen. Dries, Joop. We'll take the red car. Yes. If you ask nicely, you can touch it.
Have you seen him? - Your brother has a hearse, doesn't he? - Why? Call him. Wim will pick him up.
"There's another one called Zoff." "Let's go to the Fart first." Let's see where this goes. I have a feeling... The worst thing about traveling through this country is that there are no surprises. I travel every week, and it's a disappointment. Every place is exactly as I imagined it would be.
Ladies, you now have access to state secrets. Welcome to Area 51. Yes, I never want to hear a woman complain again, "That guy just won't call me back." Take a vibrator, press it against his bolt, and then you're going to have to shut down a cell tower, because the man won't leave you alone. Got it?
It shows what kind you are. Look at your sweater. It's ruined. It's dirty. Take it off.
What exactly is this place, other than a health hazard? Once upon a time the best meat packing factory. Yeah, real nice. - Hey, that star on your arm... - I earned it.
Or I had, I don't know, this thing that I couldn't shake off, where I felt like.... Because nothing would ever not be meaningless and empty, then.... Why go on? And then I came here and... It's impressive that I survived this long without knowing I was a mage. I can't go back. Okay. There's a spell, when they question you, they can't read your mind, I write it down.
- Who are we trying to contact? - Charlie. - And who's Charlie? - My brother. He's dead. God, we couldn't have screwed up the spell any more, and we can't reverse it.
Brief announcement. The Van Pelt fountain is temporarily off limits. There has been an encroachment. We believe it's a woodland spirit. Recasting the protection spells may have freed it, just like a mouse stuck inside the walls of a building.
We think it's a forest-and-meadow spirit. Recasting the protection spells may have freed it, just like a mouse stuck inside the walls of a building. No one was seriously injured. Both students involved are recovering in the infirmary. Regardless, stay away until we lock it down.
How about never? That's a growing option. Yes, that's what I thought. The spell is called the Scarlatti Net. We can't break it.
- Marina is a psycho. You were his girlfriend. - It's her spell. I don't... - No, I don't need this crap. No, you need to undo it right now.
I am quite tired. "For Russians, it is culturally important to accept something." I give the floor to the defense counsel, Mr. Kiyose. I would like to explain my request regarding the jurisdiction of this court. The Paris Treaty of 1928 condemns war as an instrument of national policy but it does not declare it a crime.
That's disgusting. Listen, Joe. I showed Jack your proposal. And? He thinks it's great.
Pig-gate Footage of the celebrity chef in a puppet show surfaced on YouTube that many consider racist and offensive. Pig Joe, give me back my cherry pie right now. It wasn't me, I swear. Dang it. Watermelon Sam took it.
I understand you are urging action. Every day we let go by, our task becomes more difficult. The master is raising an army. I will not rush into anything. I have already made this mistake once and I will not repeat it.
The question is whether any other efforts have been made. Follow me, Mr. Quinlan. Follow me as far as you can. Sunlight! By means of the sunlight, the text has been hidden so that the Strigoi can never read it.
You can give her one. Any name you like. She is here to serve you. Give her an order. - She will carry it out instantly.
And would not betray them. That ring again. I don't get it. Where did you find it? I took it off a berserker sent to kill me.
I can't. The thing is, to open a safe deposit box, you need two keys. The bank... has one. And the other belongs to the owner of the box. Well, I don't think Bob has his key anymore. But I think the man who killed him has it now.
Will you zip up my dress? Are you nervous? We're on a date, we're not going to the White House. Come on. Going out is pressure, and I'm feeling it.
It was about two years ago. It took me almost a week to exorcise the demon. And? Was it like Joshua? Did you see him escape?
I'm in total vibe mode now. I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris. I was feeling slower. I was. I stole your speed. I gave it to Zoom.
Is he a psychiatrist? Not at all. Okay, here's your dog. He's not mine. Just leave him on the table, I'll find him some fruit.
Not at all. Okay, here's your dog. He's not mine. Just leave him on the table, I'll find him some fruit. I better take him with me.
You smell like a stripper who died in a cabin. I'm not talking about my perfume. That's why I wait until he gets a little more specific. My mustache. I've been growing it for weeks. and you two have been suspiciously quiet.
I've been growing it for weeks. and you two have been suspiciously quiet. He's very dashing. What mustache? That's right, Jay. Like I'm supposed to believe you don't see him.
Are you talking about my mustache again? No, Manny. We love your mustache. Hilarious. You're telling me you like it now that I shaved it off!
I wanted to, she remains stubborn. I want my lubricant back! I can't spread it around the world if it has palm oil in it. I know. You're upset. But we have a deal. We have to break it.
Not from me. Listen. Did you get the text? I need my samovar for the party. You mean my samovar. I found it at a flea market in 1999.
You mean my samovar. I found it at a flea market in 1999. -I bought it. -And now I have it. You bought it for the Christmas dinner that never happened.
Sure, I'd love to. Enough small talk? Okay. See the man smoking a cigarette? You bring him your stuff. He tests it.
Exactly. Good boy. -He's squirming. -Of course, it's a worm. He'll stop as soon as you put him on the hook.
Rich man or poor beggar, death does not discriminate. Death does not flee from your demons. He does not repent for them either. He does not care about such things. He only cares that now your time has come.
He was generous to you. This is a pardon. He dishonored me by appointing Tréville as regent. The King's last will and testament is complex. Tréville thinks you want to see him.
I know that, Monty. We can't risk Jasper getting in here, not if A.L.I.E. knows what I'm building. Raven, the plan has failed. Clarke's not gonna radio us the kill code. I can find it myself.
If such evidence cannot be found, then you and your comrades will be charged with the lesser charges of rebellion and inciting a riot. These are not capital offenses. I am grateful to you, Mr. Wilson, and to your Mr. Wylie as well. Shall I see that your mother receives your letter? I'm sure our friends will want to read it when I'm finished.
But I have to go anyway. We learned of a victim that is probably connected to the flight club ring that I've been wanting to bust for a long time. Can you find our rental agreement, please? Rental agreement? - I think I packed it by mistake, but we need it before we move.
To find you? What happened? JT? Did you find the van? No. I lost it on the corner of 58th and Park.
What happened? JT? Did you find the van? No. I lost it on the corner of 58th and Park. You couldn't track it down?
- You can't stop the tides. - There are changes. - Okay. Even if I gave you the money, the hotel construction will happen. - I've stopped it before.
And we see through... - Mud? - Yeah, through the mud. I need this place. I don't know what I'm going to do without it.
Could you please salute, General? Active military are not allowed to talk to the press. He handed in his resignation this morning. No shit? We'll report it online as soon as the president accepted it.
I'll leave that for Vi and the girls if you're not interested. Grandma's jewelry? She'd be turning in her grave if I didn't at least offer it to you. She had good taste. Where do you think I got it?
And when she gives her speech tomorrow night.... there won't be a dry eye in Atlanta or the rest of the country. You can keep your post, Cathy... ...in exchange for your delegates. I've been loyal. I got you this table. Do you want to keep it? Or do you want to give it to Conway?
- Yes, sir. Do we have a problem? No, sir. I'm coordinating with Doug. When a dog bites you... you put it to sleep or you muzzle it.
- It doesn't last long. How do we make it more durable? There's not much I can do. You got the access. You're supposed to tell me what people want. They didn't know they wanted jazz until they first heard it.
- Can I have some? - You're not old enough. Do you want some water or juice? We have some juice in the fridge. I'll get it.
- Would they have made the choice that way? - What choice, then? You know nothing but your bombs. Boom, gone. We make a difference because you feel the pain. We felt it all our lives.
This is what a power center looks like. I can offer you coffee, but don't expect a cup. Your brother will be beaten black and blue, you know that? I don't like what Aguirre is doing to the Rayburn name. I want everyone to think of Danny when they hear him, not John.
Extra! I'm gonna fuck Scott! What the hell was that? Your power's out. You need someone to turn it back on?
You're here instead of undercover. I'm clouding your judgment. And you're messing with my head, too. Today I was shot at with real guns and... All I could think about was you. I want to do this job. And I want to do it well. And I just...
What is it? A gift. Consecrated wine from Pope Gregory. Where is the khan? Why did he send it?
-She's so cool. Sextina's music gives me strength, like I can do anything. Don't you feel attacked? For example, the part, "I hope my little fetus has a soul, because I want to feel the pain when I remove it."
- You're walking around without a passport? Will you please slow down? Who carries the passport all the time? I do. - So do I. So does everyone else. No, they leave it in a hotel safe or in a safe place.
The ground crew has to leave the aircraft now because the cabin doors will be closed. Please also make sure that the tables in front of you are folded up. There you are. It's not very complicated. The fabric comes from Jesús, I sell it.
- Yes, that was just meant as a joke. - No, it was a good one. A good joke. - It wasn't. - I thought it was funny.
Hey, you know what, baby? - Let's go. I don't like this place. - You don't? I liked it.
Nicky and Tara. Felicia! Yes, Mr. Drake? This mirror is dirty. I just cleaned it.
Felicia! Yes, Mr. Drake? This mirror is dirty. I just cleaned it. Clean it again.
What does he want? He's after your crystal. Our parents hid it for a reason. Phears' greed for it suggests it was a very good reason. To prevent absolute power. Max, we have to hide this crystal where Phears will never find it.
He's after your crystal. Our parents hid it for a reason. Phears' greed for it suggests it was a very good reason. To prevent absolute power. Max, we have to hide this crystal where Phears will never find it. I don't have it.
Max, we have to hide this crystal where Phears will never find it. I don't have it. I don't have it. Max, where is it? I gave it away.
I don't have it. What? Max, where is it? I gave it away. I gave it to Cammie.
Gets the old blood pumping, huh? Isn't it brave of them to want to save you? Now it's your turn to save them. Give me the crystal. Release her, and you'll get it.
Why don't you let me freeze, like my parents, and just take the crystal? Maybe I don't want to? Maybe you can't. You can't take the crystal away from me. I have to give it to you, don't I?
- Good. I'd really like my crystal back, Max. You want it? It's so beautiful, Max. Will you give it to me, please?
You want him? It's so beautiful, Max. Will you give it to me, please? Okay, whatever you want. That's right, Max, just give it to me.
It's so beautiful, Max. Can I have it, please? Okay, whatever you want. That's right, Max, just give it to me. Put it in my hand, and everything will be fine.
Believing in Valentine's death was stupid. Previously on Shadowhunters... My sister wants you to be her lawyer. At a reasonable price. - Tell me.
I'm just... I ran into some weird people, but I'm fine, okay? I'll take care of it tomorrow. You're not gonna get the blood out of that sweater. - You should just throw it away.
Why? The fox knows, and I knew... all I needed to survive was me and not just to survive, but to be happy. I was... happy. The fox is in you now... in both of you. Feed him.
First, let me make something clear. Richard may be all about forgiveness, but I sure as hell am not. I'm sorry that you and your mom had a lousy relationship, but not a day goes by that I don't feel terrible about what happened to her. I didn't cause her death, okay? I just wish I could have prevented it.
We found an unconscious guard near the rear emergency exit. That could be how he got out of here so fast. Jack. I think he's using Kris's computer to record all this. Turn him over.
Password protected. Monty, we're at John Doe's apartment. Can you hack into his computer? Okay, check out the back of the router for me. Got it.
When I think of the families that have been harvesting, the companies and employees, it's all worth it. What do you hope this film will show? I hope someone will see this film and say, "It was beautiful how people transformed." That he'll watch it because of that, and maybe he'll think about what's possible for him.
Open them. Now we turn on the lights. - Put the gem right in there. - What gem? The one I gave you. Put it in there.
Richard, come on. She's playing her games with you. Amaru told me the truth about this world and the next. There is a place for people like us, Seth. I've seen it.
Amaru told me the truth about this world and the next. There is a place for people like us, Seth. I have seen it. I want to show you something. I've seen it, Seth.
Spread your wings. Simon... do you have a pen? Yes. Sorry, kid. This is going to be as cold as Warlock's sack, like he's going to hang his sack right over you and pull it right over your forearm.
It even fits him. I'll cut off pieces of Daryl and put them on your doorstep. Or better yet, I'll bring him to you and let you do it for me. Welcome to a brand new beginning, you sad fucks! I'm gonna leave you with a truck. Keep it.
I'll cut off pieces of Daryl and put them on your doorstep. Or better yet, I'll bring him to you and let you do it for me. Welcome to a brand new beginning, you sad fucks! I'm gonna leave you with a truck. Keep it. Use it to haul all the shit you're gonna find for me.
But I guess you don't know much about the pen, do you? The wizard left you all the pen, but it is not a simple pen. It's a magical energy. It's a living, breathing thing. It's alive? Yes. And when you broke it, Henry, you sent it down here into the underworld, its purpose unfulfilled.
He is a living, breathing being. He is alive? Yes. And when you broke him, Henry, you sent him down here to the underworld, his purpose unfulfilled. He embodies unfinished business. And now, with my help, you will find him down here.
Yes, but you should get the call before the letter. Can he change his mind? No, but you can talk about the injunction. I have the letter with the injunction. Do you want me to read it to you?
Maybe. Do you have experience? Yes, 40 years. Can I leave my resume here? Yeah, sure, I'll look at it.
A bipartisan commission was sent to Donora to find out more. It recommended the establishment of fresh air zones around London. I never saw the report. For good reason. Our prime minister threw it out. I guess it wasn't a priority.
And who says I'll be inside? Maybe you won't. But if you do, I'm here to tell you what's going to happen outside. Why don't you get out of here? Listen to me. Anita is going to make you a deal, and it's not going to go through Harvey Specter. And if you're smart, you'll take it.
I don't care what they smell. I gave up everything for this firm, and if anyone tries to take it away from me, they'll have to pry it from my cold, dead hands. - And what's their goddamn plan? - Excuse me? Jessica, our reputation is taking a hit. We need to restore it.
That means there is bad news or they want something. - I couldn't get the department. - Don't tell me...they said we're not in a position to poach anybody. That's exactly what they said right before they offered me a job. So you're here to tell me you took it.
- I couldn't get the department. - Don't tell me...they said we're not in a position to poach anyone. That's exactly what they said right before they offered me a job. So you're here to tell me you took it. I'm here to ask you if you want me to take it.
"We would like to testify together to swear to the following regarding Michael James Ross: We never saw him. We never knew him. We have never heard of him. And it infuriates us that he would use the good name of Harvard Law School and bring it into disrepute.
I just got off the phone with Vanessa. David Green didn't show up. Whatever it is, Louis, I don't have time. You better make time, because Anita Gibbs just offered me a deal. And I assume you told her to shove it up her ass.
What are you doing here? I don't live in the store, stupid. Oh, yeah? Have you seen my truck? -My mom bought it for me.
You made this for me? No, not for you, but you can have it now. Just change the bags in between. Why can't I throw up in the bags and leave the basket out? Because I made it.
Of course. I would have done the same. And if Sandstorm is half as good as you claim, - they'll frisk her. - This transmitter is as good as invisible. And if they find it, I don't think they'll let her live.
MCC have jerked off? Whatever? It's been a while since you took off the uniform, but surely you remember what it's like around here, or has your fancy suit clouded your brain? Where there's enough, there's enough. You brought me in to do a job, now let me do it.
I've known about it for weeks. You're not fooling me. No, sir. I have no idea what you mean now. I mean you pull your dick out of your pants and stick it in my sister!
And because they are poor. Now you're getting paranoid, Jonesy. I'm just telling it like it is. What if it was? MCC gave us the stuff, but anyone else would have deserved it just as much.
Yes. We need to take it to a power source. The cattle prod. We know where that is. We just have to get it here.
- I have an idea. - What? This plane disappeared from air traffic control three months ago. Everyone assumed it had crashed into the ocean. When they couldn't find any wreckage, you figured the transponder had been turned off. So, when we turn it back on....
You are religious. That is good. You're going to need divine assistance here. How the hell did we lose them? The tracker's still on the bus. He must have taken it from her.
And it was worth killing for. So the obvious question is, what was in the van? A second set of tire tracks. Judging by the size, SUVs. They rammed the van, forcing it off the road.
Patterson did her research on her security access. Can't we hack in? Sure, if Patterson were here. Her car just arrived at a tow yard in Midtown. - Where did they tow it?
The last part will be... Wait! - Break my thumb. - What? You have to get to Alex before the FBI takes her out. Break it so we can get out of here.
Do we have anyone? Ryan. It started a few months ago when I left the academy. I was working for a private security firm in NY when I got a call. Unknown number. I answered and a voice told me to rent a van and park it on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.
I bet we find the voice distortion software he uses all the time. Look in my back pocket. There's a thumb drive in there with a brute-force algorithm. It'll decrypt Ryan's passwords on the computer. I was bringing it to you when I collapsed. Alex, listen...
That's from the.45. You got shot? Then Booth and O'Connor must have left out some details of the mission. The failed mission. And he blew it.
I thought my parents died on September 11. That is the reason why I am here. But seeing them alive made all my anger, longing, and drive go away. And when I heard what happened to Brandon today, it reminded me how hard this job actually is. It takes real drive to get it done.
Wonderful! Do you have an address? Yes! How many mini pillows does one woman need? Can I ask? My Uncle Curtis left it to me.
Are you really all right? At least I'm not the only one without an invitation to the party. That makes me feel better. To what party? Très sparkling. Isn't it? Finally got some guts and demanded it back from his ex. So when are we going dress shopping for the maids of honor?
That's nice. Wait a minute. Bobo has two skeletons, and the skull belongs to one. - She wants to resurrect them! - Where is he? No. I'm not supposed to give it to anyone. I'll keep it.
All right? Haven't you read a romance novel lately? The heroes always win! Oh, you want to be a hero? Well, give me the skull, or I'll take it out of your lifeless hands.
Haven't you read a romance novel lately? The heroes always win! Oh, you want to be a heroine? Well, give me the skull, or I'll take it out of your lifeless hands. Come and get it.
So they moved their new capital... right next to the Valley of the Kings. You're back. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to pry. I found the catalog for 55 and thought it might be useful for you, - so I brought it over.
That was nice of you. It's the least I can do since he'll be working for us. You didn't know? The Met offered him a job. Well, he can't take it.
Does anyone have anything? - I belong here. - And it's here. You could go through this sand with a fine mesh sieve and come up with nothing new. Well, I lost a cufflink out there in '07, if one of your fellows finds it.
Not connected. Dummies. Just for show. Sorry, I didn't catch your name. My boss never uses it.
It sounds like you're blaming someone. I don't know. Jenny, maybe? I asked her to quit. She was always complaining about her job, but she wouldn't quit.
But the Cho family is steadfast and stubborn. My parents took influence, they did research and mortgaged our house. In 1994, I got into an experimental gene therapy study. By the time I graduated with a degree in bioengineering, I no longer had any symptoms. And now, as a bioengineer, when I see a defect, I want to fix it.
Okay, I just have a very tense neck. We have a schedule here. I'm just going to take a quick look. Good news. There's an appointment open now. - If you want it... - All right, I'll take it.
I understand that. The doorbell rings. I have to hang up. - Caress the belly for me. - I will caress it.
Let Cosima explain it to you. Sarah Manning. Welcome to Brightborn. You're Evie Cho, right? I'll pass on the tour. Cosima can't recommend it.
Could be. Then make me a bullet. You're not going to talk me out of it, Eugene! You owe it to me, and you owe it to him. And if there's a price, I'll pay it.
What about Sasha? Look at me, Rosita. It shouldn't have been you. It shouldn't have been anyone. We'll win, but we have to wait for the right moment or create it... together.
We are all Negan. No matter what you try, you can't do it. But you still have a few choices. Go home. Burn that car, drive it into a lake, make it disappear.
The apple tastes sweet... All about Eve, right? That's right. Adam told her not to eat the apple. She ate it anyway and became wise.
To give in. Not to frantically try not to look weak. You're right, I screwed up. I made you think you had special privileges here that you don't have. Next time you want to tell me something, you can write me a letter and shove it up your skinny ass.
-Seriously. -What? -You're ruining the movie. You don't even like it. Now I think it's great.
Dr. Eckland tracked down the plans for me. You see, they put the time machine and the core on opposite sides so that if one explodes, it won't destroy the other. And watch this. When the Army built this in the 1950s, they put this part over the underground river. - We use it to cool the core lines.
He wanted to appear as Aaron and no, I'm not crazy. It happened. Does that sound even remotely possible? Yeah, there's some pretty weird shit going on with that tea. You used to drink it and see it in your head.
It happened. Does that sound even remotely possible? Yeah, there's some pretty weird shit going on with this tea. You used to drink it and see it in your head. I never tasted it.
This was not an accident. The fail-safe was deactivated. This was intentional. The lens array is totally fried. Someone put it in the wrong way around.
The failsafe was deactivated. This was intentional. The lens array is totally fried. Someone put it in the wrong way. Instead of concentrating the temporal current, it spread it out.
Because it's the only way a group of people can safely live their lives here. That's why. Do you have a pencil? Yes. Great. Then shove it up your ass.
You already know that. So what? It's from the hospital kitchen. I recognize the handle. Yes, there was a reason for that. I hardly have to explain it.
I'm not into blogs. - That's about to change. Jean-Luc longs for Carmen, the love of his life. This is so tragic. It makes me cry just thinking about it. - What's wrong with you? You must read it!
- What can I do, sir? - The lawyer will be here by five. You apologize in writing and deliver it in person. - Bring your protégé. - Protege? You hire someone for the butt, so you save him.
That's how the rest of us do it. Stay. I'll go. Since I'm playing a widow today, I need a wedding ring. Take it.
"Dear Diane, Unfortunately, we have to reject the article 'An Open Letter to Open Letters', despite the values conveyed." Do you know what this means? Effort leads to disappointment? Dreams are stupid? Someone read my article and rejected it.
Please don't kill me. Get up. I need to get in there. Do you know the code? Enter it.
Or any other Diane that we don't know about yet. My point is, I am all those Dianes. I know exactly what you mean. I love the crazy things you do, like hoarding the spaghetti strainers. I had a good reason for that, but I've forgotten it.
A star! Fuck you! Didn't you know he was coming? It's your store. But you never do anything for him.
I'm not dragging the self-centered, self-sabotaging rest of your talent anymore. -Hey. -Thanks for firing me. I'm mixing myself a potato juice to mark the occasion, because nothing better has ever happened to me! I'll get it!
We're leaving now, okay? No. This place is too important to me. It's my home. I never knew anything like it before. But you don't have to die for him.
I guess I'm just tired of BoJack treating everyone badly and still getting everything he wants. A lot of it made up, but real nonetheless. Hearing it from the friends he loves the most, you and me, would mean a lot to him. Okay. But do you think he was that good in the movie? I haven't seen it.
( Where are you running to? ) Remember. The latch is jammed. These fingers work quite well. You said you could crack it.
On the planet Hoth. I see the wind blowing, snow is swept from all the peaks. We have wind! Holy shit! The wind is blowing the snow somewhere, we just have to find it.
To go into hiding in a safe place. I took my emperor from one hiding place to another for months, but you found us. You are fooling yourself if you think those soldiers are the last to pursue you. Our protection is your best chance. If you want it, you have to earn it.
I knew a girl. I brought her deliveries for her family on the canal. Once a week at the same time. Each time she came out on the balcony and smiled at me. She would lower her basket and I would fill it with the goods.
I brought her deliveries for her family on the channel. Once a week at the same time. Each time she came out on the balcony and smiled at me. She would lower her basket and I would fill it with the goods. She pulled it back up.
It's only a matter of time before you become yourself again. Here's my prediction: I'm going to ask you to do this job. You're going to say no. But I won't do it without you.
Whatever. If it helps. Thank you. That would be great. Mommy. ALL SAINTS' FREEMAN CHURCH, ANNEVILLE, TX JESSE CUSTER, PASTOR Listen, I don't run from a losing fight or from bad decisions. But you can pick fights or deliberately provoke them.
Eugene and I had our problems. But in the end, I don't know what I would do without him. You'd figure it out. With mustard? I see him.
Remember, I would never do anything to hurt you. And yet, you manage to do just that all the time. Lucy! Well, Miss Grant's on a green tea regimen this week and spurns her latte, so I thought maybe you'd want it.
You have set a trap for Non. The fire. That was an accident. I never meant to endanger any firefighters or civilians. Not even Supergirl. You thought you'd just rig the satellite, and the kryptonite would kill Non if he flew there and looked at it?
One of our ancestors had stolen from a banshee during the famine. And that was it? Me, I'm cursed and I'm supposed to put up with that? The curse is triggered when someone wrongs you. You will break it only if you kill the one responsible for your anger.
And why are you not the master of the universe? You have created something powerful! A force with which you could subjugate the whole galaxy! A huge army that obeys only your orders. You want to take over a planet and subjugate it to you, although a whole universe is just begging to be ruled by you.
- If you have information that can help us.... - We don't have time for this. Talk. - Jaha's backpack. - What about it? All right, it powers the A.I. And I'm pretty sure if we destroy it, we can destroy them.
- Jaha's backpack. - What about it? All right, it runs the A.I. And I'm pretty sure if we destroy it, we can destroy them with it. I know where it is. Before I was captured, I saw them take him to the temple. They will expect us to escape.
Is there a kill code in that book you didn't tell me about? Then we stick to the plan. Clarke gives Luna the flame. The A.I. in the flame gives Luna the kill code. We enter it here, use our one shot, and the drop is made.
Me. Emori. You are making a mistake. The spirit of everyone who entered the City of Light is on this server. 30 seconds. If you destroy it, our spirit will be gone forever.
This place was safe until we got here. Engine room. Let's go. No. No. Take him and the kid will be fine.
It's hardest at the end. Relax, take a deep breath and help the baby. That's it. When the pain returns, you'll have to push. I feel him!
He'll know who I am. All clean. No pathogens. Dr. Cassandra Railly from the CDC. Where's your I.D.? I lost it.
Now she has a chance to meet them. It's not perfect, but it's something. Cassie. We both know we will lose so much before this is over. I would rather live the moment and lose it than die without having lived it.
Didn't know we had hacked it. Every time he's around, we get stuff like that.... listen. We can't proceed without Oliver Peters. The virus has been destroyed. He's the only one who can recreate it.
The big man is looking for you. No. - Yes. - He got everything he needed from me. I gave him the virus. We destroyed him.
I'm afraid I couldn't find anyone to release it. But that's what you came here for. The only report that mentions a place called Titan. Thank you. You know, whatever battle you want to go into together. It won't be the hatred for each other that will divide you. It will be the lies you tell to hide it.
You're their Andy, okay? Their plaything, someone to "keep warm". So you think this is karma? Yes. If the asshole hat fits, wear it.
Your energy ring. Where is it? The green ring? The captain collected it when I came aboard as a courtesy payment. He put it in his chest. We've got to get it.
I'm ready to shrink. And we have a surprise for you, Brainiac: Shrink ray 2.0. You'll find it's more advanced.... My calculations indicate that it will trigger an explosive charge that would knock me out of the way if I activate it.
Because it's indiscreet. -And I don't have the post yet. -What about the tree? It takes away all the light. You could have it cut back.
I was thinking of the goldfish pond here in Chartwell. The pond, why the pond? It's just a pond. It's much more than that. Because of the fact that you've painted it so many times.
SERVER ROOM Crap. We can't go down there. There are too many of them. We need the key. Without it, we can't get to the computer.
Let me see if I can find Nutterbutter, then we'll take a picture with him too for next year's Christmas card. Ma, we're not taking a picture with the cat. We've got to run. But thanks again for the sweater. I love it.
- Dios mío! Claire, is this true? - No! Okay, I can't do this. I'm just gonna go ahead and walk away. But if lightning should strike this house, you can send it my way.
Damn! - Are you okay, sweetie? - Yeah. - Did you get your check? - I got it right here.
I recently got a chance to make a comeback. I had a decent job, I had a girlfriend who could halfway put up with me. But I blew it. You know, aren't you tired of saying the same shit around here? I'm tired of hearing it.
I also know that you spend way too much time slumbering. If you want my advice, you should take advantage of this disorder, give up sleep and find an activity that tests your abilities. Escape from elaborate restrictions for example. If this doesn't bother you, why did you choose an activity that involves wearing noise-canceling headphones? I didn't say I was impervious to noise, I just said I used it as an impetus.
I thought we would spend some time together and discuss them. I'd be honored. Cassie? May I call you Cassie? I would call you by your real name, but you neglected to tell me.
And the last one a clinic. What kind of clinic? Beauty treatments. And he has his own commercial. Play it.
One thing I know. One thing. I know for sure that... I'm scared and you're not. I don't know any prayers or anything, but.... uh... "David put his hand in his pocket, took out a stone, and hurled it... and hit the Philistine in the forehead.
Nothing, really? What do you think, Mr. Letts? I'm guessing you like being chief legal counsel at Borns Tech. What do you make? Two million with stock options? You should do your job if you'd like to keep it.
Excuse me... Advance? - Grace had just sold a novel. - Impressive. She had a dream and she made it happen.
I have to follow up on this GPS thing. They finally turned it on. Good luck. He really fills out those fitted shirts, huh? What's the GPS thing? One of the missing rich guys had a dog and the dog has a GPS chip and they activated it.
Eggs. So my prediction is. The McDermotts, together until they met a tragic end on Route 520, will spend eternity together in what is, to their usual order, a double coffin. I bet they were that kind of couple who finished each other's sentences. Ordered a dessert and shared it with a single fork.
Chinatown. Got it. Great story. No. That's not how he got the name. He got it because of the way he took the corner.
I have a body, all right? Can you just think of me as a sexual object? Fine. Whatever. If you want to stick your butt out at me, stick it out.
I swear. Why should we believe you? I know where the assembly lever is. It's got her fingerprints all over it, right? She threw it out the car window as we drove down the highway.
No, no. I'm fine. Sorry. Orange juice, 5 dl. Where should I put it?
I work in a dog salon. This dog was there three weeks ago. But the man who brought him came to pick him up before I was done. He was all sweaty, freaked out. He said he had stolen the dog from a cop who had been torturing him, - and that the cop was coming to get him.
Yikes, we miss him! So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names. That's a great idea. Got it. We'll call him... Cooper.
Guess we're talking about you now. Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo has made it clear to me that I am a valuable person and my feelings are important. I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you. Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid and now I have to name it.
Okay, back to me. I've discovered an asteroid and now I have to name it. - Wait, what happened to us? - Well, this isn't about us, it's about what's best for the asteroid. - What are you going to name it?
We haven't settled on anything yet. All right, well done, cat poster. Hang in there. You know what would be nice? Name it after your girlfriends.
Yes. Spider web tattoo included. Andrew Meeks. 39. He was paroled last year after serving 15 years for attempted murder. Sulzbach got him a job as a janitor in a downtown office building. He must have gotten Ed to tell him FBI war stories, saw the respect he was getting and wanted it for himself.
Just like your boss said... You don't have enough for a profile yet. Why are we back here? You've been here before when you were 15. If I visited this place when I was 15, I'd remember. Because you didn't visit it, you built it.
That is not true. You survived. You built the place. The place in your head where monsters can't go. But that place never went away. It was still there for you when you needed it.
In the place where the beast is. Ergo, screw it. Hey, here's a crazy idea. Plover wants the button back? Why don't we just give it to him?
Previously on "The Magicians".... What does that mean? We couldn't have messed up the magic any more and we can't reverse it.
Can you imagine, Quentin, how many times we had this exact conversation? You've been able to slip me truth serum 27 times in 27 ways and - I'm pretty sick of it. - So this is just a big, blood-soaked, "And every day is groundhog day"? They keep mentioning this stupid movie. I still haven't seen it.
"Did it exist? Did it exist? Can we still access it?" We were unsuccessful in that regard. What was the status of the case when you got it?
This is a tragedy. His wife, Gina Larson, had accepted it. She had made her peace with it. But then Mr. McBride convinced her that there was money to be made. Now Mr. McBride wants you to believe in this fairy tale because he can't back up his version of reality with facts. Think about what he wants you to buy: We blew up Larson, we ran over his sister, and we assaulted her lawyer. We had his witnesses convicted of drug trafficking, we killed a snitch and hid him in Mr. McBride's car.
Yeah. Penny, did you know about this? Yeah, let's get out of here! When did you get the engagement ring? My mom gave it to me, and I thought about giving it to you, but then we broke up.
Captain, Watson and I are ironing out a few more kinks, but I think the plan for the raid will be ready shortly. Yes, you can stop ironing. We won't be needing it anymore. - Why not? - Because we no longer have an inside man to carry it out.
And that one, in a building full of heavily armed bikers, shot him twice in the face? I do assume there would be better times and places to take the man down. - Did the runner show up? - No, he didn't. The jailed bikers swear they disposed of him a week ago when one of the hard partying members named "Chainsaw", soiled him in a most unpleasant manner.
I have to prepare an affidavit, but they can keep all of this. - I will let you know if I find anything else. - Okay, thanks. She's got a nice ass, okay. You don't have to stare at it like that.
- I didn't move you. Do you think someone else has? After you went to sleep last night, Marcus informed me that the missing rug was found. The one from the video? The police tracked it from the gang's dumpster to a landfill.
Why didn't you just hand Bardot over to Internal? I couldn't! Not after what he found! Her office computer. He found something when he hacked it.
By the way... I want to go out with the girls tomorrow. Relax. Well, take your cane with you in case you're drunk as a skunk. -You're mean. -Come on. Go get it.
You told me how much you loved Allison. What do you want from me? Your home computer would be a good place to start. We already have phone records that show you called Allison a lot, especially considering she was married. Okay, you want my computer, take it.
Where is he? Keep your eyes open. Declan Harp, damn it, in the flesh... Tell me why you're invading my camp. Oh, I found this son of a bitch and I thought you'd want him back.
So you leave it out on your laptop? No, not on the laptop. This... This pointer. Look at it, it's taunting me, just blinking on, off, on, off, like it's so easy to write a bestseller.
No kidding. Are we friends? I know why you wanted to do it with a letter. So you could dry up in peace, And just imagine the reactions at will. As I read it and think to myself, "Damn.
Okay. Thanks. I think you should go in and see her, Alf. Mia's article was posted on her blog. She must have posted it just before she got hit.
Who their source is. -Are we? -Yes. She published the article anyway. So what was that about? She must have posted it before.
There is a folder. The password was 1-2-3-4? It doesn't work. What else could it be? -Can't you hack it?
The password was 1-2-3-4? Not possible. What else could it be? -Can't you hack it? -I might be able to decrypt it.
- Okay... It's magical. - It's Saturday night. The end of Shabbat. We leave the holy world and return to the rest of the week. And before we extinguish the candle, and while there are still a few sparks of holiness left, I ask anyone who wants to share a blessing to share it with us.
I know you like them. I'm afraid you're letting your feelings block our project. There you go, sweetheart. Here's your passport. Shall I put it in my pocket?
-So he knows we've been here. -Open the vault now! What are you talking about? Huh? Open it now, man! -We can't open it.
-Now! And right now. -Where to? His owner's dead, man! So kill him.
The state records have been forgotten. The guys at the administrative district don't want to know anything about it. I get the electricity from the grid. As far as anyone cares, the place doesn't even exist. On the market, a place like that would cost you about 5,000 a month, but since it's you, I'll give it to your guy for half that.
Every hacker has this. What are they doing? This is forensics. We found his desktop PC unlocked. Once we analyze it, we'll send a full report.
I'm looking for a good opponent. Do you want to play? What do you think? Is Ray right? Maybe it's not about avoiding the crash. But about setting a program stop to find the bug in the code, fix it and continue until we hit the next bug... the challenge to keep going, always fighting for a safe stop.
Pack the malware into a femtocell transmission system, my personal cell tower that will intercept all mobile data. Just like the first time I saw the lists of inflated rental fees, employee names, and member addresses. Everything was viewable. The secret to the perfect hack? Make it infallible.
If you say you need to see him, you need to see him. I'll have RT come by. Boy, you all know you can't jump. I traced the last envelope to the post office in the city it was sent from. There is no evidence on the security camera footage that anyone dropped it off at the post office itself.
Okay. This is a Rubber Ducky. If all else fails, find an FB laptop on that floor. Usually Panasonic Toughbooks. Plug this guy in, wait 15 seconds, then pull him out, okay?
Some of us need to be controlled. Every now and then, it's best to just be the passenger. Just stare at the road in front of you and hope it takes you somewhere you want to go. There's a flash drive in your pocket. When you're at your desk, shut down your PC, plug in the USB stick, and boot it back up.
- No. What? - Roughly done. - Ember, no, it's okay... - I'll remove it.
- She is a good doctor. She's really smart. - You trust her? Yes. She thinks I might try... ...medically induced menopause. My cancer feeds on estrogen, so... she thinks we can starve it to death.
- What are we doing? - We are meeting a friend. But I have a test in history. That's all right, darling. You can take it tomorrow.
- A million dollars. You earned it. - Why the fuck are you taking Bunchy? You want your cut or not? Give it to Bunch.
All right, stay with the artwork. I'll call you when you need to leave. He's clean. "The Kremlin bleeds." - Have you seen it?
Enjoy your shrimp cocktail. That's good news, don't you think? But you don't seem happy about it. I'm not sure. When did you get it?
Enjoyed my freedom. That's not enough. Can I have your shoe? Your shoe. I want to photograph him.
A lever. It should be above the car on a rail. - To unlock in an emergency. - I don't see one. I don't see it.
Let me guess. She gave you a spell. Yes. A return-to-love spell. All I had to do was say it and... ...and seal it with a kiss.
I'm so sorry. You know what, Dex, I like this song. Yes. What's the title? I call it "A Call for Help."
No, no! It's a stray, but we're not keeping it. Keep it down. Your dad can't know he's here. If he sees him, he'll grow fond of him and we'll never get rid of him.
Where did you get the stone witch's jewelry? Normally I only cut women, but in your case I will make an exception. It's just you and me now, Jackie boy. - Go. Go get it.
To remind us that it was true.... ...that you were really gone. I was six, wasn't I? I saw the little white coffin, but I knew you weren't in it. They filled it with sandbags.
Explain what? How you were paid by the royal governor Tryon and the mayor to spy? No? Perhaps the contents of this letter can shed light on things? Why don't you read it to me?
Listen, we're gonna go check out this car. Make sure you get something to eat. Yes. Hey, guys. Scavengers got here before us, cleaned it out pretty clean.
Lies. Lies. I said her name. I forgot. It's ok. Garcia, were you able to track him?
- Who are the Rangers? Look, kid, I don't watch baseball, okay? Yeah, and angels are real. In fact, one is my way off the ship. That spell you painted on to block magic must be blocking him, too.
Not so bad. We're done here anyway. I didn't hear the alarm. I did. I turned it off for you.
I have something for you. And now, ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for Gunnar Lawless! Hey, stand up. Show a little respect. Who gets it?
Hey, get up. Show a little respect. Who gets him? Who gets him? Here he is taking off a glove and giving it to a kid before the game?
Why do you think Oswald wanted to kill JFK? Was he a Castro supporter, or was he working for the Russians? No one will ever know, at least I don't think so. How did you know about the letter? Did you destroy it?
So Sheldon, there's something I've been wanting to talk to you about. I know it's kind of a delicate project. To narrow it down to any possibility. What is it? Well, your birthday's coming up. You never let us celebrate it before.
I have it. Here you go. That's him... look at the date on the back. And Lorelai... The antivirus I mentioned. Do you want me to install it?
I had not expected her was full of coffee, so I rushed towards her, which she saw as "stranger rushes me." -Oversensitive. -I felt stupid. She handed me her purse. -Did you keep it?
-Don't spur them on! -What's going on here? Dictionary, Thesaurus, Mathematical Principles of Natural History... You have a letter from April. I was going through it for two hours when you called.
Follow me everywhere except to the bathroom. The bathroom is fine, too. -Who's the burger for? -Miss Kipney. She doesn't like it.
You just have to love Noam. Is this on? -Why are you getting up? -I was getting cheese. -I'll get it.
-I don't care! -People miss the poem! Just for the record! Hey. What are you guys up to? "I'm drinking your milkshake. I'm drinking it up!"
And yes, I can create this hairstyle from memory. Your new orders. Your duties as commander of the garrison. - Commander? - New York may suggest someone, but since you held the post when I was a prisoner, I think they'd let you keep it.
Listen, that was Tom. He was supposed to get on the bus with Lila. He apparently got the dates mixed up - and now thinks it's his fault. - Shit. He even had the schedule with him. He even had the schedule with him, but... He must have read it wrong.
Sir! - Arnold is a traitor. - What? It's right here in this letter. Anna got it from André's desk.
- Eleven. - Excellent. Hey, is your essay ready? - Theoretically. - Finish it!
What do you want me to do, General? Declare war? Why not? Forty minutes ago, they showed me the nuclear case. Had it long enough to try, I guess.
Which is? You don't commit to something until it's done, right? What if this is just the beginning? I don't remember this suit. I had to borrow it.
No, I just told you we'd get the tree. Oh, right. Did you know Norman had this letter? It's meant for Emma. It's from her mom... and I found it here the other day.
- Where here? - Right here. In Norman's room. Strange place for it. Well, let me see it.
Wanted to find out about Emma. I didn't want to get involved. You know what? I'm good. But, um... why did Norman have this letter? Oh, she was gonna give it to me too.
I didn't want to get involved. You know what? Fine. But, uh... why did Norman have this letter? Oh, she was gonna give it to me too. I didn't take it, so I guess she gave it to Norman.
- Good. It just needed a control plate. - That was it. - Oh, great. Thank you. You're welcome. By the way, if you want to get rid of that old furnace, just give us a call and we'll come pick it up.
This is Earp country. - It's ours! - But returnees can go in. We need the talisman. I know we need it. I buried it.
There you go. Your instincts are not deceiving you. She's here somewhere. And yes, she put a flea in the ear of some of my weaker brothers. But I know her name. - Give it to me.
I think you're starting to drive yourself crazy. It's up to him. At some point, you have to learn to let go. Amelia took that drink. It doesn't matter who offered it to her.
Try something new. Everything bad you said about me is true. I had a plan. And I was going to give it up for you because we were going to leave, but that didn't work out, so my plan is back on. I'm gonna go through with it.
I'll be right back. Where are you going? To get my keys. The case won't be reassigned until tomorrow. That means we have to solve it tonight.
That would make me very happy. One more thing. Yes, Mrs. Park? This ring belonged to my mother-in-law. I was saving it for Joon's wife.
I don't know. Okay. Jake. I didn't mean to interrupt, Jen, but you left the Dufresne case in the office. Okay, I'll take it off your hands. I'll put it right here on the table.
Well, you've reached the edge of town. Any further and you'll freeze to death. - Just get in. - No, thanks. I have a taser. Don't make me use it.
It is about redemption. Redemption? What salvation? This test here, it is meaningless. Because no one in the world will ever see it.
It is a long story. What is in this vault? Something that can't be released. You have to be a little more specific. First, you have to swear that you will never open it.
That's nice for you. Yeah, but the thing is, the investor presented us with this contract, okay? You know, Dion knows food and I know wine, but neither of us have a clue about the legal part. So I was wondering if you could... you might have time to look it over.
- No. Only one in millions has this special ability. Shows the picture in front. Remember this guy? We're trying to identify him.
No, I just know that you said that. We've been back 20 times. Dude, do you remember bagging an old stuffed monkey from Molly's room? Who cares about a stuffed monkey? The one who stole it.
He's coming. Captain. I'll, uh... ...bring the plate back. Thank you. If you could bring it in here.
I'll be right there. Good job. You two. Put him in a compromising position. But be careful. I'll take him. Thank you for bringing him back.
- Extremely many. More than ever before. Adam. Barbie's broken. She's not broken. Get the head, then I'll put it on.
Barbie is broken. She's not broken. Get the head, then I'll put it on. - What's wrong? That's a funny line, "Get the head, then I'll put it on."
First... First comes the color. Is it neon purple or garnet red. Clear or a little cloudy. Then we swirl the wine, bring in air. Let it expand, and release a few aromas.
Is it neon purple or garnet red. Clear or a little cloudy. Then we swirl the wine, bring in air. Let it expand, and release some aromas. Swish it really well.
Come here, Peanut. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. How about you? Spencer's tooth came out... one of them. He wanted you to see it.
How many apartments are left to search there? - Not many. - All right, thanks. Well, the driver of the truck was questioned. He received an electronic dispatch order from Ingersoll, Ontario, saying to drive the truck in from Canada - and leave it where we found it.
- Is this related to the burglaries? - Break-ins? Mom, didn't you say something about a black truck? That's right. I saw it several times, driving up and down.
Well, based on the pallor of the body, it was clear that he was moved after. - Thank you. - Yeah, you're welcome. You told Detective Rizzoli that you were alone in the house when you killed Robert. Yes. Go ahead, lift the dummy up and move it over there.
Not really. I matched Marvin Holtz's known associates. No connection to a butcher shop or anything like that. The closest thing I found was a deli on East Concord. Holtz's brother-in-law owns it.
Nothing like that. Okay, if he thinks of anything else, give us a call. Okay. Thank you, detective. Come on. Look, I don't know if it was a guy or a gal, but I'd know that zombie if I saw him again.
Can you mark all the missing credit cards for me? If someone pays for even one tank of gas, I want to know about it. - That's my cup. - What? That's my cup. I left it at your house.
The name? Bob Rasmussen. Janitor. We have reason to believe that someone staged his murder to make it look like an accident. Now, I can't imagine Dr. Lutz making a mistake, but if he did, I'm sure he'd want to know about it and do absolutely everything he could to correct it.
Yes, it said. Well, then why does he have a peanut butter granola bar? I mean, that can't be good for him, right? It's a postal bar code. - Why did he hide it there?
Well, he could have been wearing gloves when he used the bat. Well, if that were the case, we would expect to see smudges on the prints, but there were none. There you are. We just got the autopsy report from Robert's ex-girlfriend in Seattle. I'll put it on your desk. Great.
But our victim's head wound was so significant that I couldn't clearly attribute it to the stage or the field field hockey stick. Why use a field field hockey stick if he knew how to kill her with his bare hands? He didn't. The field field hockey stick is not the murder weapon. He only kept it so he could blame Clair for the murder, in case we don't consider the death an accident.
Where would you find her name? Not in the hospital archives. Those records had been untouched for many years. Well, with that many deaths and a suicide, someone must have reported it. If we can't find the article, that means someone stole it.
Wait a minute. This is the same model of bike that our victim was riding. And look what's under the saddle. A water bottle holder. If there was an explosive in the bottle, someone could have planted it long before our victim got on his bike.
Finally. I have two procedures scheduled for this afternoon and would really appreciate not missing any of them. No one needs Botox that badly. I'm not adding toxin to the body. I'm ridding it of excess.
What have you gotten yourself into? One of the trainees... I was showing him off and I think I hit a nerve. When the class was over, he pulled the "Hey, I dropped my pen. Can you bend over and pick it up?" Gag off.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons has existing aliases for operations like this. You are Lisa Caro. You're being brought in for an extradition hearing. I hate the name Lisa. Relax. You only have it for a few days.
Well, Edward was a little luckier than Michael. Take the buckshot down to the crime lab. Maybe we can get fingerprints or DNA off it, - if it was hand-loaded. - I already sent it to Kent.
It seems that he was pierced with some kind of cylindrical object. And it's very clean. Yeah, but a wound like that would have bled profusely. The family said the funeral service was at the Mason Funeral Home in Mission Hill. They had the casket until the hearse picked it up and brought it here this morning.
He attacked me! That's bullshit! I was trying to tell you that this is the guy. I don't care what you were up to. You wanted an emergency, now you got it.
Constance Clootie. Do you even know what "free" means? You can go! - What did you do to my head? - I was cleaning it.
- I was wondering... - Yes, Agent Fitz? Can you please tell me what exactly you were designed to do? Of course. Dr. Radcliffe is very sorry for the pain he caused, when all he ever wanted to do was prevent it.
- Interesting. There are no testicles on the cold regulator, but I still like it. Why do you have a storage room? Wait and see. How long have you had it?
- Nothing. It was never about you. It was about the leopard. What? What were you going to do, steal it?
- Are you the owner? I am the sole owner. An employee, me. I like this place. Do you want to sell it to me?
Don't forget details. And I need something from Rocco. A pacifier. - In my room, on the dresser. - I can get it.
And my name is Seeley Booth, and I'm a Special Agent in Homicide with the FBI. When I'm called to the scene of a crime where the remains are badly burned or decomposed, I call in Bones. He calls me "Bones." Even though I am his wife and the mother of two of his children, he still calls me by a nickname I despise. You used to despise it, but now I think you like it.
I didn't know what his dream was and neither did he, so I did what he suggested and left. And without wanting to be rude, it sounds like I made the right decision. I feel sorry for the victim. I feel like he never found his place in the world. Maybe he didn't find it because he never really looked.
From the height of the intercondylar fossa, I would say that it was of European descent. And there is marbling on the abdomen, rigor mortis has passed, lividity has formed. I would say the time of death was about 36 hours ago. The mandible is intact. We should be able to match it to dental records.
You also help track down the diamonds, right? Yes, we can etch microscopic markings, which gives our customers the greatest possible security. What about the diamond we found? Who does it belong to? I remember this particular diamond quite well, I marked it personally.
Today's rich are no different than kings and queens once were. They like expensive, fancy things that no one else can have. No, I meant specifically this dagger, whose is it? Well, that's a different twist. It was loaned to a jewelry store for an exhibition called "Crown Jewels of the World," but jewel thieves stole it three days ago, the day it arrived.
She's a lost cause. In terms of the movies, I mean. - But really now. - Well, in any case, this is excellent work. And if a French tapestry is our murder weapon, I can hazard a guess where we might find it.
I think I would like to have, how do you pronounce it, I would like to have a.... 'Amburger. Ze Damm-burg-ers are magnifique. Hey, and here people say the French can't laugh at themselves. If you're Inspector Rousseau with the Police Nationale, you better get a sense of humor, you know? And use it to flatter yourself for information.
He may have been careful, but the killer had an emotional connection with his victim. Perhaps he could not think clearly. - Meaning? - He did what you did automatically. He slid the dagger into the sheath before thinking about cleaning it.
That's fine, Chadwick. You can do whatever you want, because now we are in the actual process, the gathering of evidence so we can get a court order for your DNA. Actually Booth, I'm not sure we need the DNA to prove that he did it. - And why is that, exactly? - When you strangled her, she took the dagger and swung it backwards to hit you.... Either here.
Rafalski here. 10-23 on Gander Road. What's going on? We received an automatic alarm from this residence, the call went directly to 9-1-1. I'm just wondering if you can tell me what you're doing here. We must have set it off by accident.
- I won't hold him off for long. I told you not to move. Now he's coming down the hall. You set off the alarm. - You knew we'd set it off and the police would come.
Answer it. Her backpack. Did you find her backpack? Why do you ask? If she has it, she has her cell phone.
These are speculations that border on harassment. Do you remember that you said it was all about Marcella? - If so, not anymore. - What do you mean? I'm just saying, if there was a contest, I won it last night.
Check it out when you have time. Hey, Marcella... Matthew Neil's calendar was on your computer. How did you get the contents of that computer? Actually, what happened was Marcella Backland broke into my office and stole it.
Then a laughing third person comes from somewhere and makes off with the loot. Or am I looking at it the wrong way? No. There is definitely a war. You just don't see it yet.
But I forget. What is happening to me? I was wondering when you would notice. I think of a moment from my past and then it disappears. I can't get it back.
What? "I do." She left a message. I WILL What, a marriage proposal? No... She borrowed a ring from me this morning, said she needed it as a cover.
The night before the job, Marcus met Edgar at a fancy club to get the worm. When Marcus came back, he and his laptop reeked of cigars - and that's all I know. - Where is Marcus's laptop now? Okay, if there's still a copy of the worm on here, maybe I could find out who wrote it.
I have decrypted the worm's security code. What is it? I recognize this code. Do you? How? Because I helped write it, a long time ago.
Good job ironing things out for Hayley at the FBI. Yeah, it didn't hurt that they could claim credit for closing a terrorism case, so.... Oh, let there be light. That was quick. Having been involved in the development of the worm, Hayley knew exactly how to help the UK authorities defeat it.
Okay, Stef, what happened? You told Caroline you would be with her when it was safe and you never came. You broke her heart. Virginia forced Lucy Bennett to use magic to seal a safe in the armory. Our sister Yvette was still in there when they sealed it.
I don't have much time. And I need answers. Your sister Alex is hell-bent on me opening that vault. I need to know what's in there. It's a question everyone's been asking since 1882. When my great-grandfather first managed to open it.
Stop moping about who you're not and try being who you are, the guy who's in love with Caroline Forbes. You gave her vervain first, Stefan. According to my rules, that's one step above flowers and chocolates, because if you love someone, you have to use force every once in a while. Look, I know you've been locked away in a coffin for the last three years of actual civilization, but this is legitimately terrible advice. Actually, brother, that advice is so good that I will take it myself.
Who knows? You want me to beat you at cribbage? Set up the board. And if you want to draw something, here's the winner's face. Right here. Do me a favor. Dip my head in here, hold it there until I stop breathing.
So you unselfishly spent the night in the whorehouse. He's been coming on to you lately. Hey, TJ, jacket's not enough. Get your hoodie. Don't you want to wear it?
I remembered something else about Nordkoster. When Wendt wanted to borrow my phone, he had a suitcase with him. - He just left it there. - Strange. - When I opened it, it was empty.
Come back, Shane." Then Shane rode off into the night. I don't know why, but it grabs me every time. I remember that movie. We saw it on our honeymoon.
Data is like fishing. You wait the whole and catch nothing. But a blind date? It's like someone driving up in a boat and throwing a fish down. You just have to gut it and eat it.
I have no mythology. I have the infallible Word of God. But very interesting. I didn't mean to denigrate their faith. In fact, I admire it.
Big balls, big self-confidence? Oh, my ... no. Seriously. Look, I found the punch by e-mail. Ooh, who sent it?
I have the latest numbers. Taro is ahead. - Shit. - By one point. I'll finish him off.
Oh, yeah? Hey, is... Is that your lunch? What not many people know... I'm the only person in New York who doesn't like kale. What if I steamed it with a little cream and pancetta?
Consisted mainly of bleach and potassium chloride. The Bensonhurst Bomber's personal recipe. I can still smell the chloride. It was hidden inside a soccer. The victim, Tom O'Leary, picked it up and it exploded in his hands.
But we've managed just fine without you. For the most part. Your suit looks bulky. Actually, it fits me perfectly. It's made of a custom alloy and it's pretty battle-tested. I've even worn it in space.
I wanted to torture you a little at first. But since you're in such a hurry, I'll be happy to accommodate your schedule. Wait. I'm a scientist. The exo-suit? I invented it.
Exactly. Wait, what? The Shogun stole your future suit? After I crashed to save you. How come the Shogun can operate the nuclear suit? - I designed it to be foolproof.
- Why did you open a crack? - I didn't. - What? - That's why we called you. - Can you close it?
I... I saw a transformer blow up when this thing went by it. - That's weird. - What's strange about it? The monster didn't even touch it.
I saw a transformer explode when this thing went by it. - That's strange. - What's strange about it? The monster didn't even touch it. It exploded before it reached it.
Nothing near the precinct. Wait, what's that? Frozen food storage. There it is. Okay, I'll isolate the feed so no one else can see it.
Collins is shot through the head. - What the hell is going on? - I'm really sorry about all this, Sergeant. You're not here to secure the trigger. You're stealing it.
I got the forensics report on the clothing rag from the ragman. Please tell me we're not really calling him that. What did you find? It's over 2,000 years old and... - radioactive. - That means traceable. If the weapons buy goes through, this guy's gonna try to stop it.
When did evidence babysitting become part of my job description? Ever since I trusted you. Do you? I mean, all things considered? If we didn't think you were right for the job, we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?
We believe that Rene was held captive right here. - Was? - The blood's still fresh. They must have moved him first. KH-10 shows a van moved from this position 40 minutes ago. Can you track it?
So far, I've managed to do this every time someone has asked me this question. - Got it. - Where? This is a little awkward, but.... Oliver made me promise that when we get our whereabouts from Rene, I should just share it with him.
He can do it. - Man, you got a lot of faith. - Green Arrow. - Keep your voice down. You're not getting the job done because you're not taking it seriously enough, maybe because you haven't lost anyone.
- Just like me. That was incredible. There's the controller. She seems pretty attached to it. Maybe we just remove it.
And in that case, it might kill you. I could really use a genie right now. I wish my kid was already born and sleeping through the night. Bro, fatherhood has made you so damn boring. If I had one wish, I'd use it to become the top MMA fighter in the world and take home a different hot chick every night.
Hey, Eamonn, you're not fooling anyone. I can see you there. Yes. It's funny you should recognize my car by the sound of it. Have you driven it recently?
You missed your last appointments. We had a difficult session. What exactly happened at the meeting? I brought her a stew. I made it myself from a rabbit I shot.
I made it myself from a rabbit that I shot. - Wow, you shot a rabbit? - Right? You know, I didn't make the stew for anybody but Jean. It was homemade, but she... turned it down.
If you had to. In fact, I want you to put them in the order you would eat them. Listen to your gut. My gut is telling me very loudly not to play this game. Guess I could cut the mold off the crab apple, give it a good wash, and technically? the cockroach is edible if I cook it....
"Killing to protect a loved one is understandable, even if it is premeditated." "Taking pleasure in torture is worse than murder." - I think this test would be torture. - It's a little macabre. People do it voluntarily?
I was just looking for one thing that I lost track of. Years ago, I brought an antique ring here from London. It was intended as a gift for the Countess of Morcar. I may be visiting the Countess soon, so the ring came back to me. You haven't seen it, have you?
Then you can check my answers and see if you agree with my new theory. You're doing Dr. Naylor's survey? Why would you do that to yourself? And why do you listen to disco music? I'm taking the test because you said Arthur Tetch took it.
Yes, occasionally. When he wants something out of sight and out of mind. Me, for example. This ring was my mother's. Always struck me as odd that he kept it at all.
This ring belonged to my mother. Always seemed strange to me that he kept it at all. I never figured him for the sentimental type. Turns out he's not. He kept it just in case he needed it.
I am not responsible for her drug use, or for any tendencies I may have inherited from her. On the other hand, I'm really not a fan of denying personal responsibility. Hence the repetition of the step. Are you going to give your father the ring? So he can give it to a corrupt official who may have deceptive information to sell?
I don't understand. This is the DANTE survey. Yes, we were wondering if you ever took the test yourself? Dr. Naylor didn't allow it. She didn't think anyone on the team should take it.
Request permission to withdraw. Granted. Go to the... The crystal will not serve you. Nor will it serve you... if I take it from this hated city.
Now there is no way back. Situation report. Ulric killed some good men. - What about the ring? - We don't have it yet.
You were never very smart. Through the empire, a new future would have beckoned you. You can't run away anymore, princess. The ring. Give it to me.
I came only to tell you that you are not kings. Your value was weighed and found to be too light. Now, burn. You will lose your precious ring. But it is not too late to save it.
Genesis did the work here. In your house, Chasseron. - What do you want? - Your post. Now I can give it to you, or you can take it.
- What do you want? - Your post. Now I can give it to you, or you can take it. You could put it another way. I take it, and you pretend to have given it to me.
What's going on? Lucas is the son of Claudia Marène and a jailbird, Pierre Barrès. How do you know that? I did some research on Lucas. He manipulated his resume and sold it to us for 20 years.
What's wrong with your cousin? He always goes too far. When we were little, he borrowed the neighbor's dog. - He stole it? - Everyone was looking for him.
He always goes too far. When we were little, he borrowed the neighbor's dog. - He stole him? - Everyone was looking for him. No one found him.
- Sold. I'm done with it. - With the trailer? - Yes. I don't need it anymore.
I'm starving, too. No, I'm ready to get married. I proposed twice and you still haven't answered me. I bought a ring. You told me to keep it, so it's just gathering dust in a drawer.
You just want to know what's going to happen. What do you think? Here's what I think, Karev. I think when you get to the point where you're walking down the aisle with someone, she deserves some trust.... and faith. She deserves that benefit of the doubt. So I'm giving it to her.
Do you have any proof that he's even still alive? I did. He was destroyed. I had his left thumb in a jar in my office. Krasnov cut it off himself.
This one looks like it's been here forever, and this one looks brand new. Is that important? It is if it means there was a bomb strapped to it. Krasnov would not have risked assembling an explosive device on the back of a water truck. He would have prepared it and tied it to the hand truck in advance.
Most of the payments were made in an area in Queens where there are a few flophouses. With any luck, they'll find him in one. If he was Moriarty's agent, he'd be on the other side of the globe by now. Yeah, she probably wouldn't have given him a bunch of gift cards either. Vikner may have her job, but that doesn't mean he's doing it as well as she is.
You had a little preview of the most massive cock in the world. It's perfek, is it? I didn't really get it. It was hardened by the gods. You saw him?
I didn't really get it. It was hardened by the gods. You saw it? I heard about it. It's so thick you can't get your fingers all the way around it.
Put on speakers. Good. Hold on. That's great. And no, I didn't mail it.
Why did you tell me? You don't even know me. I'm a pretty good judge of character. I'm pretty sure I can trust you. If you still need proof, I can give it.
I decide who is off limits. You're Nolan Keats? Yes. It's my nom de plume. I don't believe you. If you need proof, I can give it to you.
Dear Ashley, I would like to invite you a little deeper into my world. What would you think of a real submission experience with me as your guide? If this piques your interest, you will find enclosed a sealed envelope with the first task. Do not open it if you are not ready to dare to descend into the dark and get lost in wonderland with me.
This... is our home. I am not broken. I know. Elena? Our truck, he took it.
I can't get through. Building 5, 802, hurry. Please save my wife and child. That's a nice coat. Where did you buy it?
This is my coat. It's my mom's. I told you, it's mine! It's my mama's! She was wearing it just now.
- Who drew this? - Rembrandt. - Where is the earring now? - In the central archives in Gothenburg. Then we'll go and get it.
The guy I'm meeting at dinner tonight is the hematologist who is doing the analysis on Alice Tetch's blood. I'm free after 10pm if you want to call. Thanks for the coffee. We found the truck. They left it in the Narrows.
You really thought I was going to give you real bullets? You're an idiot! I'm gonna kill you for this! - Sounds like we're missing all the fun. - There's plenty of fun left for you. You know, if you're going to hold a woman hostage in her own club, you might want to search it first.
- Pulled him away from a truck. - Get him on the phone right now. I already tried that. No answer. What happened, did you forget your cane? I don't need it anymore.
- Excuse me. - Yes. Who's been doing this job the longest? Maybe me. I did it for two full months.
- Yes, it was almost right. - Do you want something? - No, not now. You know, I have to tell you something, Rowena, I looked at you once and I just wanted to break your pathetic neck again. And keep it broken this time.
Laws of the universe and all that, so.... I didn't ask to come back here. No, you didn't. And you hate it. The look in your eyes, I've seen it before.
Yes, but there is much more to it than that. Everything in English is for my employees' needs. Everything in red is for me. The Persian text is coded. They won't crack it.
It makes the murder of Sabine Raoult all the more senseless. My father was never a threat to Vikner's rise. Did you find anything? Where's the calendar for 2013? Kitchen. I brought it down when I was making dinner.
I'm looking for your father. I have not been able to locate him anywhere. He's leaving today. I don't think so. I got this letter by courier, just a short time ago, and the man who delivered it said he saw your father write it.
From the 15th to the 19th century, human trafficking flourishes in the triangle of Europe, Africa, America. Nearly 12 million men, women and children are sold into slavery on the African coast. They are snatched from their homeland and shipped across the Atlantic. White slave traders take them to the New World, where they are forced to work. After a century and a half, the trade reaches its peak. Attempts to prohibit it fail.
Whatever happened, I know one thing: that you are the victim. Yes? - Can I go? - Hey, Isa. - Hello. The autopsy report. I'd rather bring it to you myself.
Thank you. - Kim, I... Dear passengers, because the tracks in front of us are blocked, we unfortunately had to stop. We are located in the area of Daegu East Station. There are two options: We can wait for a recovery team, or we have to continue our journey to Busan on another train. After this announcement, I will try to find a working railcar and put it on the leftmost track.
Hey baby. Go, Jacob, go! Come on, buddy, you got him! I hate this game. Why doesn't he just throw the ball so he can get it?
I beg you, cover for me. And I beg you to keep the next appointment. Monday morning, 11:30. Two days from now. My next appointment shouldn't be until Wednesday. I moved it up. I'll try.
You met Alejandro in a palace? In Madrid, yes - like in a fairy tale. I didn't know it at the time, of course, I was full of champagne. Oh my God, I can't stand champagne! I had a crazy night at college, and if I could only smell it now....
I can't believe we're doing this. - Do you have your key? Yes, in my purse. A little further. It's the it's the Tesla. - Open it!
Yes, in my handbag. A little further. It's the it's the Tesla. - Open it! Open it!
You held and... -Blue. -What? -Toxicology is looking at the cake. Let's check in with the person who sent it.
From whom? Looks like identical tweets from a pair of robot accounts. They were tweeted automatically. Like spam. Someone wanted to place the tag. Putting it out into the world.
Someone holds an election and then kills the winner? -My God, that's just sick. -Yeah, and more and more are participating. Day one. 63 people used the hashtag for Jo Powers, okay? By day two, 223 have used it for Tusk.
-My God, this is just sick. -Yes, and more and more are participating. Day one. Sixty-three people used the hashtag for Jo Powers, okay? Day two, 223 have already used it for Tusk. -And who's using it now?
- I'll get the backpack. - Rav will take care of it. Rav will take care of it? Great. I don't want to take it inside.
With a little Krav Maga instruction, I'd kick your ass right now. I would show you. Kali ma. I'll have some more wine. I'd offer you some, but you can't drink it.
It won't happen to me, it won't happen to us. Do you want me to come home? Just make sure you're still the same at the end. Three years in the jungle fighting the FARC. Hugo Martínez chose his path a long time ago and hasn't left it since.
Do not move! Hands so that I can see them. Easy, easy. You want my ID? Take it out slowly.
I've been thinking. I could buy the land next to yours. A few cows, maybe some sheep. And have my own farm. We could farm it together.
I will not rest until this is done. Álvaro, drive slowly. Park up ahead. I only have a notepad. I'll go get it.
Does this salad dressing look like it's drizzled on? - Yes. - No. No, this salad is dripping. It's floating in a lake of salad dressing like little Kate Winslets in Titanic. Make it disappear.
This is my calling. Open it. Is this my resume? KARA DANVERS REPORTER When you interviewed for the assistant position, something about you caught my eye. So I wrote "reporter" on your resume, put it here in this drawer, and hired you on the spot.
Mrs. Salvon? Why did you keep your parakeet after the way they changed? It belonged to my former husband. The bird hated everyone. When Gunter passed away, I just couldn't put him in quarantine.
The station that broadcasts it is not to blame either. It's you guys. Why do you watch such things? It's your fault because you ask so little of us, and we're content with that. I'm not feeling my face right now, but you know what? I knew exactly what the job entailed when I took it.
- Is he gone? - He was gone, but he's back. - What? So he's not gone? I conquered once, I'll conquer him again.
For two decades we were protected and served. Now we rule these streets. Dad, my... My seat is wobbly. Yeah, and that's because I put it in last night, and the light wasn't great.
You have lost your way. It's time... - ...for something new. - Enough! Get the dog. - If he resists, shoot him.
Is everything ok? Check the penthouse. It's been posted "do not disturb" since yesterday. Do you have the master key? - I misplaced it. - Take mine.
- Get in. - All good. - You can't come in here... - They have the Soul-Swapper! And you know who has it?
Patrick Spring. Crazy to see it so close, huh? All that money and then... Where's the head? We keep it separately.
Crazy to see it so close, huh? All that money and then... Where's the head? We keep it separately. You can look at it.
- I burned down your house? - Where's Lydia? She's not here. - Bring me the dog. - What for? - Why do you have him?
- That doesn't make any sense. Oh, man. Seriously? You know that song? - Sure. - So you've heard it before?
Patrick Spring rarely left anything to chance. When Patrick put me onto you... He knew. He knew he was gonna die. Yeah, he probably didn't hire me to stop his murder... He hired me to solve it.
Yes. Have I only made mistakes? Yes. Did it work? In a way, it did. I had a plan and I implemented it. And it was flawless.
But I believe that I also deserve respect. Even though I am a nobody. What do you want from me? I want you to understand what I'm doing right now. Sit down. I may lose this war but I have to fight it because it's my house.
He got an identity card, even without a residence permit. Your address is listed in it. - So: Where is he? - I don't know. You don't throw away a letter from the president. We gave it to a churchman who knows how to reach him. Who?
Hey, what are you doing with that corn on the cob? Cosmo, out. That's not for you. No. -He swallowed it.
I have to go. Hey, Mom. Who were you talking to? Nobody, it was the TV. I just turned it off.
I doubt Pinkie ever held a gun in his life. Maybe it's a Dick Cheney situation where one shot the other. If Pinkies are so inexperienced, why did Dan invite him? Dan needs an audience. You know what they say, if a bear craps in the woods and no one saw you shoot it, is it really dead?
Remember that scarf you thought was Molly's? That was a gift for James. Why would Molly have that? James came over a couple of times. Maybe he forgot it and Molly used it.
It was ruled a suicide, but in light of the allegations in the Molly Ryan case.... He didn't kill her. Hanna wrote me a letter. A suicide note. I got it the day after she died.
He did not kill her. Hanna wrote me a letter. A farewell letter. I got it the day after she died. I still have it.
Hanna wrote me a letter. A farewell letter. I got it the day after she died. I still have it. You have it at home?
- Yeah, people are - so mean. - It's serious, Stan. We need Grace's passport back. I've done the research, and we could get it back under section 29B of the criminal code....
What about the thong? I didn't like that Molly had so many expensive things for a poor student. I suspected a sugar daddy. This little scrap of lace and thread cost 200 cents. I tracked it to a store on Pont Street, but alas, it was a dead end.
But I like your enthusiasm. HAVOC needs more strong, capable, fighting women. Honestly, more of me. Ladies, in five minutes we'll have this room for our NOV8 destruction party. So... Can't you see we're using it?
HAVOC needs more strong, capable, fighting women. Honestly, more of me. Ladies, in five minutes we'll have this room for our NOV8 destruction party. So... Can't you see we're using it? Yes, but I've reserved it for Carson Lazarus.
The movie was on TV a few days ago. Please, do me a favor and find this movie for me. Because I am curious. I want to know who the traitor was. Don't worry, I'll find him.
The bite on your neck. What? I gave you a dose of the original HZN1 vaccine. It counteracts his bite and frees us from Murphy's control. I'll take it too.
-Show it to me. -Yes. -Should it flash like that? -We don't have much time. We have to empty it right away.
- Can I go now? - Unfortunately not. We want to run a few more tests, and unfortunately your MRI was flawed. - What does that mean? - Well, the thing is... If the scan was correct, you'd have a hard time talking to me. But we'll just repeat it.
014 must be protected. He wrote a hacker code that a faction wants in the future. What faction? A group that wants to use my code to overthrow the director. - I'll hide it here. It's useless.
- She's the director's favorite. - Only when you're not around. - How is my code supposed to save a life? - You'll see. And don't worry, I'll destroy it as soon as I'm done.
- How is my code going to save a life? - You'll see. And don't worry, I'll destroy it as soon as I'm done. You need it now? You need it now?
You, the day in my night are You, the friend of my soul are You, the blanket in my winter are - commander, a record attempt. - He also breaks it.
We'll only get home if we take the wheel! With my intellect and your stature, what can go wrong? I hope this dish of wood chips, spray and my spit feeds you. I know who's gonna get the porridge trophy! Oh, man, I thought I was gonna get it this time.
A trophy? Oh, yeah. I hear it's a million times better than all the other trophies combined. Really? How do we get it?
Or? There is a way. Maurice, what are we looking for? For years, the laws of the King Juliens have been written down in books. If there is a way, we'll find it here.
These citizens here have had enough. That's true. They've had enough of being safe? Strange to want less of that. Maurice, I hear you, if you want me to give up my scorpion, you'll have to pry it from my cold, dead claws!
Holy shit. -He's been dead for hours. Let's get them out. Check his pockets for the key. -I got it. -Ok.
- On what subject? - Ask something to the stone, alien boy! God, all the time you let the prince hang out and just stand around and ask stupid questions and get the simplest things wrong! Is the stone dangerous? Yes, very dangerous, if you hold it too long, your brain melts, our chemistry can...
- All right. - In our new minivan. Hey, what's for lunch? - You bought a minivan? - It's for the baby, and I didn't buy it.
- In our new minivan. Hey, what's for lunch? - You bought a minivan? - It's for the baby, and I didn't buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive.
And here comes the mimosa. I once left orange juice in the fridge long enough that it tasted like mimosa. - How old was it? - Hard to say. I couldn't remember much after drinking it.
- Ms. Luthor. - Lena, please. - Nice to see you again, Ms. Danvers. - If I call you Lena... Kara it is. If you have a parking permit, I can stamp it.
I knew you would do well, but after hearing your sentimental views, I was afraid you would rip me off. Oh, I tried to. I really did. I wrote a scathing article about your device. - And? - My boss found fault with it.
Oh, I tried that. I really did. I wrote a scathing article about your device. - And? - My boss found fault with it. - I had to rewrite it.
I ordered the double breakfast and he stole me some bacon. If you want more details, you can go suck a dick. Wait here. Do you remember the movie? I loved it when I was a teenager.
Is there something you want to talk about? Can you tell me your name? What is this? Is that your TV? Turn it off.
Can you tell me your name? What is this? Is that your TV? Turn it off. Turn it off.
You are my scientist now. This mission is ours. Not Hammond, not Garnett, not the CDC. For some cosmic reason, we survived. And I claim it.
Standing in the driveway. - I'm thinking of something classy.... - I get it. I've sketched this out a dozen times. My name is Jim, Uncle Jim, I have an act so sensational you should book it right away, it's my....
Comedy trio? I'm a solo act. We're not gonna take your stupid check, okay? Okay. We don't want it.
Love shack, baby I'm driving down Atlanta Highway - What do you think? - That was really great. You're great. My fan, Patrice, requested it.
That's a good one! She's really funny! But seriously now. I have to give April the ring now. -No, you gave it to me.
Cynthia, look! My toque box. - What's that? Want some? No, thanks. - You know, Maestro Rivera took it away from me.
My Toque Box. - What's that? Want some? No, thanks. - You know, Maestro Rivera took it away from me. He took it away from me and locked it up with all my stuff.
And you and Matteusz live happily ever after. You are mistaken. I'll die either way. - What? - If I use it, I'll really be lost.
However, there are only provincial police officers there. You want to leave right away? - Why shouldn't I? Here's a letter for you. I found it among Miss Bai's things.
- Why shouldn't I do that? Here is a letter for you. I found it among Miss Bai's things. I'm sorry. It was without an envelope, I read it.
Did you find my social security check? My granddaughter called you last week. No, ma'am. I'm sorry. We haven't found it yet.
But we also know how upset you get -when it comes to yogurt. -about yogurt. Because it's great. -Exactly. -I love it.
Because it's great. -Exactly. -I love him. -We know. -I love him.
-Yes. -Or? -Your favorite water bouncer. -Yes. It took us hours to find it again.
I thought Walt gave you the day off. He did. I just didn't know what to do with myself. I just talked to the state police. There's no sign of the truck, so I guess they dumped it and put Eddie in another vehicle.
So he left me two years ago. Was there really a letter four months ago? Yes. I swear to you. I had it.
That's just because Anson Hamilton is a bad poet. No. No, it's not that. You're mispronouncing one of the words. This district... we call it Absaroka.
- You know, I should have bought beer. I'm so sorry. I just... This is perfect. Let me just... Let me take your... hat, and I'll put the... here, and if you want to take off your coat, I'll hang it up.
The air, the updraft. It lifts you up and carries you up into the sky. I thought you'd sleep through the whole flight. Sleep is a luxury. Treat yourself to it wherever you can.
It is more hostile to life... DIRECTOR, HAYDEN PLANETARIUM ...than any place on Earth. The hottest you can measure on Mars is zero degrees Celsius. AUTHOR, "THE MARSIAN" That's at noon in the summer at the equator. But at night, it goes down to minus 100 °C. There's a fundamental problem that we're dealing with in a Mars mission that we never had in the Apollo program. And that is the human body and how we protect it for long periods of time in space and on the planet.
Why? Everything covered with dust. Let's see if it's coming from here. Javier, are you okay? I'm fine. I'm very well. Robert... When you open a shutter, close it again.
Of course it means something to me. Now we have to be strong. Make a statement that says, "We're staying." You're not going to influence my recommendation to the committee. We're already too far along, Joon. If the train derails, there's nothing I can do to keep it on the track.
The second cufflink remained missing. Robert spent a lot of time and money searching. A good fifty years, to be exact. But on the evening of May 30, 1922, just after the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial, Robert Lincoln, who was by now in his late 70s, was approached by a certain Theodore Kipling. This Theodore Kipling was an usher at Ford's Theater when the President was shot. He claimed to have found the button at the time and was willing to give it to Robert Lincoln.
I tried to be polite when your protégé accused me of not doing my job with Leonard Bailey. But I'm not going to let someone who harbored a fraud tell me what a bad lawyer I am. I don't think you're a bad lawyer, Georgina. I think you're a good lawyer who made a mistake. And I'm here to give you an opportunity to make it right.
- What do you mean, no? - No. They're already after our money. I don't want to do anything that could jeopardize Jill's deal. Listen to me. The deal is ironclad. I wrote it myself.
- No. They're already after our money. I don't want to do anything that could jeopardize Jill's deal. Listen to me. The deal is ironclad. I wrote it myself. They can't take it away from her any more than they can take away my deal.
The guy was a murderous piece of shit who should have been behind bars for life, and now you're trying to get him out? He's in there with Mike Ross. I don't care. I do, though, because like you just said, he's a murderous piece of shit. But what you don't know is, I made a deal with him, and I'm not gonna break it.
I don't think you understand. I'm not doing this just to stay alive. I'm doing this so that one day I can knock on my children's door and they will know that their father is an innocent man. If I take this deal, it will never happen. If you don't take it, it may not happen either.
He asked me what I think. I'm not going to lie to him. I never thought Robert Zane's daughter would be so naive. Naive? I had actually started to think that you would care about the case, but all you care about is getting it over with as quickly as possible.
Do you see what I am dealing with? I have merely been attending these meetings because I am being pressured to attend these meetings. I understand. This asshole wants your job. He doesn't just want it.
I merely attended these meetings because I am pressured to attend these meetings. I understand. This asshole wants your job. He doesn't just want it. If I don't let you go, he'll get it.
Without help, you will not be able to get back up. Please, take my hand. I appreciate your offer more than you know, Robert. But I've had my name first long enough. I can't have it in last place again.
Please, take my hand. I appreciate your offer more than you know, Robert. But I've had my name first long enough. I can't have it last again. Jessica, if you don't do this, you won't have him anywhere.
Only the men who are into them. Don't worry, Tina. And we'll never leave you, baby. But now that you mention it, I actually have a plan. And everyone will love it, because it's a vast improvement on my opponent's baseless wall nonsense.
Mike. One of my classmates mentioned it to me in front of the whole class to win a negotiation. And the only thing you want to... you want to rub her nose in is your fist? Something like that. So the professor offered me an Innocence Project case, and I want to take it, but if I do that....
This is your new job. From now on, you're on kitchen duty with him. I catch you imitating the warden, you're going to solitary. I didn't ask for kitchen duty. Maybe not, but I think I know who assigned it to you.
Do you remember my case of the Innocent Project? How could I forget? Tough Rachel. Thanks. I took it, but now they say it wouldn't be suitable.
To which he has no right whatsoever. I do have the right to ensure that your client is working legally. And what exactly is your basis for saying that he wasn't? Your Honor, if you break the home run record, and somebody says your bat is corked. Then you hand it over to show that it's not.
I very much have the right to ensure that your client is operating lawfully. And what exactly is your basis for saying that he wasn't? Your Honor, if you break the home run record, and somebody says your bat is screwed up. Then you hand it over to show that it isn't. Unless that bat is the reason for all your home runs hit, because once he gets it, everyone on the planet will know what's inside.
What will happen is, by then we'll be back on track, so instead of blaming me for the situation Sutter put you in, I suggest you go ahead and figure out a way out of there. Rachel, what can I do for you? I was hoping that you would do something for Leonard Bailey. I have drafted a motion to reopen your case, but I need a current member of the bar to file it.
Bullshit. I don't think so, Sean, because you don't get somebody out of prison just to advance their career. This means something to you. I don't need to know what, but it means something to me, too, so, let's just admit we're in cahoots and get this thing over with. Take this garbage and throw it away.
But really, I was just the biggest jerk in the world for letting that bastard set me up, and I'll regret it for the rest of my life. What if you could get one over on him? What do you mean? You said yourself they offered you a deal. I bet they'd still take it.
Let's hear it. She filed for a name change in New Jersey in 2008. What's her new name? That's the problem. Carter couldn't figure it out.
She applied for a name change in New Jersey in 2008. What is her new name? That's the problem. Carter couldn't find it out. The only reason he couldn't find out it is if the state had access to those records
Drug addict or not, Maria Gomez never had the opportunity to be heard. If you'll excuse me, I have to go to my office. I'm not going anywhere! Not until you understand that if you had any sympathy for me, that you would not have taken this case in the first place instead of using it to make your mark.
As for the SEC, Mike has directly led this witness through which this shithead will be locked away for the rest of his miserable life. You have a small window of opportunity to reveal yourself to the SEC and save yourself. I would never go against my own father. I didn't take the deal for that son of a bitch. I took it for my wife.
If you lose this case, it's a knockdown. Jessica, the guy is guilty. And you're his goddamn lawyer. And you took this case. I never would have taken it if it wasn't to get Mike out.
Jessica, the guy is guilty. And you're his goddamn lawyer. And you took this case. I never would have taken it if it wasn't to get Mike out. But you took it.
Mike, sit down. I need to talk to you. You should have talked to me yesterday when Cahill decided to blow my deal. He said it was because of the people above him. And I wasn't gonna tell you about it until I figured out a way to get him back.
I want you to convince yourself that it doesn't get any better than this. She has a golden opportunity to get immunity if she stands up to her father right now. How do you even know this Cahill guy's gonna do it? Because I know how badly he wants Sutter, and offering Jill a deal is the best way to make that happen. Or he promises her a deal and then blows it.
But it also says that you acknowledge that I led them to you. Then I better take it to my office and sign it. Oh, and for the record, I had no intention of weaseling out of your deal. I did everything possible to keep it.
All is well with the money. - I'm just missing out on a little ride. - You don't... You don't have a car? Driver's license. When I came back from my last assignment, I just didn't renew it.
And I felt a connection to her from the very first moment I was invited to audition. Original casting session from June 2015 I am the protective roof over every head. I am the spear of battle! I am both the tree and the lightning that strikes it.
Every day at the same time, Agent Elizabeth Albi brings a hard drive here with updated data. I steal her ID card. Then I clone it and put a fake identity over it. Then you take this thumb drive... -Plug it into the server...
Especially yours. You're getting stronger. It's like riding a choppy wave. Did you bring the other magnet to Yo-Yo? Yes, she has it.
Why have you called us together if only you are allowed to speak here? The mayor has the floor. Wait your turn. Look, in the beginning we agreed on a business plan, but now who is suddenly vehemently opposed to it? After eight years of working on this development plan, who overturns it in a single day, who?
- Chinese characters. It says, "Receive the Mandate of Heaven and with it comes longevity and prosperity." Assuming he had gotten his hands on the genuine article, Rey was right. The green stone is worth a fortune. In fact, the Emperor of China once traded it for 15 cities.
- We need help. - Who is going to help us? On the way here, we passed a radio tower. Okay. One of us needs to go back, find it, and contact Citizen Z or Warren.
Eva! Did you read my text message? -I left the sweater at your place. -I'll have a look. I'd rather pick it up myself, because I know what it looks like.
Did you read my text message? -I left the sweater at your place. -I'll go check. I'd rather pick it up myself because I know what it looks like. Can't you just describe it?
-What is it? I can't stand this stuff. What happened? She wanted us to feel each other in a dark room. If you touched a dick, you had to suck it.
I've expanded the area a little bit, but I don't think we're going to find anyone who saw anything. The fire department didn't send a squad car here to a vehicle fire. So no one saw him torch the car. It was raining the night of the murder. Probably not a lot of tire tracks here if he left it after he shot Kenneth Tolan.
It caught my eye because it was so serious. I asked, "Who was that? A monster?" Outside, I saw two young people. They were comforting each other with an emotionality that was inappropriate at that moment. Be sure to photograph the body bag when they bring it out.
Wait a minute. Here's a... Here's a good one. "Junkie died of an overdose. His friends are sad, but they still need something. So they cut off his head and tried to sell it to Satanists for 30 bucks.
The third is the door to his apartment. If I don't care about noise, I use a bump key. What is a bump key? I have a set. They are milled to the deepest notch at each pin position The key goes in all the way to the last tooth, then you "punch" it all the way in.
- He killed them all. - They cannot stop us. They cannot stop what we are turning into. This planet is being destroyed by mankind, who lives only to suck the life out of it. Like parasites. Only we can save it.
There was never room for you, and that's my fault. And I'm so sorry for that. You didn't do anything wrong. And I know that's not the same thing at all, but I know what it feels like to hide a part of yourself. To keep it to yourself.
- You have to come with me. - Not until we've sucked him dry. I'm sorry, but Mr. O'Reilly is not on the menu today. This planet doesn't take parasites well. This planet is dying, and we were chosen to save it.
Are you sure? Since the day I found out the truth about Clark Kent, I've been ready. This is who I really am. I can't hide behind my camera anymore. If there's a price to pay, I'll pay it.
Unconditional love. It is on the other side of the door. But you look through them. Like you don't deserve it. I have a sledgehammer in my pocket. I lift it up and drop it.
But I'm making their movie. Oh, yeah? With whose money? - Yours. Thanks to your blank check. I'll cash it. Unless, of course, I can't trust you.
This could have been sent by anyone in the company. I can't get along with the computer. As soon as I do nothing, it goes off. The screen switches to stand-by. It does not turn on when I turn it on.
I can't get along with the computer. As soon as I do nothing, it goes off. The screen switches to stand-by. It doesn't turn on when I turn it on. You don't turn it on, you turn it off.
The sun can be fierce. Carry on. Would you put some clothes on, please? I am dressed. Get your narrow butt up and cover it.
-An order to do what? I was supposed to send him to another department. So you were ordered from above that Hans Peter should go broke? I tried to explain his case to my boss. I fought for him.
No one must know about it. Deal? -Agreed. The recipient for the wiretap? You will deliver it to a certain person.
Deal? -Agreed. The recipient for the wiretap? You will deliver it to a certain person. Who gets it?
Lucy. That was awesome. Did you see that? Where did you get that truck? I took it off The Man.
- Please answer. He wanted to know if... It was about the film I had given Joe. And? He wanted to know if I had seen it.
He wanted to know if I had seen him. And? Am I under arrest now? - Answer the question. Yes, I have seen him.
- Aha. You quickly learn that you are part of an opinion, a taste, so we created systems and had the baristas in our stores rate the same coffees. That way we could blindly judge how.... Aha, so that's seven.... 17 people say this coffee is terrible. And I thought it was great.
You are not their brother. No matter what they call you. If you're looking for family, you've got Jules and me. Fine. But take your share. I don't need it.
Blackstone just comes out the door like the guy gave him a sign. - That's why I punched him in the chest. - So you killed him? I'm sure it was a fatal hit. I brought you this flash drive if you still want it.
It is a system that allows us to turn low voltages into high voltages. Yes. That's what I wanted to hear. Nikola Tesla gave the transformer its name. The Serbo-American invented it in 1891.
I think what we're talking about here is personal responsibility. Have you talked about men gawking? Can you see my look? Yes. Yeah, I see him.
I have already listened. Now I am talking. My heart has been stomped on, too. And I don't have kids, but I'm pretty good with them. And my job kills me every day, but, like you, I love it.
If you work for state security.... Or what is it called here? For the border guards! Then you open the door: "There you are!" And I thought to myself, there must be a better way to get to England. And I think I found it.
They forgot about it. I'd deduct a star. I'll build one. I'll build a car scale and you'll see. This could have been a useful and interesting car test, but you ruined it.
I'll get the forms. There can't be many. The time has come when you no longer want to be an idiot. Then you've done enough. - Yeah, right. You go to a department store, to the kitchen utensils, you see a tea cosy, but you don't put it on your head.
Do you actually know how hard it is to put a V8 in a buggy? It's impossible. - It doesn't fit. It's not a normal V8. It used to be a 3.5-liter V8 from the Range Rover. But I rebuilt it, and now it has 180 hp.
Bravo! Oh, God... He's still moving. After many more miles, we took a break to recover from the bumping. James was very entertaining. The good thing about the hat is that you can adjust it depending on how the sun is shining.
- Someone stabbed the dog. - Is it yours? - Yes. I just moved the carcass. Why bury it? The cattle would have eaten him.
No. My parents were blown away, but not me. With the violin in my hand, I had the feeling of finding an old friend again. We all have a part we don't know anyway. And all of a sudden you get to know him and say to yourself....
What kind of tone is that? Well, it's okay with me. - To us. - Thank you. Shall we make a toast? To Howard and Bernadette and to the house key they never wanted back. - You said you had it back!
Beerios. What do you think about Billy's truck? Dirt slinger. Yeah, right? We should buy it.
If you want the car, you can have it without me. What? Okay, look... you know I love this truck. My brother, not so much, so you're gonna have to do something about the price. Dude, I don't want it for free, either.
This is the hammer! We're buying this truck! Yeah, boy! Go on! Yeah, get it dirty!
There you go. Way to break up with the fantasy girlfriend. Hey, Dad, did you see the storm? Looks pretty bad. Of course I saw it.
Maybe we are cursed. When we first met, you broke my nose in the fourth grade. Remember that? Sure I do. The ball bounced off your face, then Dennis Harvey caught it, and I was out.
Now I see why it bothers you. And I see why you enjoy it. The fence is in the barn. Barn? Didn't you put it up?
And in a perfect world with both. Did you put up the snow fence? Did you say "put up"? We thought you meant "put down." We also put the trough where you wanted it.
I don't want you to turn your life upside down for me, only to realize at some point, it was a huge mistake. It's not a mistake. I just want you. And you can keep the TV. Put it in the guest room, you can watch Dangerous Axe Man.
Honey, I'm so proud of you. That's a smart move. I'm not doing it. You're an idiot. Yeah, Mary thinks I should take it, too.
I think your dad really believes in what he says, but in the end he'll do it again like he always does. Remember that John Wayne DVD collection at Christmas? He used them as props for his John Wayne video collection. Like when we got him his first PC. First it sat in the box for six months, then he put the typewriter on it. Think about the job with Ed, don't turn it down just because your father made vague promises to you.
How do you come up with "ours"? That's the plan, isn't it? Dad retreats and we take over. Dad wouldn't back down from a wild bull. He'd stare at him, twirl his beard:
Babies are basically like drunks, babbling incomprehensibly, crying until they get the bottle, and shitting themselves. And thank you... I forgot your name. It's... Umberto. It's easy for you to remember, it's like...
Why? You saw that these people were safe for the first time in years. Maybe for the first time ever. They made the original vaccine for a reason. I was chosen to receive it for a reason.
The control of a human being. The power of a Z. That is me. That is my legacy. I need to do more boosters for me and more of the vaccine for them to finish the plan, to bring it to completion.
Who was there? That's what I've gathered so far. Aaron is on the list. I had to write down everyone who had security clearance and knew about the file. Emily, I think we have a traitor in the White House. I need you to help me find him.
Watch out. Come in, Cassia. - Ezequiel. - Oh, it's you. The next test is about to begin. Can I watch it with you?
Your birthday present. - You already gave me a present. - It's not from me. When your parents entrusted you to me, they gave me this letter. I was supposed to give it to you on your 20th birthday.
And let me continue, nothing like this will ever happen again. Tell that to the council. Do you have any more? But a ring. Do you want it?
Do you have any more? But a ring. Do you want it? It's a magic ring. Do you want it?
Do you know what's inside him? What? All your mother's memories. Really? But you can only have him on the other side.
Can you tell us what you meant by that? It could mean nothing. But I saw that he was murdered. And you know how it's always on the news, see something, say something. He always had a laptop with him, but he never used it here.
It could mean nothing. But I saw that he was murdered. And you know how it's always on the news, see something, say something. He always had a laptop with him, but he never used it here. After he ate, he took it out to the parking lot.
But I just like you. I get angry and then... Boom. I just explode. The explosive device was triggered by a modified cell phone. It could have been activated from anywhere with a text message.
-No. -That's not just obsession.... -But they should know. This is revenge. Don't you realize that? Forty years ago, he had Regan's body and lost it.
I thought you had it easier that I had to live through it and you just watched, but.... Now I don't know. Watching and waiting seems almost as bad. Because you see their pain. And there's nothing you can do to take it away from her.
What happened in that room, I don't remember. ...for your child to be reborn. Help me. Mother Bernadette! Forty years ago, he had Regan's body and lost it.
- Not yet. - Just kill me. Just kill me. Come on. Most men fight death, but not you. You want him.
We were loyal and perfect in every way, and do you know what God did? God got bored. He was bored by our perfection, and that's when He created man. Mortal and ugly and.... And then he built them a sandbox. And he filled it with tactile and sensual pleasures.
-They must see you. A new emperor must be in Rome. I promised father to end the war. The generals know this and will use it against me. Then end it.
The Minetta Chess Club Murder. Greenwich Village, 1938. The table came from the crime scene. It took me... It took me a few years to track him down.
No, it's good that way too. Because I've been making very slow progress, so.... This will force me to look at the case from a different angle. It's even a more fitting gift than you intended, because I destroyed evidence for you and now.... I would offer to let him in on it with you, but I have to go.
It was dark, it happened quickly. I think... I was staring at the gun more than the guy. According to the ER report, they also removed car glass from your shoulder? Yeah, car window broke when he shot me, there was.... glass everywhere. And the police were looking for the car after that, but they couldn't find it.
That's all I can say about it. I saw the plane fly into the building. That changed everything. From this day forward... any nation that harbors terrorists is considered an enemy regime by the United States. The only way to defeat terrorism that threatens our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it originates.
And I say, "We have to secure a block." PEACE BROTHER - B.W. The Muslims took L-6 and had control. The Aryan Brotherhood went into L-2. That was our block. We took it over.
- ...to discuss everything. Basket, blower, balloon and burner. That one goes first. - This is a modern burner. - Today's state of the art. The liquid propellant is pumped out of the tank and vaporized in these coils before we feed it through this jet ring past this pilot flame.
- Shall we both ignite? - No. But that's not all. To fill a hot air balloon, you can't just blow hot air into it, can you? You fill it with cold air first, using this special blower.
Now I know how to balloon. Now comes the real challenge. To freedom! The replica of the balloon with the same dimensions and materials as the original. This is the balloon from back then. And what's even better, I'm talking to one of the men who built it.
Incredible that you were able to build a hot air balloon, but even crazier that you had no idea about it, right? Absolutely not. I had totally underestimated the work, too. I guess we're in the same boat. Or basket. If you build it, they're free.
And their own brand of burner. But with their 4,000 cubic meters of capacity, they needed an industrial-sized blower for the gigantic envelope. Look what I have here. It was Günter Wetzel who took the pen during the escape. I removed the engine from my motorcycle, rebuilt it, and that became the blower.
El Chapo's escape was meticulously planned, but when it comes to escapes, people in Latin America like to just say "no" to months of planning and "yes" to just going for it. Example number one: Maria. She's on her way to visit her husband Juan in Mexico's Chetumal prison. As she leaves, the guard notices that her trolley seems a little swollen. - No. - They open it.
And this is where his plan goes awry. A classic case of a wardrobe malfunction. And although this escape attempt failed... I'm all woman. ...you have to classify it among the greatest escape attempts of all time.
A little of both. He was crazy, because he had the idea of putting a pigeon in a rocket.... DR. AARON BLAISDELL ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGIST ...so it could guide it to a ship and blow it up. Putting a pigeon in a bomb is crazy and immoral. But theoretically, it could have worked. One pigeon pecks at the ball coming toward it and pushes it toward the other.
I'll have to see for myself. Let's go. Soldier pigeon during training. No pigeons will be hurt while filming White Rabbit Project. First you have to get the bird used to the crate, acclimatize it by putting it in the crate, giving it something to eat, and they associate the crate with food, so it's a nice place.
It was considered a stamp of value. You went to the post office, got a stamp, and then you in turn could send a letter to the USA. Carlo quickly realized that you didn't just get stamps for the coupons. You could also sell them. He could buy a coupon in Italy for about $1. He sent it to the U.S. and sold it for about $6.
The explanation is much more diabolical. It is the opening move of a group of cyber criminals called the Carbanak Gang. This wasn't a passerby getting lucky. This is a courier. The Carbanak gang controls the vending machines remotely and had him spit out money at a predetermined time.
A lot of sophisticated technology is used. The ink has to withstand a lot: It is vaporized, and shot out at 50 oc? Through a nozzle 1/3 the diameter of a human hair, at 150 oc 150 oc? That gives me an idea. Instead of filling this printer with ink, I'm going to fill it with three dyed incendiary accelerants.
The flight around the Statue of Liberty was not a trick. It was 100% real. For 50 years, everyone has been asking, "Where's my rocket pack?" I think the day has come so close that we can almost touch it.
Hashtag "Selfie Saturday"! Brilliant. We were promised rocket backpacks. We were given the selfie stick. The big question is, what was the original selfie stick, who invented it and when?
And the patent is from 1985, which was 20 years earlier. It was the work of this man, Hiroshi Ueda. An amateur photographer who worked as an engineer for the Minolta camera company. He invented it after asking someone to take a picture of him in front of the Louvre.
AC/DC. Metal, baby! Cahill's dream was to create an electronic music machine that could produce the sound of an entire orchestra, with enough resonance to fill a room with sound through a small telephone speaker. He experimented with gears and magnets. If you turn this sprocket with all the teeth... and you take an electric pickup and hold it close to it.... ...you get... a sound.
We use alen, the Somali substitute plant for tea. It is fibrous and turns the water brown, but I am sure it is not related to the tea plant. Put some sugar in it. Find a chair outside. The guards used it overnight.
I never talk business on an empty stomach. Keep talking. We need the birthstone. The birthstone of Gunmar. A powerful stone. Why should I give it to you?
A mighty stone. Why should I give it to you? Because we're destroying Gunmar. And why should I care? Why should I give it to you of all people?
-Why won't this thing open a portal? -Not so impatient. You must learn to unleash the power of the staff. Penetrate it with your will.
-Which one is the little one? -Hard to tell, huh? They are true fighting machines and trained to kill. Very encouraging. Go get him!
Stay at the Gorb! Aaarrrgghh! -Cool. -A warrior's shield! You've earned it.
Aaarrrgghh! -Cool. -A warrior's shield! You've earned it. Now put it to the test!
Gunmar deceived him to take over his army. The battle lasted for weeks. Gunmar lost an eye, Orlagk lost his head. This is the hardest stone to find. His servants had trouble stealing it from the Krubera. They won't let us have it so easily.
Barbara, you have to get out of here. It's... -The basement! -What's in the cellar? Draal was supposed to be guarding it.
- Fuck you! That's nice. You're taking their side? Why don't you just go to New York and rework the film? The post-production company has it.
Your pancakes too, Herman. They're driving me crazy! That's not so hard, Ernie, but thank you. I'll take that cookie with me. I love it.
They're driving me crazy! It's not that hard, Ernie, but thank you. I'll take this cookie with me. I love him. Why don't you marry him?
Kill us a nice fat snake. I'm game. Snake meat's a good thing. But no ants for me. Well, to each his own. When you're done, chew the blossoms to a pulp and rub rubber on the wound.
You know what's happening to us now, right? Yes. Now it's our turn. Demidow? You requested the autopsy report. - I'm not allowed to give it to you.
Crap. What's that? Just now my earring rolled behind the washing machine. That's annoying, honey. I'll look for it.
If that's all we have left, let's go. Everyone gets a GPS tracking device. So we'll know where you are at all times in case something goes wrong. What am I supposed to do with this? Put it in your pocket.
The Blob. The original with Steve McQueen. I can't believe you haven't seen this movie. Come see it sometime. I have it on LaserDisc.
I was your best friend. Then you turned your back on me. You kept me trapped between the pages of a book. You let me gather dust on a bookshelf for years. The key was here. But you never used it.
It drips... It's been dripping for two weeks. The refrigerator is dripping... Stop repeating what I say so I think you're listening. The refrigerator is dripping, I didn't notice. Just fix it!
Listen, I should go. I'm going now. No, wait. I have a letter. Send it by mail.
I hope you don't mind the music. When you're all alone, you often can't stand silence. Do you like your computer? I'm not that familiar with it, but the man at the store said it was the right one. - I haven't turned it on yet.
- Gilcrest. - Did you do it? Has the hacker been eliminated? I'm picking up the panic code. I'm pinging it through the first transponder and out of the system.
I can see that. So, I think whatever happens, it will be much better than this. (SOLDIERS CONVERSE IN SOME DISTANCE) A lot of us have lost our lives to get to this. One thing you have to know, Kyle, if there was another way, I would have taken it.
Alternative time lines are not complicated. It's just a question of how to interpret the possible coincidences using an exponential growth and decay algorithm. KYLE: Right. There's a switch, and I'll find it.
There's a storm coming in off the starboard bow, sir. We need to take down sail immediately. Not just yet, Mr. Chase. Sir, we're sailing at over 8 knots into a storm that's going even faster. Let it come.
And so it was decided. We set to work on the corpse. We removed the organs, separated the limbs from the body, and then we closed and sewed up the corpse. As best we could. And we handed him over to the sea.
Captain Pollard's conscience was clear. The investigation, however, was nothing but a hoax. Pollard went out again and looked for the white whale. Never found him.
When you find the next Bon Jovi, give me a call, okay? Good luck. - Thanks for coming. - Yeah, of course. Do that shit, do it
Good luck. - Thanks for coming. - Yeah, of course. Do the shit, do the shit Do the shit, do the shit
Do the shit, do it Do the shit Do the shit, do it Say, "Do the shit! Do that shit! Do him!"
Fuck it, Jerry. That's what the song is about. Relax. We're not backing down. I'm just saying we'll let it out for now, okay?
You took off your wedding ring on the way here? No, I didn't! Rusty, it was loose! You know how loose it was. And now I must have lost it somewhere.
It was not my plan. Okay. Yes, Stone is an impressive man, okay? But I married you. I'm sorry I lost the ring, but I would never, ever, ever just take it off.
We made a good profit. Just stick to shares. You know me. Me, me, me... I look for value wherever I can find it.
Nobody cares. People just want a house. They go with the flow. Their companies don't check it out? If I put in a mortgage application on Friday, a major bank will buy it on Monday.
I could not help. When I got him out of the car, he grabbed the door and we fought. He took a knife and tried to hit me. So I took my Colt. As soon as he saw it, he gave up and....
They thoroughly underestimated him. I'll hold you responsible for the next mistake. What are you doing? I want the owner of the car to know who borrowed it.
Excellent product, Sire. First-class quality. This is a, um, particularly robust stock. If markets remain stable and we harvest towards the end of the century, the profit margin should make your competition pale. To be clear, Mr. Night, I will harvest this planet tomorrow before I let her take it from me.
So you're the new guy? We've actually met before. But that was a long time ago. You see that cornerstone there? I saw them put it in when this was still a field.
No matter what the murderers would have wanted to know, he would have told them. But the question remains: What did they want to find out? - He won't wake up. - We have to break the curse. By killing the witch who cast it.
We may be engaged, but I have my own mind. Besides, I wouldn't wear my engagement ring. Remember? It was just stolen. And your fiancé would be off at the first ray of sunshine to replace it.
- Good morning. - SOLO: Morning. Your tracker's not giving us a signal. Did you turn it on?
Kathy and Kikki are at the market, and Ellis is jogging a lap. They have a bug in their hair. It's okay, just a ladybug. It's supposed to be a good luck charm. Do you have it?
Stepsisters want parasols and lace. What do you want? Bring me the first branch that brushes your shoulder. That's a strange wish. You always have him with you on the road. When you see him, you think of me.
What do you want? Bring me the first branch that brushes your shoulder. This is a strange wish. You always have it with you on the way. When you see it, you think of me. If you bring it to me, we will be reunited.
I saw Madison and you. OküY - you were in my special place. This is my thinking rock. You said I could use it.
And you cheat death. Go ahead, take off your clothes. I have an awkward, unattractive body. He's not unattractive. I have seen him.
Go ahead, take off your clothes. I have an awkward, unattractive body. He is not unattractive. I've seen it. You make him unattractive.
I just said it's not a good time right now. "I can't lose my mental balance now." He's only 16. The letter didn't go to you. I found it.
"I can't lose my mental balance now." He's only 16. The letter didn't go to you. I found it. He left it lying around.
What are you doing? What the hell? Shit! Carter, get the tire! I got him.
When I'm nervous. You make me nervous. - Oh, yeah? Why? - Because I'm on the case. Ghazala. Morales assigned it to me.
If I... A van was just found on Grand Street, totaled. Driver is a fugitive. Smell of bleach inside. He was trying to move it.
Do you think I'm really suited for the academy? Definitely by the end of the summer. I have a plan. - (Clock beeps) - Oh. On the second. I call it your life plan.
- In the gym. At the Gym? - Wills at 156th Street. Who gave you the job? - I got it myself.
And that's why I... I have to destroy your dreams and break you as a human being. I don't understand. This essay is a masterpiece, Ned. It should be framed and displayed in a museum of great essays.
His dad always forced Ned to play on the team. When he was trying to make a new Chaz Jr. out of him. So Ned's standing out there, far left field, last inning, last game. I'm on the mound throwing an easy ball. The guy swats it away hard as a rock.
And I looked over at the field and Ned was still standing there looking for his glasses. That's how it was. He didn't... He never had a chance. He didn't drop it.
- I didn't mean to. Sorry. - This guy's got class. - It's not getting any better... - Got it. I put a key in my mouth and turn it and lock it.
Deon, Tetravaal is happy with you. The scouts are a huge success. Ma'am, it's not going to cost you anything. A damaged droid was taken out yesterday. Let me use it.
I think that's it. Can you move it? Try to move your arm. - It's working. - I'm moving it.
- It's illegal! - I'll take him! No. - Chappie. Chappie, wait! - I'll take him!
What's a schoolboy like you doing out here, Lawrence? This "schoolboy" has a Ph.D. in archaeology. - Thompson, stop. My doctorate in medieval shards haunts me like an old maid's fart. I'd like to be rid of it.
That is unbelievable. He bypassed the hierarchy. When did Gallant write the letter? - 1984. Law ignored it.
I'm not launching a ground offensive just to scavenge weapons. Commander Paylor, your people suffered the most at the hands of the Capitol. No suicide mission. We can't get into the Capitol without taking District 2. What if we blockade the base instead of taking it?
Kill him! I'll say one thing for you, Katniss: you're always good for surprises. Plutarch gave me a letter for you. I don't want it.
You wish? - She has a button. She has a button. I saw you were looking online... Where did you get it?
She has a button. I saw you were looking online... Where did you get it? Say something about it. First you say who you got it from.
To save civilization, I show its collapse. But how is the vision received? How do people react to the impending end? They gobble it up like a chocolate eclair. They don't fear death, they market it.
We do not run. We take the train of thought. The train, sure. It's much faster. How do we get it?
You shoot around in the garden? That's dangerous as hell! - But they are back! - The fence helps a lot. They destroyed it.
Mary. Rose is sleeping now. Don't wake her until morning. Get the bodies out of Danny's house and into Michael's limo. Park the car where the cops can find it.
Didn't you say you didn't know him? Swindler. - What a slob. All I can say is, every time I quoted from it at a party, some drunken pussy would come up with, "Oh my God, I love that movie, I haven't seen it in forever."
- What a slasher. All I can say is, every time I quoted from it at a party, some drunken pussy would come up with, "Oh my God, I love that movie, I haven't seen it in forever." To which I said, "Oh my god, I have the DVD in my room." And she goes on, "We should watch it."
I said, "My God, I have the DVD in my room." And she continued, "We should watch it." It was as easy as snatching a pacifier from a baby. You disgust me. - Oh, come on, you watched it too.
We don't know, sir. What? This is a major disaster! His message must not reach the Gorgs. The planet was hard to find, and I'm not leaving!
No wonder they chased you. Not "they," "he." Apparently, the Gorg is the last Gorg. That's why the stone was so important. Without it, he was lonely and would have died out one day. That made him moody and irrational and aggressive.
Let's tiptoe. Could you stop playing that piano? We're gonna get caught. Sorry. Now reach over and grab it.
Activation in three, two, one. That's it, guys. It doesn't look good for you guys. And I'm keeping the bear. Where you're going, you won't need him...
That's just the way I am. When you said "negotiate," what did you mean? I have prepared a contract. It's quite detailed. You'll look at it, and we'll negotiate what you're willing to do and what you're not.
I NEED IT! No, no! I can arrange it. She's in a meeting right now. Hi. Is there anything I can do to help? Jules spilled soy sauce on her Saint Laurent blazer. Can you take it to the photo studio? They have detergent and stuff.
Hi. Is there anything I can do to help? Jules spilled soy sauce on her Saint Laurent blazer. Take it to the photo studio please, they have cleaning supplies and stuff. - Sure, where is it? - At the office, she's wearing it.
Does it all go to the cleaners? The 3 yes, they have to go to the wash, and, uh, this button, this button is gone. - I mean, it's loose, so... - Okay. - Maybe if they...
Trust me. Do you have the computer? It's not downstairs. Lewis, in there, Davis, there. - Found it! - Got it! - What?
Yes, of course. That means every year someone wins the Rose Lacey Trophy? Yes, every year. As long as the golf club exists. And ... she would be delighted if you presented it to the first winner.
Lane had a register. The identities of his operatives, his terrorist associates... The entire inner workings of the syndicate. One of his agents stole it to blackmail him... and put it in a computer safe for protection. He died during interrogation, and now Lane has a serious problem. The key to destroying Lane... is sitting in a computer, waiting for someone to come and get it.
With the identities of the agents, his terrorist partners.... the entire inner workings of the syndicate. One of his agents stole it to blackmail him... and put it in a computer safe for protection. He died during interrogation, and now Lane has a serious problem. The key to destroying Lane... ...is sitting in a computer, waiting for someone to come get it. Why hasn't Lane sent someone to steal it?
Do you know who I am? You created the syndicate. But Lane went rogue and turned against you. And you were desperate to cover it up. That's why you erased the flash drive when she delivered it.
I have a game for you. I'll give you... $50 million... to let Benji go. Where's the flash drive? Where's the flash drive? You're looking at it.
I don't like the name. I know, but why are you called that? Oh, my dad started it at some point. So? And I don't like it.
- I don't know. - What do you mean? - I don't know. - It doesn't make any sense. I didn't say it did. Wine is supposed to age with the years. But 450 years makes it bitter.
Please, may I... May I, uh... Come back here. The suit'll take the weight, right? I'll take the tank, fly it to the General's Palace, drop it at his feet.
Small and modest. Do you already live in Brooklyn? Way too expensive for me. Apartment is apartment. I fly to the General Palace, throw it at his feet and say,
He loads into the body. -Where? The real power is in the cradle. The stone... Its power is uncontrollable. It must not be destroyed.
The real power is in the Cradle. The stone... Its power is uncontrollable. It must not be destroyed. Take the cradle to Stark. Not until I find it.
The air is getting too thin. You go to the ferries. I'll look for stragglers and catch up. And the core? I protect him.
The animal was terribly battered. He had to kill it. What? How can you not tell something like that right away? You killed it...with what?
-Here, here. What the hell? Lights on! What the hell is that? -Open it.
One, three, four, five. -Go. -Moment, it's... It's pi. Go ahead, type it in.
Look at those eyes. I'm telling you... You're a star. (Davina) The boot's not too small. You didn't put it on me right!
Then your dreams are probably on hold for the moment. Or are they? That's a nice way of putting it. This song is performed in the musical. We sing it together.
Now it gets a little complicated. A clip connects the slider to the... I don't know what to call this. It's an attachment that connects to the mop head. If you pull up the slider, you cock the mop head... and you can wring it out without using your hands.
I think he's great. Do we buy it? Relax, Cristy. This is incredible. You don't have to touch it.
That is incredible. You don't have to touch it. Just look. It would be perfect if you could take the mop head off and put it in the washing machine. To clean it.
We don't take normal people. We sell stars or advertising ambassadors. I told you that. Who showed you the mop? Who sold it, demonstrated it?
With us, stars or advertising ambassadors sell. That's what I told you. Who showed you the mop? Who sold it, demonstrated it? Convinced you of its quality, even though you thought it was unsuitable?
You're still full of surprises. Good old Charlie Brown! Charlie Brown. Oh, Charlie Brown. I'll hold the football and you kick it.
Good old Charlie Brown! Charlie Brown. Oh, Charlie Brown. I'll hold the football and you kick it. That's what you say. In reality, you pull it away, I land on my back and die.
I don't know. She was in my house. I've never seen these things before. This box? I've never seen it before, Mike.
Go back! Go back to the circle! Where is he? Go back! I see him!
One team is on the field and plays defense while the other team in turn hits that ball. With a stick. What should the name of the game be? It's obvious. Stickie McSchnickens. The goal of the ball thrower is to throw the ball past me twice without hitting it.
It's obvious. Stickie McSchnickens. The goal of the ball thrower is to throw the ball past me twice without hitting it. Throw when you're ready. I didn't know you were gonna throw it that hard, ball thrower.
Come on, Ramon! I'm behind you, Tommy! Hurry up, Burro! Move your ass! I think we found him.
Burn them both alive. You want to get Buddy out? There's only one way. See that mountain? You blow it up to get the silver out.
You want to get Buddy out? There's only one way. See that mountain? They're blowing it to get the silver out. They're making tunnels and blowing it from the inside.
The problem is, I... I don't know how to spell your name. It's hard, Buddy. Most people can't. I'll write it down for you.
What's a job for, Buddy? What? For the family. Give me your wallet. Just give it to me.
Just give it to me. Remember this? Jakey's cut. From your first job. He kept it?
Jess didn't feel very safe. I bought her this backpack. It's an iSafe backpack. You can set off an alarm. But she... Didn't use it.
The best address when you are sick. My mother and sister told me about you. Although I didn't understand your title. "Baronet." Edith explained it to me.
She's just a child, Thomas. Lucille, I've explained everything. I need the ring. The ring is mine. I earned it.
Lucille, I have explained everything to you. I need the ring. The ring is mine. I earned it. I want it back.
I have earned him. I want it back. Then hope for my success. That's the last thing we need to sell. You're not selling him.
Then, if you still want some, I'll have some made for you. Come on, Edith. Let's go upstairs. I thought you said that dog was dead. I abandoned him.
Two of the guests get involved in the local country club. Where, however, let's say the cash register is low. Norman? I know membership is down, times are tough, but.... do you really need to pan the wine? - What? I uncorked it myself.
His ears are too close to his head. I was hoping you'd find his offer of partnership... ...more attractive. But that's up to you. Have you seen my second shoe? Because if you don't tell me what's going on, I'm gonna need it to kick you.
- It's slightly above average. Yes? Go on, stake out your property! Yes! Yeah, put it in!
- You don't hit a woman! - I'll give you a second asshole! - You don't hit a woman! (IN FEMALE VOICE) You don't want my sweetie? You don't want him? Yeah, so what now?
But there are a lot of them. JAMES: Yeah. There, there's the computer. I see it.
My God! I'm falling off the building. Your name is Toby! You'll learn to say your name. Let me hear it.
It runs perfectly. We'll be in New York before 10:00. Hey, Sam, how's your boring salad? It's actually quite tasty. That's what everyone always says about their salad, and they're all fucking liars. No, I like it.
Hey! Where's my coffee? I've been waiting 20 minutes. I'm very sorry, sir. I forgot it, coming right up.
Yes. Synne, did you want to say something? - Did you want to say something? - Yes. Not all the archives were taken out when the building was closed. The medical records were supposed to be destroyed or taken away. We just have time to find the shit, tag it, and get out.
Yes. You've always been a small thinker, Antoine. A derivative thinker at best. This desperation suits you. The key to everything... is in your head, and you're going to give it to me.
Yes, exactly. It's a rock band. I could write you a song if you want. You got a sexy ass I wanna lick it Lick my ass
- Don't waste your energy. - Helen. First chance you get, you go. You know the drill. We still have an oxygen supply at the South Col! - If you need it, you can have it!
But it's a long way to the top. I have a hat just like that. Yes. Sorry. No. You keep it.
I have. For a while. His first cowboy hat. That's so cute. He never took it off.
His first cowboy hat. That's so cute. He never took it off. Not when he ate, not when he slept. He wanted to tape it on so it wouldn't fall off.
Do you think he had an accident? We don't know. He just disappeared. He left a message on my answering machine a few weeks ago. I don't check it very often.
So concentrate! It's hard to concentrate when I have a boner. We'll have sex on the ninth of the month, as planned. Until then, you'll have to take care of yourself. Can I rub it between your butt cheeks?
Good night. - Of course. Good night. One second. You're certainly not the IT guy. You better start talking before I break this finger six times and stick it where the sun don't shine.
Dom! Come on, buddy. Is he breathing? Grab his head and stick it back. Hold him like this.
The doctor thinks it's better if you stay here. You need to rest. Four, seven, three. No, you're right. Give this letter to Fong. Tell him to give it to his dad.
The fur is not worth the cartridges. The alpha wolf! Stop, don't shoot! We need his fur without holes! We'll rush him.
Yes, Mom? Yes. Hey, don't bug me now, please. Yes, I will graduate. When I do.
- Yes. - Okay? Calm her down. Escort her to the ladies' room in case she needs to use the little girls' room. Yes, Captain, do we know if Mrs. Riva is menopausal? Yes, because I tracked her cycle and compared it to the lunar calendar.
- I don't see a footrest here. I just need relief for my upper body. - Push off! - Just a moment. First I pull my body up, then I push it through the window.
I would love to take my time because I want this to work. Me too. I'm very confused. You brought the ring and you wanted this dinner, so.... I was saving it for Barry.
- Hold on. Look what I found in the drawers. Why are you wearing Grandma's bathrobe? I was taking a shower and it was hanging there. Take it off, it bothers me.
Shouldn't have answered and stayed home. Yes, maybe. - Would have been better. That's enough. I'm not negotiating anymore. Here's the contract. Take it or leave it.
Here is your sheikh, asking permission to enter your tent. I came to bring you the burning desert, to impose my slippery will on you under the starry tropical sky. Send your camel to bed, damn you! My Sheikh, does this mean you have excommunicated this mustache of the Prophet? I'll give him a trim.
But... I realized... that my love for you... ...is greater. Go on. Would you really do that for me? For you... there's nothing I wouldn't do. Well, in that case, Mr Mortdecai... I'd be delighted... if you'd keep it.
Then you will feel it yourself in the end, the eternal final regret. Indelible. Does anything cause you grief? If so, erase it. If a tooth hurts you, tear it out. If a finger hurts you, cut it off.
You always have a choice. I was in the ring. I saw it. The fight should have been stopped. I should have stopped it.
I am not a cake... I bake them. Yes, I see the connection. Now you can wear a cake. How did you know I don't like traditional jewelry? I can't stop staring at it.... And he keeps staring back.
Anton is part of my security team! Oh yeah? I don't like his face. I don't like your face! And who the hell are you? The one who cuts off your dick and sticks it to your forehead like a unicorn.
He can help. I am fine. He can also decipher the key. This is the key of Lord Alcaman. It is one of the most powerful items in the world if you know how to use it.
You know, Drazen doesn't understand the plan. He thinks it's the village. Nothing else. You didn't tell him the exact location. Never make it up.
I hope you got the last message. I wanted to wish you a happy birthday. You know where we are. I remembered the code. Our three birthdays. We never changed it.
And this is perfect to try on now. Yes. - Your overseas suitcase is still in the way. Oh, well... Yeah, I'll put it away later.
Just stay away. So I'm the creep, right? Well, at least I'm honest. I'm stealing this stone. I'm not trying to steal it behind her back.
Because of Kjartan's fertilizer. Kjartan said the training ground was a formality, no one really uses it. Nobody? This man is unbelievable. Even if the club didn't need it, you can't mow there.
Now it's surveillance. God, what is she doing? She must have switched shifts. I need the amp. I need it.
- Get to work. - Yes. Oh, God! Okay, the first thing we need is alcohol. Lots of it. I'd buy it, but I make $300 a year.
- Are you going to take off your shirt? - No, not necessary. - I want to. - Why? I like your body. I want to see it.
It will snow soon. When it snows, the village is completely cut off. Everyone is at God's mercy. We depend on God here for eight months and on the government for four months. If you want to write a letter, write it now because the answer will come eight months later.
Great. Thank you. Ved, I'm sorry. I take back everything I said that night. Where's the ring? I want it.
I don't know what's wrong with me. Something is wrong. Something's wrong? Sir, this job is all I have. I don't want to lose it.
- No, I hate sports. - I know, it's a perfect fit. Bryson should write the article. Yes, I was supposed to. I pitched it. Yeah, and I'm giving it to Amy.
Amy, I really needed you there. You were my rock, you knew that. I can't take you seriously with this thing. Why did you bring the award out? You don't have to carry it around like you did at the Oscar party.
You were my rock, you knew that. I can't take you seriously with that thing. Why did you bring the award out? You don't have to carry it around like you did at the Oscar party. Will you put it away so I can...
That's great. Thank you, Amy. It means a lot to me. I can turn down the job if you want. Okay, yeah. Don't take it.
My client has a newborn to supervise and.... We have made a generous offer to settle the matter out of court.... Oh, yes. You sometimes use Pinkerton as your alias. You never understood the allusion. Madame Butterfly. Just because I don't applaud your intellect doesn't mean I don't notice it.
I hope you will make a personal dedication. Yes. Of course. Mr. Umezaki... How far away from the city does Szechuan pepper grow? It's mostly found near the sea.
When the time comes, we leave here. Understand? A letter from Japan. From Mr. Umezaki. Did you read it? - No.
No idea! And if I had known, I couldn't remember anyway. If you don't remember, you could have solved the case, like in Watson's story. Because it was my last case! If I had solved it, I wouldn't have given up my profession to live here, in this godforsaken place, for 35 years!
It was his way of doing someone a favor. He couldn't write any other way about the character he created. Even after all these years, John didn't really know me. Why he took the glove, I can only guess: He didn't want it to remind me of the painful incident and become a source of But he also didn't have the heart to destroy it.
- Uh, no, not yet, sir. But we took care of the girl. The video's been deleted. That takes you out of the line of fire. The video's just embarrassing. The flash drive is treason. Find it.
No. Is that Mount Basilé? Actually, it's a volcano. In Bubi it is called Owässa. The Nigerians called it Big Pico and the British Clarence Peak.
Now you too. You're out of ice. I put together a flyer. It's about how Congress doesn't seem to know the First Amendment. They know it, but they don't care about it.
And very soon all this will be long ago. Sleep here. Blanket? Thank you. I'll dream up some advice... and serve it tomorrow morning with fresh eggs.
Payne needs him alive. Your chance will come. Where's the river ? They took it. Who took it ?
- Skelly. What he says is bloodcurdling. What did he say? - "Tomorrow there will be a thousand." In the morning I go to the wanted poster to hang it up in the next town.
Other? 2000 dollars attracts an undesirable variety. What kind are you? Indians call this forest "place of spirit trees." Trappers call it "Silver Ghost."
Sorry. - That's all right. I don't really have turtles. - Okay. But I do have a beautiful iguana in the back. Would you like to see him?
Don't do that, be a good boy. Okay, okay. Good luck, Alfie nine. Hello, my darling! I don't know who previously held the land speed record, but my bus driver certainly just broke it.
Well, no woman wants a toaster for her birthday. - Can you fill it up? - Yes. And Abigail wasn't shy. - That was your mother? - Stepmother. So she puts the toaster in the middle of the table... and all the guests come to breakfast and see it.
And Abigail was not shy. - That was your mother? - Stepmom. So she puts the toaster in the middle of the table... and all the guests come to breakfast and see it. They weren't exactly thrilled. And every day someone would trip over the cord and pull it off the table.
You're not serious, but I don't have a job. I am serious. I'll have the bill brought to us. And I'll get my coat. I can't find it.
I am serious about this. I'll have the bill brought to us. And I'll get my coat. I can't find it. I never used it.
Let's have some fun somewhere. You got the fucking money for that? Can you fucking afford it? Open the money drawer. Open it.
Give me the key. Why don't you put the gun down? Now give me the fucking key! - The key's in my suitcase... - Shut up and get it!
That's a lot of ammunition for one shot. - I'm worried about security. - It's perfectly safe. It's also not going to affect the rescue operation on the other side. This plan has been signed off by my esteemed colleague here. She will implement it.
This room is narrow, but the walls have to go further out. What the hell is going on here? I thought I shut this place down. All right. And I waved my magic wand and reopened it.
She told Tom that they were in the middle of a divorce. Kurt was going to have a new will drawn up. But what stunned me the most was hearing Rosemary Carroll look at the suicide note on the tape and immediately realize it had to be a forgery. I don't think Courtney ever thought the suicide note would be released to the public. If I hadn't tricked her with a copy, no one would have seen it.
- He's planning what? Revenge. He gave me a letter for Lady Pole. - Show it to me. - I've already sent it.
My what? Sorry. I don't have any medical training. You don't say. I'll get him out.
I'll get him out. Can't they track us in here? I've hidden here before with the chip. The thick stone walls must be blocking the signal. I've got it.
Can't they track us in here? I've hidden here before with the chip. The thick stone walls must be blocking the signal. I've got it. I've got it. Put it in your pocket so you won't know it's there.
I hid here with the chip before. I guess the thick stone walls block the signal. I've got it. I've got it. Put it in your pocket so you won't know it's there. You'll throw it away when we escape.
I found a hidden route that takes us to the outskirts of the city. Tonight, at dinner... I'm going to the bathroom to look for Mikros. When I come back, wait three minutes. Then you go to the same restroom. You take out your chip... and leave it there.
They looked at me. It's okay. - Just walk calmly. - Okay. - What did you do with the chip? - I left it in the bathroom.
Don't wait for me. Why don't you ever water the lawn? Why should I water the lawn in winter? - Because it always dries up. - Why don't you water it yourself?
You don't know anything about my mother! You never cared about her. You haven't given her flowers in 10 years. And then this letter... Did you think Mom never read it?
You haven't given her flowers for 10 years. And then this letter... Did you think Mom never read it? You're wrong. She found it and read it.
I want to apologize for his behavior. It's not your fault. Let's face it, as his father, I should have done more. Let's face it, Julian just smelled the scent. And I'm starting to smell it, too.
Next question, please. Maybe you want to die, but I don't. Put out that cigarette. I see respect is your biggest problem, kid. With a little luck, no one will have to beat it into you.
Very Oprah. 7.30. Just puke that shit up. I'm a psychic. Shit is whispered to me by the universe. I just play it back, I channel it.
- Why don't we just build a fence? - That's a good idea. - Good boy, Max. Easy, easy, easy. - Who's gonna pay for it?
Easy, easy, easy. - Who pays him? You? No. If you do, I'll have the neighborhood kids paint it.
In here. I know you have to be really careful with it. You probably don't want to keep taking it out of the envelope either. But if you don't mind, I'd really like to see it again. You're right. I don't like to keep taking it out of the envelope. I don't like taking it out of the envelope all the time.
Of all the stupid... You almost tore my arm off! I didn't drag her ass up the hill for you to snap her neck just outside of town. You gave her my letter! I didn't give it to her, I gave it to you!
Major Marquis had a glorious idea. So glorious, you wonder why it never occurred to anyone before. Tell John Ruth your glorious idea. The whole place was practically made of firewood. So I torched it.
- Do you have a profile? - Of course I do. May I see it? What for? You must be able to produce it on request.
I'm afraid that applies to you, too, Mr. Mobray. One must take precautions, for life is too good to lose. Hand me that little bucket. O.B., go to the outhouse. Take the bucket and dump it in the shitter hole.
- No, in person with, "Dear Marquis." "Dear Marquis?" Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States of America? That's right. - May I see him?
- Yes. - See you later. - See you later. You carefully skin the rabbit with a knife and chop off the head. Then you cut open the belly... and stuff it with well-washed red and green peppers. None too spicy, plus some garlic and mint.
"Honey, dinner is ready. But I don't know if I can eat now. My front tooth hurts so bad. Could you please take a look?" "Yeah, sure, no problem," he said. And as soon as he turned around.... I took the drill and plunged it into his chest.
Yes. Therefore, tell me, brother, what is a man's word worth these days? A bag of gold perhaps? My oath for you is an oath for Scotland. I haven't broken it and I never will.
And then the day in the alcove, the way you kissed me. She was already married. But I've never been with a man. I want you to be the first and the only one to have me. No. I took an oath and I won't break it.
The key to Lallybroch. What? Your ring. I had the blacksmith make your ring from my key. Why didn't you say so when you gave it to me?
I have a cupboard full of potions and medicines. I need some peppermint, my dear. I have an offer. I made a vow. I will not break it.
Claire. - Your letter. - What letter? The one you sent. I didn't send it.
We are not servants of Szorlok. - Yes, we are. Either alive or dead. Just like your sister. Necromancer, you will get the stone and hand it over to me, or your friends will die.
We will now begin. Please, sit down. Please. We will start with the inlay table. Please wrap it up.
- Give us a minute. - Yeah. - Thank you, Stacey. - You're welcome. You forgot your cookie. You want it?
- Thank you, Stacey. - You're welcome. You forgot your cookie. You want it? Yeah, I want it.
Philippe. What are you doing? You'll wake everyone up. I forgot to nail the coffin shut. Don't call him that!
- Why is that? We have a late delivery service. It suits you very well. It's a one-of-a-kind piece, just arrived from Tokyo yesterday. I don't know about that, it's twice as expensive here as in Tokyo. But I don't want anyone else to wear it either.
But I have to do things like that now. It makes me seem more human. And you have to be a little human when you're the president. He couldn't even afford to buy his own headstone. I paid for it out of my stipend at the Sentinel.
Their motor skills are impaired. Your emotional reactions are unpredictable. There is a long road ahead of you and we must not rush things. - Let's finish the test later. - No. We'll do it now.
- Let's stick to the point. Our cameraman is leaving us. To Carl! I want Carl's job. Get him for me.
What? Then why did you tell me? I said I would. But it wasn't a good time. And you got the job without me. - You obviously deserve it.
- Don't you get it? We're trying to save you from this because you can't do it. - Not now. - I want Carl's job. - Get it for me.
You did a great job with that. You did a great job of getting Mary's words across. Thank you. Good job with the letter. I almost thought it was real.
We can take a real shower and sleep in a real bed. I'm not asking you to move in. Just for one night, don't be a homeless person. - Where's the ring? - I took it off.
Don't be a homeless person for just one night. - Where's the ring? - I took it off. - It's too big. - You have to wear it.
- They see you in Rubies. Nonsense. This Toni ticks differently than we do. Pain is part of life. You let it happen or you don't.
These... these are different. Detectives. The FBI sent us their full report. Interesting stuff, exciting to read. Very nice of them to pass it along.
Came back for you. You'd better watch out. Good. Let's show the Turks what... Follow me. - But you said we lost the hill. - We did, but we took it back.
- We did, but we got it back. - A third time? - No sir, fourth time. - Fine. - We lost him again.
Bruno. What else do you call this stone? Heliotrope, Bruno. The name comes from the sun. Because it gets its magical powers from the sun's rays. And whoever finds it will...
Maybe it was my overconfidence that made me do it. To show you that I can also lead. But while I was sitting here... I've been forced to consider another possibility. The course we've taken... Perhaps none of us would have thought of it had you not mentioned it first.
I ask you again. Do I infer from your silence that you are in favor of the proposal? He has made his reservations known... Madam... You have done enough to sully the good name of this family. Keep not only your mouths shut, but your thighs closed in the future. I approve.
Urine from old ladies. My God. Now you're teasing me. But nowadays, it's fermented in ammonia. Well, that's called progress. You just have to rinse the fish thoroughly in fresh water before you cook it, or you might burn your esophagus.
There is no such thing in Fortitude. What, sexual infidelity? Pampas grass. How did the dog die? I shot him.
That's all I ask. The GPR scan you gave the professor. - Yes. - Morton has the scan. He found it at the professor's house and took it with him.
Back. Now! Forward. They paid a high price for my revenge. They paid it for their freedom.
You stole the girl from me. But in return, the warship was moved. Away from its safe, unassailable position. Where its attention, especially Captain Flint's, is now entirely focused on the dangers threatening from Charles Town. This should keep them so busy that the last direction they expect a threat from is the water. I have named my price for the girl. You should know me well enough to know that I'm going to get it one way or another.
Congratulations, Jack. Now you know what resurrection is. It's not a feast, but the provisions are waiting at the pier. Get rid of it. Throw it away, sell it, whatever.
As soon as you start touching someone's body, the rest of them just melt away... and then you're just there, two bodies. Sometimes it even feels good. It's just sex. Sex is sex. We all need it.
It doesn't work, Sister Evangelina. I think the chimney is clogged. Without a doubt. Because of the carelessness of a certain workman. Give me the poker. I think it's likely that a bird's nest is clogging it.
Fortunately, I know the recipe. Hydrogen plus oxygen and ignite. I have hundreds of liters of hydrazine in the MDV. I can decompose the hydrazine to nitrogen and hydrogen using a lridium catalyst. Then I direct the hydrogen to a small area and ignite it.
- Yeah, right. - And the rest of you will never go into space again, guaranteed. Good. If we do it, how? I'll plot the course and execute it.
Is he talking about buying a new car, a boat? Is he making big plans? He bought a tow truck for $300. - There you go. - Does that sound like a plan? - Could be something. - He could fix it up and sell it.
This is the diagram of a mammoth jawbone. Okay. Okay. I showed Stoddart the tooth in the parking lot. I told him I dug it up.
You are already dead. - I'm very sorry about your brother. - You despised Alex. - I felt sorry for him. He had forgotten who he was, but his murder was a tragedy and we will avenge him.
But if you're hitting on the only person who can give me some of that apple pie, I'm afraid it's my business. I'll give you three seconds to get your pretty little ass out the door before I.... Don't talk about my ass. How about that pie? You got it.
I don't give people speeches. Doug, join us for dinner. We're having false rabbit. Will you help Jim think about whether to take the case? Oh, we'll take it.
I want you to cut off my arm. - Why is that? - Because he's killing me, stupid. He's no good to me anymore. I don't want him.
Listen carefully. You must take the creature back to the grove. But be careful. It won't go willingly. It's developed a taste for humans. What about Will? He won't come back unless you return the changeling. But don't let him know what you're up to. He can sense things.
Then how could Gerhardt become that? Krampus is a Christmas spirit. As your father said, the Christmas spirit can fill anyone. And if you are full of anger and vengefulness, this spirit overcomes you until you become a beast, a hunter of the wicked. Gerhardt's anger let him in, and....
How about a little compassion? You do realize that these are live animals, right? Clean up your workspace. It's messy. I think of it as a living system.
She still knew where it was put in her. She can disguise herself! Evacuate the island. We may never reopen. You create a genetic hybrid and raise it in captivity.
Ey, Chantal, I bet you can't let a ping pong ball fly out of your pussy! Five euros! Stupidity is witness! Where is your ball? Ah, got it!
Exceeds your HP, your priest is unconscious for now. No way, dude. Why is he still alive? I threw the fireball. You threw it at a "fire troll."
Look at the poor devils, what do they say? They are asking you not to send them back to hell. They want to go back home to their sons and daughters. There is such power in this spell. I cannot undo it.
Monsieur Chapuys, my friend Thomas Cromwell. Enchanté. I hardly know where I come from myself. If you want to speak in secret, try Greek, Monsieur Chapuys. My friend, you stare at the herring as if you hated it.
Yes, but I thought those days were over. I should have known our little beastie break was too good to be true. - Hey, where's the stick? - In the clothing closet. I decided someone else needed it more than I did.
Pratt here has an informant who has a lead on the dead girl. He'll be taking over the case from today. But I'm so close, sir. The killer was one of Tatiana's johns. The john's ring was stolen and he killed her to get it back.
He'll be taking over the case from today. But I'm so close, sir. The killer was one of Tatiana's johns. The john's ring was stolen, and he killed her to get it back. Only, she didn't have it.
Yes, you told me that. But she didn't have it. I saw the look in her eyes. Where is my ring? - I pawned it!
Since you are not going to Delhi, what enemy should you attract? The Peshwa does not lack enemies. Do not move. Your neck is very precious... And more delicate than this string of pearls around it.
Neither do seismic readings. And high-frequency energy? Possible, but doesn't go deeper than 10 meters. If his stuff goes in through the tunnel, it goes out that way. If there's a tunnel, he dug it all the way to China.
- Two versions of you? - And two Garys. But Alice didn't have a talisman here. That means for some reason she didn't have one here. We can find it.
We went this way together. And failed. - Felix, that doesn't sound like you. - Alice has the talisman. She'll destroy it the first chance she gets.
I am confused. He's back. Alice didn't have a talisman here, so she wanted yours. Which would mean she never had one here. - We can still find it.
Alice had no talisman here, so she wanted yours. Which would mean she never had one here. - We can still find it. - A second talisman. If there is a second talisman, where do we find it?
- Go after him. I don't see how. Promise me you won't do anything stupid. I have to find that spell. - Got it.
Morphine. I don't want it. The pain is mine. It's for Aleister. I won't let you take it away from me.
We tried to help him. But he was completely possessed by the devil. This boy was completely possessed by the devil. How do you cast out the devil from a boy? You can try to beat him out.
Elena, we need to talk. Listen, Jeremy. I didn't know how to bring it up, but it's about Clay. He's not himself. And look, this is the book that Clay found in Baton Rouge, right? And this chapter shows how a... a dark witch can enter another's body to control them.
If there was another option, we would take it. He's gone. And the only way for us to stop Aleister is to kill Clay. Jeremy, that's not going to happen. What if we find Aleister's body and kill him instead?
No... But you're asking for trouble. Yeah, seen that already. A guy makes a mistake, now he needs the sweet redemption of a good punch. Deal the blow or take it.
Chika, don't pour soy sauce on everything. Why didn't you wake me up? - Sorry, Yoshino. The alarm didn't go off. - I heard it.
Why didn't you wake me up? - I'm sorry, Yoshino. The alarm didn't go off. - I heard it. Did I turn it off?
When did you have your first nail polish? Me? When I was six years old. - That young? I went to Yokohama with my mom once, and she bought me... bright red nail polish. I wore it to school and they saw it while I was swimming.
Yes? - When grandma was alive, there were many more. We could give some to all the neighbors. The plum tree is getting old. I think grandpa planted it the year mom was born.
It is human. It has depth, it is ambiguous. It's about... You know, it's a poem. I see it as a fucking poem.
- No! Dale is the kidnapper! He's kidnapping her. He's not the hero! - Why are you being so negative? Because it's my movie! - It's our movie! And the studio is financing it!
But you weren't here, were you? I have a surprise for you, my dear. Your favorite brand. Yes, of course the champagne is chilled. No, I didn't let it breathe.
Somehow everything is complete bullshit right now. Yes, you're indulging in bullshit right now. Come on, let's go inside. Let's go inside. Where's the bill of sale? I can't find it.
Where is the purchase contract? I can't find it. - It's in there. Under "L". It's not. Where did you put it! ?
He's not. Where the hell did you put him! ? - I don't know. Damn it, Emma, this isn't a game! If we don't find him, we'll go to jail.
- The baby? - From Bennemin's daughter. She wanted juniper extract. From you, too, I suppose. She couldn't have gotten it, but what about the pregnancy?
- Did she work here? - Yes. I am very sorry for her loss. Which one was her desk? I have to ask that no one touch it until I can look at it.
A couple of guys were drunk and looking for trouble, okay? That's not what you told Karen. Why are you lying to me? I'm not. I know bullshit when I hear it, Stan.
- Both were killed with the same weapon, 9mm. No hits on ballistics. - Autopsy revealed something. - What? Both Donnie and Megan were missing a fingernail. - They didn't lose it in the accident?
I'm kicking you out. Come on. I got a freebie here. Okay, I'll tell you what. You bring me this case of beer and put it there and I'll let you play your free game.
Frank. Frank, get over here right away. Good. He's magnificent. He killed another bear, a full-grown male, ate him.
Vanessa. What do you think of my beard? - Excuse me? - My beard. I've had it ever since I can remember.
The murderer returns to the scene of the crime to relive the glory. Only here he is presented in wax. I know you were involved. - And your proof? - I'll find it.
- Inspector. Mr. Chandler. I know you are involved. - And your proof? - I'll find it.
Mr. Chandler. I know you are involved. - And your proof? - I'll find it. I always find it.
- She knows for sure. Not everything, but enough. You should tell her everything. Why? She takes your pain and makes it hers.
A last gravestone on the hill. A sip of poison from the yellow bottle. A single bullet under the chin. There is no other peace for you, Frankenstein. Go into the river, let it put you to rest.
And you? Where is your shore? There is no place far enough away. I have lost the immortal part of myself. No, I have thrown it away.
Celebrate your wedding. Save your wolves. But mark my words: If you ever betray them, I will hunt you down, and then your skull will adorn the end of a stake. Maybe I'll bring it to your grandmother as a gift.
These are the fish burgers. - What? - The fish burgers. They have pieces of beached whales in them. When a whale gets stranded somewhere, you don't throw it back, you sell it and make fish burgers out of it.
Until every uniform isn't washed twice, you're all wearing Office Depot's new fall collection. You've got to be kidding me! I'm not wearing the paperwork. It's just my color. I'm putting it on.
I don't wear the paperwork. This is exactly my color. I'll put it on. There's a paper overall in a pregnant woman's size. I suggest you secure that before one of your XL dorm mates wants it for her fat baby.
Especially in here. But when you look at Norma, you can take off your armor because you're safe. You are safe. And you cry because it feels so good to take off the armor. Because you realize how strong you are without it, and how light.
You can have my strawberry Jell-O. Fruit is good for the brain. Thank you. - Is this seat taken? - Yeah, we're saving it for Elias.
The one with maple syrup and bacon is considered Paleo, right? Only if you kill it yourself with the longbow.
How nice to see you back here, Gina. Hey, Red. We're supposed to be going to Norma's. Some people would like you to join us. My Wiccan group is getting weird. Protchnick rubs the energy ball on her pussy, then you don't want to touch it.
No, nosing is an art form all its own. When you're ready, suck it in. But don't swallow. Chew the scotch. Let it explore the different flavor zones of your tongue.
That's not how it works. You have to do the opposite. You have to engage with the pain. Really feel it. Tell yourself you're enjoying it. It's your pain.
You have to do the opposite. You have to get involved in the pain. Really feel it. Tell yourself that you enjoy it. It's your pain. I enjoy it?
You have to get involved with the pain. Feel it properly. Tell yourself that you enjoy it. It's your pain. I'm enjoying it? Yes, you're enjoying it.
I'm sorry that I hurt you. I hear you're in a lot of trouble. Temporarily on leave, MCC wants an independent investigation. I had nothing to do with that erotica novel. She wrote it for your class.
I hear you're in a lot of trouble. Temporarily on leave, MCC wants independent investigation. I had nothing to do with that erotic novel. She wrote it for your class. No, she just thinks she wrote it for that, because that's how kids think.
Do you realize how stupid you sound? We just want to take a look. Sex education. Get out of my salon. First you show us.
No, no, I... I mean, what are you doing, bringing me gifts, making reservations at a fancy restaurant? Well, I, uh... I like you, and I want to spend time with you. I can't, not tonight. I already rented a movie, and I have to return it if I don't watch it.
I have seen how strong you can be.... and that Wes you must be here and now to help the others. Here. Sam's ring. I took it off him before we... I thought you might want it.
Make an effort. Did your boss give you the okay? Excuse me, but the records show that the laptop... pending review by District Attorney Parks. Okay, Wendy Park has said under oath that Sam Keating is not a suspect in this case. She's just keeping it so she can bury evidence that would hurt her case.
I... Can we talk? I don't want this to be over with. Well, the goal is to get everyone acquitted of all charges... and there is a way. Find it.
Why are you so obsessed with Rudy? - You said you didn't know him. - Because I am. Do you recognize this ring? I gave it to my husband on our wedding day.
- You said you didn't know him. - Because I do. Do you recognize this ring? I gave it to my husband on our wedding day. Any idea why we found it in the woods?
You get rich, you give yourself a rich name.... Annalise. Your name is Anna Mae. Another thing your mama gave you out of a charity box. I'm not saying that name wasn't good enough. I told you I changed it, and all I ask is that you accept the fact that I did change it.... and to acknowledge my desire...
Yes, the freak who lived here before. Why wouldn't his relatives know that he no longer lives here? Oh, it's from his grandmother! My engagement ring is gone! I lost it!
My engagement ring is gone! I have lost it! - What is it? - It's fake. I bought it in cash at a jewelry store in Chinatown.
Is anyone in your family, um, you know...? involved? If I tell you, you can't tell any of the others, understand? The drugs were found by customs officials when the container failed a random weight check, so the question is why the officials chose this container... out of over 1000 that pass through the port every day. No. I will never go into those woods again. Dumbass. If the cops find your ring, they'll trace it back to you.
Wes. And so it begins. So you recognize the ring? Of course I do. I gave it to my husband on our wedding day.
And this is how it starts. So you recognize the ring? Of course I do. I gave it to my husband on our wedding day. Any idea why we found it in the woods?
Should I rather not be here? No, I was just leaving. I also have a whole closet full of engagement gifts, so let me know if you want any of those, except the panini grill, I already used that, broke it and bought a new one. We'll take the juicer. I will bring it over this week.
You name it, we do it. Basket weaving at the craft museum. Well, you said it. Oh, here's another one. I'd like the apple pancake mix to be on the top shelf because it starts with an "A", but I'm not putting it there because I don't want you to break one of your little legs making my breakfast.
Lorne says the creature saved your life. Is that true? Did a dragon come from the stars? With nine eggs. How do you persuade him to fight for us?
You need more than smoke spells, you runt. Hold it. We'll wait here for my uncle. We should get going while we can. Where I come from, you take advantage when you have it.
Through your own shadow! What heroism! Man of the south! I see this earthy flower makes you weak! Kiss her neck while you can, before I stretch it like her mother's.
Are you all right? Yes. - You, uh... You still owe me a joke, can it be? Yes. You want to tell it to me?
Yes, now. - Okay. I'm listening. I'm listening. What? Julius, you may tell it now.
That contradicts your statement that you were sure. No, it doesn't. - It doesn't? Would you explain that to me? You have to understand something. If I get a report that the air strike is not authorized, even though it is the only one that can save our lives, and I know it is justified, then it is my duty to have it done.
Dad? - Yes? Look at this stone. Did you find a flat stone? - No. One with a hole. Can you hold it like this? Like you're going to throw it.
That's it. Haim, you are in charge. Absolute confidentiality. Give an order without the High Command knowing. Burn it after the briefing.
Kurdish son of a bitch! How did he do that? Are you saying that in Hebrew? The security code is built so that no computer can interfere. Only the device that activated it can now start operation
This can also lead to financial instability and open... Yes, yes, I have. - I think I'm going to switch to coffee. - I thought you didn't like coffee. Well, I don't like it much, but I need something stronger.
- I think I'll switch to coffee. - I thought you didn't like coffee. Well, I don't like it much, but I need something stronger. - You want another cappuccino? - I'll get it.
Nice of you. He sleeps together with his brothers. Then he might as well use my palace. And what about the hamster? Laeti gave him to me.
He sleeps together with his brothers. Then he might as well use my palace. And what about the hamster? Laeti gave it to me. Her father was probably about to put him in the microwave.
- Say my dick is big. - It's big. - Yeah, say huge. - You have a huge... dick, sweetie, and I love it.
Okay. What I'm saying is this: I love my cock. Do you understand how important it is for me to say that? And I really feel that. So, I love it.
So... Since it's not strange... Honey, lie down. You have to undress. What do you want, missionary? Let's do it right now. Kurt, why don't you take your old big cock out and stick it in her right now?
There is a snowman in front of the house. Do you see it? That's... That's great, Max. But who built it?
Oh, my God! "Oh, my God" is right. This is from me and the girls. I had to reattach the foot. Yes, if you look closely, he reattached it very well.
Up and down. Can I take it out? No? Can I stick my dick in your ass? And then pull it out again?
Can I join you? Hang on. And keep your mouth shut. You're a friend and a helper, patrolling, walking the wall, watching kids. If there's a conflict, solve it.
Turn that off. There are more biters than before. I don't know if there are people around. There's someone there. Aiden was... tried to save us. From a walker. He shot him.
Up you go. Suit up, I told you. You want to look good. It's a rental, all right? I need it back.
I'll tell you so we both know what it's about. A lady in the neighborhood saw, two nights in a row... a suspicious van parked across the street from the Kettleman house. She took down the license plate. It was your license plate. The police found your van and you, they examined it... and found traces of blood on the ground.
Dana, tell Roger again and then hit him for me. I gotta go pick him up. Can you finish? He was the first to report on the shooting of John F. Kennedy. He described the Zapruder film in detail to the nation, which was not allowed to see it.
Recommend to me how we should deal with this. This is dated August 18, 1973. and the subject line is: CYA, which I guess means "hedge your bets"? Staudt obviously put more pressure on Hodges about Bush. Covering his back and doing my job is too much. Harris gave me word today regarding Bush's performance report. And Staudt is pushing to whitewash it.
I made up a science joke, would you like to hear it?
- Because it will be fun to see him. It will be humiliating. Now we already have two reasons. They have him. - Please, may we look at him?
Okay, hopefully one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear. Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? Looks like their suitcase arrived in Los Angeles. Where is it? I don't know, maybe someone took it off the baggage carousel by mistake?
Yup! I got the code. As I said, there's no money back if you finish early. You sure you don't want to go home? If the case is there, deliver it.
Leonard, I've been working on an opening gag for our talk at Berkeley. Oh, I like to laugh. But tell it anyway.
So while Leonard's getting ready, let's take a call. Hello, caller, you're live with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2. I don't have a question. I just wanted to say I'm a big fan of the movie. I've seen it, like, 10 times.
I can't believe you just walked out on an audition for a big movie. Yes, I did. I mean, I went in, I read my part, and I was bitching about it, and then I walked right out. I'm glad you have a new motivation for your job now. Yeah, and you know, I don't think I ever really thanked you for helping me get it.
No red and yellow, No red and yellow, - Yep, it's green! - We did it! If rotating is already this much fun, what will it be like when we let it fly. Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights go out.
We get the Iraqis' money, right? So it's not free. Is it, Sergeant Harper? Not a lump in the earth, see? Without water, it lacks cohesion and is barren.
Protector of K'un-Lun. It is different than I thought. Different than we all thought. But you have a duty now. And we will face it together.
No decent woman would be interested in him. And you would not have to be on your guard. We have the same father. You are a box of seven seals in every respect. Whenever I think it's empty, I hear a tiger roaring inside.
They were without voice. They were hurt. But thank God they had a film and thank God I could do a little bit to make our democracy a little bit more just. Creating untrue stories, does not make democracy more just. It does lasting damage to it.
This is where I read. I never use the ballroom. You'll have to redo the floor. The laundry room. This is where you hang my underwear after washing.
According to a cookbook to cook dinner. I suppose anything but lamb. My private library is always open to you. It's mostly law books, but I have just about everything from Italian cooking to the world's most dangerous mushroom. It's probably not as nice as the libraries you know....
- Put that damn thing down or I'll punch you in the balls. Put it down! - Okay, there's a very simple solution. The farm is worth a lot of money. There's a uranium deposit underneath it...
What does the Legion of Doom want with the medallion? The Legion of Doom? - Yes. - Don't ask. According to the legend, the medallion calls the lance and leads directly to it.
If they think I'm here, they'll send in a SERT team. Bud. Back your truck up to the loading dock. - Help him load a freezer. - Why? - So they'll think you're in it.
Let them take it. No speed weapon can stop a god. I suspect the power source is most likely here. - Why there? - Because it's the deepest part of the building, and if it's as valuable as you say, the deepest rooms of any building are usually the safest.
Babe, we're going to need more wood. Okay, but first watch the video. This bear is freaking out on people, and he... No. This is not why we came out here. We came out here to be one with nature, not to watch people get eaten by it.
I can't let it fall back on my daughter. - It's just us. - You have family on the block, don't you? A sister? That's not an easy thing to do either. In my experience, family will always rise to the occasion if you just give them the chance.
Would you take away my memories of Alice? Yes. I would free you completely. No. You are wiser than you seem. You would find your way back to grief no matter how far you ran from it.
-We need to talk. -I know what it's about. It... It was silly to think I'd stop the chemistry between us if I didn't give you the letter. If the socially frowned-upon age difference can't hurt her....
Vincent, this is my son. Listen to me. I will find Adam, I will bring him back to you. But whoever has him right now is using really strong, dark magic. Really powerful magic, and you need to stay away from it.
I'm sorry. She shouldn't be listening to this. Why are you doing this? Why do you put such ideas in her head? Because this world is ending, and you shall not perish with it.
He could love selflessly. I once had a snake. A tiger python named Krueger. Actually, it belonged to Cal, but Krueger liked me best. - Did you talk to her?
Mom! What are you doing? He's at the CA. Grab your stuff. Culture is hard to control and being a Cleverman forces you to be consumed by it.
That would not be helpful. What about Eric O'Bannon? My people will take care of him. Don't hurt O'Bannon. I intend to steer the story, not fall victim to it.
Robby? Wear it for good luck. Oh, your sister's up to something. Since the Christmas speech, this watch is more famous than you. Reach for it when you speak.
- She must be at the scarf. It's not there. Not in the jewelry box either. Did you take it? I was just playing with it.
And my freckles. I hate them. Surely the other kids - would like me more if I were pretty. - Fiddle-dee-dee! You're a vain child, that's for sure. If a rose weren't pretty, no one would smell it.
During coral bleaching, the flesh becomes transparent. You can see the skeleton underneath. The bright white in the photos are simply the skeletons. If the coral looks very clean and white then it is still alive. It will not allow anything to grow on it.
Ford always knew where to put the camera. Suddenly, out of the clouds: the Jap attack! BATTLE FOR MIDWAY DIRECTOR: JOHN FORD His reaction was purely cinematic. At that moment, reality reaches him and he rushes to meet it.
Not alone, of course. None of us can do something like this all by ourselves. You need a good story, guidance and a lot of support. And I got all of that from a single person none of you knew. But I owe it all to her...
Please. May I. I love old stories. And believe me, New English is full of them. When the city fell, we fell with it.
- Yes. I don't know. Something's in the wound. She's cold, and she has a fever. I'll, uh... Okay, I'll go check on her right now.
Thank you for your, sir. Forward, forward. My what? For your time. Young lady... you can't change the past. But I dare say you'll learn something from it.
Time may be many things, Hamish, but money certainly is not. Nor is it our enemy, Mother. Where did you come from all of a sudden? I walked through the wall. I can't change the past, but I can learn from it.
I just lay there and cried. And I didn't know what to do. Only one thing: the time had come to leave my daddy's house. Suddenly the world seemed so big and uncertain. It took a long time before I felt strong enough to take it on.
- They are all a little lost, always moving in circles. Don't lose your head in the process. Yes, thank you. What about her? Well, if she lived in it, she'd probably be the most beautiful thing the real world has ever seen, but...
Not very clever. Now I realize you care about two people. The license plates are out of focus. The next traffic camera failed. Damn SUV went right under her.
Just a poor, worthless bitch from the Polo Grounds. Is that why you became a cop? I kick hoodlum ass, and I get bullet for bullet. I put handcuffs on murderers. I don't just seek justice, I pursue it.
Get to know the hope of humanity. Right now I have to take you and your sister to Odessa. Destiny... although it always runs in our direction, can be redirected by the choice we make. The fate of the entire world depends on us getting this right tonight. - Then I suggest you find her, or the brother who is looking for you, when the world ends, will burn with her.
- Only those with parties. May the magic... of this earth... flow through my veins... from this day... until my last. It has begun. The bark of the silver willow was only available in Olney. It won't help her anymore.
- No contact for three months. - Then we need to find them fast. - Already on it. This is ruining my beautiful nature experience. You hate nature. Well, I'd like it more if there were fewer dead people in it.
Yes, and that snails have teeth. We'll be rubber in a minute. Yes. Now that the field is cleared... ...they'll use the snail's teeth to protect you in case the bomb goes off... ...if they tear you away from it.
We do not support them. Fine. You will still finish it. I hope you agree, my friends. There is no better offer. Let's ride the wave of freedom instead of being drowned by it.
- Yes, yes... - The size of Marseille... You show greatness, and squeeze your own juice. The greatness of Marseille is that people here hate it when you talk about the city as something special. Thank you. But when you talk about it as a normal city, without Olympique, without violence, without drugs, they don't like it either.
You think it's cute, right? You think you're one heart and soul. You feed her, dress her up in something pretty.... But the cat doesn't care about you, as long as her bowl is filled twice a day.
I ask only one thing of you: when you report these unfortunate events, describe me as I am. Without softening anything. And without hatred. Then you will have to tell about a man who loved passionately, but who loved without wisdom. A man who was not very receptive to jealousy. But once seized by it, he was carried away to the last excess.
Except for an occasional saliva sample, he is unharmed. And the others in the containment centers? What about them? I'm a man of science, waruu. I took Darwin's theory of natural selection and gave it a reboot.
Tomorrow is a wedding. Girls love weddings. You just invite her. She comes, the music plays, everything is romantic. You take her hand and give her a little kiss.
Yes. Yes. Let her speak to you. Give her your strength. Give her your hope.
Thank you for answering my question. Funny, that sounded like a demand. Not that question. But whether your machine knows the password to run the virus. From the beginning, when you crippled your machine, you denied it the same power you enjoy:
I have to admit... Not what I was hoping for. I really thought it would be one of the ATCU showing up at the plant. - Wasn't expecting you. - I work with the ATCU. You mean you keep S.H.I.E.L.D. alive inside her.
Then we will make your confession out of it. - Temptation was my vice. - What kind of temptation? The lust of the flesh. That is not a sin unless you give in to it.
That was strange. I was awake, but I was dreaming. I was here, but... not here. In the darkness. Lost. I heard your voice. I followed it.
Medical problems. You know how he did it? He put the recorder in the cup to amplify my voice. It didn't just amplify your voice. It gave it direction.
You wanted to believe that the Army set me straight. I'm your brother, but I'm not like you. I didn't like the Army like you did. You saw the world as something that needed to be fixed. To me, it was just broken, so I made sure I had enough to survive in it.
Their opposites are light and hope. La luz del alma. The light of the soul. If you can channel la luz del alma, you will be able to ward off Darhk's magic. I'm here to learn that. I just wish it were that simple. If the darkness in you outweighs the light, you will not repel Darhk's magic, but end up giving it new nourishment.
Time and people, we grew up together. We are dependent on each other. Impossible. Time is older than man and infinite. But in the here and now we help it to think. Time needs us.
But no, you sneak away in the middle of the night with your tail between your legs... because of him. It's called loyalty. Didn't expect you to understand the concept. Well, that died along with the seven billion. How are you going to save the future if you can't survive in it?
- Thank you. Most priests would have had kind words for the man himself, but.... I said he came here. Nothing lights up the halo faster than death, Matthew. But funerals are for the living, and rewriting the past only dilutes what you learn from it.
It generates friction. And thus vibration and speed... - What? - Complete chaos. It could destroy this whole bridge. And everyone on it.
Shit, I'm building chairs, damn it. But I'm here today because I love Venice as much as you guys do. This is a new beginning. A new chapter. We're not forgetting our past... We build on it.
You are an embarrassment. An embarrassment to everyone who ever knew you. To everyone who loved you. - I'm the wrong guy. Tell me the target. - I don't give a shit about you! How can you admit the truth if you won't face it?
You get a head start. I'm going to close my eyes and count to ten. And I won't try to follow you, but now all of you... everywhere... - Pack your things and leave this planet. - Are you declaring war on us? I'm drawing a line, and I suggest you pull away from it real quick.
Are you going to run over an old lady, or are you going to turn the wheel and hit a wall? How old is the old lady? 76. No, 72. In good health? She's been better.
In about seven minutes, the hostage rescue team will arrive here. Bye. I just want to be in my daughter's life. That's the thing about family. You can't choose when you can be a part of it.
Two little boys. Alone and orphaned. With memories of who they thought they were, shaped and created by the beasts there in that forest. And now grown up. - Homo homini lupus est. Before Rutowski was found, weeks before, remember, Deborah? The talk had already begun. A figure seen on rooftops, watching the community. It was given the name Whitechapel Golem.
- You're going back to the city? ! That's crazy! - Somebody has to stop them. Otherwise we'll lose the whole town and all the people in it.
I'm flattered, though. He was a good-looking fellow. Rise and shine, Major Niete. What do you think of my latest business idea? Your girlfriend's giving her the old zombie seal of approval.
Go home. And keep the beast close, you understand? - Matthew, I was scared. - I felt the same way, darling. I'm telling you, this town and what I saw of it today, we need to get it over with quickly so we can be done with it once and for all.
Yes. Doctors, teachers, about a dozen veterinarians. All alpha males. Hey, I was cleaning the watch and found an engraving. I had to give it an acid wash, but at least you can read it now.
If they know Uncle Felix had it, then they know he gave it to me, - and if they know he gave it to me.... - Stop, stop. Let them find the chest. If they know about it, then they'll think we took the book somewhere else.
Then Dean Winchesters. Then Amaras, then Lucifers. A few weeks ago, you were cleaning these floors with your tongue. We could take over hell again, but why the torture? The world is ending, and this time... hell ends with it.
-Three of us. ...our executioner. Listen to the mad words of a wise man. "If one day or night a demon crept up on you in the loneliest.... The eternal hourglass of existence is always turned over, and you with it."
You would need gas masks. Are you ready? Is it painless? It's quick. "The eternal hourglass of existence is turned over and over again, and you with it.
Put that down! I live here! This is my apartment! I know. The apartment and everything in it is yours.
Martínez was right. We all need a method. Something to hold on to when we're up to our necks in shit. Something to get us home when we're lost. If you're lucky, someone shows you a method and you follow it.
I fully intend to pay her back in kind, as long as the people of Bergerane stand behind me. She has all the strength of Serge Vauban's zeal. Vauban's only strength is his love for his son. And justice doesn't care about love, does it? And sometimes it doesn't even care about the truth.
So you admit it. So... what's new? I'm just staying at the old McConnell ranch. Some Hollywood douche bought it. His 8-year-old gave it a new name:
I like to see you laugh. Shit, Vilde! She's a pain in the ass with that Kose group. The Kose group! I totally forgot about that. You can't tell her that!
I'm hungry and want something to eat. Find the nearest taco place. I found the following taco recipe. No, I don't want a taco recipe. The machine doesn't just talk to us, we talk to it.
For Azeroth! For the Alliance! A long journey awaits you, Go'el. My world may be lost, but this is your world now. Take from it what you need.
I was taught to suppress my anger, which I did.... and still do. That's exactly why I envy you. Mm-hm. The anger you have inside you, it still shows. It's written all over your face, so to speak. Make peace with it, Gilly.
And what's so wrong with them? He wanted to achieve something, for his family, for himself! He was a dreamer, Owen. Yes, he was. He dreamed of the sea and was never allowed to sail it because of men like them.
Do you think we're just going to take the loss? No. We repackage them and put them in a CDO. We take Bs, BBs and BBBs that couldn't be sold and put them in a pile. And when the pile is big enough, the whole thing is declared diversified and the whores at the rating agencies give it a 92%-93% AAA rating, no questions asked.
Goodbye, Nimish. Your Highness. - Welcome. In this hand... I am but wax. If you like her, put a ring on her.
And Reyes was probably killed. The e-mail on his computer was a decoy. They wanted to see if we were on to Reyes. We got caught. Were you able to locate the recipient?
Maybe you can go further. I can't exist anywhere without you. I wanted to ask you to come here to me. You would have to leave the other world behind. Stop breathing in it, like me.
His head did not survive the concrete. I just remembered, there was a suicide in my building last night. A woman slit her throat. I hope they can find someone to take over his job. Even before doomsday people realized the importance of exploring space. We, the collective, give it top priority and perfect it.
- Henry? Have you ever heard of a Glyptapanteles? Damn, what does that have to do with what's going on here? A rather horrible and insidious wasp that lays its eggs in an unsuspecting and helpless caterpillar. And with the help of a polydnavirus, it can not only overcome the caterpillar's immune system, but also control its entire motor system while its larvae feed on it.
Escaped with the Darkspore. - We failed. It was not wrong to trust or hope. And yet in vain. If we do not face the darkness, we ourselves become a part of it.
- No. No, no. It's actually quite good. You just need to know one thing. The flag of a ship is something sacred. It must simultaneously spread fear and terror among the toughest sailors, as well as strengthen and unite those who sail under it.
The flag? What about the flag? It is new. Not used much yet. Why? Is there something wrong with it?
We both know that's a lie. Lies are necessary when the truth is too hard to believe, right? It wasn't a surrender. Pablo did not bow to justice. He escaped it, and there was nothing you could do but watch him do it.
Because through this, the heart is at the mercy of another. One is so unprotected. We are all clumsy when we are in love. Anyway, my love failed. When I opened up to her then, she left me, and I was very hurt.
It's about the flow, so.... He looks so normal. I thought we agreed not to judge him until we had hard evidence. What about the file? It said he murdered his wife.
He can't stay here. Heads, we get the body. Your DNA is under his nails, on his skin, so the only way to get rid of the traces is to burn the body. We get the body, and then what? - We do what with it exactly?
Done. 33 seconds. Ok, that will be our measurement base. You know I'm not going to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse finds its way out of its maze, it gets a treat. She also gets her brain removed with tweezers.
A lie by Stannis Baratheon. He wants the throne, but his brother's children are in the way. So he claims they are not his brother's. A vile lie. There is not an ounce of truth in it.
A valuable antique. What do you mean, it's not yours? I'll pay you $900 for it. - Cash on the nail. - I don't like to part with it.
Tell me about yourself. What does the virgin oracle want? Relax. Lust is as fleeting as the song of birds. When it comes, you must give yourself to it completely.
Thea knows nothing about Sara. And she will never know anything. That's where you're wrong. I know her. She'll find out the truth no matter how well you hide it from her.
The sniper knew when Jeremy Fritz would be at the exact location. All other shooting was just to throw us off the scent. Fritz was the sniper's primary target. If you'll let me, I'd like to take a look at your hand. I can help make it better.
My girlfriend, she wants to leave me. She called me a loser last night. Her ex is back in town, he's a bouncer. I thought if she saw me in the mask, she'd take me seriously. Did you go through my apartment looking for her?
That is not an answer. You catch on quickly. Will you help me? No, I'm going to train with you. How to control your gift, how to profit from it, how to use it, and how to fight.
He saw the traveler lying bleeding on the road and stopped to help, regardless of the circumstances or difficulties it might cause. The Samaritan treated the traveler's wounds, applied oil and wine. And he carried him to an inn, giving all the money he had to the owner to nurse the traveler back to health while the Samaritan continued his journey. He did this only because the traveler was a fellow citizen. He loved his city and all the people in it.
More than a heroic last stand. We need a strategy. A little help, please. Evaluating strategies... It's a bad time for your machine to break down, Harold. Give it a second.
Or almost anything. Sorry, you missed it. We need a strategy. A little help, please. Bad time for your machine to break down, Harold. Give her a second. She's got a lot to think about.
Bad time for your machine to break, Harold. Give her a second. - We need a strategy. - A little help, please. It's a bad time for your machine to break, Harold. Give her a second.
Oh, my God! - You need to get out of here right now. Oh, my... what are you doing here? What am I doing here? I shook hands with a couple of council members, see a figure skulking around in the dark, followed it, and find you.
It was never my intention that you make her your accomplice. You weren't there. No... but you could have corrupted her timeline and stopped her from sending the message that triggered our entire investigation. Time is merciless, Mr. Cole. We risk everything by playing with it, mocking it.
Not our addictions. Not the toxins in our food. They only paralyze us. Fear consumes us. Because of it, we go to the cold, dark place.
No, this is raw and authentic and it's.... Full of drugs. How about tonight you forget you're a cop? Can I be a cop again? They say that memories make us, that the past defines us, but we can't forget to grow, to evolve, because sometimes a memory can be so powerful that we get stuck in it, instantly frozen.
The year 2011 SIXTEEN YEARS LATER How are you? Time is not perfect. But I envy how most of you seem to be resisting it.
Please, listen, we need to talk. - Call my office tomorrow. - Then it's too late. If you don't help me, Cole will die, and I won't let that happen. Time is taking its course.
Let's ask our Russian to find out. I don't think they'll be happy to see us again. - Why is this bag so important anyway? - I have to have it. Because I'm very attached to it.
I'm going to call you the milkman, milkman. Carol. With all due respect to the milkman here, who definitely deserves all this credit, for basically just standing around, I found this thing, so I get to decide what happens to it. No, no, no, no. Phil, just because you found the cow doesn't give you the right to decide what we do with it.
I should never have let you come here tonight. I didn't... I didn't realize. Don't say that. I wanted you to. You have no idea how much this family means to me... how much I want to be a part of it, but...
Still going about your mission? I wish I had never triggered the signal. I was out, walking a new path with you. You can't always run away from your past. Sometimes you have to face it head on, risk everything for a new future.
The world does not revolve around you. You should look closely now. These are the treasures from the burial chamber of Empress Mother Cixi. The Mojin have recovered this pearl from her mouth at the risk of their lives. The essence of nature is preserved in it to protect the body from decay.
-Our thinking is crazy -Too slow Where am I going? Or what am I doing? I don't know, I don't know When the civil rights movement really took off, she took off with it, too.
- I'd like to know that too, Spencer, but I've never made it in. It's too far from my room. What if you don't make it back in time? It starves you for days. It turns on a siren that you'd rather die than listen to for another second.
Aren't they cute? Sweet as sugar. That really exists. That's what they really say. Love is never what you think it is, is it?
You really have exquisite hands, Olivia. She is lucky to come from this gene pool. I've always been very afraid of the day you would find me and want answers from me. I'm not good with fear. I've been running from it.
For me, faith is a word that describes something unreal, but that you still desire. Actually, it's a sad word. And what do you believe in? I believe in this world and the chaos around us. The gift of being an Upir allows us to live in it for a very long time.
Yes, you said you wanted to make a change. You know how much I appreciate you. I've made that clear... on numerous occasions, sometimes so embarrassingly. You were a good friend and a good partner. It was you, in fact, who helped me understand the concept of partnership, the value of it.
It's only happening because someone made it happen. If you're pulling the strings, Luthor... You've got it all wrong. I never cared much for power. I turned my back on it.
She is the devil. - Lee, do you think do you think I wanted things to go the way they went? - I had to play her game. - I know, I know. Forget Barbara. Most people fight their dark side. Lately, you find ways to give in to it.
Listen, I'm sorry to come unannounced like this. It's just... so hard to talk at the office these days. Tell me about it. I saw you staring into your coffee cup for a whole minute this morning. You know, sometimes I talk to her, begging her to wake me up.
The audience! Nothing is alive without an audience! Not necessarily. Without an audience... one experiences... the mystery of music. Alone with it, with its mystery.
You can't just... make a few Google queries, administer some pills and hope it goes well. You have to know the patient's history, the family's history, you have to know what.... So you're not advocating this kind of psychiatric vigilante approach? No, I don't. I understand it and I sympathize with it.
- Not bad. - In two years, we'll have cameras on every floor. This... is Betsy. My mother's name. I love the machine, so I named it.
You can't leave someone with a bonsai and an orchid and put pressure on them. You let the orchid die too? I watered it every day. Lori, you're not supposed to water it every day. I gave it just the right amount of water.
But not always of their own volition. Sir? - This town, Mr Marlott. She is being dragged, screaming and wriggling like a wild infant to a better future. Whether she wants it or not. Do your job well, and you're sure of a role in it.
You are still weak! You're pathetic and scared! You can hit the dome all you want, Junior. You're under it again.
It has begun. The surface of the dome is calcifying. Soon no living thing will be able to breathe unless I can make the dome disappear with Joe's help. I don't understand. How can what's happening to the dome make you weaker? Because I'm connected to it.
You still don't want to take me with you. You hang around while I trudge through the centuries, day after day, hour after hour. Do you even care about what happens when you fly away? I live on the world you leave behind. Because you left me behind on it.
- Don't tell her! - Honey, go downstairs quickly. In the kitchen under the sink.... PATTI: I remember the day Neil left me. I sat out on the lawn and waited for the sprinklers to come on. The whole fucking world looked like all the green had gone out of it.
- I thought you were the leader. - Sometimes even I need help. I have an idea. But you have to listen carefully. And give it a chance.
But only man is capable of starting a fire and maintaining the flame. Control is everything. One power stands above all others, a divine power from which comes the greatest responsibility... that of life and death. You can feel the essence of all things. With it you can give life or take it away.
But now I know that was a false glimmer of hope. I know this "it happens all the time in the desert," but this time it got me. And the thing is, this death, my end, is exactly what was supposed to happen. I wanted the darkness. I was asking for it.
He drank too much. Above all, he was weak. His instinct was worth nothing. I detested people like him. I thought the world got better because he was no longer in it.
You should start training at the first blink of an eye. Your mother wanted to throw me to the wild boars. I remember that axe. It was your paperweight. About the horn, Dad. Heidrun said her father gave it to her.
Can you hear me? It's really important that you wake up. I need to talk to you. Listen to my voice. Follow it to the surface.
- Yes, understood. - You're about to do your first live broadcast, aren't you? - Yes. Bethany Snow? I'll bet you two to one she'll mention Sara and her sister. Alex, with all due respect, I hardly think people care about my friendship with Laurel Lance and an 8-year-old scandal while the city is crumbling and there are armed masked people helping her.
I'm trying to protect your platoon. I don't trust the government to protect me. I read your file. Both your parents were scientists developing bioweapons vaccines for the government. They didn't see her as the enemy.
Why should she? She left. Because she felt that you preferred Superman to her, and she always came second. Look, I don't know anything about romantic love. I just... I haven't been very successful at it. But if I ever meet her, I'll be sure to fight for her.
- Yeah, sure. I'll call someone. - I know someone. - You do? - Yeah, I guess you forget where I live. Actually, I don't... You live on the island, of the missing toys, full of people on the run from the government, not in it.
And why? Because at the critical point, a tragically foolish megalomaniac deprived humanity of the very bright minds that might have been its salvation. You see, if you were a gambler, you would understand that the here and now always trumps the later. The future is a sham, a maybe, an eventuality, a "what if?". The only real thing is the present, and you have plundered it. You have stolen from it the geniuses who could avert the dystopia you fear so much.
- Question. - Yes. What does music mean to you? It's my life, everything I... I think about it all the time. I wake up with it and go to sleep with it.
But they won't find out. Not if you don't say anything. How long did you think you could keep this a secret? You mean without your help? Or with her?
- You could have said hello. - Oh boy, it's hot, isn't it? - Did you see something? Yes. Okay, I'm just going to be direct and tell you what you saw. I took a resuscitation doll and I dressed it up like Gordon and I'm talking to it and I'm doing other stuff with it and we're going to need a new resuscitation doll most likely.
These stones can only be tamed by beings with extraordinary powers. Look. These beings can mow down entire civilizations with the stone like wheat from a field. I'm peeing my pants. For a short time, one group was able to control the energy. But even they were quickly destroyed by it.
Ha, ha. Personally, I prefer the term "vagian." (ALL LAUGH) - We should talk about the blouse. - Yeah, okay. - I love that blouse. - I know, but give her a break.
- Statistical weighing. Not that you've ever talked to a woman. Unsportsmanlike because of the stains, sentimental because the cap was mended four... Five times. It cost more than the cap, so he's attached to it. More than that.
A love story about... - It's about covering up. Covering who you really are. And isn't that the scariest thing of all? That's why I'm going to reinvent this entire production and put a postmodern mask on it. Now, who can tell me what Japanese tradition is covering the face all in white?
I know I'm not good enough for you. But I'm not wasting my life to prove you wrong. You're a coward, you know that? You don't fight for love. You're afraid of it!
- when people are versatile. - I have a Marianne side. Unpredictable, impulsive. Sometimes unreasonable. You have awakened that side. And I'm going to indulge it one last time, because as Miss Austen said:
Because King Horik and Jarl Borg want to join us. And maybe we don't have to come back so quickly, but stay in their country for a while, explore it, maybe even spend the winter there. Who knows? But I tell you, these are interesting times. The world is changing and we have to change with it.
Kill me too! You think I can't stand the sight of blood? You think I'm weak? I want to see your blood, I want to see your brains on the table, your whole sex soaked in blood like my bird. You think I am weak and love you because my womb desires your seed, you think I would carry your brood, give it my blood and your name!
You're absolutely right, Mother! At my age, I won't have any more children. It ends with us. People like Mathias and me tell ourselves that it doesn't matter, that childhood is just a human invention and not an invention of God. That there's nothing natural about it and we should just leave it behind, but we can't.
Should we be worried about him? - Why is that? Should we be worried that he's going to come back and...I don't know? No, he's just...he's just weird. But I'm going to get my axe. And I'll sleep with it in case your damn dinner guest comes back and wants dessert or something.
You want to polish your ego. No, no, no. It's just that I'm feeling pretty rusty right now, and I wanted to... No, you're just feeling sorry for yourself right now. And it's a waste of time because, you know, that's life, Hank. You know, shit comes flying at you. And you gotta deal with it.
It's just that I'm feeling pretty rusty right now and I wanted to.... No, you're just feeling sorry for yourself right now. And it's a waste of time, because, you know, that's life, Hank. You know, shit comes flying at you. And you gotta deal with it. And that's what makes you you, how you deal with it.
- Beautiful. I was chopping firewood. I'm sorry about last week. I shouldn't have suggested anything I didn't like. I didn't even think about it anymore. I did. and Freddy's idea was the best, but I didn't do it justice.
As a motif I chose the poppy flower in the various stages of its development. More specifically, I examined the contradiction between beautiful and ugly. I used the technique of needle painting to depict the softness of its youth. I embroidered this flower with cotton thread. When it withers, latex runs out of it, from which morphine is made, a protection against the sorrow of the quick passing.
I should actually know every picture here. You seem to know quite a lot, at least about this. I'm trying to soak it all up as long as I can. All the history. Presidents who are obsessed with history are more obsessed with their place in it,
I need to rest. I told you that terrible things happen to those who enter the island. We thought you were just trying to scare us. I knew there was something wrong with the island. There's a darkness hiding beneath it. And the people in town seem to know about it.
Not anymore. There is no God. Certainly not with that attitude. God gave you a purpose. Not just to create art, but to become it.
They are just... meat to him. Prey. This kind of psychosis doesn't just fall through the cracks. Somewhere... someone will have noticed something. If it's a psychosis, he's kind of inside it now, tamed it, made a suit out of it.
But she has. Are you talking about Elena? She almost got herself killed today to prove a point. Remember that vampire ripper Jesse? When he attacked me, Elena had to kill him. But if there was the slightest chance that there was another way to stop him, - she would have taken it.
- What? Nothing. I was just thinking that Stefan asked me to help him go get some firewood, so I'll be right back. What? What are we going to do about the other side being forgotten and you with it?
We need to be out of here right after final exams, which I might give myself a pass on, considering the possible extinction of magic in the place where I spent my summer vacation. Okay, but surely the collapse of the other side is a bit more urgent than a late monthly payment. There is no spell. I made it up. The other side is collapsing and everyone in it, including me, will disappear forever.
I'm sorry, but we have to make sure that the doppelganger blood becomes useless. - One of you must die. - Luke, the spell has begun. The spell will continue to dissolve spirit magic as it spreads. The other side will collapse and everyone in it, including me, - will disappear forever.
- It's not just about knowing the spell. Markos was able to come back because dozens of travelers were willing to sacrifice themselves to overpower me. I doubt they'd be willing to do the same for a few supernatural strangers. You know who needs motivation? You need motivation because if the other side disappears, everyone we know there, including you, - will disappear with them.
What have you got there? A gold coin. From England. You see? It even has King Aelle's face on it.
Cold. It's going to get worse. Keep moving. Alan, if this doesn't work... If this doesn't work, we burn the base to the ground with everyone inside.
This is horrible. No wonder they're pissed about their ancestors being put on display. "The Anubis further confessed "that he wanted to steal the mummy "and give it a ceremonial burial.
Is everything okay? Did you bring Rebecca's chart? No. No, I left it at home. We're gonna use it and an old map to retrace her steps to the dungeon.
If the gun is in an evidence room, how did our victim get shot with it? My mom is definitely serious about this divorce. Okay. Today, she's serious. Danny, give her a couple of days to think about it, you know, and get it through her head....
We want to bury this, not spread it around. Have a little more respect for your godfather. You don't mind going to jail? It is better to lose the favor of men than to lose the favor of God. As you said: He who knows his vocation must do everything to live up to it.
If it's going to work, we have to be honest with each other. That goes for everything, including Vincent. I don't expect you to suddenly not care about him. You have a history. We all do. But you can't avoid it.
Ms. Jenny to steal the gun.... - What you don't believe? - I believe that... ...people like you pay six or seven figures. And since you believe in this coin... and if you do manage to get it... how are you going to keep it from affecting you?
So again, your alibi is that a mystery man... gave you the gun so your fingerprints would be on it, robbed the store, and then hid the gun, in your underwear.
No one wants to live here anymore. And after two terrorist attacks, who can blame them? This city still needs saving. And that's my vision for this company. Not just to see it rise from the ashes, but to bring this city to that new horizon with it.
Lucy suffers from delusional disorder. It is a mental illness in which the patient has a fixed delusion but no other obvious problems with thoughts or mood. I decided to drop the case during the diaper change. Sure we were doing the right thing by giving her back the doll? Taking it away from her now would only worsen her mental state.
SubCentral.com :... ...: presents: :: Criminal Minds S09E24 :... Synchro: Gaillots, Kujathemas, Blackou. It chokes. It develops such explosive power that the day it breaks through, it takes everything in its path with it.
- How do you know that? Because I was there when Shana aka A was murdered. Look... Spencer was right. It's one thing to deny Ali's story, it's another to add to it.
But when this strange looking little girl looked at me, it was the first time ever that I felt unconditional love. I knew after her first appearance that I had to keep her. My collection grew. I made a point of mothering my troupe. Most of them knew nothing of the world except how to survive in it.
He trusts the Latin man, and to me he is silent. Whatever they found in Kochkor was meaningless. He doesn't want to incriminate you. He won't tell me the truth. And what would you do with her?
You only found that out now? Before the exam time, I thought it was fine, but now that everyone else is studying in their rooms, we're falling behind while working without pay. You know who doesn't worry about exams? - This guy, because I have... - Mention the trophy again... and I'll hit you in the face with it.
After you. What can we do for you? What's wrong, Rebecca? I went to check on the windmill and someone took it apart. I went looking for it and... found it here.
You know, to store data. In this case, it is the storage of the recently deceased consciousnesses. - We are in a cloud? - A kind of cloud, yes. - And what happens to it?
There are several crash sites over 100 square kilometers. May we meet again. It's a rocket. Our ancestors used it to destroy the Earth. We will use one to get back to it.
What's going on between you? I had a relationship with her once, years ago, long before we were together. What? It was only a year. Then I broke up with her and forgot about her.
The hiding of Juliette Andraux's body and the theft of her identity are time-barred. - What about Raphaëlle's murder? - She has an alibi. And Juliette's body? What have they done with her?
Decades of rotting under the floor combined with a broken ventilation system. The previous owners never put any money into this. And you said to yourself, "I've got to have this." I saw an opportunity. To take a blight on the area and give it a new purpose.
- All my hobbies involve a gun. How's our experiment going? Very well, sir. The NYPD has arrested nearly two dozen criminals after Samaritan decrypted a host of IP addresses and anonymously emailed the information to the press. The police owe her some recognition.
Is that your serious, serious suggestion that they want to see me bathe as a reward for returning my dowry? Well, that's quite a leap. I would never speak so bluntly in front of a lady. I merely meant to say, this midnight is a very nice time for a bath. The world is so quiet then, you might almost think you're the only one in it.
You are not a friend. Or patriot. You are just a dangerous man. Well, maybe it escaped your notice, but the world is a dangerous place! And one day you will wish you had someone like me to protect you from it.
-Ooh. I've been living in a tent for the last two years. Oh, that's yes, not that. We have a sauna in the kitchen. A lot of people think that's weird, but I keep wine in it.
I see our footprints. This blade must have killed Charles Pinroth. "Kills the body, the mind... and the soul." You should take a look at this. (Somewhere under this stream is the box. Luger's digging for it on the hotel grounds.
And you have to forgive pregnant women for everything. That is the law. It's a deal! Wow! I can't wait. And we're having a going-away party for Chantry. You should say goodbye to her.
Do you know about Jorge? - I know that they were best friends. Why is the world so cruel? - I often ask myself that. It's as if it doesn't care about us.
The back door! Quick! Go! Wait! Back! We are approaching danger instead of escaping it, I can feel it.
I actually don't. No, I'm sure you don't. I've got a lot of work to do, cold calls galore, so.... Okay, so that means you're chickening out of the party? Are you kidding me? The last vagina I saw was when my daughter came out of it.
Love distorts things. Worse, love is something you never asked for. Eroticism is something I wanted and demanded from men. But this idiotic love... I felt humiliated by it, also by the dishonesty that follows from it.
- What? You want me to come down? You're messing with the electrical system of a thirty year old truck! In the middle of the desert! No food, no water! And you want me to come down? I wasn't messing with it, I was putting it out of commission for a minute.
We are a team after all. We can do it together. Chloé has a water lily in her right lung. We've seen her. She's quite big, but we're getting there.
Chloé has a water lily in her right lung. We have seen her. She's quite large, but we're getting to her. It hurts when she moves. When you put flowers around her, it scares her.
I thought you were a musician. Folk singer with a cat. Are you gay? She's not mine. I just didn't know where to put her.
But what came next was even more amazing. NASA discovered hot spots under the water. They are located in the area known as the "Conamara Chaos." This led them to believe that the presence of single-celled creatures on other planets in our solar system is not only possible, but quite likely. - I want to go ice fishing on Europa. We cut through the ice, lower a submersible which swims to the camera lens and licks it.
We can control the toxin, but the test subjects are very aggressive. There are irreparable side effects. The toxin alters the cerebral tissue. The subject is no longer in control. It affects the nerve connections and increases aggressiveness. Put a sterile rat in the cage and there is nothing left of it.
Execute me? Oui. Go ahead. I was going to go to bed early tonight. Justice is not something to joke about. I'll do anything to serve it. But if I fail, there is a higher justice.
You have truly found for yourself a refuge of the greatest calm. A refuge from the storm. Yes. The world is a vicious place, Monsieur Poirot. And there are very wicked people in it.
- Giants. 35 grand. We also need Tony's guitar. Why? Atticus Fetch. He's desperate to record with it.
Ok. Great. Thank you. Adam? How is it that the world is spinning and you're always ahead of it?
Building a wall must be well thought out. It's not just stone, cement, stone, cement.... The wall should still stand in 100 years.... It must protect children, people lean on it.
She will get well again. And she doesn't know about my power anymore? That's better. Listen, your power is getting stronger. There is beauty in it, but also great danger.
But I need to practice. - Okay. The Dominican Republic is part of an island. The other part is called Haiti. The whole island is called Hispaniola. Christopher Columbus gave it that name in 1492.
- Bye. The Dominican Republic is part of an island. The other part is called Haiti. The whole island is called Hispaniola. Christopher Columbus gave it this name in 1492.
During his trial, he had to be removed from the court for singing. He was a jerk. We had video footage of him arriving at his apartment block with a new, clearly empty suitcase, and then leaving an hour later, dragging the suitcase along the ground. With the body? What was left of it.
Coincidence? Where do you think perfect strangers all got the same idea? Bowel Disease. Haha, Q, you're developing a funny side, huh? Watch it. If you have a soul, and I bet you do, this baby will find it and connect you to it.
So my recklessness does not concern you. It concerns me because you're not just drawing attention to yourself with it. I could use a friend. Someone who can understand me. Who thinks like me and sees the world and the people in it the way I do.
Despite his immature appearance, K's methods were exceedingly sophisticated. Twisting and turning under his lashes, I felt how sophisticated his knots were. When I struggled against them, they tightened. As soon as I relaxed, they seemed to do the same. Like a cat playing with a mouse. Pretending to escape, but then attacking again.
You are not special at all. I am sorry. You expected a different answer. But the whole thing is beyond our comprehension. Would a rat in the laboratory understand the answer of a scientist who plants electrodes in its brain and causes cancer in it?
She gave you the courage... to go on. Back then, I had to give you back the hope that we could win. I could use that tulip right now. Where is it? I don't know what you did with it.
Satan's or yours? I was told that she fell from the 3rd floor. Apparently it was your grip that made her fall. Her eternal soul was released. Now we have to help her find rest.
- Aaron... - Rachel. Ben gave me this necklace. And she drove me crazy. She almost got us all killed.
There you are. Are you all right? You know, Minoru... He's not your brother. I'm sorry, but your real brother is dead. You're in denial. And you're afraid of it.
Boric acid--it burns green. I saw that on Bill Nye The Science Guy. Rex burned the same color. So that's a cause-and-effect artifact. I don't know-- he set his apartment on fire and went up in flames with it.
The nuns will hear us. A coconut throwing booth. Or at least the corresponding individual parts. Their janitor offered me to assemble it here. I see. What do you say to Sister Julienne, boys?
It says we need the instrument of the original infection. Okay, the instrument of the original infection might have been the cat's claws. - Right. - So, let's get the cat. What happened to her?
Don't listen to him, Obi. Silence! You can kill me, but you can never destroy me. It takes strength to resist the dark side. Only the weak give in to it.
You can kill me, but you can never destroy me. It takes strength to resist the dark side. Only the weak give in to it. It is much more powerful than you think. Those who can resist it are more powerful than you will ever be.
Kill the fucking Romans! Fucking shit. All shall be struck from this world. - Fuck the Romans! - As you struck Attius from it?
And hurry back to bring some more over. I'll try not to kill too many Romans without you. Have you had enough of women and wine? I am a man of the sea. And don't stay away from her for long.
It was an offering. To Spartacus. You think he's a god now? It was for his benefit. To plead for his cause. And for all those loyal to it.
I was often at odds with the Gaul. But I will miss his damned presence. I will not have it so. You still hate the man? I won't miss his presence... because I won't be far from it.
It contains everything. If you remove a single piece.... There is no circle. Your recklessness, your mistakes, are why when they say, "You can't change the world," you won't listen. The world is better off with both of us in it, Caleb,
I'm sorry, are we both hearing "Snowbird" sung by Miss Anne Murray? Yes, the woman in the song is trying to come to terms with getting older and she feels trapped because she can't do anything about it. No, no, no. I mean, you're right, she does feel trapped, but the message is positive. It's about being trapped in a bad relationship and having the courage to get out of it.
Is that really true? It sounds wonderful. It's not what you think. Magic is the reason I left. I lost everything because of her.
We are here. So your sacred thing is to steal a dwarf's pickaxe? Regina... had this in her pocket when you handed it to us. It's a trigger, and according to our people, this axe can activate it. You're going to destroy an entire city, and kill everyone in it....
Tomas. She would say anything to justify herself. I will be strong. The way to the shepherd is through the sheep. Find the impostor, squeeze out of her what she knows, and then kill her.
Tochiro. Harlock was cornered. He ordered me to activate the dark matter system. If the Earth were encased in dark matter and concealed, it would indeed become an impassable area. But what he had in mind was far too risky. Quite different from what Harlock had imagined, dark matter covered the Earth itself and cruelly deprived it of all life.
All we have is her. - The girl stays alive. - Thank you. The world is changing, Pam. We need to change with it.
When you burn down the old, new things will grow. We can create a better world, Rachel. A safer one. Yes, people have died. That's tragic. But you either let grief define you, or you learn from it.
Normally that's your usual lifestyle, but then you get married. And from then on, it's just a room. Well, the problem is my wife is in there more than I am. She said I needed a plant in there, so now she's in there at all hours saying she's taking care of the plant. You know, to fertilize, to water, and to talk to the plant. What does she say to her?
Well, of course my emotions were off. And that's why you were funnier just like Damon, who probably enjoys being in New York with Elena in an emotionless state. My brother knows what he's doing. Does he? Don't underestimate the allure of darkness, Stefan. Even the purest of hearts are drawn to it.
Liodes, do not insult the gods. I am with you, so fear nothing. Neither men nor gods. O Artemis, watch over Queen Penelope and our island of Ithaca. Restore to her the prosperity and security of old.
You are afraid. That is good. A warrior must be afraid, only he must never fall asleep with it.
- You look great in that dress. - Yeah, it's a good deal. Okay. I can do this. Focus on a moment, a memory, and just try to be there with her. You have to dive into your past to connect with her.
Yeah, I guess so. Your mom really hates change. I visited our fort today. She's in pretty good shape, you know, after five years of neglect. Yeah, I check on her from time to time.
And may she bear you a dwarf, a succubus. And may you burn in the hell reserved for the Borgias. There is no hell. And no heaven. The world is what you make of it.
Now she is hungry. But you don't take her to the same restaurant again. What is it and why is it wearing a bow tie? Probably because a tie would drag across the floor. Speaking of dragging it across the floor, maybe you could drag an antelope back to your den and sleep with it.
Chester's Mill is a place like any other. At least it used to be, until we were cut off from testing the world, by a mysterious dome. Invisible, indestructible, impenetrable. We are trapped here. We don't know where it came from, but now that we're all trapped under it, none of our secrets are safe.
No. The clinic is not far away. I will go. You come with me. You are connected to her.
No. Hey! Rose is dead. Joe and Norrie touched the dome together. They're connected to it.
Hi. - Welcome to my room. - I want you to come to the dome with me. So we can sort all this out. To see how we're really connected to it.
It's like we have powers or something. Don't you think that's amazing? That's not necessarily the word I would use. Well, you should. Let's see if we can talk to her or something.
I mean, you're just one of his employees, after all. Well, I would like to think that I am a little more than that. Yes, of course. I don't know why he's so interested in... In us? He's taken this very intense involvement in our relationship, like he's a part of it.
He bought up all the phone booths in Manhattan, but they stopped him. I don't know about you, but I don't want to see what happens when a devilish global corporation becomes omniscient. But why would you make them so vulnerable? You made the machine to protect everyone. What did you do to it that it can't protect itself?
I will take it there, please. Careful what you wish for, Ms. Groves. This community you seek may not be what you envision. This isn't about me. This is all about saving the machine not only from Decima, but from what you did to it.
How she stands there so that the light falls through her robe. Does she know we're here? Be careful when you negotiate the dowry with her father. The old man speaks of his crop more lovingly than of his daughter. But I wonder, will I be happy with her?
Fear of their fear. Fear of our courage. Thank you. Thank you, but today this is not about me. Today is about our freedom and we want to give it a face.
It's just a shallow stream, 10m wide. Listen... I'm going to take you right there and we'll all watch you. Cross the river and head straight for that line of trees on the other side. Once you're there, follow it 5km north, back to the Iranian checkpoint where we were originally going to drop you off.
Good morning, Mr. Draper. Mr. Sterling is inside. - Would you like ice? - Coffee. It's one thing to be at the bar, but it's another to be under it.
Ruth, this is my job. I understand that. But killing them should also spoil your appetite. It gives me no pleasure. A man who hates his sin can be delivered from it even if he cannot turn away from it.
I killed two people, you haven't said a word about it. What do you want me to say? It's not about what you say. It's about facing reality. It comes to us over and over again, we meet it so that we can live.
Sorry for my part in what happened today. - No, you told the truth. - No, I failed to say... I am who they say I am, Ruth. I've done every damn thing they say I've done. My father... once said to me... if you want to put the past behind you, you have to accept that you're detached from it.
It seems crazy to me, but at least it makes sense. But this massacre was just senseless and brutal. Have you ever heard anything like that in your life? A good person, a priest-to-be, just goes on a rampage, all of a sudden. I've seen a lot in my life. The world is a pretty cruel place. And that's why you should face it in the same way.
Yes, Freddy had a terrible seizure. The channel was not closed properly. And when that happens, spiritual energy can continue to act. Confused and sometimes hostile. I don't recognize anything spiritual in a man who is hit on the head and impaled. This energy can take possession of a person. It can lead him to violent acts. No one can resist it.
This way! Inspector, please believe me, for your own sake. The heart line, it never lies, sir. You know that your great passion is close to you. Follow it!
That's all we gave him. So, drinking virgin tears at moonshine was Mrs. Bolkonsky's idea. Oh, it's nothing, never mind. This energy can take possession of a person. It can lead him to violent acts. No one can resist it.
Her father is in Australia right now. We'll be moving there soon, too. At her age, foreign languages are still the best to learn. Do you like the doll? Su-ah! Give it to her.
Wait a minute, that's got her name on it. - That's fantastic! - Thank you. And this is yours. And it says...
I have just spoken to him, and it is convenient for him that you ask me to marry you. Whenever it pleases you. Before I go to him, let me ask you. Madame, is your love sturdy? You worry me. Will it bear what I impose on it?
I had the best team. And then, one day, you're hauling jam, and that's all anyone thinks about. I'm sorry. I worked hard on the jam. I wanted to take a step with her.
She says she was the one who poisoned Titus Delancey. - Crawford and Gleason are interrogating her now. - Did she say why she did it? According to her, Titus discovered her true identity a few weeks ago. He used it to try to extort sexual favors from her.
Not yet. And not if we can stop him. The Horseman of Plagues introduced this disease centuries ago... but the Roanoke colony trapped it, prevented its spread... and prevented the Horseman from advancing. She was re-triggered by Thomas. If it succeeds in spreading this time....
On the other hand, if I hadn't quit and my brothers hadn't talked me out of the job, then maybe I could have saved them. Or you would have been killed, too. And then you wouldn't have been able to save your nephew. We can't change the past even if we wanted to. We can only remember it, learn from it, and move on.
It seems that Hayden has duplicated an email that Sven has received but not yet read. He also changed it during the process. And what did the email say? The email is from an anonymous address, regarding an auction that took place today. In it, Vanger was invited to bid on number 424, but Hayden rewrote it with an invitation to bid on number 426.
I have never spent so much money to see a kitty dance. That's enough, we'll keep the cat. Hey, Han, you want a cat? You could finally have a friend your own size. Come on, you could ride her to work.
Being the superior is not something you want. It is not a gift. It is a burden. How many of the women led happy lives? They had power, but with it came the crushing responsibility for the circle.
Hey, you found out something about Bundsch, didn't you? How to get him. If not, you wouldn't have left so quietly. I took the missing girl's hairbrush out of her bag. The hair on her will just bubble with DNA.
They think I give consultants too much leeway. A friend wanted to let me know before it's too late to turn things around. I appreciate that very much. We have a mission here. It's to protect the city and all the citizens who live in it.
I want to make sure they take good care of you here. The hearing ended today. The judge recommended that I stop working with Holmes and his partner. However, it is only a recommendation. It is my decision. And I have to admit... I wrestle with it.
Oh, speaking of which, where are the figs wrapped in bacon? Maybe at the laser tag place where the real laser tag dinner will take place. Right, Theodore? Barney, there is no laser tag. We'll have a nice dinner, have a few drinks, and then, if Robin's right, as soon as she's drunk enough, her Aunt Edith will take off her wig and you'll play field hockey with her.
Okay. Then one night the cat was eaten by a coyote.... and I was an emotional wreck. You know why? - Why? Because... - Because, uh... it turns out I loved that cat and I didn't know it at all. I would have known if I had been hooked up to that EEG and had sex with her.
And I believed her. There is nothing left of me... but a burnt wick and a trail of smoke. But look at you now. So don't be afraid. The danger is averted when you look her straight in the eye.
They're dead smart. Good fish. Don't eat my feet. So, how did the tiger lady fly? She jumped on the sun... and rode off into the morning.
What if she had written a letter before she died? Saying that she preferred Harvey Dent to you? And what if, in order not to hurt you, I burned that letter? How dare you use Rachel to stop me? I'm using the truth, Master Wayne. Maybe we should all stop betraying the truth and give it its due.
Let's shut him down. Flood it. We should destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future? If the world isn't ready for it, yes. Bruce, if you want to save the world, you have to trust it.
Without any restraint. Admirable, but useless. Oh, you think darkness is your ally? For you, darkness is a weapon. I was born in it.
Admirable, but useless. Oh, you think darkness is your ally? For you, darkness is a weapon. I was born in it. Shaped by it.
Pirate? No, no. Researcher. Good old research. Can't get enough of it.
The human body is actually a battery full of bioenergy. Most of it is generated in the brain. Ben, please. How long... The first séance was a kind of beacon that lured the apparition into our world. Then we allowed it to cross over.
How about you say it first, and then me? All right, what can you do? Originally, it was people like you who went to the opera. Casual clothes. They brought food and alcohol, threw things. Anyway, that was a very long time ago. Then the rich took over the opera with their fancy wardrobe. They took away its soul and turned it into something it's not.
Come on! What makes you think I have a CD? Everyone who used to be in a RB band has their own CD in their car. Wow, now I feel really unique. - That's why you're looking for it.
I read my dad's letter. It was like my last essay. Just words on paper. This is yours. I always knew I wouldn't be here long. That's why I want to ride this wave. When I'm on it and look down, I become one with it.
You know what I did? A kitten sometimes came to us. One day I took the quail out of the cage and gave it to the cat. The cat wanted to eat it quietly in a corner. I followed her.
You have to make your dreams come true. If you don't, nothing will ever change. You think so? - Absolutely. Let your passion guide you. Let it...
"Your picture shows a face as hard as stone and as cold as the ice at the North Pole. Contempt is on your lips and an iron brutality speaks from your eyes. I felt that the page with your photo poisoned the newspaper. I put on a glove because it disgusted me to touch the page. I tore it out of the newspaper, and because I didn't want to pay it the respect of burning it, I threw it into the trash can.
Did time really pass particularly quickly back then? I can't remember and can't report anything about it. It is not true at all. Time seemed to pass quickly only to me. I think time is standing still and I am moving in it.
Do not believe your eyes! These are not human flames. This bright fire comes directly from the depths of a dark hell! Yes, I can see it, you are completely fascinated! That is the irritating thing about hell. All the world actually thinks it is reality. No, the escaping gas gives it color together with the fire!
"Mister Vanderplatt, I would like to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage. Please!" What am I supposed to say to that? I answer him promptly, "If you ever reach out your filthy hands to her, I will peel the skin off your ass alive."
You have... How shall I put it? Sterilized the creature. It's a bull, madam. It looks like a bull. It stands like a bull. But she lacks masculine strength.
Think of it as a form of payment. For what? I invited a lot of potential investors to the party tonight. And what does that have to do with me? I've come to realize that this railroad would do well to have another face associated with it other than mine.
You don't have to be like me, but.... Have you ever heard of Ralph Waldo Emerson? In school. He once said that you need a transparent eye. What he meant was that you have to take in the world and let it penetrate you.
Yes? I'm proud of you. You, uh... Bruce? In the end, all that remains is to seek the truth, learn from it, and above all, defend it.
What did you do? I touched her pussy. Did you like it? Yes, it was so soft. Almost no hair... then I smelled her... she smelled like pee.
Okay. I can now... do the full separation. Wait. What about complications? What if there's a double hemivertebra...or a tethered suture? We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
Nothing ever changes here, it seems. Revolutions break out, monarchies collapse. But the groom and bride still don't see each other before the wedding. You Americans will probably never understand how significant tradition is to us. But of course. But we don't let it have power over us.
Ah, not at all. I don't mind airports anymore. Got used to it when your mom and I broke up. - Why? - Ah. Every time she had a party or event or something, I had to fly out to see her to maintain the facade that our marriage was fine and we were still the perfect couple.
They pay me to protect you, right now that would be from yourself. What's the problem, guys? Listen to me. Every minute we waste sitting around here waiting for a boat that's never gonna come could be the difference between finding my father dead or alive. We finally have a real lead, so we'll follow it on foot if we have to.
That you may know, this is no loose, unrhymed claim. Rediscovered in the worm food of long vanished days, buried by the dust of oblivion, he sends you this most memorable row, in every branch truly convincing. Survey this family tree, and if you find it directly descended from the most glorious of the highly famous ancestors, Edward the Third, he expects renunciation of crown and kingdom, which you unlawfully withhold from him as a born owner. Otherwise, what will happen? Bloody coercion. Even if you hide the crown in your heart, he will dig for it.
O God of battles, steel my warriors' hearts! Do not fill them with fear! Remove from their minds the sense of reckoning, when the enemy's superiority deprives them of their heart. Not today, O Lord, O not today, please do not remember my father's transgression when he seized the crown! I buried the corpse anew of Richard, and consecrated more contrite tears to it, than drops of blood flowed violently from it.
Something happens to you at 148 km/h. The thunder of the cylinder heads drowns out all sounds. The engine vibrations match the heartbeat. The view is limited to the immediate. And suddenly you're no longer on the road, you're in it, part of it.
Yes, it's used for making-ofs. And no one was supposed to know that? She wanted to make a documentary about her work. To present herself to the outside world. I helped her with that. There's enough material for 12 hours.
I wish I could love you. In a perfect world, I would. But the world is perfect. Helena. She is what we make her.
You are beautiful. Thank you. What's wrong with you today? You're not wearing your blouse. Is that why? I spilled something on it.
Mom, tell him. So much for the possibility of an amicable divorce. Well, she'll finalize it quietly. I'll make sure of it. Need I remind you what happened to the company the last time David Clarke's name was associated with it?
- Can I help? This is harder than it looks. You know what, it's too short. I have a real tie that I wore to a costume party once. Can you look in the closet for it?
So I had to think fast. The flag. Of course. - I was expecting you. - Take me to her.
Ellen! - They found me. - Who? Trust Sam. I've spent the last decade of my life hiding from the truth. I'm finally ready to face it, and I'll be damned if I'm going to back down now because you think I can't help you.
- Why is that? - Because I'm standing here, talking to the man who doesn't want to be found. Sam, no one wants to get these people more than I do. I've spent the last decade of my life hiding from the truth. I'm finally ready to face it, and I'll be damned if I'm going to back down now because you think I can't help you.
She is waiting in Shanghai for me to agree to the contract. And you have a problem with this arranged marriage? I have a problem with marrying into an opium trade. My father smoked opium. When he took up the pipe, it destroyed him.
Today is orientation day. If you still want me to go to Collins with you. Of course. Declan, could you think hard about the hooded figure? According to Charlotte, you might have seen a woman in the dark.
Because she saved you. All of you! And because no matter what Regina did, nothing justifies this. We are not murderers. We're not of this world. But you're in it now.
Tell me... Why is the FBI interested? What's got you interested? Do you want to expose the CIA? Yes, I want to expose the CIA for what it's become, but... but most of all, I want to catch him.
- Can you hear what I'm saying? - Did she enjoy the party? I, uh... - Yeah, she did. Yes, she liked it.
What the hell? - How were we supposed to know you'd show up? You fucking bitch! You got one, Rauschebart, I'll shoot you a second time. I'm sorry, but I told you the orchard wasn't what you think it is.
When I dress like this, I cannot be recognized. This allows me to see the real you. Grandmaster. Chen Kung Fu comes from life, it is part of our everyday life. The best way to live is to live with nature, and learn from it.
Amazing. We've managed to perfect the apple... a genetically modified version that never turns brown. And yet, we have not yet improved upon man. The human race has stalled, Harold. And from what I've seen, most of it is rotten to the core.
I was just trying to protect you. By lying to me about the most important thing in my life? That lie was the only thing protecting you. Castle, I didn't need protection. I needed a lead. And you sat on it for a whole year.
Where are we? It's a small island that our captors think is a sanctuary. Sanctuary? From what? The world is dangerous. - What's left of it, anyway... - Well, they can't keep us down here.
Looks like he's had too much to drink. I bet you wouldn't believe me if I told you he was a violin prodigy, and played 2 years with the Philharmonic. His fondness for the bottle ended his career. How exactly does that help with terrorism? Before I can teach the machine to find bad people, I had to teach it to distinguish people in general.
You are worrying about the wrong things. It's not your fault. The Restons are not victims. My family stole from this town. They hurt the people in it.
Let's blame it on the air pressure.... and not talk about it anymore? I know what you did. Thank you for protecting me. Protecting us. Although I don't fully understand your work... ...I feel a part of it.
When it's over, we can all just disappear. "Hell hath no fury..." Don't you, Jordan? I'm not here for Nathan. Yeah, right. If this barn goes away, my problem with it goes away.
He belongs here now, like his mother. Why? Why do I belong here? Think of the barn as an amplifier for you. When you're in it, your energy... keeps the problems at bay.
Oswin, there is a Dalek ship in orbit. Yes, I have it on sensors. The Asylum has a force-field. The Daleks up there are waiting for me to turn it off. But as soon as I do, they'll incinerate this world, and us with it.
You'd better go now. I like your story. And the way you tell it. You want to be a part of it. If you're a part of it, you're dead.
You want to be a part of it. If you are a part of it, you are dead. I wanted to kill her. Do you? No. I just want to be a part of it.
Nothing yet. Shouldn't we call the bomb squad? No time. It's got a cell phone trigger. The call could come in any second. John, you need to get away from her now.
Finch, I've got a sniper at 0600. I'll take care of the wife. I'm not sure Mrs. Drake is the sniper's target, Mr. Reese. She just sent a text to an anonymous number. It just says, "now."
So, what are you trying to say? The battery is four years old. These scraps of newspaper are four years old. The bomb that went off today was four years old. But why would the suspect build a bomb and then sit on it for four years?
If not the cure, then what? I'm doing this for Silas, okay? So far, he's been nothing but a myth. - Write a dissertation. - Better the one writing about Noah's ark, or the one sailing down the Hudson on it?
You promised me you would never do that. Until recently, I didn't need my gift to know what was going on inside you. Charles, I used to think it was you and me against the world. But no matter how bad the world is, you don't want to be against it. You want to be a part of it.
Confession can bring us redemption, you see, Katie? It's good for the soul. I guess you already know, I sang songs of the English. And I've been fibbing to my dad, too. He told me to get off the guitar, but I secretly played it.
Go Franklin. I signed up for their spring musical festival when the actual director suddenly fell mysteriously ill. It was a blessing for them. Her show lacked a focus. I gave her a theme.
- Jesus. - Don't try to talk me out of it! - Well? - Bender, you always say you're going to kill yourself, but you almost never do. Yes. The last time you went to the suicide booth, you ended up going out with her for six months.
If Prioleau finds out I asked about this case, he'll know I'm your bitch. I'll be damned. I saw this guy playing trumpet last night in a little club far from the French Quarter. You're getting to know the city, I see. Oh, I love the city... What's left of it.
My father is dying. And the dark elf? He is dead. My brother killed him. I warned your father not to give him sanctuary. There are many who seek this weapon. Because with it, even the weak can rise against Jötunheim.
that's not Eric's fault. Yes, it is. You knew what she was going through. All right, you knew what happened to her. You were supposed to be her teacher, not some lunatic taking advantage of a kid that wouldn't recognize a healthy relationship if it was sitting right next to her in free period.
Is that so, Father? Yet vanity has taken possession of you. How so? You have done what you were forbidden to do. You chose the dark side and allowed it to feed your greed for power and your anger.
I think that's what he wanted. That's why he hid the plate instead of using it. If he really wanted out, he could have destroyed the plate. I don't know. The temptation of one last big score is strong. - Ford can't resist it.
But you did. And I am. You followed the trail. The one you left behind. But what if I had known you couldn't wait to follow it?
I have always dismissed that as a fantasy. It can't be explained purely scientifically either. It is too complex. Nothing is too complex for our technology. In the lab, we'll get to the bottom of it.
What would Freud say about that? I didn't name them that way. My neighbor did. She died and I felt bad. Sarah would perish Sarah in the shelter. Who wants a cat that squawks when you're not home to give it a shot twice a day?
It's not right to just leave them here. Our mission must have priority and besides, it could be a trap. Or an opportunity. Porter sent us for information on this facility. This woman has been living next door to it for months.
- We have to abort. - Negative. - We've got Marcus in our sights. - He's not in the plan. Tell her if we can't cut the head off the beast, we can at least cut off her right hand.
You can learn to adapt to their natural laws and behave accordingly - thus contributing to a better quality of life and sustainability on a consistent basis... Or you can try to swim against the current - without any benefit for yourself or others. It doesn't matter how much you believe you can get up right now and run up the nearest wall - the law of gravity won't allow it. the law of gravity won't allow it. If you are not touched as an infant - you will die. As harsh as this may sound - nature is a dictatorship. And we can either listen to it and come into harmony with it or suffer the inevitable negative consequences.
Thomas makes promises, for a place for us, here. And more and more of us are ready to listen. I hope you're not talking about yourself, Carlos. I gave you the gun. I'm not pointing it at you.
A soul came to him who wants to help him. She comes from a distant land. Maybe. Should I get it out of the way? A soul becomes even more dangerous when it becomes a ghost.
Yes, it's an excuse. You're a complete idiot sometimes. Yeah, that's true. I'll tell you what. I got a lead on Sophia. I'm gonna follow it up now.
- What? That he's thinking about it. Two months and five days. - And the cat? - What about her?
Way down in your nooks and crannies...someone's pretty oily. So hey, I hate to interrupt your conversation. This wasn't a conversation, Lana. I was just talking about my gun, not to her.
If you were indifferent to me, you would have said it long ago. Oh, I see. I don't want to put you out of work, so I must love you madly. Isn't it true? You say I'm a free spirit, which I hope is true, but you want me to give up my whole world and everyone in it for you.
Maybe in your childhood it will be normal to have lesbian grannies. I just hope that she will be happy. This family has not inherited happiness. But, unfortunately, this is the family you inherit from me. HELGE STORAAS ATTACKED BY EFFECTIVE EX I tried to run away from her.
And it's in... Out in Davie. But don't waste your time. She's been abandoned for over 20 years now. There's not much left of her.
The country is much larger than indicated on the map. The fear grows that the land will deny us passage. Shortly after, however, we discover the sea to the southeast and row back to the ship to tell Willem Barents about it. This northern route takes us right across the ice. And you want to follow it further, Willem?
It's life-threatening. Okay, thank you. That's it. Keith Johnstone says that when we put on the mask, we go into a trance. For a moment we are possessed by it.
- You're sure Stefan is still with him. Easy to be sure when the alternative is that he's dead. Are you still ok with the couch? Yeah. I'm fine. Because you spent half the summer on it.
It lies in the quality. If he goes abroad, he'll kill the goose that laid the damn golden engine. Wait a minute. I thought you didn't build an emotional connection with clients. I have an emotional attachment to me. I made a bet that this firm would grow and my billable hours with it.
Everybody loves. XOXO, Gossip Girl. To overcome your fears is to face what you fear the most. You have to venture into the lion's den and risk a step into an uncertain future. But if you always repress your fear, you run the risk of being swallowed up by it.
What is a shelf company? This is a company that exists only on paper and so the owner can hide his assets. - Isn't it a shell company? - No, it's a shelf company. Okay, take a shell company, give it a bank account, credit history, tax returns, and let it sit on a shelf for years.
So don't play the bankrupt farmer. All right. Five percent for the first month... and 15% if it takes longer. Deal. We'll want to see the new merchandise to familiarize ourselves with it.
What do you want to know? Well, Elijah said that your father was a landowner in Europe. How did you get here? My parents had just started a family when a plague hit their homeland. They lost a child to it.
Queen in front of the tower on seven. Hey. You're House, right? I got these weird pains in my elbows... - and in my knees... - You know what's weirder? That the infirmary is one big room, and you're confusing me with it.
It looks for intent. We built it to stop terrorists before they can act. But a machine doesn't understand the difference between those crimes that are relevant to national security and those that are irrelevant. Irrelevant? So you taught it the difference.
Because I've never seen a real one. Once a homeless man showed me his "Purple Head", but thinking about it, I'm not so sure it was really from the military. Pfft. I didn't even want that stupid medal. You know what I did with it?
Are you really serious about taking that job at the Stowaway? At this moment, I'm only serious about taking you into the bedroom. Then what are you waiting for? Guilt is a powerful burden. You can try to turn your back on it, but that's when it sneaks up behind you and eats you alive.
Unwilling or unable to justify the role they play in it. Others run away from their guilt, stripping away their conscience until there is no conscience left at all. Help! But I run toward my guilt. I feed on it.
Dad? ! What? Great! That's cool! Remember, you have to be gentle with the machine. Treat her with lots of love. I'll give her a big goodnight kiss every night.
I failed because I thought I was better than Greendale. See, I went to college, so I thought it was my job to make this place better. But it turns out, the only bad thing about Greendale is that it's run by an insecure wreck who runs five dance events and talent shows a year because he's afraid the school isn't good enough. However, Greendale is good enough because it accepts me for what I am not. Greendale is the best school in the entire world and I am so sorry for what I did to it.
However, Greendale is good enough because it accepts me for what I am not. Greendale is the best school in the entire world and I am so sorry for what I have done to it. And I apologize for what I did to the ice cream machine. Aah! Please, no one should eat out of it until you clean the nozzles.
(LAUGHS) I am no longer naive enough to be a Jedi. A new force is rising. I foresaw it. The Jedi will lose this war and the Republic will collapse. A new order will take its place. And I will rule a part of it.
But the Arcadian has found a way to free the monsters from their bonds. We must destroy this weapon at all costs. But how are we going to do that, Merlin? As long as the book was in my possession, I did everything in my power to destroy it. Fine! So we're supposed to run blindly against a weapon of dark magic so powerful that we don't know what to do with it if we ever get our hands on it!
today he will announce something special as you know i am going to start a new movie i want to introduce a new face it can be you or you. each one i can tell you for hero role of this movie we are going to do a big talent hunt millions of indians are taking part in it only one talented actor got his place
We're starting from scratch. You're serious about this, aren't you? Yes. What about your work? Well, what about it?
Only your appearance leaves a little to be desired. Please, Counselor. So... Why don't you write to her first? If I write to her first, I deprive her of the opportunity to write to me first.
You disparage the memory of him by wearing his face, but you're nothing like him. Turns out he was right about just about everything. I just wish I could have told him that when he was alive. He wasn't right about anything, Jack. And when this island sinks to the bottom of the ocean, and you with it, you'll finally realize that.
- Think you can get the boat across in time? Good luck, James. Thanks, doc. For everything. James! If the island's going down, I'm going down with it.
Where were they when Titus laid hands on me? I still carry his child. Nothing has changed, Varro. The whole world has changed. And I with it.
It's midnight, Jack There's a big storm up here I have a certain respect For this atomic bomb When I stand next to it
I would never have bet on Spiro's injury. - But you did. - Yes, I did. Take your winnings. The whole world is ending and Manchester United with it.
{\pos(192,220)}He said you are a very good doctor. Do you want something to eat? I'm fine. How's work going? Are you happy with it?
And now you're talking about a seizure disorder? Which is also not a poison. But it is most likely caused by an old injury to the brain. Why do you only see your past as such a threat? Not only am I not threatened by it, I've even tried to get it back.
Romance or not, Charlie was a good man! Another outburst like that -- Then what? Charlie was special. The world was better because she walked on it.
The stones. I never slip. I never stumble. I can walk in the dark without getting lost. I live with this world, not just in it, so I say.
she is the best at knife fighting. Nice to meet you. And this... is Virgil Junior! How a man knows what a woman's got in her belly, I'll never know! It's simple; he put it in her!
This is the type of man I would follow into war. Because he flirted with them all the time. Well, it gave me a baseline. This is a guy who's going to be deployed in the war again in 3 days. His voice, the pride in it?
- Nothing, my dashboard. - I'm in the car, on a road. - Fine, a road. It's a road to you. Follow it, Dean.
I never showed the proof of my discovery to anyone. Actually, the film is not developed at all. I was obsessed with this creature I tried to track it down as it jumped from bush to bush. I tried to communicate with it.
Listen, uh... I'm... I'm... I'm running out of ways to explain this to you... but I want to try again. This fly is a huge problem for us. It's going to ruin our shipment. We need to destroy it now and any trace of it... so we can cook.
A door. Why not a door? Sometimes you get fixated on something and you don't even understand why. You open yourself up and go with the flow.... wherever the universe takes you. Okay, so the universe took her to a door,... ...and she became obsessed with it... and just had to paint it 20 times before it was perfect.
It is not the Jedi code to extinguish innocent life. - Especially when it is the last. - Chancellor Palpatine, I would think it best to examine this creature. The outer layer seems indestructible. Weapons cannot harm it.
- You can't really mean that. - Yes, I do. You're a damn good chef. I'm better than good, but this town conquers me. As much as I love it, I'm not going to bother with it anymore.
But he does. What does the darkness have to do with me not calling back? Don't you understand? Your darkness is the past. And you are holding on to it and living in it.
No, Your Majesty. The men died of bloody discharge. Dysentery? Yes, Your Majesty. I fear we have an outbreak... of this disease throughout the army. Heaven knows how many will succumb.
- The hand, Sam. - I know. Whoever cut off Rosens didn't take it like they did with Porter. - Why? - Didn't need to. - There was no briefcase attached to it.
Yes, I'm going. Peter, you can't. It's too dangerous. The box is our responsibility, Walter. And if I can get to it, I can probably destroy it.
I drove around with her for two hours, talking like a fool. Then it's time, I take out the gold chain, she accepts it. I kiss her. You hero! It's mine now, you know?
The disappearance of bees leaves a trail of mystery and fear If we kill all the bees, there will be no more agriculture. I repeat: no agriculture. The pollination of plants by bees guarantees the growth and survival of fruits. The honey bee is important because the pollination of 40% of our food depends on it. A huge percentage of our food.
So now, with the Colony Collapse Disorder, it is clear that Steiner's prediction has come true. And as Steiner said, our lives depend on beekeeping. Everyone should be interested in beekeeping. Our life depends on it!
Sir, it is illegal to drive on this highway with a bus. But... but... but... but... but... Sir, do you know that it is illegal to drive a bus on this road? I don't know that, man. They told me I could take the West Side freeway, so I'm on it.
Jazz musicians take a bath. What? - What are you doing to the sauce? - It needs more pep. The only pep it needs is the pep your father gave it 36 years ago when he... when he wrote the recipe on an upside-down cleaning bucket. Just try.
What are you talking about? What college? Are you talking about Dartmouth? I don't know, Mom, but I'm certainly not telling you. I'm tired of running away from my future. It's time I start going towards it, no matter how far away it is from here!
- Beautiful. - Yes. Nothing has changed. I am dead. And the city still looks the same. As far as the world knows, you no longer dwell on it, but it keeps spinning?
Boys are mean. I missed being in the Brooke bubble. Sure you do. Cause it's the best place. Not that I've ever been out of it.
- Why are you here? - Well, they called and said they needed a supervisor. I'm on the substitute list. Are you? - Since when? - Well, since they cut my hours at the gallery and I have to pay rent to live above it.
And he recognized her DNA when he saw it. It is called a handbag, and every woman knows that you can put anything in it. An individual cell phone, a novel or even urgent medication. No matter what is in it, one thing is as clear as day, every handbag says something about its respective owner,
It is called a handbag, and every woman knows that you can put everything in it. A baby bottle, a check with which to buy protection, or a gift for a new friend. No matter what is inside, one thing is as clear as day, every handbag says something about its respective owner,
Work work work. She loves America. Mel Burke, how do you do it all? I just do it. If there's a challenge in front of me, I meet it.
But Barney hasn't yet.... Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of style, or that it's been adopted by the lesbian community. You stay true to it.
Well, he was wearing one. That still left two missing, and only one person would.... for use... have such a personal item. Yuri took it with him? Yes. Yes. I guess when you find a good wig, you get very attached to it.
No, yeah. That's actually a pretty serious thing. The patient might just reject the arms... not physically, but emotionally. The very first hand transplant recipient... ultimately asked to have his hand taken back. He said he couldn't get a connection to it.
A cargo helicopter transports spruce trees from the national park that are infested with bark beetles. In itself, national park biologists want to prevent human interference with natural processes here. even when pests threaten to destroy the forest. Adjacent forest owners. However, nature lovers and all those who make a living from tourism here have forced the removal of infested trees, at least in the peripheral zones of the national park, so that the bark beetles do not spread to neighboring forests. The bark beetles in Berchtesgaden raise the question: How untouched can we leave our nature without losing the fun in it?
Anyway, he wasn't able to lock me in the crypt that night, in the morning I found your brother's body in a ditch not far from the estate. He had been torn to pieces. I know now that it was a mistake to lock up the beast. Don't you agree, Lawrence? I should have let it run free.
No. It is hell. Hell? The beast is the beast. Let it run free.
But how can you conquer the world on an empty stomach? The invention of agriculture was a turning point in our history. It happened only 10,0000 years ago. Agriculture was our first great revolution. With it came the first surpluses, the first cities and civilizations.
I'm sending a postcard From Paradise Falls. We're on our way, Ellie. It's Russell. What are you doing here? I found the snipe and followed it under the porch.
We'll read more next week. - Go to the bathroom again. - Why don't you go up here? How's she doing in school? Fine. She likes it.
- This is an impressive find. - There's no one left here. I can give you a quick demonstration of how it works. Basically, there used to be a cow hanging from the ceiling here, so you can see it. However, there's very little of her left... because all these lines supply nutrients to the shrimp eggs.
It's not top secret, Major. I'm meeting Condoleeza for a few cocktails. Even I have friends. Sorry I let Chuck do the music thing. But an apology is just words if it's not followed by action.
It's about my little nephew, Bucky. Overdose. Where's Bucky, and what did he take? This new street drug. All the kids are falling prey to it.
That's our specialty, after all. - Dean. - I'm tired of burying friends. Look, this trail is fresh. And we're gonna follow it, I know.
- I know. - Hi, man. - Hi. I brought some beef broth for Kate, and a Family Guy DVD. She says she doesn't like it, but she should give it a chance.
And to reject religion. But when it comes down to it, I sit here and pray for a miracle to spare my wife. It may not be a miracle, but I think I know a way to help her. Adam Baylin's formula. - From the tank. I can inject it into her...
My ashes were scattered over grass I once walked on, under trees that had once given me shade, on roses I once admired, and beside fences I once chatted over. After my friends said goodbye to me, a wind came up and blew my remains into the air. I looked down at the world and let go of it.
Honestly, she's a modern day Mother Theresa. Your methods of digging up gossip are as old as your haircut. We've looked everywhere. My fingers are sore. When the truth disappoints you, you just have to turn away from it.
Don't move. Last week, a gun was found in a boy's locker. He was 15 years old. Where did he get it? What was he going to do with it?
Back! Arthur! Arthur! Stay away from her, you nigger! They say military training is good not only for preparing a man for battle, but also for making him crave it.
Just with my mom, and I never saw my dad again. And when I was back in England and asked my mom about this place, right? She said it wasn't real, that I had just made it up. So... that's why I became an anthropologist, to find this island again. I've been looking for it all my life.
Who else? - Hans von Rottinger, Fredrik Clinton. One is dead, the other retired. Both were active in the group in the 70s and 80s. - "Group?" We should give it a name.
Billy,Zoe,I'm starting to analyze the aftermath of the fire. Are you sure it was arson? Yes,and I've isolated the accelerant. Whoever set the fire left a chemically significant trail. Can you follow it?
Stand trial, you mean? You should take a look at this. It describes some cognitive techniques that I think will help you a lot. It's very helpful in relieving stress, panic... and definitely anxiety. You know, I'd like to start by figuring out exactly what you're afraid of, and then we can isolate the fear, work with it, confront it.
Go! Whenever someone comes to the island, the others practically act like hermit crabs, mercerizing them and grabbing their stuff. So they have access to satellites, they live in houses and have little book club rounds, and this submarine that went back and forth between the island and the real world. So they are able to leave the island if they want to, and they were very unhappy about the fact that these survivors landed on their island. This is our island and the only reason you live on it is because we let you live on it.
- I love you. The power source failed. It was all we had. For reasons we don't know, the island is invisible. If you fly over it, you can't see it. Satellites can't take pictures of it either.
Okay, thank you, bye. Arnold, that's very exciting. How did you get a hold of him? Let me tell you something, Ron. Um, there's a simple formula for success and I followed it.
I never wanted to give people an answer when they asked me if it was a real penetration because that is a matter of an actor's way of working. Thinking back on the film, I can say that it was very agonizing because in my naivety I thought about how to make the sexual intercourse believable by showing the sexual act but also the rest right after the ejaculation and also the tenderness towards such an unlikely partner. It was necessary to show sexuality like a true adventure within his humanity. At the end of the film we see a ladder. We see her for the first time when he fishes out the sow with her from the pit into which she had thrown herself for her suicide and, one could say, had gone through the pit into the earth.
The wirsunggang is slightly enlarged, but still in the normal range. Say something! She is mute. She can't communicate with you. Maybe you should try to communicate with her.
It's just a wonderful way to see the world and pursue ancient mysteries. And it was really the catalyst for what people like me are doing today, and that is talking about the mysteries, the unusual and the paranormal. He pointed a way for all of us to talk about these strange stories and it just kept growing and growing and growing. People want answers to questions they can't answer for themselves. But regardless of the book's enormous popularity, or perhaps because of it, Von Däniken's theories were ridiculed by scientists, and scorned by theologians.
and if the fine people only thought how beautiful poets waste their time they would even... ? what's going on out there You probably never got out of town Bride and I, we've spent many years here A strange atmosphere lies over the area, but we've become one with it
Also known as bull nettle, the devil's tomato, and, my favorite expression, the apple of Sodom. Is quite poisonous. But in tiny doses, a tasty addition to any wine-based sauce. Mmm. Gives it the pungent taste of madness.
Others drink it and think about the man they may love. But one woman in particular has to wait with her cup of coffee that morning. Because she discovers a neighbor who has worries. She helps her, not only because it's the right thing to do, but because it's the only way she can think of to ask for forgiveness. When she has been forgiven.... her day begins too.
Right, even though you're sorry, you're still a snoot with a big ego who thinks his time is too precious to waste talking about a homeless man for five minutes. That's not the reason. Then why can't you do it? Because I'm not allowed to,okay? There's an ongoing investigation,and I'm a part of it.
We are all doctors here. It's a personality thing. I've seen you long enough to see that you're good. But you sit back, you observe, then you decide. I act. I'm not going to stand outside a room and watch my life pass me by, and I'm not going to stand there and watch this patient die. This isn't about court proceedings or red tape or hospital bureaucracy. This is about a woman who came to us for help. And we couldn't help her.
She is a cruel, vicious creature. She keeps me in chains. She hurts me. Her magic. I cannot escape her.
At least with me there was no risk. - For the painting job. - This is a gift. Originally it was an order. If you don't want it, you can send it to Rita or bring it to her.
They... what, they expected violence? The convergence theory says that when crowds behave aggressively, it's because people bring there an aggressive mindset. And in the close-ups, you can see their faces. They are identical to those of athletes during a competition. That crowd was a powder keg and someone in it was the spark.
In a sense, the Führer and Goebbels said the same thing. However, we differ in that I do not consider the comparison an insult. Just think for a moment what kind of world a rat lives in. In a rather hostile world, yes. Suppose a rat came rushing in the door, wouldn't you meet it with hostility?
No one from the outside could have come near him. It was someone on the inside. And we cannot trust anyone. Holy Father... when I was a child, you told me that the voice in my heart was God's voice. And I should follow it, however painful it was.
This one enacted a law that called for death for a crime.... unless the offender was a maiden. Well, one day when a spinster was accused... the emperor didn't know how to handle it. One of his advisors had the perfect solution: let's deprive her first of her flower and then... their lives. There are some... and, no, I won't name them... that make us first be for the coronation... then preach on it, then write books defending it.
We don't know each other very well yet, but that should change. I am convinced of that. It is His Majesty's wish... to appoint you a royal chamberlain. In this position, you will assist His Majesty on a daily basis... ...and carry out his wishes. You understand the peculiarity and privilege of this position.
You are no longer commander. As long as I am the leader of this group, you will obey my orders. There are no complaints here, no sitting around. And no doing nothing. Any of you who want to leave, leave. You will take his body to the woods.
- Good day, Mr. Mayor. The strange thing, however, was that in my village there was an extremely special tradition. A tradition that was supposed to bring happiness to everyone. Nobody knew how it came about. But everyone adhered to it without questioning it.
Then this is what I will do. No one will stand in your way. You will not even see us. But do this one thing for me. When you return to the mainland, tell someone in charge that there's an island here. And on it is a man desperately trying to get home to the ones he loves.
It is cursed. Burying it won't do any good then. Hmm. My happiness lies somewhere else and my destiny is clear. Here is an island and on it, there is a man, ill with the longing to return to the people he loves.
But to hunt cats hardly makes sense. They don't follow rules and are always climbing trees. A habit that I particularly detest. Horses, on the other hand, understand the rules perfectly. And they possess something like fighting spirit. But of all the creatures a dog can chase, sheep are the best! Sheep mean pleasure. Their fear wafts behind them like a cloud of scent, and you breathe it in as you chase them until you are intoxicated by it. It's like you're not walking, but floating on it.
- Come on. - Let's go. We're going to Vegas. We've been driving for over an hour and there's not a freeway in sight. That's because we're driving right parallel to it, honey.
You know, like on the TV show. You're way too young for that show. We have it on DVD. My mom's boyfriend watches it all the time. - What do you think of her?
Unless it has created another false image. Wait, wait. Everything about her was a lie. All her vital signs were a false image. She can trick the equipment, tell it what we expect to see, so when it gets scared, it projects an increased heartbeat, we try to freeze it, and it does the opposite.
What I can be. Fix them. I know nothing about watches. If you want to learn to use my ability, fix the clock. Listen to her.
I can't. No. Stop. You think you can stop me with one power? I can not only stop you, I can kill you. I'll drill into your head, find your worst fear, and let it eat you alive.
Where this whacky slime head straight out of your.... - Bobby. - Yeah, Charlie. - Murder weapon? - Haven't found it yet. I'll get back to looking for it.
Really. Life S02E06 'Did you feel that? Rushing through the world only leads to chaos. Allowing it to come to you leads to peace.
This time he has to work for me. I'm not going to give him a choice. Okay, if you have anything you want to say to Owen, now's your chance. Owen, it's Jack. it's me, Jack, can you hear me? Owen, follow my voice, hold on to it. Let it pull you out, let it pull you out.
I have a new job. I'm head of security for Mark Moran, all right? Hey, that's true. I got big plans, buddy. I'm gonna grab this town by the collar and shake the shit out of it.
- Oxygen at 15 liters. - Sats 85. Tachy at 135. PRATT: Prep for intubation. - Etomidate and sux. - I'll give it to her.
AIDS is not as big a problem as it once was. There have been advances in treatment... Not a big problem? Is that what everyone thinks? People need to understand the importance of this disease and the bravery of the people who have to fight with it.
No problem. They said they got a break in the case. You heard Nazir was killed? We found the bullet. Now all we need is a gun that matches it.
I suffer and at the same time I bathe in an ocean of supreme bliss. The joy is immeasurable. I hear: "My daughter, your soul is no longer alive. "From now on, I live in her."
Molecular recomposition halted. Impending collision. Billy, open the damn door! I can't override the emergency system. Billy, if that door doesn't open right now, I'm going to collide with it.
I don't like to sleep. Not when I'm awake. Your file says you have insomnia. What else does my file say about me? Not much... considering I've been writing it for ten years.
The turtle. What turtle? It was lying on its back, on the road in Mexico. - Your mother turned her over. - She helped her.
We took the sacrifice away from her. She had to complete his work. Wendell Berry once said, "The past defines who we are. We may strive for good reason to escape it or what is bad about it, but we will escape it only by adding something better to it."
Maybe from now on. Hopefully. Will she be able to cope? Yes, she will cope. Maybe you have to face the past first before you can run away from it.
But even the smallest casualties may prevent you from breaking through Grievou's defenses. Master Plo is right. Grievous on the bridge of this ship is the best protection they have. Don't worry, Ahsoka. We'll destroy the bridge, and Grievous will go down with it.
When I have to get something out of the bag, I say: I'm not touching that thing. The bag makes strange noises. You've had entire farm implements come out of it. Even when the bag appears to be empty, it conjures up a ball on it.
The fountain of Etoch. Look inside. Don't leave anyone alive! You have to take care of yourself now, kid. We can't change the past, but we can decide what we want to learn from it.
Help! Somebody help me! Somebody help me, please! Help! We can't change the past, but we can decide what we want to learn from it.
Your father would be proud of you. I'm ready. Get off the roof. Ironic, Tony. You wanted to rid the world of guns, and you gave it the best.
What do you want? Tell me your name. Follow me. Your father left you this map. He said it hides the secret location of the Golden Army.
Keep going! Keep going! Oh, my God. You should have seen this city when she was alive. - What happened to her?
After all, he is just a mask. Today is the last round in Death Race and maybe there will be a new champion. A five-time winner. The first man ever to win his freedom. The world sent you here because you were not ready to be a part of it.
- I'll take a canister in a minute. Aphrodite's Fountain? Do you really want boatloads of tourists? Oh, no, not boatloads, but you know, a few more wouldn't be bad. Okay, so, first, the toilet. If the flush doesn't work, then just go, and when you come back, then....
- You laugh at that? - Of course I am. Aren't you? No! There was a future. You're standing on it.
Yes, that's right. So, Emily's what now? Like your college sweetheart? What? - It's impressive how you pull that off - What? The way you take the simplest statement and twist it in a way that gives it a negative connotation.
And those were our battle buddies. Gilligan was the one on the box of wires. He was accused of killing two CIA agents. It was his box. He had to hold it, stand on it.
Because of the map? - Yes, it could be. Did you find out anything? - Yes, there's no doubt. That's the treasure map! Besides the bandits, the Japanese army is also after it. In fact, they're all after it.
Sentimental things. A tuft of hair from our dog. Tickets from operas I've been to. It wasn't stolen for its contents. It was just this can. It was valuable. What you could do with it.
Just like the Council. And I probably had the shortest presidency ever. Yes, now, don't act so relieved, Mr. Adama. You were faced with a crisis and you knew exactly what to do. You bravely faced it.
- but you need to come with me right now. - The baby is not Jin's. I'm going to take a look at your baby and determine the day of conception. If you got pregnant here... We will cross that bridge when we come to it.
Meet Kevin Johnson. You're joining the crew in Fiji as a deckhand. You want me to go undercover? Why the hell would I work for you? Because if Widmore finds the island, it's good night for everyone on it.
Just ask him to wait a little longer. But I just got cleaned up. O'malley,ask him. Yes,ma'am. A person can only climb so high. Well,I'm climbing above it,but there's a ceiling,and I'm going to bump into it.
All right, I'll check on you later. I'll be outside if you need me, all right? Kyle, um... Living here alone like this, I've relied on both of them all these years. Taylor made it possible for my dreams to come true. He brings every useful idea I have to the outside world, and it's Foss' job to protect me from it.
You have a lot to learn. I won't be able to, not in this house. Kyle, you can't go back to the Tragers. If I stay here, sure, but locked up, I might as well have stayed in that tank. I won't be able to touch the world, like Adam said, if I'm not a part of it.
I, here... Were you really trying to do something good just to help me? I was selfish. I always told you I was unselfish, but I know deep down, I was only ever unselfish for selfish reasons. I just thought my world would be a better place if you were in it.
To be exact, it was like this. - Ockham's! - Bless you. Thank you. The windmill... what happened to it?
I'm afraid that's the only solution. Your secret is safe with me. Go with God, my friend. There are many definitions of our fragile existence. Many ways to give it meaning.
Nathan and I are very different. I don't understand what his decision has to do with mine. And you think you can forget the tragedy that way. Never. But I can be motivated by it.
What she did to Kim. What did Beverly do to Kim? You think you can forget the tragedy? Never. But I can be motivated by it.
Who will take care of her? Maybe she'll go with Draper, too. It's a tragedy. A fruit that became very rotten very quickly. And no one could ever nibble on her.
And a good soul. The community sticks together, we find the child again. Helpful neighbors, in case of need. I bring them meals. I'm better off than they are. It's the least I can do. You judge a society by how the poorest are treated by it.
I thought you were hit. Drop your weapons! - Dr. Hatcher, no! - Shut up, Danny! I brought you into the world, so I guess it's only fitting that I take you out of it, huh?
History connects. Each and every one of us is part of it. We carry it within us, in the depth of our memory. Yes. I like history. To know it and also to protect myself from it.
I had a job again. I visited her more often than she visited me. We were out there together more often. There wasn't much else there but her and me and a lot of fish. Should we cook her or fry her?
Yes, but let's leave it at that! That's good, you were on time. I love punctuality. Her Majesty says it is the politeness of kings. But I see in it the most decent form of flattery.
- Oh, yeah? Then why did you.... It's about knowing where to look. We have a compass heading. If we follow it,
And I can keep them invisible to their satellites until we hit the target. Good. I'll get back to you as soon as we clear this area. Sir, I just got off the phone with Bill Buchanan at CTU. They were tracking one of the drones. They just lost visual contact with it.
Bill, what happened? Gredenko escaped. But not without launching one of the drones. When will the Air Force intercept it? The F-16s were only minutes away when the drone disappeared from the satellite screen; we're still looking for it.
Kenneth. Have you ever used self-tanner? Dr. Spaceman, if you check my DNA.... Could you tell me what diseases I get...? Or help me remember my pin code? Absolutely. Science is always what we want it to be.
What are you going to do with me? I'm going to look at your baby and determine the D.O.C-- Uh, that's the date of conception. The ultrasound will tell me when you got pregnant... more or less to the day. If you didn't get pregnant on the island, you and your baby will probably be... will be okay... but if you got pregnant here... We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
There are only two possibilities. Since hers is wrong, mine must be right. Either that or we missed the leprechaun. If you are right, then there is nothing we can do. The steroids we gave her mean that the next infection will play heavily into her.
In my life there was a huge... I introduced Neubauten to sequencers and sampling. I was able to bring some of the work I did with Neubauten into the emphasis of tones and melo- dies and texture of Depeche. So there was a lot of cross-fertilization. The technology progressed very quickly and we made use of it.
I'm sure it is. She's standing in front of me right now. - Why are you telling me this? Because when the gas station blew up, the Marine was killed, and she was kidnapped, I had a great idea. It's so good, I gave it a name.
And I apologize before we begin if what I say scares you or makes you uncomfortable. No. You're not going to put this away. What I'm teaching you is scary. You have to have a taste for the truth first. But once you find it, you won't want to let go of it.
It's in your blood. But movies are something else. Do you know why I wanted you to be the lead singer? Because your voice has no personality or depth. Except the one I give it.
It is in your left. A chance hit, possibly. - You have an accomplice who gives you a sign. No, it's much simpler than that. When you raise your hand to your forehead, the blood flows out of it.
Is there a special school where people like you learn to talk such nonsense? Please stay in touch with us anyway. Take care. The man kills the president. And Nicholas goes over to the cow and shoots it in the head.
I'm sure that will calm him down. My brother, my brother... Many, many years ago, in a sad, faraway land, there was a huge mountain of rough, black stone. At sunset, at the top of the mountain, an enchanted rose bloomed every night, making the one who plucked it immortal. But no one dared to get too close to it because its thorns were full of poison.
- We strive. - I'm Olivia Wenscombe. - Yes, I know who you are. You want to get the rest of my performance? No, I want to give your performance what it's missing.
Sorry if I'm scaring you. I have used the power of the forest a little too often. What do you think about this world? The few who survived built everything from nothing. To someone from the past, this world will certainly seem very harsh. But Agito and I, we were born in it and we love it.
Take everything that's inside. I just need my key card back. - What key card? - My CTU access card. It's of no value to you. It only gets me into the building.
Health care, rations and fair compensation. We have a great responsibility. There comes a time when you realize that the machine you have built, with your blood, sweat and tears, is being used for something so evil and perverse that it makes you sick inside. And then you have to throw your body on the brakes and on the machine itself to make it stop. And then you tell the operators, the rulers, that as long as we are not free, it will never be possible to use this machine.
- Have you slept at all? - No. Not until our first home game. Nate, listen, your shoulder's not back to normal yet. Some rest will do it good.
That he hijacked the plane? Not quite. He has control of the cabin, but the pilot lands the plane. What about the recording? He's still looking for it, but there's no guarantee he'll find it before the plane lands.
Your countries are trembling before China. How will Mali fare first? I think the cotton sector has no future. Given the prices of products imported from China, like copies of our textiles, we no longer have any interest in negotiating cotton. "In a world without barriers, we must civilize globalization and give it meaning."
"Soon" may be just minutes away. See here? There should be several trigger spirals under the membranes. That's Wraith technology, so more like trigger veins. If I can isolate the primary conduit... I can follow it back to the hub.
- You can't turn it off? - I didn't say that. What did you say? The control console is shot to hell. Like I told Teyla, I need to bypass it... isolate the primary trip line and follow it to the hub.
Excuse me. There's a snake here, buddy. There are two snakes. No, no, it's one snake. We're standing in it.
The orgasm I live on this energy. Okay, sorry, just to clarify.... You traveled here to feed on orgasmic energy? There is nothing like it.
You said something about how Catalina was half naked, and I.... It slipped my mind again. Sometimes Randy gets caught in his own thought loop. That's what happens when he watches Back to the Future. When he finally got out of the loop, we went to talk to Catalina.
Test their faith. What is your analysis, doctor? I am a scientist. And as a scientist, I believe that if God exists, our knowledge of Him is not perfect. The religion you practice is based on an unprovable theory. Yet you ascribe to it irrefutabilities such as that there should be no coincidences.
I'm not giving it to the cops. Jail's too good for him. I'll give it to you. You're the only person who can understand how I feel. And you can do whatever you want with her, with him.
Fine, but if you expect anything more from me than my polite side, you will be sorely disappointed. Bree, this salmon is delicious. Oh, thank you so much! I won the blue ribbon in the gourmet contest with this. I also love this sauce. What gives it that special kick?
We're not going to make it, are we? - Not without doping. - Don't talk like that! Think about the bridge. Otherwise we won't be able to step under its pillars.
You should not have done much. There she is. I imagine your cousin will be quite surprised to hear about the money her uncle left her. You can be sure of that. Sam, I hope this question doesn't bother you, but your hand. What happened to it?
Some men saw themselves as future representatives of this new America, but it was men and women like Robert and Clara who were to embody its true spirit. Their courage and determination were to be painfully tested - in the years to come. - ...We celebrate here today. Bless this majestic route and all who will travel on it.
They're not coming back. This isn't your world, Will. You know it is. History, it's happening to us now. We live in it.
What are you doing, Debraj? Your eyes have just been operated on. What are you doing with that bulb? This bulb is dying, Miss Nair. I have to stand by her, don't I?
We learned a lot of new things today. About colors and stuff. Oh, a new color. Get some rest... Stop it, you two.
She said, "Open the door." You could have led his life. But instead, you come back. You are truly one of a kind, 6 Echo. My name is Lincoln! I brought you into this world and I can take you out of it.
Not my idea. Doctor's orders. Heart condition. He calls it "angina." I polish my badge and prepare to tell her "goodbye".
Front line. - All right. Can you fill this? I could fill a whole garbage can, sir. Then the test won't be a bust, Jim. Hey, secure that gun before you handle it. I don't need a hole in the brain. I just got it back.
Do you think that everything is over now? Your work consists of finding a culprit and righting wrongs that have been done. Mine is to show the deceased the way to heaven and accompany them until they get there. Righting wrongs? Gracious sir, have you already forgotten? You once mentioned this disease: simheoro. If you cannot escape it, you may suffer from it all your life.
Of angels who bent down to earth to touch their golden harps. Peace on earth, goodwill to men from the gracious King of Heaven. The world lay in solemn silence to hear the angels sing. At the end of one year and the beginning of the next, we must ask ourselves how we can best serve God. In this new year... The world is moving forward. And we must go along with it.
The moment you reach Sumpu, you will have no home to return to! You gave them a map? Now, the Lord of Lords... will spread his light all over the land. How could he accept well-hidden and unreachable villages? Our fate is to live in the darkness and die in it.
You built her from nothing. She is all you have. Your name would become synonymous with today's events: Terrorism, treason. You want me to lie to the government? If I had found out yesterday, I would have done everything to prevent the attacks. Now all we can do is save this company from the doom it is sure to face if CTU finds out the truth. They'll seize the data and find out the truth.
Aleksander, meet me at the airport in Teuge. You wanted to talk to me? I've been thinking. The transmission from the embassy that Kradic intercepted... The hardware to tap into the network must be on-site. - What do you mean? - They won't have removed it. And the information would have to be stored on it.
Sorry to barge in like this. Do you have a minute? Sure. What can I do for you? My daughter wants to sacrifice her virginity to you, and you'd be doing me a favor if you'd let her have it.
Yes, sure. Of course. The thing is, this island -- uh... is, uh, finding it again might be difficult. Can't we fly around and look for it?
You got mommy. The soup is great. It's like a mixture of lentils and chili. It's wonderful. It's the bacon that gives it that flavor.
I'll come back later. (Rat squeaks) (Cat meows) (Boy) I'm warning you, Hermione. Keep your beast away from Scabbers or I'll make a tea cosy out of him.
- Shakespeare. I don't watch English games. This is Milos' premiere. Life is a stage, the whole... But different things happen on it.
Just last Sunday, the Führer wanted to help me get out of here. You know me. We have the same blood. There was no consideration for me. Our glorious idea is perishing, and with it everything beautiful, admirable, noble and good that I have known in my life.
She's got spirit. LOLA: Mm. Isn't that nice? Is it enough? They say the best way to meet a temptation is to give in to it.
How could you send her of all people? She is blind. She is more capable than most in the village, and she is guided by love. The world revolves around love. She kneels in awe of it.
- I don't know how they got there. - Yeah, right. - All you do is tell lies! - Face it, we're both liars! But my camera doesn't lie. It just shows you what's right in front of it.
I wanted to make the Hitchcock film... Screenwriter ...to put an end to it once and for all. People think the film is about a journey from New York to South Dakota to Mount Rushmore. In fact, it is a journey through Cary Grant's personalities and a journey through the stages of his career. A seamless blend of romance, comedy and suspense, production of The Invisible Third began on 8/26/1958. The beauty of the plot is that although it is absurd, you are completely caught up in it.
You have returned from London quite suddenly, Mademoiselle. There is a party for Midge and Edward, believe it or not, they are getting married. Did you think the murderess would return to the scene of the crime? You know, I get the impression that this crime is either completely simple, so simple that it's hard to believe, or it's very complex. And that would mean that we are dealing with a clever mind that is able to come up with ideas that are as complicated as they are ingenious, that make us think that we are getting closer to the truth, when in fact we are moving away from it.
The moment she releases them into the bloodstream,? they find their way to the different centers or different parts of the body. Now every single cell in the body has... Receptors on the outside. Now a cell can have thousands of receptors occupying its surface,...in a sense, opening up to the outside world. And when a peptide docks onto a cell, it literally, like a key in a lock.... it literally, like a key in a lock, sits on the receptor surface and is attached to it... and moves the receptor in some way, then it sends a signal to the cell, almost like ringing a doorbell.
Good. What about No.8? There she is. Let me get her attention. Deunan, you approach her from below.
Not that I know of. No. Why would the murderer take the stole before the event? No one knew about the scene between Mademoiselle de Bellefort and Mr. Doyle. Perhaps he found it when he went for the pistol. Then why was she not found when the search was made for her?
Collé, have you gone crazy? Are you chasing my older brother out of the house? Younger brother, tell me, where is your authority as a husband? Circumcision did not exist yesterday. It is required by Islam. And you, woman, want to put an end to it?
- Hello, Alan. - Mr. President. Your brother is leading your downfall. - I'm not firing my brother. - That's a shame. I'm not giving up on my health care reform. I've been working on it for two years.
I think Wyatt is more concerned with kindergarten right now - than magic school. - Are you sure? Paige said he orbed right to that door. He was drawn to her.
- See this little hole? This moth is about to hatch. It's in there right now, struggling. Digging her way through the thick cocoon shell. I could help her -- take my knife,
Experience the dream trails of the mystical Australian outback. You have no right to take that off my desk. So you walk around, hunt and gather food, right? On foot? Not that you would know anything about it, but a walkabout is a journey of spiritual renewal where you draw the power of the earth and become inseparable from it.
Yeah, sure. We also need to check all her stops -that she made for her purchases. -That's gonna cost you. We need to find the gun and link it to her.
- That's crazy. - Why else would it destroy the ship? Because the gases are corrosive. Or we offended the cloud when we flew into it. If we talk to it... maybe it'll let us go.
What? Well, actually, the bird lady is kind of right about that. Well, half right. You didn't just kill love. You pursue it, you toy with it, then you kill it.
Do you really think so? Let's go to the villages. What do you mean? The peasants have never seen the capital. That's why they're afraid of it.
We were happy there. (Leto) Father. I'm waiting. And I am ready. To know the future is to fall into its trap. But to know there is a trap is the first step to avoid it.
The children! - They are well, Muad'Dib! I have interfered with the future. Into all possible futures. I wanted to create them. Instead, they created me. I set the trap myself. But knowing that there is a trap is the first step in avoiding it.
Venerable Mother! I bring you a warning. The blessings of Muad'Dib have been corrupted. The religion of Muad'Dib is no longer Muad'Dib. He renounces it. And he renounces you, too.
Now you must make the final sacrifice. You must give up your name. I have already forgotten it, master. The Scroll of Completion. Whoever reads it aloud in its entirety will gain the power to control the world and make it a paradise or a living hell.
- Nobody knows that. Alexander found it with a card that was by the casket. No one was allowed to see it. He called this card "Mati". And the exact translation for "Mati" is eye. The orb is the map. Hidden in the Temple of Luna by Alexander. With it, Reiss will find Pandora's Box. When he opens it, he will have a weapon more powerful than anything you can imagine.
So this... Stone is the map? - Yes, it is. - I've never seen anything like it. You have? And it's the only way to get to the box? And you could just walk out that door with it.
We spent... and blew it on drinking, eating and amusing company. The more of it was gone, the more we realized the drinking wasn't satisfying. The food turned to ash in our mouths. And any company, no matter how amusing, did not satisfy our lust. We were cursed. We were driven by greed, but now... we are consumed by it.
The beauty of Astrid is that she lives in this life. You should do the same. Or at least try to. You can't make a racehorse out of a tortoise. But you can make a very fast turtle out of it.
Can you make a girl cry at the wedding? Laugh when you are sad? Be silent for 10 years? I just got off the phone with Margaret about her insurance. I was just... I was just trying to do her a favor.
We knew about the bomb weeks ago. You are free to go. What do you mean, "knew"? We let her into the country. We were on her all along.
What then? Your defense policy is too passive. The military needs to be strengthened. You want to undermine my presidency. I just want to give it fuel.
If you take me back, I'll forget what happened here. Either you shut up or you make the rest of the trip unconscious. Which would you prefer? This microbe is more resilient than I thought. Theta radiation doesn't seem to affect it at all.
- I don't. They have already taken over 24 people. I'm not giving them any more. You told me you trusted my assessment. Trust it now, unless you have another suggestion.
Look, I decided this morning to cooperate with the FBI. - To help them convict Keller. - oh? And now, with Keller dead... that opportunity is gone. And with it, my chance for freedom.
The execution was 3 months before. That's when I quit everything. Now I save the world from my living room. At least nobody dies because of me. You can't change the past, but you can't run away from it either.
Remember? - They beat the shit out of you. - Yeah. Then you said to me, "Boy, I may have brought you into this world... but you're the one who has to live in it."
You are a member of the Council. If... It is not the will of the council, it is Father's will. And he is the law. Sir without the logic of a process, isn't that exactly the chaos that we have worked so hard to eliminate? You must understand, Preston, that even if you and even I do not always agree with it, it is not the message itself that is important, but our obedience to it.
-You have started a new movement. "Mega Tantrism. Sex without any orgasm. Do you like parties? Can I borrow your handcuffs? If my hand is free, I have to do everything with it.
I mean, the priority is just to have a tight ass. But if it's hairy, then I prefer tits. But if the tits are hairy... hey, I'd rather have pussy. So, you need to talk to this pussy, son. Not just talk to her, more than that, you need to take an oath.
- He's right. If I went with you, it would be too dangerous for all of you. I can't go without you. You have to. Go to the spring. Drink from it.
Nine. You couldn't tell by looking at him. He was even very well. But he was no longer afraid of anything or anyone. He said, "We're all just logs." He always wanted to fight the sun... and set the earth on fire with it.
For God's sake. Piss off, Feathers. Sorry, mate. We've got a camera, Stu. It's some sort of periscope. We can use it to find you.
Is a mattress. - We can get through it. - Oh, man. It's not his mattress. A man is lying on it.
That's not a common skill, Harry. It's bad. Why? Well, if I hadn't told the snake that she wasn't going to... - Oh, you said that to her?
- You can say Sydney. First question. What would be the next image in this series? D. If this figure were rotated 180 degrees, which of the following would correspond to it?
- Why not? - Because you would lose everything. Your friends. Yourself. Willow, if you give in to this, the world will end, and so will we.
Good. Now listen. Do you hear the music? Listen carefully. Now follow it.
All right. Let's try this one: Why am I here? I thought you had to protect the timeline, not play with it. It's already been played with.
What could I have done that could be so important? It was not just you. It was the events that you contributed to. This timeline that you say no longer exists. What would have happened to it if my mission had continued?
You have to go for it. How often does this happen? You owe it to yourself. Here's your warm milk. I'll put the bourbon in her home.
- Your Emily and Richard. - Sookie, you are way too kind. She helped me so much with the 1st phase of wedding planning. - The crazy phase of planning. - That was nice and I am grateful to her.
Enjoy, and maybe I can mess up a cake for you. Sounds good. Hey, Luke, hold on a sec. Listen, about Rory tutoring Jess... I really appreciate it.
How are you doing? - Is that being recorded? - Okay, I deserve that. Look, I didn't mean to ambush you with the adoption thing. You smelled a story and you went after it.
Lois Runtz. - I'm telling the truth. - That would be a first. No one knows about our secret door. Does Lois know about it?
Even the power of the elves is no match for this evil. We lack the strength to fight Mordor and Isengard! Gandalf, the Ring cannot stay here. This threat affects all of Middle-earth. You must decide now how to meet it.
I would rather die than see the ring in the hands of an elf! No one trusts an elf! Do you not understand? While you bicker, Sauron's power grows! None can escape it!
- Squid burger, it's good. - Do you have a boat yet? - No. Ask Alvin Yark to build one, or buy the one from Nutbeem. I built a Chinese junk, came from Brazil with it.
Also that we have witnesses to the action I call maiden Lene and my boy But since no teacher does it to witness and today also the spell he sang well so I make the lad equal to the companion Kneel down, David, and take this shell! Stand up, companion, and think of the prank: you'll remember the baptism at the same time If there's anything else missing, no one's scolding us That the wise woman keeps her strength for life, I'll just give her the name right away:
And I would hope that the world would forgive me. You're my hero, Floop. So I help you, and then you help me. Minion must be stopped. - One more thing. My show... What's wrong with it?
- Well, I would say you are a siren. - You really don't take anything seriously. I'll ask your redskin about it. And the beast? Did you get a picture of it?
The air makes you believe mirages. - You'd think she was fleeing from me. You've only been here three months and you want to close the deal? Did you think the beast would surrender at the sight of you? Perhaps you frighten it.
- Quite good. Zoom in on that. - Don't touch it. - Why not? You see me pullin' out your gun and wavin' it around?
You and I, we can bring them back to life. All I ask is a little something in return. Just that, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it.
May I pass on to you a question from our guide? - The guide, who very much appreciates your predictions for the future and thanks to your forecasts finds great agreement with you, recently asked in a small circle how it is possible to reconcile clairvoyance with the principle of cause and effect, a law of nature? Nature does not care how we think about her. And our laws are just as indifferent to it.
Yes, but the woman can't go to the police because she got the necklace from her lover. Really bad luck for Senora Kowalski. That's why she hired a private detective, and he's supposed to be the best in Europe! And she's expecting him today. At noon. I wonder if he can help her.
-Doesn't it ever stop? Go, go. This way. There's a solid vein of granite under this ridge. We'll follow it, but the white man will have to go around it.
I'm going to Astrometrics. Doctor, the command center is all yours. - Smells good. - It's just burned on the outside. Your cooking console's temperamental. Have you tried talking to it?
- On for best friends. - Oh. You like Richard. He likes you. If that friendship makes you so angry, work on it.
But you can only alleviate it By living You must never give up For one of us must live The hardest thing in this world is to live in it.
Tell my friends I love them. You have to take care of them. You have to take care of each other. You have to be strong. Dawn, the hardest thing in this world is living in it.
Do your thing well! That's enough! I want to wear my own clothes! Sorry to disappoint you, but you can't wear what you want in the Texas penitentiary. Well, like I said, Prince stole a moth and flew down here with it.
You say that your husband has good in him. You must learn to live on what the good part earns. The what? There is a point within yourself. An inner boundary. If that is crossed, you feel guilty. You need to realize where that line is. And renounce what lies beyond it.
I was really looking forward to Christmas this year. Seriously. And already I'm back in the fucking rabbit hole. All right, let's go. The attack, what preceded it?
We didn't know that was going to happen. We wanted to secure our pioneering role and do what was best for the company. Then he got sick. He was working on an alloy with a built-in genetic algorithm. He turned electrical energy into mechanical energy and gave it a memory.
I mean, maybe later. In the meantime, Rye, why don't you tell her about the apron? Tedi is wearing it right now, and it's an apron. Riley started with a simple design. Then she added color and function to it with the gloves.
Maybe Korso will find the Titan first. Why is this so important to you? I grew up among humans. "Drifter colony bums," as you call them! I barely remember Earth, but the elders told us about it so it would never be completely forgotten.
Russians, Americans, beings from Mars. It is like fire, could destroy us or keep us warm. That's why every FedEx office has a clock. Because we live or die by the clock. We never turn away from it.
Well, I... I was here first, so before you. I thought it would be funny if I jumped out of the chest and surprised you. Surprise! You know the rest. We've only known each other 20 seconds and we already have a story. What are you gonna tell her?
The street doesn't care if you are made up. It doesn't ask how old you are. They don't feel uncomfortable either, because you earn more than the street. And you can visit her whenever you want. Whether it's been a whole day or just a few hours since you were last there. The only thing the road wants is for you to walk on it from time to time.
Yeah. I wish I was more like you. Why do you always wear that hat? Because about 90%/% of your body heat escapes through your head. But you don't have a special relationship with it, do you?
The situation is delicate: She offers me your hand, which I've been pushing for and don't care about. Are you not deceiving me? What are you saying? I serve you faithfully, like a maid. What we see there may come from her suspecting me of an inclination in Paris. I answered her gallantly. She got serious, and that's when you came in.
But that's good. Why? The intellectual depth. She's learned another language. There's a little more to her than just the potential for nudity.
See you then. Do me a favor and call me back. I need your neighbor's number. Thanks a lot. Bye. - I think she liked it.
So we are hidden in the bathroom ... I get out. But before she can, her parents come in. I hide in the shower. They start hanging on to her on the floor.
He likes to hear himself talk. ...man or woman, parents or children, flesh and blood or photons.... It is said... Or maybe he sipped the sacrificial wine. Therefore, our church is everything. It is our world. We belong to it as a branch belongs to a tree.
To reproduce. And they are what they eat, right? What's the hardest material you know? A new alloy of naqahdah, trinium and carbon. We used it to build the hull of the O'Neill.
- Transgenomics. - Meaning? A form of DNA manipulation - changes at the genetic level. It is well known that tobacco companies invest in such research. To make the tobacco plant more resistant, to lower or increase its nicotine content, or to add a menthol flavor to it.
A little rain can't stop you from flipping 100 hamburgers, can it? The relationship lasts longer than I thought. Look at him. He's bored. I give it two more weeks.
Now... you must hurry. - What are you going to do? - Blow the bridge. But will that stop him? Yes - if he's on it.
That would be almost the story of me and my friends. Monday the worldly life starts again. I guess the bottom line is that we all have our thing together in our own way. But we stick together. We flit around in the hamster wheel of life, trapped in a world of inner dialogue. As Bill Hicks said, "It's a crazy world, but I'm proud to be a part of it."
Ming Xinhong won the city championship over 5000 meters. Wei Minzhi returned to her family's farm. She often visits her students. From the remaining money, the school was rebuilt. They gave it the name School of Hope ShuiQuan.
I have no regrets... Cheap wooden sticks! ...even if you make me cry! Love is a beautiful thing! I will submit to it if I ever get the chance.
- What will become of our relationship? - Our what? Our who? relationship. What kind of relationship do we have, and what will become of it?
It's just a matter of time. How much time do you have? Not much. I'm going to die, and there's nothing you can do about it. My power is fading and with it my ability to cloak Daisy.
Yes, such desire needs only the slightest encouragement to be ignited. Am I right? Yes. In Islam, we believe that restraining temptation ... is more effective than simply resisting it.
Imagine the flame burning inside you. - Sorry. - The flame is getting hotter. A white-hot flame. Follow it into the past.
I wish it would work. There is medicine for your condition, but you have rejected it. I have a disease, but I will live with the symptoms. That sounds illogical, doesn't it? I assumed that romantic love was a weakness, but you can also draw strength from it.
But first I have another use for you. In the beginning there was darkness. Then came the strangers. They kidnapped us and brought us here. This city and everyone in it is part of their experiment.
You're as proud as a peacock because some doddering old man wants to paint you. We'll bring you back to earth. It's crazy: A real artist looks at this snout? This snout was good enough for you to lie under it a few times!
Dr. Franklin, see if we can secure the site. All right. You know, Commander, if we are incapable of ending their war, there is always room in our people for someone like you. We could be a safe haven for you and others. Thank you, but if my world is ending, I'm going with it.
You pursue Porthos, Athos and Aramis and bring me their heads. Or you will lose yours. And as for you, my brother, you go back to prison and wear that mask you hate so much! You shall wear it until you love it! And you shall die in it!
Don't you, Cybil? When business interests and art meet, conflict is almost inevitable. - Wimp, just shut up. I was just about to believe in this whole rock star crap. What you deliver on stage is not shit.
- They were correct. Twice, the same numerical value ! Something is going on. It has to do with this number. There is an answer in it.
He doesn't seem to mind hurting you. You were on that plane, too. Harold was diagnosed with cancer. He had two, three years left at the most. We made him the offer. He jumped at it.
The hammer. The one I used to kill. It's dull now. The secret to keeping it clean is use. Yes, blood nourishes it, gives it luster.
Today I learned that Carley died. She was 19. 19 years old, and for the last two years she did almost nothing but fight. All the while, she remained positive and inspired those around her. She was a role model for all of us. She refused to let cancer beat her. And even though she succumbed to it, it didn't win.
You upload it to the web. Anywhere. With PJ's name on it, people will find it. - I don't understand a word. The code is like a password. It's the only way to turn the source code into Bathwater.
Uncle Monty will be down soon. It doesn't understand anything. Dr. Montgomery said the mating call of the lovesick crocodile just sounds like a depressed person. I know. But I like talking to him.
God of light come to us in the darkness. The night is dark and full of danger. We will all soon freeze to death. Even the water. When you killed the white walker, almost all of the dead who followed him fell.
We build on that. I asked the boy to draw a simple little circle. If he did his best in it, maybe he would win me over. With a simple circle. I'll tell you the impression your little circle made on me, John. It lacked focus, ambition, clarity, precision, dedication, passion and honesty.
- Perfect. Quiet oars, under cover of darkness, a surprise attack. The river is too fast there to land men safely. But if the Lord of Merzien sees it as an advantage to drown men, then let him attack. Uhtred, your advice is good, but how can I trust it?
My wife woke up. "What are you doing?" "Look! She's talking to a gorilla!" And we were both mesmerized. So she was talking to this gorilla, and at one point she gave him a kitten.
What's wrong with you?" I was like, "Why? That video is crazy!" What was that about? You're teaching a gorilla how to talk. You give him a kitten that dies.
Find a hot guy, have a crazy night, and then everything would be good. So I did that and kept doing that until I realized.... Why do anything else? Sex and death. That's what I want. Well, you can say you're ready to die.... A lot of people do... but as someone who's seen death many times and been left behind by it, I can tell you...
You don't deserve it! Malcolm, I've secured the third talisman. I'll see you in the morning. "Don't fight the pain. Surrender to it."
- Darkness, Doctor! - Look, a burial mound. Pictish civilization. - The bird! - What about him?
- What is his name? Coco. Wait, wasn't that the name of Ellen's dog? Yes. You can't give him the same name.
But I hear so often, "Baby Archer, I'm too stupid to dance." You idiot, anyone can dance even if they're dumb. Hey, y'all, this is my new dance It's called The Kupid Shufle Give it a chance
I'll find a studio. The kid doesn't believe in that shit. Chris could be doing everything wrong right now and still look pretty good over four rounds. But in six, eight, 10 or 12 rounds, no matter how old you are, it catches up to you. Your body gives you what you give it.
This is a Tel Galaxy exploration ship. It explores the depths of space. According to the identification code, it's Trayling's fleet cruiser. But there's nothing here about destination or mission. -What's wrong with it?
When was the last time you saw real whiskey? Irish whiskey? This one... comes from Boston. We get just about everything through this blockade, but whiskey always gets there first. The neutral parties in any war are the ones who make money off it.
He lets me stay here in exchange for hunting coyotes. There's beer in the fridge. You stole my hat. I borrowed it. What did you do with it?
- I don't want to be like Troy Maxson! I just want to be myself. You are who you are, Cory. That shadow was nothing but your maturing self. You either catch up to it or adapt it to you, but you have to deal with that.
I can't make myself invisible. I don't want to get away from you. Honey, look. No one has seen the dragon again. And I never spoke of him again.
And if she has water in her mouth, we can show that it's not a form of ventriloquism. Does she have to sit in that chair? Because it makes me sick to see her sitting there like that. We know it's hard, but the mind seems to have a connection to that seat. It's easier for Ed to make contact with it when she's sitting there.
I was there. The ocean chose you. I thought it was a dream. Our ancestors believed Maui lay there... at the end of his hook. Follow it and you will find it.
Hey, hey. We have the best seats. Everybody can sit down there. We saved this city. We should be on the monitor, not in it.
Adam. Smiths. I could hardly believe that these were the same brave Highlanders who had defeated the British army at Prestonpans and Falkirk and marched triumphantly into England. But five months of retreat with little food and in harsh weather had left them broken and demoralized. Our worst nightmare was coming true. I felt utterly helpless to face it.
Then we'll take on the British. John. I'm asking you, as usual. The plan has potential, I admit. I'll go along with it, on one condition.
It's not just about the inmates of the mental institutions you run, that's just the beginning. In the future it will be about the entire lower third of our national body. Inferiors, cripples, imbeciles, alcoholics, sex offenders, workaholics, in short: all those sick elements who cause more costs to the healthy body of the people than they bring in.
They killed not only the chosen ones, but also my aunt. Pyria. The Ellcrys will carry a seed. This seed must be taken by a chosen one to a place called Safehold. There it will be immersed in the bloodfire. Only then may the seed be brought back so that a new Ellcrys can arise from it.
He named this new sect after himself, the Order of St. Dumas. Okay. Impressive. Yes. His psyche couldn't handle death and rebirth until we gave it a larger context.
I did not order them. I found them. Am I the only one here who doesn't do something? Scrap that paste! To the cave with him! Where a demon with a thousand peckers will shrink him forever!
Thank you all! Lemonade for all! Lemonade for all! "Since the fair does not have enough funds, participants have to pay for their own travel expenses." Good day. He is a dreamer. Why should we help him?
Sorry we had to do this the hard way. We all have aches and pains. Some are physical from injury or age. Some are mental, you know, having to live with the loss of a loved one. If you think about it, whether we fight the pain or succumb to it, the result is the same.
How long will that take? A day? If they're up north... Compass. This path leads east. We'll follow it while the bird of prey scans the remaining terrain.
But there. Mine, too. Mr. Douglas has a compass. What are you doing now? Following it.
I don't... I know. He has a dog, right? He used to be here. I saw him walking it once, too.
Not today. You can't. Why? Why are you acting like you're not one of us? When you aim, Casey, you must always keep both eyes open. Keep your eyes on your target and move with him. Pick up his pace.
Is he a psychiatrist? Not at all. Okay, here's your dog. He's not mine. Just leave him on the table, I'll find him some fruit.
The apartment I mean. - Yeah. What the hell are you doing? What the hell are you doing? That Jerry stuff must really piss you off if you keep avoiding him.
- Yes, sir. Do we have a problem? No, sir. I'm coordinating with Doug. When a dog bites you... you put it to sleep or you muzzle it.
You're putting us all in danger. You meet Scott at Fee's in one hour. Bring Benjamin. Leekie's Alzheimer's bot doesn't look too fit. We should feed him blood, like in The Little Shop of Horrors.
You say that now. But it is the loss that haunts us. This must not happen. Do you know why I left that place? Because I hated everything about it.
At the Serbian. We are supposed to get the car soon. I said I can get a BMW 645. -Yes, but not now. -I told him we'd come today.
Barry. - What's going on? - I don't understand. The tracker in the suit must be malfunctioning. According to him, he keeps popping up all over town at once, and that's impossible.
None of them have a mountain lion right now. - Our shooter could keep one as a pet. - Yeah, but that would be illegal. And a triple killer wouldn't risk violating health department requirements? The point is, the lion wouldn't be registered and there would be no way to search for it.
Why are you rejecting me? Watch out. Quickly. Through there. From here, there's a secret passage. Follow it.
Not ideal, but Mack, he feels great pain. He has lost hope. I can survive years through his pain. I know where you're being dragged down to. I've escaped it before.
It's not ideal, but Mack, he feels great pain. He has lost hope. I can survive years through his pain. I know where you're being dragged down to. I've escaped it before.
Now we know why Rudy Jones was the only survivor. - He killed them all. - They can't stop us. They can't stop what we're turning into. This planet is being destroyed by mankind who lives only to suck the life out of it.
What? - You have to keep a steak refrigerated. You don't leave it in the sun and drive it through a river. James is making a lot of noise. Worse than last time. And even though he's acting like an absolute outdoorsman this time, I've never felt closer to him.
I'll have to see for myself. Let's go. Soldier pigeon during training. No pigeons will be hurt while filming White Rabbit Project. First you have to get the bird used to the crate, acclimatize it by putting it in the crate, giving it something to eat, and they associate the crate with food, so it's a nice place.
Don't spike him. ...and the lances. Let's tjost. Here comes the most important part of our experiment: the accelerometer. With it we can determine what g-factor the knight experiences during braking.
In Step by Step to Step Dad, it's called "loving boundary." Loving boundary? That sounds really great, honey. But your self-help books don't know Dusty Mayron. He sounds like a rascal, but I'll be fine with him.
I apologize for the rant. I will leave now. But I am forever in your debt, gentlemen. Another phrase that's no longer in use. Let's breathe new life into it.
Do you think you can do it? What do you think? So I can stay? All right. You know, a place is haunted when there's more reality in it than there is in you.
You are perfect for this film. - My movie, yeah. Mom, what are you doing? I just touched it lightly. The garage owner said it was in great condition, you couldn't tell it was 14 years old.
Mr. Hoppy's secret plan was extremely clever. Because when an animal grows over a long period of time, you don't even notice that it's growing. It would be different if it suddenly grew big. Let's say you have a puppy. You say goodbye to it in the morning before school....
- Shasaat! Aim it at the dragon! - What was that? High stakes pay off. If you distract him, I'll hit him with this wand.
That's exactly what I hope. Come. There's a lot to do. Liv, this is where we part ways. Run to the river and follow it.
Destructor secured. Climb rate table? Table on board. I know this man. If the charge is true, he serves a foreign state, but he serves it faithfully.
Ana? Ana? Ana! A little bird flew into the house. I'll help him out again.
- We will accomplish great things together. And I will bring you creatures you have only ever dreamed of. You must come with me, Sondra. Give me back the pain. I can free you from it completely.
Look at me. I've seen how strong you can be... and that Wes you must be here and now to help the others. Here. Sam's ring. I took it off him before we...
Idiot. Why is he tampering with the van? - Your dad's? Yeah, there's no spare parts. - Yeah, but you're helping him, right?
They slaughtered my mother. And everyone I knew. I know what it's like to lose your loved ones. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what will follow it.
And your mother wanted to be here too. I know, but the wounded in Tondc need her more. Field commanders, today is the great day when we repeat our people. The enemy thinks he is safe, but he is not. As soon as he realizes that, he will strike back. Hard.
- What have you done to me? - Hope's blood is in you now. You are the bait. This body is still connected to Davina and the children. He dies when I leave him, and Davina and the others with him.
Well come on then, let's get you back into your real body, although I'd like to torture Esther and Freya into doing that, I'm sure that would be very funny. No, Nik. I'll stay where I am. Eva is gone forever, but her body, this body is still connected to Davina and the children. I can feel it and if I leave it, it will die and Davina and the others will die with it.
NARRATOR: What's happened so far: we take Hope and the pack, and we leave tonight. WOMAN: This body is still connected to Davina and the children. If I leave it, it dies, and Davina and the others with it.
To me, it looks like nothing is easier than that. Are you dancing, little runt? Lady Pole isn't crazy. She seems to be, but that's Norrell's fault. He brought her back from the dead with an elf and gave him power over her.
You are no match for her with a sword. I wounded her once. If I had known you then, you would be dead. Where is the Ring of Magi? I will take you to him if you let us live.
If this April 24 turns into an anti-Turkish demonstration, we will break off diplomatic relations with France. And I poor ambassador would have to leave Paris, which I would regret infinitely, because I love your city. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Dear brothers and sisters, every year on April 24, we again see before us the bloody image of our martyrs who were murdered. This death was not only suffered, with him a people took up its path of suffering, in the name of the striving for and the right to its Armenianism.
At least try. Damn John Constantine. The center of attention again. This demon will try to use our weaknesses against us. When he shows himself, don't listen to him.
It protects a person. Is there a reason why we cannot turn on the light? Yes. The sensor is amazingly sophisticated. It's practically impossible to approach it without invoking Odin's wrath.
You know what, I have no choice, because it's important for my sons. Yes, and what about their own needs? Parents don't have any. Have you ever read the book. "The Giving Tree"? It's about a tree, and these kids come and rip stuff off of it, all their lives, until there's nothing left but a stump.
I got the bed. Yes, that's good. This is my bar. A tree fell down in a storm. I had a big slab made out of it.
- The Emery murder did not happen Cortez. - No. It was not allowed to happen there. Every act must be dramatic, theatrical. You must give it meaning. But never here.
Bonnie's okay, Jo's okay, and Lily's down for a long winter nap. You seem lost in thought. I remember everything, every moment. It's like a million little pieces of my heart have fallen back into place. I remember how we met, how we fell in love, how much I didn't want to love you, but it was as if I fell into a river and was swallowed by it.
- Have a child? That was Christine's plan from the beginning? It was my idea to bring the amethyst here. It'll be guarded around the clock. Good work, James. We can't afford to let anything happen to him.
Hey, Paul. Christmas The snow trickles Christmas I watch him
It is real. - You believe that? - Yes. You want to know about "belief," Kevin? Under emotional stress, the mind clings to any construct it can to make itself feel better.
You are the best we have created. You are the only one who can do this. And when you go to the other side, you will finally see that your belief in Hydra was never misplaced. It is real. You will look it in the eye.
People loved his series. This would destroy it all. I'm sorry, American television legend Henry Winkler. There's no reason to be. You mystified Herb's death to give it meaning.
And what this water can renew, it can also take away. A life for a life. - What are you saying? - That you must feed this urge. Give yourself to it.
- He was going to kill you. - No, no, no. You just let Him get away too easily. He must pay for it, he must suffer. He must feel the pain, not escape it!
If you continue to harass me, or anyone close to me, I swear this will not end well for you. Can someone in this class tell me what that's called? That's motive, Mr. Cavanaugh! He left that message an hour before Regina was killed. If this case was any easier to crack, I would have slept with him in college.
I meet people from the Guinness Book of Records. A mere formality. They have to confirm my penis size. Aha, the biggest asshole in the world has the smallest dick in the world? Yeah, that's right. If it's so small, why are you driving away from it?
Again. There are two types of warfare. One each dictates numbers. If you are outnumbered, you attack the enemy head-on. You stab him right in the heart.
All the voices, so much pain. It's not their pain you're afraid of. It's yours, Charles. And as scary as that may be, the pain makes you stronger. When you surrender to it, open yourself up to it, it makes you more powerful than you can imagine.
If a mustache adorns you We are the guardians of the future. Enter when you are ready. Strong! Did you shoot the black condor and kick him in the balls?
-Clear. -Look. Must be nice to be in love. -Yeah. Your hat. If it hadn't been for Johnny, I wouldn't have survived the camp. All I ever thought about was how to get back to him.
Or I'll kick the door down. Mr. Holmes, you and I are alike. Yes, I think so. - Even death has its time, doesn't it? - Of course there is. Then it should be faced.
The spritsail mount of the Andromache. It came loose due to the explosion. Those two more knots are pulling us down. Earlier, when you and Mr. Gates were arguing, you mentioned a letter. What did it say, Billy?
Singleton didn't steal the site, he did. You're lying to them. If no one finds out, everyone wins. I believe in this place. If anyone can do what it takes to make something better, it's you.
I was so sure he was Henry. I guess we have to accept that we were wrong. Did I ever tell you why my curveball was so unbeatable? It was unbeatable because you only had three fingers. The lack of an index finger puts more pressure on the ball at the point of release, gives it greater spin.
Crazy? To take on all this when the outcome is so uncertain. The outcome is only uncertain for the fainthearted. I believe in this place. And I believe that if anyone can do what is necessary to make something better of it, it is you.
- If I could choose... - There! Exactly there lies the mistake in your consideration. If you could choose, he would have no free will. The code would be destroyed. But what should I give him?
I was surprised to receive your message. You seem to be keeping your secrets. I did not want to come. But you could not resist. When you see a river, you have to follow it to the source, regardless of the dangers and comrades who fall by the wayside.
You weak, disgusting, lecherous, pompous man. How dare you talk to me about death? Then let's talk about it together. - Yes. - We will follow him to Mina.
Your Grace. There he is. May he reign long. May he reign long. He sits on the throne as if he were born on it.
Can I come with you? Your dad is so hot, I want to paint him. Ew, no. That's exactly why you can't come. In the afternoon I took out an appendix. And put in a kid who couldn't control his urine flow.
No. Maybe someone said something about a troll? Why? - Yeah, the kids are talking about it, and I was just wondering if the police knew that.... Have any of your students seen the troll? Or come in contact with him?
Vice president in sales. Mid-western region. To celebrate, I bought the surround sound system. I mean, it's awesome, right? You're going to have to marry this ham if you get any closer.
- Are you ready? - Yes. It looks like something out of a knitting magazine. The theme is "airy". You can make a bird, but at least give it an unusual shape.
The Lenape community is in turmoil. Police have not yet issued a statement and have not identified any suspects, but they have blocked off both ends of the street.... Did you get the warrant? Yes. The kid charged me 200 bucks for it. I need you to go with him to Campbell's Drugstore in Airmont.
-Didn't you write it in there? -There are many things in here. The storm is gathering strength. Just like last time. -We should run towards it.
A little... But now I'm hungry. The worst part is the waiting. Death should appear as if from nowhere. You shouldn't have to stare it in the eye.
And how do you plan to achieve that? Markos has also found a way back. It is not impossible. The other side is falling apart. And when this place disappears, you disappear with it.
- Okay, we're leaving now. - Wait! Where is the chronograph in my time? We'll put it in a safe place for you. You must find the green rider. He will lead you to it!
- Cheers! Cheers. - Here's to a nice, serene evening. - Calm. This moment is so cool and without all that hoopla that I want to give it the name "Tim Duncan".
The potential to see the game behind the game. I owe you my career, Eldritch. What about this biological agent? Absolutely lethal, but it dissipates quickly. Designed so our troops can follow it into battle.
No one knows where she was buried. The relic also disappeared. The provostry was plundered during the dissolution of the monasteries. - There is no trace of the rosary. Perhaps I have come one step closer to it.
You leave the computer, do the dishes or turn on the TV. But under 400 milliseconds, that's the ideal point. Our future Cardiff PC, which doesn't look quite ready for production yet, just hit 396 milliseconds. Once it's ready, it will not only be faster than other PCs, but also addictive. So spend some more time with family and friends. Once our PC is out, you'll just hang out with it.
Hello? Leave the cottage and surrender to the glory of the Sontaran Empire. Shh! Doctor? I was being chased by a giant dinosaur, but I think I got away.
Do we expect strangers? It seems ... as if one is already here. What did I do wrong? The dinosaur doesn't seem very happy. - What's wrong with him?
Whether his eyes are alive. Whether he has a veil. Look! See? A whole fingertip goes in. That's how alive he is. You have to punch him in the face. So fleshy so healthy.
One of them died, one is fighting cancer, another is herding sheep in the Netherlands. But one who lives in the house clearly has potential. Jake Picardo is the paparazzi who dragged Iris to court for pushing him and destroying his camera. He currently lives in apartment 10-D. I know you're following a clue about the missing Mr. Frebeaux, but do you have to follow him into an ashtray?
No, good lord. - Mom won't be here until 5:00. - And you ate our only candy bar. - That's probably what attracted it. - We need to throw something at it.
As far as he could tell, it was just a mutt in heat. He didn't stop until he got what he wanted. Well, the girl... unfortunately realized much too late what mistake she had made. She wanted to get up. But the mutt had other plans. I had to shoot him in the temple to get him to let her go.
Show me your idea. Press "Enter". Who are you? Don't be rude. The computer is talking to you. Answer it.
Give up fat. The iron birds, promise me you'll tell Karl. Yeah, sure, I'll tell him. Promise me! He has to follow the path to the pointy rocks, then the river with the fireflies, then he has to change direction, towards the sea. Karl has a sixth sense, he just has to learn to listen to it, to follow it.
What happens when Stalin gets going? China? The Shah of Iran. Do you know Golem's story? A rabbi wanted to protect the Jews in Prague. He built a mud robot, breathed life into it.
It should be fun, right? And if the 80s weren't fun, what was? Hemoclip. I know it's old hat to you, Oliver, but Dr. Karev has never seen this procedure firsthand. You want to go over it with him?
Of what we will discover there. - Are you nervous? - A little, yes. With all you've been through, you're used to it. My life is not special. A circus comes along, and you just follow it.
A circus comes along, and you just follow it. Not everyone has that kind of guts. - You're right. - What? A circus came by. I didn't follow it.
- Help me. - I can't, kid. We'd like to ask you a few questions about Sean Walker. You know his movie "Black Mass"? I was a consultant with him.
And when she was dead, the magic in her pendant was released. Her last wish came true. And how do we undo it? Very good question. But until we know the answer, no one should go near it.
The father became afraid of his own son, so he wounded him. A story like the one that is always told. I think Samaritan is no longer a child. I'm not that presumptuous. But I'm willing to acknowledge his brilliance... and not to muzzle him.
Is your ass made of candy? - What? - I ask, is your ass made of candy? No? Why does my dorky son always follow him?
You don't even know how this game works. - Don't touch me. - Hey, hey. What's this about? Nikki took the eight ball, asked him a question, and shook it.
- Is he there? - Would you rather I left you alone? - No. Last night after dinner, Ryan... Ryan asked if you were his grandpa. And I told him...
Your brother. Your cousin. And your sister. I've known your address in Primrose Hill since the day she moved in. She's only safe as long as I want her to be. I've always been one step ahead of you. And, as my father used to say, to make sure the dog obeys you, you have to show him the baton every now and then.
It went well and Elsa extended our stay until the fall. However, this caused us to lose our winter place in Tampa.... and we had to wander through the cold all winter long. At first it was fun because many had never experienced snow.... ...but by January, everyone was freezing their asses off. I went hunting and killed a rabbit. I skinned him for a coat for Ma Petite.
Lead me on the right path. To You I carry these stones. Out there is a place that never ceases to amaze me. A strange rock. To approach it is dangerous.
That is also understandable. I feel the same way. I'll send people to guard the truck. If Luciano makes one move... I'll trip him up.
Actually, I like girls who have goals, but this is really crazy. Just show me the spell, Kaleb, Kol, or whatever your name is. The problem isn't the spell, the problem is the stake. It's too powerful. You can't just take away its power.
- The Volm are not a counterpart... for the danger that is coming. What danger is that? A force far greater than your mind could comprehend. But defeating them is why we have come so far from our galaxy, why we have gathered resources from every planet and moon in our path. The great battle is coming, and to face it, we're creating a new... Elite, frontline army.
But if I have to, I'm glad to have you. I think I'll go check on them again. - All right, I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah. I shouldn't have killed the Skitter while you were still connected to it.
Why is she a threat? Whenever she gets angry or afraid... it's like she's receiving instructions from above. At first it seemed involuntary, but now she's getting the hang of it, and it's probably because she met with an Espheni. Oh, wait a minute. An overlord was here, and Lexi met with him?
Someone added a human gene to the virus? - Why? - I have no idea. No matter what I try, it seems like the virus is one step ahead of me. It outwits me at everything I come at it with.
- How old was he in the picture? - Not quite sure. 25 or 26. Great fisherman, huh? We didn't believe him that he caught the fish. He said he did, but my grandma always thought he found it at the docks and asked someone to take a picture of him with it.
- I know. But you can't lose faith in yourself. Trust me. What are you doing? Leaving a trail. I'm more used to sailing around a storm than following it.
Maybe you should reconsider. What? The dog. What would I do with a dog? You can take care of him, play with him, scratch his ears.
All right, that was Citizen Z and I'm out. Who's Addy? Which way do we go? The storm's coming from the north, from the Gulf. If we can get to I-70, we can outrun it.
What do you want to know, huh? I'll tell you... No matter what I ask. I can't trust the answer. Write down the sentence and give it to your therapist.
Great. I'll do it. What? Then why are you asking me? Sometimes you just have to say things out loud. If you weren't here, I'd be talking to the refrigerator. He likes all my ideas, gives me ice... and still keeps all the stuff cold.
- Then it was all for nothing, wasn't it? - It depends on how you look at it. The old man meets his greatest opponent... when he was no longer expecting it. He recognized himself in the fish. And... his respect grows as he fights with him.
To lead our minds astray? What does that mean? GANDALF: You must stay on the path. Do not stray from it.
- Using you. Rottmayer told me that he set up the network with five boys from his hometown. He trusted them with his life. Give Javed the sextant. Tell him it's his ticket out of here.
The lady has an ass like the Loch Ness monster. What is mysterious and always desired. Ron, you want to say something to him? Hey, if you have an ass like the North Star, wise to want to follow him. (GIVES)
Until I had to chase this dog for three hours. We tried to get the dog to poop. They fed the dog for a couple of days to make him poop. He didn't. So they gave him an enema.
We are dealing with something that has strong, manipulative abilities. It is something not human. Acknowledging this puppet was a mistake. By doing so, this spirit was able to trick you. You allowed it to take possession of your life.
What's so great about that? - Circus, my ass. You are right. This belt has no value. I have to give it value.
You're a big boy now, jack. He escaped in a standard fbi vehicle, didn't he? Took you to the bridge. Where the other riders were waiting With an identical backup car. It only took a split second For you to lose contact with him And set the switch.
It was nice of Dad to bring me here. Dad brought you here? I was up north, in the forest. One day, a trident appeared and moved south. And you followed it.
You have skipped a key there. And you know what happens then. I'm right, count it. - I did. I know that piano better than anyone who's ever played it.
You want to use it like a microphone. "Test, test." Don't hate. Follow it, girls. You have to talk to him.
So, then let's say morning prayers, okay? At eight o'clock, in the living room, today's class will begin, okay? Doesn't that sound good? Let's do it. The main goal in my life is to constantly strive to be my best self for the benefit of the whole planet and all the people who live on it.
Yes. Just straight ahead. Follow the signs. - There's a sign. - Yes, follow it.
No, you did fine, honey. Greg, I need a bat! - Dad, don't! - No, I'm not gonna hit the deer. I'm just gonna give him a little head rub with it.
You just want the headline if you save 3000 jobs in your district. - 12 votes? - 12 votes. I can get you 10, maybe 11. How refreshing to work with someone who saddles up a gift horse instead of looking it in the mouth.
It does not break. It does not weaken. My tail can stand all day... like a good soldier who wants to impress his superiors. My tail would win a medal if he could. They should name a school after him.
He is friendly and of good pedigree. Is that... what you want? The alternative is to take over Lady Mary's duties at Kenwood. But she's an old maid. Papa thought I couldn't find a match to raise my rank or match him.
- Don't touch me. We will never repeat our hanky-panky. No. That's not what you want. You don't want to put me on the ground. You want to bury me under him.
Don't. We are not now and never will be.... a couple. I'm not kidding. Don't you want to pass this truck? Are you going to crawl after it for the next 75 miles?
Then here's what we're going to do: Now that one ampoule is already lost, you and Mr Kane will kidnap this talking dog so we can examine it. And hopefully we'll manage to restore the formula, even though you idiots stuck the vials in somewhere without thinking. All right. Yeah, okay. So... What do we do with the dog when you're done with him?
You never told me you had a brother. He, uh... He's deceased. On a planet orbiting one of those points of light up there -- a barren, dark, burned-out place far from the home I never knew. He was born into a war, grew up in it, and it finally claimed him.
Okay, now breathe. Try to calm the waves. Try to slow them down. What's... what's the point? Well, the idea is, if you can teach your mind to calm the waves, you can teach it... to quiet the pain.
Very good. Then tell me why I am here. So I can check you out. For the vice presidency? The President values my advice, and he usually follows it.
So where did you put it? The tombstone? Someplace safe. That wasn't exactly our deal. Well, considering you betrayed me twice and I never betrayed you, I think I'm acting bravely, especially since we have no idea why this guy was looking for him.
And if you see a lion, do you know how it will behave? That depends on the lion. For a Maasai warrior, lions are nothing to be afraid of. But if I saw a lion, the lion would probably attack me. - Only if you threaten it.
Like it or not, this generation is responsible for passing on wildlife worldwide to the next generation. That means being considerate of the animals and the landscapes they live in so that there is still room for all of us to coexist. No one knows ... what the future holds for this little calf. Or even how the changes that will inevitably take place in Africa will affect the rest of the world and this little animal. But one thing is certain. What is happening here is more important than ever, and that the relationship of the rest of the world to this great continent ... and the beings that live in it, is more important than ever.
Every cop in Massachusetts works with her at some point. But we're doing the investigation now. Who's gonna do the autopsy? The governor has assigned the case to Dr. Vladimir Popov. Popov can't find his ass unless you put your hand on it.
All we know is he got away, and we're trying to get them everything we can. Tony, I want you to keep this conversation to yourself. Yes, sir. Anything else you can think of? Uh, the guy who had the locker next to him when he opened it had Mendoza written on the inside of it with a black magic marker:
Keep looking. He's got to be somewhere. Wait a minute. Why the pinched look on his face? Maybe we're standing on him.
Unless they make an apology to our pontiff. The session is closed. Riario-Sansoni is right about one thing: war is inevitable. - Did Cesare get our letter? - It will reach him this evening.
- To my new body. How it moves. Its power, its desire. My perfectly coiffed private parts. I liked how your body moved before you knew what you could do with it.
They owe me that. Then all we have to do is sign and write Chang a check for $50,000. He wants a bribe? For the girls' travel expenses. - The association will wire it to him. - No.
I just wanted to ask her if I could explain. And then I found her. She was lying in a... puddle of blood. The letter opener was sticking out of her chest. I should have called for help, but the thought was in my head, and I couldn't escape it.
Katherine Sullivan... Kenneth Unger... Cynthia Volk... and Vanessa Wendenberg. No matter when or where they served.... Whether the world knows their names, or only we know them.... our deserving colleagues continue to be a source of courage and inspiration to us. They all heard the same call to duty.... and they all followed it... without hesitation.
I see that this is going well. So maybe... we can talk about this later if you'd like. Let me ask you a question. Have you ever held a tiger salamander? Because I recommend you do that sometime and look it in the cute little eyes and tell it face to face, man to salamander, how it can say goodbye to its breeding ponds because you have a double air-conditioned
This is how it works. It brings your mind here temporarily. To go back, you have to reunite with your body. My body is not even here. Because every time you die, you wake up farther and farther away from it, and you wander around on the other side until you find it.
Why don't you sit in and test the engine? There's a red wire and a green wire. Go ahead. It's not rocket science. Give it some gas.
- Which is? You know that normal wolves never leave an injured member of the pack. They take care of it. They bring him food from a kill and then they regurgitate it into the injured wolf's mouth. They even give it physical and... emotional comfort by caring for it intensively.
Are you sure about that? I don't know anything for sure. The moon is full again today. Maybe that worries you. Maybe it does. Because maybe the moon really does have something to do with all this. Maybe I'm obsessed with him.
There you see. There is no "why." He put his dog on a very short chain. He beat him. Sometimes he didn't give him anything to eat for days.
Well, he succeeded. So the poison spreads even faster. I don't care. I just have to live long enough for my family to get the sextant. Now take me to him.
When we have the elf dust, you can rest. You can do whatever you want. Wait and see. What does it look like? Like dust. You can't see its power.
Was there a woman involved? Yes. That's good. Go ahead. Together we'll find out. I know. You were in a cowboy bar, and you stabbed the electric cop with a butter knife... ...and when he wouldn't die, you punched him in the face.
She's not your superior, Spalding. She is your employer. You are not part of this circle. My family has served this circle... for ten generations. I have devoted my life to it.
Mermaids can make themselves invisible, but the condition does not last. Sometimes nature can give us extra camouflage. Okay. Focus your energy on the ring. Merge with it, so to speak.
The trident has the same stone as the moon ring. But bigger. Yes. They share the same power source: moonlight. No wonder it's more powerful. That's why the danger he poses is also very great.
I wish you all the best. Please. Look, we can heal you. Make you stronger. Take the name "Scorch" and give it a meaning.
I am totally curious. I want to know everything about this place. It's one of the oldest houses in the area. It took me five years to get the deed. I would love to restore it to its original glory.
Relatives. He's related to her. Could you maybe tell us what you were doing here? This place has always been... a family secret. No one knows what happened to it... or to my great-great-great-whatever grandfather Lachlan.
- Alone? - No. You will take him with you, because you are the savior. You were created to break the curse. And once again... you can escape it.
- Let's face it. The tree beats us. - We're Pritchetts. We're not giving up. Just as an aside, all my tools are stuck in it.
Come here. Okay. It's a shark. Told you. Oh, my God! Don't make friends with him! Kill it!
Well, I'll be! Have you seen Grace? She was with the dog. What? It was shaking and had diarrhea, or maybe someone gave it DMT.
Go now! Secure the doors! Where's the trigger? Where is it? You'd never give it to an ordinary citizen.
- You want me to hypnotize Josef? You want me to solve your murder case to get our son back? It's our only chance. We're stuck with the investigation. If I see the boy again, talk to him again... ...and the killer finds out....
I swing it, it wraps around his neck, and I fight. I command him, "Sit, dragon." The dragon sits. I say, "Stay." The dragon stays. Now he's wearing a leash. I take him for a walk.
I command him, "Sit, dragon." The dragon sits. I say, "Stay." The dragon stays. Now he's wearing a leash. I take him for a walk. That's exactly where we are with him now.
The death of my son and the war. I have to leave Washington. I need help. This war ends tonight. And with it... our millennium of darkness.
Strange, isn't it? This reminds me of my childhood. My father told me about a stone. About a magical, legendary stone. He said, "If you find this stone, put it in front of you and tell it about your pains and secrets.
The boat is ready. We have to pull it through. There's a security van coming. What do we do? - Follow him.
Did you make a motion to adjourn in the Peabody v. Henderson case? It was accepted. - Good. Did the judge consider your motion for leniency in the case of Rogers v. Y entob? He granted it.
- Ok. Aren't you going to say anything? Is that what you want? The pain doesn't go away. You can only make room for it.
I saw the stray. I was going to shoot him. He was stuck in the mud. I threw rocks at him. I wanted to do it, shoot him in the head.
- You have to admit that. - You can't even call it masturbation, I mean, he's.... He's barely three years old. - Can you cover that-- cover that. - Well, his penis was fully erect and he was tampering with it.
What does that mean? As quickly as possible. She wants to get away from here. Maybe she wants a divorce, too. And what about me? Enjoy the river, my son, while you still live on it.
Most likely, it is already too late for you. You're giving up on us? - I will never give up on the teapot. I will wait and wait until the teapot destroys you. And then I will follow him to the next owner.
What is all this? We are restoring the proper appearance of this room. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. This is a seat for a conqueror. He needs a space that suits him, not vines and flowers.
I finally stood up on behalf of everyone and told Miss Emily we should have come sensible food, not leftovers from her Mexican fast food. Then she told me not to raise my voice and brutally pulled me into the other room, dislocating my arm. Are you sure? Are you sure you didn't just fall asleep on it? Does this look like I fell asleep on it?
- Sergeant. She's like you? That's funny. This case wasn't even on my radar. But now I'm certainly going to give it my full attention.
- No. This is not a hotel, my boy. You can't choose your accommodation here. A new cell, a quiet cell... I will now take this bone in my hand and chew on it.
Because in a few months I will lead Rosa out of school as Mrs. Edwin Drood. And then she'll travel with me to our new life in the Orient, and we'll both be happy forever because we both want it that way. Then you don't take my warning seriously? Ethelinda, reverent wife of Mr. Thomas Sapsea, mayor, land dealer, auctioneer, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera in the local town, whose knowledge of the world, though quite extensive, has never introduced him to a mind more capable of looking up to him in humility.
- With pleasure. Have a nice evening. Forgive me, Lily. You really know where the wolf is? And what do you want to do with him?
Then I stole all kindness from heaven, clothed myself in such humility that I drew devotion from all hearts, from their mouths greetings and cheers. The fluttering king, he jumped up and down, pranced with shallow buffoons, mixed the court with silly fools, he gave himself to the common people. Then, when the occasion arose to be seen, he was no better than the cuckoo in June, heard but not heeded. And in the same rank, Heinrich, you stand, since you forfeited your princely privilege through low traffic. There is no eye to which the sight of you does not excite weariness, as mine, which has desired more to see you, which now does what I would like to refuse it, and blinds itself from foolish tenderness.
Heinrich, you rob me of my youth. Oh Percy, you are dust and food for worms, brave Percy. Farewell, great heart. Ill-woven ambition, how art thou so shrunk. When this body yet held a spirit, A kingdom was too tiny a space for him. Now two steps of the meanest earth are room enough for him.
Gian Luca Ventura." "My dear Gian Luca, whoever says that time heals all wounds has never loved like me. I must confess to you a monstrosity: Neither to my husband, nor to the unborn child, nor to God do I have even a hint of a guilty conscience. If I curse the day we met, it is only because it was followed by the day we parted.
- Really? - No. Just watch. Lissa will turn to us. She was right. Matty didn't want to be replaced either. If I wanted to get him to back down, I had to make out in front of him without restraint.
What about you, sugar jaw? I'm still looking for some kind of emotional connection. I have a creeping feeling that I'll never find it. Which is why I feel sad. And lost, and strangely horny, like I want to fuck the pain away. Take that pain... And hold on to it.
You can go. Without electricity, he will die, but it will take time. He won't even die right away if he's already decomposing. What if I want it to go faster? Cut off his head and remove what's inside.
To which you, as a prominent contemporary artist, are added.... supposedly. So what don't you like about the plan? Alex. Is she or is she not going to kill me? Alex parks the truck in the back. After they load it up, we follow him to the meeting with Spiteri.
It is like a coma. But it's not physical, it's mental. It's like his brain has shut down. There's got to be a way to treat this. Maybe if she used her own blood. What difference does it make? The only way to break a blood potion is to kill the hexenbiest whose blood is in it.
Explain to people exactly what is happening and when it is happening. And please tell them I'll talk to them as soon as I can. Calm down. Is that the mother? I'll take it from here. Thank you very much. I need to see him now!
Until then, I hope I will have enough time to fulfill my duty. However, if not, you will take my place. The labyrinth is a symbol of the Grail. This ring, take good care of it. The other guardians will recognize you by it.
- How does he deal with it? - He has to deal with a dead woman. Hey. What's going on with you? This Nero guy-- what the hell is going on with him?
So you got something from her, the person you were looking for? Yes. - Can I see it? - No. Pour this over the object and then follow it.
You have done nothing wrong. I will eat this heart now, then we can go pick azaleas. Jing! My eyes committed treason. And no matter how many times I would see your body, I would always be enchanted by it.
- I don't think so. - Well, unlikely is the wrong word. - Isn't it a survival strategy? Accepting pain as part of life. Embracing it instead of avoiding it.
I can't believe we're not getting married. Excuse me, I'm going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a bridesmaid. So I told my wife, "buy a dog, don't buy a dog..." "I don't walk him, I don't feed him, I don't clean up after him."
Excuse me, I'm going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a bridesmaid. So I told my wife, "buy a dog, don't buy a dog..." "I'm not walking him, I'm not feeding him, I'm not cleaning up after him." You already know you're going to end up walking him.
Your attitude was no accident. If the tenants there buy someone's story, it's you. Well, they're hardly going to buy it from him. Or is he just testing me? Watching me to see how far I'll go to keep the job. Even though I told him right off why I was getting into it.
And what did he say? Yeah, okay, thanks. That was the highway patrol. They say Granger beat someone up and stole his pickup truck. - They put out an APB on him.
Ubiquitous? She is everywhere. She's probably watching us right now. A tourist from Tijuana gave me this tip: Jalapeño gives it a good bite.
You are not supposed to lie... but if you were to go a little crazy... we could build a defense strategy around that... and convince twelve people... that you don't know right from wrong. You heard me calling? I don't think I can take this anymore. Death would be better. I used to be afraid of him...but I'm not anymore.
Where is he? Up here! Look up! Cam, what are you doing up there? I wanted to say goodbye to the tree. Give him one last hug, and before I knew it, I was sitting up here.
We know you inside and out. The other day I was walking home when I saw a beetle on the sidewalk. Of course I went on without stepping on it. Then I stopped, thought about it and went back. - Did you propose to him too?
For The Secret of the Black Gloves, Lombardo was the only one who trusted Dario as director. Halfway through the shoot, however, he was to be replaced by Ferdinando Baldi. Only the fierce opposition from his father Salvatore and from Dario himself prevented Dario from leaving the film prematurely. Lombardo then gave in and let Dario finish the film. But when he saw the film, he didn't like it.
We even ran into a controller who, when he saw the camera, asked, "Yeah, what's that for?" At that time, you didn't see film cameras around that often. He even let us into the train cab and we took great shots from there. I then took the film to Dario in Rome, he had it developed and liked it.
I'm not a cop, Fermin, but if you want my help, you need to tell me what he left in your cab. He left a laptop. He left it under the seat. He must have left it. What did you do with it?
Who are you? - What do you want? - This is Captain Marat. What's in the backpack? Take it away from him!
My face reflects how much I fought... for the good of the people without caring about them. And it's worse without the wig. The people elected me to represent them. They lead, and I lead. You should try to do the same. I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens, and I've tried to follow your example, but... if I listened to you, I would have freed all the slaves when the first shell hit Fort Sumter. The border states would have joined the Confederacy, the war would have been lost... and with it, the Union. And instead of abolishing slavery, as we hope to do, we would have to watch helplessly as it spread, from the Southern states to South America.
Cornell, charm is the last thing you need when working with an elephant. Every creature needs to know who sets the tone. They can sense when a man is in, let's say, full force, and when a man is, let's say, not in full force. First of all, you can't do anything with an elephant without an elephant hook, can you? And with him, you have to present yourself as a gentleman right away.
We have lost our way. Without food, without clothes, without meat! We have each other. The compass points north. We will follow it.
Over. I also need to look at the generator, we have no power. Why did you lock the door? So no one could get in and light us up! Wait a minute, wait a minute. I thought you were sealing the house against this virus? There's nothing we can do except minimize the risk. It's not just the virus, it's the people who are trying to escape it.
It never occurred to us that we would find him, but that is exactly what we did. He tore my best friend in two. In a flash. And then he came at me. I hacked and hacked at him with my axe.
Tell me. Tell me who it is. Give me a name. He wants her, not you. If you want to save your skin, just give him what he wants.
- Uh, we'll buy you a drink, okay? Dale's handling it. - KENNY: Yeah? - Uh, I can't buy him a drink.
No. Then we play something. - Yes. I'm thinking of a dog. What about him?
He set the bar pretty high, didn't he? Kal-El would never admit to his dark side. And that's why he's gonna die here. But you, you can be saved. If you're brave enough to walk the dark path... If you honor it.
- Embarrassing. Excuse me. Who are you? Intelligence analyst Nell Jones. The algorithm, as Chambers uses, is unproven, and no substitute for human intel. I've played with it a good bit.
Rick. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, I'll call the superintendent. Yesterday the stove came on all by itself. Great, now we just have to teach it to make us breakfast. Hey!
Run. - What happened? - Klaus is in Alaric's body. - What? - He's possessing him or something.
Are you saying the oldest vampire ever has it in for me? - I missed you. - Klaus. Klaus is in Alaric's body. He's possessing him.
Well, it could be worse. It is worse! They fly Manhattan into the sun! They don't have to have piranhas anymore. They will destroy the virus by exposing it to the heat of our burning bodies!
The gelatinous peace dance. You may be gelatinous, but not even the Mochi Phantom could perform such intricate movements. Says you, Japanese office worker. What does the medical crab do? Behold: the peace dance. The dance is so complex, I can hardly follow it.
It's good to be home. Yes, the area is impressive. I've seen it a thousand times, but I always try to discover something new when I come back. The biggest volcanoes on earth close enough to touch. It's invigorating, electrifying. I've spent a lot of my life snowboarding here, and this place is as much a part of me as I am a part of it.
Henry, are you all right? I don't feel well. I think it's the wine. Yes. There's something in it.
Zane has the lens system almost running again. - I'm going down. - Keep me posted. Dr. Martin, you're overseeing the transfer of the FTL drive. Yes, he's already been moved to a secure location. Okay, great, you should stay with him and I'll be in touch as soon as everything's back under control here.
The earth. This planet. - So, this is your plan? - Our planet. Show it pictures and hope it says the words in Skitter language?
Why would you pay such a sum for a fucking Gaul? Shit? Do you not see the promise in his eyes? The smoldering spark in his chest? I would give him opportunity to ignite it in the arena!
Why would you pay such a sum for a fucking Gaul? Shit? Do you not see the promise in his eyes? The swelling spark in his chest? I would give him opportunity to ignite it in the arena!
- Well, it's his decision. - His decision? Idiots like him shouldn't be allowed to make any... It's his body, okay? And you don't get to tell him what he can and can't do with it.
A blasphemer and a heretic. You scare me, sometimes. War is ugly, Cardinal. Far uglier than I could ever be. One should approach it with extreme caution.
And now I want to know too, shit! A guy finds a penguin on the beach. He goes to the police... ...and asks what to do with it. The cop says, "Take him to the zoo."
He goes to the police... and asks what he should do with it. The policeman says, "Take him to the zoo." To which the guy replies, "Good idea!" "I'll go to the zoo with him."
To which the guy replies, "Good idea!" "I'll go to the zoo with him." Two days later... the policeman is back on patrol... and he runs into the guy with the penguin. He asks him, "Did you take him to the zoo?"
- You know that. So help me. All right, if Nadia's in imminent danger, we need evidence for Joan. Continue your surveillance and initiate agent threat protocol. Make sure you go in like a top tail. The van can't know you're following it if you're in front of it.
- Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Oh, my God. Oh my G... I made it happen. I'm like Joe Pisarcik the greeting card executive, drop the ball so Herm Edwards can run with it back to win.
It's delicious! I have not drunk something so delicious for ages and three days. We were bribed with the wine. There was a big envelope in the box. In it were several smaller envelopes.
Good morning, sinners. I may say this when I myself am a sinner. I know the dark path of drunkenness and debauchery. I have walked on it.
- I'm so sorry. Is that okay? - No, that was great. It just feels so good and sensual. Do you want me to wiggle it a little?
Kiss me. Fuck off! This joint is full of sand. This is a summer joint. The sand gives it a vacation scent.
This moral crusade does not suit you. The Zoe Morgan I know is reasonable. Knows when to be smart. I'll get you the report. I'll take you right to it.
My father was a butcher. - Yes, good. We've already found a lot there. The door opens :) Bösiger is looking for you. Oh, a rabbit! May I give him a leaf?
If I wanted to be sexy, something got stuck in my teeth. Berries were my enemies. And my mom embarrassed me every chance she got. - Is the push-up bra doing a good job? - Yes, but give it a day off.
From it everything originated! But what was before the big bang? Nothing. Yes. So, and now the nothing dissolves our cosmos. Because it doesn't like him any more or perhaps saw something ugly.
I could never tell when my first wife came, but I can tell for sure when a storm is coming. All right, so what's the plan? What do we do if it really snows? You're so white, I'm afraid we're going to lose you. I love snow and opening the balcony door and watching it fall, like fresh white linen, and then running across the street to the park and making snow angels....
Allah, give me the patience. My Sultana, the messenger is waiting for the letter. I should take it to him. It will surely reach İbrahim, won't it, Gülfem? Don't worry, I'll give it to the treasurer's messenger.
You are the smartest person I know, and that is something incredibly beautiful. Remember what you said about generative processes? Genius. That helped me a lot. I just thought that your robot could learn more if it was exposed to more environments. You're probably right, but I don't think they'd let me take him for a walk.
Exactly. Why would the military experiment on a butterfly? A butterfly has two life stages. It is one of the few creatures with proven abilities to abruptly change its body structure. This makes it a wonderful alpha test subject.
Interesting. - Is there anything that can help us identify him? - Identification by dental records was inconclusive. We have the remains of a belt, which means the man was probably carrying a wallet, which would mean it's probably still in the shark until it's digested. We could find a finger inside it and get a print from that.
- I didn't kill him. - I know you didn't. That's why I'm still talking to you. I thought Concordia was more agricultural. Before our wars ended, they turned it into a mining base.
War is unacceptable. We have been led to believe that we must participate in it. But when the decision to fight is made, we have already lost. Forgive me, Your Grace, but shouldn't we oppose war on humanitarian grounds? I oppose it because it is an affront to life as such.
I certainly did. Do you remember this ring? I took it from the first girl we ever had together. You loved him so much. Kept asking what happened to him.
I am sorry. I have to leave. We will be deployed in three days. Let me get the report from Zirmaya for you. Taw will be back with him in 2 minutes.
But I just have to go like this. And like this. Then he's not so Catholic anymore. When I was a little girl in Ireland, every spring I saw a scruffy man with a little bantam rooster. He had taught him to peck The Mountains of Mourne on a toy piano that hung from his chest.
Well, okay special details! Amy! Amy! You saw my notice in the paper store window. Yeah, with this one above it, which is weird because Amy hasn't written it yet!
You really think I would kill a dog? What else was I supposed to think? I don't know. How about: I didn't kill a dog? Then tell me what you did with him.
- Even higher. Listen, Jules has Travis issues, so she's gonna flatten you. She's like a shark, Kristen. You know what you do when a shark attacks you? You punch it in the nose.
- Where did you find it? - It was in my shoe. You don't have a very good sense of smell. Max will be thrilled. Why don't you give it to him? No.
Okay! You got him? - I got him. Head first! Get over there. Get him in.
Here is a copy of the flow for the dedication. I emailed you the flow that we worked out. Right. I've seen the draft. It's just putting the finishing touches on it.
The neural interface. The chair? I think it can cure them. It's very simple. What I've learned so far is that the chair probably won't allow anyone who isn't human to connect to it.
- The chest. He hit you in the forehead? Yes. So he was looking at you when he drew blank. Yet he had a rock that you didn't see until he hit you with it.
Small splashes on the right heel and calf, but not on the left. She pulled a roller case with her right, otherwise you do not get these splash patterns. A small suitcase, according to the scattering. Suitcase of this size, woman in such clothes -conscious- it can be only a travel suitcase. So she wanted to stay one night. - Where is he, what have you done with him?
No, no, don't do that! It's the way I like it! The way you like it? ! No, no, no, Jen, he's infected! If this was a human, I'd shoot him in the face!
These traps are human. They do not kill the animal. If you've used these things before you would know that they don't work properly, misfire, or break the beaver's legs. - Oh. - That's not true. Then you have to shoot the beaver or hit it on the head with a shovel.
Until this moment we followed Moreau, it is a choice, - not a necessity. - You are right. But we've never been in this situation before. I think we have a chance to take Damien Moreau out of the game before he does any more damage. We didn't choose the fight, but we're in it, and we should see it through.
- No, no. - Hold out your arm. - I'm not gonna... No, no, no, no. - Put it in here. Get him in.
Get him in. You know you want to. You do. All right, maybe, maybe just... - You know you want to... - Get him in.
Finn Haugan? The hunters say they are not bear tracks. That's ridiculous. What kind of tracks is it then? It's a bear with bear tracks leading to it.
There must be a secret entrance. Did he say where? I'm sorry, that's all I know. Then your work is not done, sister. When you find your entrance, you must lead us to it.
I really like the part with the parking meter. It sounds like dad. And how. The robot needs D-type batteries. And parts of him were made in Mexico.
- You killed our child. And with it also us. - Let us anticipate the most important thing: There is a difference between having a child and having a dog. A dog loves you unconditionally as long as you give it its food.
- Martha told you. I know you draw a face on your penis with markers. Is that forbidden? I don't think so. You put a little hat on it and you call it Sammy.
Our attack was not about a weapon forge. It was about this dagger. After the battle, Tus asked for the dagger as tribute. I thought nothing of it, but now I understand. With it, he could change everything.
How is this supposed to work? Basically, it works like a ramp. The train goes along here. This part here will lift up the flange and throw it off the track. This will cause the train to tip over to the right side. The son of a bitch doesn't even know what's happening to it.
The puck lands in the corner where Nubin grabs it. - What's the matter with him? - What's the matter with Donnelly, Jim? What the hell, Donnelly, get in there! The puck is free, Donnelly flies after it on the boards... and manages to get it.
Here. Take it. -You okay? -Merlin's ring. It's been a while since I've been this close to him.
Or the dreams of those who are less fortunate in this world. Can you pay for them? Or are you also desperate that you can not change everything? What goes wrong in this world. You know, I had a dream. But I also ran away from it.
I am here because he was expelled. - It doesn't matter. I do. See that train? It's ours. We could take it all the way to Texas.
I didn't want it for me. I just... I thought it would be nice to have a bottle there in case we got guests. But you didn't go in. The important thing is not that you had the urge, but that you resisted it.
Dr Finkel. Dr. Finkel. It is my pleasure, Mr. Wolfson. I'll just wait until you fail, and then I'll take over. Gravity, behave. I don't know what's weirder, that you're carrying around this mindless rodent or that you're having a conversation with him.
I was not such a sissy as my son! Through the forest I drove them. The worst of all I caught in a trap I made myself! So, rule number 1! You have a head to go through the wall with him!
You again, Kanna Endo.... Would he stand around here if it was so dangerous. Well, the robot was remote controlled from there! But it doesn't look like that at all! It looks like they faced him in battle!
Do you have it, Rain? The flash drive? - With the information? - Kawamura didn't have anything on him. Did you check everywhere? I searched him. He didn't have the flash drive. Then everyone will keep looking for him.
Supposedly, he slew a "Dog" Paulson.... ...when our Bandidos were putting the Southern California motorcycle gangs... ...out of the crank business in Southern California. And we're almost certain he stabbed a Mexican in 2003. And any bets, the way he usually deals with rivals... he's the prime suspect in the disappearance... of our dearly missed Krazy-8. May the scumbag rest in peace. We dragged Tuco in for questioning... ...but we couldn't pin anything on him.
There's a passenger flight from L.A. to Guam. It flies right through your window. Ajira Airways, flight 316. If you have any hope of getting back to the island, it has to be that flight. You all have to fly on it.
Norton Construction just sent us this. Whoa, mama! I love Great Lakes wine. - You can keep the wine. I want to take the cheese and do horrible things to it.
The killer's dead, Abby. I should have cut that tree down a long time ago. Come on, come on. Let's get out of here. Look, sooner or later, I would have walked past that tree, so I thought... Why would I avoid him? Yes.
Perhaps too clever, Ranakar. We should have seen the signs. Until Sinestro gets a chance to explain himself, I remain skeptical. One thing is certain. You took the ring from the wrong man. If you ask me, you should give it back to him.
And one last thing about my girlfriend that I think you both should know. The reason Jessica calls me so late at night is because she's a vampire. I can't work. And why not? Because every time I see the pool table, you're still on it, and then I can't think about anything else.
Velociraptor was barely 2 meters tall. And "Jurassic Park" grossed over a million dollars? Who's afraid of a bird? You would be if it ripped your guts out with a giant beak. Constance, how big would a bird have to be for you to be afraid of it?
I was in the mess hall for 5 minutes, when I came back he was already in the chair. The seizures have stopped, but he is not responding to anything. He is in a deep catatonic state. Is there anything you can do to help him? We could inject him with a high dose of lorazepam. Maybe it will help him, but I have absolutely no idea.
This film thematizes a quest for purification, but also for everything that can be spiritual about the carnal existence of our body for something spiritual in the material. I can not crawl into the minds of the viewers. There is the spectator who loves him and looks at him until the end the one who looks at him until the end without loving him and the one who leaves the hall after a while.... I think that the author should not be in the mind of the spectator. A viewer should be free to love the film or not ask questions about it, or just watch it.
Have you seen Phil or a blood trail leading to him? He's not here. And I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe the meatball isn't absorbing enough nutrients. I guess I could try giving him a mouthful.
I don't need any help. Besides, my Parisian salad doesn't need chives. Yes. I always thought it was a little bland. The chives will give it the bite it lacks.
Ted, tell me he wrote you a check. Tell me he wrote you a... big, fat check. A check so big, he won't take his shirt off when he goes swimming. That's a big, fat check. A check so big that if you had sex with him, you wouldn't tell your friends.
One more unimportant thing, how to make an email unsent? - Sit. - I'm sitting. So, how was your day? To be honest, I have to give it a C-, which also happens to be the grade that Courtney.... got for her polar bear project.
I don't know why everyone thinks Graham is so great. I've been to camp with the guy and he's a ... he's a creep. What? You knew him the whole time? I had a plan from the beginning and I was supposed to stick with it.
I think it's hitting them at least. Jules, if you don't show this cock-controlled bastard, I will. No, no. I want to do it. What's with the weird mirror? No, no. Stay away from him.
Moment. Something is happening with the lift. The lift is working. This is our chance. Jo, get in there. Tell them what we know. Try to get Lambert's group to turn on him before he blows it all up - and everyone with him.
We played again until the morning. I've been playing for years and he thinks he can win. Idiot. Give it to the poor people. Give these feathers to women to stuff pillows and blankets with. It makes me crazy to know that the diamond is with him.
We'll do a test now, and you concentrate. No matter what I say, you must remain neutral. No problem. You're walking down the hall here and you see a pretty young lady coming towards you. Her blouse is tight and gaping at the buttons. Her pencil falls to the floor. As she bends down to pick it up, her blouse parts to reveal her delicate, round, white mounds.
Thank you. Thank you! And tomorrow we will continue to work! There are now men of a special male sex power. The sex wind in the loins of these men... is more fiery than windy in nature. Attached to it are 2 tent-like formations, which surround the trunk of all male forces and consolidate and erect it.
I'm the fairy Todd something, Take a step back or you'll be transformed Turk, wand. Yeah, the wand... I lent it to that idiot.
Just like those horrible mice. May they rest in peace. Good morning. Your body needs attention. Give it the care it deserves.
- I can smell it all the way here. - I can't help it. The demon told me to do everything in the house today. It doesn't want me to exorcise it. Yeah, next time you and your demon are chatting, tell it to get lost and get a job.
25 and 3 in '78. Red Ruffing. What do you know about that? I know that his curve ball lowered like it was falling off a table. All you could do was applaud him.
All right. I'm pulling over. I don't see you. That's the point, but I see you. Now hang up, get out of the car, leave the money in the trunk, and make him come to it.
"Ram vs. Ayatollah II." Bob's used car dealership in Arizona is doing pretty well, I hear. Bob takes the old turban out of the mothballs for this kind of thing. Yes? - Yeah. Well, bring him in.
We almost managed to catch him. Because he went up very slowly. But when we almost reached him, my friend lost his temper and let out a scream. Just a moment sooner, and we would have caught him and then torn him to pieces like the rabbit. I cannot tell how he would have tasted. We told him what a big coward he was in our eyes. And how much he would regret it if we ever caught him.
I hope you like your room... I just moved in last night. and i feel right at home. thank you for letting me stay, lex. take another look at your resume. Yeah, I thought I'd give it another shot.
With me and with everyone else here. It's not tuberculosis. Excuse us for a second. Cancer explains the symptoms. A tumor in her lung or kidney that's throwing clots on her other organs. And you think the tumor could overhear us, and we'd be on to it?
Hey, new guy. I know it's the rule to always wear the helmet, but this is the canteen, relax. But what if there's an incident? If I'm not prepared, someone could hit me on the head. Give him a week, he'll relax.
As long as I can keep it in check. I just don't understand why it's reacting this way. I mean, if we go too deep, the sub will implode and you'll die, and the parasites will lose their host. I don't think it's a rational life form, Will. It may just infect the host and live in it as long as it can, and then move on.
Yes! - To us. - Thank you. Where's my damn coat? I want it back. You can wave to him during your trial.
I am not a nerd! But also not the right one for this kind of sport. (NEW BOOK BY ANGELICA BUTTON) -It's the last book. -I can't wait to see what happens. Talvez Sadreux is no narglop. I heard a rumor that Spiderman is behind him.
You are questioning my honor! Yes, I'm glad you didn't say "downsize," that would have given me a field day, but poison gas? That is the weapon of cowards and you know it. Stall, you could blow this planet out of the sky. And you sit up there and watch it die.
I'm a little pissed off. We went to the Black Bull first, just to hang out. That's a new Simon. You used to cry when your dad poured whiskey over the Christmas pudding. At least I didn't throw up on the plate when there were peas on it!
We need at least 347 tons here. Shoot the dog, Corporal! Sir, shouldn't we be saving our ammo for the enemy? Shoot the damn mutt! Darnold, just give him some of your meat.
Where are we? I couldn't tell you. Walter is hiding something. He's as secretive as ever. He says he has to keep the cylinder safe. That someone's looking for it.
I know he liked you a lot, and I know you're going to miss him. And we're really going to miss him, too. But what about his cape? Jamie, he's... Jamie, honey, listen to me. He's going to like it.
I don't know. I mean, one bad movie and then this? I mean, was I really that bad? Honestly, Vinnie, the movie was bad. And yes, you were bad in it.
Until I know the truth, everyone is responsible for me. They were seen an hour ago, on their way to the city. I will not allow murderers to go unpunished. I used to love this place. Now it just gives me the creeps.
As if each one is different in itself, and yet all the same again. That's it. If you had tasted the wine before, its aroma would prevail throughout the meal. Now it is accompanied by the wine. The first taste is the most important. Because the second one always follows it.
Is it customary for Uther to chain friends to a dungeon wall? The stone. You had it in the forge. Why? With it, a man can change the very nature of things.
That's not BoIt. It depends on how you look at it. When I was little, I wanted a bike for my birthday, but my parents gave me a baseball glove. You know what I did? I pretended the baseball glove was a bike and rode it to school every day.
We can't let... him walk towards the valley and take his revenge. He will, he will... Your mind is like this water, my friend. When it is stirred, nothing can be seen. But if you give it time to calm down, the answer becomes clear.
According to the latest news, an institute employee was critically injured by a gunshot to the abdomen. Come on, kids, run. Quickly. We say, "That guy in the uniform is a pig, he's not human." And so we have to deal with him.
I think we are asking the wrong questions. What questions should we be asking? Let's start with this. Where is our satellite? We have lost contact with it.
I'm helping Bambi. So give me the resuscitator and the saline. I'll start an IV. Thank you. Still no sign of Burke. Oh, you have a severed arm. My arm. Mine. Get away from him.
The color will be on you soon. Looks good, Johnny. I just talked to the store, E's getting the table this afternoon. Yeah, excellent. Hope he likes it or you'll be paying for my therapy.
But I know a change will come. Oh, yes, it will... The future is for my children, for our young people. It's not just Chávez's struggle, it's our struggle. What Chávez triggered is the recognition of this struggle, and we are united in it. And we will continue to fight.
I mean, maybe these people just want to destroy themselves. Maybe we're fighting a losing battle. - Is it you or the demon chick talking? - Oh, that's me. The demon is dead and so is the hot chick who was possessed by him.
I won't tell Ned. I'll leave that to you. I'll put the liquor by my bed. John Joseph. If you're... ...afraid of a ghost, face it.
This course in self-confidence seems to work wonders. - We have a huge team. - Well... The project is safe. Let's drink to progress and the birth of the universe. Give me a bird on a raft, but stay out of the meadow and pin a rose on it, will you?
The next tool for profit and control is war. Since the enactment of the central bank in 1913, a number of major and minor wars have been started, the three most pronounced being World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War. World War I. In 1914, European wars broke out centered around England and Germany. The American people wanted nothing to do with the war, so President Wilson publicly declared neutrality. However, under the surface, the U.S. government was looking for any excuse to join it.
He would only suffer from the huge fuss that would be created. Mom, are we really keeping him? Kôichi said he wants to keep him. He's very weak... Let's help him.
He was weak and sensitive during the day. At night, he became a vicious, ruthless beast. He woke up every morning covered in blood, and could never remember what he had done the previous night. He led a wild, ruthless life, just like the spirit that followed him like a shadow. But even that came at a price. The more he used the spirit for his own interests, the more his body became like it.
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar! He took on a dragon Other men could only laugh Then he took his saber And stabbed him in the skull
W ay up! There was a tree that had leaves that were all new and green. It had silver branches. And a bird came every day and sat on it and sang. And he sang and sang and sang. He was a damn good singer, the bird, but he was only very small and brown. And then this woman, this beautiful woman would always come and listen to him. And...
But maybe it's worth it. Dying in freedom is better than living in a cage. If you keep this up, I'll think you're trying to stage a coup. Then why don't you execute me like you executed the pigeon? By the way, Your Highness, the falcon is also your slave. It flies only to destinations that its master tells it to.
What a surprise! You didn't expect that, did you? Actually, I was just going to have a... Then I saw you! Up there on the tower, fooling around with him!
No magic. In our Golden Age, when blood flowed like wine and flesh flowed like thicker wine, we learned that our existence depended on a rare mineral stone, the "low stone. We call it "shadow stone." It is hidden and locked away safely here at Berm Tech. It is essential to our survival. The Shadow Stone glows and enriches the enzyme in our heart. As long as we stay within a mile of it and eat regularly, we can stay healthy.
Have you ever seen a shark? - No. Great, we're having shark for dinner today! Zane! Here, hit him with this!
- No. Great, we're having shark for dinner today! Zane! Here, hit him with this! Go on, hit him! Shark...
Mr. Yi. I recognized your voice. Make the collar a little narrower, it fits the face better. Yes. A narrow collar suits him better.
Oh, hot stuff on my tooth! No, thanks! He's a first-class tooth puller. If I listened to him, I would no longer have my own teeth! It goes fast with him.
What did she say? She means the deadline doesn't mean shit. What do you mean? I think she's been on this film for 5 minutes. We've been after it for two years.
I was ordered to play. With a pass and a penalty? - Without. I trained with. - I don't care! Faith is life, he who does not desire to spread the faith... and to profess it, shows...
Well, until a moment ago I wanted you dead, but now it seems you have something I need. What? The emerald. You know where it is. Don't tell me you haven't dreamed of it, heard it calling you, begging to be found at its dark hiding place.
- What have you found out? - We have problems. Did it take you five minutes to figure that out? The satellite is basically a stripped-down ship... ...with an engine, a shield and navigation systems. It has a small power source that allows it to reach its destination. and keep it powered up until the gate is dialed.
That was your last transformation. No. Oh, God. Dean, wait. What good is this trick? Fainting won't help him survive.
Why are you so sure? You are my daughter. You see? Death is not so bad. Once you face it, it's something beautiful.
You liar' you blabbermouth. Cuckoo! Why do you say cuckoo? Don't give him any more to drink. Peadar himself told me that you brought a big goat to the pub in a drunken stupor, combed his spitzban and gave him beer and hugged Tomäs Inside.
As true as the love for my unborn baby. What's your plan, Travis? - Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there are other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they learned to live with the planet, not just on it.
- I don't think Vince wants to go there. - Why not? He and I kind of have different views on the movie. - Different how? - Well, he likes it.
- Why not? He and I kind of have different views on the film. - Different how? - Well, he likes it. He likes it?
Maybe that way we'll have access to the database. "In London lies a knight buried by a pope." Cross-referenced terms: knight, pope, grail. Your precious treasure was almost lost and with it my fortune.
He would be found on his bed.... lying on his back, with Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead"... and an unfinished letter to Exxon.... complaining about the confiscation of his gas card. So he wanted to indict the system and achieve something with his death... that was more than what death itself achieved. At the last moment, he changed his mind on one point.... And decided to buy a connoisseur's wine to take the pills.... instead of a "Ripple" or "Thunderbird". So he made his last trip to "Tiny's Liquors," a store...known for good wines.... and bought a bottle of 2001 Azalea Springs Merlot...which cost him nearly $70. Back home, he uncorked the wine, let it breathe, drank a few glasses and wanted to do something.... meaningful, but he couldn't think of anything.
There will be consequences! I owe you a great debt of gratitude. Guard this ring well. It will grant you three wishes. How? Turn it and say the wish clearly, and it will be granted.
Are you leaving me because I'm a psychiatrist? Among other things. Let's start all over again. I have someone else. I want to be with him.
Make sure I get to see something like that first from now on. Okay. Do you ever play chess? What's that got to do with this case? He made a move, and he liked your counter-move.
And when the tape stops, you will have one minute to find a way out.... When the minute is up, well, you should know best what happens then. There's a simple key that opens the breastplate, Kerry. It's right in front of you. All you have to do is reach for it.
Jack, you should know Curtis and his team subdued a terrorist at the hospital. - Did they apprehend him? - No, he's dead. But they found a nerve gas canister. They're trying to disarm it now.
I'm guessing you've heard of Chicken. Rooster. And yes, we sensed it. That's why we were afraid the staff had been stolen. As soon as it left his hands, we went looking for it.
I trusted you with him. I trusted you not to cheat on me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What did you do to him?
So far away from home. If you want to go back, we can help. Why should I leave this place? A world of industry, labor and war. - I could give him a job.
Good that my mother is not here. For that thing, she would fight the wolf with her bare hands. - And she would win. - Where is the wolf? - I don't trust this silence. - Why are you traveling with him?
Let's at least wait for reinforcements. We don't have time. Volnek was wise enough to deactivate to deactivate the Eye of the Gods. The crystal... is in his possession. Only with it can we return to Earth. and that means killing Volnek.
We have high expectations of you, Doctor. The higher post also brings a higher level of security. I'm sure you're aware of the ring. - Yes, sir. What you don't know is... we've used it to visit over a dozen uninhabited worlds.
- Good. But I'm not surprised. He's tried to stop me before. - The demon? (I'm on his trail.
It was not you who gave me air. It was your jailers! They built this place all those years ago. They need me alive! Because if you escape, I have to stop you. If I destroy your prison, your body will be destroyed. And your mind with it?
With Karl, too. I didn't have to worry about my feelings. Yes, yes, lightning should strike. You really think so? You're probably right, but I don't trust him anymore.
- I'm all yours. - With all the ice cream trucks in Miami... - a little coincidental, don't you think? - Sure, during business hours. But in the after hours, one such truck stands out. And you've been following it.
It's in the van, in the garage at 2249 Polk Street. The key is under the brick. You've stolen so much, this thing isn't over. This thing is not over. The problem with this Republican prick is... he doesn't have the blood of his political fathers in him.
Walter! Walter! You're right. He's gone. Where's my dog? ! What have they done with him?
You must have some kind of guardian angel. Thank you, doctor. - Okay, so death was after me? - Yes. - How did I get away from him?
- It was completely full of blood. - Yes, my blood. Which makes the rug a part of me. I want him back. I want to be buried with him.
So every morning when I get up, I take it off the dresser and put it away. I empty my pockets, and there it is again. I have experienced different things with this stone. I have had amazing experiences. Once a man from South Africa saw the stone fall out of my hand. He asked me, "What is this?" What is it? I explained it to him, and he called the stone Gratitude Stone.
Tracy Jordan is the third heat. I don't know where we should make room in our budget for a guy like Tracy Jordan. I think I do. What do you do? Sometimes I have these stress dreams, if I fall asleep in the dream, I escape from it.
There won't be many women who want to be with someone like him. It's usually worst in the morning. Especially if I've been lying on my arm at night. If I sleep on my back or have my arms out, I'm usually fine. So the arm only hurts if you've been lying on it all night?
Me too, of course. Really? And how do you deal with your wolf? Well, the first thing I did was accept that he was there. I made friends with him.
No, they won't It's just a tantrum, Ted. I used to see this in kindergarten. This isn't kindergarten. Mr. Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball. Okay, I'll give it back to him if you show him your plans.
Is my wife there? Yes, she is there. Well, let's go get her. In 15 seconds, a black jeep will pass by the entrance of the parking lot. Run to it.
The thought never occurred to me. Harry was everything I needed. ItwasHarrywhoalwayshadtheanswers. He knew what was good, bad, safe and dangerous. I have lived my life according to Harry's code, according to him.
- I'm not going to yell at you. - Are you shitting your pants? - Are you out of your mind or what? - Are you afraid of the dog? - I'm not afraid of him.
There is something I have to tell you. Were the dice cast from the beginning? Or is it in our own hands to change the course of destiny? Of all our abilities, it is free will that makes us truly unique. With it, we have a tiny but effective chance to refuse fate.
Were the dice cast from the beginning? Or is it in our own hands to change the course of destiny? Of all our abilities, it is free will that makes us truly unique. With it, we have a tiny but effective chance to refuse fate. And only with it can we find the way back to our humanity.
It's just an illusion, Jasmine. Your friends are just playing a game with you. The real forest can never come back. Oh, he can. If you take me to him.
What should I have done? Come away, oh human child Through water and wilderness quite swiftly With an elf hand in hand For far greater is the world's misery, Seventeen missing, within the last five months. The rift widens and unloads aliens and psychopaths where it pleases.
These murders are happening because of Torchwood. So Torchwood is obliged to do something. He fell through the rift about 40 years ago. Lay at the bottom of the Bay until we dug him up. I've always known he wasn't just lost. Whoever created him wanted to get rid of him. You know, we never gave him a cool name.
I think it's us, Owen. You and me. A thousand years from now. This is what we'll look like when all we have left is our anger. Not exactly a comforting thought. - Punch him in the face. - Pardon me?
Buddy, come here! Yeah, come here! Yes! Come here! You have a dog too? - He lives here in the forest. Someone abandoned him here because he had enough of him.
Arrest them! Down with them! Quickly! Do you realize now, you Germans, who you think are heroes? New citizens of France, conquer your darkest fears, burn the forest ... and with it... the Brothers Grimm.
Great, man. That's enough. Man, I'm never getting out of this car again. I'm gonna live in here. I'm gonna eat here. I'm gonna make love to it.
That's enough. Man, I'm never getting out of this car again. I'm gonna live in here. I'm gonna eat here. I'm gonna make love to him. You mean you're gonna make love in it.
Present are: myself, Reverend Richard Moore.... Nathaniel, Emily's father... All right, listen. You may pray the rosary or a prayer of your own...if you're not repeating after me. But most of all... ...do as I ask without question. Do not ask it questions... nor pay attention to what it says.
The perpetrator will need horses or cows to carry out the murder. They turn the whole island upside down. People are going crazy. It's never been easy to catch a rabid dog. You of all people should know that. Look at this. We have to find the culprit as soon as possible and prove to the people that he is not a ghost.
Logan should accept any help he can get. - He knows that. He has sought advice. - Not from Cabinet and congressional leaders. Give it time, Don. Give him time.
Tell me where Sam is. Oh, you love your father more than you know, which means you're going to miss him terribly. You know, I'm an expert on pain. He's my bread and butter. I feed off of him.
It probably has something to do with why he had the affair. - Did you ask him? - Once. You should have seen the look in his eyes. He was panicked that I might find out about him.
- You're kidding, right? - No. I happen to know a lot about loss. Can take you to some really dark places. Especially if you don't face it.
17 years in a two-by-three-meter cell. Dark. What am I supposed to do with that? The balloon represents the spirit of lost life. By letting it go, you admit your pain and detach yourself from it at the same time.
You've got a whole suitcase full of rings. But I think that's the only one she liked. - Get another ring. - But my second ring survived the surgery. Suddenly there's talk she might want to be buried with it.
- It may be too much to ask, but could we maybe talk about this at home instead? - All right. - Thank you. Carla, I like your hair. Laverne I bet you'd love to cut the portrait cake and give it a whirl.
- I don't know. - You did it. - Selmak deserves some thanks as well. OK. He deserves most of the credit.
I promise. Shouldn't we level the path in there, too? Oh, no. Not now. I hope nothing happens to him.
Try your cunning on me, not on my cousin. You have your sword, I have my cunning. We play with the gifts the gods give us. In three days, we sail for Troy. Neither will this war ever be forgotten, nor the heroes who fought in it.
Sonny is a whole new generation of robot. A robot not bound by these laws could.... Do anything. This robot is the key to everything that goes on at USR. I need you to help me get in and talk to him again.
I am disappointed. Howl was my last apprentice. He was incredibly talented. I even considered giving him my position soon. I was so pleased with him.
- Who's that? - A guy named Bill Ubell. There's nothing you can do about it, Steve. Third, I need you to make a binding oath that you will not kill the shark, if it even exists. I'll fight him and let him live.
Hey. I picked a fruit. Hey. For deep in the darkest forest, deep inside, there is a special tree. On it grows special fruit.
Good. - You can cut now. - I can't yet. When I say you can, you can. I'll sketch out the cut and you follow it.
According to conventional medicine, I should constrict the blood vessels. I see it differently. Let's break their rules and follow mine. The body needs blood. So let's give it blood.
Eat lots of fruits, get some vitamins in you. Vegetables and greens and shit like that. I can't- there's- I read yesterday there's a fish, it's called a zebrafish. Has little hairs on it.
Why me? And the addict will always need something more to achieve a high or a peak of what they are chemically seeking. Don't tell me to calm down! You're always bossing me around. So my definition says that if you can't gain control of your emotional state.... you must be dependent on it.
It is my mission to deliver the Apple Seed to the Seven Elders. So I took the job to protect you. If that is so, then this pendant must be destroyed. General, don't you think this is strange? The Seven Elders not only want the Apple Seed, they want to use it to blow up the D-Tank.
The champion works Big Willie Jones incessantly and he sends him to the ropes! Boxing is something unnatural because it's all backwards. If you want to go left, you don't go left, you push off your right toe. If you want to go right, you do it with your left toe. Instead of fleeing from the pain like any sensible person, you go towards it.
Hello ... - Hello... Where are you going? To Vika, to look for an injured moose. A fucking idiot put two bullets in his ass.
That is possible. But only if you meet my conditions. - What are they? - I have a jet at Van Nuys airport. I'll fly it to North Africa, and the president will guarantee my safety.
I ordered the death of one of our agents. One of our best. As unimaginable as it is, I had to do it to protect the civilian population. I will not give in to any more of this terrorist's demands. As long as Saunders has the virus, we are at his mercy.
Maybe I was a virgin when it came to sex.... Until then, that is. ...but he was also a virgin. First big death. And you never know what death will drive you to. How hard you try to defy it to achieve the impossible.
Bandar, first of all, you have to die uncomfortably. I can do that. Don't you think that's a little morbid? I can promise you that death will find you. You don't have to send him an invitation.
After that, removal is illegal. - Except in a few states. - Illegal? Don't worry. Many women learn to embrace this parasite. They give it a name and arrange playdates with other parasites.
Does your refrigerator run? Oh, does it? Go ahead. You said "yes." Come on, do it. Then you better run after it.
Murray? Before you say anything, I want you to know that if you need a kidney, you can have mine. See? For $70,000. This moment is so great, I want to sleep with him.
I prefer to watch history shows. - Can I get you anything? - No, thanks. How's the fern doing? Have you tried talking to him?
Damn lawyers. Present company excluded, of course. Is it true that the Massey marriage contract has never been cracked? Not to toot my own horn: They're devoting a semester to it at Harvard.
You call. All agents, we're going to the money drop. Forward. Hey, man, the truck's leaving. We're following it.
Well, death... Death gives us a chance to make up for all the good we have done or not done in life. Yes. It's a world of pain. That's why when someone like Jabez Stone comes along, someone who can see the pain and describe it honestly and simply and give it a form so we can understand it, when someone like that comes along, a visionary,
I want to propose a deal to you. Speak... I'm all ears. Cancel the contract with the king and I'll give you my garden. You can do what you want with it.
in the refrigerator, that's right. That's where it belongs. I bought everything from the wholesaler. The vegetable seller tried to take me for a fool. I asked the price of the carrots, he said 30 rupees a kilo. I said I would give him 20 or leave.
I, for one, don't want to be one of them. Okay, all right, I get it. So you claim you finished listening to the show at home. Then tell us the last song they played in the show. It was announced by the DJ with very special words. You were mentioned by him.
We should consider that an advantage. We don't have to film anything new. We use something old. It doesn't have to look used or recycled. We're going to use it actively. We're going to write a new text, a new context, and hopefully give it a new freshness.
What is he doing? He's playing with a dog! - He has a dog? Why doesn't he bring him to school? I don't know. Maybe it ran to him.
When you work in a band and perform anything, it ... for better or worse - it evolves and changes ... Before the bootlegging days, of course, it was a much better and more effective way of doing things because you'd go into the studio and rehearse away. We had been playing it live that way for quite a while a sort of guitar jam, the sort of one piece. I don't think either of us were quite happy with it as a piece, and then in addition when we had this synthesizer this Synth EA with the little built-in keyboard and it had a sequencer ... I think that was the first sequencer I just plugged it in and started playing a sequence on it, and Roger instantly pricked up his ears and said, "That sounded good!", and he came up and we started copying it with him ... and he put in a new sequence of notes, and it all evolved from that ...
It is time to vote. Mr. Vice President, please give me one more minute. Mr. President. This farmer is just a mirage. When you get close to him, he moves away.
Hand it over. Stop it, both of you. I can't stress this enough. The threat is real. Salazar will release the virus if we don't get to it first.
This part is good. Okay. I got an impression. It's not the genre I'm interested in. But you don't even give it a chance.
I almost died! How melodramatic. Born for the stage, young Hawkins. This storm, is what they call a Black Blizzard, isn't it? That's the name they gave it.
It's just a feeling. Travis' adrenaline supply was abnormal. Maybe the parasite was feeding on the adrenaline, making him want more. Don't you think they would have found the parasite in the autopsy? Not if the thing detached from him after he died.
I am not a tree! I am an Ent. A shepherd of the tree. A shepherd of the forest. Don't talk to him, Merry!
- Don't make me. - On his ass? Don't! Oh, that's disgusting! A single drop of her blood... contains all the genetic information we need. We put the drop of blood into the replicator, where it is immediately... a special hormone growth solution I've developed.
- Oh, what! Hello. Grandma? ! Velma, Velma. Simple behavior modification. When you want a dog to stop an action, you flick it on the nose.
I was quite confused. I don't remember how I had been undressed. I was completely naked. We were standing near the edge of the pit. When we got closer to it and heard the shots, we understood everything.
There is evil and there is that which created evil. The source. - And this is supposed to be the First? - That is him. He owns eternity and endless resources.
Welcome home. This is not my home anymore. And what about this demon? Where is he? I want to thank him and then kill him.
- Doctor? - Look at its synaptic activity. This organism has a sophisticated nervous system. It may well have higher mental functions. Then we could communicate with it.
What kind of tests? I need to determine how much bioelectric stress it can tolerate. May I ask why? I want to use a force field to isolate the cargo hold. But for that to work, I need to know how much juice I can give it without killing the organism or one of the men.
Growing up, he got used to carrying a ball with him at all times, no matter when. At school, on a date; didn't matter. He even wanted to go to bed with a basketball, as in marriage. So I started doing that. I stopped sleeping with him when I went to college, but everything else....
We must leave the mountain! On to the Gate of Rohan, across the West Fold to my city. The Gate of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard! We can't go over the mountain. Let's go under it.
Asshole! -Whatever you say. (So please... I love this song. (Swing music, J makes snoring noises) Give it a chance!
But remember one thing, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge nor truth. Some who stood in front of it completely forgot themselves, even went mad. That's why it's going to a new place tomorrow. And I must insist that you do not look for it.
Guests must go to the amphitheater. You can't stay here. Do you know where I can find Michele Flaherty? Guests bring food. That attracts animals. And one time... there was a bear that came, and that bear then had to be killed. So they shot it in the head and it died.
"and are more likely to become teachers than men..." Teachers today are almost exclusively women. "We have more opportunities here, so we have to defend the state." "We are more likely to work for the state" and benefit from it..."
And 10 years later, the films are all classics. By now it was clear to me: Kubrick is the greatest. Outstanding directors made film after film. But after Lolita and Dr. Strangelove, we knew: We just had to wait for a Kubrick film. Honestly, we expected the most from him.
- Yes, you can. Bring it up slowly and steadily. Crap. You can't be afraid of the wind. Learn to trust it.
The theatrics of Angel leaving the others hanging was all just for show. Well done. I didn't know he was so talented. You're kidding. That was awful. It was flat. - You bought it.
Remove the mangy skull of the traitor. No, no! I like the skull. Uh, that is...I want to desecrate it some more. I want to spit on it, and when I've had enough... I'll make a vase out of it.
Go on, drive. Don't be afraid. Willow and Tara are doing a spell. - Won't that kill Buffy again? She can't fight a foggy demon. That's why they're giving it shape, so Buffy can kick it good.
Pretty, shiny key. The key? You saw it? Pretty... ...little shiny girl. The monks gave him human form!
- The key is almost as old as the beast. Where it comes from, how it was created... is a great mystery. All we know is that its power is absolute. Countless generations of my people sacrificed their lives in search of it, to destroy it before its wrath erupted.
The searchers waited for him at the courthouse. And then they tracked Cole to the mausoleum. How do you know they didn't track you here? They disappeared. They must be close to the shimmer to follow him.
- Another life. - Life sucks. He left a stain. But with a little water... Death is not temporary, it's permanent, and the guy can escape it not once, but nine times.
- What about the transporter? - Too deep down. Part of this tunnel has collapsed. It's unused. If we get the obstacle out of the way with the phasers, we'll be less than 20 meters from it.
Couldn't-egal. -Good scene, man. -You too. What? You weren't in it.
and you never told me you were in an "I Hate Rachel Club"? You went with her? We had a pact. -It's not like it was binding forever. -It was... -It had the word "forever" in it.
You tell me nothing I could do anything with. I made that great dress for you. I wore it to the ball I went to with him. And the sweater is new. - He saw me in it and he liked it.
I know it sounds crazy, but I felt him. - Did the cat feel him, too? - The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. My grandmother had a ghost. She had to tell him to leave.
I am to walk behind the coffin with my sister and her husband. God forbid that I go alone! That would be the real tragedy. The coffin doesn't matter. A single 35-year-old woman walks behind it!
Sorry, Neelix. - Load weapons. - What's going on? A ship's been drawn into a vortex. Two warships are approaching.
Well, General, our alien has obviously built a nest. - Overnight? - According to the log,... ..there's been no human activity in MALP space for 36 hours. To make a long story short, I want to blow it up. You want to talk to it.
It wants to survive. We offer to send it home. This alien technology can return to us... ..through an outgoing wormhole. We can't risk that again. I've ordered the coordinates locked out of the dialling computer. Let me talk to him.
(daniel) every now and then. He's obviously hallucinating. - How's Junior? - The symbiote is still fine. I don't know what we're gonna do with him if Teal'c dies.
We're running out of time, Mr. McCloy. We need to close this deal. Yes. Begin the transfer. Follow him... and report to me.
Just swing the bat. Now close your eyes. - I'm supposed to... - You can't force the ball. You can help it.
-Honey, I got it already. Hello? Do you think my Kühlomat is running? -I think so. -Then you better run after it!
We have connected the two transmitters and calibrated the aiming mechanism. All we need now is a pen. - When is the accelerator coming? - She's sending it tomorrow. She has no idea what we're going to do with him.
Just the thought of it excites me. You're making a noise there. That's my penis. He's humming. He's probably at a loss for words.
There's nothing controversial about you at all. They'll buy you drinks... you'll meet girls, and they'll offer you drugs. Sounds great, but they're not real friends. But they just want you to write great stories about rock stars. In the process, they ruin rock and everything we love about it.
It was a good show. I miss him already. Times are bad for rock 'n' roll. The war is lost. They're ruining rock 'n' roll... and everything we love about it.
I'll fix it. You can count on me to fix it. That fucking gypsy set me up. Thanks for the tip, Brick Top. I don't care if the dog likes the bone... I'm throwing him.
Yes, I did. When I was little, I found a bird. It was injured. A broken leg or something. My father found out about it. I knew he was going to do something terrible to it.
Bobo! Notice anything different about the monkey? - What do you think? I don't know. There's something creepy about him.
I've never seen you this angry before. There's something else. It sounds stupid, but I feel he's kind of mischievous. He's just a monkey. I don't want Jennifer playing with him.
Uh, no, no at the moment. She's busy. Uh, she's holding a bird. A bird! Uh, she found him, on the street, yeah. Because, uh, he's missing something.
These were not bad thoughts at all, and they were not sinful. And I had to let my imagination, no matter how bloody or degenerate, go where it wanted. I killed those women. I am a criminal. Thoughts do not commit crimes, my friend. For me... in terms of movies, and in general, this is the movie I have the best memories of. I'm very attached to it.
He wrote me a letter, a wonderful letter, saying that his last years were fast and terrible. And all that was left for him was to wait for death. He said it very clearly. Just before death, he wanted to talk to Father Julián the most. He lived in a cell of the Franciscans with a cot for a bed. He was not afraid of death. He was obsessed with it, but he was not afraid.
Around the castle we imagined a huge rose garden. And somewhere buried in it was a magic ring.... The one who finds it should grow up immediately. And this ring, it was made of tin. At some point, Anna, looking for it, stuck her hand... into a bush and pricked herself.
I'm sure you've had one too. And you? You've had a dick too. Shall I tell you about mine? There was a time when my dick was a part of me. I looked at it, talked to it.
is the end of pregnancies. And with that, we can even save the women. - There is one small problem. - What's that? He seems to be almost invulnerable... Fire can't hurt him, and neither can decapitation... and he's huge.
Would you be so kind as to tell me what this is all about? Two men have been flattened... ...by that dumpster. - How did that happen? - I don't know. It's like... It's like someone gave him a shove.
He, the glass is soundproof. The glass is soundproof. The thicker glass... You know what you are? A beard with an idiot attached to it.
Pain, death,... ..apocalypse. Not very pleasant. You know the Hellmouth? Do you have a name for it? I lived right above it for three years in high school.
- What? I think the spell is working. Do you see him? What's he doing? I think he wants us to follow him.
Katie has shown me things that are beyond our comprehension. They have unspeakable devices, but they have not used them against us. Quite the opposite. Milo, you said you didn't like the rain. Harry Kim put an end to it.
- Kal'ma? - It means "child. The devil in you is not a child. Am I not carrying him inside me as my own? Have I not taught him what is right and what is wrong?
And I have to stay. I'll die someday, too. I don't give myself any hope of being immortal. I will long for death before it crosses my path. If I'm honest, I'm already longing for him.
Come to bed. (Schatzi, Bear will be right there. Everything is alright. Here's the problem. - My buddy pinched off his thumb. Should I screw it back on or what?
I can't go to your house with your mother despising me like this. So this is what we're going to do... Done. This doesn't taste like iced tea. - This is a Long Island... How's the letter? - It's excellent. Do you think he'll like it?
The boy is good. At least as good as any. You know why he got kicked out of New York? I heard things. He blew the whistle on the mayor of New York. He found proof of a corruption deal between him and a contractor and wrote about it.
You should choose him with the greatest care. You doubt my knowledge of human nature? Hey, Gon! I like this man. What do you think of him?
Come to papa! It's heavy! The monster breaks the landing net. - And now what? - Back into the water with him!
All flesh eats this beast. But why is the dragon in the king's castle? It is said that there is an agreement between the king and the monster. The dragon protects the king always and everywhere. In return, he is served in the castle as if he were a king himself.
- Someone could take him there. Not in the yard! Go through the garden gate and put the basket in front of the door, on the landing. Now go! If you meet a dog, just sit down or you'll crush the tomatoes. Don't hit the legs with the basket! And if a dog comes, sit down immediately and give him the tomatoes, then he won't bite.
- My opinion doesn't count? - No. Veruca was right. The wolf is always in me. And I no longer know where the line is between me and him.
Hang up the lights, fire up the tree, we celebrate our Christmas dream. Merrily tuned we are ready for the hell Christmas. Even the demons look like angels, they always for sale as toys, it snows from the sky, which makes us very happy for Hell Christmas time. There goes Jeffrey Dahmer home with the Christmas ham. If he has had sex with him, then he is alone.
He is not a demon. My friends are telling the truth, Simon. This demon is nothing but a parasite living in another creature. Your fear gives him power over you. - You are not afraid of him?
Because you know that next time I would wring your neck. Or you could just touch the ring pin... ..and we'd get hit again. Ah, the ring. It's been passed down through the generations... ..from one village canon to the next, until I got it. And with it, you hold the power.
Or you could just touch the ring pin.... ..and we'll be struck again. Ah, the ring. It's been passed down through the generations... ..from one village canon to the next, until I got it. And with it, you hold the power. With it, I do the will of God...
My God... is always with me. (canon screams) He's OK. What happened? Simon... stood in front of him like...
Your companion, Amaunet, is dead. Sorry to spoil your day. Actually, I'm not sorry at all. Sokar told me about Amaunet's death. I didn't believe him.
Not a cheap pleasure. I pay the ball boy ten dollars an hour. It's good in the hand, huh? I mean the bat. Touch it as if you were shaking hands with it.
Ugly concubines. Now it's time for Mongolian fried chicken. I've had enough of your arrogance, old man. Bow to me. No matter how much the wind rages, no mountain bows to it.
Yeah, not the worst idea, Captain. It all comes down to getting the tank on the main road, doesn't it? How are you going to do that? As our esteemed colleague from the Airborne noted, all we have here are paper pellets, how do we stop the tank if he goes along? Give him a rabbit to chase.
There are two groups of men: one washes his hands before pissing - and the other washes them afterwards! - Aha. I am a before-washer.. And that out of conviction! Because my cock is something very sacred! And therefore I must pay homage to him!
I don't know. Don't think about it. Do you like the fabric? Is it nice and light? It looks good on him.
Becker, you should have played a pass to Ramzey. When I'm in a crucial situation, I ask myself: What would Pharaoh do now? I don't think he would have made a pass. Listen, you dumbass... He's right. I wouldn't have given him the ball either.
The werewolf is in there. Let me through! - You let him get away. - I already had him chained. - Were you going to take him for a walk?
Think about it. It is a cab that people take when they want to relax. It's a relaxi cab! The name was my favorite part! -I came with him.
The bath will be cold. I will see you later. There are some children playing in the street. Want to go give them a project, ruin their day? If they have a ball, you could stick razors in it and teach them a new game:
Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Look at these skins! She didn't get too attached. She's burned with it.
Now Sister Peter Marie said that you stopped coming to drug counseling recently. I'm going to throw that under the bus, too. You know why? Because you give this place a good name. You did everything you could to give it a bad name, but from now on, you don't get a second chance.
What? Assholes. Scumbags. Hannah Bantry in the pantry, gnawing on a mutton bone How could she gnaw on it, how could she claw at it while she found herself.
I don't know if you believe that yourself or if you are pretending or if you are just crazy. I have been touched by the hand of a god. I am a different person. I admit that when I first became a tool for the Pah-wraith, it was for purely selfish reasons. I wanted to help him into the wormhole so that he would expel the prophets.
Why? The faith, Nerys, the faith. I am sorry about Vedek Fala. I keep thinking about his last words. Did he mean he never lost faith or he was betrayed by it?
- Outer corner? ! We still have two men! Gentlemen, you are trying my patience. You stole the run from us as if you had grabbed it and torn it off the board!
Are you asking me for my opinion? Probably. Because to be honest, I'm starting to run out of ideas. Putting you in the bullpen or reprimanding you is not the answer. And I can understand your feelings about Kovin. There are moments when I want to punch him in the nose. But having an impulse and acting on it are two different things.
Oh. many, many years. Then why are you lying to your people? Don't give them the opportunity to see this? Because it was our kind that hurt the planet. If I let them out, they will only hurt it again.
- What are you doing here? - We need to talk. Something's happened. (Joanne) Don't forget your stupid chair! I hope you'll be happy with it!
Doesn't it mean that he completely wiped out the city all by himself? After July, now Augusta, too. What is he thinking, this obsessed man? The bounty on his head will be increased one more time because of this incident! I'm seriously starting to think that it's all this guy's fault that we have to live on this planet. Beyond all the garbage you hear about him.
Also some of us hunters. Everyone was afraid, including me. I had gone to sleep with my family. Suddenly he appeared. He came towards me. I took a big stone and threw it at him.
But, God, I couldn't take another day without getting rid of it. Regardless of the outcome. From the look on your face, this is the inevitable fallout. And I'm going to accept it. But I know there's a part of you that hesitates for a moment. And if there's a moment of hesitation, it means you feel something too. And I'm just asking you not to just dismiss it, but to just pursue it for ten seconds.
You're still alive! That's nice. I'll bring back the head. Put him down and run! You want to give him back the head?
Just knowing that he is there.... I see what you mean. Now close your eyes. Just think about that first sip. Smell him.
The scanner read the book. It picked up Moloch... ..in the form of data. He's gone digital. OK, let me get this straight... ..you're saying Moloch is in the computer? And in every computer connected to it.
What is the word for an adult who does not have dinosaur toys in the bedroom? What was that? Monica knows. It's this stupid thing that Ross made to try to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger without actually getting to it.
- Question... When one man gets another a '53 Studebaker Commander.... - I love this car. - Yes, very good design. And the same man offers to refurbish it for him....
How did you find out so quickly? Covert investigation. Where is she? What did you do with Pandora's box? It's in a safe place.
I'm just asking. You don't have to get aggressive. - You're Sheriff Sikes? - Zeke. - How's the shoulder, Zeke? - It hurts.
Okay, put it in the bag. Grab his gun. Get his... Get his gun! Okay, now disarm it!
- Oh, thanks. It's pretty stupid. Come on. Yes, it is. My mom thinks she can suggest my sexual prowess.
We're blocking the flow. Guys, wouldn't it be easier to go through the side? See? That's the problem with education. It gets in the way.
- Tyr, no. You get the same honor that my father gave me. The frequency through which the mana stone releases controlled energy. This is madness, there must be another way. Even if they know it, they still have to get raw materials and build a refining plant.
Your search for the blue was lang' almost sport. But this cap comes from a whole new place. Yes. From where? Where does it come from?
Now! Stop it, Azrael. I can't calibrate the machine if you whine around like that. Yes, Azrael, listen. She purrs like a kitten.
I'd like to say, "I'm here to fight for freedom." But honestly, I joined the Reserve for the college money. This is not where I belong. And I'm ashamed of that. A war story can't be true until it's connected with shame.
We get the Iraqis' money, right? So it's not free. Is it, Sergeant Harper? Not a lump in the earth, see? Without water, it lacks cohesion and is barren.
He's okay. Stop it. That's not how this works. It's not gonna happen. It's been a rough night, but it's been worth it.
I will go. Leave me alone with him for a moment. Are you so heartless as to deny us a farewell? A moment for eternity. When this door closes, it will not open again.
Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle. I am here to escort you to your room. My room? - I thought... - Oh, about "if this door closes, it will not open again"?
I am a cynic. I am a cynic. You are a cynic. There is a difference. I didn't believe in it from the beginning, but you, you wake up every morning, disappointed when you see the world, because you are a dreamer.
Give me the card. You did it. God. You did it. Give it to them.
Where's the map? Do you have it, fancy pants? Where is the map? Where is the map? There it is!
Do you have it, fancy pants? Where's the map? Where's the map? There it is! Shit, it's not there.
Where is the map? There it is! Shit, it's not there. Come on! It's burned!
That's where we found O'Neill after his escape. oddly enough, when I moved, he didn't re-aim his gun at me. In fact, he wasn't aiming at me, he was aiming at the wall behind me. In it was the water filtration system. Whatever this substance is, it reacts incredibly strongly with water.
Have him come to us. We had problems with the X-23s. We thought we could raise the kids to be unconscionable. But anger can't be taught. It has to be implanted. From the beginning.
Three days. Give me the money in three days and you'll get the goods. 72 hours. Otherwise you're out! Keep it.
You were knocked out in one fell swoop. Let's go. Musa is waiting. There is an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other. Anger is a sign of the devil, so it is haram.
- The code for the coordinates. We know the flight path of the drone. The other three drones probably have similar modules. Flight paths, but no longitude or latitude to narrow down targets. And without those, we can't figure out where to launch from.
You have five minutes. I have an appointment. So, what imaginary monster are you hunting this time? This is a satellite image of an unexplored island in the South Pacific. It's defied all exploration, until now.
No logic, only destruction. I have tried for 30 years to prove that what I realized then was true. This planet does not belong to us. Prehistoric species owned this world long before humans did. And if we continue to bury our heads in the sand, they will take it back.
This island is just the beginning. There is more out there. What do you mean by "more"? This world never belonged to us. It belonged to them.
-Somebody. Don't think anyone else will save him. - Anybody. - Somebody. Anybody. But there's a situation that has to be dealt with. It can only be solved in one way.
For people like you, there is a place. For the desperate and fearful who have no place of refuge. - Where is this place? - 221B Baker Street. See you tomorrow. If there's a line, get in line.
- What? - What do you think? - Beautiful. - You're not even looking at her. - I meant your playing. Oh, the music, I never know if it's beautiful, just right.
Look at the violin. - I need to know how you got out. - Look at the violin. - It's a Stradivarius. - It's a gift.
I'll go out and try there. You know what? This has nothing to do with Cheers anymore! This is like a show where one person is willing to open up to new things and the other person is an idiot who doesn't trust anyone! There's no such series. That's why it would have zero ratings!
But also light. Is that normal? I think it's called "euphoria." Sorry about the quarantine. It's to protect you, not us.
I swear I couldn't have done anything differently. But that's not the point. I dealt with the problem. But I had no idea what the solution would do to me. It killed me.
But that's not the point. I was dealing with the problem. But I had no idea what the solution would do to me. It was killing me. It's still killing me.
This is so... so unreal. Not how I... imagined. It gives me a headache. I'm sorry, but the world doesn't always give you exactly what you want. It gave me you.
Everything you think you know about Okja is a lie. Okja was created in this laboratory. So was her so-called mother. This is where Mirando experiments on her genetically engineered animals. Because genetic manipulation is dangerous, Mirando pretends that they grew up without genetic manipulation.
One of the organs is a liver. Which fits Terence perfectly. Exactly. His liver never makes it onto the national list. It goes directly to your nephew.
I know it was you. You always had a soft spot for him. - You dressed up well. - That tie looks a little unmanly. I like it.
It is not. Doubt leads to death. Tell me the legend again. Why are you so interested in it? Because it gives me courage.
I can't. Yes, you can. Just give in. You want this life, and I can give it to you. You were looking for freedom, and here it is.
- Well... Apologies put you in the position, so it's an official statement. This is the first step in the CIR plan to save the company's image. But what about the factory? Why? It may be making people sick.
You were important. You know... I've been thinking. I felt your presence for a long time. It comforted me.
I remember very clearly how he asked me about poison. He seemed excited by the idea. You only gain the strength of a true Iron Fist when you kill Harold. You must get rid of that anger. There are two doors in front of you. Go through one, and it will lead you to your destiny as a true Iron Fist.
- that I give up forever. All right. - Let's see the card. - You guys are the best. Well, it's a map, but it doesn't show any roads.
I report on it all the time, the crime rate is down. I think Daredevil has made the city safer. Maybe. But the city is better off without him. It's better off with Matt Murdock.
But... You just ask yourself. The woman who lived in this shell... was already lost before she came to us. She was misguided by men who were afraid of her, of what she was capable of. But fate is a funny thing. Because this shell ended up exactly where it belongs.
A closed door used to mean something. Excuse me. In all the time we've known each other, I've never seen you like this. Your position gives you great power. But it is both a burden and a blessing.
I didn't want to stay in K'un-Lun then. I just didn't want to leave with you. I'm not surprised. Your own strength has always been your only goal. It has brought me this far.
- Of course. Get Maggie. Tell her he's awake. Memories... never hurt me. But the past... is more than memories. It's the devil you sell your soul to.
I thought they were all the same. It was like this when we moved in. The administration wanted to redecorate it, - but we liked it like this. - That's right, we live here and it stays like that.
- What. A homemade sauce. - That was totally hot. - Sorry, I should have warned you. But it's delicious, right?
- That was totally hot. - Sorry, I should have warned you. But it's delicious, right? I've been really good at making sauces lately. Yeah, it's delicious.
I'll let her know. - Okay. - And did I leave a jacket here? - I didn't see one. What does it look like?
- I haven't seen one. What does it look like? It's kind of like a college jacket. - Cool. - She's probably in Mickey's room.
Thanks. Hang 'em, Walt. The wild Mustang is an American icon that shouldn't be tamed. As a billionaire widow, Meredith Parish is used to traveling in private jets or limousines before anything else, but she's not afraid to get her hands dirty. Aren't they picture perfect? Meredith owns a huge ranch in Texas and New Mexico, which she has turned into a horse sanctuary.
That's all that counts for me. It's complicated, but I've never been happier. Mia, what's up? Did you hear about José's exhibition? It was incredible.
Could you get them, please? Please, come in! - I don't see anything here! - On the refrigerator. - It's not! - Yes, it is, on the fridge.
That's right. Get on board. Get underway! A brig named Good Hope is ready for the voyage to Constantinople and leaves tomorrow. - Has she been loaded yet?
Get underway! A brig named Good Hope is ready for the voyage to Constantinople and leaves tomorrow. - Has she been loaded yet? Instructs in writing her detour. She is to sail to Wapping Wall with minimal crew and be loaded only with food... enough for a crew of 15 for a two-month voyage.
That I am an old man and would not survive. Tell me that is the reason. Brace, you were not born to freedom. You couldn't handle it. It would torture you.
Hello? Excuse me, the door was open. I received a message. Mr. Delaney says his report on the sinking of the Cornwallis and that of the company clerk, Godfrey, are here. They're supposed to be in his room.
Where is James? How should I know? Brace... What's the matter? I thought he burned that chest along with everything else on the shore. It floats.
Cholera. Cholera? Where is the cholera right now? Hendon Road. It's coming across the Fleet and Kilburn rivers.
He betrayed you because you cut off his thumb, or.... You cut him off because you suspected. Possibility one: Possibility two: Witchcraft. Place the body so that it will be found.
- Beautiful photo. Did not send his people where he would not go himself. He was known by several names: Lion King, G-Man, Big Glen. And his most famous name was: He came from another era. His hand was shaped like a permanent claw, as if it were clutching a World War II cigar that the fitness fanatic in him didn't begrudge him.
This is a lost cause. The province is home to only 4 % of the country's population. It is strategically meaningless. I would give up Helmand, sir. The thing about counterinsurgency is that it doesn't work.
Religion. You see? We can't write about anything that actually affects us. Last week, you rejected my story about prevention lectures at school. Because it was a direct criticism of the school administration.
Then I'll be happy happy happy Yes, happy happy... Did you sweep the stage well? I'll dance barefoot. It's clean.
Good response. I told you, I have connections. Security loves me, just FYI. We are proud to be led in the Pledge of Allegiance today by the Salem County Crimson Tides. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice....
Do we really do that? Trust him? Do you have a better idea? I have an idea. It may not be better, but at least it's not that one.
Are you a widow? - Hey! - One second. - Turn the music down! - Turn it down, you hear?
Everything that is known about the video is in here. It will help you more than I can. A person never quite does justice to their work. The images on the video were her story. She wanted it to be heard.
You are very young to be here. Don't let this kill you. Excuse me, sir! Can you tell me a little about the church? When was it closed?
Rose? What's your job, Chris? What? In life. What is your job? Right now, it's to find the keys. Yes?
I ask you. What do you know about a slaughtered lynch mob? I have no idea what you're talking about. I was just passing the time, as my instincts dictated, while you paid your respects to the deceased. How was the funeral? - It's over.
Do you believe in the soul? If not, close your eyes. Good. If the soul existed, where in the body would you place it? If we had a soul, it would be in the brain.
-Yes, wonderful. -Why are you talking to me like that? -I've been wonderful. Then why are you telling your friends about the machine? Why do you claim it failed?
You look tired. I'm studying for the exam. - How's it going? It's going like this. In Connecticut, a cucumber is only recognized as a pickle if it's pliable.
I'm happy with what I'm doing, but at some point I'd like to produce and direct films and basically push the boundaries of what's technologically feasible right now. I'm working a little bit with 360 video right now, a software just testing things out a little bit. I think, hopefully, that has good prospects. But there's something about the porn world. It's always evolving, the new technologies are always there, and some come and some go.
I have heard so many stories about myself that I don't know which one is the most popular. But I do know which one is not popular. The truth. The truth is not always the most exciting version, or the best, or the worst. It lies somewhere in between.
But I know which one is not popular. The truth. The truth is not always the most exciting option, or the best, or the worst. It lies somewhere in between. But it should be heard and not forgotten.
Ultravox? Duran Duran? Yes, good music. I'm more of a jazz fan, but music is always good. It makes life easier.
If something is unique, the other six things should be different. Why? If something is unique, it is different. I want to say that this kind of literature is different from other kinds. It is.
You should get on the mic and say things like, "Liberty High, let's get hot!" I'm a serious DJ, not a birthday clown. It's not just either or. You see the world in binary, but it's a mosaic.
Jensen, that's enough. Now we have freshly painted toilets and a memorial because no one wants to see the truth. Everyone is so nice until they drive you to suicide. But the truth will come out. It will come out.
I know. But with the trial coming up, it's not advisable right now. It's unfair. I created the paper from nothing. It's at the center of my college application.
No, she hadn't. Does your legal question earlier have to do with Hannah? No. Not really. Even if a crime cannot be prosecuted, it should not be concealed.
I couldn't. I felt guilty. And I was angry. Very angry. Angry at the whole damn world and how it works.
And it's about you Clay. How am I supposed to be able to listen to that? The asshole answer is, "Put your headphones on, put the tape in, and press play." That's a real asshole answer. Yes. But it's right.
Yes, you are right. It's worth a shot. Crap. I have to make the deposit. It's due today.
You know that. When this one starts, I'll siphon off some gas. - I just need to get a... - That's an empty water bottle. I thought it was this one, but.... Do you like it?
For this. Rosita. Take your position. I'll give you a signal. And the wall will hold? It'll hold.
On behalf of the people of the great state of California, the President of the United States. This valley and others throughout the country.... FIRST SPATCH - SAN LUIS DAM 18 AUGUST 1962 ...where there is the most fertile soil, producing the largest and most productive crop in the country. And then, a few miles away, there is the same soil. But it is brown, dusty and unusable, just because there is water in one place but not in the other.
- If you can call it that, which I do. Okay, you should report on this. - That the drought is driving people crazy? - The drought is terrible. Never thought it would last this long, but it's just part of the problem.
You've got your slippers on. Good hint. Have you noticed that the morgue in hospitals is never upstairs? I notice things like that. It's always in the basement and has its own elevator.
a loser. Then what else could she be? Right then, the grandfather appeared. He was angry because Peter had gone to the meadow. It is a dangerous place.
You can't give me something that was mine to begin with. Okay. No, that's... Take it. - It's yours. - I said take it.
How was it with the story, Ghost of Christmas Past? I... You came back for a reason. The gun. It's on the counter.
I, uh... You came back for a reason. The gun. It's on the counter. Take it, your gun.
Anyway, your name is on it. Look, today's my last day, so.... Are you working on a case involving Emmit Stussy or Stussy Lots Ltd? How did you get this number? Like I said, it was on your piece of paper.
This is quite normal. You see it all the time in the animal kingdom. The smaller animal going limp in the mouth of the bigger one. It's genetically programmed. Somewhere deep inside, food knows that it is food.
You talk about it like apples and oranges. But it is not apples and oranges. It is reality and imagination. Oh, that's how the world works! It is either real or imagination?
Just the Murphy girls. Did you give Pernell my cell number? No. - He left a message. She's cute.
- He spoke to me. And he told me where your capsule is. What did the trainer say? Just a moment. Where is it?
And he told me where your capsule is. What did the trainer say? Just a moment. Where is it? Tell me where it is. - What?
I want my capsule. Leave or I'll have to arrest you. I want my capsule first. He'll catch a bullet. - I know it's here.
Are you ready to move on? We're back, in person, with Judge Pernell Harris and his beautiful wife. And I have to say thank you, Crystal, for the insight into this garden. You're always welcome. Judge Harris, your story is no secret in San Vicente and.... it's quite tragic.
This was a going away present. Stolen the night Jocelyn was raped. Crys. Anne's apartment is empty. It's completely cleaned out.
We will only defeat these enemies if we keep ourselves clean, both physically and morally. - Go on, hand them out. - Yes, Captain! Use the soap often. But remember, it must last a long time.
- Yes. What else can you do besides kill? I studied law and wanted to become a lawyer. I recognize your good background. The plane is wider than it seems.
If they fled, they would have to pay the court $18,000. - Excuse me. Where did you get that watch? - Uh, I don't remember. It was daddy's.
I have often thought of the summers I spent here. You know how it was. That green. That shade of green ... It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. And the tire swing. It broke down every summer, and Grandpa fixed it every time.
- Not even far away. Even if it is, since when do we start arresting people for crimes they might do. Sometime between 9/11 and Orlando. Is that when we started fabricating evidence and obstructing justice? I don't know where they got that recording, but it's not going to stop anything.
Sorry. No, no, it's okay. Let's finish up the business before we order. - Shoot. - This Iran thing, it could paralyze me right at the beginning.
Really? You screwed everything up by coming here. Fuck you guys. I got your drawing. It's so beautiful.
So I ask you, one last thing. Find out about Nafisi. Bring me the real answer. Because the truth matters. I'll make it count.
- I can't say that. - Yes, you can. Pretty much had to have come from the NSA. Unless the CIA has a surveillance program I don't know about. - Answer me!
Holy shit. Holy shit. Of course, I had no idea what was happening. I mean the explosion, I still don't believe it. But because Sekou was released because of the recording, it's important evidence in the investigation.
But because Sekou was released because of the recording, it is important evidence in the investigation. I just told the FBI-I wouldn't say where I got it, and I won't, but.... - Not from me. Yeah, but... the problem is they know it has to be from NSA.
- I had a gun, but was not asleep. - Your daughter said something different. Was the gun loaded, Ms. Mathison? Answer the question. Yes, it was.
- Are you accusing these men of lying? - Yes, I am. Either they're confused or they've been put up to it. What about the recording? Is it a lie?
- Yes, I do. Either you're confused or you've been put up to it. What about the recording? Is it a lie? - Why does it end here, with the image of my son running away?
- Do you know why I made the video? - To destroy the memory of my son. - To hurt me and to hurt my presidency. - No, no, and no. I made the video because some people, people you call cowards, even though all of them are veterans, came to me with a story of injustice. Nobody believed them, because it concerns an influential person, with an even more influential mother.
Understand. - His exercises could be based on his favorite movie. Understand. This exercise shows us how far Stephen has come in his recovery. It requires memory skills, motor skills, mastery of sequences.
Junior employee work that I never would have done at your age when I was running a company and not a stupid department. Because I put in the work. That's why I was good. What about you? You don't seem to be doing that. When the travel team list comes in on Monday, you don't have to look at it, Lakeman.
Siegfried, let him. He is only a priest. Come, brother, we want to kill Scots. Erik! We leave the city to you. - It is ours and must remain so.
Violet was the oldest Baudelaire child. She was 14 years old, right-handed, with a talent for inventing and building unusual devices. I'm having trouble with the grandfather clock. Will you show me what exactly is not working? It toasts the bread, but then goes five minutes slow.
"When you invite people to dinner, you are responsible for their welfare as long as they are under our roof." But he was an 18th century philosopher and gourmet, and these three children had little experience in cooking. Nonetheless, the Baudelaire orphans set to work. The pasta machine reminds me of Thomas Jefferson's. Does it work?
- No. The combination of numbers consists of the girls' birthdays. I would never forget them. - Maybe the order was wrong. I didn't forget them! Maybe it was reset by mistake.
That guy's shooting at us! Shit! Just one shot that didn't even come close to us, but still. Anyway, he takes one look at Lonnie and almost shits himself. He throws the gun away like it's on fire.
- No! - Grandma! What's wrong? What's wrong? I can't get the door open, it's closed.
"No self, only country matters." Is this a career crisis that we're kind of trying to wash down here? I enrolled when I was 19 years old. Just like all the other hotheads. I always thought I was going out to kick some ass, anchor justice where it was needed, you know?
The capsule will fly past us. Just about. Rom'? - I'm still on trajectory. It's coming in flat.
More carbon dioxide. And when Sho is ready, a growth medium. In this case, glucose. Come on, dance for me. Did she just move?
And make an emergency call. Control Center, this is Space Station. Space Station to Control Center. The location of the species is unknown. It is classified as hostile and deadly.
Rainbow Bridge? Where the pets go when they die? No. I mean, not that I know of. No, it's called that because of the flowers that are everywhere there.
- Bye, how are you? - Fine, and you? - I'm fine. Can I taste the lasagna? No, I ate it all. - Was it tasty?
-I'm sending you our coordinates. Fuck, what's going on? At Alterplex, we understand how precious our Earth is. The future of man is not out there. It is here, and we have found a solution.
You will have this box with you. The box compensates for any instabilities that may occur in the echo. Instabilities? Really simple. It is installed directly in the echo tower.
Everything okay? Shit. This way! It's a drone. It spotted us! Fuck!
Leader Hugo Romein said his movement is watching closely. SUCCESSFUL START OVERSHadowED BY PROTESTS He expressed concern about the activation of the tower. He said his group would act as soon as the first problems arose. He did not say in what form. Will, can you hear me? Stay with me. Stay with me!
Now tell me what the Redivider is. A secret protocol. A last resort. When rebalancing is impossible, the box disables one side. It destroys the tower.
Will! Traitor. We got Porter. What about the box? Is it safe?
There is nothing futile about having lived. Think of the life these people had, the love they felt. How can it be in vain when it is so wonderful? In the end, we are all just human beings, drunk with the idea that love can fix everything. Because it can.
A piece of the vortex seems to be fused there, but what doesn't make sense is.... That the piece is connected at an almost 90° angle. Oh, I know what happened. The lower half of the body is not missing. It's still attached to a living person.
- I know how we find Kovac. Forget the evidence! I need to get you to safety. The door! It's closing!
- I meant the motorcycle bar, but yes. Also in the Moluccas. I remember the day each of you was hired. I remember the name of every victim I ever identified. I remember...how significant this work can be, but I.... I don't remember how... to do it.
- Let me know if you need anything. - I will. Why are you holding a plant? It's for the new office. Do you like it?
I love The Weapons of Women so fucking much. Yes. Han Solo looks really good in suits. Even after all these years, people are still the same. Everyone talks about evolution, but no one talks about how long it takes.
It appears to be a postmortem tubercle fracture. Let me take a look. You are right. But tubercle fractures are not caused by objects shattering the bone. They're caused by the force of a landing. Maybe the body was thrown into the trunk of a car as it was being transported.
This is not a nest. Oh, man. Give me that. Okay, Ian's body was dumped in an oak grove right here. So how can it contain sycamore sap when the only sycamores are almost a mile away?
Oh, what a shock. We have an attorney here representing Goodlife Chemicals. All these precautions, the chemical protective suits, the decontamination foam, portray these chemicals as dangerous. Nonsense. Sulfuric acid is not only dangerous, it is highly corrosive. It would eat through your flesh in seconds.
I don't think it's the time of day. Dr. Hodgins, if you're done making immature puns, I would need your help getting the remains out. Pretty fresh. Do we have any idea what happened? Not the faintest, except that the farmer who had this thing in operation didn't see the body until it was finished baling and spit out of this baler.
Okay, of the 15 unsolved bank robberies committed last week, I couldn't find one that involved gunfire, but I did find one that involved a car crash. Bendsville Savings and Loan.... The bank is 10 miles from where the body was found. Well, see the mask? It matches the one found on our victim.
That's right, yes. And then Gormogon killed the apprentice to make room for Zack. Killed him, in fact, on the exact same night as the lobbyist. Wait a second, hold on a second, your gray matter has me a little confused. In order to exonerate Dr. Addy, we need to find the previous apprentice and examine his body for any evidence it might provide.
I don't even know why. I just... just can't. This is bullshit. The voice tells you you can't stop. Tell the voice to fuck off.
The first beats when your heart traveled alone. When they called you crybaby, or poor, or fat, or crazy, and cast you out, you drank their poison and kept silent. Later, when death greeted you in the hail of bombs and bullets.... no flag protected you. You had only a hat to cover your heart. You did not coddle your weakness, even if it was inside you.
- Are you married? - No. - Do you have children? - No. And what is your flaw? In short, my work. It takes up all of my time, and I like it that way.
And certainly they feel the same way about cancer. People have inherited the bad habits. Environmentally, they have inherited certain food and. Life patterns into their adult world and passed them on to their children, and therefore they get the same diseases that maybe their parents and grandparents had before them. But it's not inevitable. Even with a genetic predisposition, it doesn't necessarily have to manifest.
People have inherited the bad habits. Environmentally, they have taken certain food and. Life patterns into their adult world and passed on to their children, and therefore they get the same diseases that their parents and grandparents may have had before them. But it's not inevitable. Even with a genetic predisposition, it doesn't necessarily have to manifest. Whether it manifests or not depends on epigenetic variables, the things you can control.
I went to the Central Office of Food Safety. The watchdogs over the state food regulatory agency. To see if we need to worry about drugs in our food. As far as we know, there are 450 different drugs given to animals. Either alone or in combination. Animals are given these drugs for many reasons, but only a few of them, are beneficial to the health of the consumer. We have pharmaceutical companies that go to great lengths to ensure that they give people who raise cows, pigs and. chickens, can sell a lot of drugs. The pharmaceutical industry sells 80% of the antibiotics they make in the U.S. to animal breeders.
The tobacco industry paid $400 billion to state Medicaid programs. Advocates of cheeseburger laws say, "We can't let the same thing happen to the meat and dairy industry." The fact that these laws are based on a model, the Responsible Consumption Act is actually ironic because what they're saying is, as a consumer, you should be responsible and know that the food is bad for you. I often saw the meat industry epitomized in people who may not understand its power or reach, because it has as much money as the big tobacco and pharmaceutical industries, but it has the personality of the National Rifle Association.
- I would have to estimate... - Yes. ...how long it would take me. Go to... There she is.
You would think you would want to be more comfortable. You said it was urgent. My friend Drew's mom said you were a miracle worker.... I'm not a miracle worker. Therapy is a serious commitment and it starts with communication.
We have capitalized. And our work package was presented. Are you guys ready to take this to the next level? Yes! Thank Synergy for providing us with easy pickings.
Yes, well, you didn't know it would poison everyone. The city died because of me. So they're welcome to think I'm the messiah. If it gives them hope, they'll go on through it. Mercedes, you can't go on carrying this burden, it will break you.
And I hear they want to come back and finish what they started. But they don't know your face. So you can sneak into their camp, cut their power, then I can finish them off for good. Undercover work. - Are you in?
Allow. A good bracelet is as important as the watch itself. That's what I get for being thrifty. We'll find it for you. Where is it?
I was in India and had to face a cobra! And only for this stupid box! This box is sacred. Do you know why? It contains Camille's grave dirt.
Okay, the sangria may have been too strong. She was trying to kill me. This will help. She threw an ax at me. It's stuck in the shelf.
They respect you. What's your plan? Clary. She will recognize the trap. Even the smart mouse will walk into the trap if he wants the cheese.
There's a good chance she's there. Let's go. That was Azazel. Izzy's necklace. It's broken.
Make it a double tequila. Make it two. I'll pay for them. Hey, Kaelie, it's been a long time. Rejection is a lot more fun when it happens to you.
Wait! Son of a bitch! I said stop it! You want an underworld revolt? That's how it starts.
I invented that. The lance is the McGuffin. - The what? - The what? The thing in the movie that everyone wants. Where is it?
The lance is the McGuffin. - The what? - The what? The thing in the movie that everyone wants. Where is it? In the movie, it's broken.
I wasn't supposed to know you didn't want me. No. You're right. I didn't want children. But the voyages on the Waverider taught me one thing. Time often doesn't give us what we want. But it knows how to give us what we need.
What makes me so interesting? You're wearing the hood of one of my students, Yao Fei Gulong. Did you get my text about John? If there's any trace on the file Dig needs, it'll be buried behind some heavy firewalls.
But I want to go to Palo Alto. I'm meeting with an investor about my new app. Okay. What kind of app? It's like Uber, only better.
Jesus. AA. Oh, my God. Tell me about your app, Dad. Well, it's called R Car.
Did you read the article about this island in the north where World War III is supposed to break out? Let's assume that it won't. That's insane, because.... The polar ice caps are melting, so now new islands are forming at the North Pole. This one island, everybody's fighting over who owns it.
So you're not just giving me the file because of John. I have what we need to exonerate John. - Where did you get this? - Long story. I want to see Alexi Leonov. I know exactly how this brotherhood works, and right now it's working for me.
Prometheus has you so fixated on what's wrong with you that you don't perceive what's right at all. You know, John and Felicity listen to you because you have more to offer than just this. Your past is a part of you. You can't do anything about it. You can't change it. But that doesn't mean it has to be an anchor.
- In fact, those were his exact words. - Okay. You need to get out of here. And he said those will be your exact words. - The bomb's in countdown mode. - What? It's linked to a fail-safe.
- You just want to believe that. - No. I know that for a fact. If I had my gun back then, my wife would still be alive. Here you go. I don't know if it's still true.
About what? An exclusive interview. Can we set up an appointment tomorrow? I'm late for dinner. The thing is, this story... it's important. It's a matter of life and death.
This laptop contains bank transfers over 40 million rubles from Kovar, which Gregor did not disclose. This is very disappointing. I liked many of you. Prometheus surprised me with a very special, unique movement. It was taught to me by a woman I met in Russia.
I am at the mayor's disposal at any time. There you are. Viktor has confirmed the whereabouts of Gregor, but tell me, why won't you let him go and why are you playing Robin Hood? I met a woman. She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so it wouldn't consume me.
I hurt her! What do you mean, you hurt her? I heated up some soup for her. It was just all I could make her.... And she was on the stove and I was passed out from the booze.
- Okay. Spin me. You want to see what else they can do? The next one goes into his head. Then she'll have to go through me. Go!
I told you it was more complicated when you were sitting on the other side.... What the hell is more complicated? You're holding someone without a lawyer, without a trial, without justice. And the world is safe for that. It might be safer... but it's not better.
your guilt -- Oliver, no! Your bloodlust -- your cruelty. This gun. It only has one bullet.
Yeah, that really doesn't make a lot of sense. I mean, after everything she's done? No offense. Maybe it has something to do with the staff. Maybe your soul isn't as dark as it used to be.
I need to clear this with Simon personally. It's none of my business, but after everything that's happened, - maybe you should give Simon time. - No. I can't let him think that what happened at the Seelie court was my true feelings. Seelie magic can be misleading, but it's always true.
Don't give her a reason to put Aldertree back in. Thanks for the help. But it doesn't make up for what you did to mom. Alec. We have a complicated relationship. It's not complicated.
Then who has it? I bet you would like to have your precious soul sword now. You're lucky. I'll give it to you. Because of my demon blood, it wouldn't be wise to leave a powerful weapon lying around, even if it's deactivated.
Not a day goes by that I don't think of you, that my decision to send you to Edom doesn't haunt me. I have always dreamed of creating the ultimate warrior. That dream is now a reality. You have always been my greatest creation, son. Always! I have not been to the cabin for years. It's over the hill.
I always dreamed of creating the ultimate warrior. That dream is now a reality. You have always been my greatest creation, son. Always! I haven't been to the cabin for years. It's over the hill. There it is.
Good. Friends. Where's the mirror? I don't care what you do. I promised Jocelyn. Loyalty, an admirable quality, until it kills you.
That's why he's unbalanced. You could be great with some coaching. -Do you really think so? -Yes, you have a good nose. I'm glad you like it.
I went to bed every night in a world of magic where anything was possible. And one day you find out that Santa Claus doesn't exist, and neither does the Tooth Fairy. And there is no remote farm for old dogs. Then I started reading history books, and Jesus doesn't exist either. And everything that made the world more than what it is is just.... They're just stories.
When you die, you decompose. I love you, puppy. It is not always tails. It was an arduous journey east, across the land bridge from Siberia. Freezing cold and dark, and it had taken a bitter toll.
- What kind of gift? My coin. Yes, I know someone who is looking for that coin. He can't get it. It's mine now.
- But they could. And if not, you could sacrifice yourself. You've done it before. And the world opened up to me. Since then, it's closed again.
Yes. So this character, your character, could he change his future? More precisely, if he allowed certain events to take their natural course, was he only consolidating the timeline that would later lead to a terrible event? There were two schools of thought. One faction, a group of fans, believed the future was constantly changing. It is not fixed and therefore - you could do anything you want with the future.
- Yes, challenge me. Barry, you need my help. Your shoulder's still hurt. - It's okay. It's almost healed.
The Foundation Day Parade. They ring the foundation bell every year. This is a replica. The real one was thrown over something called Wickery Bridge in 1992. Anyway, I've spent the last three weeks sending people into the river to look for the bell, but they haven't found anything. But I know it still exists because it can't be destroyed.
- Why? At Wickery Bridge, Elena's parents' car went off the road. When the sheriffs recovered the car, they found something else. The old founder's bell. It was broken, but they had recovered it.
Seline is also here. She has the tuning fork. They are forcing Ethan to attach it to the bell. When my master, Cade, heard about the bell's ability to drive us off your land, he thought of another use for it. What will it do?
One. Two. Three. The bell has been tampered with! It will destroy us all!
Come. Grab your blindfold and headphones. Sybil liked to hear herself talk. But in all the chatter, she mentioned that she had an insurance policy against Cade. I bet this is what she meant.
The worst place you can put an aspirator. Really, the very worst. I mean, there's practically... Magic in the walls. See? Okay, it's... Okay, it's... not practically in the walls.
Throat ripped out from one ear to the other. - Good morning to you, too. The guy was a known drug dealer with enemies. His throat wasn't ripped out. It was cut with a knife.
Please. Okay. Seriously. Ramsey dragged him back... to their cave. It's empty.
- Good work, Eileen. - Thanks. So this chick with her, this "Pat Benatar" wannabe? It's got to be Dagon, I guess. Okay, so... so... Kelly and Dagon hide out in this pad, and then it bursts into flames.
No, we won't. We might make it in three days. Two, if we're lucky. I know you can feel it... the air is thin. And it's getting thinner.
Can you get me in? You? I, uh... Maybe. But I need my equipment. - Where is it?
Ok. Thank you. Okay, stop it, Frankie. It's okay now. Thanks again for the soup. It was delicious.
Okay, stop it, Frankie. It's okay now. Thanks again for the soup. It was delicious. You're welcome, even if you don't deserve it.
This is a very complicated case. You need a very good legal scholar to do that. Can I have a tablet, please? In the respected volume Nuptial Law, John Locke's seminal work of 1690 is quoted as saying that the law of the land.... Klaus's legal reasoning had the apocryphal depth of a Thurgood Marshall and the moral aplomb of an Ida B. Wells, which is to say it was very impressive and persuasive.
And so Martin Luther King said, "Morality cannot be a law, but behavior can be regulated. Court decisions may not change hearts but they restrain the heartless." This moral argument had the apocryphal depth of a Thurgood Marshall and the moral sovereignty of an Ida B. Wells. It was very impressive and convincing.
This is the reptile room. Feel free to look around. Here is the lizard wing, and this is a winged lizard. Its yellow striped belly is a sign of camouflage and cowardice. Can it really fly?
Hey. I remember when I fell in love with her. Every second I couldn't be with her almost killed me. Her love is different. It's nuanced.
What? - Partner. From what ... - The fiddle trick with the watch. But who goes in and says it's worth 50 grand?
I'm going. Okay? I'm going. But give me the bag. Without it, I'm a dead man. Where is it?
AIDS was not discovered until 1981. HIV was not known to be the cause until '83. It takes time to unravel such things, even for doctors. Would you say your illness affects your thinking? No, it affects me physically.
And in three weeks, she'll have a new one to finish. Good morning, students. This is your principal speaking. MR. WEATHERBEE REKTOR There have been a lot of inquiries because of the upcoming pep rally. I want to make it very clear that it will take place as scheduled.
Thank you, Principal Weatherbee. It fills my heart with joy to see so many of you here, even in this weather. But Riverdale has never had to complain about a lack of courage and school spirit. Today's pep rally is nothing like the ones we've seen in the past. Nor should we pretend it is.
But you have to admit it. Admit what? If I had a football game tomorrow, would you stop me? - I'd... I'd... - No, because you understand football... respect it. But my music, ever since I told you about it, you don't care about it.
Who the hell is Jennifer Gibson? That's not all. Oh, God. Are you guys still on this crazy witch hunt? It's not a witch hunt, and she's not crazy.
Come along. Jughead. Here's something else about fear: Sometimes it grows up with you. Or it nests in you and ties up your guts.
Congratulations, Mr. Andrews. That looks like a win. Excuse me. The thing about fear is, it's always there.
Are you ready, Jugs? See you tomorrow. I'm sorry, Ms. Lodge, your card was declined. Really? And I'm sure it was reported stolen. Yes.
Dad. What's wrong? I always have to tell you about my problems, too. The company. It's in trouble.
And if things continue like this, the Coopers will soon no longer exist. And there's nothing I can do about it. Betty, don't do this. Don't give up. Your family is having a hard time right now, but it's not breaking up because of you.
My dad hired Jughead's dad to trash the drive-in. And in light of recent events, it's quite conceivable that he could have hired him for other jobs as well. E.g. for killing Jason as revenge for what the Blossoms did to him. I want to help you with your investigation. I want to know the truth, no matter what it is.
Hey can you get the milk out? One cup coming up. That rhymes. Oh, I'm a poet. Okay, dump it in, then I'll start the blender.
One cup coming up. That rhymes. Oh I'm a poet. Okay, dump it in, then I'll start the blender. Here it comes.
I see. He was supposed to meet me here and... I'm starting to get worried because he's not answering his cell phone. And I wanted to check on him to make sure he was okay, but I don't know his address here. So that's when I was wondering if you could give me that from your guestbook? It's not in the guestbook.
Thank you. I am sure that you saved my life. That was my goal. I know I had a gun on me. Where is it?
Did she kill herself? No. And you know who killed her? Or do you think you do? I just need my damn gun, make it show up. In time, I'll be strong enough to walk.
I was never an Edna, and certainly not a saint. I have read all your poems. I am one of your biggest fans. "My candle burns at both ends; it does not last the night;
But... It still feels like I'm going down without coming back up. I know it can seem harsh. But look at this list. It's not that long.
What wisdom are you sharing with us in your vlog today? "How to apply false eyelashes." Am I a bad person? - Because you made a hard choice? - It wasn't hard for me.
Good plan. And I, Consuela Rivas, take this man, Phillip Hawthorne, to be my husband. "Love is patient. Love is kind. It knows neither envy nor boasting.
Yeah. Something like that. Take care of Zig for me. "Love knows no malice, only truth. Always it protects, always it trusts, always it hopes, always it endures."
Need help with something? This company has been dissolved, unfortunately. I beg your pardon? The company. It doesn't exist anymore, okay?
- Sorry, Mom. - Hi, Mrs. Powers. How was work? A kid swallowed a battery. She came out. No damage to the intestines.
Why is it important that I am bi? Do I need a special place? No, but it's the only one available, and you qualify for it. Your voice is underrepresented. It deserves to be heard to help others.
- are you seriously suggesting... - No, I don't... I don't know. I just can't anymore. So I don't have a say, even though it's about my relationship. Not if it's detrimental to my health.
How bad is it? I'll find out in the evening. Where are you going? I surrendered to this disease as soon as I saw it. I knew it would kill me. I wanted to kill myself first.
They will be outnumbered. They will wear less armor and be worse armed. My sister's army is fighting out of fear. The unsullied will fight for something greater. They will fight for freedom and for the one who gave it to them.
What the hell is the ambulance doing here? - The park is closed. - You think it's for this guy? Let's find out. It's locked.
It's about Pete. - I've had a really bad day. Whatever it is, it'll have to wait. Go ahead, put it on. Vince wants you to wear the uniform. I gotta see if it fits.
All of us. I'm working with Marius. We're gonna take Vince down. - How's the hand? Still bleeding.
If that reassures you... There's a crime prevention class for seniors. I sleep there. Thanks, we'll manage. Okay, just one last question. Do you own a gun? If so, was it stolen?
Thanks, we'll manage. Okay, just one last question. Are you in possession of a gun? If so, was it stolen? No. You don't have one, or was it not stolen?
-Thank you. -You have a gun. -Yes. Stolen? No, it's upstairs in the safe.
I am tired of living on the beach. I would like to know how that works. You climb over the wall. There's a low point where the wall goes through the mountains. It's only 50 meters high there.
Safety is my responsibility and I have clarified the situation. Yes. Clearly, you were in control. The only reason they sent me here was to reduce the prisoner attrition rate. If it doesn't continue to drop, maybe I'll explain your methods to them.
What? Open up. Coming. Open up! The new guys were just here. They must have locked it behind them.
And I bet they know where this one is. You know that nut job who's running around pregnant? No, I've never seen her. I can see you don't realize how far we're willing to go to get all these clones. You better get used to the new future, Art. Because it's right around the corner.
What are you doing? - I'm fixing the vase. It can't be fixed. "Justitia in suo cuique tribuendo cernitur." "Justice is known by the fact that it grants to each his own."
- PTSD? - Cults want to dominate the mind. They have been dominating yours for a very long time. Right. A colleague gave me information about a support group. It is for people who have been brainwashed.
Face it, pumpkin. The monarchy. So we're not the first students from Brakebills to go to Fillory or ascend to the throne. That's a great question for history class, but.... if the Beast goes to the spring right now and sucks it dry, magic dies in Fillory. - If it dies there...
The Monarchy. So we're not the first students from Brakebills to go to Fillory or ascend to the throne. That's a great question for history class, but.... if the Beast goes to the spring right now and sucks it dry, magic dies in Fillory. - If it dies there... - It dies here.
And, my dear, I assure you.... I believe that since my life began, the most I had was a talent to amuse. If love were everything. Wait a minute, the cabin was here, wasn't it? It's not invisible, it's just not there.
There is a lot at stake. Which I also predicted would be the case one day. Well, welcome to "someday." No one but you can be within 20 feet of the blast... It will kill everyone, including your beast.
That was the second key to my car that disappeared down the storm drain. I didn't throw it in there, you did. -You shouted, "She's flying to you!" -I thought there was a bat. And if it was a bat... I know it wasn't. It would have rabies.
Does anyone remember the quill choreography? -Yes, I do! -Thank God. Show us, Steve. It's pretty simple.
I'm sorry I called you for a boo-boo. It's no big deal. I'll just examine you. Let me see your tongue. It's a little busy.
The letters do not work in any other language! - People rarely notice that. - It looks like a phone booth! Well, that's the cloaking device. It hides itself.
- People rarely notice that. - It looks like a phone booth! Well, that's the cloaking device. It hides itself. It hides itself with a "pull to enter" sign on the front?
Or do you think her ham sandwich likes you too? So, what is it? And what's it doing on Earth? There were burn marks on the ground where we found it. Could be from a shuttle. The puddle, what did it look like?
You should think about that if you want to use that in your defense. When Auggie turns 19, he's going to do something terrible. What? His parents' marriage will continue to break up. It will become violent.
- Monroe... can you move? Camera got knocked over. They must have come from behind the dresser. Check behind it. - It's hollow.
Camera was knocked over. They must have come from behind the dresser. Check behind it. - It's hollow. - Looks like it's connected to the wall.
Why do you want to be a telephone operator? You want me to say it's the best job in the world. But we both know that would be a lie. Your job is much better. But unfortunately, it's apparently not available.
There you are. We need to talk. You hate marriage. When did I say that? You always said it was stupid and nonsensical.
That was our thing, you know? He did something and I did something in return and so on and so forth. A friendship like that? What can I say? - Was it legendary?
That's enough. Cancel, I repeat, cancel. Companies Uribe and Hernandez, please take your seats. You know what? You were right about marriage. It's stupid.
I assume by "new beginning" you mean doing something to help Mike Ross now that he is out in the world. Anita, you heard his speech to the jury. He was given a gift and he squandered it. And it was so effective because he meant it.
Sell it to somebody else, Harvey. Because I'm done with it. Now I know why school ends at 3:00. Why is that? Because if it went until 6 p.m., no teacher would come back.
You always talk like we're your only family. You need to make things right with your mom. Mike, what are you doing here? I thought school started at 7:00. It does.
I just didn't feel like arguing with you. She touched you, didn't she? I'm sad about dad. And, yes, she hit the nail on the head, but one speech doesn't make up for everything. Maybe it doesn't.
You would find your way back to grief no matter how far you ran from it. Well, that's comforting. Isn't there anything else you long for? I've gotten everything I've ever wanted. Magic is real, and it can fix everything except what I need.
-Really? -Everything I know about you points to that. Do you like my hair? No. Actually, it's hideous.
Do you like my hair? No. In fact, it's hideous. It looks like a janitor put a mop on your head. It doesn't frame your face.
-I know what it's about. It... It was silly to think I'd stop the chemistry between us if I didn't give you the letter. If the socially frowned-upon age difference can't hurt her.... Then she can take anything.
How's it going, Hoss? Someone here bought a jacket from me some time ago. With a parrot on the collar. Yes. It belongs to the pet dragon.
I had 24 last year. I've had a lot to do. I think I'm through with art. Or rather... Art is through with me. She has spoken.
-Hey, you. Under the stairs. Hidden, like the shame of the family. I like your art. It's useless and impractical.
Bob Mackie plus Jesus' orgasm. Classic Gucci, you know? Handmade, by badass Italian women. You should see my apartment. It's unrecognizable.
He had the labor complaint case. I took care of it. Mike, your job is not to generate cases. It's to advise on cases that we already have. I know that, but it's also to help make our associates better lawyers.
And I have a feeling if you do that, you will have withdrawn the case by tomorrow morning. - Hey. - Hey. You left so fast during the presentation so I couldn't ask what you thought of it. I had to go to the lecture, but I thought it went great.
Then, please, Marcel. If a part of you still cares about me, then help me. Because of what we were to each other, because of what we shared, I beg you to let my brother go. And if I say no? You know better than anyone that my family always gets what they want.
But don't you think Hope deserves a father? Hey. Look at me. Yeah, history could repeat itself. If you're not careful, it will.
No. Too bad. Because, if you don't want to be my friend, then you're screwed. So much for the fly. She was a worthy opponent.
Now I am. Take Riley and the others to the medical station and tell them we will take them to their villages in the morning. Where is it? We don't have the plane. Didn't she survive the landing?
Take Riley and the others to the medical station and tell them we will take them to their villages in the morning. Where is it? We don't have the plane. Didn't she survive the landing? No. She did, but I had a choice... Bring the plane home, or use it to save them.
I knew the risks of a powerful autonomous machine. -I knew the dangers.... -And you thought I was one. You didn't want this technology under the control of a director you didn't know. No, I didn't. And now it's completely out of control. And I'm sorry about that.
One probably also looks up to you. -The Hero of Vienna. -Not as great as you make it out to be. I've been given too much credit. True heroes are not concerned with fame. Some seek the truth in the face of danger, even if it means living in hiding.
I have seen into your brain. I know what you want, or rather who you want. You see? You know it. I saw the closeness between you. It was always there.
She got pregnant, we were happy. But when Hope was born, it was.... It was touch and go. She only lived four days. Her story was over before it began.
This guy really hits. -Do you have anything like cyanide...? - "Cyanide"? - "Cyanide"? Or a paper bag. You put it over my head, I'll suffocate quick.
Software that programs you to die. Possibly. But I have something you will never have. A soul that lives on, long after I'm gone. How can you be so sure I don't have one? If the soul doesn't come from flesh and blood and from my zeros and ones, it must come from somewhere else, from something that has nothing to do with our bodies.
I worked to improve the connection, to make it grow. Supervisor? The chemical in its pure form is harmless in humans. But if you're a potential Inhuman... It transforms you.
There is no excuse for that. Okay, pay attention. What's that? A high frequency caused by Shockley's cell vibrations. The ramping up of kinetic energy at the atomic level. When it exceeds a critical threshold, this massive energy converts his body from a solid to an ignitable gas.
What if he never knew me? What if he can't remember? This... This reality is flawless. - It sucks you in.
How did you notice the security breach? His colleague saw him hiding contraband in his locker. A camera. - Was there film in it? - No, no film. In fact, it was ancient.
- Guess it's time to see what the big man can do. - Why not? - Because he shouldn't go. I'm going in his place. - I thought this world meant nothing to you, that it wasn't real.
- Why not? - Because he should not go. I'm going in his place. - I thought this world meant nothing to you, that it wasn't real. - It's not.
It's called... I'm not going to explain that now. Let's move on. The resistance must have a base of operations. Where is it? I don't know.
This is quantum energy manipulation. Darkhold technology. Dark what? I know this machine. It was designed to create elements out of nothing.
I know this machine. It was designed to create elements out of nothing. This one seems to create something even more complex. That machine required huge amounts of energy. It was powered by a hydroelectric dam.
Do you think I don't know who you are? Where you come from? You come from the other world. Like the others. You are just as tainted. You want to talk about the "other world," as you call it?
Is much to process that it is not real. - Fake news, hydras alternative history. - That's just the tip of the iceberg. What do you mean by that? What if I were to say that this whole world is not real, that it's just a simulation designed to hold us captive?
- They don't understand. Aida... Madame Hydra has set in motion forces from which no army can protect him. Does this have something to do with that... ...that machine Leopold was working on? It's going to kill everyone who means anything to Fitz.
Ever seen it? What? - Have you seen the show "Mythbusters"? No. Is it good? - It is.
A storage room? In Osaka. What about a soul that doesn't fit? It's like an organ transplant. The body would reject a kidney if it didn't fit.
I don't want to forget them. Fuck. A rose is a rose, except here. Here it must mean something. It is beautiful.
Good morning, boys and girls. Who's ready to tear Watson Industries a new asshole? I'd like to see that. Lying on your desk, I've made each of you a copy of my first instruction. Stick to it as if you wrote it yourself, and if any of you need to go to the bathroom, I suggest you do it now, because for the next 2 weeks, we are not leaving this room.
So the world is coming to an end, huh? Why? What makes you think that? Logic. Science. The world has been ending since you came into being.
If I slip too far into memory, I can't get out. I've been banished to my room. It's been 13 days so far. My door is unlocked. It's not even closed all the way.
That's where we disagree. Who are you planning to eat, Loki? Because you kill people, don't you? -It's not all song and dance. -It's... -I got a deal with my old gang. I could leave, and if they have a body, it goes in my van at the Magic Mountain parking lot.
Rachel, whatever you do, push it aside, and look for every single case where a person has been admitted to the bar and the vote has not been unanimous. Mike, what's going on? Anita Gibbs found a way onto the committee. Then we better look for a way to get her kicked back out. Harvey's working on that. But in the meantime, I need to know the details about this committee, because as long as she is on it, she is going to use every dirty trick in the book to end this thing before it even starts.
- Exactly. And I want to know why I found out from her and not from you. I'll tell you why because I didn't know. But now that I know, that's the end of it. - The hell it is.
Julius, I work at a counseling center, but not as a lawyer. The opportunity arose to become one, and I turned it down, but then I had to sit there and watch a woman get put out on the street because I couldn't help her. And I knew that I would have to watch that happen over and over again. When the opportunity came a second time, I took it. Because I knew it wouldn't happen again.
Mike, I told you I'd get it done. I'll get it. - Anything? - No. Same as your call an hour ago. If he killed someone and hid the light, no one knows where it's hidden.
How exciting. You say that. Who doesn't like the future? I like history. It's full of horror and violence,
We are Camelot! We are Camelot! We are Camelot! The dark army approaches! - It's in the forest!
It's about time. Do you know what the Force is making me? Someone evil? Devilish? It makes me a goddess.
- You flatter me. - I wrote only the truth. I'm learning to keep digging, even when the evidence points in one direction. There is another side. - Even if it's hard to find.
The DEO and Supergirl can't stop us this time. So you're saying that Jeremiah Danvers, former DEO agent and Alex and Kara's long-lost father, returned with news from Cadmus that our enemy has developed a nuclear fusion bomb using Kara's heat vision radiation and that they're going to drop it on National City and kill us all? Is this building bomb proof? You could run a search for Kara's heat vision signature. Yes, if the bomb is activated, I might find its location before it goes off. Good.
- No, nothing. Could they have developed some kind of cloaking device? No, they would have needed me for that. Keep looking. She'll show up eventually.
Of course, yes, I do. Or have you been so distracted by Kryptonians in capes since your escape from Daxam? How did you find me? We heard your signal. The transmission was incomplete, but it led us to this galaxy.
Me too. Less than 2 hours. Time is running out fast. I know. And when it runs out completely, we both lose.
It was like something was controlling him. Do you think the same thing happened to his mother? Maybe she's not the perpetrator like we thought, but the victim. Just like Marcus. Either way, he needs to stay in this cell for now. It's equipped with telekinetic dampeners, which should prevent another episode.
We need to get to safety. Welcome to New Daxam. Leave us. How's the invasion going? Is it as much fun as you'd hoped?
I can't get this to work. I know it works. I have played it before. Edie, still has the instruction manual. Come to think of it, it's just like Edie to have filed them away.
I just wanted to say thank you you are good at your job, Noelle. You don't have to tell me, but... is that the stuff from Eric's van? The guitar wasn't in there. It wasn't in his house, either.
All that matters is avoiding further acts of terrorism, Tanya. I realize that the increased threat level...puts an additional burden on the governors of your states. So... I'm asking each and every one of you: Quite apart from the moral questions that exist...how is it going to be possible to close the borders? I know this strategy will hurt some people. But let me explain why it is necessary.
What do you really think about it? - Of what? - The president's warmongering. Most people in Washington think it's scandalous. It is scandalous.
- Your statement cannot be private. I am sorry to hear that. I just wanted to let you know. What is a "blood tide warning"? It appears on all cell phones.
- Why are we sitting on an air mattress? There is no other place to sit. They should furnish the apartment. - Yes. It would look better furnished.
Why so melancholy? Did you think after the Chambre de Chasse - our unfit family would be cured? - It felt like the world had stopped. But it didn't. It continued to spin.
- From whom? From him. From the vampires. For five years, we kept quiet. You ruled this town like you owned it.
Besides... Mission accomplished! Do you really think this weapon can kill Marcel? It took time, my blood, Esther's magic power, Marcel's poison and Lucien Castle's ashes. In combination, they are enough to kill him.
Out of obligation to family ties, perhaps? I was in Klaus' head. You're worth a lot to each other. This devotion to your own blood is grotesque. Look what it's gotten you.
- What happened so far: - This blade contains dark magic. It causes endless torment.
I don't think I have a choice. You have outdone yourself. I think so too. What a pity that these beautiful fabrics will soon be blood red. Violence should only be a last resort. It would weaken our position.
The ancestors are gone. We need a new strategy against the void. We cut their connection to this world, but if there is something of Davina's there, she can accept the sacrifice and restore the connection. - This weapon can kill Marcel? - It's strong enough to kill him.
Really hot? At least you won't be boiled alive! You think I didn't want to get rid of him? I went through the file, too. That's why it was in my office.
Do you want to change after we drop him off? I want to fall down in sheet togas again. Yes. Maybe we can find the gun that way. Back to square one, then we'll remember where it is.
- Is there a space Scotland? They're everywhere, demanding independence no matter where they land. What are you doing here? Because I figured out why the box looks like an emergency cell. I said it was stuck.
- Basically. So... - You're not from the Fairford Club. - The creature in the river. - Where did it come from?
- They are not from the Fairford Club. - The creature in the river. - Where did it come from? - Who the hell are you? - Where did she come from?
- Where did she come from? - Who the hell are you? - Where did she come from? - Nowhere! She has always been there.
It was them. You told me what to do. Chief. Sir... Give me a coin. Now, flip it.
-Yes. You're about to win the award for best playwright of all time. Really? I didn't know they gave that award. I didn't know they had that award. They made it for you.
-No, they can't. -It's done, sir. -Whistle back the missile. -She's already gone. -Then redirect them.
A bit crass, isn't it? He deserved it, with all that swagger. Yeah, I guess he did. I know you started the foundation. It's going to do a lot of good.
Snape was a Slytherin. He could love unselfishly. I had a snake once. A tiger python named Krueger. Actually, it belonged to Cal, but Krueger liked me best.
Were certainly a gift from someone with expensive taste. With expensive taste, but a withered soul. In my memory, there was just talk of a resumption of training. Where the problem was the initiative already in place. That's what they call training to save the wages of the inmates.
It used to be possible. You could always talk to someone if you wanted to. Or share cookies and... Now it's just, "Fuck you, inmate. I'm going to fuck up your life, just because I can." Simple kindness has become rare, and I don't think it's coming back anytime soon.
Because we won. We fought back and won. Now you're a blind cow. And you are... a... I almost lost my humanity in this mess... but now it's starting to come back.
- I'm serious about that. - Okay, man. I want to know everything you're doing here with the Hairies. An extreme adaptive ability is rooted in Hairy DNA. It is the source of their power.
Excellent. Oh, you hear that, boy? It's killing me. It means the past is trying to reach you, trying to tell you something. It's connected to this land, boy... and connecting with it will make you stronger.
-What is good? You have committed an obvious act. What is it? Do you see this camera? It sees you.
I want to buy your strip club. Your titty bar. And why did they let you in? Because I want to pay your bail. It was really high, too. Coupling and endangering a minor, not once, but five times.
- Mine. I looked at the inventory and found it left a lot to be desired. Calm down again. Competition is good for you. It builds character.
I have a church. You have a boat. And a sidewalk in front of it in St. Louis. A church is not a building. But it can be if you build it right.
- Yes? Yes, even several things. Take a look here... This column. At first glance, it seems perfect.
Yes, well, I know. I do know that. And your testimony has so many helpful details. So accurate. It helped me a lot.
You must have told me the story 500 times. I'm not good at making things up. I know. I thought of that today. If the story is true, tell it.
- It was good. - Okay, cool. Because I found this cute one-bedroom apartment in Venice. We can go see it later. - It's not even on the market yet. - Cool.
Investigated, searched for leads. Did you find Detective Diaz's gun at the scene? No, ma'am. Are you sure? Did you look everywhere?
Did you find Detective Diaz's gun at the scene? No, ma'am. Are you sure? Did you look everywhere? It wasn't in his holster.
No, ma'am. Are you sure? Did you look everywhere? It wasn't in his holster. Was it under the bed?
Was it under the bed? - I don't know. - Did you look under the bed? - No, ma'am. - Was she in the bathroom?
Hurry up, it's getting thicker. What the hell? Are you ready? Yes. Let's hope it works. That was the only one in the store.
- What is it? - What did you see? It's another body. Another one? The drone... it's stuck.
This is not happening. This is not happening. Calm down. It's going to be okay. She doesn't want to take off.
Shall we try? There. Okay. Now cross your fingers that the battery still has enough juice. It has juice!
I don't want you to call her as a witness. Marx is eating you alive. The circumstances of your dismissal discredit your testimony. - What? - It's useless now.
Come on, Benny. It was just a job! It was still closed. So I got to the church and the wedding ceremony kind of started. -No, it didn't.
My God. Are you okay? Yeah, baby, don't worry. I just wanted your wedding to be perfect. It will be when you get there.
I found... you. You are my compassion. My better self. My good angel. I am bound to you as by a strong bond. You are well gifted lovable. An ardent a deep passion. It burns in my heart. It leans towards you and draws you into my midst.
Say what you will, but we came back with weapons and a plan. What do you have to show for it? Ta... damn... there. Your royal gear. This is ceremony, people, and I expect you to enjoy it to the fullest.
It was intrinsically armored, amphibiously powerful, with six-wheel drive and four-wheel steering. And I improved it even more. It has honeycomb-grid ceramic steel armor. It's three times thicker than the turret of an Abrams A1M1 tank. I fired a 7.62 bullet at the hull to test it. And it left only one such dent.
Vehicle located in open field. 45, Target. 45 sights target. This grenade has twice as much penetrating power as the grenade we fired from the tank. It has a range of 21 kilometers.
Here's the B-pillar, there's the steering wheel, and there's not enough room in between. Just a moment... That's typical Alfa Romeo! You put the door in the wrong place. It should be further back.
No, he's not! No May? I couldn't be there at all, because I was in another corner of the harbor and had my own plans. Last night, when the other two were in bed, I ordered our company yacht to the harbor. And there she is!
It is sad that the old car is gone, but in return a donkey can be saved. Your car lives on in the smile of an abandoned donkey. That is beautiful. That's what we're about. That's what this program is about. It comes from the heart.
The moth is a good friend of mine. And how is that possible? We met in my garden the other day. She landed on my hand. Can you explain what she was doing here then?
What do you think he came for? A forester I knew years ago told me about a brown bear mother who gave birth to three cubs. The foresters stayed around to keep an eye on them and make sure the cubs were safe from other predators. But they were shocked when the mother killed the first two of her cubs. They intervened and saved the last cub, a male. Why did she do it?
Troy was looking for fuel and protecting his men. - I know his version. - You want to hear ours? We're... We are building a new nation. It's not perfect.
You curl up, just lie around and watch TV. And as soon as the sun comes out, people get euphoric. And somehow you have to get out, do things outside. You have to take the chance to enjoy the sun, the warmth, as long as you can. You've got to soak up the sun so that it stays with you for the rest of the year.
Even with the same recipe, it ultimately depends on the hand of the grill master. Every hand is different, and so the result is different. Home is one of the most precious things of all. Like your parents, your children, one of the best things you have. It is irreplaceable.
Or that I could continue my profession here. There are countless spices in it. You have to know the spices you're working with. No one in the warehouse knows the blend I make. I'm the first one to use this blend. It is delicious.
The ties of My heart grieve Pure love runs over in it It is the tie to those
My family and my father, too. Vernon? Sit down. My dad doesn't think we're safe here. He helped build this ranch and he doesn't think it's safe for us anymore.
All I ever had was this ranch and the people here. I don't know, I just... I just don't understand it. The world out there... It's burned up.
Walker appreciates these relics. It's a trailer full of rocks and beans and shit. You scared, Jeremiah? Be careful, boy. You may not like my hospitality. But I guarantee you it's better than theirs.
I didn't survive Phil and Russell and two women to eventually die like a scaredy cat, unopposed. Walker has us surrounded. Don't do it, lose the ranch. Well... The ranch was never meant to shelter cowards afraid of Indians. No, it was meant to be an inheritance.
I told Mark how much I miss Marshall. He's still here. - Where are you going? - I forgot my purse. It's right there.
-Okay. Yes. You guys are awesome. Hey, cool app, Reggie. Thanks. I'm glad you like it.
Help us now. It decorates the crypt of the first commander, Bekka Pramheda. Where is the crypt? You think it is the bunker?
It adorns the crypt of the first commander, Bekka Pramheda. Where is the crypt? You think she is the bunker? She is in the temple.
A key card to the building where the shooting came from. That's conspiracy to assassinate the president, and that's capital punishment. I hope you have a good reason for all this, but if you don't give it to me, I can't help you. I'm handing you a lifeline. Grab it.
They lapse into professor mode. Carol from Philadelphia doesn't care about scientific opinions. She has to take two buses to find a cheap supermarket. She wants you to take care of it. I do, hence the reference to the study. It shows that with precise zoning laws and promotion of...
Can anyone suggest any amendments? This bill has untold loopholes. We are discussing what to do about the Bowman matter. I read the bill. It was on hold for a reason.
She's head of the Republicans, you're head of the Democrats. I want to mix it up a little bit. Our views on gun safety are different. I am reintroducing Bill 8180, which supports state checks. I oppose the bill, but I want it to go before the Senate.
We are, of course, counting on the support of Democrats in the Senate regarding SB 8180. Since you were once Attorney General in Massachusetts, I consider you an ally. Massachusetts has some of the strictest gun regulations in the country. General background checks should be state law. This bill may not be sufficient yet, but it points in the right direction.
If we are going to get this through Congress, we need a united front of Republicans. You are not helping anybody with this stunt. You are right. It's about more than background checks. I don't care about a united front if it compromises my values.
Because you are doing the right thing, sir, thank you. I had a productive meeting with President Kirkman today on SB 8180, a common sense approach to gun safety is long overdue, and expanding background checks gives Americans peace of mind. I am holding my colleagues in the Senate to pass this bill tomorrow so it can go to the House where we can all work together on it....
First the hearing. - You didn't say anything about my hair. - It looks fine. You didn't even notice it. It looks the same as before.
- You didn't say anything about my hairstyle. - It looks fine. You didn't even notice it. It looks the same as before. It always looks good...
I don't know. I presented myself well. Aaron saw it that way, too. You're inscrutable. I'm sure you were excellent.
That's exactly what I don't intend to do. I don't want to force you to do anything. I'm asking you to hold back your story. So it's false? It's incomplete.
Previously on Criminal Minds... I was able to increase the budget to hire a new agent. That's great. Well, I've made an offer. I expect an answer by tomorrow. And I'm crossing my fingers that it's yes.
But I will make an effort. I respect the fact that you're so absorbed in your role. What role? The she-wolf. It's clearly defined, and that's exactly what I need.
I prefer to say "exaggerated." That's the point. My brother once had to wrestle against someone with a snake. On the day of the match, the snake died. Kermit put on a sock puppet, and my brother pretended it was real.
"Tete de veau" is the name of this part of the calf. Fran. - What is its head? - Right. "French cuisine" for 600. If your duck is sauvage, it is.
- Hi, Glen. What have you got there? A little decoration for the ring from our sponsor. Sam. - Let me see.
According to the script, you're going to win anyway. Did you ask her about the camera? - What? - Your camera. She has it.
If not for us, then at least for yourself. You're right. I've been a silent partner for too long. And this mill... it has too many secrets.
Right, Charles? We'll be happy without the orphans. "It builds character." That's what people say to make you accept a bad situation. It is bad.
I want you to know I'm very grateful that you're adopting me. You're a sight for sore eyes, Mr. Cuthbert. Come along, then. - I'll take your bag. - I can manage it. It's not heavy.
You're a sight for sore eyes, Mr. Cuthbert. Come along, then. - I'll take your bag. - I can manage. It's not heavy. All my belongings are in it, but it's not heavy.
Please make the Cuthberts keep me. That's the only thing I really want. So you don't have to worry about my red hair anymore. Amen. - Where's my brooch? - It must be by the scarf.
That's the only thing I really want. So you don't have to worry about my red hair anymore. Amen. - Where's my brooch? - It must be by the scarf. It's not there.
- I did. I looked everywhere. The brooch is nowhere to be found. Give it back, at once. But I haven't got it, Miss Cuthbert. I really don't. I don't believe you. Where else would it be?
Can I stay here in Green Gables then? Did you take the brooch or not? I lost it. I was playing Lady Cordelia and went outside with the brooch. When I went to get water from the fountain, I bent down and it fell in.
I told you what this brooch means to me. I made that up. None of it is true. I didn't take the brooch. I don't know where it is.
Are you ordering the floor or stabbing it? You know this is stupid, right? We'll all be dead before anything grows. The earth survived Praimfaya once. It will do so again.
- I am... Wanheda. You helped my people find the bunker. Thank you for that. And you gave the flame to an unworthy king who made sure it was destroyed.
Here and here. The call of ascent. The flame was destroyed. How is that possible? You said that you saw it.
The call of ascent. The flame was destroyed. How is that possible? You said that you saw it. It was in shards.
What about them? Are we just saving ourselves? Clarke, if the night blood works, we need to get you to Polis, them too. We'll get as many people as we can before the death wave hits. If your mom makes us all nightbloods, we just have to stay down there until she's gone.
Marcus, how do we choose? We already have. Clarke's list. She was always our best chance at survival. And I know where she is.
There will be days when we will wish we were out there. But I promise you, if we stick together, if we are Wonkru, then... we will rise from the ashes. Did you hear that? It's 210 miles from Polis to the island. According to our last drone, the wave is accelerating. If we haven't lifted off at least 20 minutes before it arrives, the electromagnetic charge in the pyroclastic cloud will destroy the rocket's onboard electronics, which would mean we won't fly.
Of course, he gets the hug. - You decided to use the machine? - Yes. I did. It's in the lab, where we also...
- And... - Your number. Please call me back at 734682. Tell them what happened. The injection fell. - It broke.
Please call me back at 734682. Tell them what happened. The injection fell. - It broke. - She was due at 9:30.
I'm starting to lose it. I was in Ireland recently. I was alone in the green room. You had to turn on the lamp with a cord. It had gotten tangled into a noose.
Then we can afford to go on a cruise someday. I'm sure that would be fun." That's how it would work. That would be my ethnic cleansing. It doesn't depend on skin color or religion.
I didn't... I didn't mean it. I shouldn't have said that. I can't explain this world to you. I know it's not normal and it always will be.
I'm stuck and can't move forward. What do you think is holding you back? I'm sleeping with Eddie. Love is often much more powerful than faith. It can keep us from becoming what we could be.
What do you think is holding you back? I'm sleeping with Eddie. Love is often much more powerful than faith. It can keep us from becoming what we could be. It weakens us.
Okay, give her five haloperidol. The rumor mill br... The rumor mill is buzzing. - What? What are they saying?
I found something that... It's called the BXP protocol and it was started at Gillman. They are experimenting with human antibodies for immunotherapy in terminal cancer. It's a clinical trial. And it's successful?
Same place I am every night: Work. - I have employees who can confirm that. - What do you do? Run an online clothing company. Built it up from nothing.
No, not always, monkey. I mean, sometimes people feel like they have to... they have to pretend that everything's okay. But, and this is the most important part, you and I, we never have to pretend in front of each other. I didn't really like that school. I didn't like it either.
Molly... - ... Morgenstern. - Very controversial. Emma, your skin is not like butter. - It is butter.
- ... Morning star. - Very controversial. Emma, your skin is not like butter. - It is butter. - It's not.
You stuck the needle in his brain.... - I told you. I got the needle. - What if you don't? What if I slip and it goes right into his...
Oh, she's going to hate me. That's a good point. It took me a long time to tell you. Attraction is complicated. It grabs you when you least expect it.
- Hi. - What the hell? You need to leave. You need to walk out that door... okay? Right now. - It's not gonna open again.
Mommy! Daddy! Nathalie showed me a snake! It was a larva. She said it would turn into a beautiful moth one day.
This does not mean that they hoard. They had plenty of time to gather food. For all we know, they could have raided the stores before we started looking. - I know she came asking for board games, and if that's her biggest concern, it's because she's not worried about food. If they have more food, they should share it with us.
- They overanalyze the statistics. It's too confusing. And by now, scary. We've seen this one statistic, you may have too. It says that whenever Steph Curry hits 40% of threes, a black person is killed by police.
You should finally lick my vagina! Watch out, I love your vagina. It's a fantastic vagina. Then lick my vagina! It does not lick itself!
She is gone. But she is alive. And as long as she is, we can find a cure. The first course of action is here in the Treasury, so we need your expertise, Master Wells. The contagion was stopped in the past, so it can be stopped again.
- I am a witness. A title that has never been more appropriate. I have a responsibility. To witness this curse, to ward off evil, and to ensure that none of you become victims of a supernatural war that you did not choose to fight. So... I'm sorry, Mr. Crane, but I've made my own decision, and I'm pretty sure you won't like it.
Each sigil casts a different type of killing spell. Sigils are usually written down in occult texts, not burned into a person's skin. Yes, because as soon as you access a sigil, it burns up. I can't imagine what happens when it's on your body.
Old friend. The victim was a local child visiting her brother's grave. No eyewitnesses. At first I thought animal attack, but then I saw the severe ossification of the wound site. - Is that stone? - That's what I meant. The entire chest cavity looks like it's fossilized.
As if you didn't know? I'm sorry about Adam. I just keep making the same mistake. I keep forgetting how much this world sucks. It just fucks you up.
I did my duty and protected my lance piece. I am only from the infantry. Now it's your turn. Find a way to destroy the lance. It mustn't ruin any more lives.
The lance must be made of a magnetic substance that serves as its own putty. No. Do not touch it. The lance will try to seduce us into using it. It will exploit our weaknesses. Our desires. Our regrets.
No. Do not touch. The lance will try to seduce us into using it. It will exploit our weaknesses. Our desires. Our regrets. It will promise us we can reshape the world to our desires.
Your attempt was not good enough. - No. - Mick, don't! - Not on the ship. - He said "destroy," so I destroyed. It's not destroyed, not even singed.
- Not on the ship. - He said "destroy," so I destroyed. It's not destroyed, not even singed. Damage to the lance is temporary. It heals itself.
- No. They destroy them. I have tried that. Destruction is not possible. Yes, it is.
I understand. In your eyes, I will always be a criminal. This is fascinating. The lance lights up when there is divine blood. And it showed a message when Mick lit it.
According to this map, the blood of Christ is hidden in the middle of no man's land. Great. In the middle of the bloodiest battle in history. Even if we get through unscathed, the exact hiding place of the blood is unknown. Good news. The lance served as a divining rod to its parts and it glows when it is close to Jesus' blood.
I'm sorry. I had to answer that. You can't tell the President of the United States very often that you're returning phone calls. - Are you getting to the point? - Yes. I asked you here to discuss a sensitive matter. It has the name Malcolm Merlyn.
Don't you understand? That was a reality scar that your subconscious was working on. "Reality scar"... What does this funny gun do? Theoretically, it targets irregularities in the hippocampus. Like control-Z for memories.
Grab the lance! Let go of the lance. Then I won't turn you into a jockstrap. Yes! I'd rather not. Give up.
Give up. Sara, why do we always get into this situation? Because you're always on the wrong side. Nice going, Mick. Now give it to me. Mick, no.
There is more. Is it love, Father? Oh, for God's sake, can't you shut up? But yes, the bastard is right. It can only be love. It is something powerful, don't you think, Lord Uhtred?
The problem is, the human life span, it's tiny. That is ridiculous. You are gone too quickly. So what's the answer? Go ahead, find it.
Just do it. Now, Martin, tell me your social security number. What? Your social security number. Tell me.
All clear? Yes! Yeah, I'm all right. It won't explode. The rocket. It won't explode.
Yes! Yes, it's fine. It won't explode. The rocket. It won't explode. It's safe.
Are you prone to nosebleeds? Only when someone hits me. - And how often does that happen? Irritatingly. I ask because you can breathe the air here, but it's very dry. And that's bad for the nasal mucous membranes.
The police are always on people's backs for no good reason. This is not a stop and frisk. This is a psychosexual maniac holding a kidnapped woman, at a yet unidentified location. I tried the last number Decker called. It belonged to a disposable cell phone.
Why? Okay, the milk here, does Ryan always buy the same brand? There's been a new brand in the fridge for a few days. Did you see who put it there? It was there when I woke up yesterday.
- Yes, come here. I don't have any more. So we'll do it without. No, that won't work. It's an old trick, you tried it in your first semester. - Yes, because it works.
I don't have any more. So we'll do it without. No, that won't work. It's an old trick, you tried it in your first semester. - Yes, because it works. - No, it's never worked before.
- That's okay. Nick was there. - Good. I'm glad. Marianne's apartment looks bigger when she spins.
I was so busy trying to find a cure for the city's water problem, I forgot to consider the patch. What are you talking about? A water filtration system is a cure for a problem caused by a virus that is immune to chlorine and UV treatment. That filter is the patch. Even if the Environmental Protection Agency forces the city to start building a plant tomorrow, it won't be operational for years.
Is that fur? Yes, I work in a kennel. Wait, what? Dog kennel? Yes, it's called Chateau Marmutt.
You have hurt yourself very much. More than anyone else. 8-E demands your uncompromising honesty, humility, patience and care. Eddie here. Speak after the beep. Stay close to the light at all times. It will provide you with everything you need. In your own strength, you will not overcome your fear if it allies itself with your pride... or your quiet, dark sides... or your willful denial.
Eddie... My name's not Sam. What are you doing to me? I'm painting flowers on the walls of your ruin. Your necklace... Where is it?
He experiences all firsts with someone else. First kid calls him dad, not mine, who goes to prom, not mine. First kid in college... Well, we're talking about Colt and Heather, I might have another shot at that. Your time with Colt will come, and it will be just as special.
He can't take a joke. Shall we go to the pub? - All right? - How's the marking going? It's going.
- You scared me! - What are you doing on the couch? I wanted to wait for you. That's sweet. I even made you lasagna, but I fell asleep and it burned.
Without Gloria to absorb the hate. Okay, why am I scared? I'm scared. Because every family event that ended with Dad yelling at Mom in a whisper, "Would you calm down?" while she swung her purse around until it popped like a pill piñata, comes to mind again.
I don't think it works. Well, I mean, this is the first time I've seen this watch, but it looks like it's an automatic. - You just move... - Yeah. Your arm to make it run.
- Exactly. - Yes. Check your pocket. No. It can't be. What? My God, she's here!
I look at her, and then I stare at this gigantic engagement ring. You're having these would-be dates, toying around.... What's the difference? You know what it is? This whole situation... It's horrible.
You have these would-be dates, cooing around.... What's the difference? You know what it is? This whole situation... It's horrible. It's stressing me out.
It's about a boy from the city who moves to the country and learns to drive. It was fun. I made up a lot of stuff there, too. - What are you working on right now? - I'm doing a show with Chef Jeff. It's called BFFs.
Her...? Anne. Since your Anne is now a part of our community and you will be raising her, we wanted to invite you to join us. We're meeting this afternoon at the Andrews. Will you be coming? Put your milk next to mine to keep it cold.
Feminism. What an incredible word. How exciting. But what does it mean exactly? I liked the story a lot. It changed my mind about higher education for women.
IF YOU HAVE GREAT THOUGHTS, YOU MUST HAVE GREAT WORDS FOR SLEEPING IN A TREE IN THE SUN OF THE MOON He had a heart attack. A condition called coronary thrombosis. He was lucky it was not fatal. But his condition is extremely precarious.
Come on, I went to your house. All right, Ben. What is it? It's Margaret's birthday... but it was too late to cancel the cake. Everyone saw it was delivered.
And like us, when we catch bacteria, we try to get rid of them as quickly as possible. That's exactly what these animals do. They want to get rid of the algae, which are no longer functional. What is left behind is the transparent, naked tissue. Now they are without their most important food source. They are starving.
They starve to death. During coral bleaching, the flesh becomes transparent. You can see the skeleton underneath. The bright white in the photos are simply the skeletons. If the coral looks very clean and white then it is still alive.
You can see the skeleton underneath. The bright white in the photos are simply the skeletons. If the coral looks very clean and white then it is still alive. It is not allowing anything to grow on it. Normally it doesn't grow anymore, it doesn't reproduce.
I'm not even mad that we're leaving because it's so terrible here. When corals bleach out, die then you lose an animal. It's a shame because it's so beautiful. But a coral is a basic part of a huge ecosystem. In a way, they are like the trees in the forest.
He advises us. He is the most important specialist. The ARD documentary about the Russian whistleblowers... What did you think when you heard the accusations? The documentary was so inflammatory that they were afraid to air it while the whistleblowers were in Russia. So they got them out of Russia, aired the documentary, and it hit like a bomb.
Think Orwell. "Let us meet again where there is no darkness." When I interviewed you a year ago, I asked you if your investigation was a defining moment in sports history. How would you answer that today? It can be a defining moment, and it should be.
And in the list there is also the date of creation. The list comes from the Ministry? Of course. Rebecca, you have the file. Under Properties of the file, you see that it was created on Tuesday, January 21, and it was created by the Ministry.
ADAMS. Everyone should play fair. Explain to us how the sample is taken. The sample is given in front of a doping control officer. It is in this container.
Everyone should play fair. Explain to us how the sample is taken. The sample is given in front of a doping control officer. It is in this container. It is divided.
-So-called Bereg kits? Yes. A company in Switzerland makes them. The Berlinger bottle is state-of-the-art. It is sealed tight and vice-like.
- Thank you, it has a dry marinade. Very good. Julia thinks I should be out there looking for someone to have sex with. She wasn't talking about sex, I'll say that. My school is full of people, loud, and it smells funny. But she has one thing going for her.
Here. Careful, he's hot. Don't let him get you down. The first time always sucks. Mine was on a ping-pong table. It crashed after two seconds.
- I didn't, no. It is a 5000 year old pyramid. There's just one problem with it. One tiny little problem. It wasn't there yesterday.
My glasses are broken. Tell me what you see. A 5,000-year-old pyramid. - What do you know? - It wasn't there yesterday.
The Doomsday Clock. - The what? - Symbolic clock. This represents a countdown of possible global catastrophes. Introduced by some nuclear scientists, in 1947. The closer the clock gets to midnight, the closer we get to global catastrophe. At the moment it stands at three minutes to midnight.
As dead as the moon. - You seem pretty damn calm about it. - Oh, yeah? Oh, sorry. This isn't my first dead planet. Ask for help, and you shall receive it.
It's over. And yet I'm drawn to the case because of the uniquely challenging enemy it represents. How is Frank Trimble a "uniquely challenging enemy"? He isn't. I'm referring to time itself. Compared to other rivals, it's undefeated.
Find out who is responsible for this betrayal. And when you do, do what I taught you... make them pay. For your dear mama. When I first came to this town, not even the clock was working. Now watch it tick, marking every magic second since I arrived.
He brought them here to kill me. I am sorry, but your son cannot be saved. He is evil. This is where she keeps her most precious possessions. If the crystal ball exists, it is here.
All right, I'm confused, but you know what fixes that? The past always catches up with us, doesn't it? Past, present and future are a disaster no matter how you slice it. In my second year of service...there was this guy, Peter Scarelli, raped and killed a 10-year-old girl. We had DNA evidence, but then right before the trial, the DNA sample was compromised in the lab, so it was inadmissible.
Could this equipment be of use to someone outside the clinic? -Not that I know of. -You think it was someone from the clinic? I don't think anything. But I wouldn't be surprised if someone borrowed it.
-I'll show you. You will understand! That is the basic idea. This door here is nuclear-safe. It can withstand 1.2 megatons. It's under the house and can withstand 3 megatons.
Without you, there is no hope for us. Have one! What do you want from me? We saw the sea cat you came with. We think she might rise up against the queen and her troops.
-Call off your lion! -Get out of there. We're leaving. You're not leaving with that blade! It's not yours!
He transforms their quintessence into then become building blocks of new solar systems! Incredible, isn't it? Of course, these are not gentle giants. They're actually dangerous. And that brings us to rule number one. It's enormously important, so remember it.
Now I'm pretty impressed. You just made an incision and sewed it back up? -What was in the syringe? -Phosphalic acid. It's not dangerous, but it hurts like hell.
This anger that he carries around with him is familiar. You mean here? Yes, exactly. Grief gets stuck in your throat and chest and.... Only when you realize that it lets go of you there, can you breathe freely again.
Think in the direction of Eladio Dieste's logic, without thinking of anything in particular, a kind of waveform. DECEMBER It resembles a marble curtain that gives stability to the whole. Almost like a James Turrell. Imagine looking up in an almost transparent, undulating piece of marble. To me, a dome only looks impressive when you're standing under it. It looks beautiful from the outside, too, but it only has that single purpose.
Because of the tight schedule for the Serpentine Pavilion, we have to make decisions quickly. We focused on a few ideas. Then there were only three left, and now there are only two. We finally settled on a wall made of fiberglass blocks. Towards the bottom, it opens up like a zipper. This creates an undulating surface on the outside, like valleys and mountains.
-This is lower. -This fits. It looks good. -The wall certainly looks good, doesn't it? -Yes. And it really fits in very well.
They say they are not responsible for the content of strangers on the site. It is much more complicated than that. The website content affects and hurts and traumatizes many people. When ads with children are shown, customer requests come within seconds. The ad is online when it is confirmed, which takes from 30 seconds to 2 hours.
This is bullshit. I'm sorry to say that Backpage's legal strategy has been very successful. It's a mystery to me why Backpage is still winning. Especially that they are winning big time. Very expensive lawyers dress formally in the first amendment and section 230. The legal strategy is brilliant. It has worked.
I'm sorry to say that Backpage's legal strategy has been very successful. It's a mystery to me why Backpage is still winning. Especially that they are winning big time. Very expensive lawyers dress formally in the First Amendment and Section 230. The legal strategy is brilliant. It has worked. But is it the right one?
And they chose the Internet. ...two important laws collide.... This ruling really infuriates me now because I don't think Congress did this. MARRIAGE OF JOHN MONTGOMERY He was frustrated because he felt the judge didn't understand what he was arguing for. That Ropes Gray lost is really a revelation of how much the justice system has to learn when it comes to child sex trafficking. So his decision wasn't particularly surprising. It was, however, particularly disappointing.
Our primary charges are that Backpage engaged in intentional crimes. They intended to promote sex trafficking? They intended to carry on sex trafficking. But in your indictment you go a little further and say they were engaged in the business of sex trafficking, not just promoting it? Why is that any different than the works of a newspaper when they offer car ads for Washington?
The idea that Backpage caters to the fetishes of older men has nothing to do with minors. I think they can sell that credibly in court. On the stand, you lie for yourself. We'll take them to court and they can tell the story under cross-examination. Let's see if they hold up.
MAIN DONORS The largest donors included Facebook, Microsoft and Google. This means donations from these companies will be used to support Backpage in child sex trafficking cases. Silicon Valley breaks out in a sweat when we talk about changing the CDA. But there are also ways we are hitting child trafficking to the core. The government can't just censor speech that is obnoxious. I LOVE THE AMENDMENT Capital and the lobbies are preventing an amendment even though it is reasonable, as if we have to take the amendment to the altar and ask for forgiveness.
We have missed a hundred years of evolution on planet Earth. A lost century. Enormous progress was made in the 1920s when Nikola Tesla developed technologies for energy generation to supply the earth with the energy that is endlessly and freely available in the so-called "void" around us. However, this "void" is anything but empty. In fact, it is full of energy.

However, this "void" is anything but empty. In fact, it is full of energy. It is not like a still, dry lake, but much more like the foam at the foot of a waterfall.
My head is spinning, I'm confused, and I crack up. Tell me you did it at the palace. - Angie. - So? Robert wanted to keep it a secret, so no. And with Liam, the relationship was over before it started.
- What a surprise. - This is a brazen act of aggression. A crime of opportunity. Petrov thinks the US government is distracted right now. But it isn't.
Benjamin here knows what's coming next. Who cares that he doesn't know Johnny Carson? Poor old Tusk. Despite his poker face, he can't fool me. The future scares the hell out of him because he knows it's short.
You offer a racist gesture and I am forever grateful? - The ban is not sustainable. - What do you want? - His attention. - Have.
And a few others promoted around the same time. Thanks, Cathy. The Brockhart recording... Do you have that? Has it been verified?
- Maybe not. And the gun? That's the thing. It's gone. Maybe a guest took it or someone who works at the hotel.
My husband is waiting for me. - You will look like a fool. - No insults. All witnesses will refute your testimony. My testimony is what it is.
It is about the presidency. There is no higher office. The real power is not here. It is beyond here. It is above, but it is working together with this place.
I always tell myself that everything I did was for that woman. But maybe that's not true. Maybe I love power even more. For you and anyone you hold dear... I could do anything. If my career were of a better sort... ...so that it gave me opportunities for sacrifice... ...I would gladly use them... for you and your loved ones.
Probably because I never went to the big bands. They always looked like this: here the guitarists, there the keyboard, and behind them was a curtain or the name of the band. At the most, there were a few projections. But with pretty much all bands it looked like that. I especially didn't like this shape, because it looked like a hunched back.
How long will they experience this? What will happen next? Everything else is secondary to that. The visible design is only the tip of the iceberg. What matters is the work behind it. It forms the foundation.
My passport is inside. Wait, this guy... he's got my bag. Nice try picking my pocket. I see you've already re-stained it. Cam, it's back on your shoulder!
$12? No wonder the middle class is so angry. There's no way you could follow their story. - Yes, he could. - Good. Tell it again.
Mitchell and I are good contenders for the best costume award in the human/animal category. What are you doing? Comforting myself with food. I've been working on this all morning. And it's for a party tonight. What are a bunch of gays going to do with a cake but stand around and squawk about how pretty it is?
- so I will... - Breathe, breathe. Frank and Lorraine, today is the public and legal joining of your souls, as marriage is first and foremost a contract. One of my favorite authors once wrote, "If love is not everything, it is nothing.
But he asked for a lawyer as soon as he was brought in. Are you familiar with the Freedom Arms .22 belt buckle revolver? It's one of the smallest guns on the market. You think we have trouble finding the gun in the warehouse because it's so small? I don't think it's in the warehouse?
If I'm right, he won't be the last. I'm home! In the study. You were right about Gunther Klecko's gun. It was right where you said it would be.
The medication warded off some of these thoughts, but many still broke through, leaving a void. You couldn't say I have low self-esteem. I don't have any. I'm not built for positive feelings. You could give me a trophy, it would just fall off.
I typed in, "Was slavery..." and automatically appeared, "really as bad as they say?" I swear. Yes. The answer to that question is yes, it was as bad as they say.
Do you actually feel the strings, or do they make you think you're a real boy? Pinocchio. That was my favorite movie as a kid. What was the name of the Kenyan version? No, it was called:
Done. This is the end of Zarkon's reign. Yes, Princess. Prepare my armor. My lord, it has not yet been successfully tested.
Nice of you to drop in. Yeah, I just landed. You look great. I hear the treatment helps. Yeah, it helps.
What have you done... to my future? She just wasn't that into you. - I'm not talking about Rachel. - Oh, the shadow file. Is it on the shelf where you hid the gun I took the clip out of?
Delgado got himself in deep shit. Did you know they were going to kill him? Look, I... I thought they were sending a message. I must admit I didn't think it would be that clear.
Your medicine did not work. But I found another medicine for you. You must explain it to me. I will. But the main thing is that it worked, that you are alive.
-A complete clinic without staff? -The clinic was your project. My project is over. And the clinic... Energy is always constant. It never gets more or less.
I can't say that, Nathaniel. Because I don't want to go back to 1942. I know I'm supposed to go there. I have a purpose, and we shouldn't damage time any further. But I have to believe that time is stronger. And if I have a destiny, that it will be waiting for me.
My favorite show is the meal plan. Do you get the menu beforehand? When's chicken? I'm getting my own women's show. Is it called "You TV"?
Is it called you-TV? To and for you? Women among themselves? Shut up! It's called Profiles.
-Spaghetti ice cream! How do I look? According to the post-story, I should be wearing the vest. What's going on, Russ? You don't like it?
I feel like Jasmine! Not like Aladdin? With all this attention, you must be losing sight of -our- goals. -No! The tigers, of course. No, the sewer rat, it's dying out.
Exactly like this. If any part of the body touches the platform or the water, it's out. You can use the straps on which the mats hang. You can grab it from the second mat, pull it down. Grab the mat, pull it towards you.
All of your victims are connected to the 2014 Eli Kotite trial, so why kill them now? Take a look around you, Mr. Holmes. Do you notice anything? Well, like I said, there's the clock. It runs a full hour every 44 minutes.
Prototypes and optimizations are essential. Only after many versions can something stand on its own two feet. SEATING BENCH FOR ZANAT In the Sinnerlig collection for Ikea, we placed great emphasis on the fact that the furniture pieces would have appeal all over the world. With Ikea products, we tried to understand what mass production even means, rather than directly saying, "How awful!" We tried to question the whole thing. Mass production can have many advantages because it makes certain products affordable for everyone.
But I wanted it to have a unified name. I wanted it to be perceived as an institution. It should be people-oriented and also stand for New York, so it had to be eye-catching and proud. I was flipping through one of my favorite books on American Wood Type. I like this typeface because it's expressive and it comes in many forms.
Graphic designers love history. In art school, Seymour was my design hero. He was about 39 or 40, and I was 21. Seymour was an illustrator, but also a sensational designer. I thought his work was fun, but it was also political.
Well then... I'm no longer the boy in the bubble. Is that good news? It means the half-life of the radiation used to poison you is very short. It was only 24 hours.
And the mayor's office has the statistics. So you know it's working. Emily Grey, Councilmember Slessinger's Chief of Staff. I'll vouch for the fact that the shooting happened where BulletPoint said it did. A little bit further down the block, I found a shell casing. It probably fell out of the vehicle that drove away from the scene.
Emily Grey, Councilmember Slessinger's Chief of Staff. I'll vouch for the fact that the shooting happened where BulletPoint said it did. A little further down the block, I found a shell casing. It probably fell out of the vehicle that drove away from the scene. Its odor confirms that it was fired recently, and the caliber matches that of the system analysis.
Still. Five million dollars? Apparently, it is the perfect mix in terms of origin, quality and legend. She's a 1957 Carfax Desperado, a year of manufacture that's already being called the "Stradivarius of electric guitars," they fetch up to a million dollars on the collector market, and that's without a famous pedigree. If you add to that that it was apparently lost during Mr. Clapton's tour in 1971....
She found editing software that he had installed on his computer. Our technicians are not allowed to install anything on their computers. He must have used it to delete parts of the Azoff shooting. The thing is, the software wasn't installed recently. It had been on there for months, and he didn't just use it to delete things.
Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. And I hope you will not be disappointed when I tell you that it is my wish to stay with the company. That is what I wanted to tell you. Also, I will gladly accept the position of manager. If it is still available.
Because you're the boss and you don't have to get up early. Future or past. We all have to decide at some point in which direction to look. Whether to hang on to the past, sticking with what we already know, or to leave it behind and look to the future. The future can be scary because it's unknown....
We all have to decide at some point in which direction to look. Whether to hang on to the past, sticking with what we already know, or to leave it behind and look to the future. The future can be scary because it's unknown.... Go home. ...But it can also be exciting and make your heart beat in a forgotten way.
That's enough. No need to go into details, dear. We'll talk later. Excuse me, I need to disappear. Can you hide the past just before it would come to light, there's only one thing to do:
I'm going that way. I have to do something too. Bye. Bye. -Greet Pablo. -I will. You may think she can disappear like smoke in the night sky, but it's not that easy.
We commit a crime and I am an accomplice. -It won't always be like this. -That's reassuring. Automation is the future. It will come.
It seems like the end of the world, but it's not. -There are more fish in the sea. -Excuse me? Their relationship was at an end. She had no future.
Let's see how Felipe Camargo finishes the third level. He's at the first bar and already seems to be having problems. The obstacle should play into his hands, as it's the climbing skills that matter here. He has problems reaching the pole. The strategy is good to kick the bar so that it swings closer.
That's determination, Terry. He had to give up. Now he's coming to Faceplant. He says he can visualize the course in his mind's eye and know exactly what he's doing next. My brain injury hurts me a bit because it's hard to track certain aspects of the course. But it also has the advantage that I can interpret the course quickly.
They just kept walking. At some point, a woman came. I was like. "Hey... how much is that bag?" She said, "Oh. It's $800."
I understand that. I just wanted to show mine. I wanted to show my life. The show wasn't called All the Latinos in the World. It was called Cristela.
- And say what? - I don't know. - If I had something useful to show them, it would be.... This new hybrid sample. The other night you said it was the key to solving sterility.
After that, I left the venue. And who was waiting for me outside? My good friend Mick. He's like, "Trevor, how was your show?" "It was terrible, Mick.
Many men here have stories of how they once defeated pussy. Let me tell you, they did not. The owner of the pussy may have given you the impression that she has defeated the pussy, but she is alive and well, my friends. Every time someone says that, I ask, "Do you actually understand how impressive a vagina is? Do you understand how strong it is?"
Do you understand how strong it is?" That's why men have always wanted to suppress it. The vagina is frighteningly powerful. You realize that human beings come out of a vagina. A human being comes out of it, yet it continues to function properly afterwards.
Do you understand how impressive this is? Am I the only one? New York, do you understand? A human being is coming out... out of the vagina. And yet it continues to function and do its job after a human being came out of there.
"You do this to me all the time. What am I supposed to do now? Do you know how much it hurts to have blue balls? What am I supposed to do with them now?" I like it when men talk about erection as if they bought it, with no return policy.
The coefficient is not lambda, it is one by lambda. And over here, consider the possibility that the brain itself can be in different quantum states. And lastly, do you have some crackers for the soup? The spin rate of the vertical centrifuge has to be 4 revolutions per minute. It can't be 4, it has to be 7.
I am not like that. - You won't know until you try it. Try it. Fear excites me. Maybe it will give you pleasure too.
Schwentke? Are you pronouncing that correctly? Listen, Anna, this can either go smoothly or it will be very unpleasant for you. What? - The Schwentke file, where is it?
I watch a lot of police shows. As I said, the van has been in the shop all week. Do you have the name of the garage? I don't know the name. But it's in Manchester, near the airport.
I... He discussed ideas with me. Or scenes when he was stuck. He showed me an early draft of it. A year ago. It wasn't nearly as good.
I did not run after her anymore. I hid myself. - Where's my goodnight kiss, darling? I turned a closet into my reading nook. I crawled under the soft blanket my grandmother had knitted, read my Edward Eager books, and let my hand go wherever it wanted.
But now the noise... It's not out here, it's... So I'm thinking about taking some risks. You know what? I'll play you a song. As unconventional as the whole thing has been, it's taught me respect for love, for its inventiveness, and for the fact that it can't be pigeonholed and made to last forever.
Well, this is where it gets tricky. Do we believe her or not? On the one hand, getting pregnant is a control move straight out of the psychopath textbook. On the other... If her story is true, it means she sent her lesbian lover to Mexico - to get Reid to... - Exactly.
The video is eight and a half minutes long and shows the perpetrator sexually assaulting the victim. The victim is seen crying and asking the perpetrator to stop. The app shows that there were several likes during the livestream. You can see that Marina is laughing during this. She looks back at the camera, almost as if she wants to take a selfie of it.
Where does the streetcar leave from? Either on Flinders Street... It's best to get on at Flinders Street.... - Great. - ...from here. It goes around the CBD.
Watch out! I'll hold it. - Thank you. - I'll save you from the leaves. I want to get my website online and I hope it goes very well.
- You don't have to call it a call girl. - But most people call it that. And John trust me to lead you in the right direction. Some girls just disappear. The porn industry is not for everyone. It can be very dangerous.
To his desire. That doesn't work for me. When I have sex with someone, it's about both of us. When you show sex, it should be based on values, you should feel that the characters feel something for each other. That they respect each other. What I disliked about pornography was that it was usually very badly done.
Do you want to tell me what you're going to do? It's actually quite simple. I'm going to dismantle your organization. NYOOPI is a disgrace to the profession I love. It allows fraudsters and morons to pose as detectives.
It is actually quite simple. I'm going to dismantle your organization. NYOOPI is a disgrace to the profession I love. It allows frauds and morons to pose as detectives. Your group deserves to be exposed as the joke that it is.
Turns out, it was the sound of a perfect hit. They left evidence at the scene. Bloody shoe prints from Carter's door to your trainer's car. Would have made sense to take the murder weapon with the bodies. But you didn't. You threw it 75 yards into that garbage can.
That's pretty impressive. But like I said, it was the worst throw of your life. Both victims' blood and your fingerprints are on it. What happened? Did you think you heard someone coming? Panicked, threw them as far as you could?
The National Enquirer has published a story. A story with a quoted source: Roger Stone. Let me be clear. This story in the National Enquirer is garbage. And it is a smear by Trump and his handlers.
- Why not? - I don't know. It's a rule. Now that I know about the rule, I'll stop. How did you get the list? It's in my back pocket.
That still leaves the question of whether I love Paige. Love? Are you okay? Love is a meaningful feeling. It takes a long time to develop, or it just comes.
You have to open up to us. You know. Just tell us what's going on. It's hard to raise teenagers. Teenagers want to establish independence. And sometimes when they want help, they reject it.
You know. Just tell us what's going on. It's hard to raise teenagers. Teenagers want to establish independence. And sometimes when they want help, they turn it down. And Clay and Hannah both want help sometimes, but they don't know how to ask for it.
-The Zombie Title Hero. I'm not a fucking... I'm Lieutenant Cyril Figgis, LAPD, you walking saps! -I showed you my badge! -And if you show it to me again-- -I'll show it to you! It's not... It was stolen.
Are you ready? One, two... It looks dangerous, but in truth it's no more risky than brushing your teeth. The bullet was never placed in the chamber of the gun, see? It is hidden in the hand and one bullet the wizard has hidden under his tongue.
When I heard that Claude had suffocated, I couldn't believe it. I contacted a police officer and told him that Claude was a master at catching. Even better than myself. I thought that someone must have tampered with the bullet. Sprayed Teflon on it to make it harder to tamper with or poisoned it somehow.
Even the brain of a cockroach has a greater meaning, a purpose on this earth. That goes down to the smallest detail. And I... I just can't imagine that this is just a coincidence. If religion is such a good thing.... Then why is it dividing society?
Breasts have a simplicity that does not exist in gender reassignment. Sex changes scare me because they involve a revolution.... It's like a war in one area. Both the transformation from male to female and the other way around. Why is your experience public? - Why is it happening on stage?
It was a big blow to him. But he was in a car accident three years ago. He couldn't get a transfusion and died. His blood type is MkMk. It is a real blood type, and only about 20 people in Korea have it.
In plastic bags. Typical for pedophiles. A pedophile cannot give up his collection. He can't. Even if he can't get to it, he knows it's there.
"We would appreciate it if Dr. Spitz could accompany us to the crime scene." And what would I do there? Look at the body. I told the police photographer, "Why don't you take a picture of the body as it lies here?
Those were just paper records in a file. So Jane Roe and Jane Doe versus Maskell. Somewhere in the records it says that documents from the excavation.... HOLY-CROSS-FRIEDHOF ...were shown to the judge personally in the judge's chambers. On the file cover it says "With a box of evidence." We would have liked to see these pieces of evidence but they say they have disappeared.
Then why did you buy a green stone that represents August? I have no idea. We know that Sister Cathy wanted to buy her sister a gift. And that a month later you gave this necklace to your wife. Did you show it to Cathy's sister?
I'd rather see the boardwalk destroyed than sold to you! Yeah, how do we know it wasn't you with the pirate attack? Hoho, that's cheeky! So I sabotage my own business the day before I open my new roller coaster? It's called "Blowout Blitz."
Yeah, how do we know it wasn't you with the pirate attack? Hoho, that's cheeky! So I sabotage my own business the day before I open my new roller coaster? It's called "Blowout Blitz." You're gonna love it. It goes up, down, around, everywhere.
Hoho, that's cheeky! So I'm sabotaging my own business the day before I open my new roller coaster? It's called Blowout Blitz. You're gonna love it. It goes up, down, around, everywhere. It even has a loop.
You took the word out of my mouth! Get involved, get a picture of our vision. First, we're building more portholes into this wall. For a lighter, airy feel. Then we thought we could paint this wall a happy color. That it really comes out.
- Look how it sparkles! BOTH: Awesome! In my estimation, that should be enough to rebuild the Promenade. But the holdouts sold the boardwalk to Mr. Monkfish! Oh, what the hell, take it back.
And she made: That always brings people together. But she is right. An abortion kills. Your whole day. It sucks the life out of you.
But I have no intention of creating a place in my payroll for someone whose only skill is crossing boundaries. You mean, after all, since you cross them so well yourself. As I said, Ms. Cromwell, I have a lot to do. Give me a Macallan, neat. The way Lockwood's stock has shot up, why don't you have a double?
How did you get this number? Wait, I'll go to a quiet place. How much quiet does she need? Excuse me. If a number is unknown, does it come from America?
- But do you have to be on the outside? - Excuse me? - For example, this jacket. - What about it? It's warm, light and a little mysterious.
See you at school, Paige. Those butter noodles sound really good. Shut up. I've learned a lot about love this year. It can be complicated.
You don't have to dance either. Okay, some birds dance, and there are some really fun dances. Sorry if I'm harsh, but there are a lot of people out there counting on me. What's your point? I was trying to simplify this girlfriend thing, but it's not easy.
Life in Antarctica can be cold. I was unprofessional and irresponsible. In winter, the ice grows... You mean something to me, not romantically. ...and the continent doubles in size. It doubles. That's how the cold creates matter. It is present and takes up space.
Chapter eight, photosynthesis. Who's looking forward to that? You all read this at home yesterday and.... When a lobster gets too big for its shell, it sheds it. If a snake gets a growth spurt, it sheds its skin.
It's not in the rules. It's all right, isn't it, cat? She ran away. Do you think this cat came to us by chance? Of course it did.
Oh yes, I understand. I'm married... Take all the time in the world. I'm not fond of novelty, but it's a survival strategy. Do you think a bearded seal would live long thinking, "I've never seen that animal before, with the sharp teeth and white fur.
Hi, Sam. This is my sweat jacket. You're wearing my sweat jacket. I got cold in your closet. So I put it on. It's nice and cozy, so I stole it.
They need help. We could send a drone to take a closer look. Good. The energy is neither radioactive nor thermal. It also doesn't generate gravity. And the light radiates out, unlike black holes.
We don't know what's out there. In the past, lightning was believed to come from the arrows of the gods, until proven otherwise. In our quest for knowledge, we are entering dangerous territory. Alfor and Honerva erected a particle barrier around the crater to stop the creatures. But it would not last forever.
- Like some of their students. Sometimes I think what would have become of me if I had not gone to Egypt. - Son, are you all right? Your hand, it's all hot. Jesus, Jesus.
Your mother is a whore. Your father is a liar. And the floors of your house are dust. Your cause is hopeless. Every day and every hour it is hopeless and you know it.
- Because I told him. Dinner's ready. I see you two are getting along. How's the sauce? It's fine.
- There's... It just... It just grazed me a little bit. Can you open the door? Open the door!
Tiny, insignificant specks in an indifferent universe. Yes. They understand. They understand what we want. The world is not as it should be.
It was complicated. Complicated? The dark dimension is unpredictable. Dangerous. What if she absorbed it?
What, like Eldorado? No, gentlemen! No, I call it "Z." The missing piece in the human puzzle. It exists, and we must find it!
Your eyes were hurt. But they say you will see again. What about the other men? - Costin? - He's unharmed. Your brigade suffered heavy losses. But only it did not retreat.
Hi. The evaluation date for your tenured position is Thursday. Great. But I see that you have a letter of recommendation from Dr. Branum at Princeton. Your science department is not what it used to be.
Your science department isn't what it used to be. And I would seek a recommendation from a more prestigious university. More prestigious than Princeton? Yes. Look, I think you're an asset to modern physics, but I'd hate to see you waste your talent.
You said "is coming," so.... - God. Pull... - We're losing time. Pull the door shut, it'll lock.
Yes, it does. I just haven't had the right proximity for it to work yet. Strange value here. Tell us where you got the world's smallest bow tie? It comes with the top.
- Thank you for wishing for it. - I, uh... Why don't I see ghosts flying around everywhere? The barrier stops them. It's the last line of defense between the worlds of the living and the dead.
- It's hard to put them back in. - Not impossible. - That's where the saying comes from. - It's bullshit. Once the cat is out, it won't go back in!
What are "ley lines?" A hidden network of energy lines that run across the earth. It is a flow of supernatural energy. If you take sacred sites and strange events around the world, and connect them with lines where they intersect it is supposedly an unusually powerful place. Abby and I dismissed the theory because it sounded too coincidental to have any value.
Just go down the stairs and take him away. Hey, stop that right now! Turn it off! Ghostbusters. I think it's great that you found a hobby, and I'm sure in theory it sounded great to flood New York with ghosts, but we like the world the way it is.
I see things that no one else sees. And in return I get nothing but scorn and contempt. Fortunately, it is not only me who seeks revenge. Behind it are millions of souls, souls that have been repressed. Souls that see the world as it is: junk.
And she seemed to be in a canoe. You know what? I want to toast. - Here we go. - Here we go. Physics is the study of the motion of bodies in space, and it can unlock the secrets of the universe.
You know what? I want to toast. - Here we go. - Here we go. Physics is the study of the motion of bodies in space, and it can unlock the mysteries of the universe. But it does not answer the question of the meaning of life.
No. Because all these women do nothing but look for a man. Look on the bright side, you can now fully concentrate on your career. What? No! I was ready for that world out there and it just rejected me.
Oh, marriage! No more spontaneous sex, traveling alone and buying whatever you want without asking permission, right? Marriage. Congratulations! Good luck with that. I hope it lasts.
What? It just fell off. I think I'll take it. This place is dangerous. It's perfect.
Fairy Tale Hour Excuse me, the prince. "Then he moved a little closer, kissed her, and said to her..." Well done. How does the story end? I'll tell you how it ends.
I have to defend myself. Things are getting out of hand. That's how it is. Things are getting out of hand. And violence leads to more violence. It leads to nothing.
I would be the only writer who was in a colony and came back with a story that only I can tell. What kind? Humanity flies to the stars, the greatest migration of all time. The greatest story ever. But you don't know the people who read it.
- Come on. Let's get up. Maxchen. You can't deny it feels great. We have to avoid the claw. It drains energy and weakens the suit.
But a promise was fulfilled. A debt paid. - Why don't you go to hell? Oh... Your family was the only heavenly thing you will ever experience. I will expose all your crimes. And burn down what you have created.
Connect... Come on. Shit. Shit. Shit. It's stuck.
But jump out. You are more likely to survive a jump than a fall. Doesn't a fall kill you before impact? Depends on the height and where you land. There's a story... I don't know if it's true. It's about a hitman who eliminated over 30 targets in his short career.
Yes, they know about it. I'm not going to get fired. I'm not losing my benefits. Would you look at the page, please? What do you mean it's not there?
I'm coming over! Derek! Heat is a construct of the mind. Yes. It does not exist.
Great. Tommy likes that. Hey, you idiots! Maybe you'll listen to me now! I've got a bomb in my hand and it's hot!
This is very complicated! I don't know. Everything in the White House should be extraordinary. If we can help American artists, I'm all for it. But the main thing is that they are extraordinary.
I know what you are looking for. Please? A step-by-step description. That is why you're here, isn't it? You want me to describe the sound of the bullet as it struck my husband's skull.
I was afraid for you, I still am, but never thought it was vanity. That's what Jack called all this. When he saw our expenses, he would say, "Your little vanity project is going to wreck the federal government." People need their history, it gives them strength.
And you? Do you think you've done him justice? I think the characters we read about are more real than the people next to us. It was too much to ask to grow old together, to watch our children grow up. The darkness may never go away, but it will gradually subside.
They encouraged us to rise from the ashes as a united people in a united world. There has been no war among nations for 20 years. We have resolved our differences. United, we have rebuilt our families, cities and lives. The fusion of human and alien technology has not only enabled us to defy gravity and travel at incredible speeds, it has finally made our planet safe again.
To all tugs, evasive maneuvers. Back! Back! - Charlie! She's crashing into the base!
This just in from the Hubble. A force is acting on Saturn's rings. Oh, my goodness! What about our defense base there? It's been destroyed.
I'll never come back up. I'll never get up again. And your smile... The sun itself pales with envy and hides behind the clouds. Because it can't shine half as bright.
It's too big, it'll tear you apart! You'd be surprised what fits in there. What's wrong with these two? Or I'll go really wild and stick a tube of toothpaste in it. - Put it over my face.
(Carol) I'm dead serious. Stop it! Hey, idiot, I saw what you did. Stop whispering to the farting cheese lady. Don't make me mad, Clay. She's out.
In fact, there is no one in our Chicago home for the next two weeks. Don't worry. I'll find you. Will you help Santa? Do you know the address where you won't be? Why don't you write it down for Santa?
- I'm Dr. Jones. - What happened? Your wife's mother said a snake came into the house. A... When the paramedics came, it was gone.
Speaking of prophecy. I heard one. Wait a minute. In this prophecy, Petey and I go to the bar and drink more alcohol. And behold, it comes true!
Good God, you're coming with that now? This affair didn't mean anything. And I'm a different person now, too. I'm still the same. And it had meaning for me.
I said you were wrong. Are you suggesting that it's all about inner values? Yes, that's exactly it. Well, I think... if she wasn't beautiful... you wouldn't even look at her. Beauty isn't everything, it's the only thing.
That was under the old prince. He was a man of honor, like Misha and me. But his son, the new prince, is a rotten traitor. He sold the Vory to the state. A huge deal with the Kremlin. When the mafia becomes clean, it becomes respectable, and everyone does business with each other.
- What's the problem? - It's Chinese. Chinese, bro? What does that mean, "Chinese"? It means it's from China.
Likewise. Bashkim told me a little bit about your situation. Yeah, listen. Simply put, we have a weight problem. We ship a large amount of ammunition from Albania to Afghanistan. Right now it is stored in heavy tin containers in wooden crates.
Mm-hm. I love you like crazy, Iz. What happened to your nose? I got kidnapped by Albanian gangsters. - I think it's broken.
We follow the lights along the coast. Just follow the lights. We trust you, Captain. Listen. We're leaving the sea behind. She'll push us toward the coast until we get there.
We all have our reasons for doing crazy, daredevil things. Most of the time it doesn't help. Especially not to get something back under control. But if love is the reason, then it's not so crazy, because people believe in love. It keeps the world going.
Everything is on here again. ED: Okay, good, good, so.... This was all brought to my attention just last week. One of the new bookkeepers stuck her nose in files that were none of her business, and apparently had no idea what she was looking at.
Originally, he just wanted to steal it. And tried to avoid taxes that way, but then he thought of something better. By embezzling his own money, but then putting it back on his balance sheets.... It rains real dough. He goes public. The stock at $8. And a year later, it's trading at 75.
How do I get the part? You get the part because you have something she only dreams of. Passion. Work with it. Feel your anger, your pain, your sadness and your joy and put it into your dance. Live the music. Feel it.
I lost them. It was my fault. Where's your badge? Your badge. It's gone.
- Where are they going? - Charlie, they're leaving. Grab my fin. He's trying to open the door. It's locked from the outside.
I promised him that. Good. Give me your gun. Stand up. Point it at my chest.
I saved you. I was wrong. You are wrong. Love is not a trick. It is real.
Oh, but him. Oh, fuck him, okay? I love you. You think love would be so easy. It could be simple.
They never felt the sun or the rain on their faces. These children were... Disappointments to their families. Their time on this earth was often very short, God willing. When it expired, they were buried, usually in secret.
One call is all it takes and you disappear from the scene forever. No one would miss you. That wasn't my bag. I swear it wasn't. Whose was it?
You did not know. He is promised to another. He does not love her. Their engagement is sealed. It cannot be broken.
- Yes. Tell me your name. Tull. Love is a lie. It is a trick played by the cruel to the foolish and the weak.
This is the way to the Northern Route, which leads directly to the Holy Place. Not only the Huntsmen know that. Hey, Nion, who am I? I talk to the earth. I hear her talking to me.
They could set up camp there. That's where we'll find them. Of course... - Earth is speaking to me again. - What is she saying?
- Watch your feet. - Turn onto your side. Lift it up. The bridge is wobbling. Of course it wobbles.
Have you forgotten those who loved you? Your mothers and father. What law did they break? Love does not make us weak. It is the only thing that ever gave me strength.
When she's right, she's right. It's hot in here. Turn on the air conditioner. Will you turn on the air conditioner? - It stays off!
But that is over. That's why she's thinking about whether to keep it or not. I got this email the other day. I was thinking how to tell you. Here it is.
Mum, I have my daughter now. She looks like she could become a person. What a fear I had! But I look at the lives and stories of others. And I know that everything will be okay. Some don't realize the love they have. Until they see it through the eyes of another.
Few know the whole story. As far as I know, it goes something like this....
I like magic tricks. Keep pointing the gun at him. - I'm aiming right at him. No tricks. Don't show them to me.
If there is trouble in the village, we can let Fort McIntosh know. You'll have to see the preacher. - We have new guests. - They're asking for a place to stay. They shall have it.
Even you have a right to equal treatment, even if that doesn't go through your head. France creates great things, not Austria. Rancid castles and bitter emigrants. Admittedly, it seems to be deadly boring with the Teutons. I am not a rabbit's foot. I chose the revolution because it is the future.
We take everything from them. They look pretty stupid. But I beg you, do not take revenge yourself. The Republic will take care of it and already has. - This morning your nephew took the castle. - Took the castle? Yes. Today it belongs to the people.
- Hurry up. - Yes. You're a hero for confiscating the castle. - It's ours now. - It belongs to the Republic, you see.
You shall flourish in the eons and still please our grandchildren's sons Excuse me, Collot, but we're out of blood sausage. - Maximilien ate it all. - I love blood sausage. - I can't stand chili. - It was... quite strong.
I'll have that lunatic Ignace and that loudmouth beheaded. Tomorrow I'll give their description to the National Guard. There's our Robespierre. What did you think of my blood sausage, citizen? It was awful.
We stretch his hamstrings, Achilles tendons, hip flexors and forearms on the bed.... showing you. He mostly sleeps with the CPAP ventilator. Trevor's routine is extremely important. It cannot be disrupted.
I'll show you. He sleeps with the CPAP ventilator most of the time. Trevor's routine is extremely important. It cannot be disturbed. If it is disturbed, he has a panic attack.
That shit just paralyzes you. Believe me, you don't want that, especially not out there. What if I have the desire not to get killed? It's no use worrying about it. If a bullet gets you, it's already been fired.
The madness swept everyone along. The tension grew, as did the dissatisfaction and frustration. But the real nightmare was just beginning. You don't like to talk about the religious debate. Will it overshadow the US tour?
Excuse me. Are you all right? I'm sorry, I didn't understand you. Language is the foundation of civilization. It binds a people together.
Are you all right? Sorry, I didn't understand you. Language is the foundation of civilization. It binds a people together. It is the first weapon to be used in a conflict.
Do they make conscious decisions or do they act so instinctively that they don't even understand such a question. And most importantly, we need enough common vocabulary to understand their answer. All right. Proceed according to your list. But... don't add anything.
How do they communicate? This is where Louise puts us all to shame. The first breakthrough was the discovery that there is no connection between what a heptapod says and what a heptapod writes. Unlike any written human language, their writing is semasiographic. It conveys a meaning and does not represent sounds.
I read a bit about the theory that when you immerse yourself in a foreign language. The brain rewires itself. Yeah, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. The theory is... Well, it says that the language you speak shapes the way you think.... Yes, it shapes the way we look at things.
We can learn heptapod if we survive. When you learn it, when you really learn it, you perceive time in its own way. You see what's coming. But time doesn't have the same function for them. It's not linear.
Shall we put them on you? Yes. - Yeah. Oh, it looks pretty. Oh, it's coming off.
I have a better idea. Take a look. Troop movements as of this morning. Where did you get that map? I drew it.
She needs your help. Marta, please. Thank you. No. The government is dead and pretending to be alive.
Always be on your toes. Wilkins. Shoulders back. Eyes straight ahead. How's my indomitable machine running? - Well, it... - Silence.
You speak only when you are spoken to. - He was spoken to. - Nonsense. The machine, Wilkins. How's it running?
The crown for Princess Iracebeth. Ignorant peasantry. Silence. What are you doing, you idiot? Put it on my head.
Well, let's go The city looks busy. A bit. My speech. It is too big.
(William) They have no proof to the contrary. Both views require a bit of faith. Certainly, one requires as much attention as the other. So, now the old scripture is your authority on all questions? It may have answers I am looking for.
Surely our resources are better used here, at home. "Your house is the world." We must proclaim so that all have the opportunity to receive the truth. Our message is a worldwide message. It will go powerfully to faraway Oregon, to Europe, Australia, the Sea Islands, to all nations, language and people.
Well, then... (SIGHS) 'just explain to me how, despite multiple surveillance from the air and on the ground throughout the area, they could just disappear unnoticed. I don't. But if he doesn't want you to see them, don't see them. Look, I can tell you this as many times as you want. My story won't change because it's true.
So that's it? What have you got there? An EMP bomb. It took out an S.A.R. unit. It destroys everything around it that has power.
Rose wants to keep all of you. She loves you. Hell, I don't need anybody to tell me my wife loves me. Cory, go in the house and find the other saw. Where is it?
(LAUGHS) You really are the most impossible man, Will Traynor. Then the world will definitely be a better place without me. No. No, it won't.
I see your vagina. Then congratulations and you're welcome. You know, I had it tightened in 2010. It's called vaginoplasty in technical language. It's like a velvet purse now.
And quickly, before the first starve. Who was this acquaintance of Martha's? I don't know her name. I do. Her name is Ellie Briess.
Of course, no one believed me. I knew what people were saying about me. And sometimes I thought maybe they were right. But then I remembered the magic. It changed the way I looked at the world, at the trees, at the sunshine, even the way I looked at you.
- Yes, sir? Would you like to tell the others in the class what exactly requires your undivided attention right now? I'm reading about how an artificial vagina works. Interesting. Please, continue.
So, not a thing, right? We hoped to pique your interest with a discovery that we... My interest is piqued elsewhere: by the Hall-of-Heroes Canteen! Follow me, cadet. It's three floors above us, and it's meatloaf day!
- Drop it! - Put the gun down. - Put it down, Castro! - Drop it! She's down.
- That one right there. - What's the number? 4-5-5-2-3-4-5-B. There is no such number. It's fictitious.
No matter what kind of animal you are, from the biggest elephant.... to our first fox. I beg you, try. Try to make the world a better place. Go within yourselves... ...and realize that change... starts with you. It starts with me.
I ask you: try. Try to make the world a better place. Go within yourselves... and realize that change... starts with you. It starts with me. It starts with each of us.
Dear Dr. Hakem, I hope you are doing well. Thank you once again for removing the cyst so skillfully. Since the surgery, I have become increasingly energetic and have already been able to successfully transfer that energy to others. The catch is that I can no longer blame my problems on it. The growth explained everything, but now it's gone.
Oh. You had a head injury. It was inflicted on you. You were just a little boy. Do you remember that?
Did I have my watch on when they took me to the hospital? No. You didn't have your watch on. It meant a lot to me. It was a gift from my parents.
And something was injected into my bloodstream. And now I have symptoms of a disease. What if...? What if what? Sienna, what if I'm the carrier? Sienna, what if I'm the carrier? If you're infected, so am I... and everyone else we've come in contact with. And we'll probably die.
Thank you. This did not escape my notice. The darkest places in hell... are reserved for those who refuse to act in times of crisis. Dante's hell is no longer fiction. It is prophecy.
Great news. Really great. You might want to turn the lights... ...for the Dante mask. She's barely visible. I know, I'm sorry. The Dante mask is no longer here. It was stolen.
That's not fair somehow. No, it's not. Do you know when the voice is going to speak? Yes, sometimes. And when it speaks, does it feel like it's coming out of you?
Do you know when the voice will speak? Yes, sometimes. And when it speaks, does it feel like it's coming from you? No. More like it's behind me.
And when she speaks, does it feel like she's coming out of you? No. More like she's behind me. Like she's using me. Does she always say something only to you, so that only you can hear it?
No. More like she was behind me. Like she's using me. Is she always saying something only to you, so that only you can hear it? What does she say?
More like she was behind me. Like she's using me. Does she always say something only to you, so that only you can hear it? What is she saying? She says she wants to hurt you.
Like she's using me. Does she always say something only to you, so that only you can hear it? What is she saying? She says she wants to hurt you. When did she say that?
I cannot prevent you from inheriting the family seat. However, I am not interested in punishing you in any way during your lifetime. Father, you know that I... - No, no, let me continue. A permanent union between you and Lady Susan Vernon would destroy everything we have lived for. It would probably be the death of the honest pride with which we have always regarded you.
Don't cry because the oil company didn't lease you land. Who's crying? I don't want Terravex's money anyway. They ruined the town. Like you're old enough to know what it used to be like.
I know I'm new here, but apparently even strangers think you're an asshole. Do you? - Ma'am. You don't know me. But my freshman year, you gave a speech. You called it the "long game."
Thank you. Good. Let's talk about your privacy. What does your privacy mean to you? Because it doesn't seem to mean anything to Owen Case.
This card can crack any system in the world, including ours. They have it, and they'll use it to expose us. Me. Everything we've done. Is it real, Mr. McKinney?
Where's my coat? Walter, for the record: I was never keen on the safe idea. I know where they're going. The next show is by Merritt and it's by the river.
Start with her. Hey! Give it to him. - Danny, give him the card. Just give it to him.
And from her lines I read that she loved you very much. When you were a baby, she noticed that you were special. It was just the two of you against the rest of the world. She writes a lot about you. And about your gift. And how happy she was that she was getting stronger.
Daddy got the best gift ever. Can these things happen? I guess that's up to you, Cody. You have a wonderful gift. Who knows what can happen as it grows.
He predicted it. We demand that the burial chamber be sealed in case his disciples come in the night, steal the body and say that he rose from the dead. That would bring more trouble to the city than all his blasphemies put together. You have your own guard. Secure it yourselves.
Tribune, look at this. My goodness! - Where did he go? - You tell me. The body, was it anointed?
- Sometimes they bury them... - Enough. Enough. Let's not talk about his body anymore. It must be a terrible sight now.
There are no enemies here. Over here! You hold the world in your hands, Beneficiarii. Know. I believe it lies in these men.
What's wrong with you? - You can't do this... Stop! It's finally over. Don't do anything stupid, Todd. Give me the gun back! Come behind and get it, Matt!
- No. He sent a hidden message. He knew only I could hear it. I know where they are. Shots are being fired! Where are they coming from?
I'm going to put the gun down now. You know what that means? It means we're already dead. Over here. Kick it over here.
Here. Thank you. Activate the headset. The left hand activates the drones. Can they do anything else?
No! That's why I was chosen for this job. I hope you're watching, David! Christina, did you break the door? It won't open.
You better get yourself a bad cop... ...because you'd have to fuck me up pretty bad... to get anything out of me. We've got a blackout on the video feed. About 30 seconds till they realize it's not their equipment. What did you do? Turn the sound back on!
What chance do we have against Te Kā? None. We'll never make it to Te Fiti. This mission is cursed. It's not cursed.
Ready. Call. Your watch has stopped. That's a sign. It just needs to be cleaned.
Is on the way. - You'll get it next week. - Okay. Yes, the air here takes some getting used to. It's polluted with feces.
- Yes. - Point taken. - Let's go. Bullshit. Kim, the reason your well story went over well was because it wasn't a boom-boom, it was about women's rights.
- First an analysis. An old man loves a girl. She is only twelve. Since it portrays his perspective, one somehow has sympathy for him. That's amazing, because he's a child molester. But his love for her is beautiful. Basically, it's a trick because it's false.
I'm doing really well. What do we improve? The retreat. Everyone ran for the door, no one ran for the loading dock. They could have stopped us.
Okay, the doctor said to keep you busy. To keep your mind active. So, tell me the story. All the way from the beginning. Again. The story's always the same, Mike. I'm following your trail. It starts with me coming back through one of his portals. God knows where...
It begins with me returning through one of its portals. God knows from where... I find myself in the deepest desert. I have retrieved my car and feel pretty good about being in this insane car. I stay on the back roads by small towns these forgotten places where no one would suspect me. With one eye always looking out for the Spheres and with the other looking out for him. And like all good stories, it starts with a girl.
- Demeter, huh? - My parents were Bulgarians and when they died, Demeter just kept the farm going. I see. So I'm still trying to understand your story. Well, it's complicated.
We take off. The higher card wins. Wins what? If his card is higher than mine, he can go to his poker game. If it's lower, he has to come to the party.
Repeat the time, Wing Commander. 2307 hours, sir. You pick up and write down a message where your wife can read it. It's misinformation that only we have. But it will seem highly explosive and she'll want to pass it on quickly.
She married her way to the top, but she started with us. She became a hood ornament for the most beautiful cars. How long have you been away from her? I know exactly why pretty brats leave their toys behind! Because when a mosquito bites you, it injects an enzyme that other mosquitoes can sense.
(Sophie) "It's the witching hour..." "when the shadow man comes..." "when people disappear." (Sophie) "The home's director thinks the witching hour is at midnight." "The others think it's at 1 or 2 in the morning." "But I think it's at 3 a.m." "That's when I'm the only one still awake."
Too hot! And something else to wear? Where did you get this jacket? Um, from your basket. It's very nice.
We have to stop them! You can't go on like this, BFG! BFG? Where's my warm blanket anyway? I thought you had it. Where is it? Slightly much in my cape somewhere?
I thought you had her. Where is it? Slightly much in my cloak somewhere? - Oh... I may have left it in the land of giants. You think it's in the land of giants?
I'm sorry. What was that about Tara? So the wedding's on? Of course it is. Why do you ask?
And then when he showed up at your house masked Didn't it occur to you that it could be your neighbor? Who could imagine such a thing? - Do you like the color? - Yes, very much. It's perfect.
Stop, stop, stop! Engaged. I think. You think? It's behind the other two discs. Hardly noticeable. But I heard something click, didn't you?
Man... why do you think I stay away? We see ourselves as the United Nations of hotel schools. We believe in providing a global and balanced perspective. You are here because you have a dream. We make that dream a reality. I've seen firsthand how the hotel industry brings infrastructure to communities where it's needed.
What? We can't go now. All my life I wanted to be a newscaster, but I have a very dry mouth. During puberty, my tongue swelled up like a tree trunk. It's still thick.
I can still see his hopeful expression of history before me. And today he has the same expression on his face. I was brave. Maybe my adventure was to have a family. Marriage is not for everyone, but for me it was right.
All right, Glenn. We'll be ready at 4:00. I need to go over the story again. -Why? Because it needs to be edited, for Christ's sake.
No, lose weight already. Pick up. It's about time you called. Sorry, I'm not in, so leave a message. You don't need this here.
And be on tour. What did you expect? I didn't think about it. I didn't know that the band... That it would be successful?
But? I know you. What are you trying to say? Remember mom's saying about opportunities? "Most people miss the opportune time because it comes in a jumpsuit and looks like work."
It's not your fault. Get it out of your head. The world breaks all of us, Travis. It breaks the good, the gentle, the brave. And the ones it doesn't break, it kills.
Remember this. With me is a representative of Detroit's automakers, Mr. Bergen Paulsen. It's good to have you here. You're here for the big show. Go ahead.
The bottom line is, in 5 years at most, we'll all be driving electric cars from Japan. You'll see. Watch this. You know that bad breath tie? Breathe on it.
It's okay, Roscoe, I got you, I got you. Let's get out of here before this damn thing closes again. Charly, grab the other chainsaw. The damn chain broke. - Then forget it!
I'm out. Oh, of course you are. Not everyone can play with the big boys. I'll take that bet. And double it.
A league of furies was born. The women I... we lied to. Deceived. The women we ignored and denigrated. Once the idea is in the world, it is indelible.
I'm tired of it. Don't you get tired of asking? I'll ask until you allow me to. I want to travel far, uncle. Where does the sun rise? Where does it set?
Anyone can sit down there. We saved this city. We should be on the monitor, not in it. Ladies and gentlemen, a year ago, a shadow fell over our city. Suddenly it was besieged by the villain Shredder.
- Well, we have one. - The other. Escaped convicts Bebop and Rocksteady are in police custody, while Dr. Baxter Stockman is still wanted. Authorities assure the city is safe again, though questions remain about last week. What exactly was the threat from the sky and how was it averted?
My condolences, Mr. Taylor, and sorry, but there are certain things that only you can clear up for us. How would you describe your relationship with your stepdaughter? Not so great, to be honest. Honesty is why we're here. Why wasn't she so great, if you know?
Crime number six, he makes an illegal left turn. Crime number seven, he resists arrest. Those are the crimes that were committed by these two young people that night and the only ones we have evidence of. We have no evidence of who committed the crime for which he was charged. The prosecution has presented what they consider to be evidence, but at the end of the day, it's just circumstance and speculation.
It's good for him to have more confidence. And I played some of myself for him, and he was against it. What's up, everybody? Put out an awesome new single. It addresses some social issues that I think are overlooked, so stay tuned.
And I played him some of my stuff, and he was against it. What's up, everybody? Putting out an awesome new single. It addresses some social issues that I think are being overlooked, so stay tuned. Next Thursday at noon it will be released, that's all.
- Sexual freedom for all - As you are, so you are beautiful - Sexual freedom for all, not gay He writes a song for gay marriage. RINGO STARR MUSICIAN As if it were not allowed.
- As you are, so you are beautiful - Sexual freedom for all, not gay He writes a song for gay marriage. RINGO STARR MUSICIAN Like it's not allowed. Now it is allowed.
She looks down at me and says Do violence to this pussy Let it really shred So I went for it And did some crazy stuff It's horrible. Conner's music I don't necessarily listen to in my spare time, but it seems to make so many people money.
- A deed of transfer. It transfers Lallybroch to James Jacob Fraser Murray. Then the property goes to your nephew. This keeps Lallybroch in the family and safe from the Crown, with Jenny and Ian as guardians until the boy is old enough. It is dated last year.
No, no. - Remember the Cant. - You are an OPA terrorist. You were carrying illegal cloaking technology. What was it for?
Why did you go back to Julie Mao's apartment? I'll tell you. Embarrassing... but... I like her shower. It's got great water pressure.
War costs money. And without funds, Charles is powerless. We just have to make sure that his war chest stays empty. Let's hope that the finance minister recognizes a bad investment of money. If the Scottish rebellion is decided in a brothel, it may end up at the French court.
She never has to know. God bless you both. Maybe I can be of service somehow? Your friendship is service enough. You have it.
Good morning! Miesha! This is Gwen's friend, Roger. Welcome. Magic is real. And it exists right here.
Yes. That's wonderful. Your father must be telling the bailout story from the hospital. I love that story. It's so romantic.
I gave Chrissy one for his birthday last year. He never looks at the little ants, but they fascinate me. It's amazing. Leslie. Anyway, the Joey thing could get pretty ugly if not handled properly.
Go back to sleep, buddy! Did you get my card, Dad? Yes, I did. The most beautiful card ever. Did you really like it?
It drips all night long. It has been repaired ten times. You need a new rubber ring. Is that all? Rubber rings wear out over time, that's why they do not keep tight, and water drips into the pool.
What does the truth look like to you? Who murdered the girl? Someone else? Or the guy who has her blood on him, whose fingerprints are all over the place, and who was carrying the murder weapon in his pocket? The truth is for your ass, because it won't help you.
It's a blast. Thank you, brother. To pay homage to this masterpiece, as well as your esteemed presence, it's high time for the Macallan. Neal. Not the bottle from the auction. It's 62 years old!
I know everything, I see everything. But I... I didn't expect to find you. The anomalies of my creations never cease to fascinate me. Jason, you will stand by my side and help me eradicate all the evil of this world until it is perfect again.
The bullet is deep. - It needs stitches. - Yes. But you can't do that here. Clean the wound and put some tape on it.
Is this the only area? - History. Exactly. You don't discuss the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, or the extermination of Jews by the Nazis. Caution. Discussing the truth is one thing, disputing it is another.
Caution. Discussing the truth is one thing, disputing it is something else. When is a truth considered established? That is precisely the question. The problem is not the existence of truth, but the criteria by which it can be established.
She had hoped for true happiness, and this hope made her happy. It was enough for Julie to replace reality with the dream. "This state is sufficient unto itself." That's how great the imagination is. It compensates for the absence, in this case of the loved one, by a purely mental joy that is unreal, but nevertheless effective.
By her own mothers. Cersei has a lot of falseness in her. You know that. But whenever she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines everything. Her love for you is truer than anything else in this world. For she is not of this world.
You know that. But whenever she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines everything. Her love for you is truer than anything else in this world. For she is not of this world. But you know that. You feel it.
Music... Music has always been and will always be my life. Music is important. Bravo! And in this dark period of our history... during the brave struggle of our boys, for nothing less than civilization, it is more important than ever.
You and I agree that love has many forms. Oh. - Rest assured, there is no lack of love between us all. You see, I'm, I'm devoted to Florence, our marriage is.... is platonic. It transcends these realms, it...
That's... that's almost 1,000, ah, 3,000 seats. Well, Lilly Pon's voice filled it and she's just a birdie. Yes, but she's a young woman with a young woman's power and... perfect technique, desw... My technique is not perfect? - Yes, it is, it is, it is, but... it may be too much for you.
Are you going to write something? - Yes. And I mean the truth. Isn't the truth that war veterans are having a good time? Music has a great meaning. It should not be mocked.
I'll make a proper jailbird out of you yet. I said to the barber, "That's not the cut I wanted. I'm not getting up until I get the right cut". Then he asks, "You want a good cut"? The next thing I remember is him coming in with a machete. I swear to God, just acted purely on instinct, you know?
-I'm sorry, sister. I didn't know where to go. -Nurse Julienne is calling the women's shelter. -That's nice of her. They have a place available. It's rather spartan, but cheap.
The positional drainage. Here, the head is lower than the lungs. A simple but effective way to loosen mucus in the lungs. -Does it really have to be? You can also help it along a bit. We call this "percussion." Mr. Phillips, please reconsider radiation for your tumor.
Hey, there's no time for that now! The enemy is still out there! Go! I called in air support. It didn't come.
Here, Fergus. Take the whiskey and the bowl. Clear the altar and put it on top. I'll have to remove the bullet. It's a wonder it's not lodged in the brain.
They want to have a story. Not news. Not the truth. Just a story you want to sell at any cost. Switch off!
The bullet penetrated the skin. I never expected that. That makes two of us. - I was looking for the exit wound, but... - I know. It's still in there. It's still in there.
I would never have expected that. That makes two of us. - I was looking for the exit wound, but... - I know, I know. It's still in there. The bullet made a sound like it was digging into you.
What are you thinking about? I'm not thinking about anything. Is that normal? If you stick to the schedule, it doesn't matter. Every good lie thrives on being close to the truth.
My client was not arrested. I am innocent. What more do you want to know? Say no more. Using luminol, we found traces of blood in Mr. Stokes' shower, even though it was thoroughly cleaned.
You killed a cop! I know it was you. Now the police are frisking kids. What are you doing to my town? You don't own it.
The garbage bag is for the clothes you're wearing. Every shred goes in there. Even the jewelry. Spurlock burns everything. Every good lie thrives on being close to the truth.
Especially if you want to kill someone. Your friend Zip and his two buddies are dead. That's not Cage's style... I guess Shades didn't like you taking him out. You know when a rattlesnake is most dangerous, Domingo? When it's cornered.
This is Farah. She's with us. Hey. All right, we need to find the isolation unit. It's at the other end of the facility.
You can see where I work. You know what? You want to search my place, go ahead. What do I care? It's clean.
You have your cat? Do you want her? I don't want it. - Then why do you have it? - Why? Is she proof?
Do you see what I mean? I don't think I do. You stab someone with a knife. Sometimes so deep that it hits the bone. causing your hand to slip on the edge. But it only slips once, even though you stabbed it 22 times.
I'm out. - I no longer sell to my customers. - But your country? We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't think we were in danger. You talk about free Internet, saving the world. But that only makes it more dangerous.
See that you are equipped. - Yes? - You should know something about Deep Dream. I need assurances... that I have your support. You do.
You don't have much time. No one will know where it came from. I have plenty of time. When Kalloor is done, I'll put my left hand down. Shoot.
- Do you believe in magic, boy? - Of course not. Well, your father had magic in him. And you have it in you, too. It flows through the Shannara blood.
But your personal card is the Diamond King. - Nothing else? - What do you mean? You didn't say anything about the card. - Who does it show?
- But your personal card is the Diamond King. - Nothing else? - What do you mean? - You didn't say anything about the card. - Who does it show?
In the living room. At the foot of the statue. - The combination? - You should know it. It is known only to him and you.
Excuse me, I'll bring them back to you later. I didn't mean it that way. I just wanted to know if you liked it. Very much. It's just wonderful.
Only vegetables. Three times? You know, our supplies... - Yes, yes, that's all right. The soup is boiled until it is absolutely germ-free.
So please gather information about this creature and design an adequate strategy for each option, capture, destroy or chase. Now which agency was that directed to? The water vapor cloud is moving toward Tamagawa. It's moving? - It's coming from a living creature.
A day or two ago? Maybe you should take a nap. N.A.S.A. pilots who slept 40 minutes increased their alertness by 54%. - Is that a fact? - Yes. Well, take your fact and stick it in....
I suppose you could have met in a restaurant. Professionally, I haven't found anything. Maybe in prison? Has the list of prisoners he was receiving come in yet? They called 30 minutes ago, said it'd be ready in an hour.
- It has nothing to do with you. - So it has to do with me? I think I'll get something from the bar. - It's not open. - Of course it is.
I bet you told her and then your relationship quickly became physical, huh? You wanted Alice, she wanted the cabin. She used you like she used Joe Harris. State troopers are at the cabin. Nobody's there, but it's fully stocked, like two people want to stay there for a while.
Don't come any closer. I'm not sure it's safe. I, uh... stepped on one. I'm standing on a landmine. Normally, when you step on a landmine, it explodes in seconds, but we think Korsak stepped on its edge and it popped up, and that's why he saw it.
I'm not sure if it's safe. I, uh... stepped on one. I'm standing on a landmine. Normally, when you step on a landmine, it explodes in seconds, but we think Korsak stepped on its edge and it popped up and that's why he saw it. Well, if it didn't explode, can't you just step back down?
I... stepped on one. I'm standing on a landmine. Normally, when you step on a landmine, it explodes in seconds, but we think Korsak stepped on its edge and it popped up, and that's why he saw it. Well, if it didn't explode, can't you just go back down? We can't risk her sliding back down and activating the pressure plate.
This will be a great help. - What is it? - Favors worth a lifetime. What do you want to do with the bomb? Protocol is to detonate it on site, which we will do once the sergeant is secure.
From Buddy Jepsen. Our operator in Sacramento. I know Buddy Jepsen well. He has received a delivery. It has arrived!
There is no better offer. Let's ride the wave of freedom instead of being drowned by it. Here is a parting gift for our guests. Give freedom a chance. It might taste as good as what you have known so far.
But not in this city. You... lost them? - Yes, father. - It's a castle. Not a cursed sheep. I take it you remember where it is?
And without you, all this would be in vain. Stand at the head of our army, where you belong, where Father wanted you to be. Show our men where their loyalties lie. Show them who the Lannisters are and what we do to our enemies. Take back this stupid castle because it's ours and because you can.
The city has come back to life. -You make a pact with fanatics -and it works If you shear your beard with a sharp blade, the blade works. That doesn't mean it won't cut your neck.
What if everyone starts demanding their independence? It does not demand, it asks. The others are also allowed to ask. Our fathers were bad men, of all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it.
You know the palace. There are miles of tunnels down below. It's where no one would look. There are rumors of a chamber beneath the dungeons. Some servants say it's cursed.
We cannot trust him. But he knows these woods. With him, we could find Eretria. We were taught that humans were warmongers who wanted to destroy the world. But humanity was more than that. It was inquisitive and compassionate. Even ingenious.
They will find you! And if we are not prepared, they will kill me and take your other eye. What do we do now? We must track down the armor. Only it can protect you fully.
It is pathetic what happened to my sister. I looked up to her, she was so strong. And love has made her weak. No! It made me stronger.
That would be a nice ending to my story. Your story will never end. He will spread it and then those to whom he told it. And then those who heard it from those. And then again the people who heard it from those.
- And his betrayal? - He betrayed you, but... - But? - The port thing isn't important. Of course it is.
- Oh, Maman, stop it. He always keeps his problems to himself. He always has. But syringomyelia must be treatable. Whether it's associated with a Chiari malformation or not.
This is our home now, Lincoln. We fought for it. Too many of our friends have died for it. On the ark, the uniform meant something different. Down here, it means what we decide it means together.
There is hope. Okay. My necklace. The one you gave me on our first anniversary. It's on the nightstand.
I feel it. A lot of it. Regret is progress. Regret is huge. Is it?
Thrown him off the roof? I don't know. My parents were in evening clothes. It was cold and wet. They grabbed my mother's pearl necklace; it broke.
The theft at the art museum, the bomb at the train station, the tip-off to IA, Pinkney's murder... all part of an elaborate plan. So he's intelligent, meticulous, has technical skills and the accesses. - An active cop? - He has to be. That's the only way he could have access to the crowbar after it was seized as evidence.
Before they put you in that hole, I told you something as a friend, remember? You can still run away. Go to an island, buy a banana boat, grow a beard, find Lee, have a life. I've been working on this thing since you left. And I'm not saying it's hopeless.
It is the same. But still beats my whore mother's goulash, no? Where are the children? Ring the bell again. I doubt they'll hear it.
Remember? When you were assigned the Wayne case. I know what it means to you. You think if you can solve it, you can close the door on the past. And maybe, just maybe, it'll stay closed.
That's not much good, bringing back the dead when they come back crazy. Oh, he's not crazy. He just doesn't know who he is. His psyche can't come to terms with being brought back by the dead. It's broken, grasping at fragmented memories.
Really? I saw him last night. That's impossible. This is a court order signed by District Attorney Dent to exhume Fries' body. Where is it buried?
Imagine that I am God. Almighty. I am God and I am redeeming you from all your guilt. I have imposed this debt on you, and now... I take it away. It is gone.
Just the right amount of oil. Thanks. And you could serve this pasta at any high-end restaurant, even on the Sunset Strip. - Yeah. This pasta is called "farfalle." They look like a butterfly.
And you could serve that pasta at any high-end restaurant, including on the Sunset Strip. - Right. This pasta is called "farfalle." They look like a butterfly. I know. And above all, they're just quite irresistibly greasy.
Just don't become a hot-shower lacrosse player. Honey, we invented lacrosse. That's probably not true. This sacred whistle, the chanunpa, was carved nine generations ago. It survived wounded knees. We used it to pray for our brothers in Vietnam.
Thank you. I'm sorry. I didn't know that our series didn't meet your expectations. We're doing a good show, but I just mean.... It could be great, right?
Ichiro Hiruma's intervention is based on a subspecies of the twitch fly. This particular species lives in Central Africa. It has a remarkable characteristic, it does not die. If this mosquito enters a state of acute water shortage, it enters a protective state called cryptobiosis. At 200 degrees Celsius it survives for five minutes, as well as at -270 degrees.
It has a remarkable property, it does not die. If this mosquito enters the state of acute water shortage, it falls into the protective state of so-called cryptobiosis. At 200 degrees Celsius it survives for five minutes, likewise at -270 degrees. In ethanol, it survives for a full 168 hours. Even at a radiation of 7,000 gray or in a complete vacuum, it does not perish.
If this mosquito enters a state of acute water shortage, it falls into the protective state of cryptobiosis. At 200 degrees Celsius it survives for five minutes, likewise at -270 degrees. In ethanol, it survives for a full 168 hours. Even at a radiation of 7,000 gray or in a complete vacuum, it does not perish. As soon as it comes into contact with water, it returns to its normal state.
- I have a few useful apps. - Namely? My diary. April 14, arrivals hall, passport control. The line is... lethargic. She is apathetic, dazed, moribund.
Why do all these women weigh over 150 kg? Secondly, why has this never happened to a woman in Ethiopia? The Diablo Blanco disaster is, of course, a reality. And it is spreading.
Sure, but his fans must just think that. Should we hack his PC and destroy the files? No, that would only confirm that he should be stopped. The conspiracy theories would flourish. We have to control the news somehow. We have to get to his computer and send the misinformation from there to make it look real.
I'm sure she's just enjoying her free time. Yes. Wyatt's men... they used to whisper. They said this world didn't belong to the old settlers or the new. That it belonged to something yet to come ... that it belonged to him.
Nothing will change that. But be careful, don't get too friendly with anyone. That never ends well. Because basically the past doesn't want to be changed. Sometimes you can feel how it resists.
Single shot, bolt. Simple, effective, reliable. Shoots NATO standard cartridges, very effective at soft targets... in weak cover, behind cars, narrow trees or similar. As always, I filed out the serial number. But if you don't file deep enough, it will show up again with acid.
So how can this be? My client cannot answer this question. After all, he is not a forensic scientist. Who knows? Maybe it fell out of a bird's beak.
All right, wrap him up in his space blanket right now. - I already did. - Put another one on him. Make him some tea. Or better yet, hot chicken broth. - Let it simmer, not boil.
I screwed up completely. And then I gave... And then I blamed you for it. It's that goddamn electricity! It's killing me.
Musical matter. You said that Mother Hildegarde knows something about music. I was hoping... I wonder if there is something strange about this music. About the way it's written.
By the way it is written. Can I be sure that what they are doing is neither illegal nor dangerous? I assure you that when my husband asks for something, he does it for good reasons. This is the basic melody. It repeats itself in different variations.
Then only... we will meet again. If the wine sale is successful and the prince finds more backers, he will sail straight to Scotland. Then it's simple: Charles must not get the money. We must make the shipment disappear before it is sold.
White heat burned deep in my bones. I knew what it was. Puerperal fever. The child was born, but part of the placenta remained inside me. It was now rotting in my womb. But as Raymond moved his hands over the meridians of my body, I felt the bacteria in my blood dying,
His Majesty is a mercurial man. Such a request will have its price. What is that? The King will expect to attend you. If I have to sacrifice my virtue, mother, it is just another one I will lose in Paris.
Fight, and we must win. We are very fortunate to have such a close confidant of the Prince among us. Isn't that right, Lovat? We are fortunate to have someone who can give us an inside view of this sacred rebellion. Aye, but I didn't know how sacred it was.
The French have already supported us, Colum, by attacking the British army in Flanders, reducing the remaining troops here at home. The Prince is sure the French will want to take advantage, sending men and artillery to support the Jacobites. Ah, so the French haven't committed to Prince Charles yet? Always an unreliable ally, the French. We will welcome French support when it comes, but we do not need it.
Means that the British see Prince Charles as a real threat. Will you join us, cousin? Maybe the Brits, like the rest of us, know how many canaillas there are among the Campbells and Camerons men who would sell their own grandmothers, for half that amount. Aye. - Well. - For £30,000 the British could end this rebellion before it even starts. So much less than what it would cost them to fight a war.
Enough war talk tonight. You know, I got the impression that Colum was trying to use you to convince Lord Lovat not to join the rebellion. Aye. The first Jacobite rebellion failed, and Colum will never support another one. He wants Lovat's clan to remain neutral to the MacKenzies, knowing that the smaller clans will follow, and the rebellion will collapse before it even starts.
Even as a young lad, you had the kindest heart, sir. But I'm afraid the time for talk is over. We have sailed from France to fight a war. Let us fight it... and end it. I will not risk the destruction of our army... by ordering it to cross potentially lethal ground.
- Wonderful. - Yes. Well, then I hope you will be called to the stage. In fact, that's guaranteed. My supreme has taken my card... she's enchanted.
If she does nothing... - they'll think we're hiding something. - Is she staying at the ranch? I don't know, sir. Keep an eye on her. Visitors, names, times. The color of her poop and how she smells.
We kept quiet about something we hoped to keep secret. But in light of the tall tales we've told in recent days... ...about the state of our marriage, we now feel compelled... ...to share this unpleasant news. Claire. For the past three years, my mother has been suffering... ...from periodic lymphoma. At first, she successfully battled her disease... ...but in the last few months, it has returned in a massive way.
- Super. That really hit home. I know. I'm sorry. It's just, Laird... It's just, Laird... Your relationship with Miss Stephanie is special. She's the one.
Then he knows his way around weapons. Like a dog knows his own ass. Hey, why do I get the feeling I'm being recruited here? Like-minded people need to stick together if they're going to pursue the hope of changing the world. So, I guess the world is what it is, with or without Hap Collins.
I injected you with something that immobilizes your body. I had to get that out so I could hand you over to them personally. They'll be grateful. They'll give me protection against the plague. It's coming, you know. In a few days.
- Can you control the power from here? - The core? Yes. Question. If you turn this thing on, what happens to the machine? Well, it would overload.
Finding strength in whatever you think are the things that make you weak. You know the difference between right and wrong. That's at the heart of all superhero stories. I think you're meant to be a hero. If you look at our world, you see that it's unpredictable, but I think it's gotten scarier lately.
Shit! Water is included, electricity is extra. Take your time. The apartment would be great for you. It's too expensive.
When you need to do laundry.... In the closet next to the kitchen. Yes. This place is really nice. - Yeah, it is. I still have to get used to it, but I like it.
Isn't it? But about our tuxedo wearer, I'd like to question her. Let's see if she knows who tried to weigh him down with an ounce of lead. I found it over there by the table. -Is it hers?
Young urban women. Well put. I'll try. You see, I understand. Love is passion, it's fleeting, it causes worry.
- It is ajar because it no longer closes. Already not for years. The rust on the latch indicates that. And this? The front door, which does lock, but the detective at the scene noted that it was unlocked, as was a second floor window on the garden side.
It is not dead. Nurse. Should saline really be given for a heart attack? Agent Scully, we checked her mother's living will, and it says she does not want resuscitation if she is unconscious or needs artificial respiration. She amended it last year.
Nurse? Should saline really be given for heart attacks? Agent Scully, we reviewed her mother's living will, and it says she does not want resuscitation if she is unconscious or needs artificial respiration. She amended it last year. It was witnessed by two retired naval officers.
And she was bitten, by a tick! She had a bad allergic reaction, so with swelling, vomiting and so. And these swollen ankles, horrible. Yeah, you... You should have seen the size of that tick. (LAUGHS) It was loose... [STAMMERS] It was normal-sized.
Alex. - Your sister. - I don't have a sister. Kera, you are suffering from the effects of a creature called Black Mercy. In order for you to be incapacitated on Earth, it creates this illusion.
But then I always woke up and the voice started all over again. So I ran away. Crossed the sparkling sea. And when I finally set my foot on solid ground again, the first thing I heard was that damn voice. Do you know what it said?
So I ran away. Crossed the sparkling sea. And when I finally set foot on solid ground again, the first thing I heard was that damn voice. You know what she said? She said...
And when I finally set my foot on solid ground again, the first thing I heard was that damn voice. You know what she said? She said. I'm sorry, would you excuse me, please? All right, Maeve, what did she say?
Do you know what she said? She said... I'm sorry, would you excuse me? All right, Maeve, what did she say? She said, "This is the new world.
Confirm. Yes. You should get back, Dolores, before someone misses you. And when I finally set foot on solid ground again, the first thing I heard was that damn voice. It had followed me all the way over here.
Yes. You should get back, Dolores, before someone misses you. And when I finally set foot on solid ground again, the first thing I heard was that damn voice. It had followed me all the way over here. You know what it said?
It's boring. Daddy said we can do whatever we want. My father always said that only boring people are bored. Mine did too. I always thought it was only boring people who didn't feel boredom, couldn't imagine it in others.
What? It doesn't fit. Why would he keep it? When he kills Allen in L.A., he's gonna throw the gun away, down a storm drain. Maybe it was a gift from his mama, who knows?
Maybe you will be lucky in gambling. Do you like blackjack? And what do you get? Another gun. It's in there, isn't it?
Yes. I know the drill. Thanks. Yeah, just in case you're tempted... Last night's gun has your prints on it. - The hell they are! They're not.
The girl is religious. I have something else. Do you recognize this church? Yes. This is the Surp Zoravor Church in Yerevan. It is one of the oldest churches in Armenia.
And take his money with him. - She didn't care about the others because it wasn't serious. Marriage is serious? - Like a heart attack, buddy. That's exactly what it is, a heart attack.
Savage's. That's why he wants us both dead. My theory is that the three of you were exposed to the same radiation from meteorites. We all share the same power. And every time he kills you, it passes on to him.
Sorry to interrupt your family time, but we were hoping you could tell us a little more about Savage's current whereabouts. He hides in the shadows, never attracting too much attention, but in every lifetime, he brought himself close to power to sow seeds of destruction. Who remembers the name of the man who whispered in the ear of Gavrilo Princip and convinced him to start the First World War? Why? What did he get out of it? The more the world is busy destroying itself, the less it notices an immortal psychopath in its midst.
One of the basic rules of time travel is that many things cannot be changed. Time wants to happen. Chronos, and even Vandal, will not be the only opponents we face. Very often it will be time itself. Whether it wants to happen or not, we will change time, erase Savage's future, and earn our rightful place in history.
Yes. You're going to so regret getting in my way in a few minutes. Yeah, you will. You see, Rick, whatever you do, no matter what, you don't mess with the New World Order. And this is the new world order, and it's really very simple.
-Joyce. The one! Joyce, we're in Hawkins, okay? What was the worst incident in the four years I've worked here? An owl attacked Eleanor Gillespie's head because she thought her hair was a nest.
"Shadow Valley is a dimension that is a somber reflection or echo of our world. A place of decay and death." "A displaced plane. A world full of monsters. It's right next to you, but you can't see it."
If it were, we would know it. It would affect gravity, the magnetic field, our environment. Man, it could swallow us whole. Science is a great thing. But I'm afraid it's also ruthless.
We have searched. He's not in the apartment. You haven't found him, but he can be there. There's a daughter. She looks like Jocelyn.
You're just listening to the wrong voice. You've tuned in to the one yelling at you over the loudspeakers that you're fucking stupid and your performance sucks. And you ignore the quiet one inside that tells you who the alpha is. So, that's the voice that got you here. And it's still there, if you're willing to listen.
Listen, she has to get out of here. I tried, but she's... She's in shock. And I don't think that's her e-mail. Oh, yes, it is.
- Yes. Show me your face. You have to meet me in person to see my face. Show me your pussy. Move it closer to the screen.
I know this is very personal. And you may be uncomfortable sharing it with others. But look around you. The Bronx is a war zone. Our community is dying. Only leaders can save it.
No one is going to run. - Shao didn't know. - Fuck you. Close this thing up. If the body's found anywhere but in that trunk, Cadillac will make sure we all end up in there next. What if they find the cops?
Hey. Gracias. Climb the ladder To the roof Where we can be Where we can be Closer to heaven We laugh and I'll tell you The story of love What it's like And what happiness lies in it Baby Clear as day Dark as night
It's about the music. - I know. - No, you don't. Music is the only reason. It will move you forward and open doors that everyone says are closed.
He scratched it. That's the art. We can scratch it without damaging the record. I would never allow anyone to damage your beautiful record. - Did you really like it?
How is that supposed to help us? I had imagined a number. And it was definitely not 32. - Well, I... - It was clearly smaller than 32.
- What are you talking about? - That was an emotional affair! That hurts me just as much as a physical one. What is she talking about? She means that intimacy remains intimacy, whether it's physical or emotional.
To protect it from vandalism. Someone thought that would be a good explanation. When word gets out that a property is vacant.... - Robert. - ...it becomes a public toilet.
Dad, don't forget to take the boys to school. - Sure! - You guys must be excited. You're moving to LA to host your own show. What's it called?
You instructed me not to do this. Good. I brought you a present. I used to read this story to my son at night. I thought you might like it.
Quality Assurance will handle events like this from now on. Will that be a problem, Bernard? We all have a lot of work to do. If your people want to take it on, fine. Just get us a copy of the autopsy when it's done.
You killed my wife, massively trimmed my family tree - all in search of some goddamn maze. What the hell are you hoping to find anyway? This whole world is a story. I've read every page but the last. I need to find out how it ends.
What's your interest in this? Have you ever heard of a man named Arnold? You might say he was the first settler of these lands. He created a world where you can do whatever you want, except for one thing.... you can't die. That is, no matter how real this world seems, it is still just a game.
He ran. Never did a thing look so beautiful as the old running dog. Finally, he caught it. And to everyone's horror, he killed that little cat. Tore it to pieces.
It was a purposeful cut. Almost as if they were looking for something. Are you kidding me? You really think this little fuck doll is coming to get you? - Huh? - She got off the table and ran.
You shoot an unarmed man, and now you feel bad because you can't call yourself the hero. Do you still not understand? There are no heroes or villains. It's just a giant ... circle-wank. I think this philosophy says a lot more about you than it does about the world.
Had no idea this was here. The house must have been built on top. But this equipment. It's newer. Slower than our machines at Mesa, but... she'll have a host ready in a few days.
My colleague Inspector Bercaro. - Good afternoon. We are investigating an incident that happened last night here in the neighborhood. Your security camera facing the street, was it on yesterday? - It's always filming.
They are very beautiful. A message from Isadora. Will you read it? And? What does she write?
Thanks, mom. - Shall I fry the sausage? - Yeah, nice and dark. - What? - Yes, fry it properly.
These fools are not as resilient as you. But I think they got it better. So you want me to work for you because my life sucks and I haven't finished it yet? You know what makes us unhappy? The expectation that the world is different than it is.
But I think they got it better. So you want me to work for you because my life sucks and I haven't finished it yet? You know what makes us unhappy? The expectation that the world is different than it is. - And what is it like?
We'd best go this way. - It's heavy. - Yeah. Could we put it down? If we take the drawers out, I'm sure it'll be lighter.
Big Star defends title as Memphis' best new band By Joni Conway His pump is broken. He's got bigger problems than a pool pump. - How's your shoulder? - It hurts.
Doesn't the war cost enough? We avoid further unrest among the population. What do you say, Tréville? The people expect the quarterly support. It has always been a gesture of royal goodwill. But...
But suffering makes us stronger. You have always had something of the Old Testament about you, Grimaud. Your work is not yet done. It shouldn't take long... And if you want it to be completed and everyone to be satisfied, I advise you to let me take the medicine.
Is she in there? Blair, open the door. Okay, okay. Please. It's locked.
-These are just the new guys, The leader is already taking care of it. Stop! Here in Gudbjerg you will become part of a community. And if you do not respect this community, it will punish you.
I'm a racer, but this little guy makes me nervous. Aunt Becky, do you have a minute? Hold on a second. The baby fashion show is about to start. It's called "A Day in the Life of Tommy Fuller."
You are the best brother ever! Sorry, there was a little misunderstanding. Max! The message wasn't for you. It was for Lola.
It was crazy. - It's not bad. - As always, please. - The show today was great. - It wasn't.
My source at the police department called it the Tug Show. - He said that? And how did you get involved? This thing with the police? Officer Jimmy Suskind comes in with a broken-down police car, then fiddles with his gun, says it doesn't shoot right.
Honey, you have no idea. Agent Carter, everyone fall in. That means watch the phones. Howard, you're asking me to become a traitor to prove you're not. You want a mission of importance? This is it.
Thanks for coming, Jake. Daddy, how's town? Pretty good. Marriage is an institution of the highest importance. It is cherished by couples who want to provide for each other for a lifetime.
They are now with the police. Soon the police will also have the videos from the surveillance cameras. But we already know that the dead man is Sharif Zamani. May I see the message? I suspect it is not as incomplete and deleted as you claimed yesterday.
I can't get any more power. You know what she needs to stop him, Abbie. You're resisting. You're holding on to hope. You hunger for the light inside you.
You are holding on to hope. She hungers for the light within you. She needs a means to bind the darkness, Abbie. He regains his strength. She needs the peace of your immortal soul.
Yes. Let her speak to you. Give her your strength. Give her your hope. Give her your life.
Okay, okay. Saldana, why are we still tied to these hospitals? Baby boomers. They get old, then they get sick. When the association reports patient numbers, they exceed stock market expectations.
-Andri. Is it true that you released Hjörtur? Yes. No, there's just the matter of the Lithuanian... -I was hoping it could be settled quickly. -Yes.
- The case, perhaps, but the brain inside can only take a little blunt force trauma, like us. Sorry, I was short on Kevlar. Damage to a single bit of the machine's code, now in a compressed state, would be equivalent to losing terabytes of data. Irretrievable, unrecoverable. It's running on lithium-ion reserve now, but if the light starts flashing, we're in big trouble.
Don't worry, we will find Root. She'll help you get them working again. Then we'll get Shaw back, start working with the numbers again. Mr. Reese, we don't know if the machine is the same as before. She could be fatally injured.
A supercomputer that can think 100,000 times faster than the smartest human is automatically a potential threat. If it surpasses us, we would be fools to think we could control it. If an uncontrolled artificial superintelligence ever saw us as a threat.... it could lead to the extinction of mankind. Take it easy, Professor Doomsayer. Why do you assume it could be hostile?
If he has surpassed us, we would be fools to think we could control him. If an uncontrolled artificial superintelligence ever saw us as a threat... it could lead to the extinction of mankind. Take it easy, Professor Doomsayer. Why do you assume it could be hostile? She could be friendly.
If an uncontrolled artificial superintelligence ever saw us as a threat... it could lead to the extinction of mankind. Take it easy, Professor Doomsayer. What makes you think it could be hostile? She could be friendly. Hell, if she has even the slightest sense of compassion, she could cure cancer, solve the problem of global warming.
Take it easy, Professor Doomsayer. Why do you assume she could be hostile? She could be friendly. Hell, if she has even the slightest sense of compassion, she could cure cancer, solve the problem of global warming. - She could eliminate poverty with ease.
Why do you assume that she could be hostile? She could be friendly. Hell, if she has even the slightest sense of compassion, she could cure cancer, solve the problem of global warming. - She could eliminate poverty with ease. - Or it could do just the opposite.
I think you just found one. I always knew you had a soft spot for me. There's no God mode anymore. The machine is shut down, completely shut down. She is our only hope.
- Okay. Search for enemy combatants. Harold, what happened? - I failed. I never gave it a chance. If I hadn't crippled the machine from the start, it might have stood a chance against Samaritan.
If I hadn't crippled the machine from the start, it might have stood a chance against Samaritan. What about the RAM modules? Is all the data gone? The battery is dead. It has no power supply.
But most of all, you are my husband. In Afghanistan, I was briefed before a mission. And Sharif Zamani was listed as a high-value target, along with two others. The message I got did not come from the armed forces or intelligence. It came from someone who hacked the system and who chose me....
You want to use a bomb and trigger an international incident. - Do you want to venture a guess as to the target? - The Russian consulate. Quick and accurate. Impressive. Your former employer won't be able to detect the bomb until it's in place.
Like it or not, Harry, she's your child. And she will die... unknown, unlamented. She'll just disappear without a trace. And you couldn't even give her a real voice to ask you if that's how she wants to end up. I didn't give the machine a name because... I thought that one day... it might give itself one.
- That requires your voice. - Do you think the machine can't imitate my voice? I'm sure it can. But does your machine know the password? Or more importantly, does it know what will happen when the virus circulates?
Or more importantly, does she know what will happen when the virus is in circulation? Have you told her the truth, Harold? That it might destroy Samaritan, but it would also kill your machine. I'm sure the machine has already suspected that. And it understands that some sacrifice is as inevitable as it is necessary.
A modem? A WLAN modem, here. That's an impressive portent. Why does the machine show us something that we can also get at "Target"? Maybe because it needs something here, not outside.
-First him, then me. It often happens that great powers finance guerrilla soldiers. Then war breaks out and tens of thousands die. The great power didn't think of that. He retreats and I advance. -And then the Great Power is out? -No, it just changes clothes.
And in that dense darkness, where there is no light, where your eyes cannot see anything, your inner eye sees what is on the other side. People are intimidated by certain thoughts. Their lives are a constant distraction from their own perversions. If you think about fucking your mother, you want to push the thought away as quickly as possible. Loneliness on the other hand, drags you, it forces you to face your darkest fantasies.
You have fresh parsley, right? I'm sure it tastes the same. You look at me. I'll get you some parsley. It's in the garden.
It does not work. It pushes backwards. Okay. Imagine your shoulder is made of putty. It can stretch.
What awaits us when we open the tunnel to the other dimension? I do not know. I've never done it before. - What? - I only know it would be invisible.
But it's not true. Hey, come here. You were great. She told us a story. Only it wasn't true.
Mistakes were made, and I wish that had never happened. And it's... not easy for me to say this. - But... - I cheated on her. I had a brief affair. She meant nothing to me.
Andy, it's me. What are you doing for lunch? Come closer. I'm making a list. Go shopping with that jerk Kip. Buy him those albums. Have him listen to that shit until he recognizes a chord progression when it bites him in the ass.
Turn left there. How about we all find the courage to fight back? Don't wait for your daughters to be kicked out of school... or your wives to be sent to the factory. The story of freedom is not due to chance. It is based on choice.
Do you want it taken to the back? Straight back, last door on the left. Got it. What? It's yours, not mine.
- Safe. What is it? What is your stake in all this? In my world, there are many different theories for governing. I believe that a softer hand is much more effective. No one can change our current situation, it is almost rigid, instead everyone must try to value the good things.
Let's go. Where do you want these? Come on then. You killed my friend, you piece of shit! Yeah, I'm glad the little fucking rat got what he deserved.
Thank you. Folks, my suggestion is simple. Return to the original formula and let the YumTime brand flourish in its former glory. And then what? After a good quarter or two, smash us?
She must have had physical contact with the sample. How exactly are you involved in this? I was in charge of the safety chamber. Zero matter doesn't like to stay stationary. Where does it come from?
The same that I wanted. She wanted the zero matter. She had a gun. She said she knew more about zero matter than I did. She reached for it and it fell to the ground.
The man who pays your salary. Vernon Masters. War Department. What can I do for you? Put away those rifles, for one thing. You're making the situation a little more tense than it needs to be.
I can't tell you how happy I am to see this. This could save my life. I can't thank you guys enough. Ana helped me draw some plans for a containment chamber. It should be relatively easy to construct.
No one can. It is a destructive force. Look what it has done to me, to you. - We can change the world. - The world is good the way it is.
It is a destructive force. Look what it has done to me, to you. - We can change the world. - The world is good the way it is. Is it?
Examine each other. We already know that when I get too close to you, you extract zero matter from me and become tangible, which you cannot control. - I discovered this when you were unconscious. Just answer me this one question. Do you hear it? - Hear what? - The voice... It's like it's coming from your own mind, but it's coming from somewhere else.
As you know, the operation was very difficult. There were many internal injuries. We almost lost her several times. - Yes, but s-said the operation was successful. - On the whole, it was.
- What does the machine do? - I am not sure. A cannon. Something to do with gamma radiation. I think it fires a pulse of high-energy photons.
- You can't just fire straight. The pulse tends to follow a parabolic arc. Okay, got it. Samberly, thank you very much. I didn't know your unit was artillery. It wasn't.
Homeland Security always uses the same key teams and concentrates in the same way when they promote a VIP. If we prepare well, we might have a chance. What about Katie? If her measure doesn't work... It'll work all right.
Listen. The signal ends at the next intersection. - What's there? - A library. The attack was only to take food from those who had everything. and to give it to those who had nothing...
By the time Ocho heard the first signs of the drones, it was already too late. Fellow colonists, brothers and sisters, hermanos y hermanas, if you never hear my voice again, I want you to remember the words of Frederick Douglass. If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Power grants nothing...without a price. It never did and it never will.
My twin brother died in Paris. An accident? No, heart attack. I have the same deformity. Are you afraid?
Whether they are the souls of the dead I don't know, but as a medium you are receptive to certain vibrations. What do you mean by "vibrations"? It's a kind of intuition, a feeling.... There's a door. It's open a crack.
But you also have to free yourself from Lewis. I wish he would let me. Wherever he is, he would never forbid you. And even if he's nowhere, keep the memory of his freedom. Live it.
All right. We're having fun together, right? It's good that we can talk about work or Eric or breakups and stuff. My last relationship was brutal. It wasn't good for me at all.
- Very cool. - A little cold in here. - Yeah. I just see, above you is the air conditioner. It's blowing cold air at you. Is that okay?
No. No, I have to finish it. - And what are we working on today? - I'm going to open a new gate. And this time it will stay open.
- What about the gamma cannon? - Still charging. There's another option, but it's not good. - We could use the manual override. - Then use it.
- Is there nothing we can do? - I'm thinking. - How long until the gamma cannon is charged? - At least another 20 minutes. - It doesn't have enough power to fire.
Is that why you're here? To provoke me? No, that's why I'm here. The technical department left this for me. And I don't know how to access - the network database from the cell phone. - Give me that.
Can I have some of those? Go ahead. Jesus, Ricky, take it easy! The ladder's not strong. It is. If you use it like a normal person.
ROBINSON: Sensational! About time we got something in our stomachs. TUESDAY: It got me thinking. Were the others perhaps right? The other world had come to us, but was it really good? Or bad?
Why aren't you at your post? Don't do this. Because I left, 49 people I swore to protect died yesterday. That's not your fault, Bellamy. Blame those who deserve it, the Ice Nation.
Please. Take this. It is a symbol of our homeland. You are suited for this. It is amazing. When I dreamed of the earth, it was empty.
Take this. It is a symbol of our homeland. You are suited for this. It is amazing. When I dreamed of the earth, it was empty. But it is not empty now.
Elevated levels of serotonin and dopamine in Raven's blood are consistent with her claims, and as long as it's within normal limits, I'd say it's not drug-induced. You look disappointed. No. Surprised. We've all been through so much that it's hard to see hope, even when it's right in front of us.
Six, five... Becca, what are you doing? - Four... - She's taking the escape pod. Once it's launched, initiate the maneuver.
- All right. - But thank you very much, Gus. And to your left, you'll see our famous New York City street. This facade has changed many times over the years. Most recently, it was transformed into the main street in the Witchita series.
- Oh, God. Bertie. - Follow me, please. This is Gus's show. It's filmed here.
I know your churches, flocks and temples make enormous demands on your time. But I'm sure you also appreciate that a great many people watch movies to be informed, edified and, yes, entertained. Here at Capitol Pictures, as you know, countless technicians, actors and top-notch artists are dedicated to bringing the story of Christ to the screen. It's a fabulous story. It's been told before, yes, but we imagine never with such panache and distinction.
Do they still go to the movies a lot then? Well, we believe that families... I don't want to badmouth anything. I'm sure the movie industry is pretty darn interesting. But it's not always very serious, is it?
Although, after all, he is supposed to exploit the little man. And the body politic. Are you for the little man? For or against him, it doesn't matter. History will be what it will be, and we know how.
It's good to have them back. For you. And D'Artagnan. When will the garrison be blessed with its first child? I don't know if she ever will.
Don't make me go there, your majesty. They'll tear me to pieces! Good. Then it is decided. The Red Guard will attack the barricades, and we will end this monstrosity as quickly as it began.
Who do you think we'll be playing golf with on Sunday? Are you kidding? No, we're golfing with him. Your face reminds me of yesterday when the tail came out and you.... I think the snake was a cobra, it had a hood and a flat head.
-Sure? There could be someone there. -Ma, where's my bag? -I don't remember. -What a surprise. Got it.
You don't like him. But the good thing is: we now know what these guys want. The formula. Hence the break-in at my place. -Could she be there?
But Lizzy? She is different. She wants to help people, those less fortunate than her, and although I am a spendthrift, I would give anything for her, because she is my better self. Recant your statement, Coleman. It's a lie anyway. Say you were mistaken.
Not a type. I have something here. Is this a replacement for the toothpaste? I have a box of toothpaste for you. It's currently at the bottom of a lake.
- What to plant? - Cucumbers, tomatoes. Crops, soybeans, cereals, hemp, millet. - Garden stuff. - But you have guns, so I assume you have a decent stock of guns. It's decent. And your infirmary, is it filled?
We figured it all out together. That's what it felt like. After everything we've done. The world is not what we thought it was. Hilltop, the Saviours, it's bigger.
Is that all you have to say? All the effort and danger should have been in vain? That's the way the work is. No. All this happened because of your pet theory. And I was an idiot to go along with it because I thought you knew what you were doing!
What happened last season: Do you think the past can return? It never leaves us.
What happened last season: Do you think the past can return? It never leaves us. It is what we are.
He says that we should build more boats to be able to attack the Northmen in the water. Good. After today, it seems that I have two reasons to be satisfied. First, Duke Rollo's reasonable and interesting proposals for the protection of Paris, and second, Princess Gisla's abomination of marrying him. I'm sure she will soon try to have the marriage annulled on the grounds that it was never consummated...whether that's true or not.
What do you mean? She was brave enough to go for the Oriflamme. Your lust is clouding your judgment, because she's obviously not who you think she is. And frankly, a man brave enough to be emperor needs a mate with real iron in her soul. This one is more brutal than we are used to, and she will hurt you more.
Please bring him to the front. You made me suffer, and now I will make you suffer. And I have such a wonderful punishment for you. You might appreciate it to see that I took it from the gods. And it goes on, and on, and on.... and on.
Sometimes there is no choice, except a hard choice. This is the job. Now prepare the machine. - Sir, you don't really think... - It's not for me.
What will happen to everything you value. It's already starting to go off the rails, isn't it? Your portal destroyed, the stored Inhumans killed... It wasn't easy to get this number, but this call will cost you. We're tracing this line to every place it's connected to.
Those are... That's all the more reason to stand behind your chancellor. I've got to go. Here. Is the bug planted? It's in his jacket.
As you know, the terms of the War Act and the Exodus Statute give me the freedom and full authority to choose your punishment. Do you have anything to say in your defense? I appreciate... Your adherence to the rules of law.... I really do... But these are times when we must think outside the box to realize that they were created to serve a past world and not the future. I beg you one last time to see this world as it is, not as it was, or as you want it to be.
We? I can help you sell the lie because.... Whether you like it or not, Ontari, a fake commander, needs a fake keeper of the flame. I'm all ears. I'm going to need that box, Jasper. You can't have it.
That's more than you deserve. - My mother let them shoot at me. - I can relate. Stop talking and keep an eye out for the cave. Sinclair said it would be here somewhere.
I know you can hear us. Why are you doing this to her? Let her go. I'll let her go if you give me what I want. The technology Clarke's carrying, it's mine.
At least we know we're going in the right direction. The daylight is fading. We should stop in the sun to recharge the batteries. - What sun? - We keep driving until they are empty.
Are you coming? My work is done. I'm just going to take this to the director's cabin. So what do you know about this conference? I know it's small and secret, just a few countries.
Rip off our handcuffs. - Go on! Get out of here! - Give me your hand! Got it!
That annoys everyone, then things boil up. It's like in a chicken coop when you cram all the chickens together and they tear each other apart. -Yeah, something like that. -Man. I just found the overcrowding exhausting, but I guess it can be dangerous, too.
Like this. You make it part of you, and you become part of the sword. The blade never fades. That means you belong together. How does it know that?
They are in the building. Stop them. What the vampire did in the bar is called encanto. That was the first step. Similar to what a cobra does to a mouse before it strikes.
- The card. - Yes, the map of Helena Blavatsky. A Russian occultist from the 19th century. The map supposedly allowed her to sense the presence of demons. - I don't have it. - But you know where it is.
I've always liked that about you. Now, look. Howie and Russell here ought to beat you half to death... ...but for old times' sake, I'll let you go. It's funny. I didn't even know I had the map. But when I heard you were looking for it... I hid it someplace safe.
Mr. Hunter can now be handed over to the Russians for trial, which will probably end with his execution. - You can't do that! - Oh, I can and I will. You leave me no other choice. All this time I have been looking for your weakness, even though it was obvious.
The bank arrived, so I invited my best friend Dagmar and her worst friend Larissa, also my best friend. - Hello, silly. - Hey! - What's with the bank? - Hey. It's to connect and create community.
Exactly! - Away with this freak of wood. - Come on! My bench! It unites people!
I say it because, regardless of all the problems.... we are one community. A family. And that gives us strength. This strength is something powerful. It is not invisible.
A family. And that gives us strength. This strength is something powerful. It is not invisible. - It radiates.
Do you see this? The colors are quite beautiful. I hate it. I can relate to that. I don't think it's a good idea to have the Confederate flag... ...here in the White House after what happened in South Carolina... ...even if it's sinking.
O Lord, preserve us... Careful, it's slippery in here. Are you familiar with animals? No, not at all. But I am determined to enjoy this experience. I believe it will make me a better and wiser person.
I mean, together. Pretend? Do what? - Anything you want. Would you like to see my secret island? - Why is it secret?
You know it when you are there. The same is true today. What's in there? My praying mantis. Where is she?
His body was found on the riverbank. Our entire army can be here in a week. If Kaidu is not tired of life, he will release Genghim and Ahmad. The goyo plant. It is common in this area.
So that you can ruin everything I built? Are you to be remembered for destroying an empire that was about to rule them all? You want me to be remembered for saving it. Rhetoric is easy. But it conceals envy, lust and greed.
Freedom is a bitch that belongs on a mattress full of corpses. - I know what I'm asking for. - I don't think you do. Hypnosis is a brand new therapeutic tool. It can be effective, but it can also be extremely traumatic.
- I need cameras. Some people misunderstand the flag. That's right, it's me. I'm the ignorant one. It doesn't promote racism or slavery.
Madison, there are two girls making out in the hot tub, which is great. But this is about penises. I'm telling you, this is gonna be the best night... - Guys, get out of here. - Chet said we could hang out. Student parties are great, but now you're talking to a lady. - Her name is Beth Ann.
It has become one of our best episodes. And that's what you've done. All of you, okay? There's someone I want to thank in particular. Without whom this would not have been possible. Without whom this show would be an insignificant and ordinary reality show. But because of this person, it is something extraordinary.
She likes you anyway. - Yeah, but... Don't think this is your party and these are your friends. Use Tiffany, and you get what you want. Immunity. Every candidate wants it. But only one can have it.
I am happier than I have ever been. You understand that. You've felt an emptiness all your life, like I have. We tried to fill it, but it never worked. I've found the answer... and it's wonderful.
The device measures the volcano's sulfur dioxide emissions as the gases rise above the summit. This is a very important parameter in many volcano monitoring programs around the world. The precursor to this instrument was in use here in 2010 and played an important role in hazard analysis. A conservative estimate is that about 20,000 lives were saved because of the effective monitoring of Merapi in 2010 and the subsequent evacuation. I am very happy to see that it still works. Together with some colleagues, I hold the patent for the prototype we developed over ten years ago. This technology is now used at volcanoes around the world. It has revolutionized the monitoring of gas emissions from volcanoes.
One of Clive's graduate students, Adam Bobbette, was our guide. This must be repeated year after year, these rituals.... DOCTORAND IN CAMBRIDGE Here rituals are performed and offerings are made by the Sultan to the South Seas, even parts of his body. These are thrown into the sea to appease the Queen of the South Seas. As a result of their sexual union, a kind of monster was also created, which eventually occupied the volcano. It is in this hole that the offerings are placed, for it was at this place that the sexual union between the sea goddess and the first sultan occurred. I think that's where they come.
I wanted to explore the origin of all this and what, over a long time, underlies these processes. We are sifting through remains of people who lived 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Do you think we'll live on Earth for another 100,000 years? I suspect that we will be in a very critical position as early as 1,000 years from now. Therefore, we will have to learn from our mistakes and try to improve the living conditions on our planet so that it has enough capacity for our species to continue to exist. If there were a time machine, to which age would you return?
The lava has now solidified and cooled. But if we had been here then, we would have seen jets of fire, fountains of fire that shot 1.5 km high into the sky and then cascaded back to the ground. This is how the volcanic cones were formed, including the one we are standing on right now. From the base of these volcanic cones, lava flowed at a rapid pace. This lava is extremely hot and very fluid. It flowed down into the valleys and filled them 100 to 150 meters deep.
That was enough for Shepard and Grissom. But it's not enough for Glenn. The Atlas rocket... ...can take us into orbit. It will ascend and place the capsule in an elliptical orbit. Earth's gravity acts on the capsule, but it's so fast it misses the Earth.
But it's not enough for Glenn. The Atlas rocket... ...can take us into orbit. It ascends and puts the capsule into an elliptical orbit. Earth's gravity acts on the capsule, but it's so fast that it misses the Earth. This keeps it in orbit.
Earth's gravity acts on the capsule, but it is so fast that it misses the earth. This keeps it in orbit. How we get it back down is the great unknown. Yes, Katherine. So the capsule spins around the Earth forever because it's not slowed down?
So the capsule rotates eternally around the earth because it is not braked? Correct. Braking it at exactly the right moment and at exactly the right rate, that's the job. Yes, Katherine. So it has to go from an elliptical orbit... ...to a parabolic trajectory.
How much money are we talking about? A significant sum. Two million livres! It took me six months to design the lock and two blacksmiths one month to build the door. It is over 30 cm thick.
You have until noon today to open it. But if I remove just one piece, the mechanism will block the door. You must believe me. If you try to blow it open, the roof will collapse. To drill through it will take a week.
Hey, Sigmund and Sigmunda Freuds! Did you guys enjoy the reading? -Noah has a crush. -Really? -You liked it?
You pretend to travel the world. You can send your family postcards from anywhere. - Think about it. - None of this is fair to them. And the alternative? I know, it's bad.
And then he took back the day. The boy's name was Apache. All the Chiricahua are named after him. This is the story of how the world came to be. Or a prophecy of how it ends.
You can't tell me you think these are all impossible coincidences. I'm just saying that maybe that wouldn't be so bad. You're staring at a broken windshield. Something's wrong. It's broken.
What the fuck is that? - Open up, damn it. - I'm trying. - Open the damn door. - It's locked!
If everything works out, he's on his way to Abbie. Find her, Crane. Bring her home. The candle flame is a rope. Once it burns out, it pulls his astral body back.
A wild animal. Up on the tower. - We'll take care of it. - The creature. It's here.
- The creature. It is here. Follow me. There, on the heel. It climbs down.
Guys, the woman is heavily modified in ways you wouldn't imagine. Hmm, man, I need to get out more. Are you a patient of Dr. Radcliffe's? We have... some pretty cutting-edge eye technology. Maybe she'll be of some help to you.
The singularity is the decisive moment. The point at which measurable variables become infinite. Right. So our friendship is linear. - It is simple and convenient.
Doubt it made any difference. Always said I'd take a shot at Ward. - You think we'll get her back? - We'll have to. I guess sometimes it's easier to think the world wants you to suffer than to think it's got your back.
We stay in cover and kill him. We're retreating back to the ship. All right, Rip. Tell us the truth. You've all seen how malleable the timeline is... it keeps moving until it's fixed.
The building was vacated years ago, but many of Felicity Smoak's projects have been moved. Where to? Come. You didn't say Felicity's equipment would be here. Where did you think it would be?
This is what we signed up for: To be heroes. I agree with Jefferson. Of course you both do, since neither of you understand the pitfalls of changing the timeline. Meddling with the future is arguably more dangerous than changing the past, since it is still in flux.
- No, tell me. We'd be the two baddest sons of bitches ever. I don't want a ticker tape parade. You know what I want from this world. Yes... watch it burn.
To blackmail us. He knew we were guilty. But not that Laura wasn't my wife. Details, Señor Doria. The jury won't swallow your twisted theory unless it's backed up with details.
But you still don't know where it is. How do we know it's not a steel chalice gathering dust in some antique collection of someone? I think it's closer. We'll find the Pike. Whatever form it's in.
Search the turf! The good news is, whatever Turtle did, it only affected you temporarily. What was it like during Turtle's time? Yeah, no, it was weird. It was like waves of inertia, like all my energy was being sucked out of my body and then it returned.
I'd make a super hot corpse, wouldn't I? - Perfect for an open casket. - Camille. I want my wake to be at Rousseau's. I want it to be epic.
I asked you here because you were my friend and I figured you wouldn't judge me no matter what I decided. Ever. I'm the last person who should judge. My life is pure chaos as it is, but I will say this. As crazy as the world is with the monsters and the deranged people running around loose, it's still a better place with you in it.
You wanted to believe that the Army set me straight. I'm your brother, but I'm not like you. I didn't like the Army like you did. You saw the world as something that needed to be fixed. To me, it was just broken, so I made sure I had enough to survive in it.
What are you doing here? Well, I was at home, feeling more sorry for myself than I have in my entire life, when I realized. That's me. I wanted to be on your superhero adventure because I want to help people and the old me was so angry at the world, but that anger never accomplished anything. It just fueled more anger and led to some really serious and bad style decisions.
May I be bluntly honest with you? You didn't show any restraint before either. That's right. This company was on the verge of bankruptcy before you returned to Star City. And your injury, well, it didn't exactly help the stock price.
In Alcoholics Anonymous, they say you're only as sick as the secrets you keep. You've been looking pretty healthy lately. I hope to get back there with Donna, too. If you ask me, you're in a tough spot, trying to protect her. You know, sometimes a lie isn't wrong if it's for the good of someone you love.
Your engagement, the terrible shooting, your miracle healing.... It was all just a fairy tale. Camelot in Star City. - Thank you. - But when Camelot dies, everyone will know my truth. That love is a bullet in the head. No. No, it isn't.
No matter what, love always ends in death. That's why it's in the marriage vows. I'll just leave out the in-between part. Love is death. It isn't.
I became a person I never thought I was capable of being. I became a better version of myself. This would never have been possible without our love. Our love gives my life meaning. It gives meaning to my life.
I became a better version of myself. This would never have been possible without our love. Our love gives my life meaning. It gives my life meaning. And it... Brings us more joy than you could ever take away.
This would never have been possible without our love. Our love gives meaning to my life. It gives meaning to my life. And it... Brings us more joy than you could ever take away. And it's worth living for.
He was stung. Yes. He's having some kind of reaction. He wasn't just stung. - The bee is inside you. - Then cut it out!
If we can disrupt them, we can drive the colony away. The only problem is, we have to generate a frequency high enough to destroy the compound, unless you have... a hand-held sonic-launcher phone, then... What? This technology is amazing. It measures your voice emissions, and then it reworks them via digital output into a multiple channel.
It's Curtis, in case you haven't recognized my voice yet. No, no! Down with you, bitch bee! Too clear? The bee was alive again and well, that's when things got a little out of hand, - but don't worry, she's dead now.
If I had listened to you instead of trusting my brother, Laurel would still be alive right now. - If Darhk wins, Laurel died for nothing. - He thinks he's unstoppable. - Because of his magic. - It's too strong.
- I confronted Andy, and Dig barged in. Probably should have listened to your advice, District Attorney Lance. I'm still just a prosecutor. - I'm turning down the promotion. - Because it comes from Ruvé Darhk?
You channeled your grief and became Black Canary, but Sara is no longer dead. Maybe you owe it to yourself to finish the path you were on. - Are you serious? - This town has enough heroes in masks. With Ruvé Darhk as mayor, it needs a hero without a mask.
Maybe you owe it to yourself to finish the path you were on. - Are you serious? - This city has enough heroes with masks. With Ruvé Darhk as mayor, it needs a hero without a mask. It needs Laurel Lance.
That's terrible... And somehow also great. I think you've been hit on the head harder than you think. No, no, he's right. I can't hack this system. But if the missile's close enough, which it is...
To be honest, it's not very different from my former plans for the Glades, but on a much larger scale. Let me guess. You don't think destroying the entire world is completely insane? The world is what is crazy. It can no longer be saved.
Let me guess. You don't think that destroying the whole world is completely crazy? The world is what is crazy. It can't be saved anymore. It needs a new try, a new start.
- Miss Smoak, the board.... Whatever is so important, I hope it's worth it. Hi. I like your tie. It's very... embarrassing.
We have not taken any. Not one. None of us have. We are here because we believe, because we know that the world is evil and dark. It is beyond salvation.
So fight! Drug me again and I'll kill you, you son of a bitch. Hello, everyone. Uncle Lonnie here. You know, I adore your little community. It's so welcoming to outsiders, but it's so... structured. I'm going to have to fix that.
A colony of ants all in a row. Hundreds, thousands. But an ant knows only three. The one in front of it, the one behind it and itself. Until... it steps out of line, then it sees everything.
James Cole. Why don't you put the gun down so we can talk, all right? Run! Go! Cover your back!
He came here to kill me with this, this bone dagger. It's my bone they dug up in the future. Cole, you have to kill the witness with it. Time wants you to do it. It demands it of you.
We need to know what his target is and preferably yesterday. You son of a bitch. Right under my nose the whole time. Like a pack of sewer rats. - I didn't even know this SSR base existed. - It was never official.
- And straightforward. And... - Okay, okay. I get it. Dude, even if this town wasn't full of small-minded jerks, it would still be totally creepy.
Clever. If everything goes well today... this could be the only lasting memory of me. After all the missions, this flag could go down as my greatest achievement. Betsy, I'm sure you're wrong. Even so... ...it's beautiful.
Because he let us down. I'm sorry, but... We have to save the world, and I have candy on my mind. It's okay. Abbie sent these photos. They're hoping the thief of the real flag left a clue... where it's hidden.
It occurred to me that maybe I didn't know Betsy that well after all. But then I had a flash of insight. This flag is more than a piece of cloth. It is the symbol of the nation we fought for. It means much more.
This flag is more than a piece of cloth. It is the symbol of the nation for which we have fought. It means much more. So does the national anthem. It means much more.
Frida Kahlo, Picasso... the fearless lens of Diane Arbus.... and the grandiose flourish of Charles M. Schulz. What you call nonsense... Is, in fact, inspiration. And it was created by the everlasting soul of humanity. You may know everything... but you understand nothing. You don't have to teach me any art. It has been created by my worshippers for millennia... to celebrate my glory.
Our persistence paid off. Until I became greedy... and curious about more wonders the chamber might hold. Betsy! - General! - Betsy! The sequence to open the door no longer worked. - It does not open.
- I want to feel this pain until I find Hive. - And get revenge? I can't imagine what you've been through, but that desire? I know something about it. You think revenge is the missing piece of the puzzle, that it will make you whole again, but it only breaks you further.
I bet you're already thinking about it, right? To refresh my memory. So bring them in here. Make them my bed and bring every memory, every detail right to the surface where it belongs. That's it. We got the memory machine out of storage. But it's not for you.
So bring them in here. Make her my bed and bring every memory, every detail right to the surface where it belongs. That's enough. We got the memory machine out of storage. But it's not for you. Is it ready yet?
Make it my bed and bring every memory, every detail right to the surface where it belongs. That's enough. We've taken the memory machine out of storage. But it's not for you. Is it ready yet? - Tell me it's ready!
- How could I not? Almost as creepy as Hive, that one. Remember us? Fitz and Simmons are working with Dr. Radcliffe on a way to combat the effects of Hive's formula. But that's only a vague hope. This threat must be neutralized before it even comes close to detonation.
- Yes, it did. - The series ran for nine seasons. The purpose was to sell advertising time so that the series made a profit. It did well. So it was a success.
- The series ran for nine seasons. The purpose was to sell advertising time so that the series made a profit. It did well. So it was a success. - Yeah, but it sucked.
This does not taste like dreaming. I was told that I would get more attention here. The opposite is the case. Is your cell phone really a priority now? I'm sorry, let me just send an email... Why isn't it going out?
Your mother and I have always tried to keep you away from a certain lifestyle. This is not the world I wanted you to know. That's okay. It's fine. Understanding this world helps me understand you. It's cruel.
You're not infected, Travis. We are. We're the weeds that Mother Nature is pulling. What's happening right now isn't natural. Yes, it is. It couldn't be more natural. The earth had run out of power. That's why she said, "Enough."
All right. I'm on my way. Gideon. Was the trip a success, Professor Thawne? I believe it was.
He is paying for my mistakes. No. He pays for all our mistakes. Well, I have seen the world after all. It is beautiful.
Maybe that's the message of the show, that all this shit is meaningless, you know? Like life, love, and all the meaning in it. I'm telling you, the human condition is a complete tragedy. Like I said, I never have to say anything, and repetition is good for me right now. It keeps my regimen going.
Hey, I'm not a tumor that needs to be removed, do you understand that? I am the opposite. I am the organ that is vital to your existence. If you insist on playing this on, I'm going to go from annoyed to hurt, and boy, trust me, you don't want to hurt my feelings. How do I take off a mask when it stops being a mask, and when it's just like me, a part of me?
What you're doing here, Darlene, and what you're saying? You sounded like George W. Bush, for crying out loud. Okay, first of all, that's unfair. And second of all, give me some credit. The speech was bullshit, but it works.
You're acting like a child. I'm not 20 anymore. Thank you, I know. I am a child. So I can see the world as it really is. Not the way the zombies taught you.
Broussard didn't go through with it. You're still standing here. Is that supposed to make me feel better? A thing like this needs all kinds of people, Katie. It needs soldiers like Broussard who can pull the trigger... and it needs people like you.
Here. One pointer must point to the sun, then the other points to the north. Then there is north. Since when is the sun north? - Well, now. Watch: "In the east the sun rises, in the south it takes its course, in the west it sets, in the north it is never to be seen."
Unless you can't. It's worse than I remember. The rage. The hunger. I'd like to blame my anger on Finn, but it's gotten worse since I came back.
I called in a favor. Watch out, the transformation is going to hurt and your first full moon is going to be nasty as hell. But like I said, you're strong, you can handle it. You'll never forget what happened, but.... but you can't let the past define who you are. Finn, give it to me.
Watch out, the transformation is going to hurt and your first full moon is going to be nasty as hell. But like I said, you're strong, you can handle it. You'll never forget what happened, but... but you can't let the past define who you are. Finn, give her to me. Give her to me.
You will never forget what happened, but... you can't let the past define who you are. Finn, give her to me. Give it to me. Let's do this. After all this time, destroy it.
Your boss has a really strong desire for some Mikaelson blood and I just want to know who he is. This doesn't have to get ugly here. You poor saps. I let you take the bullet. He wanted you to have it.
Look, I have a better idea. A Tibetan singing bowl that I put in a dark object in the 19th century. It's like an echo chamber. With Finn's blood, we can strengthen his connection to Vincent. But like everything of mine, it now has Klaus' ex.
- Kol and his ridiculous moves. 900 years in a box and no patience at all. It's all a joke to you, isn't it? "900 years in a box" escapes your lips as if time has passed without consequence. - I can assure you it hasn't.
And you know what? The show has already started. You're going to have to listen to me now. Let me finish, because I understand what you are going through. Our connection to the ancestors has been severed. They are gone.
VAMPIRE MOB: (SCREAMS) Yes! Torture him! (VAMPIRE MOB MURDERED) Justice for Klaus Mikaelson. should be a fate more terrible than death? This blade is imbued with dark magic. It will cause endless agony.
- If we don't, we'll never see them again. - Okay, that's enough. All right? We all want to help her, so we have to make sure she's consecrated, but she has to be safe, so we're going to pull her to a place where she's protected, then we can get her back. And that's going to take a lot of power, and my power isn't what it used to be before I was cast out.
Rebekah. Freya. Why are you telling me this? Because love will make you strong. It will make you the man I know you want to be.
Does it work? Not until I find a high-quality lens. I think I can get you one. A thing like this needs all kinds of people, Katie. It needs soldiers like Broussard who can pull the trigger, and it needs people like you.
They have given us the power to shape the business of government as we see fit. Yes, but they have made one thing clear beyond a doubt. We must maintain order. Well, I don't think that order can be enforced by fear. It comes from providing people with a decent quality of life.
You didn't answer my question. Do I talk to the crew? No, I don't. I have looked at the details of this operation. It is solid.
I prepared it myself. Thank you for coming by. I... that's really very kind of you, very. I understand the funeral was today, right? - Wasn't it? - Yes, it was.
They lived very simply and did not join our social circles. But they loved their art objects. They invested every dollar they earned in them... and had great taste. Their collection is not in any of your catalogs. Few people even know it exists... but I know about it because I helped them find a lot of the pieces in it.
After the explosive device goes off, they will run around nervously like chickens. We can grab the VIP and take him out through the tunnels. And then we'll bring him here for safekeeping. I'm sorry, so we're gonna blow up a subway? No, we're just gonna make it jump off the tracks.
We are leaving the colony. What? You, Maddie and the kids are going with Beau. He's got a cabin in Big Bear. It's full of supplies, it's secluded, it's safe.
What kind of payment? We will see. Let's begin. The chain. It pulsates.
My dear, forgive me. But I must protect you. Protect? What do you mean, Jonas? Are you drunk? Boy, no matter where the soul goes, the important thing is how it returns.
I never had time to talk to you. I love you. There were so many things in my youth that I wanted to share with you. My son, don't worry. We'll be together, and here you can be the way you want. Never give up. The important thing is not where the soul goes, but what it returns as, right?
What we do know is that in 20 years Kasnia will be Savage's permanent location from which he takes over the world, so we don't want to kill him there, but if we find out how his actions helped strengthen his power, - then we don't have to. - Understood, Captain, but if we look at the future.... Maybe we should invite the Nerd twins. I can already hear what Stan is going to say about 2147. - The future, it's...
Then he'd better not shoot past. You run around town like it's your damn shooting range. - You think you're gonna... - Yeah, do you? You act like it's a playground.
There is nothing good about the dirt I clean up. - How do you know that? - I just know. Look around you. The city stinks. It's a cesspool.
- How do you know that? - I just know. Look around you. The city stinks. It's a cesspool. It stinks like shit, and I can't get rid of the stench.
The following week there were auditions and my father, Owen Golly Sr. was chosen to be Sid the Hedgehog. Thus began the family dynasty. Guys, we've got to go. -Bag? -Hurry up. -Got it.
It wasn't sitting there, I bought it. -Bought it? When did you buy it? -Yesterday. I've been working on this number for months. It's good.
I like your pipe. -Thank you. -It's cool. I like having it on my lips. It's like a friend in my mouth.
[Max] That has a bad tone ... [Fred] It's okay. Play it. [Father on screen] We want chocolate! Give it to us!
And when I marry the king, I will be queen and you will be meaningless. I know you have fought. I did once, too. But this decision is final. And it affects not only you, but also your son.
Or we had one. We hid it somewhere where it was not allowed, - and that's why we didn't tell the police. - Where did you hide it? - Up there. - And it's still there?
Here, the originals. - Nothing too useful? - No, sir. - But thank you for your cooperation. - And your paper. It was here.
But the city still needs a sheriff. Well, I'm not the law and order type... nor the stay-put type. At least we have that in common. At least. Take care, Jonah. The beauty of my world... for you, it's not going anywhere.
You are dead. Both of you! Two kids playing house! Watch your tongue. While it's still attached.
I never asked you to coerce a witness! - I wanted to help you. - That doesn't help. Because of you, the testimony is invalid. It's been thrown out.
Like this? We do it again. Everything has been removed from the room. He's tied up, but keep your distance and respect the markings. Do not violate it, otherwise a dream will come true and I'll arrest you.
- I'm working on it. - Yeah, you bet. The victims have to disappear from the scene, no one can find them. No. They need medical attention. Yeah, they'll get it, but...
You should be tying her to that chair, not me. She is not the problem. The others are. They're gonna turn this town upside down to find her, Matty. And watch her burn.
Others spill blood in the streets to stem the tide, the crime, the cruelty the pervasive disregard for human life. But that's Hell's Kitchen. Angel or devil, rich or poor, young or old, you live here. You didn't choose this city. It chose you.
So you are the center. Track down the hand, keep Black Sky at bay. Killing when it suits you. Take it or leave it. The fact remains that the city you vowed to protect is the battleground in a war it doesn't even know about.
Electra works for me. The bullet entered Mr. Castle's skull at the lower right, specifically at the sutura sphenofrontalis, the cranial suture between the sphenoid bone and the frontal bone, which are located here and here. I believe my expert witness is trying to make it clear that my client, Frank Castle, was shot specifically, as in an execution, in the head. Would you please describe the damage that Mr. Castle sustained from the bullet? It fragmented on impact and damaged the right frontal lobe and the temporal lobe of the brain.
With destiny. You should be familiar with the procedure, Chronos. The name is Mick. Although we did make some tweaks. Your preparation was not as thorough as it should have been.
Why did you think I was angry? Because of this? Women don't like it when men poke holes in things. Lucifer, our last session was a breakthrough. Was it?
Dr. Shaw's wife, Alexandra. Her friends call her Sandy. And you're friends? Open relationship therapy, huh? No, not the way you think. It's just who the Shaws are.
It was not him. Who would want to pin that on him? - I don't know. - We may have the murder weapon. Check for DNA traces and fingerprints.
Are you with me, brother? - He is right. - You see? And he must know it. You're doing it for yourself. You're selfish and you want to feel better because you've ignored the poor sap all his life.
Dr. Morrow is dead, but maybe his blueprints for an android have.... No, she's not an android, that's what I'm trying to tell you. I looked her right in the eye, and someone was looking back at me. She has a soul. And in some ways, she's like mine.
Agent Danvers. There. You guys really buried the hatchet, huh? I want every satellite we've got locked onto that city. Scan block by block.
Weren't you innocent? Exactly. I am. That makes my apology even more significant. If it was meant seriously.
It's about middle and high school kids who are always in trouble, and they send them to jail for a day. The idea is that jail will totally scare them and then they'll get their lives together. That's why it's called Scared Straight. There's one episode in particular that I love. It aired once.
Two seconds later, a light goes on in my head. How crazy of me to tell him to Google the club. You know? You figure it out, you idiot! Have I lost my mind? I pull a DVD out of my pocket, hand it to him.
You know? You figure it out, you idiot! Have I lost my mind? I take a DVD out of my pocket, hand it to him. "My name's on it. It'll help you find the show."
I knew you would understand. See you soon. Would you mind if I used your restroom? No. It's at the end of the hall, on the left by the stairs.
My mom leaves all kinds of stuff lying around. This breeze is so fucking good, man. Yeah, it does. Sometimes you can feel that breeze in our neighborhood too. It blows through the streets and everything stops for a moment. Everybody just wants to feel it.
And my friends. From my company. Failed experiments. They were a danger to their country. I had to stop the operation before it got out of hand.
I'm sorry, but I mean it. You could really get hurt doing this shit and for what? Grow up. Do you love magic? Is it in your soul?
- And you and Eliot should never have gone to the herb witches alone. - I know. Quentin, do you really think that the magic we teach means you're above what's right and what's wrong? Magic doesn't solve problems. It magnifies them.
It enlarges them. I know that, too. Believe me. I don't need to be taught what magic is and isn't. I need to be taught magic so that I can decide what it is and what it isn't, for me.
Sometimes you only see what it looks like. See you tomorrow at the party. What party? Lorna and Red are having a party for me in the rec room. Didn't they tell you?
-I'll go check on him. You stay here for now. May I say that the "stay here" part worries me? Could you maybe bring me my wallet? It's on the table in the hall.
According to the librarian, it could be the name tag of an employee. It's a woman. How did she get in here? The wall had never been changed before the work. That's why it's been restored now.
- Alain Gerard, the curator of the Palace of the Popes. This room served him as a shelter during the siege. Here, perhaps, was kept the treasure of the popes. We have a body. Who is she and how did she get in here?
Their ability to communicate is one of their most obvious strengths. We experienced that firsthand at the Central Park massacre. You see that? These are patterns of strigoi communication. They vary, but...
"and discovering that you yourself were the prisoner." Are we in the right place? The plague had spread so quickly that hopefully there was no time to get the black box to DC. It looks almost like a small generator, about the size of a breadbox. And it's not black, but bright orange.
But the truth is that we lack personnel. At current casualties, we can't push them back any further. What is the kill rate of the bioweapon? Around 75%, roughly. - Last week it was 100%.
I have waited and I understand. Show me that you understand. Show me who you are. Duke Rollo, by the power granted to me by His Holiness the Pope, I have come to hand you the annulment papers that formally end your marriage to Princess Gisla. Since the marriage has not been consummated, it does not exist under Christian law.
- I am making myself king of all Norway. To become king of all Norway, you would have to overthrow my husband. That was impressive. I have modified the Frankish weapon. It now has a much greater range.
Yidu! Yidu! Give me some Chinese medicine. - But aren't you going to sleep? - No, just give it to me.
He said they were the greatest threat to his kingdom. My grandfather, wise as he was, great as he was, did not understand everything. Times change. But the threat of the Northmen remains. Of course it remains, poor Roland.
Isn't it a little early for the melon to get drunk? By that I mean you. You're the melon. I'm not eating it yet. It still has to steep.
No, no. - If our calculations are correct... - And they do. And they are. Once this device detonates, it collapses the event horizon on this side of the rift, blocking any... to Earth-2 forever.
Is it true that Pollyhop provides you with voter data? - The question was recorded. - Did he answer? No. Online, it is causing quite a stir.
I don't know that, sir. I never talked to him and I wouldn't. It's classified. And your conscience is clear. Yes, sir. The conscience has an unmistakable stench... like raw onions and bad breath... but a lie... stinks even worse coming from someone who doesn't usually lie.
- Oh, man. - I laminated the magazine so I could keep it. - I'm just trying to emulate you.... - This guy is amazing. I won an award for it, it's over there, see?
I want people to know you're taken. - That is so strange. - What is that? My meta-human warning app. It thinks you're a meta-human.
- What is it? My meta-human warning app. It thinks you're a meta-human. - That is so weird. - Yeah, it must be broken.
- Great actress. She really is. I should probably do the garbage truck scene. In the racism episode, I show up at the beginning, but I'm not shown later? What did you expect? White people wrote it, certainly with good intentions, but I don't know them.
We told a story about the touchy subject of racism in America! And we scored a hit! Full marks! Hope you guys liked the lesson! Spread it all over the place!
Sorry to bother you, sweethearts. Your dad and I were cleaning out the attic. Not a euphemism. And look what we found... your violin. Play it and see if it still works.
Can I tell you a little secret? No! When I approached my first crush, things went much worse. It was New Year's Eve and I gave him a kiss and my tongue froze to his cheek. Why did it freeze?
I'll be right back, too. Hey. I need to talk to my husband alone for a minute. Thank you. There's no way you're paying that bill. It's been sitting there for ages now and he hasn't even pretended to reach for his wallet.
It was very nice talking to you. I have a quick question about... Goodbye. It's okay. When I tell the story, it ends with her singing "Happy Birthday."
Everything fully cool in the pool. -Maybe there are other options. -Unfortunately, no. Dr. Randy said, "I can't help you anymore." Why suffer the horror of treatment if it doesn't work?
That was the name of the restaurant. Give that to the courier. Thank you. If you need the contact list, come to my office. It will be ready by noon today.
We could run her through facial recognition. - She had a mask on. - What was her suit like? Hey, that's a fair question. It is indeed.
If you managed to save Laurel, you wouldn't be alive. Okay, fine. I don't care. When we left, when I recruited you guys, we changed the timeline. If it had stayed the same, Damien Darhk...
If Savage plans to blow up the world three times, how do we stop him? - We don't. We kill him. - How? We always knew that only you or Kendra could kill Savage with objects exposed to the same radiation as the meteorite. The radiation works in two ways. It gives Savage his immortality, but...
- We do not. We kill him. - How? We always knew that only you or Kendra could kill Savage with objects exposed to the same radiation as the meteorite. The radiation works in two ways. It gives Savage his immortality, but... It also makes him vulnerable.
I should stay and help you with Darhk. And get justice for Laurel. It'll happen, sweetie, with or without you. I promise you. Look, I can't claim to understand this time travel thing, but it sounds very significant.
Do it! Do whatever you want, I don't care anymore! I know soldiers like you from the past. And maybe you were good people once. But when you experience so much violence, it becomes the only thing you understand.
Yeah. - That one, man. That's three bucks. - Is that the melon from the fridge? - Yeah, it's been eaten!
- Sorry, that's the last one. Asshole. Hey, uh... You're not wearing your watch. It's at the jeweler's for the clasp.
Don't panic. We're working on a brand new image. Tell them to go to hell. Write it discreetly, as always. And delete the message. In case the Eloísa people see it.
Don't let Raven ruin this for all of us. How could you do this to us? I realized the truth. They sent us all down there to see if Earth was survivable. From what I've seen, it's not.
So we're good buddies now? Today is not the day to act like assholes. You think you can do this for a whole day? You know what I had to do to get this job. There are people here today who don't respect this badge because it's stuck on a black man.
I am not proud of the incident. And I plan to apologize at the sermon on Sunday. - John... - I'm not going to apologize for the message I sent out. There is a sickness in this city. It's spreading like a forest fire.
- Griffin. Stop talking. So I can concentrate. Wake up, man. This town is fucked because of you. She was calm and normal.
Already tried. GPS does not work. Okay, no, but the meta-human activity should. The watch was designed to track metas, right? And since Griffin Grey is one, it keeps sending a message to a server until it gets through.
A stuntman makes a shitload of money! - I just want to find her mother. Good. Where's her mother? She works at the Hold Queen's Head.
Help! Help! Somebody help us! Prepare a transfusion, warm up the Reidling stones. - Can you heal the wound? - It's deep, but it's not impossible.
Classically taught. There is a special school called Brakebills. You've heard of it? Yes. I kind of enrolled here to get away from magic, so from that.... You think magic is some horrible vice, so bad that you need rehab to get clean again, it's not.
Is that a turban? No, it's your hair. Sewing isn't really my thing. How is a voodoo doll going to help me? In the books, Jane carries this doll everywhere and it looks just like her.
I have lost it. - And nothing lost was ever found? Wait, there's... What about Penny? There must be something we can do. You have to read between the lines, Quentin. Jane's doll wasn't special because it looked like Jane.
Wait, there's... What about Penny? There must be something we can do. You have to read between the lines, Quentin. Jane's doll wasn't special because she looked like Jane. She was special because of where she came from.
She is very shy. - It's like touching a cable. More energy than I have ever felt. - It felt good. - It felt dangerous. The reason you treat magic like a drug is because the people who taught it to you act like drug dealers.
Save us all time and energy. - Listen, I... - Shut up, okay, Chip? Just once. Take the gun, put it in your mouth, and save us all the words.
I know how the lightning must combine with the dark matter from the particle accelerator explosion. I can repeat the conditions to get your speed back. It will work. Your ruse... won't last. But more importantly, it won't save Snow.
I can repeat the conditions to get your speed back. It will work. Your ruse... won't last. But more importantly, it won't save Snow. It won't bring back your Caitlin.
When do I get out? Well, the bail hearing has to be held within 72 hours. Three days? I'll try to expedite it. Maybe they'll take us sooner.
That's... I always thought that was what the two of us were best at. Yeah, just the two of us, late at night, wide awake in the little studio above the store. - The place was a shithole. - It could use a coat of paint.
You should enjoy that, sir, enjoy every minute that you can. I'll try. I'm leaving for Sandringham immediately. - Provided you give me clearance. - It's granted.
We're just making it seem like voting is happening. And think of the headlines. We'd be the talk of the town. They're turning the convention into a circus. Oh, Bob, maybe you haven't noticed... ...but politics isn't just theater anymore. It's show business.
- My review of it was just to... - No. Forget it. I didn't take it personally. That's politics. I'd like something like your gun bill. Too bad it didn't pass the Senate.
The fact is, they confirmed a list that I had already compiled myself. Okay. Officially, I don't want to know about it. Unofficially, I am worried about what will happen if the Feds' theory about the Ukrainians gets out to the Russians. There could be retaliation, more deaths, less peace. So maybe you can give them a better theory, whether they want to hear it or not?
I didn't expect to hear from you again so soon. Shall I send for some food for you? No, thank you, and to be honest, the blood bank is not the only reason I want to talk to you. I looked at this facility that you asked about. It is adequate, but I think you could find something better.
If they last long enough, the West will run out of engines right when your engine hits the market. Unless the war ends before you are ready. Then Russian engines will be available again and Pentillion's efforts will fail. Your stock will be worthless. I'm not sure how you found out about Zolotov's peace mission, but as soon as you thought it would cause your efforts to fail, you arranged for his assassination.
First round's on you, rich boy. FBI - Bureau of Investigation, New York If you tell the director, someone else I care about will die. The FBI has a way of dealing with lunatics. It's called chain of command.
You were born with zero negative. But that has changed. Recently. The mutation is not contagious, is it? It can't be transmitted to humans.
I have sacrificed my life for them. But it's never good enough. Because these people only want to fill their bellies and fuck themselves sore, otherwise they strive for nothing. Words like "expansion" and "empire" mean nothing to them. They need to see the future, feel it, hold it in their hands.
Santé! I can't believe you're here. I know you can't. You should have heard JT's eulogy. It was very beautiful.
But corporate profit is more important to her than the damage this crazy dolphin chick will do when her face is in the news.... That's right, the news. I need to expose these two publicly. Is that really a good idea? If that's what you think, then by all means, I support you. But maybe it's not such a good idea? If this idea was a Dillon brother, maybe it would be Kevin, not Matt?
There's an open storm drain. Shit. All right. Here's what we should do: sit in front of the embassy and wait for it to open.
I would like to place a collect call. Our friend calls his wife for a money transfer from the USA. She is not at home and I don't know her cell phone. You don't know the number? It was in my cell phone.
- Wait, we are innocent. We are Americans. - Wait. Milo left us the villa. It's ours, but if you want it, it's yours.
That will be added. - But I will not pay it. Neither the fee, nor the commission. Why would a guy for whom you're making an illegal transaction...? And you were right, it is highly illegal....
At least a quarter of it. I doubt it. - He had the will. He can't leave the villa. It belongs to me.
Cake, cake, cake. Haters hate, bakers bake. Cake in the morning. What about this pie? My class made it for Hunger Action Month.
He said he was fine. We need to find your father, not my father. Valentine is... His stele. Where is it?
I pray that it will stay that way. It won't. Until Snow White dies, I will never be what you want, let alone what I want. And this box was created to hold something of value. And it will.
Will you take this, huh? Today is about proving you can get along with others, okay? No need to pout. I'm not here to hurt your precious city. It has sentimental value to me, too.
Yes, we do. Oh, by the way, that kid we found in the coffin? Do you still have his address? I think so. Yeah, here it is.
and locked them away here for all time. When I escaped, I vowed to free them. But you couldn't do it without this? My life force is in there. In order to unite with the others, it has to be here, otherwise I can't take the form that suits me in your world and I'll never get out of these...
Thanks, Max. Wait a minute. You said you were in the other place. But how did you get out? I destroyed Phears' life pod, it sent me back to our world.
If I were you, I wouldn't be so arrogant about your ability. Opening the door to that dimension might not have been so good. On a scale of one to namaste, how bad is it? Demons are drawn to this dimension. It is defenseless and peaceful.
Now it has become much worse. Help me stop this with your magic. There is nothing I can do. My magic is asleep. Then wake it up.
It belongs here. That's closer to the point. We're good to go. The energy is very weak. It's been dormant for a long time.
Oh my God! Jace, it's okay. Breathe. Where's my stele? She didn't come.
How many times have you been kidnapped? Ten, 20 times? You'd be better off without me. I just got a group message from you. What? - It went to JT and Tess, too.
Finance? Are you really a finance guy? - I'm not a kid anymore. - Sure, yeah. Empty the bag. Go ahead, empty it.
- What? What if this Marina? Okay, what if she gets this really freaky shit? I mean, really rad, unique magic. Maybe it would set you free. Forever. She'd have to be pretty amazing.
Okay, what if she gets this really rad shit? I mean, really rad, unique magic. Maybe it would ransom you. Forever. She'd have to be pretty amazing. She is.
The beast? - Well, he has many names. - That's all well and good, but I'm just trying to get back to the Earth Well. Can you show me where it is? I guess I could order you a map, but it has to come from another branch.
This is the second suicide victim in the same area in 24 hours. - That can't be a coincidence. - It's not. Look at his watch. It's on his right wrist.
May we sit down? Mrs. Nakano, has your husband been a sushi chef all his life? Yes. He was very proud of his work. But it came at a price.
And I was nervous when I met him. And yet he wanted to kill me. Even if he had known, it still wouldn't have mattered. The rules apply and he believes in those rules. Your biology saved you, it gave him the chance to know you, to love you.
Maybe we're from the same place, or what? Where's the kid? At the Youth Welfare Center. Interestingly, she was abandoned right in front of this building. We're already matching the baby's DNA to see if it matches anyone in our database.
Go on a journey to the moments of gratitude. You might feel a hand on your head. If so, stay in your state and strengthen it. If not, you will still feel the energy. It will be within you.
Go into that moment, look through your eyes, see what you saw then, feel what you felt, grateful.... Feel the blessing of that moment. What a blessing it was in your life, how grateful you are. Take in the gratitude of that moment. Feel it.
I don't know if that interests that many people. If the success of your film is based on that, you have a problem. It should be based on more. It should be based on what people find fulfillment in, what makes them alive, hungry, what makes them change. Change can happen quickly, but we're afraid it won't last.
There will be chaos. And believe me, we're not ready for that, and neither are you. I can't believe you're going along with this. If there's a heaven, there's a hell. Maybe she's coming for us.
And look, here comes UNIT to shut down your headquarters. Almost like someone tipped them off. The Revenge of Harmony Shoal is notorious and feared - throughout the five star systems. - Oh, is that her? Is it really?
Easy to understand, honestly. At first, I wanted your friends to leave. Before they came, I had an operation going well here, but now I've decided that they've done too much damage, so my resentful side has decided.... Did you know I have one? She wants to punish them.
What if I just can't do it? There is a special number if you have dyslexia. Give it to me. For computers, I have dyslexia. You can find them online.
No, you don't understand. I'm eager to get back to work as soon as the doctor lets me. If you want to work, you need an up-to-date resume. That will help you find a job. You know what, there is a resume workshop that they want you to attend please.
I thought you should see this. Good Lord. We need to send a warning. To cover our asses. Kenneth, it should come from you as chief science officer.
Then we better come up with something, and fast. I'm not in the habit of pulling a lawyer, Ms. Gibbs. And I'm not used to having an accomplice be the lawyer in a case. I'm entitled to representation. You had that last night.
Hold on a second. It doesn't matter if Forstman finds out or not if he doesn't have someone on the inside working for him. What are you saying? I'm saying that if they want me to point a finger at somebody, that means I'm holding a gun. She's still alive.
That's to say that one day you're going to face the bar's fitness committee, and I seriously doubt that they're going to admit someone who has done something like that. Are you planning to intimidate a witness? Because yes, one day I will face this commission, but tomorrow they will hear from you. I'm your only chance out of this mess. If you just deliver me the people who are actually responsible for this, and then I will make sure that both they and Mike can practice law for the rest of your lives.
- Sheila, please. I came here once before with the hope of a second chance, and you denied it to me. What's that got to do with it? Because if we had gotten back together then, I wouldn't be at the firm now, but I am. And she's all I have.
I was thinking about what you said about not admitting things to myself, and I wanted to talk to you about that. Why? I want you to know the truth. And what exactly is the truth? Our relationship didn't end because of Mike. It ended because I wasn't ready to face what was wrong with me. and I don't know if I ever will be, but... I did get help, and I wanted to let you know.
You heard her. She said the fact is I'm not a goddamn lawyer. The only way I'm going to change that fact is if a jury sees that I'm a goddamn lawyer. If you try that, all they're going to see is somebody going to jail. It's my decision and this is what it looks like.
Yes, it does. Lola, must have missed something. Then we need to get her to make it right. Are you insane? If you go to Lola, you'll lead Gibbs right to her, and then this thing will be over before it even starts.
You have one last chance to save yourself. Call me before it's too late. Okay, so we have a strategy for you to defend yourself. We just need a way to rattle Gibbs when we start. I have an idea, but... you're not going to like it.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I think most of us.... You've noticed before in the trial that I have a photographic memory, and I do, but how it works.... I don't just take a snapshot of something. I read it and then I understand it, and once I understand it, I don't forget it. But I've tried to memorize my speech, but I can't because it's bullshit.
Let me guess. You're suing me for instigation. You bet your ass I am. You instigated Jack Soloff to violate his non-compete clause. You don't have a non-compete agreement with Jack Soloff or anyone else. I understand you tried that empty threat with Louis, but it's not going to work with me.
You bet your ass. You put Jack Soloff up to violating his non-compete clause. You don't have a non-compete clause with Jack Soloff or anyone else. I understand you tried that empty threat with Louis, but it won't work with me. If it is so "empty," then so is your morals clause and your law firm bylaws, which say that if a name partner is an accessory to a crime, then any partner may leave.
I'm just saying, so you don't have to run down every time. It's a nuisance. I'll be gone for two hours. You can put it in my spot. Thanks, but we'll move the car. - As you wish. - Give me the key. I'll do it.
Someone will meet you there. He gave me an address in Woodside. It wasn't Hobbes. It was a different voice, but... It sounded kind of familiar.
She threw up in my basket. Exactly. Loyalty still counts for something. How true. Tell me, is it also more important than self-respect?
Where were you when Matt was in the hospital, unconscious, fighting for his life? Someone's in the house. Hey, Lee, I'm not staying here alone. Where's your gun? Where it should be, locked away in a drawer upstairs.
- It always does. All right. - Can you feel my energy? - Yes. May it flow through both of us and connect us.
Steve told me something about the final rungs he's receiving. They deal with his succession. What happens next after he leaves us. - The plan... - Where is he going? - What's going on? - The message he receives... It tells him it's time to move on.
- No! No! Oh, man. My virgin hand! She's never held a beer before!
That's fine. It burns! Shit! Oh, my God! I've been looking for the church door for ten minutes, and it's in your pile.
If eliminating Mayfair was phase one, what is phase two? This country is on the verge of collapse. It has been for years. The government doesn't care about the people. It's broken with all the corruption.
The mining company had it built before it was shut down in the 80s. Since then, pirates have been dwelling here. This island is basically a safe haven, as long as the water doesn't get in their way. But they use it too inconsistently for the government to be willing to take action against it. So it is virtually uninhabited.
You okay? Yeah, I'm fine, but we have to get the plane down somehow. Why? Can't you disable the missile? No, it's programmed to auto-launch.
The same with the painting. So I think he's intelligent enough to use gloves. And do you still think the bomb was specifically meant for us? The surveillance tapes confirm that the camera was placed next to the fire alarm after the thief blacked out the other camera. And it was connected to a wireless transmitter.
She bought it after you were born. It goes well with your eyes. Where did you get... After she died, some of her things were sold. I knew how much this necklace meant to her, so I bought it. Now it's yours.
The CBRN team has completely searched the vehicle. Nothing is connected to the bomb. The bomb has not been activated. That's because it has a remote detonator... Look at the bomb. It doesn't have a receiver.
It was really born for this. It's the CBRN team. The bomb is gone. Emergency team confirms. It's gone.
The bomb is gone. Emergency team confirms. It's gone. The terrorist has it. Only high-ranking FBI members can know where it went.
You told me that everything would be fine and I had to live with that. There is another bomb. Thousands of people will die. - The bomb is gone. - The terrorists have it.
Thank God you are here. I flew here as soon as I heard about you and the bomb. Okay, everybody, listen up, please! Finding Miranda Shaw is now our top priority. We have to stop her before the bomb goes off, wherever she is, and we will not fail.
I need someone on the 6th floor, east stairwell. Okay, I'm coming from the west. Liam. I know you're here. Even if you find the bomb, you can't disarm it.
For him or me? The choice again. For how it was, or how it could be? Because I think it's up to you for the first time. The bomb isn't here. Then where is it?
That's pretty hopeless. Yes, but there is still a chance. In the Valley of the Kings, there is a tomb that has been lost and forgotten. And no one else knows it's there. I'll buy the permit as soon as it's available.
The old man saved my life. I could not save his. I couldn't save his. You had a couple of scenes with the prop gun today. Any idea where you put it?
- Very good. - Your insurance card, Mrs. Hendrix. - I have it right here. - She changed her hair. - Because it was ugly before.
- Your insurance card, Mrs. Hendrix. - I have it right here. - She changed her hair. - Because she was ugly before. Anyway, she's very pretty now.
I am expensive because I am worth it. Hello? - You're still here. - Yes, I love this city. It's wonderful.
I couldn't see that. We found these at the scene. God, they were supporting my wife. - That makes the tragedy worse. - Yeah, that doubles it.
Hi, dear. Go back to your book. Where are you going? I just have to take care of something. I've been trying to cure this disease ever since it surfaced.
We did a great job, Evie. I promise it wasn't for nothing. It's not my fault, it's Susan Duncan and her clones. Technology is also subject to natural selection, Evie. It changes and adapts.
- Yes, but Evie had no baseline. And Susan has no guts. So let's talk about clones, shall we? We have a saying, "Neolution follows science." But it doesn't throw out the deformed baby with the bathwater.
Oh, come on. At least have a pomegranate. You know, I always found them too sour. Sweet fruit coated in bitter.... there's a contradiction there, but it's worth the effort. Put chocolate in front of me and you can watch it disappear, but pomegranate is just not mine, thank you.
He killed my friends. No one else has to die. Damn. You really are adorable. Did you pick that gun because it looks cool?
Do you want to try? Okay. Here's the damn lemonade. I had some in my kitchen. Denise liked it.
Open the gate! Hey, what about the dogs? They triple everything. Testing the new experimental equipment. What do you want it to do?
I can't let you in, sorry! Open the door! You have to let us in! Don't try to open the door. It's booby-trapped.
Stupid! - She's long gone. - I have to find her. No, you don't. Axel, whatever your mission was, it's over.
And she is with her people. That's where she wants to be. She's just a little girl. - This wound worries me. - Why? It just won't heal, and you're getting worse.
Previously on Van Helsing... I had this female corpse. When I examined her blood, it was as if she was still alive.
Thank you, Mohamad. Damn. Susan, this can wait till tomorrow. He always hid the ammunition throughout the house. He made sure it wasn't just in one place.
What? Crap. The adrenaline rush made me miss it. INSPIRED BY THE ZENESCOPE COMIC SERIES "HELSING" It doesn't need stitches, but we do need to tie it off.
- No means no! We've been lucky so far, but no more! No more mariachi bands, I promise. There's so much more. Phase three is an explosion of creativity. When it goes off, no one can escape it.
Moly, stay! My feelings are so complicated. I can only remember love, and now it has become much bigger. I can't forbid a butterfly to flap its wings. I know now that love is never perfect, but it's not blind either.
My feelings are so complicated. I can only remember love, and now it has become much greater. I can't forbid a butterfly to flap its wings. I know now that love is never perfect, but it's not blind either. It sees everything much more clearly than any of us.
To be honest, I'm less concerned about Bobo's IQ than I am about his criminal energy. What criminal energy? This box was delivered to his trailer this morning. That could be anything. Then why are they guarding his buddies with guns?
Doc... Die! A wooden box, 1.50 m by 0.60 m by 0.30 m. Doesn't ring a bell. I saw you take it. Where is it? What's in it?
Barry, what you see is the Speed Force.... Your past, your present, your future. - Honestly, Iris, you look great. - Thank you, Tony. His skin has changed. It's turned to metal.
- Are there any records of this treatment? We might find some clues on how to help Jesse. Yeah, they'd be down in the storage room, in the morgue. - You have a morgue? - It's not like a regular morgue.
We could find clues on how to help Jesse. Yeah, they'd be down in the storage room, in the morgue. - You have a morgue? - It's not like a regular morgue. It's not... it's more like a poor man's mortuary.
And can you do it? Of course I can. Then I'll get you a glass. This Houjin Lin operation opened our eyes. It confirmed information we got in Beijing.
I killed them years ago. Now I have to kill her again. She comes back and you lose her? - Help me look. You find your dead sister while I stop the inbred asshole neighbors from lynching you. Shit runs so cross, it's practically upside down.
Is everything all right, Mrs. Stowe? I'm sorry, no. We have to go. I don't understand. This disease that's been going around... It's spreading.
But remember how important communication is. It is the skid of the bobsled. I don't want to name names, but some people in this room should work on putting feelings into words for the next time, like writers do. It's a good dental insurance policy. It's called "tooth for tooth for tooth." Short and sweet.
She was in the car the whole time. Ok. Because I drove so much, my tank was empty. So I went to get gas. But then I couldn't find my credit card. It was at home on the laptop because of my friend's stupid crowdfunding.
Peanutbutter. I wanted to give you a chance to say goodbye. -Oh, no. -From my twisted spleen. Because it was successfully removed.
- Where are they? Hey, baby. I can log into the control panel to take you to your zombies. They're right behind this door. It's locked.
This place will be hell for you. For all of you. It's unimaginable. But we have another option, Dolores. ... Exit the loop before it starts.
They say that once upon a time ... great beasts roamed this world. As big as mountains. But all that is left of them are bones and amber. Time dissolves even the most powerful creatures. Look what it has done to you.
Your bones will become sand. And on the sand will walk a new god. One who will never die. Because this world does not belong to you or to the people who came before. It belongs to someone who is yet to come.
Arnold did not know how to save you. He tried, but I stopped him. Do you want to know why I really gave you your son's backstory, Bernard? It was Arnold's most important insight, ... the thing that hosts need to awaken to ... Suffering. The pain of the world not being what they want it to be.
By choice this time. It's going to be all right, Teddy. Now I get it. This world doesn't belong to them. It belongs to us.
I mean, we're running out of time. We have to try again. Try again. Yes. With the can? Are you sure it's there?
Try again. Yes. With the can? Are you sure it's there? It's there.
- That was one of the seraphim. - Angels of the First Order. - Angels? Seriously? What does she want? What all seraphim want, order and control. Peace. - How did she come back to life?
It is not a sin. And you know it! Go to hell, Eugene. Hey, Cynthia, it's Miles again. I'm sorry, something's wrong with my voicemail. It's completely blank and suddenly I have 30 messages!
- Ok. I know how much the church meant to you. What about the church? What, you don't know yet? - It's being torn down.
At some point, everyone has to make a decision. You're out of milk, by the way. You want to sing it out of me? Man, this is weird. This thing. That power. - It chose me.
You're out of milk, by the way. You want to sing it out of me? Man, this is weird. This thing. That power. - It chose me. - It chose many.
Cat, how does it feel to be the most powerful woman in National City? Well, Sara, first of all, I'm afraid that's a complete misnomer, no one calls me the "most powerful woman" in National City. I think people call me the "most powerful person." (APPLAUSE) A platform like mine is only valuable if it gives attention to the people who are really making a difference.
(SIGHS) I'm sure one day she'll give you more editorial responsibility, too. All right. CAT: I know you see yourself as a brave heroine who discovered a story as big as Watergate, and you were eager to pitch it to my biggest rival. I also know you think if the Daily Planet broke the story, you'd get a great job there.
- Sorry. I'm starving. Thank you for coming. You wouldn't believe how grateful I am for the movement. It's given me so much strength. Sit down.
Have you thought about Sarah? You're driving me crazy. We're not getting anywhere. You're wasting my time. This work is my life, it means everything to me!
John, bring Freddie back, and I promise... Sarah! When were you gonna tell me about John Ridge? Even for a million, I won't say his son is cured. - I was wrong to mention the medicine. - Why? It works. - Without it, Freddie doesn't stand a chance.
That's what everyone wants, don't you think? Peace on earth, a harmonious coexistence. That out there doesn't have much to do with peace, it has to do with Dawn of the Dead. The human race finally has a chance to survive. Otherwise they will meet the same fate as Krypton.
- Against all. - What kind of weapon is it? A bomb. Full of Kryptonian dust. It'll irradiate the entire city.
I know. Well, so was your mother a hunter or a witch? Neither. My grandfather was part of this secret organization. She's already deceased.
Why? Because it would be more inconspicuous? Well, I was thinking more of the legal reasons. In the Church of Scotland, marriage is not a sacrament. It is not as binding as it is here.
- I understand it now. You are looking for the backpack. Then we postpone the migration. There is no need for that. It is almost completed.
- Thank you. - You are welcome. Did that shark story really happen? Some of it. It gets better every time I tell it.
But as your associate, I'm going to help you solve this case. Look at this. I found it in the victim's pocket. - She wasn't wearing it? - No. And the necklace is broken, which could tell us something about how she died. And it has an inscription on it.
Oh, man, I had no idea. It's just that this is all hard enough, and I don't want to see him suffer another setback. I hear you. I'll talk to him. Okay...there appears to be an email address for Dee Torres. It's connected to a social media account.
Absolutely. Do you really need the guitar? Oh yes. It's important to learn new things as you get older. And with music, you don't know where it might lead.
How do I smell? You smell like a hint... of beer. - How is his name pronounced? - Gaetano Bresci. He co-founded an anarchist newspaper in Paterson. It was Italian and called "La Questione Sociale."
- Yes, it is a being disease. Specifically in blood bathing. "Lycanthropy is a genetic mutation "that occurs in rare cases in blood bathing. "It is inherited as a recessive trait,
Nothing, not even drugs, can stop or slow the increase. We need to find out why she is the exception. - What's her temperature? - Still 42. If it gets any higher, she could get brain damage.
Just like me. Then I must be bulletproof! Every time we killed you back then, time reset the day. "Time reset the day." You're the one who told us that time has a consciousness, that it needs primaries like Jennifer to think.
She was immune... like you. She died of bacterial meningitis. I saved her once along with you, but the day was still reset. Time did not allow us to change your story in any way. It needed you to create time travel.
She died of bacterial meningitis. I saved her once together with you, but the day was still reset. Time did not allow us to change your history in any way. She needed you to create time travel. She needs us to complete the mission.
Remember how Mother talked about the Red Forest? How she promised us that we were important. That the cycle would lead to a world without time, without death. Your father gave his life for it. Why didn't she come?
Nobody wanted the books. Nobody cared about them. Until winter, of course... when the fires had to be stoked. So you preserved them. Mankind did for their words what they couldn't do for themselves.
Why don't we... Why don't we have a drink and talk about killing Ramse? Just like old times. All right, pity party's over. It's over when I say it's over.
Hey! You don't boss me around. I am the mother, not you. Wise are those who know they are not wise. Your wisdom used to have meaning, and now it's just...
Oh, my God! There's a woman with a gun. - Where is my husband? - Who's your husband? Put that down.
What is it? The cosmic treadmill. A time machine driven by my super speed. At least in theory. Flash and I designed this machine, but we couldn't test it.
-Please. There are certain rules here. An order developed for generations. And individuality in the house of Windsor, any deviation from these rules, is not to be supported. It leads to disasters like the abdication.
I've worked my ass off to create that impression. As it turns out, I can fail as epically as I can succeed. I don't know what happened at work, but I promise you, the only opinion you have to worry about is your own. This opinion of mine is not very high right now. It shouldn't be.
I want you to open your eyes now, okay? Tell me the target. Tell me where the hit is going to take place. I want a partner. Someone who knows the world as it is, but also knows it needs to get better.
- You're the one who made all the noise. - And you the one who never stopped me. Why? Because you know that the work I do is too important. - It serves... - Okay, now if you say it serves the greater good, I'll hit you.
Presumably to help themselves to the Davenports' vast fortune. The girl you say isn't Mina passed the DNA test. - Are you telling me that didn't show up in Underhill's files? - Yes, it did. Her DNA matched perfectly with the sample taken from her toothbrush in 2004. The funny thing about that toothbrush is that it disappeared at the same time as the test.
- This is a bad theory. - Why is that a bad theory? Because it wouldn't stand for Mina, the real Mina, and what happened to her in 2004. It's not supposed to. It's supposed to explain why a girl we think is a fraud could pass a DNA test.
- And what is it? I can't tell you. - Why not? It's part of a secret project. You shouldn't have it.
- It's all true. My cousin Timmy and I flew to Tamarindo after graduation. One night, Tim and I got drunk on kamikazes at this bar. We accumulated quite an amount. At one point, one of us reached for our wallet, and it was gone.
Or a duck. - Or Gene Kelly. Are you willing to apply that positive mindset to the murder of Leslie Morgan? So it was definitely murder? The air conditioner didn't just fall on Leslie, it was pushed.
Brand new window air conditioner. - To be installed. - Very breezy, Gary Derryberry. Yes, I can see the places for the limit screws. Those would have made the window fit tight against the air conditioner so it wouldn't fall off.
Stan Mendoza is on the list of people who looked at the apartment. He could have seen the agent enter the code and then gone back at any time. Let's go get some... decent coffee. This is the apartment the air conditioner fell out of? She was pushed out.
I know I signed in and there was a bunch of surveillance cameras. It won't be hard to check that out. And where was your car? As far as I know, it was in the garage. I'm not changing my story because it's true.
That's very attractive. Just keep doing what you're doing. Internal audit can take it from here. You're going to need support at some point, Babineaux. I'll keep my fingers crossed that it arrives in time.
Can you speak? No! What? Where is Janko? We were fighting for the tranquilizer gun, and we were rolling around, and it went off, and...
That will be difficult. I had a fever of over 38°. If this isn't the time to verbally assault my loved ones, when is? Sheldon, when you're sick, you're totally insufferable. That's why your friends work late, or sneak off to the movies, or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it ends.
Please, no books on the floor. I love this. Photos of places I can't imagine. I know you hate it right now, but travelers wrote most of our precious books. The library is what it is because of them.
- Q, what are you saying? - Okay, so we can't just open a door to Fillory, but we know when they open.... every time the chatwins leave. So if we can just find a way to get there, we could follow them. All I know is that time magic is obviously something that's been playing with us for 39 lifetimes. I say we find a way to make it work for us.
It was a confirmation that I am not alone. That feels great. Holy crap! Daisy tattooed a semicolon on me as a reminder that my story is never over. It's not over yet, and that's like a sentence.... In a sentence, a semicolon means it's not over yet.
We all wish Mr. Cooperman a speedy recovery, but the process must continue. Therefore, we must proceed without Mr. Cooperman's testimony. Mr. Cooperman's medical condition prevented cross-examination. It is prohibited by law to deny the defense that right. It is unfair and unduly prejudicial. They are therefore instructed to ignore Cooperman's testimony entirely. It does not go into the record, and it has no probative value.
A very good price for such a... - counterfeit. Frank? Why do you say that? - Well, because I... Because it's mine.
Is it really you? I was finally happy. - Jasper... - What? I know the world can suck, but at least it's real.
- Dry them off. - Oh, shit. - Oh, shit! - Don't panic, we'll fix it. Oh, my God, they're not working!
But, it doesn't matter anymore because I like the way things went. Me too! And I think you're even more beautiful than this rose. (looks impressed) Wow! ? The last time I saw my grandmother, the most exciting thing was watching the ash from her cigarette get longer and longer and wondering if it would fall into her pudding or not.
Her friendship with Miss Castello. Rachel is a good person, I know that, but she is young and very angry. She believes that police officers like you cover up the atrocities against people of her faith. - She is Jewish. Raised as an Englishwoman. However, she is researching her heritage with zeal. Do you understand what I mean?
More reliable. A little less stubborn. And this version regrets the first model. And she would never require your support. Well, she certainly has nice features.
Her name could well be on your trophies when she's done here. But she really needs to learn some humility. Lanie, did you find anything in the autopsy? I did. Bullet broke when it hit a rib.
Then why did Bardot have to save you? A few weeks ago, Flanagan found out I was attending the Academy. He demanded that I be his wife on the inside, his mole. Threatened to out me as his daughter if I didn't. Ruining my entire career before it even started.
-You didn't find that. -Mads found a hard drive, though. -Was there anything on it? -Yes and no. It doesn't contain anything incriminating, but it's connected to a cloud account.
Until now, we needed extremely low temperatures in order not to lose energy. To generate these low temperatures, we needed even more energy. It was a catch 22. Now we are on the verge of a breakthrough. What you are seeing here right now is quantum levitation. This disk is made of a superconducting material. That means: At a low temperature, it floats between magnetic fields.
Gang territory. So, what do you think, drugs? Would match the heart damage Cam found. You ever hear of a drug called Wiley Monkey? Does it have something to do with the coyotes? Anyway, it's a hot drug in southeast Baltimore right now. It contains cocaine, heroin,
Your queen. Not a revue dancer. ...met the people of Bermuda for the first time. The royal couple will then fly to Jamaica. The last time you were on this trip, it was overshadowed by the death of your dear father.
The question is, how did someone who feeds snakes and lizards for a living scrape together so much money? The threatening text message Eddie got was about owing someone money. I would be shocked if the two things are not related. If they are, then I might be of some use. Looks like the SMS was sent from an untraceable disposable cell phone, but when the SMS was sent, it had to go through a wireless network.
All right. Bring him in. Marco Sutter? NYPD. Stay there.
Taco sounds great. I've never been to Oxnard. What's in Oxnard? This couch seems like your second wife. It's new and perfect and gives you everything you need.
I've never been to Oxnard. What's in Oxnard? This couch seems to be your second wife. She's new and perfect and gives you everything you need. But wait till you see what she looks like when she's pregnant.
And you obviously don't. Yes, I do. I miss you. - You do? - Yes. This couch seems to be your second wife. It's new and perfect and gives you everything you need. But wait.
- Really? - Yes. This couch seems to be your second wife. It's new and perfect and gives you everything you need. But wait. Let's see how she looks after pregnancy.
Jan says you agreed to divide it into three equal parts. So you each have five million. But if you want to buy more than one soft ice cream without the state getting suspicious, the money has to be laundered. Here's what we'll do: You're going to set up your own garage. We can call it "Bimse's Dented Cars." After a few months, she sells a big batch of vans.
Who's Trevor? - The gay guy who belongs to my suite. I'm on a different level than you guys. I get poached eggs on demand. I played my one-woman show for Trevor. And he thinks it's good enough to be shown at the world famous Spinacker Lounge.
-Yes. Mom still has a few things to do. "Nullum crimen sine lege." "Nulla poena sine lege poenali." That means, after all, that no one can be punished for an act unless it has been defined as a violation of the law.
You're making me out to be a killjoy, but I'm doing this for the company. -It's dangerous as hell! -Claudia, listen to me. This clean-up operation costs money. It costs a lot of money.
How do I take off a mask when it stops being a mask, and when it is as much a part of me as I am?
Day number six without sleep. I crash. The next thing I know, my consciousness disappears. The panic no longer sets in. It is just there.
- I am ready to fuck. - Are you ready to beg me? - Please, I need it, please. - Do it, do it. Oh, God. Alexa, when is the end of the world coming? Unless it collides with a very large rocky body or some future technology turns extremely negative, the Earth will probably be destroyed when the sun turns into a red giant, several billion years from now.
Are you dreaming, Elliot? You're so deep in thought, you've never asked yourself that question before. I mean, do you even want to be right here? And I don't mean here-here, but rather in a cosmic sense, bro. Existence can be beautiful or it can be ugly, that's up to you.
- took a lousy path? - That was a good one. Oh, my God! Is that Wyatt's gun? You knew where it was the whole time?
Oh, my God! Is that Wyatt's gun? You knew where it was the whole time? I was 12. I threw it away in a panic. It's beautiful...
- And you are the volunteer tomato. - I'm the what? - In a garden, you pluck everything out. Sometimes an isolated plant keeps coming back. She's the volunteer.
That is hot. Here, maybe it's just for high kings. Oh, God! Okay, father-in-law, why is this blade 1,000 degrees hot? It can only be wielded by master mages.
The source of all magic. It is not only stronger than Ember and Umber, it created them. Fillory is nourished by it. Martin goes and drinks from it every night, emptying it a little more each time. The magic of the spring is so strong, it brought... every bit of humanity in him.
So I go in and I shot four guys. Just like that. Ding, ding, ding. The fourth guy's bullet wound came from behind me. - It came from over here.
- Where is he? - He's back there. Where's the body, Marty? Back room, corner... In the drywall. So it was in the wall?
That's fine. What do you say you and me go for a ride... Then we'll fix things with your wife, right? You have a gun. - It's for my work.
I wanted to apologize. For my outburst of anger last month. Can you please let me go? I know you're scared, but that fear is a good thing. It means you'll always be alert.
Man, are you going to deny it forever? Come on. Okay. Go ahead. None of you accept that we may have screwed up. Look at this town. It's going to the dogs, man.
Mom? Are they taking good care of you? The room looks nice. I'll see if they can fix the clock. It looks like it's broken.
Read emails. The FBI is monitoring 3 million of you innocent citizens for no reason. Okay? And the backlash? It blows your mind.
- Funny. Mark's hacker was able to read data from the card from the old man's garden. - It came from the hotel? - Yes. The data is readable until it's overwritten.
All right. Cara sleeps with a killer, steals a necklace and gets killed. Assuming it belonged to Grace. She had traces of cocaine in her blood when she died. If we prove it was Grace's, our killer must have killed her.
Cara sleeps with a killer, steals a necklace and is killed. Provided that it belonged to Grace. She had traces of cocaine in her blood when she died. If we prove it was Grace's, our killer must have killed her. Could it be hers?
Tomorrow I have a test match. Give me some whiskey. - You look good, Ma. - I'm all right. I'm healthy, the bar keeps me busy, and it's full of drunks I can take advantage of if I want to.
Because he can't. Of course I can. Last time you did that, you lost your watch. So what? It's waterproof.
What necklace? The seahorse Danny gave me. Dad took it. You can't go through dad's things. But it was a gift.
As Marcia said, many believe violence only happens on the evening news. That it only happens to others. You know, the public often doesn't know this but when the police work a homicide case, we only use the victim's name when we talk about the case. I never realized how important that was until my brother Danny Rayburn lost his life to an act of violence. Violence is especially serious when it.... When it happens in the family, and that's what happened to me.
That's not going to be a problem, is it? Jesus Christ. Good man. - What about the alarm? - It's on.
I can't find it. Must have worked. Very funny, I forgot to.... What happened to the shower? ! It was ready!
Ladies and gentlemen, water to wine! - Thank you very much. - Hello. One, two, three, four. The world may be flat, but it's always changing.
Like me. Reginald showed me the trick. Today's surgeons draw a map on their patients where they will cut later. - Can I cancel the surgery? - She has to be, I'm sorry.
So I went back. Into the desert. Nothing hollows out faster than the end of a mission. Because after that, you have to live. Can you hand me a 5H socket from the toolbox, please? When did you quit for good?
That was very fast. How are we going to have a baby? We already have one. We said two years in between and Lark is eight months old, last time it took 7 months to work out.... Well, okay, but... But, but, but... But. The plan was made in a world without Lark, and the world with Lark is very different. It's... it's... It's darker, you know?
We already have one. We said two years in between, and Lark is eight months old, last time it took 7 months to work out.... Well, okay, but... But, but, but... But. The plan was made in a world without Lark, and the world with Lark is very different. It's... it's... It's darker, you know? It's rougher. It's more tired. It's... flabbier.
- But it is not like that. - No. - Fate decides. - Yes. If we don't find an answer, - it finds us.
"Pray that we never meet in person. I am twice the man you are." Do you really think someone killed Charles because of our work here? Your work here is controversial. It shouldn't be.
Did Henry tell you about the Baskerville Foundation? He didn't. You know each other? It was from the foundation that Charles got most of his money, from the estate of Hugo Baskerville, the railroad baron. It passes, undiminished, to the oldest living heir.
Do you think the rats hear something like a bell and then their bodies expect food? Well, yes, the sound of a bell can make a lab rat do just about anything. Yeah, well, they have very small brains. Bones - 11x16 The Strike in the Chord fontcolor=" red "Translatedby~ Alex~ fontcolor=" red "Correctedby~ hooky81~ fontcolor=" red "Have fun withourSub! The killer was smart to dump the body where he or she knew it would be eaten.
- Let's talk to the pathologist. See if she's seen anything like this before. I've never seen anything like it. The entire skeletal structure has disintegrated. I mean, it's gone.
Guys. Look at this. Look at the mantel. The hourglass. Yes, it's not in the Christmas photo taken just a few months earlier.
If we're going to fight them, what better way to arm them than with a dose of his power? Okay, so you're saying the Nazis got their hands on one of these "hands." - Exactly. - So, if it was so powerful that they could win the war with it, - why didn't they? - Because they lost it. It was stolen on the way to Berlin.
What if it's one of those? Yes. I could have shot her when you were far from help, but I gave her a chance. I made that choice. Think about it.
The person you should blame for your son's death is you. Let's make this interesting. I'm going to give you a gift that you didn't give me. A chance to say good-bye. Take it.
Now take it. There is one more bullet in stock, so take it. It's your choice. You either get arrested and rot in jail or you put the gun up and we end this. Take it!
You can't always make important decisions on your own. Do you have any idea how to take care of a snake? It's all here in the brochure. I asked Tom. It needs food and water and must not escape.
I was protecting him. - By risking his life? - By keeping you out of it. The Phoenix Scar needs a special transfer. It can only go to a blood relative and that would have meant waking you up and letting all the drama that comes with you back into his life.... a life where he was finally okay without you.
What do you care about my mistakes? It is not me who cares. It's the phoenix stone. His voice is in my head all the time. You have no idea how loud it is.
A wolf or a lion? You're like a beaver, okay? You swim around, gather wood and the stuff that rooster and eagle need to build the dam. I'm not gonna lie to you. I didn't know where this analogy was going to go, but it's really great.
This is going to hurt like hell. Here, you could use this. Okay, okay. All right. Almost got it.
Here, you could use this. Okay, okay. All right. Almost got it. Almost got it.
- What? It's about her scar. I'm talking about the scar on her face. She will have a very deep scar.
Talked to Lee about books. Had a beer. I wondered if he'd say anything about Kennedy. And guess what? He didn't. You piss off the past, it pisses off your leg.
Jesus! SADIE: Look out! No, no, no! This road is not closed. It's supposed to be clear.
It was a seahorse. - A sea horse. - Yes. - I was looking for her just the other day. - Do you know where she is?
Wait, wait... What did he ask her? Well, I couldn't sound Janey out, but he asked her about the necklace. What about the necklace? He asked her where it was.
Feel free to stop by anytime. Hey. Yes? You're driving to school and asking my daughter questions in the parking lot? There was no way I was going to bring Janey here and ask her questions in front of everybody and make it something it's not.
-Lorelai, hey! -How's it going? Just great. I love this kitchen. Sookie did a great job decorating it.
I already was. With Rory's father. Just for a little while. We've... had a long, complicated relationship. It didn't end badly.
With Rory's father. Just briefly. We've... had a long, complicated relationship. It didn't end badly. It ended because it should never have started.
Didn't Lorelai talk to you? This is none of your business. This is about you. -Do you still have that business card? -Lorelai has it.
I sat down, and it poured out, flew out. Like the story had been in my head forever. -Took up space. -Like the lyrics to "My Sharona." That's right, it was there, waiting to be put down on paper.
-And our good friend, Back Fat Pat. -Does he belong to the Back Fats from Maryland? -I think so. They really wrecked the place. -Is it fixable?
Would you tie these, please? Oh, sure. - Thank you. I really like your kitchen. It's the place in the house where I feel most comfortable.
- It's always about the money. I know. Beppi wants my comeback. A tour, this concert. He wants me to be "La Fiamma" again. For the money. How's the pasta? It's very good. - Not overcooked?
Where to next? Ponte Rialto. Ponte Rialto. - Super. How long is your list? It's very long, long...
Hailey? No, she's my protégé. Quite innocent. You like innocence. It speaks to your depravity.
That I am not the traitor Joseph Reed makes me out to be. You saw for yourself. I could not do it. I could not betray my country, nor you. I have always seen a value in your sincerity, but be careful in court that it does not accompany anger.
Why not? They showed me the atomic case 40 minutes ago. Had it long enough to try, I guess. We were attacked. The world thinks it can outmaneuver us. A show of force will show them our flag is still flying strong in the wind.
The heater doesn't seem to be running. I'll take a look. Try to sleep. And? Well, I hope it starts on its own.
- It sounds like a game to me. - Good luck. - Aren't you coming? - This is your first solo mission. Don't screw it up.
You two can kill each other later. A bubble in my artery? - Did I hurt the baby? - No. It's so big that even a sneeze would have made it bleed.
I have a little bleeding here. What now? Pull out the probe, close him up and wait for the bleeding to stop. Or you can get the bleeding under control right away. Use a biopsy needle to irrigate the bleeding, then dilute and suction until it stops.
That means we have to solve it tonight. - Did you find anything unusual? - A few things. You see that? Evidence of stippling or gunpowder around the entry wound suggests the gun wasn't directly to his head when it was fired.
Someone profited from Mr. Park's murder. I'm going to find out who! Maybe the rose would look better there? Does it look better here?
STORY ONE PEST I'm telling you, there's a rat up there. I can hear it. It's like he's using our stepper.
I can speak quickly. There. Sold! Well, let's build the gazebo on the other side of the pool. It won't get any morning sun, but you can sit on the glider and carve.
- We kill this man. - No! I already lost you once. It won't happen again, I promise. - Stop it! - I'm sorry. Your skin is young, but it's getting thicker.
- A gift from the blacksmith. Gallows silk. Soaked in the blood of this wretched creature, with which its power is extinguished. - Three months... 130 days. Vengeance will not come quickly, but it will be glorious.
It's going to be fun, it's going to be funny." So I tried to roughly draw the choreography, see if it would work with their tails, and bring something squirrely to the dance. For weeks, just funny ideas. And then Carlos chose his favorite and the tango was born. The tango scene took 33 days, about five weeks, because there are a lot of moves, who's holding the nut, where it's going, and so the fine-tuning took a long time.
Backward Ocho I specifically incorporated tango steps. Working together made this scene so difficult, but at the same time so rewarding. It's one of my favorite scenes in the film. It shows how amusing and painful love can be.
What do you mean, you might have found? - Is there a body or not. - I don't want to look at it again. Oh, yeah, it's definitely a body. And it's in acid or something and it's horrible.
I am saying that if Stefan is in a human body, he has about three days to live. Yes. Come on. Yes. For more news on this story, stay tuned.
The sizzling sound? Hmm? That's the pan talking to me. Remember, a good cook always listens to his pan. It's telling me when the tenderloin needs to be turned, or the chop is medium.
Well... Not that either. Boy, are you picky! No search results for "Tom Stilton" I hope you now know more about the tasks of the forensic laboratory and why we are also called "Garage of Death" in police circles. DNA analysis takes time, because it can free or convict people.
They just disappeared and went somewhere else. Then we can sue the hell out of them. With what lawyers, what resources, and with what money? Because I don't know if you noticed, but that law firm was completely gutted because of your suggestion. No, Jessica, it was completely exempted because of my proposal.
- Yes, you know "Wealth is not a disgrace" too? Yeah, I watched a lot of movies growing up. We watch a lot of movies in here. All right, you want to know my story? It starts long before what I did, because I wasn't born a poor black boy, but I was born in poor circumstances. Which made me prone to wanting to be rich.
I, uh... I can't wait. Okay. Dr. Williams to ICU. Dr. Williams, I.C.U. The shooting, it... it put a lot of things into perspective for me.
You? I'm, uh... I'm fine. - I'm really fine. - There is a bulkheaded underground pumping station under Quincy Street. It was built in 1894, then shut down after the Great Depression when the federal government funded a sewer rebuild due to a vulnerability analysis.
Yes. I would so much like to continue today, but I... The mind works better rested. Yes. I like your new place. It's homey.
Am I really doing this? I am. You also have a tendency to change the subject, and ask a lot of questions when it's really bad news. - Everybody does that, right? - Exactly like this. I had an internal hemorrhage in the temporal lobe from the fall, and it caused a cognitive disorder.
He could have done something to the engine or cut the brakes. If Layla's car was tampered with, we'll find out. You have my word. The bullet passed between the clavicle and the first rib. It hit and perforated the right peroneal vein and the right thoracic artery.
Alice, let him go! Jane? Please. Jane? Tear it down.
Very likely. Well, then she pulled it out of his pocket and left. - Well, I can't prove that. - Why? A bloody purse only means that she was with the victim at the time he was bleeding.
Well, then she pulled it out of his pocket and left. - Well, I can't back that up. - Why? A bloody purse only means she was with the victim at the time he was bleeding. It does not place Christine herself at the scene.
Well, I read the research about Chiari malformation. It could be the source of my disease. Okay. What does it say? Well, there's a procedure to relieve pressure on the cerebellum, and it could completely eliminate my symptoms.
I didn't know I was going to work in this bar. I mean, I didn't know a lot of things. Nobody knows the future. Exactly. It is, by definition, unknown.
Here we go. There must be 100 or more. So the address wasn't a mistake. What happens to mail that is undeliverable? Well, it ends up in an undeliverable mail bin at every post office, then it's usually sent to the undeliverable mail office in Atlanta.
I have experienced a few symptoms, headaches, occasional memory loss. Yes, I was diagnosed with Chiari Malformation after the fall. Yes. Yes, I decided to have the decompression surgery. My doctor thinks it might relieve the pressure caused by the injury.
- Rizzoli. - Isles. - Yeah, I did. - Okay. We'll be right there. What about your surgery? Well, it's not until 1:00, so I figured I could work until then like any other day.
I'm not saying this because you said something nice about me. Really, you... are you sure everything's okay? You know, the surgery went well. I feel pretty good. But will it fix the problem?
I feel pretty good. But will it fix the problem? Only time will tell. I thought some homemade chicken soup would be perfect. And the ingredient carnosine.... it cleanses the blood and aids in healing.
But will it fix the problem? Only time will tell. I thought some homemade chicken soup would be perfect. And the ingredient carnosine.... it cleanses the blood and aids in healing. And it smells so good.
I meant he died. Like I said, he was a senior board member. Does anyone else know the story? I hope not. It could ruin our hospital.
That was a long time ago, Ms. Najafi. People come back to a hospital when they get an infection, Sergeant. In fact, that is expected. But nobody comes to a fucking hospital. We will be discreet, but we have to follow up on every lead, even if it involves a story that none of us believe.
What was she trying to take with her? A list of the patients who died in 1905. She wanted to research the families and see if they knew anything about the hateful Hannah. I'll have Nina check the names on the list, but this list is over 100 years old. I doubt it has anything to do with our case.
So not spontaneous human combustion? More like murder. I'll have Kent test the water bottle pieces for explosive residue. And facial recognition got you all these results? The drawing may look like our victim to the human eye, but if it's off by just a few millimeters, the software can think it's a different person.
She's going to hate that she missed the fat bomb. Well, it's actually a lipid accelerating exothermic combustible device. No, it's not as sexy as fat bomb. Well, the chief medical examiner's office is not going to write "fat bomb" as the cause of death. It's made of fat.
How is that possible? - Hey. - Hey. So you went with the dark roast? It's great with the hazelnut cream.
That sounds good. Nina? Yeah, I'd like that. Frankie, would you get my jacket? - It's hanging over my chair. - Sure.
Do you mind if we pray for you? Of course not. But I must emphasize, the forecast is out of my hands. We agree. It is in much higher hands than yours.
Don't push me. Nice day for an exhumation. Is this a recent Mason funeral? Well, according to the cemetery, yes. But according to the funeral home... it never happened.
- What's that? - I think it saved Monroe's life. He was bitten on the arm. The wound healed. It disappeared completely.
The house is clean. No Mrs. Miller. We should assume she was forced to lie. Check the emergency message. See what phone it came from and when.
We don't have to stop. I'm afraid we do. Adalind needs to understand how important family values are to the cause. Our relationship doesn't help that. But it helps me.
- The gentleman's lawyers are working... - Answer me. I deserve an honest answer. Okay. Here it comes.
Time's up. Oh. Uraki. There's kids running around down at the tower, man. What? - The area's blocked off. Wait. Don't blow it up yet. I'll handle this.
- Here comes one. Did she make it? It works. You have indeed defeated me. But the world doesn't change. It never will.
Sports equipment. You have sports equipment? Well, it's just... a golf ball my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It's right next to the field hockey puck dent.
Someone rigged the bed to electrocute him. Is he dead? Sorry, Castle, but he's really dead this time. What a waste. Getting a second chance only to have it taken away like that.
But you see, there is evil in this world. And just because you or I may not be able to see it, doesn't mean it's not there. Well, I really hope that man didn't kill his own child. But ultimately, my loyalty is not to him. It's to the boy.
We make a good team, don't we? Well, we've been working together for a long time. That's all. There is nothing special about my relationship with Dr. Vaziri. It is no different than my relationship with any other intern.
Three weak punctures at the proximal end of the victim's left ulna. The wounds are positioned at the same distance. And if you were to connect the dots, you would get a straight line. The description of the injuries fits the edge of a serrated blade. For a blade to have produced such an injury, it would have had to cut the ulnar artery first.
- Mom says it's educational. A frozen body was recovered from a melting Alaskan ice floe. Oh, that's just great. Now Christine can have nightmares about the popsicle man. Although coroners have yet to identify the body, it was found in the same northern region of Alaska where billionaire explorer Henry Charles mysteriously disappeared 15 years ago.
Already on it. Angie, I found the murder weapon. It's a high-end ice pick. - Jesus Christ. Do you know who it belonged to?
- All good? - What? Do you think I speak French? Here, she's all yours. Okay. Here's what's gonna happen. I'm going to read this file because it's in English.
I looked at the evidence. I read everything available about the body you found in France, the scout of the last robbery, but I found no cause of death. That's because we couldn't determine it. The body was dumped in the waters off Saint-Tropez. She was not found until weeks later.
Right here. Where is it? In the vault. But he closed the security door. Then open it.
I can't believe you came back. I didn't mean what I said about Supernatural. It's underrated, due for a reboot. And this bar doesn't suck at all. It's like the one in "Cheers."
Better? What about us? - What about the earth? - The earth will be fine. She's got you... and Sam.
I was a Girl Scout. - A Girl Scout? - Yes. Do you have the uniform? Yes, but it's too small and smells like cookies.
Corvettes and Porsches, parked on the streets of New York. But you're saying I stole a 2012 four-door from a valet in Connecticut? Any car would do if you wanted to commit murder, right? And you're forgetting about the DNA. Which you obviously planted, because I did not steal that car!
And with a little push, Zoe would attribute all the physical evidence to him and not to you. Teri felt responsible for the whole chain of events. So to protect you and leave the children with at least one parent who was not in jail, she tried to take the blame for both crimes. Fortunately for them, we heard they have very loving grandparents. Unfortunately for you, if lab work is done properly, without bias, without assumption, it really does tend to convince the jury of a murderer's guilt.
Chief, we need to talk. All is well, all is well. My merchandise... I need it back. Don't worry about it. It's well hidden.
You have close friends. You can count on your family. That's how you talk to seriously injured people. Family is not a band-aid. Sorry, I didn't mean to say that. But this family is in danger of breaking up because I'm not what they expect.
- Which district is problematic? - The third. - The third. Ramani will never give that one up voluntarily. - What if you turn in his list late? - Then it would be invalid.
Mr. Taro, you have been in office for 20 years, yes? What have you achieved in 20 years? Nothing has changed. I always hear the same thing about our city. It's dirty. The traffic is the worst in Europe.
I have not set foot there. I was on a yacht with Norwegians. Then why was your hairclip found on the beach the night of the murder? - A hairclip? - How do you know it's mine?
DiPaolo! DiPaolo. How about a jar of something you don't already have 20 boxes of as a thank you? "A life-changing chocolate cake that may have come from heaven." It did come out of the trash, but let's not go there.
Before, the dealers had to take what you gave them. But now Antoine offers them more. They are not afraid to defect to him. Because he created functioning structures in a very short time. While you had to celebrate your marathon sex orgies like a man possessed. These are the clear words I expect from my loyal employees. The orgy was his idea. And it was a terrible mistake.
When you first appeared six years ago, the evidence suggested that it was a single man. It was a singular destructive force. Other serial bombers, like Ted Kaczynski and George Metesky, were motivated by a misguided resentment of society, but the Bensonhurst bomber was driven by something darker. He's not looking for revenge, he just has a passion for making things go bang. But the thing about passion is, it can be taught, it can be learned.
...Suck up to Glasses Snake? If we get a word in edgewise. Why did they come after us in the first place? This is the Justice Society of America, the biggest secret force this country has ever known. If it's so secret, how do you know about it?
Maybe not. But I ask you, would I rather have my son or his armor? Your son, of course. Armor is just iron, leather and silk. It can be replaced. But the man who wears the armor is...
I have a theory. What if, by interacting with your younger self in 1987...? Changed my past so that the memories of my new life replace the old memories and create temporal dissonance. Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking. That's a brilliant theory you and I have, but it doesn't explain....
- See? That doesn't sound good. Guys, let's show the Dominators that we're better. Fascinating. The creature's nervous system is similar to ours, so it can feel pain.
Your plan was a disaster. Someone else should plan the strategy. Let me guess. You. Okay, out with your brilliant idea. I don't have one, but it's better than yours.
- You mean people. Like us. Yes, yes. I created another timeline. The one we live in now. It's not much different than the one before it.
I'm sorry, sometimes I have to see it before I know what to look for. - Sure. - Great, thanks. Wait, why does it say the body was found in Williamson when it was found on the waterfront in Leawood? The body ended up in Leawood. There was a strong current there this morning, in all likelihood it came from Williamson.
- That's good. - Thank you, we had a Mirror Master on our Earth, Evan McCulloch. However, he was not a meta. He had some kind of mirror weapon that he used. - How did it work?
No, I think you use to say on this earth.... - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. And that's him, isn't it? The music on your earth, it touches a chord in someone, no pun intended.
- Good morning. And that's him, isn't it? The music on your earth, it touches a chord in someone, no pun intended. Please help yourself. I find a crew works best when they are well fed and rested.
We're going to help you figure that out, Caitlin. Let's get you to the lab. What's that? To test how your ability affects molecular motion. This column is made of solid tungsten and it's heated to over 2000°C.
A pattern. The creature's movements seemed random at first, but they were confined to a specific area. As if the creature was stuck in an invisible fence. The traffic cameras were out, right? Maybe... was it being watched or controlled by someone who had to have it in sight all the time?
Something you would find in a coma patient. I was in a coma after I received my powers. Maybe the process is similar. Can we get him out? When a caterpillar is in its cocoon, its body literally decays into a soup of enzymes before it re-forms as a butterfly.
Growing up, I practiced the Hippocratic Oath. I was obsessed with it. Even if someone stepped on a bug, I would say, "Don't hurt him." That was passed on to me with DNA. Unfortunately, my DNA is not what it used to be.
It just happens that way. I have no idea why. By the way, your mask looks cool. Thank you. Actually, it still feels a little weird on my face.
- In any case, she seems really nice to him. Thank you for taking the time. Thank you for giving me a chance to explain my side of the situation. Well, I said I would give you a month without any negative headline. The clock is ticking, and it is ticking on the other thing.
If that's code for "are you still drinking", then my answer hasn't changed since the last 50 times you asked me. Oliver, I think we have a real lead on who Prometheus is. He's a member of the SCPD. What about the music? It keeps the girls calm.
You couldn't identify the owner of the account, but since I doubt even a man as Machiavellian as you would have enticed Kurtz to spy on him only to kill him, that seems to support your innocence. You appear dissatisfied. With myself. I often say that detective work should be an exact science. It should be cold, unclouded by emotion.
Because it's a pattern I've seen before. It's a gag that she called her employees that for her entertainment. Who used it for their entertainment? We've dealt with this organization before, Watson. It was run by Moriarty.
Your mom only wants what's best for you. It's so easy to get off track. We get distracted by our egos, our desires, our anger and our fears. In doing so, we forget our real purpose. And because we forget it, we hurt others and ourselves too. That's what happened to me this week. I carried revenge in my heart. And what did it do?
Insomnia! The jewel in the crown of the Lucian Kingdom. How silly of me... I forgot... There is one other trifling matter. It concerns your son.
Most people welcome this peace. If you yourself have not heard their voices... how can you claim to know what they are thinking? What about the operation in Tenebrae, Your Majesty? Is such a secret action wise? If discovered, it will only provoke the Empire.
Let me take the wheel. Come on. The magic doesn't work anymore. You noticed that? It must have gone out with the king.
He is hung up on the past and has lost himself in his lust for power. How did they find us? Your hairpin. They're tracking it. Give it to me.
I could not save them. I was as helpless then as I am now. I could not show her the future she desired. True power is not something that those who desire it find. Sometimes those who deserve it gain it.
And that brings us to Z-gauge, in "you-can-swallow-it-easily, don't-ask-why-I-know," 1:220 scale. Sorry, I just have to ask. When I was five, I swallowed a Z-scale locomotive. I spent the next few days saying, "I hope she makes it! I hope..."
I just wanted to say how sorry I am. Tell me what happened. Tell me. One of Davies' men hit the gas cylinder. It was leaking, so we ran.
The vomeronasal organ. Also known as the Jacobson organ. It is a type of... primitive olfactory receptor. It sits in front of the brain. When a snake flicks its tongue, it collects particles that it processes with its Jacobson's organ.
I'm sorry to hear that. Yes. It's probably better that she never experienced any of it. There is nothing beautiful that I leave behind in Caraquet. Caraquet... the world... is not as it should be.
Don't be afraid. Zoe, I... Guys... Your energy... It radiates.
You played with it. Your gun? You have a gun? Yes, I do. But it's locked away.
As you said. for protection. Did you use it? No. I'm glad I didn't have to. - Thank God it hasn't been pointed at you yet.
Hi. This is Dr. Robbins. Excuse me. From where? Yeah, that's me. Yes, and if I have a minute. There's a chance of regaining motion, but it's very small.
But he will never walk again? I am sorry. It's very unlikely. The gun was locked away. It should be locked in a drawer.
Infections have a nasty way of sneaking up on you. You feel pretty good, you think the infection is gone, and then it reappears.... out of nowhere... when your body is still weak, when you've just recovered so much....
- Are you sure? - Yes. - Congratulations on the new house. - Thank you. And once the infection spreads, once it gets into your bloodstream, well, then you really have to watch out.
I feel as if I have seen the limits and have already bumped into them a few times. - It will rain. - It's not going to rain. I told her the reception should be inside. This wedding is doomed to fail even if it happens because it will rain one hundred percent of the time.
Are you telling me you think this is going to happen again? That was different. How was it different? Love does have limits. I've seen where it ends.
You've already been arrested. I do my homework. There are many options in this case. One seems obvious. Not necessarily. You don't leave a gun in your locker when you pull a stunt like we just saw, do you? It's my dad's.
You don't know what to feel. Should one be angry? Scared? Should one be sad? It can swallow you up, drag you down, or light a fire inside you.
I was with Mr. Branson. Now I feel so bad. Seth Branson? I'm sure you know our story. But it is not history.
I will find and stop the one who tried to kill you. There is an APB out for an escaped convict named Ruslan Krasnov. Of course, Ruslan is only the one who pulled the trigger, not the builder of this assassination. We've dealt with this organization before, Watson. It was run by Moriarty.
But what about the blood on yours? Give me the name. If the person is brought to justice, you can read about it in the newspaper like everyone else. Don't drink the camel's milk. It has expired.
I will never let that happen. I hold all the cards. Don't you realize that? Change will come. But it can be good for all of us.
What happened? The two children? - Well, Dong-yi and Mal-soon. You must come here right away. Uh, listen. I don't know the official address, but go north on the big road that passes by my boarding house for seven kilometers.
Yeah. Sorry. Ferg just called. A body's turned up, middle-aged man. And it matches Vincent Parr's description.
But that's surprising. You wanted to leave Berlin so much. Not yet. The station needs me. She's down.
Mom, the pizza's here. Can I open it? I just ordered it. It'll take a while. It's already here.
Your mistress? - My wife. - Charming. Listen to the clock. The way it ticks is in sync with your heartbeat.
- I do not know what you say. - Vash zavtrak gotov. It is not important. What is important is that I found someone. What kind of love is it if it's one-sided?
Maybe. - They are good. - I know. Detective, interesting pool of blood over here. I assume it belongs to Cinderella here.
Oh, she's here! Delightful. Did the mini-kitchen come too? Lucifer, you shouldn't have gotten her the doll. It's okay. You can say it's yours.
You are right, of course, General Onoda. But where there is power, there is subversion. In Manchuria as well as here. General, may I return to the films? You are missing the point, Kido Tai-i. We are seen as weak. When a nation is seen as weak, it is weak.
You are not breathing. That's because I'm a little nervous. Don't be. This device is not on a timer. It's designed to be triggered remotely, and as long as no one saw us come in, we're pretty safe.
Here's a new one on the house. Oh, thank you. Just FYI, whoever brought you here, you're in this bar now. And exactly $100,000 richer. I'm gonna buy that bottle. Don't buy it.
But it went on for several weeks, during the course of which others joined us. We did not know what to expect, and nothing could have prepared us for it. In 1825, trade with blacks was banned in France, but it continued secretly between Africa and America. Although France had abolished slavery in 1794, it continued to exist under Napoleon.
But honestly, this one is better than ours. When the music blares, our daughter has a hard time falling asleep. You should go check on her. This music will turn the heads of seasoned men. God only knows what it can do to a 13-year-old's head.
We found them in the forest of Paimpont. He told me he's been gone longer. Here it is. He sent me a text message. Look at the time. It was sent after the victim's murder.
Hey. How do I lock these? Can I get an answer? Just let go. - What? I don't think they know how to open it.
Jin-hee. Open the damn door. - It's locked. I can't open it. - Then break it down.
I know we can solve this. This can't be completely locked down. We'd run out of oxygen, right? Wait a minute. If air comes in... It has to come out somewhere.
- How did I miss that? Bugged! - What? - The camera in the camp. It came from the killer.
Whoever it is, he's killing us. He wants to ruin the places we love. This happens because they are important to us. When my mother was sick, that was the only place I felt good. That was the only place where I could block everything out. Yes, we were there even when they were already out of order.
I feel dizzy. Weightless. There is a window from which you can see the earth. A blue marble spinning. It is beautiful.
If anyone steers it in, they'll turn around as soon as they see the cops. Clara Meades? I'm Karin Parke. Did you pack a bag? -Yes, it's next to the door.
They yak. Is that bad? Some people talk when they are afraid. That's how they compensate for their fear. - And hide it.
You got anything else for me? Look, I'm not one of those street corner informants you tip a few bucks to. No. Then why are we here? You and me are like the snake and the cat. The snake gets the chance, he kills the cat.
Look, I'm not one of those street corner informants you tip a few bucks to. No. Then why are we here? You and me are like the snake and the cat. The snake gets the chance, he kills the cat. And if the cat gets the chance, it kills the snake.
- Colonel, how are you? - Very well. - I liked your speech, Mr. President. - I'm glad you did. It was addressed to you.
But anyone running a cocaine empire needs to have cash on hand. And getting cash to Colombia wasn't easy. Let me put it this way: this is what a ton of cocaine looks like. And this is what the ton of cocaine looks like when it's turned into cash.
- But I feel good. I feel strong. And I am willing to fight against this injustice. The government has allowed our rights to degenerate into a farce. It has allowed our justice system to be corrupted by murderers.
There we can drive as fast as it is possible on the road, but after that you go to jail. - At 61 km/h. 62. Sometimes 63, but only in exceptional cases. We had thought we could take it with us, like this tent. But, unfortunately, it's too heavy. And, as you'll see in a moment, too bitey.
Will be done. Almost done. I got him. Go, Supergirl! The capsule. It looks like mine.
- In the last one a bat bit me. - Sissy. - Hey, sis. - You knew this plant? Yes. It's around the corner from my place.
- Sissy. - Hey, sis. - You knew this plant? Yes. It's around the corner from my place. It's just like the old one. Maybe a little better.
Influence. Did Miss Grant seem a little strange to you? She's always like that with Clark. She's crazy about him. She texted him once when she was drunk.
English. A story of yours about a rooster. I can't remember the title. "Cock Tease." Yes. She was very messy, but Mrs. Bumgarner loved her.
Yes. She was very messy, but Mrs. Bumgarner loved her. She asked you to stand up and read it to the class. Your face turned red, your voice shook. But she was good.
It is nonsense. Neither the people in Slovenia nor those in the UK nor those in Sweden nor those in Spain understand what is actually going on. I wouldn't certify that I understand how it all works, and I think part of it is even intentional. One side knows if one side is a priesthood and knows how it all works but the rest of us ordinary citizens don't know how it works, A massive transfer of power is taking place. It is designed to ensure that the great mass of people cannot control the government, ever again.
The Great War is in this, as in many other respects, a major turning point in British history. During the war, there was an incredibly intense state control over a whole range of industries. Then towards the end of the war there was a feeling that there needed to be much more permanent regulation and control of society by the state. A company was no longer private property, it was a national asset that needed to be directed from above. The government increasingly thought that it should plan, control, and regulate.
As for the shower - well, we've all seen Psycho - murder of girls like there, is now strictly forbidden. Shampoo can get in eyes and cause discomfort - 118 laws. EU bureaucrats seem to be very afraid of towels for some reason, a bit more relaxed about radiators. There are 1,246 laws related to bread, but only 52 about the crazy anarchic toaster. Only 84 laws pertaining to refrigerators, but an impressive 12,000 laws cover milk - after all, it might overflow.
They remain impassive in the face of criticism, lighthearted in the face of popular discontent. But the frustration of ordinary people is beginning to show. We must now focus on building a firewall to prevent contagion within the eurozone. What you can see everywhere is a conflict between the visions of a rather thin, working middle class that determines European policy and the reaction against it by the great mass of the European population. Ultimately, if you stuff dictatorship down the throats of people who don't want it, they will rebel.
[European rallies] Unfortunately, in many places it takes the unpleasant form of right-wing populist nationalism. Extremism on both ends is fueled by the anti-democratic nature of the European Union. What do we see? Far-right parties, ultra-nationalist parties. We don't know what the future of Europe will look like, but right now it doesn't look good.
The future consists of nations in Asia and America and Africa. Getting stuck in Fortress Europe is the worst thing that could happen to us. The idea that we have to stay in the EU for our prosperity is perverse. Why do we have to be tied to a part of the world that is doing really badly? In Europe, we know what our future is going to be to some degree - it's going to be pretty stagnant while the rest of the world roars away from us.
I just went through. That's enough! Come here. Take her upstairs. This operation is already taking longer than it should.
The lizard could be anywhere. Which isn't particularly good, because planes and ice aren't really a good combination. Oh, hey. Hey, hey. Is she alive?
I guess medical attention is not on number one on his list. I shot him in the shoulder, that should cause him some pain. You put a spear through Kovacs' chest, that barely stopped him. Look, the mutation causes an adrenaline rush. It blocks the pain.
Unimportant. All right, unimportant. Can you bring me my bag? Why would I want to do that? It's for Jackson.
Release the safety! Let's go. All right. Shouldn't that box be at Fort Knox or something like that? It was.
Cover mouth and nose. This is halothane. Stun gas. Whoever's after the DNA is already here. - There she is.
So you're wondering what this big cat does, right? Yes. That's what you're standing in the middle of. When Leonard Pierce and the Shepherds arrived here, this island was barely 200 square miles. Now it's twenty times that, thanks to the saber teeth.
All I know is that every few months there are eruptive volcanic eruptions in the sea around the island and when the lava masses have cooled down, there are lots more ocean view properties again. What was that? What is wrong? We are not after that cat. It's after us.
There's a car wash on the corner of Lincoln and 223rd Street. I'll meet you there. I'll take you to your friends. Who are you? Someone who wants the world back the way it should be.
There are seven launch sites, spread all over the island. The birds are ready when you are, Professor. I wish Chloe were here. Chloe would have loved this day more than any other. Seeing the animals, experiencing the world as it once was.
He doesn't have any clothes in his suitcase. You know, I'm starting to think about things. Casey, it's your fault, bro. It's not the writers' fault that the show is so bad. And it's really bad!
I want to spare you this, boy. Your music. - Your music will always be there. - So will school. No! It won't.
They said, "Hey, give me back my machine." They're like, "No, it just showed up all of a sudden and it's clearly for us. Give us your machine." - "You don't know how it works." - "Never mind.
- Why? - He's an ass. - Did you work closely together? - No. Thank God. He used to run the animal transport. - Now it's empty.
Does that have something to do with the universe? That it otherwise becomes quite strange? The universe is already strange. If you don't tell her now, and maybe we die later... I'll take Farah to the machine and see what she does.
I have a theory. A theory that I don't like at all. But it is my theory and all I have. So, uh... I'll explain it to you, and if you understand it and think it through, you'll.... You'll have to tell me if it's correct or not. I feel like I'm losing my mind.
I like that he cares even though he doesn't have to. Call him again. He doesn't like answering his cell phone very much in my experience. Once the machine is running, everything becomes clear. - You don't even know what it's doing.
Call him again. He doesn't like to answer his cell phone very much, in my experience. Once the machine is running, everything becomes clear. - You don't even know what she's doing. - Well, clearly, she's going to clear everything up.
Once the machine is running, everything becomes clear. - You don't even know what it does. - Well, clearly, it's going to clear everything up. Show me. Does she do that?
- The shark did it. - And where is the machine? - Here. Here. We put it together and maybe it's not all where.... This is it.
Do it. I give up. - Hurt once and you give up? - I can't be hurt. I'm always safe. A roller coaster is also safe until it derails.
We won't be here, Todd. Hang on! I'll save us! With the Infinite Energy machine? It's not, and neither is the Soul-Swapper.
She asked me to ask you something. Maestro! - Oh, Beppi! - Break a leg, good luck! Thank you, thank you, to you too! And I wanted to ask if you would wear this camera, during the concert.
- Oh, Beppi! - Break a leg, good luck! Thank you, thank you, you too! And I wanted to ask if you would wear this camera, during the concert. It's tiny. - Camera? Yes. It shows the conductor's perspective to the worldwide audience.
Thank you. I don't remember a car accident. An old man in an old car, hit the side of a new Mercedes. Pretty much right on top of you. If the wall hadn't just been repaired, you probably wouldn't have fallen off.
Thank you, Dr. Cohen. Myra, please. I'm going to start with a couple of thoughts that I have. And if I'm wrong about any of them, you stop me, all right? This sanctuary that you've created has allowed you to move on, but it's also trapped you in the past.
Myra, please. I'm going to start with a couple of thoughts that I have. And if I'm wrong about any of them, you stop me, all right? This sanctuary that you've created has allowed you to move on, but it's also trapped you in the past. It reflects back to you that you are a person to whom nothing has happened.
I'll start with a couple of thoughts that I have. And if I'm wrong about any of them, you stop me, all right? This refuge that you've created has allowed you to move on, but it's also trapped you in the past. It reflects to you that you are a person that nothing has happened to. But it will never let you move forward.
An everyman arrest, - the boy stole my bag. - This bag? - Give it to me! - Is it worth stealing?
Prince Theo will arrive at the hospital in the next 30 minutes and we will report as soon as it starts. This is the CNB news. Stop. The road is closed. Turn around.
We've been out of here before. -New circumstances... -Em. How did you cut the rope? After all our problems getting out of the room, I invented this hair clip. It's called Cam's Multifunctional Hair Clip-With-Tools-For-Dangerous-Situations.
But time is running out. Wish me luck, Ciro. I know you. You're just like me. This thing's eating you up from the inside. Like a poison. It's destroying you.
Why do you ask? It doesn't matter. We have won. And the Rhodians have a particularly cruel punishment. It is just.
Jesus. When? On the way to the base. How many dead? The explosion put the driver in a coma, but it should have been huge.
You asked for a hint. I gave you one. -Listen, I've got to go now. -[ Phone Ringing ] -Wait, just one more question. This FBI business... Is it dangerous?
We stole it from him. The material is in my colleague's bag. In a bag this size? No. It's quite heavy.
That must have been tough. I'll give you a stimulant I developed for a mission. - It'll help temporarily, but... - Thanks for the second opinion. I wish it were better.
Just one more second, I'm almost done. There you go. Sit down. What do you know about the theory of quantum entanglement? It is the basis for a transfer of consciousness.
Because I am green? Imagine a turtle. It crosses the street. It doesn't care about the cars. It thinks its shell protects it.
Imagine a turtle. It crosses the street. It is not interested in the cars. She thinks her shell protects her. Actually, it is fragile.
He's one of the best journalists I know, and has the wardrobe to match. Shabby, not so fancy. Mr. Carr, it's an honor to meet you. I read your series on corruption in the mayor's office. It was... Well, it won the Pulitzer Prize, so...
And more importantly, this is really gross! I mean... Bernd, are you listening? You have to ask my soul. It controls the mailbox of my body.
I want to give you a medal. A little thanks would be in order. You're welcome. How long does this ceremony last? It lasts forever!
You have the true answer The answer is everywhere Come with me, come with me And plant seeds of peace Together we can plant seeds of peace Now all! There's a power in the flower And it's called peace
Come with me, come with me And plant seeds of peace Together we can plant seeds of peace Now all! There is a power in the flower And it's called peace There is a movement in the sea And it's called peace
To die of gloom because my precious possessions were stolen! You wear your crown. I am not talking about my crown! I am talking about my beloved jumping bean. It's a bean... and it can jump.
Do you like it? Do you want to go again? It's actually... How do you like the hand now? How do you like it now?
I was lost, but am funky now. He said found, but that sounded like a cliché, so I spiced it up à la KJ. King Julien, I knew you would return. Use my hat as a talisman. It is yours.
Take my cap as a talisman. It is yours. Take it. Here! Go ahead... ...touch it.
Yes, and then? The truth came out. And it had to come out. Did it really have to be? No. My point is, I couldn't stop! I wanted to. But it was and it was said.
There are enough batteries to release enough hydrogen gas to collapse the building. When you hacked Evil Corp, you gave us access to the back door. You made it possible for us to infect them. I wrote the malware from the femtocell for Darlene. But it wasn't meant for here.
Eddie, let's turn around. Eddie! He's just gonna do it again! Eddie! You want to pay the fee? Shove it up your ass.
Come on, we'll go another way. Eddie. Don't! What happened to your hand? Did your daddy kiss it? Oh, right.
Go. Shit. Run! Katie! So... this show? Did you start it or did Katie start it? She did.
I need you to tell me where you were last night after you left. - I know how it sounds, but I'm not crazy. - You're not crazy. Believe me, it's not just a TV show, okay? She did something to my brother, and she can make people do weird things.
She stabbed him while he was sleeping. She had a hook. Katie, she... How did she get a hook? She's here, but something's wrong. She won't talk. Look,I know you said... that this show can make people do things.
You need to learn how to score tests. Okay, all right. The cream shot out of my sack. It's okay. It landed on my snail.
What choice do I have?" That's good. He's all right. How was the lecture? It was good. That's it?
You picked a really bad time to get locked up. - I'm scared. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I want you to go home, and I want you to take my gun. What? Keep it with you, just in case.
- What color is the sky? - Blue. And what color is chocolate milk? Pink! No, it isn't.
- Blue. And what color is chocolate milk? Pink! No, it isn't. It is chocolate colored.
At Thea Foss Theatre. It's sold out. It's great for my career. Have you seen my purse? What? Why are you changing the subject? There it is.
We can't bring anything into the 21st that we should have left behind. I mean, Protocol 2... "The future is the past." But we decided... We can't make exceptions because it's practical. Or... personal. I mean... We've been clinging to this relationship all along. It compromises our team, our cover, our mission....
You? I had evidence that the director was going to be attacked. I had to act. All I know is that my mission didn't come via text message. It came from the Director. In person.
I know. Does dark matter mean anything to you? - What? Dark matter? Yeah, the thing that surrounds us? You know how we know it's around us?
But you were busy. Matteusz says the shadows might stop it. Can you do any shadow magic stuff? This weapon is not meant to be used. The weapon in which we find our final resting place, that it may never be used.
The fixation is prepared, Your Majesty. Once I put it in place, it will hold the heart in your body. And you will be unharmed again. The success should be immediate. The fixation has been applied. And it fails!
I fed one an hour ago. And fueled by that one drop of blood, it has doubled, doubled and doubled again. And it's eating squirrels! They probably can't manage more at the moment, but it doesn't stay that way. We think that through a space-time rift last night a single flower hatched, and look how it multiplied.
Look at the others. Memorize their faces and find them. Please lie down. - Can you hear the music? - I'm not allowed to change the station. - You're a smart girl.
If you can get him there within the hour. Walt, you should help Billy. I can drive Harp to the FBI. The scenery out here is breathtaking. It really is.
So why is he chasing you? Well, I, uh... I thought I lost this necklace, and then I see it around the neck of J.P.'s new wife. - Yeah. - Whoa. That asshole stole it from me and gave it to another woman.
Okay? I saw them in the Blind Tiger and I took them back. You stole them from his wife's neck. No, I didn't steal it. She's mine.
What do you think happened? He slept with Mrs. Crandall, then threatened to tell Tizz, she killed him so he couldn't say anything? Or Tizz caught her and freaked out. She's been to that cabin. She knows where it is.
And protons consist of quarks. And after the quarks, the strings were discovered. And the strings are not even particles. They are energy vibrations. You think the world is something solid. And then it melts.
Something is going on here in secret. I can't explain it. I'm not a patient on your couch. But you're acting like one. An emotionally crippled boy who can't stand his helplessness because it reminds him of the trauma his catatonic mother inflicted on him.
They offered him a nine-figure sum. Sometimes there is a hidden value. - What are you dreaming about? - Woody. We're having an affair, but it's just a dream.
Psychological stress does. And since this isn't real, it all comes down to the psyche. What is Topeka? A name. Places need names. Our shared dreams, the whole thing. She needed a name.
This is a very difficult problem, because you have to enter the Martian atmosphere at incredibly high speeds. The Martian atmosphere is so thin that just before you reach the surface, when you fire the rockets, you're in the supersonic range, so you have to put the thrusters into the wind at Mach 3. You fire the thrusters into the supersonic airflow, bring the engine down to zero, extend the landing gear and land. And you only get one shot at it. But the rockets don't want to work there. There are a thousand ways a rocket can fail, and only one way it works.
They had previously been test pilots and had flown in the days of the first jet engines. More than a few of them died. Challenger takes target course. Obvious failure. We don't have a downlink. Sometimes painful things like this happen. It's part of the process of exploration and discovery. The future does not belong to the timid. It belongs to the brave.
The only way to separate it would be to break it. We all knew that someone could die here. But no one ever thought it would be Ben. We buried him outside the camp. On the regolith. The sun makes such a pattern on the ground when it sets behind the cliffs.
What will life be like in the first Martian colonies? This stage could exist on Mars. Exploration. Someone goes off and comes back. The next stage would be some kind of research station. It would be supplied from Earth, and people would circulate in and out regularly.
How far did it come and what did it look like? PRESIDENT, THE MARS SOCIETY For the past hundreds of years, science has assumed that science as we know it on Earth can be applied to the universe. Physics on Earth can be applied to planetary motion.... LEADER RAUMSTRATEGY ...and celestial bodies. The chemistry on Earth is the same as that of the galaxies. Gas clouds and all the things that form new stars. But there is one science that we don't know if it's the same there as it is here, and that's biology.
The conditions for life must have existed here. There is much red sand to sift. And to report. Please, I'm working. Dr. Kamen, do you have a moment? I don't want to interrupt your work, but it never seems to stop, so I'll drop by.
Main engine shut down. The first stage returns to land while the second stage launches the OrbComm satellites into orbit. The fairing has deployed. The first stage begins three switching stages to return to Cape Canaveral. Okay, where is it going?
That is bad. Possibly bad. Our stage one coming back. History is being made here. - She's getting up. - She stands up.
But now that she is dead... She is an unavailable declarer. Like I said, you're a good lawyer. And I'm not going to pretend that I made a reliable witness disappear, even though the girl was a junkie, and your story was inconsistent at best. And it still should have been presented to a jury, which we're trying to straighten out.
The shit has hit the fan. Jeez. Is this stuff real? Are you asking me if child pornography is real? How the hell would I know? That was probably the most vile thing I've ever seen and yet there it is.
They are coming! Frankly, my hands are too big. Hold the edge and let him talk. What's wrong? The disease, it killed them all.
Our board looked at the issues ALEC was working on and decided to focus on the economy rather than social issues. We basically discarded everything we had worked on before 2007. So we started all over again. New and looking forward. This industry knows it's at the end, and it's preparing for the next thing.
Once convicted, you are a slave to the state. EXCEPT AS A PUNISHMENT FOR CRIME A pen cannot enforce anything itself. The 13th Amendment was seen as a milestone for freedom; antislavery activists celebrated it as the end of a struggle. The reality is more problematic. Once that clause was inserted, it became a tool. It is embedded in the structure.
- I can't breathe. - Never mind. Stay with me. We were pulled over for a broken taillight. UNARMED BLACKS KILLED BY POLICE Police violence alone is not the problem. It reflects a larger, more brutal system, racial and social control, also known as mass incarceration. It allows police to use this kind of violence.
And I'm not kidding. Please tell me this is a joke. Oh, come on, it's bullshit. You know I keep my word. Yes, and I told him that, and he doesn't want to risk becoming a target and then finding out that reducing his sentence actually means cutting it in half.
You are a second-year law student, Rachel. I asked you to be a part of this because you are one of my brightest students, but I also asked you specifically because I thought you weren't that naïve. Excuse me? Your job was not to talk to Mr. Bailey once and, after being impressed by his whining story, tell me that he belonged at the top of the pile. It was to analyze his case and present evidence.
We would love to expand. This space would have been perfect. Are you serious? Yes. In fact, it's so perfect that I would have made you an offer right away.
I'm sure you know that, but I don't think they'll find what they're looking for. What did you just say? I'm sorry, but you fit the description of the man I was told would show up here about now. And what exactly is the description? I'd rather not say, but it fits exactly.
I will say the same thing again when they last approached me. My father-in-law is innocent. Is that it, or can I go? One more thing, Kevin. An indictment is coming any second, and once it's filed, you're going to be a get out of jail free card for every inmate in here.
You said that you would find Maria. So tell me, what are you doing here instead of being out there looking for her? Leonard, I know this is hard and.... Mr. Bailey, what Rachel is saying is that is exactly what we are going to do. Mr. Cahill, you better have a compelling reason why I should not grant Mr. Specter's motion to dismiss or this thing will be over before it even starts.
- You are on an island with two tribes. - Oh, Jesus. Does the prosecution have any questions for the witness? Does frontotemporal dementia inhibit intellectual capacity or moral clarity? No, it doesn't.
I enjoyed his songs. I admire how Harry acknowledges our separations. That's a new detail. But he actually always puts a lot of effort into it. A couple of times he even cleaned the whole apartment. Like it was a crime scene.
"A Stolen Woman." I would like to ask you to leave your genitals at the entrance and dedicate your mind to these pieces. I don't think that when you see a naked body you think only of sex. I think you think of your own mind. Of one's own body. And of its strength, its power. And that's the fulcrum of this exhibition. It's about strength and power.
A trauma surgeon will take a look at you. She will decide how best to proceed. Are you going to cut me open? Probably. If the bullet shifts inside you, it could do a lot of damage.
Man, that's crazy. Just heard. Our banger, Marco? CT shows the bullet's not in the midline or touching the aorta. It's in the left paraspinal muscle.
If the box uses phase shifting.... Maybe it is just a ghost. That's also a theory. The alloy in the box is very rare. It's only made at Momentum Labs in three places in the world. Used to be.
We all saw him. That's sleight of hand, you moron. Not super strength. Let's see if you can make a bullet disappear. You want to take this? Where the hell is she? -Who's got her?
It says her last words before she was burned were a curse on all future constables of Willards Mill. Look at this crap. It's written in some kind of mirrored Mexican blah blah. Apparently Claire's necklace helps you read this crap. Where is she?
The apartment was too good to be true. You've been following my search history. You've always had the hots for a dinette set. But don't worry, the place is yours. And it's rent-controlled now, so...
That's not what I asked. I know what you're doing. Keeping your distance from everyone else so they don't die in front of you? I invented that attitude. And it doesn't work.
Then I ended up on the street... and died. And there was nothing. Just darkness. Then I heard a voice. It asked me if I wanted a second chance, wanted to punish those who hurt my brother, wanted to avenge my own death.
S.H.I.E.L.D. has it. It's safe. You're safe. Stay away from the equipment. - It's very dangerous.
Welcome, Dr. Simmons. We need your help. Is that a terrigenesis cocoon? In progress. It's very rare to see the actual metamorphosis. It only lasts a few fleeting moments.
I am sorry. I know how that feels. Excuse me, Agent May. I'll get you cleaned up right away. When we open the bottle, it's open. There's no going back.
Fucking assholes! Hey! Give me back my gun, you fuckers! Motherfucker! Give it to me, asshole!
Unless you intend to kill me. No, not at the moment. That was quite an ultimatum you gave Ms. Lawler outside. That's why I didn't agree to meet with you. That list that they are putting out there could hurt the careers of some very good public servants, but it wouldn't hurt me one bit.
He is seven. - It's going to sound strange. - We're used to it. I had a drawing of him. It was 30 years old.
- We are used to that. I had a drawing of him. It was 30 years old. A gift from the ambassador. It's also on an album cover.
- Excuse me? It's out. And he wasn't fired. Nobody's going to see it that way. Admit that, and your presidency ends abruptly. Deny it, and your presidency begins with a lie.
My actions were very daring. I admit it. And I think it was for the best. If you can't see that... This is my resignation. You can accept it anytime you feel like it.
The naked body of the girl had been covered. There were signs that she had been pressed to the ground. Especially on the arms. There was a very deep wound on her throat. It caught my eye because it was so severe.
Agent Wells. How are you doing? Same as everyone, I guess. I went to Andrews. The bomb we found, the UXO, it could mean something completely different.
As press secretary, you can change that. You want me to be the president's nice Muslim? If that's the way to calm tempers, yes. - Unbelievable. - This is Washington. You seize the opportunity when it presents itself, whether the motives suit you or not.
Well, Mike from the interns, get a suit and I'll see you then. Bye. We're going to a party. Yes. Because the photon gun is electromagnetically powered, it left a mark on Supergirl's suit after the blast wave. So maybe we could create a search algorithm...
It's melting so fast that Helsinki will be underwater for the next decade. Sir, we... We don't know what this is. A frozen wolf? We found a stone spearhead in its body. It dates back to about 3,000 BC.
He is gone. My lords, we have reached the source of the stars. - So? The Kryptonian pod is not here. - Find it.
- The Kryptonian pod is not here. - Find it. - The ion pathway has disintegrated. - I don't know where to look. - Find it.
Do you have his files? Is that why you're asking if I still want it? You... Was there nothing there or did you not have time to download? I didn't say the mission was aborted. I said it was compromised.
- Hello. - And this is our friend, Raj. I'm not working on the patent, I'm just here because there's a bumblebee buzzing around my office. I've seen it. It's huge.
That's half the Berlin office. - Yes. Unfortunately, they're all going to have to go. Maybe we could rename them Smith? A snail can shed its house, but it remains a snail.
This is for authorized professionals only! - You must leave now. - I did not expect this recoil. But this gun is still defective. I can tell you that right now. It should be destroyed immediately.
Welcome to Budding Blossom. What can I do for you today? I am not quite sure. I just got a new sativa strain. It's called Jack the Ripper.
A little help over here? Rog, help me! Taser him again! - Man, his situation was all over your... - Yes! Yes, it was.
No, they won't. Look, we're almost there, okay? They're gone. I can see the front door. - It's so close.
We have to inform the public about it. - I would not do that. - I know you would not do that. You also wouldn't worry about changing your shirt every, I don't know, week, but neither of those are decisions that you make. Most of the veterans from Jackson's group therapy are dead. Clear so far? Well, that's either a big coincidence or this thing is bigger than it looks.
Well, this is a nice party. It's a lovely afternoon. - More tea? - No, thank you. My cup is still full. No, it isn't.
Correction. He made that I could do pretty much anything. First he made me feel special. Then, thank God, I don't remember everything. They call it post-traumatic amnesia.
But, of course, you have our full support. Thank you both. But my job is also to warn you. Your entire presidency depends on it. If the mission is a success, you're Reagan. If it goes wrong, you're Carter. And Congress will hold you accountable.
But we are not done here yet. The bombs are not here. They are in the stadium. Who gave you this information? Is it true?
The bombs are not here. They are in the stadium. Who gave you this information? Is it true? Yes, sir, it's true.
He was very close to the Goyan Stadium. So I guess he wants to die. I'll track him down. Inspector, we have the phone number. - Dial it already.
You miserable weirdo. What are you running around like a lunatic for? Where's your brother? Look at the lamp. Doesn't she look a little strange?
They will never shoot. Want to bet? Okay, let's bet that you lose. Bomb and heart are connected. It explodes as soon as it stops.
Can I talk to you in the office for a minute about the report I just filed? No, what is it? What do you need? I know what's in my report. It's about the control gap, it's not in there, but it should be.
I'm Niala Boodhoo, with me is Jacob Malco. A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES He writes graphic novels. The latest, Obscurity, is now available. Regarding what happened between your first book, Conjugality, which was such a hit and made into a movie, and the following book, Infidelity, and the infidelity actually happening in your life, I wonder how that influenced your work. Yes, the love story of Conjugality was compelling and beautiful, and it was real.
All right. I don't know. Yes, it was honest, but... Was I honest with myself? You could say no, because in the second book I met someone else, so was that love real? Was the romance real? Yes. Did it last? No.
- Yes. - Let's have a drink across the street. Thanks for your message. The performance was great. It was very, very good... We're all going to go now, I don't think I'll catch you tonight.... Maybe we'll talk tomorrow.
Call back and we will discuss the details. Thank you. Bye. If I get the part, then... I'll, uh... Well, you know... Then I'll probably move to L.A., that's where they're shooting it.
I... There were many reasons, but this is a long story, why I lost hope. One day I was standing on a busy street corner and felt completely alone. The decision was spontaneous. But I survived because apparently I am not alone after all. I thought about my decision for a long time and now I know it was wrong.
It will be between the seats. To your right. You move the car into position, flip the switch for the time bomb, and get the hell out of there. How much time do I have? - Enough to go straight to the exit. Frank, press the button on this side and it'll go off right away.
Hey, Doc. Detective Hynes. Did I wake you? No... yeah. I went by your office yesterday, since it worked out better the first time, but it was closed.
So I got an insulating bucket, pointed the tip of the gun into the bucket, set to work.... And lo and behold, liquid. I survived the most dangerous action of the day. That tells us that this gun works. It shoots a jet of liquid. The environment just has to be extremely cold.
I think the terrorists will notice the attack. That's why I'm creating a distraction now. I'll use a donut to kick up dust to confuse the terrorists. Oh, no. Disaster! Even if you turn off the traction control, it's not completely off. You just get miles of boring understeer.
Just because that winged mouse hangs there smugly, we can't tear down the house? We have no choice. Well, come on up. Hammond, I hate ladders, and I hate bats. Many hours later, and without any help from Spiderman, the roof was finally covered. The bat was free. Would she move out? Why doesn't she live there?
Hammond, I hate ladders, and I hate bats. Many hours later, and without any help from Spiderman, the roof was finally covered. The bat was free. Would she move out? Why doesn't it live there? That's perfect for a bat. Maybe. But it must decide for itself.
Aren't we showing the round? We don't want to see the American get slashed by a Beetle. He clocked one minute and 20.4 seconds. I wonder what the M4's time will be. Here it comes.
Did you sew it yourself, the little leather bag? No, it came with the bag. - Oh, really? Ferrari sold it to you? Must have cost £600. It came with the car.
Do you know the bridge? Is it famous? A bridge for squirrels? - Yes, for squirrels. How many squirrels do you think have used it?
Actually, all you need is a huge Cold War airfield with a runway big enough for the playing field. On the runway you draw the coordinate grid and place your battleships. For this you need old cars worth several thousand pounds. But not just any cars. This stretch limo has seen hundreds of hen parties. But now it's the perfect aircraft carrier.
It is very old. But it folds apart so that horse-drawn carriages could drive over it in the past. These are the parliament buildings where we keep all our idiots. That clock there is called Big Ben. It's not really that big. But we couldn't just call it Ben.
But in the midst of this glory, a thought came to me that began to gnaw at me. I don't want to worry you, but is it low tide or high tide right now? I would say, there's no way we're going to get across. If the tide comes up to there, and it does, then we're screwed.
That's gotten us a long way. So Hammond's car is on strike, yours is stuck, and mine is overheating. Do we agree, James, that your idea was stupid? It was stupid.
But... - You had to put a spoiler that disfigures the car. That's a man talking, justifying a horrible idea. The idea was genius! - It does not work!
A sound... We can now distinguish between the sound of a military and civilian aircraft. Take cover, hero! Where should I seek shelter in this building? If a barrel bomb hit here, it would destroy the whole building!
- That wasn't a light effect? - No, no! What I saw was alive. At least it had a human form. Where did it disappear to?
- I just come here to play. - Can't you play at home? My parents don't like violin. Wrongly so. I once saw a violin at school, it literally attracted me, as if it was waiting for me.
The power outage meant I got to throw away everything in the freezer. Here. This is interesting. "In the middle of the storm, the Ballmer family left Chambéry airport. The plane with 4 passengers disappeared from radar at 20:52. No distress call was made and it never landed.
Here. This is interesting. "In the middle of the storm, the Ballmer family left Chambéry airport. The plane with 4 passengers disappeared from radar at 20:52. No distress call was made and it never landed. It probably crashed in the mountains."
No distress call was made and she never landed. She probably crashed in the mountains." Does this have anything to do with your case? The search was more up north. And she wasn't found?
And radiate, and radiate. And turn, and turn. And pat, pat, pat. And gallop. Gallop. That's it. Keep galloping! Sorry I'm late. I can't find my crown. That crazy woman has it.
Come on. One more lap around the village. Why are we stopping here? To enjoy the view. There it is.
I saw enough to realize that my trust in them was a mistake. Yes, it took 35 years to give them a chance. Why not give it up right away? Maggie, they were playing Star Wars with the sperm cannula. Rooster waved it around and said:
And met Abby. Can I have whiskey? How have you been? How did your talk with Ed go last night? It went real good.
Are we done here? Because I don't subscribe to that. Well, too bad. Beau, then I'd better advise you to get your own lawyer now. I'm going back to the ranch... while it's still mine.
She remembers. I remember that... I couldn't control my body sometimes. There's just this voice. She kept asking me to come closer, and when I did....
No, it's okay. You don't have to say anything. I'll find the answer. The truth is out there somewhere. Or is it in here?
What do you think was in that injector? My free will. I don't think so. That medicine wasn't meant for you. It's messing with your mind.
My free will. I don't think so. This medicine was not meant for you. It messes with your mind. It makes you paranoid and afraid.
Do you have my comment, or do you miss me? - Can I talk to you privately? I have a very uncomfortable, possibly indecent favor to ask of you. I need you to hold off on the story about Leo as long as you can. - Because it's true?
How the iron melts, the marble collapses. Whoever did this is part of a conspiracy of unprecedented proportions. I was afraid, Mr. President. I need you to give me all the names that had access to that file. I put an ORCON rating on the file. That makes for a limited number of people who saw it.
Whoever did this was part of a conspiracy of unprecedented proportions. I was afraid, Mr. President. I need you to give me all the names that had access to that file. I put an ORCON rating on the file. That makes for a limited number of people who saw it. - Then it went to DoD security.
General, this is File 12-80-C. A threat assessment that the Pentagon did two and a half years before the attack. Mr. President, I've never seen that before. I don't think that's likely. That file had an ORCON rating. I can count on one hand the people who saw it.
What I tell you now must not leave this room. - Do you understand? - Of course. I received a confidential DoD file containing the instructions for the Capitol attack. I believe it was used to implement the attack.
Thank you. Hi, I'm Agent Wells. I called about the video surveillance. Of course. Come on back.
What's the problem? It's not even true. Look, the napkin of the hostess. - Holy Mary. - Look at her.
I'll show you how it all works. There. That's a piece of liver. There is the registration. The registry has to be in contact with living cells or it will run out.
Do they want us to wait? Or escape? If the trial keeps me here, I'm staying too. If you eat shit, will you do it? If it smelled good and came from the island...
- Hi, honey. - Hi. What's up? I watched your speech from here. It was great, as always.
That's better. Did you have any dealings with Agent César? Not often. You didn't know what he thought of your performance? That it was a little below average?
Right when Mr. Cole came home. And the fact that the only thing missing is his laptop. This case is dirty and faded from the sun, except for this part. This bag comes with a detachable laptop sleeve. It sits right here.
My very existence seems to embarrass him. If I didn't exist, our friend Sherlock would still think that the sun revolves around the earth. I was eight when I made that mistake. You decided to wear that vest this morning. It was a gift from a fan.
An asteroid, 32 kilometers across, is hurtling toward us as we speak. You made your point last night, okay? We would both continue our work to the end. The work we're doing is important. I think I could have done a better job explaining why it's important.
You made your point last night, okay? We would both continue our work until the end. The work we're doing is important. I think I could have done a better job of explaining why it's important. At least explain why it's important... to me.
When the young noddis break open, they carry these attached seeds to other islands. But sometimes the Pisonia trees are too successful. If a young bird falls to the ground while testing its wings, it can become coated with the seeds. If it cannot free itself while so entangled and overloaded, the young bird will starve to death. The pisonia may have failed to spread its seeds, but it will soon have fertilizer for its roots.
What's that coming out of her mumu? "The legions of hell..." Is that anatomically correct? I always assumed they were coming out of her asshole. "She should have put a ring on it."
- Only almost. Well, I for one am really glad you're here. You know, it never gets any easier. Time doesn't help. Why should it?
Why should she? Because everyone says that she does. People who say that have no idea. Time is cruel. It punishes.
I have waited 18 years for some time for us. And I love our baby, but I'm not waiting another 18. It's time to dream big and get out of our comfort zone a little. Here's the thing about our comfort zone: It's very comfortable.
And I love our baby, but I'm not waiting another 18. It's time to dream big and get out of our comfort zone a little. Here's the thing about our comfort zone: It's very comfortable. Until it isn't.
The Danube frontier had always been a problem, and it would remain so. The Roman army was the most fearsome fighting machine the ancient world had ever seen. The basis of their success was not so much their ability to kill as their ability to entrench and build fortresses. They designed the infrastructure of a frontier guard to ensure that Roman borders were protected and secure.
Otherwise, you won't get on this damn bus. You white people rule this country, on this bus I rule. - Even if you don't want to believe it." - "Sir, I got it." "You little paleface, I see right through you." - "Sir, here she is." - "You white devil, go all the way to the back."
Extra stationery design would have made a lot of money. And the car thieves would read it and say, "Come on, it says 'No Radio.' Can't you read?" The city was a shithole, but it seemed more authentic.
I don't understand. Did you ask him to assign the case to someone in the unit? No, I asked him to expedite the fingerprint analysis on the .38. He made one phone call and... wham. The lab said it would be ready tomorrow.
Yeah, he's an FBI agent. Do you know him? As a matter of fact, we do. - Didn't you get my message? - Got it. Did you read it?
She crashed a truck into a prison. In the middle of the day. Easter. SEVERITY GRADE: 3/10 I'd say points for brute force, not finesse. Good. I'll introduce an escape first, which is truly unique. A vehicle, assembled by hand from scrap parts, and a daring escape, not from a prison, but from a country. It takes place in 1979, in an area under communist rule.
The science is still young. We hope he will develop a closer connection with humanity. Never in a lifetime. It can't be true. I knew you wouldn't believe me, I wouldn't either, so I contacted Brian Ford, the researcher who discovered the story when it was released.
How did he do it? Here's someone who will help me find out, animal psychologist, Dr. Aaron Blaisdell. Was Skinner completely crazy or was it a good idea? A little of both. He was crazy because he had the idea of putting a pigeon in a rocket.... DR. AARON BLAISDELL ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGIST ...so it could guide it to a ship and blow it up.
I want you to build a new weapon. - Yes, General. - A catapult. - Yes, sir. - Climb on it and aim at the giant Nazi concrete wall.
One, when the wind shifts, drift occurs. One. Two, the fall is so slow that enemies have enough time to shoot down the cargo in the sky. So the British had the idea of attaching rockets to the cargo. So it would drop at terminal velocity and at the last minute ignite the rockets, resulting in a soft landing.
The once proud French nation is occupied by the Nazis. Only the brave fighters of the Résistance continue the struggle. These fearless saboteurs plan a bold attack to destroy the fighting spirit of the Nazi occupiers. With the help of a secret weapon from American intelligence. - Do you have it?
Parfait. I can't wait to use it against the Nazi bastards. Good luck. Using this weapon took a lot of courage. It could only be activated at close range.
One. I have done my tests. Now I'm running it on a large scale. First, I have to build a platform. It will be six square meters.
I have done my tests. Now I'm running it on a large scale. First I have to build a platform. It will be six square meters in size. It also has to be very precise, because stability is a problem and the rockets have to be placed exactly in the center.
The first carriage is placed, the rubber ropes are connected. Time for a short system check. Ok, I will show you the whole setup. First the winch. The winch tensions the rubber ropes. It retracts when we press the release.
It's too late to back out. While Tory prepares on the bobsled run, I get ready here in Galaxyland. To do so, I put on my g-force measuring vest. Yes. It needs to be calibrated like any precise measuring tool.
...and things that beep. That's high on the list of things I love to hate. We rate six competitors in tests in three categories. Number 1: How long has the technology been annoying? Number 2: How useful is it, even if it is annoying?
My device can move it, turn it or stop it. Or let the drone land softly before you trample it. You just took my drone out of the sky. Hijacking a drone is cool, but it doesn't satisfy me the way shooting down a drone does. That British bazooka looks like it could destroy the Death Star. But its job is to capture flying drones.
Where can I find a taco store? A taco is a snack of Mexican origin. No, I don't want a definition. I shouldn't be so strict with speech recognition. It needs to understand "uh" and "huh", and all the accents, and all the same-sounding words with different meanings.
Call now! Okay, traffic lights can be a pain in the ass. Let's rate them. First, how long have they been annoying? The first traffic light was installed in London 150 years ago. It ran on gas.
Let's evaluate them. First, how long have they been annoying? The first traffic light was installed in London 150 years ago. It ran on gas. It could hardly have been annoying. It was just one. It exploded after a month and injured a policeman.
So traffic lights might be less annoying in the future. But my last candidate gets much worse. Hi, my name is Jim. My addiction has brought me down. It cost me my job.
Perfect. I thought I was the only non-doctor here. We have tissue here. Where did it come from? It's from a pig. We use pig skin because it's textured like human skin. We can predict what's going to happen to a human.
When you have that much pressure in your bowels.... He can't take any more pressure. ...you're already dead. You win. This technique looks like it's right out of Star Trek.
Let's take a look at this man. Neil Harbisson was born with severe color blindness. He had an antenna implanted in his brain. My antenna is a body part, so I can hear colors. It sends light frequencies to a chip in the back of my head. The chip converts the colors into sound waves.
There is only one way to find out. I build and test it. We have small drive axles. Jon Marcu, the tinkerer, is helping me. We have to build a device that rolls paper from side to side, a card, and it has to match the speed of the car so the card moves with the car.
That's very inefficient. Sorry. I think that's why I could find very little about the iter car. My card ran out again. I think they went out of business.
Four contenders vying for first place, and here's a fifth. This time, I'm the center of attention. This invention has become popular all over the world in recent years. You see it at every landmark. Sold millions of times, but she is at Apple conferences,
You see it at every landmark. Sold millions of times, but it's banned from Apple conferences, Disney parks and Wimbledon. Why? Because it's incredibly annoying.
And it was huge. No, literally. Really gigantic. A series of control cables connected keyboards to what Cahill called his music system. It consisted of miles of cables, power generators, rotary cylinders, generators, transformers and control panels.
No, literally. Really gigantic. A series of control cables connected keyboards to what Cahill called his music system. It consisted of miles of cables, power generators, rotary cylinders, generators, transformers and control panels. It was 18 feet long, weighed nearly 200 tons, and took up the entire basement floor of his building on Broadway.
And there were technical problems. Customers heard conversations on another line. Remember, it was a telephone delivery system. Cahill's invention fell victim at the end of its time. It was doomed to failure because of its size and cost.
Use a printed map on these roads? Please. Look at this... all of Los Angeles. It's ridiculous. This traffic should be ideal for the crowdsourcing app because it can adapt to conditions.
This traffic is supposed to be ideal for the crowdsourcing app because it can adapt to conditions. Another 90 meters, then turn right. Oh, my God. Why are you leading me this way? But it has weaknesses.
In war... you don't know what can happen. Be it a suicide in Netanya.... How many rockets have landed.... in Bethlehem, Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin, Gaza? How many thousands of children, women, old people were killed by the rocket? Each one weighing a ton. They threw them at civilians.
Father Ibrahim... opened and let us in, offering us protection. He closed the door and said, "Don't worry, you are safe." For them, the most important thing was to find a safe place. The church was always the safest place then. For a long time, it has always been the safest place.
The bed was... I was only a few feet away. I could have easily turned around and... and grabbed the gun. I didn't know how to handle a gun. I didn't know if it was loaded.
Maybe we should try it." And, "No." Then we decided to try it. And incredibly, it works. It's a simple mechanism. There's a little spring, and when you lift that, it magically opens.
- You look good. Very good. - Yes! Thank you. Art is material. It's intertwined with the real world, through matter and relationship.
It is intertwined with the real world, through matter and relationship. Art is political. Especially when it insists on not being so. Art is dialectical. It is enriched when shared and stunted by ownership and commodification.
Art is political. Especially when it insists on not being so. Art is dialectical. It is enriched when shared and stunted by ownership and commodification. It is the language of seeing and being seen.
I am here because I know your value. I'm here to offer you lots of cash, power and pussy. I don't care what kind of pussy it is, we don't want to know it. You and I could own this town. If I wanted that, it would be mine by now.
-Where is the bridge? Who is hungry for cake? Voilà. Where is that contact lens? Ah, there it is.
You are protecting the troll hunter. You are despicable. What are you going to do? By my six eyes, I'll find that bridge if it kills me. You tell me where it is.
Hang in there, son. You'll be all right. I promise. Jim, hang in there. Great Gronka Morka, the shape-shifter was right. The bridge is complete. And it's been here all along!
-Your life much more important. Not pet. Wingman. Thank you, likewise. Let's take care of the bridge so it never opens again.
Something like Gunmar's birthstone. He has power? Once trolls lived underground, unaware of humans. That changed. Each side wanted the world for themselves, and they fought.
Oh no. Give me the ring! My soul. No. It's...
Give me the ring! My soul. No. It's... It's gone.
-Sword. Gunmar wanted to send a message to Jim. That's why he survived! And that's how he escaped! I hope it's short. We don't have time.
Continue? World domination, reaching for the stars. In 2007, Biderman became CEO and the media ran hot. I don't support infidelity. It needs no encouragement.
Close it, quick! The garbage can! I'll get it! Get it! That way! (whispers) Wait!
Keep a close eye on him. We should get out of here! We'll save as many of the prisoners as we can! It's the loneliness. It makes us weak.
A real bomb? No. Don't worry. It's not dangerous. As long as these two don't touch, it can't go off.
Europe and America The United Nations The hope of our future World peace It's up to us Let's get it on I ride the subway Under the city It's under the ground!
How is the pizza? - Not good. - No? No. Maybe it tastes a little better with the nuggets.
If we let it go, we will never find our way back. It worked! Once that's done, we'll send the drone in to sight Maddy. Keep her steady. Keep her steady.
It worked! Once that's done, we'll send the drone in to sight Maddy. Keep her calm. Keep her steady. Keep her steady, Griffin.
- No. - How do you get down normally? - You don't, you get stuck. Wow, I can't believe you ate the cotton candy. The only scary thing is that it actually tasted pretty good.
No, I need my typewriter. - What? I've written every story on this Smith Corona. It's not just me. This typewriter is special. It has a soul of its own.
It's all just numbers. Computer data that is transmitted electronically. Right under our noses. The French poet Paul Valéry was right when he said: The future is no longer what it was.
I blamed myself for the next 10 minutes. Will I see this woman again? Luckily, she had forgotten her magazine! You know who it was addressed to.
We are two of the angriest people I know. I was taught to suppress my anger, which I did.... and still do. That's exactly why I envy you. Mmm. The anger that you have inside of you, it still shows. It's written all over your face, so to speak.
That's exactly why I envy you. Mmm. The rage you have inside you is still visible. It's written all over your face. Make peace with it, Gilly. And use it for your own ends.
There was a time when I knew everything in the sky. Every satellite, every constellation, souvenirs from space walks, astronauts, rockets that NASA fired in the 60s. As a kid, I looked up at the sky and saw the future. It was mine.
Not every noa lani is a puka lani. Not every fog is a sky gate. Nice. What is the future? The future is not something that just happens. It's a huge force with a great sense of humor that will run you over if you're not careful.
The world has seen a few upgrades since your death, Cage. Drones on board, anti-aircraft guns, and tanks big enough to circle the globe three times without landing. You can take your coat off. No one will steal it here. Unless it runs away on its own.
Thanks for the help. X is looking out for his people. You've got to be kidding me. We didn't make it. Xander, Marke's activated the satellite, and it's moving toward us.
You lost the boy and the sword. Have I not sacrificed you enough? And have you not felt yourself gaining power? With each kingdom conquered, each new floor of your tower? Once it is crowned with Gallic silver you will have what you wanted.
- One of the many would-be conquerors of the universe who want to steal the secret of the manastone. The way your race uses technology to release its energy is impressive. What do you know about the Manastone? - What do I know? I know that it is not from your planet.
The way your race uses technology to release its energy is impressive. What do you know about the manastone? - What do I know? I know it's not from your planet. I know it was stolen centuries ago in a war.
Fortunately, I am also somewhat skilled in magic. But there was a little problem. Smurfette's name doesn't tell us anything about her at all. Okay, physically... It doesn't tell us who she is.
You're just in time to witness science history. What's going on here? None of your business, nosy. All right. Hey, if the vegetable hat can tell us that Hefty is strong, maybe he can tell me what an Ine is.
How did you know he was going to do that? It's a good conversation starter. What did you tell him? The truth. That he was a family heirloom.
Already there. But Simon... Yes, darling? I may have been wrong about the beard. It does make you look a little... ...older, if you don't mind my saying so.
- I always use protection. You know me. Concentrate, darling. Our mission is to retrieve the bank records from the Valecross safe. It's in the Manchester suite.
The lieutenant's not giving you a vacation, son. You're going home. There's nothing to worry about... Your war is over. No, it's not over.
Social support programs for schoolchildren, where they can think outside the box. Where they learn to believe in themselves: Yes, you can do it! This port once supplied thousands of ships from all over the world. It can rise from the ashes.
Here it is. There it is. That's the tree. I'm sure of it. It had fallen. The lightning struck it.
And then what? Forgiveness does not establish a relationship. It's just about letting go of his throat. Mack, the pain inside you is eating you up. It robs you of joy and cripples your ability to love.
Taft? Raymond. How's the novel coming? It's difficult. My publisher says it has to be 120 pages long.
Did they succeed with their memories? Like the crew, Lulu's memories were destroyed. Since we're going to be here for a while, would it be possible to trim the fucking growth? I recommend we move O'Neill to the rec room. It's only got one entrance, but it's bigger, and he wouldn't have to feel like he was in solitary confinement.
Feelings you should never feel. A special patent code from Glen Crest has been embedded into the DNA of every GC person. A fingerprint. It was to remain inactive. And only be used for tracking. And it causes neurological disorders that are irreversible.
Will it soon? Get your foot off my car! Yes, sir. That foot's coming right off. But before it gets out of there, let me try to explain. A-all right.
- You take the credit. - All right. - Thanks anyway. Just solve the case. He's driving me crazy.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes. Your time is up. Tell me about your boss, Moriarty. Who? I know it's him. It's got to be him.
I thought I was the only one who survived. I need to see him. Now. Was your flash drive kept safe before you gave it to John? Of course. It was our insurance policy.
Don't get your knickers in a twist. What? I didn't believe it when they said you were coming. I lay awake all night thinking about how Gunpei and I had dreamed of this moment. And now it has come.
Mean as anything. He can do something about them while they're still small. (ROARS) But you better not wake the big one. - How big is he?
(ROARS) But you'd better not wake the big one. - How big is he? - Much bigger. He killed his whole family.
- Some even do advertising. - Is that so? Serial murder is an expression of power and ego. A signature of human destruction. For full satisfaction, he needs.... the spotlight.
- Soldiers. The tick-tack tickets, please. I don't want to complain, but the room is empty. Are you out of ideas? It's not empty, Sherlock.
We are the competition! We are at war. The puppies are winning and we babies are losing. Thanks, Teddy. And if the new puppy is so cute, it might put the babies out of business, baby.
We hired them and they are stealing from us. This is heresy of the highest order. All command modules, fire with intent to kill. Where is the nearest habitable planet? It's called Berhert.
Are you going to ask out of turn again? Can I stay on earth? I can't say that. Why rain? - Because it washes everything clean.
I got a picture of better business models. My sister... What was the name of the lake? Moose Lake. My sister, as business manager, dumped so much waste into Moose Lake that it exploded.
- Is that possible? - Yes. But it does not make sense. There are no monasteries there where the contact with the plane is broken. And the Order of the Crane Mother doesn't exist. Unless Kyle's an idiot who can't do research. No. Sir, it's not mentioned anywhere. But what he said makes me think he might be the one who came back from the dead.
Of course. Why did you wait so long? To come back. The way was closed. I had to wait until it opened.
I am Madame Gao. Do you remember the Katsura tree in K'un-Lun Square? You were in K'un-Lun. Its shade stretches for miles. And when it blooms, it smells like brown sugar.
He hid it in big clay jars and let it ferment in the bell tower in winter. My friend Davos and I, when we were children we waited until the monks were asleep and climbed the tower. We drank secretly and filled up the jugs with water so that no one would notice that anything was missing. The wine was so sweet. In the depths of winter, it tasted warmly of summer.
Me too. You know, that coat of feigned bravery you wear.... I know why you wear it. I do the same thing. It keeps people out, but... You don't need it with me.
Don't expect anyone here to listen to a kid who did his master's in a monastery. You don't have to attack him. - Danny's plan is... - A child's idiotic dream. Karen Page at the Bulletin liked it.
Claire too. I'll be fine on my own. What about Radovan? I know where he is. I have a plan, but it's dangerous.
Their power reaches far. We're not taking any chances. Good speed, boys. This place looks familiar. It should.
You are right. There is no room here. The floor plans show the entire building, and according to this, there should be a room in this place. Why do you wall up a room? Because it holds a secret.
That was close. It must mean something. It must be something important. Otherwise, he wouldn't have hidden it so well. And this note. What does it mean?
- I'm putting you at risk. - I'm tired of explaining this. It is very strong. For your protection, the store must seem closed. It is closed!
Believe me, this will drown you. What do you want with our city? Your city? This place belongs to the hand. It always has.
Let's go. Just a minute. Did you hear that? Dis. The hammer grazes something before hitting the side.
You don't talk me into anything anymore. Now tell me... What are your plans for New York? It's time for it to fall. The elevator. It's going down.
Good. Clarify the coordinates and find connections. In Brest, students have discovered a cellar with talking plants. A fortune teller from Kishinev predicts all natural disasters of the 21st century. In Armenia, at the foot of Mount Ararat, tourists have seen a stone man. He suddenly disappeared under an avalanche of stones.
You will not defeat me! I created you! No, August. You have made another mistake. That's how they created themselves. The sudden attack of unknown people was ended as abruptly as it began.
Look at that smile. I love it when you smile. You make me happy. I think this place makes you happy. It's like it's speaking to you.
Delaney's will leaves him everything. Including Nootka. Do we have a copy of the Nootka sound contract yet? Our lawyers could take a closer look at it. It hasn't turned up yet, Sir Stuart.
Come on, load the ship! What about your faith, Coop? - My what? - Your religion, your faith. After many years in your service, he's going in rags, Your Highness.
Like your father's clothes when he danced on the shore and lit his fires. Brace, where did my father keep his most important things? What exactly are you looking for? The contract on Nootka Sound. It could be buckskin.
Why did you wade through the river to see me dead? It was shallow and I couldn't see well. Your turn. The saltpeter we stole had already been sold to the navy. It belonged to the crown.
But now I know the secret in her head. And it excites me and makes me angry. And she likes it. Since you've been back, there's something murderous about sex with her. It exhausts us.
What time is it? It's me, boss. Sorry. We have a problem. The Rolling Stone article is out, and it's not good.
And so Glen finally got his talk with the president. The firing probably wasn't the conversation he wanted, but, well, you can say it was a part in the history books. That was very exciting for me. But, unfortunately, my article didn't make the changes I had hoped it would. It was just another article about a celebrity crash.
And wanted to make him disappear somewhere. That's why I needed the car. Then let's do it together! Look at the moon. It's so beautiful how it's reflected in the water.
Stiles. Your son. Uh-huh. And maybe the signal overlapped? Peter gave us the keys to the jeep, and it started.
The lightning strikes the arrester, which sends it into the tunnel. We grab the Ghost Rider, shove him into the bunker, - and hold him prisoner. - OK. How do we stop him from escaping again before we catch him? Well, when the lightning strikes again, it hits our arrester again.
I really hope it's not up there. Let's split up. Hey, check this out. The crack is not above us. It's below us.
Is probably a tongue twister. But... it was the closest thing to "Mischief." His mother called him that until.... I remember when... when Stiles got his Jeep. It was his mother's.
It may not be better, but at least it's not that one. Noah. Come out of there. Did you know about this room? Why was it sealed?
- This was a bad idea. - It's not a bad idea. It's a terrible idea. I told you where the transformer is. I told you how it works.
Your father is a ruthless cheat who always has a devious plan to harm everyone around him. What happens when he gets out of this bed? Do you have a plan of your own? I have a plan. - I don't know if he is devious.
She is really old, that's true. What was her body like? What did it look like? I mean, it was tight. - He was tight?
Take a lesson from Johnny Large sometime. I don't know any Johnny Large. Johnny Large is released after five years, goes to the airport, gives the woman at the counter his ticket. She wants his driver's license, he gives it to her. She says, "It's expired." He says, "It may not be valid, but it's a very good ID.
On my feast days, they still feast on eggs and rabbits and sweets and everything in my name. A serious question, my dear. No doubt many millions exchange gifts and observe the rituals of your feast, even to the point of hunting the hidden eggs, but does anyone still pray in your name? Do they call him at devotions? They babble your name, but they have no idea what it means.
It has been raining. Do you hear the rain? Do you hear it? Look for it. Tell me when it's there.
It's not a microphone. I use it to put a tracking device under his skin. Like a mosquito bite. Here. This is how he leads us to the hostages.
-That's right. Where have those brain waves gone? What I mean is: there is a new plane of existence. Yes, there is no longer any doubt about it, but you can't define it exactly. When you see a train leaving the station, do you need to know where it is going in order to believe your eyes?
Three months ago I treated a very young patient with brain tumors. Very sad. She reacted to my diagnosis as if I had handed her a winning ticket. And not because she hoped to go to a better place, but because the discovery fooled her into thinking it was a guarantee. Well, death was always something we had to live with, and now it's a convenient way to escape the pain.
I was sitting in this Hollywood restaurant with dark wood and red leather chairs between my lawyer and Milton Berle and Milton Berle undoes his pants and lets his cock hang out. He just unwraps it in front of me in this restaurant. I try to keep eye contact with him, but it was more difficult. I kept looking down. He never tried anything, he didn't touch me or play with it. He just took it out and left it hanging outside during the whole meal.
"Pops, you don't have to do it anymore." He said, "Because you are what you are and I am what I am and no matter what comes out of it, we are beautiful." That's what my boy told me. I'm not saying I want to get away from porn. I love porn for what it is and how it can evolve....
You only get one rosebud." I asked, "What does a rosebud mean, please?" They explained to me, "Well, it's when you have an anal prolapse. So your ass has prolapsed. It's turned outward, all right?"
You were no longer booked when they found out you were an escort. You were supposed to be unavailable as a movie star. That meant that not everyone could shoot with you, or have sex with you. Otherwise, why would anyone buy the movie? The movie was supposed to be the only place to get you, otherwise it wouldn't sell.
I'll clean it up later. Tony's waiting. Your helmet, please. Great helmet. It's adorable.
I mean... No. Have you heard of the "male gaze"? No. We have. We don't know exactly what it looks like, but you do.
I know people are talking. Relationships begin. Relationships end. I used to think, "How important is this high school stuff?" Sure it's important, but we're only here four years.
It was written by Paul Desmond, of course, but no matter. To lift the mood, "Gloomy Sunday" would be great, too. Seriously? That song is totally depressing. It's beautiful if you have taste.
If we had known beforehand that she needed help.... Okay, students. Class is about to begin. We're going to watch a movie today, on our current topic, "World War II." It's full of facts, even though it's fiction.
- Ok. Thanks. What should I see? Just a shadow that's settling over the moon. Look, it's getting bigger.
A limo plus driver. That's at least $500. - Why don't you take the Jeep? - It's 100 years old. It's not that old, it's not even paid off yet.
Hannah! Mom, he's not a customer. I see. I'll get my coat. It's in the back, so...
She's going to die anyway. When the Saviors come and find their buddies dead, if they can tell their ass from their head and follow an obvious trail, they will go to the armory and then to the cabin and they will attack the woman. - What's her name? - Maybe they kill her, maybe not, but it will show Ezekiel what to do. Her name. What is it?
I am not a farmer. I need help with this. No, you don't. I saw a blueberry bush outside. When it's young enough, I'll dig it up and plant it here.
Your favorite food. Thank you. Are you still awake? Emma, what's wrong? Dad's accident. Where did it happen?
I've never done this before. - May, come here. It's on. - How are you handling it? I'm pretending that cancer is a contact sport. As long as I move, he can't get me.
Today I learned that Carley died. She was 19. 19 years old, and for the last two years she did almost nothing but fight. All the while, she remained positive and inspired those around her. She was a role model for all of us. She refused to let cancer beat her. And even though she succumbed to it, it didn't win.
That is, you are guarding my body. Isn't that right? Not if you're robbing a bank. Now my body is going into the bank. He's not robbing it.
- Crystal. I just talked to Tammy. My mind is made up. Denise has caused enough trouble already. - Matt. Are you familiar with the term "optics"? It's overused in PR. But it's important.
So come on. My people found something that will help us. Are we going somewhere? The 77 bus is my home right now. It runs around the clock and is never empty.
But his words are dwarfed by what he has done for this city. He made this city into something. If we remove his name from a building, we betray San Vicente. And I would rather die than betray my city. Leave the name as it is. As it should be.
It's only fair. - I'm not taking your money. Buy yourself a new truck. My truck fits me. It barely runs anymore!
If you take a seat here, sir. Wine and food list for you? I know them by heart, thank you. Unbelievable, but the judge stood by it. He says if the dog is in the will, he can contest it.
From a plantation in Kenya. - Gladly. Nice to see something else in this building from Africa. Try out the chair. It was built to stimulate thinking and creativity.
You move in or you're dead. Fortunately, he did not fall in with anarchists. Those beasts killed all the monks. Don Lluís, don't take it amiss, but the war is won by whoever wants it. I just want it to stop.
This shameless one is now my husband thanks to you. You owe me respect, as my name is Carlana. Out. Dear fellow citizens, we didn't think we would be able to celebrate the village feast... but thanks to a generous donation from our Señora, today we can once again pay homage to the Holy Virgin of Olivel. The war has brought us hunger, fear and hatred. But it cannot rob us of our faith in the Blessed Virgin of this place!
Anytime. Carrie. Hey. How was your day? It started with someone throwing a coffee cup at me.
- But I do not see God. - He was there, in all of us. - Praise be to him. The news of the victory spreads throughout the land. Let the people hear that it was God-given.
I expect you to keep everything gleamingly pure. "Gleaming?" Pure. The stove is like a servant. You have to kick it sometimes to make it work.
But then I wrote an article about youth fashion on the street. Do you really want me? Some people get transferred off the team. The Masterson story. "War. What good is it?"
When they show up, you tell them exactly how to find me. You got that? Vince is dangerous, but he's not crazy. As long as you don't get in his way, he won't hurt you. If I help you with the safe, I get 10,000? Even if it's empty like Al Capone's? If it's empty, where's the money coming from?
Lonnie drags the boy out of the car and throws him with his back on the ground. Fixes his arm between two stone blocks. And then he says to me: With both legs. As hard as you can. Aim for the elbow. Boom. Okay? You break an elbow like that, it never grows back together right.
Don't talk about Karen like that. Not even as a joke. It's not a joke, she's really hot. I like her black lipstick. Then it matches the blue eye I'm about to give you.
I'll drive you away too. Sadness does not frighten me. I'll stay here until the cavalry comes. That train out there is derailed pretty bad. As if it were chugging peacefully through the countryside here.
- What's the problem? - It's holding Hugh's hand. His pulse is 165. - Sho, is the glove secure? - It's very tight.
It's squeezing. Kat, you all right? Yes. The suit's thick enough. It's wrapping around your leg.
And that would mean that Zack was also a teenager at the time of death. I'll start with the facial reconstruction and see if I can find anything on the missing persons. What about the cause of death? Nothing obvious, but look at the lower edge of the L4 vertebra. The scoring indicates that it was cut with some kind of saw.
The bone is smooth, but the contour is indented, which means the age is between 20 and 29, just like our victim. Yes. Good work, Ms. Warren. I couldn't agree more. Except, look. He's also sharp with irregular projections.
The skull was still pretty much covered in carbon, but I don't think I missed anything. And then go closer to the lower jaw. Oh, right, I see what I missed. The degradation on the mandible. It points to support zone loss.
A parasitic roundworm. Yes. And the good news is that this guy is still alive. Okay. I am so gonna cancel that hayride with Michael Vincent. Angela, I assure you, the worm had nothing to do with the hay. It most likely came from inside the victim and was released after death.
- Okay. Dr. Fuentes, I couldn't help but notice that you're not wearing your new gown. Did I get the wrong size? No, no. No, no, it's perfect.
When you eat a sugary cookie, the sugar lures you away like a Trojan horse, but inside the cookie is a huge amount of butter or shortening. And that makes you fat. And then that part leads to diabetes, which is high-fat food, not so much the sugar. Sugar is not good for you. It doesn't have any nutrients in it.
But in this area, almost everyone has either asthma or cancer. My neighbor just died last year probably from cancer. My nephew down the street has cancer, he has terminal cancer, stage four. He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink. And it's not in the lungs, it's in the lymph nodes.
My nephew down the street has cancer, he has terminal cancer, stage four. He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink. And it's not in the lungs, it's in the lymph nodes. When you live here and you see how they are kept, you don't eat pork anymore. I don't eat bacon because I don't know where it comes from.
-Jimmy! Don't think that I will ever forget what happened here today. And you will pay for it. You didn't mention my backyard. Well, your garden is part of the backyard, so it's automatically included in the ground that goes to Jenn.
We are almost ready. I'll be... with you in a minute. Oh! And mention my lily pond. It's in my backyard.
So really, I have to say, I'm pretty envious. So this is all just a bunch of crap? Including the key? No, the key was real. And it means everything.
I told you to change that. Look, I was right. You were wrong. Remember my Bigfoot? It's called Heart Enterprises, and they're behind everything -- the junkies, the drivers.
Come on. Chad... look at the floor. But I... What did I tell you about mopping? When this place goes down the toilet, it goes down the toilet clean!
- Lab rats for what? Bad monkey! Candy? Not just candy, what's in the candy. Heart wanted to rework sugar to stop it making you fat, which Smax does not.
Your skills are a good fit for our internal defense systems. Exactly. I'm glad you feel the same way. Security is a big responsibility, Christopher. But it also has coveted perks.
Do you know where we are? This is Majora. Our home. They call us barbarians, but that's not necessarily barbaric, is it? The sperm donors left this resort because it didn't make them enough money.
- Claireview rehabilitation center for women? You know it? We were inmates there, tortured by their guards, their husbands, but we burned that hellhole down. If you still want to find Claireview, just head north and look for the crater? Maybe it's still smoking.
A bit barbaric? Perhaps. Shamefully pedantic? No doubt. But my goodness, if it serves its purpose.
In both victims, the prefrontal cortex was damaged. The demon feeds on negative emotions. Anger, hatred. The host acts violently because of this. We scan for venom and heat signature and find the host before it strikes.
Weakens the nerve endings. I'm fine. Why did you call me here? Your bite. It was so strong.
She's about this tall, with braids, always wears a scarf. Hey, where did you get that scarf? Nowhere. I found it. It's mine.
You are not my son. Clary is not your sister. Jace! Don't. The Angel Goblet is out there. Only he knows where it is.
I don't know. Good question. - Where did my yogurt go? - Another good question. Do you know where it is?
It's in our blood. True. Yes. So, Gus, what's your last name? What country is that from? It has Scottish and German roots.
- Here. I'll clean it up. You won't see it afterwards. That's not what I'm worried about. When a dog poops, it marks its territory.
I went there to sign a lease. I do not know. But what? Nothing. It's stupid. It had questions, okay?
I do not know. But what? Nothing. It's stupid. It had questions, okay? It had questions about the last three years.
That was Prometheus. I fired the arrows. Look, earlier, Thea urged me not to take the blame for others. What happened to Malone was Prometheus' fault, not yours. Well, Quentin, that clue would mean more if it wasn't coming from Thea right now.
- The prosecutor came to me and.... You are referring to Adrian Chase? That's correct. He instructed me to amend the report to suggest that the throwing star killer was responsible. This report. And you did that and signed it, even though you knew it was wrong, and then it was passed on to the police.
If you knew what he wanted, why would you train him? You killed his father, and I helped him in his quest for revenge because you killed mine in the meantime! I never told you my full name, did I? No, you didn't. It is Talia al Ghul.
If you kill me, you are really only killing yourself. Four, three, two, one. 145 seconds. That's how long my father fought underwater before he died. According to my father's autopsy, your arrow pierced his aortic arch, but it didn't kill him.
Kovar invites the important members of the government, politicians and military people for the most part, to the opening of his casino. Then he kills them with Sarin gas, even the innocent? That's not good for business. Yes, but being responsible for the whole country is good for business. We have to get into that casino, and we have to stop the attack before it happens.
That's why it pains me to tell you that there was an attempt by the Solntsevskaya Bratva to disrupt these festivities and assassinate every single government representative here. But don't worry. We have everyone in custody. I was told that they were planning a gas attack on this room. But although the attack was successful, unfortunately, it backfired and every single one of them was killed.
- I looked into your IRC window. I guess I hacked it. - What? - The scrambler is encrypted. I should have known, it's encrypted.
- What is strange? No Storm. Anywhere. What are the odds that Oliver forgot to pay his electric bill? Tiny, considering I wired this place so it wouldn't go off the grid....
What, to Starling City or to that awful place? Does that scowl mean you've given up? Not exactly. The concrete is a proprietary mix. It's used by a special construction company.
He needs space. Another warlock is needed. There you are. Any word on the mole? Well, he's certainly clever.
It protects something important. It is the mirror of the angels. Jocelyn had it? Yeah, crazy, the mirror and the chalice. Mom probably knew it was safe with Elliot.
Who wants chow mein and fortune cookies? - Me. - Yes! Find anything? I'm starting to narrow down the hiding place. You know if you have the mirror, it belongs to the Clave?
The mirror is the lake Lyn. - We have to leave. - What happened? My position in the Institute has been blown. Where is the mirror? I said, where is it?
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES This would be the perfect vacation for the Faitelsons. It can certainly change lives.
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES The moment of crossing the border. It is mostly minor, almost unnoticeable.
- What's that? - That's Joe's panic alarm. He must be on the train. The train will never make it to a stop... It won't stop in time. We have to get everyone off.
- What is happening here? - We are going to move the train. - How are we going to do that? I'm going to vibrate it. I'll vibrate it fast enough so it can phase through there.
Yeah, that's what they told me. Cisco told me, or showed me...that you guys haven't been a team for a long time. And I know I'm the reason why. Iris' death shouldn't have taken me away from you guys. I mean... I mean, it should have brought me closer to you.
I... It's getting pretty hot in here. What else is unique about the shellac flakes? It's the accelerant used in all the arson cases associated with Heat Monger. Such an embarrassing name. I like it.
It is you. It is the same person. It's just confusing. Give me the Girard processor. It will help boost his neocortical and medial frontal lobes.
"Animal Attack." A girl named Hayden Foster is in the hospital and her brother has lost his heart. Looks like a werewolf. Well, they don't usually leave survivors. Freak probably got caught before he could finish the job.
Hello? This is Agent Beatrice Quimby. Thank goodness. There's a bear here. He's as big as a fucking tank.
This is agent Beatrice Quimby. Lucky. There's a bear here. He's as big as a damn tank. I think he wants my picnic basket!
And yes, at first I was shocked at how Sam and Dean operate. But what Lady Bevell doesn't mention are the lives they saved, the monsters they destroyed, and better results achieved not because of the Code, but because of Sam and Dean Winchester's sense of what is right. And that's the whole point. The code is not a suggestion. It is indispensable.
And that is the point. The code is not a proposal. It is indispensable. The Code is what distinguishes us from the monsters. It is the order by which we all live.
Each of them had years of experience. We received a letter from Eileen. Eileen? She sent it four days ago. It was sent by mail because she thought her phone and computer had been hacked.
- This path is only for goats. - Be silent and watch your feet. God bless you. The battering ram here... It won't work. It won't break down the gates, but it will work. In its own way.
Lots of light and a brand new high pile carpet. All brushed in one direction. It's wonderful. You know what my favorite upstairs is? -The laundry chute. -Just wonderful. It's just...
I died with a sign in my hand Last situation. A truck is coming right at you. The brakes are out. On the right, he would drive into five children.
Last situation. A truck is coming straight at you. The brakes are out. On the right, he would drive into five children. And on the left, he'd hit a businessman.
Baudelaires, do you know the term "in loco parentis"? Sounds Latin. Latin and legal. "In loco parentis" means "acting in the role of a parent." A legal term. It refers to Count Olaf.
You'll have to ask Vince, man. I'll call him later. Tell him I did a good job, all right? I'm gonna go get the car. Where is it?
- Why are you sitting in the dark? - I ask myself the same question. My goodness, I may have had an afternoon. Two hours ago, I get the sea bass out. No sooner is it prepared and resting than bang!
Perhaps the worst experience of my life. I was proven... in front of an audience and without any doubt that a battery... a fully charged battery... lay almost directly on my skin for almost two hours. And I didn't feel a thing. What does that mean to you? This state. For me it is as real as this chair.
I was proven... in front of an audience and without any doubt that a battery... a fully charged battery... lay almost directly on my skin for almost two hours. And I didn't feel a thing. What does that mean to you? This state. It's as real to me as this chair. It is as real as this house.
And I didn't feel anything. What does that mean for you? This condition. It is as real to me as this chair. It's as real as this house. As real as you. But what if he isn't?
This state. It is as real to me as this chair. It is as real as this house. As real as you. But what if he isn't? What if I'm imagining all of this? And if that's the case... If he's not real then what have I done?
How about this for a start? - He gave us the first commercial. - Yeah, I know. Okay, how about this? We'll give you $450 for the spot that already aired...and go on our own. I don't mean to quibble. But you don't actually own this commercial. It is the physical and intellectual property of Saul Goodman Productions.
Can I join you, Jughead? If you want. What are you working on? My novel. It's about this summer and Jason Blossom. 17 years old.
Probably the shot that killed Jason Blossom. We know what the police know. That a shot was fired and a boy died. Not by whom. We know when it was fired.
To whom I do not have to apologize for what I am. For what I want. What is this? By the way, my lipstick is called "Maple Red." In case you're wondering why it tastes so sweet.
Just forget it, okay? All right, I'll see you. I don't want to go to Toledo. I'll just take the next long-distance bus. I don't care where it goes.
I'm working on something. Are you? What are you working on? I'm working on an exciting novel. I think in the right hands, when it's finished, it'll make a good short film.
I was just upset because my brother showed up out of nowhere.... - You'll be provided with one. - He can be a real asshole. Where's your proof? Where is he?
She wasn't nice. She used Norman like she used you. She didn't deserve to die. Death isn't about earning it. It's just part of the business.
We don't do this very often. I want it to be great. I'm going to work in one piece. If girls night out is a bust, come see me. It won't be, but thanks anyway.
- You're playing dead. - It's not like that. The photos are a confrontation with death, show its beauty. - Death is not beautiful! It is final!
Back then, barbers performed operations. My poor hair. Okay, now I use a vacuum. It's like a vacuum cleaner. It sucks everything out of the uterus.
Pajamas for everyone. I got one for everyone. I fixed the mirror. I tried. It looks perfect.
You can't hold that against me. You bet I can. The best bagels in town are baked by a bigot! We should have put more effort into the chorus. It's alliterative, it ends in bigot, it's perfect.
They bug phones, watch bank accounts, and I.... We need a new center. Okay? This place... It's far away from any law enforcement agency in the U.S., and the money is just flowing there.
- Exactly. The nice thing about fishing is that most of the time nothing happens, so you have plenty of time to talk. And what did you want to talk about? Another item on the list. I know why it's there, but... you shouldn't want to do that.
Who is supposed to remain objective? Don't answer him. - I like your hat. - Thanks. - It's new.
- Everyone asks me about it... - We have baked. That's all. There was an icing incident, but it was totally PG. It was... 13 and up, but...
Despite their differences, despite their mistrust. Together. We must do the same if we are to survive. Because the enemy is real. It has always been real.
Something activates the dormant virus and only Arias knows what it is. Until we find out... everyone is a potential weapon for him... the living and the dead. If we don't figure this out... there won't be any small towns left where you can drown your sorrows... in alcohol ever again. I found a vaccine. I tried it on myself and it works.

But until we figure out how Arias activates the virus... Who knows if it'll work on everyone else.
On their own, these viruses are either not effective... or there is a risk that they activate themselves. But in combination... ...they become an effective bioweapon that can be controlled. Very well done, professor. No wonder you survived Raccoon City. If the trigger is airborne... ...it's harder to control where it flies and who it hits.
Hey, Ana. How you doing? How about we get you out of here? I'm gonna put this jack under the steering wheel. It'll take the pressure off your legs, okay?
Frankie! Your car is in the middle of the road. Crap, I left my car in the middle of the road! Not bad. Wow, a lot lighter than... Never mind. It's a lot lighter than mine. It's a lot lighter than mine.
-Naturally, he looks good! Not ugly. Grace, this is exactly the kind of talk we save for afterwards! Grace, do you have the TV? Yeah, it's in my bag.
They were sent from outside the block to fix our mess, which is not only embarrassing, but could have serious consequences. We need to find Broussard and return our hosts' artifact. And nothing in your resume or work so far leads me to believe that you are useful for this challenge. Sir, I've been working on this block for six months. I know the history of the resistance, know how it's structured.
Yes. - I like to say your name. A delight. - How nice. It rolls off the tongue like that.
- No, I can't. - What are you talking about? Look. Think about it, Sarah. Whatever this place is, it's the answer.
- Almost 5 times, but I turned Rob Lowe down. Twice, in fact. I feel like the pain will never go away. I said the same thing about childbirth. But it did go away.
Even twice. I have the feeling that the pain will never go away. I said the same thing about the birth. But it went away. It will go away.
Don't fuck around. Can I come with you? Are you taking charge of your life? I'm trying. This scent, you can't imagine how great it is.
We prepare and pretend to improvise. Each one as she feels like it. That's how it may be. I'm taking a shower now, I smell like a bush fire. I clean the chair. He would have been my last sight. If you had shot me.
No, that's not an option for me. We have a meeting with Marla at four! Oh, no. What would your pain say? He said, "Ah."
-Yes, ok. -I used to party like this. -Greater. -How about this food truck? -Yeah. It's got a big kitchen.
- I did, yes. Many times. Henry, is that juniper tree still there? You know, the one by the infirmary. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, there's the softest grass. It feels great on your ass.
Oh my... Would be great if there was a lid on it. -I couldn't find it. -It's okay. You'd think it would be by the box.
But... I should jump. I'm sorry. You should be happy for at least a minute. But he was alive. Like Gary.
- Built-in mask. - No. He fell to the ground. Why? He didn't slip, he didn't trip, no one was near him, he wasn't pushed, and he's holding his head like it's about to explode.
The third from the entrance on the right. - Has anyone approached the car? - Not since I've been here. - Do we know which unit it is? - It's in the square for Unit 64.
So far with Grimm... I keep thinking I need to carry the staff with me. And I want to know what's written on the cloth it was wrapped in.
A staff? That's how Nick was able to follow Eve. - The staff didn't go through. - It couldn't. He doesn't belong there.
Come on, honey. Here we go. Nick and I met here to settle our differences about the key. Oh... that. Yeah, we both decided it couldn't fall into your hands.
I showed this to Renard and Adalind. He looks like Zerstoerer. And the staff he carries is pretty similar too. Except his had a lot of cracks in it. Well, I mean, if he's as old as this one, it would make sense that he would have a bunch of cracks.
Look what David has in his hand. Oh, my God. I thought David killed Goliath with a slingshot. He also had a staff, but for some reason that part of the story is not supported. Apparently David left this very staff to his descendants, and the Davidic kings use it as a scepter until the destruction of the temple, when it miraculously disappeared.
We know... And this big staff is to help him make Diana his child bride and destroy the world as we know it. So, long story short, we have to destroy this Destroyer guy or we're toast. Something about Destroyer's staff still bothers me. It was completely broken, as if it had been put together from many different pieces, and none of these texts refer to anything like it.

It was completely broken, as if it had been put together from many different pieces, and none of those texts refer to anything like it. Yeah, something about it bothers me too. I mean... if he's as omnipotent as he apparently is and belonged to all these people he apparently belonged to....
Yeah, something about it bothers me too. I mean... if he's as omnipotent as he apparently is and belonged to all these people he apparently belonged to.... How did this destroyer guy get him in his greasy grasp? I just read something about it. There's a prophecy... about a staff with the power of gods, and it can't be destroyed.
-You will not be unemployed. Carlos destroyed the dialer. I think he's going to stop. I think something else. They're rebuilding it. Miguel says it'll be operational soon. Let's go.
Katroina Bonnet, as she lives and breathes. Pouis Pitt. I'm going crazy. No, you see... Katrina, you'll have to haggle on the alias for me, because it's far too obvious.
Okay, bitch, say something. - You see that? - Go down this row. Wait. Yeah, that room on your left. It has such an indestructible charm about it.
No one gets in without ID. Watch out for vagrants. They are not allowed to use the restrooms. The difference between homeless people and art students should be easy to tell. But it isn't.
But it's reserved. If you want to sit, go to the bar. This is ridiculous. The area has been empty all evening. Hell, it's always empty.
-Yeah, I get it. You've gone into a lot of debt to make yourself even more boring. Really gross. And thanks for never tipping. You'll learn that you can't tell the market what it wants.
So, maybe you tell me yours. Why don't I just show you? The people here really show who they are. The floor is really sticky. It's really downright sticky.
I HAVE MADE FODDER FOR YOU. First, my name is Nasty Gal. Second, this forum should be called David Lynch's Elephant Man, because it is teeming with freaks and sad as shit. Did you guys see the post? -Now it's gone, but yeah.
Who wants to see the horny shit? Here is the horny shit! Here's the horny shit! Yes! Here he comes!
Here is the horny shit! Here is the horny shit! Yes! Here he comes! Here he comes!
Halston Vintage. -It's perfect. -Yeah. Even you have to admit that jumpsuit is great. It would look good in a museum about women astronauts of the 70s.
I wouldn't put up with that. Maybe that's why I'm doing so well. You would definitely be fired, because the job is not for self-centered narcissists. I would never do your job. It's a joke.
What? We're just having a little fun. Yes. And now the fun is over. And what if it's not over, mein Führer?
When are you two coming back to work for me? We don't. I didn't know you had a dog. I didn't. He died.
Let me. Niklaus. We are here. This spell is strong. It's strengthened over time. - Which means it takes time to break it.
No one thinks a petite realtor is going to jump you and rip your throat out. Besides, I kind of enjoy the killing. -Honestly? -Yeah, it's like a rush. I give my body what it needs in an intensely brutal way.
If you want to cheer me up, bring the weed we hid behind the wall of your room at the farm station. Don't leave me hanging, man. Music to my ears. Hey, you want a hug? Hey, the blueprint for the hydro generator and remember it's filled with hydrazine, which forms water when combined with oxygen, so go slow. Otherwise, the hydrazine could blow up.
I don't know. The code is advanced. 5th generation syntax. I have never seen anything like this before. Whenever I want to change it, it goes back to the old one....
- Now you're like a toddler. Unable to process these new feelings or the idea that you don't always get what you want. And you have yet to experience the tension that killing can create. Maybe I'm sensing that now... with you. Destroy this body, sure. It was created just to kill.
- We need to refuel. - Besides, we had no choice. - Because of this room? It's the only place that can contain Aida's teleportation ability. It's equipped with the technology we used to stop Gordon, the first guy we met with these abilities.
My plan will rebuild the world you've grown so accustomed to. - One where Inhumans are hunted. - And we control the rest. It doesn't hurt that we're both unstoppable. But your plan is flawed. It's too clean.
I am as surprised as you are. What happened? The Darkhold. My arm still hurts. Why isn't it healing?
Yes, sir. With pleasure. Any other requests? They had tuna at Loaves and Fishes yesterday. It looked good.
Anyway. She has to sell her house. -Do you have a card? -No, but I have a pen. It's got all the info on it, so anyone can find us. Oh, God, it was in my pocket, now it's gone!
You were right about what you said in the car. I'm not a killer. All right. I can do this on my own. I got a new murder poncho. It's pink, you know, because, why not?
- Yes, I do. I also know that you still have time to - to stop the sale before closing. - Are you kidding? They signed the documents. It's already closed.
I can't believe what we did. Let's get out of here! -I'd be ready. -Not yet. There he is. Oh, God, no!
Let's get out of here! -I'm ready. -Not yet. There he is. Oh, God, no! Where is he?
-You're pissing again. -Can't stop it. Here you go. Finally. Is it encrypted?
Do it, or I will. Mr. Palmer. Apparently, you do not know. This case is over. That's because it's not.
I do not like your husband. - He's my ex-husband! Are you sure? You know about his visit to me? He's a menacing little prick. He won. I'm out.
Jonesy. Thank God! Don't call me "Jonesy." We know about your panic room. Where is it?
I usually have. I have a signal from the surveyor. - Oh no. - What is it? It's obviously in Gertrude's area.
Even if my dad switched sides, he could never have defeated J'onn. Yeah, I would have thought so, too. Thank God you're okay. Jeremiah's arm that we thought had nerve damage? It's been improved.
Always. Cadmus has locked them in cells that are wired to kill them. All Lillian has to do is push a button. I can't turn it off myself, but there's a magnetic field switch in the DEO armory. It turns off the cages.
What is it? I'm trying to decide to blog my article myself. - Is snapper getting mad or something? - Like, really. He's blogged.
Winn bugged Henshaw, set up a remote so I can beam us back if she double-crosses us. Hope for the best... And make sure Winn Schott prepares for the worst. Your stubborn pride still blinds you to the truth. Why is it coming back on?
Who was that? - The cross-eyed religious fitness mom. Don't worry, you'll know them all soon. Do you like the wine? - Yes. It's very good.
- The cross-eyed religious fitness mom. Don't worry, you'll know them all soon. Do you like the wine? - Yes. It's very good. It's a Sauvignon Blanc, but not the regular kind. It's from 2013.
Do you like the wine? - Yes. It's very good. A Sauvignon Blanc, but not the normal one. It's from 2013. It's really good wine. - Sure is. How much did it cost?
Damn. Edie, what's wrong? I lost my earring. Jesus. There he is.
What do I think? You can see what's going on here. He's behind all this. A man who's never served. He wouldn't know war if it bit him in the ass.
But you know what? When I was 11, he took me to Houston for this tour. He wasn't that old, but he was already bald and he was the oldest guy there for miles. The Beastie Boys had a huge... inflatable dick on stage, seriously! It was ten feet tall. And they were having fun... ...poking Dad with it.
I mixed my own colors from flowers and berries. These orange ones are especially bright. I like orange. There's a butterfly. I think it's stuck.
These orange ones are especially bright. I like orange. There's a butterfly. I think he's stuck. Yes, he has a broken wing.
You want me to help you rob the deadliest vampire on the planet? I'll pass. Are you afraid of a fight? Here's an equalizer. The stone is kyanite. It's been enchanted to grant you control over your werewolf nature. Even on a full moon.
Here. There's something you need to see. This guy Dominic, do you trust him? Loyalty's good for business. I bring him a lot of business. This ghost. He's ancient.
Why don't you take out your frustration on the jawbone that our enemies find so fascinating? Gladly. A man of words, not of deeds Is like a garden full of weeds And when the weeds grow It's like a bird on the wall And when the bird flies away It's like an eagle in the sky
Did you see her? I'm gonna go say good night to Hope. Hayley, wait. That's an impressive boundary spell. Unfortunately, it only lasts as long as the witch who cast it.
When the pendant broke, Elijah's mind broke with it. He most likely retreated into the innermost core of his consciousness. - And how do we find that? - I don't. He could be anywhere in over a thousand years of memories, but if we try to fix the pendant before we find him and heal his mind, it is permanently damaged, like putting a cast on a broken bone before it is properly set.
I can't do this alone. We're going to need all the allies we can get. Vincent, Sofya, Klaus. Even Rebekah. Or else this fight will be over before it begins.
If I reach Elijah in time, it should curb the rose bush's poison. How will you find him? - You said he was cloaked. - This is Marcel's poison. The rose bush was created from his blood. It has the same magical signature.
I know the smell of fertilizer. I will not ask again. Freedom, of course. A spirit cannot reveal the true depth of its power. But when it becomes flesh again....
The Lockwoods didn't just protect the bone. They kept files of names, dates and locations. They knew of other families guarding the rest of the bones. Does the name Labonair mean anything to you? Yes, it sounds familiar.
And I don't agree. I think Boo's tree takes more than it gives. - Why is that? - The tree is a sign of goodness. Then it is filled with cement and symbolizes Scout's lost innocence.
Just now my girlfriend called. She didn't say a word. Maybe the riot hadn't started yet? Aren't you listening? He said last night.
Good morning. My name is... is Tasha Jefferson, I'm an inmate here at Litchfield. Two days ago, our friend and fellow inmate Poussey Washington was killed by a guard. Poussey Washington. I'll say her name again, it can't be repeated enough.
I asked the boy to draw a simple little circle. If he did his best in it, maybe he would win me over. With a simple circle. I'll tell you the impression your little circle made on me, John. It lacked focus, ambition, clarity, precision, dedication, passion, and honesty. And ... well... It reminded me of you.
Howdy! Great to see you, man. That's awesome. How was your flight? It was great.
She has the fishhook. -So... -Does it come with instructions? I'm not big on instructions, so it'll fit. But if it says in a book that it's edible, we can....
Where's Liam? Come join me on stage, little brother. Put your hands up, sweetie. Watch out, my reach is longer. Thank you for coming, and please enjoy the palace and all it has to offer.
The one percent. - The one percent. - That's right. I want to keep my one percent neck. I just had it tightened up in January after Colicchio said it had more rings than a cookie roll.
- I'm about to die. - Ice cream from the prison store? - You bet. Observe the applicable closing times. "Amanda, I'm not stopping until my ass is so small it disappears altogether.
Emori. John, what's going on? Looks like we'll be needing my people after all. There's a storm coming. When it arrives, we need to be on the right side of the gate.
Are we ready to start if we have to? We are prepared for the extraction of the fetus. And this composite was made to simulate a subhuman uterus. The fetus will develop normally? Just as if it were in a healthy mother.
"The younger hunter asked the old people where he could get such a boomerang." "The old ones told him about a special tree." "So the younger hunter went out to carve himself a stronger and much larger boomerang." "But the younger hunter did not notice that the blood of the tree was flowing hot like lava." "It was the blood that made the older hunter's boomerang so powerful." "He would split his prey, killing it instantly."
- He can't do that. - He's already doing it. Then we have to stop him. Underwater, its scales shimmered like jewels. And this fish was so big, so big, that when he moved his fin, huge waves crashed onto the shore.
You are not the only one who is special, little brother. You used to fight for the right causes, Waruu. The younger hunter, he made a stronger, much bigger boomerang. He takes the boomerang, smears it full of blood like lava. He travels so fast and with so much power.... He cuts through the hunter, killing him instantly.
Perfect waters. But freezing cold, okay? So I open my fly box. And it's not my fly box. And... it's empty.
This... This is your property. When I first came here, you pointed out this river here, and I noticed it flows west. West? Okay, you follow this river, its entire course, all the way up to Jefferson City... it eventually flows into the Missouri.
This is your property. When I was here the first time, you referred to this river here, and I noticed it flows west. Westbound? Okay, you follow this river, its entire course, all the way up to Jefferson City... it eventually flows into the Missouri. According to this, it's not a tributary, it's a true tributary of the Missouri.
Maybe... Maybe a celebration would be the thing. I miss your sister. When the trial is over, I'm sure Meg will be in touch. Then I hope it's over soon.
- We'd be safer in your bunker. - There are no supplies there. - I told you, I ate it all. - Then we'll fill it up again. You said it was big enough for two.
Dad and I looked at it the last time we were there. Nothing will probably happen, but we should hurry, just in case. Okay? Start the engine! Hurry up, it's getting thicker.
No one has to die. You should go. Please. The engine room is right below us. If it explodes, you'll destroy the entire ship.
Okay. Suggestion. Remember that Sumerian protection spell we learned in school? How to protect yourself from shattered glass or something? The spell is simple, but it doesn't mean it's not powerful.
Can you imagine Gabe as a Republican? "Chaz, why don't you spend the summer on my huge boat? The deck is built from the bones of endangered rhinos." "Roland, you have to try the caviar. It tastes like the salty tears of the poor."
We report live from the Piedmont Hotel. Better not show the name on your press pass. People out there love their president. I love sponge cake. That doesn't mean it's good for me.
And I say, "Good shot." - Good shot. But first, I want to talk about the very first Honda NSX. Here's a photo. When the car came out in 1990, it was remarkable because it was fast and exciting like a Ferrari. But unlike Ferraris of the time, it was also incredibly reliable and very easy to drive.
Honda scrapped it twelve years ago. But now there's finally a successor. And I tried it out on our test track. Here it is. It costs 138,000 pounds, about the same as a Porsche 911 Turbo S.
But now there is finally a successor. And I tried it out on our test track. Here it is. It costs £138,000, about the same as a Porsche 911 Turbo S. It has the futuristic lines you'd expect from top Honda models.
And when it first gets up to speed... Other turbocharged engines often start to groan at high revs. But because the twin-scroll turbocharger sits in the V of the engine, coincidentally just like in the Ferrari California, the tachometer immediately rockets up to the red zone. This engine... is a masterpiece. A downright gem. It may look like a Wolseley, but it doesn't drive like one.

It may look like a Wolseley, but it doesn't drive like one. It has a top speed of 305 mph. This car is a Ferrari wearing a four-door old man's slip. That brings me to the gem of this car. At normal speeds, it's pretty quiet and civilized.
It has a top speed of 305 km/h. This car is a Ferrari wearing a four-door old man's slip. That brings me to the gem of this car. At normal speeds, it's pretty quiet and civilized. And although it looks like the wheels have been unscrewed from a sofa, it is very comfortable. Even when you press that button and activate rumble mode.
The time for Jeremy's Alfa Quadro Carpaccio. Snail's pace! Underground! On a dry track, he would have made 1:15. He wouldn't have.
True. - Yes, they are real. The names are real. We'll continue the pointless comparison later. It's not "pointless."
There is a gas station right around the corner. We can't go back out there. How much time do you think we have before something happens? It seems like the fog picks up every now and then, right? It gets thicker when we're outside, and kind of disappears when we're not.
We can't go back out there. How much time do you think we have before something happens? It seems like the fog picks up and picks up, right? It gets denser when we're out, and kind of disappears when we're not. Yeah, it was pretty dense when Mikhail, you know....
It seems like the fog picks up every now and then, right? It gets denser when we're outside, and kind of disappears when we're not. Yeah, it was pretty dense when Mikhail, you know... Okay, okay. So we'll wait for it to dissipate a little bit, and then we'll run.
Lost my faith? How could I? I have just seen a demon appear and smoke rise from the pit to torture humankind, just as it says in the Gospel. I am not afraid of losing my faith. I am afraid because it is stronger than ever.
I thought you said all of this was beautiful. O, it is. So is the eruption of a volcano or a tsunami. Few things are as beautiful as destruction, but that doesn't mean I enjoy it. So, this fog, - you also hope that it will disappear?
So is the eruption of a volcano or a tsunami. Few things are as beautiful as destruction, but that doesn't mean I enjoy it. So, this fog, - you also hope that it will disappear? - Yes, of course. And it will... as soon as it has what it came for.
Few things are as beautiful as destruction, but that doesn't mean I enjoy it. So, this fog, - you also hope that it will disappear? - Yes, of course. And it will... as soon as it gets what it came for. What do you think it came for?
It somehow affects us on a physiological level. I just don't know how yet, but if I can figure it out, I can save people. This will slow down your metabolism and hormone release. Maybe I can slow down the effect of the fog on us. If it doesn't attack after about 30 seconds, I'll know I'm on the right track.
Nathalie, where's Link? All right, all right. You don't have to tell me, but.... The mist came. He saved me.
All right, all right. You don't have to tell me, but.... The fog came. He saved me. He saved me from him
Your Honor, are we going to allow the defendant to speak? He can only make it worse. Hey, guys, I think I found something. Franklin's journals didn't contain any other references to the Despair Creature, but he did refer to the report of a freed slave who had a run-in with it at Valley Forge. I found the report, but it is written in some kind of handwritten code.
I heard your husband was on the helicopter? So was my daughter. Sometimes pilots make a stop in bad weather. The sky was clear last night. Yes, it was.
Have you ever lost hope in the last ten months, three weeks and four days? Good question. Have I lost hope? I can say that when I came to, I had lost hope. But the body does a wonderful thing when it's up against the wall and can't get out:
Now I hear that there are less and less. Therefore, the marmot hunt was banned. First we put two hot stones in the hind legs and a big stone in the rear. Then meat, then two or three stones, more meat and stones until it is full. Last time, one stone was too sharp. It pierced the skin.
We have to make people feel safe. Otherwise they will leave. Every single one of them. We have to protect this ranch with our lives. Otherwise they'll be slaughtered. Every last one of them. This place is all we have left. And right now, it's in jeopardy.
I gave it to someone... -What does it say? -I don't remember. Marga! The letter, where is it?
When he was here, he didn't mention Denmark. What did he mention? You, and how you took his crown. Aethelwold has too little to do. My advice is what it has always been: put him on trial and kill him.
Alfred wants to give you one last chance. Do you have a plan? We travel downriver, meet the armies of Merzien and Wessex, and camp at Lunden. - Do you have a plan of attack? - I have. It is not unlike yours.
I can do this. Raven says the black rain will be here soon. Raven is right. I used to love the rain. Now it scares me.
It's so good to hear your voice. I have bad news, Abby. The black rain is here. It's worse than we thought. It's corrosive to the touch.
I have some bad news, Abby. The black rain is here. It's worse than we thought. It's corrosive to the touch. It kills.
Their whole theology was based on the end of the world. I have some bad news, Abby. The black rain is here. It's worse than we thought. It burns on contact.
I have some bad news, Abby. The black rain is here. It's worse than we thought. It burns on contact. It kills.
The last guy just died screaming in pain and you want to try again? Make a better suggestion, Raven. So what, we just go out and chase some other guy? Nobody's going anywhere in this storm. Then we wait for it to pass.
Hurry. Echo will send backup. Where is he? Under the altar. He's here.
Retreat! We were brought here for a reason, Gaia. Think. Is there another key? It should have a twelve on it.
I am not here to talk about myself. I am here because of you. I am truly sorry that you lost your job. What can I do to get it back? Nothing at all. It's gone forever.
The group is part of a national program to promote the arts in schools. That's wonderful. And unfortunately, it could all end soon. When Congress appropriated the grant, it built in a sunset clause. The grant must be renewed every five years. - When does it expire?
I offered to fly over and talk to them in person, but apparently their mother has a cousin who lives here, so we flew them in instead. Some cases end well and you can forget about them. But some become a part of who you are. This job will change you. And not only that, it will show you who you really are.
- No, there must be... Hi. We're not bothering your robot. - What? - He kissed me.
It's whacky. There's time travel and Oedipal stuff in it.... Look at me. If you make GLOW, I'll make any crazy time travel sex orgy movie you want. What's it called?
Now comes the "but." He enters the wrong date and travels back in time to the 1950s when she was a horny teenager and she spends the rest of the movie fucking him instead of his father. I've seen the movie. No. I haven't shot it yet. It's called Mothers and Lovers.
No. I haven't shot it yet. It's called Mothers and Lovers. No, buddy. It's called Back to the Future.
Oh boy, a whole five minutes. That's gum. Gum is not lunch. It's not even a snack. It's not filling, but that's all it is.
-That's "Professor Hobbs." -Nice to meet you. Officially, no one met me who wasn't supposed to be here. -Unofficially, I'm pleased too. -I... I tried to get into your class, but it was already full.
I can do laundry, ironing, sweeping, sweeping and much more. I can do everything. I'll take care of the dishes. You will see. I'll do it right. Be careful with the kettle, it is very hot.
Well, well, well! I didn't expect to see you today. It's good to see you. And how are you, dear Anne? Quite well, thank you. - What brings you to me, Miss Cuthbert? - Well, Mrs. Spencer, there seems to have been a mistake and I wanted to know where it was.
Of course you are willing to talk. And the Azgeda Alliance has it surrounded. None of your people will come in unless we come to an agreement. This war is inevitable. The only reason it hasn't broken out yet is because Lexa ordered it.
Then we should break it open. Then he won't protect anyone. Bellamy will find a way. The black rain will keep the clans at bay for now. But when it subsides and they find out what your people have done...
I've been looking all over for you. You shouldn't be here, Monty. None of us should be here. Do you know why the moon is red? It's really red?
- Give me the suit. - Hey, Murphy! Murphy, don't! - What? - Listen. You break that suit, it's not gonna save anybody.
I'll do it. - Help the others into the rover. - Okay. Come on. Clarke, I need you to put on the suit. It was meant for Jasper.
- Help the others into the rover. - Okay. Come on. Clarke, I need you to put on the suit. It was meant for Jasper. At least he's doing something good now.
Now we know the many ways we could die today, why don't you tell us what we need to do to survive? How far is it to the lighthouse? Oh, so you can talk. I wondered about that. It's right behind those trees, sunshine.
- Of course. - Honey, you don't have to stay. - Yes, I do. - For this particular question? - Yes, absolutely. Now. This cup is very small. And it has a sharp plastic rim.
I was lying there. There was a DJ over here on the one-two wooka-wooka part. Okay? And then they had a chocolate fountain. It was like a fountain, but with chocolate!
And then they had a chocolate fountain. It was like a fountain, but with chocolate! You spear a piece of fruit, dip it in the chocolate, and then put it in your mouth. Then you say, 'Another drink! ' You bring the drink, it dribbles down and collects in your belly button.
She's talking to a gorilla. Who wouldn't talk to them?" I had forgotten my wife and shouted, "Ask him how much he can lift! Ask him how much he can lift!"
So she talked to this gorilla, and at one point she gave him a kitten. A little kitten. I immediately thought, "No, not a cat! It's a gorilla." He rips its head off, throws the body away, and plays with the head.
He looks forward to that every day. He learns something and sees his little friend. His vocabulary is incredible. The gorilla is excited. He looks at the woman: "Oh, man!
The woman sits there like this... "Well... So, the... kitten... was hit by a car... And it's dead." The gorilla understood immediately. He understood it immediately.
"So... So, the... kitten... was hit by a car... And it's dead." The gorilla understood immediately. He understood it immediately. His lip began to tremble. He made the sign for "cry."
I have to carry that around with me from now on? How can it stop? Tell me, please. The gorilla understood what death meant. When he understands death, he understands his captivity.
Then you could have freed the gorilla. You come back at night. "You can do it! Get dressed, go!" You take him to the car. You have to take him to the port in the car. It's the only way to get him back into the jungle.
So his job is to attack and take out the best player... mess up the other team. From the looks of it, he's pretty good at it. Fights can also be strategic. A fight can change the dynamic, clear the air, break a stalemate. It also unites the team against a common enemy.
- The top coat, I know. Do you want some water? Do you want me to keep going? I brought my engagement ring with me to Seattle. It's in the house in my jewelry box and I want you to have it.
-No. You two are not going anywhere. We can print the documents here. I know a guy with a printer. I hope he prints.
Marla, everybody. See? You need me. This better not be Marla's bass. It's already been worked on.
Can you keep a secret? My wife is about to be arrested. We think the killer might actually be here. Just tonight she found the evidence. DNA. He's in the car right now.
Then I heard you had a big, beautiful tumor in here. Let me see that. That's, uh... is gigantic. This is true beauty... the Sistine chapel of tumors. He's gone deep into her posterior mediastinum.
These tumors are not pretty. They are scary and smart and built to squeeze the life out of someone - before they could even live it. - Exquisite. What's going on? It's spread to her esophagus.
We can't rebuild her entire chest. If it's in her esophagus, it's probably gone into her spine as well. You'd risk paralysis if you tried to remove it. We can at least remove the tumor from her heart... alleviate some of the symptoms. I mean, it'll grow back, but it'll be slow... buy her some time.
You doctors, you crazy people. You just have to try, you just have to cut people open. Having the tumor mass removed from your heart will alleviate your symptoms and buy you time. Yeah, this tumor, it's just... it's a part of me. It's like my hair or my breasts or my weird looking toes.
Can you help me out? Okay, yeah, one second. Yes? The body adapts. It protects itself.
Okay, yeah, one second. Yes? The body adapts. It protects itself. But it can't completely close itself off, or we're not really living, right?
Oh, my God. Okay. All right, I think I got it. Tell me what you see. I see the rebar, and it's stuck in one of those...
Stop it! Help him! No one will help you. Your name is not Bryan Hunt. It's Jonah Dixon.
What's on? Listen, I have an idea for a movie. I have a really great idea for a movie. I think it might even get an Oscar or something. If we try really hard, it could really be at the Golden Globes.
The earrings are really beautiful. Where did you get them? These? I found them in this great store. It's called...
Can we go now? Yes. - Where would you like to go? - Spring and Lafayette. The movie may be called Death Castle, but I think it sparkles with life.
Yes, I'm in. Without gravity, it doesn't have super speed. News flash, Raymond, I don't need that to get you down. What's the red button for? It disconnects the lunar module from the command module.
It is like a game. Don't be shocked by my words. I assure you, when this is over, they will pay. Thank you. Name your price. It must be fair, or you can keep it.
- Look, a burial mound. Pictish civilization. - The bird! - What about him? He said, "darkness."
- The bird! - What about him? He said, "darkness." Yes, so we hurry, because at this time there is not much daylight left. - But he talked!
- What about him? He said, "darkness." Yes, so we hurry, because at this time there is not much daylight left. - But he talked! - Of course he did. That's a crow.
-A rational ass... -Like me! ...is supposed to choose between two equal bales of hay, but can't decide and starves to death. Perfect, then I can starve instead of choosing. According to Spinoza, the donkey is not rational because it is good to make a choice. Ok. Sometimes the donkey has to choose which pizza he wants.
He's still out there. Fairy dust does not determine what I have to do. Nothing and nobody does. Fairy dust doesn't determine anything. It only shows you possibilities.
You brought me here for a love spell? It's not a love spell. I know they don't work. This arrow is a tool. It lets you take a look at the person you love the most.
Remember how you said this arrow would let me take a look at the person I love the most? Well, it's a fine line between love and hate. Like this. Much better. Now it will lead me to the person I hate the most.
Are you hiding? No. No! The spell should have worked. It should have led me to the person I hate the most.
If you want to kidnap me again, may I politely ask to finish my ale first? I am not here to kidnap you. And I'm... I'm sorry. Now that you're here, may I assume the diabolical plan didn't quite work? It didn't.
Until I get some new candidates, I just want you to keep order and not screw anything up, Brian. No problem, chief. But in the meantime, let me show you how things work at Fitzpatrick. The name Fitzpatrick is synonymous with "mess something up." It's about to be synonymous with "getting fired" if you don't show respect to your new boss.
I want to report a briefcase missing. Yes, I do. I beg your pardon? A briefcase, you idiot! It fell out of a car somewhere in West Essex.
Yeah. Fuck, I love it. Oh, my God. Okay, Philip. Before we finalize the deal and set the purchase price, we need to test the Jacuzzi. It's crucial to the deal. Right, Sam?
I'm not paying for that. But that's what we ordered. Ronnie was there and told me to remove your name. -What? -Are you sure? -Yeah, it was him.
You can tell me. I won't be mad. I fixed the dryer, Claire. And you're going to have your moment of truth. Pull the pin. It's working.
No, he got another one, but it was our turn. He must have been suspicious, because the signal disappeared right after the train left the Beach 98th station. He turned it off right there. Looks like he was headed toward the terminus of the IND Rockaway line. Yeah, that's what it looked like, but the transit cops out there say he wasn't on the train when it pulled into the Rockaway Park station.
What can I say to that? This has been going on for so long, I don't know what to tell you. I'm not proud of it. I just know I can't sleep. I can't stop thinking about our kiss. I'm... I'm... I'm... I admit it was really good.
- What's going on in my mouth? - It's not that bad. - Seriously? - Nasty. - He smells like perfume.
- Bye. - Bye. We'll give these to the squirrels. I've got some bad news. There's a storm over the Chesapeake Bay. We'll have to wait for it to pass.
What? I'm fine. I think you're having trouble with your new job. I love my job. It's great.
I love my job. It's great. - I hate it. I hate it so much. - It's terrible.
He used our equipment to synthesize a virus that is chlorine and UV resistant. Then what doesn't make sense? What the virus does. It's basically a harder to kill serotype 40 adenovirus. It is not lethal.
What the virus does. It's basically a harder to kill serotype 40 adenovirus. It's not lethal. It just gives people a mild gastrointestinal upset. So Raymond Thorpe went to the trouble of tailoring a virus to survive the city's water protections.
Because of diarrhea? In developing countries, diarrhea kills hundreds of thousands of children a year. But this is not a developing country. Compared to England, America is a pimply teenager. Yes, had Thorpe's plan worked, it would have caused some unrest, but given the ease with which he could have stolen or synthesized a far more deadly virus, it's hard to imagine that his agenda was political.
- I know. It goes on endlessly. I don't even answer most of them anymore. That's why the Whole Foods phrase is important. - It stands out.
I'm going home. Yeah, me too. This weed vaporizer is awesome. - Yeah, right? - Yeah, it is. - And the way it glows...
Looks like mountain lion. - Seriously? How old is the carcass? - A day. Damn. He'll be back.
- Come on in. Hey, Heather, you got a visitor! It sure smells good in here. Yeah, we're baking apple pie. It'll be ready in an hour, let's chat that long.
Growler? I do not understand. I wanted some for Colt too, but they wouldn't make "dumbass". Hey, the storm's getting stronger. Come in for a drink until it subsides.
Same old Maggie. Do you realize how much fun I had last night? I can imagine. Yeah, the sex was fine. I'm sorry, it was great.
Not every sword stroke is deadly! One must prepare a death blow. Whether man against man or in a shield castle. Everything below the knee is vulnerable. A knuckle kick does not kill. But it opens the door.
They were really good. Cool. How about you? How was your day? Yes. It was pretty normal.
It's great. Okay. It tastes like feet. You're crazy! It's disgusting.
Yes, that's probably a good rule. So, how did it go with Linda? Was the breakup hard? I tried to break up with her but she cooked me this amazing stew. It tasted so good, I couldn't.
Do you feel like it? - Yeah, sure. - Cool. - How's the new job? - It's cool.
Drink it all! One day... you may be king. I hope so with all my heart. And yes, I know the burden. The never-ending agony, like being forever doomed to drag a rock up a mountain, only to watch it roll down again and again.
- Out of the way! Help us with the ladder! Get buckets for Gilbert! No! Where's the fire truck? - It's on its way!
That was one of my all-time favorite animals. You ask yourself, "If one of my favorite creatures disappears, what else disappears?" And that's when I realized that the ocean has a big problem: You don't see it, you don't think about it. And that's a matter of publicity. Our planet is unique in the known universe in that we have an ocean as the source of all life. It dominates everything:
I thought a polyp was an animal not that a coral is an animal that has many polyps. -Does that make sense? -Coral is an animal that has polyps. But the polyp is not an animal? It is part of the animal.
The opening ceremony was the most heartbreaking day... MAY 12, 2016 ...in sports history. -Hi, Bryan. -The report is out. What do you mean by that? Has it been published?
L.A. is probably safer than Mother Russia considering.... -Bryan! -Yeah? That article is incredible. It's really good.
Great. We're almost done. Good session, Sam. I can see your bra. It's purple.
- What was the effect? They told us the world would end in a potential war. - What did we think was going to happen? - World War III. But it wasn't. Misdirection! Don't look where the arrow points, look where it points away from.
Um... 6,000. How many have reached the second stage? You may not accept their offer. Why not? Because no matter what the price is, it's too high.
What's going on? I think the purpose of the attack on Connor was to make sure that this warehouse was completely unguarded on a particular night five years ago. We'll find out why. Is there a reason for that totem pole in your bathroom? It's too big for the closet.
You coming? So, how long have you been sick, Jack? The red lesion behind the right ear is a marker for basal cell carcinoma. Skin cancer. Doesn't look like it's been treated.
Terrell holds his meetings here because it's across the street from where the Shoreline 99s are located. Is it just me, Detective Bell, or do you hear that? Hear what? The sound of evidence being destroyed? It's coming from inside this building.
So when our guide Terrell said he had a way out of there, we all said "yes." This syrup thing was his idea? No, from a friend of his. This guy had all the details worked out. Knew where to get the syrup, how to get the boats, where to take it once it was on land.
What's all this? I'm going over the paperwork from the attack on Connor Brunelle. Why? Jack Brunelle's in prison. We know Frank Trimble attacked his son, but the statute of limitations has run out. It's over. And yet I'm drawn to the case because of the uniquely challenging enemy it represents.
But I hear so often, "Baby Archer, I'm too stupid to dance." You idiot, anyone can dance even if they're dumb. Hey, y'all, this is my new dance It's called The Kupid Shufle Give it a chance
I could do it with you. I broke your curse... the one you gave Regina that started all this. Well, that's just it, Miss Swan... the curse, the dark curse. It, and all the darkness you've ever faced, was born from a single depraved soul... that of the Black Fairy.
Ooh! Maybe a Porsche. You've got to be kidding. A Lamborghini will do. How about I drive the sports car of your choice over your crummy little head until it pops like a pumpkin?
We must free our people! Okay, team, let's show this thing! Form a shield! Let's see how strong this magic cube is. -Did it absorb the laser?
Wait a minute. -Why can I hear you? -It doesn't matter now. We have to fix your lion. We can heal your lion. Connect with his spirit so he can fly.
This is a virus for old people, and I am young. Well, sort of. Secretion virus? A common altean virus that only affects the elderly. It is harmless and usually passes after a few days, but the body then secretes mucous fluids.
The Galra destroyed our ship engines and flew away. According to this, the Galra were here. Lance. They took everything. We've got to get off this planet before it disintegrates.
According to Ulaz's coordinates, we'll arrive there in a few doboshes. Awesome. They could fold space-time, and that's just at the outpost! The space taco. He left us too soon.
It's two black holes and a giant blue star. Doesn't sound any better. True, inside a black hole the temperature is one millionth of a degree above absolute zero. And outside, the temperature reaches hundreds of millions of degrees. That's like heating a burrito in the microwave and it comes out hot on the outside and frozen on the inside, right?
Hello, Coran, I'm on my way to chow down on some planets. There's one! See you soon! As you know from school, the weblum is an enormous creature and important to the functioning of the universe. It feeds on the remains of dead planets.
There's one! See you soon! As you know from school, the weblum is an enormous creature and important to the functioning of the universe. It feeds on and remnants of dead planets. He transforms their quintessence into become then building blocks of new solar systems!
Don't keep hitting the Teludav! Princess. -I wanted to talk to you about something. -What is it? This plan of ours... It's dangerous, you know.
Under the apartments is a kind of car cave. The underside forms the main entrance through which people enter the building. That's why we made this area very colorful. When we design apartments... I ask myself what I would find exciting. This is kind of the manifestation of the idea that an apartment block doesn't have to look like a prefab building. It can also look like a man-made mountain.
There's the elevator, and then here comes an almost flat area, and then.... you just drive off. A project like this can show people... that green technology offers almost utopian possibilities. And our steam ring symbolizes exactly that very clearly. The smokestack no longer represents pollution, but joy. We designed the chimney with realities:united so that it emits steam rings.
With this missile... There were some problems... Number one, it had to somehow be hoisted onto the cart for transport to... Area 51. The interior of the aircraft was... It didn't have any real levers...or flight control systems that we would recognize as such.
Yes. You are the right hand of the future King of England. You are standing next to him, literally, to symbolize that. So yes, you have a place. And it's very important.
No, I don't. I need five minutes for this. - Open or closed? - Everything okay with the commentary? - It's on my desk.
They want to wake up in the America they fell asleep in. Go ahead with Kalabi, see if Underwood has anything to do with it. This is the James S. Brady press room. And underneath it is a swimming pool. It was built for President Franklin Roosevelt, who suffered from polio.
Yes. I understand. Thank you. CYBERCOM has notified Homeland Security... that a truck carrying three cesium-137 irradiation units has disappeared. It was en route from Atlanta to the manufacturer in Baltimore.
Forgave me my sins Oh, what a happy day That's great music. I wouldn't call it that. Do black people call it something else? No, the choir sings so off-key, it could perform in Pisa.
You don't overthink anything. You make me the happiest man in the world. I don't know how to say this without sounding shallow, but I need to take a closer look at that ring. Yeah, sit, sit. It was my grandmother's.
So it really was a trap. Get the spy. I'm ending this battle. Guys, the generator's not going to run much longer. If it fails, we'll be floating in space for all to see.
-That was magic. -That must have been the Komar. Zarkon wanted to develop a device that would extract quintessence from planets. He must have succeeded. If he destroys planets, what happened to the paladins?
Let it pass. There is still a way. We can make my information public. I have a considerable nest egg. It wouldn't last forever, but if we wanted, we could destroy Westmorland and Neolution.
Seawater leads to hallucinations. Don't you know the ballad of the old sailor? Sir, how would I know this ballad? When I knocked out my tooth last month.... It was my tooth! It fell out because of stress, and because I never floss in the back.
Your arsonist was driving a fully restored classic Ford Mustang, 1965 model, '66, '67 or '68. color unknown. How could you possibly know that? Your report says you found a charred trash can inside. You thought it was used to spill gasoline in the office.
That's what happens when the batteries of the iPad and cell phone are empty: People talk to each other. -That was a really nice experience. -A nice experience, aha. This is just the beginning. The power won't come back! -Of course it's coming back!
Is it your birthday? Or was it already? I'm glad we're friends Me too And the rap shall never end It won't
Can I swipe the credit card, or do I need a chip? Yes, the great chip. I love love love. I'm building a bunker here, Titus. But this time it's mine, so it's only fair.
I find it stupid here. Look how easily I open the door. -As if it were nothing! -Who's the gift basket from? It's for you from... Andy Cohen at Bravo!
Thank you. The next number is dedicated to my lax lady Lillian. I'll spend my life with the funky chick, 100 years if she doesn't shoot me in the face tomorrow. Either way, I die first in this song! It's called Move On, Baby, Clamp On, Turkey Dinner?
A little selfishness is okay. Thanks, mom. - Is the price tag still on it? How's the foot? They need to x-ray it, but it appears to be broken.
Emmanuel Chiang and Steven Tucker have the highest total score and advance to the final round. Before we get started, we talk to the finalists. I have no doubt. I will compete and give it my all. Strength is what you can do with your body, not necessarily what it looks like.
My name is Roberto Perez. I want to honor the name of my country and show everyone that Mexicans are great athletes. I have been training Olympic gymnastics for some time. Then I started climbing. I love what this sport gives me, because it is very demanding both physically and mentally.
She's here to make sure I don't hit you too hard in case you lie to me again. You sound confused. I'd love to fill you in, but I don't have an appointment available today, ladies. Next time, make an appointment by phone. Tom Saunders knew about a bombing in Venezuela three years before it happened.
Wish you could see his face when we confront him. Where is he being held? Good to see you, Holmes. Exorcism planned? Is it for you or for me?
She does not play. She's just being open and authentic. Scanning, and then off it goes to Bob. My drum scanner was built by NASA in the 80s. It does something wonderful with grain that other scanners can't do.
-Yes. You can use these spaces to encourage people to eat healthier, especially kids. Although it doesn't sound like they're giving up the hot dog. There's nothing wrong with that. It just needs to not be so central. It needs to be promoted differently.
We put it out a year ago, and it's still available. Not bad. It's great to see it in the store. When we were picking materials, we fell in love with cork. Cork is in abundance. It's incredibly sustainable, and there are no waste products.
I'm still amazed at how this idea could be so well received. That was even before Star Wars. But we must have struck a chord. Even when I'm dead, it's going to be, "She designed the Boston cover." That's my nightmare, and I'm afraid it's going to come true.
-She hugs me. -And she jumps on me. Yeah, and she bites him. I learned Seymour's last name in school. I thought it sounded really weird.
But when I was at CBS Records in the '70s, the women in design were agents or representatives. I wondered, "What are they going to do with me and I with them?" It's hard when you experience it yourself. All of a sudden you realize, "Oh my God, that was sexism!" Suddenly it's there, and it's just like any other ism.
Really a lot of movies... Is it possible that they're all bad? When you have an idea for a movie, it's in your head. It's huge, it's... the whole world, your whole soul. Then you make the movie... And suddenly it's compared to all the other films. And something that was so big becomes... becomes the smallest Russian matryoshka doll.
And he told me this story about a man who was killed in a liquor store robbery, how this man's brother went after the accomplices afterwards, whom he blamed. I don't know anything about that. I believe you, but the problem is that I do know. All of these details come from an incident that took place in 2012. It made the headlines because both the liquor store owner and the surviving robber were charged with murder at the same time.
I'm just causing you problems. Since I left, everything's been going so well for you. Are you pretending nothing's happened? -The kiss was a mistake. -It wasn't, Alba.
-Anything left? Do you like brandy? Because I'm a woman or because you want him? No, I don't like him at all. I had a bad day. The way you look, it was terrible.
And Reiden would have to let my son go. If this new hybrid is the key to solving humanity's sterility problem and can save Isaac, then, Abe, I'll do everything possible to hunt one down. Thank you, Rafiki. This new hybrid is not like the Razorbacks. It is something new.
How did it happen? All I know is that a lady in Admin paid me to get him here. Everything will be fine. Can you tell us about the place you went? It was big... like a cafeteria.
I'm not an idiot. You've been conspiring with Detective Trenchcoat since he arrived. Talk to me. My name... is not... It's...
That's not funny. Okay. That's Jackson Oz. You're not Jackson Oz. No, he's not.
James Bond shakes them off and gets to another neighborhood and arrives at a bus station. He takes a bus in that direction, then a streetcar in the other. The bad guys come around the corner. "There he is!" The movie would be ten minutes long. It ends with James Bond in an alley, gasping.
And, when I'm hungry, I have lentil soup. It's getting harder and harder to pretend. Anyway, Sheldon, we have to make a decision whether to run the xenon stream through the cryocooler or through the vacuum filter. Explain to me the pros and cons of both. So, if we let the xenon current flow through the cryocooler, then it will cool down abruptly before it comes in contact with the conduit.
You can literally feel the time saved. Ah, here I am again, available for 8 minutes. Sheldon, this is stupid. You can't expect us to accomplish anything meaningful when you're popping in and out of here all the time like you just did. The coefficient is not lambda, it's one through lambda.
She was just kidding! Wait, wait! Where's my backpack? My phone, my wallet is in my backpack. It's right here.
My notepad is gone. Oh, no! Okay, it's just a notepad, that's not bad, right? It's not a big deal? It's full of classified information about our Air Force project!
What are you saying, Atsuji? Run! Get into the carriage. Hurry! Isn't it broken?
SET FROM RISE IN SIDI HAKIM He went to the desert and made a very entertaining, swashbuckling adventure film. The film inspired Raiders of the Lost Ark and a hundred other films. But it is the exact opposite of Paths of Glory. War looks like fun in it. Stevens later said of the film, "It celebrates the thundering of drums and the waving of flags.
Thousands and thousands of Italian and German troops lay down their arms and surrender. The battle for North Africa, which cost the Axis powers 400,000 dead, wounded and captured, is over. The victory is won. Now the Allied victors look eagerly across the Mediterranean to the shores of Hitler's Fortress Europe. As Frank Capra continued to work on the Why We Fight film series, he became increasingly ambitious. Capra's first installment was immediately well received by the recruits for whom it was intended.
He now worked closely with director Anatole Litvak on the fifth and largest film in the series Why We Fight: The Battle of Russia. While Capra and Litvak were making the film, the Red Army began to push back the Nazis at Stalingrad, in one of the most costly battles of the war. For the first time since the strong Wehrmacht began its successful blitzkriegs, subduing one European country after another, this German army faced a country that did not submit. It was intended as a training film, but The Battle of Russia was so acclaimed that Capra was allowed to release it in theaters.
Then there were only Colonels left. One by one, they left the room until I was the only one left. I thought, "What assholes." The Army didn't like the movie at all. They thought it would demoralize the soldiers. Men who had never seen combat.
His work was as much about hearing as it was about seeing. It was about the performances and all the beautiful words that the actors rendered under Wyler's direction. Wyler went back to Hollywood, but he considered his career as a director over. After the liberation of Paris, Stevens and others, too, thought that the war was coming to an end. But in reality, it was nowhere near over.
I made films for over 40 years. There was one among them that was particularly close to me because it was shot right after the war. Most of my films are fictional, they tell fictional stories, and they didn't really involve me. But because I served in the military during the war, I made the film The Best Years of Our Lives right after the war. The film really satisfied me because it contributed something to social life at that time.
You can't go to work right away. You should get some rest. Why don't you take a vacation? I have to earn money. Last year I was killing Japs, this year I'm making money. When they come home, they continue to fight an inner war. And this inner war haunts them. It haunts them when they are sleeping and when they are awake.
You should get some rest. Why don't you take a vacation? I gotta make money. Last year I was killing Japs, this year I'm making money. When they come home, they continue to fight an inner war. And this inner war haunts them. It haunts them in their sleep and when they are awake. It overshadows their decisions and their reactions to conflict in the reality of the postwar period.
Yes, or forget some of them. I watch this movie at least once a year. Not a year has gone by in the last 30 years that I haven't watched it. I try to get people to watch it so I can relive it through their eyes. Wyler's film was hailed as a masterpiece of American social realism. It got great reviews and became the second highest-grossing film of all time.
In the last 30 years, not a year has gone by that I haven't watched it. I try to get people to watch it so that I can experience it anew through their eyes. Wyler's film was hailed as a masterpiece of American social realism. It got great reviews and became the second highest-grossing film of all time. I believe a film should have something to say. And I think that's called a message. It should make people think and feel. If possible, long after they have left the cinema.
Hardly half, if we work according to the order. - Half. This could be our biggest hit. Your movie. But if it stays like this, it'll go down.
Do you know a woman named Anna St. Blair? No, I don't know her. Do you drive a white van? It used to be white. Now it's more of a rust color.
No, I don't know them. Do you drive a white van? It used to be white. Now it's more of a rust color. - It's registered in Jersey?
Do you drive a white van? It used to be white. Now it's more of a rust color. - It's registered in Jersey? - Yes, it is. - Is it in your garage?
God. I didn't mean to do it. Spit out the key! I'm trying. How disgusting! He's downstairs.
Spit out the key! I'm trying. How disgusting! He's down. - He's downstairs.
Don't you need to breathe here? You must meet Landon Aames. The novelist? He's a screenwriter now. I put him on our movie. To give it more depth.
This is Dave. He earns his money with dirty jokes. Most of his hard work is accompanied by this look. It illustrates a profound train of thought, the alchemist's fire that turns fear and tragedy into ease and sustenance.
- If I may, Mr. Brimmer. We pay our writers well. Better than any other studio. Isn't that right? Isn't it? A strike wouldn't cost you a cent, but it would hurt your careers. And the studio.
For Minna, I bought the biggest diamond they had at Brock's. She needed something flashy. More than Milton Sternberg could give her. I was going to do the same for you, but.... This ring is... - Monroe. It's beautiful.
She needed something striking. More than Milton Sternberg could give her. I was going to do the same for you, but.... This ring is... - Monroe. It's beautiful. It's more like me.
He has points, is biting. This character strikes me as a female version of Nietzsche's "Übermensch". The answer to nihilism. Exactly. This film is important to us. We think it has a very important message. For the whole world.
Daddy, I know what's missing from our movie. - What movie? The only movie. "An Enemy Is Among Us." It's too prudish, too puritanical.
You are the institute. No, not anymore. I don't know... I came here from New York because I wanted to escape from... the noise... the whole scene. But now the noise... It's not out here, it's...
It sounds funny when I say that, because as a cam model I get paid for my time. I am totally happy. I have my passport, I'm ready to go. I need some Australian stamps. It's still so empty.
"It can't be that hard." But the competition is tough, you have to be very good. So here you have your button for the subwoofer. And your lighting. Does it explode when I turn it up?
I'll punch the butterfly in the nose. Stop it! Look at him. He's gonna land on my head. Where'd he go?
Hopefully no more squats! I enjoy it. I like the feeling of accomplishment when I see what I've earned. I'm getting my breath back. My camroom is going well, but I want it to go better.
Better. I found annual reports from when Fred Kirby was on the NYOOPI board. Why were you looking for them? Because I'm hoping to find evidence of embezzlement or fraud. Let's see how many people pay for that ridiculous silver star when it becomes a sign of corruption.
"This is Pat's movie." That pisses me off! - I just wanted to give you credit for... Your little writers' strike cost us. Embarrassing for the whole studio. - It wasn't "little" and it wasn't a "number."
She just left the hospital. She just... left. As a grown woman, she has the right to do that. You want to hear about my day? It was eventful.
It's easier for me to believe that everything you say is a lie. Remember your accent. It was his mother's. - How romantic! It was his mother's.
It will always be. It wasn't very important before, but now it is very important. - I like this sugar. - It looks very nice. - Yes, it forms little lumps.
- Yes, it forms small lumps. - It's shiny. I liked it. When I went to the river or to the beach.... When it reaches the beach, it deposits deeply.
BUT PERHAPS NOT EVERYTHING IS A GAME. Diogo's death was a trigger for that. It's bad to say that death is a trigger. But what does death give us? For Diogo, it means everything.
Diogo's death was a trigger for that. It is bad to say that death is a trigger. But what does death give us? For Diogo, it means everything. For Diogo, it meant everything.
It is bad to say that death is a trigger. But what does death give us? For Diogo, it means everything. For Diogo, it meant everything. He is a self-fulfilling subject.
- DO HOUSES FLY? - I HAD TO LEARN, LOLA... A flying bird has no greater sense for us. But for the bird it is the whole sense. It is looking for something.
A flying bird has no greater sense for us. But for the bird, that is the whole meaning. It is looking for something. It is not just flying and hovering. No, it has a goal.
Nobody knows that. I'm starting to think that I'm there by mistake. They wanted someone else there, but then had to invite me. I think the craziest things. I freeze. The sentence doesn't go on, it stops.
IT IS TURNING NOW. IT CONTINUES TO TURN. OH GOD, NOW I'M SURROUNDED. Rafa, did I leave the monitor? Is it there?
- Very helpful. That's all right. - Let's approach this scientifically. What did we see? Jordan: a very nice, cool, real and alive human being. Also, I touched her arm and it didn't fall off.
Leaves, twigs, muddy tires. Unquestionably, this car had driven through a swampy area. The car had driven through swampy, muddy terrain. And why was the car found here, with its rear end on the road, next to the apartment complex where the nun lived? CATHY'S CAR / CATHY'S PARKING PLACE CATHY'S APARTMENT Whoever had parked the car there wanted it to be found.
I must have been the last one to see her. This is the parking lot where they found her car. We all met here and called the state police. They responded pretty quickly, cordoned off the area and told us, "Don't go there, don't touch anything." The car was standing there as we are standing here now, it was unlocked and the ignition key was in it.
I mean... I just forgot about it. Debbie's aunt gave us the necklace, told us to keep it. I looked at the stone and... As you can see, it's light green. That corresponds to the August birthstone.
But also to say I'd like my letter back. I understand it's evidence, and if I can't even touch it, could we...? Could I just look at it? Read it? You said it couldn't be found. It existed.
Read him? They said you could not find him. He existed. He existed, without a doubt. He was handed over to the police without a doubt.
There is no doubt that he was handed over to the police. There is no doubt that the police have him. Marilyn Cesnik, Cathy's sister, said she received a letter after Cathy disappeared. Yes. Could it have contained a reference to the engagement gift?
Yes, I know about the letter. I heard about the letter that her sister received afterwards. But as far as I know, the letter is no longer part of the evidence. The City Police would have had it, and we never got to see it. ROBIN TEALS VOICE COUNTY POLICE BALTIMORE Robin, so you're saying that you know that he didn't....
I heard about the letter that her sister received afterwards. But as far as I know, the letter is no longer part of the evidence. The City Police would have had it, and we never got to see it. ROBIN TEALS VOICE COUNTY POLICE BALTIMORE Robin, so you're saying that you know he's not.... You know at least now that he wasn't evidence?
I knew it would bring laughs, "She's obsessed with squirrels, and she infected me." But you go on with the main joke. It's a throwaway joke. He makes it cool.
They do a few of those. Then they come and do close-ups where you only see three figures. When they leave the scene, we see the room as we saw it. But in truth, the rest of the room is not there when they shoot. It's full of reflectors, cameras, lights, and all that other shit.
My father knows no boundaries. I don't know if he had skimmed the book. It was Tasteless Jokes, volumes one and two. I remember the first joke on the first page. It was a paragraph long, but I can tell it briefly.
At first I wanted to shit on it, but then I stayed. He looked down my throat and said, "We need to go to the ER." I had some kind of abscess... on the trachea, which you need to breathe. If this abscess grew 1 mm, I wouldn't be able to breathe and I would die. Or it could explode. It was full of poison that could kill me.
Don't worry, we'll keep an eye on him. That was your nostril. Show me Raven again. Look at his tail. It's braided.
Don't be mad because the horse squad caught you. Becky, you were going to catch the ghost horse, but instead you caught a horse thief. How silly of me. You can't catch a ghost with a net. - He flies through it.
Do you remember that? That's really private. No, I don't. I don't remember. It was probably from the store.
Perfect. - You can't do that. - Is he reserved? I'm morally obligated to stop misconceptions of love that romantic Hollywood comedies spread. And he is almost like urban neurotic.
-No more. Maybe it's time to pick out your own clothes. But how? There are so many clothes and different colors and patterns and sizes. This shirt is "fog gray," but fog is not a color at all, it's see-through.
-Take it easy. We'll kill him. Chapter eight, photosynthesis. Who's looking forward to that? You all read this at home yesterday and.... When a lobster gets too big for its shell, it dumps it.
Is Mr. Bojangles here? - Hey, George. - Hello, former President Reagan. You know, George, chopping wood is an art. You hit the log right, it splinters like dry bone.
- No, Neil. Don't you get it? - What? My dick has two left hands. He can't walk and talk at the same time!
Because the spirit does not pay the rent! And does not give you food or clothing. It does not save you from the feeling of being lost or unloved. The ghost of Camp Firewood is a nice idea, but it's not real. And it never was.
And does not provide you with food or clothing. It does not save you from the feeling of being lost or unloved. The ghost of Camp Firewood is a nice idea, but not real. And it never was. And it never will be.
The totem pole! The ghost of Camp Firewood! It exists! That's what I've been trying to tell you. He feeds on our love.
No, he isn't. He's a vampire, and he hasn't been waiting down here for centuries. I don't like your tone, Belmont. This place is old, but it's not abandoned. It's alive and well.
Do you have a history? I just don't like him. I was disgusted by his debut novel. Really? If you say so, he must have been terrible.
I don't mean to be rude, but none of you could write a novel like that. What do you think? Will we meet again after reading this novel? If you insist so much, Mr. Chiba. But even if this is a novel that none of us could write, if it's not interesting, it won't win the prize.
THE CURSED HOUSE! THE OWNER IS THE SON OF THE MURDERER TATSUYUKI MICHIMA THE CURSED HOUSE! The currently very popular novel Deviant Emotions, written by author Shin Michima, who lived with Nanaka, is expected to sell over a million copies. It was awarded the Literature Prize of Japan.
Did the crew abandon ship? Unclear. But they didn't come without the spacesuits.... There's someone in there! Thanks to King Alfor, we found the second meteorite. We recovered it, but it's causing serious interference.
If Voltron is stuck there, we get rid of him. If he comes back with the meteorite, we get him. For us, either way is a win. This is the meteorite Trayling was talking about. It's stuck between realities. Like the ship.
What is different? The Hoktril. The greatest technical achievement of our civilization. What does it do? It drains our enemies of their fighting power.
But first, let's find Lotor, shall we? Let's fire this thing up and see if it works. Maybe the polarity is off. Guys. I've got the comet, but it's moving.
Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Shiro. We need the comet. We need to get it safely to base. It's vulnerable to attack in transit.
You just escaped from a Galra ship. And now you want to break into one? You're crazier than I am. And I'm living on an ice planet by choice. Is it possible or not? The cruiser is in range, but it's about to jump into hyperdrive.
Even before all this. That he is dead, or that we must return? Both. It was also a dream that brought us here. And it turned out to be true.
We are not prepared. We'll be fine. That's not all I'm worried about. I'm not ready yet. This road he's supposed to go down. I don't know where it leads. Only that his enemies are waiting for him there.
Thank you. This bird is no good. I tell you, it's no good. The priest will not accept it. He is unclean.
- Huh? Do you want it? - Yes. That's not enough. But he's no good. - He can fly.
Control by giving up control? That doesn't make sense. Not everything makes sense. It doesn't have to. Your intellect has taken you far in life, but it will not take you any further.
From what? From beings from other dimensions that threaten our universe. Like Dormammu. How do you know that name? It was in the book of Cagliostro. Why?
Strange! Everything okay? A relative term, but yes. The hovering cloak. He has chosen you.
A relative term, but yes. The floating mantle. He has chosen you. Quite remarkable. He is very flighty.
Come on, let's go! - Hurry up! - It's the express train! And it's not stopping! It's coming!
Room full of nightmares. I'm not going in there. I don't understand how I get into these situations. I had a good job at the MTA. Was it perfect?
Here are your pancakes! I'm not ready to be alone yet. Not at all. I can't reset my router. I don't even know where it is, I don't even know what it's for.
You look great. - Are you ready, ma'am? - Yes, thank you. - How was the swordfish? - It was good.
- Please call me Roberto. I like to address a gentleman by his first name. Come. I love this park. It's my playground.
The headpiece like this. - Sure? - I don't know. Kathy, I love your engagement ring. It means so much to me.
- Sure? - I don't know. Kathy, I love your engagement ring. It means so much to me. It's been in Bob's family for over 100 years.
I had a Liam Neeson nightmare. I dreamt that I kidnapped his daughter and he chased me. They made three movies. At some point you wonder if he's just a bad father. The worst thing about cancer is not what it does to you, but to those you love.
Your stress level has been raised to the point that you've mutated. You sadistic son of a bitch! I cured you, Wade. Your mutated cells are healing everything now. Your cancer will be destroyed faster than it is created.
- Max7 Sofia. What happened to you yesterday? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm really sorry I walked out on you. My head... felt like it was going to explode.
Is there anything being built out there in the woods? You're getting right to the point. Please, help me understand what's going on. This place has seen better days. But it's been decaying for decades.
Please, help me understand what is going on here. This place has seen better times. But for decades it has been decaying. On and on. Withering away like the skin on my bones.
Jules, I've seen the video, and once is enough for me. Please, watch it again. So, what did you find this time? - The blood was already on the walls. The room, it... Something's not right.
It was the second largest penis search in the country. The man is Korean, it took forever. That's prejudice. There are Korean dicks bigger than you. Okay. When it was found, they gave it to me. And said, "Take this dick where it needs to go."
You are not a complete idiot. You're not Robbie Wheirdicht. You're Bob Stone. I made up the name. - It's not real.
It is about an intergalactic war. That affects the whole universe. What about it? It's about an enemy. He must be destroyed before he reaches us.
-I mean, for your life. -Did you have a plan? -Yes, of course. And what was it? It didn't quite work out.
- I got you! Hold on! - I can't hold on! My little glove! It's slipping!
That doesn't sound real to me. If it were already real, I wouldn't have to make it up. I'm sorry, what did you say your name was? - Tracey Hughes. And in case you forget, it's on all of Zenotek's patents.
That's enough. You are now doing exactly what we want. You've got ten times as much on your head. We can't open the vault. It has a time lock.
Dale, the boat is leaving! My crane is falling on the derrick. -It's falling over! -Get in the boat! I'll stop him or he'll kill us all.
- Come here! Hey! Where the hell are you going? Just down the path. I see where it leads.
Listen to me. It's not safe. Stay away. Grandpa, did you take your medication? The key to the gun cabinet was in the drawer. Now it's gone.
I know the story. Besides, I knew you when you were a little kid, Kolya. Your father and I went hunting with you. You were 12 or 13 years old. You were so excited and wanted so badly to kill something. Then there was a deer. You picked up the rifle, but the deer just looked at you. He just kept grazing. He wasn't afraid.
We got the Beretta deal. Are you kidding me? I swear to God. The Beretta deal was huge. It was 10 times what we had done before.
I've thought about it for a long time. And I don't want you to end up with nothing. Cool. I've asked Warren to draft a severance agreement. And I think it's fair.
Once they reach the capital, nothing in the world can stop them. It takes two days to reach the capital at full gallop. We can't catch up with them. The wind is strong now. It will blow from the north tomorrow.
We need it to kill the queen. Once she is dead, the Tao Tei no longer function. Without their signal, their entire army freezes. - There's an underground channel. - Has it been breached?
- Has it been breached? - The Tao Tei should be over it. - And the prisoner? We load him and we feed him. - Then he returns to the queen.
He says you will survive. We'll get him later. They've broken through! Patience, William. And he'll go to the queen when he's done?
Geran, your work and the risks you take give you the right to at least half of our profits. But your person, compared to me, forces me to refuse, to reject what you demand. It is very much a question of character, finesse, values, virtue, which are totally unknown to you. Feel comfortable in your sphere of life, Geran. It suits you very well.
I want to understand. Fine. Algorithms give rules that are never broken. This algorithm is designed to move hundreds of positions back and forth in a fraction of a second. It is not designed to waste huge amounts of capital, provide leverage, or maintain a portfolio for long periods of time.
I just did my job. I'll keep at it as long as the director asks me to. What is your name? My name is Lenny Libatino. It's spelled L-E-N-N-Y, not with an I-E.
No! No, don't. Did Oogway teach you that trick? Pity. It only works on mortals.
Digger gets your cut. (SIGHS) Listen, Mr. Pescatore, I think this is a fantastic idea. Digger comes down here, he takes over, we're going to control Florida, and we're going to take over Cuba. But my share stays where it is size-wise.
- Not far from here. On the Dorian River, on the northwest side of the Sacred Place is a secret forest. Supposedly, they hide all their treasures there. Gold, silver, jewels, as far as the eye can see. When the mirror shines, it will be there.
You do have a plan? Yes. Is it any good? No. But it's simple.
Stay in my shadow. Why? - Just do as I say. Praise be to you, great God Ra. Otherwise, if a bird lands on my ship, I'll kill it before it can shit.
Your other eye. I could steal it back for you. Do not test my patience, mortal. My name is not "mortal." What is it then?
Father... I have seen the tower. Impressive. I built it for you. If it were any taller, it would be in my way.
Please. You want another magic trick? No. Yes! It's called "The Incredible... disappearing...
If you let these people down, you let yourself down more than you let them or me down. Remember what you said when the Yankees tried to beat me to death? I remember. When they asked me why I was saving rebels like you, I said the war was over. But it isn't.
- Too bad. - I've been wearing the other one for two weeks. It's okay, cheapskate, you have so many suits. And you're wearing my Florentine silk suit? Yes. It was too big. I had to shorten the sleeves with the sword.
- I didn't mean anything wrong. If you wish, I will put on my old pants again. That's how the two martyrs came to me. He'll make a good article out of it. Sure. It'll be published tomorrow morning.
He thinks spastes react to aftershave. How does that work exactly? Do they think, "Oh no. The smell. I don't understand where it's coming from."
Hold on. Do you want to just shit in the chair? Maybe. Ben. Ben, he's not stopping.
- What is your last name? - Anger. I know. Everybody thinks it's funny. In German, it means "anger."
That was mainly due to the director. He was great and made it easy. The producers said, "You should be able to make a good low-budget movie with them." "It just has to be in theaters by July."
So you can compare them in terms of creative power. Welcome back to "Hullabaloo." Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Richard Lester. What can you say about the new Beatles film? Unlike the last film, it will be in color.
Welcome back to "Hullabaloo." Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Richard Lester. What can you say about the new Beatles film? Unlike the last film, it will be in color. It has a gripping and entertaining plot.
Let's get you out of here. Mom? Yes? Why is my name Hannah? Your name is very special because it's a palindrome.
Freeze! Hands up! Listen up, everyone. An official stamp of the Censorship Bureau has been stolen. All shipments of goods are suspended until it is recovered.
But I dare say you learn something from it. The first hat from my hand. I thought him in the garbage for a long time. He kept it. It is impossible that it should be here, and yet... it's here.
God. You're a real whiz at biology. Are you afraid of a dead frog? Come on! Oh, God, it looks like he's gonna puke out of his throat.
See you soon. Bye. - Hey, Evan. Tell your dad his pliers are in the mailbox. - He's not my dad, but okay.
The law that compels us to deliver the slave to his owner we shall never obey. "Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by virtue of my office, by authority of the Constitution and laws, having thought to convene, do hereby convene... the Citizen Militia of several States of the Union, to the total number of 75,000, to prevent said unions, and to see that laws are observed." (James) This war is a terrible tragedy for our nation. (Joseph) It is.
What's wrong with you? This is a celebration. A celebration of your faith, not mine. That's the advantage of wine. It makes no difference.
I stayed there because I knew that as long as I lived, Mu Bai would not ask for your hand. Not even after your death. That's how honorable he was. You faked your death in vain. I didn't fake it.
Just wanted to say I know where to buy a bridge. I'll tell you this. I don't care if it was the devil. I don't care if the loan was from the devil. - It had to come from somebody.
But your name he has. One morning Saint Peter looked into his book. He underlined names for the Last Day and let me see your name. He had it under "M." Rose's name he has too. I didn't see it like yours, but I know it's in there.
Rose, it's just... You don't have to say anything more. And don't explain anything. The guy who gave me this quarter had a lot of them. I'm going to keep this quarter until it stops shining.
The pathology report? Yes, it said that I tested positive for breast cancer. And you just send something like that in an e-mail, are you serious? No, I have your pathology report... ...right here in front of me. It's negative.
11 o'clock, thank you very much. Okay, now let's check your dating app. He believes it. If you go in, you'll set off his alarm. I can mute it, but he'll get a signal.
Again on my pelvis... - Tell me everything. - Okay. So. right off the bat, Bryce ordered a Nice Salad, but asked that the tuna be well done. However, when the tuna is exquisite, you don't really want it to be....
And Fugu, for the lady. - Thank you, Ping. - Fugu? The infamous blowfish. If not properly prepared, it can cause paralysis or even death.
I know a bit about it. That's really cool. You're welcome to touch the feathers. A lot of people don't know that was a demon. His name is... Pronounced Quetzalcoatl.
It's all the rage again. I'm not talking about hipster real estate trends. I'm talking about retaliation, tattoo! Death is coming to Brooklyn. And he's got buck teeth and a fluffy tail.
What does this song say? They come from the north. High up in the mountains, where hardly anyone has ever been. But sometimes a dragon gets separated from his family... and gets stranded far from home. They say he lives in these woods.
Only me. You saw a dragon? You could say that. You can say that again. What did it look like?
You saw a dragon? You could say that. You could say that. What did it look like? It was green.
All green. Except for his eyes. His eyes were red. Red like fire. Before I could blink, he rears up, opens his massive mouth.... and out shoots
We need a helicopter, the dragon can fly. A dragon? Jack, you brought me here for a dragon? I can't explain it, but it's true. He was here.
A dragon? Jack, you brought me here for a dragon? I can't explain it, but it's true. It was here. It's still in there.
No one has seen the dragon again. And I never spoke of him again. I didn't have to. Not after that day. People searched everywhere, but he was nowhere to be found.
END I think he had a heart attack. - We're writing a song. - We're writing a song. - It's called "Boat." - "Boat."
It's Umbris. Well, at least it's an uninhabited planet. Yes. But also a highly unstable planet. Its core is pure melluvium. If it is blown up, it will cause a chain reaction that will destroy the entire solar system.
I'm coming from patrol. - Copy that. Open shield sector 24 A. (Elaris) Once inside, Ratchet and Clank work their way through the starburst chamber to the power core. Ratchet uncovers the stabilizer, then he can easily uncouple it.
Then, when I am clean, I will face the law. Take me. Tie me to the bed. Okay. Honey, put the bat down. If it breaks, I'll have to pay for it.
Because I would like to have one or two wan tan. I'm allowed to say that. Where are we going? First, you must go to the north corridor. It leads to the other wing.
Get out, slim! Speed! Turn around! You know whose truck this is? Yes, it's mine.
Get to the ship. Superman's probably already there. Perry. It's not about a story. Jenny, get a chopper to Gotham. Forget the heliport, have him land on the roof.
If you had some left. I still have one. The spear. Alfred, the spear is pure Kryptonite. It's in Gotham.
Yes, Dutchman changed it. What did he change, Jerico? - He changed... Jerico, what did he change? - Heimdahl's first shot. Whatever he aims at, whatever he launches at, it comes back to him.
But most of all, beware of the cuckoo bird. Do you know how the cuckoo survives? By taking advantage of its mother's weakness. The cuckoo is too smart to raise its own young. Instead, it smuggles its eggs into the nests of dumber birds.
That's what they told me about you, Mr. Bouchard. So, tell me: - What do you think he will do? - What are you going to do? I had procured the pointer, now it's disappeared.
Sienna. There are too many of us down here. They'll never get to the bag before we do. No. But I can make sure it's destroyed.
Your mother told me what's going on, and I'm here to help if I can. Do you want to talk about it? You know, when I was your age, I went to visit my mom in the hospital and I saw an angel. Yes. He was standing right by a little boy's bed.
Do you want to talk about it? You know, when I was your age, I visited my mother in the hospital and saw an angel. Yes. He was standing right by a little boy's bed. He gently stroked his cheek, then suddenly stopped and looked over at me.
You know, when I was your age, I visited my mother in the hospital and saw an angel. Yes. He was standing right by a little boy's bed. He gently stroked his cheek, then suddenly stopped and looked over at me. Of course my mother and the nurses didn't believe me, but I knew he was real.
"I was there at your first breath, "you didn't ask me to, "but I'll follow you to your death." A name. You did not ask for it, it is given to you.
You're out at 7, right? Because that's when the first employees come. Yes. Which truck here is the best? It's supposed to be my 16th birthday present.
I missed you too. You are a family. He was looking for his parents. I got the truck. It stopped.
Please, Tribune. Carefully. Come, Clavius, wash the day away. Fill his cup. Keep it filled.
I don't want to be in your shoes. Spare me. It is your way too. Your ambition is noticed. Where do you hope it will lead?
You don't say. No, she never touched you. Oh, really? Dude, that wonderful little beauty mark on her vagina. It's on the right...
Go! - Eddie! Get him back inside! Eddie! - Eddie! Matt, pop the trunk now! - The light says it's open!
It was just a dream. No, it felt real. I know. Your mind is as powerful as I've ever seen it. He can convince himself...
Give me the key! All right. I'll let her out, okay? Let me get the key. - Where is it?
To stop an asteroid? The last 2 asteroids hit in the same place. And it's happening again. We need to go and see what is attracting the asteroid. If we know why it's coming, we can redirect it somehow.
If we know why he's coming, we can redirect him somehow. This plan is so stupid, I want to slap him. Let me get this straight. Instead of running from the asteroid, we're supposed to head straight for it? I know that sounds suboptimal, but the good thing is that he's going to kill us either way.
- That's him, Miss Crawly. Same for you. - I made you some coffee. You did? Where is he?
Check with MI-6 to see if micro forensics can bring this forward. The team needs to be here in 2 hours or it's no good. I'm very sorry. In my culture... death is not the end. It's more of a transition point.
Thank you, sir. "Consequences"? Secretary of State Ross wants you indicted. I can't get the shield back, can I? Actually, it belongs to the government.
It took the world 70 years to find Barnes... then surely you can do it in half that time. You know where they are. I know someone who does. Not sure you understand the principle of a getaway car. It's inconspicuous.
You did everything just for her. So that you would be loved. And yet it was... never enough. Maybe the gods were meant to find you. Maybe the ocean brought you to them because it saw that you were worth saving.
You come with me on my boat, sail across the sea.... I don't want to die, so you can prove yourself. ...and bring back the heart of Te Fiti. The ocean chose me. It was wrong. Why did you bring me here.
This wanderlust has brought us here Always wanted to go further I've already learned so much but I feel the longing But the sound it doesn't come across the sea It's inside me
It's okay. Use your shoe next time. I love this song. - Is that a Thai song? It's beautiful.
Today was like a parachute jump for me. Or like sex. Kim. Tanya's got scotch. He'll be gone soon, so...
Don't fucking hide. Kim, you know about the frog in the pot of water? You raise the temperature in small increments and the frog doesn't notice? That's what this place and this job does to all of us. It changes your perception from what's normal to this.
What are you still standing there for? Well then... - Yeah, this could get purulent. - I'm sorry, what? The wound. We should give him antibiotics.
But somehow we were happy there in the forest. Nobody could find us. Everyone thought we were dead. If you were to run away today, here and now, where would you go? I read that when a train catches you, that it tears your clothes off.
My name is Sophie. Come on, jump, Sophie. This is where I catch all my dreams and mix them. Oh, boy! (Ratze/BFG) When, when a dream whizzes by, it's all silvery soft.... And makes a little clunky sumse humse sound. Like music.
(Sophie) Now it's on your elbow! No, not on the elbow, the other! Now on your foot! The other foot! Now he sits full on your butt!
One of the nightmares. What are you going to do with it? I'll spear him away, the nasty beastie here. What did the bad dream say? He says:
What is Sophie's dream? A golden magic hisser. I don't see those so much anymore. A... but what happens in it? He tells the story of a little child.
But in the end... there remain the beautiful memories. And, Sophie, I... I know... this story is your heart's desire. I do. The dream came to you, didn't I right? It remains Sophie's dream.
OK. What's the plan? Over. We have a convoy under fire from a group of guerrillas at the border. If all goes well, it should reach your current location in 52 hours, Sergeant.
I never want to hear her name again. Cassius, I share your outrage. What has gotten into you? If we do not act... the war will soon be upon us. And that's exactly where it's going to stay.
They protect you so that you can be a leader someday. Your mother gave you a gift. Nice of you, but jewelry means nothing to me. The ring is not the gift. It contains the gift:
Are we supposed to cower behind these walls... - until he picks us off one by one? - No backhanded comments. This order has lasted 15 centuries. - It will survive another 15.
Now the question is: someone builds a safe in a grocery store, right? - And we found it. - That's right. And we think it's full of money or drugs or whatever.
Guddu! Mom, I love you very much. Guddu, I miss you so much. The train on track 2 is being discarded. It does not carry passengers.
If we decide Hawaii would be better for you, I'll go with you. Janine, how did the conversation with the White House go? I made it clear that we had a real FISA warrant. They wanted to see it, which we refused. Now I'm praying that it's real.
But that's a blanket statement. What are you going to do now? Nothing. I think when people say they hate jazz.... They don't relate to it, they don't know where it comes from.
The jazz I know? - What about it? - I don't know anything else. I find it relaxing. But it isn't.
I like talking to you. You're in a lot more trouble than I thought. (Is this seat taken? No, it's not.
- I'm not burning it. Luckily, the sheriff's dog was a patient of mine. Otherwise Travis would have ended up in jail. But we were never able to pull the truck out of the swamp. It's still in the Bullfrog Motel today!
Leave it alone. - Why don't you watch my movie? - Bye. Go ahead and watch it. - Have a good night. - It's still on.
Thank you. I liked it too. Why did you throw cold coffee on me? I found it in the hallway. I thought it was hot.
- Small, stringy hair. - They went that way. Chet? Hey, Chet. Amelia's movie. Where is he?
Repeat, in the projector. That's where we looked. Glued it in. What? It was pasted into the other film.
Jesus. Hello? Hello? It's me. I have a new car. Do you like it?
- It was Adams, of course. - Yes, Adams. Murderous jealousy. He had written a paper for the Royal Astronomical Society on the obliquity of the ecliptic. And then he had read an even better one.
Just a little crispy. Why don't you sit down? That's what people are after all: dust that still has to be spread. And it's everywhere, isn't it?
Always here. Always together. You have a great mind, Moriarty. I admire it. I admit he may be my equal.
No way! I'm not doing this anymore, ever! - Why don't you fucking do it? Is your body that valuable? Does it wear out when you fuck, princess?
Where does the sun rise? Where does it set? To where does its light fall? I want to see all that! A bird should not leave the nest until it can fly, Sarman.
Oh, excuse me. Hello? You got a letter. - You have mail. Put it on video! It's from the theater school.
Because of my four friends. They are green ninjas. Give us the slime. Hi. Where'd he go?
We are on our way. We have to get through the exit! Are you crazy? We can't be seen! The slime is our only chance to be normal and it's on its way to the entrance.
The night Naz was arrested, he lost a lot. He lost the freedom to go home to his family, to his school, to his night job that helps pay for school. But what he has not lost, and what none of us can lose, is his constitutional rights to an attorney, to a fair and impartial trial by you, his fellow citizens, and to have his innocence presumed beyond a reasonable doubt. We hear this expression quite often. But what exactly does it mean?
But what he has not lost, and what none of us can lose, are his constitutional rights to counsel, to a fair and impartial trial by you, his fellow citizens, and to have his innocence presumed beyond a reasonable doubt. We hear this expression quite often. But what exactly does it mean? What is its definition? It doesn't have one.
- Thank you. How's the pop music award going? Good. I called the producers and am waiting for a call back. Please hold, you know how important it is to him.
Come on. You know that. - God. - Can we talk about this helmet? It's really heavy. It really hurts my back.
Hands up. Any weapons on board? No. What's the problem, bosmang? Show us your transponder. It indicates it's expired.
- Because of a hat? - Yes! You only do that when there is danger or when a person is seriously ill. A hat is not a person. And it is not a danger.
She has depression. Pregnant again? - She had an abortion. Take off that stupid hat! Whose is it anyway?
The hat is devilish. - Diabolical? - Yes. Not at all. This hat is lucky. It has saved lives.
- Devilish? - Yes. Not at all. This hat is good luck. It has saved lives. Do you know whose it is?
Mitt'rrand. - Quite possible. - Mitt'rrand, that wretched person! Mitt'rrand is the devil! Please pronounce his name correctly. His name is Mitterrand.
Yes? You must have noticed the initials? Yes. So I'm guessing right, this is not your hat? I think you know who it belongs to.
Sit down. - There's a reward. - No, I don't want one. Since you don't want a reward, I'll trust you with something. I lost this hat in Lyon. It must have seen a lot of action.
I've been waiting for this the whole time. No, no, you tell me first, Isabel! No, no! You tell me first! You make such a face. Where's your ring? It keeps coming off.
I love you. I love you. I miss you so much. I love you too, my everything. And I miss you here so much. I miss you too, my darling. And especially your kisses! You know, I told you, the ring was so big that it always came off.
Not that that's a mistake. It's your choice, but you should know there are.... Hey, pick up... What are you doing? Don't leave the fish lying around like that. Why is it still dripping?
- Stupid asshole. Get in the car. - I can't until you open the door. - Shut up. The engine's not completely shot, but Joe said it fails a lot.
He won't stay here forever. And he needs you out there. It's time, Ser Davos. Open the door and the men inside can rejoin their brothers in peace. We'll release the wolf north of the Wall where he belongs.
Does it say "children"? Yes. "Mother and father" can also be read. We know that the bottle has been in the water for a long time. The deposits are at least six years old. The letter is written with tar, maybe it came from a boat?
Then the following is still your best option: a legal aid lawyer. And that's what you'll get for your money. This person starts his day in court, fishes half a dozen random cases out of the wire basket, meets with his clients for half an hour each before facing the judge. He takes the first deal that comes along, then heads to the corner Starbucks, comes back with his latte and moves on to the next file. That's his exact work schedule, six times a day, day in and day out.
Make sure she and her people keep quiet, okay? Okay, let's do it. I want access to every surveillance camera in the city. We're gonna track that fucking emergency van. It's gotta be out there somewhere.
Excuse me, do you happen to have this letter from your uncle? You had just mentioned it. The lawyer gave it to me with the deed. - May I see it for a moment? It's in the car.
No, I did not have the honor. - What do you think about it? It's very well written, but it's preaching to the choir. Yes? I don't think so. What bothers me is the way he mixes terrorism and radicalism.
You're not strong enough, Bunny. What if it kills you? Then I die happy. Death has been my constant companion for almost 50 years now. I've never known for a day if my... my body... if, if it will be defeated, my, my, my mind will leave me.
As he lives and breathes. I need to find your daughter. Is she still bitching about the ring? It's not worth shit. Maybe it reminds her of the better times of yore.
How convenient for you that I can't. You were hinting at me. What do you want? You see that van parked out there? I bet it's loaded with those stolen Justin Hammer guns.
That means power. Did Luke really do all that? You never know exactly what someone is capable of. Go on, get some rest. You can come back to the club when it opens in a few days.
It annoys you that you didn't see it. Because I'm so good at seeing, right? That's why I was such a good point guard. Because I saw everything in front of me in my head. I knew exactly where someone was going to run, and I threw the ball exactly where it needed to go.
She'll take advantage of that to close the deal. A call came in. - From her? - No. It came from inside.
I'm not running away anymore. How many of these you got, brother? Looks like this place doesn't want to be a barbershop anymore. Maybe not. But whatever it turns out to be, it's gonna be famous.
Do Mom and Kyle still have the station wagon? Yeah, but something's broken. - What's wrong with it? - I don't remember. But it still runs?
So, what the hell happened? I don't know. Well, that's exactly what I want to hear from our chief programmer. We haven't completed the diagnosis yet. He's clearly exhibiting abnormal behavior.
He's deadly. He has committed many crimes in Arizona, just recently attacking the Northeast Corridor. They took out reactor 12. 28 dead! Intelligence says he's hiding in Death Zone 714.
Kix! Cease fire! That's an order! Where is he? Do we have a visual? Negative, he's gone.
People do it all the time. They call, make an appointment, come here and lie on my couch. Take a look at it. I like this place. It gives you a 360-degree view of the area, and there are no patrolmen here.
I'll get my hat. Okay. Hold on. You have a special wedding hat? It's just a little hat. It only goes with weddings.
- Do I need my boots? 911 got a call this morning about an explosion. When the unit arrived, a jogger had found a finger. Where? It fell out of a tree right in front of him.
Did officials find any other bombs - or bomb-making materials? - No. Just a bag of carrots. Okay, I'll inform the bomb squad. They'll want to find the other parts of the explosive device to make sure it's completely detonated.
A Parisian getaway. - Good for you, Ma. - Yes, I decided to seize the day. - And the hat? - Does it suit me?
Understood? Thank you, Dr. Bogan. Come. You're a good nurse and a good man. It was an accident that will never happen again, right? - No, it won't.
Good. Holy water on all of us. Bless us all. May the Lord protect us in our mission. The demon inside her has access to all her memories. He will lie to hurt you, to anger you.
Show our men where their allegiance lies. Show them who the Lannisters are and what we do to our enemies. Take back this stupid castle because it's ours and because you can. Your trial starts soon, I have to be there for you. It will be decided by a court battle.
Go on, Ser Davos. Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made this man his chamberlain. He chose Jon to succeed him because he knew he had the courage to do the right thing, even if it meant giving his life. Because both Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow understood that the real war is not fought between a few wavering houses. It is fought between the living and the dead.
- Would you? - Look around you. The city has come back to life. -You make a pact with fanatics -And it works.
Have a drink with me. And you? What is your excuse? I have already tasted wine. It made me feel funny.
I assure you that these demons are real. They killed not only the chosen ones, but also my aunt. Pyria. The Ellcrys will carry a seed. This seed must be taken by a chosen one to a place called Safehold. There it will be immersed in the blood fire.
The fate of the world is in the balance. Without you, all is lost. Bremen. There must be an exit. There has to be.
And if I don't want to? The choice is no longer in your hands. Without training, you won't survive the darkness that will soon be upon us. Cake? - It's delicious.
Thank you, you are the best. You know what? Fire you Rob. How was the Springwood exodus? The funny thing is, it didn't happen.
Well, I don't. Get off! I slept on something. The sword Uncomfortable. The helmet. I know where it is.
He makes us look like idiots. How about this: We get rid of superfluous things. For a clear line. The old catalog was not coherent. It was a plethora of disparate sounds.
I am glad. Well then - wait. This letter arrived for you. Is it for you, Julieta?
No. - Then give me the cup. So, what are your plans now? There's still time for the 8 o'clock bus. It stops in the square.
How is it? Not too gamey? Overcooked. Try the other roast. It's much more tender.
Why are you doing this? I was there. Remember? When you were assigned the Wayne case. I know what he means to you.
- You'll tell me how to get out? - Yes. Okay. There's an elevator. I'll tell you where it is, but... can you pick a lock?
What do you want to achieve with that? Excuse me? You're sacrificing a floor of rental income for a worthless climbing roof? My father didn't build this tallest skyscraper for rent. It's not the tallest.
Do not hope for a miracle. It's possible he won't wake up. Mom, Dad's still here! Will you leave us alone? The cat keeps acting up because he's Dad.
LIFE NEEDS SUGAR You can't escape, Titus! Has the train to Biloxi left yet? No. It's two hours late.
- Anything interesting? - Really not? - No, nothing. It seems to me there is something. There's this stupid movie, it's really stupid. What's it called?
- Really not? - No, nothing. It seems to me there is something. There's a stupid movie. It's really stupid. What's it called? It's called The Stones.
- Gee. Well, we really need to talk to Julian. What do you say, Candy? I say we strip you naked, tie you up on my girlie sled, and drive around the park with your wiener flapping in the wind. And Randy, I know he's short.
But the decision has been made. On Monday, I'll only go to the mask if he's there. I can't do that. Think about your contract. - I'm 12. My contract means nothing. - Yes, it does, okay?
Well then... Tom Quince. Are you ready? We have to wait for the dope. He'll come and everything will be fine.
- Where are you going? - I am going. What will you do for a passport? I have a passport in the name of Thomas Quince. Where is he?
It's good to see you again. I demand that you release me immediately. At once! - Drink, please. - No, thank you. The tea tastes funny, bitter, but it helps with the altitude.
That certainly helps explain Clementine, ... the host we took out of circulation. It appears that yesterday's demonstration was a hoax, designed by Ms. Cullen. - Was it? - I checked the code. It had been altered. ...
- Was it? - I checked the code. It had been changed. ... Clumsy fingerprinting by a QA technician. When you find cancer in an organization, you have to cut it out before it can spread.
What do you get if you cross the godfather with a lawyer? An offer you don't understand. - Clever. - I didn't know that. Believe me, I have the utmost respect for your profession. After all, it is the pillar...
The suit you are wearing is the one off the rack? Please don't say it looks like that. If it looked like that, I wouldn't have asked. Why do you prefer a tailor-made suit? Because it fits you, and only you.
It is the bill for the seeds. And one from Aunt Jocasta. Good, we haven't heard from her in months. - Did you get that plow blade fixed? - Smitty says it broke right down the middle.
I just locked the door to that night and walked away. I never looked back until that moment. And now I see Ross and Kincaid and all the others being made into soldiers and trained. How they talk themselves into courage. But all I can hear is Max Lucas crying out for his mother in the night. For two years I've wanted to stop this war. But now it's here and I don't know if I can stand another war.
And gets a musket shot between the eyes for the trouble. Not if he's careful. And lucky. There's no other way across. If the ground will carry a man on horseback, it can carry a whole infantry.
Please watch out for the blood, the ground is slippery. I bring you my Father's blessing and thanks. Your deeds today will be remembered forever. If this victory had been over foreigners, I would be overjoyed. But since it is over Englishmen, it brings a touch of coldness over my heart.
For me. Because I want it. Understand? That's very smart. I just had this big plan, but it didn't work out. Yes.
- Absolutely. Bobby, I can't make it today. It's an emergency. We'll have to reschedule. I've covered, the wine is open so he can breathe.
What are they up to? There are people standing on the cliff. My parents are not waking up! They're bleeding and they're not waking up! We are now 33 nautical miles north of.... His head flew off. It just flew away.
You can confirm that there are no pathogens present? No, Mulder. I mean, there's nothing there at all. Something is there. There's obviously a substance appearing, but at the same time it's not there.
You have done the right thing, protected the environment. After all, you love the animals. Then it's Friday, maybe Wednesday, and the trash pickup comes. Problem out of the way. Magic. But it's a problem because it ends up in a dump, and the plastic releases toxins into the water and air.
I think mothers have a higher purpose in mind for us. I agree. A child is not an instrument to spread hatred. Where does this hatred end? Maybe where it started. By finding a common language.
I don't think this is the mutation Sanjay was referring to. Did you find anything else in the autopsy? Well, there were no abnormalities in Dr. Sanjay's brain. The opener destroyed the auditory nerve and then penetrated his cerebral cortex. That's funny because the opener has a 90 degree angle and then it turns at 60 degrees into his brain like it's hunting for something.

That's funny because the opener has a 90 degree angle and then it spins at 60 degrees into his brain like it's hunting for something. Yeah, it ended up in his auditory cortex.
I was driving too fast and there was an animal in the middle of the road. I panicked and crashed. I thought I was going to die. But then I heard the sound. It was so loud and piercing. It hurt.
Who do you think you are? Pop the trunk, honey. I got it. It's okay, I got it. He's right under here.
It's okay, I got it. He's right under here. Right under here. It's just a bunch of stuff in here. It's right under there.
But even if it were, Kera, it wouldn't be this one! Because this is not real. And deep down, Kera, you know that too! (GROLL) I can't promise you a life without pain and loss, because pain is part of life, it makes us who we are!
Because this is not real. And deep down, Kera, you know that too! (GROLLING) I can't promise you a life without pain and loss, because pain is part of life, it makes us who we are! It makes you a hero.
I need a warrant. - You want me to write one up? I'll write it. You sign it and give it to a nice judge. What's he for?
I feel sorry for Taser, but it's his own fault. Does Joey Marks know how you treat your customers? Joey who? - He owns the fucking place. Glitter Toe Entertainment owns the shit store, and I like it.
The name of a possible witness turned out to be the code name of an informant for the narcotics squad. At that time, the guy was untouchable. That was almost 40 years ago. So I guess the informant doesn't work cases anymore. You want the name? He's got to be in your snitch directory, right?
Why are you starting a fight? Because Orus is dead and destroys father. And it's all because of you. Your body will recover. It will relax, and then the milk will come.
It is too late for that. It's different for every woman. Let's not fool ourselves, Mother. My body speaks. It tells us that I am not a mother.
The Blue Sky is not frozen. - Genghis Khan said. - As you predicted the other day. "Victory does not belong to him who plays by the rules. It belongs to him who makes the rules, who imposes the rules on his enemies."
How can I be sure? Watch your tone. Our friends are businessmen, and you are very bad for business. Tell them this whole thing will blow over. The dust will settle, and once it does, we'll pick up where we left off.
The others are preparing to evacuate because of the storm. Okay, well, we need to get to that farm right away. - We need to talk to the owner. We are now receiving footage of the typhoon hitting the mainland near Cambodia. It is moving north and will reach Thailand in 24 hours.
That is strange. -He's never late. -His stupid plan went wrong. You liked the plan. But he must have been stupid, or he'd be here.
I found him on the inspection walk. Lucky shot. So this quarry where they found the body, it's government run? Well, that's funny. Cause I know it's owned by the Saddler Company.
Clary, please. Clary, come on. I don't see the cup! We looked. It's not in the apartment.
Clary, come on. I don't see the cup! We looked. It's not in the apartment. You didn't find it, but it could be there.
"Downtown, meaning in the city? Yes, and it's not a request. Maybe things will get better someday. But right now, no one is safe here. Did you hear about Adele's salon? It was torn apart last night.
I can't. I have to go with Zeke to the interview for his internship at my tío.... Crap. He's definitely going to ask me about my song. Which he's paying for. I have to lie to him again and say everything is wonderful. The song is great... Which it clearly isn't.
Oh, the new song? It's great, tío. It's great. Why don't you present it tonight at my benefit gala? I'd love to, but it's not ready yet.
Hope he rhymes as good as he paints. When I first came out my brothers told me Listen to the name Pretty Dizzee D The name was too long For the goddamn song But I made it sound so different
I didn't know that. He only mentioned it 50 times. When do you start having compassion? I put him next to you at dinner later. So who knows how this evening will end? - It's already over.
Jesus, I'm talking about Frances here. Leave this and focus on her, because that's what matters. Everything going all right at home? Diane try to kill you again? Everything's fine at home. That incident, as horrible as it was, saved my marriage.
Listen, this is bullshit. I can have a rescue team here tomorrow morning. That's the policy. We just need the control unit. We found a stray up here, but I don't think it got here by accident.
And to everyone's horror, he killed this little cat. Tore it to pieces. Then he just sat there, confused. This dog had spent his whole life trying to catch this thing. Now he had no idea what to do.
Look, Destin. in a second I'm going to walk away from here and your friends are going to wonder what this is all about. Now your answer may be, "I'm helping behavior track a problem." or .... "I'm a creepy necro perv.". Suit yourself. Five minutes, ... Then he goes into the incinerator. Huh. ...
You should rest. We're going through scalp territory on a train with explosives. Not tired. Can I ask you something? This place you're looking for, what makes you so sure it exists?
Just an extravagant expression designed to attract a partner. All art, literature, Bethoven, Mozart, William Shakespeare, Michelangelo and the Empire State Building, ... just an elaborate mating ritual. Perhaps it doesn't matter that we have cultivated so much for this most basal of reasons. But of course, the peacock can barely fly. It lives in the dirt, pecks insects out of the dung, comforts itself with its great beauty.
- No, thanks. This is for you. - Wow! How was your flight? It was great.
What do you think of Loïe? Loïe? My stage name for dance. Your dance? I like it.
That's over. - Besides, it's going to be dark soon. - I liked the time pimps so much. You need to write more stories. Maybe the gingerbread tastes funny because it's enchanted?
However. There is no need for tears or great outbursts of emotion. I was just saying that... For the future. I think about the future. The day can end just as it began. Without constraints and obligations.
- Boondee. - Boondee. Boondee. You told me you wanted out of the Zone, right? Now, I know this place ain't everything, but it's almost everything.
- Your turn. - I can't. Whoever's in there, it's safe to come out. Follow the smoke. It will set you free.
Let them drag rocks to the dike in the field first. Miss Hammershøi. But he can't do that! Because of his club foot. Elmer's foot hurts when he carries heavy things. I'm sure he won't have any problems.
She'll be right back. This always happens at our weddings. Kimmy, what's wrong? I like the cake. Have some before it's gone.
Why? There couldn't be a worse time for this. Is your computer spinning again? My computer isn't just spinning. It's replacing my mind.
To the pearly gates? No, no. Not yet, at least. - Do you know the story of the phoenix? - Yes, a mythical bird. It burns when it dies... - only to rise again from the ashes.
Lawyers, tax consultants... the whole nine yards. The guys in his store are preparing their resumes. Well, if it was just smoke, they'd issue a denial.... Keep working. Yes. They're treating this article like it's a warrant.
-Nice speech at the meeting yesterday. -Yes. This city is light years ahead of others. Is there competition for the port? Can another city win the bid? The most important thing is that it be built here in the area.
-Yes. This city is light years ahead of others. Is there competition for the port? Can another city win the bid? The most important thing is that it be built here in the area. But no matter where, it's of enormous value to the treasury.
Yes, that's what my report says. But there's no indication of another shooter. Tell me, Detective, did you draw your weapon? I drew my gun, but I didn't shoot. I know it sounds funny, but the shot sounded like it came from a high-powered rifle - from a nearby rooftop.
Do you have a bulletproof vest with you? Yes, I always have it with me. But it's no use if you get hit in the head, is it? No, that's true. But very few people aim for the head because it's so hard to hit.
Okay! Take care! I couldn't sleep last night. There is so much speculation about who will get the award. Could it be that it will go to Rolf Innherad and "Oil for Development"?
I'm sorry to hear that. You know the underlying story, right? Somebody is killing people and burying the evidence. Why would I be watching the contracting officer? Did you know he was connected to Elias' partner, Bruce?
It certainly can. But does your machine know the password? Or more importantly, does she know what will happen when the virus circulates? Have you told her the truth, Harold? That it might destroy Samaritan, but it would also kill your machine.
I give you the opportunity to save your machine, which you obviously love so much and which also loves you. - For what reason? - Samaritan considers your machine a much-needed companion for what promises to be a fantastic journey. That virus you uploaded is nothing more than a tragic mistake. Tell me, after it wipes out both ASIs, what's next?
Okay, how do you feel? Fine. Everything's fine. Is his collar okay? It's very nice.
What was it like there? The sun was shining. You have to get my ring. I hid it upstairs when he brought me here. It's in the bathroom.
- What? - Things change over time. Look here. Here is your bridge. Here is the tributary where it belongs.
Yes, but I forgot something, so I came back. Well done, Ricky. Good on you for taking the initiative. Have you ever been up there in that jungle? It's not a jungle, it's the bush. It's a million acres, kid.
That goes over the air 4 to 5 times a day. It's going to be a hit. What about ACR? We're recording a crazy track right now. What's it called?
- We have to cut it open. - We don't know what's inside this thing. Yeah, exactly. What if the suit doesn't protect it from us? What if it protects us from it?
The Rolodex? Our database. Justin Albert Kim... held out for three weeks at a boot camp in Coronado before breaking his leg and being released for medical reasons. I was able to flag several places that might be of interest. This could be nothing, but we need to follow the thread until it is cut.
I could use my clubs. But I suppose I'm not here to play golf. Have you been briefed on the situation at Isodyne? I'm working on the report now. It will be non-controversial.
When we get to zero matter, Cal, the council is under us. It is crazy. Galileo was thought to be crazy. The plan will work. It will work.
Why did you try to steal this from the vault in New York? Maybe I was hired to steal that. Maybe the pin isn't just a pin. Maybe the pin reveals the secrets behind every great decision made in this cesspool of a country. Maybe it just matched my blouse.
He is just one of many. Do you have any idea how deeply corrupted SSR is? 33-23-33... Your idealism is blinding you, Peggy. And it will kill us all.
- Sorry. Say something about my cock. Your dick feels so good. Doesn't it? - It feels good.
- My tail has fallen asleep. He knows that you know that he knows. I don't know what it is, but... my big dick is asleep. Oh no. He fell asleep?
- What does that mean? If we want to end this once and for all, we have to open the crack, get the zero matter out of Whitney - and send it back where it came from. - It's not that simple. We don't really understand how the crack works. It was discovered by accident in the first place.
We can't give him that. Then they would be finished. We can't give that information to a terrorist. We can, but only if we find him before he acts. We could send a worm in the attachment. If it gets opened, we know where the recipient is.
You think a boy who dances is funny? When I dance, I take in everything around me. In the process, I don't cheat. Dance doesn't lie. It is sacred.
I need to know what happened. Monty... Please. We landed in the snow. Your father said he cushioned some of the impact.
- Good. - Otan. Emori, get in the boat. Now give me the backpack. He's all yours, Chancellor.
She knows that this... is not the hottest party. So it's all good. - Where'd you get the toaster? - It was here when we moved in.
We're talking about terrorists from the 70s with 21st century weapons. - And since we don't know where Savage went.... - We don't need to find Savage. We just need to find the missing part of my suit. It's shrinking because it's made of an alloy that mimics the intra-molecular compression of a dwarf star and therefore emits alpha particles.
Laurence Laurentz. And you look wonderful. How do you feel? This collar here is a little tight. No. It fits very well, looks fabulous.
Really? Did you see where Mr. Flaherty put the flash drive? In the emergency kit. Okay, Sophie, show me the flash drive. There it is.
The family that owned it bequeathed it to the state in the 1930s. The state turned it into a living-history museum. Every elementary school within 50 miles of it took field trips here. This place existed long before the modern world developed around it. I think people came here because they thought it would still exist after the modern world collapsed.
And you don't know how many people they have? "Main building" No. "Parking lot" No. I once saw a room where they stored their food. It wasn't big, so...
These things will kill you. They already have. I'm a dead woman walking. Which puts us right in the same boat. My arm feels like it's on fire.
If I believed in the old words, I would pray for him. But that is lost to me now. Perhaps that is the root of what ails me. I have lost my faith. Or he has left me.
- Good. Coordinate it with your mom, but keep the confidants to a minimum. Then there's the matter of large-scale camp surveillance. You want us to spy on our own people? We can't carry out what it takes to protect the camp if every order I give is leaked before it's carried out.
You've got to see this. Anna Gunn is awesome. But people are getting a time jump. Okay? Just make sure it's not... ...bumpy.
I was already afraid that something terrible had happened. So I thought, if you don't pick me up, I'll climb this tree and stay there overnight. It sure would be nice to sleep in a tree. Wild, overgrown and full of blossoms. Can you imagine what it would look like only in the moonlight?
Yeah, but I can't stop thinking about Brooke. She's searching. She's suffering. That's the thing about atheism. It doesn't take away your pain, just your hope.
- Yes. - Right. So we flat paper people would perceive this three-dimensional cube as many separate two-dimensional moments. As time passing. The point on the line moves through space and time. - But in fact, the cube and this line are solid. - Yes, it just stands there.
You could practice your politics here. Sow goodwill among your people. - My army is bigger than his. - That's great news. You didn't mind the war when it was against Ariq.
Important Kaidu. It was hard to come here, mother. You brought me here. The tree has healing powers, you said. It has the spirit.
- Good. What does your female instinct tell you? I don't have any. Of course you do. It just needs to be nurtured.
- If I ever visit your homeland, you may show me the way. But until then, be quiet. Release the bird of prey. Let him fly north.
He also performed brain surgery. Something was taken from you. It must be the room where I met the master before. Help me. Unconscious memories are sometimes suppressed for a reason. The mind protects itself from what it would rather not know. The lock pulls up the drawbridge.
There's no way he's driving a quad past explosions. Hey, your body is not a commodity. You decide what you want to do with it... My body is a commodity, okay? It's my asset.
- Are you all right? - Close the door. - Is my courier here? - Not yet, boss. Let me know when he arrives.
What the hell is that? This is my offspring, my future. You want to hold him? This screaming meatball is the result of your infidelity. He came out of your wife's vagina.
I'm just saying that now. This is not about any game. Are you all right? I don't like what this place is doing to everybody. - I don't like what it's doing to me either.
We are looking for a friend. There's a place. They send you there and you never come back. You can hear the screams all night. This place, where is it?
This dance is more joyful. It is the most joyful dance of all. When we have gone through a long, sorrowful time, we are very happy to be able to dance again. In dance we express ourselves. Ten years ago I was doing research here with some colleagues, scientists from Vanuatu. Does it seem strange to you that people come here to work and study the volcano, what happens in it, when it erupts?
The mountain could spit fire at any moment, 70,000 people were quickly evacuated. There was great fear, because people still remembered an event of apocalyptic proportions. As everyone knew, in 1902 Mont Pelé had erupted on the neighboring island of Martinique. The signals emitted by the volcano La Soufrière on Guadeloupe were almost identical to those measured at Mont Pelé in 1902. Therefore, everyone feared that it would erupt. They feared a huge eruption with many times the force of an atomic bomb like the one dropped on Hiroshima.
Just shut up, Mary. We don't want to end up in jail because of your mouth. I'm trying, honey. Not a good place for a car to break down. We didn't choose this place, it chose us.
Negative, CAPCOM. This jeopardizes the entire mission. Do not, under any circumstances, jettison the retrorockets. Tell him do not jettison retrorockets. NASA confirms a heat shield malfunction that may have loosened. If the heat shield has loosened, it could be held in place by the retrorockets.
-Oh, God, my dick. My dick is really hard. I know, baby. No, really. It's really hard.
He's really tough. -I know, Vinnie... -Oh, God. -Vinnie, stick it in me. -Yeah? -Yeah? He's in.
There is an old story from Ireland, where I once lived. We have an old tradition there of lamenting the dead. After a death, the old women gather and sing the most touching and beautiful laments. This way they can sing the soul to a better place, a place of heavenly peace, or even rapture. But a few years ago, the old men of the Catholic Church decided that they would no longer tolerate this pagan custom, as it undermined their rituals and secrets.
Mine, too. Mr. Douglas has a compass. What are you doing now? Following it. - No kidding? - Where's he going?
The house belongs to Alex. What are you doing here? - We followed the compass. - What compass? - Why is he doing that?
- Come on. - ... Skrillex. Go ahead. Welcome to the lion's den, kid. Sonic, throw the laser off the wall this time, so it can bounce off their bells.
- Faggot! Calm down. Since when are you so homophobic? We paid for the bus. Then it broke down and there was a riot.
It's unmistakable, Lieutenant. It belonged to Betsy Ross. It's a ruin. It's a shame what this place has become. It was magnificent in its day.
That day may also come in the future. And... that's why I'm... going to do this. No. In chess, this move is called a sacrifice. At first glance, it looks like a loss... but in the end, you gain tactical superiority.
- The hangar doors are still stuck. We were able to pry them halfway open, but until I get a new drive pump, we're stuck. Not necessarily. Coulson has another way. But it's risky and irresponsible.
She would be able to hear everything. Every death, every death cry, all at once. It will kill her. Not only that... Her own death scream could be so powerful that it might kill everyone around her as well.
- No. But if you try to kill my son again, I'll put you in one of those myself. She's still mad. - That's the worst plan I've ever heard. - The plan is perfect, and it will work perfectly, especially if you agree to drive the van.
- She made it. Kira did it. Where's the card reader? It should be here. It has to be here.
Damnatio Memoriae. That's what they wanted. They wanted Sebastien to remember his name. Scott, you know the myth of what happens when you call a werewolf by his first name? - He turns back into a human.
- It should be me. If you get me close enough, I will. We're not killing your best friend. This is mine. He's a family heirloom.
We're not killing your best friend. This is mine. He's a family heirloom. I'd like him back, please. He's all yours.
So he can what? Stop time? No, no. Watch the time stamp. It keeps running. Yeah, okay.
I, no, I have to go. Where are you going... Finding Turtle is the most important thing right now. Yeah, that's important to me too. But we need to see if your speed still works. - I think it still works.
Hey! Hey! You can't tow the Jeep. The paperwork says yes. It's registered as abandoned.
Hey, you can't tow the Jeep. The paperwork says yes. It's registered as abandoned. And now it's not.
I have no clue. I mean, this thing was a piece of junk before. God only knows who would want it now. Maybe somebody dumped it there? Is there any way to track the history of the Jeep after it was stolen?
You might say death is inevitable, yet here I sit at 1,000 years old, sipping exquisitely aged whiskey while a beguiling muse sits across from me. I am the perfect example of health and vitality, a master of my destiny, a conqueror of death itself. See? That's exactly what I mean. You spout superficialities, a farce about death, as if it meant nothing to you, but it does.
No one can help you. Understand? Young... healthy, a little primitive, but not bad. Listen to the heartbeat. It will tell you when to stop.
What? They can't... they can't cure her. What do you mean they can't heal her? The damage to her spinal cord, it's...
They can't... they can't cure her. What do you mean they can't heal her? The damage to her spinal cord, it's -- Oliver, it's permanent.
You saw what kind of man my brother was, what kind of man he is. He belongs to your family. You said he was a good man. - Maybe part of him still is. Down. The damage to her spinal cord, it's permanent.
Mr. Dennis says you won't be presenting the battery to the board again. - Well, my test run was an epic disaster. - Yes, I know. It was a spectacular failure. - It was really bad. - Okay.
Please tell me that the nails are the track, and not the contents of the laptop's hard drive, because there are three nails going through that thing. Yes. The bad guys went a little crazy with the nail gun. According to Andy, they're called the demolition squad, formerly GRU, IRA, and Mossad. - They're experts at precision demolitions. - Now they work for HIVE. I took a look at the laptop before it was shot up, and there were blueprints on it.
Just a few months ago I was a diving instructor. Would never have dreamed of taking a life. Wouldn't have done it. This place is truly hell. It makes monsters out of all of us.
That was Reiter. But there's still a way off the island. And I thought you'd never use the radio equipment I gave you to report for a trip home. Well, I lost it for a while - and the job wasn't done yet. - And it is now.
Let's go. In Vietnam, they said I was crazy. Said the jungle could do that to a person. I knew it. The war wasn't over there. It was here.
He told me that he wants to destroy time... so that there is no more death. He made it sound almost beautiful. But it isn't. Death is... everything. It's a time clock that makes us better.
But it is not. Death is... everything. He is a time clock that makes us better. He makes us love stronger. I don't know, I think maybe it's... what makes us human.
We can walk out of this room and look for her together. You'll never see Daisy again. Go ahead. Destroy this body. It's already worn down.
-I don't know either. It's just different. Do you want to leave? Why is this table in the middle of the room? This chair looks like it popped out of here through a Tang Dynasty wormhole.
Brown sweater, alprazolam, mouth guard. Hopefully, it's in a can. Alprazolam's not upstairs. He keeps that with all the pills in the kitchen with the spices. That makes as much sense as a sarape on a velvet sofa. The brown sweater is in a cedar chest in the closet so it smells like the cabin where he read The Catcher in the Rye.
Warn the pack. Whoever sees Vargas, kill them. You were locked in here. The demon could have killed you by now. It's after Clary.
Oh, here we go. Go get him, Bar. Not fast enough, Thawne. I will never lose to you again. This war between us, it ends now!
Yes, yes, I would... I would love to. - You would? - Okay. My head feels like it's in a vice.
- I do not know. Saving the girl I love and the world at the same time? Feels pretty right to me. The jet's shaking pretty bad. I hope he... through it.
- No, I can't possibly do that. Boy, come here. You look like a dear boy. Could I ask you to bring the letter in through that door, put it on the big table in there, and then run out again? - Who is it for?
- Are you sure? - I saw him with my own eyes. Finn must have come back when Davina revived me. The spell was tied to the blood of the Mikaelson line. Either it worked on him or he found a way to claim it for himself.
Your feelings may not have changed, but mine have. I've been lying to myself, trying to hold on. But the part of me that... ...loved you, the part that... hoped for your redemption... That part was human. And it's gone.
Finn. - What's going on? - What's happening? What's wrong with him? His body, it's dying.
And Freya is sure that this power will be enough to kill Lucien? Yes. But we would be putting Davina in terrible danger. The only thing protecting her from the elders is Freya's circle. Well, if it's broken...
For what purpose, sir? A necessary ruse. Moreover, I now possess all of Palmer's knowledge, as well as his memories. Mindful of this, through Palmer's memories, I have already located the other nuclear device. - Where is it?
I am so sorry for your loss. Yes. Did you tell her that her old boiler can kill? I did, actually, yes. I told her that it can be deadly.
Who is "Hyperion"? Obviously a big fucking fish. All right, so the plan is that we raid subway and somehow kidnap him in front of "MacArthur Park Station". Judging by the security presence, it looks like "Wilshire Vermont" is the final stop. But we're going to rob the train further up, here in this tunnel before it reaches "MacArthur Park Station".
Towards the good. The competition was a turning point for us. -Yes. -You know. It was a fiasco.
Listen. There once was a boy. His father bought him a falcon for his sixth birthday. You want to tell me a story now? Just listen, please. His father told him to tame the bird. To make it obey.
His father told him to tame the bird. To make it obey. That's crazy. The boy spent every day with the hawk. He scratched him.
Luke, are you okay? What happened? The other one looks worse. Attacked by a Forsaken or something. Either way, he's dead.
Will you help me put the locks on the cabinets. It's Saturday. We're going to make a baby sling. Isn't the baby a little young for a sling? It's for the sink.
Ivan the Terrible killed thousands. Herod had every male child under the age of two killed. And if Jesus had not been in a manger, he would have killed him too. Because a younger, faster king would take everything from him. Do you think this palace is made of wood and stone? It is made of blood.
Marci came to see me, though. Some bosses at her firm were impressed with my opening statement in the Castle trial. Yeah, I'm not surprised. Me neither. Not anymore. Much of the trial was a disaster, but it made me realize that I was doing my job well.
If I knew that, this conversation would be redundant. It's not much to begin with. You can be sure that his merchandise is well guarded, by professionals who are undoubtedly more capable than mine. But I'm afraid the road you're taking won't be an easy one. Yes, it never is.
- Probably a crime of passion. - I see. Have you ever had therapy? Your anger, your problem with trust... Your affinity for dull men. Let's focus on the case. If it's interesting.
Because he had no confidence in me. I used to think like that. But now I know deep in my heart, God has a plan for me. Oh, His plan for me was quite clear. Who knows if it is accomplished.
Please. You shouldn't fool children. It shows what kind you are. Look at your sweater. It's ruined.
You shouldn't fool children. It shows what kind you are. Look at your sweater. It's ruined. It's dirty.
Yes, really beautiful. - Hey, that star on your arm... - I earned it. You will too with a little effort, the whole sleeve full. - What does it mean?
And then I came here and... it's impressive that I've survived this long without knowing that I'm a mage. I can't go back. Okay. There's a spell, if they question you, they can't read your mind, I'll write it down. It's bulletproof.
They will capture you. Change you, into something else. Now that I have your attention, we will test you to determine your focus. Your focus of study. It will make you, and with the right guidance, you may safely soar to unknown heights.
That is why he hated me for becoming a pied piper. That I became someone who kills for a living. He feared that darkness inside of him... and in me. The war has led to countless atrocities, Mr. Fet. It has brought out the worst in human behavior.
Yo, guys, are you seeing this? Oh, yeah, we see it. - All right, any ideas? - The viscosity of the asphalt decreases its temperature. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it's hardening.
This does not work. Not like this. It can't be that gloomy. "Big, patient eyes." "They sparkled red, blue, and yellow, just like that damn Jesus fish when he pulled him out of the fog and into hell."
But we have to cut that off. It can't affect our plan. Because that's the one thing... we've worked out. When Walker and Vasquez... betrayed us... when he pulled the Secretary of State out from under me... there was no room for doubt. We were going down a path. A difficult one, because we didn't know exactly... where it would lead us.
"ICO Occupies Kurdish Stronghold." How many of you know about the ICO? They are Muslim extremists seizing oil fields in Syria. The media barely deals with them...because the White House is blind in one eye. As governor of New York... I can't be blind to terrorism... because it's already here, right on our doorstep.
So, was it like Joshua? Did you see him get away? I told you, it's not always like that. How do you know he's gone?
- Yes, I'm fine. What happened? Since all the other cracks were closed, the energy surge must have destabilized the last remaining crack. What does that mean? As long as it's unstable, Barry and Cisco will be trapped there.
I like him. He's going all out. What's the matter, boys? You're so serious. Now a joke in Spanish. It lasts 12 minutes.
You did like swimming, so that's the next logical step. - Could be fun. - Yeah. I once trained for a half marathon. If you have a wish, you can do anything. If you have a wish, it goes in a can.
I'm not talking about my perfume. That's why I wait until he gets a little more specific. My mustache. I've been growing it for weeks. And you two have been suspiciously quiet. It's very dashing.
I'm just a human being like you. I have to tell my staff what to do like everyone else. That's so funny. - Barbra, today is his birthday! - Actually, it was three weeks ago.
And they make butterscotch that will make your taste buds explode. You can't possibly be serious. That's sheer madness! No, this is the most sensible decision I've ever made in my life. Cancer is back, it's everywhere.
Do you know this woman? Never seen her before. But I can keep an eye out for her. That would be great, thank you. You look like the sky is falling. Let the sky stay where it is.
If the public doesn't trust us, they won't listen to us, and if they don't listen to us, people will end up dead. Behind these gates, 4,000 people are being held and their only goal is to stay healthy. Our only goal is to make sure those gates hold. Because if they don't, every person in this city risks infection. And once the virus is out, it's out.
- How was her suit? Hey, that's a fair question. Indeed it is. How was her suit built? It was good.
Hey, that's a fair question. Indeed it is. How was her suit built? It was good. It was very good.
Let us help you, please. This is all the help I need. How does it feel to know I'm faster than you'll ever be? I'll see you. The lightning, it's turning blue.
Now, at the latest, we know why. - Did you find Jesse? - She went out. Barry, what's going on? It's just, right before Eliza disappeared, her flash, it turned blue.
Exactly. Good boy. -He's squirming. -Of course, it's a worm. He'll stop as soon as you put him on the hook.
Thank you! Rich man or poor beggar, death does not discriminate. Death does not flee from your demons. He does not repent for them either. He does not care about such things.
Killed us both? Why are you keeping secrets? I wanted peace. We've all seen what war has done to the world. It creates refugees!
If you follow his instructions, you will improve the Speed Force in your body and run faster... than you ever thought possible. If this doesn't work, I'll be back. Dr. Wells, we need you. Time to go home, Flash. Okay, our satellite finally found our floating friend and he's coming back.
It's... Forget it. It's okay. You care about your store. Yeah, but it's not...
They talked to you? Which one of them? Giles? A younger cop, tall... He said I left DNA.
Yes, we chose different birds to emphasize the natural touch that Martín's identity represents. This one, with the moon in the background, is a taquara. I think it represents you best, Martín. We had a problem with the beak on this one, but it's typical of this area.
All right. This is where we split up. The entrance to the tunnels is right over here. Yes. We know where it is.
This city is fucked because of you. It was quiet and normal. Until you rode in on your high horse, talking about science and changing the future. You didn't think for a moment about what your particle accelerator could do to others. You thought only about how it could benefit you.
- They found him. Professor Sunderland and March found him trying to open a portal at Welters Stadium. Where are they taking him? Have you been in this room before? It was designed at the turn of the century, for a cult for incredibly delicate experiments.
Where are they taking him? Have you ever been in this room? It was designed at the turn of the century, for a cult for incredibly delicate experiments. Mechanisms in the walls prevent magic, it's a clean room. It wasn't designed for this purpose, but it'll do.
- Should be quick. What did you change? I deleted the section about love. - That's the best part. - It was too sappy.
I rack my brain over and over again. What we could have done differently. Who we should have done a better job of keeping in check. I'm absolutely terrified, Claire. If we can't stop the damage, it has to be limited.
Entrusted to the one who sits behind this desk.... is something essentially elemental: the survival of our nation. And I, as your President, must face the storm before us. That storm is terror. More dangerous and unpredictable than any hurricane. It has put us in harm's way abroad.
And I, as your president, must face the storm before us. This storm is terror. More dangerous and unpredictable than any hurricane. It has put us in danger abroad. It has put us in danger at home.
This storm is terror. More dangerous and unpredictable than any hurricane. It has put us in danger abroad. He has put us in danger at home. And right now, it's putting James Miller in the worst of all dangers.
I'm better at writing things down, then I can just fix them later. This code work suits me. I like it when the code works. Do me a favor, say the sky is green. But it isn't.
This code work suits me. I like it when the code works. Do me a favor, say the sky is green. But it isn't. It's blue.
I like it when the code works. Do me a favor, say that the sky is green. But it's not. It is blue. More precisely, it appears to be blue because of diffuse sky radiation.
You saw the scars, Jackson. You said so yourself. They look like they're on your arm. If we can figure out what happened to him, we can stop it from happening to you. His arm looks like it's been bitten off.
You said it yourself. They look like they're on your arm. If we can find out what happened to him, then we can stop it from happening to you. His arm looks like it's been bitten off. More like it was gnawed off.
Are you alone? Alone and unarmed, as promised. i am alone, but i don't go anywhere unarmed, sorry. I'm here because I'm worried about my daughter. And if the war continues, it will destroy the kingdom, but most of all, it will destroy her soul.
- You don't look like one of his daughters. - Yeah, I was just kidding. - No, it was a good one. A good joke. - It wasn't.
About killing you. Let me see your ring. You know what this is? It's a noose. Only it won't kill you right away.
I let my brother drown so that I could save myself. So that's why you're hallucinating him? While a false version of your brother is pissed about something you did in a false reality? The hellstone is trying to tell me something. He's trying to prove something to me.
- I'll be right there. - Bye. I waited for you at our lunch table. Yeah, I wasn't hungry. I saved a cupcake for you. It's a little smushed, but...
To prevent absolute power. Max, we have to hide this crystal where Phears will never find it. I don't have it. I don't have it. Max, where is it?
What's all this about, Max? You wouldn't believe a word I said. Try me. I found the crystal at home. It came from scientists who used it to trap an evil spirit, but somehow it escaped and took over the body of a TV show star at the old Grover mansion.
Yes, of course. - Good. I'd really like my crystal back, Max. You want it? It's so beautiful, Max.
I'm curious, Shadowhunter, knowing so much about portals, don't you ever wonder why the shard behaves differently than normal portals? Normal portals only take you to known places. Never thought about it. Isabelle is the smart one in the family. The shard works that way because it's from another dimension.
Don't ever call me again. - What the hell is that? - Let's go. Is he dead? Did he go through?
- Ragnor. - Shax demon. The creature surprised me. How does a demon overcome Ragnor's defenses? It followed us.
- Thank you. Wearing this dress makes me more nervous than any battlefield. That's pretty normal. Lydia, I need to talk to you about something. What is it? Valentine sent a Shax demon after us today. He killed Ragnor Fell.
Nothing, mother. - Drink. - Don't drink it. It's poisoned. No, it's not.
That's why we're flying there. Damian Hall's body was found at a place called Aokigahara. Have you heard of it, Clara? Aokigahara is a park at the foot of Mount Fuji. Its name means "lake of trees" but it has an even more despicable name....
Fuck you! So you saved Abdi's life. What is he to you? A beautiful name, Abdi. It stands for loyalty and fidelity.
This is 98% of why I participate here and I am very happy. "A relationship where I can be strong and powerful in my life, but when I look at him, I soften. A relationship where I am free and dance in the stars because I feel the strength and presence of my husband and know that nothing can shake that. A relationship where I feel like a silly girl, where his heart and chest are where I feel the masculine heart of the universe. His body when he touches me is safety, warmth, strength, power, peace, adventure and allows me to access the entire universe.
That that's why he watches it, and maybe he's thinking about what's possible for him. And what about introducing people to Tony Robbins? I don't know if that interests that many people. If the success of your film is based on that, you have a problem. It should be based on more.
And what about introducing people to Tony Robbins? I don't know if that interests that many people. If the success of your film is based on that, you have a problem. It should be based on more. It should be based on what people find fulfillment in, what makes them alive, hungry, what makes them change.
Can you see the little yellow star? At the end of that curve? It's coming from near him. Formed in the heart of a red hole and hardened into pure dwarf star crystal. The gem is intuitive. It knows what you want and draws energy from the nearest star to make it real.
Good night. Grant, I need you to focus. What's happening to me? Intuitive crystal, plus too many comics. The gem gives you what it thinks you want.
So I'm a superhero now? Once the gem is out of you, you will become normal again. - It will disappear. - But how will it come out? Like I said, it disappears.
- Help me! - Oh, you'll be okay. The ship blows up before they choke you to death. - So what's plan B? - I don't know, but it'll be a relief when I think of it.
The power of the author is stronger than the bearded old man would have you believe. I destroyed the pen. Oh, yes, yes, I know what you did. We hear everything down here. But I guess you don't know much about the pen, do you? The wizard left you all the fountain pen, but it's not just a pen. It's a magical energy.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know what you did. We hear everything down here. But I guess you don't know much about the pen, do you? The wizard left you all the pen, but it's not just a pen. It's a magical energy. It's a living, breathing thing.
We hear everything down here. But I guess you don't know much about the pen, do you? The wizard left you all the pen, but it's not just a pen. It's a magical energy. It's a living, breathing thing. It's alive? Yes.
The wizard left you all the pen, but it is not a simple pen. It is a magical energy. He is a living, breathing being. It's alive? Yes. And when you broke it, Henry, you sent it down here into the underworld, its purpose unfulfilled. He embodies unfinished business.
They blame us. The blame for what? It's fog. Fog is fog. It comes and it goes.
Are you saying you went after my job? Of course not. But who am I kidding? I mean, I'm not Frodo. Once I got the Ring of Power, we all know it would come over me.
- And what's their goddamn plan? - Excuse me? Jessica, our reputation is taking a hit. We need to restore it. And that means pro bono representation, and you know it. A pro bono case isn't going to do anything, no matter how worthwhile it is.
He represents himself? I am not saying that. Then what do you mean? I mean I have a plan, but I want your blessing. Whatever it is, I'm behind it.
He's a Harvard lawyer. He can speculate. - Rejected. - No, you are right. He will probably be overruled, but if you think that's why I said all that, then you don't seem to know me.
You're less than a day away from going to jail, and you're thinking dresses and bloomers? - Harvey... - You know what? I'll be your best man, on one condition. - That ship has sailed. - The hell it has.
- What happened to your real family? Right. It was a stupid question. Do you have a name? It's ten thousand.
- Hey. - Jane's transmitter has been reactivated. - How so? I hid another transmitter in her belt. - You what? - It's set to begin transmitting two hours after she leaves.
When they couldn't find any wreckage, you thought the transponder had been turned off. So if we turn it back on.... Yeah, hopefully somebody will be able to see where we are. Doc, give us a hand, will you? Where's the transponder? Here, it's off.
I need to find the people who are responsible for this. The people who tattooed Jane. Please. This job is all I have. No. It's all you had.
The last time we followed one of his paintings, there was a bomb waiting for us. We can't show up there posing as FBI. Then we pose as civilians. This dog can really pick up the scent of bombs? I hope so, otherwise it would be unsuitable as a bomb-sniffing dog.
But so many Ahmadis in the U.S. is a very disturbing development. They would only take such a risk if they were planning an attack. We need to find out where Maya was before she was found. The clan could be hiding there. Only if we find her hiding place can we foil this attack before it is carried out.
Orange blossom water if you're feeling homesick. DC. I start in two weeks. Or rather, we do. Here's a flash drive, it will decrypt Ryan's passwords.
Alex, do you have a second? Yes. We've been going over Miranda's schedule. The whole week. It doesn't match the voice.
I answered and a voice told me to rent a van and park it on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. At first I refused, but then they sent me photos of my sister. And of their young children. After that, I didn't ask any more questions. What make and model was the van? It was gray.
Someone wants to scare you, to screw you over. Why? I've only known about this case for an hour. - How could... - ...have anything to do with you?
They went to Luxor and started over there. So they moved their new capital... right next to the Valley of the Kings. You're back. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to pry. I found the catalog for 55 and thought it might be useful for you,
- It's the end of an era, gentlemen. Let's finish this season and move on. - You shouldn't be reading this. - Why not? If there is a war, it will affect us all.
Lady Evelyn. Mr. Carter. Since I put most of my fortune into this dig, I suppose that means I am ruined. We should have seen this coming. We all knew which way the wind was blowing, and it's blowing the British out of Egypt.
- Well, yes. Yes, I do. - I can't, it's terrible! My name is terrible? You think my name is terrible? It's a little awful.
Yes, sir. Excuse me. These last few years... have been an extraordinary privilege. To be so close... to beauty. I wish it had lasted longer. And as for Tutankhamun... It was Lord Carnarvon's wish... ...and mine too... that his body remain where it was laid to rest.
Who has the scientific data now, idiot? - Oh man, look at that. - Yep. The tumor is alive while the surrounding tissue is necrotic. It's been feeding on him, in the cold ground under the Hendrix garage.
- Yes, very duro. - Come with me to the bathroom. Yes, please. Take me to the bathroom. Is this your leaning tower? He is no longer leaning.
Another one who thought she could handle it all by herself. The deal was necessary, S. You traded my mother behind my back. Cosima needs a cure, and I need to get rid of the bot. I need him to make me sick.
It's over. Where are we? What is this place? It used to be the edge of the known world. And it still is today.
I love listening to your stories. - You are great. - Someday you will, I promise. Why don't you drink the juice? It's good for your health.
I don't know if I'm a... Benjamin has shown no talent with either the sword or ammunition. Maybe his failure is the weapons, maybe it's the trainer.... - and maybe it's both. - Hey, you know... The man I shot to save Carol, the staff couldn't have saved her. Did he save you?
People want to follow someone. That is human nature. They want someone who makes them feel safe. And people who feel safe are far less dangerous.... more productive. They see a guy with a tiger - gosh! Start telling stories that he was found in the wild, wrestled into submission and made his pet.
Oh, shit. You okay down there? Your penis? I mean, that guy, he... stomped on it. Or is it... on the ground?
No. The detachment was slight. The baby's heartbeat is normal. Here, listen. There he is.
What are you looking for? My mirror. Where is my mirror? Is it not there?
What are you looking for? My mirror. Where is my mirror? Isn't it there? No, unless he can make himself invisible.
He's all over the place here. Oh, God. Stop it. Just because I'm sitting at a desk doesn't make your job any harder than mine. It is harder.
My turn. Caputo has another brand. Here comes my girl. P, tell these chicks my job is just as hard as digging ditches. It's not.
- That's it. - That's it. What do we do now? As soon as I cut into her, I need you to push the incision open. Make sure it doesn't close so I can get whatever's killing her.
Most of them, yes. We need to know if there is a plan. Now. I've got a car parked downstairs, John. I just have to wait - until he drives up...
This is where we're supposed to hole up for a few days? - Come on. - Yes, sir. We're gonna need a bigger bunker for starters. Very funny, asshole. It's underground.
We have all made mistakes. I spent many nights thinking about my mistakes. Then I realized it was the injustices done to me that led to this. As a result, I went on a vendetta. And let me tell you something, my friend: it is of biblical proportions.
You have to pinch the jaws really hard. So hard you could crack a walnut with it. Oh, my goodness. That ass is as hard as Detroit steel, Daddy. - Yeah, and he ain't the only thing.
I'm appointing you agent. You can have my office, because I quit. - What? - Who needs the stress? Thirty years I've been doing this job, and it's been eating me up inside.
How do we take care of this Bill? All I can think of is breakfast. His name is Baal. - Screw you. We need the Kandorian dagger. Where is it?
- Fuck you. We need the Kandorian dagger. Where is it? - Someone confiscated it. Tell me where it is.
Where is it? - Someone confiscated it. Tell me where it is. All right. It's in the evidence room.
And at that moment, under beating from the living, the dead bit me. Someone pulled me out of the melee. And that was Luciana. She brought me back and we waited for my death. - But it did not happen.
- Do you want to kill Victor? Translate! Who are you talking about? What's the boy's name? Is his name Nick?
That I'm better off, with my correct little life. In my proper little store in proper little Olympia. With half correct children. All lies. I miss the spotlight on my face. Telling a joke and feeling it hit home.
Unicorns are for babies. My film is neither glamorous nor sexy. You won't be the hero that everyone loves, but a gas station attendant who fights with his daughter over jelly beans. That's the whole movie. It's small and real, with a director who recognizes something in you.
But you don't have to die for him. I have no intention of dying. The faith we have inside protects us. - All lies. - But he helps us anyway!
-while being driven by them. -Something for everyone. -The demand is increasing rapidly. That's why we need bigger office space. You arrive, clock in. Put sugar in your coffee and watch it slowly dissolve into nothing.
Many of them made up, but real nonetheless. Hearing it from the friends he loves the most, which is you and me, would mean a lot to him. Okay. But do you think he was that good in the movie? I didn't see it. It seemed so long.
Remember. The dysfunctions of the hosts were colorful. ( What did you say? ) The human spirit, Bernard, is not a golden reference point, ... shimmering on a green and distant hill. No, it is a vile, ... polluted ruin.
Do you really want to do this? Are you crazy? This coffee is really good, though. How's that? It's strong without being bitter.
Imagine my surprise when I discovered a second crime scene. It seems this young woman was strangled, her body dumped and turned up just two days ago. I'm surprised we haven't heard anything about it. We might have if not for the fact that this creek separates Idlewild from North Woodmere Park. It also represents the border between Queens and Nassau County.
There stood a tree on the steppe. A desolate, lonely tree. It spoke to me. What did the tree say? He led me there.
That's not true! He's a fucking preacher, for Christ's sake. He's a preacher, okay? It's his job to... Honestly, I don't know exactly what his job is, but it's not to go around judging.
We can't stop Myriade's signal, but we can hang onto it. We're lucky that this TV station is old. Not that old. Not ancient. But old enough that it still broadcasts in analog, not digital.
- We don't have time for that. Speech. - Jaha's backpack. - What about it? All right, it runs the A.I. And I'm pretty sure if we destroy it, we can destroy them with it. I know where it is.
Thanks for the encouragement. What did you want to show me? I designed a program to scan Drea's computer for spyware. What makes you think there's spyware there? She never accessed any social media accounts from her computer, so I thought she felt it wasn't safe.
The rain has stopped. I stop. At the corner, a boy in a yellow raincoat holding his mother's hand. We should get as far away from the bus as possible. He's not going to catch fire, is he?
I stop. At the corner, a boy in a yellow raincoat holding his mother's hand. We should get as far away from the bus as possible. He's not going to catch fire, is he? - He might explode like a fireball.
- No, I don't have it with me. - Would you like to use mine? - If you don't mind, I would. What's going to happen to this bus? It will be towed back to the bus depot.
And thank you, my beloved. You look exhausted. And you came a little late. Was your day okay? Yes, it was, until I broke down.
We'll get there. We should know in about 15 minutes. - You got the tranquilizer? - Right here. Yeah, but it takes about five minutes to kick in.
- You said you felt it. - Yes. It's there. We just have to keep looking. Ramse... even if this place exists, it could be anywhere in the world, and we have no maps or reports from after the plague.
- Yes, sir. - Right away, sir. Were those gunshots? What are you doing? This new route to Titan, does it include the machine?
You call yourselves "Bleeders"? Kill all who pass? You eat them, too, huh? We are on our way to a place about 50 km west of here. It's called Titan.
We are on our way to a place about 50 km west of here. It's called Titan. Do you know what I'm talking about? - Is it like that? - I don't know what it's called, but there's a place with lights and sounds.
It's him. According to the coordinates, Titan should be right here. I told you, it's not there. The tracker you used was connected to the transponder on the Humvee that burned out. It sent you in the wrong direction.
How do you know? I've got a built-in satellite, Wi-Fi, and AM/FM radio. It broadcasts on EVERY channel, bro. Soon I'll begin scanning and cataloging every species on the planet. I'm creating a precise database like this for future - generations. Doesn't sound so bad. Once that's done, I shrink the planet down to a more efficient data size. It is preserved in a jar. And henceforth safely stored in my archive until the end of time.
Uh, if the captain knew you were lying, then.... Then I don't know, but I'm afraid to find out. Afraid, huh? Hal, you're not afraid of anything. Your energy ring. Where is it?
Hal, you are not afraid of anything. Your energy ring. Where is it? The green ring? The captain took it when I came aboard as a courtesy payment. He put it in his trunk.
I have completed the cataloging of the earth. I'm ready to shrink. And we have a surprise for you, Brainiac: the shrink ray 2.0. You'll find that it's more advanced than...
-Why? Because it's indiscreet. -And I don't have the post yet. -What about the tree? It takes away all the light.
I had taken the decisive stroke. But then I made a wrong brush stroke and it slipped away again. I was talking to Jock about your 80th birthday. Don't remind me. Because it coincides with the day of the opening of Parliament, it was decided to celebrate both together and to hold a reception in your honor at the palace.
Are you referring to any specific work? I was thinking of the goldfish pond here in Chartwell. The pond, why the pond? It's just a pond. It's much more than that.
Over 20 times. Yes, because it's a technical challenge. -He eludes me. -Maybe you elude yourself. Which is why it reveals more than a self-portrait.
My Sleep Number bed is stuck in nap mode. Calm down. That's exactly why I bought a new generator. Which, you're welcome, just kicked in. Of course, it doesn't power everything.
Yes, but we said he needed a place that was secluded to hold his victims while he tortured them, and this place was definitely not that. What if we were looking for a team, with a dominant to our submissive? Esposito, he said that matadors have assistants, people who weaken the bull before the death blow. Yes, but we were right about the profile. We were right about the stress factor, he led us to Simon.
- I can't speak to that. Protecting the country is big business now, and it's going to get bigger. Don't you start too! Saul. He has his reason for not having a second 9/11. - It's called vigilance.
- For starters. And anything else you can think of after that. Okay. First of all, I don't think failure to appear for a court date is grounds.... The case is dead, Donald. It's been dismissed. Have mercy.
What's the good news? Your friend Alma called. How did the case get reopened in State Court? The case was dead, I saw it. - And yet it's alive.
What are we going to do? Mom will be home any minute. "Hola, Papi. Have you seen my computer?" "Sure, Mom. It's over there where the naked girl is entertaining her school's basketball team."
She and my dad patched it back up, but I don't know either. I guess I kept him at a distance a little bit. And then when he wrote the book, it was like he was just thinking about himself again. Speaking of people who think they're going to get away with something, look at the seat. Notice how close it is to the pedals.
Let me think... The Borns Tech case, maybe? - No, it wasn't. Wait a minute... He fell on the nominating committee.
I hereby declare this case "complex". We are proceeding according to the conventional rules of evidence investigation. What does that mean? - "Complex Case Procedures," has been in existence since 1996. When a case is deemed too complex for a lay jury, it is referred to a "Complex Litigation Manager," and I happen to be one of those.
So what are you going to do with that finger? Chief. So you have zombie radar. That explains a lot. Of course, you don't just wander the streets waiting for him to... go off.
# Will I go on a great adventure # - # Well... # # - # With my closest, best friend? # Not quite. # When will that day come? # # It will never come, will it? #
Major came home one day with a dog, didn't he? A dog that, as you later learned, belonged to one of the victims. I... There was a dog, yes. But it was returned to its owner.
But it was returned to its owner. - I think. I mean, I wasn't there, I don't have any.... They were asking me about the dog. You wanted to make sure he was in a good home, right?
Did the two cross paths? Yes, I think so. The cap must have come from Camp Russell. The old rifle range at Quantico? Isn't it closed?
- It happens all the time. Some judge orders the release of an inmate because of overcrowding. And Meeks must have slipped through somehow. Sulzbach could have discovered it; he had access to Meeks' files. According to Sulzbach's cell phone records, his last call was to the corrections department psychologist. - It lasted five seconds.
That is not true. You survived. You built the place. The place in your head where monsters can't go. But that place never went away. It was still there for you when you needed it.
There is the moment when you realize that you love a woman and the moment when you realize that you are going to marry her. I want to hear about the second one. It was late last year. I was coming home late from a case. It was bad.
- I am not interested in that. What interests me is this case. You won't get two years for it. - I don't want that at all. Listen, this case either moves forward or it stops.
This is not possible. - But it is. You're holding it in your hand. Tell me about the movie you saw. It was like a newsreel.
I can't stand that. So I did her this little favor. Finally. Are you happy? But it looked good on me.
A treaty with the Middle East during a war? That's great, honey. Kip, eat your food. I don't think the war is right. Well, no matter what you think, it's gonna happen.
But I couldn't. I was in a coma. Then you don't think the war was right? I never thought about it. It made us rich.
That's probably why the movie sucks so much. We're talking about "Totally (un)Frozen" and yet you're burnt out. Miss, I'm so sorry! How can you not like the movie? I think it gets more credit than it really deserves.
Maybe Dunning had an enemy following him. And he, in a building full of heavily armed bikers, shot him twice in the face? I do assume there would be better times and places to take the man down. - Did the runner show up? - No, he didn't.
Do you think someone else has it? After you went to sleep last night, Marcus informed me that the missing carpet was found. The one from the video? The police tracked it from the gang's dumpster to a landfill. He was soiled just like the bikers said.
The one from the video? The police tracked him from the gang's dumpster to a landfill. He was defiled just as the bikers said. And? So he wasn't defiled in the video that was posted.
Unfortunately, the GPS on his cell phone was turned off. We still don't know what he was doing in the neighborhood. What about phone calls? The last call came in around 5:30 p.m. to a law firm in Midtown. It only lasted a minute.
We sell him the superconductor project. We need his money for it. We want him to think that everything depends on him. The price is no longer 100. It's now 400.
-We are all sitting together now. Thullander Industrie is our only company focused on solar cells. Energreen's strength is wind power. Thullander develops solar panels. It's nonsense to divest a well-performing business because it doesn't fit an arbitrarily chosen profile.
-Yes. She published the article anyway. So what was that about? She must have posted it beforehand. The text is already going through all the media. Soon it will be known abroad as well.
You know firsthand that breakups can be pretty tough. Nice. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I know how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides us with information from the environment that, oha, tells us that such behavior is not good for us.
Please, let's move on. - Don't be so narrow-minded. Does the state of Israel have a right to exist? That is absurd. It already exists, after all.
I'm sure you understand. How do you come to demand such a large amount with such short notice? I beg you: go now. You are still disappointed that you did not participate in the IPO. Yet it was done, and with a fantastic result.
By the time he realized the magnitude of it all, he was also immediately arrested for double murder, of his brother and father, since the gun was registered in his name. And how do you know Clyde? He was my cellmate. This place has made him crazy. He thinks he's cursed.
Is she all right? If you say you need to see him, you need to see him. I'll have RT come by. Boy, you all know you can't jump. I traced the last envelope to the post office in the town it was sent from.
I'll have RT come by. Boy, you all know you can't jump. I traced the last envelope to the post office in the city it was sent from. There is no indication on the security camera footage that anyone dropped it off at the post office itself. It was probably dropped into one of the mailboxes nearby.
I can call him whatever I want? All right, I'll tell you what. If I pull over, the first thing that comes to your mind is the name for the store. Really? It's coming up right here on the right.
It comes right here on the right side. Just keep looking down the road. I don't have a key yet, so we can't go in yet. I just bought the place. It's in need of a little renovation, but we'll get it done.
Yes, Dr. Witlin is my oncologist. How bad is it? I'm afraid it's a bird. With cancer it's either like a tortoise, a hare or a bird. A tortoise is easy to catch, a hare is easy to chase, but a bird, once it's flown away....
Where's she buried, man? In the storeroom of my crab restaurant in Inglewood. The Crab Grab. I remember that place. - It's closed now.
- No one else has access? - No. We're a small store. I have nothing to do with it. I can hardly turn on a PC without it crashing.
Is there a hand release somewhere? I don't know. What is it? A lever. It should be above the car on a rail.
Long story short... It's like a round of "Hot Potato." You have to keep passing it around. If you don't, you die. Melissa, this curse started with you. And I think it wants to end with you.
That's what they all want. Hundreds of heartbroken women come to me, but they never learn. I mean, a month, a year, no matter how long, they all come back... same story, different man. So you tweaked the curse? Now it punishes not only the cheaters, but the stupid women who want them back.
Hey. That vacation beard is really taking shape, Dad. He's already catching food.
Hey. That vacation beard is really taking shape, Dad. He's already catching food. Yes. He's gone from itchy to horny.
But I can think of a few ladies I would like to reproduce with after our elders give us the blessing. - My sentiments exactly. - We love girls! While you're here, I need an outsider's opinion. I'm working on a song, but these guys think it's too mellow.
Staying here for a few days might help me get over this illness faster. - There you go. - Wait a minute. I thought I already packed my laptop. Why is it on the table in the hallway?
We were hoping you could explain how it got there. We recorded that a couple of months ago. I think it will help explain what Gus is. You named your killer robot Gus? He wasn't designed to kill.
We recorded this a few months ago. I think it will help explain what Gus is. You named your killer robot Gus? He wasn't designed to kill. He was supposed to carry material for the infantry, like a pack mule.
And for me... and for me she was the woman, you know? And she died. Well, I thought she died. And I wasn't myself anymore. Yeah, the pain was... it was very intense, so I started to self-medicate, and then my work started to suffer, and I made these little mistakes.
The husband also passed away, she lived alone. Not completely alone. Shih Tzu, if I'm not mistaken. There was a dog here. It says he was taken away.
I said her name. I forgot. It's ok. Garcia, were you able to track him? I was this close. But I got the cell tower he pinged off of.
I mean, this is highly theoretical magic. It's never been used before, but it sounds like it could work. Do you have the ingredients? All but one. That's why it's never been used before.
- Your suggestion was new to me. - I didn't ask about that. How long did you know the answer? For example, I was thinking, hey, the transfer spell worked on Ric's babies. Maybe it will work on the scar.
You have to understand that Dad... He's in a free fall, a crisis, because of the ranch. And did you just call yourself a beaver? This totem pole thing. And the base of the totem pole, by the way, is the most important. It holds the pole up.
Yeah. All I really want is just to be here, right here, with you. But if all of that is, you know, too much.... I, I, um, I totally understand. I, um, I brought this record player from home especially, and it's really heavy, and that's one of my favorite songs.
This is it... look at the date on the back. And Lorelai... That virus protection I mentioned. Do you want me to install it? -Where is it?
-What? -Oh, God. -What? -I swallowed a bug. It got stuck.
Nice to meet you. I miss Doyle. Calm down. I miss the sex. He was Vulcan.
It was so boring in the room. And nothing good on TV. -The curtains smell funny. -I'm afraid of my backpack. At night it comes alive and kills me.
And come back quickly. -Finn, isn't that a guy? -Just until next Tuesday. How's the foot? -I don't think it's broken.
Now I'm talking! You should be ashamed of yourself. -Look at this screwed-up sexpot. -Thank you. You've turned her into a sighing, broken bundle who won't let anyone into your parking lot, even though it's at the back door, and other people's isn't.
Wait! What? No. What? We work and build Stars Hollow We work and build Stars Hollow This redwood tree grows so high It meets God in heaven
You didn't talk to Avery before? This is about Brody Nelson versus the United States. Avery is the U.S. Oddly, Riley has a second mail account that she has logged into daily for the past two months. - But it's empty. - Are there deleted mails? I'll run a recovery program.
Alessandra, yes. Come, come! Thank you. Thank you. I wanted to show you this place because it means a lot to me.
Each member gets their own key. My staff and I have a copy of the second key with us at all times. One of us is always here within 30 minutes. We are never all together in the same place. That way, the bunker is always safe until it's needed.
I bet you don't even have a generator. What is it? The fuse plate is new. The paint's been painted over. Somebody pushed the door open, and the concrete here is damaged. It's been scrubbed.
I think he's in North America. Sasha Antonov. I have never heard that name before. The name Antonov has a high price. He forced me and my children to live always hidden, with Katia, Alexei, all their lives.
We're going there now, and we're getting down to business. Easy, Hannibal. We could leak your plan to Politico. - Backfire. - But then it would be public.
J... no. God, Norma. No, I just told you we'd get the tree. Oh, right. Did you know Norman had this letter? It's meant for Emma.
No, I just told you we'd get the tree. Oh, right. Did you know Norman had this letter? It's meant for Emma. It's from her mom... and I found it here the other day.
How about smiling? Do you do that? But it wasn't the whore's burgundy corset that gave me pause, nor the juicy bush between her legs. No, the fact that she had a dick. A real cock, as perky as that of a pretty puppy. But it didn't wag, so I was up for it.
- I guess he couldn't. - No. It had to be an Earp. If I bury the talisman in the pet cemetery, - Mom and Dad wouldn't fight! - Come on, girl! It's here, next to Hamster Picachu's final resting place.
Dr. Jackson Avery? - That's right. We know... - It's delivered. You guys have a good night. What's the next move? Do you take your best shot and see where it lands?
Yes, Mrs. Park? This ring belonged to my mother-in-law. I was saving it for Joon's wife. Shall we make it official? It's so beautiful.
This ring belonged to my mother-in-law. I was saving it for Joon's wife. Shall we make it official? It's so beautiful. Do you like it?
Come back to me. Concentrate on... bubbles. One... two... go. Do you have any more gum, grandma? Mine's gone. Oh, I know where it is.
Then give me the clue! Of all the chances I gave you, there is still one left. - How will you use it? - I don't have it. - What? - All I know is that it's still there, somewhere in the Triangle.
Stop it! You stop it! The glue is good. Thank you. He's incredible!
It is not strong enough. - Yes, she is! She won't let him die. You promised me you could do this. Valerie, stop this right now. He's too strong for you. He'll kill you.
So, it could be a robot, with tires. And it could come all around the house.
Is this the contract? What does it look like? Is everything okay? Actually, there are a few inconsistencies. Like what? For example, it doesn't specifically include the name of the restaurant also the location is unclear.
Enough to save a little pride. You were proud to cheat? Just talk to Trevor. He'll tell you. I've been complaining about this heist since it happened.
- There. Still there. - What is still there? Proof. That the robbery didn't happen to fund an as-yet unidentified scheme. It was done to conceal an as yet unidentified scheme.
And God bless you. The letter is for Mr. Grant. As you can see, the seal is unbroken. No, it's not for you. It's for Mr. Grant.
- Thank you. - Give my regards to Emily. - I will. - The contract looks good to me. - It looks really good. It is in my own font, Shelvetica.
You're just uncomfortable because I ambushed you with the topic of cancer. Anyway, I gave 5 stars to every doctor, every nurse, every halfway good consultant. Thank you very much, too. The cancer didn't give a shit. It just kept growing.
I want you to tell me the truth. Does Missy Dietler know you couldn't hold your mud? Heavens no. The Turkish mud was thick enough that she couldn't feel it, so.... Was it thick enough to hide the fact that you were going to sleep afterwards?
One for perishable goods. The other for smoking and maturing the meat. It's totally useless. Dude, our store is called Thirio, okay, that means "beast." If it were called Mussel, no issue, but it's not.
Then comes the nose. That's wine jargon. You smell it. What does the wine tell you? It's better than mine.
As hard as it is to believe, Maura could be wrong. She's not wrong. Alice went to Canada in an attempt to fool us. She snuck back and tried to surprise us. It's all part of her plan, and it failed.
Kent, are you trying to say that the test was inconclusive? Maybe a little bit too conclusive. What does that even mean? Well, it means our test did not yield one DNA profile from the victim's body. It yielded five.
Okay, yes. I needed the audio/vis... whatever. After all that, I feel like I owe you a drink. My flight leaves in an hour, so.... What if it leaves in two?
Most of these logins look like from warehouse supervisors, but this one is anonymous. That's how our crooks got the code. Is there a way to trace this login? Yes, but it could take more time than we have. Okay, we know when they got the code, so we're just looking for each time it was used in the future.
Hey, Korsak, take a look at this. Do you see the insulation? Does this fan look bigger than the others? Yes. It's magnetic.
Well, I have a change of clothes in my office if you want to dig in a fresh shirt. At this point, that would be a public service. This ring belonged to Donna. What kind of stone is it? It's too pale to be a sapphire or blue topaz.
So Michael and Edward were both targets. Well, Edward was a little luckier than Michael. Take the buckshot down to the crime lab. Maybe we can get fingerprints or DNA off it, - if it was handloaded.
It looks like he was sober for 20 years. It also looks like he was old fashioned with his contacts. There's probably a number for Mary in there. Okay, I'll make the call. No, it should come from me. Okay.
Sorry. Since you're here. I've been thinking about it, and.... I'd like to have a job. And if it's not an inconvenience, it should preferably be in front of as many people as possible.
Look, right there! Turn it back 5% and our plan will be perfect! It's a happy day. - Yeah? So what's your story, sweetie? For starters, my coat may look cute, but it's too thin for the weather.
People love fairy tales. Beautiful. Oh, one more thing... Don't take this ring off, because that would be very painful... for your children. It's very pretty. Thank you.
Start the truck. Start the truck! Start the damn truck! What do you think I'm trying to do? It won't start!
- Still came out at the right time. The books are safe, at least for now. What's wrong with Eve? She had a fight with Bonaparte and got hurt. She has a pulse, but it's weak.
- What? - A full-grown magic beast? I've never seen anything like it before. We used the staff to heal them. What do you mean? It didn't work?
- A full-grown magic beast? I have never seen anything like it before. We used the staff to heal them. What do you mean? It didn't work? Well, we thought it would, and then she surged and had some kind of seizure.
What the hell was that? They're in. Everyone in the tunnel. - Tunnel? What tunnel? - But we don't know where it leads.
I don't want a coffee shop, Diane. You're not listening to me. I don't think a coffee shop would work either. This block is a graveyard for small businesses. It's perfect for a gallery.
- Yes. - Yes. There's something wrong. - No, no! - What, what? - What happened? - No, we followed the river, it was supposed to accompany us all the way to Caraquet.
- It's time to find the emergency switch. - We are at the 4th station, it must be over there. You have to look for a red door. If we don't turn the emergency switch, then the generator won't be able to absorb the ants' energy. No one said it was locked.
Should I be concerned that you know how to build an electric chair? Right now, you should be grateful. We're gonna fry that little son of a bitch. - Let's bust him before... - Before he blows me up.
And my name is Seeley Booth, and I'm a Special Agent in Homicide with the FBI. When I'm called to the scene of a crime where the remains are badly burned or decomposed, I call in Bones. He calls me "Bones." Even though I am his wife and the mother of two of his children, he still calls me by a nickname I despise. You used to despise it, but now I think you like it.
Dr. Saroyan takes himself pretty seriously. Look, all dead bodies smell, okay? But bodies found in a landfill and covered in leachate, which is basically a viscous dirty water, tend to smell worse. When I first started, I had to dab peppermint oil under my nose to mask the smell. I tried growing a mustache, thinking it would block the smell. It just made me look like a creep with that ever-present stench of death in my nostrils.
The frame of the club was too narrow to have caused these injuries. There is a fracture on the distal shaft of the fourth metacarpal. A boxer's fracture. The victim must have struck his killer. If the punch was delivered with enough force to break the victim's hand, it might have been strong enough to injure our killer.
It's pretty, but I don't know that much about diamonds. Lance gave me his mom's ring, so we never had to pick anything out. I want to show you this. You can put a serial number on a diamond? Yes, and if it's that big, you better.
Yes, we can etch microscopic marks, which gives our customers the greatest possible security. What about the diamond we found? Who does it belong to? I remember this particular diamond quite well, I marked it personally. He's a part of it.
Today's rich are no different than kings and queens once were. They like expensive, fancy things that no one else can have. No, I meant specifically this dagger, whose is it? Well, that's a different twist. It was loaned to a jewelry store for an exhibition called "Crown Jewels of the World," but jewel thieves stole it three days ago, the day it arrived.
No, I meant specifically this dagger, whose is it? Well, that's a different twist. It was loaned to a jewelry store for an exhibit called "Crown Jewels of the World," but jewel thieves stole it three days ago, the day it arrived. Oh, that's genius. I mean, it's not awesome that it was stolen.
Aubrey asked me to look at Chadwick Grey, the guy from the Gem Society who puts the microscopic codes on the diamonds. - So? before he worked at the Gem Society, he sold jewelry at the store the Marquise robbed first. We looked at you, Mr. Grey, you used to sell jewelry, and the last store you worked in was robbed by thieves targeting historical imitation jewelry. That robbery awakened in me a desire to protect such pieces. It brought me to the Gem Society.
I looked under the table. The glasses were knocked over because the table was moved. By a very strong mind. Hodgins, would you shut up and listen to me? Your foot is two inches off the floor when it's resting in the footrest of your wheelchair.
They are not good Samaritans. Roman's men. Coming to finish what they started. My belt is stuck! It won't open!
The plan was good when Andrew Barnes was alive, but maybe we can get his successor to return to the old plan. Get information on the others. Thank you Jason. The new plan is sustainable and has green space. It includes everything that is required. - And we are making good money.
It's not, but we have to take it. Andrew Barnes was murdered. He was against the original plan. Murdered? If it were approved now, it will lead to unnecessary questions from the public.
We have to prevent that. I'm afraid there's only one way to do that. I don't know what that was for, but I'm done. - Excellent, Jax. - What's going on? I'm putting us on a collision course with the torpedo. With any luck, it'll hit us just outside New York City.
The system you live in is sick. Why do more and more girls come to me and want to join the caliphate? Because they are young and impressionable. Because you turn your back on the brainwashing of the West and endless consumption. You can fill the sand of a desert into a bucket, but if it has no bottom, it will remain empty.
He just called. It turns out the job wasn't clean. There's something bigger going on, something bad enough that he told me to run code 44. What does Code 44 mean? It means to drop everything and everyone.
You lying little bastard. What makes you think he's lying about being alone? Look at his neck. See that tiny hickey? It's fresh.
What were you doing there when Hayley and Marcus broke in? I was bait for that idiot Ned. The computer system requires two separate security keys. You can't just hack in and upload a worm. It had to be injected while a security portal was open.
Don't be. You are the person who helped me through everything. You know how? Our plan. It kept me going for six years, gave me the will to escape.
Like Internet contracts. You click "agree" to move on. Did you sign the contract? Yes, I did. Then it is valid.
I remembered something else about Nordkoster. When Wendt wanted to borrow my phone, he had a suitcase with him. - He just left it there. - Strange. - When I opened it, it was empty.
Can I try? Sheriff? Matt and Emmy just called in. They said they saw a fog rolling in near Jasper Hills. - Did they say where it was headed?
Before bursting in, I was just checking for hex bags, or a.... Dem. What do you want? I'm working on a spell. It requires a second.
The end times shouldn't worry you, though, Row. You're a rat. Find your way out of any sinking ship. Damn right. The spell I'm working on is Book of the Damned magic, and it can bring us back.
- Well, Rowena said that it would. Yes. It's a Book of Damned spells, guys. Take this tiny crystal. It'll suck up all the cursed spirits.
Junior, is this part of the tour? What's the problem, speak? (ENGINE STOPS) Oh, the bus. It won't start anymore.
I'd be offended if you didn't. (SIGHS) Well, monsieur... Ah, what is the meaning of a name? It is nothing but a word our mother sews into our underwear when we go to school sports, non?
I think he's avoiding me. Really? What's your secret? I'd better go to Barb's. I'll let the dog touch my leg, maybe he'll stop.
How do you know what it is? Because I grow cabbage in the garden. We can smoke a salad together in the bar. Your trailer is as good as new. It's even better than new.
There's an alligator down here! Did he say "alligator"? Okay, okay! Now I found a way out! There's an exit! It's a few feet behind you, but you'll have to dig your way out.
You want to know more about me? Good. My mom came to the U.S. in 1980. She met your dad, got pregnant. For a few years he pulled himself together, we were a family, then, out of the blue, he took apart our TV, he said he was sending messages that could hurt us.
- Yes. One night... I parked in front of Marissa's apartment. And I saw this guy leaving. He was wearing a Baja sweater. It was patterned white and green, and he had the hood up, so I couldn't see his face.
Are you okay, Aidan? Yeah, I'm fine. Six more plates going out. Come on, VIP table. I have a manzanilla sherry from Spain for you. It goes heavenly with the grilled feta in front of you.
They were going to get a divorce. Did you know that? - No. - Because of the beach case. Mom says that Dad was obsessed with it. He wanted to solve the case. It was a special case. Special in what way?
Consisted mainly of bleach and potassium chloride. The Bensonhurst Bomber's personal recipe. I can still smell the chloride. It was hidden inside a soccer. The victim, Tom O'Leary, picked it up and it exploded in his hands.
Good thing you didn't take off. Where did you get that? Must have happened when I fell after my grandpa hit me. This fabrication room is really cool. Can he make clothes from any era?
But there is history out there and no one knows more about that than I do. But we've managed just fine without you. For the most part. Your suit looks bulky. Actually, it fits me perfectly. It's made of a custom alloy and it's pretty battle-tested.
He is a thief and a murderer. And one of the Legends. Mick's been on the ship since we brought your team to the JSA. He told me before he died that his killer was a time traveler. We're tracking someone who wants to change history. He may have given Krieger the serum.
- And neither do you. - Great. That's why you're going to keep what follows a secret. Even from your team. The Atom suit is made of a dwarf-star alloy. It can withstand bullets, arrows and explosives.
- Great. That's why you'll keep the following a secret. Even from your team. The Atom suit is made of a dwarf star alloy. It can withstand bullets, arrows and explosives. - It is impenetrable?
This is a godsend. We know how the rebels plan to take Champion Hill, and when they do, we'll be there to give them hell. Send our cannon squad to the western ridge. - What's your name, boy? - It's yes...
Hey, listen. Don't worry about him, okay? There's only one Harry. And I wanted to tell you something else. The molecular accelerator, it didn't work.
I saw a transformer explode when this thing went by it. - That's strange. - What's strange about it? The monster didn't even touch it. It exploded before it reached it.
You wouldn't believe how surprised and delighted we were when we found out that you were one of those... what was the term the council member used? - Favoritism capitalist? - Right. That you were one of those favoritism capitalists who were kicking poor people out of this neighborhood, hidden behind a shell company, of course. The same company that has significant interest in a real estate development that just applied for permission to redevelop Orchid Bay for commercial use. Their opposition to this rezoning is not political. It is personal.
Thank you all so much for coming. My favorite Christmas movie is "Die Hard." It's true. My second favorite Christmas movie is "Isn't Life Beautiful", and I was really lucky to be able to watch that movie again last week. It reminded me how much work I have left to do, how much work we all have left to do, and it inspired me to commit to making our city, our home a better and safer place.
It's an online survey that asks subjects to make statements, on a scale from "Strongly Agree" to "Strongly Disagree." "Killing to protect a loved one is understandable, even if it is premeditated." "Taking pleasure in torture is worse than murder." - I think this test would be torture. - It's a little macabre.
She said you were pretty cryptic about the reasons you were there. Nothing inappropriate. I was just looking for something I lost track of. Years ago, I brought an antique ring here from London. It was intended as a gift for the Countess of Morcar.
I'm doing the test because you said Arthur Tetch did it. I listen to snappy music because taking this test is like eating drain hair. I came across this song and the lyrics seem to fit for reasons that will become apparent. I assume you learned something when you were with your father. As part of our effort to find out who benefited from the Colombian oil deal, we looked again at the financial records of the day it was announced.
Johnny stole beer from a Russian store and we rode the Ferris wheel drunk until we got sick. - That doesn't sound very smart. - It wasn't. Jesus. At the game, Johnny figured out that all you have to do is spin the ball the right way so it hits the back rim and goes in the basket.
You have to focus all your energy. We'll call when the baby comes. No, I want to stay and help. The pain is not stronger than you. It is a part of you.
She would have wanted it to be yours. I will always carry it with me. Thank you. Do you have any idea what this peace means? It means our homes are gone. All of them. Forever.
And stove. There are less than 20 minutes... until the signing of this historic treaty. I've learned that the king has given the order to go into action. I'll take care of the city. The mission is set and it won't be easy.
Excuse me. Where's the bus to Sacramento? There's no bus here. Are you sure? Where's it leaving from?
And I will. I am a very patient man. And I'm right, which makes me even more patient because she's overreacting. I know it and she knows it, though she can't admit it yet. So I wait for her to apologize and then haul my ass back to our bedroom where it belongs.
I'm starving, too. No, I'm ready to get married. I proposed twice and you still haven't answered me. I bought a ring. You told me to keep it, so it's just gathering dust in a drawer.
Come on. You've had a gynecological exam before, right? Yeah, some, some, but it doesn't feel right. Don't tell me it doesn't feel right. It's my damn cervix. Just see how wide open it is
- There's an ambulance on the way! - Ben! Ben! Even if they were here now, they can't help me. - They can. - He's coming.
Yes, yes, you are right. We should have delivered something to this address two days ago. Should have? George's truck, the guy who drives this route, disappeared that night. Was it stolen?
Welcome to the family. So, did you enjoy the show this morning, Ashley? I'm really sorry about... Don't be sorry. You had a sneak preview of the world's most massive cock. It's perfect, is it?
Your oven works? No one here has that much electricity. The ARQ supplies the electricity. When the stove comes on, pull the pin and throw the canister down the shaft. It supplies the whole house.
Cheap Bargains. You're fundraising for your tech exhibit project right now? Especially right now. My anaerobic converter doesn't need electricity. It runs on old-fashioned compost.
When a starved body cannot process a surplus of new food. The body shuts down... even dies. For centuries our people have starved for wealth and opportunity. You can't open a buffet and expect a starving person to make intelligent choices. You always have to feed the starving body a little bit to get it back to health.
But you don't want to check it? I do, but I don't want to invest in the code. This is about you, okay? - Even if the code doesn't run... - It runs. I'm sure it does.
- Hello. Ove Gardman. - Hello. The murders on Nordkoster and of Nils Wendt are now part of the same investigation. There was an earring in the coat from the beach. - What did it look like?
So Wendt believed that Linn was involved? - Could she have been? - We'll never know for sure. Why don't we take a look at this? The letter is signed Adelita. It was sent seven days after the murder.
Then we move on. This letter was sent from Sweden to Dan Nilsson in Costa Rica. Dan Nilsson was Wendt's alias. Did you know that? No, of course I didn't. I thought he was dead. It's written in Spanish: "Dan, I don't think we're right for each other."
No, of course not. I thought he was dead. It's written in Spanish: "Dan, I don't think we're right for each other." "I can start a new life now. I'm not coming back. Adelita." Uh-huh? It was sent only a week after she drowned in Hasslebay.
Are they ready for such a review? It would not be beneficial, but we would weather the storm. - What else? - The name "Wayne" still has meaning. It is a symbol of light and hope.
I was insensitive and rude. - Does Alfred know you have his car? - No. Why tell him? It's mine, not his.
Let's talk about that tantalizing little word "should." It's uncharted territory. I can't promise that the magic will last forever. There is no known magic for it. But it will last.
I like the fifth pentagram of Mars'. It has more character. Because character is so really important right now. Sam... this is awkward, I get that. But the demon... I think it's in your mom.
Make something to eat. I'm not your cook. Our agents in the Pacific states have access to classified information. They found the Resistance vehicle. The Kempeitai believe it came from the man's hideout in the high castle.
Oh, where's the double-heart platinum ring you just showed me? Oh, it's... Hm, it was here, wasn't it? - Oh. Did I put it away when I took out the sapphire? Oh, here it is... It was under this box. What about the champagne?
- You could say that. - Good afternoon. - How do you do? The Tower of Vortigern... It sealed Merlin's fate with Pendragon.
Come here. This guy was killed over a lot of dough? We need to comb the place. I'll call forensics. We found your tree. We were in the woods, it was there.
Kilian, do you think the white dragon could be a woman? I don't. This is an important question I'm asking you. Close your eyes, concentrate, and imagine the white dragon. Is he a man or a woman?
-Should I show you the combination, too? -Hey. -Why is this body always tired? "This body"? Well, maybe because it works at night?
Shit, that's all I mean by that. Can we just... - What? Your ankle? - Yeah, just a second. - Babe... - It's just a little sore.
- Babe... - It just hurts a little. You need to see a doctor. I'll get you an appointment. He's getting better.
- It just hurts a little. You need to see a doctor. I'll get you an appointment. He'll get better. It just hurts.
An online marketplace. That's where I sometimes find my jobs. You do this in public? Yes, but not from my computer. It could be stolen. By a thief, like you.
Thank you for the day. You're welcome. What if I took him forever? No, you can't afford that. If there was a price, what would it be?
This case. This case, it was just... It got under my skin. And I forgot! My job is to protect the innocent as much as it is to punish the guilty. We can't do the job without it getting under our skin.
It's the it's the Tesla. - Open it! Open it! It opens automatically as you approach. He knows it somehow. And how does he know to open the trunk?
I saw him somewhere. Excuse us. According to toxicology, the cake was clean. You also write, "Thank you, it was delicious."
You don't feel anything physically. But I do! - Cooper, you need to calm down. - I felt it, okay? I felt her arm, and it was warm. And I felt her poking me in the shoulder.
All right. I would just like to know about the strike. You know I can't talk about it. - Yeah, but I... It won't last much longer, will it?
Thank you, Pacho. - We are safe. - Give me the ball. - Please. - There it is.
- Oh, yeah? Boring as hell. It was like being trapped in a Victorian women's novel. For me, it was like being in a phone booth with a panicked gorilla. He was trying to kill me.
Yes, Miss Grant. Does this salad dressing look like it's drizzled on? - Yes. - No. No, this salad is drowning. It's floating in a lake of salad dressing like little Kate Winslets in Titanic.
But tomorrow he'll shit on you and throw you away like a used rubber. Why didn't you kill him already? Because that would have meant war again. Everybody against everybody. And in the end someone from Piscinola, from Ponticelli from Naples center would have shown up here. And would have taken over everything. Your place is where it always was. At my side.
SWITZERLAND It is very pleasant to arrive in Zurich - the train station is beautiful, the surrounding area is very nice - in fact, everything is lovely. But it is also the richest city in the world, rated as the city with the highest quality of life in the world. Everything is so neat and efficient, the people are so polite and courteous, and the buildings are beautiful. This place is rich, and it has obviously been rich for centuries.
And I will not leave my friends behind. You should know that. Yes, I do. The chopper should probably be down by the cockpit. It'll be patched into the communication line.
But we are too close to the standard airlines. It would be different if we had an EMP. I could create an EMP. So now you want to kill those pilots? The electromagnetic pulse won't kill them, it will just cripple their planes.
The police are there, but we don't know if they have them under control, we don't know where to go. If the gorilla makes it out, he'll slaughter all those people, including us. - The fire square. - We don't have a square here. With the fire square, we can send the elevator down to the lobby and it will take the gorilla with it.
Remission? - Dad... - Wait, remission from what? Cancer. - He had cancer. - Is it gone?
- Dad... - Wait, remission from what? Cancer. - He had cancer. - Is it gone? - He was gone, but he's back.
- He had cancer. - Is he gone? - He was gone, but he's back. - What? So he's not gone?
- Dad, I'm over here! - Markie. That's what happened to me. Are you okay? Yeah, I got too close to the ledge and it gave way. - Twisted my ankle.
Who shot Fred? Two men were under the bridge. One we pulled off the body, the other's still alive. They threw the damn dog off the bridge. Did he get out of the water?
Yes. Have I only made mistakes? Yes. Did it work? In a way, it did. I had a plan and I implemented it. And it was flawless.
- Have you been drinking? - Have you been drinking? Okay. This dog is extremely important. Because he is Lydia Spring.
Why didn't Rainey let us build another altar? Why did he cram us into a basement in an old zoo building? - To control us. - The altar is sacred. It's electric!
The prosecutor at the Special Court for State Security. To what end? I'd like to see your report. It's confidential. It belongs to the collective memory.
Please. If you lie to me again, I'm gone. And then I'll make sure the whole world knows why. Yes. I'll have a copy of the next article sent to your divorce attorney as soon as it's published.
I doubt Pinkie ever held a gun in his life. Maybe it's a Dick Cheney situation where one shot the other. If Pinkies are so inexperienced, why did Dan invite him? Dan needs an audience. You know what they say, if a bear craps in the woods and no one saw you shoot it, is it really dead?
-And again, -Listen. Traveler like us have been building and assembling components for it for over a year. To do what with it? An asteroid is on a collision course with Earth. It's called Helios 685, and it hasn't been discovered yet, but when it crashes into the Atlantic Ocean in 18 months, the tidal wave will wipe out most of the East Coast. This will cause environmental disasters, shortages, and wars from which we will not recover.
It's a hydrogen drive. You don't stand a chance, Justin. We just can't ever cross that red line. It's a closed system. If the water tank gets 100 degrees Celsius, it boils, builds up pressure, everything blows up.
I have absolutely no prejudices, really. I come from a planet more beautiful than you can imagine. We! We come from the planet. It was paradise.
I come from a planet more beautiful than you can imagine. We. We come from the planet. Shoot now, or he'll kill us both!
And none of you ask about the robot? Wait! Jesus, Ram! You meant what you said! That you don't care if he kills you.
Wait! Jesus, Ram! You meant what you said! That you don't care if he kills you. Which he didn't.
Jesus, Ram! You meant what you said! That you don't care if he kills you. Which he didn't. He left me to the rest of my stupid life, didn't he?
That you don't care if he kills you. Which he didn't. He left me to the rest of my stupid life, didn't he? Yes! Yes, he did!
My mom! What on earth is this mess? What's going on? I've talked to a few, no one remembers anything, and that's kind of convenient. The Lankin probably does. So he can come back- come back and continue to satiate himself. Yes!
And while I'm at it, I'll take a look at the zombie moat. The zombie moat seems to work well. Thank you. I followed your instructions exactly. It's a little thin on Zs.
Some of the refugees will not be turned away. I just saw two inside the fence. The natives are getting restless. We need the vaccine now. It should be ready in 48 hours.
We need the vaccine immediately. It should be ready in 48 hours. - And you will make a sufficient quantity? - As you instructed. 10,000 doses. But I need to test it before we give it to people. I don't know if it's safe.
Murphy had you under control. The bite on your neck. What? I gave you a dose of the original HZN1 vaccine. It counteracts his bite and frees us from Murphy's control.
014 must be protected. He wrote a hacker code that a faction wants in the future. What faction? A group that wants to use my code to overthrow the director. - I'll hide it here. It's useless.
What kind of faction? A group that wants to use my code to overthrow the director. - I'll hide it here. He's useless. - Not useless. - What good is he to you in the 21st?
I was at the end there. I had lost. Just didn't want to leave Bekir behind. It's strange to wish for death. That it's the only way out.
What am I supposed to do with these? No delivery! Anyway, we're still short of mangoes. This is the flight recorder from the Mega Gecko cockpit. It tells us about King Julien's last moments.
Your son! Yes, where is... Oh, my gosh, I forgot his name. Starts with "R"? No, I think it starts with an "L," honey.
Yes, where is... Oh my goodness, I've forgotten his name. Starts with "R"? No, I think it starts with "L", honey. Of course it does.
Not Rodney. Brodney. I'm sure it's "Rodney." It's... It's Brodney.
Look, King Julien, I designed myself. Red, white and with feet. Not bad, Mort. I'm glad to see the lemur spirit. Even if he is a little scary.
Relatively safe. Listen, the crazy tournament is important to Flora. If she really wants to go, let her. That would be the right thing to do. Grandma used to say, "Let the butterfly fly, and if it gets caught in the spider web, there will be lots of baby spiders in the spring."
- Then let him go! - Not yet! Ask me something else! Make me tell the truth! What is he? Is he alien?
He comes. - Hi! - Hi. - I like your movie. - Oh, thank you. It has to be one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life.
I'm just saying. I can do this. Just give me a moment... And here comes the mimosa. I once left orange juice in the fridge long enough that it tasted like mimosa.
They'll just give you ice and pain pills like last time. You'll feel terrible once I'm in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would easily fit in the trunk of this award-winning minivan. Fine, we'll go to the emergency room. Just stop selling me the van! You're right. It sells itself.
Six kids went to the bathroom and one didn't. You know what you need? Yes, that all 23 of them stick to my precisely worked out schedule. I was thinking about a kiss. It would give me less time to brush, but it would stop my whining.
If you want more details, then you can go suck a dick. Wait here. Do you remember the movie? I loved it when I was a teenager. It's not really scary, but it's bloody.
You seem to be a talented young woman. And can I recognize talent? You bet you can! I'm going to recite a monologue for you. It's from the play...
Her style changed throughout her life. In her darkest days, she experimented with impasto techniques to add texture to the canvas. In her late 20s, she was diagnosed with... - How's your neck doing? - Well, it's feeling a little lonely.
So I can lead you to the front of the parade where you belong.... on your float. Float? Patrick, build her the float. I'll build you the float of your dreams. Okay, but make sure it's a show wagon.
Enough with the video! No, listen. I have an idea for a song. It's gonna go viral. It's called "Where My Baes At?"
- Only I was able to do that. - How? She uploaded a statement pretending to save Marcy. How? When she saw my code, it was sent as visual information, via the quantum bridge that occurs during consciousness transfer.
The director had teams working on central elements for months. The first components arrived the day I arrived. - This is a quantum frame. - Exactly. Should the Director need to flee the faction, he can send himself here to the 21st.
Nothing gets through within a 90-meter radius. No electronics, no GPS, no telemetry of the 21st century or the future. - The group can't find us? - Neither can the director. He can't send a messenger or a consciousness or himself.
- The group can't find us? - Neither can the director. He can't send a messenger or an awareness or himself. Once the Director is online, we'll be safe and can shut down the shield. Then he can travel to the 21st or stay where he is.
Is Japan on the line? Good. Yes, I'll hold. I didn't expect to spend the day like this. Is it over already?
- Why shouldn't I do that? Here is a letter for you. I found it among Miss Bai's things. I'm sorry. It was without an envelope, I read it.
We have spoken to Staffordshire, Merseyside and other stations, no one has been to our witnesses. There is no Detective Galen in the state registry. Let's not call him Galen anymore. That's just what he wants. He wants the name in our heads so he can control our thinking.
This is a huge business. That's why Ruben was in the pool. Dead. Alec, where are you? Fairweather often borrowed a neighbor's trailer. It's in a field near Welsh Lane. Towards the Winsford Flashes.
I guess he's got a thing for older guys. Oh, sorry. Jacob's medical records. - Why would you hide a key? - Because it could incriminate you.
I thought it would inspire you. Those show-offs and a movie about toilets? You need to be a little more open. Where's that sexy break dancer I used to know? Wishing he was somewhere else.
"Shoot yourself. Never wake up again. This is too much for you. This is 16,000 times more than you can ever handle. This cookie is the size of a cookie, but it's enough for 22 people."
Or her. Where? You found a body up in that tree? - No, in that tree. - It's hollow.
One is cut off. Like being in a little bubble of freedom. You mean the freedom to raid the minibar? Who's being cynical now? There's something wrong with this deal. It's not... normal.
Erectile dysfunction. Yes, I have that too. Because one of my testicles was removed. You see, I have cancer. And it seems to be winning.
The launch of Daedalus marked the beginning of our historic seven-month journey to Mars. But reaching the red planet wasn't easy. We needed visionaries to show us the way. Mars and Earth are sister planets. Young Mars has rivers and lakes. PRESIDENT, MARS SOCIETY It even had an ocean.
We needed visionaries to show us the way. Mars and Earth are sister planets. Young Mars has rivers and lakes. PRESIDENT, MARS SOCIETY It even had an ocean. If there is water on Mars, is there the possibility of life? Is it habitable?
Every piece of material we have goes into the distribution box. That's too much. We don't have a choice, Robert. We only have one shot at building the Dome. It's not going back in.
With the six drones in the air flying 12 hours. There's not a single tube there that has a horizontal entrance. - You have to set up. - Wait. I think I've got something. We ignored that horizontal entrance because it was clogged with debris and too far away from the selected skylight to be part of the same tube system.
If they fail, no matter how much you've invested, we're out. If everything tells you, "You're already lost..." If they fail, everyone is out. ...the only thing you're left with is faith. We ignored this horizontal entrance because it's full of boulders.
He has a severely disturbed carpenter who is mentally ill. He has to take him with him, because he can't leave him with the crew, because he causes chaos. On Mars, just as with 19th century adventurers, crews could break apart. You find the dynamics in the historical record, you see how problematic they are to the success of a mission. Someone wrote this down at the end of the 4th century, St. Augustine. My memory contains my feelings. Not in the same way that they are present in the mind when it experiences them. In a very different way.
- That's what you say. But how exactly? What is it, boy? - I, uh... I got a letter. What does it say? - It's from the Reich Youth Leader.
I didn't have a token witness, I had someone who didn't show up and then went into hiding. But they could have asked for a continuance to have time to find them. And I could have, except for one thing: When I questioned her about what they were doing at the time of the murders, she admitted they were both on meth. Gallo's motion has come back, and it needs to be filed by his trial counsel.
So, how did it go? It's in the works. You know, this book reminds me of when we were sitting on the porch. You were about three and you said the word "space", out of the blue, out of the blue. And I asked you if you knew where space was and you pointed down the street and said "down there". Well, I guess I believed it was there.
The film portrays blacks as a danger to white women. All the myths of the black rapist arose from the fact that the white political elite and entrepreneurs needed black workers. What we miss about The Birth of a Nation is that the film was an accurate prediction of how skin color would be traded in the United States. The Birth of a Nation was almost directly responsible for the rebirth of the Klan. It was given a romanticized, heroic portrait in it.
Longer sentences, three strikes and that's it, nearly 60 new offenses punishable by death.... And then Congress came up with a $30 billion federal crime bill in 1994 that strengthened the work of law enforcement. The 21st Century Federal Crime Bill incorporates cutting-edge technologies and tactics to make our communities safer. The bill was responsible for a massive expansion of the prison system. It also provided funds and perverse incentives for law enforcement to do things we now think of as abuse.
Harvey, Rachel needs to go to law school. And besides, that's something I want to do. Donna, I don't care about Louis and his tenants. I do. Because we all said we'd give anything to make this place what it used to be, and right now Jessica has a possible new client for you waiting in the conference room.
All right, that's enough for today. But Naomi, if you're going to impugn the character of another lawyer. then you should know that it doesn't reflect well on you in the eyes of the jury. Rachel, can I talk to you for a minute? Sorry, Professor, I have another class in five minutes. They say coffee is for fallers, but it's not.
I want to know where it went. No problem. I had to throw that shit away. You poured out my prune juice? Let me put it this way: If my asshole had an asshole, that's how it would smell. That's how it's supposed to smell.
Do you remember my case of the Innocent Project? How could I forget? Tough Rachel. Thanks. I took it, but now they say it wouldn't be suitable.
Then I better take it to my office and sign it. Oh, and for the record, I had no intention of weaseling out of your deal. I did everything possible to keep it intact. Now it's intact again.
- It is a cleaning agent. - If it is salted? That's how you clean cast iron pans, not soapy water. You clean them with a big handful of salt. You think your BP is a cast iron pan because I can assure you he is not. - He likes dogs.
Yes, right. Yes, it starts... - Tomorrow. - No. Yes, it starts tomorrow.
YOUR OPERATION Natural talent. No, seriously, I'm not trying to get you excited with this show. It's about how beautiful sex is, and how it unites us all. How it stimulates and connects us.
Natural talent. No, seriously, I'm not trying to get you excited with this show. It's about how beautiful sex is, and how it unites us all. How it stimulates and connects us. How it opens people's eyes. Without sex, we wouldn't be here. Sex creates life.
Mr. McGregor has a pituitary tumor. A large one. It appears to be pressing on the optic nerve junction. Which, if his vision is impaired, could explain why he falls. How long do you think he's been there?
I'll be right back. Proven blind? He can see strong light and block images, probably made up my size earlier. But a little more than a few feet away, it's probably just like a blur. His pituitary tumor, is it operable.
The meetings, the waiting? I don't miss that part of the job. It would still be your job if you fought for it a little bit. This room, does it seem... Like it's decorated by someone who needs to loosen up?
I regret having missed that. No, definitely not. Sorry. It was very disturbing. We need to do something about your arm. I heard it break.
Read the book! Maybe I could read the book. Sorry, what do you mean no human? Because Radcliffe and I built it, okay? Your mind is not suffering, it's a program.
Both. Not only does it drive the source, it drives Eli. But it's also the perfect fail-safe to keep us all out. By fail-safe, you mean.... See the beryllium lid? It's a neutron reflector. It's designed to snap shut at the touch of a finger.
Should the prosecutor think that you and I had something to do with the murder of the witness, which of us would be in danger? Certainly not me. Of course not, shithead. The storm will pass, what else. No matter how strong the wind blows, it won't knock me down.
Eva! Did you read my text message? -I left the sweater at your place. -I'll have a look. I'd rather pick it up myself, because I know what it looks like.
I do not know you. There are different stages in an obsession. Straight, do you want to know what I think? The devil keeps quiet. He gathers his strength, then shows his biting little teeth. And when he does, I'll kill the son of a bitch.
Of course, Angela. How's Casey? She seems okay. She doesn't? No. It's gotten worse. The demon, it can move things.
I want to talk to you about your personal life, specifically your relationship with Paige. Well, I don't really want to do that right now. Are you aware that she's having financial difficulties? What are you talking about? Well, the difficulties are caused by her condition, or rather, the expensive treatments it requires.
He might have some leverage over her. Maybe it's Stockholm syndrome. Maybe. But I think I've come up with a better theory. You'll recall that Aaron Stone recently visited a family lawyer and that he and Beth are about to celebrate their tenth anniversary. Yes? But while I'm not privy to the details of their prenup, I wouldn't be surprised if it's about to lapse.
No. No, that's not true. I didn't... We know you've been to a lawyer about your prenup. We don't know when it expires, but ten years is a nice round number.
What surprised me most was the attempted break-in. Nothing had been stolen. There was no evidence that anyone had climbed over the wall. It was immediately clear to me that it was a fake burglary. It could only serve to divert suspicion from someone who had a connection to the house.
It's soaked in blood. She must have been wearing it when they killed her. It was torn here. The clasp is missing. There it is.
So the burden is on us. - What burden? To end the perpetual war so that the true work, progress and perfection, can begin. By letting millions of people die? Joseph... This war will be terrible, yes. But it will be the last war. And when it is over, the world will live united and in peace. For the first time in the history of mankind.
- To the second round. - Alex, we have a problem. - Do you see Hank? No, everything's gone. The fight club was cleared out like it never existed.
The DEO mainframe computer correlates all incoming data, throws out possible targets, therefore... How exactly does it work? Well, for example. Let's say the police get a tip about a suspicious-looking van watching the Central Bank on Bridwell Avenue. We analyze the tip. What if it's useful? That one?
Besides, it would be bad if you were killed when I could have helped you. - I'm thinking of my suit. - Please. I've already started. Just trust me. Do me a favor, don't jump into the fray until it's done.
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I know I don't have the copyright to take care of Kara. But we're running out of time. I need that suit. - When it's ready, I'll let you know.
The bars are made of Nth metal from Thanagaar. They are unbreakable. What kind of place is this? Who are these people? Cadmus. It's run by scientists who want the aliens off Earth.
I'm watching you. How you put up with people you certainly loathe. Like me. How do you do it? Caldy told me about the pith helmet. Don't worry, he'll be back.
Put that away, Nathan. I don't want you spitting up all night. Hi, Monroe. Red, what do you notice about your shiva head? That it's on someone else's set?
Hi, Monroe. Red, what do you notice about your shiva head? That it's on someone else's set? No. It's on a finished set. Whereas your shiva head isn't a head at all. It needs to go to the shop.
You wouldn't say it at all. That's the point. The spies are from a fictional country. It's totalitarian, deadly. But we don't call it Germany. So Gyssling can only complain if he admits that they are like that too, but he can't.
So the mail was sent from a Chauffinor computer? Most likely. It could have been sent by anyone in the company. I can't handle the computer. As soon as I do nothing, it goes off.
This could have been sent by anyone in the company. I can't get along with the computer. As soon as I do nothing, it goes off. The screen switches to stand-by. It does not turn on when I turn it on.
- Answer the question. Yes, I saw him. Wouldn't you have? What did you see? It shows an atomic bomb destroying San Francisco. Resistance fighters are publicly executed by Nazis and...
No. He'll try to get her as far away from her as possible. Please, you have to find her. As soon as we changed the search to Charles' daughter, we had a hit. There aren't that many 15-year-olds booking last-minute flights abroad. A private jet to Mexico City from Teterboro was booked by Larry and Sophie Morris, but it was paid for by the same front company that paid Michael and Bridget.
Have you been here before? No. Have you? Yeah, I like it here. They have good pizza and a really good salad, I don't remember what it's called.
I saw the lake, but now... Hey, Bella. How's it going? What happened to the lake? It's there.
Hey, Bella. How's it going? What happened to the lake? It's there. He's not going anywhere.
A single, fatal thrust to the aortic arch.... five centimeters from the midline, at about the second button. Target the spine. Maintain eye contact, doc. Disadvantage of this attack... It must be executed with enough force to penetrate the thoracic cavity and enough precision to find the target.
We did these exercises, sneaking up and peeking. - You mean he had a fake ID? - Yes. Very well done. Looked totally legitimate. At first glance, even at second glance, he was....
BLITZ-ENTERTAINER This is a faraday suit that dissipates better than we do. Perfect. Awesome. The Tesla transformer entertainer and Aron's comrade-in-arms. When electricity hits the suit, it would prefer to move on the surface rather than penetrate the monkey, which doesn't conduct well.
- I do not drink. It makes me shit. - Can you drink tea? - Tea's fine. The guy from the bowling alley? - He called me a seer. - They do.
- I'm looking for a boy named Chris, okay? He's got dark hair, he's from Milwaukee... Guys, I'm not a cop. I'm a firefighter. I saved his backpack. and he's got his meds in there...
Dearing is one of your clients. - I can explain that. - Have you ever heard the expression... "arsonist fireman"? What? It refers to a firefighter who sets fires just so he can put them out and be hailed as a hero.
But it gets worse. Because if you go full throttle... I'm not saying it's like being attacked by a bear. But it's like being in a room with a bear that's thinking about attacking you. While I was doing that, I throttled the engine down to the lowest setting with this knob. Right now it's only running at 500 horsepower.
Holy cannon barrel! The engine just manages 820 horsepower. And the speed is incredible. Now the bear is attacking. They say it goes from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.9 seconds.
The top speed is 335 km/h with the wing on the back. But it feels a lot faster. Oh, boy! Plus, you get a whole squadron of mechanics for your money. But alas.... No handbrake. Now that I've taken the steering wheel off, I can't put it in gear to keep it from rolling away.
- Exactly. Everyone would like to have Jett in the car. - I made a prototype. It's a gearshift lever with a Jett knob on top. It's not polished yet, but you can shift with it.
As what? My toothbrush? Okay... He reaches the end of the odd straight and continues on to the advertising hoarding. He brakes to keep control. I'm sure he'll love the turbo that slingshots him through the turn. A turbo engine? That can only mean it doesn't have enough cylinders.
I escaped Hammond's luxury oasis and can tell you something about this remarkable car. It's powered by the two-liter turbocharged engine from the 250-horsepower Ford Focus ST. It sits in the middle, behind my head. The rear wheels are driven with the help of a classic six-speed transmission. 250 hp doesn't seem like a lot these days, but this car with an aluminum frame and composite-shell chassis weighs less than 750 kg. That's why it's really fast.
I meant C3! Yes! Oh, yeah! Yes! Shit. That mistake wasn't just a hit. It had changed everything.
And deeper. And wider. But there's no cheese. - Just leave me alone. In America, cheese is everywhere except on the Grand Canyon. Here, you get the cheese with it, and it's delicious.
The powerful Mustang makes the American cocky. But it takes the corners surprisingly cleanly. We Americans want to see the tires smoke. This thing should just drive until the boiler whistles. I can't keep up with these weird phrases. And it stops on the dot.
You take any object, write a car name on it, and it becomes expensive. This teddy, for example. I know a thing or two about teddy bears. Polyacrylic, filled with industrial waste. Cost: 2.75 pounds. But because he's wearing a Honda T-shirt, he costs ten pounds.
Fortunately, it was he and not we who knocked down the tree. Anyway... We now come to the 50th anniversary of the greatest car race in history. In the 60's Ford realized they could sell more cars if they were more successful on the race track. So they came up with a clever plan. But unfortunately... it completely backfired. Right, Bob?
Under this enormous time pressure, this car was created. The Ford GT. Thanks to its sleek shape and a height of just one meter, it was supposed to cut through the air like a rocket. With a 4.2-liter V8 and a top speed of 320 km/h, everything seemed fine. But a race car can only make dreams come true when it proves itself on the race track.
What kind of engine? - A V8. I put a V8 in my buggy. You just parked it next to it. It's not in there.
I put a V8 in my buggy. You just parked it next to it. It's not in there. - He's got a point. You backed into it, but it's only a third of the way in.
Do you actually know how hard it is to put a V8 in a buggy? It's impossible. - It doesn't fit. It's not a normal V8. It used to be a 3.5-liter V8 from the Range Rover. But I rebuilt it, and now it has 180 hp.
So all I have to do is reattach the bolt, patch the coolant pipe, and borrow 15 gallons of water from a passing motorist, and I'm on my way. But I could use some help, because I need to lift the car to.... I don't see anyone here, though. - I'm sure somebody will stop. If someone gives you water, they can help you with that.
I would also like to have its suspension. How is the car supposed to withstand this torture all day? Unfortunately, since it was designed by me and made of 40-year-old parts, the answer was all too predictable. The alternator was acting up on its own. There should be a bolt in there, but it fell off.
- It isn't. Your car is from the 60s and was driven by Steve McQueen. One of the coolest people who ever lived. Yet you still managed to make your buggy boring. - That's right. Like boring fireworks. - Exactly. It's boring because it works.
- What works? The only problem was a small leak in the tank. Everything else worked. Every time I passed you, I thought, "This is pathetic." No, it's elegant and genuine.
Not bad, the lawyer. I'd rather have him defend my friends than my enemies. If I don't go to jail, I'll go to Quebec. Far away from everything. Away from this shitty mountain. He took a lot from me.
I am not allowed to say it. Yes, I gave that person my word of honor not to say anything. No problem. But I can tell you that there was a kiss. And it wasn't bad.
Yes, I think so. I want you to know that I wouldn't change a thing about our marriage. Neither would I. You always said how much you loved the first snow. And you always said how annoying it was.
Luck plays such a big role in that. How would you feel if they paid for one beer out of ten? I would be thrilled. Surely the next attempt will go better. Yes, it will.
Yes, and if Colt asks, it has to be that many. I think your dad really believes in what he says, but in the end he'll do it again like he always does. Remember that John Wayne DVD collection at Christmas? He used them as props for his John Wayne video collection. Like when we got him his first PC. First it sat in the box for six months, then he put the typewriter on it.
This is an important life decision. I even ask you before I change my shampoo. Yeah, and that's really annoying. Almost as annoying as you asking me how your ass looks in jeans. I never ask you that, because I know it looks good.
I'd love to. Babies are basically like drunks, babbling incomprehensibly, crying until they get the bottle, and shitting themselves. And thank you... I forgot your name. It's... Umberto.
Babies are basically like drunks, babbling incomprehensibly, crying until they get the bottle, and shitting themselves. And thank you... I forgot your name. It's... Umberto. It's easy for you to remember, it's like...
Great story! -It's yours. Make a movie out of it. -I WILL make a movie about you. -Want to know what it's going to be called?
I killed Majid Nassar. Push the button already. Mr. President, step away from the table. Toxicology ran a test for thallium poisoning. It came back positive. - He couldn't have known about the thallium.
- That's right! The procedure doesn't care whether you are in a wheelchair, whether you come flying or jumping. You have to believe in the process. My son, this chair gives you strength. It is your secret weapon.
Ágata, it's over. Come with me. Cassia. Find out everything you can about this candidate, okay? This test you created... I don't know if it's appropriate for island selection.
Trust me. Trust me. All is well. Cassia, I'll fix the alarm. No, it was set off accidentally.
- Go, go! Close it! - Go! The official test is only the first part. It is used to determine how they use work and resources.
Do you want it? This is a magic ring. Do you want it? I have this ring. Do you know who it belonged to?
But I saw that he was murdered. And you know how it's always on the news, see something, say something. He always had a laptop with him, but he never used it here. After he ate, he took it out to the parking lot. He worked on it a little bit, stood right over there by the wall, then he got in his car and drove away.
The noddis also have a problem. As their chicks grow, the Pisonia trees develop seeds that are sticky and have barbs. When the young noddis hatch, they carry these sticky seeds to other islands. But sometimes the Pisonia trees are too successful. If a young bird falls to the ground while testing its wings, it can become coated with the seeds.

If it cannot free itself while so entangled and overloaded, the young bird will starve to death.
You kind of get used to hearing a constant splash on the tent wall at night. But, as you can see, our gear gets splashed too, I'm afraid. And when the wind shifts, it brings a foul-smelling reminder that they are camping on an active volcano. It's the first time we've smelled sulfur, which is a welcome change from the smell of penguins. He smokes to himself.
If they find out we're hiding her... They won't. Nine days the girl's been here. Have you noticed any change? The demon is poisonous because it knows we're winning.
-His power is tripled. -What are you getting at? If we fail, we release an ancient force into the world. Then we better not fail. If he can't complete the integration, he'll kill the girl out of anger, you know that.
-More reason to keep her out. You saw how it went when she was here. She can help draw the demon out. As bait. You never give a demon what it wants.
Night, Mom. No. No. One condition. I bring my staff with me. I also want a bus, Wednesdays and Sundays. It will shuttle between St. Anthony's and St. Bridget's.
No, the spring. Where did you get it? From the book. Can I just... One hundred and sixty-two. "I knew then that the demon would never rest. Never stop until he possessed Regan completely.
From the book. May I... One hundred and sixty-two. "I knew then that the demon would never rest. Never stop until he possessed Regan completely. He would haunt her until the end of days."
You don't bother the emperor with trivialities. Cleander diverted the grain shipments from Egypt and hid them until the right moment. But he does not foresee that the shortage of food and the beginning of famine create ideal conditions for the return of the plague. Gentlemen, taste the wine. It is delicious.
Streets were destroyed. Temples burned down. People died. But I am here to tell you that this is not a bad thing. In a forest, fire is not a disaster. It is necessary.
People died. But I am here to tell you that this is not a bad thing. In a forest, a fire is not a disaster. It is necessary. It burns the dead wood. It provides new growth, new life.
No one has ever been there. All you ever heard about was this place called Greenpoint. Nobody took the G train. "Are you crazy? It's full today, nobody rode it then.
They have their reasons, people. We must not judge them. They have their way of life. I could tell you a Polish joke right now. It wouldn't be the same, but it would still be funny.
I just wanted to thank you for what you did for me. What? Nothing. It's just that... The table was... It was evidence in a 78-year-old murder case I was trying to solve.
That's all I can say about it. I saw the plane fly into the building. That changed everything. From this day forward... any nation that harbors terrorists is considered an enemy regime by the United States. The only way to defeat terrorism that threatens our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it originates.
This changed everything. From this day forward... any nation that harbors terrorists is considered an enemy regime by the United States. The only way to defeat terrorism that threatens our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it originates. Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda.... but does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group with global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated.
Shake your head if you hear me. Can you hear me? I see you better now. LUCASVILLE-INSASSE 1988 - 1993 The TB test was a violation of our rights as followers of Islam. It contains phenol, a substance containing alcohol.
First, the balloon is filled three-quarters full with cold air. Now comes the burner. This is really cool. While the air is heating up... There, it rises.
I have a feeling we're going to go nuts. The blower worked well. After ten minutes, the balloon was filled with air. And fire. Peter added hot air with the burner so the balloon slowly filled and rose. It rises.
He was crazy, because he had the idea of putting a pigeon in a rocket.... DR. AARON BLAISDELL ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGIST ...so it could guide it to a ship and blow it up. Putting a pigeon in a bomb is crazy and immoral. But theoretically, it could have worked. One pigeon pecks at the ball coming toward it and pushes it toward the other. When it rolls past one pigeon, the other can eat.
It is held together by wood screws, possibly some glue. Glue? That's a joke. I heard that the drivetrain was supposedly a BMW motorcycle engine, a lawn mower engine.... You see this car and it's just crap.
That's a joke. I heard that the drivetrain was supposedly a BMW motorcycle engine, a lawn mower engine.... You look at this car and it's just crap. There can't have been much engine in it. But from a distance it looked good.
The winch tensions the rubber ropes. It retracts when we operate the release. The release allows us to be far away when the thing goes off. This is the sled. It's unloaded for this test, because we just want to see how the rubber cords perform.
See you in the middle. - Okay. - Let's go to war. War. What does it bring?
Capturing a drone is cool, but it doesn't satisfy me like shooting down a drone does. This British bazooka looks like it could destroy the Death Star. But its job is to capture flying drones. I can build a makeshift version that is just as effective. My drone catcher is a custom design I built myself. It is made of plumbing materials and glue.
Thank you. Yes. Thank you for waiting. Your call is important to us. If it was that important, I'd be talking to a human, not a machine.
Clocks ticked. And otherwise there was peaceful silence. Nowadays, some people suffer 1,000 beeps a day. The question is: Why does the beep exist? How did it replace simpler devices, for example, buzzer, horn or bell?
All you have to do is energize them and you get a beep. These plates were cheap and easy to adapt. That's how the beep came to be used in devices from the very small to the very large. It even made it into space. In October 1957, the Soviets launched Sputnik. This small satellite beeped continuously as it orbited the Earth every 98 minutes.
"Where's my rocket pack?" I think the day is so close we can almost touch it. That's the day I'm looking forward to. I want one of those. It's close for a sci-fi promise. It looks like it flew out of a sci-fi movie.
This is the future. The waveguide is a light guide device that you can adjust to the size of the wound. We think the wound is sealed, and we can turn off the laser. In the end, we just cut the waveguide. It's made of biodegradable polymer that just dissolves in the body.
You don't see that every day. The hole is patched with stem cell material, covered with paint and irradiated for ten minutes. Turn on the laser. I've done some strange things, but repairing a pig's intestine beats it all. Okay, it's sealed.
Why? Because it's incredibly annoying. It's the selfie stick. Or as some people call it, the narcissist stick. The selfie stick was so popular, it was among TIME magazine's 25 best inventions of 2014.
He used many different metal tone wheels for these notes and when he added a keyboard.... That's right. Cahill created the world's first synthesizer. It was so complicated that you needed two organists. And it was huge.
Like the heroic pioneers who stormed into the history books in the Bonneville salt flats.... He's out of control. ...giving up is simply not an option for Tim. BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA And there I am again, standing on a tarmac with another referee from the Guinness Book of World Records and a new wheel design. It is a plastic rim.
...giving up is simply not an option for Tim. BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA And there I am again, standing on a tarmac with another referee from the Guinness Book of World Records and a new wheel design. It's a plastic rim. A little different than the tire you saw. It's 45 grams lighter.
To invade another body.... uninvited, is serious. I survived because I turned off my head. "You can never hurt my insides, my spirit. My body is just a part of me. It is not the whole me.
We would be in prison forever. There's no way I'm going back to Israeli prison. We may never see the family again, but a freedom fighter has to make a choice. The conflict is crucial for the future of the entire city. As long as it is not resolved, Israeli troops will remain on the ground.
Come with me. You have taken me in. Let me help. Rajan. Even though we are married, my body is mine. It is not a piece of land that you plow.
Tonight we are supposed to... Sleep together. Yes. When I'm in the ring, sometimes my body moves without me telling it to. It moves without me thinking I should do this or that.
Sleep together. Yes. When I'm in the ring, sometimes my body moves without me telling it to. It moves without me thinking I should do this or that. It moves in harmony with the moment.
You danced too well to be straight. I love you, Mom. Why do you watch this movie every year? I don't know. I like what he believes in.
I love you, Mom. Why do you watch this movie every year? I don't know. I like what he believes in. What does he believe in?
A grip troll. Very dangerous. -Grip troll? -Gryphon troll! He flew in daylight.
You fought the grappling troll? That's really brave. It was luck. Incredibly heroic and brave and troll hunter-like. We'll see. Once a griffin troll has identified its target, it hunts it to the death.
-No word. It is beautiful. Welcome to Heartstone Troll Market. This place is incredible. It's just incredible.
So I looked for stones that were important in his life. Birthstone. Indeed. Something like Gunmar's birthstone. He has power?
And out of it came Gunmar. Birthstone, okay. And where do we find him? Birthstone gone. It was stolen before it was useful.
-Sorry, the hospital. -Of course. Well, I have to get back to work, but I still have a few minutes. This tea is really delicious. Yes, I'd say it's quite enchanting.
-Otherwise we die! -Three, two, one. Time's up. Death! It begins and has no end and ends all things that begin.
Sleeping pills. -Shadow Wand. -The sledgehammer chases the monster away. -Then I pull the ring off his finger. -And if it doesn't come off?
-Shadow Staff. -The sledgehammer chases the monster away. -Then I pull the ring off his finger. -And if he doesn't come off? Why should he?
I'm surprised how well we work together. Yeah, but when this is over, I'm going to kick your ass. After we get through this, I might ask about Gunmar's Eye. I'm sure you still want to find the last Triumbian stone. -You know where it is?
This hacking attack is among the largest data breaches in the world to date. You're being asked to... I was sitting in a meeting and my phone started dancing. I tried to focus, but squinted over and saw the names of business partners, clients, friends of mine and Ashley Madison contacts on the screen. That's when my heart stopped. The hacking attack seemed strange to me because it reminded me of Hollywood. It was as if there was a script for it.
Come on, buddy! Come on! - Come on. - Faster, buddy! Don't use your cell phones! (construction workers) We already tried, but we got no reception down here. We gotta get out of this airport now before it burns to the ground.
I did everything I could to protect them. Since the shipwreck, we are surrounded by wild animals. (KLEINKIND CRYING) The jungle devours everything. It takes the old, the sick, the wounded, the weak.
But he should be the only victim. Apart, of course, from the population that you enslave, right? Will you pass me the pepper? (GRUNTING) It also serves as a necklace occasionally.
- What do you want? - I want to stop the killer. - A ghost. - A ghost? No, he's not a ghost.
Yes. He moved here a few years ago. Very mysterious. Very sexy. I love the way he smells. He smells so minty sweaty.
- Dude, let go! - Listen to me very carefully. It's the Abominable Snowman! You don't get a nickname like that for nothing. And he got out of a book.
You don't get a nickname like that for nothing. And he got out of a book. - It doesn't just happen, Zach. - I'm following Hannah. I read what he did to Pasadena.
Brian. Brian. You are Lono. The hula dance touches me deeply, doesn't it? It's so expressive.
Thank you notes, huh? Yes. How was the winter dance? - Nice. - Yeah? - Yeah. - It was good.
There are not enough bullets in the world to destroy mikch. (GROANS) John Connor talks too much. Follow me. The timer, it sped up.
This is business, Suge. Come on, man. What are you working on there, buddy? I like that. Yeah, it's a new track for this new feature film. It's called "Beyond the White Line."
A tartan is the Honda of Albania. JAMES: Why did you take an Albanian car? The onset of summer vacation severely limits the availability of cars suitable for families. It comes with the latest Albanian technology. There you go.
- The muffin! Dad, the savior of the stranded! Thank God! Where's he going?
shot up into the air? - Wasn't that strange? - No. That's how the real estate market is. Low risk. It's solid.
Oh, really? - That was me. Cool. I was on the design team for this radiation suit. It was the reason I survived as long as I did.
Cool. I was on the design team for that radiation suit. It was the reason I survived this long. It was never intended to last this long. It's broken, defective.
What? ! You have a generator? The engine is broken. That's my fault. When it suddenly stopped, I wasn't paying attention.
I am in love with her. - Beware! Love costs you more than you think. Exhaust fumes are coming out of the engine. - It was in great shape.
Put the brakes on, my Russian friend. We may be engaged, but I have a mind of my own. Besides, I wouldn't wear my engagement ring. Remember? It was just stolen.
I have the impression that you are using my case to propagate your goal: Gay marriage. Absolutely right. I was just waiting for this case. I've been dreaming about it. This puts the issue in the spotlight and turns the tide for gay marriage. My fight is not about marriage. It's about equality.
Who are you? I am not a princess. I have no carriage, no parents and no possessions. I don't even know if this beautiful shoe fits me. But if it fits,
I am here. As long as you can still breathe, you will fight. You breathe. Keep breathing. If a storm comes, and you stand in front of a tree... and you look only at the branches, you swear it will fall.
There was nothing more that could be done. Right? Yes. We've all seen it. When a storm comes and you're standing in front of a tree... and you look at the branches, you swear it's gonna fall.
The best sleep you experience without being dead. And you cheat death. Go ahead, take your clothes off. I have an awkward, unattractive body. It's not unattractive.
Where is the mother of the child? I came to Mexico as a virgin. And I leave tainted. My body was a stranger. And now it becomes familiar to me in its sheer vulnerability.
And look what he wrote to Stalin: "Dear Stalin...". That's no way to address the leader of the USSR. Upton did, and he's a writer. "You may have heard that I am financing a feature film that Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein is making in Mexico. It will be an extraordinary work, and I think a revelation for the art of film.
I have changed my intention. By the fact that you were arrested. No. I certainly believe that my plan would have succeeded if my abandonment had been correct. Since it did not succeed, I am convinced that it should not succeed and that my view was wrong.
- Yes. You guys okay? What happened? We ran over a white-tailed deer. It was huge.
There was nothing I could do. It was time for a goodbye. (Prince) You understand, it's too far. I can't take this body with me. It will lie there like an abandoned shell.
- Dad, it's you! You look serious. I would have preferred a driver... ...but it's nice anyway. - Dad, the switch isn't working. - What do you mean, it's not working?
You look serious. I would have preferred a driver... ...but it's nice anyway. - Dad, the switch isn't working. - What do you mean, it's not working? Yeah, that's right, it's not working.
I was dematerialized and reassembled. Is everyone alive? Are my parents alive? I don't know. You killed the alien before he could send me on.
If it works... you can train it. "If it works?" It's my new project. A robot with a human mind. But he's like a child at first.
Ma'am, listen. It's Deon's fault. It's a program he wrote... he brought a droid here... and it was alive. Did you see it? He's committing crimes, the monster.
I could pick up coins with it if I wanted to do that. I've never wanted to do it until now. I shouldn't be telling you this, but Rob's penis has this kink in it. There's a term for it. I don't know how to describe it, but it's curved.
It's my fault, I was trying to be a big girl. I'm really, really sorry. Are you talking to me? Uh, Robert Pacino. Stick your head up your ass and see if it fits.
Stick your head up your ass. Stick your head up your ass and you'll know if it fits. If it fits. Stevia! Stick your head up your ass, -then you'll know if it fits.
Whether it fits in. Stevia! Stick your head up your ass, -then you'll know if it fits. - I'll pass. Stick your head up your ass, then you'll know if it fits.
The new editor is coming Monday. Sorry, buddy, but I gotta ask you: what do you know? How's the cake? It's really good.
I grew up in Ohio. Mom was from South Boston. Okay, you know it. I never saw Back Bay. What happened on that first visit, Joe? At first, he was very nice.
Hardly anyone from outside will know what we have been through. This is "the nut." The military headquarters of the Capitol. It's manned by military and civilian personnel from District 2. The base is so deep in the rock, it's virtually inaccessible.
But the factor of the perpendicular deviation. Here, this is the refugium. If you run the drill at full speed 24 hours a day, the drill will deviate. Like this. Or even like this. To be honest, it can deviate at 20 different angles.
No, no, no, Don Lucho, it's too dangerous. The mountain is completely unstable. There must be another solution. We know that. We know it's unstable, but that's the only solution.
The metal cage is designed to transport the 33 miners one by one from a depth of 700 meters up to daylight, which they have not seen for 62 days now. WATCH: Open. Okay. It's sinking.
How fast? Too fast. See this green line? We marked that rock yesterday. See how far it sank?
But we both know that you will not give up the discovery of the century just because another name will be in the history books. Our little friend said it already, you are Tesla. And I have no problem being just another Edison. Research protocol, last entry before hour zero of the experiment. A cutting sound has been drilling through all my brain synapses ever since I opened one side of the wormhole. Now it has finally stopped.
...the whole story has become much more complicated That's why it's not finished yet. I wanted to see how it would end. But that's not me at all. He's just a version of me.
We take the train of thought. The train, sure. It's much faster. How do we get it? It goes around, but there's a station in fantasyland.
As old as you. And he's not an old fucker. Who's the motherfucker? Man, you suck. You piss me off! I want to know who he is.
- Yes? Where is my dog from? Australia. It's a Sheltie. You've had him since you were ten. Now he's with your cousin Ramnik.
But I don't want to! You know what? "Boov" rhymes with "groove." Wiggle your Boov butt. It wiggles in an undignified way!
That's the motto of the Boovs. Yeah, but we're not running. I have a plan. Does it involve running away? Because otherwise it's stupid!
- Hello, Mr. Parsons. Christ almighty, John Henry. Haven't seen you since you went off to war. I asked the saloon to order me some cider from Cheyenne. Can you see if it's here yet, please?
I have to be able to understand why you didn't come back. That is my right. I'll say one thing, and then I won't say anything more on the subject. The thought of coming back to you was the only thing that got me through that damn war. And when it was over, I swear to you on my life, I tried to get home.
I felt the life drain out of her. And then she breathed again. So I squeezed harder. And then I realized I couldn't put her in the suitcase like that. It was too big.
Stay close behind me. REESE: Fire alarm's right up here. PFEIFER: What if it doesn't work?
The fire alarm is right up here. PFEIFER: What if it doesn't work? REESE: It's already working.
Why? That's just the way I am. When you said "negotiate," what did you mean? I prepared a contract. It's quite detailed.
She's in a meeting right now. Hi. Is there anything I can do to help? Jules spilled soy sauce on her Saint Laurent blazer. Take it to the photo studio. They have detergent and stuff. - Sure, where is it?
Hey Matt. It's a... morning. Good morning. Is this all going to the cleaners? The 3 yes, they both need to go to the wash, and, uh, this button, this button is gone. - I mean, it's loose, so...
The map yard. The oldest in human possession. Exactly the meteorite that created this crater. Just imagine: So many years up there, alone and silent.... It picks up momentum to finally leave its mark on the earth.
Exactly the meteorite that created this crater. Just imagine: So many years up there, alone and silent.... It picks up momentum to finally make its mark on the earth. A massive, unstoppable force. Until he was stopped, right?
But I have something they don't. - A fuel combustion algorithm. The EXR. Everybody wants it. It's legal.
Let's get it over with. Now we're even. Be my hero. The magnetic field from the vibranium is holding the rock together. What if it falls?
Be my hero. The magnetic field from the vibranium holds the rock together. If it falls? - Thousands die. If it's high enough, global annihilation.
He is worthy of the hammer and the thought stone. With vision, it is safe. And nowadays safety is rare. If the hammer is in the elevator... He rides anyway.
I finally got out of there Quite sure Old friends I don't need The coach was on its way to London. Where do you think he let them out?
And your mop is plastic and looks strange. I don't know anything about diagrams. Or... about business, frankly. But I clean my own house. And I invented this mop because it's better than any other out there.
Or... Of business, frankly. But I clean my own house. And I invented this mop because it's better than any other out there. Please, give me a chance. I like that it's plastic, because that makes it very light.
But I clean my own house. And I invented this mop because it's better than all the others out there. Please, give me a chance. I like that it's plastic because that makes it very light. And it is ten times more absorbent than any other mop on the market.
That's a very large amount of absorbent cotton.... on a very small mop head. I'm done with the bath and I haven't even wrung out the mop. Let me ask you a question. Would you want to use this mop that you used to mop the bathroom and the toilet, with all the germs, to mop the kitchen where your family eats, where you cook for your children? I just put this mop head in the washing machine and it's like new.
Down. It is made of plastic. Very light, very durable. Zoom in on her hands. It is extremely absorbent with 300 cotton loops that I wound myself.
It is made of plastic. Very light, very durable. Zoom on her hands. It's extremely absorbent with 300 cotton loops that I wound myself. How much is it?
Oh! "Charles." I mean, "Charlie Brown." She's not here? On her way to summer camp? So the bus hasn't left yet? But it's about to leave?
Two weeks? Really? You said something about two days. His girlfriend broke up with him by e-mail. Honey, he's got a lot of baggage.
Enough. She's a little shy. Does that name mean anything to you? No. Why? Should it?
Stay together! Hold Leila! Go back! Get back in the circle! Where is he?
Get out of my bank, you son of a bitch! I know what you're up to, but hold on. Stand down. Why is the donkey stuck? If he came in, he can go out.
So, go. Strike three! You're out! No, the ball was... ...too low. For it to count, it has to be in the... in the strike zone.
Help me with this. Quickly. What's wrong? Sir. We were unable to apprehend the droid on Jakku. He escaped in a stolen Corellian YT freighter.
Sir. We were unable to apprehend the droid on Jakku. He escaped on a stolen Corellian YT freighter. The droid stole a freighter? Not exactly. He had help.
Don't let me down. What? The supercharger. Tell the First Order that Han Solo has the droid. He's aboard the Millennium Falcon.
Fast. A real hell of a pilot! The woman everyone's talking about. The droid. Where is he?
The junk collector defied you? The power is strong in her. Unfinished, but stronger than she knows. And the droid? Ren felt he was no longer of value to us.
And yet he remains here in the capital. He is shadowed by us at every moment. Day and night. He has patience. But his mummery does not fool me. He shouldn't fool you either.
I will come, I promise. I'll be at your wedding. What are you grinning at, Bud? I saved the fish. He swam away.
"May I?" - Can I eat now? - Sure. Dig in. Why don't you tell me how your day was today? It was great.
I don't know what. I don't like not knowing something. I saw a dreamer in the face of defeat. Did you see his suit? It was well tailored, but at least ten years old.
Come on, Edith. Let's go upstairs. Didn't you say the dog was dead? I abandoned him. I thought he was going to die.
Let's go upstairs. Didn't you say the dog was dead? I abandoned him. I thought he was going to die. How did he survive this long?
What is it? Firethorn berries. They are good for you. You don't like it? It's a little bitter.
Nothing gentle grows on this land. It takes bitterness not to be eaten. What was that? That is the east wind. When it increases, a vacuum is created in the chimneys. The windows are closed, and the house...
We needed the company. Thomas? Not for me, thank you. Drink your tea. It'll warm you up.
What did you say? Crimson Peak. That's what it's called. The ore from the clay colors the snow. It turns fire red.
Hey, Sam, how's your boring salad? It's actually quite tasty. That's what everyone always says about their salad, and they're all fucking liars. No, I like it. It's really good.
My God, I can't believe Nick Webber knows the cat trainer's name. Yes. Crazy, right? I have to tell you, I love this song. It feels very personal.
Fuck! Live? - I think Frank is up here now. - Good. ...in turn, we can celebrate the day as what it has been for all - - Norwegians, since the fathers of Eidsvoll...
Ah! What's that? Nothing. An angry ghost. He ate my great-grandmother.
Is everything okay, Jonny? Was that you? - What do you think? - That guy looks like you, doesn't he? Sure he looks like me!
This is really not the time! I know! That was just against my nervousness. But looking back, it wasn't a good idea, because now I feel like.... I feel like... my penis is whispering to me. It says terrible things.
I know! That was just against my nervousness. But looking back, it wasn't a good idea, because now I feel like.... I feel like... my penis is whispering to me. It's saying horrible things. It's telling me that my parents are cousins.
(rattling) Sully? What is this room? It was supposed to be an archive. Yeah, it was supposed to be.
Sully? What is this room? It was supposed to be an archive. Yes, it was. But what is it really?
- Okay. You go through bad phases. Then suddenly you find yourself in a... Let's call it a surreal experience. Describe what that was like for you. When you stare death in the eye and it stares back at you: Scary, honestly.
If you control the bull, there are good posture scores. Is that right with the hand? More or less. The bull also gets points. For speed, agility and power. Whether he bucks, goes through... or turns.
His first cowboy hat. That's so cute. He never took it off. Not when he ate, not when he slept. He wanted to tape it on so it wouldn't fall off.
Don, that little bitch sure told you about us, didn't she? She told me enough. - Even how big my dick is? - Not exactly. It's big.
- Not exactly. It's big. - Really? - Yes. He's big.
Do not try to defeat us. You can't. We are the best. Now I have to give my neck a break. It hurts because I have to look down on you.
- Okay, give me a second. -We don't have it! You hear that? This is not a horror trip, okay? This is death, and it's about to knock on our door. So can we please go now?
This is my banjo hand. The dog doesn't have the finger. What? The dog doesn't have the finger. He was in my hair.
Shh. Be quiet. What kind of noises does a deer make? No, a deer doesn't make noises like that. If he makes sounds, it's more like this.
White gold and diamonds. That's how my husband smuggled money into this country, as gifts for his vain stupid trophy wife. How much is the suitcase worth? I don't know. - I have limited mental abilities. - How much is it worth?
Was it good? Are you satisfied? The assistant director said it was good. Why are you making a film about people who lose their jobs? The film is not sad, it's full of energy, hope.
Could you come here, please? - Just a minute. Look what I found in the drawers. Why are you wearing Grandma's bathrobe? I was taking a shower and it was hanging there.
One million pounds. I hope you brought the government bonds? I think I'll keep the money and the vase. What? You cheated me on the last deal. I paid three million for the tapestry and then found out it was only worth one!
Don't worry, sir, I'm fine. - No! My little offspring! - What? Is he still okay?
- This is a fight like any other. - (SCOFFS SILENTLY) This fight? I've seen it before. You can't imagine it worse. And most of the time, it's unwinnable.
I am not a cake... I bake them. Yes, I see the connection. Now you can wear a cake. How did you know I don't like traditional jewelry? I can't stop staring at it.... And he keeps staring back.
Stay here. Will you be a loyal subject and help your king? Yes, my king. Tell me where Alcaman's palace is. I know it's here.
You have done a good job in protecting it. How do we get at it? We can't fight them. There are too few of us. Now be smart and tell me where he is.
I made a decision based on the desire to make a film. And the studio head gave me an ultimatum. If I didn't start the film on a certain day, it wouldn't be made. My first choice for the role was not available because he was in a TV series. Eric is a really good actor, and I decided to put him in the film, but it turned out that his instincts and the kind of comedy we wanted to do didn't match. It became more and more clear as the film progressed that this humor just wasn't working the way it should.

It was supposed to be a great film, but somehow it didn't come alive.
Adam, if you need to go to the bathroom, call me. I'll pick you up. Of course, that's not what the movie is about at all, but I thought it was funny that that was the theme of the movie for my mother. A boy traveling back in time and spending time with his mother. I was so excited. I made my parents, who were separated at the time, watch the movie with me because it had such an intergenerational theme.
-The birds steal from us. There is enough space where else they can go. Nature always comes first especially when it comes to adult playgrounds. Understand? There used to be an eagle in the area, but maybe it's gone.
I need the amplifier. I need it. That would be two rents. It's an old amp. It's worth a lot.
Kicked out by security. I'm at home all day. At night I wake up, drenched in sweat. My appendix was operated on. Since then I feel like it's leaking.
- Eleven details? First be married as long as I have. She knows what she wants, which is great. The sex is great. It's rough and wild.
I would even say you are my best writer. Thank you. I read your last draft of the Dr. Conners article. And I guess I judged too soon. It is very good.
It is very good. - Really? - Yes. - Really? - Yes, he is very good.
When everything is focused on making profits for big corporations, you see human rights, the environment, and workers' rights all losing out. You see workers increasingly exploited because the price of everything keeps getting driven down just to satisfy the drive to accumulate more capital. And that is deeply problematic because it leads to the mass impoverishment of hundreds of millions of people around the world. When you write to such companies, they send you their code of conduct. It's so nice, and it says, "We take responsibility.... DIRECTOR INSTITUTE OF LABOR LAW ...for the conditions under which our product is made, the product you buy.
Surely I would have remembered what became of her. Whether she fell victim to a perpetrator. But that evening I couldn't remember anything. I only knew that it was my last case, and also the reason why I left the profession. I moved here. To my bees. So I decided to write down the case. The way it really was. Not what John made it.
And I was the hero. It was his way of doing someone a favor. He couldn't write any other way about the character he created. Even after all these years, John didn't really know me. Why he took the glove, I can only guess: He didn't want it to remind me of the painful incident and become a source of
Okay, listen to me. What made you jump out of the truck, Jack? Ma said it in her head. What exactly did she say? Jump when he slows down. But I couldn't.
He comes home early from bowling. His skinny white wife is out with the girlfriends. And I suck his cock until my eyes water. I need Vaseline for my lips because his dick is so big that the corners of my mouth are tearing. What? Wait. How big is it really?
She ratted us out. Ms. Clinton, you are coming with us. Mr. Jefferson, you stay here. Shall we go see a doctor? My foot feels like it's gonna... Forget it.
With whom? My mother. She died a year and a half ago. She had cancer. First she had breast cancer, then a mastectomy, but it still stayed and moved to her lungs.
My mother. She died a year and a half ago. She had cancer. First she had breast cancer, then a mastectomy, but he still stayed and moved into her lungs. I guess you could say he wanted to be with her like everyone else.
A man was walking towards you. A man who could not breathe. I was also in that dark place. It is not a place for pure souls. It is very dangerous.
When I was seven, the doctor said I would be nine at the most. When I was 10, he said I wouldn't live past 15. I'm 43 now, some doctors call it a miracle. My pacemaker was running on batteries, now they put a chip in me. If it goes off, I die right away.
It's like One Heart and One Crown. No, not by a long shot. The award went to a flesh-and-blood author. Robert Rich doesn't exist. Who gets the prize if he wins?
No, not by a long shot. The award went to a flesh-and-blood author. Robert Rich doesn't exist. Who gets the prize if he wins? Maybe he won't.
You can take the fall yourself. Like this. Oh, hello, Sammy. Did you know I got this bird from Kirk Douglas? He's distracting you.
And as soon as I'm gone, you can reshoot all my scenes. You know, Ed, for better or for worse.... I'm Spartacus. There's a new movie coming out. It's called Spartacus.
I just don't want it to fall off. - Can I ask you something? - Of course you can. Would you mind if I came up and took another look at your balcony later? Because I think it's one of the seven wonders of the world.
No! His name is Wilhelm. He was up on the wall today. I served under him. He's a stalwart knight. Cruel. Merciless.
Nothing fit together. So much was illogical, their presentations made no sense. So all alarm bells were ringing for me. I don't know where this case is going, but we are documenting every word. When I think back to that day, it actually changed my life forever.
Rosemary Carroll was Courtney's lawyer and the media attorney for Kurt and Courtney. She was Francis Bean's godmother and knew them better than anyone. She told Tom that the two were in the middle of a divorce. Kurt was going to have a new will drawn up. But what stunned me the most was when I heard on the tape Rosemary Carroll look at the suicide note and immediately realize it had to be a forgery.
That's the worst-case scenario, which could be as far as him being in a house with someone. Sir. The landline to the apartment is up. If it is him, we have his location. In this case, the events spiral, Alex, you don't get a breather, and it moves into a new phase.
"Business?" You and Pete are unarmed security guards. Don't wait up. How come you never water the lawn? Why do you want me to water the lawn in the winter? - Because it's always all dried up.
Mine is 20 minutes from here. - I have a question. - Please don't ask me about Mom. I know you live in an apartment, but if you had a lawn, would it be withered or green? It would be green, I guess.
Because I'm just a stupid girl, or what? You know, I never really had a chance to show what I was made of with you. But yeah... I didn't finish it. It was you. All this time, you've been looking for the X Factor. And it was right under your nose.
Steve. He was 50. I'm listening. The Cape Gannet. A seabird that reaches speeds of up to 120 mph when it hits the ocean surface like a rocket.
And this is not some cute academic discovery hidden in some unknown journal. Bennet Omalu is declaring war on a corporation whose product 20 million people crave every week, just as they crave food. The NFL owns a day of the week. The same day that used to belong to the church. Now it belongs to them.
Flying Boy? Quick, slide down! They'll be here any minute. If I'm going to trust you, I need to know your name. It's Hook.
Oh, wow, don't get caught in Bernville, in the fall, after 6pm.... ...at the boys' camp without a tuxedo. It's made of the finest dacron from Akron, the rubber capital of the world. Smart and snappy, that's the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo. You're a bad boy but you want to look good, this is your tuxedo.... And yours and yours and yours. It comes in all the colors of the rainbow, red, yellow, tan and brown.
- De La Cruz, man, El Diablo. I don't trust Montgomery. That's the devil's greatest trick. What are you doing here, Billy? Let that shit out before it eats you up.
- What now? You cry? Because of those guys? They had made their choice, and they knew their day would come. And when it came, were they sorry? No!
You must be able to produce it when asked. How do I know you're not a villain who kidnapped this woman without a wanted poster in your pocket? What's your name, friend? Well. Certainly not friend. It's... Oswaldo Mobray.
But it's the stew that makes me wonder. How long did you say Minnie has been gone? A week? Sí. You see... my mama used to make a lot of stew. It always tasted the same, no matter what meat.
- But that was about damn time. - Best coffee in the mountains. - I wouldn't say that. Coachmen love it, passengers not so much. Most find it a touch too strong.
It's so cold that your nose freezes. The wind cuts through your jacket like a ginsu knife. Most people in Cicero were afraid of winter. But not Jimmy. Jimmy waited all summer... and when it was September... and he felt the first cold wind off Lake Michigan... he knew it was coming.
A basketball weighs between 550 and 650 grams. - Did you know that? - No, I didn't know that. Yes. It depends if it's for women or for men... but that's about its weight.
Why didn't you say so when you gave it to me? I wanted to wait until I brought you to Lallybroch. So you'd know it's your place as well as mine. But now I don't know if we'll ever get back there. - Jamie, I... That thought hurts me less than it would have before.
- What was that? High stakes pay off. If you distract him, I'll hit him with this wand. Split up, surround him. Or this is how he picks us off one by one.
She rubs my hair with sunflower oil. She's not my bitch. - Let me see that ring. It's from Babeth. - What does it say? It's huge.
Before what? - Before I met you. And you? - I don't take anything anymore. Coffee is already an exception, it changes the consciousness.
I'm going to America. To perform? Exactly. But my performance won't be just a show. It will be a coup.
But just look at the date! The coup is three weeks from today. Jean-Louis and Jeff are coming next week and I still haven't been to the roof of the North Tower. Will you be able to walk with your foot on the rope? Yes, it will heal by then, but what will I do tomorrow?
But when Papa Rudy is happy, his dogs get a double portion. The most beautiful moment for me was when you reacted to my shot signal. At that moment I knew the coup would be a success. But we almost lost the arrow. He was balancing on the edge.
Any experiment? This is not Boise, okay? I know Boise. Your mind is going crazy, Ethan. It won't accept the truth. Trust your eyes... ...and everything you've seen today.
I get it. If I meet a fat gay guy named "Tonno Stuffed Crust", I'll send him your way. That was a joke. Was humor killed by the apocalypse too? No, I think he died about five seconds ago.
- Can't you do it today? I'll try. Your address, please. - Why is that? We have a late delivery service. It suits you very well. It's a one-of-a-kind, just arrived yesterday from Tokyo.
Jess. Is "America Works" a reaction to the President's poor poll numbers? An attempt to show some signs of progress before the election? We've been working on the plan since day one. It has absolutely nothing to do with the poll numbers.
If she met you, I'm sure she would change her mind. So I seem well dressed to you? Yes? What's the matter? My dog Brian died. He was only four years younger than me.
I am sorry to hear that. I also suffered a lot when my dog died. What was your dog's name? His name was Tommy. He was the last gift from my father before he died.
You know it's for the best! Don't fight it. Just accept it. See what happens when you try to fight it? ! Every 30 years or so, this goddamn place will wake up. And it thirsts for new blood! And our city is forced to give it to him!
I know this comes as a surprise to you... but if you give me the money... I'll let you have Carmen. You disgusting pig. Give me the money. Over my dead body. I admire your courage... but it's not worth it.
- No. Maybe. You like it complicated, and I made it easy for you. What do you mean? If the rest of the stuff fits, I want to marry you. It does, and Chet owes you 50 bucks.
I'm not asking you to move in. Just don't be a homeless person for one night. - Where's the ring? - I took it off. - It's too big.
In a moment. Tonight. - Are you going to tell me why? The fight with your father. The more public it gets, the more of a burden I put on you.
Don't even say his name! Just tell me where they are. I'm sorry. The timer must have misfired. It wasn't supposed to go off until we got to the fence.
Go back to your work. Bruno. What else do you call this stone? Heliotrope, Bruno. The name comes from the sun. Because it gets its magical powers from the rays of the sun.
- What does the stone look like? It's supposed to be black... - Forgive me for interrupting you, gentlemen. Forgive me. But this magic stone... What about it? - This magic stone, what does it look like?
- What do you want to do? ! - What? Come here! We're having a bath! - A bath? That's right, there's a lake down there! They call it the 'Women's Lake'. That's what the peasants here call it! And why?
- Quit? This project is on shaky ground. How long before the masses recognize it? How long before the mob shows up at your door again? What happens if he doesn't leave this time?
The next time he hears from me will be when I sail with you to the port of Charlestown. If they trap us or refuse the money, I will kill you and throw you into the sea. Do you understand? She writes the letter. It's going to Charlestown before this thing blows up in our faces tomorrow.
What about your speech? Do you need any more good jokes? The ice drill is on its way. Really? Left Oslo this morning, so it'll be here Wednesday.
I have no other choice. You know that. The mines have been mined. There is no other future than tourism, is there? Tourists. That's all the glacier really means to you, doesn't it? It stands for business, staying in business, Charlie. Stores, bars, hotels, restaurants, rentals, camping equipment....
He fell into a bear trap, but he's okay. What? The pulse. Yes? It's right here.
- Yes. And did you also pack the chainsaw? You didn't pack the chainsaw? Go get the chainsaw, man! The cement's not quite dry yet. It should be by tomorrow night. Okay.
It's Vivian. Don't move! Evan? Oh Evan, I'm so sorry I'm late. But that storm blew branches all over town. It even took out two traffic lights!
- No, let him kill me. Because the plague will take me anyway. If this war doesn't kill me first. I must find the eel. He is the last salvation of a very good friend.
Okay, well, that's progress, isn't it? Yeah, I guess. I found it in Stoddart's study. He looked at the pictures himself, but the scan has Pettigrew's name on it. And it's crumpled and rumpled, almost like it's been through many hands.
Really? You've never left the Keys. I went to Orlando once, but it was too cold. You said the perch was fresh. It is fresh.
You've never left the Keys. I went to Orlando once, but it was too cold. You said the perch was fresh. It is fresh. No, it isn't.
I think you're very nice, Lena. Can you hold him? Lift your head! When I was a kid, I used to pretend that I had a dog, a fabulous one! I pretended he went to school with me every morning.
I pretended he walked to school with me every morning. All the way. Yes, all the way. Then I slapped him and sent him home. And he followed!
If you go this way, there is no turning back. I know how you feel. How much you want to go home and enjoy life there in Nassau. But I have to tell you today that this place no longer exists. It was taken from us. By a madman who took it.
Won't be long now. Well then. I think we need more music. This one, Barbara, is especially for you. Billy Fury. He's from Liverpool, too. My boyfriend can't stand him. You have a boyfriend, Trixie?
Slope too strong. With the gusts, we'll soon be at 11 degrees. Roger. Everybody follow Martinez's suit. He'll take you to the airlock.
All the other senior officers were busy, so they sent me. And I go. And I get more out of the snitch in one evening than he did in six months, because I knew what I was talking about. So I write the report. It gets passed around everywhere.
Maybe you should. I can't. I can't go, Charlie's... He knew this place was hard and... merciless. It is... alive... and unsullied... and wild.
All right. They say the mezcal worm is an aphrodisiac. When a man and a woman eat the worm together, their night becomes.... a delirium of ecstasy and... passion. Is that what they say? But it is also said that it causes a grim stimulus to the urinary tract.
- Two. One mechanical, the other digital. If we crack the encryption code, I'll have to drill through six inches of armor steel to shut down the tumbling system. Job's in charge of the encryption code. - It changes every 12 minutes.
Jim. When I bowl, it's a bull's eye and not a ten. My people are not bowling pins, even if your husband treated them that way. Let me finish. If your house is insured, to $100,000 and a tornado sweeps it away, it sweeps away a house.
When I bowl, it's a bull's eye and not a ten. My people are not bowling pins, even if your husband treated them that way. Let me finish. If your house is insured, to $100,000 and a tornado sweeps it away, it sweeps away a house. It doesn't destroy each piece of furniture separately from each other.
You couldn't have done it better! I don't care about the game. I want you to cut off my arm. - Why is that? - Because he's killing me, stupid.
I like to experiment between our crops. Plowing, fertilizing and sowing seeds are the cornerstone of life. However. Give your settlers this plow. Let them test it to see if it works.
All the pain disappears. I'll take your pain. Easy, good boy. There's no more pain. No more pain, it disappears.
Harbard is not a man. Harbard is a god. He came to visit us. And such a visit should always be celebrated. Even if it leads to death?
Harbard is a god. He came to visit us. And such a visit should always be celebrated. Even if it leads to death? If it leads to death, it also leads to life.
Rollo. I have nothing to say to you, priest. Except that... Where's your bracelet? Where is it?
I would like to be alone with my guests. Wait outside, please. I know a way to help you realize the vision of a new Nassau. And I'm willing to walk it. However... ...my plan will require something of you, Mr. McGraw, if it is to succeed.
Well, the thing is, to be honest, Aunt Edda, I know there were problems between you and Mom. I just thought we could get past it now. It's not so convenient now. When would be a better time than Christmas? Christmas is a time of reconciliation, of family, of tradition. If you believe in that and take that spirit into yourself.... It... It fills one...
Listen carefully. You must take the creature back to the grove. But be careful. It won't go willingly. It's developed a taste for humans. What about Will? He won't come back unless you return the changeling. But don't let him know what you're up to. He can sense things.
But be careful. It will not go along voluntarily. It has a taste for humans. What about Will? He won't come back unless you return the changeling. But don't let him know what you're up to. He can sense things. He can't feel threatened.
Your husband blew up a truck last night. - He almost killed my son. - I'm sorry. The timer must have misfired. It wasn't supposed to go off until it hit the fence.
Oh my god! That was awesome! Hold on. You can take a closer look at our Mosasaurus. He has 88 teeth!
How about it? You want to take one home? Hey, don't joke. When I was your age, I rescued a wolf pup. He was just two months old.
Hey, don't make jokes. When I was your age, I rescued a wolf pup. He was just two months old. Could barely walk. He slept next to my bed.
Anyway. He's probably helping with the evacuation. Isn't there another helicopter pilot? We don't need another one. You think he's out there?
He's probably helping with the evacuation. Isn't there another helicopter pilot? We don't need another one. Do you think he's out there? I mean, I know for a fact he's not out there, okay?
That way. (woman) Cabbage buns! Real cabbage! Very fresh... The tower! Where is it now?
Maybe he knows. Heidi, don't! You can't talk to beggars. Heidi! That way. There he is!
- No, you can't say it. Shit! Come on, Geissen! Where's the wheelchair? Heidi, where is it?
Shit! Come on, Geissen! Where's the wheelchair? Heidi, where is it? It's not here.
Heidi, where is he? He's not here. Not here either. (quietly) He can't be gone. - Grandpa, he's not here anymore.
It is not here. Not here either. (quietly) He can't be gone. - Grandpa, he's not here anymore. - What, he's gone?
How does that get back out of the "mumu"? I only know how it goes in. Oh man, Zeki, really. Shake well and then as discussed, Meike. Can he slide into the innards?
- Hello? Not so loud! If anyone overhears! - Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot how important your job is to you. Well, maybe it is now.
My name is... Kunibert Sturm. No. Your name is Wallisch. No. It's Kunibert Sturm.
I won't keep your husband long. Tea? Caraway cake? Oh, she doesn't like caraway cake. He even resists her.
- Not modern magic. - So what? It's not that simple. You would have to negotiate with the trees. They move churches and rivers. Then why not a forest? It's not that big.
I expect the impossible from my people, I see no reason to exempt you. I am at the end of my magic. Find other magic methods! Don't be too hard on yourself. Your fog made him lose the cannon, but it saved our lives.
Megan. We don't have time. There's a tunnel leading west, to an elevator. I know the code. It leads to the facility in the mountains. - To David.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, but this statement makes a mockery of the court. You seem to be the only one laughing, Mr. Minister. Every man has the right to prove his merit. A son does not inherit his father's wisdom simply by wearing his turban. Even a sandalwood tree needs time to age before it produces fragrance.
(A Hindu tradition of blessing) Thank you for the honor, lady. It brightens my mind. Do not forget my Lord... This welcome stops at the threshold, it does not extend to the heart.
-How are you? -Good. And you? I like your hat. It suits you.
And you? I like your hat. It suits you. -You think so? -Yeah, it looks good.
-Show me. -The CIA has intel on him. So, are you going to let me in or not? Strictly speaking, this room is not white. It's more like... dark red.
- I can't. I'm losing control! Control your feelings. There is another way. Don't destroy the talisman. It's too powerful, too important.
Is she all right? - What happened? - What is happening to her? This place needs awareness to balance. And it returns my emotions.
You're flickering. Why are you flickering? You still don't get it, Andy. - We found an altar. - It's miles away. Okay.
It's the only way out. Don't go. There is no place for fear. What is down there, let it break down the walls, let it set you free. - Its fragrance is here, but it is very faint.
- Stop! Aleister could not control us as wolves. What if Clay can turn? Clay? It's him.
Essentia crescat. A skin cell, a strand of hair, that's all I need to create a piece of Aleister. You just can't get used to that. What will this spell accomplish? It will kill Aleister.
- A premonition of something that will happen. - The doom has begun. If we don't kill it by sunrise, all the witches will die. - What will this spell accomplish? - It will kill Aleister.
Come here and say that to my face. Don't get too close! If she gets your blood in this bowl, you'll be dead in seconds. She won't break the circle. It's the only thing protecting her.
Next year, when the plums are ripe, I'll make you some without alcohol. The plums are from our garden? That's right. You can see the tree from here. See it? There it is.
Exactly. You can see the tree from here. Do you see it? There it is. Look, there. It has lots of plums.
Eddie, you know I love you. How could I not? You're genius, you shit gold. And that gold is what the Oscars are made of. But this movie is different. It's human.
How could I not? You're genius, you shit gold. And out of that gold are the Oscars. But this film is different. It's human. It has depth, it's ambiguous.
I can't. - Why not? It's my penis. So what? - My penis is tiny. It became tiny. It was huge and now it's tiny.
Yeah, you're indulging in bullshit right now. Come on. Let's go inside. Where's the bill of sale? I can't find it. - It's in there. Under "L".
I am the fitness trainer. And that was exactly the wrong answer, you stupid fuck! Baby, you're the best. Yes, honey? "Emma's head feels like it's going to explode.
It was forwarded to me. - It's for you. - From the Disciplinary Board? - I'm getting legal advice. - It's not from them.
Anne is replacing all of our chairs with these beanballs. She has a whole truckload full. So I need your chair, Doris. I like my chair. It has a back.
On the way back... I spotted a large bear, down on the shore, watching it drag its catch over the rocks.... and the ice floes. I knew immediately what I was up against. I pulled up closer, grabbed my rifle... and ran down to the shore. The bear... was standing over his prey. And... in a split second, I took aim. I could see that what he was tearing at was not a seal.
Please... help yourself and tell me what you did. Nothing. I swear. I swear before God, I did nothing. The procedure is painful. It's invasive and possibly... unethical.
That's so pretty. I mean, the way the light falls on things. But there's so much I don't remember. It's because of the accident that brought you here. It took away your memory.
I can't imagine anyone has looked in recently. In the 11th century, a Carthusian monk we know only as Brother Gregory gradually lost his mind. He said he was possessed by a demon, perhaps the father of all demons, the fallen angel himself. In any case, this demon spoke to him in the language Verbis Diablo. Brother Gregory wrote what he said on some pad.
- Yes. But I can't remember which one. Pretty, isn't it? We must prepare for battle. If it comes, then with full force and to the bitter end.
And, frankly, they're not very sensible shoes. I am afraid. What terrible things could be hidden in them? Behold the evil one, Lucifer. I don't like to reveal my name. It is beneath contempt.
What do you think of my beard? - Excuse me? - My beard. I've had it ever since I can remember. I don't know if it suits me like this.
Why don't you take this? This is your house now. We need to replenish supplies. I know the forest. It will feed us.
Are you familiar with the neurosis of phantom limb pain? It affects people who have lost an arm or a leg. When I lost my arm, I always wanted to reach out with it. It seemed so real to me. But it wasn't.
Would you like a brandy? The bill is on Duck. Unfortunately, the cancer has spread from the lungs... and has metastasized to the bones. and into the mediastinum. I don't understand what you are saying. It is aggressive and very advanced.
Come by. Just to throw you under a train. Oh, come on. Did I at least get that lousy job? Yes, and it's not lousy.
Sit down. I have some serious news. It's bad news. Your mother is sick. She has lung cancer, and it's very advanced.
Hey! Things are getting grumpy there. Come on. We'd better hurry. Vincent's limitation is too strong, but what Davina and I can do is cast a disruption spell. It would temporarily neutralize all magical objects in this courtyard, including the courtyard.
Driver's license and registration, please. Uh, yes. Yes. I don't have my driver's license with me right now. It's at home.
A very good question. Give it. Crap. Inmate, there have been complaints about moldy rice. Show me where it's kept.
I play Edwina, of course. She does have freckles and a fuller bosom, but we all have an imagination. How do I say this constructively? This text is obscene. It is pornographic.
She has freckles and a fuller bosom, but we all have imagination. How do I say this constructively now? This text is obscene. It's pornographic. No, it is erotically colored.
Maybe later. My back is acting up. You are sweet, my friend. The pain wanders. It goes from the back to the arms and sometimes to the hips.
Remember what happened the last time you told her one of our secrets. Look here. Everything's gonna be okay, all right? We'll do the DNA test. It'll show that he was the father, and then hopefully his laptop will prove that he was on the roof of the frat house.
You want the charges against your client dropped, I understand that, Ms. Keating, but the evidence you are presenting to the Court here today is circumstantial at best. That's only because the main piece of evidence... against Mr. Keating is being withheld by Ms. Parks. I have no idea what she's talking about, Your Honor. My husband's laptop is being held by the police. It most likely contains the cell phone coordinates that prove he was at the Kappa Kappa Thetas house the night of the murder.
Oh, it's from his grandmother! My engagement ring is gone! I lost it! - What is it? - It's fake
Of course I do. I gave it to my husband on our wedding day. Any idea why we found it in the woods? I'm on it. Of course, I don't know how it ended up there.
My turn. Of course, I don't know how he ended up there. Right. There was also a fingerprint found on the ring. Do you know who it belongs to?
Bye, kids! I love you. - Bye, Mom, see you tonight. It's unlikely that a meteorite with a diameter of 10,010 kilometers would fall to Earth. But it doesn't have to be that big, 10 kilometers would be enough.
Keep your scissors off my carpet! Okay, okay. I'll put the spices in alphabetical order then. No, they're in order of use. Leave the allspice in the back where it belongs.
- That's it. - The consistency is killing me. I can't get around it. And there's this weird metallic taste. Is it metallic?
You found out that your best friend was going to be your son-in-law and that went a little too far. - You've gone off the deep end. - Stop. Hold this position! The angle of the brush, it had to have been swung at Javier from above by someone bigger, but if Javier had been on the bottom step....
It's not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, is it? It's not going to be some bald guy with horns ripping my heart out. Dude, this movie is an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians. - You love this movie. - Yeah, it's pretty awesome.
You name it, we do it. Basket weaving at the craft museum. Well, you said it. Oh, here's another one. I'd like the apple pancake mix to be on the top shelf because it starts with an "A", but I'm not putting it there because I don't want you to break one of your little legs making my breakfast.
I return the pot, unfortunately a little burnt. My goodness! How could you! You can buy a new one. I'll kill you, Janka, what should I do with it? Throw it away, it's easy to replace.
Yes, sir, my father mined earth and rock, and he said sometimes.... His tools! He said sometimes the sky drops a rock on the earth, a rock full of riches. It lies north of the rampart.
Are you sure? Look. The Druids prophesied a good omen in the sky. And it came to pass. A dragon has returned to our land, and I believe it brought you to us.
Look. The Druids prophesied a good omen in the sky. And it came to pass. A dragon has returned to our land, and I believe it brought you to us. He saved your life.
Connected, just as Merlin said. When you die, the dragon dies too. So precious. Brude chose the moon as his spirit guide. When it sets, at dawn, its power is weakest.
Good evening. I am Noah Meluban, method developer at the Secret Service. I bought these secateurs at a gardening store. I added nails to the edges. I learned at Cambridge that the penis has such elastic tissue that it heals instantly.
That way, nothing can be proven. Shall we have a little chat about you? I smashed it. He smashed it. Bring me the computer, even if it's broken.
Believe me, it's great. Why do we always go in the back door? Because we've never used the front entrance of our house. Why not? - Because it would get dirty.
- Son of a bitch! You're trying to understand what happened. If you don't let me, you'll never know. - I'm losing my mind! - No, it's just expanding.
Ok, ok. But you know where the penis belongs, right? - In your mouth. - In the vagina. It belongs in your mouth.
Jesus. Please... He's on his way, okay? The check. In case... if he doesn't show up by Tuesday,
Let's do it right now. Kurt, why don't you take out your old giant cock and stick it right in her. - How about it? - Enough. You don't need any more circles. - Because it's big.
- Get to the point. - What point? The reason you are here. Your visit does not mean anything good. It means something very good for you.
- Thank you. - Thank you. - Take the head with you. - If you don't mind. - It may be useful to me.
Aunt Dorothy, it's so good to see you. Well, your sister is no Mother Teresa, but at least she stops by once in a while to make sure I'm still alive. Where's the eggnog? I need to get in the mood. He's in the kitchen.
I want to rewrap these gifts for the kids. It's important. The snowplow? The keys were in it, and the car was demolished. But if it works, I'll drive here, then everyone gets in the car and follows me while I clear ahead.
You are tense. - No, not at all. - Yes, you are. Your chest. It goes up and down like a piston.
- I know the way. It's genius, your lipstick. What did you say? I said, "It's genius, your lipstick." It doesn't leave color on cigarettes.
Me? I am on the side of love. That's the way I am. To be able to choose, you have to love war. It has always taken away what was dearest to me.
I killed them. I had to. How was Ron's place? What do you think of this place? Well, I think it seems... ...nice.
And it was open. I asked Gabriel to close it. Go! I didn't let him in. He came in by himself, all by himself.
That does not suit you. What do you want? It's your birthday tomorrow. I like to receive my gifts earlier. That way the special day lasts longer because it starts a day earlier.
Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn't deserve his own joke. Is that really true? Of course, that's how you can tell a good joke. It not only entertains, it also teaches.
It will be humiliating. Now we already have two reasons. They have him. - Please, may we look at him? - Please? All right, but I tell you, he's terrible.
And if that doesn't work out, hint that his mother is having fun with a series of human and non-human lovers. Sheldon, my name is also on the publication. There would be nothing positive about doing that. He just made another comment. What does he say?
Oooo! Okay, hopefully one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear. Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? It looks like their suitcase arrived in Los Angeles. Where is it?
I've got it! And this is already the key to the door? That's it? We spent $200 for six minutes of fun? Like when we bought that remote control helicopter and it just flew away.
I think I suspected it was going to be a bad movie when I read the script and saw the title: Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey Sees, Monkey Kills. Uh, spoiler alert: when the monkey sees someone, he kills them.
It really is. Oh, you guys are so sweet. Penny, listen, I saw your movie. Oh, wow. I wish it was better.
and complain about the horrible music the children listen to. It's terrible, isn't it? Listen to that noise. Wait, wait. It works.
We did not. No, we didn't. Can I talk to you alone for a minute? Oh, sure. It's from Tiffany's.
Much better! Will you come, please? My man'? The Camino takes all your strength... and gives it back to you threefold. And to all those who cannot walk the Camino: Rest assured, this path is only one of infinite possibilities. It is not one, but a thousand paths.
Will you come, please? My husband'? The Camino takes all your strength... and gives it back to you threefold. And to all those who cannot walk the Camino: Rest assured, this path is only one of infinite possibilities. It is not one, but a thousand paths. But to each one he asks only one question: "Who are you?"
Who is Hape'? That's my grandson! My boy... Our boy! Sooner or later, this path shakes everyone to the core. You must walk it alone. Otherwise, he will not reveal his secret.
- Bienvenidos a Santiago. - Gracias. Something inside me rang a gigantic gong. And the sound will reverberate. I know it will slowly get quieter.
- Where are you taking me? - Home. The Boltons are holding Winterfell. The proposal... ...it wasn't for you?
It is her name that I need, not her chastity. Then I have delivered everything I promised. And you have prepared yourself for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear that I have married Sansa Stark to Ramsay. The Lannister name won't mean what it used to.
My father, who publicly condemned me to death? I think his thoughts regarding my executions were clearly evident. Is that why you killed him? One day, when you have decided not to execute me, I will tell you all about my father's murder. And on that day, if it ever comes, we will need more wine.
There are many factors. Resentment doesn't have to be one of them. You know what? Until you showed up here, I wasn't sure. Thanks for helping me decide. Wave to your cash cow... ...before he disappears off the lawn.
Do you think I'm only seeing therapists to save 875 crowns per session? That offends me very much. May I continue now? Without interruption? I try to hug this bird, but it avoids me.
- What kind of tower? - The stork tower. There was a stork when my sister and I were little. It just disappeared. I hope it will come back.
It wasn't my hatred that kept me going, but my love.... So far on "Falling Skies".... Ever since I woke up with the spikes, I've been... attracted to you. The Espheni energy core had never originally been on Earth. It powers the entire Espheni war machine.
It's not a tight little chamber that smells like acetone. Room to grow. There's room to dream big. There's a big conference room. Not as big as Hamlin's.... but it's comfortable.
How do we start now? Shall we sign this document? I am very sorry, but I cannot take your case. My schedule is just... It's already overflowing.
Regain your strength. So, you stay down. And it's okay. I'll be there. This night I had a dream. Next week we'll talk about economic concepts.... It felt so real, even though I knew it couldn't be, or wasn't yet.
Like he's catching a ball.... He just stretches out his arms.... So, everybody's out now, and I thought: How the hell is the pilot going to get out now? But he maneuvers away to the left side and hovers there as long as he can, we learn later, to take off his flight suit. Somehow he rolls the bird to the side and before it hits the water, he jumps.
Why are you staring out the window, Will? Do you like the snow? For some people, snow triggers a very specific feeling. Some people like it. It feels clean and pure to them, like a new beginning, a start.
Do you like the snow? For some people, snow triggers a very specific feeling. Some people like it. It feels clean and pure to them, like a new beginning, a start. For others, it's scary.
Without the right medication, she will soon be dead. When you buy medicine in this country, you never know if it's real or adulterated. The doctors told me that it will make your mother feel better right away. And what do I have to do for that? All you have to do is watch that backpack and make sure it gets to this address before midnight.
It seems the boy is coming. Let's get you inside. Jenny, it feels like breech. He's in the wrong position. The head should be down here, but it's up there.
"Pale Death visits with impartial foot "the huts of the poor and the castles of the rich." They were created for Mary Stuart. A real joker. I don't mind death as long as it's out in the open.
We must be able to hold everyone in the government accountable. But we must not exploit our interpretation of the law to weaken the constitutional position of the president. We can replace presidents, but not the institution of the presidency. We should have known this was going to happen. We must stop their campaign before it begins.
Yes, completely. Yes, ma'am, we are having power issues here as well. It is most likely related to the storm. Parrish. Check the backup generator and make sure it's fully fueled.
Of course, it's just a drop in the bucket. Everyone I know has had problems. I had one. The computer in the engine quit in the middle of the Rockies. It just overheated.
It's all right, I forgive you. You got me now. Gigs, can we shut down that pesky robot? Can't, sir. It's got an inexhaustible helium-3 battery.
Battle Creek is even a step below Boise. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Right here... I think I got something. - Boy, somebody must really hate you. - Looks like a print, but... it's different than any I've ever seen.
It is the ring of the Magi. - Where is the ring? - I don't see any ring. The five virgins are your fingers, and the snake is the sacred ring. - You know where it is.
And the ring? He didn't seem to know anything about the ring. - But that was a lie, wasn't it? - Yes. I'm relatively sure he knows where it is.
- Do you know what that means? - Don't you? - No. - And you expect me to believe that? - Where is he?
- Installment? - Installment? How, if he doesn't know? - He knows. - Why is he important? - He belonged to King Aegeus.
What have you been up to? You look so different. You still look the same. Good, you found my backpack. Yes, it was in the storeroom.
An attack on a Spanish citizen would have dangerous consequences. They will never let you leave here with the machine. Perales will take care of it. I have never understood irrational hatred. It stifles any shred of decency and common sense.
Now, come on. - You don't even know my name. - Because I'm not interested. I'll give you a hint. It's not Anna or Your Majesty.
They did not come from God. - I revoke them. - They incited you against us. This holy war was a product of my imagination. It can only lead you to death.
Your great reputation could help fund the new kink. The backers expect you to.... to perform miracles in the operating room. - Not that you're glued to the microscope. - You'd be wasting your time. Why should drug abuse justify scientific study? Because it needs to be cured and treated like any other disease.
- 3 weeks ago you defeated him! He was down faster than you today! The fight was rigged. - How's that, friend? - It was rigged.
I paid you with heroin. Excuse me. Everybody knew you were the famous Dr. Thackery. You call that a gold earring? It was my mother's.
- When was this done? - Last week. It must be removed. How? It has affected the entire esophagus.
It must be removed. And how? It has affected the entire esophagus. Surgery would rip out her throat. But it can't stay in there.
I am with you. 100%! You don't have to do anything or go anywhere. That was the war... it affected all of us.
- Hey. You want to save your reputation? Tell us everything. We had not distributed the samples "on a test basis" on the market. We lost a packet of substances at the post office. But we didn't circulate the substance, it wasn't ready for the market.
- You're right, I did. Why don't you just get out of my office and go laugh somewhere else? Are you going to hit me now? Yeah, well, why don't you ask Mike Ross about my chokehold? Because he's a fucking vice.
- I've been working for seven hours because if I tell Harvey what's going on before I have a solution, he'll pull the plug. Well, then maybe the plug should be pulled. Rachel, Joe Henderson being a crappy plaintiff doesn't mean they didn't cover up anything. It also doesn't mean that they did. Okay, fine. Why would he bring up that report if he knew it was going to hurt our case?
An intelligent woman, your mother. You make all the moves, but strangely enough, she wins all the games. You sent a man to Minos' camp. The Dorian. A bold move. - Was it a success?
Where are they? Seems to me we're alone, brother. A bronze bull? I need two hundred men and four thousand swords to melt it down. Of course, I need all the craftsmen, carpenters and rough smiths to finish it after five days and nights.
Three? General Kastor, give Daedalus what he needs. Majesty, how is the bronze bull supposed to open the gates of Athens? Isn't it obvious? He will break through them.
I'm cutting you, Athenian. Step back. I need help. Where did you get that bird? It flew into my room, sire.
- Why? - Because I am premed. But why do you want to be a doctor? Do you even know the satisfaction level of a doctor today? - It's about 5%.
Know what? Whether you're the cat or the mouse? Remember that video of the bobcat taking the shark out of the ocean? That's sick. And until that moment, I bet the shark thought it was the apex predator.
He probably watched the smearing with a bucket of popcorn, but.... What's up? You all right? My son, his name is Walt. I'm sorry, Sam. I'm sure he was with a friend of his, some punk who wants to be a priest. Said he hadn't heard from Walt.
I still have scars on my stomach from the burns. Stop it! Fucking monsters. I'm sorry. The locker room made my father the man he is, but it also made me the woman I am today.
He was my husband, but I couldn't say goodbye. But now you have. I don't think it's possible. Death doesn't let you say goodbye. It just cuts holes in your life, in your future, in your heart.
Are you coming to the game? - Are you going? - All the girls in the village are going. They have organized a bus. - Where does it leave from?
Its origin is European, yes. The cages can only be opened at the top, yes? As you wish. - And the incinerator? - It is prefabricated elsewhere.
Who do you know that hates you so much? I have no idea. You don't want me here, I don't want to be here, so why don't you drop me off at the next port and I'll go my own way. What? If a kill order is issued, it is guaranteed.
- What do you want to know? - Could you tutor me? It's easier if I do it. There's a doctor, Joseph Rawlings. He changed his name when he came over from England in 2007. - It's Richardson now.
- It is the truth. You didn't fill out the PGP. I didn't fill out what? The repair form... The repair form to overhaul this old barge before it breaks apart.
Hi, Dagny. God, you're beautiful. Famous words to a succubus. The last thing your mother told me was your name. It means "new day."
It found us. Don't be afraid, Clarke. Death is not the end. We're not going to die here. I need your spirit where it is.
Good. And your mother wanted to be here, too. I know, but the wounded in Tondc need her more. Field commanders, today is the great day when we repeat our people. The enemy thinks he is safe, but he is not.
And your mother wanted to be here too. I know, but the wounded in Tondc need her more. Field commanders, today is the great day when we repeat our people. The enemy thinks he is safe, but he is not. As soon as he realizes that, he will strike back. Hard.
My name is Alie. How do you know my name? Thelonious. That's a beautiful name. It has a double meaning.
We don't know if I need to be in direct contact with her. We only know that we need her. No, no. We only know that he says we need her. We don't even know what he's asking us to do with the blade. We play it safe, we learn this spell, how it works, and we keep the blade away from me.
These questions of good and evil are important, but inappropriate in court. Only facts count there. My client claims to have acted in self-defense. Mr. Prohaszka's companions refuse to testify to the incident. The young woman, who was also a witness, testified that my client seemed nice and that she only noticed the fight when it was already in progress.
Mama, make him stop ♪ ♪ Tommy, if you don't put that stick down ♪ ♪ I'm gonna bother you with it, boy, be quick ♪ ♪ come quick, Sammy Jean stuck her finger in a Coke bottle ♪ ♪ won't bring it out 'cause it's stuck, stuck, stuck ♪
Peg had some kind of - emergency and.... - Well... That check you gave me for the down payment. Yes? It bounced.
Let's say by Friday. If you don't have the money, I'll sell to him. The other buyer. Like I said, he's in Sleepy Eye. Check out the meat grinder, it's making funny noises.
- I have it in my head all the time. - What? What book? It's about a guy who rolls a boulder up a hill every day. A boulder like this. And then every night he rolls it back down.
No! Then, killing both friend and foe, it became clear that Hanzee was on a mission. To find the beautician and silence her butcher's assistant husband and her once and for all. The question of why has puzzled historians for years. It is true that they saw him execute Dodd Gerhardt, and they were the only ones left who could reveal his treachery for what it was.
I am not afraid. What did you do? It took a while, but I healed you, brought you back from the dead, using this. Your pendant. You said it would protect me.
Listen, D, no one in this town is safe since that witch Dahlia showed up. Klaus is completely out of control and trusts no one. He's keeping the only weapon that works against this witch to himself. If everything goes wrong, we might need that dagger. Kol gave it to me for my protection. So I will decide if it is to be used.
- What have you done to me? - Hope's blood is in you now. You are the bait. This body is still connected to Davina and the children. He dies when I leave him, and Davina and the others with him.
In my youth, there was peace between wolves and witches. A voodoo priestess showed me how to use herbs to determine if there was magic. You combine Solomon's seal and lion's mouth and light it. If white smoke rises, the air is pure. If it's black, there's a curse in the air. And if it's red, you're in real trouble.
Then I remembered what I could read in your thoughts. Since you vowed to be there for each other, forever and ever. There is power in such vows. Believe me, it has had its consequences. That's an understatement. That vow has brought more trouble than it's worth.
In every moment, a choice exists. We can cling to the past, or embrace the inevitability of change.... and allow a better future to unfold before us. Such a doubtful future may require doubtful allies. Either way, a new day will come whether we like it or not. The question is, will you control it, or will it control you?
Sometimes you control the demon. This is my house! Are you okay? Other days they control you. And he's always hungry.
This is my house! Are you okay? Other days they check you. And he's always hungry. He feeds on lust, on desire.
Other days, they control you. And he is always hungry. He feeds on lust, on desire. And while you slumber, the demon never sleeps. He tempts you to cross every boundary you have set....
And he is always hungry. He feeds on lust, on desire. And while you slumber, the demon never sleeps. He tempts you to cross every boundary you've set.... And while he chases you... haunts you.... he makes you unable to distinguish between friend and foe....
He feeds on lust, on desire. And while you slumber, the demon never sleeps. He tempts you to cross every boundary you've set.... And while he chases you... haunts you.... he makes you unable to distinguish between friend and foe.... But once he has turned your lovers into enemies, the demon will consume you completely.
Well come on then, let's get you back into your real body, although I'd like to torture Esther and Freya into doing that, I'm sure that would be very funny. No, Nik. I'll stay where I am. Eva is gone forever, but her body, this body is still connected to Davina and the children. I can feel it and if I leave it, it will die and Davina and the others will die with it.
NARRATOR: What's happened so far: we take Hope and the pack, and we leave tonight. WOMAN: This body is still connected to Davina and the children. If I leave it, it dies, and Davina and the others with it.
Looks like a VIP area. - Probably where they're holding Tatsu. - There are big musclemen in front of the door. This club is a front for the Triad. - It will be heavily guarded.
This club serves as a front for the Triad. - It will be heavily guarded. - But you'll do whatever it takes to get them back? Yes, I will. I told you it would be heavily guarded.
I will be careful. - I love you, sweetheart. - I love you too, daddy. One of the councilmen has a pacemaker. - If it can be programmed from the outside...
I am not afraid of this man and neither should you be. He should be afraid of us. Then we'll stay. Your helicopter's back on the roof. But it turns out... he does have keys.
That definitely comes from your mother's side of the family. It's pretty amazing how much Malcolm has taught you in a short period of time. Yes. He's the father of the year. Your fighting style... it reminds me a little of Sara.
Was I unclear? - We are listening to him. For now. Guys, I activated an environmental alarm to detect unauthorized access to this level. He's going off like crazy.
I go through footage from traffic and surveillance cameras at the remaining three sites. No movement. Nice clothes. Thank you. Felicity, the briefcase is empty. It's empty!
Well, the fractions indicate that the door had zero viscoelasticity when it hit the floor. - What does that mean for normal people? - Sorry. The steel shattered like glass. It was frozen, Joe. Snart.
Two of the victims in critical condition have died. Forensics have already been completed. There is no physical evidence to suggest sabotage. Witnesses didn't notice anyone - who was in or near the computer room. - Which doesn't mean it wasn't hacked.
I hate to bash your hacking rumors, but this PC was not hacked remotely. - You sound absolutely convinced. - Because I am. It is physically impossible for this computer to get on the Internet. It's completely air-gapped.
- You sound absolutely convinced. - Because I am. It is physically impossible for this computer to get on the Internet. It's completely air-gapped. To make sure no one can get in, they made sure it didn't have Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
Wait, wait, what about the no eating rule? Oh, that's for everybody else. Okay, so I always order a Large and Tasty at the sub store around the corner, with bacon, but the Large and Tasty is not with bacon. Something you can only know if you're familiar with the menu. The bacon is disguised because it looks like part of the sandwich.
All the time? Not even an accident? You never know, maybe someone who knew you saw you? The only thing I can think of is one night when I thought a car was following us. It parked at the motel behind us and was still there when we came back out.
He parked at the motel behind us and was still there when we came back out. Danni thought I was being paranoid. Did you get the license plate? - No. - Make, model? It was a little red, maybe burgundy, small car.
After Iris took off her bracelet, it was like something happened. Iris told me her parents forced her to wear it. - The bracelet is made of adamantium. - We don't need your help. If the bangle is made of the same material as the box, it could also keep her in check.
Bo, your hand. Nyx is gone. The bracelet worked. No. It didn't.
Harlan. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Please remain seated. How's your lobster? It tastes like it was caught this morning.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. Please remain seated. How is your lobster? It tastes like it was caught this morning. Well, it was.
An insect lacks the morality to wrestle with death. Will wrestles with death because of inevitable changes. Almost anything can be trained to resist its instinct. A sheepdog does not protect the sheep. But he wants to.
We just lost the signal. Richard Davis must be coming towards us. We've got to track him somewhere. Nelson, get a cell phone catcher. It'll pick up any cell phone signal within a mile.
He deserves the truth. This time next week, I'll have a real office in the back. - You here for your paycheck? - Yeah. Great. I think it's by the cash register.
Are you sure about that? Otherwise, why could you have trusted Elizabeth Barton so much? Because when she speaks, she is inspired. I have seen with my own eyes a golden letter sent to her by Mary Magdalene. - Yes... In fact, it was written by Father Bocking.
What are you up to, Frank? I'm leaving soon. And I'm signing this place over to you. All of it. It's yours.
Stronger. It gives you something that most people don't have. As bad as it is, as unfair as it is, that suffering makes you a better person. That's what pain does to you. It shows you what you're made of.
For no sensible reason. At least now I know why. I don't know where your bed is, so you'll sleep here for now. Before it's too late... Kill the dragon. He's getting closer and closer.
At least now I know why. I don't know where your bed is, so you'll sleep here for now. Before it's too late... Kill the dragon. He's getting closer and closer. He's getting closer and closer.
Why doesn't Igor come and get you? If he doesn't come, you know what that means. Did you say "I do" to each other? Because by then the dragon appeared. Then I guess he won't come.
Not so different. We should have sat down at your house in Baltimore, just the three of us. You would have been the guest of honor. But the menu was wrong. Yes, it was.
The teacup is broken. It will not put itself back together again. Not even in your head? Your mind palace is expanding. It's... It's full of new things.
It will not put itself back together again. Not even in your head? Your mind palace is expanding. It's... It's full of new things. It shares rooms with my own.
I was... I was just coming to see you. Oh, yeah? What for? I wanted to celebrate your rescue with you. Then join me in a cup of wine to clear the air. It's from my best vine.
The profit is divided fairly among us. Four shares, instead of five. Leland? What do you want me to do, go up against the three of you? My head stays where it is.
They take care of the logistics. Questions? Yes. Why not at night, when no one is on the road? Quite simply, a state only breaks with Turkey when it is terribly afraid.
You are all responsible for this! He could have braced himself, saved himself. No more doubt. He had been waiting for this day for twenty years. And now, finally, it came.
Their past doesn't matter. People start from scratch in New York, and that's difficult. You can't make a judgment! Your biggest accomplishment so far is buying this lipstick, which I need you to lend me. It's stunning.
I will find out who is responsible for this. I swear to you. The king is dying. He has been poisoned. I'll try to find out more. This is Rochefort's plan, and it's well advanced.
The investigation is ongoing, Although we did not find a body. The amount of blood in the house suggests that the victim's wounds were fatal. Mona Vanderwaal was murdered. They know the coffin's empty, right? It's a coffin, and it still weighs a ton.
Many things have happened in your life. - Do you want to talk about it? - No. I have a letter here from the rescued man. Read it. It's very touching. - Let's see where he is.
I have thought of you often and follow what the movement is doing. It's incredible what you've achieved. What are you fighting for today? Who are you living with? What has become of you? I live in the south now, on my own farm. It's small, but it's mine.
If people would still recognize me on the street, which is not the case. Mostly at book signings, which I don't recommend when you're writing your book. I'm not here to discuss my book with you. - No? - I want to discuss yours. I'm working on a text and it's not going to be printed unless I get a comment from the White House.
I will be awake for three whole days when this hurricane hits. I need to sleep as much as I can. That's a good idea. I'll let you sleep. Have one of the stewards wake me up when he gets to shore.
I'll let you sleep. Have one of the stewards wake me when he gets to shore. Francis. Francis? Where has he arrived?
Francis? Where did he arrive? - Nowhere. - What? The hurricane's turned. It's drifted east now.
Where did he arrive? - Nowhere. - What? The hurricane has turned. It's drifted east now. It could hit Bermuda.
- Nowhere. - What? The hurricane has turned. It's drifted east now. It could hit Bermuda. But it's going to dissipate quickly now as it reaches colder water.
And this Nazi garbage here. What is it? They were in his trash can. He claims that these notebooks don't belong to him. And that leads to the question of whether this arrest was legal at all. Maybe somebody didn't want to wait until the warrant was issued. This is ridiculous. Should we have just left while he was burning all that garbage?
Go, Belle, find Angelina! Go on, find her! She can't smell anything through the smoke. The compass is wet. It's ruined.
Just make the bomb think it has already exploded. I can't even change one letter from a single line of code. I've never seen anything so complex. - So we're back to the manhunt. - Hey, Krummy, take a look at this code. - It was just added four hours ago.
- Do you have a better idea, Nelson? - As a matter of fact, yes. I saw an exploit on Tobin's site. It's a malware that turns off the ringer on phones. It needs an update for the code to run on a tablet.
- You're not that smart. You're one step above a script kiddie. Hey, I was going to try to help you, but if you're questioning my abilities.... It's incredibly sophisticated code. It shows a huge bug of the Public Electric printers.
- No, Michelle is not going anywhere. Maybe she isn't. But Devon does. So this office printer wasn't connected to the same network as the others? No, it was. Then how come it wasn't burned?
Maybe not. But Devon did. So this office printer wasn't connected to the same network as the others? No, it was. Then why wasn't it burned? Was it offline or disconnected?
Plus, my taste buds are half dead, just like the rest of me. Dr. C., I hear you have a John Doe for me. He's right over here, Detective. I'll never understand how anyone can eat down here. I also left my coffee on the stairs so it wouldn't taste like a morgue.
First you have to look the part. Come on. Golden has something on this username Chubb182. The guy's name is Larry Gerald. He's linked to a show-us-your-powers user account.
Listen. These things... ...connect all the cocoons together... and they're all coming from up there. Julie, I'm scared! This cocoon is different. It's bigger.
It was in this dive in Marrakech. Your big friend kept buying me drinks, but I only had eyes for you. His name. What was his name? I think his name was James.
I think yeah great, knowing how well you've done in school so far. As far as I remember last time, you had applied for some internships, - which I found.... - I'm not giving the ring back. Aiden gave it to me with the promise that we would spend the rest of our lives together. Formally, that means it's not an engagement ring...and according to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Lindh v. Surma....
We should change our appearance. - Smile. What's wrong with you? That hat makes you look different. Do you like it?
Okay, I've had enough. Goodbye, ladies and gentlemen, the end has come! Damn it! Did you lose something? You know what I love about a good apple pie? It can't be too sweet.
I'll write you a check. I know, guys. This is pure luxury. I don't care about that. You know, a golden cage may be golden, but it's a cage.
The Santa Muerte were dead. You really have the devil in you. I'm just trying to keep him in this prison. As long as I'm in here, I can't cast him out. All he has to do is wait.
At least try. Damn John Constantine. The center of attention again. This demon will try to use our weaknesses against us. When he shows himself, don't listen to him.
Right now I'm more worried about April's heart than mine. Did you get the tapes from the hospital camera? Yeah, okay. I borrowed the getaway car. Close to 102 and Lex. - It was just returned.
Not many snipers can hit with such accuracy from that distance. That should narrow it down, shouldn't it? I wish. Truth is, the shooter could have been anyone. These Bittakers can call any of their contacts for a kill. The shooter could be any nationality, - he could be any age... - Nah, he's local.
Obviously, he wanted a transfer to Arkham. BULLOCK: Really good work, Ed. What's this Buttinski guy like? His name is Buchinsky.
We'll get it. - Yes, and we have 17 hours to do it. - I love the name. It's catchy. It's got drama. "The Electric Judge."
Don't be angry. Such good news. My boy has a club. Will have a club. I still have a few things to sort out, but he'll be mine soon.
- Yes. I got suspended, so I guess we won't see each other again. That's why I wanted to return the pencil. I took it from your office and I always wanted to return it. It used to be longer.
And without control, your death by Maroni is no longer a hypothesis, but a done deal. That's why I want to reopen it. Under your direction. I can have the club? - It's mine?
The days are over when you sniffed after Maroni. You belong to me now. Officially. A lot of things are gonna change. Fix this place up, make it run.
If she comes home and leaves him, this Pappone, then I will consider your offer. Madam, she'll be home for Sunday mass. I give you my word. This place is worthless. It's a shithole. It has immeasurable value, Gabe.
And what else? The charity ball? Presumably to get close to Mr. Bunderslaw? Selina stole the key to his safe. I was there today, it was empty.
I thought the values were wrong, had assembled the thing wrong. Was struggling with this... Something is wrong with the data in my head. What are you trying to say? I've been thinking about how the heart monitor seems to have shattered from the inside out. But when we found you, it was still on your wrist.
It's Bobbi, she set off some kind of EMP. She's gone. Mack is too. He put a scanner in little Lola's engine. It was programmed to find anything made of vibranium.
You can't be serious. Can you hear him? No, not the stone. The mountain. He's the loudest thing here.
Right. Because I haven't thought of that yet. At least your sarcasm still works. You disabled the arm. It doesn't work.
It will be easier if we are together. Go. Find him. This is it. He's here.
Did you know she was an Inhuman? You both were. So you of all people should understand why they want to keep her whereabouts a secret. What they're so afraid of. The hold is secure. Or as safe as it can be when there's a teleporter involved.
Are you done indexing Lincoln? Yes. But, um, actually, I wanted to... well, I thought you'd like that. Snagged it off the bus before it crashed.
I have learned this more painfully than most. And now I am ready to accept it. It is not my task to lead, but to enlighten. I have seen the future and your plan. Is it successful?
The one from S.H.I.E.L.D.? - No. Your path led us here. - You started this war. This war started decades ago when S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded to protect the world from people like us. And it will never end.
She said she was going to hide me, but she lied. She was gonna turn me in to the cops. You trust me? Did you kill Bug? This place, nobody knows where it is.
It's funny. Howard Stark gets a lot of stuff stolen. Cars, bombs, death rays. Actually, the death ray isn't gone. It's in Nevada, I think.
Mrs. Vistain, with your husband.... - Was this your first marriage? - Arthur? God, no, that was my third. I kept his name because it sounded so aristocratic.
No. But it can cause him to stumble. Irritate him to the point of making the decisive mistake. I'm working on something that might help finish off that baldy. No, you better keep your head down until it's over. My head stays where it is.
Very good. It's about time. And, uh... - Where's my ring? - It's gone.
The heirs to the throne of our royal house are shielded from the outside world. I had, of course, as many toys and clothes as I wanted. And daily lessons from my teachers. But beyond that, nothing. One day, when I was eight years old, this stone was thrown through my window. It hit a cup by my bed.
- Yes, but... Oracle. - Can I kiss you? - No. No? If the kiss is meaningless, it doesn't work.
- No. No? If the kiss is meaningless, it doesn't work. Why? What should it mean?
No, it must have something to do with the ring. May I look at it again? The clay. That's why Hermes called it "the sound." It makes a sound. In our world, sound is harmless. But in this speed of time, we have to be careful with it.
It makes a sound. In our world, the sound is harmless. But in this speed of time, we have to be careful with it. Unless... - What are you saying? - That sound shook the temple. It moves so fast that the vibration of the sound makes the earth shake.
- That was just a rumble. - Were you in Sylmar in 1971? I was, and I saw a tree hit a boy. - Really? - It was a garden gnome. But he looked like a little boy.
What happened so far... - The core is dead. - It is irreparable.
Contrary to what you may have heard, Colonel Foster has not found a cure for the epidemic. This is the mutation of the virus in 2033, a second iteration of the original epidemic. Foster uses the first mutation, not the current one, as the basis for his research. But the virus mutated two more times after 2033. Now... it is a unique microorganism, something that seems quite alien. Something we will probably never fully understand.
Now... it is a unique microorganism, something that seems quite alien. Something we will probably never fully understand. His vaccine won't work. Foster lied. Why? Because it gives him hope for his people. Just like he gave you hope.
I'll show you. Then take a look at it. What is this? It's our salvation. The virus isn't finished with us yet, Mr Cole. It's gonna keep mutating until even the immune aren't safe from it.
Comes with. It took years to put it together, with every server, processor still intact, as well as every hard drive within 800 km. We created a gigantic network with a single function. The point was to find a cure for the epidemic. As it mutates, the virus cannot be rendered harmless.
Safe, clean, well organized. - They want the cure. - The mutations are unpredictable. Foster has a room full of computers, that's why they need the core. They claim they can predict when the virus will change and find a cure whenever it mutates.
Pretending to be a psychic. I have lots of balls in the air. Yet here I am, getting ready for a date. The last time I sweated picking out an outfit was the night Major proposed. Of course, I did it five nights before the proposal because I was sure he would come.
They say the poison has disfigured it. It's better that you don't see it. It's my fault. The abortifacients... We'll plant this tree on the grave. It will grow big and strong with the baby's breath.
We have to get rid of them. No. The witness has spoken. She's too important to us. The bus has been out of service since 2011. Before that, it served a dozen companies as a refrigerated truck.
The witness has spoken. It is too important for us. The bus has not been in service since 2011. Before that, it served a dozen companies as a refrigerated truck. It served as a hearse, a horticultural truck, even an ice cream truck.
I am glad to have met you. The viral strain M-510 originated from the remains discovered during a private nuclear sample expedition in the Himalayas in the 1980s. From the preserved tissue, we extracted a previously unknown pathogen that we genetically modified at Markridge into this weapon, which we will use in Chechnya during Operation Troy. If released, the virus would kill everyone in the room within two or three hours. Leland said it could be controlled. Yes.
The monkeys are after me. I have the virus. Do not open that case. Sure, but I need to know how to disarm it. It's gotta be in here somewhere.
Dr. Peters, you know Dr. Railly. - We have met. - What do you have to say for yourself? This virus is the most deadly ever conceived. If there's even the slightest possibility that it could fall into the wrong hands...
You look too young for that. That's what most people tell me. Are you watching the accelerator being fired up tonight? I wouldn't miss it for anything. They say it's going to change the world.
Not since the night. Bar? That mirror-- remember it? Yes. It was my grandma's.
Bar? This mirror--Remember? Yes. It was my grandma's. Why is it still here?
But for us, there is no such thing. You'll always risk your life to help other people, and I'll always be the guy who runs into the pipeline for you. The quantum unifier. He was used to separate you once. Maybe he could be useful for keeping you you.
Well, you don't look too bad yourself. Am I being punked right now? What do you think? I can't believe this. The day started out pretty awful, but now it's turning into something pretty damn good.
I guess he's hoping for that. So, what's next? In your last letter, you said you had something big in mind for when you got out. I've had 20 years to work out the perfect prank. It's going to be my masterpiece.
Discharge in three, two, one. Barry. Joe. There goes the defibrillator. It's completely fried.
- We will save them both, Iris. I promise you. Wait. I put a homing device in the tranquilizer dart you used to shoot Grodd. - Once it's activated...
