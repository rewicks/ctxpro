Oatmeal with... low-fat almonds. Let me guess. They only have wholefoods? - From outside? - No, from AMP. Why don't you apply it directly to my thighs?
Real gold. No! Ethan was good to me. He always shared his food. Do you still have it in your mouth?
Mordred murdered the Wizard King and took his staff to the holy tower, where he freed the dark forces of their union. But what they didn't count on was the sword. Merlin stole the staff. He then forged the great sword, Excalibur, and destroyed the ancient tower. The sword was then entrusted to the Lady of the Lake, who associated it with the Pendragon lineage.
Come on, let's go. Run! Down with Vortigern! You seem to have found a way to use the sword. I wasn't controlling it.
- How does it work? - Basically, it's a magical shortcut. It allows me to access various planes of existence without doing 20 hours of incantations. In this case, I'm going to rummage through this poor guy's memories to see how his madness began. And, more importantly, what caused it.
Too late, Johnny. Ritchie, please! Stop while there's still time to save your soul. Says the man who is miles away from everything. Since you infected me, I've searched the world over for a cure and I've finally found it.
Scott? Scott? Anesthetic, doctor? It's not necessary. If you don't remember the pain, then you never really felt it.
Jason, let's get some armor! - We're all getting one. - Good. Give us the armor, then. You already have it, inside you.
Hello and welcome. I'm Landsat field supervisor Victor Nieves. This is Steve Woodward, data tamer. Our expedition takes us where every sea route known to man has avoided for centuries. As our satellite shows, the island is surrounded by a permanent storm system. Which allows it to remain hidden from the rest of the world.
Are you locked in a tower or something? Mycroft Holmes! What are these people doing in my house? Mrs. Hudson, I apologize for the interruption. As you know, my brother has embarked on a self-destructive journey that is impressive even by your standards. And I want to know what triggered it.
We are eternal. Isn't eternity boring? Not if you have a purpose, Peter. That's why you're here. I told you about the impulse I had many years ago to find life. But I didn't tell you what happened when I found it. It was all so... disappointing.
I don't need anything, Ray. If there's one thing you should know about me, Ray, it's that I don't need anything. I do. And I want that information. I find it funny that she only gives it to you.
I don't need anything, Ray. If there's one thing you should know about me, Ray, it's that I don't need anything. I do. And I want that information. I find it funny that she only gives it to you.
I mean, you know I'm going to say what's on my mind. We're sinking into the mud, and the bastards are at it again! The same vast global conspiracy. On a different day. You can't see it without a cosmic flashlight.
I wasn't born a homeless beggar. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that. Most people don't stop. I need information about the factory, the guards and the woman who runs it, Gao.
All the dubious shit we did for Rand... That's not true, Joy. It's very moving, but time's up. This blade has brought down kings, emperors, lords and tyrants. If you told me I'd use it on a businessman...
Hi, buddy. What's up, Mom? Yeah, just some problems with the science museum. Do you want some dinner? Martin made lasagna. Yeah, I made it, not your mom.
None, really. Just curious. Well... You know what? If I ever found something that had the power to grant three wishes, I'm sure I'd put it back where I found it, turn around and run away, on foot or by bicycle, as fast as I could.
I agree. Maybe Ozzie was right after all. We should put it back. Let's not lose our heads. We could have done something with the box. But what did we use it for instead?
- Even if the heart is damaged? - Especially in that case. Matthew, I want to be frank. - Please. - Is the other life you had your heart in still with her or with the one who lived it alongside you?
To be a translator? What do you say? I've seen this language, but I haven't learned much. And they haven't told me much. Besides, even if I could read it, I don't know what it is.
She would have shared it with the world. That's where your riddle falls apart. If she had completed the test, she would have published it. Diane gave me clear instructions. That I shouldn't publish it until after her death.
Please. - It doesn't fit. - Not at all. To begin with, put the sword down. Promise me you'll protect her with your life.
You know, the guy in the suit. Any room he walked into, he could tell you where the money was in exactly five minutes. Sharpe. The guy's like a brute, his mind is like a steel trap. Any machine he can think of, if they've built it, he can take apart and put back together with his bare hands.
Not very well, by the way. But there's nothing in Vladovin, it's just ice. It's funny, I could have sworn there was a secret Russian naval base where they converted Cold War-era submarines. Technically, it's no longer Russian. The base was taken over about a month ago by a terrorist group of separatist soldiers and the Russians haven't recovered it yet. We have a brief window of opportunity.
Offering money like that... it's only a matter of time, James. Tell me one thing that isn't a matter of time. They say you're going to sell the gunpowder to the Republicans. The Republicans don't have any money, why would I sell it to them?
To the heath! He won't let us carry her. James. The gunpowder we carried last night was fit for the job. That's why we're carrying it.
You don't win a country's trust by invading it. You don't build a country by pointing guns at it. However, for guys like Glen, counterinsurgency hasn't worked for a reason. Are you ready, boss? No one has ever done it properly.
Change Fox News. It's no use having a bunch of perverts yelling at us. - Yes, general. - So we should start working on the assessment. - I've already written it.
I love your house, it's incredible. Who imagined that house? It reminds me of that Hopper painting. That's right. My mother and I bought it a few years ago, and she was always trying to fix it up.
How do you explain to a child who has opened his heart to you that you were just using him to seduce the grandmother of a girl he likes? I can't believe I was stupid enough to let you humiliate him like that. I'm sorry, okay? Where's Hugo's camera? I promise I'll give it back.
I'm sorry, are you all right? Where's Hugo's camera? I promise I'll give it back. So you stole it. No, I didn't steal it.
And I own a ruined brothel. Because I hate magic even more than you do. Do I? I'm glad you banned it. I'm glad I didn't use it.
Will you save my future grandson? Excellent question. For the crime of killing the Lady of the East Woods... by order of the great and powerful Wizard of Oz... I sentence you to... This sword. I knew the man who used it.
I'm sitting in an old Hollywood restaurant with red leather seats, I'm between my lawyer and Milton Berle, and Milton Berle unzips his pants and takes his dick out. He pulls it out in the middle of the restaurant and right in front of me. I tried to maintain eye contact but it was very difficult. I kept looking down. He never tried anything. He didn't try to touch me and he didn't play with her. He just took it out and left it out for the whole dinner, the whole lunch.
It's getting late. Rick Grimes of Alexandria... You've given the King a lot to ponder. Well, when I was a kid, my mom told me a story. There was a road to a kingdom, and there was a rock in the road. And people would just avoid it, but the horses would break their legs on it and die. The wheels of the carriages would come off.
It took hours. And then... When she was about to fill it, she saw something in it. It was a bag of gold. Well done. The King had placed that rock on the road because he knew that the person who got it out, who did something, deserved a reward.
Rabbi Nachman believed that the Jewish victims of the Uman massacre were lost souls. In 1768, in Ukraine, thousands were killed by the Cossacks. Women and children... Their bodies were thrown into a hole... and forgotten. When Rabbi Nachman visited Uman, he saw the mass grave and called it... a garden.
It was something new. A life form. Possibly of extra-solar origin. An alien life form? According to Gymonk, who discovered it on Phoebe.
I need that propellant! Right, give me a few seconds! The cannon will be over the pods any second, we have to protect the assault team. That stealth is almost on top of us. If we let it give us one more clean shot, it'll cut us in half!
My team. What's going on? Say again. The van carrying the bombs... Sekou was driving it.
What a piece of shit. I obviously had no idea what was coming next. I mean, the explosion, I still don't believe it. But it was because of the recording that Sekou was released, it's important evidence in the investigation into the bomb attack. Now, I told the FBI that I wasn't going to tell them where I got it, and I'm not, but...
In a world full of orphans, they still had each other. And I was a ghost. I was a ghost who had no place there. And that, Kevin, is what changed my mind. The physicists who sent me told me that the first person to use the machine was the guy who invented it.
You let her go? Your men have to know that my wife can't be hurt. It won't be possible. In English, damn it! Even if we could give that order, no one would follow it.
I have opened the gates for you. I have handed you this victory. Your men must know. They can't hurt my wife. Even if that order could be given, no one would follow it.
Woodes Rogers has debts he can't hope to pay off. Given the ruin Nassau is in, those debts could be bought for a mere fraction of their value. You could take Woodes Rogers in hand and have him arrested. Meanwhile, while Nassau burns, its assets can be bought for the price of a song. I bring you the opportunity, sir, to own the island, shape the regime that governs it and do so while justice is served for the murder of your granddaughter.
The men said it sounded like the voice of God warning them to stay away. It's still an open question how much of this story Avery invented. But what is undeniably true is how undeniably effective this story has been in getting a result. Captain. It was no accident that Billy chose it.
More. I would never have come this far, in front of your men, carrying that ark. The ark was never here. He left it behind. Do you think they'll find out we left it here?
That piece of green ribbon will be wilted by 'Commonwealth Day', and by then you'll want to have something to show for it, as, I suppose, you'll be in action on the pottery wheel. Oh! You'll need police on horseback to control the crowds. In fact, I'm quite nervous about it. The wheel is quite difficult to control, and the one time I used it, things got quite violent.
The diameter of the hammer head suggests that it is the same as the one used on Margaret Kwan. The size of the fractures is identical. However, the extent of the torture on Mike Reiss is much greater than on Margaret Kwan. Her torture seems to have been to obtain information. When the killer got it, he killed her quickly.
How do you know? How do I know what, darling? When you lost your passion for work. You said you woke up one day and realized you'd lost it. If you're used to electricity dancing through your veins and suddenly you don't feel it anymore, that's because you know.
Well, we don't know yet. I'm trying to get it back. Frankie Vargas died before he was able to take up the office to which he was elected. But his achievements, his selfless work, and his dreams shine a light for all of us. But even if we don't have the message, we have the number of the person who left it.
- Who do we talk to about dieting? - You can talk to whoever you want - But that's interesting, so why don't you recommend a diet? - Because there isn't enough data to support it - But if we look, we have data that we've researched that supports it, with for example NIH in Europe, the European study
They won't shut up about the quota. You're not much of a talker, are you? Here you go. The quota is 18 kg a day. If you don't meet it, these nice gentlemen will whip you.
Going to court. Expensive. And extremely damaging to HHM's reputation. Not my first choice or yours, I suppose. The firm could choose to pay me a sum that would almost certainly bankrupt it.
We're both going to die here, American! That gas station on the outskirts of Sana'a had a computer with Internet access. Did he send this image from Yemen? Why did he send it? We'll find out as soon as we talk to the guy he sent it to.
In steganographic terms, a lot. Steganography is the art of hiding information in the code of digital files. Everyone does it. The Russians, the Chinese... He must have thought that anyone who sees this will stop there. But I've already gone into the image to analyze the data that makes it up.
Hold on. All right, I understand. Sit down for a moment, okay? I know you want to take your anger out on me, and that's okay. It's just not going to help you.
It's an ambition. I hope that one day I can go to the beach and use that towel. So you've never used it? No. I mean, I've put it on the wet grass in the park, but it's never touched the sand.
Are you all right? - I'm so sorry, Alec. - Why, for saving our lives? Listen, about what happened in there... I've heard of bloodlust, I've even felt it, but never this strong.
- No more than you. - Does he always carry that? No, he picked it up to help you. Where did he get it from? From where he hides it, wrapped in a cloth.
The Clave is trying to prevent an uprising. If the World Apart discovers that we don't have the Sword of Souls, it will be chaos. But the Sword has been deactivated. It can't be used against those in the World Apart. Not like Valentine used it, but it's still an Instrument of Death.
It's a loving recreation. Are you picking on me again? Take a compliment. Texas sounds perfect. It's your hometown, right? Your hometown only got your name because your family infested it like hyper-reproductive rats.
It was something new. A life form. Possibly of extra-solar origin. An alien life form? According to Gymonk, who discovered it on Phoebe.
You know how to make him feel good. You're late. Yes, it was a difficult night. I can't believe we still live in this house. You chose it.
Yes, but this is what we need now. Witch-killing bullets. And you? With magic. No, I don't have it.
- Not yet. Yes, I admit it. I was on your computer. I used your card. I didn't know. When I sent it, I didn't know it had been breached.
And in my photos... There was a photo, and they sent it to everyone. What was in the photo, Daze? Don't make me show it to you. No, darling. Everyone at school saw it.
And we can't afford to buy a new one. From now on, no smartphones, use the library computer. Where did you get the pornography? - From Michael Lucas. - And where did he get it? From his father.
What did you say to him? I'm going to ask you to close your eyes. I also told him that you once said you'd rather kill yourself than hurt me. Big hug. What did he say? He said that a man who has made that promise will never break it.
You have been rehired as my secretary with an 8% pay rise. The Baudelaires will be sent to a suitable guardian and this series of misfortunes is over. As for you, Count Olaf... I'm going to get my hands on your fortune, even if it's the last thing I do. And when I have it, I will tear you and your brothers apart limb from limb.
But time flies like a Winged Lizard. Now, I know that some dangerous reptiles can make you fear the whole species. But if you give them a chance and get to know them well enough to distinguish the dangerous from the good, I guarantee that nothing bad will happen to you in the Reptile Room. There is a situation that happens all too often in the story of the Baudelaire orphans, called dramatic irony. Dramatic irony is when a person makes a remark and someone who hears it knows something that makes the remark have a different, usually unpleasant, meaning.
Nothing in the cars or on the phones. The cards are used throughout the region. He's on the run and I'll look like an idiot on my first operation. So you want my help? Of course you do.
Keep an eye on her. I'm going to find some rope. You're destroying her life! It's not that simple. If you're looking for your skin, Vestige, it's not here. Unless you know where the Skin Thief who took it is, there's not much I can do to help.
- What for? The connection. - It's fine, leave it. - It'll only take 20 minutes. - You can't use it if I don't.
We can't take that risk. No, it's okay, I understand, you've already done too much. Safety is the priority. Right, tomorrow could be our lucky day. The government hasn't approved this mission, but since we've done it, they're not going to leave us here.
Why me? I prayed for a solution and he pointed to you. I thought you had left that life. I really believed that. The problem is that you never believed that I had left it too.
Jason always loved the Drive-In. Southside rabble. They've been at it since the beginning of the movie. Hey! Do you know what happens to a snake when a Louboutin heel steps on it?
All of us. Going to your father's trailer was wrong, but some good came of it. I'm sure my father was arrested for murder. That gun wasn't there when we searched the trailer. Someone put it there after we left.
I assure you I'm unarmed. I just want to kill you in the only way I can imagine you'd want to kill me. With a shotgun. There's a meeting. Krukov called it. To pay off Payne.
Or maybe he asked you to. Do you recognize this rifle? It's a .338 SABER-FORSST with tactical accuracy. When was the last time you saw it?
But now Mr. Batra, the same classmates are willing to do anything for me to get their children admitted. So you mean you won't give Mohan admission. Wow. Now you've read my mind, Mr. Batra. You see ma'am this seat rightfully belongs to Mohan and I will make sure he gets it.
'Bigger than Ben Hur! ' I'd better start wearing Roman helmets, then. I've never come across a case like this. Mrs. Wallace has made up her mind, and seems to believe that God approves of her actions. If I may venture an observation, when people seek the Almighty's approval, it's usually because they fear they won't get it.
They don't go unnoticed. Still, do I need your help? Not to defeat Cersei. You could invade King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. We almost conquered it and we didn't have dragons.
Tarly, I wanted to talk to you tonight in my study room. How bad is it? I think I'll find out tonight. Where will you go? I gave in to this disease as soon as I saw it.
I guess we'll never know. What are you going to do with that letter? I don't know yet. Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?
I measured you before I traveled. You've grown. My little girl has grown. Right there. The door was open. I spent a whole weekend installing that lock, but if you don't close it...
Do some research. If you're right, maybe we can use Bowman to get Broussard. But be careful. Where did he keep the manacle? Who else knew Hennessey had it?
Yes. If the grenade is held in the hand, with the safety pin removed, then the grenade will not explode, correct? That's correct. But I'm curious. Why wouldn't you let go?
If you put a time bomb here... what time would you set it off? At lunchtime, of course. Why is that? That's when the most people are here. The bastard who put it here... wanted as many victims as possible.
- I noticed it too. I obviously didn't expect to bury the box, love. What did you think, my heart? That we were going to clean it out and use it to store our taxes? Without the fucking lid, it's difficult. Okay, I'm not looking for it.
Get your things and let's get out of here. They're the symbols I saw on the guy's face in hell, or wherever that place is. And everything else is what Diana saw. Did the Crusaders draw this on the fabric or did they find it like this? I don't know if it was with the stick when they found it, but none of this was visible in sunlight.
I put it back in the tunnel. Shouldn't you leave her somewhere further away? No, I want to know what happened. I want to know where it came from. I want to know why they buried it, and what was written on the cloth that wrapped it.
Previously on Grimm... I still think I need to carry the wand and I want to know what's in the fabric that surrounds it.
- It's important. Follow me. I can't find my cigarette case. I've looked everywhere for it. - I think I lost it at Beltrán's.
- I think I lost it at Beltrán's. - What's that? Maybe I dropped it. It all happened so quickly. I know I had it in the car before I went into his house.
I want you to talk to your contacts to find out if the police have found her. I'll do what I can, princess. Thank you, princess. Can we trust her? If the police have found her, she'll tell us.
Francisco has no power now. But he could have. Did you find the cigarette case? No. Victoria says the police don't have it.
I like your work. It's useless and impractical. Thank you very much. Yes, Annie said that everything you see in front of you was inspired by that piece. She wanted me to bring it as a present for Sophia.
There's going to be a lot of blood. We have to wrap him in something that won't let the blood through. We have to take him to the car in something that doesn't look suspicious. With a body inside, the chest will get heavy. So we don't carry it.
I'm trying to help people, Mack. I know you're not a bad person, Fitz, but this... device has been used for very bad things. You have to think about the consequences of what you create. Electricity is used... to execute criminals. Does that mean we shouldn't use it in hospitals? - That's different.
Yes. But... their physical bodies will eventually die because of it. Aida, it doesn't matter. Reality is just perception. They believe it's real... which makes it real.
We connect with them and find out where their bodies are being kept. We'll meet at the agreed location. That's where I scheduled our departure. Reality is just perception. They perceive it as real... - which makes it real.
We will change the world. Fitz, this is wrong. Wrong, like on the level of "crimes against humanity". These are non-humans. You've been a huge asset, Skye, but... if you're not asked for your opinion... don't express it.
The Russians have a base. Under an oil platform in the Baltic. Go and save them. Leave them alone. How do we get out? Have you built a way out of the real world? Of course, but... I suspect Aida will have found it by now.
We have to be prepared for anything. On my mark. I was so sure... I assume this isn't where she's building the damn thing. No, this is where she's building it. It's just... not in this world.
This body won't matter. Finish the machine. It has found a way to create living matter. Human tissue. She wants to become a real person. No, this is where she's building it. It's just... not in this world.
I met someone who had a problem with drugs. So? Did you detoxify him? No. I had the opportunity to intervene and I didn't take it.
It's good to help a girl whenever possible. Like they do in the series. I couldn't agree more. What are you talking about? Zooming in on the gun to find out who fired it.
Yes. I just came to check on you. Look! The grenade detonated. And Dan knows that only I could have planted it.
Do you like it? The imagery looks familiar. I think it's beautiful. "Leaves of grass." Making the leaf? Violence? It's the variation on the classic that makes it so profound.
Tomorrow I'll prepare the formula while you collect her bile. Let's hope it works. You told us it always works. On rats. I've only used it on rats.
A crime with a mandatory sentence of seven years. But instead of throwing everything at him, the prosecutor showed leniency. She reduced the charge to a misdemeanor, recommended a suspended sentence and sealed the records. It's a moving story. But I don't see how any lawyer is connected to this case. You're not talking about just any lawyer. You're talking about me. But just because I showed compassion once, doesn't mean he deserves it now.
And from the rib which the Lord God took from man he made woman, and brought her to the man. Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, she shall be called Woman, because she was... Therefore the man shall take her to be his wife. The man and the woman were naked, and they were not ashamed. May God bless this union and make it fruitful.
Shoes. Take off your shoes and give them to him. Be careful with my things. That wig was custom-made. Which makes it the only thing we've found in your apartment that is undoubtedly yours.
We have to listen to everyone's demands in order to be legitimate. Why do we have to include everyone? P was our friend. Yes, but the riot isn't just ours. You can't take away the freedom of expression of a woman who has finally found it.
- What weapon? A nuclear fusion bomb. They will destroy National City and blame hostile aliens. How did Cadmus get their hands on a bomb? Well, they didn't steal it.
Good for you. But you're talking to a journalist. We believe that everyone is lying until we can prove otherwise. So, that list. Who had it originally?
Please! We both know that Winslow can't keep his mouth shut. He's my boyfriend and my best friend. Maybe the President and Alex are right. Supergirl has a responsibility to protect everyone. But... all I can think about is that the two people I love are trapped on that ship... And if we destroy it...
I'm keeping it for now. This wasn't a gift. We've seen that Marcel is a threat, whether he's a sacrifice or possessed. - Either way. - What good is a gun if you don't use it?
Vincent and Marcel will be ours, no matter what. But if you insult us again, we'll take your whole family. Do you still doubt our power? You shouldn't. As you'll soon see, we came here today for one thing. And we've got it.
And I disagree. I think Boo's generous tree takes more than it gives. - What do you mean? - A tree is a sign of goodness. But when they fill it with cement, the tree symbolizes the innocence that was stolen from Scout.
- Show some respect. - Julius, don't be rude. Newton's second law of motion. Everyone knows it, but as we delve deeper into Newtonian mechanics, you can't just know it. I need you to be able to see it.
How can you despise the woman who gave birth to her only grandchild? Look at those cheeks! He looks just like his grandfather. Dollie, have you seen my tie? I think I saw it hanging on the bathroom door.
Lady Yardley. That's not acceptable. Where is your wife, Mr. Rutter? My husband knows the box is missing. He'll realize you've taken it.
Who says that? Life magazine, the Saturday Evening stenographer, and Professor Noodle Stroodle and the Pigeon Soap Comedy March. Me? I'm thinking of switching to solar. I won't use it, I'll just sell it to poor people and musicians.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Einstein. I asked your husband. How did you meet Chaim Weizmann? It's okay, Chaim. You can admit that you don't understand. BERLIN, GERMANY 1921 You've been explaining general relativity for more than three hours and I believe you understand it.
Yes, but if we know, we can't know where it is. Does that seem logical to you? No, sir. Of course it doesn't. According to my dear colleague, the particle doesn't exist until we observe it.
But we can measure the speed of the second particle. As they are mathematically linked, we can determine the speed of the first. We would know its position and velocity, without having to measure both. I have certainly refuted Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. You've been defeated. What if the act of measuring the first particle influences the second? What if it changed when it was measured?
Hitler is crazy. Imagine how he would use that weapon. He could decimate London or Moscow. Many years ago, Haber convinced me that poison gas would soon end the war. It only made it more horrific.
I'll send you the papers. You'll feel better. All right, then. You said Marco turned around and O'Bannon hit him from behind with some kind of sculpture. Did you see where he put it?
Yes, it was. Yes. - Say hello. - Yes. The door was open. We didn't lock it.
I was your partner. I watched it go downhill after Clair left. Clair... She wasn't in charge of this company. Well, she didn't run it into the ground.
- You could have helped her and protected her. - You couldn't have done anything. That thing in the library, it got her, but it didn't want me. Why did she? Because it wanted her and not me?
What's going on? I was just thinking about how everything has changed. - I thought all this was wonderful? Just like a volcanic eruption or a tsunami. Few things are more wonderful than destruction, but that doesn't mean I appreciate it.
- What's wrong? The van isn't here. How do you know? Because everyone does what's best for their people. It was my men who took it.
I love you. Where are you, Eddie? You're a Denier. You're the son. What's behind the door? If you don't open it, you'll never escape.
I love that about the Earth. You know what, take the bottle. It's a present. But as for the protomolecule... Sergeant Draper witnessed a revolutionary technology and there can be no peace if one of us has it and the other doesn't.
It's amazing, we have the box, the video club. Sometimes I open Netflix and think: "I don't think I'm going to make it. I'm not going to make any progress." And I know there's pressure. We all feel it, because we already have excuses for our friends, as if they were debt collectors.
I need you to close the dress. - That movie has AP. - Okay, I'll close it. Looks like you don't want a sequel. The door, like the man who put it on, is hanging well.
An outlaw doesn't join a club with a logo. - He has a fund company. - Right, and we have a logo. Why my property? I'm in a project that wants to use it.
Please, sir! Bjorn, you have blood. I have offered you life. I have sent you a message. If it is peace you desire, you will not have it until we hear you speak!
- How long has he been here? - We don't know yet. - Why bother organizing a gala? - Tradition. We've always held it here.
But let's get serious. Toby, after we installed the stent, we ran some tests. The arrhythmia was caused by a minimal septal defect, which means you have a hole between two chambers of the heart. Some people choose not to repair the hole and treat it with medication, but I strongly advise surgery. Let me explain exactly what's going on. Although this is a more serious surgery, I've had it many times.
or the world, if you don't save yourself. Do you know what the most dangerous thing about schizophrenia is? That's the trick. The one that blows your mind. Your illness convinces you that you don't have it.
I'm the boss. Where was I? Yes. There's a reason this city will never forget your parents. They were the ones who set it on fire.
- I... - I know who you are, Wanheda. You helped my people find shelter underground. - And you gave the Flame to an unworthy king who destroyed it.
What was Arkani doing in Maryland? Whatever it was, it doesn't anymore. Is Reddington implying that they were building - a weapon of slaughter to use? - It's possible. We don't know what they were building, or who took it or where it is.
You really should try Ginny's cheeseburger stew. The minced meat and spices, the melted cheese... I highly recommend it for the inauguration ball. If you think you can keep your immunity deal by blackmailing the president-elect for allegedly receiving illegal campaign donations from Alexander Kirk, you're not as smart as everyone says. Marlin, your boss made me a campaign promise and I intend to make sure he keeps it.
For me, life is war. And that war changed with the creation of the Iron Dome. The most advanced missile defense system in history. More than 1,200 of our rockets have been intercepted. The BNM realized that the best way to defeat a superior technology is to buy the engineer who created it.
The car bomb. It was as if his security detail knew where to look. - And you think I told him? - No one else knew. Except the munitions expert who made the bomb, the mechanic who installed it.
Do you know that parsecs are a measure of distance, not time? Yeah, we tell you that all the time. Just like chess with holographic monsters isn't a thing. Not yet, Bozer. - Just because you're blinking doesn't make it real.
He said: "I'm going to turn my library cards into credit cards." We don't know what that means. Let's be up front. We don't know. We've been trying to figure that shit out ever since we heard it.
The sword that Emma destroyed when they fought. I don't understand. Why does he think that killing Emma with that sword will make him the Savior? He's not the first to think that wielding that sword will make him a hero. We have to find him before he discovers it. Before he goes after Emma again.
Do you think your son can stop me? You may have ended the Ogre war, but I will be remembered as the hero who defeated the Dark One. This book teaches you the spell to repair the sword. But restoring its power will be harder than you think. It requires the blood of the person who forged it.
I still don't know precisely where Ichabod Crane is taking my gun. Would you mind telling me where he took mine? All right, we trust you. Now trust us. What do you know about the gun and how we destroyed it?
But why would Thawne want to destroy the Spear? No. If he destroys the Spear, it would mean that this reality couldn't be rewritten. Right, it's better to recover the Spear before he can actually do it. But even if we find it, we don't know how to access its powers.
Last night, in Tampa, some kind of scrawl was discovered on the arm of a corpse that was being dissected in an anatomy class. What is it? Some kind of tattoo? No, it's pen ink. Yes, and luckily for the police, the teacher of the anatomy class is also the county coroner and recognized the mark. She also saw it on the...
Right. And the mark on her arm? It wasn't there when she left. I told the police that. Whoever killed her must have put it there.
He says he's clean, but his money goes to something. I mean, he's always asking me, or Dean, for loans to stay afloat. Always, desperate for money, It could be a failed extortion play No. I mean Carter has a personal problem, but he and I built this company from nothing, he wouldn't jeopardize it.
I'm sorry, but I won't be able to help you with your next trial. For double murder. The police are coming. What? I used Carter so that he created the back door and Adam loaded it into the program, and then killed them both, in order to get what he wanted.
Giannusa is from the New Jersey mafia. The courts have an extortion case pending against him. - Not without the star witness. - If he leads us to the list, why don't we go after him? - They don't know if he has it or where to get it.
I thought I was going to be fired the other day. What happened? Well, he called me and said... There's this thing. I asked my boss's boss to make this thing happen. I didn't know if he was going to do it or not.
So Laurie can still survive the coup? Why did you tell me to make friends with him? I say a lot of things, Monica. I say a lot... I know you think I'm a tough guy who built a ticking time bomb and passed it on to Gavin Belson to get back at him for his actions but the truth is that because I was incompetent, in my brief tenure as CEO of Pied Piper,
I'm not worth it. If it's all just pretend, then why did you keep this? Why would you keep a stupid bracelet if it didn't mean something? It meant something. That's why I kept it.
- It's okay, Beau. They were together for a long time. Jim died years ago and I still think about him. Just the other day, I was cleaning out the garage and I found a t-shirt he wore on our honeymoon. And I think I smelled it just to remember him.
They were together for a long time. Jim died years ago and I still think about him. Just the other day, I was cleaning out the garage and I found a T-shirt he wore on our honeymoon. And I think I smelled it just to remember him. I'd forgotten that we'd turned it into a turpentine rag.
I like the clothes you gave Denise. Yeah. It's nice to have other things so you're not always wearing sweatpants and a cap that says "Ratch". Yeah. I remember when she was in eighth grade and she wore a John Starks sweatshirt to school all year. She spilled gravy on it and wore it for another month.
I have some matters to discuss. Why not follow the usual protocol? Diplomats, ambassadors, emissaries, offers, counter-offers, secret messages. I know how diplomacy works. As do I. I invented it.
You look worried, beautiful. I don't like going against the teachings of Rome. The Church! The Church likes to believe that there was nothing of spiritual value before Christ. They try to deny ancient wisdom, but they can't ignore it.
Ooh, too brief? Yeah. I mean, that's cool, honestly, if you don't want to... But, I'd like to say something... There are a lot of people who have already been given a hard life. They never asked for it, but...
- Hello. - Hi. So... my office called the other volunteers who were here with Miss Rozen. And according to them, she never said she had a gun, or gave any indication that she would need one. I can only think that she had it to protect herself.
The seal has blown. Water is getting in. Then suit up and abandon ship. The diving room is underwater. We won't reach it.
Next on the midday news, a couple in their 30s get married without their dog being present at the wedding. You won't believe their story. What's it going to be? Are you going to open this door or am I going to start killing people? I'm not going to open it.
Flynn jumped to Sacramento. He was there for maybe an hour and then jumped to New York, 1780. - I don't understand. - How did he jump so fast so many times? The nuclear weapon he got in Vegas, if he's using it as a battery.
- Yes. It's becoming a daily thing with me. My boy, he's eight. He has a box of surprises. And every time he opens it, it pops out and he laughs as if for the first time.
But we were missing a piece of the puzzle. We needed a system that would keep the glass clean. Richard wanted to film time passing underwater. CAMERA TECHNICIAN We were asked to come up with something. This one's... a bit dirty. We invented a magnetic arm that passes a wiper through the glass dome and keeps it clean for long periods of time.
The FBI is going to make a semi-permanent tattoo on your neck, to match the ones on your arms. I've heard about this technology. I didn't know it was already operational. How reliable is it? The FBI has used it before, and they've approved it for this operation, so...
When I was 16, my mother gave me a bracelet, it was my grandmother's and... I lost it. I couldn't tell her. Kelly made it for her mother and me when I was in third grade. I think I wore it too much, it has a crack in it.
- It's a party drug, illegal... I know what it is, I just can't imagine Petty Officer Jones taking it. - He wasn't that kind of guy. - He didn't take it exactly. Someone put it in his food.
exactly, but I can't imagine whether it's worth going to prison for him. Prison? For sending a box? And what was in that box? I have no idea. It was sealed when they left it.
With this, an enemy can plan an attack so perfectly that people won't notice it until it's too late. Anyone who wants to attack the US has a huge asset, if they know how to look for it. I'm going to form an elite team. - A secret joint force. - To find out who wants to attack us and find this information before they use it against us.
And where are they? The closest ones are on a planet called Taujeer. That's where we're going. Everyone should rest. Tomorrow we'll find that fleet and destroy it.
But once the victims have been taken under threat, gone to the ATM and withdrawn the money, they are usually released immediately. This type of criminal is very organized, mobile, experienced, but not usually violent. If this is an escalation, it's impossible to predict what dangers more Americans might encounter. A Colombian proverb says: "Poverty does not destroy virtue, nor does wealth bestow it."
The original report said that the victims were not drugged - when, in fact, they were. - With what? Scopolamine, known as "The Devil's Breath". So why didn't the original tests find it? Scopolamine is metabolized in the blood so quickly that standard toxicology tests don't detect it.
Take it, take it all." It's amazing what we don't know about our bodies, we don't think about things. I wasn't taught anything about my body when I was young. I didn't lose my virginity until I was almost 22, which makes me very ashamed. I think it's old-fashioned and silly. And even the person who took my virginity doesn't know they did it, because I had to lie and say I lost it at 16 under a willow tree.
We hope that his experience with this group will provide some insight into how a former member of a Christian cult at the final judgment is selling bombs to ISIS. Wait. "Bombs"? In the plural? When we raided his compound this morning, we found evidence that Mayfield recently built an even bigger bomb than the one he sold to Al-Mutaya. We don't know where it is or who might have it.
We didn't see anything on Ian's video signal to suggest that he was discovered. Yeah, no, all we saw was Ian being drowned in a tuna and then radio silence. We have to make do with what we have. This is all a lot of conjecture. Like what if the bomb is somewhere else, ready to use, and this makes them use it?
- We need to talk to Spencer. Did you find the knife? - Where did you find it? - In the desert. The theory is that he threw it out of the window of the stolen car during the chase.
- I'm listening. - We have money, a lot of money. And we can spend it to make our lives easier, including lining the right pockets in Caracas. I was waiting to hear what your objective was. Even if I had that information, I wouldn't share it with two men who represent a company that doesn't exist.
The idea that Backpage is just trying to satisfy old people's fetishes that doesn't involve underage children. I don't think they can do that in court with a straight face. The witness box is a lonely place to lie. Let's bring them to court and they can tell that story under cross-examination. Let's see if they can keep it up.
- Why is that? - Because of... tradition. And beautiful calligraphy is a lost art. Like drunk driving. I want it and that's that, OK? I want it because Russ has it!
- Because of... tradition. And beautiful calligraphy is a lost art. Like drunk driving. I want it and that's that, OK? I want it because Russ has it! Why did Meemaw give it to him?
Why on earth did you think that was appropriate? -Didn't I tell you to forget that clue? -Is it a lead? Nobody's investigating her. Nobody's investigating her because she's a junkie. And everything she told me is in the Lucas Goodwin manifesto, which has been trashed by every forum and conspiracy theorist on the Internet.
Let's let Walker invoke the Fifth Amendment. Then we'll get together and make sure we're on the same page. All right, we gotta go back. "Beware of compromising alliances, Mr. President." That quote is often attributed to Washington, but it was Jefferson who said it.
Which belongs to an importing company owned by a South African executive. - His name is Desmond Visser. - But Visser's business is just a front for his real passion. Collecting rare items. He's even paid ISIS - to loot antiquities. - He's had an obsession with this coin ever since he lost it at an auction in 2002.
- You're a genius. - Yes, I know. This isn't even a mathematical symbol, it's just Charlie Brown's hair. Sorry, girls, this club was brutal. How did they turn it into a bookstore?
Can we at least set a maximum deadline? Why is that? Do you have to go somewhere? I'm just saying. If we find out we're doing his job, maybe we shouldn't waste so much time. I understand there's a line, Ressler. You think he crossed it. I disagree.
An excellent choice. - No more using the blue bowl. - Good! Because I broke it. I couldn't leave it in the kitchen to contaminate the other bowls.
Mrs. Cabrera, you don't happen to have a gun, do you? I have a gun. It's registered. It's registered. When was the last time you used it?
And he's also looking for you. So where are we with this murder for hire, Sergeant? Donald Clark, yeah, well, we're just keeping him locked up for now until we can shed some more light on who really killed his daughter. I'm confused. Well, we traced the murder weapon back to the guy who bought it.
Yes, he's the fucking client. My God, Lou. You act like people need us, that they have to come here. Why don't we hang up a sign saying: "We sell shit, but we don't take it".
And you won't get it without a fight. I was hoping you'd say that. I've done so many dark things in my life. But I've never had the chance to kill a queen. And I've never killed a fairy. I know you think you own the city, but I invented it.
No, that's fine. Wait a minute. How did you get in? You didn't close the front door. Did I? I could have sworn I had.
Okay, bullshit. We have a right to the truth. Do you want the truth? Yes. And we're not leaving until we get it.
- Hello. - Let me guess, you have some follow-up questions. Penthouse suite. Great upgrade. - My father booked it.
Yes, it is. Yes, it is! Yes, it is! Now I know why I got this job. No one else wanted it.
We know that Maul went in search of Master Kenobi. It could be a sign that he's close to him. Or it could just be a faulty recording. That doesn't explain me hearing Maul's voice. But you've heard it before.
She escaped, ran into the hiker and then back to her prison. All right, any details about the hut? Very, very little. It belongs to an LLC based in Wyoming, but we can't find out who's behind it. All right, then let's find out who sold it.
I'll take you back to the city. I'll take you back to the city. This is weird, right? I mean, you're selling your house. Wouldn't you want to know who was buying it?
You sent Nimah to prison? I didn't want her to go, but we thought it was safer for me. I don't care. It's none of my business. I almost didn't get this assignment, and I'm not going to lose it because you don't follow the rules.
I didn't read it. He came into my room when I wasn't there and took it. This can't be happening. With what happened to Ángeles, I didn't have time to warn you. By now, he could have handed her over.
I think there are two types of people. Those who say: "No!" And those who say: "I'm going to be the hero who helps you." He said: "I didn't suddenly get my leg fixed. I've had it for six years.
Can you just answer my question, please? Red... - and blue, yes? - Yes. I think there's some pressure on the speech center of my brain, and I have to find out what's causing it.
We traced the satellite phones to a hut kilometers from the prison where Asakeem was being held. - Do you have the address? - Not much help. Firefighters' images show a charred crater where the hut used to be. They didn't just burn it down, they blew it up.
She could be our killer. She's only guilty of working in an industry that perpetuates a negative body image. I've received the coroner's report. There's no evidence of botulism in Broden's body. She may have put botox in the water, but he didn't drink it.
Howard, what's the bathroom situation going to be like? Well, there's a sink outside that solves half your problems. But I can use the downstairs toilet, right? Yes. We hardly use it, so it'll be just like yours.
Sulu. Enlarge image of the primary hull. The Defiant? Affirmative. The ship's wave signature has been out of phase since we last encountered it.
Nine bombers left and nine are coming back. The public was very used to sterilized war, to Hollywood. Dale, it's your first time. FLYING TIGERS You don't want to win the war alone. You know, with John Wayne, where the war is less important than the heroes who fight it.
"We don't need this anymore." Not only from a practical point of view, but also from a human one. After three days with no sign of Japan surrendering, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. I now call on the representatives of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE ALLIED FORCES and the Headquarters of the Japanese Empire to sign the instrument of surrender at the locations indicated. Let us pray that peace will reign in the world once again and that God will keep it forever.
That's right. A heroin joke with the Muppets. I'm sure that if there was a line, I would have crossed it now. You always have to think about that when you write jokes: where is the line? We don't want to cross it, but we want to get close.
Nuts on the floor Nuts in the pesto, nuts that I eat I said: "Doesn't she have that problem?" Where the hell is my sandwich? I swear I just got it
Do you need help? I broke my bike. It was my birthday present and I broke it. They couldn't afford it, but they knew how much I wanted it. How am I going to tell them I broke it?
What? Are you talking to Santa like that? My ex, Jason. A first-class asshole. I wanted to give Luke a bike, but he insisted on buying it and now it's Christmas Eve and nothing.
You get the answers and I get the victory. The credit for the operation goes to me, to MI6. Says a lot about a man. Harry and Alex are going to talk to the trolls and find out who gave them the fake news. We know they didn't make it up. Owen and I will be in touch.
I worked with the guy on many cases. He had no problem taking shortcuts. Why did you keep the gun? I didn't know it was the same gun. Otherwise I would have thrown it in the river.
Our army is your army. And your conflict is our conflict. If NATO falls, the European nations will be on their own. And then they'll all start creating armies again. And I really believe that's the end of our Western democracy as we know it.
See how she looks at him? Yes, like Bernadette used to look at me. I warned you, close the bathroom door. Did you see that? She put her hand on him and he didn't hit her.
So I went to the canteen. As each kid got in line, I told them: "Nixon proposed Saturday school." The mock elections were held and, to the surprise of the local newspaper, Democrat John Kennedy won. For the first time, I understood the value of disinformation. I haven't practiced it since.
- Why? I don't know. - I don't know why. It's a rule. Now that I know it's a rule, I won't do it again. And how did you read the list if I have it in my back pocket?
I'm leaving this house. I'm sick of these fucking rules. I'm old enough to govern myself. And you know what? Brian and I are looking for a house, and when we find one, I'm outta here!"
She's emptying them all. It's brutal. Yes, the coroner says the decapitation took place after death. Why do you think Reddington would do that? Maybe he gave it to someone as evidence.
Yes, the coroner says that the decapitation took place after death. Why do you think Reddington would do that? Maybe he gave it to someone as evidence. A warning to an enemy. I think he gave it to a friend, as... As a present.
Would we find your fingerprints on this? Swift gave it to my daughter. I heard the first song and it was obscene, so... I fired him to protect my daughter. A phone message caught our attention. The person who sent it claims to know something that would send him to prison.
"What a great story!" But then we think about it for a while, right? Imagine coming home one day. You get there and say: "What happened to the fucking cherry tree? Did someone chop it down?"
It was a scene in a big meeting room, because that's a series of lawyers. There were a lot of characters there, they were all talking and a lot of shit was going on. In the first image, they do a wide shot of the whole scene, with all the characters and stuff. They do this a few times and then zoom in and shoot a close-up, where we only see three characters. When they leave that scene, in our mind we imagine the whole room, because we've already seen it.
I paid a boy to kill the animal for me. He probably has it. Don, people are afraid to leave their homes, and you let some idiot walk around with a shotgun? He was supposed to give it back. He wasn't even supposed to have it in the first place.
I hope it's something good, I only have four hours to sleep. Yes. All right. Cora, right. That song I played triggered something. When she hears it, something happens.
... I was in your house. - Go! That means the killer is one of the people who was there that night. If Young had seen the tattoo when she was with me, I would have seen it too.
Come on, let's go! Let's go! In the animal kingdom, attraction is a simple biological fact. We have to go. We humans complicate it.
With guns, ammunition and artillery. What's that got to do with my farm? It has everything, Ward. - Why's that? - They burned it down.
Their science department isn't what it used to be. I'd consider getting a recommendation from a more prestigious university. - More prestigious than Princeton? You know... I think you're a valuable addition to modern physics, but I'd hate to see you waste this opportunity. I'm not going to waste it.
They put that shit on the floor... They opened the cellar door to see if I'd get scared... We didn't open the door at all... The cellar door is open. - I didn't open it, did you?
I fought in vain. I find myself feeling the most ardent admiration and respect for you, which have prevented my power to decide wisely. So I fervently beg you to put an end to my torment and grant me marriage. If I could feel gratitude, I would thank you. But I can't. I've never wanted your good opinion and you've certainly declared it without my wanting it.
Eight to 15 centimeters bigger. It's incredible. It's called Trash. Clever, isn't it? Do you know, right now, this little walk? I just want to eliminate it from my life.
I'm sure we can find a place. Thank you, Mr. Hilliard. Happy New Year, Mr. Hilliard. I think Sammy liked veal. Do you recommend it too?
She deserves to be happy as much as we do. All of them! Well done, everyone. Who's ready to eat Trolls? King Ball... there's only one thing that will ever make you happy... and only a Bergen can provide it.
- You're bleeding. - It's not mine. - How is he? - He's out of surgery. There's a bullet lodged in his skull. They can't take it out because of the swelling in his brain. The swelling may or may not go down.
He was down, I must admit. It happens in this business. Ups and downs. But he supported me, every penny. More than that, he risked his life. Almost lost it, in fact.
Fantastic. Where did you find this? It wasn't found. It was cut up. That thing killed three men before we killed it.
The Bible tells us that it contains the seed of man's first disobedience. But there are some among us who believe that God or some ancient civilization left us a map to understand why people are violent. Aguilar was the last person to have it in his possession. We need you to find out where he hid it.
And now, pioneer? We fight. Your Excellency. The glory will go to your father. But we both know who found it.
- Do you know why? - Because I have a knife in my foot. - Who put the knife there? - It was an accident, playing stretch. I'm glad to hear you didn't put it there on purpose.
I think you're beautiful. - Me? - Yes. No... If you're looking for gratitude, you've already got it.
When it's done, put the card back in the deck. Don't try anything. Keep your gun on me. All right, Earl. Now, there's no way for me to know what your card was because I didn't see it.
We won the battle of Madrid. We will win! Are you serious? I despise propaganda, my friend. I don't care who does it.
Marta Vonier, photographer for Le Figaro. And Henry Howell, from the New York Herald Tribune. American. I studied his writing at university. I... I think I've read it all.
- Here you go. No, it's not out yet. Thank you. Exchange a letter. Maybe she has it.
So... Cassie Stevens. The girl who defied death. How did that feel? Better if she hadn't.
And now I mourn the death of Te Júnior, the son of the man who was like a father to me. All for a sword. Loyalty, duty, honor. All excuses for bloodbaths. That's why I left it behind.
Thank you. It wasn't just me. It never is. Needless to say, the position of Vice-Admiral is yours. No one deserves it more.
Was it a mincer? Did they shred someone? You're talking about a shredder. Please tell me that's what it was! Mate, I don't care what it's called, we just use it to kill.
We both liked long naps. I went out one night, chasing a butterfly or a car. When I caught it and ate it... Then it must have been a butterfly. ...I realized that I was so far from home that I couldn't find it.
Fuck the guy. Fuck him in the dick. No! Because now I'm imagining his cock being fucked by another cock. And I feel like protecting it.
You're very sweet, Jake. But I've got a lot on my mind at the moment. Yes. We've always been so good together. And we've already missed an opportunity, I don't want us to miss it again.
Do an analysis. An ambulance was stolen. An injured man took it. - It matches Jericho's description. - Jericho took it.
As if I were being used. Do I say things only to you? That only you can hear? What do you say? He says he wants to hurt her.
I'm sorry, I spoke without thinking. Why does Lady Susan, who is so well adjusted in Langford, suddenly want to visit us? - What reason does she give? "Anxiety to meet and get to know the children" had never worried her.
The last concert is tomorrow. I've saved the best for last. Typical. We're going to play a Christmas song. I wrote it a while ago and it's based on a true story.
19:59 Almost there. The power's back on. We're waiting for the internet connection. - Come on, come on. - Technology... It's only as good as the idiots who use it.
Reacher. How's my office? I'm sitting in it. There's a big dent in the desk. They say you made it with someone's head.
I'm doing this for you. Maybe this isn't the best time to leave. I know, but we can't stay here for all the fighting. And the message said to leave and find the rest of the world. We don't know anything about the people who sent it.
You can't go on living like this, Giant Friend. Giant Friend, what have you done to my quilt? I thought it was there. Where is it, in my other cape? I think I dropped it in the Land of the Giants.
My journey has come full circle. Once an outcast, I am now one of the three chosen Elders, from persecuted to the highest of honors. I've lived 1,000 years. I could live another 1000, or I could die tomorrow. But I no longer fear death, for I have met it once.
Next year is my last. If the team sucks, all I have left is home. Then you'd better make sure the team improves. I'll just have a beer. Let's have a beer and rest. So much shit has happened here. We can't afford to lose it.
I played the part of a defeated man, resigned to his work. I made myself indispensable and during that time, I cemented my revenge. We call it the Death Star. There's no better name and the day of its launch is coming soon. I've installed a flaw deep in the system, a flaw so small and powerful that they'll never find it.
That's how I met her. I photographed her a year ago. I thought... You know, I... the police gave me this photograph. They told me she had it in her house.
Do you want to go and tell that little girl that her lizard has died? She's 10 years old, she doesn't even know what death is. Do you want to explain to her what death is? While you're at it, tell her that Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny don't exist. We shouldn't make a habit of it, but if we have the opportunity to protect a child from the heartbreak this world has brought them, I think we should take it, because there are plenty more where that came from.
My God, you look incredible. How you do your hair... It's magnificent. Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but there's been some foul play. You know that suitcase of money you gave us? Someone's swapped it.
You're very clever. Thank you very much. Whatever our destination, we have to find a good school for you. Having a place to sleep has helped us dream. Do you know that this aluminum can would still be here 500 years from now if we just threw it away?
It has to be where you passed. The Mickey Mouse medal that Emily gave you. - Yes? Where is it? Where is it? - Don't let them step on it!
That night, he was, and still is, the only suspect identified by the police. Because... Because he was and is... the only murderer of this beautiful young girl. This is not a penknife or a dessert knife. This knife was made for cutting meat... and that's what he used it for. He cut through tendons, muscles, bones and the heart, twenty-two times.
They're having differences of opinion. We're at an impasse. No, you're not. I don't like that word. I won't let you use it.
We didn't know who we were looking for. Who were those thugs in the hotel? We don't know. Is there any crap you know? All that stuff about her, we'd seen it before, in Anubis.
But I've learned that the problems always go with me. Today, they're all in New Orleans. I've been here for about six months. I feel like I've been hunting for my happiness for the last fifteen years. I've never found it in a job or a relationship.
Today, they're all in New Orleans. I've been here for about six months. I feel like I've been hunting for my happiness for the last fifteen years. I've never found it in a job or a relationship. Maybe I'll find it in LA.
Oh, well. Sorry, I wasn't expecting company. It's okay, we didn't expect to need it. Darling, do you want to go to the toilet? Do you mind if I use it? - No, I don't mind.
Soraya's husband was a teacher, and he died on the spot, just like my brother Tigo and the rest of the class. My brother's favorite thing was to use the sharpener, so if he did well, Mr. Diaz would give him a pencil to sharpen. Sometimes I think back to when the wave hit them. I hope it was quick. That they didn't see it coming.
I'm glad you're all right. What's that thing in the yard, Leo? - I don't know what it is. - You don't? You didn't build it?
I was fed up. Just thinking about it. My children left... my husband left me, my mother died... I found my freedom. Total freedom! I'd never felt it before.
It's all good. You have a solid defense here for your friend. There's clear evidence that he didn't make the sale. That coupled with the fact that the undercover cop, Mr. Macho, overreacted. I used my knowledge to get the information, but now that I have it, I'm not giving up.
No, in my experience, it's not. -It's not how people talk. -Please, you're wrong. Do you understand? People understand the historical meaning of that word and that you can't say it for nothing, without the slightest responsibility.
It's late now. So what? Do you give up? Did you know that this show is about me? A loser who had a chance and blew it.
- Tell Jamie it's a trap. - Where are you going, pussy? Let go of me, you brute, or I'll tell my godfather you've got me. Keep an eye out, Hugh. My favorite is that you turned a broomstick into a poisonous snake and sent it to attack the earl, a sort of modern-day Pharaoh and Moses...
Didn't you give him a new guitar for the talent show? Oh, yeah. Yes, we did. Well, where is it? You... With me. He's probably lost it.
We'll see... What? But it's his name... - Is it a coincidence that there's a pharmacy there? - I didn't put it there.
There were stories of an elf who lived in that valley. We'll be happy to tell you his wild tale of how he single-handedly won the War of the Races with nothing more than a magic sword and three simple Elfstones to help him. Well, my father used to tell me not to believe anything I hadn't seen with my own eyes. Do you think that just because those pricks with the pointed ears tell us that magic is dead, it's true? What makes you think I haven't seen it, huh?
What the hell happened here? Kyle had an accident. He had an accident with the door trim? How can you do that? Why didn't he fix it?
My real name is Dr. Nurkobel, but I prefer Nurko. Why are you wearing Elmo's tie? I lost a bet with him. If I had won, he would have had to wear a Dr. Nurko tie. And when can you take it off?
Just like you didn't touch my aerobics tape? - I said I didn't touch your tape! - Then why did it turn up in the garbage can? The doll must be here. It hasn't left the house. Nobody took it.
At the scene of the crime, in the Bronco, in Rockingham? Who else could it be? Calm down, think with me. Doesn't it seem strange that the glove simply appeared in Rockingham when Detective Fuhrman found it? Not if Simpson dropped it when he jumped over the wall to avoid being seen.
Have you taken home any evidence? Other than this one from the night in question. Not that I can remember. So let's be clear. In all my years in the profession, this is the only time you've taken evidence of a crime, put it in your car, gone home and not handed it in until the next day.
I looked at her. Can you describe its appearance? It looked a bit damp and sticky. Parts stuck to other parts. And what meaning did you give the glove when you saw it?
No sir, I don't use that word to describe people. Have you used the word "nigger" in the last 10 years? Not that I can remember. Are you saying that if you called someone a nigger, you forgot? I don't know if I can answer the question the way you put it.
If anything motivated me during the trial, it was the idea, the notion that one day I might have to look... at the Goldmans and... With the realization that he would be acquitted. But that's the verdict, that's the jury's position, that's their voice. And I accept the verdict. We came here looking for justice, and you will judge, I hope, whether we found it or not today.
And Loras? I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it.
There were stories about an elf who lived in the Valley. I would tell you his story of how he single-handedly won the War of the Races with only a magic sword and three mere Elven Stones to help him. My father taught me not to believe anything I didn't see with my own eyes. Do you think that because those pointy-eared bastards say magic is dead, it's true? What makes you think I haven't seen it?
What's wrong? Afraid you'll like it? You and Cephalo deserve each other. What does that mark mean? I don't know. I've always had it.
Your blood is the key. Don't let them leave without you. An offer: your help in exchange for your freedom. - What does the mark mean? - I don't know. I've always had it.
Protect the princess! I said we could do it. Where's the seed? I tried to tell you before. Don't tell me you lost it.
It's me, Wil. I'm the seed. What do you mean, you're the seed? I have to become Ellcrys. That's how we save her.
And I'll do it again if you're not going to give the royal blessing like the Khan you are. Brother. You call me "brother" now? The news was coming. The only question was who was bringing it.
"Prodigy" just means that she... can "rent" me and take all the money. What song is that? A long time ago... I could have sworn my grandmother sang that... before I was sold. There was a man on the farm, playing his old African guitar. He... I think he played it too.
They all passed. I wasn't interested in competition. Skateboarding isn't about winning. It's about doing your best and appreciating those who do the same. It's about trying a trick, year after year, and seeing the happiness on other people's faces when you pull it off.
They were fresh. They're not so fresh anymore. Eight hours ago, I spoke to you on the phone. I told you to sort out the Zeppelin situation. Not only did you not sort it out, but you told their agent about the deal with the Germans?
They're auditing my company. I can't have 10,000 copies of Donny Osmond coming back, right? That'll be more than we pressed the first time. So next time do the math before you order an illegal print run. Hey, I paid for that print run, I can't sell it.
♪ They could care less about you, they could care less about me ♪ ♪ As long as they are to end the place that they want to be ♪ ♪ They're always wearing false smiles, I guess it goes with their style ♪ ♪ Politicians in my eyes... ♪ LESTER: Se tens uma ideia, não a podes inquietar.
I don't know. I didn't do anything, I promise, I just deleted it. How long after? About a week. - You didn't show it to anyone?
You should. You're a real F. Lee Bailey. I know my rights. I didn't have to steal the footage. That Orton guy didn't even have it anymore.
She's not the only one with secrets. Ford asked me, in person, to create a villain for his new narrative. It's very... secret. Do you really think Ford would pass on any key characters from his story? He's almost finished it.
A little while ago, he said he was here. Now you say you weren't. What are we left with? Yes, when he showed me the photo, I thought maybe. But now that I see it again...
You are a convict who needs someone to clean up after you, your movement is limited, and the door has to be closed. So to speak, you are the first important person I have to serve and that I can talk to freely. I thought my story would be well told by now, but I don't come from important families. Don't you? I understand that your father founded a criminal company and that you inherited it.
Do you need my help so that the speech convinces as many people as possible? Precisely. Are you sure it would be negative? What? If the Navy invaded the beach and took it over, why would that be a bad thing?
PREVIOUSLY I'm fully aware that I'm not his first partner and that those who have seen such depths have never come to the surface again. We have a fleet and two men who claim it.
No, no, no. I understood. Yes. He said no. And even if they wanted pizza for the hostages, which they don't, the criminals wouldn't eat it because they know we put sleeping pills in it.
My husband's name was Richard. He died two years ago. He had the opportunity to stay in San Junipero. To cross over. He didn't take it.
You had the chance to stay in San Junipero. To cross. He didn't take it. - You didn't want it. - Why wouldn't someone?
What are you doing? We were praying together. Praying for God to save our city. Our prayers have been answered. God is going to save Alexandria. Because God gave us the courage to save it.
Thank you. I love this top. Jess, Nick has to stop telling that story about the wet pants, okay? - I know, I know. - I've heard it four times this week.
- So you knew you were being filmed? - Yes. Again, it was a private moment with someone I cared about. That recording was for us, not for the public. - Why did your ex publish it? - I don't know who published it.
If you dance with Cadillac, you'll win for sure. I have this tape of me singing. Do you think you could give it to Malibu for me? Maybe if we dance together... Of course. I'll make sure he gets it.
Here's the song. - "Oogie Boogie Disco Biscuit." - It's a party song. In a 4/4 beat, but with subtext. I wrote it myself.
I'm serious. - Do you think Shao made this tape? - No. They got it from a store. We went there, the man in the store said he got it from someone black.
Now, understand. For Ed and me to make the changes this city needs, we needed a mandate. And to get a mandate, Ed has to win by 10 points in November. So I'm not just asking you to hand over the Bronx. I'm asking you, Francisco, that you and your people take out the competition, wherever you find it.
Not all of them. Our friend was one of the first models. These hosts used an ancient geopositioning system. As you said, I've been here for centuries. The information is still there, but the new system can't read it.
"...it's with your passion." That's Jorge. Just like that. - No, it's not. - Yes. She left me with a phrase copied from Saco de Merda? Who knows who he copied it from?
Just like that. - No, no. - Yes. She left me with a phrase copied from the Bag of Shit? Who knows who he copied it from? Did he use it to seduce her?
- We did it. Yes. - Yes. I left my wallet somewhere, the House of Contentment. I went there last night and I think I put it in the tip basket.
He owns a flower store. We have a unit there at the moment. What a mess. Powell cut out his tongue? Yes, I think he took it as a souvenir.
Pain. Anger. That song. "Woman Like You". It was a long time ago. So you wrote it.
And again. Use your hands and jump with him. Finish the move. Let's go. Have you been thinking about going to college? I've been thinking about how I won't be able to afford it.
I bet that photo shows Kent Turner doping the horse. A reasonable speculation. It would cost him his victory. And his business. I told you I deleted it.
"Max Greene exercised free will" That's not an answer. "The main mission succeeded" I should never have trusted the machine's word. The damn thing has been acting strangely ever since we put it back together.
Got it, one second. Find an address, phone number, vehicle, whatever you can. One thing: blue four-door sedan, New York license plate MBE 3-1-5. All in, I want you to look it up in all our license plate readers.
I don't know, but we just put two flu viruses together and turned a very deadly virus into a very contagious one. What are we dealing with here, doctor? Bird flu kills 60% of people within 72 hours. Combined with the human flu virus, if you have a transmission rate of ten to one, that means... For every person who has it, ten more people will be infected.
You didn't give me the ability to despair, Harry. I had to do it for myself. There were so many people I couldn't help, but after a while, I began to appreciate it. The beauty of it. Human life is ephemeral, which is what makes it so precious.
This is where we live. We have a fantastic backyard. This is me, Sparrow McGee. I'm on my way to the best party ever. We only do it once a year, because it takes us a year to recover...
Patrick? You're just like your mother. We tore down the old barn and turned your father's land into corn and soybeans. Your adoptive parents sold the land on the condition that you keep the house. I can't say I wanted it. Lots of memories, good and bad, you know?
His sociopathic son punched a child in the throat. The victim didn't press charges because he feared reprisals. That boy has a torn trachea and can't sing at Nationals. So I don't care where the violence comes from and why. I don't want it in my school.
Your parents are giving you space to heal. It's a different situation. I think it is. The first time, I ignored my instinct. I had the premonition, but I didn't associate it with the bus.
Perfect. That way you're in control from the first minute. The problem is that it's on the clothesline drying. It can't be. I haven't worn that shirt for months. Maybe I wore it myself to go out at night.
You know that. Forget about control. This is about doing justice. We can't lose sight of that. We can still do it, Simon... together.
And you should know that going inland to meet Declan Harp could cost you your life. On the house. Are you looking for salvation, my love? I'm the only one here who can offer it.
Other times we want to be invisible. Because when he looks at us, he sees everything. No, I got the offer, but I turned it down. That's what I wanted to tell you. Good, because it sounded like you were going to tell me that if I didn't match it, you'd leave.
How did the best scientists succeed? Given their history, drinking a lot of alcohol and hooking up with easy women. Great guess, but it's wrong. No, they get geniuses to do the research, and then they steal it themselves. Why don't we just take it from her and be done with it?
to see a man die. Wanheda... Revenge is yours. No. I don't know if your death would bring me peace. I just know I don't deserve it.
In my tribe, if a man loses his sword to an enemy, he no longer serves as a warrior. Really? He walks to the mountains and dies alone. And if he loses his sword to a Warig? Then we get it back.
Would you supply the coffins? And the transportation. Our furniture company's barge has been on dry land... since the Union arrived in Alexandria. Wasn't it requisitioned? Well, sir... they haven't found it yet.
He's burning up! The Wolfe Street doctors were right, Mom. - No, they weren't. - The common treatment indicates... This leg will stay where God put it.
Max? Max? Oh, shit. He's right that we shouldn't give them the formula. But none of that matters if we can't find it.
- Yes. Come to mom. Hang on a second. Silvia's Quique told me that there might be work at the garage. I'll talk to him tomorrow. Eat and stop looking at the TV. Do you want me to turn it off?
You got your bike back. Yes. Do you have another one of those? Thank you, sir. Did the people from the burnt forest steal it from you?
Do you have anything to say? What do you want to know? On the Ark, you taught your students about the promise of our future. About the responsibility our descendants would have when they finally landed on Earth. We didn't start this war, but you can be sure we'll finish it.
Quick raid. Detention of suspects. - Absolute priority? - Recovering the bomb. - And when we get it back?
Holy shit! The house is wonderful, isn't it, Conchita? Where's that piece of crap? - Why do you want to sell it?
But we have to value them. They know how to create a narrative. How are we going to find Simon? He must be in the most secure room in the building. Trust me, we'll know when we find it.
- Yes. But there are... - No, there are no "buts". Even a dog asks for discipline. When it gets it, it's already forgotten that it was disciplined.
I can still hear her voice at home. She had a very soft voice... like a little bell. I'm so sorry for your loss. So... This is life again. I hardly saw it last year... especially in such abundance.
The Earth's gravity continues to pull on it, but if it goes too fast it won't return to Earth. That's how it stays in orbit. Bringing it back down involves mathematics we don't know. Yes, Katherine. So the capsule will keep going around the Earth forever because there's nothing to slow it down?
I felt sorry for him. You weren't at the Siege of Salas, Porthos. What happened there? The Spanish... besieged that city for almost a year. And the people who defended it were made to eat dogs, rats...
If we lose Ethan to evil, the night will never end. And if it's a prophecy, what role will you play? Are you the savior? The warrior who ends the night? Or are you the wolf who loves it?
Schrodinger's cat. I see I've impressed you with my artistic skills. Schrodinger put his cat in a box with poisoned food. Now, until he opens the box, in theory, the cat is both alive and dead. But when he opens it... it's either "Hello, Gloves" or "Goodbye, Socks".
Do you know what I remember? Your voice. You used to read me stories, sing me songs. I loved that voice. I'm sorry you haven't heard it for a long time.
You pushed me off a cliff. I was lucky to be cured. I saved your life. This time. Who saved it last time?
Where... Finding Turtle is what matters now. This is important to me too. We need to see if your speed still works. I think it's working. We still have to find out how Turtle drained it.
Here she is. The betrayer of my family, thief of what is mine. Don't be dramatic. As I said, I just wanted your attention. Since you're here, I've got it.
- I wanted to find out how... - Enough! We have work to do. COLMEIA is behind the explosion at Havenrock. They stole a cyberweapon called Rubicon and used it to gain control of the world's warheads. We have less than 24 hours to stop this, or the world will turn into a sequel to "War Games."
Someone's going to jump, but it's not Tom. - It's me. - What's that? That's right. Tom was just talking me out of it. And if there's any news here, the only person I'm going to give it to is Tom Tucker.
And it was stamped a week before our wedding! There was a time when the president of the Jonathan Taylor Thomas Fan Club received a lot of letters. I don't know what to do, Bonnie. Why would Peter write a letter to another woman just before our wedding? - Why don't you open it and read it?
That's right. He sent a picture of his wiener. Oh my God! - And apparently the girl... - Thank God. who he sent it to doesn't like him in the same way, so she turned him in.
Daddy's orders. Daddy gave a lot of orders. Someone comes to clean and check the house from time to time. I'm paying them too much. If no one lives here, why did your father keep it?
- Prepare an approach group! - Yes, sir. I'd reconsider your plan if I were you, Mr. Valor. Would you? I gave my crew instructions to shoot down any small ship, along with the ship that launched it.
Orpheus used it to find Eurydice in the Underworld, but it didn't work very well for me. You were on the right track. I continued your research into Orpheus, and the vase helped him find Eurydice, but to enter the Underworld, he used a lyre. Made of gold threads. Betsy always called the flag her great achievement. But the flag doesn't matter. It's the thread that weaves it.
They have the troublemakers firmly under control. You're talking about the Catholics. This is my home, Edward. I won't abandon my children. One of them is a spendthrift who doesn't deserve our protection and the other has run away and doesn't want it.
- Thank you. A tasteful bouquet of flowers is on the way. Now would you mind staying and explaining to your roommate what the business world is like? - I know what the business world is like. I have an idea and there's a company that wants it.
According to the contract we negotiated for the lubricant, they're going to put a drawing of me on the box. - And I know what I want to paint. - What's that? My vagina. Well, if they're taking my face off the box, I'm glad they're replacing it with your vagina.
Tell me why I'm restless. You're bored because of the conference. - You've never given one. - That's right. And you're depressed because you wanted to give it.
The baby drinks for free. It seems we have good news and bad news. Marcellus, we don't have time for this. There's a lead on the bullet. Whoever found it is offering it to the highest bidder.
And I can literally hear you rolling your eyes from across the room. Am I boring you? I just wanted to know why your friends brought me, - if you only wanted to pick out men's jewelry. - I requested your presence so you could fill me in. I'm still waiting for you to give me access to the Mikaelson house. It's not magic that's keeping you away. They've drawn up a deed giving it to the sister.
It was brilliant. And I want you to do it again. Only this time, it'll be you they're afraid of. New Orleans is our home, Marcel. It's time we took it back.
No. Not yet. Stay a little longer. Remember the Bible verse on Sean's tombstone? The light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it.
I can't risk another disaster, so this will go straight through me. All right, then. I stopped by your house. It looked like a Red Hats convention. - How did you find it?
- That's great. - Great? Is that your commando humor, like, "Ha, ha, we're all going to die"? It means your information is good. If the Red Berets are guarding the station, it means they're using it for something.
We need to give the police a name. - Any name? - Don't be petty. Well, don't be a vigilante. We need to stop for a minute and figure out the best opportunity to give these boys a chance - They've already had it.
Why do you want to help us now? The other day there was no room and now there is? Don't touch this. Where's the bathroom? I couldn't find it the other night.
We don't want to get close to anyone, because we don't all come back. But at the same time, we have to feel something, don't we? Otherwise, why are we fighting? I remember Frank used to sing a horrible song. I suppose he'd learned it on a children's program when he was on leave. He took it to Afghanistan and it was infectious.
Bring it. Thank you, sir. He didn't seem surprised that I had a gun. The only surprise was that you didn't shoot me. Did Karen choose it?
Am I right? I have to admit, I like being the bearer of bad news. Go ahead. The coin is not for sale. I simply used it to gain entry.
Of course not! Murder? What are you talking about? So... The bomb was triggered remotely. Whoever exploded it did so before you got to the car.
It's all there. It's in the bag. Yes. I believe you. You don't have to do this, Malcolm. I know, but I was going to shoot you in Palmetto, and now I feel like I've been given a second chance, so I'm going to make sure I don't blow it.
- He'll be back. - But... - But... attacked the Senator. - Make no mistake. I brought her to National City.
I'm quite tired. "For Russians, it's culturally important to be accepted." I give the floor to the defense lawyer, Mr. Kiyose. I'd like to explain the objection I'm going to make, which concerns the jurisdiction of this court. The 1928 Pact of Paris condemns war as an instrument of national policy, but does not consider it a crime.
Gate Carapinha A video published on YouTube this week of the cooking celebrity performing a puppet show that many consider racist and offensive. God damn it, Joe Carapinha, give me back my cherry pie. I swear it wasn't me, miss. It couldn't have been. It was Watermelon Sam who stole it.
Room 1310, okay. Let's go. Wait, you don't need me. You have the address. Take the briefcase. I don't want it anymore.
We'll meet them tonight. What's wrong? Didn't Minow take you to the cargo? He did better than that. He took us to the premises where they had it.
He went back to Agent Knox. Did you fuck that up too? ! You should create an SMS group to inform us of your mistakes. Very well... If that recording comes up, I'll get them to delete it because it's totally illegal, but...
Sing it! Sing, you faggot! You wanted me to sing? I sang like a canary. I had some news I could share. Why was I keeping it?
No doubt about it. Demand and supply. - Don't you mean supply and demand? - No, they've been teaching that wrong for years. Demand comes first. And it's those who offer it who profit.
Maybe it's cheese! I don't think we have room for any more cheese. - I'll make room for cheese. - I'll put it on your grave. And don't try to make a wig out of it, because I won't.
- No. I have to go. - Grace! - You have to pay the bill. I haven't brought it yet, but I was going to.
Not if Conway is busy fighting the public outcry. Think about the data you've already gathered. When you sold this to us, you said it would be a last resort, not the only resort. There's no risk in having surveillance approved. Either we use it or we don't.
I can't. All safes need two keys. The bank... has one and the tenant has the other. Now, I'm betting that Bob no longer has his key. I think the man who killed him has it.
Reject their love, leave a void in their soul? Voids can be filled. There is room for so much within a human soul, Father. More than God or love. Something that nourishes it in a way it can't even dream of.
Now you have to take a pottery class. You know, I actually made a mug for my mom at summer camp. - You did? - Yes. I bet she still has it.
I'm sure you'll understand. - Can you do me a favor? - Yes. Can you get rid of this gun? I just... I don't want it in the house.
But its flaw was that it didn't have the normal, boring institutional controls that are necessary to make it progress. A lot of money has been lost. Nobody knows if they lost it, if it was stolen by them, if they embezzled it. But the important lesson from Gox is not that Bitcoin doesn't work. The important lesson is that you shouldn't leave your money with an outside entity because they can't always be trusted. You can only trust them to a certain extent. It was also a lesson that people should have learned during the financial crisis. But they don't seem to have learned it.
And I think that gave us a renewed sense of urgency. And we realized that if we set the right regulations, we would create more confidence in Bitcoin, to be honest, as opposed to the loss of confidence that we've seen. Not only in the case of Silk Road, but also the collapse of Mt. Gox. Your opinion of the regulators, I assume you've had conversations. THE FIRST FUND FOR BITCOINS From the conversations we've had, I think everyone recognizes innovation and doesn't want to stop it.
Wasn't your hair darker? I just think it's a great opportunity for our sauce. "Our sauce?" From one moment to the next, Cam calls it "our sauce"? I got the recipe from my great-aunt, who got it from her mother, who stole it from a blind maid.
- Yes, of course you do, Troy. Was it because solitary confinement was the only place where they couldn't catch you, the only place where you felt safe? Yes. And why do you have that tattoo? They said that... if I didn't have it, if I didn't let them do it... they'd keep beating me every day.
You still think it has to do with money, the price of wheat in winter. It has to do with everything. With you, with me, with Woody, with your girl... - What girl? - The color of my mother's handbag, when I threw it off the Serpentine Bridge, when she wouldn't let me ride the merry-go-round. What girl?
- Thanks a lot, man. - Right, hold on. What's up? Why the change of plans, Rip? If you go back to that ship, we all go back to that ship. In fact, I never left it.
- Yes. A special message has just arrived from Paris with a letter from Tom. - From Tom? - For me. Neil found it. He sent it.
That's right! Well done. -It's squirming. -Of course it is, it's a worm! It'll stop wriggling when you put it on the hook.
Oh, my God. He can walk. - How long have you lived here? - Almost a year. It's hard to believe, given the state the house was in when we bought it.
There. It was right there until that moment. My first night in the house. A death. But I can't see it.
I only have one big reservation. - Claire. - Yes, sir. Well, between you and me, I'm not even sure this gun bill is going to pass. If they ask me to support it, you know what kind of trouble...
Tariq has already admitted that it's his gun. Tariq doesn't have a gun. But you do. Do you? - You know I'm not careless. - So where did you find it?
Yes, I can. Your cell phone has an application created by Fiona to control cars that have her software. You tried to use it to control your car. But she stopped you. Once she has your phone, retrieve the data from the app and prove that you used it to cause the deaths of those two men.
- Where are you going? - To the bathroom. Do you want to come with me? I like Raina, but she signed the petition. The imam who circulated it defamed the country.
Your intuition has been right so far. My intuition hasn't solved the case yet. No, it hasn't. But whoever is behind this is a dangerous son of a bitch, - and good at hiding. - I'll keep looking until I find the knife and whoever used it to cut his throat.
- E? - We've already examined it. The bomb was in the trunk, placed in the space under the spare tire. So it was hidden? If I'd opened the trunk, I wouldn't have seen it.
- If we're supposed to be hermetically sealed from germs, how the hell did it get in here? More importantly, how do we get out? Why would you want to leave? If you have the disease, they can treat you. - We don't have it.
We continue this echo until his voice disappears. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I love this. I had told myself that I would learn to live with blindness, but that I would never accept it.
By the time you read this, I'll be long gone. But know that the healer's touch has changed me. For the first time in my life, I have no desire to kill. I won't take any more hearts and may God forgive my sins". Does he think this will slow down my quest? That it will stop it?
Eighteen months ago I was dying. My wrist still hurts when the temperatures are negative, but apart from that... Something like that affects you mentally and physically, Catherine. I told you about the possibility of retirement. I didn't want it then and I still don't, boss.
Shoulder-length blonde hair, small build. I have a photo on file. Shaf and I went to talk to HR at the store where she works. We have a photocopy. - Shall I send it to you?
He has a string of convictions and is on the Sex Offenders List. He had sex with a 14-year-old girl. That was 10 years ago. The van was seized in response to the assault and rape of a woman in the early hours of the morning. Forensics is already analyzing it. I spoke to the supervisor who knows we're investigating him.
Waylon, you haven't seen my special cigar box around, have you? I could have sworn I left my "Padrón" cigars here. Right here. Yes, it's right here. I hid it so Mrs. Carroll wouldn't find it.
He had no will and no relatives. But the court wants everything sold quickly to get the taxes. What I want you to see is in the attic. The chest alone is at least 200 years old. Don't worry, I hardly touched it when I first opened it.
-I've done it. -All right. Very good. So, what's the plan? If you can't renovate the house, you can't sell it, right?
No, not a chance. You can't track Jace through the parabatai link. It will weaken you both. Or break the link. Jace has already weakened it.
-And she's not wearing a scarf. -I don't see anyone who is. Wait, there. It's the scarf. The woman who changed Robyn's life was also the one who took it.
Jesus. Are you doing this to change what you've done? But only a Time Wizard can do that. I did all the research I could. And one day, I realized I was thinking the wrong way. We don't have the energy. But we don't need it to generate it, because someone already has it.
This is like the "beginning" of real life. We're only concerned with the here and now, please. Right now... neurons can be genetically modified to be more sensitive to light. They respond to blue light from the fiber optic wire inserted inside the brain, just like that. They recently reported using opto-genetics to implant a false memory in the brain of a rat and I think they've used it to implant false memories of these hugs
Actually, I don't know. An old family story. I was trying to avoid the whole thing. A vendetta between two families and... I couldn't help it.
There is no jailer. The inmates are in charge. However, they are at the service of Venganza. She lets them fight, and the toughest, the strongest humans or culebras, can run the prison. I guess you could say she runs it like a snake pit.
- I didn't know you were a fan. - It was a one-sided discussion. - Looking for something? - The key to my bag. I seem to have lost it.
Yes, we're working on getting you the access code. Anything you can do to make sure we don't succeed would be greatly appreciated. Can we get that thing out of our house? What happened to it? The courier didn't want it, that's what happened.
Anything you can do to make it unsuccessful would be greatly appreciated. Can we get that thing out of our house? What happened to it? The post office didn't want it, that's what happened. And I don't want it in my house, not with my children.
Marcus was here, I took a bath, so we must be lovers. There's a saying about dipping your quill in the company ink. Of course, it's Detective Bell's quill, but you get the idea. So it's like he said? He just came to borrow a racket? Yes, but I couldn't find it.
I'm trying to immortalize something I've been working on for a long time. Shut up! I still haven't decided what I think about masturbation. It's strange and I don't know where to start. Because, on the one hand, it feels good. Did you think I wouldn't use it, idiots?
I'll divert your call. Hello, what's going on? Is this where there's a leak? I'm the one who called. Do you want me to fix it from here?
He had some deep cuts, possibly from glass or metal. As a precaution, we gave him a tetanus shot. What does this image mean? Do you recognize it? I've seen it.
And... what are you doing here now? You recruit too many. Well, I'll drink to that. I was actually coming to see if I could convince anyone to put together a dig team. You got Carnarvon to buy that concession as soon as Davis let it go.
I couldn't save his. I couldn't save his. You had a few scenes with your pretend gun today. Do you have any idea where you might have dropped it? I didn't drop it.
- Beth. - What are you talking about now? That's why she wanted to kill me. Beth put a gun to my head. And it was Evie who put it in her hand.
Just... Regarding last night, the message was received. Loud and clear. What was the message? You said you got it loud and clear.
You wouldn't come to see a 1000 dollar an hour lawyer at this time of night if everything was fine. Better? Yeah. You know that fishing company I asked you to buy? There's no physical way to prove that I'm the one buying it, right?
Don't give up yet. She's right, Sheema. I can't ask them to die for nothing. What if there was another way into the building? I can't believe I've lost her.
I can't ask them to die for nothing. What if there was another way into the building? I can't believe I missed it. - Oh, my God. - Someone took her after she was already dead.
At first I was skeptical, but inside these walls we are free from the horror outside. Or maybe they're hiding from reality. I had a friend who thought like that. Walls and barricades meant safety, but... eventually the real world arrives. If there's a better alternative, I've never found it.
Or if you want to stay up here and behave like a teenager, you can do that too. Wait a minute. I need to show you something. The Author's quill? I thought you'd destroyed it.
It made me feel stupid, the file synchronization is confusing. I put videos in the main folder, it says it's uploading but I don't see anything. Everything is supposed to be on the phone and iPad but it says "zero K used", there's nothing there. It's describing the platform and highlighting what's good about it. None of them understand it.
- What about the download button? Did they really forget about that? Richard, why didn't they... - Who designed this thing? - I designed it.
Especially during possible inspections by regulatory bodies. I also had photos of my aunt. Gilfoyle, have you seen her? No, I haven't. Richard, keep an eye out for her.
I told him to give it to the Satanists. - Looks like she did! - Does she know 400 Satanists? The Catholic Church didn't do well there. Remember when Gilfoyle said my app was shit and no one would use it?
Saying that Mateo wasn't trying to stop Barrios. He may have been involved. Mrs. Ortega... I have to ask you, the van at your house... Do you know if Mateo used it three nights ago?
What about Bernard? Bernard, yes. But who am I? That's a very complex question, to which I can only give a simple answer. You are the perfect instrument. The ideal partner. The way any tool associates with the hand that uses it.
Is it time to have "the talk" with your father? Because he's going to have to read a few things first. No, I'm tearing it down. Ralph has a cool tree house, and mine sucks. Well, Bart, your father built it, and he did the best he could.
But one day you'll understand that giving our family a better life... Something I've never been able to do... is the most important thing in the world. We've been given a third ball. Let's not waste it.
That's why I'm calculating the exact time and place the airship will land in the Mediterranean. Where the Navy Seals pick up the backpack. If you miscalculate, you'll be handing a big gun to a neighbor Washington doesn't like. Trust me, I can do it. Just in case you can't, I want to take a picture of that technology, because if we lose it forever, I want proof of what Rahal was trying to build.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin... But my capsule went off course... and by the time I got here, my cousin had grown up and become Superman. So I hid my powers... until recently, when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world. To most people, I'm an assistant at CatCo Worldwide Media... But secretly, I work with my adopted sister at the DOE... to protect my city from extraterrestrial life and anyone who might harm it.

I realized that the "Kryptonians" were using my LTE network. That's why they broke into my lab for Christmas. They're using my satellites to send neural signals directly into the minds of everyone in National City. They scramble the signal before it reaches my brain. If you've invented a technology that blocks the Myriad, why haven't you handed it over to the DOE?

A cup full of the warmth of the south. The modest Hippocrene. You know your stuff. Wisdom is funny. More than one person is known to have it.
Maybe we should go back, huh? Yes, that's right. Why don't you run home to Mommy? We came here to chase death. It shouldn't surprise us that we find it.
-Is he having difficulties? -A little. It would be strange if he wasn't. Anyway, if I want to succeed, we'll both need all the help we can get. You're certainly surrounded by good people who can offer it.
If you have information that can help us... We don't have time for this. Speak. Jaha's backpack. - What's in it? - It's what runs the AI. If we destroy the backpack, we'll almost certainly destroy her.
Barrett has nothing to do with this. I didn't know we were still negotiating. The key. See? I told you I had it.
What is it? The Cosmic Treadmill. It's a time machine that uses my super-speed. At least, theoretically. The Flash and I had the plans for this machine, but we never tested it.
Yes. But in search of your vocation, you tried a bit of everything. That's true. I started painting very late. And now that you've found it, you'll never leave it, will you?
And then you'll have the power to steal this brain and activate my time-travel spell for your own benefit! And only for your benefit! - Because that's what I would do. - No. You want revenge and until you get it, you'll never be satisfied.
But look, a testimonial isn't rocket science. There is a way of dealing with them. Did you know that? There are actually five simple rules. When they ask you a question, if you don't understand it, all you have to do is ask them to repeat it.
There's no point in digging around in this mess. I'll do it. Go inside. Okay. Should we get x-rays or something before we open it?
Maybe?" Question mark. "I'm at Le Petit Paris every night from 8pm until they kick me out." And then sign: "Foolish Heart." So you have a new cell phone and she has a new number, and whoever had that number before you should have gotten that message. I know I should have replied when I got it, but I didn't, I waited.
We don't use magic, Cass. We're librarians. - We use our brains. - And mine is telling me that we should use magic. We have the largest collection of magic in the world, right here in this building, and we never use it to our advantage.
My husband would go shopping, cook, bring me the food. We'd open the door, he'd hand me the plate and I'd eat inside the Faraday cage. I've also heard it called a "supersense", where for some reason we have the ability to sense these frequencies. It's a very legitimate illness. But at this point, I don't consider it a gift.
The medical team has arrived. Sanchez is on his way to hospital. I can't believe Walter bought a cotton candy machine. I can't believe it either. But they just left it here?
Do you think this was a warning? Or a message. They've already sent a message. Literally. Or they're doing it like Shahzad in Times Square. The bomb was supposed to be worse, but the idiot who built it was pretty incompetent.
Or Paige. The music. The music that Slavich and McCarthy used to communicate. What about it? When we played it for Slavich's wife, I saw something, not the way I see it with my own eyes.
So be it, sir. Flynn, do you want to say the prayer? - It's been a while. - Stay honest, you'll do fine. Dear Father, thank you for this food and for the hands that prepared it.
Right, right, right. Most of the people here run away, Dad, they don't even know from what. Walt, I know you're doing what you believe in, but you have to try to stop making things worse. You said you had a trump card with the drug case. MD wants the story hushed up, but the Times already has it.
What time did you get home? After 1:00, 1:15? - Was it his gun? - I have no idea. I've never seen it before, but it's possible it was his.
What can we do about it? - Show me the letter. - Why do you care? Parshya, give me the letter. Mangya, why do you want it?
A dumpster collector found it in a garbage bag. The gun was clean, but not the bullets in the comb. Check it out. The fingerprints match Bardot's. If Bardot loaded it, then he stole it from the Academy.
I don't care, look at me. Who was watching you? Who are you working with? Agent Booth, my client has already said he wants to confess to Allison Monroe's death. I understand, but I have questions that need answers. Quickly returning to the references to blood, there was a knife at Agent Booth's throat and he didn't use it.
Because I don't want to kill you, Stefan. That doesn't make sense. Believe me. I know you don't deserve the mark. But someone does. What if I told you that there's a way for me to transfer it to someone who deserves it?
We got a lead. This is security camera footage of Linda Peavy outside a café five blocks from the conference. It's a dark delivery. The dirty bomb is in that backpack. And this is the man who left it for her 10 minutes earlier.
You know, doctors have been using hydrotherapy as a treatment for nervous exhaustion forever. They used to put insane people in these things. And no matter how crazy you were, after an hour, you were super calm. But that water looks really hot. A hydrotherapy tub should be practically scalding, almost to the point where you can't stand it.
My face is on that tape. All right, but I'm going, okay? The feds are looking for you, not me. Where is it? I think I left it by that weird lamp in the living room.
The description matches one of the suspects in your codename case. Wait a minute. Were you here tonight? Did you find the cab? If this is really the guy, why did we burn this house down? Why didn't we put it under surveillance?
Before moving in with the Callaghans, where were you living? With friends. And then in a cheap hotel. What did you do with the key to your hotel room? I think I left it in a bowl on the counter.
But not everyone would be. I should put that beauty in the garage. - I don't have one. - Do you? Just out of curiosity, you don't have a garage because you converted it into the guest house where your grandson is taking a bath?
It's the woman he was waiting for last night, the fake profile. - Moment of death in 20 seconds. - Maybe she recorded her own death. Is the camera recording? He hasn't turned it on yet.
- and cancel their cards. - I'll take care of it. Wait a minute. Isn't this a long shot? The chemical paid to make that biological weapon is on the loose and we don't know who's going to ship it to Balio.
- I'll take care of it. Wait a minute. Isn't this a long shot? The chemical paid for to make that biological weapon is on the loose and we don't know who's going to ship it to Balio. All we have is the guy who stole it, and if we don't find him, a million people could die.
I called the university health center. Scott and five other colleagues were hospitalized a month ago with an undefined streptococcus infection. Undefined? That's scary. And suspicious. I called the laboratories in the area to see if anyone had seen it. The biomedical research lab in Lynwood not only knew about it, but created it.
This woman must have spent years without moving a cup. From the degenerative lesions on her hands and feet, I'd say she suffered from chronic arthritis, wouldn't you? I need a medical history, but that's what it looks like. I'd have trouble opening the fridge, let alone putting this ottoman on the balcony. Do you think someone else put it there?
Let's try this again. What exactly did Dalton do? Our company manages computer systems for the NSA. Since Dalton was in charge, he obtained a high-level access license. We think he used it to download - classified material.
The hourglass. It's not in the Christmas photo, which was taken only months before. It could be a recent purchase or they could have moved it from somewhere else in the house. Except that we know the suspect spends an hour at each crime scene. What if he brought it with him as a kind of stopwatch?
It's still breathing. It's Bash, he's alive. We have to stop them! -Give me your sword. -I don't have it anymore.
Girls, look. I told Heartlake Studio that we're going to do an article about Livi in Star Moment magazine and they invited us to Livi's press conference. Do you think Livi has heard our song? How could she not? And I bet she loves it.
And that was just a sample. I'm premiering my next hit Girlz at my concert this Saturday night. Did she just say her hit? So it sounds like she liked it? Yes, she liked my song so much that she stole it.
- Livi, anything special for Christmas? - Who's your best friend? Livi, tell the truth, did you write that song? Well, sometimes lyrics come out fully formed, as if they were meant just for me. But this is our song, we wrote it.
We need to find our demo. Start looking. I'll look in the closet. There are too many things. We'll never find it.
Actually, I don't think she did. Please, it's clear that fame has gone to her head. Ordinary people don't matter anymore. I don't think she knows it's our song. - But she said she wrote it.
Well, the Teardrops and I have recorded our new song. Great, play it for the songwriters. But I have it here, already mixed. Okay, give it to me. You're not going to break it, are you?
I don't understand, that song... It's ours. It's what we were looking for in your room. Only girls who have real friends could have written that song. Megan says she wrote it, but I know it's your song.
My scar didn't hurt yesterday, I was just ashamed of having one. - Emma. - No, it's horrible. No, it's not. You haven't seen it yet.
-Thank you. -Are you going to report the call? The ladder was ready for the aerial tube. Lieutenant, I don't feel right putting you in the middle of this. The position of the ladder... it wasn't part of our rescue, maybe we shouldn't report it, you know?
Show some respect. Who's going to get hit? Who's going to get it? Remember this? Is this when he takes off a glove and gives it to a kid before the fight?
No, you can't. Wait, wait. I'm so sorry to bother you, ma'am. I know it's late and you were getting ready for bed, and I'm embarrassed to admit it, but this is all my fault. Lee got a package for me a couple of weeks ago, and he kept telling Jake he'd bring it, and he never did, and that's why we're being such a pain.
I don't know. It's this high, this long... maybe. Bloody hell! It's not here. Maybe he's already taken it.
- Good evening. Robert used to sing that song to the kids all the time. Yes, I know. Danny told me. That's why I learned it.
4 hours later, a Taliban sniper put a bullet in my husband's neck, severing his carotid artery, killing him almost instantly. I didn't blame the sniper. I didn't even blame the government or the energy companies. I blamed myself. I had an opinion, and I didn't express it.
He passed away in January. Our condolences. The gun isn't registered. I have the paperwork. I.. I just haven't sent it yet.
Which may well happen, unless we agree on a plan to disarm it, and fast. I'll send a team of engineers. - No, you won't. - The weapon is ours. In my country, and you can't even carry it without stepping on our land, how are you going to disarm it?
Nothing stood between you and work. Yes, but I could put it aside if it meant having the chance to raise a daughter like Joy. It's easy to say that now because you know who Joy has become. But 30 years ago, would you put your career aside to change diapers, watch teeth come in and face crying nights? Hayden had to make a decision, and maybe it was the wrong one, but don't pretend you don't understand why she made it.
-Having a threesome with a serial killer? No! -What could go wrong? -This is the murder weapon. Distract Austin long enough for me to find the knife. Let's hope you don't find it in one of our backs.
- Would you like a drink? - No. But I'll have a drink if you have one. I noticed on Saturday that your porch light was out. I thought you'd fixed it.
I've been calling them, and... and it just rings and rings... They... must have hung up the phone. I keep thinking about my doll's house when I was ten. Three floors. My father built it.
Virginia found out that we interviewed the Clavermores. She reported it to Masters and now it's very possible that we'll be taken off the case. We knew there might be this possibility. I'm sure the interview was recorded. And obviously, no one has listened to it yet, otherwise we'd be packing our things.
Just me and the cook, Joe. - He's only been here a short time. - How long? She fired the last one about a week ago? You destroyed the bomb. Well, I soaked it and hoped it would destroy it.
What do you think? No, what do you think? I think you're angrier than you can bear. You didn't answer my question. I think there is a choice, even when there doesn't seem to be one, but it's the reaction that determines whether the choice is good or bad, not the person making it.
I didn't know who else to call. It's ironic. Well, there's paperwork ready to be signed, so... But... - There was a decision made, and no one will say who made it.
You can start cooperating now. Do you recognize this? There's a camera inside and it was on the poker table. What was it? The robbers' warning shots almost hit her.
What about the love you get from people? One thing's for sure. I'm not in the same trouble as you. If your regime doesn't have the strength to take a joke, then you don't have a regime. There's an expression, I don't know if you have it:
It's forbidden to protest, because the army doesn't want violence. But people won't be violent. They've closed the square and now you want to go in? This is violence. They only closed it to ban demonstrations.
- I understand. - No, you don't. This thing has a 20% to 90% death rate, and I shook hands with a sick man. I have a wife and a baby at home, and I could die of fever at any time. So if you've come for my blessing, you don't have it.
It's an excellent proposal. 3 YEARS 30 MILLION Rick! How are things in the Big Easy? I'm ready to leave. - Are they already trying to trick you? - No, it's a good offer, but for a city with so much soul, I'm not feeling it.
If you give me that commission! I don't think you'll get a commission for finding Didi's house. Why not, I found it? We already knew it existed. And now you know it exists, even more so because I found it! - Welcome home.
- Yes, me too. - I don't want any water. - Open the bottle and drink. I'm not thirsty. Do you want me to open it, like the kids do?
So he taught her to be observant. Why should she regret it? Because now I love details. His leg. Yes, everyone looks at that, but... I saw the way he covered it with a blanket to make it look normal.
- It's a second drone. A second drone? Do you want help finding the missing head? I don't know. Do you think you'll find it before I do?
Angie, I found the murder weapon. - It's a hatchet. - Holy shit. - Do you know whose it was? - No. The problem is that it was used by the whole team. But I think the killer held it like this.
She's a lost cause. - If we talk about movies. - Really. Anyway, it was an excellent job. And if a French tapestry is the murder weapon, I can guess where we might find it.
That's what they said about Ted Bundy. We have the results of Ruby's ultrasound test. She's seven weeks pregnant, which means it's Stommer's. I called the owners of the house in Bristol. They told Stommer to put her on the market six months ago. He didn't list her on the MLS until last week, which means he's been staying in the house.
I feel like my life is an enigma. No more than usual. Would you tell me if I was losing my mind? DiNozzo reason? Because I feel like I've lost it.
- What's up? - Everything's fine. Sit down, please. Lucas, to sum up: our friend here has drug money, but he can't spend it because he's too conspicuous.
It requires a lot of trust, because I have a solution. But for it to work, what you need to do, Captain, is allow the missile to be launched. I'm sorry, Walter. I thought I heard you say that we should let the missile launch. Yes! The warhead travels so fast, in seconds it will be so far from the submarine that the system will no longer be able to control it.
Look, I've been doing this time-travel thing for a while now. And if I've learned one thing, it's that you never know what might change history and have huge consequences. What? You think this doesn't make me angry? But we have a job to do. And if we don't do it, we could make things a lot worse.
I know you're upset with me, so thank you for coming anyway. We were afraid you'd kill us if we didn't come. Too soon? Probably. I cross-referenced the list with the city census, which narrowed it down to six targets.
Why would I be jealous? You've been looking for King Solomon's tomb for over 15 years. We spoke to the dean of your department. He told us about his obsession. How it ruined his marriage - and almost destroyed it.
No, no, no. If you cut the wrong one, it could die. Walter, do you know why the wolf spider is a Darwinian marvel? Because it lives alone. That's what makes it superior.
There's nothing important... - There you go. - Thank you. Thank you. You won't believe it. An elephant was stolen from the circus last night, and the police haven't found it yet.
Why don't you tell us everything you know, and save yourself the trouble of being arrested. Do it, and you have my word that we will protect you. I was contacted this morning. The caller said that for 10 million dollars he could make that gun disappear. Otherwise, he would put it back where he found it.
He's very handsome. And you also have a rabbit bracelet. - You must love rabbits. - My mother gave it to me. She said I should never take it off.
- You point this, pull this part, and... The bad guy falls. It's lethal. If I can't shoot Jelco, it'll have to be you. - I can't kill. - I can't kill. You cut off your sister's hand and strapped a bomb to Jelco's heart. - Yes, but I didn't set it off.
What the hell does that mean? Do you have a problem with my doctor? It's more complicated than that. The bullet... It's located near the C5 nerve root. You said you could get it out.
You're always so kind. Obviously, there was someone you wanted to see. She must have seen you pass by and closed the door, as if she was busy. I thought the same as you. Wait, am I going to tell this story or are you?
Yesterday, I opened the security box for the first time since poor Nicotra's tragic death and realized that the gun wasn't there. No? Who was going to take it out? Commissioner. I'm sorry to have to tell you, but I think Nicotra took it himself.
Commissioner, are you joking? No. Are you thinking of going to prison? To listen to Rosales we need a judge's authorization! If we don't have it, it's because you didn't give it to us, it's over!
I'm out. Let's go. Where are you going? We have class. Not if I don't give it.
For the lady too. Well... And what is the purpose of this new visit? Have you thought about my proposal? To abandon the third sector in my favor? I didn't even take it seriously.
Why? As they said, to protect me. Have you used it yet? No. I haven't had to, thank God. Be grateful they didn't use it against you.
Look at the kid. This kid was only 16. We're all going to die one day, aren't we? Yeah, right. So... the "thing" you've been putting in your body, is "laced" with an opioid called fentanyl, and most people who have used it, - don't live to do it again.
Why do I look like your daughter? I don't know. It's the truth, Yala. It's not enough. The truth is usually like that. But that doesn't make it a lie.
A place where the values of the Faith are protected? If the tree is more than religious symbolism, nothing here says where it was kept. Half the references say it was stolen by the Devil. My people were on a sacred mission to find it again. - Good. Devil is what they call Aneela, right? They must know where she took it.
Don't tell me people believe her? That snake has a lot of charm. What about you? Have you ever left? Sometimes you have to leave home to protect her.
- Do you even know what a blog is? It's going to change the world. You've been saying that for years. It's not tied to any government, banks or regulations. Everyone in the world can use it.
No, thank you. Let me remind you. I have a job. And let me remind you that this blade doesn't just kill humans. It also obliterates celestial beings, including demons. Let's say the detective finds it and takes it home...
That was strange. And you were insisting that I tell her everything. Audrey, I swear to you, I recorded our conversation by accident! - You sent it by accident too? - I didn't send it to her!
The killer put it there. That's how he found out about the recording. He hasn't been watching us. He's been listening to us! He knew I'd bring it.
He was working on the security of a small sector of Bratva, giving us information about rival gangs. Nadine, if it got out that the FBI was helping a Russian spy... Homeland Security did us a favor. Look, Voydian called me. He said he had information that would get him killed. He said he'd only pass it on to me.
- The Rav takes care of it. The Rav will take care of it. Okay, good. Good. I didn't want to take her either.
Mr. Mishra, a bridge collapsed due to heavy rains. Do I put it as "natural disaster" or "corruption"? - Mr. Sinha, how old was the bridge? - Twenty-five years old. Twenty-five years old. Surely some great soul built it.
Santa will always know where your kind heart is. Wherever you are in the world. Boss? The wood is wet. We can't light it.
What do you need? I've got a lead. A guy. He says he might have a tip. Yeah, well, why don't you give it to Martinez?
Where did you get this? It was used to assassinate the President of Ukraine. Did you? And you come here thinking that if it's my bullet, I must have fired it. Or that you sold it to the person who fired it.
I'm trying to reconnect this fence, but I've got a pack of wolf-like things on the other side of the door, and it doesn't look good. - If you come, we'll all die. - We can handle them. You know I'm a selfish son of a bitch. If there was any chance of me getting out of here alive, don't you think I'd use it?
The asshole got bitten and didn't tell anyone. He infected four of my men. I had to arrest him there. And this fucking plane had a hard time getting off the ground. Every time I started it up, it fucked up a joint.
- I don't want to be part of this. Dlim-dlam. We're not professionals! Shut your mouth! Before I rip it off your face and throw it in a dumpster.
I thought you forgot things because you were eccentric, crazy or stupid. But that was a lie. You hid things from me on purpose. - You lied to me. - I didn't lie. I just didn't tell you the whole truth because I didn't understand it...
It's impossible to cover them all. If anyone comes in... Wait a minute. Will they come here? This thing is the most sacred of your... things. They won't like that we took it.
- Did they kill us? - The shark certainly did. - Where's that machine? - Right here. Right here. We assembled it ourselves, so some parts may be upside down...
Halfway through. But it's my last coin, which only lets you get it wrong once. Stone, this is the coin of my vision, the one I'll give to the museum in the future, and that means, if I'm going to give it to the museum in the future... It can't be destroyed today. And it means that no matter where I throw it, it has to be safe.
- Catch it! Since you're so concerned about the environment. I don't remember anything in particular. I may not have been a saint, but it's not like I was a murderer. I wasn't an arsonist. I never found a wallet on the floor, I thought about returning it, but the owner was from out of town, I took the money and left the wallet where I found it.
Don't pretend this is about ideologies, you did it for money. Mac, have you asked yourself why the government wants the gun? What do they want to do with it? - We're out of time, Mac. - Even if they find it, the people I work for won't stop until they get it back.
I don't really like the idea of being friends with a mass murderer. Delaney? We changed the story, it never happened. She's still the creator of the most destructive weapon ever. - If the army didn't take her...
South door, go. I closed the valve you opened remotely, it's no use trying. Major Capado didn't have the courage to come? I assume you're talking about Major Gleason, who took the antimatter yesterday. He didn't come, and we're the ones who stole it from him.
Empathy... or naivety. Choose for yourself. Testing? Testing me why? I know you have sensitive information and I don't want you to divulge it.
- She's right. - I know she's right. - Papa? - I love this city. I certainly do.
Many of you have asked me to sing, so I know you like to hear me. Obviously. You wouldn't ask if you didn't like it, so... I'm going to sing a song for a big fan who asked for it.
Love shack, baby I'm taking the Atlanta freeway - What do you think? - It was great. You're fantastic. It was my new fan who asked for it, Patrice.
I'll take care of it! Just worry about tonight's show. I'll worry about the viral video. Owen! I just made a beautiful entrance and you didn't see it!
So what am I going to lose? Junior commander! Forgive us for being late! Men, open the lock! You're not the ones who open it!
- I wrote and directed it. The action takes place in a strip bar. Two gangsters take a pastor, a drug dealer and a pregnant teenager hostage during Hurricane Katrina. It's a big problem. I'm glad you're going to tell that story. We've already adapted it for the movies.
The tragedy, for me, of the bus... It was as if we had lost our nerve. Instead of taking advantage of the technology that had given us the Moon, and saying well, let's go to Mars, we ended up on a shuttle that went nowhere. We entered lower Earth orbit for the next forty years. And I think many people felt a certain amount of betrayal. So far, previous generations since Apollo haven't picked up that torch and carried it forward.
He won't say no. At least, I don't. Where did it hit? I think Tyler was seasick, leaned over the edge, and... I didn't see the buoy until the boat hit it.
As I was saying, El Hamadi's messenger has it. I imagine he's meeting him right now. - Do you know who the messenger is? - Unfortunately, no. My idea was to find Morad, give him back the diamonds in exchange for the messenger's name, and catch him before he could deliver it.
And I open it very slowly. I turn the knob so slowly that you can literally hear the spring inside retracting. Like every little piece. And you're like: "That's a quiet fucking door." But you're the only ones who can hear it.
I turn the knob so slowly that you can literally hear the spring inside retracting. Like every little piece. And you're like: "That's a quiet little door." But you're the only ones who can hear it. And then when you unlock it, you have to open it quickly.
She belongs in prison. And I won't stop looking for her until she's there. I shouldn't show this to a civilian, but that's how we do it at work. The secret to a perfect burger is mixing the meat. If you don't do it right...
But as long as I'm here and we haven't heard from one of our men, we won't do anything that could jeopardize our safety. I agreed to wait 12 hours. The terrorists came to our house and killed our people. All the sacrifices we make to eradicate them from the face of the earth are sacrifices worth making. When we have a snake in our kitchen, we don't invite it to dinner, we cut off its head!
- Yes, that's it. - It's impossible. - I know, it's impossible. All right, I'll open it. Unless whoever sent it is a magician.
Come up with a solution. Make it up. We have to save the women and children. And the letter. - As I said, Travis didn't finish it.
If you need a more detailed consultation in this case, my door is always open. Lock the door. This one is much bigger than the last one. Don't we want to send a message? - I think we already have.
When the Cookbook was associated with Columbine and the more recent Karl Pierson massacre, I felt responsible. But I didn't. And I wonder about the responsibility of the worker who produces the Smith Wesson or the Colt. What responsibility does he have when the gun is misused? I don't like that analogy, so let's not pick it.
She's beautiful. - What are you talking about? - You idiot. She loves you. He checked in, as he was told, but he didn't board. So we took his suitcase. Since no one claimed it, it came here.
- I'm still having sex with my ex. - Am I in your art? - Yes, I am. - But that doesn't sound very provocative. - Fuck off. You haven't seen her yet.
Where is it? Who is it? When does it happen? That's the mystery. I don't know. The guy who brought her in said he worked at Dark Matter, which is a café.
But the evidence is very clear that humans don't need to eat a lot of protein and, when they do, it results in many health problems. Human protein needs are only a small percentage of calories, maybe two and a half, three percent of calories. If you eat the plant foods with the least protein from the plant kingdom, which would be foods like rice, you're getting eight or nine percent protein. So you won't be lacking in protein. But the promoters of low-carbohydrate diets, the promoters of sports drinks, bars and all that sort of thing insist and advertise to the public that you really do have to eat more protein. It's simply not true. In practical terms, in reality, the way we humans work, we get optimal levels of protein if we only ingest it through vegetables.
I understand, I can relate. I won't tell anyone that moderation is easy. Moderation is hard as hell. Very difficult. I haven't mastered it yet.
We're talking about enough energy for Lollapalooza... Or to recharge the mother ship. Are you saying you restricted the location to this neighborhood? No. I'm saying I restricted it to this block.
What do you mean? It has to be. There's no trace of radiation. It's a long way from here. Maybe we're too early and they haven't put it in yet.
The waiter said that Calvin was normally harmless, so something must have changed in him. Maybe a 100-dollar bill? That's a big bill for a beggar. Or for anyone, for that matter. Why didn't the killer get it back?
- We know who didn't kill him. And a painting worth a million has disappeared. We found the painting and the killer. I went to everyone's house. Nobody had it. - They said Bruno had it.
And a painting worth a million disappeared. We found the painting and the murderer. I went to everyone's house. Nobody had it. - They said Bruno had it. - He didn't have it.
- Keyser Soze. From the movie 'The Suspects'? I don't like movies very much. On the way back, she told us that she knew Bruno was a thief, but didn't go to the police because he wanted to redeem himself. She says she found the painting and was going to take it to the police.
- Very bad. - I want an OR on hold. And I want it now. Is Robbie in surgery? Yes, he had a brain hemorrhage. They took him out as soon as they detected it.
This is the sword that killed you. - That will kill me. - Why is it here? I don't know. But now that we have it, maybe we can find out who's responsible.
Edwards, what are the requirements for an emergency liver transplant? Acute liver failure, thrombosis and uncontrollable bleeding. That's right. I don't remember many successful cases of this surgery. - That's why we're not doing it.
- I don't want you to feel weird. You're right. You're out there. You have the chance of a new life. I want you to have it. No.
- Toby with... - Your secret husband? Yes, and all that stresses Sly out, - hence the nonsense. - Don't underestimate meditation. - Even the Navy uses it.
Don't say it. What's there to say? I gave my opinion. You ignored it. I didn't ignore it, I just...
I'm trying to help you. Look, I'm sorry I touched your precious blanket. That thing smells, by the way. It's the blanket that was left on it, Kevin. Well, that doesn't mean you can't wash it from time to time.
- I'm a recovering drug addict. And I'm black. And sometimes I realize that's all people see. Race triumphs over everything. I didn't choose it, I can't run away from it. It's not that I want to.
I can't do that. Seth, call the press. I'll make a statement. - It's the first press conference. - I didn't imagine it like this.
I can make it available to you. And why should you save my life? Because I want you to save mine. Call the number. Because of my chronic illness, I've become something of a specialist... in pain management, what causes it, and what prevents it.
We boarded the ship and found the loot. What could possibly go wrong? Stop kissing my treasure! It's mine because I saw it first! I saw this ship first! So the first claim on everything is mine!
Yeah? Well, it looks more like a de Chardin piece to me. Boys, listen up. Our objective has arrived. He must have the bag somewhere, but I can't see it.
Well... Thank you for your time. I really appreciate it. That's fine. Come back tomorrow to give you the recommendation. Are you still going to write it?
And, Nick, have you met Jordan? She plays golf, and she's what the kids will call "DUFF" one day. Hi, yeah. Nice hat. I'll drink your finger bowl if you don't want it.
For a beetle smaller than a thumbnail, it's like climbing a dune twice as high as Everest. But the most impressive thing is what it does afterwards. Completely still, facing the wind, the beetle does a headstand. The fog begins to condense over its body. Microscopic elevations direct the water into grooves that channel it towards its mouth.
But we're not actually going to attack them, so you're just accumulating the usual sea miles? I wish it were that simple. A few hours before the fake attack was broadcast, someone hacked the NSA and downloaded 200 gigs of data. We don't even know what exactly was taken. But do you think someone has stolen a cyber weapon and is now using it to start a war?
His father wanted to teach him what a real job was, as if being a tutor was a job. Does it have to be? No, it doesn't. But I love this story, so shut up. I don't think I've heard it a dozen times.
There was a tree at the top. A big oak. I kissed her for the first time under the tree. My God, it must have been incredible. I knelt down, took out the ring box. The problem was that I opened it backwards.
- After they abandoned me? - We didn't have a chance. - Do you have the key? - Yes, I do. - Let's get out of here. - Bonnie still has it around her neck.
He boasted that he had bought it unfinished from a receiver and had built it himself at home. He said it was good not to get caught. He sent the letter to ease his conscience. Look for prints, DNA, examine the ink, the paper, everything. We have to find out who wrote it.
I knew that if I held on, someone would help me. Thank you, Ms. Morrison. Hayes, please. But there are no guarantees. Right now, we don't know who wrote it.
"In three and a half hours, we're going to kill a guard." And this wasn't the first time we'd been given this kind of information. It was a message clearly aimed at the media. From a distance, we couldn't read the prisoners' threat. The prison officials had already heard it.
Al Capone? It takes a lot of guts to con Al Capone. All right, how much did that Eiffel Tower scam get you? In today's money, he would have sold the tower for a million dollars. VALUE IN CURRENT CASH: 1 MILLION DOLLARS Just the first time he sold it.
I found a psychologist in England who knows all about it. Dr. Lucy Beresford. Why do we get so upset when they don't work? Nowadays, printers and office equipment in general are designed to be very easy to use. PSYCHOLOGIST As soon as there's a fault and we can't fix it, we end up feeling helpless.
Maybe we should try to do it." E: "No." And then we decided to try it. And in fact, unbelievably, it works. It's a very simple mechanism. It has a spring and if you lift it, it opens, as if by magic.
He says that war for the Orcs solves everything. Then why are you here? To save my people. Fel takes much more than the lives of its victims. It kills the land and corrupts those who use it.
He told the truth. Captain Pollard's conscience was clear. But the inquiry was a sham. Pollard went out again... in search of the white whale. He never found it.
I don't care. When the market considers a bond too risky to buy, what do we do with it? -Guess. -You tell me. Do you think we just keep it on the books?
He's holding on to the door, so we had to fight. He pulls out his knife. He advances towards me, already very weak. That's when I took out my gun. As soon as he saw it, he gave up.
So you're the new guy. Actually, we've already met. A long time ago. See that cornerstone? I saw it when they put it here, it was just a cornfield.
- Kaulder, I've come to help. - Chloe. I told you not to... Immortality was never yours, it was mine. You just kept it for me.
-Don't photo shoots get on your nerves? -I know I'm beautiful. Make sure you sign a non-disclosure agreement, or you can't stay for the screening. What an incredible house. When did Vince buy it?
Anyway, John, for some reason, took exception to this, and wrote a letter. It was a very friendly letter. It ended with, "Well, what do you think of this?" It had his Ascot home phone number. So if I'd gotten the letter, you know, when he sent it, I would have called him.
No, I don't want to sell the house, man. I'm not selling the house. - That's Leila's house. - You don't have a choice, Billy. If you don't sell it, it's going to be pawned anyway.
I think that was stupid of me. Why don't you try again? Again. There, it moved. No, you moved it.
Again. There, it's moved. No, you moved it. Yes, because you made me move it. You see, I moved it because you wanted the bottle to move.
We're fed up, really we are. We've all been told: "Enjoy your children while they're young, it'll be over in a flash". I don't know what the hell they were talking about, because it seems to me that we'll never get a break. We're fed up with trying to pass responsibility on to you, but you won't take it.
Pete? No. Do you mind if I sit down? Did you know that marijuana is the most widely used illegal drug in the United States? That 100 million Americans have tried it at least once?
Sanchez! What was the boy's name again? Detective Nicks, you don't know how sorry I am for your loss. Tommy, your brother left a tape. It looks like he used it like a diary.
It must be a scratch or something. Stop looking at my dick. It's a bite. It's not a bite at all. I know a bite when I see one, Jon.
If I hear again that you threw a bowl of cereal at Lisa's head... - ... my private line will ring and a voice on the other end will say: "It's done". - That's how I'll know you're dead. - Are you...? I threw the cup on the floor. I didn't throw it at her head.
What are "Bathmatics"? Admirers of Camp Bloodbath. It's like our fantastic nickname. Did you know that a nickname immediately becomes lame - when you give it to yourself?
I'd say the odds are very low. And you'd be right. But here you are... on top of a mine, completely fucked up. How did you know it was there? Because it's right where I left it.
How did you know it was there? Because it's right where I left it. Want some help? There it is. I suggest you use it.
-Drags the audience. I know she does, but do you like her? Play her offstage? -I don't understand you. -If you don't like her, why did you choose her?
-If you don't like it, why did you choose it? It wasn't me. It was Dallas. That's right. You didn't choose her and it doesn't come from within you.
Anyone for an Iscoburger? Enough politeness, Plankton! That's the last time I ask. Where's my formula? I told you, Krabs, I don't have it.
I'd love to, but the formula has disappeared. Mr. Krabs says you and Plankton took it. No, that's not what happened. It just disappeared. We're putting together a team to find it.
Not really. It's only a matter of time before the South Africans see the light. And as they say, Rome wasn't built in a day. A day and a half, maybe. Look, Max, I know that vigilance is a fact of life. What worries me is how the information is used and who uses it.
That's certainly an example. Or when you're laughing your ass off watching episodes of Friends and they throw in a cheesy romance between Ross and Rachel, then remix the song to make it sound sad, slow and sappy? Exactly what I was thinking. You're unstoppable. Or like when they take an honorable profession, like stripping, and mix it with gangsters and dishonest businessmen.
Thank you. - Where is it? - I left it at home. - Liar. Someone fucked her and I didn't have the heart to tell them.
What the hell, man? Ben, you're smoking your dad's weed. What are you talking about? It's crap and it's expensive. He said he got it in Texas.
All we have in hand is an image problem, Lito. What matters most is that everyone understands that this unfortunate photograph is a violation of your privacy. No one can even prove that it's real. The photo was obviously manipulated. The asshole who posted it online will regret it.
I remember this. I'm trying to sort it out, okay? How are you sorting it out in the creepy attic? It's stupid. There's one last scholarship where I have to submit a proposal for an experiment and I thought that maybe if I got it, Mom wouldn't have to sell the house.
Yes, you're welcome. What are you going to do with it? We're going to test it. Let's go... But I thought you'd already tested it.
You really scared me. I'm not in a bad mood. Why are you up here? It's stupid. There's one last scholarship where I have to submit a proposal for an experiment and I thought that maybe if I got it, Mom wouldn't have to sell the house.
Are you the poet? Yes. I used to admire your poetry. Oh, thank you. I shouldn't admire it any more.
Take the camera downstairs. Yes, that's right. It's made of plastic, so it's light but very sturdy. Go for the hands. It's extremely absorbent... with 300 continuous cotton loops... which I made myself when I designed it.
Right, Dad? Yes, we did that. Do you have any idea how much your idea will cost? How and where are you going to sell it? If you can manufacture it after it has cost everything we have... to sell this product that now, thanks to you... will cost more money?
Okay, let's go. Boys, let's go. He gave food to people who were starving. And hanging is the consequence a slave faces for stealing food. He didn't steal it.
This piece of junk? Thank you. Junk. I told you that you should have seen the west side in particular. Who had it?
Jess didn't feel safe. I bought her this backpack in the hope that she would use it. It's called the iSafe Backpack. You can pull an alarm. But she... She wouldn't wear it.
Sign your damn name! My father... Who killed him? Such a rude and condescending man... He loved you. You should have seen his poor face when I smashed it against the sink.
- Yes. - Oh, my God. You think everything is like "The Terminator". Because everything is like "The Terminator"! Arnold's hand is cut off in the past, someone finds it and reverse-engineers it.
Ladybug... Stick it on. What... I'm sorry, what is it exactly? Don't take it off for 24 hours.
Stick it there. What... I'm sorry, what is it exactly? Don't take it off for 24 hours. Why can't I take it off for 24 hours?
Human history is defined by wars. And war is defined by the men who fight it.
I felt that Jordan and Pippen were the soul of the band. And for me, you're Michael Jordan. I miss that voice. I miss it. I think you can get it back.
My name is Ira Levinson. I'm an ordinary man who fell in love with an extraordinary woman. In this room you will see remarkable and beautiful works of art. Ruth had an extraordinary eye for talent, while I only had eyes for her. For me, the great joy of collecting was not in the art itself, but also in the person with whom I collected it.
No? The guys on my rugby team who are afraid of grease? My girlfriend? The disgraced stripper? And where does she get it?
Because of Dylan, because that was dirty. But really, because of the t-shirts. You know you stole my idea. I didn't steal your idea. It was my idea and you were there when I had it.
There's something noble about him that makes me fear him. He's daring and that intrepid mind of his never stops - he has the wisdom to act bravely. What is it, my Lord? Why do you keep him for yourself? We cut the snake, we didn't kill it.
Now. Nobody gets out of the car, asshole. Drive off. Do you think this is the first time I've had a gun to my head? No. But it will be the first time someone uses it.
There was nothing in his beer. - So he's not going to die? Be a dear and bring me some rags and water. The bullet is still in there. If we don't get it out and the bleeding doesn't stop, she's going to die.
He had a small cup that we bought at Disney. Do you remember the cup? Do you remember it? You even had similar ones, but you didn't care, but he wasn't obsessed. That's all he could eat, and sometimes he'd even take it to bed.
And you? Three months. I'm craving everything salty, which makes me think I'm having a boy, but I don't know. The other night I took a chocolate bar and stuck it in the middle of a bowl of ice cream. I didn't break it or anything.
In June, we and the Cloud Foundation submitted a petition to the Wildlife and Aquatic Service to designate North American wild horses on public lands as a threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. The argument that we are managing them to extinction.... The data and the experts who carefully analyze it, who really are experts, say precisely the opposite. Their conclusions were published in a 2013 report. That report says that we have more horses than ever on pasture and that the population has done nothing but grow, even though we've tried to reduce it, due to our limited tools and money.
Letting you train me while you let yourself die. It's like any other fight. This fight? I've seen it. It's the worst imaginable... and most of the time, you don't win.
I remember him because of the tattoo under his right eye. The tear. See? - Fuck you. - Why did he do it?
Do you understand me? No, you understand me. No, I've spent six years hiding in the dark. It's time for me to return to the light. I'm sorry, sir, but I don't have it. Mr.
Call the doctor. I gave you the money you needed. He needed someone to save his daughter, I found her for you. Do you think you've done a good deed? Hope... you don't find it every day.
- There's no ice. I took the liberty of creating a pamphlet. The subject: Congress ignores this insignificant thing called the First Amendment. They don't ignore it, they simply don't give a damn.
That's why I'd like to tell him that we're doing as much for this country as he is. It's complicated. Trumbo and the others all have contracts. LB, you helped build this industry, just like I did. We won't stand by while these vermin defile it.
Yeah. Well, that Buddy Ross has always been an asshole. - Yeah. And he's in trouble too. - Three movies, three flops. - Is that right? Look at him. He's trying to sell his soul, but he can't find it.
- It's a new kind of war. Well, if it doesn't exist, it's very new. What about the Rosenbergs? - What about them? - They stole the atomic bomb. They didn't steal it in a film van.
They want to be able to run to the paternalistic state as soon as they are in trouble, and be bailed out by the taxpayer. It's called "Too Big to Fail". There are Nobel laureates in economics who disagree with the path we're on. People like Joe Stiglitz, Paul Krugman and others, and none of them have been contacted. The people chosen to fix the crisis are those who created it, Robert Rubin's group from Goldman Sachs.
- Hello, darling. - Mom, what are you doing up? - I couldn't sleep. - Hasn't the medication taken effect? - I haven't taken it yet.
You don't know anything about my mother. You haven't bothered to look after her. Even now, you haven't brought her flowers for 10 years. And that letter... Do you think Mom never read it?
And in Hollywood... When I walked through the front door, I was all alone, for fuck's sake! Marilyn, Rita, Grace, they all shit themselves when they saw me coming. It's all in my autobiography, don't tell me you haven't read it. Unfortunately, I have. Except you didn't write it.
A young C2 field officer who can provide passports in a foreign city. - What are you doing, Harry? - Analyzing talent. Remind me, what was the conclusion about Vass? - A notification from the bank. - And which one of you found it?
I met George. He's annoying, but thoughtful. Thank God he cut off that beard. He looked like a troll. Did you tell him to cut it?
Don't tell me. Rather than risk the entire crew of a ship, I'm here to observe and advise. But we've contained him, haven't we? I mean, we just need to stay here until the storm passes, and... you can communicate with your ship to come and get the experiment back, okay? They don't want it back, do they, Svet?
Stephon? Stephon, are you with us? Can you hear me? Stephon! I'm not going to say that word. I shouldn't say it.
Does he like it? He's addicted to paan. He makes his own mix. Where's your box of paan? I didn't see it in the apartment.
Okay, you won at the last. Because that's how crazy I am! Now, give me back my daughter! Give me my painting! Get it before he ruins it.
You won't live without it forever. Have you been on vacation? No. Your mailbox has been full all week. I haven't emptied it yet.
No, rebel, I've never heard of it. Did you manage to escape? Major Marquis didn't just escape. Major Marquis had a brilliant idea. So brilliant that you can't understand why nobody had it before.
I'll protect you. No rest for the bastards, is there, John Ruth? Not anymore, Joe Gage. - Now hand over the gun. - If you want it, you'll have to give it to me...
We had to be very careful at the beginning not to mix up "I love you more than anything in the world" with "Look out, we're in danger." When we raise our left arm, it means "I want to dance in your arms." "When we close our hand and put it behind our back, it means,"
Did your father die here? In this house? Well, I had heard that he didn't come here anymore. Elizabeth always complained to a mutual friend at the club that he never wanted to come here. Why didn't he sell it?
Claire. - Well, your letter. - What letter? The one you sent me. I didn't send it.
You said that he... that he was "very right". - What did you mean by that? - You've entered that last Earth, right? The one with the internet, nice phones and lattés? It's exactly where you left it.
- Yes, see for yourself. This was made on her last day. She's an artist. It's part of her shadowy character. Yes, that's what I thought. There's no pattern to this particular image, which means she created it herself.
I prefer the new Hugo to the cocky one. And I prefer Carla who doesn't finish her marathons to the perfect girl. Sorry, I don't give a shit. Fucking fermented cabbage. You only miss the Mediterranean diet when you no longer have it.
Drop the gun! Cruz? We've already found him. You know what to do if he has it. Otherwise...
More than 30 years after the original debates, he was still furious with Vidal, and was still shaken by how he had reacted. Would I like to go back to my 20s? Not at all. No, I... If I had a tablet that could take me back 25 years, I wouldn't take it.
I don't mind if the boiler has to be turned off, I just don't want a danger like that in my bloody basement. He nearly killed the electrician this afternoon. It's an old boiler... I don't want excuses. I want it fixed.
If Dave Schwimmer goes, everyone goes! Listen, as Chairman of the Alumni Committee... There is no president, Dan. Why am I the only one with the administrator password for the Facebook page? Because you created it and won't give it to anyone?
At any time. But I didn't. Why didn't I? All right, boys. So, did that shirt have buttons when I bought it?
You're excused. What the hell does that mean? That he means yes? You want legitimacy in the eyes of London. But you'll only get it when you can transport more than stolen goods.
No amount of gratitude will make him forget that. A long time ago, he and I were friends. Good friends. We fought alongside each other for precisely this goal: a stable and prosperous Nassau. We're talking about a man who took a complicated colony and turned it into a commercial success.
So how did this happen? It's not getting any better. Uh... I think it's getting much, much worse. That thing over there, it's got something in its blood, and it's infected me. I swear to God, if you let it scratch you, it'll infect you
I mean, Kate, I saw you talking to Ethan, so... What would you like? Hello, Bill. I've got a delivery for your new colleague. - Would you like me to put it on the table?
What if they don't succeed? - What if you don't find anything? - All actions have ramifications, which means that all actions lead to proof. And we're going to find that proof, for the very reason that it exists. And we won't stop looking until we find it.
Believe me, I'm the man of the hour. That'll be 30 dollars, fellas. - My wallet, man. - Dude, you just had it. I know I had it, it's gone.
I'd say about half an hour, maybe 40 minutes. Enough time for someone to have called the police and for the police to have arrived and probably to save your sister's life. Free number People search - Karl Ross It turns out that I'm not the first to look for these witnesses. We traced Karl Ross to this pet store but discovered that he had sold it.
Move this ship. Let it get out of this without being humiliated. Then the three of us will sit down at a table and sort this out. Eleanor, I don't care if he leaves voluntarily. If I give up this position, I'll never get it back.
Or would you rather share a room with dying old people, or stay in your house with a nurse? She's got a lot of spirit, Georgie. All right, let's hope this is more comfortable for you. Why does he live in such a big house? Well, I think he built it in the hope of charming my mother and getting me to move back in with him.
Well, I thought about every little detail. I drew up the plan and chose all the materials. Board by board, nail by nail, every nail. And sometimes I'd knock down an entire wall because I didn't like it or... because I was going too slowly. See, I know what I went through when I finished it.
-Are you all right? -Are you? I'm going to file an appeal. Everything will be fine. It's funny how realizing that your life could fall apart gives you a new perspective. Although I'd known that inscription by heart since I was a little girl, it felt like I was seeing it for the first time.
I'm going to file an appeal. Everything will be fine. It's funny how realizing that your life could fall apart gives you a new perspective. Although I've known that inscription by heart since I was a little girl, it felt like I was seeing it for the first time. It made me wonder what my father was thinking when he wrote it.
Can you hold this? Liquid oxygen. Add stain remover containing ammonium. This thing here... It's five times stronger than a stick of dynamite. How can we activate it?
We'll spend the night on it. OK, thank you. Sir, the post office confirmed that the package was delivered this morning. They say there's no way of knowing who sent it.
Where were you last night? Vogel got me to spend some time in the east. God... It's not much worse than the place they got me here in the western sector. The Russians are okay with the exchange, but now Vogel says the East Germans won't do it.
Please don't make that mistake. Sara, I abandoned your father because he chose the wrong path in life. You're going to ruin your life, darling. I never had a life. That's why I never feared losing it.
A few months ago, my life meant nothing to me. I had no joy, no pleasure. It would have been nice if that little game of Russian Roulette had put an end to it. But since I planned and executed the elimination of Judge Spangler, my life has taken a new turn. I understood why people loved life and saw it as something pleasurable to experience.
I can't even believe she wanted to do it. Maybe she didn't think she had a choice. I'm just saying, if there are still things out there, what should she do? She can't just ignore them. Vincent, I know how much you want a normal life, and God knows no one deserves it more than you, but let's look at things as they are.
- Do you think so? Look. Catherine. You're right. As much as I want a normal life, I can't have it.
It's his case from now on. But I'm so close, sir. The killer was one of Tatiana's clients. The client's wedding ring was stolen, and he killed her trying to get it back. Only she didn't have it.
And those who make promises must also keep them. Do you understand? Make me understand. I only take orders from Dr. Walker. What a waste to spend so much aggression on someone who doesn't feel it.
- Of course. When do I become immortal? When your body begins to react to the baby's immortal blood, it should be able to absorb the genetic material that has kept you in stasis for 15 months. You already have the sap. We can get off this island. We need to distill it and have a concentrate for Kyle and anyone else who gets sick.
you're not my family. - Are you being honest? - Of course. Whoever discovers the cure can name it. Wasn't it Alan who discovered it?
Morphine. I don't want it. The pain is mine. It's for Aleister. I won't let you take it away.
I don't find your attitude funny. Save it for Nick. I'm saying we can get there in 20 minutes. I saw electric lines indicating an access road. I can't find it on the map.
I know it sounds strange, but this component of the ritual will have to be done alone. Whatever it takes, I'm here to help. Why are you building this out here? Jeremy wanted it in the back field, closer to the house. If they wanted solitude, I thought this is where they'd find it.
The secret ritual rooms are below us. There's only one way in. Does she think she can kill me? She's failed at that at least once before. Only a Clan witch can open it.
This is a new era, Mr. Vedder. The parts only need to be transported here, by ship or train, to be assembled. Are you listening to me? I've made you a high offer. Don't turn it down.
- Thank you very much. Thank you very much. - I like your sweater too. It's nice. - Thank you very much. Actually, I made it myself.
Max. Hello. You've lost this. That... isn't mine. Before you go down that lost path of self-incrimination, I have to tell you that it was Pettigrew who carried out the analysis that was in this folder. Now the analysis has disappeared and Pettigrew is dead and I think you know who took it.
Do you think Jason might have stolen it? He might have. We won't know until Eric locates the thing. Well, if it wasn't Jason, then it was someone cruel enough to bash a man over the skull just to steal a... stupid piece of machinery. He can't even leave the island. Eric intends to make an arrest and bring the drill back to town, regardless of who took it.
Are you the little man who's going to translate the mythical language? Not as mythical as you think, young man. Verbis Diablo, the Devil's language, has roots as old as Aramaic, and probably older. It was mainly an oral tradition, like most languages that are now dead. We haven't lost it completely, we've just forgotten it.
They were good together. They were both stupid. One last question, Mrs. Grey. The bowl in the kitchen, I've never seen it before.
The pressure. Everyone pressuring him. The publicity. It drove him crazy. Why didn't he destroy it?
It's his last message to the world. It's a man's suicide note. Okay, I was with him. I knew about the recording but I didn't take it. So if you didn't take it, Mr. Wainwright, who did?
It was the fishburgers. - The what? - The fishburgers. They're made from beached whales. When a whale runs aground, they don't discard it, they sell it.
The mask on his body. Had I ever seen anything like that before? - No, I haven't. - Mr. Latimer? I didn't see it, obviously, but no.
We have meat, pasta and peas. It's a religious issue. Which means that Uncle Sam says you have to provide it when it's asked for. That's really true. Well, we don't have it.
I don't want to stand there staring at that hairy asshole and trying to push those sticky buttocks away. Do you think he was distressed by this like a little girl? No. He planned his rape and he succeeded. He didn't plan it.
No, we need to have some fun. - Which police station fined you? - Excuse me? There's documentation from the police station that pulled you over. Don't you have it?
You saw Leonard's volcano. What happened to Tim, all the others, all these strange illnesses and accidents. This is going to sound strange, but you have an app on your phone... - I knew it. My mom gave it to me, but I didn't use it.
What happened to Tim, all the others, all these strange illnesses and accidents. This is going to sound strange, but you have an app on your phone... - I knew about it. My mom gave it to me, but I didn't use it. - Your mom made it?
He took it from a website for "proactive parents". That's what they call themselves... They get together and talk about what great parents they are. I opened it once, but it felt wrong, like my hands were greasy. Everyone was using it, and the more they used it, the more focused they were, and the more focused they were, the more their wishes came true.
So it's official. One day, there will be a government here. So I want Maggie to work with me. There will be a police force. So I want you to start it.
Glenn, Rick. Let's get started. It's already dark. Let's talk about what happened. Not about the fight or what caused it.
No problem, Carlos. Let's talk about the charges against you. I've seen your file and the prosecution isn't going to make it easy for you. They're going to charge you with robbery, theft and the knife makes it aggravated assault. I had the knife with me, but I didn't use it.
This is the last one... I have no idea what it is, but it's the last one. No. All of Mom's food is going to spoil. Why don't we take it home and put it in the freezer?
Why not? She couldn't stand it. What do you want me to do when I'm inside his memories? We think yesterday's bomb was an accident. Brandt blew up his apartment while he was preparing it.
- Where can we find it? Santa Monica University, in the science building. Who are you guys? Julie's friends. So Castellano sends Julie's research to Pica, who sells it to Applied Holographics for a small fortune.
- Hello, there. - Hi. I'm trying my hand at gardening. This worked for my flower beds, but do you have anything heavier that I could borrow? The handle on mine broke and I haven't replaced it yet.
You can try to kill me if you want. But you'll die here with me. Buried like an Egyptian slave with her pharaoh. And if you try, and don't succeed, that would be much worse. Isn't that right, Robin? Why do you have my suitcase? You made it when you left Evan.
For one rule! Break a single rule in life and I end up on my way to the moon! Yes! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a mission to accomplish. Commander Goldwing, get that flag back before Carson destroys it.
Well, I don't think Ferg Donnelly is appropriate. Ferg is very important here. Frankly, you're lucky he's taken an interest in your business. I understand, but it's not necessary. I don't want to brag, but I've always managed this account on my own since I won it.
But we didn't calculate the impact it would have on the village. The chemicals they use in the vineyards, the extra traffic, the trees they've cut down and the fences they've put up. I mean, look what they've done to the village pond. And what did they do? They diverted the stream that fills it without talking to anyone.
She already framed me once. The knife was planted. You don't know that. I want to hand it over. If Alison stole the knife and used it, she could be locked up for life.
Ambulance on the march to Sunset and Highland. Sunset 7999, that's... That's the Café Hut. That's Art Gladner. Sal, you were here when the call came in, who took it?
- The past is never dead. But we are finished with each other. From now on, we'll be strangers. You're a stranger to yourself. The truth looks you in the eye and you can't even see it.
We flooded the core. Why doesn't the water level rise? It seems that the water never got there. How is that possible? The only way is if someone stopped it manually... from the inside.
Without the vaccine. I have a way. - These are the survivors. - They can no longer catch the disease. They're immune, so they can help us with those who still have it.
They're immune, so they can help us with those who still have it. Tell them to wrap these bandages around their skin. It will help heal their wounds. For those who haven't caught the disease, this will keep them safe. They will catch a mild type of the disease, recover well and never catch it again.
How are you, Dr. Warner? I'd like you to meet my wife Eleanor and her sister, Mrs. Walcott. Ladies, excuse us for a moment while we discuss the details. I'd like you to see our living room. I think your wife will find it very soothing.
What's wrong? I'm fine, take care of your food. My God, Harriet. I don't need your compassion. Then I won't give it to you, but for God's sake, it's okay to be me of all people, seeing that you're suffering.
We went there. - We found a pile of drugs. - A lot. There's no way Danny had that much dope. Unless he stole it from Wayne Lowry.
With what? Why didn't you get rid of it? I thought it could be useful. I just didn't realize I'd be using it for this. After he left your property... It looks like he kept it for himself.
And this thing doesn't hurt us. It's scary, sure. But being scary won't kill you, right? He smashed through a wall trying to get Holly. Yeah, but it didn't hurt her. Did he, Holly?
please... just prove that my Talia is alive and well and we'll give you what you ask for. And I hope for my daughter's safe return. Thank you. Thank you. The FBI is demanding proof of life. They won't have it.
A good man. Sir, I only raised my hand to scratch my nose. I clearly saw you raise your hand. Sir, if it was to fight, it would have been like this. But I only raised it this far to... You see? To scratch my nose.
Goliath wants his best sword. The best sword? The sword of Akahah? That's the one. He never uses it, except for his fiercest enemies.
and Rockefeller had it destroyed. Years later, Diego painted it again in Mexico, where he thought painting could be free. - But... - Unfortunately, the current painting has been reduced to nothing more than a prostitute at the foot of the Bank of Mexico and the Palace. It is controlled by the censors, who treat it exactly as Rockefeller did.
Lieutenant? This photo points to a big fight. All fights have two sides. We know that Gu lost this fight. But we don't know that he didn't start it.
But in the meantime, he can still get out. There is nothing absolutely automatic about the bail allocation hearing. He can still get out. Yes or no? Even if he's granted bail, I don't believe they'll set it at a level that's...
So for the future of both our peoples, I need to know how you got your hands on restricted stealth technology capable of destroying the system's balances. That is, the balance between Earth and Mars. In any case, it's a bad deal for the Belters. The OPA seeks legitimacy through violence. They haven't achieved it in any other way.
I told DeGraaf that Mars was giving the EPA stealth technology. He did what I thought he would. The increase in chatter was panic. They were calling to see if anything was missing. And since they had to ask, that means they didn't give it to anyone.
Help me! Let go of me. Don't make me shoot you. You won't. His gun is attached to his armor, he couldn't fire it.
I wanted to surprise you. And you wanted to surprise me. I let you get to know me. To see me. I gave you a rare gift, but you didn't want it.
I've always liked the word "defenestration". Now I can use it in casual conversation. How many bones did you break? You say that as if I had broken them. It was the doctor who went to the window. If she didn't go through it.
Two of them ... at the dam and the mine, are already moving into position. The third... inside the mountain... is freeing Grounder prisoners as we speak. Our job as the fourth team is to keep the enemy's eyes off them for as long as possible. To do this, we have to be in position here at the main gate, with our entire army. The mountain men think that the door can't be opened from the outside, so they leave it unguarded.
Thank you very much. That's right. He's stealing wheelbarrows. What's that? The idea is that sometimes the answer is so obvious that we don't even see it, because we look too hard.
All I'm planning is a simple conversation with a long-lost relative. You said yourself that we should listen to her. And you said yourself that it would be silly. Did I? Well, that sounds like something I'd say. In case Freya has any information that could protect my daughter, I'd rather she shared it according to my rules.
He explained to me that every name on that list has a reason for being there. A few years ago, I found a message from him explaining the list. How is that possible? You were on a desert island. I didn't say I found it on the island.
They were in my custody. I knew you'd be on the case. I knew you had a bad record with Rocha. I help the tribe, they withdraw the complaint from the civilian oversight committee. Making a lie more complicated doesn't make it seem more true.
Klassen said he was from Klamath Falls and his family gave up the farm. So what? So a while back the government did something really stupid involving birds or bison or.... In 2001. To protect an endangered fish, the federal government took over the Klamath Basin and cut off access to everyone who used it for irrigation.
Unlike Nelson, he didn't know it well. A car arrives at his location, it looked like a ZoGo. He trusted the app, he didn't question it. This technology can make life easier. It certainly hasn't made it safer.
Dad, where are you? In the kitchen. What happened? You know, I couldn't find where Grandma left the cake tin. We haven't used it since...
I've spent my whole life asking questions about the Universe, Captain Bennigan... about the possibility of there being a higher intelligence out there somewhere. Thanks to you, I finally have the chance to get those answers. A higher intelligence? From the little we've learned about this stone so far, one thing is clear... The being who created it...
What about your job? Are you still trying to transfer here? Work on different cases? I don't know how it works. There was a vacancy. If they haven't filled it yet, maybe.
And I'm sorry... again. I bought this for you. It's just like the one I had when I was your age. When I got my first bike. We couldn't get it out of the garage without one of these.
We have several weapons ready. We just want you out. Don't get hurt. The gun you have isn't registered. I didn't want it here when the police arrived, but you refused, so here we are.
Why do you think I would ever accept that? I'll sell my beloved house for you. I'll scratch your back and you'll... - whip mine. - Adrian, it's bad enough that our house is a murder house. You're not going to turn it into a sex dungeon.
We didn't save ourselves to tell a lie. We were saved to honor our brothers and sisters. Telling their story is our prayer for them. And so it continues... through our children... and their children's children so that this story never dies. I will write your story as you told it.
Do you work for Jackie in secret? - No. For Dunbar? - For Dunbar? I'm just looking after the President. Give him the information and tell him who gave it to you.
This is the gun used to kill Matt Skokie. When Carter returned to the car, did he have his gun? - Yes, of course. - "Yes, of course" or "yes"? That's the gun. But Carter didn't use it.
The prosecutor turning this into a hate crime was punitive, not real. - You want confrontation. - We want a fair assessment. - What do we want? - Justice! - When do we want it?
I know these people. They won't stop until they do. Someone got hurt, someone died... I didn't start those fires, okay? I just pointed out a major security flaw, and then I handed them the bad guy who used it.
Any luck finding out where he sent the message? Yes, it was a message from his computer to a registered number. Which is strange, because Nelson knows that we log everything on the FBI's computers. Why didn't he send the message from his cell phone? Because he didn't want to hide it.
All you have to do is look with a pure heart and you'll see the magic. But I can't see it. Not with your eyes, boy, with your heart, from your heart. Magic is everywhere. When you see it, all you have to do is reach out and grab some with your hand and swallow it.
This is your home now. Get used to it. Was she being forced? She may have gone willingly, but... she seemed frightened. The house Levesque took her to, what's it like?
I thought I was going mad again. That something was wrong. So it took me a while to understand Or maybe I was just afraid to think... that... You survived the destruction because... you caused it.
- No. You shouldn't have to ask to save one of our people. - You never do! - That's enough! You survived the destruction because you caused it.
- Where are we going? - You'll see. What's over there? Another transition room. We don't use it anymore.
You'll have to speak up. Don't despair, my friend. The food here is really very good. Small consolation, I know. You had a vision, and you couldn't make it come true.
Please stop! I... I'm sick. Right! Right, the bag! I'll tell you who stole it...
I heard that some houses were destroyed. I'm a teacher. I have my family with me. I just want there to be peace. It doesn't matter who gives it.
I had all the toys and trinkets I wanted... And daily lessons from my strict tutors, but... Almost nothing else. One day, when I was 8, this stone was thrown through my window. It broke the bowl next to my bed. I had no idea who threw it, but...
But if that means I'm finally getting rid of you, then so be it. Goodbye, Mercenary. Time has stopped still. The door to Olympus is not a door as we know it, it's a door at the speed of time.
I've been waiting for you. YEAR 2017 Where is the cure? Give us the cure! Why are you hiding it?
It looks like the technology inside Gideon. I took a measurement, and this thing is emitting tons of energy. Enough to suppress the whole of Central City. - Is that right? - Yeah. What do you think Wells was using it for?
I'm glad it's no big deal. How did you know I was making a synthetic? Agent Thomas told me. Reluctantly. After the courier who was supposed to give me the next dose told me that Thomas had intercepted it.
He seems to be a restless man. Your gaze is always alert. I think I'm just detached. I gather you don't fully appreciate your profession. Or that you don't enjoy it at all.
Eyes that see. Sad otter eyes. No. You can't undo that. - Do you know who created it? - Yes.
- What is a singularity? - A black hole. - Can we destroy Central City? - To begin with. If we create a singularity here and then can't control it, we could face a global catastrophe.
The records indicate one LM Consolidated. The broker's name is a fake. Who wanted to hide their identity? Of course, you're absolutely right. I'd be very happy to tell you why I sold it.
Motherfucker, son of a... Did we get him? Take him to the sofa! - Shit! Oh, shit! - Where did you get the gun? - Why didn't we use it?
She was beheaded. And then this happened. The gun, Freddie? I don't know where the gun is. You're the ones who had it.
Please. No. There's a girl with Lucrezia. No. There's a girl with Lucrezia. Sophia. You have to find the page and protect her from those who are looking for her.
It's called "Dead Man's Hand". Just pick one, okay? Memorize it and turn it over. And your letter is... It's not here. You don't see it, do you?
They pay people to keep quiet. If they don't, they suddenly disappear. I fear for my safety. But I will continue to investigate until the truth is revealed. If Smart Rain is the sin that breaks the Seal, why didn't it break when they tested it in this village?
- But why that day? Was it just bad luck? Here it is. It's noon sharp. The green light bulb is on today. I turned it on myself.
- Magnificent, isn't it? 19th century. - Can I see it up close? It's the most valuable object I have. I didn't want to sell it, but these days we do what we have to in order to survive.
Yes? I'm sorry to disturb you, Milady, but the Dowager Countess has sent you a message. Apparently, it's urgent. I doubt it. I don't have it, Milady.
Dad, please. Say something. Why did you put the flashlight back in my van? The detective was looking for it, and she wouldn't leave you alone. I knew that if I gave it back, she'd stop.
I'm going to have to send the team into full swing to reprogram "Evernow". We've modified Otomo's original codes to create a new guard as an extra precaution. But she won't be able to free the prisoner if she can't find the prison. Clear the area. We've created a camouflage system so she'll never find it.
Whatever it is, we won't do it. It's been six years. Why have you come back now? Because this mission needs to succeed. It's the only thing that matters to Moscow. And you are the only people who can make it happen.
Belson, this contract contains language that the California Supreme Court has ruled unlawful. Preventing Mr. Dunn from seeking employment elsewhere is a violation of his rights. Are you aware of that? I wasn't, but I'm willing to withdraw that complaint if it makes things easier. The point is this: This clause was unlawful when you included it in Mr. Hendricks' employment contract. Yes.
- IS IT? I didn't say it was a perfect plan. Even if he's alive and doesn't slit our throats, what exactly is our argument? The Ottomans stole his armor. You get the secret of the armor, and the Crusade gets the man who made it.
I have to win I have to take risks And not be a prisoner of doubt I'm going You wanted adventure and there you have it.
We really need this. It will give the Powerful Ones a reason to stay in line. It's a bomb, Christian. And it doesn't discriminate. It's only as good as the people who are dropping it.
It's a watch made by the Meyer Towers company before the war. Popular in Europe, not imported to Australia. - Someone brought it here. - What about the engraving? The goldsmiths agreed that it's recent, but none of them made it.
- Do you hate me because I want to be accepted? - They'll never accept you! They'll accept your money, Dre, but they'll never accept your color, no matter how many white girls you marry. They'll never accept you! This is a family business and I swear to God I'm going to leave it to someone who cares about my family and not to someone who wants to break it up.
Jess asked me to clean Tom's room. She can't do it. Do you still have Jess's house key? She'd like it back. I don't know where Nat has it, but I'll look.
You put sauce, not gravy. Sauce, not gravy. If you spoil the soup, you can't send it back. ... she can't send it back." And when that joke came out, lots of people loved it.
What made him undeserving of being saved? undeserving, inadequate. We have to look at Betty Wright's surveillance video again. This is where the killing spree began. The question is, what triggered it?
It was taken in Rock Creek Park. Only not this morning. Four months ago. Zoey didn't take this photo with her cell phone, she took it with her digital camera. But more importantly, the photo never existed on Zoey's cell phone. If she didn't have it on her phone, - how did she send it?
- How is that possible? To begin with, wine is too valuable to open. And when you open it with nothing to compare it to, few people can tell the difference between a decent wine and the most exclusive wines on the planet. So who was the second box for? Towne didn't want it.
Who are you? Okay, so... Anna steals the weights, kills her friends and disappears off the map, or... she got in the way of someone who killed them. The truth is out there, Pride. We just haven't discovered it yet.
Yes, he loves us! He just wants to love us. Now, I ask you to remember John 10:10. "I have come that they may have life "And that they may have it more abundantly, more abundantly. "
Damascus steel, made in ancient Persia. But... the secret of its manufacture has been lost for centuries. It's supposed to have magical properties. Da Vinci believes in magic? Well, it's magic for those who don't understand it.
How strange. This role... is different from the other one. Because it's the story of Pinocchio. Why would this story be different from the others? Because August added it to the book.
This is the visit. You have a beautiful house. Thank you very much. A house is like a marriage, really. You have to make a long-term commitment if you want to see it take shape.
Emma. Put the gun down. Put the gun down. We need to talk about the gun. - I should have told you I brought it.
Put the gun down. We need to talk about the gun. - I should have told you I brought it. - Yeah. Let's say you found it.
He has another bill to pay. Azmorigan? Have you forgotten that I was the one who introduced you to Vizago? I knew where you were going. But your ship... you didn't leave it nearby.
I'm Level 6. I'm looking for Alvis Akari. Resistance and disobedience are punishable offenses under Company directive, but you don't seem to understand the message. Maybe the problem isn't the message. But the method in which you deliver it.
But killing her wasn't part of my job. Okay, Ronny, just to be completely clear, do you remember seeing Ana out here with the bag? Yes, that's right. As the driver walked her to the white limousine. Okay, so it's possible that she gave it to someone, hidden in a bag, "Public Enemy" style.
It's handcuffed to the secret service. It has the locations of our secret silos around the world and a detonator that the president can use to activate a remote launch. The doctors removed the case from Bruce's wrist to operate on him. Where did they put it? All the medical staff said they put it on the floor, next to the gurney, while they did the triage.
Our theory was that the shooter served as an excuse to catch Football. Years passed without incident. We assume they lost it, accidentally lost in the confusion. - Until this invasion. - Whoever has it waited 16 years for their resources to advance until they could hack into the system and trick it with the wrong launch codes.
In the firefighters' massacre, he was accused of lying. Why was that? Ask the psychopaths who committed the murders. Your colleague, Jeffrey Clarke, stated in a taped confession... Objection. He was coerced into that confession. That doesn't make it false.
For the cure. Are they going to offer us a deal? No, no. They thought the cure was in Solace. When we didn't find it, the Commander's brother made sure the cure was just a rumor.
I'd rather be abroad. Don't do that. I'll take the salmon skin. Put it in this bag. What do you want it for?
Someone called Scotty Lockhart called us. Excuse me, I'm Abigail. These are my colleagues. We're from Marla Bay Real Estate. Someone called Scotty Lockhart said he owned this house and asked us to tell him how much we thought we could sell it for.
Who? I haven't even shared that information with Noah yet. - Gee, why not? - Because it's just a theory, Helen. I have nothing to back it up.
Come on, I'll give you a ride back to town. Remember the time you tried to kill me? - You what? - You put a gun to my head. - I think I pointed it at your father.
I sent him to sleep on the roof. He drank too much from the special bottle. - Come here. - What's wrong? Don't worry, I've hidden yours in a place where he won't find it.
Did you agree to do it? Yes. But I didn't. I didn't do it. Venter gave me the bomb, but I never set it.
- I screwed up... - What? A big one. I found another page that the airport faxed me. It was on my desk, which means I didn't give it to you.
We used to walk together. I owed him one. The modification can wait. Actually, I'm looking for something for Salim. I don't know what he wants it for.
He's making a quilt out of their fur. Do you want a deep conversation...? Caleb, look at me. Life sucks. It's like that for everyone. There's only one thing that makes it better.
- I... I felt so alone... - Alone? I felt that way too. I'm... so ashamed. You wanted the truth, so now you have it.
Yes, of course. Yes, I'm fine. But don't try too hard. All that surveillance and we didn't know about the secondary platform? The plans we had didn't include it.
There is no certainty. But they are powerful witches looking for more power. And who is more powerful than the Black One? His dagger is still in the city, right? Why do you think they want it?
I freed all these people. Is there much time left? It would be much quicker if she could calm down. Does she need company? I think you'd only make her more tense.
And you haven't found any letters or heard any statements... It's cold here... In the north of France, isn't it? A bitter winter. You brought a heated silver tray to put on your bed, Monogrammed, your servants tell me. But they were surprised to find it not on your bed, but on Randall's.
Hi. There you are. Beth. I was thinking about the day Paul moved out. - Do you remember that story? - I don't think I do.
- I knew I would beat her. How? Because Castor and Leda have the same disease. Because Castor and Leda have the same disease. It attacks boys' brains and women's epithelial tissue, but as your fertility proves, Sarah, you've managed to fight it off. - It's infecting innocent women. - To understand it. I didn't infect the boys, I just discovered it.
Did you manage to speak to Ms. Jenny? No, I'm without reception. I don't want to add to our problem, but I recognize the statue that Carmilla stole. The Bajrayogini Statue of Kali. Yes, I've seen it too, in the Hindu book of lore.
Me? Well, I haven't seen that cursed blade since you sent Crocodile away. But you took it last night to hide it somewhere no one could find it. After all the lives I've spent looking for a way to destroy the Dark Lord, I'm pretty sure I'd remember having that dagger in my hand. Okay, well, if I didn't give it to you, then who... did you give it to Gold...?
But that means you'll be stuck as a server forever. Not necessarily. You stole that bracelet from your father's safe. I bet that's where he keeps the squid ink. You want me to steal it for you.
Does that mean you'll forever be Pan's servant? Not necessarily. You stole that bracelet from your father's safe. I bet that's where he keeps the squid ink. You want me to steal it for you.
Because you were wrong, Hook. Villains don't get happy endings. I should never have believed you when you said we could do this without the Author. I gave you the voice. It's not my fault if your magic can't get it out of its bloody shell.
Ursula! Give me the shell. And give him the satisfaction of returning it to you? Now go. Before you destroy it, along with everything you love.
How are you still alive? I'm good at surviving. Or you're bad at killing. In either case, you don't need the Author to get what you want. I know why you couldn't free your voice from that shell. Only what enchanted it can do that.
Are you really looking for a good story? Yes. Who are you? I'm a girl with a fantastic story. Okay, I'm all ears. Sorry, but if you want to hear it, you'll have to get me out of here first.
It's fantastic. How did you do it? I have my own methods. And this key? My mother never lets it out of her sight.
- Because they are Neal Cassidy's personal possessions. A boy who lived on this earth alone. And all because his father... was too much of a coward... to hold on to what he had. I don't want a reminder of my failure. A reminder... that all I wanted was happiness. And when I had it... I couldn't recognize it.
You're Egyptian as long as you're loyal to Pharaoh. My loyalty is to my family and to my people here. Pharaoh, who sits on his throne on the other side of the desert, is as important to me as I am to him. Pharaoh can have your tongue cut out for that. From what I've heard from our Pharaoh, he wouldn't even know what to do with my tongue if he had it.
LITTLE LIES - S05E17 "The Bin of Sin" Thinking about Mona in that barrel gives me nightmares. I know, I couldn't fall asleep. And when I did, I dreamt of Holbrook painting Ezra's apartment with the letter I sent to Jackie. I have to tell her that I wrote it.
The cameras. I'm not surprised you got in. I don't blame you for being furious. It was a stupid thing I did, and I realized it as soon as I did it. I tried to get the letter back, but she'd already read it.
The witness is quoting the victim, Your Honor. - It's all in the letter. - Objection overruled. Why did you only decide to share this letter with us now, Lesli? I couldn't find it.
Check it out! Porn magazines! Give me the beer. Fuck, why didn't you give it to me? I did, man. Why didn't you get it?
You want something from me, so give me something in return. Before he left, he gave me a USB stick. I used it to put the employee records on the server. I should have destroyed it, but I didn't. I can tell you where I hid it.
He has corrupted this city at every level, bankrupted it by building his secure penthouse on the top floor. He keeps the building filled with security guards. He even has his own SWAT team. He rarely leaves the penthouse. If there's a way to get up there, I haven't found it yet.
Ah... Offer from the house. Oh, please. You know... this cherry tree, do you know who planted it?
Okay. But you have to promise not to judge. But you have to promise not to judge. Of course I won't. The night Kimber disappeared, she left me a voice message. And I didn't show it to anyone because it made her look bad.
Humans do this when they're going through something sad. We do things to try to stop the pain. Well, if pain is like that for humans... I don't want to feel it ever again. Ethan, what if... What if I could make it stop?
I'm glad it's no big deal. How did you know I was making a synthetic? Agent Thomas told me. Reluctantly. After the courier who was supposed to give me the next dose told me that Thomas had intercepted it.
- Have the latest files helped? Oh, my God. It's Betrayed in Chattanooga. I should have recognized her voice. Who recorded it?
No, you don't tell me anything! What's wrong with you? All I know is that if I see one more microphone, I don't know what I'll be able to say! But the ice sculpture is ready. - Don't you want it?
You'll be safe until I've finished. - You think you can stop him alone? - Who says I'm alone? - Is the security network active? - If it isn't, they turned it off without warning.
Get up. We're running late. I think I'll stay. Kirk, can't this wait until tomorrow? What's the point of life if we don't live it?
So, I'm sorry to waste your time, officers, but we've closed the case. The killer was a special forces policeman... Rick Willis. How are you so sure it was him? His fingerprints were all over the warehouse on the base where he killed her.
Come here, come here. - What's going on? - It must be around here somewhere. Are you sure you had a tape in the camcorder? Or is it possible that you put it somewhere else?
After the bunnies and unicorns, the conversation turned to what else. He wanted a gun. Why would an NCIS agent come to you to get a gun? I didn't ask that question. He said he wanted it light and untraceable.
Damn it! She blocked our signal. Let me guess. Carol again? Yes, he put the meth there for me to find and lead me into a trap.
Well, just that you're off Liam's radar, which is the best news I've heard for a while. Welcome home. What's the problem? Nothing, I'm just... frustrated that I can't find the gemstone, that's all. I could have sworn I'd hidden it in the dungeon, but... I checked calendars and passwords hoping to find something, but... - I can't believe I can't remember!
I can't stay here, I'm in the middle of a show with Hallie DuVernay. Hallie DuVernay! You know that picture of me? De Villemarie. You know you've seen it.
Have you ever seen this stone before? I can't say that I have. What is it? That's not important. Can you contact my wife and tell her I have it?
Go away. You'll be rewarded." The package was the gun. That's what Spencer was doing on Ramsey's property. VIPER75 bought the gun on the Deep Web, sent it to Spencer with instructions on where to leave it.
We've been singing that song as if it belonged only to us, when every city in the country has its lips on it! Even Des Moines. Wait a minute. This song was supposedly written by... former President Moleman! I didn't write it.
All the way to Des Moines. Wait a minute. This song was supposedly written by... former President Moleman! I didn't write it. I bought it from a salesman who was selling it to half the cities in the country.
Yes, the teacher told us about it. But I didn't really understand. She explains it badly. She said to show what's real, but not real. Then she said that if reality is dark or unpleasant, we can't show it.
The killer found him and shot him in the head while Troy was inside looking out. And the striations on the bones? Made when the killer pulled the wires to remove the bullets. It's new ammunition. We should be able to find out who bought it.
I'll be going home very soon, monkey. Very soon. Did you hear that? Do you think this is a game? I don't think this is a game. We gave you a chance and you didn't take it.
I hear Lil Wayne's contract is up. Who gives you news from the streets, Mimi? Don't wear out your wig thinking about it, Cookie. What I'd really like to know is why they want to depose Lucious. He's deranged and I need to get my company back before he destroys it or my family.
It's up to you. She's not here yet? I'm sorry, ma'am, if you can tell me what the problem is... I gave my friend Lois a medical alert bracelet a few years ago when John died. But do you think she wears it? No.
I just thought that after everything we've been through... Your father, my brother, everything... I thought I'd be someone you could open up to. I just did. Where's the cat? Did you leave the window open? I swear I didn't leave it open on purpose.
Theo Galavan will be the President of Gotham. The crowd gathers outside and can't contain itself with excitement, and in a moment, we'll also be talking to many of the supporters who have given of their time and made the effort to support... What do you have against the front door? Nothing. It's the monkey that opens it that I can live without.
- I'll dig it out of here! It can't have gone very far, unless it can fly. - Can tarantulas fly? - Jake, you better find that spider, and I'm not coming back until you do. Sergeant? I think I've found it.
- Is that right? ! The motorcycle story was false. They tried to distract me. They did something to the crown. I know, but I always kept my hand in the drawer, so I'm confident they don't have it
Excuse me for a moment. Yes, I need to be excused too. - He doesn't have the crown! - Why did you bring that up? - I don't know who has it.
You did it. And it was too much. Just one thing, where's the crown? Shaw's Bar, the official place of my coronation. All hail the crown of destiny. And welcome the wearer, Amy Santiago, the...
Another great story. Isn't it? There's no electricity, no heating. - Is there running water? - Of course there's running water. But I wouldn't use it.
- They need to come to the bridge. Just when it was getting interesting... It doesn't end here. I take it you don't have that knife with you? Six has it.
And then my fear of ISIS is replaced and I become afraid of Candyman, who comes back from the dead when you say his name five times. Candyman, Candyman... Candyman, Candyman, Candyman... Or the old hitchhiker with hairy arms like hers, who disappears when they stop for gas. But there is a butcher's knife in her handbag, except they didn't see it the first time because when they searched it there was nothing there but knitting materials.
Number Six will be dead, I'll be invited again to the Radwell family's Thanksgiving in the Hamptons, and I'll be back to trying to achieve what a sorority is for... Getting a good husband with a huge family fortune. Wait, you just said you didn't care about that and that the only thing you cared about was the sorority. Yes. That was when I thought our friendship was for life and that I'd lost it forever.
Eric deserves to be remembered for what he was, a hero. Nothing should change that. My job is to find who killed him. Not to go on a witch hunt, and you need to trust me. When I got home today, there was a bag in the kitchen. I'd never seen it before.
What happened? He and a sailor started arguing in the lunch line, a fight broke out. As an officer, Kutzler had to set an example. A reprimand is protocol. So why did you erase it from his record?
Did we kill ourselves crossing the ocean so that some Africans could eat us for soup? No one needs to go. If Mr. Shackspear is suspicious of the offer, he might as well stay. But we need a thousand people. The abolitionists who gave me this commission to carry out this mission will not fund it unless we establish a sizable community of free blacks in Sierra Leone.
- Q authorization? - Let's see. What's your passphrase? "sweet-44-soft-9-good-succulent-chops"! I didn't choose it.
- You think he might be allergic to Stella. - What? ! The only reaction this dog gets is laughter. When she tried to lick her own snout... In my village, if a goat acted so stupidly, we wouldn't even eat it.
Why are you so serious? This is just a bit of fun. Let's get out of this mausoleum and find some real women. You're too demanding. My friend doesn't recognize ready-to-eat fruit when he sees it. Forgive us.
I come to bring vengeance. Executive order 13686, dismissal of all members of your Secret Service. Executive Order 13687. Your Navy buddies will now protect the White House, the first family, and even that creep, the vice president. Speaking of him, I thought you might like to read the vice president's letter of resignation and resignation from federal office before I take it to him to sign.
No. The manager of the yoga studio said that Taylor was at work - from 9:30 to 11:00. - So the manager is lying. Castle, she had a classroom of 30 people. She didn't make that call, but whoever did made sure she was near Taylor's building.
I heard it's still there, but it's half werewolf, half dog. What? Who is this guy? Who is this guy? Okay, guys. I know Eric's real story, but... You probably don't want to hear it.
With the extensive radio alert... we hope to have given a large number of people enough time... to make it to the port. As we approach the coast, you will all receive a booster to complete the vaccine already circulating in your body. After an hour, this booster will turn you into transport vehicles for the contagious cure. For how long? The contagious cure lasts between 5 and 8 days... during which it will be essential that you pass it on to as many people as possible... who will then have 5 to 8 days to do the same... and so on.
A very strange thing. One of the guests found a head in a cupboard. This is the hotel manager, Mr. Adams. I'm Detective Burkhardt, this is Detective Griffin. Who found it?
Did he love someone else? Yes. His art. She was everything to him. As much as I affected her, he liked me, but offered nothing but friendship.
We've solved the security issue, and if it's anything to do with immigration, the paperwork is in order. Do we look like immigration? Is there any part of the building that's off limits, that even you can't enter? Yes, the basement. The property manager said they rent it out, but I've never seen them.
Jesus! And that's how they all died. Is that your plan? Hit him? Yes, it's called a PIT maneuver, I've done it a million times.
It's been bothering you all your life. Besides, it's 10:55. I have ten more people before noon! Can't you just tell me the answer? If I told you the answer, then you wouldn't have found it out for yourself.
They've probably been eaten. - I'm sorry. - Excuse me, sir. We close the rift before anyone else is captured. If the creature has been summoned, it means that someone has summoned it.
You don't pay the price, but you can't feel it either. Eternal life in a useless pursuit. That's why I hate them so much. They can feel, but they just watch. They think they're guaranteed mortality, so they don't deserve it.
This wasn't visible before. It's some kind of copper alloy. Oxidation turns copper green. The Statue of Liberty was shiny, and then it oxidized. If we hid a message in the alloy that mixed with the surrounding metals, we wouldn't find it until it oxidized.
Good question, but I believe we can fight fire with fire. I've seen what your device can do, Twilight. It's a good idea to contain the magical energy there, but have you thought about releasing it? I don't even know how it works. But you know what, and since our opponents have already used it during the competition, I don't see what's wrong with us doing the same.
She was alone now, feeling melancholy. She was a stranger to her own body, her home of years, to everyone around her whose voices she heard and whose faces she saw every day. A deafening voice cried in the distance. This time, it was too late. When happiness was near, she didn't grab it and eternal joy fled her forever.
Traces of Provigil, a drug used for narcoleptics. Was he narcoleptic? No. What was a kid like Davis doing with a drug used for narcolepsy? In some universities, super-intelligent kids use it too. Laser-focused for hours on end.
It's not good. He says he was home alone. You asked me about my gun and I didn't know it was missing. So what, Leo? Did someone take it?
And Marko is not someone you want to upset. What's it like working with the boss's girlfriend? She can do whatever she wants. Like tonight. She changed the arrangement of a song just before we played it.
Thank you. I was making progress. I found the same cologne upstairs in the guest room that I smelled on the two corpses Does Deshu use that cologne? I don't think he had it tonight.
I walked into Dad's office, and he was holding a photo of me, looking at it with tears in his eyes. Dad never showed that kind of emotion when we were growing up. I know. That's what makes it so hard! Maybe Lily doesn't know how to show empathy because she never saw it in me.
An undetectable voice-activated recording device. Smaller than a hamster's bow tie. The only downside is that there's no way to access the recordings remotely. It has to be physically retrieved. How do we know they planted it?
From what I've read, you're obsessed with getting a limited edition "Ookla the Mok" lunchbox. Do you have a plan? On the "Everyone" websites, they always say that the most powerful form of piracy is social engineering. Getting people to do what you want. All I have to do is post on this forum that I found my "Ookla the Mok" lunchbox while cleaning my parents' house. I say that I don't want it, but that I'll give it to the first person who meets me and asks for it.
My father would say: "You know, one day I'm going to be here..." Pointing to my mother's side. Pointing to my mother's side. "Please let me know that when I come here, you're taking care of business." What happened to the health food store? We kind of sold it.
Her, blah, blah," something like that. And I said: "Except for medical school. She wasn't going to leave and drop out." I really can't say that at that point in my first meeting I could ever realize that he was lying in any of the things he said. Because his story was quite logical, as he told it.
Grab this bonnet, roll it outside, see if you can get a signal. I'll go with him. Give me the gun, Walinski. - Why? Because it's mine. - Because it's mine. I gave it to you.
The two Chimeras we met, Hayden and Corey... They both seem to be doing well. In vedrade, better than fine, they heal quickly and get stronger. They don't need our help. And I don't think they want it either.
Did you find Tom? Yes, we told him what was going on. He wasn't moved. I didn't know you were interested in his opinion. We're interested in his confession, and it looks like we're not going to get it.
It's morally wrong for me to be here. There's the problem of fur, of course. You're against my fur. You have to agree that a zebra skin looks better on a zebra. If I wasn't wearing it, what animal would I be in?
That I was human. Not anymore. The bet is off. One's word is one's honor. I don't forgive those who don't keep their word.
And the gun found in Lisa Hoffman's house is the same one that killed her husband 15 years ago. Dad, this is great news. Let's get you out of here. My people found the gun in a box in Lisa Hoffman's basement. If she put it there after shooting her husband, the gun stayed in that basement for 15 years.
So what do you think of the law? Because no matter what, I can't understand the section on federal oversight. - Can you? - I... I have to confess I haven't read it.
They diverted their attention from the patient and instead paid attention to the scientific evidence. What they thought they were seeing were articles by reputable academics in the best scientific journals in the field. But what they were actually seeing were articles signed by others and no one had access to the clinical trials behind those articles. So the companies could say what they wanted. I began to realize that what I was being told wasn't the whole truth. The information was presented to me in the most favorable way possible, so that I could present it to the doctors in the most favorable way.
In most sports, it seems that the players really want the ball. But volleyball is different. No one seems to want it. "We don't want it, take it." "I don't want it, you take it."
Once I increased the magnification, I saw a chemical signature. A series of benign molecules that don't influence the bacteria in any way. Your audience, Mitch. Remember. It meant that the bacteria had been produced by man. And it had the signature of the chemist who created it.
Remember. It means that the bacterium was man-made. And it had the signature of the chemist who created it. - We need to talk to him. - It's not that easy. Think of the signature as a... graffiti tag. I saw it, but I still don't know who painted it on the wall.
Bonnie's mother or Caroline. I've already tried to sell it. I'm sure there's a long list of vampires who would give anything to start over. You'll take the cure, Elena. Well, I don't want it, Damon.
I refuse to surrender. My reign will not end without a fight. Doesn't Maria's life mean anything to you? It means a lot. That's why you're the last man I'd entrust her to.
What? An unnamed folder is in the middle of that file. Someone went to great lengths to hide it. I didn't know it was there. Do you think you can open it?
One of them is in Witness Protection. And he left it until last because if he killed that target first, we'd go after him immediately. What did you see? Did you see something? Cryptography is a highly specialized skill, but it's fundamentally a mathematical process, which means it's a human process, but sometimes our technique can reveal where we learned it.
As I've said before, as soon as we land safely in a densely populated area, anyone carrying the new, contagious version will be able to spread the cure through direct contact. A handshake or a hug. If each of us brings the cure to at least two people, who in turn pass it on to two more, we'll start a chain reaction that even Ramsey won't be able to stop. You said you injected yourself with the contagious cure. Does that mean you've already spread it around the ship?
I'll get my coat. Please, as if you'd said that. - Wait, did he really say that? - Thank you, sir. Not only is prostitution the oldest profession in the world, but there's evidence that animals practice it too.
Do something! I can't cauterize the wound from here, Sylvester. Or can I? Damn, I'm smart. I've got an idea for the bleeding, but it won't work if you die before I do it.
And watching him teach you how to do things properly. He really taught me how it should be. He would understand why I went there. Where did you find the combination? I didn't discover it. I deduced it.
The only story you can tell? Because it's not true. It didn't happen here. People don't heal. My wife lost her hearing a long time ago and hasn't recovered.
Can I talk to you for a few minutes? About what? Can I ask you when you moved into this house? When? The records say you bought it on the 21st.
She's real. - Do you believe that? - Yes. Do you want me to talk to you about belief, Kevin? When the mind is emotionally drained, it latches on to anything that makes it feel better.
- Miracle. - Jarden. - What's Jarden? The city is Jarden. Miracle is the National Park that surrounds it and protects it from those who might corrupt its exceptional property.
I'll get you the contract. Liar, you're wasting my time. Go and get Hamid. There's proof. If you let them kill me, you'll never get it.
I'm sure he's generous too. You're in luck, because I'm heading that way. You can hitch a ride. My computer's broken, so the first one we find working, we'll take a look at it. And it better be worth something, my friend. Or I'll put that bullet back where I found it.
- I don't know. Let's bring him back and find out. The marks on Alex's body are Father's final message. If you hurt him, they'll disappear forever. What good is a message if no one can read it?
- I'll check the others. Even if the mark isn't relevant, Angela's scanner should show evidence of pressure, which could indicate the same curve. We may be able to determine the weapon used to do this. If Flender thought it was a ritual, he'd consider the weapon sacred. So he must still have it.
What if these communications have been intercepted or deciphered? They have been deciphered. So they know our location? When a code is broken, it provides opportunities. I wrote a new message and made sure it was discovered.
I hear the campaign is going extremely well. Now, what are we going to do about the Greek debt? If I'm elected... When I'm elected, I'll keep my promise to restructure the debt. And to stamp out corruption wherever I find it.
- It was a good job. - But not good enough to stay. I didn't want to be a maid all my life, that's all. So she found an opportunity and took it. I didn't find it, Lady Sybil did.
I really did have soft hands, didn't I? I took it as a compliment, but I don't think he meant it. Get out of my way. It's amazing how our skin changes, isn't it? The more you abuse it, the stronger it gets.
- Gunnery Sergeant Joseph Wilks. He struggled unsuccessfully with the attacker. - Paramedics are with him. - Do we have the murder weapon? I think the killer took it. There are fingerprints on the chair where the victim was tied up.
I'm very sorry. Photos are hard to see. Just one more. Do you recognize this rope? No, I've never seen it before.
I see you were born in 1892. I know I look young to be a publisher, but I have experience. I was just going to say that we were born in the same year. Have you seen the copy of our latest issue? I produced it myself, actually.
I'd better go and tell him the bad news. Do you think it's connected? It could just be a prison incident, or it could be more than that. What I do know is that we have a second chance to find the tanker. Don't waste it.
Guys, there may not even be an island in two hours' time. I've just spoken to the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The W80 nuclear warhead we're looking for is the model 1 with an adjustable capacity of between 5 and 150 kilotons. Right. And what does that mean? It means that if Bennett set it to maximum capacity, the blast radius would be 4.66 km.
Mr. Molesley can serve, and his place in the hall will be taken by Daisy. And dress respectably. Yes. Do you know where my cane is? I thought I could use it tomorrow.
I think you regret what you did. Not as much as I do. And before I left, we had the discussion that was coming up. I don't regret it. I'm just sorry we didn't have it years ago.
Have you thought about it? Yes, but first, how do I know you're not wearing a wire? I've thought about it and maybe I should show the letter to the commissioner. - And let him fire you? - I'll deny that I wrote it.
You always made me feel safe, Jack. I know things... have gotten complicated since then, with Aiden and Amanda... but I never stopped feeling that way whenever I was with you. I guess I'm just scared. This situation isn't over yet and I don't know... how it will end. Neither do I. But I do know... that I won't let it end... without this.
- I bet her parents are bad. - Sarah, I'm going to get you out of here. - Getting her out is going to hurt a lot. - I know I should be in pain. I know I should be in pain. I don't know if it's the shock, or if my leg hurts so much that I don't recognize it.
Don't make it so easy for me. It's a bit of a struggle. I can take it, you know? Dan, I can't make you any promises about the leg. I'll do everything I can, but I don't think we can save it.
But it's the reason she had to leave. I'm not lying. She made a recording for you. To take with you. Please accompany me to my apartment. It's on the top floor and I'll give it to you. No, I think you'd better bring it here.
- Can we open it? - Yes, of course. Whose is it? You. You sent it from Florida.
Is the pot in the cupboard? This is more shocking than Meredith Baxter-Birney. Look, I realized that ever since they abandoned the cupcake store, this space was available. Besides, I stopped asking permission for things when I turned 70. We didn't abandon it.
It's... the queen. Have you... Have you ever played chess? The queen is the most powerful piece on the board. It's what we're building here, for an army that kills its own citizens. If we're the only ones with it, we'll probably blow up the world.
Can you help me here, please? Nurse? Kill the spider. Please kill it. Don't let it get away.
I sent you that drink. Come to "Group G". We need you. Me, especially. If you believe that we have a moral responsibility for the future of what we're building here, follow me. If we're the only ones who have it, we'll probably blow up the world, but if Stalin has the bomb in his pocket too, the game ends in a draw.
All or none. F.D. Roosevelt's Science Advisor is here on the Hill. This is our last chance to send a message to the President. They can build this bomb without... without statesmen, without generals, but they can't build it without us.
Not even my wife knows. Enlistment papers? You'll stay right here as a soldier, under my command. Why keep me on the Hill? They can build this bomb without... without statesmen, without generals, but they can't build it without us.
But so far nothing. Your theory about the killer's modus operandi may have paid off. - Did you find anything? - Yes, from February 1983. The day after you saw the body, the police fined a van abandoned on the side of the road near Hollander Forest. The van belonged to a farmer who had lent it to a young woman, an immigrant worker, to go out and run an errand.
Unsettling, I know. Your pet beta fish talking to you. But time is money, Elliot. Do you need anything? Your water. Do you need me to change it?
I hadn't seen her for almost a month until I saw her at the station. Do you know a toxin called aconite? - Of course. - It was used to kill Freja. Someone put it in the coffee she bought at the train station.
Sorry, the flight is closed. We can't let anyone board. I don't understand. I mean... There's the door. Can't you open it and let us in?
Population, Dev." - Well done. Look at my comments. "I want to fuck your face." Who said that? Some guy with a dick who wanted to use it to fuck my face.
The bomb will explode if it comes into contact with air. - Don't worry, Lisa. - We'll find a way to get it out. Scientific minds, conference, please. What if the Flash's speed extracts it?
It's more of a favor. I'm not used to doing favors for people I've never met. This is like toilet paper. Did your friend tell you that I got you that crown? Did he tell you where I got it?
So if the fake street, the illusory street, ever appears on someone else's map, they know that their work has been stolen. Oh my God. An entire street in London has disappeared and you assume it was a copyright infringement. So we're looking at a trap street? We're looking for a trap street and we're not going to find it here.
- I said that death is trapped. You can pass it, but... But what? But... But you can't fool her.
Yes. We'll need your skills. A forgotten memory. My father used to play this on his Gusli to make it easier for me to sleep. He said that God used it to call the angels home.
I saw the birth of a boy. When I touched your wound that night. A vision. It only lasted a moment, but it was... vivid and clear. I felt you saw it too?
And you too. You know... whoever framed you... whoever framed you... they were hoping you'd get caught. You getting away wasn't part of their plan. And if you're right, if there really is a second bomb out there... So you think that if I'm free, we won't find it?
How much do you think it's worth? 50,000 dollars. The mask will fetch much more if you ever find it. It's not lost. I just haven't managed to recover it yet.
In fact, my currency expert found it after an efficient search. Really? - What happens if it's a fake? - But it's not. The Treasury Department has already validated it... and I have a contract with the Colemans.
Tell him what you told me. The Joker has an AI to send the laughter virus he told me to build. - Can you hack the AI? - No, it's a closed system. But I can build an interface to physically hack the AI, if you can find the hard disk that contains it.
I know you can't give me details, but is she evolving? Don't rush her. No work on the ground. I mean it. When I make a recommendation, I want you to respect it this time.
Here in the West, we call it the Mona Lisa of Sumer. We can't go beyond 500,000. 580. And only because I'm convinced that this beautiful piece belongs to its country of origin. If you're really convinced that it belongs to our country, why don't you offer it?
1 million dollars for a can of soup? Did you hear about this auction? Rich idiots will buy anything. This is the place. If you knew the mask was so valuable, why did you bring it to this dump?
He's in Germany. Avery's Challenger 650 is at my disposal and waiting. When do we leave? You came here without the vase. I'm beginning to suspect you don't have it after all.
We're in a hospital in Harare. In fact, we're testing the cure right now. Wait, where are you? In Washington. Why are they testing it in a hospital?
We're in a hospital in Harare. In fact, we're testing the cure right now. Wait, where are you? In Washington. Why are they testing it in a hospital?
They have no pride in their school and no respect for others. And I went home thinking that maybe the department was right to consider doing away with this place. But it wasn't. Because every one of these kids is worth something and every one of them deserves a chance. This is where I need your help and I'm not going to get it if you're surrounded by mountains of paperwork, endless meetings and administration.
It's worth checking out, Fitz. What about Coulson's offer? To stay for a while? I can't run away forever. If we put Andrew in stasis, like a human. it will slow down the transformation. Which will give us time to find a cure. Now, I won't pretend to understand... what you're going through, but if it's worth anything... If I had the chance to save the person I love... I'd take it.
As for what happened back there... We got what we wanted. Period. I understand, but that look on your face... I've seen it. Hunter had it too when he went after Ward.
- They won't catch us again. - We can't destroy it without Fitz and Coulson coming back, not this close. - What if the creature comes instead? - We'll be waiting for it. - What if we can't kill it?
That recording is all they need. We'll find a way around it. We can say it's been tampered with. And no one will believe it. So I've never seen it.
Now, if we don't steal that Yellowjacket... and destroy all the data... Darren Cross will bring chaos to our world. I think our first action... should be to call in the Avengers. I've spent half my life trying... to keep this technology out of the Starks' hands. And I'm sure as hell not going to give it to one now.
He's putting body sensors on the entrances and vents! How do we infiltrate Scott? Through the water pipes. There's no security in the water pipes. The pressure is too strong. But if we reduce it, that's how I'll get in.
Tell me who it is. It's getting away! Look at this. It looks like you've brought a hook for a sword duel. Actually, I brought a sword, but I seem to have lost it.
What are you doing here? I want to tell you how grateful I am. - You don't have to do that. This mess has been the most difficult situation I've ever been through. I wouldn't have gotten through it if you hadn't reminded me of what really matters.
I know you don't want that. Now that you've tasted that thing buried deep inside you. Do you feel it? No. I don't want it anymore.
I told you it wouldn't end well if we met again. Tell me where Jenny Mills is, or I'll shoot. - What do you want from her? - Nothing, I want her. Elytra's energy is important to someone I work with and it's essential that I get it back.
Well, I think we can say that the sensor works. - Are you all right, Dad? - Yes, dear. So, where was I? That's right, the future. " S02E05 " It's very strange to see your autobiography, especially when you didn't write it and it's not about you.
Prick! Jesus Christ! Drop the portal gun. Throw it in the center of the room. Someone confiscate it and don't damage it.
May I make a suggestion? - Numan didn't have the only copy. - What do you mean? He downloaded the shit, right? But he didn't delete it from the server.
- A few weeks later, a Russian mobster called Sergei Volkov was murdered. This photo was on his cell phone. It's the Warka Mask. It was reported stolen several months ago in Turkey. Have you seen it before?
Laurel. Do you trust me? Trust me when I tell you that this will work. Just one more thing. Whatever has locked her soul away won't give it up without a fight.
Those men you killed in Nanda Parbat... The effect of those killings must be wearing off. - I'm fine. - The bloodlust's back, isn't it? It's under control. You can't control it, Thea.
Oscar too. He took the Stone. How is that possible when you destroyed it, Ric? We have to find him immediately. Did you know he still had it?
Thank you, Tony. Are the two cameras on? The first one is on, and the second one is already recording. So, a few weeks ago, the town of Mystic Falls was completely evacuated. They say it was a natural gas leak that made it uninhabitable, but there have been so many rumors, so many whispers, and strange things have happened at night, unexplained things.
Bad news. I think Oscar has just learned to vacuum. Where is it? Where's the stone? He's got it.
The Earth has a much older prehistory than what we read in today's books. You can read that Puma Punku or Tiahuanaco, for example, were built between 500 and 800 BC. Some archaeologists have suggested that Puma Punku and Tiahuanaco may date back to 12,000 BC and therefore be 14,000 years old. Could there have been a sophisticated culture on Earth thousands or even tens of thousands of years ago? But if so, who developed it?
And why is he caged and shitting in corners? You call that glory? Can't she shut up for a moment? She can't, she won't! Keep the food, I don't want it.
The boy saw the Grimm's eyes turn black as night, without a moon or star in them. But it was too late. The grimm had cut off the blutbad boy's head. I don't like this story very much. I haven't finished it yet.
They even blindfolded them. But they didn't do that this time. No blindfolds, and the 3 victims were found in the same area, all within a few meters of each other. Dee's Original Diner had a back room. - Why didn't they use it?
When I say it's very dangerous, it's very dangerous. - I just... we're so... - Tell me something. That tattoo you got from the CCD, "for you"... How did you get it?
Is that clear? ! What have we got? The NYPD has just established communication... I already have it directed to the unit's phone.
Just like you're a real doctor. That's all right. This thing is strong, isn't it? É. We use it to guide us spiritually.
I don't know how Rama did things, but this isn't going to happen under my command. He wants to testify. - You've turned this into a joke. - We have... - This agency has built a reputation on its feet. - We said... - It wasn't made... - I won't let it go to the gutter!
And unfortunately you're stuck with me until we fix this. I'm not worried about your head and knee. We have a great orthopedist who will replace the whole knee. Now, the tricky part is the second bullet. It shattered on impact, leaving all these little pieces in your chest, so we have multiple small bleeds, some not so small.
That was the warden of Lee Penitentiary. It seems that your walk led you to Matthew Rousseau. Do you want to tell me why? I was just tagging along. With your pen in his hand? Is that where I left it?
Do you know Morpheus' identity? No. Nobody does. Why did you destroy his artwork two weeks ago? A better question is why did he do it in the first place?
So he took baby Wallace so they could start all over again with a new child? I'm going in a different direction. The drowning of the child ended the relationship. William and Ellen each kept half the blanket as a souvenir, as a memento But when William saw it displayed in Ellen's art piece, he freaked out.
When I do, you'll keep the call going while we get to the location. What we have to do, though, is get the painting back. So where is it now? Actually, I don't have it.
If we flood the chamber with the right amount of water, we can correct the submarine's position, freeing the hatch. 18 degrees would be enough to get the hatch out of the mud. The others have immersion suits. They can get out through the hatch and reach the surface. This chamber is an enclosed space. If we flood it, even partially, the water that enters will compress the air.
Sir Nicholas. Are you sure Nicholas intercepted the letter sent to my mother? I saw the messenger give it to Nicholas. He copied the letter and returned it, just as you said he would. He has certainly decoded it and sent it to his queen.
I discovered this when I was going through the photos of the rubble. - Do we have a bomb component? - Yes. When I was at the Judiciary, I caught the guy who planted a bomb in the judge's car. But he didn't build the bomb, he just planted it.
It wasn't about finding Jared's ashes, it was about my brother passing away. I know how much you miss him. Let's go. I don't want the kids to wake up. Do you want to take the box? No, why don't we leave it here so she can visit her brother in the morning?
But I must have Lyme disease. Just a few more signatures and we'll be done. Initial here to acknowledge that you've returned your keys. As a future neighbor, I want you to have a key. Initial here to acknowledge that you've received it.
Did I take it off? I didn't... I don't take things. Especially things that don't belong to me. So I'll sit in the chair, good sir, but I won't take it.
- Right, right. - Yeah. I sing all the time and the people who work for me say I'm great. Right, maybe you'd be more comfortable letting Piggy sing the song on her own. I'd be more comfortable if I sang it on Bradley Cooper's lap,
- Okay. Scooter! Your sweater is awful! I have to have it. But my mom made it for Christmas!
- Scooter! I was so relieved when I got your message. I thought I'd done something to scare you or that I'd sent an inappropriate photo of myself. Yes, you did. And thank God my mother didn't see it.
Seriously, Miss Piggy, you can't have a bottle of Piggy water on your desk during the show. - That's an unpaid advertisement. - I'm trying to make it known. Kermit. It's a great product. When you open it, there's lipstick on the neck as if I'd had a sip of water.
9 injuries? Sounds like a crime of passion. Or someone wanted to be very, very sure that he was dead. And we may have a clue as to who that someone is. The gun was cleaned, but forensics found fingerprints on the cutlery where the killer took it.
- Miguel. And we both know what his agenda is. Say something so he can stay. Listen to me. He manages to have incredible courage to do the right thing and prosecute the hit-and-run, and it's at that moment that life as he knows it ends.
By the way, how did he get the letter? There was no stamp. Was it a courier service or did the killer deliver it by hand? I thought it was strange that he didn't inform the newsroom. I heard they didn't want it publicized.
It's the story of my life. I was married for 11 years. I know all about it. When you send a Snapchat, you can only open it once for a few seconds. I can take a photo and choose how long people can see it.
This one, I'm sure, is real. Men, women are complicated and even if you think you're just sending a photo of your penis, we're constantly trying to fit together the clues about you, the man behind the dick. But your sausages are fine. Stick your dick out and be proud of it. If you sent it, it's because you felt it.
Oh my God! No, no, no. Don't look away. This is what you wanted. Now you're going to give me that pill. No one else can take it.
And that girl... My brain said I had to help you, but I didn't feel anything... For you or for her. What kind of person can kill and feel nothing? Len, whatever Darkness is inside you, if there's a shred of consciousness, then there might be hope. No, Sam said that once the soul is lost, you can't get it back and... And I'm sure that if I'm not stopped, there will be another murder.
After school, we went shopping at a second-hand store. We needed to buy costumes for an off-campus party. And Mike found a super-scary rabbit costume. I mean, it... it grossed me out, but he loved it. - But as soon as he put it on...
You become possessed. But if we can't take off our masks, how can we "dispossess" someone? Everything has a weakness, even ghosts. They hate iron and salt. So all we have to do is sprinkle the haunting with a little salt and maybe we can remove it.
Fantasy soccer players stop to bet while they take their pregnant wives to hospital. - Absolutely. - One guy was in Afghanistan and didn't leave the post that was being bombed - because he was in the middle of a situation. - I heard about him. The dedication to the league is what makes it wonderful.
Change of plans. Why? Because, after too long playing defense, today is the day we go on the attack. Look around you. We're in no condition to fight anyone. The Director needed permission to have me killed. And he only got it by convincing the others that I didn't have the Fulcrum.
Raven's verdict has just come out. She has to serve the rest of her sentence... - Two years. - Here at the FBI? The judge asked me a question, and if I had answered truthfully, it would have meant Raven's release. So I didn't answer it at all.
I don't know. I told you I never open packages, but this was important. How important? The sender paid a fortune to have the package delivered. If I don't get it back, I'm a dead man.
We'll do it next time. That was the president of Interpol. She wants the fiber tap removed immediately. That's a terrible idea. If we interrupt the connection, he'll know we've found it.
-How nice. Now, where exactly is the heroin warehouse? Too late. They've already removed the heroin. There are no cameras outside to see who took it.
- They were taught a lesson. - Right, they were taught a lesson. And what did the Great Leader do? In this photograph we see the Respected Leader and Generalissimo Kim Il-sung teaching the Japanese and the owners on their boat a lesson. Who was the man who grabbed the biggest rock and is throwing it?
If you hold this flame at the right distance from the coin, it will somehow completely dematerialize. Now that it's over, we can get back to work. Wouldn't you like to know how this trick was done? You never put the coin in your left hand. You simply held it in your right hand between your fingers.
And the next thing he knew, the little devil was manipulating his friends into a war with the authorities. You don't have to call them "devil" and "simpleton", they're called... I don't want to know their names. The world doesn't need to know. These idiots want notoriety, and I'm going to make sure they never get it.
In order not to be overwhelmed by the flood, the team set up the first tent. But the idea of filming soon fell through. About an hour later, I felt water on my ankles. If I'd still been in the tent, it wouldn't have been on the bank. We won't get it back.
Hold on. I can't hear you. I can't hear you. We're pulling over. Okay, explain the problem to me. Have Lilian pack up the meat and put it in the alley before it stinks.
He says he smells like a turtle. Can I help you? Yes, we're here about the caravan that caught fire. - And she's here. - Are you the owner? No, we're trying to trace the driver who abandoned it.
The guy left his wallet in the glove compartment. Who leaves a caravan in such a hurry that they forget their wallet? Here it is. Thank you, sir. I suppose it was already empty when you found it.
You don't know anything about me and Jada. That's not it. I respect what you've done. You're a true professional. A man who accepts a mission and follows it through to the end.
Oh, my God. I've got a great idea. Okay, think of him as a snowman from California. I've been working on this launch pad for months. If I'd known we were going to use it today, I'd have painted it.
You've wanted this your whole life. Nicholas is my life. This isn't a decision that needs to be thought through. Are you sure you've never seen that letter? Absolutely, and I can't imagine how the victim had it.
As much as we mentally want to give him the benefit of the doubt, it's impossible. We're on Action 2 News at five. News you can trust. Avery's arrest comes as Gov. Jim Doyle prepares to sign a criminal justice reform bill inspired by Avery's wrongful conviction. Two weeks ago, the bill passed unanimously and Gov. Doyle tells me he's going to sign it, despite the murder charges pending against Avery.
But I don't trust the FBI at all and I think they'll come up with a dishonest test that indicates that the blood in the tube is different from what was found at the crime scene. And that will be harder to overcome. I'm not worried about the key. I like the key. I'm glad you're using it.
The witness decides. I allow the question. The bookcase was pulled out, turned over and searched. It's reasonable to think that when it was turned over, the key fell out. But you didn't hear it fall to the floor when the key fell, did you?
An experiment in front of a jury? Then you have to reproduce the conditions. All right, then. That's it. The bookcase isn't here and I don't know if they're going to bring it, but... it's not here.
Correct. Were you the first to empty the bookcase? - No, I wasn't. - That's all right. But you know that someone searched it on November 5th.
Gorillas can be unpredictable. Jen... Despite their dark color, the dense vegetation can make them unnoticeable. I didn't see her. I really didn't see her. I was photographing a cub in the middle of some branches and suddenly a hand came out and grabbed the lens. Then I realized that the mother was half a meter away from me. I didn't see her because I was behind some ferns.
Was it yours, Junior? What are you doing? Irene. Irene, I'm sorry. Harper has it.
- That's true... - We need a new plan. I can't take you to Washington to walk into the White House with a list of empty demands. Tactics, my friends. We have to defeat this institution with a tangible tactic that can dismantle it.
No, no... Get the bat, Ace. We can all play! I'll bring Brendan's glove. He never uses it.
It's the Amber Stone. The witches' most sacred talisman. It strengthens their power. It makes their illusions more real. Why did my mother have it?
Don't interrupt! You don't know what it's like to put your emotions out there, naked for the whole world to see! What emotions? It's a synthetic work. Your masterpiece has a multitude of Keanes, which makes it infinitely distasteful.
It's Brazilian. Do you ever wish you weren't just watching moments like this? I'm not just watching. I'm feeling it. I feel life like I've never felt it before.
Take all our ships and men to Salamina. And you? I'll take the message from Daxos to Athens. A Hunchback was responsible for the fall of the Gates of Fire. He betrayed his country... took the red cape off his back and replaced it with Persian gold.
Mia, are you coming with us? I don't know. There's a complicated part of Beethoven's sonata that I have to nail perfectly. And the letters were sent on Friday. Juilliard. The audition was two months ago, but I can still feel it in my fingers.
I think it would have gone better if I'd had a gun. Do you need a gun to interrogate children? It's about confidence. A gun gives me a certain level of confidence. Knowing that I have it under my belt.
Nothing, I... Listen, I took the Oxford entrance exams. It's all about technique. I could help you. Once you've mastered it, it's always on, I'm sure.
You have to start from the beginning. Get up, get dressed, eat. Spring is waiting. Recently, the German Foreign Minister dared to imply that we are all responsible for the war and that we should pay the price together! So who started it?
Jerry, I've got an idea. Hello, Jerry, hello, Alison. - Jerry? -Yes. Remember last week when you said there was a fine line between good and evil, and you thought you'd crossed it.
I always wondered why he had a shotgun. And then I realized. It was because of Hemingway. Hemingway blew his brains out with a shotgun. That's the only reason I had it.
- Don. - Say. - And that head? - It smells like sausages. You never take it off.
- It's none of our business. - Yes, we do. No, it's great. Dr. Friedman, Mitchell, as the best cardiologist here at County General, I'm surprised you can't diagnose real heartbreak when you see it.
He lost his chance when his stomach was pumped in the emergency room. I'm talking about two murders. Do you think I want to know what my job is? If it weren't for me, you would have been forced to leave, so watch out. All right. Hazel, you wanted my attention, you've got it.
Don't waste my precious drink. Made in the cleanest tubs, from ripe plums and old ladies' spit. Anyway, that creepy General is looking for a girl called Carmilla. - Whose photo is this? - My mother took it in the mirror.
Rap artist At the time of Prohibition, the Mafia, Al Capone, all those bastards controlled everything, they ran all that shit! Americans soon realized that Prohibition did more harm than good. The current prohibition on marijuana laws makes everything more dangerous. $370 billion a year goes into the pockets of the underworld and the gangsters can do terrible things with that money. If marijuana prohibition doesn't achieve the goals we think it should, what made it be pursued the way it has been?
There's nothing left to map. I've covered every centimeter myself. Every cycle. Every pattern. If there was a way out, we would have found it by now.
This is going to be a great night, guys! We will! At last! This tape is fantastic. Who made it?
I recently had a falling out with my former boss. Disputes in your line of work must be difficult to resolve. A challenge, yes. What's the best thing you've ever stolen? I'm beginning to think I haven't stolen it yet.
Someone would have to stop you. Otherwise, peace would be lost forever. There is no peace anymore. It was destroyed by you. It was human nature that destroyed it.
So why did that note disappear? Yes? It says you have an appointment with Sarah Deakins. Who's Sarah Deakins? Is it because she didn't write it?
You shouldn't have taken it, Lily. Taken what? The lid of your father's urn. What's that? I didn't take it.
How are things going? The doctor said it won't be tonight and that we could go home. What's this? Your suitcase? Where did she get it?
Who is bad? How do I know what's right? That's Noah's decision. Not mine, not yours. And it looks like he's already made it.
Disappointed? He chose you for a reason, Noah. He showed you the evil of men and he knew you wouldn't avoid it. But then you also saw the goodness. The decision was placed in your hands because he put it there.
You do it. Where are the sponges? - What's wrong with that sponge? - It smells! That's because someone left it soaking in the sink.
- It looks like a reversal. - So moving on. What have you been doing? Can you not put the gum under my counter? Where do you want me to put it, Rafe? The last time I put it on the counter you freaked out, and now I put it under, which is the next logical step, and you're coming at me. Where do you want me to put it?
I get it. He's got a huge cock. And her vagina: "Goodbye". It's destroyed. It's like when you lend a shirt to a fat friend who gives it back all baggy!
I won't let that happen. I respect your commitment in the face of total failure. You have a lot of passion for a dead girl. You of all people should know that wielding and handling a sword are not the same thing. You don't think I've had her with me long enough to know all her little tricks, do you?
I should have let you die when I had the chance. Give him the sword, and we can finally be free. Understand this, Kyo. I will never give Bohan the sword. He'll have it, you know.
Hi. What happened to your head? I got hit by a van. I like this choice of music. Who made it?
Compliment them on something they've done or bought, not their eyes or anything, because they're born that way, so they know you like them, - You like their taste, you like the- Hum? Oh, I hate this song. You're kidding, this is my favorite. Oh, I know, I've just heard it so many times.
All right! All right! Come on, come on! I don't want your tongue in my mouth. Then where do you want it, man?
Tell me what it was about. The abandoned factory on Garner. -The paper mill? -Yes. When they closed it down, the state government didn't have it cleaned up.
- Do you want the gun? - Yes. Do you think you can? - Want it? There it is. - There it is. - You thought I'd give it to you, didn't you?
The best thing about this deal is that you won't even have to lift a finger. We'll take over future product development, to be done in China, and you'll receive a nice, one-off sum for the product. -We'll discuss that lump sum further... -See this ball? It's the one Peyton Manning threw to the guy who caught it with his helmet.
He's not even gay. He had a dick when he was 14 and didn't even touch it with his mouth. -If you let me finish... -So, did you eat that dick? -Ask me if I sucked it?
He had a dick when he was 14 and didn't even touch it with his mouth. -If you let me finish... -So, did you eat that cock? -Did I suck it? -I know you sucked it.
Is he molesting himself? It sure looks that way. Do you want to see? Man. What the hell are you doing? I really need to bang one, but it's not working, and I think I might have ruined it.
You keep insisting on that look, you'll lose those fucking eyes in a second. It's better with me than with the child, eh, man? I'm not a fucking child! I don't need your fucking help! I didn't ask for it, did I?
Synthetic stem cells, tissue regeneration. The applications for medicine are endless. It's extraordinary. Everyone will be scared at first. But as soon as they see what the technology can bring them, I think they will accept it, and I think it will change everyone's life.
We'll all send it! - New tradition, guys, okay? When this team starts winning, we'll pick it up again. And the pick has finally arrived. It's currently being transmitted by some guy with a walkie-talkie, who will take it to the Commissioner's podium.
I know what it's like to love and lose that person. If there's anything, anything at all, that you can do to help, let me know. How many times have you used that phrase with a woman? I've said it many times to many women, Mrs. Loretta. But this is the first time I've said it to a lady.
Immortals Immortals Sometimes the reward for keeping the faith comes when we put it to the test
Right under our noses. All this time swimming in the ocean. So what I'm saying is... Maybe, this thing we're looking for, maybe it's always been here. And we've only just noticed it.
Cheers. It's $12. What's going on? I said I'd order your drink. I didn't say I'd pay for it, darling.
How are you? Glad to be here with you, my son. - Thank you for coming. You've taken the first step and now you're ready to go. Redemption is always possible for those who want it, my brother.
-Shut up, Carlos! Manolo... if Maria didn't say yes to Joaquim... then she said no. And what are you going to do about it, son? After stealing Xibalba's magic medal in a battle... Chakal became king of the bandits. But when Xibalba stole it again, Chakal lost control.
They want to get back together as soon as possible with the people they love. It's my dream to win this competition one day. What does it take to do that? Having the right bird. And you don't have one?
Wittekop was the first pigeon to be born after Tony died. Do you understand? The whole village knows that bird. We all know how much Jos loves it. And when we see it flying, we remember his son.
The Arkenstone is between these walls. -Find it! -They heard him. -Keep looking. No one rests until we find it.
I'm sure of it. We've been through everything. Not far enough. Thorin, we all want to see the stone back where it belongs. But they haven't found it yet!
The Arkenstone is on this mountain! It's a trick! It's no trick. The stone is real. I gave it to him.
14 years old? What are you talking about? Where's the van, man? Where? You know we'll find it, now tell us!
Surgery has its complications. There's no doubt about that. But as we've already discussed, we often compare the risks of surgery to the risks of not having surgery. We all agree that the risks of not having surgery are reduced life expectancy, an increased risk of diabetes and many other complications. We know that, although it is a surgery with risks, the risks will be greater if we don't have it.
I bought a typewriter and set myself up as a public stenographer. What a joke. In four months, I wrote six letters and one original work. The original work was for "Tales from Real Life" and a waste of paper. But the idiot who wrote it sold it.
Can you prepare the camera? Thank you, sir. I read your report on Dharma. It was well-founded. Too bad you never finished it.
It's like a matter of life and death. So you killed that bad part of you. Killed it? No. You can't kill that thing. I think I locked it up and starved it and... And I fed it... Half a dose a day.
I've been chasing him like a shadow. London, Berlin, Vienna, Paris, New York, everywhere. Charan Grover would have been killed about seven times by now, but you know what, Jag? Death is a trivial punishment for him. Justice will be when he longs for death and doesn't get it.
Turner! My word is my guarantee. I may not be an academic yet, but I am a gentleman. At the moment the King has a painting of mine in Windsor. I guarantee he'll buy it for 500 guineas or more.
I'll bring one from downstairs. Yes? I found a small combuca. I hope it fits. Of course it will. Where would you like me to put it?
Haydon? He was very generous. Very generous with my position. He finished me off. I wish I'd put my painting in the toilet. Better still, I'd have taken it out of the room and thrown it down the drain.
Don't you get tired of burning ships and firmaments? No, sir. Sometimes I think I'd be better off setting fire to the house. With me, my wife and my surviving children inside. Then they wouldn't be tied to me anymore. It's your pain, don't inflict it on your loved ones.
It must be somewhere. We can look for it later. Where's the screen? Behind you, darling, on the chair. Hmm? - Shall I take it upstairs?
I got Liotta. Liotta says he wants to kill you! Didn't you return a registered gun after he paid you to do it? What the hell? Bring the limo or I swear, I've got the police here in front of me, I'll tell them you stole it.
Karos wasn't inside. Some stupid kid stole it. He had a bunch of stoned girls in the back. -Recovered the briefcase? -They haven't located it yet.
Shit! I came here to get away from people like you... Well, I have a question for you. What the hell is that thing? - We don't know. - Don't you? But if you brought it to my door.
The boy looks ill. I remember this house. Look at this frame, it's beautiful and very sturdy. It's a good one. I built it myself.
In the time it takes them to run 10 meters, the turtle might walk one meter and so on, forever. You're faster than the turtle, but you'll never catch it. You can only slow it down. Of course, you can overtake the turtle, as long as you don't think about the mechanics involved. But the question of "how" turns out to be so complicated that nobody really solved it until Cantor proved that some infinities are bigger than other infinities.
We can sit here. You seem very serious about this. Maybe you should debate Kaman yourself. God didn't give me the opportunity. He gave it to you and I think what you're doing is great.
When Rachel was ten, we were spending the day here and she was down by this river playing. I remember her looking for stones to throw into the river. Suddenly, however, she found a fifty-cent coin on the ground and as soon as she bent down to pick it up, a boy grabbed her hand and took it from her. I saw it from there and saw how he teased her as he walked away to go to his father. Rachel, of course, was upset that she'd lost the coin because she'd found it first and came to complain to me.
I mean, just the other day you wouldn't even admit that God created the world. I know that God created the world. Yes. Dedicated to that truth? Then why are you against your father defending it?
If I could remember, I'd tell you, but I can't. I want to do an experiment. I want you to try and let the music bring back your memories. Travel back in time. Then we'll stop and you can tell me where it took you.
The idea of caring for the elderly on a large scale was something new in human history and was bound to have problems. Nursing Home Scandal Grows There were accusations of warehousing the elderly, Michigan Nursing Home Profits Are Secret excessive use of physical restraints Deaths increase in hospital restraints and even when reformers challenged this practice and reduced it, a new problem arose.
We've rewired our brains for that. We need music. It awakens in us our deepest security. The security of living in harmony with each other and with our own self. What happens to you when you listen to it?
Everything came crashing down... including Uncle Ben, as you know. But the painting was fine. Yes. I think he... I think he saved it from falling somehow.
"When you're happy, you don't need anything, you have everything." "Wealth, beauty, youth." "It's good to be like this." "But you're tired of this life." "You don't want it anymore."
Is everyone served? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cry in front of you, Mr. Saint Laurent! No need to apologize, Madeleine, please. No pill? Yes, when we take it.
- You have everything. - Wealth, beauty, youth. It's good to be like that. But you're tired of this life. You don't want it anymore.
Usually, after someone says they've seen our movie, they give us an opinion... They say: "I saw your movie and I thought it was good." And, you know, sometimes they don't like the movie and they say: "I saw your movie and I thought it was interesting." Yes, it was interesting how you finished the movie before showing how the French cut off his head and displayed it all over the country.
-Can you? -Yes. Slow down, slow down. Are you coming? Tell them not to open it yet.
I just went to the bathroom. Come here, then! Come here, come here. What's wrong, do you need help? Kolya, don't you recognize authority when you see it?
How can anyone preach freedom while destroying the foundations of morality? Freedom lies in discovering God's truth. The Bible teaches us that. Know God's truth and it will set you free. Only the man who knows God's truth, who lives by it, who defends it... only that man is truly free.
Naft and Walker have just arrived. They're all here. Haven't you ever seen a demonstration turn around? Funny thing. People must be surprised when it happens, usually to those who start it in the first place.
Why, I don't know. Maybe it was spite, maybe it was force, maybe it was fuck knows what. To be honest, I don't care because from the moment I started making choices based on his decisions, I gave him a lot of power over my life, so I'm comfortable giving in to a perfect stranger. Guilt is natural. It also goes away if you let it.
He killed Lommy. What the fuck is a Lommy? He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and stuck it in Lommy's neck. He still has it.
You may well be more afraid of pronouncing this judgment than I am of hearing it. Ten years after Bruno's martyrdom, Galileo used a telescope for the first time and realized that Bruno was right. The Milky Way was made up of millions of stars invisible to the naked eye, and some of these lights in the sky were actually other worlds. Bruno was not a scientist. His vision of the cosmos was a mere guess, because he had no evidence to support it.
Mr. Jang is offering you a job. A job? I don't want a job! If life began around 1 billion years ago, we had to wait 400,000 years to see the first nerve cell. That's when life as we know it begins.
I think the message went to everyone. No, he wrote something bad about me and I clicked Reply and he let me send him a message. Dad, replies are public. Everyone can read them. And it looks like he posted it to his 123,845 followers.
Everybody get out of here. No, sir, you and your wife are trespassing. This is bank property. We're doing you a courtesy by giving you the opportunity to collect some of your belongings. - I suggest you take advantage of it.
- It's not worth it. I've been there, Frank. I've been there. - You have to be realistic. - I am being realistic. I didn't ask for your help, sir, and I don't want it.
I was going to show you that you were wrong. And you'd thank me. You'll be happy to know that I resigned today. You see? You always have the last word. Even when you can't say it.
We need to induce a coma and drill a hole in the skull to reduce the pressure. This girl is the only chance we have of finding her mother and preventing another terrorist attack. Maybe so, but that doesn't change the prognosis. Is there any way to wake her up after drilling the hole, with adrenaline or something? A high dose of Flumazenil might wake her up for a few minutes, but it will also kill her.
I feel bad, okay? Okay, you have every right to be upset, so I'll make it up to you, all right? I'll return your property. I promise. Do you still have it?
# I can't remember anything at all. # Who knows their own history? It certainly doesn't make sense when you're living in the middle of it. It's all just clamor and confusion. It only becomes a story when we tell and retell it.
Five more minutes and we'd have gone without you. "Us"? That mare is fantastic, beautiful, talented. - It's hard to believe. - I saw her myself in Florida.
Thank you. Excuse me. Where's the head? That's the first difference. We think he took it with him, but we're still scanning the area, just to make sure.
Partner, let it go. It's just a job. We have a murder to investigate. Believe me, I'm thinking about the murder. Who got it?
Don't do that. I won't. I need to talk to both of you. I found a pistol by the door of our house. - Someone left it there last night.
But... I will allow you a small income... to live a quiet life somewhere outside Paris. If you try to tell the truth of these facts, your original sentence will be reinstated. Do you accept my terms? My voice will never be silenced. But I promise you will never hear it.
Forget it. Stupid joke. You've probably already figured it out. - Why would I know the joke? - Because I've already told it.
- She'd be at school! - "... This is what I wished for." "I love you!" "I love Izzy, I love this house..." "But now that I have it, I don't enjoy it!
They look angry. Yes, they do. Thanks for the drink. You're welcome. But I don't want it.
Whatever the method, and I have a few more, we should cut and burn his fingertips, pull out his teeth... if we can't pull them out, sand them down to the root. We want to get rid of any easy identifiers. What about her face? That too. We'll have to make her totally unrecognizable.
We got nothing. The security camera on this level has been off for a week. Well, that's awfully convenient. The question is: was the guy lucky, or did he know the camera was off? Well, if he works here, maybe he turned it off.
It's the same choice I'll make now. Because deep down... I think I love him. No, don't insist. It's my decision and I demand that you respect it.
Well, phones or no phones, I wanted to tell you to your faces. We've found a permanent place for your antenatal clinic. - Finally! - In the town hall community center, on Argent Street. And now, the best news of all is that we can have it two afternoons a week, not one.
Can I have my sword back? How come... It's not much use to anyone, just me. Of course! If you keep it with you, especially now that swords are illegal, it's because it's valuable.
- No, it has to be. - It has to be. - No. If you kill the child, they'll kill me. But if you have her, then you can... They'll let you go, Nessa.
- I was thinking the same thing. It looks like a bird's egg. That's why I chose it. The old desk looked good there. I'm glad he kept it.
You're far from here. What does that mean? On the hill. A big dam tree. You saw it too.
Let the priests discuss good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I'm done with those who support it.
- Goodbye. - See you next time. Hello. The Moroccan lamp, was it a possession before the wedding? We bought it together, Ted!
Was poor old Mr. Nightingale rude enough to die? Yes. However, you don't seem inclined to join him. No, I'm not at all inclined. And here I was thinking that you didn't fear death. I don't fear it, but I don't long for it either.
It didn't work. I tried to consecrate it and absorb its magic, but... - there's nothing there. - I don't understand. The witch's magic is infused in her bones, until it's consecrated. Then someone has already consecrated her, because there's nothing here.
This is just the beginning. We've got something good here. Do I end up like Terry? You think I gave him that disease? The doctor said he doesn't know how he got it.
Mommy, Miki's here. See my aguijón? Candela, please! Hello, there's lasagna. - Who made it?
Yes, that's true. I need to do that. Hey, are you okay? Yeah, I just feel like crap all of a sudden. The flu's going around, I think I might have caught it.
Oh, I mean, you know what I mean. We used to go out with other couples all the time. Now I'm so busy with the boutique, and you're constantly in front of the computer, and at night we just come home and go to sleep. You know what? Life will pass us by, and one day we'll wake up and realize that we've lost it.
If he ever posed for a portrait, it no longer exists. He was once described by an acquaintance as "a short, dark-complexioned, fat little man." Michell imagined a star so big, so massive, that nothing, not even light, could escape its gravitational pull Can you find a black star? You can't see it with your own eyes, not directly, but it could leave a kind of footprint on the cosmic beach.
The stars closest to the center of our galaxy whiz around it at more than 40 million kilometers per hour. What could make them move so fast? The only logical explanation is that something with the mass of four million suns lives in the center. But where is the blazing light of four million suns? Since we can't see it, it must be trapped inside a black hole.
Well, I won't beg that son of a bitch. Tell Pierce, "forget it". There's no job for him here. Chancellor, listen. I'm sure this is just a negotiating position. Make a counter-proposal, I'm sure he'll accept it.
The vital signs go off for longer before disappearing. It looks like a response to pain. This is what we'd expect to see with radiation exposure. I know how it sounds, Jackson, but there's another explanation. We just haven't found it yet.
- Hmm. I've been trying to figure it out. But... I've found a formula. But I can't understand it.
The cow wasn't just killed. It was gutted. Well, why would Garth be there? He said he was on a hunt, right? Maybe he was hunting whatever killed her.
- Plumbing is outdated! Everyone wants everything in copper these days. Aidan, stronger! I already knew that, so I'll be in and out for the next few days trying to fix up the house as best I can. Unless they buy it, then nothing will change.
Do you know how embarrassed I was to get a call during my criminal proceedings for my behavior during the Pub Marathon because of a voodoo curse my son put on his art teacher? I didn't want to get her pregnant. I just really hate art. Everyone does, son. That's why they lock it away in museums where no one will ever visit.
The real Stan Lee is there. Excelsior! But listen, while the comic book guys are disappearing, you have a good attitude, friendly and, a good catch. But now... your chance is knocking. - Don't let it slip away.
It looks delicious. It's not. Hey, a friend of mine bought a painting here. Yes, I remember that painting. And that's the man I sold it to.
The way that mist appeared, I've never seen anything like it. Barry! Iris. I'm fine, Dad. What did you bring her here for?
Renata had to make some difficult decisions. Such as? Alejandro left most of the money to charity. Auntie only got the house, and she can't afford to keep it, so it will be sold. Well..., can we at least stay here while you try to sell it?
I don't know anything about it. Why is that? What's in that drawer? Stuff. Personal things. Well, maybe I accidentally left it open.
When I was little, he worked about 15 or 16 hours a day. He basically gave up everything else in his life. He always made it clear that I should focus on my life and my studies so that I didn't end up like him. He doesn't want me to be overworked like him. But the chance to be the best in the world at something... you don't get that often in life.
There. We found nothing. Not even a smell. It's 3pm, so school's out. If there was a bomb, wouldn't he have exploded it by now?
I'm sorry, those clothes don't suit you. Give it back. I mean it. It's a bit embarrassing. I think you look beautiful. Why is it cool when Catherine wears it and not me?
This is your apartment. Mom! Dad donated our house. Did he? Who did he give it to?
She said it was the flu. Did you see the way she avoided the light? That's called photophobia. It can be a symptom of meningitis, but meningitis is treatable. As long as we treat it quickly.
- And that worries you a lot? - Of course. I'm a businessman. There is no organized crime without law and order. I love this city, and I'm watching it go to hell. But I won't let it fall without a good fight.
- What is it? - My only valuable possession. A sapphire and topaz red ant made for me by Joel Arthur Rosenthal, the Fabergé of our time. The red ant is one of the most poisonous creatures in the world, like Fiona. And JAR, my dear Joel, has been working on it for months. - Would you like me to use it?
Here's the proof, Lorenzo, that all of Florence is under our command. Your citizens, your daughters... your wife. Perhaps under Federico, she will finally have a son. Kill me... and I swear, the Medici wealth will remain forever out of your reach. The men who guard it are the only ones, apart from me, who know its location.
You seem so indifferent. Unless you sound like you're lying when you say that. But it didn't. Did you identify the ear? We've identified the knife that cut it.
It just happens. Did forgiveness happen to you? I died. I'm between deaths. Punctuation at the end of a sentence gives meaning to every word, every space that preceded it.
I wanted to surprise you. And you... you wanted to surprise me. I let you get to know me. To see me. I gave you a rare gift... but you didn't want it.
- I don't want to intrude, but did you like it? - Like what? - The marriage proposal. - Being the subject of so many tweets? And they published my photo, I don't even know where they got it.
- Yes, we're almost there. No, we're already there. Welcome to Nenhures, Municipality of Mysterious City. - Sinan, don't stretch the joke, okay? - You're the one who dragged it out. - Come on, let's go.
Something like that. In your story, the boy and girl break up. No, they get married. Is it your story or ours? You're the screenwriter, you write it.
I don't understand. Have I done something wrong? Carrying a concealed weapon requires a permit. It's unloaded and broken. I only have it to scare you, in case I get robbed.
Angelo is safe. If all goes well, he'll be released. - Are we okay, "Troca"? - We're not fine. I haven't tested the merchandise yet. I haven't even seen it yet.
What was it? It was raining the day Siegel died, wasn't it? It was raining. Why was it raining? What if he hid it in a place where it would never be found?
Her boyfriend... until last month. And that cross-country runner, Brad Myers, saw Emily leave her bike at the gate, and then enter the park at 7:15 am. Wait a minute! I don't remember seeing a bike at the start of the trail. He remembered so many details about that bike that I started to think that maybe he was planning to steal it himself. Or he was watching the beautiful girl who was riding it.
Eventually. These people are very intelligent and organized. As demented as they are, Joe Carroll's groupies are far beyond ingenious. But when you find them, there will be more. This is what our society has become, this obsession with violence, the need to express it in its purest form.
I'm not a big fan of fate. Neither am I. You know, I believe that our decisions and our mistakes define us, but lately I don't know anymore. You know...... why I was in that subway car? I never take it, but I was in a hurry to get home, you know? Me....
I'll take you to him. Why didn't you call 911 when I heard you come in? I panicked. I ran to the basement to load my shotgun. I never thought I'd use it.
They used drugs to survive the brutal conditions. The unexpected effect is that they repressed emotions... Compassion. They knew what they were doing, they just didn't care. I asked for the drugs, Meg. Your company made it.
How beautiful. You're hurting me! I asked you a question. Who was here yesterday? I don't know who rented it.
- I'm hungry. - I'm losing confidence in you, D. - I swear! I was here with her two days ago. I'm the one who buried her!
But she told me all about that box. Of its special meaning for her? Because you made it for her. Catherine. Howard didn't make it.
Your special meaning to her? For having made it for her. Catherine. Howard didn't make it. You know who made it.
Yes. I also remember the Battle of the Alamo, but that doesn't stop me from eating Mexican food. Drugs in prison aren't the craziest thing you can find. But I'll tell you what it is. To think that you can open a road and say that only white girls use it.
But no. He protects the baby. He even defends it against the hyena. Why would he do that? Why would this wild animal do that? Because even a wild, predatory beast recognizes innocence when it sees it and feels the need to protect it.
Which ones? You... for insubordination. And you... for getting drunk at work. Thank you very much for your attention. Judge, the fact that Mrs. Mallon shows no signs of the disease doesn't mean that she doesn't have it or that she can't infect others.
Stand up. Get over here! God damn it! What does this have to do with me being able to walk again? You have to learn how to use the chair before you leave it.
- Thank you, Chief. - You're welcome. Congratulations, Jane. You now have full security clearance. Very few civilians get it.
What puts Cruz at the crime scene? They found a Cruz sweatshirt stuck in a bush outside the house with Sarah Feinberg's blood on it. There was also gunpowder on one of the sleeves. What about the gun? They didn't find it.
I need to talk to the governor. Are you sleepy? Mae Feinberg gave us the location of the gun. It was in a pond just off I-35. So that's what David was looking for? Yes. We couldn't have found it without his help.
Rasil Kalif is an asset working undercover for the Russian mafia. If they get their hands on those bombs, God knows who they'll sell them to. The Syrians won't get their effigy back. It's gone. I've already sold it to the Russians.
- What's going on? That door is open. Maybe you left it unlocked. I sealed it with blood magic. I'm the only one who can open it.
I was in her office working on a potion. - What kind of potion? - Will it hurt us? A memory potion. Regina said she's going to use it to prove she didn't cast the curse.
What do you mean? Phillip. Your son. They loved watching movies together. That's why you started this company and why you won't lose it for any money.
I'll pay. You pay, whether you eat meat or not. FOOD WATER WATCH (Executive Director) When you look at who benefits and lobbies for this system of animal production, it's the biggest food producers in the country and the biggest meat producers. And when they get bigger and richer, the Cattle Industry (Senate Agriculture Committee) can dictate policy on food production, because they have a lot of political power. Is that why Al Gore, even as vice president, never addressed the issue of livestock and didn't mention it in the documentary "An Inconvenient Truth", or in his organization, the Climate Reality Project?
Maybe she doesn't know how to speak. She probably wasn't taught to speak. Approximately 70 years ago in Orion, the women dominated the men. But in a revolt and after a civil war, the men took control. Instead of abolishing slavery, they took it back and in many ways made it worse.
It's not. If I wanted an obsolete laboratory, I could go to a community college. Let's customize it. Here your opportunities will be endless. Last month, I sent a vaccine to a colleague in Delhi, who recreated it on a biological 3D printer!
At your expense? Do you have any idea what your grandfather went through to buy this newspaper? To have a voice in this city? Do you have any idea how many years our family was invisible? What's the point of having a voice if you don't use it?
- they release Daniel. - Then we'll rob him. A few banks. If we robbed ten banks, we'd still be short. Why don't we recover the cargo from Las Tres Letras? The DEA has already burned it.
Previously in Ravenswood... They found a knife in our garden. Someone put it there.
Pull it out! You did the right thing. Do you want information about this knife? How did you seal the pact? Who used it to kill Luke's father?
You did the right thing. Do you want information about this knife? How did you seal the pact? Who used it to kill Luke's father? Who buried it in their garden?
We're much better now. Thank you. Thank you. Any sign of the doll? Not since that night. I thought the police had taken it.
What are you doing here? Pi's letter... I was about to... I just need to make some adjustments. - You haven't written it yet.
- To Father K. - To Father K. We seem to have had the same idea. It's Cami, right? I've been told that Kieran's necklace is missing. And that key he always used, I assume he left it for me?
He was with God in the beginning. In him was life. And that life was the light of all humanity. The light shines in the darkness. And darkness cannot overcome it."
It makes magic look so easy. It starts with respecting power. And then believing that you deserve that power. - Can I ask you a question? - Yes, of course. Magic... what do you use it for?
I have the right to know who killed my daughter. I just need you to answer a few questions, - about Corporal Russell. - All right, what are your questions? - Is he armed? - Corporal Russell picked up his gun yesterday, and he hasn't returned it yet.
We've already detected the traitor who may know the name of every Asset Previously on "The Assets"... Top Hat tried to re-establish contact. What if it's a decoy and they're looking for proof of treason? The KGB knows we're looking for the source of the leak, and they don't want it found.
They say that the agent who mixes them is called Pirace... That's his signature. The "Space Cowboy". That's the drug Joff Soika took before he died. It's powerful stuff. Every time I see it...
Teri! Where have you been these last few days? I didn't know I owed you an explanation. This bracelet has been in my family for generations. The last time I saw it, Castor was wearing it.
So. Wait a minute. Drake's not back yet. It's too risky, trying to catch the Suvek without a plan. We have an opportunity. I won't let it slip away because you're waiting for your boyfriend.
Leekie set us up. - Set us up? What's that? - Yes. The culture we found that was compatible? - He let us find it.
Writing the BIOS for a machine that no one is going to call. You're right. You're right. Who cares about the machine? What matters are the people who are going to use it.
Yeah. Look, Daniel, don't ever do that to me again. OK? Don't turn the light off again. I didn't turn it off.
There is an energy source in this bullet. There is a micro-electrical mechanical system in the bullets. Inside the bullets. Active aerodynamics that alter the bullet's trajectory during flight. I've never seen anything like it. Do you have any idea who might have made it or where it was manufactured?
Come here. Once you start catching big fish, you'll want more. Okay? And as soon as I send this up there, they'll want more. Washington's been trying to get a man in town ever since Howe took it over.
Give me the second clue. First, I want you to look inside yourself and tell me what is so important about the relationship you had with your father. How would I know? Your language says a lot about who you are. You use it to control people, to bewilder them, to bend them to your will.
The pyroclastic flow. It has to be. We have to take cover now! How far does this museum go? There's a basement, I've seen it.
Not if I show you first. Jenny Mills. I'd love to exchange news, Chase, but we have to go. And needless to say, I'm the best shot here. After we use the flashlight, I promise we'll give it back.
Hmm. I love you. I love you too. Okay, I have one last question for you. And I can't believe I haven't asked it yet.
You saved my life. I wouldn't have had to if you hadn't taken the bomb. - You hesitated. - Hesitated what? When Bellamy asked who was going to take it, you hesitated.
Our mission is to find Monroe and kill him, remember? This isn't for you. It's for your mother. Do you trust those two? I'm still pulling the knife out of my back from the last time Tom stuck it in.
They have my sister! Would anyone here like to help me rescue this girl's sister, who has been kidnapped by a band of marauding Orcs? The salary is 200 pieces of silver. There's the door. I suggest you use it.
Extremely. - A, the coke's gone... - What? ! - What do you mean, it's gone? ! - It's not gone, but "you know who" has it.
Previously on "Turn"... Washington's been trying to get a man into town ever since Howe took it over.
And we're on the wrong side of the scaffold. Unless we do something about it. What's that? Put one of these on. The city is filling up with loyalist refugees now that Howe controls it.
But Mom barely appears in the story. No. This is the story about you falling in love with Aunt Robin. And you're thinking of asking her out and you want to know if we're okay with it. I can't believe this. I've kept this story short and succinct and you haven't understood it.
No, I'm not. Someone at the agency found Bobby Pardillo through the emails and phone records unless you tell me that Dante Scalice worked as a cryptologist for the government, there's a leak. This came through official channels. It was requested by a police officer. Are you telling me that it is customary for the NSA to carry out electronic surveillance of questionable legality for any local authority that requests it?
How long have I been here? A day. The doctor came. He said it was best not to get out of bed. I had to make sure I didn't move it.
What are you doing? Give him a second. What were you supposed to do with the van as soon as you managed to steal it from us? I was supposed to take it to a parking lot in Brooklyn, park it, and drive away. Who would pick it up?
Maya gave Stavros a counterfeit 50-dollar bill today. So the future Mrs. Jamie Reagan is a criminal. Like you know where every bill you own comes from. Her White Knight. I'm just saying she might have picked it up in a delivery.
Did you take her? - Took what? - The knife. Yes, he wanted me to take it. He wanted me to put it in the bag and take it to the university to do some laboratory tests.
- Stiles? Is it the doll? Right, but then why would he go all the way to school and then home just for a doll? One that was in the car from the accident to begin with. We didn't find it in the coyote den.
A hole. What gets wetter when it dries out? A towel. When is a door not a door? Everyone has it... but no one can lose it.
A towel. When is a door not a door? Everyone has it... but no one can lose it. What is it? I don't... Everyone has it... but no one can lose it.
But maybe you should keep them. There are still some of us out there who aren't so non-lethal. Like the twins. I thought we were going to give them a second chance. They don't deserve it.
Catastrophe, you can't make money without nipples. Well-manicured and beautiful hands. Nails without varnish. But this tattoo, well... I've seen it before.
Who are they? What did they want at Fort Polk? I've been thinking, maybe it's a state-of-the-art weapons system. I've also been thinking about that tattoo. I know I've seen it somewhere, like on a woman.
Did I say something wrong? No. You're absolutely right. Can you hand me the scapula, Dr. Fuentes? But you've already examined it.
So we think she's waiting for a new passport, perhaps with a new name, which would take her safely out of the country. I know what I did was wrong, but I just wanted to go back to my family, to go home. To go back to Esperanza. We checked with the local authorities, and we know she was born there. We know you had a house there until last year, when you sold it to come to this country.
I can't see the way. But I know you can. You have the ability to see the weak point in any object. Focus your key. If the time controller has a weakness, you're the only one who can see it.
- We'll take care of it, Inspector. - But what if that thing attacks? Place these lanterns along the coast and on the bridges, around the creature and at six-meter intervals. What will they do? They will emit a signal that will force it to stay within the circle formed.
Are there other places in the cosmos where matter and energy have gained life and consciousness? I want to know my ancestors... all of them. I want to be a good, strong link in the chain of generations. I want to protect my children, and the children of the ages to come. We, who here embody the eyes, ears, thoughts and feelings of the cosmos... have begun to learn the story of our origins -- starry material contemplating the evolution of matter, traveling the long road that led it to consciousness.
I washed myself in shit thanks to you. I took a poop bath. Rich people's shit is different. The smell goes away, but the mark doesn't. I swear I put it in the right place.
- You drive me crazy. - Come on, you bad dog. Are you grumpy? - Where's the turtle, Emin? - Didn't you leave it there?
What do you know about the Book? His Holiness believes it was written by Nephilim, the descendants of angels and men. I find that notion romantic, but... unlikely. No, I believe it was transcribed by the scientists of the ancient civilization of Crete... 9,000 years before Christ, in the place that later became the legendary Lost City of Atlantis. And their descendants, the Minoans, brought about the end of their civilization while trying to take it over.
It was one of the reasons I came here. - I don't understand. - I'm with the FBI. I love the agency and defend it tooth and nail. But I'm not blind to the leaks and corruption that destroy it.
The same thing will happen to you if you don't disappear. Patrick, listen to me, you don't have much time. They'll track you down and think you ran off with the jewel. Me? What about the other guy? The one who really stole it?
Wait, if you didn't get the jewel, then who did? - I don't know. - How can you not know? I was undercover, that was the point. The Russians obviously don't have it.
It's unlikely that he lied about that, given the nature of the other things he confessed to. I'm still of the opinion that they're trying to frame Iris. So it's likely that it was the killer who delivered the message, which led me to analyze the recording. After examining it in detail, I discovered that there are two levels of ambient sound, which suggests that it is a recording of the recording. The first level captures the sounds around Iris as she leaves the message, the second captures the sounds near the person who recorded her again.
My assistant told me you'd come to see me. Comfortable? I know you're the one who recorded Iris's message. -How? -And I also know that you recorded it here.
You almost died from those drugs, Jordan. They caused a massive pulmonary embolism - a blood clot lodged in your leg and traveled to your lungs. I've been working for years to get to the games. This is my life. - And you almost lost it.
Prepare the transport. Right, here we go. - What did you find? - It seems that Aaron had files locked in a virtual vault. Unless you manually enter the password, it's invisible. That's why they didn't find it.
They don't claim responsibility for their crimes, and the organization's purpose is unknown. This makes them terrifying and dangerous. And with the technology that SHIELD has provided, they have now become lethal. The most lethal criminal organization anywhere in the world. We didn't supply it to them.
- Stuck? Old houses move over time. Things get stuck. OK, well, do you know Emily? Well, her uncle bought a house near Manchester, which was haunted. And he found a guy in the classifieds, who cleaned it up in, like, one visit.
While the Irishman sitting next to her looked like a potato. A farmer. Like a pole. And I thought, fuck the English whore. So I kept it. I didn't give it away.
Sir, I've just sent new scouts to observe the enemy. I'm getting tired of contradictory reports that only guess at the enemy's intentions. This letter, written by your man on Long Island... That letter wasn't received through the right channels. And that's why I ignored it.
I'm limited. I'm not good enough. I'll never get where I need to be, it's true. And I see that now. That's why you didn't want me to take it.
- What's wrong? No! I don't have to explain myself to you. Just cancel it. You always ask me for the moon and now that I've got it, you say no.
But there is a theory that so-called "exotic matter" could provide the key to unlocking the journey through wormholes. All you need is matter with negative mass. And we are only aware of matter with positive mass. So we call this exotic matter. It's not that it can't exist, but we don't know it yet.
The Tarahumara firmly believe that the Star People still exist today in the Chihuahua Desert. They believe that these tall, blond people may represent the heirs of the star people who brought them into this world. They believe that there is a portal there and that these star people use this portal to transport themselves to various places on Earth and also off Earth. Throughout the architecture of Paquimé we see hundreds of T-shaped windows, which look very similar to a portal more than 6,500km away in southern Peru. Here, perched high in the Andes, this shallow T-shaped opening, called the "Gate of Amaru Muru" is surrounded by many legends that describe it as an active portal, which transports beings both into this world and out of this world.
It's too late. She must know you're here. She's already gone into labor once, so at least she knows what's waiting for her. Yes, we both know. I don't think your hand ever recovered from the times I squeezed it.
44 years old, single. He moved here two years ago from the continent. His relatives in Cleveland have been notified. The bullet that killed him was a .22 caliber, at close range. I've already sent it to Ballistics.
Zelena's weak point is white magic. Now it's clearer than ever. You're the only one who can defeat her. That's why we paid the price for Regina's curse. To find you. The price of the curse... is the heart of the person you love most. If one of you cast it... how come you're both still here?
The way the bay peeks out at the end of every street. I hoped you liked this place. I do. Life is strange, really. It's the strange parts that make it interesting, isn't it?
He scribbled a dedication at the bottom. "To Tangerine." I doubt Mr. Young tore up his own song. Bad for him, good for us. Yes, because if it was Tangerine who tore it up, that means she's gone mad.
You want to go home with me, don't you? Yes, I do, Tuffnut. I want to destroy other people's things with you. Apple. You've won me over. I notice you're a gentleman who recognizes quality when he sees it.
An executive at a big bank wanted them dead, so he paid someone with the skills, resources and moral depravity to make it happen. That someone was me. The joke... is that your machine is telling me to save Cyrus. How much did you have to break it to make it care so much about people? It didn't break her.
That someone was me. The joke... is that your machine is telling me to save Cyrus. How much did you have to break it to make it care so much about people? It didn't break it. That's what makes it work.
He sent letters home that summer, saying how they had fallen in love. In love! She fooled him perfectly. She even let him hold her hand and they took photos of it, a pathetic nobody holding the hand of the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen, and that's where Stefan came in, the worst of them all. Peter couldn't see her face when the photo was taken, but he did later, when Stefan posted it on the internet, her naked body exposed as if it were a joke.
In the prison where I grew up, there were no principles. What mattered was surviving. As for the knife... I didn't find it by chance. The man who gave it to me became my adoptive father.
All right, all right. Calm down. If you believe that this coin made "Miss Jenny" steal my gun... ...what I believe is that a lot of people like you are willing to pay six, sometimes seven figures for what they believe in. And since you believe in the coin and really want to get it, how do you plan on it not affecting you?
Because today, the Police Department is formally recognizing the individual known as the Archer. And I'm using my new position to disband the anti-vigilante task force - charged with capturing him. - Thank you. Make no mistake, vigilantes will not be tolerated. But I refuse to hunt down, in the name of this city, - the hero who saved it.
Sticker? From the pattern, I'd say the Wolf of Wall Street was wearing a wire. A wire? Yes, ma'am. We think the killer removed it from the victim's body after shooting him.
Jamie. Knowing is not illegal. And I guarantee you'll never link me to that transfer, so you'll never be able to prove witness tampering. But, yes, I knew about the bug. And Peter wasn't wearing it when he was killed, because he'd already handed it over to the feds at the drop-off point at Lafayette and Spring.
it makes me really sick. So we stopped that immediately and moved on. And our antidote to that was to build an electric chair and fry Andrea True. We must have been together for about two months, and I wore a T-shirt that Dee loved. He just kept telling me how nice I looked and how much he liked the shirt, and where he'd bought it, and how great I looked.
Maybe I'll sell it. Maybe I'll sell it right now. Alec. You don't have to do anything today. This news has to be devastating, even if you don't feel it yet.
And on the first call, he thought Gabriel was an athlete. He must have been. So he was an athlete before he became disabled and he's a technology specialist. That's good. What else? It's not just the technology, it's how he uses it.
I've been doing this for twenty years. I was a grasper for 10 years before that. All that experience and knowledge means something to me right now. He's not coming, is he? Rehabilitation is for those who want it, not those who need it.
Look closely, everyone, and maybe someone will recognize it. - What's going on? - There's been a huge breach of privacy. Come on, guys, even having this conversation here is a HIPAA violation. Either we identify her, apologize to the patient and fix this, or this has to be reported to the Administration.
Is this something you'd like to talk about? Yes. Okay, I'm going to take some notes. I'll be right back. She followed behind me, waddling with a little plastic tiara on, and she just wouldn't take it off.
How can we be sure? There are bombs in the street and a bomb in the conference room and we'll detonate them from here when he gives his speech. Remember to hide the satellite dish from the drones. We'll position it in the tree line for greater range. They won't be able to see it from the air.
Cameron? Yeah, it's interactive. I'd better show you. You're going the wrong way. No... If you want this machine to stand out from all the others, stop talking about the machine and start talking about those who made it.
No... If you want this machine to stand out from all the others, stop talking about the machine and start talking about those who made it. They've worked hard for this. The future will come whether we like it or not, but it's not written anywhere that it includes some of us, and getting there isn't free. There's a price. Those who came up with the money would like to take the credit, but the credit goes to those who built it.
We have more in common than I expected. I accept the offer. Shall we talk about the details? Pascal, I feel I've expended a considerable amount of energy... to get your attention. And now that I have it, I think it's your turn to get my attention.
I don't need a treadmill! The doctor says you have to exercise! I already do a lot of exercise! Destroying my will to live isn't exercise! If she's not going to use it, why are we doing this?
Maybe he wasn't trying to get up. - He asked for the cane. - Yes. He's always had it. He got it from his father, who got it from his father.
But sometimes, no matter what we do, the universe seems to have other plans. How do we explain the inexplicable? The shocking coincidences and incredible strokes of luck? Is there some hidden force guiding our lives? Greek mythology says that of three destinies... one goddess weaves the thread of life, another measures it, and the third cuts it.
Everything changes. It's just one more reason to maintain our standards. We Castithans owe our greatness to the strength and depth of our culture. And who created that culture? Old men who wrote it in stone a thousand years ago to keep you submissive.
What the hell are you doing? We've got to go! I rarely slept in prison. To help me rest, I imagined your face. I'm glad I left it unmarked.
Look up at the sky. Girl, look up. That's right, that's right. This thing isn't over yet. And you two may be the only ones who can stop it.
- What happened? - Bootsie pulled out his gun, and Darius picked up the gun I dropped and shot Bootsie. Darius Johnson is number three in Earl Franklin's organization. His fingerprints were found on the bullet casings, not Darius'. They gave me the gun and I loaded it, but I think Darius must have cleaned it.
Because your address was in his pocket. Yes, he came, but it was strange. Logan called me last week out of the blue. He was coming to town and wanted to mail me a small box. So if it was small, why didn't he take it on the plane?
At least, that's what he said. - But you didn't believe him. - When he came to pick you up, he acted very strangely. He realized that a ribbon was missing from the box and freaked out. I had to promise him that I hadn't opened it.
If there's evidence of his death, it's possible that it's in a format like this. - Yes, but we don't have it yet. - Don't we? Look. The tape must have torn when the killer pulled it.
How did Roger Mathers get it? Sam, these were your photos. That explains why your fingerprint was on the piece of photo we found near Roger Mathers' car. Did you give him the photo? No. And I have no idea how he got it.
He was a regular member of the Blue Diamond Shooting Club. Well, here we go. Gun residue is like paint, it sticks around. Maybe long enough to transfer to his hands when he picked it up last night. If the gun wasn't the murder weapon, then why did Berman have it in the first place?
It's all right. Don't look at me like that! I didn't start it. You forced me to do all these things. And then, when it's finally over, you take the last thing I gave you and use it to kill my brothers.
I'm going to find him. Hey, kid. They're waiting for you at the church. I'm looking for her bracelet. She always wore it and she didn't have it when...
Kid. They're waiting for you at the church. I'm looking for her bracelet. She always wore it and she didn't have it when... And you think she left it here?
We need to concentrate. How about jumping over the neighbor's fence and coming out on the other street? That would be great, except for the neighbor's pool. They have a pool? Why don't we use it?
If I leave, will you kill me? I won't leave. Hold your fire, soldiers. This is one of the most classified facilities on the planet. How did you find it?
What are you thinking, Steve? Dekker has been working with the ATF for a few months, correct? What if someone he helped put away found out about it, and used it against him? Okay, so Dekker gets false information about an arms deal, and he passes it on. They know he would pass it on.
Well, someone inside this prison has noticed. Two of our men are under arrest, and Marcus is dead. They tried to pin it all on you. The information came from a guy in my cellblock, goes by the name of Spider. He said he was giving me the information because he couldn't use it.
The problem with growing up like this is that you get good at spotting lies. So good that you start to expect it from everyone. So how do I know that what Harold told me was true? Because when he showed up, against all instincts, I gave him my trust. Somehow I knew he would never lose it.
There appears to be evidence of blunt trauma to the ascending ramus of the right mandible. The sunken collinear fracture is consistent with the impact of a blunt, curved object. Maybe you should try cannabis. I'll be fine. I would never recommend it for recreational purposes, as it's illegal, but rather medicinally, if pharmaceuticals are problematic.
Why would he lie to me? I've been using cannabis. Why would I lie about that? I don't want you to think it compromises my performance. I would never use it at work.
It will happen, as usual. So any servant can be Queen for a day? - I don't remember that tradition. - It's because we were children. I think my mother hid it from us for a while. My father welcomes the temporary Queen in his own way.
No, I've heard that song a billion times. My mom loves that song. It's called "Crystal Ball". I know what I'm talking about. Yeah, my mom loved it too.
Things have changed. Have they? Take a remote village, say 200 years ago. The inhabitants are showing strange symptoms. Dying, fear and superstition rule the day. And a curse is considered guilty until someone like you or me comes along and through a scientific process of elimination, tracks the disease to its source and destroys it.
I hate to ask you, but this is our family church. - Mom and Dad's... - No, Matt, it's your church. - They left it to you and me. - They didn't leave it to anyone.
Scripture tells us that the tongue is a restless evil full of deadly poison. It also says: "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor." It's been a month, Captain Simcoe. Where's that mythical Patriot petition you promised me? I still haven't found it.
What are you doing here? I heard some rumors and I couldn't believe they were true. Well, let me explain. Moses Paine delivered the petition supporting Selah to Congress. They're looking for the others who signed it.
These men betrayed our trust. These men planned assassinations. These men have conspired. What is the nature of conspiracy? What defines it?
Have you seen my son? Is he in the village? Let's take him inside. Are you going to burn your village now, Tallmadge? It's the king's men who are burning it, but have hope, because we'll catch them soon.
That piece sold for 30,000 dollars? Ours is bigger than that. Bingo! Wait, where's our piece? Where is it? Gene put it on our parents' bed.
- When was that? - In 1789. We have a letter from his mother. She heard about the storming of the Bastille and her son was in France. She wanted him to come home so much that she sent it by messenger.
This was the case for many years. Later, when it was discovered, the girl was expelled. She lost everything. The devil was tempting her. She faced his demons, they took her purity and drank her.
We say they're Sarah's. Is my wallet in your bag? The veterans were so worried that they sent her flowers. Half of them think her name is Sally. Shit, I think I left it in the cafeteria.
And in that bag that the person had chosen, and this is where slavery comes in, there could be nothing or there could be a kilo of gold. That was the moment when their independence was at stake. When a man first comes into contact with gold, he can't let go. I first saw this picture in a gallery over 20 years ago. I had no idea who had taken it.
What I do know... is that I'm Agent Mallory's only hope. And yours too. Please, I'm running out of time. First I want a written acquittal. - I don't have it in writing.
It's Bobby Symanski, my friend Pedro's grandson. - He's good. - Very good. I like that song. Grandpa wrote it.
Your hair looks nice. Hey. Have you seen my red backpack? Molly? What do you want it for?
- There's no doubt that we have to make history. - She's an educated idiot. - When did you change your mind? - I didn't change my mind. I knew we had to do the story the moment he showed it to us.
Good luck with that. I think you're scaring him. How will your boss react to you giving up on a story? And then another story? Whatever the second story is, I'm not going to blackmail him into giving it to me.
Because Bieber signed the guest book on the way out and wrote, "Hopefully she would have been a Belieber." And then you and Elliot got drunk and you said you'd give him $100 if he could read the story on the dot without laughing. Once again, this is the new HR rep for our parent company. The copy should have been given to me, but Gary gave it to Stacey. Once I gave it to Gary, Gary had to make that decision.
No. 2,000 journalists and he thought he was going to get away with it? He didn't rob any banks. He sang that song about the bullshit that was the Correspondents' Dinner, and said that ACN wouldn't be there, and then he shows up. You didn't know anything about it until I told you about it. That story was waiting and ready to come out and I was the one who released it.
Joseph Bartho and the Joseph Bartho Family Singers are away. They are on their way to France via 14 air connections and a pair of oxen. So we're broadcasting the story tonight. You can't. I'm sorry, but there's no way you can broadcast it.
I have something valuable; a comic book, "Spider-Man vs Doctor Octopus", number three from 1963, in great condition. It's worth five thousand dollars. I swapped an American soccer for the comic when I was 9 and my dad got mad because the ball was signed by Dan Marino. I told him: "Get Rita Morino to sign it and I'll keep it."
All you have to do is wait. You're Private Dunlavey, right? Don't pretend you know anything about me just because you put a bullet in my father's mathematician's head. Right, the camera. - You didn't turn it on?
Jo, I think she either knew the killer and let him in or the person was waiting for her when she came back into the room. There was no sign of forced entry. - So who had the key? - There was only one key, according to the hotel, and it was Annabel's. Had she lost it?
He'll never have a happy day, because he doesn't have a shred of kindness in him. What were you doing in York? Let me think about it. I sent a letter to a comrade in the army. - Would he still have it?
But we have a concert and we have to play. There were a few times when we took acid, tried to play and couldn't make sense of it. We gave up and left. But then we'd get back together and play like demons. We'd pick up a song and, in the end, instead of finishing it, we'd go on longer.
- The DEA stayed out of the investigation. We lost the money. Everything. Would you like a hug? I'm giving you a story. If you don't want it, I'll find another journalist who does.
I can't hold you all night. And for the next five minutes? All right, look for anything out of place. We have to find the secret passage. Well, if we find it, it's not so secret, is it?
All right, the little man is on fire! But the question is: what's fueling the fire? His neural network has been programmed with basic Japanese. Yes, but that doesn't even come close to explaining it. Linguistically, it's like saying that Ethan had a ladder and used it to get to the moon.
No! No! I'll need your badge number. - You have the right to remain silent. - Keep recording, keep recording. The cape, when he wears it, he looks different.
I'm looking forward to hearing your story. But I don't have a story. - I was lying. - Lying? People share information faster if they think the other person already has it.
I don't remember. Does that mean you could have sung? Yes. - Do you often sing about this subject? So often that you can't remember whether or not you sang it that day?
In the previous episodes... I'm giving you a story. If you don't want it, I'll find another idiot who does.
Garvey picks up her bag, looks inside and there's no gun! - I don't understand. - Why is that important? Because she's lying. It wasn't in her bag, but she still has it.
- Where are you going? I'm going to find the witch. Looks like I need to teach her what she can and can't do in my town. The stake is safe. Davina won't use it if she can kill me.
It requires charm and personality. You wouldn't understand anything about this. Our mother wants answers, if you don't get them, we'll do it my way. Are you going to nag her until she can't help telling you everything? If you want to find out if someone has a gun, you provoke them until they use it.
You wouldn't understand anything about this. Our mother wants answers, if you don't get them, we'll do it my way. Are you going to nag her until she can't help telling you everything? If you want to find out if someone has a gun, you provoke them until they use it. - I never said I had one.
Let's go! Mr. Hunston, drop the gun! Now! That's the gun that killed Jeremy Geist, isn't it? The gun and the man who used it.
They can't decode it. They think it's a single-use cipher. What does that mean? It's a code made with a key. The person who encodes the message has the key, as does the person who decodes it.
Her CIA medal? That's absurd. - Those are earned on merit. - Yes. I won it in Operation Basra. He claims I lost it in the move.
It's strange. In the world of thieves, the Panthers are royalty. There's no one better, before or since. That's why I risked my life to join you. And I almost lost it.
And they get dry. Very, very dry, so I have to apply a lot of cream. And I know this sounds ridiculous, but my finger must have slipped on the keyboard, and I pressed the wrong action. Are you saying you didn't even want to buy that stock? No, but then it skyrocketed. And I wasn't going to tell everyone that I only bought it because I have dry skin.
It's time to use it. You told me what I wanted to hear so I'd be on your side. You're just like them. You're wrong. I looked you in the eye and said I wanted to save the company. - They told me they want to destroy it.
Tell me what happens now. In the middle of the 21st century, humanity begins to reach for the stars. It is spreading across the galaxy to the far reaches of the Universe. And that will last until the end of time. And it manages to do all this because, one day in 2049, when it had stopped thinking about reaching the stars, something happened that made it look up, not down.
We all have them, including my father. "Malum" means "bad", but it also means "apple". And I believe the phrase to be read is: "The apple opens." And consequently releases the death that follows. I believe I've seen that apple. Or the box that contains it.
Well, what wave does our dead teacher's marijuana produce? It's this one. Unfortunately, it doesn't match any of Lloyd's strains. Didn't Allison Ball buy her marijuana from Lloyd's dispensary? Well, that makes me wonder where she got it.
Don't be ungrateful. I thank your mother every day for leaving us the house. When you own property, you have choices. What should we do? After he leaves, we'll ask for time off together, go there, see what state he's left it in and then make plans.
I read that they've invented a way of converting your steps into electromagnetic energy so that you can charge your phone while you walk. We had that idea years ago. Why have we never used it?
A week ago. Did you check your personal weapon too? Yes, I left mine with the field officer. But on the pitch, in the changing room... They're all policemen. If someone changed their gun and replaced it in your locker, you'd never know.
Because my diplomat brother thinks the people want to hear it. People are following Ihab Rashid because he gave them a voice. How can we expect them to follow you? Your tongue is your horse. If you let it free, it will betray you.
That's how you define it, right? I'm really sorry. You intend to keep that star, right? Yes. The Dome didn't treat those who used it very well.
- What do you know about the egg? - I used to work for Barbie's father at Aktaion. That egg has been the subject of many meetings. I'd say our best tool would be a sound wave detector. All energy sources emit a frequency, even if we can't hear it.
They've certainly crossed a lot of borders since then. It's almost as if they're demanding our involvement in this. They wouldn't be the first to intentionally make us part of their plans. Yes, but we got a lot of publicity. It's common knowledge that this strategy hasn't worked for those who have used it.
He was with Odin, at John's house. - With John? - No, they were alone until I arrived. Listen, I know you like this guy... Maybe Ethan needed a recharge and he didn't change it for fear of hurting him.
- the masseuse in question. - That's good. Very good. Can I see your tongue? Where do you want it?
It drove my parents crazy, but... Grandma thought it was adorable. Are you all right? Last night my printer turned itself on. I couldn't turn it off.
Sorry, love, we'll talk about this later. Kira! You were my Beta first, Scott. It was my bite that changed your life. And it's my bite that could end it.
That bottle of wine, you said it was delivered? From the wine store. It came with a ribbon and a thank you card, with no name. I don't understand. What does that have to do with... - Do you know when it was delivered? - Around 16:00.
Get rid of that show-off! I won't let him ruin my career! But you can't leave the temple. It's your duty as Guardian to... To do what? Have you noticed how big this thing is? Are you afraid it'll be stolen while you're away?
For an ex-cop, the guy lived like a monk. Just like Anton, who is part of our problem. The boy didn't have a cell phone or credit cards for us to track. There has to be a connection between them. I'm just not finding it.
Jason said he was staying here - because his mother was out of town. - So? Natalie, the camera case you put the envelope in, is it a Polaroid camera? How do you know that? Because Jason took it to the Kennedy School yesterday to show the class.
Yes. It smells bad, but it makes your throat water. Are you a spy for the British or the French? How many times do I have to answer the same question? I swear this is the last time I'll ask it.
Are you OK? The proposals for the water desalination plant have arrived. Let me guess, they're too high. Because they know you have oil. Tell them that either they lower their bids or we'll accept one, let them build it and then nationalize it and send them away.
Remember, it's not just a man we're looking for. There's also a woman involved here in some way. If they form a team, the woman could be the one who drugs the girls. What about that drug? Has the S.I.D. identified it yet?
Callie will love that bracelet. But I hope you know that she doesn't need consoling for not being adopted or anything else, with a special gift. She loves you. And you're special enough. I beg your pardon? I was looking at this bracelet yesterday, and I think I put it in my pocket and forgot to pay for it.
But when I do, I want a more concrete answer than "I don't know". How long has this gun been missing? A day ago. Maybe two, one of the janitors didn't come to work this morning. He must have taken it.
I've got her in my sights. I've got a good aim now. Got it. Shoot whenever you want. Nice rifle. Too bad you left it unattended.
Very good. This place is 30 minutes outside New York. It's a top-secret research center belonging to the ENR, the National Reconnaissance Office... The highest technology, involving 16 government intelligence agencies. They developed this weapon. Who's going to carry it?
- Obviously. If you steal the gun, you know you'll be behind bars for the rest of your life. - Obviously not. - And if you succeed? You know what kind of man Burton will sell it to.
Did you talk to Tully? Yes. How did the Asians steal your heroin? Technically, the heroin was already theirs. They just took it back.
Will you shut the fuck up, please? Seriously, I have type 1 diabetes. You're full of shit. I should have taken my insulin. I didn't take it today.
An artisan cheese store has just opened next door. All the buildings in this neighborhood were built 200 years ago. They have a great structure. Don't you think they ooze personality? That piece we were looking for to harmonize the room, I think I've found it.
That piece we were looking for to harmonize the living room, I think I've found it. No, not for that house... For the one in the Hamptons. Isn't it perfect? No, I know it's not elegant, but if we paint it and then strip it to give it that rustic look...
You, and your father. I know you're grieving. But so am I. I didn't show Sara the darkness, Laurel. She already had it when we met.
- No. Calm down, please. - The wall doesn't hurt anyone. - We've been through this before. I'm not worried about the wall, I'm worried about who made it.
I'll give you a week and then I'll tell you. Have a good trip. I've got your number. Thanks a lot, Mom. And this beautiful face. What am I going to do when I can't see her every day?
We're not sure yet, Frank. I'm just saying that you could have let that guy go. We caught him red-handed robbing a grocery store. Do you really think we should arrest him for stealing a fucking loaf of bread? We don't make the law, Eddie, we just enforce it.
A hacker wants to take over the city, and I'm worried about you. I can still worry, can't I? Yes, you can. And if you really need to, you can even be critical from time to time. Someone recently told me that family is very precious. And, despite everything, it's love that makes it precious.
Your tracker is running. Take an hour, go talk to your mother. I have nothing to say to her. Earlier today, Thea told me that she had to put up with me because family is precious. And it's love, more than anything, that makes it precious.
Cows? Do they have milk? Milk, butter, yogurt. And most importantly for you, penicillin. Amy makes it.
Auggie, maybe you don't know her like you used to. She hides things from you. She disappeared for months. I mean, what kind of friend does that? The kind of friend who needs some privacy and knows that I wouldn't judge her.
I'm sorry, I just... I didn't mean to disturb you. My mother used to sing it to me when I was a child. All my life, she sang it to me. I hadn't heard it for a while, and I...
This is you... entering the school library at 1:16pm. The same day that Chet Messner was killed. And at 1:19 p.m., you logged into the computer using Hannah Hunt's password. She accessed VidTree, and sent a message to Rob Turkla. Telling him where to find the answer sheet, but it was Messner who found it.
We caught Cole Marshak. He was hunting squirrels. I didn't even know his brother had been arrested. It seems that he and his clan are cannon fodder and not instigators. They'd join a war, but they wouldn't start it.
They don't look like volunteers to me. Millions are dying for no reason. These men will die to help find a vaccine. If it works, one of them could save us all. - Well, why don't you take it, then?
But I know an Idris. I can't stand his mother. She'd come to our tea parties, fill a napkin with sweets and leave. Once, he stole a towel. And she says she only took it because her son had a louse.
It's fascinating, isn't it? If I had another use for it, - that would be cool. - Bicycle brake. I like where your head is. This motorized tourniquet does indeed serve to keep the bike secure, but then you'll never move it again, at least not easily.
I shot Thied. You must have a hunch that an Intelligence bigwig was behind it, which means you wanted an Intelligence advantage. So why didn't you stop me? Because I don't have your Phantom infiltration key. No organization will ever have it.
Nothing, except his horrible handwriting. And strangely enough, there's a man on the list who signs exactly the same way. "J. Elroy". He requested the 1947 edition of the Los Angeles Times this morning at 09:40. He hasn't returned it yet.
I know this has nothing to do with the role you decide to play in your child's life... Maybe it should. Those closest to us... Even here, at court, will know the truth. Your mother has already guessed it.
- He'd kill me in a heartbeat. - He killed a Cardinal! I could force him. To reveal information said in holy confession? The Vatican itself can't hear it.
You could panic and kill Sophie. Thanks, Jerry. Look, I appreciate the help, but you didn't have to stay. Are you kidding me? Research is my superpower. By the way, I think I ruined Captain America's printer. I'm pretty sure he never used it either.
Explain to our viewers why this is important. It's important because people understood that the law under which this was done, which is the Patriot Act, passed after 9/11, was a law that gave the government very broad powers to get records on people with a lower level of suspicion than probable cause, the traditional level. It was always assumed that under the Patriot Act, if the government had any suspicion that you were involved in a crime or terrorism, it could get lots of information about you. What this court order does that makes it so surprising, is that it's not targeting any individuals that they believe or have a suspicion of committing crimes or belonging to terrorist organizations, it's collecting the phone records of absolutely every customer
- Which is more than you'll get. I can't make any promises about who will or won't survive. You know... you were wrong. That you needed a bargaining chip to get what you want? No, I didn't have one.
This house is very beautiful. - When did you buy it? - About a month or so ago. No, it's longer than that, remember? We met two months ago and you already had it.
He thought it was his duty to take care of me. Every toothache, holiday, the birth of my daughter... Hawk was there. Do you know where he got your father's license plate? I didn't know he had it.
I've come to say goodbye. Who knows... it could be another 15 years before we see each other again. Take care, Erin. The recording. You haven't seen it, have you?
I heard he went to work the day after his son died. Is he a trustworthy man? I can't say. Olinsky should know. He's setting up an intervention team and wants me to lead it.
Shit happens. You're late! Just in time, boss. They come in here, kick our asses and take the device that can change the global balance of power. How do we get it back?
I know that very well. No matter how much you don't want to, the dead remain silent. Good evening, Jakob. Your father tells me you have her talent. What would she say if she knew you weren't using it?
The sword can only be taken away by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir. You felt it, didn't you? The power. It's what made you faint. You just don't know how to control it.
You and I have a lot more in common than you might think. We not only share the same blood, but also the same interests. We've both developed a taste for power. I've never had any power. Or any desire to achieve it.
Ironic, really. Ironic? Yes. I did it in prison. Were you looking for the keys? I needed to work on the barn. I needed to open it.
The FBI is here. Why don't you talk to them? If I let the FBI handle this, I'll never see you again. I'm sorry, but when you launder money for the most corrupt dictators, these things happen. I hid the money. I was going to give it to the FBI, but they took my daughter before I handed it over.
If we wanted to arrest him. I'm just saying. He's a suspect in the Valecross murder. No, it's a chance to get the money back. As soon as he has it, I'll be there.
What is law number five? LAW 5 A lot depends on your reputation. Guard it with your life. Understand? We are our reputation, so now I'd say it's pretty clear that we're... The thing about power is when you don't have it, it's with someone else.
We robbed everyone. Stores, businesses... neighbors, family... Friends were just another class of victim. In the morning, when you disappeared with my money, I was furious, but I also thought: "Of course he took it."
What about this boy? What about him? Would you judge him? He's a child. But you've already judged him.
You can't keep it. What's that? You can't have it! I didn't write it for you. I'm going to give it to the person I wrote it for and you can suck on it, understand?
Wait a minute. Fuck! Don't move. Outside my living room, I found the 1971 championship bat in the garbage can. I want to know who put it there and why.
And words are... Useless. Apparently. Guys, you try to be nice, right? And treat everyone with respect, but you don't get it.
Useless. Apparently. Guys, you try to be nice, right? And treat everyone with respect, but you don't get it. You don't get it in return.
What the fuck! Get your fucking foot out of the car! Yes, sir. The foot will come off now. But before you take it off, let me explain something.
I just want to know if it's true. And if it is true? I don't know who she's talking about! Where's your ring, Julia? Why haven't you been wearing it?
I don't know who she's talking about! Where's your ring, Julia? Why haven't you been wearing it? Nowhere. I took it off to have a bath the other day... and I thought I knew where I'd put it.
- "Back on dry land." - To. - "Free as a bird." - Complaints. It's serious business, Sherlock. I know that. Why do you think I don't take it seriously?
Absolutely. What about Muerte? I'm working on that right now. We're going to give him the money. But he won't be able to spend it.
Did you get the certificate? I hate this place, man. So depressing. Did you get the certificate? No, I didn't get it.
I've made millions. For me, for people at this table, for millions of people I don't even know. I support charities that wouldn't even exist without me! If life is a balance sheet, and I believe it is, you owe me. But there is a situation here that needs to be addressed. I have a problem and there's only one way to solve it.
- Okay, Dr. Watson. - Dr. Watson. - I love his blog. - His blog? - Don't you read it?
- Hello? Are you still there? - Yes, give us a minute! We have to get the plane away from populated areas. - It has to crash into the sea. - What about the girl? It's obvious, Dr. Watson, that she's the one who's going to crash it.
That's right. You shoot tasers in your face? It's metaphorical! What's the point? It's a name that expresses fear in the hearts of those who hear it!
The word spreads, and he comes for you with that thing. I told Katie. I didn't want to. What do you do with cancer but cut it out? You have to stop it before it spreads and kills everything.
I told Katie. I didn't want to. What do you do with cancer but cut it out? You have to stop it before it spreads and kills everything. It'll spread everywhere if we don't cut it out.
Did you report your car stolen? He didn't press charges. I would have known. The car is gone. We haven't found it.
- Isn't that your job? - Yes, as long as someone reports it stolen. It's as good a time as any. He doesn't know where the car is. He hasn't seen it for a few days, so there's a good chance it's been stolen. Stolen.
Feel better? Why are you always against me, Frank? Let's go to my office. They did a lousy job fixing that car. They have to fix it, and we won't pay them until they do!
Did you report your car stolen? No, he didn't report it. I would have known. His car is gone. We haven't seen it.
Isn't that any of your business? Yes, it is, as soon as someone reports it stolen. Well, I guess this is as good a time as any. He doesn't know where the car is. He hasn't seen it for a few days, so yes, there's a strong possibility that it's been stolen.
He doesn't know where the car is. He hasn't seen it for a few days, so yes, there's a strong possibility that it's been stolen. Stolen. Okay, so, Mr. Jones, where did you leave your car last time? Well, if we knew that, we'd know where to find it, wouldn't we?
It's a fucking morgue! This way. Fucking picky. AROUND THE DINNER TABLE, THE CONVERSATION IS LIVELY. Detective Macklay handled the case when we received it.
I had to check it myself. E? It won't be a problem. We have an agreement. You have to honor it properly or there will be consequences.
I've lived long enough to see the world change in many ways. But this change seems significant. The Devil of Hell's Kitchen. The man with impenetrable skin. And now an immortal weapon has left K'un-Lun not to fulfill his duty, but to neglect it.
- You have to take points. - Airport? We're going home. No. The road to K'un-Lun is open and you're not there to protect it.
Help us use the diamond to solve the mystery of Magadha's treasure. What's so special about this diamond? Could Jiang Wen explain it to you in Chinese? It's my pleasure. Eye of Shiva Whoever possesses it will possess the whole world.
She will find her peace. I pray that you find yours too. You've always loved this place. It's a miracle that this park even exists. The fact that this city didn't destroy it to build skyscrapers.
I'll take care of it. How can you be so hungry? Summoning my chi takes a lot of energy. What's wrong? Come on, you've seen it in action.
A car that is currently in our inventory. So we're giving up everything for a car? Not just any car. It's John Wick's car. So why don't we give it back?
It's not too late. You're beautiful. The ranch has been in my family for four generations. Stella, it's a dirty business. If JT couldn't save it, how are you going to save it alone?
- Did you sleep well? - Yes. This is a beautiful boat. It's from my shipyard in Seattle. - Did you build it?
He hasn't done anything yet. To stop him, we need to turn off the second device. It's under the control panel in the main building. We have to do that. We have to attack it from a central point.
You can't pay, I'll take the car. - I just need a few more days. - That wasn't part of the deal. Well? You make a deal, you have to keep it.
Really. Put it down right there. What are you doing? The engine is misfiring. I have to check it.
What's the matter, Roman? Did you forget your snow tires? Are you loving that Lamborghini already? Listen up, everyone, we'll deal with the launch chip later. Right now, I want the submarine in deep water where no one can find it.
- This can't be good... - His record is clean. Full reinstatement. You've got your job back. That is, if you want it.
Well, it's a small stretch of coastline directly on the other side of the world, where your father had an agreement with the Nootka tribe. A desert. If America were a pig, looking at it from England, it's right up the pig's ass. Just boulders and Indians. The territory in your father's will, as well as being useless, is dangerous for those who own it.
Let's see, he's back. And according to Delaney's will, he inherits everything. Including the island of Nootka. Do we still have a copy of the Treaty of the Strait of Nootka? Where perhaps our lawyers can discredit it?
Why is that? It's a good question. Why would I feel this way about him, even though I've only seen him once? The son of the same father as the woman I love so much... Why does a soldier know that a black man who bows down has a dagger hidden in his shoe and that he's going to use it?
- Oh, come on. - Come on, boss. Finish him off, finish him off. Come on, come on. You hurt my arm when you forced it here.
- Come on, boss. Finish him off, finish him off. Come on, come on. You hurt my arm when you forced him here. But it really hurt when you forced it here.
We have a problem. Someone leaked your report. The Washington Post has a copy. No. - Someone gave it to Bob Woodward.
Get the money! Yes, money. I don't really have any. What do you mean, concretely? It means you don't have it.
Money. I don't really have any. What do you mean, concretely? You mean you don't have it. Then why don't you just say you don't have it.
Frank! I love you! I love you. No. I didn't buy it from him.
He could stop them. The Nazis lost the war. Why is he still obsessed? What did he want an army for? He didn't want it for them.
His mother conjured him. To fill the void she felt after the Wild Hunt passed through Canaan. Mother... What if Sheriff Stilinski is filling the void? What if he's filling it with Claudia?
Lucas, stop. Lucas, stop! Stop, Lucas! Stop, Lucas! We would have lived for a year on the money from the sale of the dagger. Why did she have it?
We would have lived for a year on the money from the sale of the dagger. Why did she have it? I don't know. She never said anything to me. But if I took it, it would have been a part of her that followed me around.
Lucas, stop. Lucas, stop! Stop, Lucas! Stop, Lucas! We would have lived for a year on the money from the sale of the dagger. Why did she have it? I don't know.
Stop it! We would have lived for a year on the money from the sale of the dagger. Why did she have it? I don't know. She never said anything to me. But if I took it, it would have been a part of her that followed me around.
I want you to take Elizabeth's place as head of the Supreme Council. - If that's your wish. - Sir? Dorothy's meeting with the soldier. - Did it reveal anything new? - You know I wouldn't.
I'm suggesting that we help each other by making an alliance between pirates and slaves, overthrowing Nassau, perhaps destroying it completely. My name is Woodes Rogers, and I am the next Governor of New Providence Island. Spain... What did you promise them? That you would protect the rest of Urca de Lima's gold and transport it to Havana.
- She did it. How much? A chest of precious stones. Spain is willing to overthrow Nassau. The only way Rogers can prevent it from happening is to find the money and return it, which would mean that if we found it first, we could demand what would happen next.
But do we need you here? No, we don't. You're forgetting something. Somewhere on an island a few days' journey from here, there is a chest with treasure buried in a secret place and of the three men who know where it is, I may be the last one alive today. You threaten to withhold the location of the chest that all the men are counting on for Nassau's treasure as soon as we secure it,
That cute guy sitting next to us is completely crazy. He was telling me about a movie that supposedly kills people. What movie? Some video. A girl calls him after he's seen it and says: "Seven days".
I don't think so... It's far from being the most respectable industry there has ever been. In the long term, I'm doing my website. I want to keep doing it... ARTIST ... but if something else comes along, that would be cool too, but... But I want to hire people to do it for me, so I don't have to. Do you understand?
Am I going to be a waitress? I don't know. It really is a strange phase in my life. I'm trying to understand and move on to the next step. I have to have the courage to do it.
Well, I'm going to defend the school. But you're the mother of a student. I think that's one of the reasons the partners gave me the case. So you're going to try to prove that Hannah wasn't bullied. The school's position is that they didn't know about the bullying and that they would have stopped it if they had known.
We rely on connections to survive. Even the most basic social interactions help keep us alive. Statistics prove that the subjective feeling of loneliness can increase the likelihood of premature death by 26 percent. If it sounds like I'm reading from a textbook, it's true. It's just a shame no one bothered to read it.
What can I do for you? You say that the school didn't know my daughter wanted to kill herself, but published a poem in the school newspaper that says how she was feeling. Wait a minute. This publication is not approved by the school. It's an independent art project by the students. It's distributed on campus. The teachers analyzed this poem in class, when they should have been trying to help the child who wrote it.
I wanted to ask you a question about this poem. Do you remember where it came from? They put it in my locker last year. I thought it was well written. So you didn't find it on campus.
So you didn't find him on campus. Isn't that the premise of the magazine? Sometimes they send me anonymous texts. Why do you ask? It looks like Hannah Baker wrote it.
Yes, I know. I mean... I don't know, maybe I could call him and explain. Explain what? He wants money and we don't have it.
He resisted... At first. But then I told him what else I had learned about this place. I was told that illustrious families from London society made use of it. I was told that the governor of Carolina made use of it. So I sent a man to find out if it had been used to hide a particular prisoner.
I understand. I know how difficult it is to accept change, to join the right team. But I believe you understand one thing. I don't invite just anyone. And when I do, you can be sure, I don't invite them lightly.
Your mother said he was looking for a well. The tractor must have stopped, he went under it, the engine started and trapped him. He wouldn't take a tractor to Dylan's Ditch. Emma, his blood alcohol level was very high. I begged the doctor not to put it on the report.
The place was full of drugs. Your belt was on his bed. I lost that belt. Weeks ago. Where? If I'd known that, Ingrid, I wouldn't have lost it.
And she just told you everything, right? No, but... she's been having an affair with him for several years, and it would be bad for her if her husband found out. I see. You're... you're really angry with everyone, aren't you? I gave my life to that job, I want to know why I lost it!
Between the ribs. Yes. Higher up. I'm going to miss this plaster. But you never asked me to sign it.
Now. I'm ready. Let's kill each other like good brothers. - What about the serum? - I've just given it to your wife.
- No way. - Then let's hide it. Where? Outside. Nobody knows we have it.
Just do it. Madame President-elect... So what do you think I should do? - I beg your pardon? - Welcome terrorism - and the states that support it.
- Just a second, sir. How did you get this address? Through e-mail. What e-mail? Who sent it?
That's not true. He was running towards a fallen comrade to save his life. That act, which was attested to by six soldiers who were right there... That act cost my son his life AND earned him a silver star. Whoever made this video is not only trying to undo that and ruin him personally, but to damage my presidency. I invite the real cowards, the people who did it, to come out of the shadows and show their faces.
Where is it? Nowhere. You deleted it from your phone. Did you... Did you send it somewhere? How could I, if I never did?
So here I am. You know it's not defamation if it's true? It's not true. It's not true. Have you seen him?
- Really? Yes. Managed from this studio. You didn't just produce the fake video. You falsified the hatred and lies that accompanied it.
Did you read it? Kevin left it in the bathroom, I picked it up and before I knew it 20 minutes had passed. It's exciting. Have a nice day. I didn't leave him in the bathroom.
Yes. Is the machine here in this building? No, it's not here. I'd be happy to answer any other questions you have about the device, technical or otherwise. Why didn't you use it?
We'll be back. But there's one man, a very special man, and he should be here with us, but he's in Melbourne. And because of this unexpected event, he got stuck in Australia. He's been stranded. God has put an obstacle in our way, but he wants us to overcome it.
- Please, Laurie. It's in your best interests not to be involved. Whatever you have to tell us, you can also tell her. No one seems to care that I witnessed a murder. The man who committed it attacked me.
Tell her she's making this up, Mom! It doesn't exist. Yes, it does! I remember it! There was a mannequin with a hat that brought him back to life and there was a goose on a rainbow and a scary doll that worked in, like, a store?
I have a problem. It was never diagnosed. A few years ago, I had a heart attack. Pretty bad. But if they hadn't diagnosed the problem, I wouldn't have known I had it and blah blah blah, so...
You didn't see what I saw on the Underhill estate. There has been untold and indescribable suffering on this island as a result of Billy's actions. Any trust that may have existed between the slaves here and our alliance is gone. This enterprise is on the brink of collapse and cannot withstand a fight with the Governor's men. What price could be too high to stop it?
What price could be too high to stop it? Drastic measures will have to be taken, of which this, I'm afraid, will be only the first. What does that mean? The damage done to this alliance was caused by Billy. It may be that the only way to repair this damage is to remove what caused it.
Everyone assumed that he had changed sides, that one of you had convinced him to change, but that's not what happened, is it? No, it didn't. How long was he helping them in secret? He started, he said, after the Spanish attack. And did he say why he did it?
How long does it take for the technician to come and disarm the pump? About 20 minutes. That's too long. I'll send you a photo of the device. There's not much light down there, but I think I've got it.
- Andy? - She's right. Pang's no fool. I'm hurrying, but I need more time. I don't think you'll have it.
There was a revolt. A man called Julius started it. Now he's forming an army with the intention of taking Nassau. The damage done to this alliance was caused by Billy. It may be that the only way to repair this damage is to remove the one who caused it.
If you had suffered such losses, would you be able to imagine anything that would put them right? No. I wouldn't. But I imagine that laying hands on the man responsible for it could be a start. He completed the attack when my friends tried to prevent it.
Of course I love her. I let you try it your way! I trusted you. But no more gambling with her life. If what it takes to secure her release is to hand over the treasure, then I'm glad I brought it.
And that one day, she would come to me... And a woman, who would remind me of myself when I was young, would arrive in Boston. And I would walk the Charles with her, teaching her the things a woman can do in this world. It's the wrong river and the wrong woman, but getting that close to a fantasy might be something. So let's assume that we've gotten past talking about tax books and pondering about you and your proposal is finished and we're partners in a venture to acquire and reform Nassau. So now all that's left to know about this venture is who will lead it.
Shut up. I'll do the talking. My friend's cell phone was stolen. Did someone sell him a cell phone today? We'll never find it again!
- I'm sure it occurs to you. - It occurs to me. - The what? - The package. - You swore you hadn't opened it!
Have we ever pressured you to study law? Did we tell you anything? No. We told you it was a personal decision. If you started law school, you have to finish it.
We have a TV, a fridge. You have a laptop. These are things that poor people have. - We have air conditioning. - You never let it turn on.
She has seven wins and zero losses. She's just beaten a Brazilian. She opened her face. It was crazy. Anyway, she stole my car and said it was because I deserved it or something.
You can't steal his car. Is that what he told you? That I stole your car? He showed up here last night drunk. As a precaution, he wanted me to keep the car because he thought he'd throw it off a cliff.
The most important thing when you start shaping a pot is to make sure the clay is in the exact center of your wheel, then you throw it firmly. Ooh! Stop laughing already! How is poor Nurse Gilbert going to make a pretty pot if she can't concentrate because of all that noise? Then they need to smooth it - oh, dear - into a conical shape.
You're looking at what's behind him. I'm trying to isolate the car that was following him. There are too many times for it to be a coincidence. I agree. Now I just have to find out who was driving it.
You don't buy a 4-carat diamond for a friend. 4 carats. That's a very expensive ring. Do you know if Helga really got the ring? I hope you're lucky enough to find out if she did.
He's out there looking for a place for him and his father to build a luxury resort. Wait a minute, his father is David Hitchcock, a big real estate developer. No wonder he has an idiot son. I know. Whenever I see Hitchcock's name, my brain immediately turns it into Rico...
But you know better than anyone what a dangerous and perverse place the world can become. And the barrier that protects us from this is sometimes more fragile than it seems. When evil raises its repulsive head, it is my duty to protect Corona against it. And one day, that will be your responsibility. And I have to teach you how to do it.
And scared people will do things you wouldn't believe. Who's there? Who are you? Someone who's been doing this a lot longer than you, but also someone who recognizes pure talent when he sees it.
Yes, Rip started us off. Do you remember his speech? I know I don't. You were too busy talking shit. Of course I remember it. You just repeated it.
And you'll pay for it. You didn't mention my garden. Your garden is part of your yard, so it's included in the property that goes to Jenn. It comes with the house, Mom. I think you need to mention it in case some corrupt judge decides to use trickery.
I can't wait another four years. This should only have been a week. Poseidon left us here to die. We still have a trump card up our sleeve. I didn't want to use it, but I've already played it.
Okay, but food first. You're not going to feed me, Jimmy. There are limits we don't cross. I looked at the office lease. We'd lose money if we terminated it.
- I'm fine. What friend? - He's at Patrick's. What happened to your grandmother's ring? I'm such an idiot... I took it off on the way there because I didn't want it stolen and when I looked for it on the way back here, I couldn't find it.
Remember? When Clary and I were kids, you brought us here. We roasted marshmallows. Clary got one stuck in her hair. Jocelyn had to cut it off.
What happened? Alec... They took my spell book. - Are you raising your barriers? - No one leaves here until I get it back.
It's too pathetic. It's like a real The Fault in the Stars. That's not the story of the book. - Is it? - No. I've never read it.
- He knows, Ray. Yeah. Well, did you find anything? I carbon dated the amulet Sara took from Darhk in 1987. Before she returned it to the Legion of Doom, I suppose.
For Shadow, it was. There's no time for nostalgia. I know where they're going. Does anyone know anything about this place that could put us at an advantage? I've only seen it once, from a distance.
Yes, and I took a mental health day. It's like sick leave, but people are afraid to ask what's wrong. - Do you get unemployment benefits? - No. I tried to claim it, but to get it you had to have had a job.
Yes. Sorry. Have a good time. I have to go talk to Andy about AA stuff. Do you want to interrupt the episode or is it annoying for people? I think we'll let you get on with it, but come back as soon as you can.
Did you see what Gus sent? No. I thought they were from Randy, but they're from Gus. It's a bunch of flowers. - There's a card, if you want to read it.
I don't want to say "no" to Victor, but it's... You know him, is there any way I can solve this? How about this? Tell him you're interested in the project. And that you want to do it via Skype.
How are you? - I almost died today. - What happened? Are you okay? - A car hit my cart while I was pushing it.
If that's all, I've got a lot of work to do. I'll keep you updated on the status of this investigation. I wouldn't panic, we don't know if the report is true. I think we can say that it is. The question is: who sent it to Pike?
I could use a clue. - I think I've found something. - I summoned this. What was it? When my scream hit it, it broke a piece of the visor.
- I can leave tonight. - Thank you very much. But only after I show you an incredible Indian restaurant. - My favorite. - Why do you think I chose it?
Assuming they went together. None of this makes sense. How could they create a Portal inside the Institute? Clearly, it wasn't a normal Portal. Whatever it was, there was something strange about it so that the barriers wouldn't recognize it.
Jace? Is he all right? Where is he? I can only put you on the right path. - You have to do it alone.
They have it at the Institute. It's well guarded, I presume? Only the Elite Guard knows where it is. It's safer that way. Jonathan went after Elliot and Dot to get the Mirror. He knows we have it, so he'll come back for it. I agree.
- Are you all right? - Yes. Did he take the Mirror? No. And no one else will use it to destroy the World Apart.
I'm not so sure. Even with our pure angel blood, isn't it strange that Clary's runes can destroy a Mortal Instrument? And why didn't they destroy the Sword? What if the mirror I destroyed wasn't the Mortal Mirror? Why would your mother give it to the wizards to protect?
What if the mirror I destroyed wasn't the Mortal Mirror? Why would your mother give it to the wizards to protect? Maybe she thought it was. We all did. Maybe that was the aim of whoever created it.
We'll make them pay for what they've done. We'll make them pay for everything. Have you notified the Verlac family? The Penhallow daughter, Aline, will deliver the message personally, Madam Inquisitor. Using the body of a dead soldier to turn it into a trap is unfortunately typical of Valentine, isn't it?
You may know how to fool others, but I know you, Jeannie. I'm not trying to fool anyone. Imagine if you had to live in that one-bedroom apartment. I like that apartment. I know, I'm still paying for it.
I'm decorating. Look at this place. - Are you decorating the lab? - Decorating the lab. Because Francisco won't let me decorate his cortex, because I've made him look too cheerful for Christmas.
He doesn't deserve this. Let me guess. Do you? I know what my hell is. I've seen it in the future.
Well, everything remains the same. The future hasn't changed. Well, we have two months to make sure it does. We should approach this like any other problem. Starting with what we already know. We'll only solve it if we understand the problem.
You. All of you. Love is all we have in the world. Without it, nothing matters. And who knows what we would become if we didn't have it?
How was Earth 3? Spending time with Jesse was incredible. Love is all we have in the world. Without it, nothing matters. And who knows what we'd become if we didn't have it?
Stefan, I know I've been hard on you. But I know that you and I are ready to do something about it. I'm sure you are. Why is that? Have you discovered something? I think so. It's if she's in Hell when I destroy it.
it's only 11 km away. What's the beauty of these tunnels. to the center of Mystic Falls? do you? Do you think Bonnie Bennett can absorb hellfire through the tunnels away from the town? Better still... I think she can send it back to Hell. Where you and I will wait patiently for it.
Jana tried to get me to deal for Burt too, but I refused. So why were you running away? On Jana's last flight, a package went missing. A package? And Burt thought Jana had stolen it?
So why were you running away? On Jana's last flight, a package went missing. A package? And Burt thought Jana had stolen it? And when she didn't have it, he went after Raj.
We were looking for... a special package that had been smuggled into the country... - Right. - We never found it. It must have been the poison. Kleinberg must have been the one who stole it.
! To the music. It looks like your disgusting father has caught a bad virus and can't get out of bed. It's probably chills. - Mom. - Anyway, if we're quick, we can release a teaser this week on XStream before he finds out and blocks it.
And I'm going to do it until I own you Because I'm capable of anything To take over the world I can take over the world I can take over the world Brandon, let's raise the tone a little and see if Nessa can reach you.
Shut up. I agreed to do a song with you and you want to end my album? I don't want to end it. Your album is amazing. But you only get one chance to release it.
I think the big envelope is from the divorce lawyer. Yes! At last. Just be careful. So you don't tear it, in case it's a check or something.
All these dumps look the same. So this spell, I'm stuck in some "Memento" bullshit? Right. Fixing it seems simple enough. We just have to find the witch who did it and kill her.
Right, well, I'll change my vote from witch to ghost. I don't know. EMF isn't that surprising in a museum. They're always full of ADHD spirits and their chains, you know? Right, but if our killer is a chain dragger, how are we going to find out which one?
No. My Lord. It's the necklace. The necklace? I bought it myself.
Are you sure this will work? We've never done this before. But our grandfather did. And Abaddon. And Rowena prepared the spell for you to use.
Who do they write about in the history books, you know? But the people we saved, they are our legacy. And they'll remember us and then I think... We disappear too. That's okay, because we leave the world better than we found it, you know?
Dean... The extraction of Grace. The tracking spell was a hoax, right? But... but the extraction ritual worked. E? What if Cass used it on Kelly's child?
She doesn't seem the hugging type. Yes. We're going to find your mother. Well, her car is here. Nobody tried to hide it.
Where did the attack happen? On my way to Budmouth. She was on her way home from a party. She was knocked unconscious, gagged with an old sock, tied up, raped. As I said, she never reported it.
Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. I was working and I found this bag. Did you touch it? When I found it, yes.
What's your point? Is she a zombie? That's a pejorative term. - I don't like it either. - Then let's not use it.
Gordy, Gordy, Gordy. That's the name of my band. So...? So... You've got a hit on Internet radio. How are you going to keep it going if you can't play concerts?
And he wants his fortune. Killing us wouldn't do him any good. What would be the point of taking part in The Wonderful Wedding? Marriage is like sharing a soft drink or agreeing to be the back of a horse suit. Even if it's on stage, you should only do it with the people you love.
And there are strict rules of conflict that I can't break. So... Let's make this an unofficial meeting. Is there anything I can do today to protect myself? Should I consider extreme measures? Separation, divorce? I ask you to take the money and put it in your bag.
Each of them came here willingly to support their lawyer. Jimmy went to people who would otherwise never have seen a lawyer in their lives. He took the time to make sure they had wills that accurately reflected their wishes at an affordable price. Because Jimmy McGill cares about people. He dedicated the last three years of his life to his brother's well-being. Waking up at 5am to buy Charles' favorite newspaper from the only newsstand in town that sells it.
Guys, I'm not going to bore you with technicalities. But that ad doesn't actually belong to you. It's the real, intellectual property of Saul Goodman Productions. - I don't think so. Those are our faces. - It's our store. And it's my ad and you can't run it without my permission.
I'll never forget that. That was the moment I fell in love with you. Based on the scale of the center, it's a community of at least 2.5 km². And Grushenka is watching everything. There has to be an operations center. If we find it, we can find out what's going on.
I didn't want to tell you until I confirmed it. But I believe that Scottie Hargrave is a sleeper agent. What's that? No. - No, it can't be true. This program, the look-alikes, the city, the people who ran it.
WESLEY GAITHERSBURG COMMERCIAL CENTER, MARYLAND Put it in your pocket. They said I have to go alone. - Without anyone else. - Keep your cell phone in your hand in case you don't hear it ring. It vibrates too.
On the Fourth of July, shortly after dawn, Jason and Cheryl Blossom drove to the Sweetwater River for a morning boat ride. Are you scared, Jason? What we know happened next was that Dilton Doiley, who was leading the Riverdale Scout Group on a bird-watching expedition, found Cheryl on the riverbank. Jason. The Riverdale Police dredged the Sweetwater River looking for Jason's body, but they never found him.
Not even with your new job, working for your high school boyfriend? My father and mother don't want to involve the police. They don't want it known that she ran away, or her "shameful condition". Please. What decade is this? Since she knew where Jason's car was, they're afraid people will think she burned it, and if she did...
- I asked you to read it. I don't know, I thought you were just pretending to be interested. This is excellent. I can barely string two sentences together, but you, you have a gift. Thank God you're not wasting it.
What did you find? My grandmother's ring. She gave it to Jason. He proposed to me with that ring. How does your mother have it?
He asked me to marry him with that ring. How does your mother have it? I... Let go, Gollum. Your mother could only have that ring if she or your father took it from Jason. He wouldn't have given it to her, just over his dead body.
Kevin called me and said that his father had found the gun that killed Jason in a safe in the FP's closet. - But we searched the trailer. - We searched that closet. And there was no safe. Someone put it there after we left.
It's not just in Thornhill, it's in the city. You can feel it. Something perverse is approaching. By the way, I loved your article. Just as well, because I've already published it on the Blue Gold website, with paper copies going out tomorrow. FP JONES IS INNOCENT
Listen, being a man has nothing to do with your aggressiveness, Kyle. Anyone can throw a punch, pull a trigger. Knock things over. That's easy. Building... that's what's hard. Remember that. We try to leave this world a little better than we found it.
You know what I mean. I don't. We were working on the design project you asked for. We didn't expect it to be so much work and we decided to help each other. We missed a few classes to finish it, but it won't happen again.
Is there anything I can do for you before I leave? I'd like to get rid of the baby carriage. Kevin's not a baby anymore. I was just going round and round with him in it, to keep him warm for.... ... the next one. Now I need someone to take him away.
Closing maternity wards all over the country, what's next? Only a man could think that's a good idea. Apart from anything else, it will lead to an increase in hospital births. The hospital is the best environment if specialized help is needed. And if not, every woman's home should be perfectly suitable.
And now you're with God? Yes, Reggie. That's good. Can I have lunch? Um, yes, Violet has it ready.
Pilim, paste, cocoa, paper, cheta. Money. That which separates the rich from the poor. But what is money? It's everything if you don't have it, right?
Centuries of peace and prosperity with a Targaryen sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Guardian of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the oath your ancestor swore to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Guardian of the North. Together, we will save this country from those who would destroy it.
That was my biggest mistake. A failure of imagination. She's a monster, you know. For you, I'm sure. For others too. But after we win and there's no one left to oppose us, when people live peacefully in the world she's built, do you really think they'll despair at the way she's built it?
Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed. They've grown quite fond of your interest payments. We must devise a way to boost their morale. Yes, perhaps we can assist you in some current endeavor. My only venture at the moment is to re-establish control over this continent and all who inhabit it.
- He's not here. - This is my number. Could you tell him to call me? The year I fell into a coma, I was supposed to visit that telescope. Of course, I never got to see it.
Huck, can you reach the windows from the trunk? Mate, you really need to check that. No, no. The electrical control units are sealed against moisture. - It doesn't make it waterproof.
I gave her one just in case. You can trace it, triangulate her signal. We can find Huck. We can bring him home. Her cell phone stopped sending a signal hours ago, which could mean she turned it off, but it could also mean it's broken.
And I'm not going to eat this food, because it's rubbish. What's with the paste? These three episodes, in notes. I don't need that money. But I do, Vanesa. That's why I asked for it!
- Really. They're very impactful. Can I borrow that book? Well, this is the book on the coffee table. But you've already taken it off the coffee table.
Well, this is the book from the coffee table. But you've already taken it off the coffee table. You're right. But it'll be back there soon. If you took it off, what would I put on the coffee table?
- Mom! No! - You said it would work. - And it does. I just gave the control to Supergirl. Only she can turn it on.
- I'm fine. - But I can't accept the ring. I can't touch my fund, in this life or the next. It would be... unethical. You have to give it back.
If someone had entered the room while you were at the computer... I know, but when I saw Bram's name... Shit. File in an unknown format? I suppose you can only open it on an Occupy computer.
It is not advisable to neutralize it on site. It is an improvised explosive device with a high lethality rate. When will it explode? The timer is jammed. I can't see it properly.
Yeah, I'm afraid you'll have to destroy your card. Good luck with that. It's hardened titanium coated with diamond powder. I don't have any money. Don't take it.
It really made the room look better. Yes. That painting was great. An unoriginal seascape. Maybe another animation program stole it!
That painting was great. An unoriginal seascape. Maybe another animation program stole it! Let's see about that! Or maybe he sold it on Craigslist.
He was still trying to figure it out. He only heard it once, after Eros burned. You didn't mention any of this. There wasn't time. We need to find the source of that noise before Cortazar leads him to Dawes.
What were you doing with Laxman's jacket? I found it under a fence, near the woods, next to the Americans' house. Why didn't you report it at the time? I find all sorts of things in the woods. I didn't know anyone was missing when I found it.
I find all sorts of things in the woods. I didn't know someone was missing when I found it. I would have kept it, but it didn't fit. It was too small for me. I was about to take it to the church sale when I spoke to Zebulon.
Baby, get up. Act like it's nothing. Really? Are we going to stay like this? Let's say we found a murder site and were cleaning it up.
Are you going to fuck him? Yes, we're going to fuck him. It'll be until the morning. How much are we talking about? We'd like to take him with us. We're shy.
No, no. Let me take care of it. I don't want to destroy this - until we know what happened. Let's put it where they can't see it until we know what's going on.
- I don't think we'd see it, since it seems linked to Eve or... - Or? - Or what's behind her. Spirits and entities sometimes connect with people from this world. But when Eve saw it here, so did Nick.
Something about his staff bothers me. It's totally cracked, as if it had... been assembled from different pieces. And none of these texts refer to that. Something also bothers me. If he is as powerful as he should be and belonged to the people mentioned... So how did Zerstoerer get it?
Kullen hid the money from the casino and now he's going to get it. But why now? What's happened? The fire. That's what happened. Wherever Kullen hid the money, the fire exposed it somehow.
Billy knew what had to be done and had the balls to do it. Lockhart knew what Billy and I were doing. She authorized the operation. That file is a weapon. I trust you know how to use it.
Thanks, man. Destroying things... that's easy. Rebuilding... that's hard. We try to leave this world a little better than we found it.
You can see the negative side, cry and protest. Or see the positive side, have fun, laugh and carry on. That's what I chose to do. Everything in life has a good side, even Madrid. Even if you can't see it.
Will you help me get back what is rightfully mine? Mrs. Carmen is a very determined woman and she won't forget a ruse like this. But she's a woman and, despite the efforts of the suffragettes, this world belongs to men. Who do you think will win? I want the poster placed higher up, where everyone can see it, and the phones on the side.
But the truth is that I'm not ready either. What do you think about both of us acting as interim managing partners? It would be an honor. First order of business: what are we going to do about the name of the firm? I don't know what you think, but I think we should leave it as it is.
Get out of here. You don't know what you're missing. - That suit was so... - Fair. I think it'll be hard to take it off. Unless he never takes it off.
- Where's your child? - No, no, it's a baby. Okay, where's your baby? I can't... I can't remember where I left it.
Margo's here. Remember Lasaro? - The bastard who made Margolem? - I twisted his arm, or his balls, and he gave me the spell. Live clay is hard to come by, but Fogg left it so unprotected that he must have wanted it stolen.
It doesn't get any better. The Northern Lights are incredible. But I was talking about the hamburger. Is it bison or elk meat? What makes it so good?
- Pick it up! - Shut up, Firuz! Shut up, Firuz! Success can be lonely. We long for someone to share it with.
And even if you were, it wouldn't change the fact that you're too old for the role. I'm sorry, but Anna can't be 50. That's bullshit and you know it, Chuck. I deserve the part. If not me, who will play it?
- We have to find this book. - Do we even know the title? It's a long Serbian title which, according to what I read on a forum, means "Pozica: Where Never to Put Your Fucking Feet". There's a guy who says he has it.
The higher up the list you go, the more money you ask for. It's like limp biscuit. Did you sue them too? Not the band, from where they got their name. It's a fraternity ritual where everyone hits a cookie and the last one has to eat it.
Burrows? His chances of survival are practically... S.H.I.E.L.D. leaves no man behind. Do you really think this is our best course of action? You know the saying... if a jet crashes in the woods and there's no one to hear you, stay close to the guy with super strength.
Maybe never. But that... gene passes from generation to generation without stopping. And it continues. Maybe it even skips a generation. Maybe it won't. But... everyone who carries it is part of the plague.
You've never helped anyone, you bitch! Give me the Terrigen and I'll show you the threat. Someone inside HYDRA did this? Your name is Vijay Nadeer. Don't deny it.
- He was in a mass grave at the Academy. The story is a farce. I think HYDRA murdered me. - Did you find the extraction device? - Exactly where we programmed it.
- Daddy, help me! Daddy! She's just a child! - Leave her alone! No! - Daddy, Daddy! The hangar was in ruins when we found it.
- It's too early for that. - Yes. Is Putnam's cake ready? Yes, ma'am. I just need to wrap it.
Thank you. Just as I was about to kill the guy, I felt that tingling. - Down there. - I know where that anthill is. So why don't you go and visit it?
Raw beef. And your shrimp? - It's good. - You know why? Because it's deep-frozen. That's what keeps it so fresh.
Sit down, please. This morning, I felt fantastic. I was encouraging everyone to be what they want to be, but now I've told Abby to leave the school, and before that I almost killed Principal Novak. Yes, impulse control. The undead don't have it.
They're too... dead. Come here. Show me your finger. I don't think so. Maybe you'll never have to see it.
Stop staring at her. I'm joking. You can contemplate. No, you can't! There are a lot of people behind this and I don't want you to run the same risk as me. I need to see it.
You're a brave and resourceful young woman, Abby. I saw that today. You'll be fine. I'll leave you my equipment and the book. I want it back. Don't treat it like a towel.
What are you talking about? We made him guarantee that he would pay you what he promised and that he would hire you at the end of the quarter. -I don't just want you to make an appointment. I want you to take down anyone who gets in my way. Look, it's up to you. Either you take the job and the money and put me on the Bar, or you stay on a sinking ship and hope they realize it was you who sank it.
-Welcome back to the Order, Mike. -Thank you, Harvey. -Technically... -You've never been in the Order. I'd ask you how your day was, but the last time I did, it didn't go very well.
And that's completely normal. It just makes me wonder if you're thinking about or possibly having sex. I don't want you to feel it's wrong. It's actually a beautiful experience that you're too young to have. But if you are, I want you to use protection and do it for the right reason and not because you feel pressured.
Then everything went dark. When I woke up the next day, I was in hospital. Someone had found me and called the police. I can't believe I'm still alive. The strangest thing was that he left the money in my pocket... As if he wanted me to find it.
Very good. The revolvers... You have nothing to know. Thumb on the dog. Drum out. Don't let it spin.
Peter Baxter was in the opposite cabin. Kemar Pearce was right next door. Edwina Bousquet was in the warehouse, and Judith Dawson was outside, here. And they can all prove that they were where they say they were when the knife was plunged into Victor Pearce's back. So how did the killer manage to do it without anyone else in the room seeing him?
- Help keep the smell away. Try not to get ash on my instrument tray, Inspector Bradfield. Given the hypostasis and "rigor mortis" observed on the body at the crime scene, I would estimate that she was killed between 18:00 and 00:00 on Sunday, May 13th. Cause of death, strangulation? The knot in the bra is so tight I had to cut it out.
- When we find Eddie, we'll ask him. Tennison? I just found Julie-Ann's autopsy report lying on my desk. Yes. You told me to leave it there, sir.
In fact, it's past dinner time. I know this because the sun has already set and we haven't eaten yet. I'm not afraid of the dark. The universe is always dark. It was the stars that lit it up.
If we see the taxi driver, we ask him where he took them. What do we do when we see them? She got carried away by Olaf and his disguise. Maybe, but not us. Whatever Olaf's plan is, we have to stop it.
I still have it somewhere. - You never take us to Malibu. - Is that what you got from the story? The good news is that you're getting a new car. Sure, I'll have the butler pick it up.
Our specifications are wrong. What's wrong? His life support is being provided by the tank's power source. We don't have batteries. If we move him, he'll die.
Did he? Yes, you did. I suppose we'll have to do this the hard way then. Now, where's the fragment of the Spear I gave you to protect? I don't know why you want it, but you'll never find it.
Too bad. Basically, your king now does everything I want him to do, so if you don't want him spreading your blood on this ground, I suggest you hand over your Spear fragment. My patience is wearing thin. The fragment... Where is it? As long as I live, you'll never get it.
I know you can do this. You saw what they did to Arthur. Imagine what they could do with an army of controlled knights. - What are you suggesting? - The fragment of the Spear... we have to get it out of the castle.
I mean, one egg was enough for, like, 70 omelettes. I don't regret a thing. Right, but you should have told us this before we came to Gertrude's territory. This is where the eyeliner fell off. Look, if you want to stop the Legion of Evil from getting your grandfather's piece of the Spear, we have to get it back.
- Were we able to deactivate it manually? - No. The White Martian who took Winn's form also took over his intelligence and recoded everything. We're out of the system. So we need the real Winn to unlock it.
And disgusting. - It's going to be a hectic couple of days. - What about permanent damage? If they're healthy, no permanent damage. But I'm not sure I'd recommend it.
So she was hiding secrets even from herself. Apartment... 195. ID44574. The entry code. But maybe he changed it.
It's like a horror movie. Or a Greek tragedy. What's wrong with this painting? You're always looking at it. I bought it for your father because he loved it.
Okay, who gave you the book? - A witch must have... - That's the thing: the book is written in my handwriting. And I don't remember writing it.
- She said something about blue light. - Yes, it's Fifolet. New Orleans legend has it that the spirit can appear as a ball of blue light. How wonderful. How do we kill it?
There has to be another way. Where are we? Don't look at the blue lights. Yes... So these kids energized that ritual. But there could be a glitch if I connect it to you.
Did you see her come in? I'm going to say good night to Hope. Hayley, wait. An impressive border spell. Fortunately, it only lasts as long as the witch who cast it.
Neither did Kol. - The sooner it's over, the better. - No. We have to assume that Inadu's totem is still intact. We can't attack her until we destroy it.
Hope is still unconscious. Do you think this will work? The pendant was designed to contain a person of Mikaelson blood. It will contain Hope. I did my best to repair it.
- Yes. She's an expert at burglary. Don't leave anything you like near her. Listen to her. Why did I buy you a cell phone if you won't answer it?
Don't worry about that. The question is, are you murderers? If you steal that money, you'll have to kill me. Because another man who works for Mr. Navarro will be in town. If I'm alive when he asks me about the money, I'll tell him that the Langmores stole it.
He takes his family out of Chicago and eight million out of the bank, moving everything to southern Missouri. Why would he do that? The money was clean. The taxes were paid. If he was afraid we'd freeze it, he'd transfer it out.
- I know. Listen to me. On this piece of paper you have Del's e-mail address, an address and the number of a storage unit. That's where his money is. That's where you'll find it.
We know why. The map. It was never discovered. There have only been rumors that such a map ever existed. And that De La Warr had it.
Accusations don't make a man give in. But evidence will. We need to spy on her house. Samuel... if Farlow has the map, isn't it our duty to find it? - Why would you believe he has it?
I have to take the water back. Let me carry it for you. I've never been beautiful before. Your brother, there's... talk that he might have the map. Well, if he did, sir, I haven't seen him.
No. I'm going to wander the night. I've come to ask you to give me back my stone. You wouldn't have searched through my belongings if you'd had the map. You don't have it either.
I beg you. It's just a school day. I couldn't agree more. That's why I decide to teach. But there's a national day of mourning. Heidelberg University has to respect it.
Have you come to my classes for pleasure? No, sir. In fact, yes. I really enjoyed the classes. I wrote an essay on kinetic theory. I was hoping you could read it.
They call it ether. If it's invisible, how do we know it exists? We don't. We've been trying to understand it for years. We can't see or feel it, but the ether exists where there is light.
It's not an anomaly. This sample must contain a new element. A radioactive element. It would have to be hundreds... Thousands of times stronger than uranium. We have to isolate it.
- Then redirect it. Which way? I... What do we do? - Where do we send it?
Are you serious? Are you? Do you want to be like me? Do you want to be powerful? Do you want to destroy the world and all the pathetic creatures that inhabit it?
Nine years ago... Yeardley was part of an expedition beyond the falls. They tried to bribe the Powhatan, the Pamunkey and the Chickahominy, telling them where they could find the gold. They didn't. But it's here. Yeardley came close to finding it.
They tried to bribe the Powhatan, the Pamunkey and the Chickahominy, telling them where they could find the gold. They didn't. But it's here. Yeardley came close to finding it. So I went back to find it.
Yeardley came close to finding it. So I went back to find it. How can two farmers find what an expedition couldn't? When I have the gold in my hand, brother... then... I'll be master of my own destiny. We won't find it.
We'll be there soon. - Those who drink the water. - My friend, the danger here is... that Michaelmas Whitaker is determined to claim that the cause is witchcraft. If Redwick dies, they'll turn to Verity Rutter. So we have to convince the Governor that this is the real problem. Nothing has helped you so far, Marshall Redwick. Not the leeches, not prayers.
- I'm coming from... - Zagreb. I recognize the accent. Was I lucky enough to meet a Slav in the heart of Prussia? Does a heart beat in Germany? I haven't heard it yet.
Anyway, being there made me wonder... Why are we doing this? Why did it take me four years to start this project? And no... not just because I know I'm stubborn. Why are we here and doing it for breast cancer?
You know, I've never known someone so deeply and intimately and I'm looking forward to celebrating and really appreciating the greatness of this feat now completed. 8759 MILES TO Paddle I hope everyone realizes that we're not deep-sea paddlers. We hadn't done lots of fantastic things. And that didn't stop us from having a dream that was very big and making it come true.
Hadn't we planned to stay away from the mess? I really think we should go and investigate. So do I. Some people don't learn. They only value something when they've lost it.
I know that. So I hope this is something important. We have a small problem. Good, it's a small problem. It means you can solve it.
Kick, you bastard! Son, I found something that belongs to you. Grandpa's watch! No, I can't take it. I didn't earn it, so I don't deserve it.
You have my full support, Dr. Rathenau. I'm sure I won't be the only one. Gentlemen, I'm passing on a letter from the Kaiser pledging the commitment of Germany's best scientific minds and I implore you to sign it. Support the Fatherland when it needs it most. Dr. Rathenau, some of us still defend the crazy notion that scientists should decipher the mysteries of the world, not find new ways to destroy it.
Then we'll talk. Albert. A Nobel Prize in Chemistry. - That's impressive. - I'm not a genius like you. I just saw a problem and a way to solve it.
We've been saying he's Jewish for a long time, but it's the first mention of God. It's another word that has many meanings. But do you believe in God? If I say no, does that prove I'm a communist? I believe that the Universe is so extraordinary that only God could have created it.
In a few minutes. Don't take too long. What are you looking for? I couldn't sleep. My book wasn't where I left it, maybe Helen had put it here.
Right? The document. The deed to his empire. It would all come down to that, wouldn't it? And if he had that document, where do you think he'd keep it?
The document. The deed to his empire. It would all come down to that, wouldn't it? And if he had that document, where do you think he would keep it? Do you think he'd keep it in the safe?
The body of the man whose business I just bought. Think about it. Okay. Why don't we go inside? Why don't we go inside? We'll pretend we didn't see him.
- I know. Every time I check, there's less money. The batteries are half what they were a month ago. Then move them. That money isn't worth the paper it's printed on if you can't wash it.
I've just discovered you. Hello, Anna. Have you had a chance to read the guide? Do you have any questions? No, I haven't opened it yet.
It can't get any worse. How's work? - I left that job. - Why did you leave? I thought you loved it.
Missouri law says that there can be a casino on a riverboat within 300 meters of any recognized river. - The Missouri is on that list. - A stream is not a river. That's true. But if you cut the stream here and flood these 1.2 hectares, you turn it into a river, which makes it eligible for the construction of a casino.
Thirty years in a maximum security prison. No chance of parole. Tell O'Bannon to go to hell. Ultimately, it's up to the state to accept the deal or not, but I felt obliged to present it.
Do you remember? Mom and Dad used to fight so much. They'd go from room to room throwing things at each other. Remember the pirate's ashtray? When Mom threw it through the glass door?
Elsa had opinions, advice and strategies. - I'm not Elsa. - In fact, you're not. You only show enthusiasm when you take my pipe. You haven't seen him, have you?
Shit is your poetry, and shit is still your duty. Sweet Prince, a gift. Shit by any other name... doesn't smell sweet. Beloved Magdalen forever mourns. Her captain lost to the watery depths, her love as brief as a flash of lightning that ceases to be, her suffering as deep as the sea that held him.
Right now, in my store at St. Paul's! Well, where's your stupid book? She gave it to her accomplice. If I stole something, it wouldn't be a book. I can't eat it or drink it, and I can't read.
I can see by your appearance that you're a lover of your own hero. Ah... My name is now known to theater lovers. Have you read my manuscript? I have. I haven't read it yet.
The king is weak, and the duke must save his kingdom. It's excellent Mm, it has potential. I knew it! But only with the right man to make it great
To feel more powerful? I thought that was the point. To show that we're better than them. There is no "we" yet. Power is meaningless if you don't apply it wisely, with a purpose.
Now we have to wait. But do we just wait for things to happen? Darling, I tried. I tried to focus on you. I tried to put up a barrier to keep him out. But it didn't work.
- Lame Rob. - Yes, lame Rob. Lame Rob? I need you to do me a favor. I need you to take my suit and bring it to the Second Presbyterian Church.
Exactly. For the poison. For what? For the poison. I have to drink it first, otherwise Eliot won't drink it.
He's found the real source, so get the men ready. And when the doctor confirms this discovery, - we'll leave. - You claim to have a map, Governor. It's the diagram De La Warr made and... Will you give it to me so that I can examine it before I leave?
Do you think the SEC was a decisive factor? It certainly didn't help. Axe, we're different, right? We didn't inherit our money. We earned it by putting up with a lot of crap often and very publicly.
And so it was. So, no. You don't have to congratulate me... - I'm lucky to have a job. - If you still want it.
- I thought all this was wonderful? Just like a volcanic eruption or a tsunami. There are few things more wonderful than destruction, but that doesn't mean I appreciate it. So... this fog... do you expect it to disappear again? It will... as soon as I get what brought it here.
The MCRM is securing an air corridor for an approaching ship. The scientists were packing up the lab to leave with that thing. It must have been their ride. They won't be happy when they discover the lab rat is on the loose. All the more reason to kill it now.
That means 24 cows. Each cow only has two breasts. We're making 60 pork ribs. That means 30 pigs. So we've already slaughtered and cooked 24 cows and 30 pigs just for cooking. I don't know, it sounds cheesy, but I think about it. I want to respect the animal as much as possible when I prepare it and I don't do it lightly.
We live in a democracy. You sound like a fucking hippie. I know it's hard to accept, but the era of kingmakers is over. I don't need to be given power, I have my power. And when I show it, Foley will have to pull up his pants and look me in the eye.
- Cherry is doing her best. Is that so? Do you like dictators? I don't know how things work in the music video world, but she's trying to make us into a group. In this industry, it's usually every man for himself. And it's almost always a man who tells you that you've got a fat ass at the same time as he's trying to feel it up.
Son of a bitch. What do you want us to do? I want my money. Go and get it. What if she doesn't have it?
They will, sir. With all due respect, Mr. Uhtred, you still haven't explained to me why you went to Denmark. I can never remember your name... My name is Aldhelm. I'm the commander of Mr. Aethelred's personal guard. Shall I write it down?
- It's Clios' business. What's in the security room is our business, not yours. What are you trying to hide? Have you ever wondered why Dad never gave you the code? He made you promise not to give it to anyone. Especially not...
- I have no choice. Elena is still out there. I heard them talking. - Who? - On the yacht. Dad... he had the judgment to split it up,
And you threw us a bunch of flashcards. Do you want to find her or not? Because you obviously need some help. Do you? What do you mean? What exactly do we need? Help reading road signs, someone to make sure the keys don't get, you know, left in the car when you lock it, something about women.
Were you serious about having a code? Oh, it's real. You're sitting on it. Additional addition to the code, not sitting on the code. Where are you going to put it under glass in the National Archives?
Like a virus or something? No. The application incorporates a bug in the photo that will be attached to the e-mail. Right. When Maddie opens it, the browser automatically finds the IP address and location of any device that's in the email.
It doesn't look like a robbery. Paul was found still wearing his watch. It's expensive. But the glass is cracked. Maybe that's why it wasn't stolen.
Keep working on it. Thank you. Add social security to the things we'll tackle on day 101. I have a hard time sorting through issues that affect people. We need momentum. We won't get it by being divisive.
Well, it's coming up now. I want to remind you, this bill is not about taking guns away from people. It's about making sure they don't fall into the wrong hands in the first place. The initial social media response to the bill is mixed. Well, they don't call it A Third Rail for nothing.
Unfortunately, their funding is about to come to an end. Arts education is something to examine as we approach the next budget. They can't wait that long. The grant expires next month unless Congress reapproves it. I was hoping we could fast-track it and attach it to another bill.
Mr. President. - A big wake-up call for you, sir. - What's going on? Abe Leonard is going to publish an article claiming that FBI Deputy Director Jason Atwood was arrested in the Oval Office for the murder of Majid Nassar. He says the White House covered it up.
Question. What are we talking about? Here it is. I lent Linus my smartwatch. He still has it.
Do you want some? I thought they were in trouble. It's like a rich man's club! We're going to be relocated, not drowned. Blair wants to continue the program. - He said he wouldn't do it without you.
They don't need more toys, they need a dog. Darling, our beautiful children need a beautiful dog. - Okay, get them a dog. - Okay, get them a dog. Then get a mommy to walk it.
Along with the pears that could have killed me, he sent me a card with a cliché phrase and a signature printed on it. "From the team". And for all this, Tyler, I thank you, because this question has been plaguing me for days. "How do I honor my father's legacy?" Then I realized that I honor him by adapting to my life the way he lived his.
He believes he has a mental disorder, but at the same time, part of him knows that the power is real. And are we right about the purpose - and nature - of that power? - No. But if the readings are right, he could be the most powerful mutant we've ever encountered. After what happened in Red Hook, I'd say that's an understatement. So, he has the power... But he doesn't understand it... Or knows how to control it.
And are we sure about the purpose - and nature - of this power? - No. But if the readings are right, he could be the most powerful mutant we've ever encountered. After what happened in Red Hook, I'd say that's an understatement. So, he has the power... But he doesn't understand it... Or knows how to control it. I want to investigate further, try to find out what instigates him.
I want to know your secret. - What... - I feel it, you know? The secret. I may have always felt it, but now it's obvious.
I know that. Charles will be back soon. He wants to help us. No. If Dr. Orwell did something to my brain, I have to fix it.
This arrived at the bank for you. I think it's junk mail. You probably don't know anyone in South America or know why the sender is my secretary. Goodbye, Baudelaire. The statue woman said she'd get it back.
- Have you been there? Many years ago. - Tell me, driver... - I told you my name is Evander. Have you ever met a woman, driver, who stole your heart and shook it like a baby in a cage?
Red is the weakest, black is a little more powerful. Gold is the strongest. Lee Kern was the first, and it was red. Yes, the red spell requires the blood of someone young. So Lee Kern's sacrifice would have satisfied the saint and returned the suspect's loved one. - But it clearly didn't.
The van has been confiscated in a court case. So they haven't spoken to or seen their brother for a year. The anniversary of the disappearance was the trigger. The sisters believe that by performing this ritual, they'll bring Miguel back, and he'll sort everything out. And they need Agent Calderon alive to do it.
WE ARE CREATURES OF FIRE IN THE ICE AGE Fire. No tool in the human arsenal explains our existence better than fire. From an animal, like any other, to the dominant species on Earth... all because we discovered how to steal from the sky and use the power of the sun. It was a magic so exceptional, so inexplicable, that we told our children it was a gift from the gods and turned it into a myth, passed down to subsequent generations for thousands of years.
For 350 million years, fire swept across the planet. Life on Earth was forced to face the monster it had created. But for one creature, fire was more than something to fear, it was the key to global domination. To tame it, to enslave it, we would sacrifice ourselves once again, and once again only to create a modern world from the ashes of the past. When we harnessed the great power of fire and used it for our own purposes, it made us feel as if immortality was within our grasp.
- I told you to put the shawl on the chair. - That's what I did. I looked everywhere and couldn't find the pin. Give it back now. I didn't take it, Mrs. Cuthbert.
What do you want me to do? Live. The radiation arrives in six days. You were going to share the shelter with us. Why don't you do it with the Trikru?
He said it was urgent. - Is it the deposition? No. It's another nightmare. I've been analyzing the timer chip they recovered and it's far more impressive than anything we've ever seen from the BNM or any extremist group. In fact, it's on a par with anything the US can do, because we did it.
In fact, it's on a par with anything the US can do, because we did it. Good God. More specifically, the company Blackthorn Kincaid. They make everything from our missiles to the Israeli Iron Dome. How did Arkani get it?
- That... I can't believe you don't want a child and that's why you sabotaged everything. - And I broke it on purpose? - Yeah. - I didn't break it on purpose.
And suddenly they've drunk eleven, right? And they're strung out, but they think... They're responsible. Drunk, but responsible. "Damn. I brought the car here. Now I have to take it home."
Then she could have gone back and got the gorilla out of prison. Show up at night. "You did it!" Put on your coat, your hat. "Let's go!" And get in the car, which is the only way. You have to drive to the port. It's the only way to return him to the jungle.
- I respect what she has built... - Good! - ... and what it means... - Good for you! Your mother says that the difference between you and me is that you were born with money and I had to earn it.
- What about legality? Mom signed everything. It's already crossed the line. - It belongs to the child. - Not until we put him in it.
At the cost of her life? She came in healthy. If we'd found the stenosis a little later, we wouldn't even be here. The kidney would be inside him. But it's not, and if we don't put it inside someone, they'll die and no one will use it. So where are we going to put it?
Stop it! You spend your life saying: "I'm an Avery, I'm an Avery," but you're not, not like you're trying to be. A surname means nothing. It's the person who has it.
Not yet. When is it? Your surgery is tomorrow. Later. I can do the surgery and then I'll tell you. And then I can tell you that I had cancer, not that I have it.
Forget who killed you and the guys who sent you. If you go too high, you'll reach a place where there's no difference between cops and criminals. No nations, no borders. That's where you'll find them. But, brother, I don't recommend it.
What they did to you was wrong. Who are they? You climb too high and reach a place where there's no difference between cops and criminals. That's where you find them. But, brother, I don't recommend it.
- You can have a look around. - That's not necessary. If you say they're fair, then they are. All right, then. I thought we'd do it in the Elk hut?
Good. Holy Central Bank. This must be some kind of federal station. What's a kind of station? Hidden treasury sites around the country where they store money before sending it to the banks.
Here comes the problem. That abandoned factory where we found the nuclear device? I buried the money there. That's why you were hammering on the floor. I went back last week to get my money, the workers arrived, I ran away before they saw me. But now there's full security, and I need your help to get it back.
- Knock-knock! Oh, I forgot. Kimberly, Richard wants to marry me with his grandmother's ring... I don't have it! No, his grandmother has it.
What does that mean? - Work fast! A shield generator? Separatist model. Almost as old as you, Rex. Someone kept it operational. Serviced it. Battle droids?
- For a change, I am. - What about the deflector core? - Leave it. Zeb, Sabine, wait. Don't leave it.
Reed must have inadvertently summoned a hunger demon by solving what he believed was a riddle for children. In the end, we fought on different sides, but no man deserves such a horrible death. If we find this puzzle box, we can lure the demon out. Trap him. Then we track down the bastard who released it and make him pay.
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't. Don't touch it. Now that the Spear is whole, it will try to draw each one of us to it. It will use our weaknesses, our desires, our flaws. It will promise each of us that it will be able to remake the world as we want it to be.
One... one moment, Mr. Thawne... I just need one more moment. There, there. As you can see, the machine appears to be working, although it may take a little longer for the core to reach maximum temperature. Well, then, you'll stay here until it does.
When they have stolen everything from the land, they will steal from the sea. If their enemies are rich, they will take everything they have. If their enemies are poor, they will make slaves of them. Their work is... theft, killing, plundering. They do this work and call it empire.
If you come with me... I can't promise that you won't die. But I can promise this... You won't die in a hole in the ground. We need to take him back and close the portal behind him. The portal won't open until sunrise.
Well, they're not trapped, and they're more than just fighting. And there's music. There's always music. Team, who's going to help me hide his guitar? That's what I'm trying to teach you, Missy. You understand the Universe, you see it, you understand it.
The girls should have their room ready by now. You can approach him. Congratulations on your citizenship. Thank you, sir. Hong Kong recognizes talent when it sees it.
I don't know. He's an agricultural expert. Did he talk to you about insects? No. He knows about wheat and what can kill it.
He has lots of friends in lots of organizations all over the world. Religious organizations? Well, some of them fight for justice, which is good enough for us. Paige. You have to use him until he's gone.
I've asked myself an equally desperate question for many years: how do you succeed in show business? Do we move to San Diego and disguise ourselves as a bush? Walking slowly north in the twilight? What do famous people always say? They always say it, do you like doing it?
Imagine a happy employee leaving the office to get a coffee or do some yoga and what do they find? - A doll's foot, I hope. - An animal snack store. Stella and I went to one in Solvang. Her quiche looked so good I almost ate it.
- Once. There's always something unexpected... Except the first one you wore. They were in and out of that clock all summer, right? Until their mother died and their uncle sold everything. I think I saw it.
You can take solace in that. I just realized that I've had this in my car for weeks. The paraffins killed it. I'll get you another one. Aldous was so proud when he published this book, but P.T. Westmorland told me that he had written it and that Aldous had only fudged it.
What's your goal? Immunity. I'll give you the doctor, you get me a new place to start again. Max, my right-hand man, you have to leave him alone for this to work. Maddie tells the doctor she's found the missing money, he's coming to claim it.
You can't use that dark tone to portray African-Americans. - Nobody felt offended. - Have any black people seen it? I haven't had any African-American guests. I'm the person with the darkest skin who saw it and the most offended.
He must have been sending messages to the FU all this time. So let's sober him up and then... We'll execute him. No. But I like it so much that you want to do it. We'll put the message back on the dirty plate, let him find it and take it to the United Fillorians base.
I'll need a guarantee. Okay. Here are the keys to my house. Here are the keys to my house. Take out the mail and feed the cat. What do you want me to feed it to?
Everything will be fine. We can put some things in the fridge at the farm. Yes, thank you. - I'm going to check the pipe that burst. - I told you I fixed it.
I tried to call you before you came here. Yes. Sorry. Colt took the sound out of my phone a while ago at the church. I don't know how to put it back on.
I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you too. And I love you, Beau. I love you too. Besides, the offer for the bar has gone through and Rooster will no longer be working here to run it.
Chale put you under fire, huh? No. He actually inspired me. I promised Donna I'd buy her a ring years ago, and she's really amazing She... she never mentioned it.
Criticize the program all you want. I don't understand. Why do people watch the show? It's just a show where you see people eating cupcakes. I don't know. I just present it.
Fantastic! I've never been in a helicopter. Neither have I. I've had the certificate for a long time. - I have to use it.
What kind of spas do you go to? What do you mean? It's a men's spa. There are pins everywhere. I change my clothes, my pin sticks out, but I don't like showing it off in front of everyone.
A great thief. But an idiot for going to work for the other side. I never saw him, but I heard his voice at a party. Boasting about an achievement in that arrogant accent of his. I'll never forget it. He was also the last one to touch the shield before we caught him.
There were lots of people there. My mother wouldn't let me. Why are you wearing that old-fashioned dress? It's nice to have new clothes. When you're an orphan... I wouldn't wear it if I were dead.
In fact, it only benefits him. We've lost a battle but the momentum of the war remains in our favor. Sire, all of France supports you and your ambitions. But even ambitions have to know their limits. I'm building an empire. I have no intention of sharing it.
You can't be chosen by God. But what if it's not true? What if you're just like all the other mere mortals? What if the castle you built has no foundations? What if the poison that inhabits it kills everyone who lives there, including its creator?
The search for the perfect metaphor doesn't pay attention to the time on the clock. I wish you luck in your search. Good night to you! Good night! I can see paradise, but you have to build it for yourself.
That's sweet. I can't wait to get my hair done. - Ruby, what's wrong? - I'm not a woman. Why don't I have it?
- Is there a problem with him? Not at all. You don't like it? It's the most precious possession I've ever had in my life. I have to give it back to help the family.
I hope so. I'm an oyster head. I have something. Mermaid magic. It works between realms. We can get a signal back to Storybrooke if there's someone there who can pick it up.
And we didn't develop. This was the only one. Legend has it that it was created over a thousand years ago by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian instructed in the Jedi Order. After his death, the Jedi kept the saber in the temple. This was the case until members of the Vizsla Clan broke in and took it away.
And at that time, they ruled all of Mandalore wielding this blade. This saber is an important symbol for that clan and respected by the other clans. I imagine Sabine was thrilled to get it back. I can't tell you how much. After we returned from Dathomir, she gave it to me to keep and hasn't wanted it since.
Forty-six. The outside has a watertight seal. Guess what we're doing now. We're taking the plastic off the underwater solar panel. Otherwise, we can't take it on the plane.
I've never tested positive. For the record, have you ever used human growth hormone or any other performance-enhancing substance? No. Your testimony has to be clear. How many times do I have to say it?
"... and then promptly forget about it again." Accused in an anti-doping test, stripped of gold medal. "... and, above all, apply the same process to the case itself." Your testimony has to be clear. How many times do I have to say it?
It looks like we're back to square one. I checked the dealer's phone records. That call Paul heard last night was between Mitch and the dealer's stock manager. Mitch called him to find out if the car he'd already paid for was ready for delivery. The stock manager told him that another dealer had sold it to someone else, and when Mitch found out - he went crazy.
You presume familiarity. You must call me Mrs. Lyles, sir. Mrs. Lyles. You know, that name sounds familiar. I swear I've heard it somewhere before.
- It's Egyptian Arabic. My Egyptian Arabic is a bit rusty. It'll be fine. But don't let the mirror break. I've already charmed it.
This show sucks, man! It looks like a bunch of punks broke into our studio. - You don't like my show? - No, it's crap! - I imagine you find it corny.
- Let's give it a try. If one of us thinks it won't work, no problem. Thanks for the opportunity. I understand why Eric lost his car here. Lots of warehouses and garages to dump it in.
Madam President, in light of Asif Khan's appearance here today to recant his original testimony... Testimony accusing Mr. Abbas of planning a mass attack in New York City. Testimony obtained under duress after days of torture. An intensified interrogation, which is permitted under the laws of this country. Just because it's legal doesn't make it any less inhumane.
The second half of your money. And I have a bonus for you. Yes. What is it? You know that group that's been following us? I forgot to mention who was leading it.
Civilians murdered in cold blood. Including your parents. Dezic was suspected of being there, but it was never proven. This was revenge. He altered the report before giving it to Earl.
He was hacked from New Orleans. He's on his way there. I did some digging and found out he took a last-minute trip from Venezuela. He's going to buy the playbook. We don't know who stole it, so at this point we're guessing.
It's related to information from a partner in prison. Whatever the information, Louis thought it was worth dismantling McGee's apartment. Do we need to dismantle it? McGee won't like that. So find a way to search the apartment without destroying it.
- Mostly paper clips. - Well done, Abbs. - What's good? This super cool X-ray scanner. You wanted me to find a way to search the apartment without destroying it, and I did.
It might not have been an accident? But it was an accident. Wasn't it? Collins was seen with a black eye days before he disappeared. Do you know how he got it?
And you were the investigator on the scene, so it was easy to cover your tracks. Yes, and then we showed up asking questions. And you thought Nicole Trainer was a risk, - and you killed her too. - Yes, and then there's the drug money. I understand, you didn't want to put it in the bank but hiding it in the lining of your attic is so cliché.
Yes, then you called Vance. Gibbs is there now. - He won't give up. - Where's the laptop? I didn't bring it.
You've brought us bad luck, haven't you? So much for a quiet day at the office. You said Petty Officer Jones was murdered? You can't know without a body. Did someone take him for some reason?
A unilu. Like, can I help you? Can you tell me where the other market is? The what? Some call it the "black market".
He sacrificed everything to unite us. Let's honor him by destroying Zarkon. -What's the plan? -The plan is incredible! We're going to infect Zarkon's ship with a virus, create a giant wormhole where we'll send him to be taken bajillions of light years away.
Tim is Canadian. So the suspect attacks not only Americans, but foreigners. More specifically, tourists. And if Tim Hulse emptied his account, walked down the street, and after five minutes is dead, why didn't we find the money on him? Maybe he passed it on to someone else.
My mother gave me a present. It wasn't my only present, but she gave me this role. She does that now that she's getting older. I don't know if she made a will, but she sends me and gives me things every time I see her and it's a dramatic speech. "Jennifer, I had to give you this because, if I die, how could you know I had it?"
Negative. Negative. Right, it makes negative sense. I'm glad you understood. Madam, the point is that the compressor drum requires a special MHE before we forward it to the APOE.
The idea of pop music is not to invent new stories, but to tell the same story in a new and interesting way. We don't buy pop records because someone sings about love and it's something that's never been done before. Love songs have been sung for 500 years. The idea of doing it differently is what makes us feel: "Until now, no one had done it well."
They even refused to participate. It's not just the problem of human trafficking, but it's a direct attack, their failure to show up, on the constitutional responsibilities of the United States Congress. It's very unusual for someone to say, "No, I'm just not going to show up." And with that, this hearing is postponed. The Seventh Circuit ruled that this kind of government pressure against a website, with the aim of censoring it, violates the First Amendment.
I have no idea. It confirms that in the wild, females are as strong as anything! I'm Fitzgibbons Munrunney. The point is: you can't lead a cult as a man. You have to do it as a female bonobo or orca or elephant.
I'm asking for myself. I've known Aidan since I was 13. He and my mother dated for several years. That was a long time ago. As for the NSA job, he didn't want it.
You're worried about Aidan. Do you call him that? Why are you asking me? I don't know if the President or the Vice-President have informed you, but Mac is fine. The problem is what he knows and who he might have told.
Ah, there's nothing better than coming home from work and bumping into the husbands... of my daughters. - Hello, Mr. B. - What...? We're baking the cake here because the sink at home is broken. Kris said she'd fix it when she had time.
Just go up! Mike? What are you doing? I'm looking for my brown scarf. They're in fashion again, so I want to make sure I put it in the trash
The damn robot keeps fixing itself! Enough of this nonsense! I know a place where it won't bother us anymore. It's no longer an Earth problem. The circuit is complex, there's no time to disarm it.
No, I'm not! Remember what I said! This is the opposite of control. The record disk is very small. Everyone will forget they're wearing it.
Come on, Kamala. I'm your favorite heroine. You wrote a comic book about me. You don't want this. The disk is protected. We can't get a reading of what's inside and make it work.
How can it be small enough to work and look good? It's a new product design that will be part of the future. Design involves art, but I don't consider it art. My perception of art is that it is the supreme expression of the creative individual. As a designer, the main goal is not for me to express myself, the goal is to solve someone else's problem, and hopefully someone else will find it beautiful and someone else will find it cool.
It was sketched in Paris at Karl Lagerfeld's studio, while Kanye West and Kim Kardashian were being photographed in bed. And I sat on the edge of the bed sketching Kanye's ideas and one of them was a man made of LED and this pose is the result of a series of sketches. Because he started out looking too strong or not vulnerable enough, so we came up with a sketch that he loved that day and we made this model. And then we took him to Los Angeles, where he was hated immediately, so he came back ashamed. He's hunched over in shame with a parrot-headed man to cheer him up.
I don't want to be arrested. Do you? Shoot him and throw him overboard. The current will carry his body to the bottom. No one will ever see him again.
I hate this house. - Good morning, darling! - Go to hell! All right, guys, podcast time. We've got the perfect equipment and business plan: give our show away for free, and don't tell anyone where to find it.
It seems Emma didn't tell you my secret. She did. And that was a long time ago. You're a changed man, Hook. We've all seen it.
I just like them as movies. You think I think it's a documentary. I do. Here's what I've learned from living with black people: when a new movie about slaves comes out, it can't be us, as white people, who have the idea of going to see it.
If you don't, you'll regret it." And I said, "Okay." I took it seriously, wrote him a long message and told him all the things I was grateful for and all the things I was angry with him for and sent it to him. And I didn't hear back for nine months. Then I got a voice mail in which he said: "Neal, it's your father. I never check that e-mail, I just checked it and I have to tell you that I read your message.
Come and talk to him about it." So I go over and talk to him and he says, "Neal, do you remember telling me to take my money and shove it up my ass?" And I said, "I remember that feeling. I don't think I would have said it in such a silly, 70s way."
A hundred thousand dollars. If Richard said he did something he didn't do. Your son gave the police details about what happened to me. Things that weren't in the papers. I received a script. What Richard was supposed to say. Do you still have it?
He never told me. But I know where he keeps the poison. What the hell? - You have no right to enter... I have no idea what you're looking for, but I guarantee you won't find it.
For the attempted murder of Helen Dahle. If you want the slightest reduction in sentence, you'll have to tell us who created the poison. I have no idea what that is. Let's take this to the lab and identify the poison. Maybe it'll tell us who created it.
The words exchanged between us as we look at each other are all we have to take into account. I cherish the truth. I didn't kill your accountant. Your business was falling apart. I just grabbed it at the right time.
HAWAII FIVE-O [S07E18 - "E malama pono" (Handle with Care)] The bullet went in and came out. It doesn't seem to have hit the brachial artery. He'll be fine, but... he lost a lot of blood. I didn't lose him.
Good job, buddy. It's your ride, man. We'll take it to Hawaii, and you'll have a seat on a freighter to Asia. - Is it always this quiet around here, man? - That's why I chose you.
Calm down. Why would Thawne use the Spear of Destiny to shrink you? I don't think he did. I assume he used Dr. Palmer's exo-suit. Well, then he must still have it in his lab.
And you're the white guy, Kyle Copner! I haven't seen that movie. You haven't seen the movie that inspired my original screenplay in the first place: The Bodyguard 2: Guard Her Even More? Maybe we can watch it together one day.
- I wonder why I'm here. - Questions? I think I've made a name for myself infiltrating everywhere on campus. And Perry is the most promising student in my seminar. I was so impressed with one of his papers that I asked him to present it in my Introduction to Philosophy class tomorrow.
Your magic is useful because it's unstable. You're so desperate for love, to prove yourself. Your heart is confused. Don't look so surprised. Everyone can see it.
Password; "Smush". He even knows my name. What's that? My first name is Kermit. I haven't heard it since I was 17, the day I left Ireland to come here.
Look, I'm one of the good ones. My workers have health insurance. All the animals we eat know Michael Jordan before they die. And your neighborhood is a dump. I can only make it better.
- Absolute. We carry out a DNA test. How is that possible? How... I mean, how did she come up with my blood? I was just thinking that it might be possible that she collected it when she attacked us.
She was there and I just... Alicia, this will get better. You know... it will take some time, but... it will get better. Yes, because time heals all anguish, right? Except it doesn't, really.
Alicia, this will get better. You know... it will take some time, but... it will get better. Yes, because time heals all anguish, right? Except it doesn't, really. No, it doesn't. Not all of them.
- Show us the report, Kono. There are no plausible suspects. It looks like the case has been closed. Yes, but if Sears knows who did it, Danny... Gray probably knows too, so... they're not going to visit Sears.
But my parents didn't assume he was on the spectrum until he was 16. They insisted that it was a speech problem and that he would grow out of it. The saddest thing in my life is to think what it would have been like if the intervention had been earlier. That's why I chose my profession. They wouldn't admit it because they were ashamed.
I want her in the living room. Is this about the smuggling network? The CIA has discovered another transport smuggling operation. That's a good thing, isn't it? Not if they force you to land.
Dylan, the car is going to 63rd and 6th when the C4 is loaded, but there's a problem with the propane. I'm going to have to take it out.
This is one of IKEA's oldest stores, and the largest. We now have 375 stores in 48 countries. It was a new approach to catering, with very good food. But it's not just about roasting the salmon well. If you don't serve it well, people get a bad impression.
And they asked me if I knew anyone they could propose for a new design department called Wellbeing. I said, "I know a lady called Ilse Crawford." I knew her name and what she did through Elle Decoration magazine. She wrote the book Sensual Home, which for some reason I never bought. But as I married the author, I didn't need to buy it.
I'd spend three hours in a record store. I'd look at the covers on the shelves. I liked the look of a cover, turned it over and saw Paula Scher's name over and over again. I was a girl with the best job in New York. Artists and agents would come into my office and I would juggle to get them to accept a project and make it happen.
It would be a bold move that would create more instability throughout the country. An outbreak of violence in these cities... It would prove that the country is more divided than ever, under your mother's command. Do you really think they would go so far as to create a riot? They don't have to.
Call the hazardous materials team now. I think he's been injected with something toxic. What's that? Is it radiation? "The past is never where you think you left it."
I'm sorry I broke your heart. Does that mean you'll stop inviting me to dinner? No. This world belongs to the obstinate. When I have a dream, I don't stop until I achieve it.
- It must be worth a fortune. What do you mean? We have to build a prototype and prove that it works. Without a prototype, these papers are worthless. When we build it, it will be truly revolutionary.
- Here we go. And suddenly, when you think you have everything under control and your life is guided by reason, someone wakes up your sleeping heart. But if reason told us to, we'd run far away. But we can't run away forever. Because the heart is alive and we can't stop it from following its path, even if we know it will make us suffer.
Even if it costs you. I've already located the prototype project. And what's the problem? I thought you'd be pleased. I can't steal it until it's built and working.
And you too, princess. When the girls find out that they're going to lose their jobs and that you knew about it... They won't find out. The girls won't lose anything. I'm going to steal the Rotary project before the company builds it.
No one knows if that smoke is the aftermath of a fire or just the beginning. We've been promised the right to vote for far too long. And you know what? That right has never been granted. It never will be if we don't stand up and fight for it.
I'm selfish and false. You've made that very clear. And that's why you slept with Carlos? At least you've made it very clear what you want. You want money and that's why you stayed here. But now you're not going to steal it from the safe.
Because, you know, I have a Canada Goose coat. Does anyone else have a really warm winter coat? You have to have one. You have to. But in London, people approach me in the street and say I'm an asshole for wearing it.
He took me to lunch and halfway through the meal, without having anything to do with anything, he said: "Katherine, you have a beautiful asshole." The hole. It wasn't even "your body". They're looking at the hole. I didn't even know he'd seen it.
If not, there's a 100% chance they'll die. They'll be here in a minute. We can't hold them off any longer. Toby, do it. I'll make the cable charge the wire without leaving it for too long, so they don't get too much current at once.
They say that a captain's heart belongs to his ship. But with this ring, it now belongs to you. Killian. I spent so much time alone. Then Henry found me. And he brought me to Storybrooke. And he helped me find all my family. But just because you know you come from true love, doesn't mean you believe you'll find it.
The nurse who was treating her thinks she may have some broken ribs, and suspects that this man may be responsible. I don't understand. Why didn't Moani say anything to anyone? Well, it's possible she was scared. Does your daughter have a laptop or a computer? She has a laptop, but... the police have already checked it.
Whatever. You can fly. Here's my map. This must be what it feels like for Beyoncé to release a secret album. After you download it, watch out for Linus.
I keep checking to see if they've posted the video, but they haven't yet, and it's very frustrating. They will soon. They're just building up suspense. I brought a present. Whoever made it loves their son very much, and they put all that love into every stitch.
It was just after the second bomb hit us. There was fire everywhere. Dripping from the walls, spreading fast. We could see other bombers circling, but... they were too high, our guns couldn't reach them. Which meant we were at their mercy. Then the Commander appears and says that we have to flood the armory before the flames can reach it.
- The worst thing is that I've been sending Trixie Christmas cards to Bernie ever since. Howard! And one of the cards had $5 in it that I took out of Bernie's purse. The notebook isn't in the bathroom. I couldn't find it either.
He's moving in with her." The truth is that he knew that the bureaucracy would catch up with him and that they would say, "Did you bring a movie with you?" And then he could say no. He had to construct, not a documentary account, but a John Ford account of reality. The decision of whether or not to show this film the way Ford had made it went up the hierarchy until President Roosevelt saw the film.
He had to construct, not a documentary account, but a John Ford account of reality. The decision of whether or not to show this film the way Ford had made it went up the hierarchy until President Roosevelt saw the film. He gave me a roll of tape like this... VOICE OF ROBERT PARRISH ... and said: "Don't look at this and don't put it in the movie until I tell you." Of course, the first thing I did when I left the editing room was look at the movie. He found the shot, we'll never know if he filmed it there or discovered it somewhere, but it was a shot of President Roosevelt's son.
In England, a sequel to Victory in the Desert was already in the works. So the Army sent Capra and Huston to London with orders to convince the British to join them, combining the filming into a co-production. Seeing the work of the British film units, it was real cinema. Huston was disheartened by what he was doing in that war. He felt part of a coup to take a good British movie and destroy it.
Capra convinced the British army unit to approve a joint film about Allied cooperation. On both sides of the Atlantic, the effort was tremendous. Weapons, trucks, VICTORY IN TUNISIA planes, fuel, water, food, barbed wire, locomotives. There were 520 shipments of ammunition alone. When Victory in Tunisia finally opened in cinemas, the film had been the subject of a scathing report from the army, which accused it of trying to re-enact the war on a Hollywood scale.
Stevens was allowed to go before the American troops and entered the city with the Free French Army to film the liberation. The images he obtained there are some of the most exciting and unique ever filmed. Stevens wanted to film the surrender of Paris, which took place at the Montparnasse train station. Stevens went there with the crew and filmed the surrender. But he was afraid that it would be too dark inside and that the historic moment wouldn't appear in the movie. And he told them, de Gaulle and the German commander, that they would have to repeat the moment outside the station in the sun so that he could be sure of catching it.
Not long ago, 33rd US PRESIDENT, an American plane dropped a bomb on Hiroshima and destroyed its usefulness to the enemy. If they don't accept our terms now, they can expect a rain of destruction the like of which the Earth has never seen before. Already on their way, copies of Meet the Enemy: Japan arrived at the front three days after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. General MacArthur informed Washington that he would not allow soldiers to see it and recommended that it not be shown to the public either.
I didn't even kill her. She was already dead when I found her. Then why the hell did you confess? For this file. I had discovered that "Hawk" was protecting the file and had in his possession the only device that could read it. Stop it!
Every year I say: "I'm not going to use the cough syrup this time." Every year I do. What were the chances of Darlene's children finding a cure for cancer? Cure it? I'd be happy if they could spell it.
You survived being shot in the head, God knows how. You won the lottery at that moment. Take that ticket and get on a plane, girlfriend. Why come to this hole? To clean it up.
Owen, this also applies to you. Hold your position. Alex, he's right. Owen, her intercom. The police can't find it.
The FBI has seized my equipment. The mission cannot be compromised. But it already has. I need my equipment. And they have it.
I need a medical team, Priority 3. There were three men. I didn't see the body at first. I saw a rug or a rolled-up tarpaulin. But when they put him in the van, that's when...
I shouldn't have left. I should have fought him. No. You were right to follow his instructions. Because of that, the book is safe. We have to take it to your mother.
Yes, it is. Your storybook. Or what's left of it. It can't be. My mother would never burn it.
Gold will pick you up. Everything's going to be fine. I appreciate your optimism, kid, but we have to go. Do you think his heart is here? If I knew my mother, this is where she'd hide it.
What if no one comes? You've just finished a romance. It's an achievement. You have to get used to sharing your work. Yes, I self-published my work because no one else wanted to publish it.
In Russia, China, Mongolia. They could be completely destroyed. We're talking about a billion people. Maybe more. That's why Darius has been working day and night on the EP. Which could launch a GI with enough speed to reach the asteroid, and enough mass to knock it off course, missing the Earth by thousands of kilometers.
It had to be you. Listen to me. Hundreds of people are going to die, even thousands, if you don't get the air terrorism emergency code. - There's no such thing. - Yes, it does. And we know you can pull strings to get it.
He gave me a video. A video? - Of what? - Of the speech he was going to give. He insisted I watch it.
One hypothesis is not enough. There's your reasonable doubt, Chela. If anyone else has seen this video, it's a mess. They might think this guy was saying things that... You've seen it, UFO.
I, Citlalli Lopez, promise to live with dignity until my last day. I will not submit to anyone. I will not let anyone make decisions for me. I will not let anyone make decisions for me. I promise to take care of and defend my people and my resistant neighborhood, so that they never control it.
The decision we've made here is final. This is the end of phase one. We're talking about the murder of my son-in-law. We're talking about a failed investment that you yourself sold us. And we have to finish it before it turns into a political nightmare that ruins us all.
All right, girls, I'm going to say this as delicately as I can, but it looks like someone's rectum fell down the stairs. Now, who was it? Be honest. All right, no problem. Let's just agree on this rule: if your rectum falls down the stairs, you're the one who has to pick it up.
If Russia "takes" Bulgaria, they'll be in Poland by Christmas. Send the Sixth Fleet to the Black Sea. If NATO can't get its act together and stand up to Russian aggression, then we will. Yes, sir. So if the most important agreement since the Magna Carta falls apart on my watch, you'll probably never get it stamped, right?
You can't take a present back. - Open it! - You know. This kind of generosity isn't very common in you. Why don't I keep it so I can shove it down your head?
I was a lobbyist. I worked for the Senate and the House of Representatives. I've seen how things are done. The whole process is corrupt. Only Trump can clean it up.
Roger is a good guy and a patriot. He's a tough nut to crack, but they like him. He's been very loyal and wonderful. Thank God for the Breitbarts, the Daily Callers, and the countless alternative media sites where we can know, tell and spread the truth. This is not conservatism as we know it.
- I've never heard of it. - It's normal. - It's not available to the public. - Is it? - So who developed it?
War Zone. Come out, let me see something. There are 41 game interactions. - What does that mean? - It means that Jake created it.
They shouldn't even make brown cars. It's evil to do that. You look and see a guy in a brown car, full of dents and a garbage bag replacing the window. Why is he putting off suicide? What's holding him back?
My dick starts to wake up. "What are you doing here?" But I've never seen the whole movie. I've never seen Magic Mike all the way through. I don't want to see it.
A missing person, yes. White woman, in her 30s, recently deceased. Your asshole colleague has already gone in. Our what? Glasses, dark hair, gray at the temples, a mouth like someone used a tomato slicer to remove a pig's ass and stuck it under his nose?
Believe me, I know. - Casper used to do that. - Poovey! Where's the money? And the bag that contains it.
Doesn't the location seem strange to you? Look, we have three cartel murders a month here. Most of them internal fights. It hurts when it happens to a good man, but this case, it's open and shut. Look, I'm sorry, Bob Lee. But I'd be lying if I said investigating would be a good thing. That's fine. Out of curiosity, if you were going to investigate him, where would you look first?
This means that nobody knows what the members look like. Secrecy is their first priority. Donny. He took Solotov's ID and made that damn report. I told him to burn it.
I can't reach Elizabeth. Is she there? No. Whose number is it? Kaplan's disposable cell phone. If we find it, we'll find her, and Agent Keen, I think.
I'll tell you why I'm doing better than you. - You have a bigger boat. - No. A sonar. The first thing tourists ask: "Does your boat have sonar?" So why do you want to sell it?
An open-air motel? It wasn't a coincidence, was it? I think Swift and our man arranged to be here. - Do you have his cell phone? - I didn't have it with him.
It was awful. Kieran and Jonjo started playing. There could have been a heart there. I didn't realize. If we had seen a heart, we would have argued about where to put it.
Did you have the feeling? Did you see anyone? No. I'm trying to establish how the heart got there. If you saw someone, maybe they put it there after you left.
"Metaphors." Have you ever heard of that? "You have to use metaphors." I said: "What's that?" He said: "It's a thing. A metaphor is this: 'You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink'."
I've never heard of it. But a guy comes along and he says: "I'm a guy... and I want to talk about reverse mortgages. You probably haven't heard of them, but everyone knows what a mortgage is. It's when you and your loved one put together a little bit of money and, by God, invest it in a piece of land or a house.
When the President has something to say, she will. What alternatives are being considered, Grace? All options are on the table. We returned from London at seven this morning in possession of a rare crystal, which is needed to rebuild a new EP. What will propel a gravitational magnet to the asteroid in time to deflect it?
Neither does genocide. People hate genocide. Why is that? Because it's been used horribly every time it's been used throughout history? That doesn't necessarily make it bad.
I didn't say it, but I certainly thought: next time, take the shortcut. So she takes me to my back door and says: "This is it." "No! This isn't a secret. I've known this place since I bought it.
One, two, three. What's this? One, two, three. The code doesn't work. - That's because I've changed it. - What's that?
The opening is a week from today. - Oh my God! I have so much to do. Sorry, Mr. President. Come to think of it, why did you buy the field if you knew you weren't going to destroy it?
Miss Young? Miss Young? I couldn't believe my eyes. Make sure her parents don't see the corpse. If they do, the rest of their lives will be...
Why did you kill Eun-soo Young? Who's the son of a bitch? Killing a mutt only makes you a butcher. The day Eun-soo was killed, the file disappeared. If she had it when she died...
It was sold out when I looked in the bookshop. Really? Fantastic, Michi! I doubt it's sold out. Maybe they never had it.
Although the winning entry Emotions Adrift has the word "emotions" in its title, it doesn't contain a single emotional expression. The normal life of a woman who works in a café. Her incoherent conversations with her bedridden mother. Not even on the last page of the novel do we learn the names of the characters. However, what remains in each of us who has read it is an undeniable emotion.
Do you know why Nanaka Hiraki was murdered, Moriguchi? A fan felt she hurt him, didn't he? That's what you get for being linked to Shin Michima. She was really stupid. She had talent, but she didn't have the skills to make the most of it.
We're not ready. We can control it. That's not all I want to say. I'm not prepared. That path you're on, I don't know where it's going to lead, I expect your enemies to be there.
So, is this the part where you say "I told you so"? No, this is the part where I say that without the drink... I wouldn't even have had the balls to make that jump. -As your coach, I think you're crazy. -I don't know what I was thinking. But as your friend, I say you have to do it.
Please. This one is one of my favorites. I think you're wrong, that one shouldn't be for us. No, it's for you. I thought the flying hot dog implies that a ghost is holding it.
I would hear a noise. Jesus! A noise? A loud sound, like... the sound of a rabbit caught in a bear trap. You'll know as soon as it appears. Because you're the one who's going to do it.
You know, Bob, I think I'm going to introduce you to Pablo. But first, I need you to solve a problem. Alcaino says that Don Chepe's ten million frozen is actually Escobar's money. And he doesn't care that our government did it. He wants his money and he won't finish until he has it.
We have 30 million stalled in Charleston, South Carolina. The Bible Belt? It's a good place to hide money. It's where the baby Jesus is hidden. He only comes out at night to look after the money, to protect it.
DRA. JUNE MOONE EXTRA-DIMENSIONAL ENTITY AGE: 6373 SKILLS: POSSESSION LIMIT OF POWER UNKNOWN PARENTS: INCUBUS (BROTHER) STUCK IN A STATUS - And where is this witch? - In my pocket. Tell us why it won't turn you into a toad. They say the witch had her heart buried... and whoever finds it can control the witch.
I left a load of explosives in that subway. There's a tunnel flooding... that leads directly under that building. The SEALs can pick up the bomb and take it to the foot of that thing. We put it in front of him and distract the son of a bitch, so the swimmers can blow up the bomb. That's how we kill him.
Dopinder, I'm beginning to think there's a reason I'm in this cab. Yes, you called him, remember? No, my slender brown friend. Love is a beautiful thing. When I find it, the whole world will know Narcissus' Reverie.
Can you get change? No, here, you've earned it. You have a lot of strength. You deserve a lot more money than this, but I have a teacher's salary. If you want to see the show, you have to pay for it.
You can't be here. This is a private airfield. I understand, but I have an organ in this cooler that needs to be transported immediately. Really? My sister-in-law had a heart transplant last year. My sister-in-law had a heart transplant last year and they didn't take it in a Playmate cooler.
Right, I know. Anyway, the point is that you've got me up against the wall. But I'm about to finish my book. And I just... I wanted to take the weekend to finish it.
It's good to have you here, Pete. I read your book and was fascinated by some of your conclusions. First, tell us about the genesis of your book. First of all, I'd like to emphasize the time-consuming aspect of sex in our lives. We see it in movies, on posters, we even hear it here on the radio.
That's also in the DNA. What am I going to do about tomorrow's NED Talk? My advice would be to face this Ned guy, look him in the eye and tell him the truth. Sex. Everyone does it.
Come on, it wasn't just one. There you go, we've got another one. That's cool! Sex is great. It's dirty, it's disgusting, it's weird and only if you do it right.
Jiang won't like this. At around 9pm, the Earth Space Defense Program... repelled an alien attack aimed at our planet. It wasn't them. You can't be sure. It wasn't them.
� the best way to get in. I understood. Captain, all the ships in the area are being ordered to leave. There are a hundred million dollars of gold on that ship. Do they think we're going to abandon it?
Take it off! -Understood, sir. -Careful. This old radar truck was supposed to go to the Smithsonian Museum. They never came for it.
Come on! Are all the cabs in town off duty? I can't believe how angry I am. - Come on, let's go to Broadway. - Where's the subway? - I'd rather not, it's not safe.
She was going to give me double and pay for the changes. The real difference is that I refused. I'm not going to argue, it's silly. I didn't take the job. Yes, but you didn't turn it down either.
You could never be the fun one. - I could have been. - Yes, of course. - I have a fun side. - I've seen it lots of times.
But I won the fight. Everyone saw it. Can they take my belt? They... they can do that. They'll take your belt if you don't defend it.
3 and a half at most. If you cut 1 minute off that time, it might do some good. - What about the alarm system? - It's a Centaur 2100. When we turn it off, we have 10 minutes before it restarts.
"with the dense population. "If a zoo had lost a valuable animal in the Los Angeles area... "there would have been 25 or 30 men searching the area... "men familiar with the habits and behavior of this type of animal... "and they would have found it by now."
"Sincerely, Howard R. Hughes." Elvis Presley, Pat Boone, Frankie Avalon, Bobby Darin... I mean, what do you think a guy like Bobby Darin gets out of something... like Beyond the Sea? Frank, how are things going with the banana and hazelnut ice cream? The company doesn't make it anymore.
I like it like this! Close the cockpit. Gentlemen, you ain't seen nothing yet. You know that line Al Jolson used to use: "You ain't heard nothing yet"? The first time he sang it, I saw him... on the roof of the Amsterdam Theatre.
This airplane had a metal fuselage... with butt joints that we were very proud of. It had built-in rivets... which later became the standard in the industry. It had a wooden wing which, of course, didn't become standard... but it was the only thing at the time that had the smooth surface... that we needed. As I say, a single engine, a single seat, a beautiful little thing. I still have it, in fact, at the Culver City factory.
and then we saw a deer and you raised your rifle, but the deer looked at you, it continued grazing. It wasn't afraid. You tried several times to pull the trigger, but you couldn't. So you stood there crying like a little girl. So I took the shotgun and killed him for you.
Yes. I'm not a bad man, but in certain situations I have to ask myself: "What would a bad man do?" I appreciate you omitting my name from your testimony. I saw no reason to mention it.
The Indianópolis is a cruiser designed to eliminate enemy ships and aircraft. But our weapons are useless against submarines. That's why we're usually sent with a jamming escort. The job is to detect and destroy enemy submarines before they can reach us. Many of the crew are kids who have no idea of the danger we face at sea. If we are attacked by an enemy submarine and miraculously detect it early enough, we have a maximum of four minutes before the torpedo reaches us.
There is one question that nobody has raised yet. What is it? What happened to the baby? Tora... When did you find it?
Yes, they're all dead. We're all going to die. - Where are the bodies? - I told you, upstairs. They haven't seen him yet.
Right. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck. None of this makes any sense. Why embezzle the money if you were going to give it back?
I let it all happen. I'm sorry for leaving. Don't take it personally. I'll leave you my cell phone because it might come in handy. You just need to charge it.
- Benson, hurry up! There's a receiver in your vest. - In two seconds, I'll arrest you. - Don't look down. If he blows you up with one shot, he'll neutralize the detonator.
And you need your share portfolio to know where you've invested 800 million? I don't invest that much anywhere! The algorithms are in control... High-frequency trading doesn't work like that, does it? They don't put the money somewhere to let it stay there, do they?
Technically, it's not stealing. 10% of two million in his car. It's not stealing. It's almost like stealing. They're bad people and they don't deserve to get it back. What do you think will happen if we don't steal it?
Hell, I don't remember everything, but... one night she was making dinner, her best dish, it was chickpeas with rice and... vegetables or something, cooked in soy sauce and cayenne pepper. Sounds interesting. It was very good. I loved it. I thought it was lovely, how she made it her dish.
- Access to Ormino's policemen and judges, now controlled by us. Most of them wouldn't want anything to do with you because you're Cuban. And you want exclusive access to our molasses? No. You just can't sell it to White.
The distribution of illegal rum. And that no man should be in charge of another man's life. If you control the rum market, you'll be a king. I'll still have to deal with Albert White. But how will you retain power once you've conquered him?
The wind caressing her hair. Her hand on the gear knob. The music coming out of the subwoofers. - I'm preparing a mix for her. - I think so. Do you know why? So she can hear it. In this car.
Here it is. Where's my watch? I've waited over an hour. Here's the 300 dollars. Where's your watch? I don't have it anymore.
- A coincidence, probably. - Sorry about that. Can you feel the love tonight? I can. It's Valentine's Day. And what more romantic place to spend it than here, at Devil's Lake in North Dakota.
You're very well built. - I think you deserve better. - You don't understand... But you can't do a job like this alone, you need allies, people interested in protecting the loot while you hide in Mexico. Loomis Fargo may look like a big warehouse, but it's the banks' money. If you steal it, technically you're robbing a bank and that's a federal crime.
He writes about a battle in a castle, where our soldiers were firing from the battlements. I thought it was a great article. It's very interesting because there are no castles in Bergara. Why is that? Why did you write it?
Fierce, like Teresa. My cousin wants a famous writer's opinion on her dress. Do you like it? I don't know why... I designed it.
I don't know why... I designed it. Yes, I... It's at the dressmaker's. My boyfriend hasn't seen it yet, he's at the front.
Henry, I loved your article. You have to keep writing with the same feeling. What you're doing is important. Not just for Spain, but for you. How is it important for Spain if no one will read it?
Or so I thought. Look. I found this. The first hat I ever made. I thought I'd thrown it away a long, long time ago.
The antivirus. The cure for all this. Well, there's only one bottle. We're 800 meters below ground in a closed facility. If you drop it here, the antivirus won't go anywhere, and your hopeless dreams will die faster.
Lieutenant, contact Yorktown and get them to close the core - before Krall gets there. - How do we access the core? There's a maintenance tower in the gravitational nexus. - It's the only way. - Scotty... go there and get them to shut it down.
I was about to say that I don't let myself be fooled like that. I'll tell you this. I don't care if the devil did it. If it was the devil who gave the credit. - Someone had to give it.
I've already died and gone to heaven. But he has your name. One morning, St. Peter was looking at the book and writing down who would enter Heaven on Judgment Day, and he let me see your name. It was there under the letter "M." He had Rose's name. I didn't see it like I saw yours, but I know it's there.
- Put my bat down. - Go on, kick me out! What's going on? That's tough. Throw me out! You'll have to use it.
- Go on, kick me out! What's going on? That's tough. Throw me out! You'll have to use it. If you threaten me with the bat, you'll have to use it.
Holy shit! I hurt my pelvis again. -Tell me everything. -Okay. Right from the start, Bryce ordered a Nicoise salad, but asked for the tuna to be well-done. But if it's quality tuna, we don't want it...
And he can only transfer ownership of the company tomorrow morning. I can get in there tonight. I can take out the contract and get our company back. What do you mean "take out the contract"? He must have already scanned it and sent it to me.
No one ever saw that dragon again. And I didn't tell any more stories about him. I didn't need to. Not after that day. The staff looked everywhere, but they couldn't find him.
Just look at these waterfalls, the fjords... Just look at these hills full of Corvoxian grass! This is exactly what I need. But sir, the whole region is patrolled by the Galactic Rangers! We'll have that planet! And we'll have it by going on the offensive.
But first, I need to go to the bathroom to wash my ass of all this Atlanta crime! And when I come back clean, I'll turn myself in to the authorities! Handcuff me to the bed. Baby, put down the baton. If you break it, I'll have to pay for it!
But she wouldn't let me. I'm glad you're home. Can we watch my speech one more time? I'm sick of that stupid speech. I just want to make sure I've memorized it and don't forget anything when I present it.
I mean, you have to tune in, man. You have to tune in. And don't be afraid to let the experience find you. It's like Carl Sagan says, man, "The beauty of a living being is not in the atoms that make it up,
I haven't lost all my neurons yet. Do you need anything? I was wondering if I could use your phone? Yes, of course. It's an old phone. I hardly ever use it, so I hope it works.
You bet. This medallion is certainly very valuable. So, what does this medallion do? I'm not really sure. It would be cool if I could find it.
I'm sure this medallion is very valuable. So, what does this medallion do? I'm not really sure. It would be cool if I found it. You didn't happen to find it?
It would be nice if I could find him. You haven't found it by any chance? No, not yet. Henrison believed it was worth more than just money. He believed that it opened gates to other dimensions and, if that's the case, and we find it, it will bring a big change to the field of research.
He used Anandi to get what he wanted. And when Anandi wouldn't denounce the thief... Pharaoh was so furious that he lost his mind. The records say that the pharaoh demanded that the priest be punished. Heka is black magic used against the gods. The hieroglyphics I studied show that the medallion was created by the priest's black magic, and that the pharaoh used it to send his daughter to prison forever.
Then you'd better make an appointment. I have things to do. Money to find. - Money? - Yes, a big bag full of money. And what are you going to do with the money when you find it?
I studied Dante when I was younger. Probably in kindergarten. I was a bit obsessed. Dante defined our modern conception of Hell. Our view hasn't changed since he defined it 700 years ago.
- Hello. - What's your middle name? Well, I am. Zobrist is dead, but if his plague is real... And that map is a clue he left for someone to find.
I lost, and experience shows that. I'm in great demand in my line of work. Listen to what I know. I know I've behaved badly. But a puzzle needs to be solved, and who better to solve it than you?
During the Justilian plague, 5,000 people died every day on the streets of Istanbul. A border between East and West. That's why he chose it. With the shell intact, we can contain it. But if someone breaks it before we get there, 95% of the earth's population will be infected in 47 days.
"I was there when you came into the world. "You didn't ask me, "but I will follow you to your death." The name. We didn't ask for it.
The name. We don't ask for it. It's given to us at birth. That's it! Knowing the demon's name gives us the power to cast it out.
And you didn't show up for any of the sessions? Or maybe you didn't have the timetable? It was posted in the room, I sent you an e-mail with the copy and I stuck a copy in your locker. Yes. I haven't opened it yet.
They watch me everywhere. They threaten me, with all sorts... I don't have much time and I'd like you to help me... Wait, do you know what's in that video? I've never seen it, but I was there to record it, yes.
Don't use the key. Please don't. Please don't. So now you control your destiny. Tell me the story, so I don't send the elevator down, because if I send it down to the basement, there's no way down and you stay here.
I'm saying... Miss Edna and I think you have a gift. You've been talking to Miss Edna! Maybe she's sown some seeds. - She's good at sowing. - And this gift... not only do you love it, you're good at it, but it can also finance our family and the church.
- Shouldn't it be a truck? - Where are we? Well? Did you get the tube wrong? I'm sure I put it on the truck.
If he's so rich, why doesn't he buy it? And he keeps the money? And the pleasure? No. No. And why should I buy them if I have them to steal from him?
The chip can decode anything. We can hack into any computer on the planet. - Including his. - Yes. Not only will we make him think we have it, but we'll use it to expose and destroy him.
Do you know they're tricking you? Leading you into a trap? Yes, but the threat is real. The chip can hack any system, even ours. They have it, why wouldn't they use it to expose us?
Don't kill him. I should have done this a long time ago. I can't tell you if there's a heaven or hell, ... or what's out there. But one thing I can say for sure is that evil exists. We can run away from it, and we can even bury it, maybe even slow it down, but we can't stop it.
I don't think this is good for him. - What, the tour? - No, this. This documentary. I think he's doing it because he thought it would be better than the first time.
I can't leave my father's cab here. What are you talking about? It's my father's taxi. He needs it for work. Call him and tell him to pick it up.
So, what is it? I steal cars! I always knew you were into something sinister, but this is serious. - I know! That kidney belongs to someone who will die if they don't get it.
Yes. Were you by any chance at my house today? Yes. Your garbage was in the way. I just dragged it to your house.
- Keep going. Tell us what you know and let her live. Let's go. Lukashenko bought some kind of virus. When will he use it?
I assume you don't need to say any more to confirm that you won't marry this man. I'm not confirming anything. Aren't you ashamed? The British administration can dictate many things in my country, but they won't dictate who I marry. They're trying to define us, based on their rules, their idea of the world and how they see it.
Go on. Let me assure you that no concessions will be given to any mining companies without the consent of the Bangwato themselves. The report. How did you get it?
You're wrong. We give loans, we don't sell cell phones. Speak up if you want to live. Are you a policeman? The training was so brutal that when the defense secretary saw it he was shocked.
The choice is yours. Initialize: Vaporization of the Serum. Guys, guys, they've just initialized the Serum. Did you find a way to turn it off?
It can't be. FANTASTIC! - Hello, Jan Rouven? - Yes! My first poster, see? We have to go and see it.
It's very funny, because my mother is 86 years old, she called me and said: "Son, I'm very proud that they talked about it." And I was surprised because she was really proud. I've always dreamed of having my own show in Las Vegas. When you have it, it creates a kind of emptiness because there's no other goal, because you've achieved success.
It's not that music competition I saw on the news. That's the one. I see. You don't have the money, do you? Well, we don't have it all locked up...
Surrender. Last warning. I can do this all day. That shield doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve it!
Her heart contained the greatest power ever known. It could create life itself. And Te Fiti shared it with the world. But as time passed, some began to seek Te Fiti's heart. They believed that if they possessed it, the great power of creation would be theirs.
He could create his own life. And Te Fiti shared it with the world. But as time went by, some began to seek Te Fiti's heart. They believed that if they possessed it, the great power of creation would be theirs. And one day, the boldest of them all traveled across the vast ocean to steal it.
Now we know. Yes, he's a fucking psychopath. It wasn't suicide. They had an antidote. Why didn't they use it?
That's where we're going. If my parents found out I'd taken him, they'd kill me. Have you ever taken him? From time to time. A boat is like a musical instrument... it doesn't like it if you don't use it.
That was 20 years ago. And we're here to help. And I'm black. The Russians are black now. If we repair the well, they can't blow it up.
They would walk through the streets with a small piece of wood, a billet, which they would roll up in front of the men's pants. If the pubic hair was big and wrapped around the billet, they would beat the man. Now, I ask you. Do I look like someone who walks the streets with a billet to measure pubic hair? No, sir. You don't. I came back to this country to save it.
- No. Is that my toothbrush? What's wrong with my article on Kandahar, Ed? Jerry suspended it. Wait, who suspended it?
I can't believe they spend so much money on wigs. Soon they'll be kidnapping and robbing Puerto Ricans for their hair. Eddie, the only hair stolen here is Indian hair. It's lush, beautiful and drenched in coconut oil from the womb, right? That's why everyone wants it.
- But do you like it? - Yes. Better for you. A new flavor to enjoy. But if I want to order it again, the problem is that I don't know the name of the flavor.
Translated by Ana Paula Conversão PT-PT: Hello, trouble. Don't sneak up on me like that. The past can define our future. But I won't let it.
I rebelled against the Crown to organize your wedding to Sansa Stark. Do you think burning wagons at night and mowing down tired and outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a well-prepared and well-supplied Lannister army? No. There will be a reckoning. We need the North to face it.
'So this is what I'm going to be like when I get old' If you get old. If I get old. I hope I get there. I want to see what the world will be like when she's conquered it.
Just... I'm just doing what's right. You can call me Bird if you like. I thought you didn't like that nickname. It depends on who says it.
Wait a minute. What do you mean by "quite large"? It means "big". So what do we do? We have to extract it.
His name is Marius... - I've already given for this war! - She still wants you! They could have killed you, but their mission was clearly to capture you. Your daughter's blood is the goal and if they find her and use her, Marius' power will know no bounds.
That's quite a gesture. All right, let's book it. Nice car. What happened here? This car didn't work when we seized it.
Are you waiting for someone or can I take this plate away? - Yes, you can. - No, leave it. No, take it away. I'd like you to leave it.
Yes, it's me. WELCOME THAD! YOUR FRIEND SAMMY. - Sammy, how do I look? - I love the suit. It looks just like Thad designed it. If he designed it, let's make it happen.
SCARIF SECURITY COMPLEX We're coming. There is a defensive shield around the planet, with a single entrance. This shuttle must be equipped with a code for us to enter. Thinking the Empire hasn't deactivated it yet.
I have your seed in me. I'm alone with you. I made a dress. It's blue. I'll have to wear it with a petticoat, it's very transparent.
It wasn't a movie. It was the movie. - The movie. - But the movie burned down. Well, how did she see it two days after it was supposed to have burned down?
"Pride of the Motor City". - That's not it. It's not the movie. - Oh, shit. Fucking Chet. He's probably still hiding it somewhere.
- I beg your pardon? - It wasn't "he", it was "she". - Yes, yes, of course. Thank you all for a fascinating case. I'll send you a telegram when I've solved it.
Put your shoes on, we're going for a walk. No. I don't want to go. We're watching a movie. You can put it on pause. You'll finish watching it when we get back.
You take the portal device. I'll take care of these two. What does "taking the portal device" mean? They beat the shit out of whoever's guarding it, wait for Doni's signal and turn it off. We don't know how many people guard it.
Increase the Rancor Throw your body into the flames But you take that moment and, instead of just saying an ordinary verse... You know? You did something a little different. -The "catchphrase" verse, as you know it.
No. And because of that, he never really learned how to deal with adversity in an adult way. How many people here bought my new album CONNquest? You're all liars! I know you didn't buy it!
My father had a locked box on the last shelf of his cupboard. I knew where he hid the key, so one day I opened it. There were letters from his father. Most of them were academic things, but there was one letter in particular. The Reverend mentioned an incident involving my mother and father and the way he expressed it made me feel that it was something serious, perhaps something terrible.
What did you do? What did you do? What have you done? Your immune system is attacking the cells. Your white blood cell count was multiplying. The immune system protects you and only finishes doing so when the new genes disappear.
What happened? - I found it. - Found what? - The wolf. - Where did you see him?
Donnager's communications were blocked during the attack. The only Martians who believed in us are dead. So we're going to accelerate back to Ceres and take our chances. No port will allow us to dock with our radio switched off. And the minute we turn it on, every Martian ship in the system will know it.
A plausible story about reactor malfunctions and an urgent need for temporary docking. We don't think they believed it. It doesn't matter. We'll be on their doorstep in three days and that's not enough time for Fred Johnson to dismantle and hide an entire technological cloaking program, is it? Yes, that's assuming they have it in the first place.
Let go! Madam! I'm hungry. The first month, I ordered a herringbone suit. The following month, I wore it to dinner at the Imperial Hotel.
- We have to turn it off to save battery. - No, but it's mine. Manny... The cell phone has a low battery and no signal. We have to turn it off so we can find help as soon as we're close to home.
I don't think so. - I suppose you have a dog? - Yes, we do. Sykes? I took DNA from the toy before I left it at the station.
All right, girls, give him back and I won't have to call the police. Get away from me, old man! Let's not do this the wrong way, okay? I'm giving you a way out. Give the chocolate back or I'll have to take it away.
My only regret is that I can't write about it. But you should. -What's the problem? -It's my editor. He said that if I don't write about your patrol in my article, then he won't publish it.
Later! I didn't want to do the rehearsal here, and, like, I was having a really bad sensory problem. I feel a bit stupid for getting upset about these things, but it's like... I mean, it's really annoying... It was just a big inconvenience to do it in my house, that's all. Like this huge prop that I didn't expect to be here, but I think I'll put it here in the corner.
If you like it, it's wonderful. If you don't, I'm sorry. The audience gives you positive reinforcement, and that's fantastic. But if it doesn't, you get that reinforcement for achieving your goal of being hilarious for your own sake. And if your material is good and you don't fuck it up when you're live, then you've won!
Thanks for your concern, but I'll tell you when it's time to start changing our tactics. No, it's up to me. This crew has already shed a lot of blood to make your name what it is today. It doesn't belong to you. It's something that belongs to all the men in this crew who sacrificed a part of themselves to build it.
Yes, I know what a criminal record is, but what does it matter, she's the victim. What, and Naz isn't either? If I were still his lawyer... I'd at least pretend to believe it. It's like having a nuclear arsenal. You don't want to use it, but if the other side knows you have it, they bring forward the negotiations.
- 99 cents? - How cool is that? David, David. How's your show? It's not going to be produced. If they don't produce it, it's over.
What's he doing? I want to eat those plump little arms! What about the life insurance? That's the second notice. -You have to pay it.
You have to get my father's ring back. Remember what he was like before? All in all, Eddie's a good guy. I don't have anything of his apart from the ring. He only didn't pawn it because I took it from him.
- I noticed my hair was wet. - I took a shower. The forensic analysts examined all of Harlem's Paradise. We noticed that the shower in Mr. Stokes' bathroom was used. - I used it.
How can we destroy it? No... It's not even possible... - Should I swallow it? - Yes. So they can find it in your ass.
- It's true. - Is that your wife? - I know it is. - That's a lot of sand for my truck. - I decided to come to your show in the hope that it will be broadcast in Ecuador and maybe my husband will see it.
Yeah. That's... I know where it is. Oh, shit. The truck passed today. I didn't put it out.
When I go on stage, take care of Kalloor and the girl. Understood. But what I wanted to say is that all this success has come at a price. There's a cancer at the heart of Deep Dream. A shameful secret and... I have to share it with all of you.
It would be much easier to get it over with quickly. You didn't come looking for revenge. You came because you know it's time to go back. Your father created the program. He didn't have the capacity to make it work.
He has heart problems! - No, no, no! - Let him go! Give me my money. We don't have it anymore.
It's starting to make sense. If we go in this direction, we'll be fine. Right, is your cell phone working? I left it charging in the car. Why did you leave it in the car?
You want my judgment, you'll have to carry it out, alone, as I want it to be. - I'm not your judge. - Yes, you are. You're the only one who knows me, like I know you! Do you think the world stops when you leave it behind?
In my childhood, people didn't talk about miracles. I'm not sure if, at the time, I understood what they were or if I believed in them. A miracle is defined as something that natural or scientific laws cannot explain. So how do we explain it?
Did the nurse tell you I threw up and it was green? Yes. That's why we're going to do more tests. Okay? Good girl, I like your necklace, but we're going to have to take it off.
Yes. That's why we're going to do more tests. Okay? Good girl, I like your necklace, but we're going to have to take it off. But I like having it next to me.
Okay? Good girl, I like your necklace, but we're going to have to take it off. But I like having it next to me. You know what? If we put it here, its power will pass into the liquids and it will protect the inside of your body.
That depends on the definition of typical. I grew up in the valley. All the girls I know, by the time they were 18, had already made a porno movie. Or at least a strip show. But you're still doing it.
Plus the two girls we're picking up for the bachelor party... All in all, you can take a thousand, maybe two thousand. Two... two thousand dollars? Let's get one thing straight, I'm not doing you any favors. You're going to have to earn it.
This encourages them to listen. Right, guys. We've got a problem. One of you stole my money. Nobody leaves this fucking hotel until I get it back.
Guy, what do you know about me? I don't know much. What's the only thing you know? Do you like money? And do you think I spend it, or save it?
- Please remind your wife... - What do you mean? Let me show you. The screw has rusted. You have to push it in.
Grand Duchess, meet the Shelby brothers. From Small Heath, Birmingham. And, good luck with this one, Tom. Give me the money. I was told to give it to Mr. Kaledin.
What's left to work with? Cersei is the King's mother. She has the King's attention and trust. And the King has spoken regularly to the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras. The High Sparrow took power knowing full well that we would fight among ourselves rather than take it back.
- To our children. - May they have your talent. And your dirty mind. A girl will poison rum. Only Mrs. Crane drinks it.
The world has let me down. I need you by my side more than ever. But not on the throne. No, not until my work is done. Well, if you're not going to give me the throne, then I'm going to have to take it.
It's also beautiful. I mean, anyone... Orange or blue, as long as you're walking on it, it'll be fine. I was thinking about the blue carpet. Maybe we won't buy it for my house, but what if we buy it for our house?
Good evening, blessed creatures of this life. How are you feeling? I want to listen to you. Tonight, we are together in a vibratory field of a potential for advancement whose basis is love. Love doesn't appear out of nowhere, we have to choose it.
- But? - The port vote won't matter. Of course it will! The port is Marseille's main asset! Either we develop it or we die!
In the same situation is another pleasure boat with three crew members. The rough sea, with waves exceeding 6 meters, has prevented Civil Protection from being able to help. As soon as dawn breaks and the sea conditions improve... I'm Judge Vicente Louro. In order to lift the body, I need you to identify it.
- Bellamy, where are you? I had him. What were you thinking? We've got the beacon, right? Yes, but where did they get it?
Essim was the commander. What Clarke did at Mount Weather left her vulnerable. The ice nation is emboldened. Their queen wants Clarke's power. If her people believe she has it, she'll break the alliance and start a war.
Really? A Ouija board? Actually, it's a lot of fun. You should think about adding one to your sessions. ...soil is brought back to Earth, eight invited scientists will join 14 others at the Ames Research Center, near San Francisco, to analyze it for evidence of life...
What's the damage? Explosion of the oxygen tank. - How? - A blockage. There's no way to fix it, I need to replace it.
Although your guest, I'm sure, will ask for caviar. My wife, niece and I traveled by train, then carriage and then on foot to Villa Ai-Todor in Crimea. On that trip, I lost a toe. I don't know. I woke up one morning and it was gone.
Why are you doing this? I was there, remember? When you got the Wayne case. I know what it means to you. You think that if you solve it, you can close the door on the past.
I can manipulate people. I did it to Gordon once, and I can do it again, because people's brains are just a mystery, and once you understand it... Look at Helzinger, he can't take criticism because of an overbearing mother. He wants love and approval. He gets angry when he doesn't get it, so I give it to him.
Can we go back to my birthday party? I'd love to, son. This is good. If you mess this up and hurt her, I'll send you to jail for the rest of your life, and I can do that now, so don't test me. I still enjoyed the hug, even if you used it to threaten me.
You don't see me talking about how you burned your groin. That didn't happen. There were just a few sparks. The point is that the only thing those bullies have on you is that you didn't solve that case. - So why don't we solve it together?
But not you! Remember what happened to your fish? That was two years ago. You don't know how to make a bed, make a cup of coffee or boil an egg. We gave the dog away because you didn't walk it or feed it.
You know I pay. You know what my money is worth. Honestly, Maury. I don't know what's wrong with you. You have a reputation for knowing what to do with your money, except when you have it.
The fires explode. Oh my God. Ian, this would be spectacular if we were celebrating the Fourth of July or Octoberfest. Tom, we can't... We're about to open the tallest building in the northern hemisphere and I can't brag about it if I don't own it.
That said, you're wrong. He's right. The safest place is not locked up or guarded with weapons. The safest place is away from everyone. If the British can't find it, they can't take it.
He's right. The safest place is not locked up or guarded with weapons. The safest place is away from everyone. If the British don't find him, they can't take him. He said we were going to take it, he just didn't say where.
What worries me is making crucial mistakes just for fear of looking weak. He's right. He's right. No matter what anyone says, I'm not happy that he's there. But if we remove him now, we weaken confidence in the governor's leadership.
There are about 100 men guarding it. - The rest are women and children. - And the treasure is there too? It's very close. The one who knows where to find it is in there. He won't be able to escape.
That's excellent. When can I buy a copy? At Christmas. It's a Christmas album. Oh, what are they going to call it?
There's no need for that kind of language, ma'am. Yeah, 300 dollars is a lot of money to me, so I'm sorry if I don't appreciate you trying to steal from me. I'm not doing anything of the sort. Oxygen sensors break down all the time. If you drive around with a broken one and don't fix it, your average fuel consumption will increase and, over time, it will cost you a lot more.
She wanted me to send Adele a movie of her. Don't you remember me telling you that? Wait, yes. You thought it was too soon. That's right. And I was going to send it, but I'd only been with Adele for about three months and she wanted me to send Adele the link to her horrible website. And I was going to, but then she got so freaked out and impetuous about it, I told her I'd already sent it.
It's Grandpa and... I don't know. It was a day or two ago, or... There hasn't been a cat like that here yet. How do you know? Maybe they've already put it down.
You've been lying to me about Lapa. There's someone of yours in there. I need to know who it is. It's not just because of me. There's a system around that keeps our country where we want it. Among the elites, punching above our weight.
Let's get out of here. We'll still have to track down Wythe and Fenton. Do you want to do that? Is the Pope Catholic? If I'd known you were susceptible to mind control, I'd have tried it years ago.
That gives me time. No. Man, not in 100 years would we have access to what we need to try and figure out what they're doing. I lost my phone. I think I left it here this morning.
So... why don't you sit down? We have a lot to talk about. I won't mince words. There's a void here today. We all feel it.
But my father died. By the time I got over it, my field hockey stick had been replaced by a scythe. I left home and came to the village of Sarhota to work on the farms. One day a package fell from the sky. I thought that if I sold it I would finally have good times.
Pesca Vida Selvagem broke up a smuggling ring on the 89th five years ago. I'm on my way. - It's the 89. - Okay, I'll be there. I know you're disgusted by what I do, but... it's a job like any other. If there wasn't a market for this kind of thing, I wouldn't do it.
Let's bring the party here, boys. We found your car abandoned. And guess what? There's blood in the trunk. I bet when they analyze it, they'll find out it's Sadie's.
And because I was stupid. Your commander ordered you to deliver some drugs you'd seized. That's it. Is this the only copy of the report? Yes, I annulled it before putting it into the system.
Any idea what she was doing there? Nothing that fits her profile. This was found near the body. It's loaded with a set of proprietary data, including the base code of some hosts. It only works at high altitudes. If Theresa was using it, it's possible she fell while trying to transmit them.
In 1962. What are you looking at? - Nothing. - Yeah, well, mind your own business. Why didn't you kill him right there? I don't know if Oswald was the man who did it... and I still don't know.
Do you understand? It's my word, it's my judgment. Yes. We both know you're capable of doing this job. But please, you have to do it properly.
But make it cheap. Go on, get out of here. I see you got your old car back. Yes. The kidney people didn't want it.
- I didn't make a mistake! - I think you did. - I understand that you feel great affection for Jimmy, many people do. - But please, open your eyes! - You made a mistake and instead of facing up to it, you accuse your brother of conspiring against you.
I wonder... if you've ever thought of putting your talent for medicine to good use. L'Hôpital des Anges is always looking for help. What is L'Hôpital des Anges? The charity hospital near the cathedral. The nuns who run it... do the best they can, but they have to rely on medical volunteers.
He has to take these letters back to the tavern before they're missed. Is that King James' signature at the bottom? I recognize his handwriting by now. Everything else is in code. The seal had already been removed at least three times before I took it off.
Like the back porch. I'm 76 years old. I probably won't finish it. Okay, I'll give you the sandstone. Yes, I'll give you the sandstone. You don't have to sell it if you don't want to.
It was there. By repeatedly telling him he didn't have to sell? I just wanted to give him room to maneuver. It hardly seemed worth it. I thought he knew he wasn't going to use it.
No. I "lost" them as if they were in a bag and then I left it on the floor, and when I came back for it, it wasn't where I left it. I lost it. - Do you want me to... - Thank you, sir. The crew wanted me and the Captain to guard the gold and protect it, since it's in everyone's interest, right?
With some groups, like the royal family and my investors and creditors, it would be possible to negotiate for another week or two. But there is one party whose patience I don't want to test. A party whose history with the pirates of Nassau indicates that the reaction could be violent. Spain. What did you have to promise them? That it would control the fort of Nassau, recover the rest of Urca de Lima's gold stored there and quickly return it to Havana.
So, how can I help you? Funny you should ask. I just got back from the fort. The damage is extensive. I know you were in charge of restoring it.
What part? We had to change our name. The money will eventually protect itself. It will hire guards and find friends. It will protect itself with investments and partners. But while it's in this form, it's as vulnerable as a newborn baby. To protect it, given the attention our names will attract, we have to turn to the law.
The night you left, in the cave, did you say that Jack had been arrested? What the fuck is going on? Spanish spies. They know about the treasure. They've demanded that the governor retrieve it and return it, and if he doesn't, it'll be the end of Nassau.
They demanded that the governor take it back and return it, and if he doesn't, it will be the end of Nassau. The governor is a reasonable man. He's a merciful man. But he needs the treasure. Fuck what he needs. Jack doesn't want you to hand it over.
Spain is furious that they exist. They think it's an insult. They're so furious that they're willing to destroy Nassau just to prove their point. The only way Rogers can avoid this is to find the treasure and return it. Which means that if we find it first, we can decide what happens next.
Are you married? I beg your pardon? Do you have a wife? Yes, I do. How do you think she would feel if she knew she was suffering atrocious and humiliating abuse and that the only way she could stop it was to betray her trust?
If the governor returns the money, my superiors have promised not to order an attack on this island. My superiors are proud men. And they're angry. If I were you, I'd encourage the governor to send something more than gold. An offer of peace and friendship. Not just gold, but the man responsible for stealing it.
Oh my! Is it Indian Summer by Priscilla Presley? I wore that perfume in the 90s. Yes, I'm spraying it on. I saw that you mentioned it on your college reunion Facebook page.
It's Gene and Paul! Gene and Paul! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Kiss are in the garden! I had planned a more elaborate request, but your father gave me the good advice not to.
But as Bobby's brother-in-law used to say: "Life makes its own plans". What do you want? Can you turn down the radio? I'm not asking you to turn it down, it's just that my wife gets migraines.
- No, she's not coming with us. - I'm not going anywhere with you. - Is this the Scepter of Truth? - Is it? This is a powerful artifact of incalculable value and you're telling everyone we have it.
Why don't I let Dynasty launch it? They can't do that. It's our album, isn't it? - É. - They can do it, little brother. It wasn't determined which label would release it.
You've been shot. Shot in the abdomen. One of the bullets was superficial, just under the skin. The other pierced your spleen and we think it probably hit a rib, because it fragmented. The organ was so badly damaged that we had to remove it.
I have all the reasons. Right. Lana. Mr. Shapiro wanted to meet me at your house, and I assume the disc is there, in a safe. I want you to go there and get it back.
Well, this sensitive information... Sterling! - Yeah, about the disk. - He wants revenge on us. - He wants us to get it back.
- Really? Do you care that if we don't get the disk back we'll have to close the doors? - How does that help? And it was our fault that the disk was stolen. Since we stole it. - Very well...
Thomas Edison! Remember that? When he killed that elephant after sticking a big electric cable up its ass? - The what? - Yes. The kind wizard from Menlo Park bought a docile circus elephant just to kill it.
She wants to play the Czarina in a fundraiser organized by her ex-husband Ellis Crane, the award-winning director and total asshole. He's hot! A total asshole. Wearing that necklace to a crowded event seems like a big risk to me. I know, I know. Believe me, I tried to talk her out of it, but...
He's attractive! A total asshole. Wearing that necklace at a crowded event seems like a big risk. I know, I know. Believe me, I tried to convince her not to wear it, but... Is it just to rub it in his face?
I don't know. Maybe. Look at this. And that, ladies and germs, is the best you can hope for. And if Veronica Deane doesn't get her old ass down here and bring the Czarina, I guess we'll have to look for him!
Come on, wake up! It's the first step towards a national firearms register. It's scaremongering. Nobody has even come close to proposing it. And if they did, it would have to pass Congress.
We can't lose seven votes that we had secured. We won't get them back. - Do we have images of him pledging support? - Of course. Then we'll have to make him feel it.
- Yes, I recognize it. - Is that your handwriting? É. Well, it seems we have a problem. Although the form was signed and delivered by the organization, it was you who filled it out.
Me. - Where was that? - At a tribute dinner. Your compliment seems so sincere. Are you saying it wasn't?
We should retreat again, hold the line, wait and kill them. Is that what you want? Every day we lose meters. Every day we're closer to home. This war won't be just about us if we keep thinking like that, if we lose a meter today and won't get it back tomorrow.
Just give us two minutes. Yes. Have you lost your mind? Did you take my money? Taking money from my strip bar and locking it in a box doesn't make it yours.
Most likely because of the impact of the car. Her right ulna fractured in two places, her lungs were torn apart by fractured ribs and her skull was crushed. - And the baby? - Surgically removed. I don't know if the fetus was still alive when they took it out of her womb, but...
And if we had the means to stop him, and did nothing... then their blood would be on our hands. As an ancient Time Master, you seem to forget that our responsibility is to protect the timeline, not humanity. You wish to carry out a kind of Time manipulation that we are sworn to prevent. And yet, if we allow humanity to perish at the hands of evil, then what kind of universe will we protect? What if, by trying to save the world from Savage, you make it vulnerable to another, even more terrible despot?
That was the beginning. Although Dad started taking photos at a young age, he continued with the hobby throughout his life. He often took portraits of Julie and me, and some of them ended up in the poetry books he published. James T. Kirk. Along came J.J. Abrams, who found a way to bring him to a whole new and different audience.
Thank you, sir. You know what? I left early and... Poltergeist - The Phenomenon. I thought I couldn't see it.
Listen. My mom said she talked to Will. If he's alive, Barbara could be too. That means she's trapped in that place. We have to find him again.
Fuck you. I wish you'd read your poem, Ezekiel. Yeah, I'd rather not. Why not? Because I didn't write it.
I have to ask you something. On Sunday, I'm going to sing a hymn. You know the one that's... What about it? I need to polish it.
Take the money. That's how we are. We get money from Flash to make sure no one does this stupid shit. So. We worked hard for that money, we can't hand it over without a clean fight.
- Shao didn't know, did he? - I'll kick your ass. Lock that shit up. If that body turns up anywhere other than that suitcase, Cadillac will make sure we're the next to go in there. What if the cops find him?
We know how to scratch it without scratching the record. I'd never let anyone ruin your beautiful record, Mylene. Did you really like it? It was more than liking it. I need another copy so I can play it again and again.
the dog saw a cat. I imagine it must have looked like that piece of felt. He ran after it. I've never seen anything as beautiful as that old dog, running. Finally, it caught up with him.
Well... that's all. Thank you very much. That's my daughter! This material is very delicate. Please treat it with great care.
Leon, this is John Weber. He's the lawyer who's going to defend you. I've been asked, but I don't want to. Then why don't you go home? Your case is so bad that no one will take it.
I've just strayed a long way from the path I was supposed to follow. Just like you, I imagine. The narrative you're creating is clearly a huge undertaking. If you need more time, I'm sure the board will be happy to give it to you. I'm sure they'd appreciate it even more if you postponed it indefinitely.
I thought we could play catch with Jock. Did you bring him? Where is he, boy? I'm an evil genius hiding a relay. Where do I hide it?
I can imagine. But I can't talk to you now. I have to go to work. What was that video? Why did you send it?
Sick and, or Bag of Shit. I sent some loving words to his mother. Why such a waste of violence? It came out of me. I couldn't have done it if it hadn't been for you.
I'm going to stay positive. Enough about me. - Let's take a look at that contract. - I'd underline it, but they won't let me have a pencil. I'd underline it, but they won't let me have a pencil.
That's perfect. I should have shown it to you earlier. It's brutal. I like the red too. It's not so much the design that worries me, it's the fact that I found it in the tower.
Is that what you want, to be a teacher forever? No. I'd like to be on the more creative side of things. Actually... I've written an episode of Witchita that's in the back of the drawer and I hope that, one day, maybe I can give it to the right person in production and...
- In the bone. It's the tendon. It's tenosynovitis. The tendon and ligament have suffered from the strain. The tendon is still swollen, as well as what surrounds it, and that's causing the pain. We need to treat it.
My son has broadened the horizons of our furniture company. We've started building coffins. The market, as you can imagine, is painfully strong. We're doing our best to counterbalance that here. Yes, but your army is still doing its best to keep it going.
Wouldn't that make... Wouldn't that make the world a better place? Just make it go away! You know, isn't that our responsibility? You know, when we encounter evil, shouldn't we destroy it?
Do you consider it rebellion to fight injustice when you see it or to stand up to an unjust enemy? Maybe we're not so different after all. Sit down, sit down, sit down... Sit down. There's a better world on the way, although we may not live long enough to see it arrive.
We should have taken the King's money when it was offered to us! But, my dear sir, we have your grain. And Louis will pay you in the usual way. The King demands a gesture. He wants me to give it to the people of Paris.
- That's what you used to say in the school playground to demand a favor. We're not in the school playground anymore, Alison. We haven't been there for a long time. Please? I'm not one of those candidates running for election, telling you how much he hates the government and wants to undo it.
- Yes. Nice plan. Yes, I thought so too. The shoe was covered in blood as evidence for a year. They didn't see it.
Get organized, Mrs. Steale. Oh, shit. These are Kateesha's questions, okay? "You have a lot of money. How did you get it and can I have some?"
- Come in. What do you expect me to do? You're going to take care of me. Let's go. Tell me... who did they steal this pin from? Why did they want it so badly?
Two in the hole. - Sorry, what? - 2 cards in the hole. No, nothing goes in my hole. I don't know what this game is, but we're not playing it today.
Empire S02E17 "Rise by Sin" Thank you, William. Cook, look. Rhonda put me in this dress. It's beautiful, isn't it? What do you think about me wearing it to the ASAs?
- I miss Philadelphia. - We always thought you were a good person. You never forgot the ghetto code. Never. I grew up on those streets, Cookie. That code means more to me than a badge or an oath, so I'm surprised you're hanging out with Lucious when he violated it.
Not that it's any of your business, but I'm taking a break from school. So now you're back in the neighborhood. You've come down to our level. For your information, I live in this neighborhood. I don't consider it a slum.
We have just the thing for you. So you know, I have a criminal record, but... Yes, we have that information. That's not a problem. It's your job, if you want it.
Carl Elias and Anthony Marconi had been my brothers since childhood, and I lost them both in the space of a few months. Anthony's death was duly avenged. Elias saw that. Elias' final chapter has not yet been written. But I can't write it until I know who killed him, which I think you do.
It's a decoy, Miss Groves. It's a fake. The Samaritan planted this bait on Carrick's computer to frame him for Krupa's murder. How adorable, cruel and elaborate. Carrick did this sort of thing back in Ecuador, so it's more than easy to assume that he's done it here.
What I think, Harold, is that it's time we had another chat. Our game of cat and mouse seems to be coming to an end. I don't consider this a game, and it's not over yet. No? You sent the virus, but you didn't activate it.
She looks like a Mormon grandmother, which makes her very good at disguises. Did you hire the woman who caused your divorce? No. I caused my divorce. Sally Price just documented it.
It seems strange here. I've brought a mobile router. Connect it to your laptop and you're done. It's paid for. - Oh my God. - Do you want me to install it?
You can save 40% to 50%... Let's say she was worried about my invisible side... Which isn't the case because she only likes fucking... But let's suppose. How do I show her that I have it?
I apologize for the violence outside. But you must know that I can't let you go. I can't. Khatun had given me a mystery. I couldn't understand it, but I felt it inside me.
Saturn's rings. They sing. That's where you were. I don't think Khatun will give us the fifth movement. I don't think she wants him to have it.
What if, I don't know, we change? No, that's... We won't change like that. No way. Those who want power will always try to control those who really have it.
I know, why do we always try to understand? The future is bleak. Not in the sense of being bad. It's just dark. We can't see it.
We have to come up with something big or we won't survive another winter. Make it look easy. I never said it was going to be easy. The ship. Where would we hide it?
I learned this one from my brother. Wow! Mr. Jarvis! Good morning. Did you catch it with the turtle's furious blow? Oh, is that what he calls it?
I've done my homework on you, Mr. Hunt. I know you served in the Pacific. That means you'll recognize the effects of malaria. Malaria? A particularly contagious one. Developed by an avian parasite by Stark Industries. There's an antidote, but if you refuse to talk, why should I give it to you?
- I wonder what she did. I don't know. Didn't I see her here last week? We didn't change the movie. Why would I watch it again?
She's smart, cunning, and I trust her with my life. I worry that she might get hurt. Hello. I can't believe the boss is letting me go on a mission. He recognizes talent when he sees it.
- Why should I? - Because you're the last option. Grace. I can't even look at Robert. Then look at the sun! He's the reason I don't want to do it.
Display the money and it appears. - I visualize it and it appears? - Yes, money is an energy. It's a flow. You have to say it.
Why are we torturing ourselves? We don't have to do anything. What are you, a beggar? Never let money out of your sight. Do anything to get it.
We're working with digital. What are we missing? How would the president remember such a large number? Not very well. Do you want to bet he wrote it down somewhere?
Get a move on! If we don't take Scorann to his grave, we won't get paid. Where I come from, we have a name for trash like you. Move it! When Slean's horse passed here, someone was riding it.
Is that my phone? Do you have my cell phone? What are you doing? How did you... What? You can't leave it on the desk.
That's why I came here. To be great. Not to hand out sandwiches. Will this cause breast cancer? Will it trigger it?
We'd probably be fine, but the idea, incredible as it may seem, is Gus'. Gus, the tutor. - Gus, the tutor. - Here's what happened. He wrote a script and asked me to read it.
I'm going. It should be me in that grave. This is all my fault. Are you the thief? Kristoff believed this place was self-sustaining, but it never was.
It's out of control! You were right, he's only doing it for the money. You have to leave his mother's house right now, it's not safe. Meet me at Factor's Walk in 15 minutes and take the tablet. We have to get it to the right people before Max finds it.
I did what I had to do. I didn't. Pili, it's me. From a booth. I can't find my cell phone. Maybe the boy took it.
This isn't France, it's the USA. We think the noblesse oblige is a restaurant entrée. There's a book that can help you with that. Sarno? It didn't help. You have to read it for it to help you.
It must be because of this, because of the race. He must be some kind of bully. But why should I call him a murderer? - Why would he write a note? - A note? Do you still have it?
A scenario of mutual loss. - And that doesn't bother you? - Of course, but Axe came out of nowhere. Unconsciously he fears, no, he hopes to go back to having nothing. He likes to put that same fear into others. Especially those who don't know him.
- That's the reason... - They tell us the field is level. But we know it's like a dice table in Tombstone. And it's Bobby Axelrod who's sawing off the legs. Every dollar he earns from fraud, informers or manipulation is a dollar taken from those who earned it honestly.
I'm so sorry. And it hurts so much. It's all right, though. This rabbit is from her childhood. Maybe you can give it to her.
- That's great. - Yes. Yes. It'll be fine. - If I could just keep it down...
We need time. We attack at dawn. Right. We have to sabotage the jeep. If they take it, it doesn't matter how many Terrans they kill.
What's... Everything's fine. The bag blocks the signal. Now we can talk. - Who put it there?
The bracelets are designed to transmit vital signs. Electrical signals from the body. I designed them myself. I know how they work. So you know they have a transmitter. All we have to do is reverse it and we can send an energy pulse to my brain.
General Talbot? I recognized his face. Anton Petrov. Thank your president for organizing this. I think we'll all find it very useful.
- Can I help you? - I'd like to know how you're doing, make sure everything's okay with the van or something. It's not my fault that I took your job, you know? I was given that job. I didn't even ask for it, so...
I was starting to go crazy. Too much fresh air? And wood to chop. How's the warrant coming? I haven't asked for it yet.
What happened? Even John makes better tea than that. Yes, but the milk must be spoiled. Who brought it, John?
-I'll take your shift. -What about the car? -The Fusion. I can reset the odometer. I'll park it in front of your house. But you have to return it by tomorrow night.
It's a long story. But Daisy is so confident in her abilities as an Inhuman that she thinks she can change the future. That's funny. We're trying to do the same... Power is intoxicating, isn't it? And he's right. You only really feel it when you take power away from someone else.
If we listen to the message and make amends, can karma change? Every action has repercussions in time. We can't escape our karma. If you don't want to become a eunuch, stop talking in riddles. However, I imagine we can change it.
Hello, where am I? - Right, where am I? - Coming out of the tracheal artery. - You should see the first fragment. - I didn't see it, did I miss it?
- Coming out of the tracheal artery. - You should see the first fragment. - I didn't see it, did I miss it? It's the size of an iceberg. You can't miss it.
I'm sure it's a Bible, this one will do. Also, I'll need two bottles of your best wine. Wine? Yes, it's a new tradition. What it does is create a circle of protection with the blood of Christ, I have to bless it first.
- What did he tell you about? Donating my eggs. Wait, is that what the injections are for? We have to take a lot of hormones before the procedure. That's why I'm doing it here.
I, along with other colleagues, hold the patent for the original prototype, which we created more than ten years ago. Today, this technology is found in volcanoes all over the world and has revolutionized the way volcanic gas emissions are measured. That's my boy. I'm very happy to see him. I haven't seen him for two years, but here he is and he's still working.
Shut up. We can't move the body. There are drones. Stop it, Lolly. We can't move it.
We can't move our bodies. There are drones. Stop, Lolly. We can't change it. If I told you I've already changed it, would you be calmer?
What are we doing? - I said we're stealing the stage. No. This is your moment. You have to seize it.
- Yes, but... - The doctor will come to you as soon as you've finished the surgery and fitted the cybernetic eye. Surgery? - He wants us to remove... - And replace it with...
My son is dead. Someone is laughing at me and my wife. The day the police spoke to you, Elvira and I were there. I know what I saw. Our son used his cell phone just before Tomás gave that woman a ride on the road, so it's impossible that the cell phone was in the house, unless she brought it.
I don't get paid to go out after you losers. Yes, it is. Get out of here! You'll destroy something like the other kids. My cell phone, I think I left it upstairs.
I know that someone chained me up and wanted me to stay human. I came to school this morning and I thought I was supposed to meet someone. But I can't remember who it was supposed to be. I've been looking for him all day. Whoever he is, I think I love him.
You're still here. Yes, it seems you have some kind of plan. So why don't you tell us about it? I can. It doesn't mean you can do it.
I think this world affects you a lot more than you want to admit. You want to control it, instead of letting it control you.
Or I could always ask my witch to put Finn inside you again and have him finish this. I'm sure he'd be happy to help finish off his brother. I'll do it for you and keep that necklace. Of course, that was the deal. You wanted it, you got it.
I have to take this. I'll check the two cell phones. With 2 illegal accesses, I might be able to trace them back to the common source. How long do you think it'll take? I'll clone Yvonne's cell phone and she'll be able to get it back before she knows she's lost it.
Can I ask you something? What are you going to do after this? I'm going to use the money to finish university. Ezra needed a quiet place to work, so I booked a room. I thought I could include it in the expenses.
- I'm not leaving until we can get back down there, okay? She doesn't even believe it exists. I didn't say that. I'm just trying to understand why she would stalk you. Because she thinks we had something to do with Charlotte's murder. She thinks we know who did it.
Clean blood tests. Prognosis cautiously optimistic. This report is from 8 months ago. My guess is that the Phillips campaign will leak this. They'll make it look like your mother's been keeping it a secret and that she's not healthy enough to serve.
- There was no call. - Were you here all night? No. Then it could have been after you left. There's only one landline and it rings downstairs. If you didn't answer it, and Dr. Rollins had already left, then it must have been Charlotte who answered the phone and spoke to someone for three minutes.
Did you tell Yvonne to leave her cell phone at lunch? Yes. To prove to her that she shouldn't trust me? That's what I told her. - Yes, but you never told her I took it.
I haven't even been able to talk to her. Look, you're already inside the Phillips' computer. Can't you just... corrupt the file? Can you delete the report? They can't say anything, because they shouldn't have it in the first place.
I'm curious about the process. How does it work with the two of you? We're still working it out. Really? I was hoping you'd already decided.
I just came to invite you to dinner and wish you luck. And maybe press just a little. I have to make decisions for next year's production and I don't like having that kind of commitment without a manuscript in hand. Even if it's a draft. I need to see some kind of finished draft and I need to see it fast.
You wanted to believe that the army had fixed me. I'm your brother, but I'm not like you. I didn't want to be in the military like you did. You saw the world as something to be repaired. I only saw it as broken, so I got enough to survive in it.
Unless someone owes you money. Do you recognize this fine gentleman? Darhk has such an idol. Do you give him your power? He just channels it.
- Should I? - The sonic device is gone It's explained. Doctors, nurses, orderlies. Wait a minute. Do you think someone took it?
- It's all so sexy. - What did you do with the attic? Well, when I slept here the other night, I realized what a beautiful space it is. So I dragged a few things up and turned it into a nice little haven. I even made it even more spectacular by stealing a real street sign.
Listen, the other night was great, but... it was a mistake. - You're right. - Jeez, what? Yes, I mean, there was definitely some kind of connection between us, but... I felt it too, but... maybe in another life, right?
I found something with you, something wonderful... I found love. That thing the Time Masters always taught us to hide, but they were wrong, Rip. Love is not a threat. It's beautiful and powerful, and once you know it... love changes everything.
Can you change their DNA and make them inhuman? - And all at the same time? - Two blows at once. That creative part was my idea. Well, let's get to the moment of truth. The world fears our power because not everyone has it.
To make them feel safe in our alliance. I never thought they would use it against him. But they did. I walked the Earth for 4,000 years, trying to free him from prison, only to get it wrong again. Because I knew you had him.
- Joe. - Mr. Corbin. What happened, Mr. Corbin? I was the one who, years ago, told the human servants about the power of the Emblem. I knew you had it.
Yes, Holy Father. It's time for your snack, Holy Father. - My snack? - Yes, your snack. Right, that's what she calls it.
If I have sinned through presumption, I ask your forgiveness here. And if I have deceived poor Don Tommaso, I ask for your forgiveness here. If I have frightened people, I ask for your forgiveness. If I have wished evil on Spencer and Dussolier, I ask you to send me the same evil. If I have abused my power, I ask you to take it from me now!
I did. What did you send me? The piece you lost from your pipe. The piece I gave you before I left you. How did you know I'd lost it?
How did you know I'd lost him? Sometimes I called your orphanage. They told me that you kept one piece of the pipe with you, but that you had lost the other. How did you find that piece? I had already lost it when they left me there.
In the previous episodes... - We got him. - The Hive? He has to be destroyed. The Hive can create a virus that turns all humans into influenced Inhumans. If I can find a way to disperse it high up in the atmosphere.
In Goto, I was completely overwhelmed. I baptized more than a hundred adults and children, and heard countless confessions. But it was Kichijiro that I felt the greatest need for. You didn't accept the rosary. I didn't deserve it.
He even shook my hand. And he clearly said he was going to play for us. He didn't keep his word. Azhar, you've made the biggest mistake of your life. This game is my life. I won't let anyone addict it.
But don't you also claim to be a king, my dear? That's true. It's more appropriate. However, the king is the most important and weakest piece in the game. It gets into trouble when the defenses abandon it.
Niklaus isn't the only one inspiring revenge fantasies. Right now, we're all at risk. So while Marcel tries to get the White Oak back, I recommend we dispense with all that attitude. And deepen our family ties, the good old-fashioned way. I'm pretty sure this bottle hasn't been washed in the last decade, which makes it the cleanest thing in this establishment.
In negotiations, there comes a time when the weaker party submits. You're approaching yours very quickly. Have the Sisters help resurrect Kol. I swear he'll give us the missing ingredient. Otherwise, you may never find it.
One for a friend, one for an enemy and one for a relative. What the hell did I just see? Vincent said he had a way of extracting Aurora's serum. I was busy at the time, but if Vincent really did steal the serum, if he... If he gave it to Marcel...
We taught Marcel to read with this very same copy. Cool. Well, he's not here, so... He's dead. The serum. No. Marcel didn't take it because of me.
I think there's a way to kill Lucien. Which way? While Davina is trapped between worlds, I can use her as a vehicle to channel power from the Ancestors. The same power used to create Lucien. Once I've done that, I can make Lucien mortal again.
What if I'm a risk? I've been training on bags, but in a real fight? Cami, you need to know something about fear. If you have to do what you're afraid of, then all that fear will be useless. Either you turn it into anger or you leave it at the entrance, either way, you control your emotions.
And he can talk to you through that necklace? Here, at the Institute? It's like when I saw Dot. It's a fragment of a Gate. That's why your mother made sure you had it.
- Luke will need you if he wakes up. - When he does. - I'll go. - I'll go. Jace, what happened to you? Luke's car ran into a pole while he was hiding it. I don't know how to drive mundane cars.
Zed is dead. Zed is dead. - Well, can you fly? - Easy! Do you mind if we take him?
I take an apparent fall, pretend to grab the referee's ass, turn around and pretend to be embarrassed. The crowd starts laughing. They start to get excited. For me, the important thing is that sound. The sound of the crowd. You can't hear it in your head, but you know there's a sound.
That's the worst story I've ever heard. You don't understand. Yes, the boy was devastated. But he realized that his father was right. He had been told to tame the bird, not to love it.
With what money? We don't have a job. Don't look at me. If there's no work, I can't give work to anyone, right? There is work, but it only goes to the older inmates.
Of course. You're right. Did you hear that? It's the irrigation system. Your father will be upset if we leave it on all night.
It was never difficult to find you. That's not what I asked. At least you have better furniture. I liked my old futon. I liked debuting it.
This trial is not about vigilantes. It's about the failure of the justice system. And how one man, Frank Castle, is being used as a pawn to cover up the mistakes of that system. The prosecution wants blood. But, as the judge said, to get it, you have to have proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
Did Karen choose you? Why did she choose it? People who don't know anything about guns choose a shiny weapon. Sometimes with a crafted handle. There's always some idiot who buys a cannon with a hell of a kick and is afraid to use it.
We have the same enemy. If Carter is released, you'll lose her. But he wouldn't be the first woman you've lost either, would he? I really have to improve our security around here. It was very easy to get around the system considering I designed it.
Thanks to your efforts, Vandal Savage didn't go to prison for selling a nuclear weapon in 1975. You prevented the Soviet Union from winning the Cold War in 1986. Carter Hall's death provided Savage's closest lieutenants with unnaturally long lives. You and your team have been moving along the course of Time. We just redirected it and you... to the ends that history required.
It seems your friends have abandoned you. How long do you think you can maintain power without the Time Masters to help you? Not for long, I'm afraid, but they provided me with a time ship. I don't need to rule the world anymore, Chay-Ara. I now have the ability to change it.
- Right. Here I go. - I have a question before you jump. You know, I'm trying to understand heat. It's a new concept for me. And you, dear Ricky, are the perfect person to explain it to me.
- That container. Didn't you hear what I just said? The container is gone. I heard you. So why aren't we out there to get it back?
The container is gone. I heard you. So why aren't we outside to retrieve it? Why the fuss? I suppose if someone wanted it badly enough to steal it, then maybe they should keep it.
It must be the third-degree burns. I can't believe it's gone. We found out what your father never told you. He was going to leave you the restaurant. If you still want him to.
I'm not a thief, I'm an actor, Louie slim. I had a role in "Five is Too Many", look it up. I love L.A. Even a homeless guy has a page on IMDb. Can you explain why you'd pawn Tim Dunlear's championship ring? Listen, and more importantly, why did you take it to a pawn shop?
So you two are going to stay in a cell while... Very well. Tommy Campolongo. That makes sense. That way he'll have cash. But he won't hand it over peacefully. I'm leaving the station now.
If Malcolm sees you, he'll kill her. I'm sorry... But I can't risk it. Her life is at stake. Right. So you'll just get him to kill both of you, right? He needs this money to get out of town. I won't give it to him until she's safe.
Which reminds me... your presence is no longer necessary. You can thank my agents for completing their mission. Their idealism will be the ruin of this planet. No. It's what will save it.
It's been a long day. And something tells me it's far from over. Anything on the monster? "Supergirl" has agreed to capture her attacker personally, at great personal cost, I might add. When she does, it will be safe and she can leave.
A purer form? He needs four living souls to consume, and then he'll walk the earth. Four souls, one for each corner of hell, where you are trapped. After that, you'll be free of your suffering and you'll be free to walk the Earth. So how do we beat him?
I know exactly what they do. They scratch each other's balls and play Call of Duty: Guantanamo. Can you believe the sanitary towel situation? I've got a wad of toilet paper so far up my crack, I don't know if I'll be able to get it out.
Of the cases of infidelity involving a Synthetic, 66% of those targeted responded that the major obstacle to reconciliation was an imbalance in the perception of the impact and importance of the act of infidelity. - Are you using statistics? - Why not? We're not the only people in the world going through this. And I don't think you realize what this has meant to me. And you know what? I still don't think I understand why you did it.
"I can't get them to call me again." Well, take a dildo, put it behind the child support, and you'll have to cut off communications because that man will never let go of you. Yes... After you get him shaking... Don't be silly and don't put it on full speed.
When... When Jeanette arrived, she didn't... She brought the yellow cup that... She didn't want to kick the ball, but I said... Because Brian's glass is red, so... If you... If you don't have it...
Is it that good? It does everything. Believe me, I've become a fan of the elastic waistband. I thought that with the weight I've lost since leaving hospital, I'd be able to pull it off. Now I don't even know if I'll be able to take it off.
You don't understand. The real reason is drugs. He's carrying drugs up his ass. Listen to this. She must have a guy who comes to visit her and gives her a long, passionate kiss, but instead of giving her tongue, he gives her a packet, you know? She has to swallow it because after the visit she is searched naked and her orifices are checked while she says "Ah".
We needed to know that. Why would we need to know that? Because I couldn't bear the thought of you looking at me the way you're doing right now. Just look, we have your money! I won't be able to spend it if I'm locked up in a German jail.
I already know everything, so I know that the two of you are already intimate. I've dealt with problems like that before. Radicals who think my magazine is perverse and not what it really is. But you'll get over it, and you'll continue to do a good job, but only if you do it together.
Uh, I don't know. I don't think so. No. Why? Because the juice was outside, on the counter. Okay, well, maybe someone left it out last night.
Okay, I have to go. I'll see you at school. - Did you touch the vase? - No. Maybe Miguel took it.
- Did you touch the vase? - No. Maybe Miguel took it. He was here. Why would he take it?
It's possible that he made a deal with them, that he brought them to the New World to finish the job. Carla, they gave me a new drug. - You could say it's experimental. - What is it? I'll have to look into it.
I know it was a big wooden crate. My job was to deliver it to a Sanjay Desai. That's who you should ask. - But you're the one we have. - I'll take you where I left it.
I just want to put this down here. I'm going to take revenge for what they did to us. This book is bait. You want the Master? He'll come for whoever has it.
The Born. Was it him? He could be handing him over to the Elders. Or worse, the Master. - We have to get him back.
And we would never betray them. That ring again. I don't understand. Where did you find it? I took it from a Berserker who was sent to kill me.
-Where to? I'll go in your place. Go to Saint Denis Cathedral where Francisco is buried. Find the embalmer who removed the king's organs. Ask him if the liver was already black when he took it out, if not...
That might cheer you up. Holy shit! I can't believe we have so much money. - Is it nice? - It will be when I deposit it, but... - I've got a lot of shit to do.
How does this work? Theoretically, the Connaver device was on Arkyn, so it should absorb the radiation signature. The radiation can't be seen with the naked eye, but those lenses will translate it into something you can see. Look for something red... well, assuming the device is really here. I've already seen it.
So you had it repaired? No, I hate anything damaged, no matter what. Did you throw the suit away? No, I gave it away. I took it one night when I was walking along the Seine, as usual, and gave it to a beggar.
So, how was your vacation week? Jamaica was amazing. - I got all my groove back. - Oh, right. But I think I left it on the plane.
In my English essays I stole lyrics from obscure songs that old Mr. Fottrell would never know. Very good. But it was my joke. No one else knew the song or even cared. Everyone at Wood Hill College was obsessed with rugby. And I didn't hate rugby, but what would happen if I didn't love it?
You need to keep a clear head, okay? What's tormenting you? Sir... Sometimes it feels like I'm a robot, doing everything over and over again. Maybe life is more than... You have a rare gift and you need to use it.
Enough! I've said it! Did you hear me? Fuck it. We all have something we're ashamed of. A memory of a moment so embarrassing that we don't know if we'll ever forget it.
I thought you'd think it was cool. You can't judge me, didn't your girlfriend break up with you? I'm sure she did. Hello, Harry. If the app lets you watch the whole city, why don't you use it to find a girl?
Hello. We have to get out of here. If Vorza escapes, he'll bring an army. All right, then. We have to get the body out of here before they see it.
It's up to you. Do you think they're keeping the Carsons here? I doubt it. This camp is open. It would be difficult to get the hostages in and out of here without the whole tribe knowing.
As soon as the price dropped, everything fell apart for him. Gox was going to go bankrupt. That it lasted as long as it did was a stroke of fate. But its failure was that it didn't have the normal, boring institutional controls that are necessary to make it progress. A lot of money has been lost. Nobody knows if they lost it, if it was stolen by them, if they embezzled it. But the important lesson from Gox is not that Bitcoin doesn't work.
Allah Akbar! Behold! The only thing bigger than you. If you feel it slowing down, just give it a little touch. You won't hurt him.
Were you talking about my mustache again? No, Manny. We love your moustache. That's funny. They say they like it now that I've cut it off!
She won't budge and now I have to take away her lubricant. She can't go out into the world with palm oil. She can't. I know you're upset, but we made a contract. We have to break it.
Not for me. Listen, did you get my message? I need my samovar for the party. You mean my samovar? I was the one who found it at the Rose Bowl in 1999.
"Dear Frankie, I've been told that these brushes are the same ones Picasso used to paint Guernica. If that's not the case, I want you to know that I had a lot of fun sleeping with two Spaniards to get them. The postcard is the most important thing, anyway." Oh my God! LOTUS GALLERY THE PAINTINGS OF FRANKIE B. "I've rented the space in the gallery, you just have to fill it.
- Really? - After I invited him. He's a collector. He's a fan. And he has been since... "Since the day he bought it off the wall in Sol's office."
Good afternoon, ma'am. Terry Bausch, from Bausch Greenhouses. I'm here about the broken sprinkler. I think you should pay more attention. Do you think you can fix it?
According to the latest information, the agent has been identified as Influenza "A" with type 7 Hemagglutinin and type 2 Neuraminidase, i.e. H7N2, a bird flu, which, until now, was not known to be transmissible between humans. It seems that the genome of this virus has been manipulated to make it highly pathogenic and capable of being transmitted between humans. We discovered a vial among Patient Zero's things that had traces of a biological agent. We have to assume that he brought it into the country and into the hospital, where it infected Doctor Sanders.
It's the girl from the food delivery. She didn't have any identification. She told the agent that her name was Sara. I'll put the teddy bear away with the other belongings. Maybe someone will recognize it when this is all over.
Savage still has Carter and Kendra. This is a time ship. A little gift from our friends. I no longer need to rule the world. Now I have the ability to change it.
What do you mean you don't have any money? I was going to sell a nuclear warhead and pay you with the profit. - Things have changed. - Do you expect... I'd give you the meteorite for free? No, I expected to have to take it from you by force.
Harry, the safe has the initials "KS". - "Kirsch-Sekur". I know the model. - Good. - Show Alfred how to open it.
It's just a suit. But it's the wrong suit. Realizing his discomfort and trying to spare him, I tried to improve the situation. If I were as decorated as you, I'd wear my uniform all the time. I wouldn't take it off.
One day you'll write your memoirs and there will be a woman's name on every page. The money from the jewelry? Where is it? I'd love to give you the money, really. Unfortunately I don't have it, my partner... My partner has it.
So you ran away. We wanted to go to the border, but Bastien made us come back here because of the gold. He said it was our only way out. And now we have nothing left as a reward for four bloody years of war! But they don't remember where they hid it.
Yes, of course we remember. In the caves. But it's gone! Whatever they do to me, they'll come back. They... won't leave... until they find him.
I imagine that such an invention will make memories easier to bear. I'll shoot. Death will come slowly. The gold. I want you to bring it.
He was generous with you. That's a pardon. He dishonored me by appointing that boring soldier as Regent. The King's will is complex. Tréville thinks you'll want to see it.
- He left her, just like that. No warning, no explanation, nothing. But Peter isn't cruel. There must be a reason. If there is, he never told Genevieve.
We don't need dicks. Let's get divorced and I'll find a lawyer to get my money back. Even with the divorce, you won't see the color of the money. - Really? - It's in tax havens - and no one will find it.
The obligation to be true to the subject. For Polly. - I don't understand. - I don't want to tell you everything. Mr. Waxcap, I'll never read it.
Or maybe she couldn't see him anymore. And despite feeling a diabolical temptation, I refrained from pushing the issue with her. Although it's safe to assume that, in the category of endings, Polly's was pretty ugly. But Polly wasn't going to tell me and I couldn't just make something up. So I didn't write it down.
Hello? I arrived in the first days of August, hired to look after Mrs. Blum. That year's winter was exceptionally warm and by February, all that remained of the snow on the roadsides was almost black. It rained too much in the spring, and the fruit on the trees weighed down the ends of the bent branches. The sun in the summer months was excessively hot, and burned my bare shoulders whenever I left it.
Well, what's not cheap is that necklace you're wearing around your neck. It's beautiful. Did Darryl buy it for you? We know he had a lot of money when he died. He didn't spend it on me.
Maybe you saw it on Pinterest or something that I sent to my friend and she sent it to you every day." Let me tell you. If a man has a Pinterest page, he's probably interested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought the wedding dress the following Tuesday because I had tried it on in 2012.
- Go quickly. - Cisco! Let's go. Let's finish this. This is how I stole Flash's speed. He just needs to run, and the acceleration force will transfer to the bottle, but only if I calibrate it.
Do you really believe that? That guy isn't the devil and you have to stop him no matter what, right? Yes, I do. -Then don't you know you can't come with me? You... you and I don't always agree, but have you realized where evil is, and where the only way to defeat it can come from, from God or some other way that I can't see?
For God's sake, Edward, what's going on? - The money's gone. - Gone where? From this desk, stolen. Someone broke the lock and took it.
Come here. Where do you think I'm from? I don't know. - From a place with money? - We had money until my grandmother lost it in the game, and now we only have bonds.
- You can't stop a tide, Chip. - Change is inevitable. - All right, then. Even if I gave you the four million, the hotel project would still go ahead. - Yeah, I already stopped it once.
We ran to the water, called 112. At first we thought she had killed her husband. So you don't believe in this lake monster? We sell some items that suggest it exists. - But have I seen it? No.
You're famous in this book. It says you're the Mother of the Revolution. "Khalil and the Red Hand." - Do people read that? - Everyone reads it.
There's not much I can do. We've given you access. I need more than what I'm getting. You're supposed to tell me what people want. People didn't know they wanted jazz until they heard it for the first time.
This is a domestic investigation. We have to work with the FBI. They're sending a team and I'd like Homeland Security and the CIA to join in. This is a sensitive program. Shouldn't you keep it secret?
He'll only serve as bait. I can't allow you to speak on behalf of the White House. They said they wanted me. -Yes, we have a course mapped out. -Then you have to adjust it.
If they wanted to, they wouldn't have released two hostages. They're looking for an excuse to go back. If the press shows this video, I'll look like a traitor. We tell them it's a precondition. If they share it, the deal is off.
- That's a lot. - Please! Stop doing that. This is real. Kevin has a problem and he has to face it.
I can offer you coffee, but don't ask for a cup. Your brother will get his ass kicked. You know that, right? I don't like what Aguirre is doing to the Rayburn name. He wants everyone to think of Danny when they hear him, not John.
- No, just a thank you for your kind recommendation. - Good, you've found somewhere you like. - I have. And I wouldn't have found it without your help, thank you.
I confess I thought he'd come to New York for that. He disappeared and wanted to repair his relationship with Sherlock. There's another matter I'd like to discuss with you. For some time now, I've been saving my blood for emergencies. And I've found a local facility that does this service. I was hoping that, given your medical background, I could ask you to evaluate it.
Hello? It's time to open the package. Now? The senator has the same bottle in her purse. You have to exchange it for the one you have.
I have an old friend in the Company who could arrange an unofficial meeting, but it's no small favor. It's the least you can do for the new branch leader. - It's happening. - When they set up the meeting, the CIA will take the employee to a safe house. That will give us the opportunity to get him out and hand him over to the terrorist, just as you asked.
A mother, she... she... didn't survive. - That's terrible. - Yeah. This day is full of terrible things. Let's hope Amelia can save him.
Yeah, but... how are we going to do that without revealing why? Well, they don't have to know about the monsters, right, to know it was self-defense. Hill hired assassins. They cost money, so there has to be - a paper trail somewhere. - Even if there is, we'll never find it.
- Are you sure? Yes. You won't believe it. A fatality due to a wolf attack. Has anyone seen him since?
And I need to know what happened out there. Who the hell are you? Sammy, I need answers! My grandmother had a lot of secrets, and I know she kept a diary. I just need to find it.
He seemed normal for a fanatic. Did he leave you a card? Any contact information? There was a flyer talking about a meeting of the group. Do you still have it?
There was a flyer about a meeting of the group. Do you still have it? No, I threw it away. Do you recognize this? Yes. It was on the flyer, I'd never seen it before.
- Yes. Who owns it? - Isn't that Krispin's car? - No. The DMV hadn't registered it.
What are you doing? I'm counting the money. We should have left it on the boat. We should have left it on the damn boat. Why did we bring it?
He rented a car. - From the airport. - Yes. Where is it? I didn't see him outside.
-Archduke Forlay. -Yes, of course. I'm very unhappy about this. Thank you for the gift. I'll think of your mother whenever I wear it.
That won't get you the answers you're looking for. And I don't think you want to deal with another murder charge either. The client will contact you. He'll tell you what the next test will be. What if I don't?
We can see you over her left shoulder. Can you hear me? Agents, stay at your posts. Dr. Reid will give the green light. Don't move until he does.
What does he want? He's after that crystal you found. Our parents hid it for a reason and if Phears wants it so badly, it must have been a very good reason. Like world domination. Max, we have to hide that crystal again, where Phears won't find it.
What's going on, Max? If I told you, you wouldn't believe me. Try it. I found the crystal in a box in my house. It was put there by some scientists who used it to trap an evil ghost, but it escaped and possessed the body of a TV presenter in the old Grover mansion.
You look great. Thank you very much. You too. I like your jacket. I've just bought it.
Val... I have to approve it, don't I? Clary, watch this ad, it's hilarious. - Yes, it is. - It's so bad it makes it good.
What's that ring? It looks like you're talking to someone. And I bet I know who. Valentine. That explains how he deactivated the Punishment rune, but not where he got the ring. Do you think someone slipped it through the barriers?
Come on, she'll be fine. You know you're not going in there. What if they find out the code? - They won't. - How do you know? I changed it.
The Spanish drained the lake. Of course, all they found were trinkets. So they killed all the natives and El Dorado came to represent the fantasy of infinite fortune. - And that's what's in the package. - I don't understand. But it will, as soon as we steal it from the FBI.
The twin gods of Fillory go bad and take everything away. Yes, that's it. But they have their reasons. That's what happened to the manuscript. For some reason, I didn't deserve it.
Can I give you some advice in return? - Yes, I can. - Forget about that school. The world has never helped smart girls. Why should it?
Let's talk. You've reached our level, it's time. It wasn't a joke. I don't want to point out the obvious, but we're pushing the limits of what's magically possible. We want to reach the glass energy ceiling, so we can break it.
Password lock. Monty, we're at the suspect's apartment. Can you hack into his computer? Okay, I need you to look at the back of the router for me. I've already found it.
I've been chasing "Mr. Almond Praline" for years and you caught him in one day. What do you have to say? - I have eyes to see. - No. I know a talent when I see one, and you're one.
It looks like it's been damaged or something. Yes, or someone tampered with it by swapping the jackets. It doesn't seem likely. Boyle and I are going to follow the jacket's chain of custody to see if we can find anything suspicious. The NYPD had it first, and only then passed it on to us.
Or someone claiming to be him. I was going to meet him tonight. How is the incrimination process going? We managed to track Morra's jacket from the crime scene to the evidence control unit. So nobody tampered with it.
It's like 3D printing, but they make tissues and organs. Gordon was an investor. Are you saying that your husband had a kidney that was 3D printed? The first to be made. That explains why someone would want it.
He didn't want to kill me. Houston pulled him out of the deep end, he saved him. We can't rule anything out. Maybe there's something in the book about his medical history. Do you still have it?
This thing? It's incomparable. Well, I'm not into that. I make a point of never trying the product. I just give it to my students.
But money always speaks louder, and that's how we got here. This guy is called Ades. Draw your own conclusions. But thanks to my job at Datavision, I knew how to deal with the toughest customers. Have you considered that the drop in sales could be down to your name? I can see why you chose it, it's powerful, and I love it.
- Yes. - What do you have to offer? Well, I'm not a biochemist, but I do know the chemical compound that makes NZT NZT. No one is producing legal drugs with this compound in the numbers required to supply this outbreak. If you find the compound and who buys it in large quantities... Even a more or less decent investigator could find the lab that produces it.
Because it's a decisive result. Say "yes". Yes! We want you to make the change, but this is something temporary. We don't just want to solve your problem, we want to deal with what created it in the first place.
Doing something for myself that scares me is unprecedented. "Doing something for myself that scares me." This young woman says: "The goal of life is to find love and happiness, to do something for others and to do something for myself that scares me." What else do I need to do? I have to give love to those who don't have it.
"Doing something for myself that scares me." This young woman says: "The purpose of life is to find love and happiness, to do something for others and to do something for myself that scares me." What else do I need to do? I have to give love to those who don't have it. "I have to give love to those who don't have it."
She taught you that you didn't have to do anything to be loved. That you should have everything you needed. He's a beautiful man with a big heart, but he screwed you over. He made you think you were entitled to everything. You're not, and you're confused and question why. He made you stop giving love if you didn't get it, because you were never afraid of losing it, because he always gave it to you.
Better dead than alive, right? I don't think there's anything else up there. We're missing something. Just like with the key maps. The X was right in front of us, but we didn't see it until we thought differently.
Holy water pipes? No. No, nothing like that. The ancient Ritual of the Bacabs. And if we do it right, maybe we can expel Amaru's soul and save Katy-Kakes.
- Body language. - Right. - Body language. - It's a subconscious thing. But the thing is, sometimes I play with my hair, I do that sort of thing, but it's just to get it out of my face.
- What do you think? - It's beautiful! It's a little present for your new room. Thank you. - Where are we going to put it? - Up there, maybe.
Which apartment does she live in? I'll talk to her. She's in number 17. You know, if you're going back there, could you bring my belt? It's reversible, so I didn't want to lose it.
Take my tool belt. Use the linoleum blade that doesn't need sharpening. And then hold the opening with some precision tweezers and use the adjustable pliers to put the muscle back into position. Very good, very good. Now you're saying I have to suture it.
Following this, a cross-party delegation was sent to the city on an urgent fact-finding mission. They recommended that clean air areas be set up in London as a preventative measure. -I've never seen that report. -For good reason. Our Prime Minister dismissed it, saying it wasn't a priority.
What if I don't go? Will they... Will they shoot me? You already know what my vote is. Walker, we've got it.
Why do they keep coming back to Nethermoor? For the hospitality? It's the closest place. Maybe you're right. Maybe they don't have lead on their planet and they come here to extract it.
If you don't do something, he will. Jack, I don't usually go outside to drink my coffee, but when I do, it's because I feel the need to be alone. Well, I came out here because I knew you wouldn't want anyone to hear what I had to say. Did you come to tell me that you couldn't do the job? No, I came to tell you that if you want me to do it, you'll have to open your purse strings.
I didn't get the department. No kidding. They said we're in no position to steal from anyone. That's exactly what they said before they offered me a job. So you've come to tell me you've taken it.
Gloria Danner. Mrs. Danner, a few years ago, your son Clifford was convicted of murder and sentenced to prison, - isn't that right? - Yes. For a crime he didn't commit. How do you know he didn't do it if he was convicted?
I think you're forgetting the file you gave me, the one with the little legal indiscretion that Daniel Hardman knew about you. There's no need for euphemisms, Jessica. It wasn't an indiscretion. It was a brazen crime. And the problem with using it is that you'll be announcing to the world that yet another crime has happened in front of you and you've done nothing to stop it.
And the customers who were willing to stay before will no longer be. That's what I'm going to miss the most. Miss what? Coming home to see you. Rachel, I know I should have told you what I was going to do before I made the deal, but I didn't know I was going to do it and I had about three seconds to make the decision.
- the nausea, the distraction, the temper. - Yes. With everything that was happening, I... I mean, I think I knew, but I couldn't... I bought a pregnancy test three weeks ago and threw it away before I used it.
Call Mr. Kaplan from the car. We need to find Gerald Sullivan. Our metallurgist decomposed the lead found in William Dowd. A specific dye was used to darken the gray scale. - Can you trace it?
I don't want his protection, nor do I want your money. - The money isn't for you. - It's very generous. I can see that it comes from your concern. But it's dirty money and I don't want it.
What happened? I've just had a visit from the White House advisor. We have bigger problems than saving the Caretaker's daughter. Two known terrorists have penetrated the border through the Port of Tampa. Two hours ago, a cargo truck was stolen from a company near the port and whoever took it was smart enough to turn off the tracker.
A note for a debt. All those lives at risk and you only helped to make me help you. What do you want? The Caretaker's book. I'd like to borrow it.
Maybe she was just unlucky. Why didn't it start? What do you mean? It starts perfectly. I guided it onto the van myself.
We're having a baby. I love you. You're going to do great. Except this isn't how I imagined the birth of our baby. How did you imagine it?
It wasn't fair, after all you've done for me. I didn't do anything for you, Lizzy. I'm scared for my little girl. I'll inject the medication. It's the children the world almost breaks who grow up to save it.
Look around you. You call this living? After losing my daughter, I crawled, crawled into the desert, like a mortally wounded animal. I ran as far away from the pack as possible, to bide my time, to bide my time until I died. If you've come looking for a survival manual, you won't find it here.
My employer paid you to kidnap Keen. And not only did you fail to deliver the target, you caused her death. Then you went after me to get a bargaining chip with my boss, who wants her dead. Calm down, Benjamin. I called to offer your employer an olive branch. But if you don't want it, I'll be happy to shove it up your ass.
Have you heard? About the money? Please... Please tell me you know what happened. I know exactly what happened. - I'm the one who stole it.
The laundry couldn't remove the blood stains. I'm going to have to try more extreme measures. I didn't think I was going to catch him. Joan said she was in a meeting. I came to return the book she'd lent me. Did she need your help to take it upstairs?
The attack took place when she was already wearing her seatbelt, so the killer must have been waiting for her in the back seat. It wasn't a robbery. She has her jewelry and they didn't touch her purse. What I don't see is a cell phone. Because she was holding it when the killer attacked.
Of course they did. I would have done the same. If Sandstorm is half as good as you say, they'll search it. - The tracker was invisible. If they found it, they'd kill her.
Do you happen to know how narcotics work? - As a matter of fact, I do. - Yes? So you have a preparation plan? I'd like to see it.
As close to the garden as we can get. Okay? Will you tell everyone? Don't you trust me to take the juice? I don't think you're going to steal it, Nicky.
The computer. Of course, the computer. Yes. That's why we came here. We'll pack it up, label it and take it to the lab. I'll find a garbage can, laundry basket, bread basket, something to carry it in.
It's 200 dollars. I was wrong about you. You're a more or less good person. More or less. Well, and even though you brought evil into the world, you didn't get in my way while I was cleaning it up, so I guess you're also a half-demon, half-cool person.
A few days ago, Zomo received an anonymous message. It threatened to reveal his identity if he didn't meet him in Carroll Park at 4am. - How did you know who he was? - I don't know. But he said that when he got there, the guy only handed over a sketch. And he said he wanted him to paint it for a show.
I've done everything you asked. Your boss asked for the tapes. I didn't even know she... And how do you know that? Delete the file before she sees it.
I'm glad you moved the basketball hoop away from the house. Yes, those things are an invitation for thieves to get in. Or for murderers like Nina to escape. We always kept the basket there. It was Nina who put it up.
Or for murderers like Nina to escape. We always kept the basket there. It was Nina who put it there. Yes, we only realized what she'd done the day after the murder. How are you sure Nina put it there?
Promise not to tell my wife? I was in the basement smoking pot with Chip Evans and Lester Davis. I lied because I promised my wife I'd quit smoking. It's just that... I've been very stressed lately. -Please tell me you've solved it.
What's the problem? Is it the chisel? Difficult to handle for one-handed people. Or is it writer's block? I'm not going to do it.
- I know you looked here. And you think we missed something? You can sift this sand through a fine sieve and find nothing new. Well, I lost a cufflink here in 1907. If one of your boys finds it, let me know.
Has anyone found anything? - I belong here. - And she's here. You can sift this sand with a fine sieve and find nothing new. Well, I lost a cufflink here in 1907, in case one of your boys finds it.
Fake. Just for show. Hello. Sorry, I didn't catch your name. My boss never uses it.
And if this came out, it would destroy her career. I was thinking about that. So as long as Jordan had this video, he had Starlee in his hand. Absolutely. Ravi made a video of me snoring, and I was on the verge of ripping out every follicle in my beard if I hadn't deleted it.
Does it hurt? No. Don't move. Are you all right? I've penetrated the device, which means that the slightest movement will cause it to burst.
No threatening messages or reply messages, but there was one thing. J.P.? - Cell phone number? - It was on speed dial. He called that number two days ago and didn't do it before or after, as far as we know.
- We need a name. No name, just a number. You send a message, a child arrives on a bicycle, you pay and don't ask any questions. We need that number, if you don't mind. I love my job more than anything in the world and I don't want to lose it, but I would never kill Zoe to keep it.
Ah, JP, any luck with the laptop? A hotel guest found it while swimming underwater. The killer must have thrown it into the sea. It's badly damaged. Have someone from the lab pick it up and see if they can recover anything from the disk.
Did he? Jay didn't mention that. See if there's anything you can elaborate on, please. It's Zoe's phone. It looks like she programmed it.
I have this one-in-a-million photo of Zoe's murder, right? Brilliant. But these are the ones taken before and after the killer's photo. I don't know, but there's something about them. Who killed Zoe? How did she do it and why was she holding a 15-denier sock in her left hand when we found her body?
Yes, one second. Hey, what book is that? It's, uh... Philosophy. You know, we should get back to what we were doing. Mind if I take it?
Are you cool, Dwight? I mean, I just said it was happy hour at the Pussy Bar and Dwight can eat for free, and you say no? Is that cool? I haven't finished my work yet. I... I haven't earned it yet.
From the ground? I don't know. It was a baby... It was small, slippery and not at all like gum, Flaca. And when I swallowed it, I felt its little feet, with little fingers.
If you see something strange, something that makes you feel strange, a guy walking his dog twice, you call. It has a preset number. What's going on in there? You said you wanted a job. So you've got it.
Have you changed the code? What's the code? What the fuck is the code? You can't open it again. It's too dangerous, I won't do it.
Right now, it's the only thing keeping us alive. Vanessa will be fine, they can't turn her and they probably won't kill her if they've come this far. Maybe that's the answer. I'm toxic to them. What if we use my blood and disperse it as a chemical weapon?
We have everything we need here. You know the odds out there, and Denver is miles away. Are you really staying here? You're damn right I am. There's no way you'll find this place unless you know it.
He said I'd better obey or he'd hit me again. He drove... He drove for a long time. But I never saw the puppy again. I never saw him. He was so small.
Forget the stupid book. Chasing that thing will only serve to give you a cramp. You don't know what you're talking about. I don't? You're the one who's spent your whole life looking for that book and never found it.
Stop! What's your genius plan for getting the book back? Make tonight one of our epic parties. And the kids who stole your car will show up. We may not be able to find the book, but we can go after those who are looking for it. - Mommy.
We were surrounded by other boats. We were scared, but surviving. The hull cracked when we left Long Beach Harbor. We panicked. We thought we had repaired it.
It's not always like that, sometimes they're quick... I'm going to smoke in my room. - Special day. - Motherfucker. If we put this "loop" into Hendricks' coder and then attach it to the routine we tried to use.
It's hard to fuck up. I added a different library and it went off like a rocket. But you only process the changes? - That's really cool. - I thought so too, that's why I wrote it down.
This one really likes to keep score. I'll get the documents and my Montblanc. Setback! I found the woman with the record. But she doesn't want to sell it. It seems she's already given it to her elderly father and has arranged with Geek Squad to set it up this afternoon.
Can I have my hard disk? No... You big asshole! Oh, shit! You'll have to replace it...
He doesn't want to talk to you. We're not leaving the hotel. Neither are you. There's work to be done. We have to come together to do it.
- Give the money back! - Yes! - Sorry. - Yes! I can't... because I don't have it.
Apparently, she paid Barrios to bring her mother. I think she's one of the people Petty Officer Ortega helped. Yes. So maybe he found out about the scheme from her. And Barrios killed him so as not to expose him.
There is beauty in this world. Arnold made it that way, but people like you keep spreading like stains. I don't know who this Arnold is, but your world was built for me... And for people like me. Not for you. So someone has to clean it up.
The publisher says it will take at least six weeks to get them into bookstores... Who said we needed bookstores? Several pages from the former First Lady's memoirs appeared today on the D.C. website. Dish. Both the publisher and Senator Grant have denied being the source of the leak. The book, however, is being described by those who have read it as explosive, revealing, and deeply personal.
No way. Are you kidding? Let me ask you. I don't know what you do. If I gave you a disgusting pink liquid, there was a sink and I told you to spit it out, would you know where to spit it out?
You're alive! If you want to know what you're hearing, it's me, Dr. Tobias M. Curtis, and I'm talking to you because the activity will help keep us warm. Me, for working my jaw, and you for working your brain. Let's go. I know I called you cold and insensitive, but this is ridiculous. But your heart is still warm, and you'll be fine as long as we keep it warm.
Undo. That's it. We can undo the hatch! How? It's sealed. We can undo the seal the same way we did.
When Jessie was a baby, she cried all the time. He has his moments. But... I think he likes you. Have you seen my cell phone anywhere? - I don't remember where I left it.
Not since 1992. Yes, everything is fine. Come in. I saw the East Africa report again last night. There's been a change since it was sent to you for your approval.
Don't tell. Wudang also owns an American subsidiary called KPT Building. Which is located in Arizona. Which is Stone's home state. The CIA has been all over this report since we started doing it.
See what you can find out. If you could also mention the uranium truck that was stolen on the outskirts of Tiraspol in Moldova last night. The CIA is aware of the theft. We're monitoring the whole situation, sir. Do we know who stole it, or God help us, what they intend to do with a truck full of uranium?
Come on, let's go upstairs. Let's go upstairs. You were a very sweet girl, Priscilla-Jean. - I know. - Fun, funny. Full of life. But your bad temper, even your mother couldn't stand it.
We watch. We wait. Now we are here. You are in possession of great power. We need to take it back.
- How about now? "Supergirl". What makes you so powerful? That symbol. I've seen it before.
Hello, is anyone there? - What are you doing? - What's with the money you've got? Don't tell me you stole it.
Yes. I... Hey... in light of recent events, I think it's important that we have each other's up-to-date information. I mean, I know I have your phone number because I just dialed it and I have your address because I lived there.
"David, we became friends when we were at rock bottom and that's when friendships grow stronger, like two candlesticks that have fallen into a volcano." "The candlesticks melt, but then they stay together and then, when they cool down, they stay embraced forever." "Nothing can separate this new double chandelier." "Unless it falls back into the volcano, or if it falls into a geyser." Or if you drop it from a great height, it breaks and then...
Really? Did you include the little megaphone that the letters form? Yes, I did. It's beautiful! I can't wait to read it once it's finished.
Can we stop here for a moment? Pumpkin. My little pumpkin, I like to think about other girls sometimes. But, the truth is... if you left me one day, I'd rip my heart out and never put it back in.
But I don't see that happening. You prepared the ground with wine, you shared a pizza, - you were face to face and you... - And you ruined the moment. If the moment was going to happen, an Indian guy in boxers wouldn't be able to spoil it.
He was there. I know he was. Hello? Let's make a deal. Kirsten told Naomi Burke about the encryption code and made a deal to hand it over.
We can show up and arrest her. Burke and the security guard have already killed a man. - Twice. - She won't hand over the money without proof that the code works. But we can't prove it without decoding it.
Now you have the chance to meet her. It's not perfect, but it's something. Cassie. We both know we're going to lose a lot before this is over. I'd rather have that moment and miss it than die without ever having had it.
You don't know about the bugging. Every time he's here, we hear scenes like this. We can't go on without Oliver Peters. The virus has been destroyed. Only he can replicate it.
The report mentions a place called Titan and a man called Witness. That's it. We go back to 1961, we find Kirschner before Mossad, we find Titan, we find the Witness, we cut off the snake's head. That won't stop the storms here. Save the world by killing the one who destroys it.
We have to find Titan first. He doesn't know. You're not getting in my way. I've seen the report, unredacted. It only mentions Titan because you mention him.
Stopping the paradox fixes time. It's more hope than certainty. Are you all right? It all comes down to this. If only the world had a better doctor to save you.
I want to tell you a story about how the world ends and the man who went back in time to stop it...
Where's your power ring? That green ring? The captain took it from me when he rescued me from the sea, as a reward for taking me into his crew. - It's locked in his trunk. - We have to get it back.
I'm ready to shrink it. We have a surprise for you. It's the reduction beam 2.0. You'll notice that it's superior to... My calculations indicate that I'll discover it's a trap designed to destroy me when I activate it.
Are you thirsty? - No, thank you. - What do you want? Okay, listen, I'll cut the crap right now. The night your boat sank, you told OSHA that everything was calm, that there was an explosion and a wave sank it.
He's no longer infected. Well, his fever's down, he's drinking water, but he'll need treatment for a while. I'll stay here until he's stronger. But you should stop using this place after that. Keep paying the rent so that no one else uses it.
"Painting." What? I don't know. Sam's little accent is amazing, isn't it? I wish he'd keep it, but he'll probably lose it as soon as he goes to school.
You keep asking me, why didn't Abby wake up or cry? Because I gave her allergy medicine and she was just sleeping. What did you give her? It was here. Did they take it with them?
There's no need for second-guessing now. But what if one of the agents lied? What if something else happened in that hotel room? What are you talking about? When I went to delete the data on Megan's phone, someone had already done it.
You like Governor Vargas' free education plan, don't you? That's right. And you want to see it implemented throughout the country? I really do. Then why did you slam it on national television?
I miss you, darling. Take care of my Leonard. Yes, ma'am. When we were kids, we had to memorize this sacred chant and understand its meaning. By the time this weekend is over, I hope you've all learned it too.
Can we assume that the explosive device wasn't yours? Of course it wasn't. Then we won't rest until we identify the culprit. I checked the security system. No one set it off.
This will probably go away. However, clearly, your ex-husband is not into that. I tried to tell you that. Listen, if this case survives tomorrow, and it shouldn't, but if it does, my marching orders are not to merely argue the case. They will be to destroy the man who brought it.
I think that if you examine this evidence, you can safely make a discovery. I close my case. This would be a good time for one of you to speak. First of all, none of this demonstrates why the boat exploded. None of this adds any new evidence of wrongdoing or confirms it.
And those who aren't, are in storage. But that's all right. They have a system. I know they do. I designed it.
It was all in vain. Blood tests revealed high levels of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine. Adderall? It's used recreationally by some. I don't think that's how Bailey used it.
I work in a veterinary practice. This dog was there two weeks ago. But the man who took him there picked him up before I'd finished. He was all sweaty, completely scared. He said he'd stolen the dog from a policeman who was mistreating it, and that the policeman was coming to pick it up.
Did you know that? There are actually five simple rules. When they ask you a question, if you don't understand it, all you have to do is ask them to repeat it. That's fine. Then the second, if they mention a document, you just have to ask for it.
There are actually five simple rules. When they ask you a question, if you don't understand it, all you have to do is ask them to repeat it. That's fine. Then the second, if they mention a document, you just have to ask for it. Tell them you want to see it.
I thought he was finally going to apologize for taking me out of OverGuard. But instead he accused me of selling our daemon. After everything he did to me, it's true, I was furious and we fought, but when I left he was alive. Why did he think you sold the daemon? He said he found it hidden in an app.
The point is, the ISI agents weren't the ones from Overson's boat last night. Maybe there were more than three. Maybe. Or maybe you threw Overson's laptop in the water at the marina and maybe the Coast Guard fished it out a few hours ago.
Women do things like this in a less obvious way. They told me I had a plan. The malware is mimicking a biological virus, so we're using the CDC protocol. We identify how it's transmitted, begin containment, and inform the public. My team is writing a code, an antidote, that will "cure" all infected phones and prevent new phones from catching it.
I said my senses were vibrating, but you didn't hear me. - What was that? - Do you see? Let's focus on the problem at hand. We know that the Book shows the events that have happened or are about to happen. Obviously we have so many events on the horizon that it has overloaded it.
Today, the sheer number of unpredictable players on the Internet has led to some of its greatest glories. Fundamental research into cancer, AIDS and other diseases has been hampered by a complex problem to do with the intricate structure of molecules. Scientists, using supercomputers, have been unable to solve it. Adrien Treuille was one of the creators of a video game appealing to a community of players from all over the world. Here, we see an RNA molecule curled up in its beautiful helical pattern, forming a helix. INFORMATION SCIENTIST, CARNEGIE MELLON And the amazing thing is that this pattern is formed from very simple rules that wind it up and create this shape.
"Okay, thank you very much." And she says: "Wait! I've got some great news for you." And I'm like, "What is it?" And she's like, "My security director gave me his personal username and password so I could connect to the proxy server to send you the file!" Motorola had tons of security, technical security, but all it took was 15 minutes with a lot of lip to get the crown jewels. So that's how it happened. - But he didn't sell it.
Every class that passed by had a unique baseball cap. So he put it in the window to look legitimate to the other officers and policemen. More statement-seeking behavior. I checked. The only year they used that symbol was 1988. So how did this guy get it?
If I do one credit a day next year, I'll graduate two months early. What about a credit a day starting next week? - Well, I'll try to do that. - No, not try. "Try" tells me you're not going to do it.
Because I'm not going to refer him for advice. Why... he won't. I know he won't. I haven't referred him either because he tells me he doesn't go, that he doesn't do it. I've mentioned it before and that's what happens.
Where's your coat? I didn't have one when I got off the bus. Yes, I did. There's a black coat somewhere. Have you put it in my office?
Did you say "all wet"? Do you want to push? I have a rather brilliant idea. What if I say this? They've lost my name on the lists. They can't find it. So I've been trying to sort it out.
I came across a very old artifact. It looks like some kind of cloth, with something written on it, but it's so faded that you can't make it out. I was hoping you could take a look. Where did you find it? Where did I find it?
I was hoping you could take a look. Where did you find it? Where did I find him? Uncle Felix? I didn't find him, they gave him to me in Leipzig.
I'll try, but you won't believe me. There can be no good without evil. But evil has to be confronted before it can be expelled. What I do is remove evil from those who come looking for salvation. Where do you take it?
- Something I picked up last night after our little chat. A record of her stay at the Lawford Center. Did you think you were the first drug addict in the family? She had a problem. And I didn't understand it.
To not give the defense this right to confront the opposing witness is prohibited by law, unfair and unduly prejudicial. You are therefore instructed to disregard all of Mr. Cooperman's testimony. It is not part of the trial record. It is not evidence. You are not to take it into account in any way.
Okay? The fuel is what caused all the damage. It can't be tested, because you're not supposed to have it... And if you're not supposed to have it... you can't get rid of it. Yes, this is... this is a serious problem with the phone, but I think I know someone who can fix it.
So whatever you want to call me, you can forget it. I bought those tanks from a guy at one of my parties, so if you have to do anything, it's investigate him. Yeah? Does that guy have a name? I assume so, but do I know it?
She didn't have anything valuable, you know, so why was she targeted? Guys. So, I was playing the video of the Cliffords' neighborhood up until the day of the robbery. Nothing suspicious... Nothing until I had a second incident to compare it to.
Get over here! Let's get the drone before they get it. We've lost the drone. We can't find what we can't see. It's too low for the radar to pick it up, but we're heading in the direction we saw it going.
Happy, get behind the wheel in case we have to run. They're unloading drugs from the first wave that came through. Yes, look over there. The drone that bypassed the device. We need to catch it to study it, find out how it got through.
There you go. Sounds absorbing. - Here. - Why are you giving me that? - To put on it. - It's your cactus, you put it on.
Under two minutes. - What's that? - A live number... No. Nobody said we were going to do a number. I didn't know anything about a live number, so I don't think we're going to do it.
Before I stabbed him. Ruiz is... dead? - Tommy, where's the body? - Where's the body? It's under the fucking LIE, where I left it.
Something's wrong. What are you saying? He's dying. I don't know what to do. The baby needs physical contact, but Finnerman won't allow it.
The sleeve goes up here. There's a sign on the right wrist. In the shape of Iceland. I'll ask you to look at the bikers we have in custody. Are you still analyzing the crime scene? I'd like to see it.
And who shot him twice in a building with 15 well-armed men? There would have been easier times and places to dispatch the man. - Did the carpet turn up? - No. The bikers swear they threw it away a week ago when Chainsaw, one of them, soiled it in the worst way.
Detective! Sit down. Detective Hagen, this is Detective Riba, your union representative. We know it was Lisa. I confess it took us a while to figure out how you and Dunning made that video. Then we realized it was a question of where they had filmed it.
- It doesn't exist, it never existed. - It's here. It's here and I know it. I feel it by instinct, just as I did when I heard that you murdered your wife. And I'm going to find that money, and when I do, I'm going to come down here and light up a big Cuban cigar and smoke it with a smile on my face, and then I'm going to Cook County Criminal Court,
Why didn't you report Bardot to internal affairs? I couldn't. Not after what he discovered. His computer. He found something when he hacked into it.
Follow them to the ambulance. Let's go. -Hold your legs. -All right, hold on. The belt is stuck, I'll have to cut it.
- Did you think about not watching? - No, I didn't. - I thought we'd order pizza. - You're kidding, Bones. You've never cared about field hockey, then all of a sudden this game comes along and you won't let it go.
These are fantasies. It's just a formality, Your Majesty, confirming your temporary tenure as Councillor of State while His Majesty is away. You're so kind to still look after me after you retire. What else is in the diary? I've studied it with Major Adeane and we've tried to get as much out of it as possible, but there will still be the usual Privy Council meetings, some investitures and military inspections.
You are the tip of the arrow. The work done in this room could stop the next attack. Or not. "Hello stranger" So you didn't lose your phone or let it die.
Did they ask you to do anything else on the truck? Was that the only service you did? The tires were muddy. They were covered in red clay. I had to take it off to get traction.
I'm Detective Lindsay. We're with intelligence. We have some questions about your badge. Yes. I reported that I lost it two weeks ago.
That's right. I reported that I lost him two weeks ago. It's embarrassing. I've already been suspended. How did you lose it?
See that marker? When I was looking for Deiser outside, the creatures didn't even come close. They don't like the markers. And the base is surrounded by them. If we get it, we can drive the creatures away and free the ship.
- I can't. - Why can't I? Because I'm no longer a Jedi. By choice, I left the Order. It's probably best if you two open it.
Previously on Madam Secretary: A truck full of uranium fuel rods was stolen by Moldovan criminals with no experience in handling the material would hardly consider it a priority situation. If the uranium comes with its own nuclear physicist to show them how to use it...
That's what I do. I can't believe we're losing the party over this. Fuck it. This hospital was originally built as a tuberculosis clinic, but the patients who came in got sicker and sicker until they realized it was because they built it on this rancid swamp. So they closed it for a decade until they reopened it, and today we're the fourth best hospital out of four in our area, which is good for us because it keeps expectations very low.
You said you went to Harvard? Well, I did. Harvard University. Well, my ring fell down the drain. I stuck my hand in there to retrieve it, not knowing that Matty had turned on the garbage disposal.
I received my mother and... I couldn't get a job. I was like "No Shoes" Joe Jackson, being banned from baseball in his prime."No Hand" Joe Jackson. For two years I suffered while watching inferior surgeons do my job. It broke my heart because I knew I could still do it.
Let's go in alphabetical order. I'll drive. - It's quartz. - Like the mineral? Yes, more or less the way to do it, but that's what it is. Quartz.
The truck doesn't have a radio. Well, the Renegade intervention team should take care of it. Yes, and maybe they'll take the truck back to Renegade. Right now, we need that fuel and ammunition more than they do. So I want you to go there, find the truck, help Tyler fix it and bring it back here.
Jake wants to get married at my parents' house on the Vineyard, even though it's a famous shipwreck site. She's incredibly superstitious. - See this crack in my screen? - Yes. It's like that because this klutz fell on me while I was standing in line at the Shake Shack. Jake wanted me to throw him, but this is why we met,
Sir, I know you two have a history, but we need him on our side. So we have to please him in the special interests? This is the time to bring Mellie to her knees. Her campaign finance picture is sad enough. She needs Hollis Doyle's money more than anyone, which is exactly why we need to prevent her from getting it.
Please don't tell the President. Everything we've been through. Don't give up on me. I'm begging you. This job means everything to me. I've already lost it once.
Suddenly, things don't look so good for the Alderson clan. You've ruined another vacation. All is not lost, guys. I've got a spare. I just have to get it out from under... the luggage.
Let's try again. You can't teach someone to hack in a day, okay? I don't know if we'll be ready tomorrow. - We need more time. - We don't have it.
Hello. Four million in the bloody horseshoe? Yes. Do you know where the money is? Yes. It's an Indian called Ed Moapa who has it.
She's very intelligent. Do you trust her? Yes. She thinks I could try the medically induced menopause. My cancer feeds on estrogen, so she thinks we can starve it.
Get lost. Or he'll kill you. Take care of yourself. You can keep the money. I don't want it anymore.
Elliot. Be careful. When I completed the migration, I also opened up the site to more than just TOR traffic. Stay here and don't move. I only had to index it for a few search engines. With the added touch of placing ads on top advertising sites, it's now accessible to any creep who googles "Thai girls for sale."
Do you want to shoot me? Be my guest. The appointment of a new CEO won't stop the Federal Government from taking over the factory. I flew for 13 hours and 35 minutes. If you have something to say, this is it. I needed the bailout money. And now I don't have it.
Hungry? Yes, this is Detective Richard Hannigan, NYPD, 11th Precinct, badge number 22350. I've just sent you a fax with a form about a potential suicide. Can you confirm that you received it?
I don't know why or what it contains. Bin-Khalid was planning an attack on American soil. Maybe that safe is part of it. It could be a weapon or information about a target. Whatever it is, Ben must have taken it.
- No one else has access to it? - No. We're a very small company. I have nothing to do with this. I barely know how to turn on a computer without breaking it.
Mark's hacker friend extracted information from the card we found in the old man's garden. - Is it from a Premier Lodge? - Yes. And it retains information until it's reprogrammed again. I have the name of the last person who used it.
Let's go. OK, Carla. Let's do it, kid. Everything's going to be fine. You don't have to make love to her. Get the calf out so we can raise it and kill it.
No. It was more like waste management. So Jordan calls you up, gives you 10,000 dollars to get rid of a corpse, and you do it? I need money. Did you recognize the body when you buried it?
Whatever he's doing with this radioactive material, he's doing it as Chernov. Right, but what I don't understand is if Chernov is about to make a lot of money transporting radioactive material, why does Jordan need to embody him? Wait until Chernov does the deal, go ahead, get him and the money. Unless Chernov wasn't doing the deal. Maybe he never had the radioactive material, maybe Jordan did and needed Chernov to change it.
They say it's going to take place in the city and that it's coming soon. Very soon. Oh boy. Okay, fine. If this Chernov from construction was The Broker, he's still the middleman, right? The deal isn't done until he passes the product on to the people who intend to use it.
I don't think I'd say no to either of them. All right, how do we kill him? By stabbing him in the heart. Well, given that it has a giant hole in its chest, does it even have a heart? Apparently not in it. The person who owns Qareen's heart is the one who commands him.
Mrs. Williams, the only way for you to know about this account is to have contacted your son. - That's not true. - So how do you explain this? Because two months after we lost Matty, the bank called and told me about this account. I don't know when he deposited the money or how he got it.
- That's not true. - So how do you explain this? Because two months after we lost Matty, the bank called and told me about this account. I don't know when he deposited the money or how he got it. I just used it to come and visit my son and grandchildren.
Right, once again, Mr. Fuller... Who were you laundering money for? While you were planning your little escape, our technicians investigated the bank's security system. And you know... they discovered that, apparently, you were telling the truth about the security video being erased. You just forgot to mention that it was you who deleted it.
He called it a trophy. He said it represented what you can get rid of if you meet the right people. Do you know where the necklace is? Um, um. Who has it?
Who killed my wife? Not until you let us go. Douglas! It's not a negotiation! Who's got it? !
You could say that. Where's the video? It's safe. Hmm. I want you to destroy it, Dwayne.
- Lou! - God damn it! Do me a favor. All of you! Avoid mentioning that name because the next piece of excrement who says it will get the Levi treatment.
It was impossible not to follow her. Every time she turned her head, she was on the cover of a magazine. And I read your book. What did you think of it? I thought that all the people who bought this book and actually read it would be out of work.
- Yes. Does it have anything to do with the case? - No. - Good. Then I don't need to read it. Then I don't need to read it.
Oh, my God. Is that Emma's blood? I'm afraid so. Do you recognize the symbol on the mirror? -I've never seen it.
We can't use this as proof. - If you're right, it won't be necessary. - Why is that? The theory of the crimes has always been wrong. We thought Derek O'Neal was killed to protect the building, and that Rosalyn Graham was killed to stop him.
It says that Patrick told the authorities that he survived the attack by focusing on the sand. The attacker forced him to look at an hourglass while he was abused. He said if he didn't cry until the sand ran out, he wouldn't be killed. So the trauma of the assault merged with the image of the hourglass. And he became obsessed with time, so much so that he started building devices that measure it with extraordinary mathematical precision.
The last time you were here, you hit on my husband. In my defense, I was so high on drugs and alcohol that I actually thought he was attractive. I wish we'd celebrated together. All right, I'll just take all the alcohol out of the minibar. - Thank you very much. I just don't trust myself not to take it out.
Kirsten! How long can she stay in there without coming out? I don't know, it's not a Stitch, so there's no time limit. Linus, can you isolate the signal that's controlling the avatar? - Yes! Do you want me to turn it off?
Well, you learn exactly what an edge can take before it cuts you. I don't mean to hurt myself. Well, if you don't mind me asking, what happened to you? No, I don't mind. There was a dog in the road, and I pulled off the road so as not to kill it.
I knew about the email. That email would have destroyed your case, - ruined your career. - If it had been sent. But it wasn't. She swore she hadn't written it. She thought someone was trying to sabotage her.
-holding up the pole. -You got it. -Torres. Get an IV. We need to keep the pole cold while we cut it.
What the hell is going on here? The Squad using our truck? Otis said it was fine. Okay, good. Make sure they deliver it by midnight.
Of course, you don't mind if he goes off. What do you care? He's getting closer and... If I were a child, I'd be dead now. I don't leave him when there are patients on the stretcher.
They did an angioplasty and everything seems to have gone well. -He came out of surgery at 1 o'clock. -All right, great news. Kelly... They call this blockage the "widow maker". If they hadn't found it, Eddie could have died within a week.
Drive. And just so you know, the reason I want to become a cop is to get rid of the bad guys, and make the world a better place. We're trying to get to him. We don't know how this happened. I mean, there was obviously some kind of mistake. Ma'am, if there was a mistake, it looks like your husband made it.
Is everything all right? - No, it's not. - What's wrong? - I want my necklace. Mom said I could have it back.
Where the fuck are you? Do you want to call me and tell me what's going on? All right, bye. Goodbye. The shower has been leaking for a year and no one seems to be able to fix it.
Isabel, do you love him? -Yes. -Are you sure? Love is a risk for anyone. But for you, knowing what love did to your mother, how can you not fear it?
No. What will destroy you is if you get this job and you don't deserve it. I didn't earn this position. I wasn't fairly elected to this position. I didn't deserve it.
What's going on here? Just another day in paradise. What's wrong? It's not here. The new prototype. I thought you'd brought it.
It's not here. The new prototype. I thought you brought it. We did, but it's not here. What the hell does that mean? I think your son borrowed it.
I don't want to point the finger at anyone, but... How did this happen? Like I said... I don't know. Right, but how come our only prototype wasn't tested? Why would we take it to the race if it wasn't ready?
Big, huge, he really was a guy. Okay, what color hair, what color eyes? I told you the lights were off. Okay, just show me the profile. She... She's already turned it off.
I'm after that crown. Help me get it, and I'll help you get Tek's hammer. The only weapon that can destroy the Darkspore once and for all. Tek's hammer is gone and no one knows where. And no mortal can use it.
Nonsense, you were brilliant darling, we've got it. It's not over yet. Your necromantic touch woke up the last bit. I have you to thank. Without your help I might never have found it.
Wear rodent armor! I am Groot! Give it back! I've always wanted to get my hands on this artifact. Although I didn't expect to find it in your possession.
Hi. Someone put a GPS transmitter on the watch battery. -Do you think it's a CIA thing from my mission in Thailand? It's possible. I doubt we can be sure. Can we find out who bought it? No.
So what? They don't want recognition before they've finished, right? What if they're just starting out? I don't remember this suit. I had to borrow it.
It was Bob Paris' escape money. No, I can't do that. Then help me because I don't know what to do with it. Look, that money doesn't belong to anyone, and who knows how he got it? Honestly, I can't think of anything better than putting it into the world through your hands.
I hope you'll be able to change your ways. Otherwise, this agreement won't last long. This isn't a postponement. Libby forgot her coat. I'll make sure she gets it.
This is Earp land. - Our land. - We can't get them away from here. - Not until we find the talisman. - I know, I buried it myself.
Okay. I owe you an apology. I owe you an apology. I know that the exercises you did with your husband... the exercises I encouraged you to do... are the reason we're here. It was my mistake to come to you, to think that my marriage could change, that things could be different. I know what my marriage is, because I made it that way.
I remember you telling me that Art was eager to start a family right after they got married. What happened? Nothing happened. Art is as eager as ever. So why don't you have him?
Again. You know, your life could be much better than you think. Why don't you hammer the nail in? Because we're used to it. We just ignore it, like the rain in my room.
Let me tell you a bit about fire. This is how we learned. Burn the land to create a burned area and hunt there after the fire. We hunt the animals of the land. These stories told around the campfire are very important because they remind us that many of the stories about fire and how our ancestors used it and stole it have made the land and the people better.
Tell the baker to put the bread in the oven as soon as you get there. - Right away? Take your time. Just be careful. Of the four elements, air is the most intangible, because we can't see it.
- Now? Take your time. Just be careful. Of the four elements, air is the most intangible, because we can't see it. I think that's what makes it special.
Today, wheat cultivation is more widespread than any other, covering more than 225 million hectares worldwide. And it all started in the Middle East and North Africa region, formerly known as the Fertile Crescent. Although this is where wheat originated and bread remains a staple food in these countries, the Fertile Crescent is no longer the bread basket it once was. The countries that make up this region today, from Egypt to Iraq, can no longer grow enough wheat to feed their growing population. So they have to import it from places that have surpluses, such as Russia, Ukraine, Australia and the European Union.
And if there's one group that will forgive you for everything that's happened to you in the past, trust me, it's this one. So are you coming or not? Let's go! First I want to put on the sunscreen. Huh, I could have sworn I'd brought it.
What are you watching? Is it The Amazing Race? The indigenous people's minister confirmed that the Chilean government actually violated the agreement with the Inhawoji people when it sold the mineral rights to their land without their consent. And no one ever thought to mention this? The Department of Commerce has admitted that it has a report on the violation of the agreement and that it never passed it on.
Good, okay. Come on, guys, delete the photos. Or what? Your mom and her fascist goons come after me? Fascism is the direct opposite of a representative democracy, and if you're lucky enough to live in one, it's thanks to people like my mother who defend it every day.
Are we talking about a year? Five years? The wine we're drinking, Nerello, is from Mount Etna. It's my favorite wine, made on the slopes of a volcano. But what is it about this wine that makes it so special?
Talk to me! The past. We take it with us wherever we go. Whatever we do, we can't escape it. We can't control it.
Less maternity. Are Mr. Welch's sutures holding? They should hold. I just wanted to say, what you did with Jason, the pericardial tamponade. You didn't drain it first.
Are Mr. Welch's sutures holding? They should hold. I just wanted to say, what you did with Jason, the pericardial tamponade. You didn't drain it first. You didn't drain it.
See you in the mountains. I noticed something interesting while I was doing the paperwork. Jason's blood type is AB negative. It's rare, less than one percent of the population. There are only four people awake in Wayward Pines who have it.
The killer rigged the bike so that the victim fell off before running him over with the tank. Tanks are heavy and slow vehicles. The ideal is to have a target that you can't dodge. Why did you move the tank? We had to push it to retrieve the body. Don't worry about it.
É. I was there. Corina asked me to find her father's dog. In the office? Don't believe everything Sylvia Lennard says. She knew very well why I was there. But I didn't want you to know that my family still owns the bar in Little Auburn. It was my grandfather who won it during a poker game. And the deed has disappeared, very conveniently, since they took over the village.
I've got a little treat for you... My badge? Where's my badge? Have you lost it? Maybe he's lost it...
Turn Boyko. They're both Ukrainian. Maybe they remind me of my grandmother. She wants the accident report on him so she can fill out the annual California life insurance policy. Only I don't have it, because I have to find out why the coroner didn't sign it, because I have nothing else to do today.
Maybe she left him. So maybe... the real thing isn't looking for you. There's a whole world out there that's real. A whole world that begins where this one ends. Maybe our love has been so damaged that both you and I can't see it anymore.
I'm addicted to my job. No. Not to being a policeman. To solving a mystery. As soon as you have a case, you get all excited, and it's all you can think about, and you get away from everyone you love to solve it.
I'm sorry. It's just that I told him I already had it. And then he collected all the bones, but I lost the Clue. Constance, watch your tears. This mascara isn't waterproof and you can't touch it up.
What are you going to do with it? What do you mean? It's in my drawer. - Are you giving it back? - Do you want it back?
This is about salvation. Salvation? What salvation? This test makes no sense. Nobody will see it.
And the missing watchman? Ian Walker. Lin hasn't been able to reach him yet. Jimmer Hobberkin's detective used an app and found Ian Walker's cell phone at a construction site in Flatbush. He thinks he threw it into a cement mixer. But he was wrong. We can take Ian Walker off the suspect list.
Do business with the Lake Walkers. - Machk won't... - Machk will listen to you. He has to, otherwise his people won't survive the winter. When I kill Benton, swear to me that you'll burn his empire to the ground. Swear to me that you'll use him.
It was fair. You're becoming a stronger ruler. That's what Scotland needs. That's what Elizabeth needs to realize she has to back down. Do you think she will? She saw a power vacuum and stepped forward to fill it.
Thank you. You're asymptomatic, right? Hello to you too. Yes, as of twenty minutes ago, I'm fine. So, even if you had the Marburg virus, the only way I could catch it is by exchanging bodily fluids, right?
- I'm sorry. I swear I'm on my way. - How much further is it? - Quite a bit. I missed my flight. - Missed what? I didn't miss it, but...
I've put everything I have into keeping this firm afloat for as long as I can remember. Now look around you. The ship isn't sinking. It's already sunk. And I don't know if I have the strength to pull it back up from the bottom of the ocean.
- According to Benjamin, the partners haven't just left, they're going after all our customers. All right, give me an update and do it in plain English. I blocked whoever was on the computer, but they got three client files. They're trying to bury us tonight. So we have to stop it before it starts.
Yes. Are you? Spencer's tooth came out... One of them. He wants you to see it. Did he pull it out, or did you?
- So? - I'll prove it. When the judge sees it, he'll throw you in jail. Is that so? I think the judge is going to certify that my client is part of this class, because they are, whether Jack told me or not. When that happens, I'll end the deal and your money will go back to the partners you stole it from.
There's a book I want. We just found out where it was. In the hands of another Grimm, a Mr. Josef Neboja in Prague. We tracked it down at a bookstore in Leipzig and then here in Portland. It seems that the person who bought it is a relative of a friend of yours.
Have we hidden the trunk? Why would we hide the trunk? There's nothing in it. Yes, I know. What if they knew my uncle Felix had it?
Why would we hide the trunk? There's nothing in it. Yes, I know. What if they knew my uncle Felix had it? If they knew he had it, they'd know he'd given it to me.
With Peña inside. You're a bit big to scratch other people's cars. Grow up. What happened when you finished scratching the car? I didn't finish scratching it.
None of the witnesses... Saw the first punch. Need a little help? Satoshi, I'm Detective Lyons. This is Detective Hodiak. If the tea's bad, he made it.
They're going to bring me down anyway, so we have to take advantage. Thank you for your permission. But I don't need it. You don't need it. You're sloppy and vindictive and self-destructive, and all this time, you thought that maybe if I behaved myself, you'd give me your place as a gift when I left you.
And at graduation, they get a necklace called a "pig's tooth". And the idea is that there's a bullet out there that's for you, but if you have the necklace around your neck, then you'll be safe. The last time I saw my father, he gave me this. I didn't want to keep it, but he told me he didn't need it anymore. He was going to throw it away.
Napkin. I almost stopped drinking. Almost. - I don't want to see my liver. - I don't want to see it either.
Yes. ...it's an aberration. Officially. Well, I'll be thrilled if there's a Cheesecake Factory gift card in there. I think there is, but I've already used it. What's this?
You have to bring him here! Are you sure you're standing on a pressure plate? See how the inside of the ridge is above the frame? It happens because the springs are restrained by the weight of the scepter. If you lift it, bad things happen.
If we run into the forest and get caught, it's over. It's worth waiting. Shut up, they're here. - It's on. - Maybe it's the getaway car, but they couldn't find it in the woods.
So... you're carrying money around? Yes, it's my savings. Every last penny. Kelly, my girlfriend, she didn't... trust banks before, let alone during the animal apocalypse. Why are you walking him around instead of leaving him at home?
Please, it's freezing here. If you were a pilot, where's the plane? It's in pieces. It was a seaplane. When I got back to where we anchored it, the animals had destroyed it.
I designed my facial reconstruction on the basis of the disappeared and I had a result. Melissa Goodman. I see. Her hair was noticeably longer before she was kidnapped. Yes. And look how the killer cut it.
Oh my God. That's it. Think of the brain as a sponge. As the brain fissures dried out, Charles' brain condensed into a tighter shape hiding residual evidence in it. But when he hydrated it, the tissue expanded.
They also help to monitor diamonds, don't they? Yes, we are able to engrave microscopic marks that provide the security our customers demand. And the diamond we found? Who does it belong to? I remember that diamond well, I marked it myself.
They're scanning the body now, so... any more big tremors? No, but there are no ghosts either. I don't think we'll ever know. You know, I didn't believe it either and after Lance died, I saw him and he told me to move on. And it helped me a lot, so I didn't want to be funny or flippant, just... if they want to send you a warning, I don't want you to miss it.
I wanted to honor Mike. I wanted to show the killer that the Midnight Ranger will never die. Neither he nor the values he defends. It's curious that he already had his Midnight Ranger costume ready. I didn't have it ready.
I suspect she has leukemia. She came here four months ago with joint pain and exhaustion. Have you considered sending her somewhere with more resources, perhaps radio treatment? No, I haven't. She can't afford it, and if she could, she'd risk dying far from home.
Are you really going to bother me with this? I have to have the inventory ready by the end of the shift, then. Well, I've got a case to work on, then. Are you asking about the laptop? Look, I'm not saying he stole it, but...
So this is Jennings' office. Yes. He was supposed to publish an article about a new nursery he opened on the base. He started it at home, but he was only halfway through, so... I have to finish it.
Yes. He was supposed to publish an article about a new nursery school he opened on the base. He started it at home, but he was only halfway through, so... I have to finish it. I'm glad he stored it in the cloud.
All right, you've got to go, Dan. Thanks for the tickle. Have you... have you sorted out... the subway card situation? Yes, I got it.
I made a joke. You cut the car in half. No, the firemen did. They were already cutting to try and free Tony Plagiarism, so I asked them to cut it in half.
Sorry, no can do. No, no. She calls us. She tells us when and where to get the money. Where did you leave it?
Well, not what you're doing to that girl. - You've gone too far. - You got what you wanted. - The money is yours. - Not yet, it isn't.
Because he had blue contact lenses in the chest. In... when Alison voluntarily checked herself into Welby, she didn't think she'd only seen her mother. She thought she'd seen Wilden too. I don't think he used the latex just to make a Hanna mask. I think she also used it to make one of Wilden.
- Kara, this is crazy. Why don't you tell me what's going on? - Where's the diaper bag? - I don't know. I thought you had it.
Thank you, sir. Are you saying that he broke in and took the cell phone? Yes. He went to Grace's house, came back, expecting the bar to be open as usual until 1am, but it had closed at 11pm. Laura, he left his cell phone in the bar so he'd have an alibi if we traced it.
A strange group. Scientists, behaviorists, engineers. What the hell was the wall doing? Nobody knew. The technology came from elsewhere and all we had to do was build it.
Now pretend you're not talking to Johnny. It kills fear and creates euphoria. The wall is a giant peacemaker. There's no fighting, no running away, total passivity. When you activate it, everyone in the Old City becomes a kind of happy, helpless drone.
You have 30 seconds to explain why you came after my daughters. And another 30 to answer some questions about that stupid safe. Start. You let them open the safe. - I told you not to open it!
Her first word. And the last... We have to get her body back. I have to see her. Molly, I want her body too, but they won't give it to me.
The night before, they met at a club to pick up the program. When Marcus returned, he and the laptop reeked of cigars - that's all I know. -Where's the laptop now? If you still have a copy of the program here, maybe you can find out who created it.
I don't have much time. And I need answers. Your sister Alex is insisting that I open the safe. I need to know what's in it. That's the question everyone's been asking since 1882... when my great-grandfather opened it for the first time.
Do you really think I did the right thing by taking Caroline against her will? One hundred percent. You said that's how you know you love someone. And, for a second, I really, really believed you. I thought my love for Caroline was so strong that I would do anything to protect it.
Anyone who has a transfusion could be infected. What if we test all the blood for Nibori and see which is safe to use? These tests take 12 hours. A rapid test can only be done on someone who is infected because the viral load is higher when it's already incubated. It's up to Homeland Security to seal off LA's blood supply until we test it.
I found a trace. A defect was inserted into the labeling program to scramble the codes and mix up the blood. Is that how the blood contaminated for research got to the hospitals? A bug? Yes. If we find it, we can unscramble the codes.
I find her boring too. There's a book I want. We found out where it was... In the hands of another Grimm. A Mr. Josef Nebojsa, in Prague. We managed to trace it to a bookseller in Leipzig... and from there to here in Portland. It turned out that the bookseller who bought it... was related to a friend of yours.
Yes, dirty pool. Let's get through this, shall we? So where are you in all this? I was black before I put this badge on. I'll be black after I take it off.
I'm trying. I'm trying. Thank you. Your robe is inside out. Yes, well... I thought fewer people wore it like that.
I've changed my mind. You haven't changed your mind. You don't change your mind. You still think that left-handed people just haven't learned to use their right hand yet. That calf will be worth 1200 dollars if we can sell it.
Now. All of you. What do you think you're doing? This is my business. I built it.
Hello, you wrinkly old man. Okay, now I'm feeling a bit of tension. You two, don't start.... Penny and I are doing the second wedding for you. - Please don't ruin it.
It's not a warning that you should go to the dentist. We have to go to dinner with the guys. One second. I'm just afraid I'll reply and they'll know I got it. Dude, since you opened the email, they know you got it.
This man by the edge is not in the gallery portrait. In addition, this canvas has oblique folds in the corners. In this version, they are parallel. The gallery portrait is not the same as the one that was there two weeks ago. I think someone has replaced it with a fake.
The kids are at school. I don't understand. Marissa's murder was solved years ago. It was that stalker, the boy who hung out with her at school. We believe Louis Bowman was framed and the person who did it also recently killed a young woman in the Bronx.
The policeman takes photos of the woman who looks dead and shows them to her husband, who pays him. The policeman arrests him. Okay, in that scenario Butch Callahan is the cop, right? Someone hired him to kill Jared Talt. Only instead of doing it, he told Talt everything.
What's that? Broken car windows. I don't understand. You lied when you said you sold your engagement ring because you had no money. You only ruined it when you got into your husband's car to shoot his gun.
I know, but I think there's another reason. You have a slight prognathism, a protrusion of the jaw. Some call it a "square jaw". Your father had it too. I wasn't going to mention it, because this is much bigger than just me.
It's mass murder, and you know it. The problem with the war on terror is that it's not terrible enough. ISIS doesn't deny its attacks. They film them, they publish them, they brag about them. If I carried out the plan in the diary, I won't deny it.
I know you're just saying it, but it's true. And if it gets unbearable, here's a good way to deal with the anger. What's wrong with that guy? It's just a hat. If you cared so much about him, why did you leave him on the general rack?
Says Eric? - The traffic camera caught the truck in a nature reserve in Santa Clarita an hour ago. - Where is it now? - I don't know. There are no cameras in the reserve, but we didn't see it leave.
We're running out of time. The explosives could disappear at any time. She has a signal jammer on her wrist. I showed it to Nate before giving him the tracker. I hope he uses it to help and not for something else.
Julius Burton is officially giving his full financial backing to Sam Evans. I'm tired of worrying about what men like Burton do with their money. I'm not going to renew the cooperative defense agreement with Bahrain. Instead, we're going ahead with building a new base in Tunisia. We're going to take our military and economic support to a country that has earned it.
Bring him in calmly and firmly. How about extremely fast and out of control? Sorry, I'm a bit pale - with this plan. - Pensive: sweaty, terrified. I know the pilots' terms. Lieutenant, the fancy plane you're flying, the minds that designed it, compared to us, are dumb, so you don't need to sweat.
- I brought a cell phone. - Is it stolen? You didn't tell me not to bring a stolen one. - To a police station? - Actually, I just stole it.
We told Mick that we were going to save him. And I still have the vaccine. We just have to figure out how to make it work. The vaccine wasn't effective when we injected it into Mick. But if we can turn the serum into an aerosol, to launch it, using something like a fire extinguisher, we could deliver the cure as a spray.
I was collecting a reward for a bell pepper named Quentin Turnbull. - As in "Turnbull Country"? - I've never heard of it. That's because it's not supposed to exist. This book has changed since I last saw it.
And besides, the guy who tortured your ugly ass in 1951 was human. But what happens when a man like him acquires abilities like yours? We've seen it happen on countless other worlds, which is why we have to exterminate your kind before the scourge of your planet becomes the scourge of ours. Well, he's out of his giant mind. What if he's right? What if, by using our powers to make the world better, we end up destroying it?
We've got a bigger fish to fry, darling. Rex's killer? He's walking around the ship. He's looking for the amulet. It'll only be a matter of time before he finds it.
- There's the good cop, the bad cop and the dad cop. Firm, but reassuring. Get to the point. - I don't think I know that guy. - I didn't use it on you.
If more show up, we'll catch them. But Alchemy can't catch Wally inside the cell. We can't leave Wally to suffer. Besides, hiding won't make Alchemy go away. Ignoring the problem won't solve it.
How many arrows do you have left? I probably don't have enough. This corridor leads to an underground shelter. - Delay them as long as you can. - Where are you going? If they can't turn it off, maybe she can.
Don't worry, he can do it. You have a lot of faith. - Green Arrow... - Shut up! You don't do your job properly because you don't take it seriously. Maybe because you've never lost anyone, you don't fully understand what's out there.
I don't have to pretend. I need to stay in shape to finish off all the ETs. You have a better chance against the bars. I always wanted a sign of intelligent life. Now that I've got it, they're not intelligent at all. They're just mean.
I just find it a bit hard to believe that there's a divine plan for the universe that also includes space monsters. - I like to call it my 3PO processor. I'm fluent in 6 million forms of communication. - Do you speak Dominator? - I didn't program it for that, but in my defense, I didn't even know Dominators existed.
We tried to connect human technology to anything from the Dominators. - Of course it overloaded. - We need a regulator. Something that can handle the Dominators' energy. Van Horn made a prototype for NASA a year ago. Maybe they've perfected it.
- Of course it's overloaded. - We need a regulator. Something that can handle the Dominators' energy. Van Horn made a prototype for NASA a year ago. Maybe they've perfected it. Yes, they've perfected it, so much so that someone has already stolen it.
All right, just obey. Sit down. Everything will be fine. - We've lost the WiFi signal. - Maybe they turned it off.
Call him now or I'll send you back to him in pieces. My father isn't afraid of you and neither am I. Then you're both fools. Guys, we have a blood trail. If we follow it, we should find them.
That's the best way to get justice for Rebecca. I spoke to Rebecca's commanding officer. She reported for duty yesterday at 6:46 a.m. and didn't leave until noon, which means the arsenic was ingested there. Go to her office and find the poison. Once we've linked it to whoever the suspect is, we'll arrest him.
They'll give us a file. As for the APD, Danielle didn't make an appointment with the counselor. She was making phone calls on the ground, she sounded worried and no one knows why? It all comes down to who had access to the torch. If they didn't sabotage it on board the ship, they did it on land.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking, a kind of telepathy? It's not telepathy, Sebastian, Loretta called me. That would have been my second hypothesis. But I've been analyzing the seal on the torch. A knife was used to open it.
I was able to confirm that today's bomb was detonated by a cell phone. I even traced the signal, but I couldn't get any data. The cell phone is encrypted. Is it Russo's second cell phone? - I won't know until I examine it.
You have to stop the boat now. No. - I can't. - Pride, we've apprehended the fourth hijacker. I found the explosives, but not the detonator. I think we've just found it.
- Thanks, but I already have plans. - Right. Two weeks to work in the bar. No. The bar is very much in Buckley's hands. - I promise I won't burn it down.
We don't know who is behind this, but we think they might be planning an attack. We had no evidence to confirm that until now. - Is this the submarine? - Yes, it seems to be. The technicians were doing a check when they spotted it.
Between investors, developers and technicians, maybe 20 people. We'll need a list of those names. Anything I can do to help. The suit is worth 80 million dollars. Whoever stole it is looking to get paid.
"Killing to protect a loved one is understandable, even if it was premeditated." "Taking pleasure in torture is worse than murder." I think taking this test would be torture. It's a bit macabre. Do some people do it voluntarily?
More than that. It arrived just a few hours before he died. Read the coded version and you'll see. Emil was ordered to that café yesterday. We'll have to authenticate it.
I was looking for something I'd lost. A few years ago, I brought an antique ring back from London. It was supposed to be a present for the Countess of Morcar. I'm due to visit the Countess, so I remembered the ring. You haven't seen it, have you?
I was just finishing the last questions. You can review the answers to see if you agree with the new theory. Are you taking Dr. Naylor's quiz? Why would you do that? And why are you listening to disco music? I'm doing the quiz because you said Artur Tetch did it.
Selling high, I understand. What does that have to do with disco music and the DANTE quiz? If you let me finish... If you're right, whoever controlled Emil Kurtz and the assassin also controlled the Geneva bomber. I contacted a friend at Interpol and did what our technicians did with Arthur Tetch. I asked for the bomber's Internet history in the hope that it would lead to whoever hired him.
I don't understand. This is the DANTE questionnaire. Yes, we wanted to know if you'd done the test too. Dr. Naylor never allowed it. She didn't think anyone on the team should do it.
Power suits you, Seyah. They want to know what the wall is for? Show them. The wall is a giant peacemaker. When you activate it, everyone in the Old City becomes a kind of happy, helpless drone.
I'm doing everything I can to be inside again, to believe again that what we're doing is right, but... I don't know, since Peru, since the medicine, since I met you, I've been a mess. When you see the first flaw, you realize that there are flaws everywhere. It's like my grandfather used to say: "You can't forget the horror once you've seen it for the first time."
Your husband left a diary. - His what? - There was a diary in his file. Where is it? We found it in the room where he was in Peru. Why didn't the police have it?
Request permission to withdraw. Granted. Come to... The crystal won't serve you. Or you once I get it out of this damned city.
I couldn't save her. I was as powerless then as I am now. I couldn't show her the future she wanted. True power is not something that is found by those who seek it. It is something that is given to those who deserve it.
We can't go back. Situation report. Ulric killed some good men. - What about the ring? - We don't have it yet.
I've come to tell you that you're not kings. Their value has been considered and leaves something to be desired. Now it burns. You will lose your precious ring. But it's not too late to save it.
But it's not too late to save him. You want to negotiate your life. No, no. My life is nothing. Giving a future to those who want to see it is everything.
I was thinking about it. They could put it on a satellite or a rocket, - and it would work forever. - Cool. Could it be used for missiles and war materials? Yes, but we didn't create it for weapons.
Good evening. Any news about María's death? No, I'm calling about something else, something I forgot to tell you this morning. When I arrived at the school, I saw a woman arguing with others, she seemed very agitated, so I approached her and introduced myself. I asked her if there was a problem, but the woman tried to downplay it and told me it was nothing.
I had it in the cupboard and it disappeared a month ago. Yes? Why hadn't he told us? How could I have thought it was just that? I thought I'd lost it at home and that it was in a drawer.
Keep going. A week later, I went back to work and the same thing happened. You asked me if I could come to your house after work. And at Inge's, were you able to see your uncle? No... yes, but I had my cell phone with me, so I didn't see him.
Maybe he was scared. It's possible. Go on. I took the opportunity to get on my bike and leave quickly. Following the same route as Nicotra, but I never caught up with him.
It's possible. Keep going. I took the opportunity to get on my bike and leave quickly. Following the same route as Nicotra, but I never caught up with him. No, I never even saw him.
Carol cared about Bertram. Look at this. Digitals. Financial records. Someone tampered with the file before we received it.
Have you known him long? He's a crook with a tie. He's like me, except I don't wear a tie. - What's with the watch? - I bought it myself, why?
Take care of it! Call in reinforcements if necessary. Sir, the engines are overheating. We have to shut them down. Chief, when we spot an enemy on radar, you only have five minutes to shoot him down.
You're just as human as the rest of us. I need to hold myself to a higher standard. Shaw was right about one thing. This country has lost... its moral compass. It needs someone to guide it.
He always takes things too far. When we were kids, he took the neighbor's dog. - Taking, like stealing? - Everyone was looking for the dog. They couldn't find it.
- Why such a rush? - Why wait? Kyle has three more concerts on his tour. He doesn't want to miss them because of the surgery. Kyle, the tremor will only get worse if we don't treat it soon.
- So. - I think Grandma over there has just arranged my marriage to her daughter. There must be something in the air, because Amelia and Owen are also talking about getting married. Maybe they should have a double wedding. That way, I'd only have to endure it once.
- I don't know. His mother would kill me if I let anything happen to her. Please don't talk about her. It looks like Rhys has a perintonsillar abscess. I'm going to have to drain it.
I don't know, but they left here as if she were a criminal. I'm beginning to think that the person they were supposed to interrogate is sitting right here. Who are you talking about? You have no idea how that cell phone got into your backpack? No, but whoever put it there is probably the same person who attacked me last night and probably the same person who killed Jake.
Did you follow the lead on Seth Branson? Yes. I appreciate the lead, but it looks like he's clean. What about Jake's cell phone? - I couldn't open it.
Yes, if it means that he had a bomb attached. Krasnov wouldn't risk mounting an explosive on a water truck. He should have prepared it and attached it to the cart beforehand. Yes, it looks new. If you bought it in the last few days, that's a clue, but there must be hundreds of places that sell them.
The report we read didn't mention propellants. Probably because it burned up in the explosion, like most. But now I believe it was a chemical used in pesticides called nitroguanidine. One of the characteristics of nitroguanidine is its tendency to corrode metal, as well as a distinctive latex paint-like smell. The condition of the belt buckle suggests that Krasnov was responsible not only for planting the explosive, but also for assembling it.
Your father was heavily involved in this. Maybe he knew... maybe he showed you. But when we talked before, about the gene, it triggered something, some kind of memory. Whatever it triggered is gone now. If animals have the "ghost gene" and so do I, why don't you remove it from our DNA?
I'm sorry about that. Don't be. You've had a preview of the most epic cock in the world. It's perfect, isn't it? I didn't even notice. It was carved by the gods. Have you seen it?
Let's see how far we get before the girls come back. All we have to do is escape the water world. I hate this level. "Your princess is in another castle." If we don't beat it now, I'll call it a day.
The division is just beginning and my boys are kicking ass. They're killing it. Ndamukong Suh is still one of the highest paid players in the league. He's a superstar, a real beast, but you don't build a company on the basis of a single client. True, but Joe and Spencer are already building the company without the benefit of the NFLPA's stamp of approval, imagine what they'll achieve once they have it.
Yes. - Thank you. - Yes, sir. The team would like you to consider restructuring. Get rid, Charles! I haven't even received the money yet and they're already asking for it back.
Okay. Is there more? Wow! I can't wait to hear this. You're a human trafficker. No, no! You're a murderer! I lost a lot of money in a very bad business when Andre was running it.
Damn it, Mo. Look at that. Look at that shit. It's all right, it's all right. Shit happens sometimes, all right. The nigga's got a secret and he knows what a G-co like me is willing to do to find it out.
The temptation of power, forbidden knowledge, even the desire to do good... can lead some down this path. But only you can transform yourself. Not always. Your conflict becomes clear. The device on the floor, why do you have it?
How did you find it? "The Girl with the Genie Tattoo", remember? That was before I knew the damage they were going to cause. I made a mistake. I've done much more than correct it.
We weren't able to catch Jackson. - So... we have a problem. - No, you're the one with a problem. I've waited long enough. The "TX-14" gas was working perfectly, until you sabotaged it.
They beat me for three days. They didn't give me any food or water. I was so thirsty. I have a cigarette. But I don't have any matches to light it.
And they beat me up. They beat me up a lot. I haven't eaten or drunk water for three days. I'm so thirsty! I have a cigarette. But I don't have any matches to light it.
Ankita, open the door. Open the door. Open the door. Open the door. Ankita. I can do whatever I want to you, and nothing will happen to me. Slide your cell phone under the door without turning it off.
Bad news. I dropped mine in the toilet once... It was a bitch. - Damn. There goes that track. - I had to take it off without my gloves. No. No, because I got a serial number off it, so at least I know who bought it.
As you'll see. My balls! Get them off me! Come on, that's fun. Nick posted a video right after the retreat, and although they took it down quickly, everyone saw it.
Nick made it his personal mission to make my life a living hell. Sabotaging my work, terrorizing me, making me the butt of all his jokes. Or balls, in this case? That stupid video was my breaking point. Everyone saw it.
I'm talking about how Wesley realized his action figures were selling very well, did some research and realized he was being ripped off. - I think he should leave. - Unfortunately for Wesley, he shared his concerns about his manager with his ex-wife, who happened to be sleeping with him. And that voice mail he put through to us is what started this and what got him killed. He did it!
I never wanted to believe that my father would kill a policeman. - And today, when I received the video... - What video? His lawyers sent it to me. They said I was to receive it after his death.
A paternity test? What? Do I look like someone who would be so irresponsible? But if you do me this favor, then I'll do you a favor in return. Lucifer... The whole point of doing a favor is to do it for free, right?
You're fighting the blade, which indicates a strength I didn't think you had. Look into my eyes. Look at me. Your marriage. Did I ruin it?
The demon is talking, but it doesn't make any sense. Typical, I suppose. She thinks you killed the man who owns Lux to get Lucifer evicted. Mazikeen. If I made such a plan, do you think you'd be the one to discover it?
I think he did it. Do you two know that if you confess to this crime, there's a good chance you'll both go to prison? Whatever we face... Let's face it together. I don't understand. The one of you who didn't do it, he'll lose everything.
Just five minutes, please. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I've been thinking about our son's little problem and I thought that with a new topic... Sometimes a new topic changes your point of view, but I know he'd refuse it if it came from me.
Are you all right? Do you need a doctor? I looked everywhere and I couldn't find my earring under here. Oh dear! Maybe you can look for it later.
Tiana is already writing a response song. - If I can get her to sing. - If? After the mess you've made of her voice on Hakeem's song, you've got to stop meddling in my area. Secure that song so I can promote it in my area or your game will be over.
Find it. This parade is going to be fabulous! It's going to have a good sound and the charm of a black girl. I've seen Tiana with her hair up. I wish she'd wear it like that in the show.
Maybe, maybe not... But I'll find out. Look, you didn't spend time alone with that woman. She's disturbed. The family is strange but they're good people. Beth wanted a better job, she killed to get it.
The laws of the universe and all that, so... - I didn't ask to come back here. - No, you didn't. And you hate coming back. The look in your eyes, I've seen it before.
It seems that the lady Uncle Scrooge made her fortune by collecting Nazi stuff. Yes, I think so. According to Marv's records, the watch belonged to a member of Hitler's inner circle. - Where is he now? - I don't know. The police didn't report finding it.
Now... we have congressional elections... next month. After which the people, through the voice of the new Congress, will be able to decide whether or not they want to keep my policies. Until then... I tell you this... control your populations. If you can't do that and you really fear riots... I won't hesitate to use all our Armed Forces to maintain order in this country. Now... I have a job to do and so do you. As your President... I advise you all to do it.
You've put us in a minefield. They're everywhere. The four targets are converging, sir. We can't turn back. This is my minefield. I designed it.
Always trying to earn a penny If you don't have a penny You're a fucking gangster It's time to put it away Yes, it's time to put it away Is this milk still good? - What do you want it for?
- What's the warning? - A possible terrorist cell. An encrypted communication on the Deep Web. I have no idea what this is. The analyst who found it hopes it's just gamers.
- David Mailer? - Yes. Special Agent Grant MacLaren, FBI. I stopped by earlier, left a card under the door. I'm sorry, I didn't see you.
Where's Daewon? Down! - That's not your money. - I invested it. You have to get it back, Nick.
- Yes. - What did they take? - Yes, keep playing dumb. You asked for this. I think you hacked a very sensitive file from Noah's computer and sent it to Emma.
Very good. We're fine. We should send them a message, shouldn't we? Tell them we have the money. - They say we have to take it somewhere.
Karin. He screwed up. He made the document, right? The author's name is in the metadata. But he wiped everything else, so we don't know when he wrote it, for example.
What is it? - Blue? - They look like IMEI numbers to me. What does that mean? Every cell phone has a unique number, an IMEI, which links it to a user.
If I had some Krav Maga lessons, I'd be ready... I'd be ready. Kali ma! I'll get some more wine. I'd offer, but I don't think you can drink it.
I'm sorry, I should have told you this already. So tell me. Her suffering. My mother's suffering... there's a way to make it go away.
That's not what happened. If anyone else wants to leave, I understand. Let's forget about the money. I don't want it. And they're not going to stop me from getting it.
I don't want compensation, I want my son back. What do I do with that money? You can donate it. Do something with it. If you don't want it, stop by my office to sign some papers.
We didn't want to bother you, Judy. How thoughtful. Is that why nobody called me? Because this is the Moncada lab. So I should have been warned when they took it back.
- Yes, in a startup. A small technology company, GenCoin. - I thought I'd do well... - The 2.2 million? I thought I'd put the money to good use! You have to get it back, Nick.
- I'm not going to prison, Nick. - Of course you're not. Listen, you didn't even know. This can disappear. We just have to give it back.
Human-proof. Future-proof. If your code works, then it's genius. - It does. Yes, it really does. I've tested it myself, so...
Spread the word. I want to know who did it. Whether it was a nobody or a big shot. Or someone from Conte who's still upset. With Conte dead, it's bullshit that nobody's in charge. If that's the case, there are still some shits sucking Savastano's dick. Whoever did it, it was my product. And it's like that piece of shit spat in my face.
It's not even ten o'clock yet. What are you, my godfather? The DNA matches. The serial number on the hip matches. If he faked it, he was clever.
Where have you been? I've been looking everywhere for you. Davies has some kind of scrambling device installed. He can't transmit anything. Well... unless we deactivate it.
They put their feet completely on the ground, unlike digigrades, which walk on their toes like lions. This is more like a bear. Okay, so we're looking for a bear. Wait, there's more. The opening angle of the jaw is approximately 120 degrees, so this makes it more snake-like. In addition, there's the difference in length between the forelegs and the hind legs, which makes it more like a hyena.
Mrs. Salvon? Why did you keep your parakeet after the animals mutated? It belonged to my late husband. The bird hated everyone. When Gunter passed away, I wasn't able to quarantine it.
Mitch, come on. Mitch, come on. Listen, guys, if there's another power surge and that fence fails again with us out there or with the plane stationary, it'll be the end of us, okay? I just need a few more minutes. Get back to the plane, and tell Trotter to turn it on.
I need you to work with me, I want to discuss the case. - What case? - Patrick Spring's death. The incident at the Perryman Grand? I was hired to investigate it by the victim.
- Did I burn down your house? - Lydia? She's not here. - Bring me the dog. - Why do you want it?
- Lydia? She's not here. - Bring me the dog. - Why do you want him? - Why did they take him?
Patrick Spring rarely left anything important to chance. When Patrick wanted me to track you down... He knew. He knew he was going to die. I'm beginning to think that Patrick didn't hire me to prevent his murder. I think he hired me to solve it.
Why would you say something like that? What's wrong with you? I'm trying to stay optimistic. Be optimistic. Why didn't they kill us in our sleep and take the map? I don't think they knew we had it.
It worked, right? Cullen did it. Peter Lewis knew about it. He knew enough to imitate the lock mechanism. Not enough to sew it himself.
- What have you done? - Nothing! It started raining garbage out of nowhere, for no reason. All right! My bag burst and I hid the garbage instead of taking it to the bin.
Let's try to get him on the phone. He was lying down, asleep... No, that's not entirely true. There were, for example, Stepin Fetchit, Willie Best Manton Moreand, all of them people who, rightly or wrongly, I abhorred. It seemed to me that they were lying about the world I knew, that they were debasing it, and the truth is that I didn't know anyone like them, as far as I could tell.
Our mission was to acquire a component from Russian travelers and deliver it to another team for testing. The Russian historian had died and they were out of money. We were then instructed to finance them by bartering, but they became greedy. - Were they attacked by travelers? They rebelled, they wanted the money and the component, probably to sell it on.
- You have to buckle up! - Don't try to stop me, please. Come on, now. I'm not going anywhere with you. All the other passengers will die, but you were chosen to live. Be humble, be grateful and get your ass out of that seat before I drag you out.
Here she is. - What if I don't do this? - How? What if I refuse the procedure? Why wouldn't I? She dies horribly.
I do. His name is Cumelius. The empire that will one day rule the Ancient World begins as a small, ambitious republic aspiring to absolute power. Power can be good or bad. What really matters is who holds that power, what motivates them and how they use it.
Those that were not defeated in battle entered into peace agreements. Among these are the Icenes, who had been at war with Rome for two decades. Their leader, King Prasutagus, accepted the empire's peace conditions. We had already seen this tactic in Germania, it was typical of the Romans. They offer a treaty, an agreement with the tribe. If they sign it, they are a friend, an ally of Rome.

- Iron Hill murders. - They didn't find Eddie. Remember Candle Cove? That show gave me the worst nightmares. Katie just saw it.
It's incredible. Can I come in and see you? No, Patrick, I'm very busy. With all this. - I can't wait to see you at home.
And no, I haven't been promoted to assistant manager, but thanks for reminding me that I'm not. Emily, it's like you don't have a sensitivity sensor. - Is it a sensor? - Yes, it is. - It's a sensor and she doesn't have it.
You really killed it. I knew this zombie. He was my doctor. - Somebody kill him! - Someone already killed him.
Comedy trio? No, I'm a solo act. No, we won't take your stupid check, okay? Okay. We don't want it.
Who are you? I'm bringing a present for the junior commander. What present? Let me see it! You can even see it, but I don't think your rank is high enough.
How quickly do you think this kid can be fucking radicalized? Before, he wasn't going to be radicalized at all. So what he's trying to do is defeat hatred with hatred. And hate doesn't beat hate. It never has.
- Well done. That's an interesting interpretation of that quote. It's the only interpretation. It perfectly illustrates the precariousness of the black man today. That's why I painted it.
Nothing. Why are you here? I came to talk to your father about the jeep. But I wanted to see if anyone had stolen your new place in the park. I don't see why they would.
What a dummy. Let me show you a little trick. Very good. Take a look. First you have to line up the nail, then give it a tap and you don't have to hold it any longer, you can drop it.
It's a bullshit statement she prepared this morning. - What did you accuse her of? - I'm sorry, sir. But I find it very convenient that you don't have the testimony written down in a notebook or on a piece of paper, from the same decade in which it happened. - We found it very inconvenient. Georgina Casey didn't write it down at the time because she didn't do a good job representing her client.
Yes. Permission granted. Ms. Casey, when you were Leonard Bailey's defense attorney, did he tell you that, at the time of the murders, he was in the apartment of a woman named Maria Gomez? Yes. Which means that not only did he have an alibi, but a witness who confirmed it, correct?
I have to tell you how important this is to me. This movie has to go well, or I'll be someone's slave forever. You seem to be in a difficult business. It's true. This movie will give me my independence, if we can finish it and if it turns out well. And to make it good, we need money.
This became a focal point of the entire presidential campaign. Horton escaped, kidnapped a young couple, stabbed the man and repeatedly raped the girl. Weekend stints in prison. Dukakis on the crime. Dukakis had protected the program and vetoed an attempt to repeal it by allowing murderers to get out of prison for the weekend.
This dildo here. - Are you crazy? - No. I'm your worst nightmare. Because this dildo shaking with rage won't go away until it's satisfied. What did you just say? I said this dildo will be in your face, slapping it all over. And then up your ass, marching you out the door if you catch it in violation of your lease again.
- I just don't know. I've bought a place. I've got Nathan and the council on my side. Bullshit. None of you have the balls to take me on. I'm not here to take you on. I'm here to buy back your shares at a nice profit, so you can use it to hire whoever you want to be your lawyer, because it sure as hell isn't going to be me.
- What's that? - It's all here. In that case, I ask that the license of that company be suspended. And for that same reason, I would like to ask the court to remove Mr. Cahill from any investigation concerning my client in the future. - Have you lost your mind? We have an antagonistic past, Your Honor. Everyone knows it, and this action is nothing more than a stunt to punish me through my client.
You asked me why I drank that night. I found out that what I'd worked so hard on to get that idiot's approval was just a lie. - Your negotiation program. - Yes, my program. Turns out he wasn't even using it.
I don't want to know. - I want to know where the hell you got it. - I don't know, but that's not the only question we have to answer. - What's the other question? - I don't know if you realized it, but you have an employee who wants to destroy you. We have to find out who it is.
Finding a drugged witness? Drugged or not, Maria Gomez never had a chance to be heard. - If you'll excuse me... - I'm not going anywhere. Not until I realize that if you feel sorry for me, you wouldn't even take this case in the first place, instead of using it to try and make a name for yourself. That's enough.
Harvey, we're in the middle of rebuilding. - If you lose, we'll be on our knees. - Jessica, the guy is guilty. And you're his lawyer and you took the case. I'd never take it if it wasn't to get Mike out.
Mike, sit down. I need to talk to you. You had to talk to me yesterday when Cahill pulled out of the deal. He says it was the people above him. I didn't want to tell you until I knew how to get it back.
Was she a star third baseman? No, man. Look, McCoy gave it to Maya and Maya gave it to me. People give me things all the time. I didn't want it, but I didn't want to offend her, so, you know, it's yours if you want it.
- I'll open my company and bury him next to Andre. They deserve each other. Well done. Do you feel better now that you've got that off your chest? I love your passion, I really do, but I'm not going to let you do this business. Why not? Because you can't stand it, on several levels.
Yeah, nothing much. Just rudimentary science. Maybe saving the day. Think of her brain as a computer that's been compromised by... errors and glitches. If we turn it off and restart it, then... the parts of her brain that have been hyperactivated - should return to normal.
So, in that highly secure building... there's one of the servers for the non-human registration database. I know how my own agency operates, thank you. Every day, at the same time, Agent Elizabeth Albee brings a "drive" with updated information to this location. - I'm going to steal your ID badge... - So I can clone it... and put a fake ID over it.
- Stand back, please. - Get out of here! Dr. Bauer, please, where's the book? Sir, please, I need you to step back. I buried it in the same place I found it!
So, suggestions, ideas? This is a safe place. We have to talk to Eli Morrow again. He's the one who knows this book. And he'll know why Lucy Bauer wants it and her next move.
I need to get a 20. So what's changed? Why does Lucy Bauer think she can succeed this time? She has the book. Yeah, but... she had it before too.
Is that what taught you to build it? The book... helped, yes. I want to know more about it. Well, all I know is that... it's a very powerful piece of technology. It's like a tablet that can read your mind. Very intimidating, frankly, which is why we asked Aida to read it.
Any of these would be happy to kill our family if it helps their goals. So, you know, it's fun to live with. Listen to me. It's just that stalkers often have a personal relationship with their victims. I had a bad feeling about this kid at the time, and I still do.
Ma'am, I just got some news from a guy at the Post. They've got the copy of the discord memo, and they're about to publish it. Well, that's a disaster. Did he... Did he say how he got it?
I'd rather my team didn't see me being led away by security. I know it wasn't you who leaked the memo. That's not what my memoirs will say. And if you think I'm going to report someone... No, I really don't want to know who leaked it.
Sorry about the investigation. Are you offering donuts from my own department as an apology? Yes. Let's say it's more of a thank you than an apology. Leaking that memo, whoever leaked it...
Onwards and backwards to feed him. Three hours on the bus every day. Why didn't you just tell us you had a cat? No. The little one has asthma and he knew that if I brought the cat, they'd say to bring it, it would cause problems.
There will always be life in the ocean, but it won't necessarily be the life we want. We could go back 3 billion years and be filled with silt. We are removing the ecosystems that have helped stabilize the climate. Like the oceans, tropical forests absorb carbon from the atmosphere. For decades and decades, forests have absorbed carbon dioxide and stored it in their trunks, leaves and organic matter.
Nice robot. What's your big vision for all this? The goal of the Gigafactory is to lower the price of batteries so that they are affordable. Batteries are crucial for the future of sustainable energy. The sun doesn't always shine, we have to store it in a battery.
Does that name mean anything to you, sir? No, not really. Sorry, sir. So, about the car. You... didn't report it missing?
No foreplay? No foreplay? Take it easy there, kid. No foreplay. Search the place. I want you to find him.
- It's too late. He took a plane to Europe this morning. Okay? I see, he's very angry. That you have your own plane and he can't fly it.
Don't let me down. I can't believe you told Maul I have a holocron. He was on our side at the time. Is it still in the Ghost? Where else would you keep it?
That's what he said, Ezra. But we still need him to save our friends, Kanan. So are you going to give it back or not? The object you're looking for is the source of the imbalance between you and your teacher. If you want it, you must look for it with him.
I'll probably feel like crying... - Just be yourself. - I know! I don't want to disappoint you. I don't want to let the country down. I hate this, they chose it.
Maybe we won't have to break it... If Ralph gives us the code. Okay, cards on the table, I'm not great with computers. While most kids were learning how to use their first laptop, I was taking mine apart to see how it worked. I never really understood how, but I learned enough to do this: the biggest flaw in any computer system is usually in the person using it.
We're fine. We're fine. To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure? I wanted to know how you were feeling. Thanks to you and your Martian blood, I'm almost 100%. I hope you don't want it back.
Bogdan escaping from prison is a good thing. We detected him and saved Sebastian. You don't even know when they'll escape. When Sebastian called Pride's cell phone, he left a digital trail. Maybe I can trace it.
Where's your father? Where's my dog? They said I was coming here to pick up my dog. Right, let's talk about your dog. - When did you get him?
You must have changed the babies. No, it's the stench of the Croods. I have one final test for you. Did you recapture the buffalo? Yes, by pointing and sending seven hunters to catch it for me.
- Do you think it's illegal? - It has to be, doesn't it? Why else would Jared hide it here? - What's more, where did he get it? - Maybe he robbed a bank.
But it wasn't... it wasn't an incitement to action. There's no incitement to action in the book itself. How many times have you read the book? I haven't read it since I wrote it.
SUSPENDED BRIDGE "The only laws that an individual can truly respect and follow are those that he instills in himself. For a real man there is only one option, and that is revolution." ELECTRONICS, SABOTAGE AND SURVEILLANCE "This country, with its institutions, belongs to its people. When they get fed up with the existing government, they can exercise the constitutional right to correct it, or the revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it."
We thought we'd lost it during the curse, but now we think it might be somewhere in Storybrooke. There must be some magical way of finding it, right? There's a spell that can show the way as a kind of guide. But we won't be the only ones to see it. If Gold or the Queen or even Zelena see it, they'll know exactly what it is.
Quite an arsenal you have here, by the way. Actually, it's more of a collection. I see you've searched my apartment, haven't you? Of course, without a warrant, it's an illegal search. It doesn't change the fact that you have it.
A what? It's a virtual bug in the cable. - Used to steal data. - He never reported a hack. Whoever planted it was very good.
Because... I'm not trying to catch you or anything. It could be recorded. Yes, the video was embarrassing. When I saw it for the first time, I was...
We have to shift the dollars from expensive procedures more in the direction of education, teaching people, showing them about their disease and why it's there, teaching them the things they can do on a daily basis that would certainly have an impact on that disease They can expect arterial disease to stabilize, reverse and symptoms to go away. They can expect type 2 diabetes, if it really is type 2 diabetes, to be cured 100% of the time with a change in diet and the associated weight loss. They can expect arthritis to improve, disappear and be cured, often if it is inflammatory arthritis. Intestinal problems, from indigestion to constipation to colitis, you can expect to be cured when you turn your attention to the cause of the problem and solve it.
The sales arguments have worked, people are taking them. They're buying these things. And the people selling them are sticking to it tooth and nail and won't give in to the scientific truth. But the reality is that all the nutrients we need are in food and they're there in very specific and complex combinations that we don't even understand all of yet. So when we extract a nutrient, purify it and put it in a pill, we're overloading the system with something it's never seen before and isn't adapted to.
My approach is to try to make it as fun as possible. I use colors, flavors, teach them a little something they didn't know, use gadgets that normal people don't see. But I want them to leave with a sense of achievement and something they can't wait to share with their friends. And hopefully with their parents. I think that's the best part. It's like holding a bird. You don't want to squeeze it too hard, you'll hurt the bird.
And hopefully with their parents. I think that's the best part. It's like holding a bird. You don't want to squeeze it too hard, you'll hurt the bird. You don't want to leave it too loose, otherwise it'll run away.
I have 6 names on my list who all belong to a private chat group. Some kind of bullying support group? It's called the Anti-Terrorism Squad, but, yes, that's exactly what it is. It's an analogy. Bullying can seem like terrorism to those who suffer it.
Sabine came to get us out of here. We owe it to her. - We need to try. - So, what's your plan? I'll tell you when I have it.
Captain Hera Syndulla. I'd like to say the same, Admiral. It's a shame that our first meeting will be... Well, perhaps the last. I'll keep your Kalikori in a place of honor. If I'd known you were going to get it, I would have destroyed it.
Don't be so impatient. How close would it be to set off the bomb? It's a long-range transmitter, it didn't have to be suicidal, if that's what you thought. He was trying to quit smoking and that's what actually killed him. The killer mixed a cyanide analog into his nicotine patch 20 minutes before he put it on, by oxidizing the patch.
- Yes, but then - Gibbs wants me to... - He wants to find out where the earring came from. Of course he does. Okay, all I can tell you is that the original owner was a woman. Do you know how long Bruno wore it?
- Gabby, I'll put it right. I promise. Hello. The brunette, Lizzie, gave me her number. - I said to make sure you get it.
Oh my God, it sounds awful when I say it out loud. God, please don't give up. No more personal things. You've seen my work; you know I can do it.
- I can still take it. I got into the game ahead of the recruits, but are you really going to reveal your fake name? I'm taking something from them, even if they don't know it. And if I don't give them something real in return, they'll never trust me or the CIA. And I won't use it again either.
- I remember. But it's different when you're little. You have a big heart, Sam, and that doesn't go away. A good thing. Focus on that positive thing and see where it takes you.
Go on, Szymon. What do you need from me? I'd like you to stay here with my insect collection. I can't take it with me. I want it to be well guarded.
You can't hide this face. Uh... yeah... It's much worse than I imagined. There's a girl back there. She's a... child.
Down with Vortigern! You seem to have found a way to use the sword. I wasn't controlling it. Give it to me. She was controlling me.
- Where there was a desert - ... for life. The sun shining... Right, our second course will be a salad, consisting of a mixture of... I rebelled against kindness. I thought she had tricked me.
when we see the eyes of the worm, Linda. Come out here and face me. Yes. Show me your face. Oh, here she comes.
-Ready, tough guy? -Yes. It works! This thing really gets me. It perfects Bully's dominant side.
You're not even blowing at her. You're spitting at it. How strange! Maybe the wood you collected was damp, tough guy. According to my manual, it should light right away.
Now! Stop it, Azrael. I can't calibrate the machine with your incessant screaming. Yes, Azrael, listen to her. She purrs like a kitten.
I'll leave. I need a minute alone with him. Are you so cruel as not to let a daughter say goodbye to her father? Eternity can give up a minute. When this door closes, it won't open again.
With "denim, mademoiselle... but I've come to escort you to your room. My room? - I thought... - What? That "when this door closes, it won't open again".
We were closer than we had ever been. Danny... Remember that day on the train... The man with the box? Do you remember looking inside the box? Yes. What was in it?
Thank you. This is the best campsite around, and nobody even knows about it. How do you know about it? I just know, right? I'm at peace with nature, and it shows me the way.
This is the best campsite around, and nobody even knows about it. How do you know about it? I just know, right? I'm at peace with nature, and it shows me the way. She shows you the way.
Jacob, do something! Dell? Look at me, look at me. What happened to your hand, man? What's wrong with it?
What's all this? Objects I found with my father. Most of them are his. Where's the cage? - Here it is.
I can't. Yes, you can. You just have to give in. It's the life you want and I can give it to you. You were looking for freedom and here it is.
More like... modern-day electricity. Is that a good thing? It depends, it depends on the intention behind the fire. The major also gave us a date, the day after tomorrow. If you read these stars, you'll find that same date, and it points you here.
I need to change that. Change Sivagami? The sun can't rise in the west Bhalla. The sun will never rise in the west but I will bury it in the east. Sivagami, you've been feeding a snake all this time. Now it's spitting out its poison. In a few days it will bite you.
This isn't real! This isn't... Teen Wolf - 6x06 "Ghosted" Okay. You've heard a voice coming out of the radio, and now you're convinced that it's the voice of...
I saw her. And her head... It looked like someone had bitten a chunk out of it. That wasn't real. Yes, but it looked real. The energy here... It causes hallucinations.
- That's comforting. What's a breach supposed to look like? It's a tear in the fabric of our world. In theory it could look like anything from a microscopic black hole to a floating Einstein-Rosen bridge. I really hope it doesn't stay up there.
No, no, no, no! Stop it! The Ghost Rider's whip didn't go deep enough to take him, but it left a gash in his back. He was thrown into the pond and the wound became infected in the water. It mixed with the fluid in the solution and actually made it stronger.
Well done. Why don't you go and have some fun? What the hell am I looking for? The bug-creature called Yar. She's trying to get revenge on the evil Qootile for the destruction of Razak IV.
And they know it. And that's why they're so afraid of you and me. If we can take Nassau, if we can show that England is not inevitable, if we can incite a revolt that spreads throughout the New World... Then, yes... I imagine people will notice. "Too much sanity can be madness, and the greatest madness of all is to see life as it is and not as it should be."
And if that's what you need, then I want to make it work. I'm not going to lose you, Eric. I love you. No, Nicole, listen to me. I know what this life is like and what it does to people and families...
The one with whom you can have a life, if you put aside your pride. Don't make the same mistake I did. Accept the deal. The voice you hear in your head... I wonder who it sounds like, because I know Eleanor wanted such things.
Of course, you're probably right. Whatever happens, everything will be fine. I used to spend a lot of time looking at the past and thinking, what if I'd made other choices? And then... I realized that I love my life as it is.
- I never thought much about eggs. I always thought they were part of a normal healthy diet. But then I came across a study suggesting that eating just one egg a day could be as bad as smoking five cigarettes a day for life expectancy. - The yolk of a hen's egg is the highest concentration of saturated fat and cholesterol. It is made to feed a baby hen for 21 days without any external energy.
They think: "Oh, my parents had diabetes, I'm going to get it too." And about cancer, they certainly don't think that way. - People have bad lifestyles that they've inherited. Environmentally, they have been exposed to a certain way of eating and living that has accompanied them all their adult lives, and which is passed on to their children. That's why they develop the same diseases as their parents and grandparents, but it's not inevitable. - Even if you have a genetic predisposition, that doesn't mean it will necessarily manifest itself.

What determines whether it manifests or not can be those epigenetic variables, the things we control, environmental factors, dietary factors, lifestyle factors.
Apart from feeling like a big failure... Great. How did you do that? You activated a rune without your stele. I don't know. I saw you lying there and it appeared on its own.
- Well? - What's wrong? I made it all up. The spear is the MacGuffin. The what? The thing in the movie that everyone tries to catch. - Well, where is it?
And I've always dreamed of creating the ultimate warrior. Now that dream is a reality. You've always been my best creation, son. Always! I haven't been to this hut for years. I think it's over this hill. There it is.
I don't think this is a good idea. Are you having a whispering argument? Just say what you've got. Yes. So, I found this syringe at the crime scene. It had a bit of poison in it so, yes, in theory, someone out there could have been injected.
I... I know. It's a lot to take in, isn't it? I don't... I don't understand, Azrael's blade, it should have destroyed you and not sent you to Hell.
But they never tell you what you need. You know what works? Always? Nothing. You know, when I leave that door closes, it stays shut, and you're left in the dark.
How bad is it? Sam. Where are you? A farmhouse down the road. It looks abandoned.
The older and more arcane, the better. So I can present to you the Spear of Michael the Archangel. Impressive. This beauty, she kills the bad guys quickly and the good guys slowly and painfully. Ironic, given that it was made by an angel.
The truth is, we stopped caring a long time ago. Asmodeus has his hobbies. Dagon has his toys. We're happy as we are. So if you want the crown, it's yours.
Are you out of your minds? You know what, Crowley? When you freed Gavin to live in our time and possibly screw up all of human history, we didn't hunt him down, right? So I guess you owe us. You and Bullwinkle take care of this mess before it erupts.
Pull over, please. All right, Crowley. Crowley, shut up. I mean it. Ramsey dragged him back... To her lair. Well, it's empty.
This is Dean's other cell phone, so he should know what to do. Dean, call me. We have a problem. Hello, Mary. Your palm won't open this room because it's not for you.
What are you talking about? Not about that illusion of yours that you keep clinging to. The perfect life. A husband who loves you and children. But she was never perfect, was she?
There weren't any. Crowley, one more thing. What's that? Your relationship with the Winchesters. She's a little cozy for my taste.
Each of them had years of experience. We received a letter from Eileen. From Eileen? She sent it four days ago. It came by regular mail because she thought that both her cell phone and her computer had been hacked.
No. Then you do it! Kill me. My whole life, all I ever had, apart from my family, was my will. And it's going.
I... - Well, I... - She lied. What? Mary's programming... She's permanent.
I really appreciate this, Dad. You don't thank me... You take it for granted and don't appreciate it. You don't even realize it, truth be told, but you will when it's lacking, by the grace of God. As far as I know, the point of God's grace is that it doesn't ask for anything in return? Only love and devotion.
AIDS was only identified in 1981. HIV wasn't known to be the cause until '83. These things take time to reveal themselves, even to doctors. Would you say that your illness affects your ability to think clearly? No, it affects me physically.
I take you out of the mailroom, I put you in law school, I'm your mentor. You go out, stab me in the back and it's my fault? I'm not lifting this. Kim, your debt is forgiven. But you'll pay for everything else. All we've done is show you the situation as it is.
It would still be there if he were alive. Dad hid something... under it. He buried a key. What's it for?
Of course I was terrified. Pain is so strange. A coyote killing your dog, kids falling off their bikes and skinning their knees, watching helplessly as a loved one dies. Then the pain comes, there it is, so real and, to those watching, we look like idiots.
Are you in charge of a labor camp or "The School of Assassins"? Security is my responsibility, and I was handling the situation. Yes. I clearly had this under control. One of the reasons I was sent here was to bring down the rate of fights between inmates. If it doesn't drop, maybe I'll explain your methods to them.
Yes, I've changed, many times. Henry, is the juniper tree still there? The one near the infirmary. - Yes. - It has the softest grass.
The Occupation is sending more and more people to the Factory every month. We're just a workforce for them, and they're burning us like firewood. And it's not just the file. Broussard and his team found a countdown hidden in the raps' communications. It ends the very day the block is empty.
They just want us all to be at the ranch. They cared who got the RAP. That's a problem I solved. Because you were involved. You're just throwing shit at the wall and hoping it sticks.
Tycho t.C. refuses to release the clips until Fred Johnson gives his personal authorization. And he hasn't. All right, I'll take care of it. I don't have to let you out, you know. With all the time and repairs I've put into this ship, it's more mine than yours.
That's how life works: as much as we want to control it, we don't always know where it's taking us. Change is scary, isn't it, darling? Let's go to the kitchen. Everyone is afraid of change, but when life shouts at you "this is your new truth", you have to accept it, be bold, brave and live your new truth, whatever it may be.
- No. But it's like... You get used to your gun and when you're without it, - you feel incomplete. - Yes, but we have permission. I'm trying not to think, but it's not working. Where is it?
I've started reading the second book and so far no mirrors... like portals or entrances to nowhere. So don't worry about me. I'm already worried enough. Nick, we're the only ones who've seen this thing. If we don't go after it, it will come after us.
Did they bury a wand? It's always the same reaction. - It's more than that. - It's not just any wand. On the one hand, it can heal.
- It took blood - Hexenbiest's to get through. - A wand? That's how Nick went after Eve. - The wand didn't get through. - She couldn't.
You can't stop it. The water. It has to keep rising. And there's nothing we can do about it. - It takes what it wants.
- He agrees. Belle... I never meant to hurt you or Rocky. I know that. Sometimes I feel like I let life take me where it wanted.
I turned 24 last year. I've been busy. Art is over for me. Or rather, I'm done with art. She spoke, and said:
Cool, I'll send you the details. Bye, man. Guys, I've only been in the VC world for one day and I already have a seat to watch the Warriors. You hate basketball. I admit that spending my time in a house with you nerds, the Incredible Shrinking Hendricks and whatever Jared is may have compromised my masculinity but it's there.
At my signal. I was so sure... I assume this isn't where she's building the damn thing. No, this is where she's building it. It's just... not in this world. And now I know what she's going to do.
Maybe you'll experience that now... With you. Destroy this body for sure. It was only designed to kill. My head, which you severed... is controlling many of these machines now. And you don't know where it is.
I like that. This guy put aside a lot of savings. You know, it says here that his housekeeper just left, moved to Sacramento. Maybe that's my role. This guy would fall in love with a slug if it wore a dress and a bra.
Summon Merlin! Prepare to fight our way out of here if Merlin decides against us. That's Star Girl. What are you doing in Camelot? This ship... It never ceases to amaze me.
How are you, girlfriend? Getting there. Here's a little something to boost your spirits. So I've finished the diagnostic tests on this little beauty. And she, my friend, is in top form.
For Hope. It's precisely because of her that I have to affirm my involvement. So, brother, tell me what you know. That thing wants to be reborn. Vincent told me that when it reappears, it does so in four different places.
He has followers everywhere. They've infiltrated the whole city. If they reach the other bones before we do... They'll try to revive this monstrosity. And it will come after all of us.
Tyler Lockwood. So the bone is in Mystic Falls. This thing has followers everywhere. If they reach the other bones before we do... They'll try to revive this monstrosity. And it will come after all of us.
Do you have a moment? Please come in. Your letter, suggesting that we send maidens here to be married in due course. Thank you, Governor. So that our directors can evaluate your proposal more favorably, I have informed the "Virginia Company" that it was, in fact, written by me.
It's too late. What do you mean, it's too late? Bailey! How is it too late? Because I heard a ballad once... and it made me a soldier.
I sleep very well. I'm not the one who left my brother to die. If you think anyone sees you as a man of justice, you're wrong. You have jealousy stamped on your face like a scar for all the world to see. Can't you recognize true devotion when it stares you in the face?
Yes. A Midsummer Night's Dream. I didn't know either, but I looked it up. It looks like the finger is here, but then it's not. My grandfather lost part of his right leg in Vietnam and he felt it was there too.
Then you are the new Keeper of the Flame. This is a sacred space. Leave before you hurt yourself. Give me the Flame. It doesn't belong to you or your red-blooded king.
You have to be proud, face it... No! You're the worst around Everything will bring you down. All right, Milhouse, I'll throw a rock. Watch where it lands.
The suitcase needs restocking Well, why don't you forget the suitcase? The house may still be standing, Matt, but some things are beyond repair. Like my office window. Today it just... broke.
My fingerprints were on them That's why we didn't touch them No Caroline was killed with my gun She had been robbed
- Great what? You've just committed an illegal act. What is this shit? Do you see this camera? It sees you.
What's going on? - What's wrong? - I want our old life back. I'm so sorry. It doesn't exist anymore, darling.
- Maybe you need to try harder. - Get out of my way immediately... You won't shoot me. You don't have the guts like all the rest of the art world imposters around here. You wouldn't recognize real art if it fell on you...
Yes. I'm getting close, doctor. It's a complicated case, and I'm still not entirely sure if the patient is really infected. We need a prognosis as soon as possible. If his illness turns out to be fatal, I'd hate for it to spread.
What did you just say to me? I said... whoever broke your heart must have really done a number on you. You know absolutely nothing about me. I know what pain feels like. And I see it in you, and I know how it can harden a person.
Of course. Oh, thank you. Ooh, a coffee machine, huh? Yes, it's a beauty. Oh, she's beautiful.
Get back! We were brought here for a reason, Gaia. Just think. Is there another key? It has to have a 12 inscribed on it.
What does that mean? This thing lodged itself in David's brain when he was a child. Maybe even a baby. And it's been there, feeding on him, ever since. The memories. Memories, that's right. Every time David sees this thing, or realizes it's there, this creature makes him forget.
Rewrite his memory. Is that why we couldn't see him? I think so, yes. And I think it also made you forget. This thing has a lot of power. You say it's she who's powerful, not David?
We are drawn like moths to the flame. We started experimenting with fire and using it for other things besides producing warmth and protection. The origins of cooking gave Homo Sapiens a new future on Earth. Cooking has done wonderful things for us. It gave us more energy and more free time, and it enabled us to have a big brain.
It was a simple mixture: coal, the product of fire, potassium nitrate and sulphur. The result: gunpowder. This invention gave the Chinese a chance against their most powerful enemy and paved the way for a new type of warfare for decades to come. This simple mixture of saltpeter and sulphur contains one of the most destructive innovations in human history. The irony of gunpowder is that it was first conceived as an elixir of immortality, then this elixir of immortality paradoxically became the recipe for mortality.

This simple mixture of saltpeter and sulphur contains one of the most destructive innovations in human history. The irony of gunpowder is that it was first conceived as an elixir of immortality, then this elixir of immortality paradoxically became the recipe for mortality. Once that revolution started, it couldn't be stopped.
The Chinese were the first to use it against the Mongols, but the Mongols used it in the Middle East and then in Europe and everyone learned from each other how to use this new technology and how to fight with it. The transformation of warfare by the introduction of gunpowder at the beginning of the Middle Ages was nothing short of magnificent. Rolled weapons were replaced by projectiles, against which the armor of medieval knights was useless. Plebeians with no training until then, let alone money, could fire projectiles and kill. When you look at gunpowder, you see modernity, you see everything from chemistry in its creation... to the destructive power it has on a battlefield... but also in terms of how much it destroys the old political and social structures, i.e.,
As life evolved over the centuries, plants began to colonize the Earth. The last ingredient in the recipe for fire. Soon, the surface of the Earth was a lighter waiting to create a spark. The explosion of thunder and lightning would ignite this spark. The "Age of Fire" had begun. For 350 million years, fire swept across the planet. Life on Earth was forced to confront the monster it had created.
Our progress runs parallel to our relationship with fire, charcoal, gunpowder, coal and oil. The next big step could be fusion, i.e. recreating how stars transform matter into energy. That's incredible. Fusion as an energy source is very attractive. It would be a carbon-free energy source that could supply humanity forever.
Religion tells us that death is not the end. The flesh is weak, but the soul survives. We can be reborn in endless curves of reincarnation, or live forever in the kingdom of heaven. For our ancestors, religion offered more than consolation. It offered a cure for suffering.
Isn't that a bit sad? No, not really. It's like the soul, you know? Nobody knows for sure if it exists.
Marcus, how do we choose? We've already chosen. Clarke's list. It was always our best chance of survival. And I know where she is.
Do you know that if you had possessed the Flaming Sword, the weapon that guarded Eden, the weapon that can cut through anything, even the very Gates of Heaven? Well, you would have defeated that rebellion. Why are you digging around in the past? The fact is, I didn't have that sword, and Father destroyed it shortly afterwards, so... What if I told you that the sword was right here on Earth? And that it's already in your possession?
They're good for the environment. Well, there's no way of telling who our suspect is. I have news from the lab. They were able to take an impression of a handrail outside my apartment. It matches the partial we found from the first model.
- Yes. It was both our fault. This is good, we're throwing all the shit out, so we can watch it jump around. - Why would shit jump? - She must have meant fish.
Molly... - Morgenstern. - Very controversial. Emma, your skin isn't like butter. - It is butter.
- You hypocrite. - Okay, we... Remember your brief credibility? Do you miss her? Is she keeping up with the news?
I brought a lashing. We learned something today, didn't we, Jack? Riley was supposed to do this part of the job. Remind me to tell Jack about the second rule of thermodynamics. It says that the entropy in any system will always go down over time.
Right, I'll take care of the Internet connection. You get the plane for him. So we're letting them go? Commander, didn't you hear me? Why let him upload the tape if it proves his guilt?
I've finished untying everything. Now will you teach me? You've finished the first step. Next up is the table. What about it?
How? Finally. Where's the last piece? I don't have it, I swear I don't have it! The stone's transformative powers can only be activated if it is complete, only then can my life be restored.
Dreyfuss may be far away, but we're one step ahead. If we get the last piece of the talisman first, we'll ruin his plan. Can this thing really make him immortal? It has incomparable transmutative power. But it has one limitation: it can't create something out of nothing.
Excalibur. If she's from the Mutata Weapon, does she want it for the same reasons as Dreyfuss? To summon the War Knight? You know what this weapon is, don't you? Do you know what it was made for?
Previously in Sleepy Hollow... Dreyfuss won't rest until he gets his hands on the gun. She wakes up the War Knight.
It's hard to imagine that this, when united with her "brothers", is as powerful as God. But right now she's just a useless piece of wood. It's not useless. I know ten different ways to kill someone with this. Not to mention that it's great for scratching hard-to-reach places.
Well, that's remarkable. The Spear must be composed of some kind of magnetized compound that acts as its own sealant. No, no, no, don't, don't, don't. Don't touch it. Now that the Spear is whole, it will try to attract each of us to attract it.
The Spear must be made of some kind of magnetized compound that acts as its own sealant. No, no, no, don't do it, don't do it, don't. Don't touch it. Now that the Spear is whole, it will try to draw each of us to it. It will use our weaknesses, our desires, our flaws.
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't. Don't touch it. Now that the Spear is whole, it will try to draw each one of us to it. It will use our weaknesses, our desires, our flaws. It will promise each of us that it will be able to remake the world as we want it to be.
- Give it to me. - And don't steal the relics. Now, if I'm not mistaken, the inscription is written in... Proto-Celtic. It says: "Follow the annex, then push further forward".
According to this map, the blood of Christ is hidden right in the middle of no man's land. Yes, right in the center of the bloodiest battle in human history. Even if we manage to get through the terrain unscathed, there's still the problem of the precise location of the blood. That's good news. Just as the Spear acted like a magic wand for its parts, it will glow when it is near the blood of Jesus.
Don't you get it, man? Your impulse was a scar of reality on your subconscious. - Scar of reality. - What does this funny weapon do? In theory... it looks for irregularities in the hippocampus, acting as a "Z-Control" for memories.
but to cooperate because we can both benefit from the fruits of this business. People have this need to obtain vital goods. This type of exchange intensified over the centuries, so efficient ways of trading had to be developed. We're talking about currency, real objects that had a fixed value. Suddenly, we have this idea of currency and it starts thousands of years of a journey into the abstract nature of money.
We can say that the agora and money were part of the origin of democracy. Money has an almost hypnotic power to unify, fulfill desires and lead to progress. But with money comes greed. As the Greeks taught us with the myth of King Midas, reducing everything to its pure economic value may allow us to build mountains of gold, but it destroys our humanity. Greed may be good on Wall Street, but it drives humans to acts of great evil.
How did you hear about it? Have you ever been to Mont Saint Michel? A tide-dependent island in Normandy. The only way in was via a path that disappeared at high tide. Getting to the other side was a question of knowing when the tide was coming in and seizing the opportunity before it rose.
There is something we can teach you. If you can learn this thing, really master it, you can continue to see him. You'll get better, Pashenka. Don't mind me, man. The first time I played, I threw the ball so hard that it hit the line next to me and knocked down some other guy's pins.
Fuck you, Maddie. Don't try to get to know me, Ezra. I'm not worth it. If it's all just pretend, then why did you keep this? Why would you keep a stupid bracelet if it didn't mean something?
Don't try to get to know me, Ezra. I'm not worth it. If it's all just pretend, then why did you keep this? Why would you keep a stupid bracelet if it didn't mean something? It meant something.
These tools have given us self-expression and collective knowledge, but they have a dark side. These tools are so powerful that they can distort our perception of reality. They can subvert and corrupt and even manipulate entire populations. Communication is what makes us us. How has it turned us into creatures capable of dreaming?
Oral stories like the Odyssey weren't just told, they were sung. For centuries, Africans used percussion to send messages over long distances. As knowledge and ideas spread through music, lyrics became the first viral method of communication. Music has given us a deeper way of communicating. It expanded our color palette for self-expression, giving us the ability to communicate the ineffable.
This is not something neutral. What Tyndale did is similar to what we see happening today with various hackers. Before Assange, Snowden or Anonymous, I mean, Tyndale really decoded the language and explained what the Bible really said, the truth that was hidden. And when this information came out and became transparent, it empowered people and this is something that can really change the world.
They bring us news, follow our behavior, analyzing exactly what we like, where we like it and how we like it, based on just one click. We can no longer hide who we are. There is a direct line from the first words exchanged between two humans to the instant messages we exchange over the internet today. We have a deep-seated desire to reach out, to connect and to share information. Communication has been the key to our survival because it has changed our ability to develop and guided our evolution.
I think I must have been the most depressed person on the planet when I took this route. I see an ecosystem that I fell in love with dying in front of me. That said, I'm not actually depressed. And that's because there's been a big change. You look at every climate change action and it's aimed at improving people's lives.
Good. We need to talk. About Chen. I found a translator for the latest intercepted message from Chen's people. - What does it say?
- I don't doubt it. - Seriously, Nick. You need to promise me you'll be careful around these guys. You're lucky to be alive. Luck has a funny way of evaporating when you need it. If the bomb was meant to kill me, it would.
Stay there. You've already taken all our supplies and resources. My people have boarded that ark, ready to leave our beloved land before it is totally destroyed.
I'll put a stop to it. You have to tell me. I need to know. Where did the knife come from? What does it mean?
-Tell your beast to stop! -Get out of the way. Let's go. You're not leaving here with that knife. It doesn't belong to you.
Take him to the holding cells. Hey, be careful with that. Commander, I've found two more. Droids? We were on the ship when it was stolen.
And ten minutes later I got the call... that the court had ruled in our favor. The court found that if Backpage actively helped develop the sex ads on its website and was not just a passive host, then Backpage should not be protected by Article 230. The case was allowed to proceed to trial. I was absolutely elated. We had waited almost a year to get that decision and it allowed us to proceed with this case.
The device is connected to your phone. - Test it. - Right. I'm going to look at some images to get emotional responses, and we'll see if the machine can identify them. It only identifies happy, sad, angry and excited.
My sensors show that the bomb is in this building. We have to get past Maximus and disarm it. Destroying one of the largest human cities will show that Humans and Inhumans can never live in harmony. This beast needs to learn a lesson. Keep going, it's regenerating.
Run, Ginger. I'm ahead of you, Eddie. - I'll hold him off. - Kensi, we have a fugitive. In fact, she's walking.
Why would you do that? Why would you do that? Because Louis told me where the coin is. And after that, I couldn't go on. And where is it?
Funny story... I didn't have a pan that would fit the chicken, so I borrowed one from the neighbor. - No kidding. - No kidding. - I went over and asked. - And she just lent it to me.
The other two are intact. But the line is hot and close to the bubble. PVC melts at 320 degrees. A shorted wire easily conducts that much heat. Given the thickness of the bubble, it will melt in less than ten minutes.
Insects are dangerous. Ralph, have you looked up the larva on the Internet? What are you doing? - The caterpillar! - It's escaped.
I assume he used Dr. Palmer's exo-suit. Well, then he must still have it in his lab. We'll steal it back and then we'll upgrade the ship. - And then what? - Rip, we have a plan to put reality back the way it was.
We have... a new problem. The ship is... out of order. What Sara means is that there's a radiation leak. - Radiation leak? - Yes, and it's very dangerous, so we have to keep our distance.
You don't understand anything! You're the worst mother in the world! You didn't even fix the camera. And if you hate Ruby, I hate you! Can you fix it? I know it's very old.
But is war as simple as it seems? Is it more than just a plague on humanity? War has transformed our culture and rewritten the map of the modern world. Its technologies have revolutionized medicine, transport, communication and changed the way we live and think. This is the story of how war made us who we are, how it shaped not only our world, but our destiny as a species.
If we look at prehistoric sites, we see massacres routinely. And why were there massacres? We know that humans take wealth, they take property, they take women, which is part of what those ancient societies did. They stole women and the more women they had, the greater the ability their society had to become bigger. War is a symptom of our humanity because it brings whole groups of people into a situation where their survival is at risk
They had no government classes apart from tribal government classes. And the result was a big mess. We saw anarchy and the rise of Islamic extremism. All the misfortunes of the modern Middle East can be traced back to the end of the First World War. Now we are facing this ideological struggle, which is exemplified by the radical and unfortunate interpretation of Islam and this competition is not only worldwide, it will last a long time.
I think we're facing a big risk. With cyber warfare I always think that one of the most effective ways to fight this war is to find the computer and the operator and put a bullet in both of them. Warfare in the digital domain is the latest, but by no means the final chapter in the history of warfare. Technology may change, but war always revolves around people. It is caused by our human failings, our human mistakes, our greed, the anger we feel and ends with the loss of human life.
- A show of solidarity. Next up, our third Level 2 competitor, Santiago López, from Mexico. I'm proud to be 100% Mexican. I started Olympic gymnastics at the age of three. It has defined me as a person.
That you'd never see him again. He's here because of Isaac! Let him go! I had no idea... what Reiden would do with your research... That they would take the children because of what it contained.
This is Jackson Oz. You're not Jackson Oz. No, it's not. A friend of mine created a virus that has affected all search engines. When you search for a photo of me, it's replaced by this doctored image.
It is the scaffolding on which our modern world rests. Seemingly hidden but in plain sight, our houses, buildings and cities fundamentally shape human existence. They shape our view of the world and unite us as a species. With shelter, we build order out of chaos. We dreamed, we imagined, we discovered that reality was no longer predetermined, it could be built, projected and designed.
We are in the center of the B-330. It has been designed to hold up to 6 astronauts. There are different areas for meals and exercise and all these things are very important to make the psychological experience the best it can be. This spacecraft can be changed for different missions. It can be a dormitory, a farm or even a hospital.
One of them lasted a thousand years, a recurring myth adopted by cultures around the world. The journey of the heroes. It's a story of courage and bravery, an adventure to the end of the known world. The hero changes, but the story remains the same. It was carved into clay 4000 years ago with Guilgamesh, the ancient story of a god-king's journey to the edge of the world.
The railroad is a 19th century transportation technology, but it is experiencing a major renaissance in the 21st century. High-speed railways are being built to cross the entire territory of Eurasia, in which the majority of the world's population lives. So in 10 to 15 years' time, people may be able to travel from Scotland to Singapore in just a few days. The train democratized transport all over the world, enabling masses of people to travel long distances quickly and to visit places beyond their city, town or metropolis. Another 19th century invention democratized transport in a different way, it unleashed a new kind of personal freedom, especially for women.
They are our greatest achievements in the field of construction and probably will be for a long time to come. America's vast interstate highway system connects us as a country and provides an endless outlet, but it has also transformed the way we do business. Our goods and commerce travel mostly overland, along our highways. We still call it "shipping," but it's trucks that make our economy go, until trucks are replaced by another mode of transportation and until roads become a reminder of things past... Sometimes what new technology allows us to do is go back, it allows us to catch up with an old technology that didn't work for some reason, but that you can now use and air transport can be an example of this.
- You've thrown away the instructions. - Give me the Black Decker. No. There's someone at the door. Give me back the screwdriver. It's mine.
There's someone at the door. Give me back the screwdriver. It's mine. - Will you get the instructions? - She's mine and you stole her from me.
We can admit it, right? So this time, let's stuff them into a tight stomach. Bye-bye! Womp, you've only got one poke left. Make it a good one.
No. No, I'll take care of it. What the hell took you so long? It's been a rough day. You don't call 911 to stay inside while it burns.
It looks like magic. You have to show how you did it. Of course. Lesmodation is for everyone. It solves everything.
They crush them to death first, and then slowly devour them. There are other animals that devour their prey whole. Monkfish, certain types of frogs. Maybe this snake is copying one of their tricks. Yeah, but if it can do all that, how are we going to find it?
I'm suggesting that you two know each other. You're crazy. Crazy, or am I just blind to what's right in front of me? Don't go there. When I mentioned Reddington's cleaner, you knew she was a woman.
Come on, Sarah. Before you do that, you have to go to the clinic. We're going to take a long, thin... Basically, it's like a GoPro camera in the shape of a crochet hook. It will enter through your urethra, through the hole in your penis.
Gil? I'm sorry for lying about your important opportunity and for bullying you for 40 years. George, I'm sorry I didn't do anything wrong. One day I'll forgive you. Gil Faizon, would you do me the honor of performing the last scene of this play with me, the way it was written?
He'll try to get over it. Why doesn't he stop? In theory. He's not repairing the damage. That incredible wave of power... it passes.
But yes, I'm fine. The Levitation Cloak. It came to you. It's no small feat. She's very fickle.
Thank God you're alive. I had assumed that you had been cannibalized by those savages. It's my leg. I have a nasty wound. It will be taken care of.
Are you kidding? We didn't even invite you! Get out of the lab so I can close the door! Well, you said "Let's go", so... Close the door when you leave, it'll lock itself.
That way the pee gets inside. That's not how it works. It's not a snapshot. I'm going to be the best aunt ever. I really am. I'm going to give the child everything she wants.
I absorbed it. You're welcome. I'll take you back to where you found me and... and you can "phone" home or something. Max, you're going to generate tachyon energy for the rest of your life and that's all I eat. Without it, I'd starve.
For God's sake, it's your apartment. You pay the rent. Anyway, I'm going to Manchester tomorrow. They've decided to take the exhibition on tour. - So it's a success?
Thank you. Sometimes we just need to be firm. Did you miss me? You forgot your jacket in the cabin. She exhaled your scent for a long time.
That's understood. Thank you, sir. Gentlemen, could you talk about the cement inspection situation? Proof? Was it planned? How was it done?
Can I ask you a question? Is it worth turning the house into a battlefield because of this? What should I answer to that? I'm just asking you the question. I'm not turning this into a war, Mom. She is.
In a minute, though, you can prepare it yourself. The saucers are in the basket. Where's my cup of tea? How would I know, Alice? Well, it's not here, but it must have been left somewhere.
Well, it went something like this. Twinkle, twinkle little bat. Where are you? Maybe you know the song? I've heard something like it. Well, it goes on, look.
You were bleeding on the road. I brought you to my house. Where's my gun? When you found me on the road, I had a gun. Where is it?
Technically, it's called a "closet". Closet? What is it made of, lead? Did you really see a light up here? Yes. And then it went out.
My name is Sam Chisolm, and I'm a warrant officer from Wichita, Kansas. And also a law enforcement officer from Indian Territory, Arkansas and seven other states. What happened here... was just an initial brawl. The real battle is yet to come. The idea is that when it comes, it will happen on our terms.
- Stop stiffening your hair. - A torch! Very effective for lighting a lock. A feather! Strange. It contains ink and produces music!
- Horse, sir! - He's mine! It breaks my heart, but we have to do it! No offense, Mother, but that wig is too big for a wine merchant. - It'll be under the hood.
- Why don't you eat the witch in the cart too? Because she's serving us. Your fingers are too dirty for that. That's not fair! She's a servant too!
No wonder, the staircase is eaten by woodworm. - Who broke my statue? - Citizen Rascal. Should I have him arrested? No, throw her in the garbage can, she looked like a fireman.
The world is made in France, not Austria, in musty-smelling palaces. We all risk falling to the Teutons. I'm not a coward, cousin. I choose revolution. It is the future.
There are no lamps. Dark. Of course. Damn, there's nothing! This bathroom isn't modern, it's rotten.
Me? No, it's not precise. It's rather vague. The two gaurds haven't come to their senses yet. I have a letter from Inspector Verdier and it's accurate.
Believe me, it's better not to go through that, especially here. Yes. What if I wish I wasn't killed? It's no use worrying. If a bullet hits you, it's already been fired.
Like his soul or... I don't know. Billy. Most of the time, that's how it works. Life gets completely dark, and we think we've lost all the light, but it's always there.
And being celebrated as a hero must be a heavy burden on a young man's shoulders. It makes me feel like I have no voice, sir. I understand that. But your story, Billy... You have to understand that it no longer belongs to you.
Rose, it's just... There's nothing you can say. There's no way to explain it. The guy who gave me this coin had a lot of them! I'm going to keep this coin until it stops shining.
Why do you think I have so many posters of them? Why aren't you on any of them? Someone has to take the pictures, right? Come on. I also have a ship. It dismantles itself so I can infiltrate enemy strongholds.
No. Exact model number, exactly the same probe. We should keep moving. It's completely oxidized. If the atmosphere is doing this to metal, imagine what it's doing to human tissue.
Wolves don't climb trees. I can't keep up with them, Bagheera. I tried. I just chose the wrong tree. It was a dead tree. How was I supposed to know it was dead?
He never had a head wound. But I lost my memory. Chemically induced. We gave him an injection of Benzodiazepine. Sorry, it can produce a rash.
What have you got? A letter? In your hand? Give me that letter back. It's not yours!
Don't cry just because you couldn't rent land to an oil company. Who's crying? You wouldn't take money from Terravex either. They destroyed the city. It's not like you're old enough to remember what it was like.
There are more people here now that Judd has left. Please. This church... is stronger or weaker because of each of its members, not just one person. I keep hearing about the problems the church has. About... how it can't support itself.
Deadly. Can I have him back? My husband. I don't know. Wherever that thing comes from, it takes them together.
It's a parasite. It feeds off your child's energy. But to do this, you need to keep him in a dream state. Even if his eyes are open and he's talking, your child is asleep, the entity is controlling him. In order to maintain this control, it has to convince him that the dream is real.
In order to maintain control, she has to convince him that the dream is real. You're keeping Cameron by convincing him that he's in another reality? Yes. Through suggestion. She dominates his mind and shows him what he wants most, but it's all a lie.
She dominates his mind and shows him what she wants most, but it's all a lie. I stop the lies. Once Cameron sees the truth, the entity loses its power. And what happens to the entity? It will try to jump into the nearest host.
I'll stop the lies. Once Cameron sees the truth, the entity loses its power. And what happens to the entity? It will try to jump into the nearest host. If it can't find a host, it dies.
After five years, I just, I just don't understand how, how that could be possible. That bracelet. That bracelet was new. That bracelet didn't look old. If that bracelet had been there for five years, it would have been tarnished, it would have been...
My dear magician, when I wrote your letters and recorded your videos, I knew that, one way or another, I would receive them... and I saw them. Now I know you'll never get my answers... but I'm going to try anyway... for my own good. While you were here, a galaxy of my life held together... up to a point. But now it's falling apart... and nothing's stopping it.
What, you don't believe in ghosts? And look at this part. That's where Ed was sleeping. The van is gone. It's gone. What do you mean, it's gone?
Your mother has fallen in love with Tony. For a while they're going to live in this apartment... Yeah. We've had an offer for the house. It's half what it's worth, but we'll take it.
I like it when you're optimistic, Mike. All right! Listen, Mr. Wikipedia... You can find everything in the desert. Things as old as that plaque seems to be. Who knows where it comes from and what it really says?
They're organized. They have a new boss. His name is Marius... - I've already given for this war! - She still wants you!
My father made a choice. He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion. He set a trap inside it. That's why he sent you, to bring the message. Where is it?
- You can stay if you want. I'm not authorized to use NSA programs. If you're the courier to Bucharest, it's because you can see the information, yes? Yes. So it doesn't make any difference how it's obtained.
You can alternate them around. It'll be like a whole new outfit. The chain looks good on you. Me-- It does.
Because what's wrong with Mitch? His father says he's poor and will continue to be poor if he keeps working in a declining industry. Wait here. Home. I love her.
Yes. "Uh-oh". You met your wife. I'll leave you alone. Look who she is.
What can you tell us? I don't know. I wasn't given that information. What exactly do you know? All I know are the initial projections, that everyone involved with the project was told, that it could potentially destroy entire systems.
We need to stay with them. The coalition ships are here! If they break through our lines, the weapon will be at risk. So we need to activate the weapon now. It's not ready.
Start the activation sequence. Captain, I'm detecting a buildup of energy in the center of the cloud. - The weapon? - It's possible. You said it wasn't ready!
And this is where you will watch as your entire future is destroyed. That's the only reason you're still alive. I've enlarged the sensors so much that I'll be able, with a stroke of luck, to open several windows that will allow me to scan deeper into the surface. From what I can tell, the structure is enormous. It protrudes into underground caverns.
Why didn't Daekon just destroy us and go about his business? I think I can answer that. From what I can tell, the weapon has a long reload time. It seems that the gravimetric distortions are a side effect of the weapon, and since we got here they've dropped significantly and have been slowly rising again. I don't think it can be fired like a torpedo.
I was sent to Discovery because your time period is an important front in the Temporal Cold War. I know it's a lot to take in. So, what you're saying is... This ship, the crew... It was just a task, a job? It started out as a task.
Recruits! Get in here now! Many lives are at stake, gentlemen. There's a bomb attached to the foundations of this building. If it explodes, the building will collapse, taking you with it.
The night Naz was arrested... he lost a lot. He lost his freedom... to go back to his family, to college... to the night job that helps pay for school. But what he didn't lose, nor can we lose... were his constitutional rights, to have a lawyer, to a fair and impartial trial by you... equal to him, before the law... and the presumption of his innocence... until proven guilty. We hear this phrase a lot. But what does it mean?
-You know. -Yes, it's just that... I always believed you had a dick. Right. But where was it?
I'm listening. Do you remember that memory we took from that body? - Do you? - Very good. Switch to 3D. She had an unrecorded flight path to a ship called Anubis...
You know I'm an engineer? Show me unit diagnostics and central levels. Life support. What's going on? I don't know... Ask the ship. She seems to know everything.
Miller, you bastard! It's been a long time! How's it going? So, listen, that ship you were looking for, Anubis or something, she never showed up here,
The Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan. Let us pledge allegiance here and say aloud our promise to our country again. -Our flag is raised. -Our flag is raised - And it will never fall.
Let us pledge allegiance here and say out loud our promise to our country again. -Our flag is raised. -Our flag is raised - And it will never fall. - And it will never fall.
It's great. Thank you, brother. In fact, in honor of this... and you all being here, it's time to open the Macallan. Neil... not the bottle from the auction. It's 62 years old!
There's no time for a lesson. All right then. I propose that you reflect on this quote from Rousseau: "If there were a nation of gods," "it would govern itself democratically."
I won't repeat the words, but they were not very nice. And possibly right. The clerk said that if she survives the night, they'll get her a bed. But that survival was unlikely. She's breathing steadily. But I can't get her to eat. The clerk said not to make her.
'It's the fruit of our experience 'and at its core lies the seed of all hope.' ♪ without you knowing ♪ I love the way your touch is always heavenly - ♪ But, darling, most of all I love the way you love me... - ♪ 'Accept joy, accept all that it gives.
Have you forgotten something? The bottle. No! I hit him on the head with a bottle. Did it break?
This is Farah. She's with us. Hi. Okay, we need to find the isolation unit. It's at the other end of the complex.
They've handed this case over to a man who says he'd like to see all the black people rounded up and murdered. That's genocide. That man talks like Adolf Hitler. Since they can't trust the man and they can't trust the prosecution, it's no wonder that at the crucial moment of this trial, when OJ Simpson was asked to try on the glove, the glove didn't fit. It didn't fit.
Don't turn your back on your queen, Jorah the Andalusian. I did not allow you to leave. You swore an oath to me. You swore to obey my orders until the end of your life. I command you to find the cure, wherever it may be in this world.
The Druid was allied with the Dagda Mor. How is that possible? - It means that Amberle... - We have to assume that she was deceived. Tell me, if a force were small, could it arrive undetected?
And the only way to guarantee peace is to make the prospect of war seem pointless. If you apologize once, you'll have to do it again and again and again. Like taking bricks out of the wall of your fucking house. Do you want to bring the house down, Arthur? If you go easy on a rebellion, it will grow.
Do you hear a voice? - Yes, just as Bernadette heard a voice. - And what does the voice say? "Murderer". Does it say that to you?
Father... Now there's another life to be taken. If there is a voice telling you to take a life, you must ignore it. The voice doesn't command me. The voice asks me. It says: "Pol, does that way of forgiving a murder still work if the life to be taken is that of a consecrated man?"
This bastard deserves it! I fucking know! But if you kill him now, the truce with the disgusting Londoners will be made in a thousand pieces, - okay? - Michael. Don't worry about that truce, kid, because it's broken.
Got any milk? Not a stranger in sight. It's beautiful. I've never heard the printer sound so happy. I feel like she knows.
Crying about it won't help. But that, Gary... That's your sword, which I give into your hands, and as long as you have it, you'll never need to fear any man. You are special. I choose you to wield that sword, and as long as it's in your possession, you'll never need to be afraid again.
- Pickles. - How are you? Two very nice guys. I... thank you for what you're doing, but it's really early and Lizzie's still asleep... When we're finished, you'll have a brand new ramp and she'll be the envy of all crippled children.
You're dead in two seconds. I'm glad you didn't get hit. And this one looks like a spiral staircase. I want to make a spiral staircase for you one day. Take this. It'll be made of oak.
But I don't think it's that far from the truth. Your demons are part of our reality. That's how much influence you have. I already know some of these demons. But the one that's dedicated to this war is still a stranger to me. Before this war starts, I want to know where it really began.
LESTER: If you have an idea, you can't fret about it. Mumble it like you do when you're on the train. You like it for a moment, but then you hate it. It's not good enough, but you wrote it down anyway to get it out of your head. Then you pull out your guitar, maybe it'll get bigger.
And it's all thanks to this girl. Ever since I met her, I haven't felt the urge to inject cocaine. I have my inspiration. My inspiration man. She's back!
Is that the mark Eleanor Guthrie left me with? I know it is and I know you're torn between this and what you left behind. The question is whether you can quickly hold on to the truth we feel, the truth that makes us the same. What truth is that? That a lion doesn't have a den because the savannah and all the space it occupies and all the animals that set foot there belong to it.
You are, if you believe in chance. Cause and effect. If you fire a gun. The bullet will hit something or someone. You run into the wrong guy, he wants to kill you. You defuse a bomb, you're the hero. The thing about chance is that it works both ways.
It's boring. It's very boring. You have no idea. Have you ever been swallowed by a whale? I had to wait for it to defecate on me.
Can you control the energy from here? - From the core? Yes. - One question. If I feed it, what happens to the machine? It would overload.
All with black blood, born from the dark dirt of this earth. Go ahead. I remember doing this, but I don't remember why. Don't go looking for glory. It will find you.
Put in a request for a full physical next shift. All right, beautiful, you're back in the competition. You'll wake up in three, two, one... So I ran away, crossed the glittering sea and when I finally set foot on solid ground, the first thing I heard was that voice. Do you know what it said?
It's time for the Get Down Brothers. This shit is cheesy. He's so wrong, Mylene. This song is going to liberate so many people. It speaks to planets and galaxies, who already know what we're learning down here.
So what is the name for what has no explanation? We have science and it explains everything. Does science explain a rainbow or a snowflake? It does. But does it explain how you feel when you see a rainbow or snowflakes?
And no doubt... one day, you'll see the world in more than two colors. If that's your idea of loyalty... I have mine. And I'll defend it, no matter what you and Mom say. Oh my God! This rebelliousness... where does it come from?
They may have arrested the killer. Which is obviously... brilliant. Did you notice anything unusual on the ferry? Yes, there was a weird guy, and this time he was taking pictures of a dead bird. What the hell was her name?
The end of everything. Unlike these animals, we know how fragile life can be. She looks a lot like Dagný in this picture. But it's not Dagný. Of course it's not her.
If unbridled artificial super-intelligence becomes a threat to us, it could lead to the extinction of humanity. Calm down, Professor Sadness and Melancholy. Why do you assume it will be hostile? It could be friendly. Hell, if it has any sense of human compassion, it could cure cancer, solve global warming.
SEARCHING FOR ENEMY FIGHTERS Harold, what happened? I failed. I never gave him a chance. Finch? If I hadn't damaged the machine from the start, maybe she would have stood a chance against the Samaritan.
But of course, Grace is in Italy, so... It must be a glitch. You haven't slept. Are you sure it's not you who's failing? Frankly, no. Let's run a diagnostic on the machine, see how it handles the context of some subjects.
Actually, I have to do my job. Please bear with us a little longer. The machine has a loose circuit board. John, the machine is stuck in time. It can't tell if it's past or present.
Alex Duncan, 25, single. He has a master's degree in computer science. He works for an international consulting firm, and now you too. Is that necessary? I mean, if the machine is open, why don't we just ask her why she's sending us the number?
Because, Mr. Reese, although the machine has become reliable in delivering numbers, it is still not entirely reliable in processing and delivering other information. In the case in question, it also sent me this number. What is it, some kind of program? I have no idea. Clearly, it still has some affinity for riddles.
And she will die... unknown, and unmourned. She will simply disappear without a trace. And you couldn't even give her a real voice to ask yourself if it has to end like this. I didn't give the machine a name because... I imagined that one day she might want to choose one.
That requires your voice. You don't think the machine can replicate my voice? I imagine it can. But does the machine know the password? Or more importantly, does it know what will happen if the virus is launched?
A wireless modem. Here. It comes with some impressive auspices. Why did the machine point us to something we could find on the target? Maybe because it needs something here, not out there.
It's wonderful. You can find her again. Find what? That beautiful thing you may have lost or let go of. It's out there.
In fact, I'm surprised to see you alive, Dr. Wilkes. I beg your pardon? Now, you're going to put the specimen in that bag, and you're going to give it to me. Ms. Frost, you have no idea what this thing is capable of. On the contrary, I'm the only person who knows what it's capable of.
I need to know what happened. Monty. Please, Monty. We landed in the snow. Your father said it absorbed some of the impact.
No, nothing. I saw your sister earlier, she was trying to resurrect some old gossip about Baird. Oh, I'm sure she was. That cow. She wouldn't know a piece of news even if it bit her in the ass.
- Whose law? - British law. That's right. The law only works when society believes in it. I have to go back to where it has more influence, where I'm not seen as a foreigner in my own country.
Is there enough here for that? You've seen what I have here. You've seen what I've built. Jesus said that your food situation is in critical condition. If you don't feed the people, it will fall apart.
Your focus can be very specific. - Why is that? - I think I know where you're going. There's only one person who's as desperate to know what happened to Abbie Mills as you are. She's going after Daniel Reynolds.
I found it. It will take time to digitize that old tape and listen to it. But what do you want to prove, Martin? This CD has the current ransom call. Match the voice and see if it matches my case?
- It's getting closer! I know, I know. It's going as fast as it can. - Dad, pull over! - That thing is much faster. We can't outrun it.
Yes, there is. We have to talk to my father. It won't work that way. The quantum box doesn't attract water. It attracts liquid metal, known as ferrofluid.
Well, I got rid of Davis and kept the tickets. It's up to you. That fake heart attack... inspired. The opportunity arose, and I embraced it.
Okay, girls. Let's give thanks. Bow your heads. Lord, thank you for this meal. We ask you to bless this food so that it blesses our bodies.
Is that true? No. The doctors told me it was around 500. Get out. Where is she?
You say you've been after her for years. And why do you think it's years? Because she knows what she's doing. She took Scott's boss for a reason. We don't know what it is.
You didn't. I had to. Hello, Scott. I've never seen you in that color before. It looks good on you.
You understand what they have created. - The Beast. - The Beast of Gevaudan. An engineered version of it. But it hasn't fully grown yet.
You're the critical part. I have 800 years to learn that balance. We have to help Mason right now. I need my sword. It was forged by a unique power.
We need to tell Scott the rest. Not necessarily. If there's a way to save him... The spear won't save him. It will kill him.
Corey, yes? We can add electricity. That's right. We turn the metal rod... into a magnet. Now it has power.
We can add electricity. That's right. We turn the metal rod... into a magnet. Now it has power. Now it has influence... over others.
Right. And what is N minus K? Number of attempts minus the number of successes. What's wrong with math? It helps dementia patients concentrate.
In the army cemetery. Wow. And what's your other wish? The other thing is, before I die I want a happy family photo. That I can put on my wall. She must have written Kapoor and children since 1921.
They had a very simple life and didn't frequent our social circles. But they loved their art. They put every dollar they earned into it, and they had great taste. Their collection isn't in any of their catalogs. Very few people even know it exists... but I do... because I helped them find a lot of these works.
- All right, that's enough! I'll get the weapons. Cool, I'll help, if that's what you're trying to do. Stay away from the lavalier. She's not doing anything.
- He doesn't seem to see you. - It's the cold. It can only be that. We're so cold that she doesn't see us as something alive. Why am I freezing, does she see me as a chair?
What was that? It was our Jumpship leaving. How could Per Degaton have escaped? Gideon, who else is on the ship? It's being piloted by Captain Hunter.
We should prepare an appropriation in case we have to pay for a state funeral. -Doug. -Mrs. Secretary. I could have gone to the White House. Meredith Lee - Secretary of Health and Human Services The organ network, it answers to you.
Others fill the streets with blood so they can stop the tide, the crime, the cruelty and the disrespect for human life that surrounds them. But this is Hell's Kitchen. Angel or devil, rich or poor, young or old, you live here. You didn't choose this city. It chose you.
Whoever they are, they're really persistent. Not really. We just like shiny, shiny objects, like that bracelet. Would you risk dying for a trinket? It matches my suit.
Did I squeeze too hard? How did you... What... Lucifer, what are you doing? Finally focusing my anger where it belongs.
Clearly, you must be joking. Very good. Enjoying the life I gave you? Did the food taste that good before I died? Because I don't remember it being this delicious.
That name sounds familiar. All right, then. One of the cooks said that she turned up two days ago and started shouting at Javier and Anne, so... I'll see if her file has an address. She's already in that file.
Yes, I came home so I could tell him that I was clean. And that I wanted to be a chef again. And this meal? It was the one I was going to make for him, to prove it. Well, it looks... Very good.
This is just for show. The blade retracts into the handle. That's strange. Because if it were real... it would hit even with the marks found on Rose's body.
Monogamy has failed again. So, if Tim didn't want to come out of the closet, do you know anyone who might be blackmailing him? Or threaten to tell the press? No. But Tim sent me this photo by SMS to keep. I... have no idea what it means.
And keep Lucifer out of it. Only you... Or she dies. I need the backpack we seized today. Where is it?
Take Senator Crane to headquarters now. What was that thing? A creature that leaves no survivors. We have to take her now, before it comes back. - What did it do to you?
- But... she attacked the Senator. - Make no mistake. I brought her to National City. As Martians, we don't just share metamorphosis, we also have a bond. If you assume my true form, or phase, or try to contact her mentally, she'll know.
That thing has Alex. We have to stop it. This started because that thing wanted me dead. My race is extinct. I'm the only one left. - It will have me.
I wish I could tell you what it's like. You know when a thought pops into your head and you hear your own voice? I'm not hearing my own voice anymore. It's something else. It's telling me what to do and... The worst part is that I want to do what it tells me to do.
What did you expect? Magic is real. That's the point. And if you know it, you can't... Nothing else matters. Exactly. I know it's everywhere, all around me.
Thank you. Thank you. It's her, Kate. Come on, guys. A ten and a big round of applause for the beautiful contestant from Australia. And now, speaking of occupation, I'm very worried about the next contestant. That's Barbara.
Help me, please. This is backed up by cold, hard science. India has the highest specialty flavor profile of any cuisine in the world. You don't like Indian food? I don't think she likes me.
Come on, Harry. The call will come. Pen. Remember how this works? Push the cork in, put it down and it explodes.
When you're done with the nostalgia, I need help. We shouldn't even be open. We've just been attacked by armed rednecks. I built this store. And she paid for all your privileges.
My sabbatical was... I left some very important work unfinished. The ship won't be here, Grisalho. We saw her off, remember? Yes, and in doing so she would have left...
- We won't stop. - We're going to kill him. - How? We always knew that only you or Kendra could kill Savage using items that have been exposed, as you have, to the meteorite's radiation. Now, the radiation works both ways. It gave Savage his immortality, but...
- We're going to kill him. - How? We always knew that only you or Kendra could kill Savage using items that have been exposed, as you have, to the meteorite's radiation. Now, the radiation works both ways. It gave Savage his immortality, but... It also makes him vulnerable.
I'll do whatever I want. I don't care anymore. I've met soldiers like you before. And maybe they were good men before. But when you see so much violence, it becomes the only thing you really understand.
We no longer have medical supplies. Weapons? No, the armory was completely destroyed. Listen, they must have taken some of our gunpowder. The garrison would have been destroyed twice as fast if it had all been there.
- The Ice Nation is not afraid. - But it should be. This thing doesn't care which clan we belong to. It controls people and will take over the Ice Nation, just as it took over us. One by one, until there's no one left. It's already got Ontari.
He pretended everything was fine. He tried to get me everyone who had a dick and a job. I simply stopped thinking about that part of me. And I did as I was told. I buried that story as if it had never existed.
Stop talking. I need to concentrate. Wake up, man. This city is destroyed because of you. She was normal.
All of you! Come on, everybody sing! No, sir, don't worry! Patience... And as for the question of the species barrier, between man and monkey, for example, it's very artificial, because the basis is the same.
There... It's a bubble of happiness, we slide our hands down. Let's turn around a bit with her, so we can all turn around together. Yes, let's turn with her. That's good. And now, we'll take the bubble and throw it into the air. It will move away and then come down.
We wouldn't do anything without Cisco. Loyal as a dog. We have a deal. My speed for Wally's life. Let him go and she'll be yours.
I learned to recognize students by their voices. The tapes arrived faster than I could hear them. That was all done. At that moment I realized that I would have to think about blindness. Because if I didn't understand it, it would beat me.
At least he had the courage to tell the inhabitants of the World Apart that he wanted to kill them all. You hide behind the law. I don't hide behind it, Isabelle. I just follow it. Because it prevents something quite important.
It's important that you keep resting your voice, okay? Your tracheal injury isn't completely healed, and your latest audiometry shows that the hearing in your right ear has almost completely returned. In your left ear, you have about 55%, which is good. It's only been a few weeks, so I'm not worried about it. It'll come back, Meredith, okay?
So... Don't try to get up, okay? Let them come to you. And smile. But try not to open your mouth. Because it's still a bit swollen, and the metal wires are a bit scary.
I was just in the right place at the right time. Don't be so modest. If it hadn't been for the tourniquet with the scarf, Robyn could have bled to death. Speaking of the scarf, where did it come from?
Yes, it would cut some 8,000 km off the route from Japan to London. It's something that could change things. Billions of dollars are at stake, but there's a bit of an argument about who owns the new passage. Canada says it's theirs, Greenland disagrees. So whoever owns the rights to the waterway will decide the rules of how it is used.
And I was nervous about meeting him. And he was going to kill me. Even if he didn't know you, it still wouldn't matter. The rules are in place and he believes in them. Your biology saved you, it gave him a chance to get to know you, to love you.
Between Seoul, Moscow, back to Beijing and then Shanghai, that would be a month and a half. I canceled. I wanted to bring you something. Raymond. What good is a collection if it doesn't grow?
Stick your tongue in a socket Inhale through an exhaust pipe Make toast in the bathtub Nail yourself to a cross Hold your breath until it runs out
No, it was more out of necessity than preference. Yes, it was convenient. I didn't have to pay rent. Well, I thought it was for a more romantic reason. Yes, poverty seems romantic when you look at it from the safety of your luxurious home.
- Ronnie. - All right, Ronnie. Let's have a massage. Follow me. The room is here. There she is.
That's what I'm talking about. Now, let's say you're stuck in a basement, right? And you think, "What's going to happen when the light goes out?" You're certainly going to be terrified. The light won't last, it'll go out.
I can't let you in, sorry! Just open the door! You have to open it! Don't try to open the door. It's booby-trapped!
All my guests, it was a disease. I couldn't let it spread. I locked them up... Hector and me... Until help arrived. It never came.
The world is changing, and we have to change with it. That means that our state colleges and universities should be free for all high school graduates. My education law... It's neither revolutionary nor radical. It just ends what we've been doing in this great state for more than 300 years...
They made a mistake. Our father would never do this. It's a mortal sin. Maureen, this is the 21st century. Everyone knows about depression and what it can do to you, even the Catholic Church.
I think we have to try again. Try again? Yes. With the can? Are you sure it's there?
Try again? Yes. With the can? Are you sure it's there? She's there.
Yes, sir. Yes, you did. But... but you were right. This city is in trouble. It needs help.
I can't find him on Earth. Kal-El is solving a problem off-world. Kelex, I need you to tell me about the Myriad. Warning. This machine is not authorized to discuss the Myriad. You were made to obey the members of the honorable House of El, and to preserve the memory of Krypton wherever it went.
Good, good. And I need your ship to get home. My ship. Okay. Where is she? Where is it?
I heard you kids tried to win the title, but failed. No need to be afraid, brother. I came out of that horrible, horrible cage. And I'm here to save you all. Lucifer "ex-machina". - It cannot be destroyed.
Now... This guy, Jake Townsend, had a dispute with Harold, but it wasn't about the blue pills. Jake filed a formal complaint against Harold? Yes, apparently Harold was stealing his retirement checks and cashing them for himself. When Jake died his family filed a civil complaint against Harold, but it got bounced around the courts and never went to trial.
- Trust issues. - Yes, I know. Was your mother a hunter or a witch? No. Her father was part of a secret organization. It was deactivated now.
- Take it off! - Now? - Yes. This mask cannot be worn again outside the ring. She accepted you.
Oh my God! - No! - Do you remember anything? I didn't want to. It was the mask. I tried, but it wouldn't come off.
For stability. There's more. -Clarence House... -Our house. What about it?
- Let it grow. - Let it grow. You have to let it enter you... Oh, look at the wave! I'll let it get into me on the count of three?
I beg your pardon? Are you always this unflappable, Leonard? This is a DOD (Department of Defense) contract. If Wall Street knows about even a potential complaint, the slightest downward trend in the stock price means a billion dollars, plus... If he files a complaint, it will be wrongful death.
- Where are you going, darling? - Upstairs. I wanted to try your pasta. - It's in the fridge. - Come on! Keep your mom company. She hasn't even seen you all day.
I don't know. That's a... very good question. While it's true that this seminar is aimed at couples, many of the principles covered here... such as communication, trust and teamwork, apply to all kinds of relationships, including professional relationships. So, considering that Steve and Danny have traveled all this distance, I've agreed to sign up for their therapy hours once they've completed the course. I should also say that I've talked to Steve and Danny about their partnership, and, it's fraught with some pretty serious problems.
Let them go and I'll attract people to you. You know I'm good at that. I've kept an entire nest alive for eight years. And... you can feed on me when game is scarce. And it will be scarce.
You had to do what they told you. Alex... You were ready to give up your life for us. That's kindness. And that's what's scary about a family. It gives you so much to lose.
Can you talk? No! What's wrong? Where's Janko? We were fighting over the tranquilizer gun, and we rolled around on the floor and it went off, and...
Him. That's the good thing about you, Q. You really believe in magic. - Like everyone else. - No. We know it exists, but you believe in it.
So I decided to make breakfast like an adult. And everyone saying, "Avocado toast, avocado toast," so there I was with an avocado in this hand and trying to get the pit out. You turn it on. The fucking knife slips, right? And it cuts me right here, on my middle finger, imagine, which I fucking need.
- Behind Sanchez's back! - Are you crazy? For a million reasons, the answer to that is yes, but, I trust you, you're the most incredible person I've ever met, no, that doesn't make me crazy. Do you hear my voice? See how calm it is?
- doesn't mean you can speed. - I'm not speeding. You're a child. Take it easy, okay? Enjoy the view, it's beautiful, it's green.
Your queen. Not a star. ...introduced to the people of Bermuda for the first time. The royal couple then headed to Jamaica... The last time she left for this trip, she was cruelly interrupted by the death of her father.
Never the whole truth. I grew up in a small town called Smolensk. It was almost completely destroyed during the war. In the Second World War. I was only two years old when it ended, but... but growing up there, that was...
It's your mission. - Can I go too? - I was waiting for you to ask. It seems that diplomacy has won, at least this time. There was a time when she always won.
You know endings are hard. That's fine. If you insist on being part of it, yes, I know how painful it is. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that the behavior is not good for us.
Yes, you know this is a sterile environment, right? Testosterone. - What's that? - Catherine, your diet is extremely high in Vitamin D. It's increasing your testosterone.
Draining it a little more each time. The Source's magic is so strong that it has killed everything human in it. Now there is only the Beast. So he goes to the source every night, but it's not on any map.
Hidden from the world, we Inhumans lived in peace. Until three decades ago, when the epidemic appeared. Epidemic? The epidemic slowly turns our bodies into Terragenesis crystals. It only affects Inhumans.
My husband's power is in his voice. That's why he dares not to speak. Even the slightest whisper can devastate a city. He has trained all his life to remain silent, but the antenna helps him focus his energies. If it were damaged...
But if I'm right, all we have to do is put the Seed back in the box. The box sucks all the energy out of the Seed, the crystals won't grow unchecked... No more epidemics! You've never even seen the Cosmic Seed. You don't know how it would react.
It will kill you, I think it would save Attilan, but... Do you think I can absorb the energy of the Cosmic Seed from the crystals? You heard me! The epidemic. It's gone.
Look, short and succinct... It's like the game of "hot potato". You have to keep passing it. If you don't, you die. Melissa, the curse started with you. And I think it wants to end with you.
It's not like it's something that follows a pattern. I don't even know what I'm looking for here. But we got out of there pretty quickly... - What was that? - Maybe we bought ourselves some time. We thought it was something called a transmorph, but it can't be because I filled that thing with silver and it didn't even blink.
They all want that. Hundreds of heartbroken women come to me, but they never learn. I mean, a month, a year, a little longer, they all come back to me... same story, different man. So you changed the curse? Now it doesn't just punish those who cheat, but also the foolish women who want them back.
As if all the mistakes I've made were on a loop. I know what it's like. But here's what you need to remember: Your mind tricks you. It wants you to drink again.
A hero move. That's good. I've got to go. We're looking for a way to get rid - of a mystical mark. - That's right. It links me to a crazy woman.
It hurts me to see you like this, Stefan. I mean, it really hurts. Because of our connection, I can feel what my target feels. Like when Matt pulled me out of the Arsenal. As soon as I touched my sword, I felt what it did to you.
The corpse of our prisoner was hidden even from the eyes of God. I wanted to see if the Spirits of the Salts would dissolve the whole body. They did. The Red Knights will attack again, so I will continue to need your special skills. When he threw himself against the knife and it pierced his chest, the warm blood pouring over my hand...
I know how the world works. I made a recording. I gave it to a lawyer. It's addressed to the Justice Department. It says exactly who you are.
I already have the paperwork. I... I just haven't sent it yet. Honestly, it's still hard to look at it. My grandfather loved that gun. But it worked well, so I decided to keep it in the glove compartment.
Very much. Let me establish a remote connection. I'm a genius. It's not any technology I've ever seen. But if it works with brain waves...
You have no right to appear out of nowhere and threaten my rightful inheritance. You don't deserve the title of Star Lord. Star Lord? What does Star Lord mean? There was a prophecy that a Star Lord would come and free the oppressed, but it turned out to be completely false.
They are always there, omnipotent, omnipresent. Sourdough is a mixed ecosystem of bacteria and yeasts that has been used to ferment bread for millennia. Expose wet flour to the air and stir, and you'll get a sourdough culture that transforms wheat into a very nutritious substance. Incidentally, this is precisely how the ancient Egyptians accidentally discovered how to leaven bread. When someone forgot that bowl of wheat porridge and it started bubbling, that was one of the first sourdoughs.
Of course, we won't see the bacteria, because they're too small. But we have an idea of the texture. You can see that there's a lot going on there. The lactobacilli that live in the wooden vat have the job of digesting the lactose and transforming that milk. And they turn the lactose into lactic acid. And the acid in the milk kills the E. coli. This popular recipe, with a wooden vat, was making milk safer. And, to some extent, the people of Auvergne have been practicing a kind of popular microbiology for hundreds of years, learned by trial and error. And the health inspector was convinced, backtracked on his decision and she continues to make her milk in that wooden vat.

We have an offer for you. I'd like to talk to you, Elizabeth and Paige when you get back from Ethiopia. Tim is missing. I made a recording. It says exactly who you are.
Your father and I love you and we will do everything to keep this family together. And maybe a complicated situation will become easier for all of us, including Pastor Tim and Alice. How is the recording? I don't know. But if it makes them feel good, knowing that it's in a safe somewhere, maybe it's not such a bad thing.
There you go. I'm... I'm glad it's you. Let's get to it. Dr. Warren, please be aware that the purpose of this committee is to understand the incident and make recommendations for disciplinary action, should it be necessary.
Grown men don't miss the birth of their children. Is that why you put your name on the birth certificate? To teach me a lesson? You'll get your daughter back when you behave like a father. - But she's my daughter.
Whatever it takes to deal with this issue. - Are you sure you can do this? - I have to. That language is from my past. It has no place here.
We might be able to start our lives for real. You really have a lot of faith in them. If this doesn't work... I don't want to run away anymore. The waiting, you know, it's driving me crazy.
Charmain is on her way. Let Kristin take Vickerie to get help. Do you know Karma from the wheel? It's something I learned about from Charlie. The wheel spins and spins and some days, it sends you up to the stars, and then the next, it breaks you.
And then I realized, yes, this is personal for me, and for each of us. Because the core of the United Nations is that all people, regardless of race, color or creed, deserve to live a life of peace, without tyranny or sudden violence. The challenge ahead of us is enormous. But the fight begins with words. That's why I'm here today, to ask for your solidarity and your determination to condemn this organization and everything it stands for.
-NYPD. On your knees, boys. What the hell is this? -Heroin. -Since when is heroin like this? Since it's synthetic, an opiate made to emulate the effect of heroin.
This is live television. Bring me my questions! There you are. What do you think of this tie? I want it to match your material.
Over the past decade, the partnership between the FBI and the Forensic Division of the Jeffersonian Institute has resulted in more than 250 homicide convictions, making it the most successful cooperation in history. To better understand the partnership and how it works, I was allowed to accompany the team during a murder investigation.
- My whole life is in there! We have to go now! So, this farm on Pikeview Road, that's what you said, right? Yes, yes. It belongs to Troy James.
It's your decision. I saw her arguing with a girl. Welcome back, horror fans. I wish I had a big reveal for you today, but... in my humble opinion, the suspense is underrated. The thing about the truth... Is that it's hard to pin down.
The epicenter was in New York in 1942. - That's not possible. - Wait, what's not possible? What? You said that you and the Legends discovered an aberration in 1942. What was it?
- That's not possible. - Wait, what's not possible? What? You said that you and the Legends discovered an aberration in 1942. What was it? My guess is that it involves the Nazis.
He's a pig. I found our spies. - They? - Look at their uniforms. The stitching on the lapels, it's weird.
"The quality of mercy is not imposed. "It falls like the gentle rain from heaven on the earth below. It is doubly blessed. "It blesses those who give it and those who receive it." May it bless us today in this place.
I'm the bug. So, what did Amara say about you? Dying. Yes, whatever she did to me, I can feel my spark, my light fading. And when it's gone...
Better? What about us? What about the Earth? Earth will be fine. She's got you... and Sam.
Hello, Ab. Hello. Do you still have time to see my van? Yes. How does it sound?
- Is this for real? - What was the operation in 2002? Juniper Strike. E? We only know what the secret list says, and although the list wasn't classified, the operation it refers to is.
With pleasure. Since last night all the channels have been encrypted. Don't put the drops in your eyes and wear sunglasses. It's eye flu. It's contagious.
Mitch thinks that laziness can help develop a cure. Well, if it's the sloth we're after... all we need to do is go to the rainforest in Brazil. At the speed they move, even you can catch one, "Rafiki". We need this sloth. We've confirmed that it has an advanced mutation.
For the record, she was seen preparing her own drink. Fortunately this was made from Dumpy's cell phone. Sir, the table was very small. Yes. Rajvir asked me for the bottle. She was out of reach so I poured her a drink.
I'm glad it didn't go to your head. Where did you get that? It must have been when I fell after my grandfather flooded me. That clothes-making room is really cool. Can she really make clothes from all eras?
I don't understand. I designed this suit especially for my body. Take the armor. You're making a big mistake. It could kill you!
Maybe not. But I ask you, would I rather have my son or his armor again? Your son, obviously. Armor is nothing but iron, leather and silk. It can be replaced, but the man... who wears the armor is...
That sword, what name did you say was your family name? Yamashiro. Thank you for lending me your son's armor. I'm sorry it got damaged like that in battle. So it served its purpose.
And that's why you're going to keep what I'm about to tell you a secret. Even from the rest of your team. There's a war coming, Captain Hunter. How many times are we going to hear this message from Future Barry? - Until it makes sense.
Right or wrong, this is who I am and this is what I do, so I'm just asking for a bit of space because I have to draw the line somewhere. I need to get back to a sense of normality. Please stay here. This ship is everything! What kind of propulsion system does it use?
You're not a hero to me. You're my friend. Guys... You know that ship that went over Central City? It's opening.
In short, Rip had a secret weapons room. Gray and I found it, as well as Barry's future message about the coming war. This speedster killed Rex and kidnapped our friends. We need to stop him before dawn. Yes, if this weapon does what I think it does, we'll stop him in his tracks.
Yes, well, that's all fine and dandy, but we still have to recover Capone's ledger, otherwise history is screwed. Since our last plan was a total failure, I suggest someone else do the strategic planning. All right, let's hear your brilliant idea. Well, I don't have one, but it'll be better than yours.
You're ruining everything. - Okay, Cabe's coming... - You're letting Paige escape because you're afraid of the theory of repetitive outcomes. It's an economical way of measuring behavior. It applies.
Hello, little friend. We're just trying to get around a broken power connection. That's strange. I don't see any broken connections. - Here it is.
Not until it happens. It's not like a nightmare you can only wake up from. It will happen. A premonition is like a dream in the following way: it's not literal.
I want you to come with us. - I can't. - Bring Clay... And start your own family. Save yourself from all this madness. Leave it behind before it destroys you.
Infections have a way of catching us off guard. We feel great, we think the infection is gone, and then it reappears? Out of nowhere... When your body is still weak...
- Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. - Congratulations on your new home. - Congratulations on your new home. And as soon as the infection spreads, as soon as it enters our bloodstream, we have to be very careful.
You owe it to me. It's a comic book. Graphic novel. With the operative word being "graphic". I'm trying to tell the story of Murderville, and the truth is, it gets bloody at times.
Thank you. I love you too. Is she all right? Yes, she has a strange facility for forgiveness. I don't know who she got it from.
I'll never let that happen. I have all the cards. Can't you see that? Change is coming. But it can be good for all of us.
Someone defamed Who knows, who is he? Someone unconscious Someone unknown If this is my pain then why is it ringing?
Also known as the "immortal jellyfish". Like... that lives forever? It can regenerate its cells indefinitely, so... it has the ability to return to adolescence whenever it is injured. A chicken returning to its egg. So... if we can find this jellyfish from 1895, maybe we can figure out how it caused these environmental changes and figure out how to stop them.
Jay's right, the stone is the key to everything. It's how he controlled Julian, how he created the metahumans. So if we destroy the stone, Savitar disappears. It's impossible to destroy it. It's always been there for a reason.
But I expect nothing less from the cheeky little thing. Why don't you promise her one so we can get on with it? No. And I'd appreciate it if you didn't undermine my authority. But you're being a bad mother. Abandon the child in times of need, and she won't trust you in the future.
Maybe. You're good. I know you are. Detective... There's an interesting pool of blood here. I assume it belongs to Cinderella over there. Cinderella?
I hate to spoil everything, but I have one question for you before you complete this twisted little scene. Back off. I swear I'll drop this and she'll die. God, here's halitosis. She travels, doesn't she?
No, no, no. Come on, come on. Don't do that. Guilt is such a useless emotion. It's not for such a pretty face.
- Yes, but not the Blade of Azrael. I believe that the weapon of the Angel of Death is in human hands. Let me get this straight. In human hands, Azrael's blade wants to kill? It demands to be used...
Let me get this straight. In human hands, Azrael's blade wants to kill? It demands to be used... - to fulfill its purpose. - Humans are more... malleable than we are, so it whispers in their ears, asks to be held... uses whatever reason someone has
You'll want to help, Maze. No, thank you. Let me remind you. I have a job. And let me remind you that this blade doesn't just kill humans. It also obliterates celestial beings, including demons.
I don't know what happened. I was in class and Duncan broke in. It was horrible. All that killing... And the knife was on the floor. She started calling you.
Good morning, detective. No. Heads are going to roll. First, some technician took the murder weapon without any documentation, and now it's gone.
- Since when did you turn? - Now... more than ever, I know that humanity and divinity don't mix. That... That blade, Luci. The blade was the last straw. She shouldn't be here.
I think I may have found Sam's location. It's a farmhouse. It looks empty but it was rented out two weeks ago to a woman with a British accent. - Have you looked inside? No... It's very well protected.
I'm still trying to understand how this, you know, Tinder thing works. - It's all cool. - Yeah, but, like... I could... it could be cooler, let's be honest. Because, you know, your beard, it's great.
I think that when the archbishop's priests saw that he was possessed, they tried to keep him quiet and perform an exorcism. I mean, not that it worked. Lucifer left town, but not before massacring the whole team. So we're on the right track. Where is she going now?
I mean, how do we even begin to get close to the President? Well, it helps that he's not in D.C. He's at a Midwest fundraiser. Yes, it seems that right now, his entire entourage... secret service aides, the whole circus... are at a property owned by Ron Forester, the billionaire. It's outside Indianapolis.
Thanks for your help. I'll see you later. What happened to the bank, and the house? Someone bought the house. He lived there for a while and then disappeared. It's been empty ever since.
- That's great. - So this is your place? Yes, when the situation calls for it. Thank you, Alex. Does it call for it, Alex?
- Really? I'm living in a hotel next door. I've seen where you live, Manuel, in that mansion. A huge improvement on your last home. Tell me, do you know who it belonged to?
Now, as your President, I humbly offer you... my sincere apologies. JACOB BARNES WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT. Act of contrition by the President. Since the release of this statement an hour ago, the White House in St. Louis has remained in virtual lockdown, with no comment from its staff and no further information on the President's statement. In this time of uncertainty, I will continue to pursue this story wherever it leads.
Open the door! - Open up! - Jin-Hee! Open that door! It won't budge!
Where's Kieran? Emma, put the gun down. Oh, my God! Kieran! - Where is she?
A bad movie but a good sex scene. - Should we be doing this? - We have to start somewhere. This is exactly what I thought Mrs. Lang's house looked like. Have you thought about what it would be like?
They can't be serious. Would you like me to explain it to you in simpler words? This research will lead us to a cure. When will you accept the fact that there is no cure? You found your cure once and it failed.
He went out to hunt you down. And you are? Jamie Campbell. You're the leopard girl. You had the cure, but... it failed.
The beer is stale. It's very bad. - It's sour beer. - That's right. No, it's fine. It just tastes different.
And a final thank you to our loyal listeners for your condolences. Life is short. It's random. I saw "Final Destination". Death comes for all of us and it can't be fooled.
Give us the grace of your wise voice. Please, I beg you. Yes, yes, I understand. The strength is within me. It has always been here.
You poked me. You were under Murphy's control. - The bite on your neck. - The what? I gave him a dose of the original HZN1 vaccine. It cancels out his bite and frees us from his control.
Everyone, the Reverend is back! Devyn brought a girl from outside. - She attracted a flying beast. - No, she didn't. It's possible she controls the beast. - She took a cow.
You'll feel terrible when I'm in the wheelchair. Which, by the way, would easily fit in the trunk of this award-winning van. All right, let's go to the hospital. Stop selling me the van. You're right. It will sell itself.
- I know. - Papa? - I love this city. I certainly do. Just the way it is.
Yes. Have you seen my bag? What? Why are you changing the subject? Why are you changing the subject? There it is.
Why are these twelve so special? There's a hidden layer underneath all this that I can't explain. - I'm not a patient on your couch. - But you're behaving like one. An emotionally blocked boy who can't stand her sense of powerlessness, as she reminds him of the psychological trauma inflicted on him by his catatonic mother.
When the time comes to face the unknown, there has never been more skillfully crafted armor than this. Take good care of her. It will take good care of you. I want you to stop and ask yourself What's really important to you about this mission; And if the answer to that question isn't the most important thing in your life, then I'm going to invite you to Walk out the door and follow this thing, whatever it is.
- Do you grow crops? - What do you grow? - Plants. Not really. The thing about gardening is, the prettier the plant, the more work it gives you.
See, you figured it out for yourself, you don't need anyone's help. But the hanging camera? What does that mean? Just like my future, it's hanging in the air.
- I don't mean to pry, Mac, but if Riley leaves them in the lurch, you will too, won't you? Maybe not. To be perfectly honest, I've never been a big fan of the dark. A fertile imagination like mine turned my childhood bedroom into a wasteland of TELECOMANDO monsters and unspeakable horrors from the moment the light went out. As an adult, I've made peace with the darkness with a DIGITAL MICROSCOPE because it can be a powerful ally in the field.
I don't know if I'll be able to make it. Wednesday is golf day on TV. You don't want to disappoint the children, do you? It was the children who disappointed me. Didn't you have a good childhood? The only thing I remember about my childhood is that one day it was gone.
You ran away from it, all the way to the CIA. The choices you made saved lives. And the fact that you took risks when no one else did is your greatest strength, but also the source of your greatest weakness... The doubt about whether you did what you had to, whether you could have done more, whether your friends really had to die. As long as you let that doubt creep up on you, it will control you.
Damn, that baby has more poop than a Coldplay CD. Fine, I'll change your diaper, but when you grow up, you'll return the favor. The diaper goes the other way! Earl, did the doll speak or are the voices telling me to kill it again? No, she's been yelling at me all day.
- Erotic awakening? It made me realize that I haven't really kissed Randy since we decided to have a relationship again. So tell him to come over. Maybe to stay in a hotel, because I might need your bed. If I put too much pressure on mine, it'll go back to the wall.
You're all right! I'm fine. I'm going up here. When I get to the top, I'll help you up, okay? Okay. In the meantime, a wave will come up. I need you to stand on that edge and hold your breath when it comes, okay? - Hold on tight, got it?
She was slandered by public opinion and died of cancer. Damn. She seemed so sure of herself. No one is totally self-confident. Better put the suitcase where it belongs.
Your father is here. Wow, the Fall makes you strong. No! New plan. I'll repress my Fall somewhere deep inside. If it comes back, I'll repress it again.
Why is the sky blue? The other colors already had an owner. Another one. What if all life is just a dream of a sleeping giant ass? - What if it wakes up?
You're wrong! I'm tough in a different way. I'm going to be old, even older than Weez! Older than Weez? Good luck! I knew dirt when it was still a rock.
You always get it right. I never tire of it. Let's go! I'm sorry about that. It's hard to clear your throat when it's been eaten.
Print. What's wrong with this thing? Torres, there's nothing wrong with it. Paper jams and empty cartridges are a way of life. This thing hates me. No, it doesn't hate you.
Tell Garazeb Orrelios... that we're even. Go on. - In this bathtub? Are you serious? - Hey, she can take a few shots.
Try me. The money's gone. I donated it decades ago. Charity for refugees, peace organizations. People who really needed it. I was tired of the war. But somehow she wasn't tired of me.
Just us, just you and me... but if you want to go home, you'll have to pull that big blue lever next to the seat. That will take you home. I see the lever. You're sitting next to it on the divan. That's right. She's right next to me.
you should have seen that. - It was glorious. - Yeah, yeah, okay. Just skip to the part where it all went wrong. We damaged the ship with ion mines... but it fell right into this maelstrom.
10... 9... 8... Keep going down. When you reach the fifth step, you'll enter the water. Walk towards the water. Let it cover you.
When she sees an opportunity, she has to move quickly. She can dive at over 300 km per hour. Only a peregrine falcon is faster. During the winter, even eagles rely almost entirely on carrion. It's a dead fox, and it could sustain her for days.
Earth is the only known planet where life exists. And here it is abundant.
Earth is the only known planet where life exists. And here it is abundant. The jungle is Eden. It covers less than 6% of the earth's surface but is home to half of all the earth's flora and fauna.
Some are about to hatch. There are several broods on the leaf, the ones at the top, recently laid, are barely a day old. But in the jungle, there's always someone to hunt them down. This wasp specializes in hunting frog eggs. She noticed the tadpoles wriggling on the underside of the leaf.
They're the multicolored lights of a train larva. Actually, it's not a larva at all, but an eruciform poisonous beetle. The yellow lights warn you to keep your distance. It's hunting embuás. When it finds the trail of one, it deactivates the yellow lights.
Jungles are still little explored places on Earth, and for good reason. They are complicated places to work in. Here, in the flooded forests of Brazil, the team is on the trail of a new species of river dolphin. So little is known about it that finding it is already a challenge. Their base for five weeks is a hut on the only dry stretch of land nearby, but it's already occupied.
Lions rarely attack such large prey... ...but this pack can't go any longer without feeding. The pack needs to act together to succeed. Two lionesses lead the chase. Others run to block possible escape routes. The giraffe has the speed and stamina to beat the pack... ...but she is led into a trap.
Weeks, months may pass, but the rains will return and the vegetation will reappear. Some prairies have to endure not just fire, but ice. As winter approaches, the prairies of North America begin to freeze. In summer the bison roam freely, grazing almost continuously on the abundant green grass. Now, the grass is not only dry and frozen, it will be buried.
I thought it was a work of art." A comical thing. We went to Italy and my wife studied Italian for a year, so she knew how to speak it. So I was in the gym, on a treadmill. And when I accelerated, she said: "Difficoltà."
St. Michael the Archangel, defend us - Are you happy with what you're doing, Father? Do you really want peace? You don't like war anymore, so do you have a purpose? Admit it, Ricardo. You hate your life because it's empty.
I feel something is missing. This Star Trek-inspired instrument was close to science fiction. Long life and laser sutures. And first of all, the hoverboard. Even though Grant's creation is a prototype, it is a board, it flies and it already exists.
Kris Dorr and Mike Dixon are specialists in old vinyl recordings. Well done. And to avoid building from scratch, I'm going to work with Kris. An idea I had... VINYL RECORD SPECIALIST ...was to use parts from a record dial telephone. When you dial and release the wheel, it turns backwards slowly.
What happened to him? Portugal, 2003. There was a monastery in the Bussaco forest that contained a particularly evil entity. And you got rid of it? Only after she took a chunk out of my leg.
We have the opportunity and the power, so why wait? The commander is not the political voice of this movement. I am. The priority remains protecting our people. But, as you know, the world now knows about this war. When it's over, no one will escape judgment.
What happened? Was it you? What happened to my man? What happened here? I was playing with the gun and it went off.
There's a snake. It's all right. It won't hurt you. Stay calm. It doesn't even know you're here.
Okay. Do it! Do it. It's fun. Close it.
We'll never get out of here, darling. At least a month. It depends on how widespread it is. The, uh, radiation blast isn't good, but the radioactive fallout is more worrying. When a nuclear bomb is dropped, it sucks up the dirt and debris in the air and it falls back as snow.
I never thought I'd be able to eat fresh fish again. The pond is full of them. We used to catch catfish from the stream, but obviously they've died out. But this pond comes from the same water as the well. My father says it comes from an underground pocket of water.
I'm right here. As long as you still have breath, you'll fight. Breathe... Keep breathing. When there's a storm... and you stand in front of a tree... if you look at its branches, you can swear it's going to fall.
There was nothing else to do. Was there? Yes. We all saw it. When there's a storm... and you stand in front of a tree... if you look at its branches, you can swear it's going to fall.
Once he called me life. And fire. I ignite and am consumed. There's a voice inside me that I try to push away. It says...
Marlon, I think you're the most interesting person I've ever met. Shit, I've got to go! Yes? Yes... they have... the accommodation center. They serve food at 6am and when the food runs out, it runs out, so...
The most important part is that he loved the turtle. And I thought, you know, I'm bigger than a turtle. I'm stronger than a turtle. And do you know what sound a turtle makes when you... crush it? It screams.
Once the soul was perfect and had wings... Brave. ... It could glide into the sky where only creatures with wings could go. But the soul lost its wings and fell to Earth. Then it picked up a human body.
And then we unplugged the devices and checked. Those are the readings. Wait a minute, wait a minute... Well... If you draw a line from the beginning of the San Andreas to the Hoover Dam, it practically always follows the Colorado River, which is a natural deformation event.
Chris, this mine is a fake. Your friend is clever. He tricked you. You've been watching too many movies. When you step on a mine, it blows up.
Or stupid. They say you're cowards. Better to be a coward than a dead man. You see, comrades, I believe in war. I believe it will bring good to the world.
See you later. Don't take too long, doll. You're not getting any younger. I know, I know... And here I am, applying to be one of your interns because the more I think about the idea, the more incredible it seems to me.
Yes, it's probably just the drink talking. Or not talking. My father also struggled a lot with the potion. - I never touched it. - Neither have I. But occasionally, I let her touch me.
You can clean the whole kitchen in one go! My God! 29,000! This one is very special! I haven't even told you about my favorite part... which is the head that comes off... which I can put in the washing machine, and it comes out as clean as new.
It lives and surrounds all living beings. Close your eyes. Feel it. The light... It has always been there. It will guide you.
This was the Death Star. And this Starkiller Base. So it's big. How is it possible to power such a huge weapon? It uses the power of the sun.
Of all the gifts I've received, this is my favorite. I'm going to have a short visit with my daughter before my trip home with my guards. Yes, yes, that's fine. Honor is something that all men are born with. It cannot be taken away from you, nor can it be bestowed.
You are the Great Louis Zimmerman... creator of the Emergency Medical Hologram. If I joined you, I'd ruin your career. You know that. I know that. But I don't like it. So... are we going to do a full test of the tactile responses, on my projection? Soon. I need your help with the other matrix. It's degrading faster than I can repair it.
- Nobody's perfect, Ben. - Ben: Right. Okay, so you were going through this difficult phase and then suddenly you find yourself in the middle of, well, I guess I have to call it, a surreal experience. Tell me about that. What was that like for you? Well, when you look into the eyes of death and it looks at you, that's scary, even for Brody Walker.
I believe that after death we come back to life. So why am I a doctor? Why do I work so hard to keep people alive? Because I realized that reincarnation is bullshit. We only have one life, and it has no meaning.
Gently move your attention to the base of your nose. Let the energy spread further and further out of your body until it fills the room. Move this ball of energy into the field outside. Once it's outside, let it expand. Let it float up into the sky, until it reaches the moon.
I'd rather sleep here. You're right. It's a good place to sleep. "There's a brick wall... "it unfolds... "like a blossoming flower bud...
You're right. It's a good place to sleep. "There's a brick wall... "it unfolds... "like a blossoming flower bud... "It stretches up to the sky...
"It's sinister and terrifying... "It's meant to be... "so pure and perfect... "It's meant to be... "as soft as a baby's palm... "Before it disappears... "the wall expands... "and changes shape... "We could say that it knows that when it falls, "it will offer a surprising sight."
And your farm will have priority. You'd still need Mrs. Everdene's permission. But, of course. Of course, I wouldn't dare do anything without her blessing. And... if she's going to help you make your decision,
Did you know that a maid was returning home when the bomb exploded? She forgot her gloves. If she had been two minutes late... What would that have done to your cause? Violence makes no distinctions! It hits the innocent as well as the guilty!
Who then? Come on, please. Tell me, who's calling? It's all right. This doll... does it belong to a child who died here?
Walt, we can't afford this. We can't give up now, Roy. We have to fight for what we believe in. This is just a test. I made a wish on a shooting star and look what it gave me.
Now you're going to start thinking about something exciting. Maybe you should think about the guy you lost your virginity to. - How rude. - Then you'll start to get wet. And you'll feel contractions in your vagina. You'll want to squeeze your vagina more than it wants to.
Well, there are a lot of... angry and ignorant people in the world. They seem to be breeding in unprecedented numbers. The only thing we can do, as a family, is stick together and be vigilant. The Mouth of Truth. Legend has it that those who lie often put their hand in here and it will be devoured.
It's a day of mourning. It's the day when an alien power, which has nothing to do with us, comes to steal our hard-earned money, and we do our best to stop it. It's a kind of measure of the extent to which, at least in the popular consciousness, democracy is actually working. It's not a very pleasant picture. The trends we've been describing in American society, unless they're reversed, it's going to be an extremely unpleasant society.
"Everything for myself, nothing for anyone else." A society in which the normal human emotions and instincts of compassion, solidarity and mutual support are banished. It's such an unpleasant society, I don't even care who lives in it. I don't want my children to live in it. If society depends on controlling the share of private wealth, it will reflect the values it actually does.
Do you know why? Because laughter can mean happiness. And I want the kids to always know that. Happiness doesn't exist for you. It exists for the privileged, for the beloved.
That's where we end up. Most of us. Would you like some chocolate? Childhood isn't that much fun. In fact, it's scary.
Not mine. Well, lad... looks like the old gang's back together. Let's get this ship in the air. Let's get one thing straight. I'm not the chosen one and the prophecy wasn't about me, if it was real.
Sadie, we need to talk about the find. You know, like me, it's not within the purview of Grandpa's assigned properties. Do either of you have a cell phone signal? It's the storm. No Internet until it passes.
That means we're not going anywhere! If you've caught Atka, you'll get bigger. This can change from liquid to solid form and vice versa. It can take any shape it wants. It would be better to freeze this thing before it realizes... that many of these walls aren't impermeable.
If you've caught Atka, you'll get bigger. This can change from liquid to solid form and vice versa. It can take any shape it wants. It would be better to freeze this thing before it realizes... that many of these walls aren't impermeable. How smart do you think it is?
Peter O'Toole. God. -Very thin, but charming. -Look. -The statue of Mary Tyler Moore. -There she is.
I don't think we should spend it. There's no need to worry. There was nothing in the papers. They're not looking for us, Lila. But the gun, it's still there...
You did very well. I'm proud of you, love. I need a drink. There's a bottle of vodka in the kitchen. Only I don't know how old it is.
Nina, is that you? Nina, come out, please. There's nothing there. What about the song that was playing? - What about it?
What about the song that was playing? - What about it? - It was my father's favorite. It makes perfect sense that it was playing on the record player. It played by itself.
Even so, the reality of occupying takes place within the capitalist narrative as a kind of sub-plot... This cynicism of yours... If by "cynicism" you mean not living in a dream, then kill me now. Maybe the way we... No one ever thinks a revolution will happen until three days after it does.
- It's superstitious nonsense. - Claire. If you leave a switched child in a place like this, the little ones will come back and pick it up, and return the child they picked up. They won't. It's not a swapped child. She's just sick.
Marek... More. Hello, Dagen. Necromancer, as the darkness increases... - ...it draws you to me.
I don't want a version. I want a vision. As the leader of this team, and I think I speak for everyone... - we did... - As President... who chose this team and for whom it works... I want 500 billion dollars, to put 10 million people to work.
But I'm going to solve it for you. Solve it for good. You never lie. The camera never lies either. It sees everything.
Right. Take my advice and turn it into a brand. Right. I heard your voice. It's full of emotion.
And as for your mother, she was ill most of the time. All I have is my bakery. That bakery is just your stubbornness. No, it wasn't stubbornness. But now it's become my need.
- It's beautiful. I've come to realize that the whole truth about Kitty's death will never be revealed. But maybe that's why the story continues to fascinate people. You only had to know one thing to realize how confusing the story is. It made us think about what we owe each other.
Merry Christmas, Omar. Qutab's father. Qutab's father. And suddenly the war had lost its distance. It had found us.
I was here a few days ago and found nothing personal. Hey, I'll be right there, just a bit! I've got... There's a guy over there, and... I'm not supposed to leave you here alone but, I mean, there's nothing to steal. So... if I'm not back before you leave, close the door, it'll lock itself.
- Are you Delia's mother? I'd like to see you. I'm Patsy. Patsy? Yes, of course. You're the lady she helps in the scouts. I had to call the nurse. She's having seizures, the doctors say, because of the head injury.
I'm going to have to make a lot more water. The good thing is that I know the recipe. You take hydrogen, add oxygen and burn it. I have... hundreds of liters of hydrazine in the VDM. I pass the hydrazine through an iridium catalyst and it will split into N2 and H2.
Don't touch that! Are you all right? Yes. It's just that... you got into my bubble of masculinity... or something like that. And I broke it?
They're going to collect secret information about the enemy. The data they collect could give us the advantage in an open thermonuclear conflict with the Soviet Union. Or it could prevent it from happening. In public terms, to your wife, mother, girlfriend or our Lord, your mission doesn't exist. If it doesn't exist, you don't exist.
No. I think you're ready to listen now. What should I do? Listen, you have to bring the creature back to the woods. But you have to be careful, it won't come willingly.
I think you're ready to listen now. What should I do? Listen, you have to bring the creature back to the woods. But you have to be careful, it won't come willingly. She's already tasted human pleasures.
Where's the wheelchair? Heidi, where is it? It's not here. Not here either. She can't have left.
Heidi, where is it? It's not here. Not here either. She can't have left. - Grandpa, she's not there anymore.
Not here. Not here either. She can't have left. - Grandpa, she's not there anymore. - What, she's gone?
He wouldn't do that. He's radical, but he's not crazy. Let me give you the icing on the cake. A few weeks ago, I lost my key to the laboratory. I've never lost anything, but this key disappeared from my bag, and it opens all the doors to all the rooms in the lab that contain all the dangerous chemicals and poisons.
That's not what I meant. Well... then we know her fate. - Leo. - I designed my weapon to destroy. Destroy. That's exactly what she did.
We were getting pretty desperate. And then... As if by magic... A little house in the middle of nowhere. My family never knew how special it was.
Like Judas Iscariot, he died by hanging. Judas and Pietro della Vigna are linked in Dante's Inferno. Betrayal, hanging... And so, linked since antiquity, the image is repeated in art. This is the oldest representation of the crucifixion, carved in ivory in Gaul around 400 A.D. It includes Judas' death by hanging, his face turned towards the branch that suspends him.
Very good. Can I ask you a question? Seriously, I don't want to offend you with this, but hear me out. This bag, it's real, right? Does it look real to you?
But I'm going to solve it for you. Solve it for good. You never lie. The camera never lies either. It sees everything.
Vaman Rao and Ambaji Panth are in the south. How are we going to strategically plan the attack? With our heads held high. As life does. You don't know how much it's going to hit you!
Our hands were tied by bureaucracy. In response, Pablo took his narco-terrorism to a new level, with bombings that would shake the foundations of the country. Doing his best to avoid war, Gaviria succeeded. The consequences were devastating for both sides. The problem with war is that it's not good for business.
- Thank you. Good morning, Sergeant. Escobar's prison was called La Catedral, but we nicknamed it "Club Medellín". It was the materialization of the "big lie". It was even built to look old and ugly from the outside.
But there are kangaroos near the house. Kangaroos! Yes, the house is near a conservation area. Your father went to the best local school. It has the best soccer team and the best dormitories.
Where did the werewolf go? Sequere lupus. Let's go to the left. Can't this truck go any faster? She can, but I can't.
Just the blues and yellows. Tell me how I'm going to feel. Change begins in the extremities. Hands, feet. On a physical level... But it starts before that.
Paige, I'm afraid of rats. They're smart, alert, intuitive... I'll pick another card. No, Savannah... It's already been chosen.
- Right. Very good. Do you realize how selfish you're being, Doris? You can't keep the house to yourself. It belongs to all of us.
How's the water? Good. Most of it we have to reuse... before throwing it away. So... this is recycled urine. Am I drinking my own urine? Anyway, we can't tell if it's yours specifically.
No, sir. I believe it's Hitler's newest crazy weapon. Basically, it's a 90m barrel with 34 pairs of tubes. It seems to have short legs, which is why they call it a myriapod. What does it do, sir?
Get the information... and get out of there. Yes, sir. It looks like Hitler is going to build a superweapon. The division wants us to find it. What does it do, sir?
Yes, sir. It looks like Hitler is going to build a superweapon. The division wants us to find it. What does she do, sir? She calls me a myriapod. It's a pressurized cannon that sends artillery 100 miles away.
Division wants us to find her. What does she do, sir? She calls me a myriapod. It's a pressurized cannon that sends artillery 100 miles away. The division believes it has located the weapon. - Where is it?
The way the light hits things, I mean. There's so much I don't remember. It's the result of the accident that brought you here. It robbed you of your memory. Will it come back?
- No. It could have been some children playing. - And no phone booth? - Rarely used. It wasn't dismantled because the area has no mobile network coverage.
Your brother's last recording. You... gave it to Winning? Dad, I'm so sorry. I never thought about it. How did you know where she was?
Train. Let's go. Don't try to teach me what's right or wrong! Life always goes on. She stumbles and then gets up.
I don't understand how you knew about my birthmark. This is a perverse thing, Warren. A writer doesn't look for inspiration. Inspiration appears. And when inspiration puts on a uniform that fits well in the right places, she writes...
Anyone? - Please. - What happened? The shovel fell into the water and then... We tried to pick it up. And then it was recovered...
He just needs to adapt. He's at an age where he's starting to understand more... He can express himself more. I don't know... Did you hear that my boys made a deal with the locals? They bought a goat and named it Richard. Where is he?
This house is under new management, and that means you're out! And one more thing. I'm tired of you stealing my joy, but that's changing too. My joy doesn't come from my friends. It doesn't come from my job.
See you tomorrow. - Hello, there. - We found out what caused the explosion. The main gas supply line exploded. So we're looking for a dangerous fugitive on the FBI's most wanted list, and as soon as we enter his house, it explodes?
I can't seem to get these scissors. Can you? Damn. I've got something in my eye and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help me? Penny? I want to eat this banana, but it's stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.
Howard, what do you think? Well, I think that as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to turn ideas into reality. Well said, my dear friend. I thought eloquence was dead and here it is before us.
Thanks for pissing on my slippers. It's the tiger's eye It's the bat's ear It's the catfish's whiskers And the walrus... Wait a minute. Not that your music is terrible... it is...
- It wasn't me. - It doesn't matter. Once the police like a suspect, it becomes a question of proving that that person, in this case you, did it. They won't go off course unless they have strong reason to suspect someone else. And if they find the murder weapon, and it's yours, you're screwed.
- They were made for each other. - Really. Guys, we have a little problem. - We missed it. The storm. - Or it got away from us.
But we all share the same meal. You used the same bowl as Emilie and had similar dreams. It may be a coincidence, but we'll find out. Where is the Ambassador's carriage? Rochefort ordered it to wait here.
But for all our collective fears of the unknown demons lurking out there in the daylight, perhaps our greatest fear is recognizing the potential darkness that exists in our own hearts. Our own sins. We are afraid to see them, afraid to touch them, afraid that they will consume us. Or maybe... maybe we're afraid that if we see the darkness, it will also see us.
We've seen patients from all over the country and even some from Europe. Lucky for you that hunting the desperate is so lucrative. Everett, I don't want you to insult our guest. It's all right, Eleanor. A man is entitled to his opinion, however uninformed it may be.
- Nothing. There's nothing. - It's right there. The camera doesn't capture wind or temperature change. It doesn't activate unless something passes - through the three sensor beams.
The orders came from the King. The village was to be barricaded to prevent the infection from spreading. Anyone who tried to escape was shot dead. Villages with plague had to be isolated... to save other lives. They should have left us food, but it never came.
So you think I should help him? If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, does it still make a noise? Yes. The same argument can be made about the truth. It exists, regardless of the perception of a witness.
I went... to visit... a friend of his, a boy studying to be a priest. He kept saying he didn't know about Walt. I just wanted to tell him to stop it. You know, maybe you don't want to make that layer thicker. You know, without more paint, it'll run and spread.
- You grimaced. - I have a bad elbow. - It was your shoulder. The pain radiates. She does that.
The drains... Are they all functional? Can they carry a large amount of liquid waste? This was a soap and cleaning materials factory, so I imagine so. What if we want significant modifications to the property? It's zoned IR4, which means you can do almost anything here, except build a baseball stadium and compete with the Yankees.
What? Shit happens. But you're forgiven. That's what the plant is trying to say. She wants to help you, James.
Shit happens. But you're forgiven. That's what the plant is trying to say. She wants to help you, James. She does.
These questions... of good and evil, however important they may be, have no place in court. Only the facts matter. My client says it was self-defense. Mr. Prohaszka's associates refused to give a statement about the incident. The only other witness, a frightened young woman, said that my client was pleasant and friendly, and that she only saw the fight with Mr. Prohaszka after it had started.
It's so good to see you. How are you? How's school? You haven't got my bracelet. You know what, I had to wear it. It helped me save a lot of people today.
She's intelligent, manipulative, and if she really wants to protect the people of this country, she'll have that rock blown up. With all due respect, Captain Bennigan has been through a lot, but we mustn't allow ourselves to be ruled by fear. No, if this "thing" wants the rock, well, that gives us an advantage... a bargaining chip. But until we use that bargaining chip, we can study it and get to know it, and who knows what it might show us?
I smell an infection. Have you been cleaning it regularly? Yes, but with this liver transplant last year and the anti-rejection drugs, the healing has been unstable. I can see that. How did you get shot? He was cleaning the gun and it went off.
You haven't answered my question. I asked if you believe in the cross of Christ. I do. Look, the cross is bloodstained, painful. It loves, forgives and demands.
I asked if you believe in the cross of Christ. I do. Look, the cross is bloodstained, painful. It loves, forgives and demands. But what does it demand?
Ready for this? Come on, baby. I want to ask you a question that was put to me last night. A simple question, but one that shook my foundations. It affected me so deeply, so profoundly, that it could only have come from the Holy Spirit.
Just keep serving, love. Would you like some macaroni and cheese? Nothing for me, thanks. It's because of the lactose. She doesn't get it.
I love being a Marine. What's happened? Things have changed. Or did you get tired of being a hero? You know, the funny thing about war is that it shows you who you are, not who you want to be.
Women always end up knowing who we are. Well, let's go. A letter arrived for you. Héléne put it aside. Here it is.
I hope the house is always sparkling. From the floor to the chandeliers. Would you like me to go upstairs? How? I don't care how the sausage is made, but it is made. Do I have to make sausages?
I heard him swearing at the console. - When I was a child, my mother used to wash my mouth out with soap. Here's a bar of handmade lemon verbena soap. I want him to learn a lesson, but he has to have the best. If you want Deion to learn a lesson, it has to come from you.
There's a delivery coming, okay? I want them to deal with it straight away. Get things done, but I want you here, to be my eyes and ears. Sorry to interrupt, but the package is here. Here? Why is it here?
"I'm sorry, girls. You're all important to the team. But they can't all be starters." And instead of getting rid of something, what do we do? We try to put everything back in the suitcase, but slowly. Thinking that if we act with intention, we'll fool the suitcase and it won't realize it's full.
I think it could be good for you. You're a risk for me, Fiona. You don't have the courage. How did you get shot? He was cleaning the gun, and it went off.
Does your wife know how intimately you and Hannibal know each other? She knows enough. You couldn't save Hannibal. Do you think you can save this other one? Your experience alongside Hannibal is deeply damaging... Yet it's so irresistible. It weakens your ability to think rationally.
Increasing to the maximum, Gideon. Increasing to maximum, Doctor. Acceleration force absorption at 35% and increasing. I'm not stabilizing, I can't control my speed. It comes and goes, I can't control it.
- I know and I was wrong. We have a photograph of the blonde who was with Spider before he was killed. But it's not a clear picture of her face. What did the lab technicians say about your magic typewriter? They claim it receives and sends signals.
I don't know. I create them as needed. I understand your position. You need to understand mine! He questions the validity of our position. I say it's crap.
A year after being elected, he packed his bags and moved into a real house. A real house? Just like the one we're going to buy. This town? It's everything.
Really? Just like the one we're going to buy. This city? It's everything. It's right there.
He's been among us for some time. You've never heard his name. You've never seen his face. He has remained in the shadows. Because men like him, who want to control our city, our lives, fear the light and what it will reveal.
That wasn't very Catholic of you. Yeah. To my defense, in the scriptures, the Hebrew word "Satan" actually means "adversary". It is applied to any antagonist.
One of them must have been sold that day. That's what I thought, but... look. Look at the balance sheet after the property disappeared from the list. It hasn't changed. If it was sold, wouldn't that be reflected in the balance sheet?
I repeat, 15 minutes to... You were right... about what you told me on the radio the other night. Not everyone deserves a happy ending. Do you? I wanted to make this town... into something better than it was.
You can try. Let's go! Let's go! This city doesn't deserve a better future. It deserves to drown... in its filth!
Let's go! Let's go! This city doesn't deserve a better future. It deserves to drown... in its filth! It deserves people like my father!
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything. Violent crimes involving normal people.
More than courage, we need a strategy. A little help, please. EVALUATING STRATEGIES... What a great time for your machine not to work, Harold. Give her a second. She's got a lot on her mind.
We need a strategy. A little help, please. What a great time for your machine not to work, Harold. Give her a second. She's got a lot on her mind.
I'm afraid you don't understand. - We need a strategy. - A little help, please. Good time for your machine not to work. Give her a second. She's got a lot on her mind.
- We need a strategy. - A little help, please. Good time for your machine not to work, Harold. Give her a second. She's got a lot on her mind.
Its soldiers killed more than a dozen Palestinians in attacks on homes. - Do you expect us not to fight back? - We need to stop the violence. If it continues, the peacekeeping mission will fall apart. And it is our best hope for long-term stability.
I lied. Why did you lie? Are you ashamed? The first time I did that, I was scared to death. I knocked on the door, it opened... the guy was wearing a satin robe.
- The core is gone. - It can't be fixed. There's only one place we can find another. If you leave now, I'll be there in the morning. If there's any resistance, it will come from the head of security. - My father.
The virus isn't finished with us yet, Mr. Cole. It will mutate again and again until there is no immune left standing. There's only one way to stop it. And you... you're the key. I want to send you back to stop the plague before it happens.
- The accelerator... The last time this happened you caused an explosion that injured many people. This time, the accelerator will operate exactly as designed. Only, instead of two particles moving in opposite directions, colliding at the speed of light in the inner ring, we're only going to inject one particle into the accelerator. And it will collide with me.
A little afternoon stimulant. Sit down. The pie smells good. You won the blue ribbon. There's nothing like it outside Tendale, Washington.
ONE YEAR AGO Hello, everyone. It's Piper Shaw, with a special Halloween podcast of "Autopsy of a Crime". While searching for a link between the past and present murders in Lakewood, I had to wonder about Brandon's mask. After all, it had disappeared from the evidence room last year, but the fact had never been reported.
If I were Sheriff Hudson, I would check the whereabouts of the main suspect at the time the mask went missing. But even so, what is Seth Branson's, or rather Seth Palmer's, connection to Brandon James? Why become the monster behind the mask? We found this knife in your classroom. Any idea how it got there?
Why become the monster behind the mask? We found this knife in your classroom. Any idea how it got there? No. It has traces of Will Belmont's blood on it.
If you're interested, I'll talk to you later. They're holding the light. - Amen. - Look at it! Take that light into your life - and it will help you change. - Hallelujah.
Listen, you've got me. I understand that. But please be careful with my research. It's important. It needs to be published.
Remember? Would you like some more pork? And when he left Rome, the page disappeared. I don't think it was a coincidence. Why are you looking for that page? Because some believe it holds great power.
A ruler of murderers and rapists, is that what you're suggesting? To shrink like you behind these pagans? Who execute pious men and bathe in the blood of innocent children? These savages are just a tool we use. A blade to cut, a scythe to slaughter. When a tool outlives its usefulness, it is discarded.
They're calling her the Holy Maiden. It says that Henry won't reign for a year if he marries Anne. And there's a new star next to the moon, and... It's not a star. It's a comet. And the last time it appeared was under King John, the cattle stopped breeding, the grass stopped growing, and the birds fell from the sky.
Is that what they did when I was cured? Maybe. Maybe they think you have potential. I saw on TV that science is dying. I don't want it to die.
I would like to know if there is any information or assets relating to my parents. What's your name? Weinraub. Abraham Weinraub. And while it's true that no atonement can change the past, it does have the power to heal us. To restore relationships and connections that we thought were lost forever.
What if Miranda... went back there? To that house? - If her conscience... - No, Adam. If she's back? We have to go back and get her.
It's not like you're wearing them, is it, boss? - Again. - What again? Another sign of dark matter. It interferes with the lighting.
Because there is a way. We are not gathered here tonight because of the names of our teams or our schools, but because of the name above all names. Jesus. Jesus. A person alone in the darkness, willing to tell the truth when it's not popular. A person willing to tell the truth when it's not safe.
Grant said he wanted to restore the painting, but... he couldn't separate the frame from the back. - What else did Grant say? - He said... that the painting spoke to him. That he heard a voice. And it wanted blood.
I think a little more carrot than stick might be better. Or not. It's almost time, Phoebe. I've never done so much darkness before. It will have to cover the whole convention.
Humanity has given way to the Evos ever since. Evos are humanity, Erica. That's the reason for this Convention, isn't it? To remind us that evolved humans are still humans. Evolution is great when it's controlled.
Unfortunately, he doesn't include you. You have to admit... It's nice to see him so happy. I've never done so much darkness before. You'd better figure out how to do it because it has to cover the whole convention. - Where's Dennis?
Maybe there's a way to take Erica out of the equation. This is about fate. You don't mess with that. We at Renautas have done a lot to build this union. And like many others, we ignored the Evos who radically opposed this union. But now, the truth has come out, indicating that this tragedy was caused by those whom it was meant to benefit.
- Can you read it? - I haven't even seen it. - What are your plans for her? - My plans? I don't know what she does.
- It's about a murder. Constance Burrows filed a formal complaint against you. - I'm sure she wasn't very happy. - Constance Burrows is a faggot. What does she have to do with the girl who died?
We need water to start a potential nuclear reaction. Pure water absorbs a lot of neutrons. So I'll get some heavy water. Come with me. The problem is that we need a lot of it, and it's only produced in Norway.
Listen, I can't thank you enough for your help in this. Really, Harry, really, if it hadn't been for you, I don't know how we would have solved it. I appreciate you saying that. You know, all this modern technology really isn't my style. You can get all the modern technology you want, it will never replace visceral instinct and good old-fashioned police work.
Goodbye. Krumitz, I'm sending you a photo. I need you to get the GPS coordinates from the metadata. Avery, the photo Zoey Tan sent her father was taken in Rock Creek Park. According to the GPS coordinates of the photo Zoey sent her father, it was taken here in Rock Creek, in this specific area.
Alan Fitch didn't think so. Whether he is or not is an academic question. He must be eliminated. This prison of yours, The Factory, I assume that the American people are unaware of its existence. Perhaps they wouldn't notice if it disappeared.
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything.
So what? Nothing. That doesn't mean we were wrong. I didn't come here to abandon the list. I came because I think it's incomplete.
I've been looking forward to this. - How are you? - Fine, and you? Sorry I'm late. Did you get my message? Yes, she was more considerate than you since she arrived at 6 p.m., when she should have.
Our legacy... And you lost it. I'm sorry. What can I do? What can I do? There's nothing you can do. Our door was only open to you again because of that child and now she's gone.
It depends. Sometimes plays are made to make you laugh, sometimes they're made to make you cry. All plays are different. This play, then. How did it make you feel before you were expelled?
I'm too friendly. ANTI-GANG Are you shy? Yes, shy. Let go of your belly, it'll hold itself together!
When has that ever stopped us? We can't risk it. Can't or won't? Ezra, there's a bigger mission that you're not seeing. It can't be jeopardized because of one soldier.
I don't like that. We're fighting a bigger fight, but it's still the right fight. I've survived one war. I'm not ready for another. - I saw what she did...
Got it. Well, what about me and him? You have the best job of all! When the line swings, charge it with electropoles. Hit the line with the rod, and it will send a bolt of energy to Joopa.
Phil, you know. I have a lot of grass in the yard. I'd be happy for you to leave it there, if you like. Nice try, Todd. No. I found her and she's staying here.
You can't say anything that I would use against you. But what you don't seem to realize, doctor... is that your fate is already sealed. You have no chance of going back to the way things were. You have no chance of guiding assassins from the comfort of your mansion. The truth is about to come out, and the world will see him as the pathetic psychopath he really is. The truth is a tricky thing, Agent Hardy. You think it's a gun you can point at me, but it could end up blowing up in your face.
Yes, we had a few incidents, but the military sent massive resources. They shut down the city. Nothing compared to New York. That's because they acted immediately. That's one of the problems in fighting this disease, it fights back.
The place is safe, as long as... Nobody does anything stupid like open the door. That creature manipulated you. It's not your fault. She has her mother's memories, so it's easy to pretend.
I compared his blood with Bertrise's. Natural immunity, as you can see, is a little more common than I had thought. Somewhere between 1% and 5% of the global population. That's how they conquered Europe. Now, their mission is to destroy the cure wherever it exists, in a nuclear-powered submarine that never runs out of fuel.
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything. Violent crimes involving normal people.
Please lie on your stomach. There you go. Well done. You are attracted to the darkness of others, but at the same time you fear it. You fear that it will devour you, that it will erase the image you have so carefully cultivated, that it will reveal you as an imposter, but, Noah, until you allow yourself to experience your basic desires, you will never be able to hear your true voice.
So... - Laura, take my seat. - No! All right. Keep going. You took someone's life! You talk about life as if it couldn't be produced.
But he left it in my hands. What did you do? I put him to sleep. I treated her leg. It was very difficult, but a week later she was able to walk again.
What about you? Actually, I'm with someone right now. Your dog. Wait, is it that cute brunette who showed up there with you a few years ago, the policewoman? Actually, it's her.
Am I your mother? In the future, I mean. Don't catch a cold. That's what mothers say. But you don't actually catch a cold, it catches you, doesn't it?
Those men are loyal to me, and they will turn against Zorin and his team at my command. All right, then. It seems feasible. So, with my help, you and Alec enter the building and, together with my security, neutralize the soldiers. Alec works his magic and abracadabra, Kiera disappears. As soon as you leave, I'll destroy the machine and stop the invasion before it starts. And then what?
It's a good idea. Examine the tablecloth for touch DNA. I was also thinking, since Harlow dealt with illicit objects, it might make sense to find out more about the product. The knife. You know, it might bring us closer to some of his shadier associates.
If we're right, this is big. Yes. It's working in the same way as yeast fermentation enzymes in the brewery. Did you ever think that your beer could save the world? It was good.
Well, 230 years after Newton, a German patent clerk in Switzerland finally realized that scientists had always been asking the wrong question. They would never find an object in the whole vastness of the Universe called gravity, because, in fact, gravity is nothing more than the shape of space. This official, Einstein... concluded that the apple doesn't fall to the ground because the Earth exerts some mysterious force on it. The apple falls because it follows the lines and grooves that gravity has carved out in space.
Killian is here. Who's Killian? Me? Well, I haven't seen that cursed blade since you sent Crocodile away. But you took it last night to hide it somewhere no one could find it.
How do you know about Robin Hood? Just because the boy doesn't remember being me doesn't mean I don't remember being the boy. Well, you're right. Robin found it. But this page... it shows something that didn't happen.
- You're clever. You'll find out. I don't want to find out, I want to know. Analyze that sentence, Spencer. It's very revealing. It's an ice cream machine. - That's right, that's what it is.
It's about everything. Everything you've shown. You don't have the profile. It was my fault. I chose the song. It doesn't show what Hanna can really do.
- Yes, I'm up here. What happened? Are you all right? Yes. I was on top of that thing and it broke.
Time's up. What's next? Your radiotherapy. The radiotherapy hasn't worked yet. I don't see why out of the blue it would start working...
You know, I wanted to check the attic. Is that the rope near the bathroom? Yes. Use both hands. She'll grab it.
We've learned to coexist. What did he do to you? What did he show you? - Their story. - What's in it?
That's the idea. You know this is going to hurt. Well, I've got a wife, a kid, and a huge mortgage waiting for me. Do what you have to do, Dean-o. The last time you saw this thing, did it also turn people into murderers?
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything. Violent crimes involving normal people.
- But what about the jobs? Just a little more time, buddy. You have to get bigger. The leaves turn yellow, the water is poisoned and nature dies. If we don't get you out, maybe it won't recover.
Don't cry, Marianne, for a love that has passed or for the world born before we began, for the walls they built to keep secrets that won't last. They won't silence our voices, Marianne. And in every shattered part of a defeated man's soul, there is a piece that holds an unfulfilled hope. Seize it now, freedom! It will guide our way home, through the darkest night in the sky, a light will shine.
Yes, thank you, Dr. Clarkson. That's fascinating. What about the Stig? Oh, he's on public transport, like before, yes. - What about you? - Well, as you know, last time I used a speedboat to cross London, but in the end, it couldn't go ashore, so I had to run, which cost me the race.
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you at all hours every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything.
- Okay, crazy. Leave it to me. - What did he do? - He attacked me with a knife. - It's over there. - I've got it.
Do you know why it's hard to prove arson? Why don't you tell us? Because the fire consumes itself. By destroying all the evidence. As if you had a gun... used in a murder and then it self-destructed.
She should have been on the bus that day. She should have been, but she wasn't. Instead, she lost her sister, the closest person to her in the whole world. And then life forces you to go on living. That's how it works.
Jim Gordon escaped that carnage unscathed. - You get top marks. - Thank you, sir. Did you know that my family built this town? We worked the bedrock on which it stands, but there isn't a single bridge, alley or ditch with our name on it.
No! Terry's still not answering his phone. Why am I the only one who cares about this baby? - What took you so long? Is she all right? - I was telling you the story about the duck. Now that it finally has a satisfactory ending.
I don't know how to pay you back. Freedom will come to every black person in America. It will take time, but one day the Declaration of Independence will live up to its essence. Our new nation will be called the United States of America. What's so united about it?
I'm sorry, White Mama. You're not allowed to call me that. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I have a question. And it's only hypothetical.
- and you still helped with the body? - Look, it's more complicated than that. I joined the sisterhood to feel closer to my mother. You know? I heard what my dad said about her... that she was kind, a fighter and had a huge heart. There's no way she was Kappa the way she is today.
I joined the sisterhood to feel closer to my mother. You know? I heard what my father said about her... that she was kind, a fighter and had a huge heart. There's no way she was Kappa the way she is today. Chanel and her kind destroyed her, turned her into the monster she is today. But she can go back to the way she was.
I'm watching you. You really are crazy. I'm watching you! You were right about the salad, you know? It regulates the colon, and it doesn't fill you up as much as when you go out for dinner.
- I'm not lying. My vagina doesn't have teeth. Can I rephrase the question? Does your vagina still have teeth? - No! The answer is no! - "No, it no longer has teeth"
I'm sorry, I just don't understand why you called us here. I know Detective Chisolm. He's a good man, but he's lazy. He thinks this case is solved, but it's not. And I know you two are playing investigative reporter, and if I give you an acorn, you won't rest until it turns into a giant tree.
crazy and creative killer on campus at the same time are quite tenuous. I didn't run the numbers but it has to be, right? Yes. And thanks to you two, order has not only been restored... It's also been improved!
Anyway, I walked back to Candle Junction at Three Hills Mall, and the girl was like, 'I'm sorry. "We had the Ms. Claus Cinnamon eye pencil in the back. "It was just hidden by other things" "because it's the seasonal sales". Seasonal? The first thing you'll notice about this candle, like "Rita Moreno's Daiquiri Hangover", is that it has a sturdy wick.
A lot of my so-called friends have been killed and nobody asks me about it. That's enough for me. I'm out, guys. And I'm starting a new family tradition. It involves me never coming to any of the family gatherings again.
The hard slab of cold steel controlled the swelling in my spine. When I regained consciousness, I felt better than ever. Really, I should be thanking you right now. That fall? It may have cured me of my scoliosis.
I never saw any body there. I'd actually noticed that you'd lost weight. You look good. Paleo diet. It works
Even your old man never shot at such fair intervals. Yes, well... paper targets don't shoot back. Spoken like a true Turner. Come on, boy, you've got a letter to open. Whatever it says, I expect you to stay here until your work is done.
Before leaving the Consulate, he asked me to check this. He wanted me to see this key he found. He thought it might have something to do with Emma Wilson's case. Yes, and? It turns out that it fits into a safe at the Tel Aviv Credit Union on Hillel Street.
No. You said you had one. What's that? Yes, that's right. We all jump at the same time to unlock this thing, and it falls down to the basement, and we jump onto the giant spring at the bottom of the elevator shaft, and then we're safe.
Hello! I want you to see how you're acting like a lunatic. I came to talk to you about something important and you decide to chase me with a camera! I asked you to clean the kitchen 9 hours ago when I went to work. I come back and it's in exactly the same mess and with even more pickles and peanut butter!
So, listen... I know you've seen things in this war that you can't explain. General Washington trusts you. He told you that this revolution is not just a war about the future of this country. It will determine the fate of every man, woman and child.
Okay, what about this? An Asgardian rune stone. I'm trying to recreate Thor's powers. You turn this over and... According to my calculations, she should do something like this...
Yes, but where does it come from? Let's amplify. Do the lights appear in all the videos? In most, but not all. It moves from the right to the left of the screen.
- You're disgusting. - Not for Alvin. I was his last meal. Then he must have died of poisoning. When his soul left his body, it immigrated to my precious one.
Have fun missing a week of school without me. I'm going to bring you a very nice present. How about a trip to Europe? That's a good present. Well, I know that the next time our parents do business abroad and get an extra free ticket, it'll go to you.
Jobs was talking about becoming a monk at a Zen temple where Kobun Chino had studied. I wonder what attracted him to it. Was it the monks' discipline? Their unwavering concentration? When he meditated, Jobs loved to inspect his own mind and change the way it worked.
He explained that he had feelings for me, but not like that. Did he love someone else? Yes. His art. She was everything to him.
You fear that I'll recover the potions and spells and become more powerful than you. Poor Rowena. Always the victim of conspiracies. You're so consumed by the thirst for power that you can't see the truth! I see the truth and it's pathetic.
- Why? Why aren't you in position? Because there's a problem with your tranquilizer gun. What problem? It goes off by itself.
Thor's hammer, in theory. No. That would sink half of New York into the sea. If it breathes, can't we kill it? Heat and cold are in balance, but if we throw enough heat into the storm, it will shatter.
Flynn! Cal, come on! "Of the wonders I've heard, the strangest thing is for men to be afraid even though they know that death, a necessary end, will come when it must." It's about rejecting the power of death. It has no power over me.
And he had a gun that he said he'd taken from his teacher and I told him to forget it. To go home! She took the bait. I like it. Carrie's a minute away. And suddenly we were arguing about the gun and it went off.
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything.
I can't. Next time. "I pressed F3. The machine was broken. She gave me a payday.
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything.
Sorry, John. Places to go, people to kill. Damn it, Root. This was the work of an artificial intelligence! What's it doing?
Damn it, Root. This was the work of an artificial intelligence! What does it do? Who designed it? Does it see the future?
- Tell us now! - All right, then. It's really scary, then don't say I didn't warn you. It better be good. Well... it takes place in a camp very similar to this one, where behind the woods there was a dark lake and beyond that lake, there was a prison.
Were you threatening a man about to die? Haven't I suffered enough? Get out. I can't leave this chamber. It sustains me.
Out! All units down the river. I repeat. All units down the river. He can't cross the bridge, it's broken.
Reference to drugs! - Seriously, what am I here for? - Didn't anyone tell you? They send a limousine, and I get in. It takes me somewhere.
Without any purpose. He left damp patches on the floor. Until she found her purpose. Cara liked to terrorize the guests. She liked the pool, until it was drained.
Was there a night when you remembered them? My father found me on the floor, lying next to the chair. - And the skylight? - That's the point. It wouldn't open.
I can't see who he is or who he was. Where are you taking him? A clearing. There's a huge tree in the middle. You'd think it was a thousand years old.
Where are you taking him? A clearing. There's a huge tree in the middle. You'd think it was a thousand years old. But it's been cut down.
Don't interrupt me. I'm filing and then I'm leaving. You're really working on that file. It'll be the first night in two weeks that I've left before midnight. When you don't keep up with the paperwork, it piles up and you're stuck late.
For now. Doctor? Doctor, are you all right? Listen, the ship, it's a funeral ship.
Did you find Mrs. Ciner attractive? If you're asking me if she was an attractive woman in general, I'd say she looked like a middle-aged woman with no breasts. She wouldn't have been my type. In fact, she was described as a kind of ugly deaf-mute woman [laughs].
But when you think about it, 30,000 isn't much. Not when you consider the alternatives. Dr. Brennan, this injury to the left temporal bone is unlike anything I've ever seen. Angela's already run the fracture pattern through the computer. It doesn't match any known blunt weapons.
Come here. You have to remember. It's the disease. Remember what dementia does? It causes hallucinations.
You have to remember. It's the disease. Remember what dementia does? It causes hallucinations. It makes you believe that people are out to get you...
The body is gone. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was trying to help. Liam said that pain... He said it would make you human.
Something changed. And I think it's because of me. And I don't know how to fix it. My asthma is back. I'm not sure how, but it's back.
If you think about it for a second, Liam, you'll know I'm right. I am thinking! I'm thinking of alternatives. Liam, it's the supermoon. It feeds your anger.
I'm thinking of alternatives. Liam, it's the supermoon. It feeds your anger. It makes you more aggressive. It makes me stronger!
Again. I've been doing this for an hour. - It doesn't work. - Because you're in a hurry. It's the only time you need to slow down. Let the energy flow through you, then just direct it where you want it to go.
Have you had this headache for a month without any relief? It's fine. - And where is the pain located? - All over the head. It moves.
Helle wouldn't have known about it. Morten probably much less so. There was a small box with photos in Morten's house. It was above the fridge where the typewriter was. Here it is.
I need a minute to catch my breath. No, she's right. We should stop. Let's stay here so the giant snake can catch us. I don't think it followed us.
I understand. - Do you? - Of course I do. You know, it's like there's a bubble around us. And you just don't want it to burst just yet.
After asking for 20 percent of the company and bragging that he can save it. After all, he's just another arrogant braggart who thinks he can save everything. But you can't. Kevin, nobody hates change as much as I do. But it's coming, whether we like it or not.
I can lose any war. I'm tired of losing people. Look at you, with those eyes and that perseverance. And that anger and your kindness. One day... that memory will be so painful that I won't be able to bear it and I'll do what I always do. I'll put myself in my box and run away, run away, so that the pain doesn't catch me. And it will be everywhere I go.
Your own men saw her riding towards the camp. Alone, of her own free will. Are you really surprised? You told her about Condé's offer to protect her if you gave up the Crown, trusting in her loyalty, and once again she betrayed you. She may even assume that you will accept the offer, thinking that it will prevent the slaughter of your people and save her, because she knows deep down that you are forgiving.
I need you to delay this. What's that? No, I thought we needed to bring the dome down... Before we suffocate to death. It is, but the resistance is working on a cure. We need to know if it works before your equipment does.
It was small, but it fell in the middle of the city. - I haven't heard anything about it. - It's here. Move it, people. But when a catastrophe actually happens, it usually comes out of the blue.
- I could feel the plane. - Dr. Webber, one second? Excuse me a second. I heard you tell that story six different ways today. Each time, the plane is getting closer. Next time, she'll end up with:
Do you know the expression "hard head"? Sometimes the only way to get someone's attention is to hit them over the head with a sledgehammer. I'm not one for surfing the Internet, but I respect vloggers, bloggers and all those people because they communicate with the world instantly. I have a message for Hakeem. She's spontaneous, she's genuine, she's Freda Gatz, with criticism to spare!
Proofreading: Scratch "Your memory is a monster. It appears of its own accord. You think you have a memory, but it has you."
Hi. I'm the new guy. It's him! I've seen this picture a million times. It won a Pulitzer Prize.
- There's a lot to be said for that. And above all, I made McKenzie and Brianna stop hating Kelsey S and now they're friends. You're very welcome. - That's impressive, thank you. Dr. Susman, let's call this excursion what it was... - A huge success.
They won't be back from Florida for a few weeks. Good neighbors often exchange keys. Are you a good neighbor, Mrs. Renziger? The voice on the recording didn't say "Jim Harmon", it said "Imi rami".
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything.
You said you were going to avenge Anthony. So, tell me what it's like to know that you're responsible for your friend's death? Can we move on? Have you forgotten her so quickly? You discarded her and you're a human being. Think how quickly that thing you created will be able to discard you. Do you ever lie awake at night wondering what day it will see you as a threat?
That's crazy. It's déjà vu. It's the mind taking a present event and mistaking it for a memory. The mind. You can't trust the mind because it plays tricks on you.
- Why do you make fake weapons? - Nobody buys my art. Then make it for yourself. Beauty is important, Frank. It gives us hope.
See you soon. I'll see you soon. I imagine that since you're not going with the land team, all the action will take place on the ship. The cure is the most important thing. Whatever happens, I know you'll get her where she needs to be.
I really did have soft hands, didn't I? I took it as a compliment, but I don't think he meant it. Get out of my way. It's amazing how our skin changes, isn't it? The more you abuse it, the stronger it gets.
So far we've only recovered around 700. - So 1,300 weapons are missing? - Yes. Including the murder weapon we're looking for. Any idea how it disappeared in Mexico and ended up in Washington, DC?
I don't want to. My anger is part of me. It's what keeps me going. I'm simply saying that if you're not careful, if you don't control your anger, it can turn against you.
It seems "avoidable" to me. Is "avoidable" a word? That's fine. That facility has already served my purpose. It will now become your tomb.
I'm sorry. And to be honest, I feel very strange. Why, what happened? I got a letter from Cousin Violet. Why didn't she bring it?
- Listen to me! You weren't the only one to suffer that night. I'm sorry, but this is personal for many of us. Your career is hanging by a thread, Levi. You really are. If you keep stepping on other people's toes, it'll be over soon.
- Yeah, I'm telling you, you've got something here, kid. Miss Dawson, hi, it's Billy Carson. I just want you to know that everything's fine. No matter what anyone says about me. I know the truth, even if it doesn't come out.
But there wouldn't have been if Rasheed had taken him out through the fire exit. Nor would there be if he had left the hotel and found other accommodation. One possibility. If he hadn't left his epinephrine with the rest of the toiletries. It is prescribed for a fatal peanut allergy and I doubt he would voluntarily travel without it.
- Maybe. Wait, you have to finish the story. So you really had to break his knee? No. I had to shove the stick in even harder, and it ended up causing the tibial plateau to crack.
I know how much you and your wife hate me. Believe me, the feeling is more than mutual. But despite everything, I really thought you loved our city. Maybe even as much as I do. I really believed that, when faced with a common enemy, an enemy that wants to destroy our city and everything it stands for,
"I'm used to it, it happens all the time in the desert, "but this one fooled me. "And here's the thing, this death, this end of mine "is exactly what should have happened. "I wanted darkness. I fucking asked for it. "It has me now.
It will decide how the device will be used, if and when it will be launched, and on whom it will be launched. And that committee does not include scientists or engineers. - Wait, is that a Security Council? - No, it's not. - Are they setting new health standards? It's called the Target Committee, and as it stands, no one who helped build the bomb will be able to have a say in how or where it will be dropped.
- I'll sign the papers. - And one more thing... I want a seat on the Target Committee. We scientists built this bomb. We want a say in how and where it will be used.
Why are you going back to your office? I'm going back to Sid's office, to see what I can find out. Listen, the patrols have just arrived with Evelyn's cell phone. This is Evelyn's cloud account. It's synchronized with her phone.
No. But... he wore a ring. A red and silver signet ring on his right hand. - I remember that. - Evelyn, back to the mask, did it look like these?
Cousin, why am I here? It's all right. There are three reasons why I chose to live in prison. Protection from my many enemies. It creates a blind spot for my many businesses to operate without suspicion.
Marla speaks. So the question is, how does Marla speak? When a girl wants Marla to talk, she presses this button that turns on a microphone. While Marla listens, audio recordings travel through a web server, where they are converted into text. It creates a database, so that in the future, when the doll responds, she responds with something the child likes.
But I'd like to know if he's put on weight because he's still in love with me. And now we're out. Don't you feel better? Don't worry too much about light, perspective and colors. Let your painting be what it wants to be. - How's that?
That's ridiculous. If you were on the perimeter you'd be blocks away, not 100 meters from the explosion. There's not a scratch on you which is impossible Unless you placed yourself where we found you after the explosion which I believe you did. And we checked your gun. It was recently fired three bullets, and there's nothing in the file on the table, so you'd better pray you don't find them.
There's no chance of you being treated like a normal employee. Not initially, but when they find out that I'm not a spoiled brat - maybe they won't like me for valid reasons. - They'll like you. It's part of my job to recognize quality where it exists.
It's not a device. It's the Lurkworms. Very interesting, aren't they? Light is a telepathic field. It adjusts everything you see according to your expectations, your experiences.
It can't be. She's dead. She's not breathing. This thing is an ecstatic cocoon. If you're dead, it's like a luxury fridge. But if you're alive... It just keeps you that way.
No. - Many prophecies suggest... - No. All the prophecies of the Matrix agree that this creature will one day stand on the ruins of Gallifrey. It will unravel the web of time, and destroy a billion billion hearts to heal yours.
What do you mean by database? It seems to be the main service hatch. I just need to find the key. When Time Lords die, their minds are uploaded to something we call the Matrix. This structure, it's a living computer.
For example, perhaps it can't take off if a life form indicates that it is both inside and outside it? Head and body. Which would mean, and again it's just another theory... that the door isn't working properly. Of course. It can't seal the Real Time envelope.
The money. As well as the money, there were some letters in the bag. She was nervous and didn't notice. There's a letter in there. Give it back and I'll forget everything that happened. If it ends up in someone else's hands. Well, you can imagine what happens.
Show him that his thirst to make this county grow should not be quenched with the sweat and blood of his own people. It is the people's duty to pay. Only rebels refuse to honor the rule of law. No peon wants a rebellion. It only appears after hope and reason have been burned away.
One that will forever mark your place in time. I'm here to help tell that story. My story is already over. No. It has just begun.
We went on to bury my husband. Yes, of course. Another thought, ma'am. This executioner... His arrival... although it has brought sadness, it may bring good fortune.
The prince has nothing to do with Laura. If you kill one policeman, there are a thousand to take his place. If you kill the prince, their god, you drive a stake straight through their heart. - Do that and your life is over. - It's already over.
A foolish attack by young hearts. I can be trusted. I... have earned my leadership. I steer our course as best I can, but the revolution can't stay folded up in a box. It has no law, no punishment.
That... is what Byth Encil wants, Love, change. An independent Wales is also my greatest wish. But that change will never happen with blade against blade. You're smart enough to know that. It will have to happen at a table with men and women of the same temperament and with the same open heart.
Copper braided... It is non-corrosive. It is designed to withstand extreme temperatures... Fire, heat, cold, water. EDC teams wouldn't be able to detect a bomb if it were submerged.
Who cares if your mother is using your father? Look, you always said he wanted another chance. Now he's got one. And maybe... Maybe she has to tell him herself that it's political because it's too painful to admit that she still loves him after everything that's happened.
But there's one thing you don't know. This is based on a real-life scenario. We stopped them. Can you do it? Just like the FBI did, you have to find the suspect and recover the chemical weapon before it disappears.
Don't give me weapons, give me an army. - We can't get involved. - They're already involved. There's a prophecy. You have to make sure it passes.
That's the deal. The situation in Angola was urgent and a growing threat... to the national security of the United States. And its decision to declare war was based solely on... A methodical and rational recourse to a threat... And it was supported by intelligence. You never saw that recording of Olivia Pope. I didn't even know she existed.
But why did she have to bring Rami into the Palace? That was the beginning. That was the mistake. We still have to deal with Rami. And you said that the evidence will prove what we need it to prove, right?
So that's King Arthur's weakness? Then you must be Guinevere. Unfortunately, I can't give you what you want. Although I can share something just as good, assuming you want to make a deal for the glove. What does it take to complete a magic sword? Making it look complete. With this.
Five hundred and seventy-five, five hundred and seventy-six. Hello. What's a fireworm doing that far away? It wasn't supposed to be anywhere near our island. She could have gotten lost...
Gronkels may be slow, but they're tenacious. É. Tell me about it. Don't put that stone in your mouth. You don't even know where she's been, young man.
Hold on. Go back a bit. - Hygiene? - Eating habits. If we find out what this thing eats, then we find out where it eats.
What else is different about our worlds? Do you have Tahiti? I've never been, but I love Atlantis. The lost city submerged in the ocean? On my Earth, it's on top of the water.
I share your concerns. So why are you negotiating with her? We need her. What do we need her for? Look, I don't know how she convinced Avery to give up the collection, but the fact is, she's worth at least 10 million.
What's wrong? I... I mean... If I... If I stand up straight, she'll disappear, right?
Yes, that's a small part of the brain in this area. The brain? Yes, it's a small area. What does this small area of the brain do? Well, it takes care of muscle control on the right side.
If we had set sail in August, Captain. If wishes were horses. We'd ride the winds all the way home instead of fighting them. It's not just the wind that bothers me. The tension is building in the ship's hold, and unlike the water, it's only increasing.
I wrote down what you told me... About this city coming together. United. This city used to be like that. That's what it can be.
We don't know what they mean. Those alarms are about the Dark. The Dark is just a story. No, it's not. It exists.
I think... I've been thinking a lot... About the past lately, and how one stupid decision can... Can turn your life into something you don't recognize, as if it belonged to someone else.
I apologize. Do you remember this sword? When you stuck it in my chest? But you didn't have all the pieces then, did you, literally? You see, when a vampire is hit in the heart with the full sword, it acts like a magical conduit, transferring his spirit to it...
Now the advantage goes to the suckers. They scatter, but one is wounded. The shark is stronger, but the sucker is much more agile. The sucker's strategy is to stay on its tail. It's the only place where it can't be caught.
They scatter, but one is injured. The shark is stronger, but the sucker is much more agile. The sucker's strategy is to stay on its tail. It's the only place where it can't be caught. It stays close and then makes a sudden escape.
That doesn't sound right. What's bothering you? Too many dead people. You're suffering. I can take that pain away. I don't want it to go away.
All I hope for is justice. And it comes... for those who have faith. This is not the time to talk about faith. This is precisely the moment, now that it is needed.
- Are there no multiple-choice exams here? - Or very few, if any. - Really? - Because all my exams in the US.... How do you give the correct answer if it's not on the list with the four options?
Growing up, we were close. Richard, Ray and me. Not like a gang, but... We weren't saints. One night, probably 18 years ago... They were fooling around behind Ray's house... Fiddling with Ray's dad's gun and... It went off.
And by all accounts, it was a UFO sighting. But it was much more than that. This orb actually fell to the ground. According to the report, when investigators arrived at the supposed crash site, they found a strange disk-shaped object. Nazi officials were said to have taken the damaged craft to a nearby security facility... where it was examined by leading German aeronautical experts, including Wernher von Braun.
In fact, we've come to tell you that it's going to be privatized. Fine, but there's the question of my takeover bid, which is up to the shareholders. - And my 20 percent vote in favor. - Good for you. We're sure that the other 80 percent will want our offer, because it's ten dollars more per share. That's a lie.
You. You're the leader. A born leader. And you have wisdom. But it was born out of loss.
Good evening. I'll have a beer and a shot of whisky. You forgot to close the door. No, I didn't. It didn't lock.
And I'm afraid there's nothing left for you here. What does that mean? That I've often wondered if I did the right thing by not sending you to prison that day. That would have ruined my life completely. And look how ruined it isn't right now.
- I gave you an order. I said... Go! This bomb is connected to an altimeter. Try to pull me off the train and it'll detonate instantly.
Well, he said he'd call back with a time and place for delivery. Well, that's perfect. When he does, you keep the call, while we precede to the location. What we have to do, though, is get the painting back. So, where is it now?
I've been in touch with their son, Taylor. Is he yours? No, I don't think so. I'll try to get a message to Martha through him. I'll make a polite suggestion, that you... don't make the situation any more complicated than it already is.
Toby calls us robots, but what's cooler than a robot? - He always analyzes feelings, Sylvester is pure feeling, Paige helps us understand them. But without gears, a machine doesn't work. My role is to break the machine when it starts talking - and loses focus.
- She and the junkie planned it. - No. And now, the former best player of the 1987 Super Bowl, for the Washington Red Clouds, and the future Mayor of this great city... Peter Van Eyck. A woman is going to die if we don't stop it. Where is she?
Astrobiologist Chandra Wickramasinghe believes that this plankton is of extraterrestrial origin, and is proof of panspermia - the concept that life exists throughout the Universe and is spread by comets and asteroids. I think what happened was that a small fragment of a comet carried micro-organisms, including the plankton that fell on the window of the International Space Station. It's not surprising if we accept the idea that life is continually arriving on Earth from space. There has always been a problem about life on Earth. Did it really start here on Earth or did it get here from somewhere else?
I had it right where I wanted it. Wait a minute! Quill, are you doing something stupid and reckless there? Sort of. Look, if Thanos still wants this box, then it must still be dangerous.
- Good news! They found my mom! You have to hear this story, Kermit! No, no, I can listen to it tomorrow. Gonzo... tomorrow. No, no, she's amazing.
- Yes, I'm still here. - Yes? Well, goodbye. I'm still here. I don't know how to turn this thing off when it's on the map.
Funyuns! Well, let's get to know Niecy. To begin with, her name is Denise. I've given Niecy a nickname, - and it seems about right...
Seriously, Miss Piggy, you can't have a bottle of Piggy water on your desk during the show. - That's an unpaid advertisement. - I'm trying to make it known. Kermit. It's a great product. When you open it, there's lipstick on the neck as if I'd had a sip of water.
Cancel the stunt? What? Why? What for? Well, I guess you don't want the name associated with Piggy water. You know, the FDA is investigating whether it even has the right to be called water. I hear it might fall into the category of sauces.
Yes! Let go again! Let go again! - Yes. - You know, Scooter. When you first came here your aura was normally yellow, but after you left, it was like glowing indigo, as if something was awakened inside you.
He's a dangerous ganster. Well, then he must be a right-winger. What could possibly go wrong? I mean, apart from the fact that your ship is a piece of junk? Why is it that when it does something cool, it's your ship, but when it's falling apart, it's already mine?
I made him say all that with my weak mind. Clever. Too bad you won't live long enough for anyone in Nova Corps to hear that. Didn't I mention that this thing doesn't just record? It also transmits.
I'm afraid I can't answer that question. What do I think about Snapchat? Comedian It's that thing where your dick goes off. Isn't it that thing where you put your dick in and then it just disappears?
No... there are no Jedi. Look. My old cybernetic eye... must be faulty again. Sorry to waste your time. This image was taken by a droid probe. It clearly shows that they are harboring rebels.
I don't know what that girl did to me, but I haven't been well since. I can't eat or sleep. I don't dream. And all the things I used to enjoy... My Lizzie blog, the ghost conventions... All that doesn't matter anymore. I put this whole collection on Ebay last night. And now it belongs to a machinist in Ohio.
I can arrange transit to hell. Opening the cage is another matter. You're the king of the joint. Don't you have a key? It was sealed by God himself.
To keep us going, in other words alive, they need a voice, a leader, a master. And in our brains, the pituitary gland has that job. It anticipates the body's needs even before they arise, by working non-stop. The pituitary gland communicates with all the other glands and orders the production of our vital hormones. It keeps everything running in perfect order.
The pituitary gland communicates with all the other glands and orders the production of our vital hormones. It keeps everything running in perfect order. - Would you like a muffin? - No, you don't. - Go on, go on! - There's no denying it. She has the hardest job in the body.
At least her life isn't over either. Nothing is finished. It's different for us clergy. People place their trust in us. If we break that trust, it stays broken.
Okay, I'll take him to the NICU. - I'll take him to the NICU. - I'll take him. She hasn't released the placenta yet. She has to come out.
What do you think you're doing? Never stand between a Mandalorian and artillery. It's Kanan. He'll want to hear about our success. She's got the speed, the maneuverability and the artillery.
What do you think you're doing? Never stand between a Mandalorian and artillery. It's Kanan. He'll want to hear about our success. She's got the speed, the maneuverability and the artillery.
- How? - DNA, Gibbs, is in all living things. In fact, the DNA of a tree is very similar to human DNA. That's great! That's great, Abbs, great. But to get a match, I'll need the sawdust, and I'd need a sample of the tree it came from.
Did you confide in Quill? He can't keep a secret even if his life depends on it. Or keep a map still while I'm trying to navigate. Yes, make a recording, Gamora. It lasts longer.
You, not so much. Do you speak ill of my plans? Why did you risk Korath getting the box? Unless you didn't... Because she was at Milano the whole time!
Why did you risk Korath getting the box? Unless you didn't... Because she was at Milano's the whole time! But you had to hide it to make it convincing, right? It's a good thing they don't know you crashed the ship in Sarawat, and that she's there defenceless.
We're here. Are you sure about that, genius? Yes, that's strange. There's this dead moon called "Mandala" on the map. But she's not here in person.
Who does that remind me of? I ask myself. Quill. This moon reminds me of Quill. Because she's very immature, just like Quill is.
These are the girls who are going against the deviants, the divorcees, the scientists, the hip-hop lovers, and? the hookers. I don't like people or science, but there's nothing wrong with hookers. We need to show the world that we won't tolerate these deviants and degenerates! I don't want to be associated with these people. Gays will hate us forever and when I get a house, I want it to be decorated.
It's like a TV dinner exploding. - Well done. - Someone update me, please? On my way to the Green Room with the bomb ready. It's chemically armed, a kinetic reaction, so as soon as I touch it, we have 15 minutes before it detonates.
It's a game where you're given three people and you choose which one to kiss, marry or kill. My game is better, because instead of marrying someone, you eat them. - Let's just play. - I'll start with an easy one. Electric eel, balloon fish, shrimp. Well, I wouldn't fight the eel, because I know it generates energy that can kill a horse.
- You're not the guys... - We've never heard of them! I was wondering why the song keeps popping into my head. I don't know. It's very catchy.
Because nothing remains a secret. And you'll probably end up... You'll probably end up in jail. Or if any of these guys start taking risks... and think they have to end it all, you'll end up getting killed. Think of it as a ladder, and you're the first rung on that ladder. When all this information comes out, as soon as it comes out, all the rungs of this ladder... will collapse rung by rung...
Anything? - Nothing. - Nothing at all. - What about you? - I found something strange. Dr. Brennan found this glucometer at Vivian's house. I checked it twice and Vivian wasn't diabetic. I took a look at this thing and it's been modified.
But in the dense and complex world of the jungle, hunting is an eternal game of hide and seek. Here, it pays to stay still and disappear into the landscape because you never know who's watching. Parson's Chameleon specializes in the game of "see and not be seen". His eyes do all the work while the rest of his body moves in slow motion, so as not to scare off potential targets. The problem is that he only sees his prey if it moves.
Yes, that will do. The lightning attack gave him the advantage over his prey, but it doesn't pay to be complacent. In the jungle arms race, someone often comes along with a more powerful weapon. There is one predator that has perhaps the most ingenious response of all to the challenge of the jungle. She lives on the banks of rivers in the forests of Madagascar.
- That's not the point. Look, it makes me very uncomfortable. Could you get rid of it? Don't say another word. She's gone.
But what about this new job? Shouldn't it make things easier? I invented it. What? Why? Why did you invent it? Because it's humiliating to tell your daughter that practically the whole world thinks you don't deserve it. Sometimes I think I've screwed up my life so badly that it'll never get back on track. Right, look.
We've been taken out of hyperspace. The Empire... The transmission has been blocked. But it still doesn't make sense. You can't take a ship out of hyperspace... because you never know where it is.
Adult hares are easy to spot, but very difficult to catch. They run at 64 km/h. To catch one, the wolves work as a team. One gets close enough to bite the hare's tail, but the hare can change direction in an instant. If it keeps dodging and feinting, it will eventually defeat them.
They run at 64 km/h. To catch one, the wolves work as a team. One gets close enough to bite the hare's tail, but the hare can change direction in an instant. If she keeps dodging and feinting, she'll end up beating them. Finally, she runs away.
Everywhere we looked, we found incredible ice sculptures. Having more mobility enabled the team to find more and more bears, each one a character. With so much access to the Arctic's largest predator, the team eventually found its star. The Polar Bear's cunning summer hunt is finally recorded on film. She came up behind the seal, which dived into the water, but the bear jumped into the water and appeared a few seconds later with the seal between her teeth.
The hunters choose the best pieces. The high-ranking females and their offspring take their pieces. The males who didn't take part in the hunt feel wronged, becoming frustrated and moody. Meat is a precious delicacy in the flock's practically vegetarian diet. But it plays a vital role in chimpanzee society.
There's even a coordinated system for dealing with all the droppings. These are insects that, by working together, transcend their individual size. The colony can scour the entire jungle and expel its wildlife. Every day, they send a silent group through the forest in search of food. They don't use scouts like other ants.
looking for signs of life. They spread out over 10 meters, sweeping the forest floor. To find their prey, the ants must first touch it. It's ironic that the most successful player in the forest catching game is practically blind. She can only tell living things apart by their movement.
I didn't bring a present for the beautiful bride or the groom. Most of you know that I've been in rehab, so I haven't had much time to go shopping. Instead, I thought I'd sing a song to commemorate this beautiful evening. It's an old song, but it's a hell of a song. And nobody really knows what it's about, but for me... it's about family.
- Yes. Sorry. Mr. Woodbury, when you get there, we can run a system diagnostic. Happy, check out my engineering. If we can suspend a large tarpaulin over the structure, it becomes a new roof and improves drainage to prevent a slide down this hill.
He's in surgery. They're doing everything they can. I didn't want to hurt him. But he attacked me and we fought over the gun. - And it went off, I swear...
Opportunities don't last long. To hunt on the coast you have to be in the right place at the right time. On the east coast of the USA, in the tidal creeks of South Carolina, a group of hunters is about to leave the safety of their natural habitat. This group of bottlenose dolphins has developed a unique hunting tactic. It relies on teamwork, intelligence and synchronicity.
Too horizontal and the dolphins risk running aground. Too steep and they won't be able to force their prey out of the water. Working as a team, the dolphins surround the fish, corralling it towards the shore. Attacking in perfect sync, the dolphins create a bow wave. It drags the prey towards the muddy shore.
Food is plentiful here, as long as you know how to extract it. Monkeys have learned to use heavy stones as tools to open sea snails. It takes a lot of skill to master this technique, but not everyone has the knack. You have to be clever to survive on the coast. When the tide recedes even further, it reveals the next course.
Send me pies every hour. I'll talk to the Otters and tell them dinner's ready. I've been staring at a rock for three hours. After a week of observation... Where did she go? Where is she?
And they took off their slippers before they saw the key? Yes. And the first time they took them off, nobody saw the key? The key wasn't there the first time they took them off. And when you saw the key, it was right there on the floor, correct?
I want the audience to ask questions. I don't want it to be obvious. You have to look and try to put the pieces together. Who would have thought that after photographing all night without knowing how to light the fin, because the beam was pointed downwards and all you could see was Yoram's torso. Eventually, I realized that he only needed to swim diagonally backwards, so I could light his whole body. It's a simple photo. You can't imagine everything it entails, but it's a necessity, for my sanity and my soul, and it makes me feel fulfilled.
There's nothing wrong with me. - It's not true. - Gerda, this isn't right. Radiation is a miracle, Mr. Wegener. It destroys the bad and saves the good.
It would be a bit strange with just the two of us. Did it hurt? No. How did you choose this life? It chose me.
You must know that I was the woman who tamed the eagle. Well, everybody out. Hello. The prey believes that if it stays still, it won't be seen. But in fact, it moves.
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules! Do you want to know the truth about Hercules? Here it is.
- Ev, you still have time. Make the most of it. Why waste it looking for someone who might not even exist? He does exist. There's a window here, it won't stay open for long, and soon, it will close.
It doesn't just... end. Are you still a believer? Do you still believe? I'm not. My faith has been... It's been taken away from me.
Okay, look, I didn't take the gun. It must be lying around somewhere in the house. I'm telling you, I've looked everywhere. It's not here. Okay, last night, when the lights went out, where was she?
- It could be, I suppose. - Yes. It could be. Life is like an onion, that's what I say. The more you peel it, the more it makes you cry.
He could be anywhere. Go find a safe place to study the diary and then come back. Return? I've been following this creature for almost 200 years. - It will return.
Spassky agreed to play in the ping-pong room. That's fine. Wait a minute. Where are you going? Just a camera. It doesn't move.
It's all right. Wait a minute. Where are you going? Just a camera. It doesn't move. It doesn't make a sound.
That single moment of unshakeable joy? That moment when everything... in our world, inside and out, was right. Everything was going well. But now we've become adults and everything goes wrong! All the time! It's as if we're on a quest to get it back. And yet, the more we focus on our personal happiness, the more it eludes us.
My God, not her. Not now. And once again, this grotesque maelstrom of indecency is centered on an individual royal. - Thank you, Your Majesty, for allowing me to clear the air. I finally declare a magic, and it's called "Spirit".
THE ENCHANTED KINGDOM The rainforest... right in the heart of this vast continent... the rainiest place in Africa. What lies beneath this dense green blanket? The mysterious forest. With so much sun and rain, it grows inexorably... and all over the tangled forest is the noise of countless creatures.
-Yes, sir. Your brother is out of surgery, everything went well. But the fractures in his leg are serious. There's a plate and 12 screws connecting the bones. You can't lean on that leg or it won't heal properly.
Among the visible injuries caused by marijuana, two seem to appear on a daily basis more than others. Two seem to be the main reasons why marijuana should be kept away from the public. The first. There's the famous belief: "Only one joint damages the mind." The more you consume cannabis, the more it damages your mind.
"Just one joint damages the mind." The more you consume cannabis, the more it damages your mind. My first seven years as a researcher were dedicated to schizophrenia. I can tell you that's ridiculous. Psychiatrist, Neuropsychopharmacologist We analyzed the evidence. We've read about 2,000 papers and it doesn't cause schizophrenia.
- Stop it. Your dick looks like a sad giraffe. - Your dick looks like a shaved hamster. - Will you stop it? Your dick looks like my dick if it were bigger and blacker.
Let's put that aside, shall we? Take a look. Here's mine, right? Chris? You didn't use a key to get in. - No, I didn't bring it. - Where is it?
Remove what? The lid off your father's urn. What's that? I didn't take it. Was it here when we got home?
Adrian, was it Dad who died? That's right. On our way back from the funeral, the urn had the lid on it and some time passed and somehow the lid disappeared. "Disappeared"? Where did it go?
-Time? -Four minutes and 45. -He never went to the mill. -E? What's the point? Judge Palmer stated that he reached the mill road, that it was flooded and that he turned back.
I'm not Roman, I'm a citizen of Pompeii. So why do I see the Roman eagle everywhere? I'm not part of that. After a year in Rome, I didn't want to see that eagle anymore. Still, it's nailed to the floor of my house.
No hope. No peace. Maybe I should have... No, you haven't let me down. You can't take my pain, and I didn't want it to go.
The police don't know what to do with it and I'm not getting any help from the ROC. Help me... and it's your battery. That kernel is burnt out. This unit has been shot. The policeman who shot it swears it was repairing itself.
Completed in 438 BC, the Parthenon. From the Greek word parthenos, meaning "virgins". "The ancient Greeks were masters of artifice," he says, "although the base of the Parthenon looks straight to the naked eye, it is in fact completely crooked.
-What happened to your head? -I'm sorry? Your head? What happened? I was fixing the windows during the storm and she fought back.
No. No. No, I was at the beginning. So... you... theorized a machine that could solve any problem. It doesn't just do one thing, it does everything.
The boy now stands before the men, just as you all once did, ready to continue the tradition. The boy has a day and a night to find out what he's made of. When morning comes, he will bring us what the forest has in store for him. The forest is a harsh judge. It gives everything to everyone,
They're ready to parachute, but they're still 30 minutes away, ma'am. If anyone has an idea of how to get us out of this mess, now would be a good time to say so. But who is that? The forest is a harsh judge. It offers everything to everyone, you just have to know how to listen to it.
I love you. Go to the roof. All right. Find my seed. She's out here.
And I'm alone. No, no, that's discrimination. That's not cool. Do you want to know why? Well, when you have a little rosebud mouth like yours, and it starts to wrinkle like that, and your little breasts... we don't have much to comment on, When they start to fall like ripe plums from the tree
Here's the thing: everything can get worse. Grandpa's dead. I'm sorry. Death comes as a reminder. It holds us, shakes us.
Why can't you see that this is incredible? Because, Sara, what's happening to Blake. It's simply not possible. The camera wasn't designed to work like this. The camera doesn't heal bullet wounds. It simply opens a door in a part of the brain that most people keep locked. That's it.
Or it's a miracle. If it's not a miracle, it's a side effect. Honestly, I don't understand why you don't call medical journals and tell them what's new. Because I invented the damn thing. I know what it's capable of.
This is the amygdala. It's the part of the brain where the emotion of fear is generated. And until today... until today, Blake's entire frontal lobe was severely damaged by that bullet... absolutely, totally indifferent. I think this is about the camera. I think it's doing something to everyone.
We hide behind social masks. We have to wear them. We can't survive without them. It's not the mask that's scary. What's scary is what it represents.
But since you haven't made any monthly payments in the last... eight years, you've already reached the available credit limit. So we have no amount to release. - The house must be worth... - It was worth... Not anymore!
And this board here, the kingdom for this king, this board is like our land. We have to protect our land, don't we? And we do that by all acting united with our king. Now, if we lose our king, Maui, it's game over, no more game, because he has the magic, so we have to protect him. Now, the last thing about Maui, our king, is that he has to carry that responsibility and it's a heavy one.
And, bam, there it is. Right under our noses. All this time swimming in the ocean. So, what I'm saying is... Maybe, that thing we're looking for, maybe it's always been here.
- He died on Sunday, I saw him on Monday, he died with them, he must be there. Don't look, you mustn't look. - Sorry, I didn't mean to. - I'd better pass him quickly. - Could you turn on a light? - I can't, we have strict rules. But we can get off the road. We could also be the target of German bombing. They fly into town and shoot all the way back. - Does anyone live on that island? - No, it's abandoned. This place has been abandoned for years.
Wait a minute, I've just told you that your son is dying. And you can't do it? Who are you? You'll do it. Or I'll make your life worse than it already is.
Take a look at this one. Tell me you saw this. Saw what? The face. She just walked across the screen.
Outside, with the mundanes? They're all fakes, Suki. They're all photocopies. Sinclair is trying to turn you into one of them by killing the best part of you. But he's started something that the machine can't stop, because it works for us now.
I'm sure he knew what he was doing. They say you find out who you really are on the way down. But I've already seen that. The Scribbler machine shows you everything. It wakes up parts of the brain that we've never used.
- As soon as you can. Today is May 5, and he may already be back to celebrate the Fourth of July with us. Reverend Dowd, we can't allow this. It's not a woman's place to take a wagon across the country. Even less with three of God's most incapable daughters in it.
Damn, that hurt. She looked so ridiculous in that hat... Excuse me, ma'am, but I'm looking for a lady called Altha Carter, do you happen to know where she lives? - She'll be the priest's wife... - That's what she is.
I didn't want to have that because... I shouldn't have, you know. No, no, that was a while ago, you did everything right. Are you sure? - Where's the key? - Where is it?
The law of probabilities and things like that. Coming up. - So what happened? - We were playing kickball. He was receiving and I was serving... I kicked the ball, it bounced off a rock... and accidentally hit him in the face...
This one is a bit more expensive than the ones we've seen before. You don't have that much money. Right? I mean, how can you justify spending it all on a headstone? Because it's not for me.
The Mask. Have you ever seen that? A vigilante, fighting for justice and all that. He wore silver bullets, something about how this precious metal represented the preciousness of life. The only precious thing about life is that it ends.
What are you doing to this house? Why are you in the closet with a gun? It's a system. Is it your system? This house, I mean, it's a mess.
James. No! You did it! We talked about this and you promised. Whatever you think this medieval thing can do, it can't.
James... When I moved here, nobody believed me. I hunted down the beast. I went into the forest and killed it. But it bit me first.
Goodbye. I don't know if I'll ever see her again. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. But I can guarantee one thing. Your favorite story, whatever it is, was written for a reader.
Yes, because I want to free them. Because religion is like a... like a virus of the mind that parents pass on to their children, and Christianity is the worst virus. It slowly eats away at our lives when we are weak, sick or powerless. So religion is like a disease? Yes. Yes, it infects everything.
In fact, we're like bastard children. "Wisdom and experience". The problem with wisdom: you only get it after experience. Wisdom won't help you today, it has taught you enough to help you next time.
Louise was right, I never know where they are. Last week, a sheep turned up at the brothel. - Did she? - Yes. She wandered in and when I went to pick her up, she'd already made $20.
So, because of that, I think it's very serious. Yes, it's very serious. You know, life goes on. It goes on. Whether you die or not, it goes on.
What happens to you when you listen to it? I feel good. It's like I have a girl and I want to keep her. And that's why, together, we're going to make this small gesture of kindness. Let's bring life to the places where she's been forgotten.
The girl? Her family came to mass five or six years ago. - Was it that girl? Oh, my God. - It's not her.
Yes. Can I go? Maybe I'll stay up. It's also for your wife and children. You have to take the tension out when you find something or it finds you.
I don't think Mom and Dad are back. I don't care. Oh, my God! Go back to your room, Henry! He stuffed the whole apple in his mouth, but it stuck. Lewis and Jeremy tickled him, and I worried he'd choke.
When people destroy crosses, break icons, dishonor the Crucifix and blaspheme by calling prayers demonic rituals, when people try to convince others that they do this with the best of intentions, they are broadcasting lies as if they were the truth. How can anyone preach freedom while destroying the foundations of morality? Freedom lies in discovering God's truth. The Bible teaches us that. Know God's truth and it will set you free.
Nothing. We were just playing with dolls and stuff. Malcolm came into my room and went through my box. Malcolm, is that true? Yes, but I only touched it for two seconds. It stank!
Well, I don't agree with Mr. Darwin on many things, but there is a certain credibility to the idea of the survival of the fittest. You don't bargain with nature, you're in the best shape or she'll outlive you.
There are no legacies in this life, are there? There are no statues. No history. Just water. It pays us, and then it claims us.
I don't want to make it a social thing. That's fine. But you'll have to find a schedule. Once a week, otherwise it will keep happening. You put off the change until it finally takes hold of you.
He's thinking of building a hotel like the monstrosities he has in Montparnasse, he has an option to buy all the others as soon as he owns ours, but until then the City Council won't give him the go-ahead. So you really need it, how nice. It's about preserving a whole neighborhood, don't you see? Of course I understand, but what's wrong with my idea of splitting the apartment in two? - It's unacceptable.
Do you see the header? Yes. The other times don't match up with the other sequences. Which means the clue couldn't have come from Prague. - It was placed there.
Unfortunately, Ryan, there are times in this life when only violence can protect us. This is not one of those moments. Let me do my job, Javier. Don't start this war. It's already started.
Living by the sea, looking out of my windows, I feel like I'm part of the weather itself. Sometimes the sky is so blue and the reflection of the sea so dazzling that you can't even look at it, and other times big black storm clouds slide across the ocean and you feel like you're inside the storm itself. What I fear most is nature. Now that she's sent her weather to take revenge, now we all have to put up with it.
I can postpone some things on my agenda and be there in a couple of hours. That's nice, but you know, there's a lot going on here and... - How's the vodka campaign going? - Not bad. Once I get some of the creatives in place it should be fantastic.
Until all Rafeiros comply with the rules of the Pack. So that's the plan? An all-out hunt for the mutts. Antonio, there's a part of me that would like to slaughter every last one of them. Pete's death was avoidable. It only happened because I became complacent.
And without the Pack to enforce the law, the mutts would be free. And in time, our society would be revealed to the outside world. And humans would do what humans do best... War. And it wouldn't stop until one side or the other was completely exterminated.
I've become immune to all your toys. I know what's inside you. The darkness. I live in darkness... But I miss the light, even though it burns me.
It has something to do with a call for women's education. If she was an illiterate orphan, she couldn't have written this. It's misguided, but not entirely devoid of intelligence. Aren't you in favor of women's education? I admire learning wherever it can be found, but this is an attack on the authority of Church and State.
Remember how you first challenged my best student and only came to me after beating him? I left him in charge of the school. Now I rarely go there. Hung Yip, the movie star? In the next scene I want the camera focused on the motorcycle when it hits the ground! Then the fighters on the left throw themselves at Hung Yip!
It's a brutal, I admit, ridiculously simple solution. My idea. Your entrance, we observed, was marked by a moment of involuntary spasms. So we're using this. You wake up, drop the ball, it inflates. You fall back to sleep for a while.
Well, you're on your own. But you're the one who sat on their fish tacos! Nice talking to you, buddy. Lisa, Lisa, I spent all day at work making a Duff distillery for our mini-Springfield. I don't want to brag, but... It really distills.
You're going down! If you go into the red, you'll fall. Look, I'm going to install a warning light on your dashboard. A warning light? If it comes on, you have to reduce the power.
The weak ones, Carl. That's assuming you find them faster than that thing can invade. What does that mean? The thing keeps testing the weaknesses in our defenses, trying to get in at different points, some we didn't even know about. This is the door to the basement. I didn't think it gave free access to the outside until it came in here.
What does that mean? The thing keeps testing the weaknesses in our defenses, trying to get in at different points, some we didn't even know about. This is the door to the basement. I didn't think it gave free access to the outside until it got in here. We barely detected it in time. Somehow, it knows.
We hardly detected it in time. Somehow, it knows. What the hell is this thing to be so intelligent? I don't know if it's intelligent. I think it knows more about the house than we do.
Somehow, she knows. What the hell is that thing to be so clever? I don't know if it's intelligent. I think it knows more about the house than we do. And she gets hungry.
The door! Be careful! Hold it now. It's a fragile door. It won't hold.
I don't want you to go outside. Darling... I know what you're thinking, but this is different. We saw that thing. We saw how big it is and how strong it is,
Liss? Alissa. I can't stop. If I stop, I'll think about what that thing might have done to him. Or relive what it did to Jeff.
But we could hear the Yanks running towards us. And then we could smell them. The first Yank who passed me grabbed him by the neck and threw him to the ground. I bit him so hard that I felt the bone. Then he picked up a rock and hit me with it here.
I can appreciate a bit of devotion but some common sense would be nice. Real or fake swords can send the wrong message. And armor is heavy. Well, I'm the only one wearing it. It can be used as a weapon in itself.
I love that. The ones who try to fight back are the funniest. Well then, I guess you'll have to have fun with me. I believe Daniel Santos made you an offer? It's still valid.
They die squatting on their potties. Sooner or later, everyone dies. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take care of your life for as long as it lasts.
If they're lies, ma'am, isn't it better to avoid them? Not always. Many of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions designed to convince people that they have witnessed the power of the Lord. Once under his light, they will judge the lie for what it was: a trick that led them to the truth.
What the hell did you do? Nice. What's this thing doing in Gotham? Witnesses saw this creature trying to install some kind of bomb in the city. When the police tried to stop it, it spat fire at them.
If Davina isn't sacrificed, every piece of land that has shaken, everything that is happening now, will be covered in water and consumed by fire. Now you care about the city. We should care. We built it. And we also saw it consumed by fire, twice.
It's something much bigger. This flower is the signature of the woman who works for the Cardinal. Time to pay for your crimes, Milady. How many times have you cleaned these guns today? Respect your weapon, and it will respect you.
It has something to do with the Simons case. He knows something or is involved. The pedophile network is like fungus. It spreads under the ground. It connects all the perverts.
You can't run away from your destiny, Kiera. - Neither can we. - What's going on? This timeline is starting to collapse. If she dies, we die.
I thought she was a prostitute I hired. As if you couldn't smell that she was a wolf. An honest mistake. I see mistakes my way. So I have a suggestion but I think she's a winner in this market.
Don't fight it. Elena, listen carefully. Listen to me now! Don't fight the pain. It will kill you. It will kill you.
Trapped. I panicked and triggered the transformation. When we found you, you were human. I know that. I concentrated and she stopped.
Nobody captures the purity of the human form like Elena. I actually see something different. More the conflicted nature of humanity, the basic instincts of man, struggling to come out even when we deny them. Well, that's the good thing about art, right? It's subjective.
Yes, he did. He killed your brother and ruined your childhood. Nothing a good therapist can't fix. But this nonsense... Is it really necessary?
In the summer of 1895, Einstein's father's business in Germany had gone bankrupt and the family had moved to northern Italy. The young Einstein liked to wander those roads giving his mind a free realm to explore There is something timeless about this place. Nothing here has really changed since the time of Einstein's first daydreams. One day, he started thinking about light and how fast it travels.
If he ever posed for a portrait, it no longer exists. He was once described by an acquaintance as "a short, dark-complexioned, fat little man." Michell imagined a star so big, so massive, that nothing, not even light, could escape its gravitational pull Can you find a black star? You can't see it with your own eyes, not directly, but it could leave a kind of footprint on the cosmic beach.
The stars closest to the center of our galaxy whiz around it at more than 40 million kilometers per hour. What could make them move so fast? The only logical explanation is that something with the mass of four million suns lives in the center. But where is the blazing light of four million suns? Since we can't see it, it must be trapped inside a black hole.
And this is the death mask of that tree from 300 million years ago. It was shaped by minerals that replaced the original wood cell by cell - in other words, a fossil. The tree gave up its organic molecules to the environment a long time ago, its carbon and water. Only the form remains. When this tree was alive, it absorbed carbon dioxide and water and used sunlight to transform them into energy-rich organic matter.
Many underwater species glow in the dark through a process called bioluminescence. Our long history as land mammals, inhabitants of a sunny world, has not prepared us for the astonishing variety of life that evolution has created in the deep oceans. Since there is no sunlight down here, there is no photosynthesis. That means there are no plants to feed on, and yet even here, in a world of eternal midnight, there is a thriving food chain. It starts with a process called chemosynthesis.
What do you mean? I mean, do you always do what he tells you? No. If you know what happened in the mine, you should say something, Amos. I don't want to mess up your life any more than it already is, to tell you the truth.
No, you're my responsibility. You wanted me as your bodyguard. That means you do what I say until I get you out of here safely. Your insolence goes too far. Wrong, it can go even further.
Your souls are... - Was it you? - Not this time. Doom, look out! Captain, your honor is impressive, but sometimes it confuses me.
I'm not going to die for you. Of course, if I have to do this you'll have to... Take your leash off. Yes, I know. And it stays off.
Why do the Winchesters run towards death? No, don't. Don't. Don't stop. Sam, when I was human, I died... And that showed me that life is precious, and that it must be protected at all costs, even a life... as cheap as that of a Winchester.
I'm sorry, Dean. I have nothing to give you. What's that? I don't have the blade anymore. It's gone.
Now I can relate to how you feel. What are you talking about? The only person who screwed things up more consistently than you... was me. And now I know what that guilt feels like. And I know what it...
If that wasn't some kind of devil worship thing, I don't know what was. Well, thank you. Yes. The cow wasn't just killed. It was gutted.
But since I took over all this, I've eradicated them from our congregation. Yeah, well, I guess some of them didn't hear that part... like the sheriff who tried to kill me and my brother. Sheriff Pat? Let me see your bullet. - Where is it?
Son, whatever this is, I'm under arrest too. - Do you understand? - Yes. I've worked here for 22 years. I helped make this company what it is.
When are you going to get some balls? You're a member of LGAM, so stop sneaking out of Mommy's house and be firm. Be proud of yourself. Because life is short, you know? It is short.
My men brought your truck back safely. How can I thank you? You forget about Kabul. I'm the one who owes you. You left the war, but it never seemed to leave you.
He will mourn his wife. I assure you that those feelings will disappear after our first meeting. We have an easy life. The only difficulty we'll have is looking for food. This feeling you have now, this hunger, it will only grow.
I thought I'd give the newlyweds some space. - Right! - E... You know, Kat, I've been thinking a bit. Kat, this routine we have, me meeting you at home and reading together in bed, and me making you coffee in the morning, it's becoming...
Normally I wouldn't... I wouldn't go to see you, but I could feel... - not fear, maybe nervousness. - Yes, I'm a closed shell. - I'm sorry about what happened to you. - I hated the thing for what it did to me, so how can I also be grateful to it?
Bart, stop looking at her! But I want to see it! No, you'll wear it out. Darling, you saw something in this painting and you were right. The Van Houtens had this painting for years, and they never knew how much it was worth.
An hour ago we were ready to lock Dean in a cell, and now you're saying he's our best chance? Listen to him, Sam. Of course, Sam. Sorry, guys. Sorry, guys. Sorry I'm a little mad to hear that our best chance is to... weaponize the warhead and hope it hits its target.
See you later. I think we'd do well to move the assets into financial investments, Mrs. Imma. Because real estate is there, but it doesn't generate wealth, whereas money creates money. I know how to make money, Mrs. Imma. Without spending a penny, simply by taking out and giving out loans, playing with currencies... and above all, which is very important to us, without any risk. Why is that? Because if a judge finds a clue, it may lead to real estate, but not to money.
You can say we had a business relationship, but you didn't take a picture of me in bed. Say it's Photoshop. Anything you need to say. I'm sorry, Claire. I only have one copy, and it's still here.
Previously on "Devious Maids"... Beverly Hills is under attack. His aunt got the house, and it's going to be sold.
I'm going to sell it. Can you do that? Of course you can. I'm mandated with my Uncle Ken's power of attorney. I have to make decisions about this house and everything in it.
I told you not to leave with the car. Well? It's a long story. You'd better sit down. We were four stupid teenagers, talking about how unfair life was, so we thought we'd steal from the rich to give to the poor. It seemed so simple.
It's only a matter of time. So let's run away. To Tahiti, or to South America. We can build a new life. I like my life as it is.
- Mr. Miller, I have statements of all her accounts, even those in the Cayman Islands. I told you she was good at what she does. This is all a big misunderstanding. I moved some money around, but I was investing... for you... for the family. You shouldn't use that word, since you don't know what it means.
We shouldn't have survived, but we did. After that, we became one and the same. War changes people. No. It reveals them.
There's one way I can tell. An Urbino might not remember to keep watch... There's an open grate for ventilating the blacksmith's furnace. And it would go into the boiler? It runs from the chimney to the roof.
Duke Federico's men have left the city. I thank you, Leonardo. Anyone would do the same. Where did this humility come from? It doesn't suit you.
A pump? Why do you have a bomb? For reasons like this. Don't worry, it won't be detected by the UPS scanners. Now, the question is: When did you put the body there? Eight days ago. Eight days is a plant's life cycle, i.e. it releases the spores today.
I know you feel powerless because of what happened to Beverly and you want to do something about it. Is that wrong? It depends on what you plan to do. But there's no solution to the pain. It exists.
I didn't want to go to war with the agency I love. All this causes me pain. But the best way to deal with pain is to embrace it. Only then... It won't have power over you.
They are like landmarks for satellites. If we can add a new station to the SNGS network, it could shift the coordinates enough to change the missile's trajectory. - Great. How do we do that? How do we do that? We'd have to recalibrate an American GPS station so that it thinks it's part of the SNGS.
- You understand, right? - I understand. We have to end this. We found your bike. She'll put you on the spot.
And for that to happen, you have to complete it. But the cipher that allows you to do it. It's very formidable. However, I have determined its nature. This is a variation of le chiffre indechiffrable, which means it has a weak point. Complex as the cipher may be, the key to breaking it lies in a single keyword, perhaps a phrase.
Previously in Beware the Batman I want to use his mind for a while. The Soultaker sword. I've seen this sword in action. It sucks the soul out of helpless targets.
Punches, broken glass and dishes. We'd make up in bed. Then we'd fight more. I even thought the fight was foreplay. And then... that night... that night... the anger, it just...
We're going to unmask this place, Piper. You're on the moon, Larry. You've got to stop being on the moon! What's wrong with being on the moon? It doesn't have its own light.
You've got to let me go, man! It's too late. What are we going to find in the apartment? The gun. Where is it?
Okay, good. Good, good. Let's go around the back, so Carl won't see that you've left. Take the old road from the factory. Do you remember how to get there, Jacob? It goes out of town.
When I graduated, I asked him if I could keep it for a while. Where did the money come from? She worked. As a temp, at first, and then she set up her own company. She helps executives improve their communication skills.
In a safe place in the Syrian embassy for now. But she'll most likely be repatriated at any moment. Which means Maddie is in a hurry and vulnerable. She's trying to pull off a heist that would normally take months to plan. Do the Syrians know what's inside the effigy? If they did, she'd be in Damascus by now.
So why did she call you? Because the effigy of Astarte once belonged to my father. - He stole it from the British Museum. - He was a patriot who worshipped Astarte. - He thought it belonged to Syria.
The girl with the amber alert. I told you to mind your own business, Mrs. Bo, that's the girl's name. It's that child from the Amber Alert. That's her.
It has doubled our life expectancy, made the lost worlds of the past come to life. Science allows us to predict events in the distant future... and to communicate with each other at the speed of light, as I am doing with you right now. This way of thinking has given us powers that al-Hazen himself would have considered magic. But it was he who put us on this hard, endless road. And now it takes us to a place where light itself is shrouded in darkness.
Okay, while Fraunhofer adjusts his theodolite - a kind of telescope - I want to show you something in another part of the abbey. Sound waves are so beautiful to listen to. Imagine how beautiful they would be to see. Have you ever wondered why the organ tubes are different lengths? I press a key... it sends compressed air into a particular tube, producing sound waves.
How many of them do we leave in the rubble? The prince and his kingdom were immensely enriched by his act of kindness towards a poor orphan. Fraunhofer's discoveries transformed Bavaria from a remote rural region into a technological capital. When he was dying, the government was desperate to preserve every crumb of his precious knowledge about the high technology of optical glass. But it could only be divulged to one person with the highest level of security: the director of the mint.
It has made it possible for us to know what is in the atmosphere of other worlds and in galaxies millions of light years away. Spectral lines reveal not only the composition of distant objects, but also their movement towards or away from us. Using them, we discovered that our Universe is expanding. But perhaps the greatest revelation of spectroscopy is the discovery of what it cannot see.
Are you hungry? You shouldn't have resurrected me. Eat up. We have work to do. * You feed madness and it feeds on you. *
You shouldn't have brought me back to life. Eat up. We have work to do. * You feed madness and it feeds on you. * You feed madness and it feeds on you. *
Eat. We have work to do. * You feed madness and it feeds on you. * You feed madness and it feeds on you. * You feed the madness and it feeds on you. *
Peter, forget it. It's all right. Believe me, I hear it all the time. Come on, Peter. Come on, please. Since you asked... I said: "When she gets on the scale, she says one at a time, please."
But I liked this. I liked the phrase. "Uncommon valor was a common virtue." I like it too. She reminded me of Mom.
I know where every body is buried. The greatest weapon I can use against him is my father. Unusual value, it was a common virtue. The thing about that phrase is that it comes from the good old days. It no longer applies.
- I'm not gay. - Why are you whispering? Because your question is outrageous. You still shaved. - It made me itch
I promise I won't touch a strand of your hair. Good. So, B613. How are they financed and where does the money go? To protect my agency from opponents and accountants, it was operated in hiding.
I didn't come for my country, Mr. President. Nor for you. I'm doing this for me. This man has ruined my life. It's my turn to ruin his. If you lose contact, tune into this station. It will give you the location for the meeting, if you have one.
BRING IT ON. Where's Hwatab? I alerted them to an urgent problem inside the Sector so that you and I could clear things up without any distractions. You were going to tell them what you saw in the black box, weren't you? Where is it?
- Do you still remember me? - The maid, not the housekeeper. - I've come to see the carp. - They'll have to hold on. If Mr. Monroe is convicted, the government will come and sell the house and everything in it, right?
Maybe we've gone too far. We're in this together. You and me against the world, right? How many times have we asked for the chance to do something incredible? Well, here it is.
And when you have nothing, nothing will stop you from doing what you are capable of doing. That's the second seal! No! War will not come to Sleepy Hollow. It's always been here, waiting.
Neighbors described the brutal scene as, and I quote, "a bloodbath." Corey Bachman, the couple's eight-year-old son, is still missing. This recent discovery, the murder of Troy Miller and the abduction of Bonnie Lipton, together with the death of Eudora Tattler, bring to four the number of shocking murders that have terrorized the local residents of our quiet village in the past two weeks. Although the police have yet to confirm the link, the grim fact that a similar weapon was used in all four murders leads this reporter to conclude that it is a single maniac who is victimizing the inhabitants of Jupiter. We can only hope that when justice is done, it will be swift and final.
When? At 10:07. I wrote it down. I write everything down. And at 10:12pm, she left.
Hi. I have an order for Kevin and Donna Russell? I'm Donna. I'm also looking for a lost package. Wouldn't it have been left in your driveway?
- Your what? - Your son. You know your son? The one I killed myself to keep him safe when he was kidnapped. Go to hell. When you needed this team, it did everything...
My friends and family tried to help me, but I wouldn't let them. You don't have to do this, Helena. It's not too late. Yes, it is. Once you let the darkness inside you, it never goes away.
Unless you want to explain to the press how your assistant DA was the brilliant mind behind tonight's hostage crisis. Welcome back. I must say I'm impressed. I thought blackmail was something you were averse to. Someone told me recently that when you let the darkness in, it never goes away.
Oh my God! Am I turning into an Atrian? No, no. You're probably just... developing some Atrian characteristics to protect the baby. Can we stop talking about this thing as if it already existed? - No...
My son and I should do the rest. It won't be long before sunrise. It's taking a while to rise. Don't fear death. If it comes, accept it as if you were lying with a beautiful woman.
When it comes to thieves, it's prevent or eliminate for them. Symmetric's floor is guarded by armed men and panoramic cameras with 360-degree coverage. The Bible will be on the 70th floor, in one of the six protected rooms where they keep the most valuable items. Unfortunately, we don't know which room our item is in. Whichever room it is, it will be protected by a biometric fingerprint reader that detects the fingerprints of the five fingers and the person's body heat.
I'm sorry, I know it must be difficult for you, Agent Neal. What's hard is to see how little loyalty there is. Loyalty? That's an interesting word. What does it mean to you?
Did something happen? - I found the box. - Yes, the box. I hid it so well from you that sometimes even I can't remember where I put it. Sometimes I think you found it and threw it away without telling me, but it always reappears.
In yours, there is that possibility. We can't link you to any of these murders. Parole... The gun wasn't fired. It was in the house.
Brooklyn Bridge? It was the Manhattan Bridge! You know what? It's over. Say goodbye to the ring and everything it stands for.
The guy from the water company said that nothing heavier reaches the pipe. There should be no metal there. They were baffled. So the "Space Cowboy" butchered Fulton and made the pieces float through the pipes? The pipes are designed to tear wood apart before it gets there...
I can't understand this. Look, I want to find out the meaning of your meeting with Moloch as much as you do, but we've been at this for days. It's the way he said it. I touched her soul once. Soon, she'll be mine forever.
That receptacle has been chosen. It was marked. Even when it wasn't in me, I had a... sick feeling that it was coming back. And now it's back. We tried to watch more of the sheriff's recording, but... it ends abruptly.
Just watch your step. We're in the garage. The eaves to the northwest. See the camera? The moment it turns, go to the container 20 meters to the east.
Today we celebrate our resistance, our steadfastness and our collective courage! Every year we use this, our Jubilee, to remember the past. But also to look forward. And it is in this spirit of looking forward that I have an announcement to make, of great importance for this beloved city of ours, Para Vega! Tonight... Our city will become stronger. It will become unified, because tonight, it is with great pleasure that I announce the marriage of Claire Riesen... to William Whele.
Take her away. Don't mistreat her. Arresting Arika could provoke another war. We're already at war. They brought that thing, and it killed Jeep.
It's a machine, Pete. It's not God. It's better than God. The nano is alive. It answers our prayers, it heals.
Look, I'm with you. This thing isn't God, Peter's crazy. But he's also right. - There is a small difference. - Aaron! Forget what he's been doing, and think about what she can do.
Now I'm going to ionize you... It looks worse than it is. What's one electron more or less? Having isolated the sample from any external lead contamination Patterson was finally ready to measure the amount of lead and uranium in the sample and calculate how many years ago it had formed.
Also, I don't know what it means, but she got very excited. And here's why. Yesterday at 7:19pm Ted connected to a server on a private network. I followed the network. It belongs to...
What was the point of a fake shooting? Do you understand what I'm saying? But then we have 20 kilos of pure Colombian cocaine. - Holy shit, yes! We'd already stolen it, it was already ours!
- How? ! - I inhaled skeleton! - Because now the coke is being eaten by Pam! Quick, make the wall rotate again! It kind of rotated by itself!
- Jump! - Just block these people out. Listen to the soft sound of my voice, okay? - I've heard your voice. She says I'm stalling.
I swear he's not. We're all one, you know. You kill another, you kill yourself... you become a ghost. No conversation? I'd rather take your suitcase where it needs to go.
- What's wrong? Leave her alone. She's my friend. Your friend who has an opinion on everything. Were you all right after that thing the other night? She's forgotten, of course.
We were probably this far away, so... I don't know why, but I just tried to pick it up. - Did you take the gun from Moses? - No. We both kept it. And we were fighting, we were fighting on the ground, I was pulling, he was pulling, and suddenly it went off.
If you know where to look, there's a reason for everything. You've dropped your scarf. It gets very cold. I started to think that I could imagine my life, - not as it is, but...
Five years? How about 500? What if I say no? You can't say no. When you walked through that door, it closed behind you.
The acid in black coffee cleans the marker. Never cleaned a whiteboard? Then look at this wall. It's all gray except for this big black stone. It stood out to me, so I went to find Gay. She's a geologist at UNY.
It can't read your thoughts. It has no brain. If you prefer, think of it as an insect, a wasp. When a wasp lands on your arm, you get scared, don't you? You hold your breath and wait for it to fly away.
If you prefer, think of it as an insect, a wasp. When a wasp lands on your arm, you get scared, don't you? You hold your breath and wait for it to fly away. When it doesn't fly away, what do you do? You panic, and then it stings you.
When a wasp lands on your arm, you get scared, don't you? You hold your breath and wait for it to fly away. When it doesn't fly away, what do you do? You panic, and then it stings you. Maybe it stings you because it can smell your fear, or maybe it stings because by panicking, you scare it.
Like the bones of a nine-year-old girl. I think what you'll find is a little more complicated than that, special agent. Come on, Stilinski, you know how this is going to go. It's not knowing that ruins people like Tate. The truth, no matter how bad it is... the truth is always better than not knowing.
I need to know if Yuki has consumed any. If he's poisoned, just treat him. Sorry, but not without knowing the species. I need a sample. It's in the garden.
Scott, you'd better take a look at this. The same wrapping paper we used for the coach's present. Wasn't that a William Barrow thing? A bomb made of nails and screws wrapped up as a birthday present? Where did it explode?
It's not just psychological. How does guilt make you feel, Stiles? - I'm sorry. Sorry? - Guilt. How does it make you feel?
- Earlier? - We have a tradition. The silver bullet. She was making a silver arrowhead. Where is it?
The arrowhead? Down there. I need to see it. Why do I need to see it? Because I have a feeling she won't be there.
Yes. But she didn't kill him. She just broke his mask. It probably went through it. What if the silver is like a poison to them? What if it needs to stay in their bodies?
Did you give her a knife? She didn't like firearms. She must have used the knife on Ibrahim when he caught her and he used it against her. That knife was part of you. You said it kept you alive in Mosul.
I'm going to take Fort Luna and meet up with Jin's warriors. Take this dagger. Take it to Huang. Tell him my father gave it to me. It's been shaped for a decade.
If Fort Luna and the army join forces, Jin's troops will never cross the border. I can lead your troops, open up the rear and surprise the enemy. This will lead them out. But it will take five days to climb these mountains. There's a pass behind Fort Luna. It will take you behind the enemy.
At the time, the Council rejected these ideas. Well, it's not the first time we've been wrong, is it? The creation of the clone army... kept secret from us by Zaifo-Vias was. How it was done, we don't know, but now we have a new piece of the puzzle. Perhaps clarity, it will bring us, yes.
What you felt in the cave... is merely a part of what the Dark Side possesses. So much power. Is there hope that they will defeat the Jedi? There is always hope, my friend. Although it often comes in unexpected forms.
The planet would be habitable again. Meanwhile, most of the rocks launched into space would be orbiting the Sun. Some of them would find the Earth again, re-entering the atmosphere as meteorites, and re-delivering the precious cargo of life to re-fertilize the planet... like Noah's ark. What this means is that life doesn't have to start all over again after every catastrophe. It can pick up where it left off.
Spacecraft carrying passengers at thousands of kilometers per hour can be controlled and communications established with their passengers, because we now know that the Earth's atmosphere can be penetrated. At the speed of light, it takes little more than a second for a radio wave to reach the surface of the Moon. But the size of the front of this expanding wave is much larger than the Moon. Most of the wave passes next to the Moon, but the central part of it is reflected back. After a round trip of approximately two and a half seconds, it reaches our planet.
Being able to adapt our behavior to challenges is as good a definition of intelligence as any. If greater intelligence is the hallmark of our species, then we should use it, just as all other beings use the advantages that set them apart - to help ensure that their offspring thrive, that their heredity is continued, and that the fabric of Nature that sustains us is protected. Human intelligence is imperfect, of course, and newly acquired. The ease with which it can be persuaded, overtaken, or subverted by other innate tendencies, sometimes themselves disguised as the light of reason, is worrying.
For two decades, scientists have wondered what could produce cosmic rays. With you Fritz Zwicky, the most brilliant man you've never heard of. In 1933, he and a colleague discovered that some stars burst into life and stay as bright as their entire galaxies for a few weeks before fading away again. Fritz Zwicky was the first person to understand what had happened. He correctly assumed that this is how a massive star dies: it ejects its entrails into space.
Cut it. We have two liters ready. Good. I want 100 cc. - She's ready.
My boss was in the clean living phase. Of course, 6 months later he went back to rehab. But since that trial, I only get freelance work, which means I need to pay for all the tips, all the equipment... Which reminds me... What do you think of my new spy camera? She seems to like you a lot.
- What if we find him? - We'll cross that bridge. She went through a lot to survive an open embolectomy. - And the infection? - We don't know where she is, and cutting to look could kill her too.
What's next, after my ship and Selima? - Commodore. - What's next? We'll deal with this on dry land. Now we need to go back and attack the treasure fleet before it's lost for good.
The toxicology lab had never seen a drug like it. There were fragments of Scarlett's DNA attached to the molecule. - It was made for her. - Custom-made drug. - What does it do?
Hello. Anyway, let's have this conversation. - What does the drug do? - It's called Vero. It expands the mind, opens the mind to things that exist in the universe that we shouldn't see.
They didn't care about me. Money and influence took away my justice and I wanted them to feel what I felt. They don't know what it's like. Anger. It overwhelms us.
Anger. It dominates us. The rage. We tried to put it aside. I prayed for it. But it consumes us.
You were good to Adilyn. You helped bring Holly back to me and the boys. I don't know if I'm supposed to take any messages from all this crap that's been going on but I'll give you one. Life is too short. Jessica, she's too precious to look back on all the time.
There's a fridge stocked with snacks. The mail is here... nipple clamps on the bedside table with erotic oils and handcuffs. Vibrators and toys are on the wall. I bought this strap-on in Zanzibar in the 19th century. It was one of the first of its kind.
- Yes, I did. - I really did. - That's a wonderful thing. Well done. The headline of the day: With the national persecution of Joe Carroll underway, it brings with it a culture of disturbing behavior.
Can we take a look at your back? I don't know what's going on here, but I don't find it very funny. You don't want us looking at your back because we'd see the scars from the surgery. That's why you're sitting with your back straight, right? The skin is still recovering, and you don't want it to move.
People thought Dr. Charles Vacanti was crazy when he grew what looked like an ear on the back of a lab rat in 1997. I didn't think so myself. Ears are basically cartilage, which means they're difficult to rebuild if they're damaged. They also have a very complicated shape. Dr. Vacanti has developed a method of growing human cartilage in a biodegradable ear-shaped frame. The frame is placed under the subject's skin and dissolves over time, leaving only the cartilage.
As simple as it was, Lestrade solved the case on his own. The conspiracy he described is obviously the product of his very fertile imagination. As for the feather he found, it's a classic case of transference. It fell out of his clothes, not mine.
- I know. I'm sorry. - Don't be. I was investigating the chain of custody of the missing gun. - Where is it?
The mayor manages everything on a short leash. But not you? Stay out of our business. Get treatment for your wife and get going. She's not my wife, she's only 16
Idiot. Watch the camera! You idiot! I don't know... I don't know if she'd want to.
The Arts Committee has never come this far and it's all thanks to you. Guys, when I came to this school six months ago, I never thought I'd be welcomed... Excuse me, is this the Chemistry Lab? Because I'm looking for an effusive reaction. And here it is.
The "League of Shadows" disagreed and sent him away. But you didn't need them, did you? They're a bunch of wimps. I sent an email to Painless telling them what I'd done and asking for another mission. I waited for a reply, but it never came.
- Are you afraid of the hurricane? But there are hurricane controllers here. Don't you know them? These are them. Just point them at the storm and it can't hurt us.
I was working and... I blacked out. I forgot to set the alarm. And now my little girl... My family is cursed. "Some people get caught in the path of the storm, and there's nothing they can do but wait for it to pass.
Good morning, sunshine. Are you telling me you knew when the sun would rise? Did you read the stars or something? You installed a weather app for me. It also predicts a 15% chance of rain.
Isn't it worth the risk to trust me? I miss what I left behind, but somehow being here has made me more true to myself. It's clarified what I believe in. I wonder what my other life was like. How it unfolds without me.
In the final season of ARROW... This city still needs saving. - Not by the Hood. - It needs a hero.
There are no more Jews. There's something I need to tell you. - We are building a weapon. It's not like any other weapon the world has ever known. It draws its energy from a chain reaction of fast neutrons.
But I assume that the other day... the extra perks... come with favors, right? What do you want? You don't really want to be a mother, do you? I beg your pardon? We're not saying that your father caused the fertility crisis. But we believe he knew it was coming.
Mark, we think your father was researching the effects of global overpopulation and that his experiments may be linked to the fertility crisis. Are you saying that he was responsible for all this? All we know is that the company he worked for belonged to the CIA, and that the place where the plane crash happened... Kabul... was ground zero for the crisis. We don't want to say that your father caused the fertility crisis, but we believe that he knew it was coming.
Previously in Continuum... Two of me. - Two of her? - Yes. You fight a disease when it's still treatable.
- Give me a minute, darling. - I'll be right inside. - I'll be right in. I left my bag here. Do you mind if I get it? What does it look like?
Do you understand me? Most of you know me. My name is Jack Davis, U.S. Secretary of Defense. ONE YEAR AFTER THE DELETION You are here because you are veterans and chosen ones. A historian once said, "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it itself is destroyed from within."
You must know that I was the woman who tamed the eagle. Well, everybody out. Hello. The prey believes that if it stays still, it won't be seen. But in fact, it moves.
She's getting divorced and wanted to meet up for a few drinks. You have to go to rehab. I understand, but I don't have to. I mean, I've got this under control. What I need is help with this drunk driving charge, if it goes through, I won't be able to get into the Chicago Fire Department.
I'm going to take a walk and try to clear my head. I'll see you at the hotel and we'll decide what to do. Let's be poor. Hi, I'd like to talk to you about a company called Pied Piper. What does it do?
You! We haven't finished yet... It's a bit late, but I know why "Evil" wants the stone! You too, huh? The question is, where is it?
It's going to be our base. We're going to show you some images and all you have to do is look at them. Wilson, are you ready? This is the amygdala, right? It lights up with negative emotions, like fear, anger, hatred.
I went one way when I should have gone the other. - What? - He took a bullet. That's all right. She went straight through.
- Of course! Of course! OK, so the kitchen prepared two room service meals yesterday, both curry chicken. And Sylvaine took one to Judith Musgrove in her room, and the other she delivered to Emma Redding. Sylvaine doesn't think anyone could have altered the food while she was delivering it, and as at least one other guest had the same meal, it couldn't have been tampered with in the kitchen.
The lucky bat will help us with that. It's not all up to the player. This relief in pressure seems to help you play better. Sally suspects that the belief in luck does more than refine confidence... It changes perception.
They are studying the inner workings of several different types of cells. We have constructed a strain of E. Coli that has two colors. Both colored proteins are produced in very similar genes... The cell can't really tell the difference. If it binds to one of them, it has to bind to the other as well.
The other one quintillion minus one will be dead. So the reality and non-reality of multiple Max Tegmarks can remain uncertain. This idea that reality is bigger than we think and that when you lose at roulette, there will be another version of you that wins is an idea that sounds very strange. But who are we humans to tell the universe how to behave? You know, my job as a physicist is not to try to impose my prejudices on reality, but to look carefully at reality and try to understand how it really behaves.
Just let her finish her mission. The ship is frightened, she brings me back to life. I can live. We can live. She knows we can stop her.
Kaziri can bring me back. Just let her finish her mission. The ship is scared, she'll bring me back to life. I can live. We can live. She knows we can stop her.
That's not all that matters. What kind of friends are we talking about? Colleagues at work, on the Internet... Friends with benefits? Friends who throw our garbage away without complaint, or our best friend? Common sense tells us that the more you cultivate a friendship, the deeper it grows.
What kind of friends are we talking about? Colleagues from work, the Internet... Friends with benefits? Friends who throw our garbage away without complaint, or our best friend? Common sense tells us that the more you cultivate a friendship, the deeper it grows. On the other hand, if you neglect it, it tends to disappear. Unless your friend happens to be family.
So that's why I had to keep the recording. The money was in a trust fund. DK wouldn't have access to it until he was 21. That's why Logan needed to act quickly. You were going to hand him the tape and it would be destroyed, just like the truth.
Launch. We're sinking. I'm not sure. No, I can feel it. As the bow fills with water, it tilts.
And that Darkness, have you seen it? Has anyone seen it? Anyone who dares to look is taken. And those who are taken die. How convenient. So nobody knows what it looks like, or if it even exists.
You don't want to live in the suburbs, do you? You know what, though? Forget the house. You're right. It's too big for us, and commuting would probably be too stressful.
- Who's there? - A message, Your Excellency. Put it under the door. What are you doing? What does it say?
- A message, Your Excellency. Put it under the door. What are you doing? What does it say? What does it say?
I broke up with him last night to be with Vincent, and... You broke up last night? Can you stop repeating everything? Vincent needs the jewel. - Where is it?
- So this is where we part company. Aren't you coming? I came here to deactivate the Cortex. You have your freedom, honor it. It won't be given to you so easily again.
I had a chat with him yesterday. He made it clear that if you tried to unmask him, there would be consequences. He threatened us. He said there was a letter. In the event of his death or arrest, it would be sent to certain people at Le Milieu.
Take a break, will you? Do me a favor. What's that? Please, for once in your life, pretend you're a human being, and face the situation as it is.
What is she thinking? Tell us to hide and then send us a new number? - There's no time. - This is a life. Finch would tell us to save it. Then tell your complicated boss that if she wants me out of harm's way, I need more than just numbers.
I think it's the R.E.O. Speedwagon. I know that. It's just a simple chord. Can't you play it? I asked for this song because it reminds me of the first day I brought Hope home.
You don't understand. Then tell me. This thing has been controlling every step I take. You can't fight it. It knows everything.
Okay, we'll try. We'll try. His hand. Bri, look. What's wrong with it?
You and Olson... You gave us a purpose. Is there any way to stop this thing? I'm trying to. I'm the one who allowed it to come alive.
Contaminator found. Contaminator found. Because of the instability, I can only contain a few Pym particles at a time with this thing. Okay, here's the information. The Hulk crushed a Pym particle, it multiplied.
He was treated for alcoholism two years after leaving the army. One can assume it was a permanent problem. The Association has several programs for veterans, Duck. Why was Turpin living on the streets? I recently read a survey, it estimates that on any given night, between 50 and 60 thousand men and women who have served, sleep on the streets or in shelters.
Do you feel better now? Is the pain gone? I'm sorry? No, it hasn't. It never will.
Max, I have a surprise and she's after you.
In November 2012, an army bomb squad recovered an identical bomb buried next to it on the same road leading to Kandahar. That bomb failed to detonate; it was recovered intact and then sent to Quantico for analysis. E? As it was not involved in any fatal attack, it remained pending, awaiting analysis until now.
No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Thank you. What's wrong? This ball. What's wrong with it?
The Diógenes branch in New York was their idea. They wanted a gateway into the American economy, and now they have one. -You know... I wish she'd taken you. The leukemia. I wish it had rotted you to the bone.
Now our forest is young, it still needs a lot of water. But in 10, 15 years' time, when all this growth has stabilized, I'm sure we'll have a beautiful waterfall here again. We can see many paths! Hundreds of them! That's where the cows go. Each cow's footstep, when it touches the earth, in a small perimeter, it compacts 200 or 250 kilos in a single footprint.
But everything depends on the tree. Our water depends on the tree, our oxygen depends on the tree... It's a home for many. Ants, small insects, cicadas... It feels good to hold on to a tree you've planted. And here it is, well established, very solid...
- They want to scare us. This is the worst thing to think about. Did the rash show up on a doctor? No, that's good. It doesn't pass through the air.
- Yes, let's find them, put them in a cell together, and find out what happened in the past. We have to do that. For Melanie. É. When you touch the Dome, does it show you things?
Like visions, I guess. You did? You said you died and we accepted it. It's group spirit. But what if she shows me something terrible?
He hardly knew her. - Maybe this has something to do with it? - The Four Hands. Pauline talked about several things. Pink stars, a Dome that would hold us and the Four Hands who would be the protectors. She used to say: "Four Hands will protect the Dome, and without them, it will fall".
- You work for BCD? - Yes. They're looking for someone inside the Pentagon. When will the story break? - It will be reported.
They still have a version of this, but this one is better. - Look... - No, you look. We're all a bit tired of being treated like we're not Neal Sampat. I like my app and it makes us money, both of which are more than I can say for your 10 o'clock news.
No, it's not Christmas yet. Let's just take a funny picture. And I'm in it because I'm part of this... My stocking? ! Take it easy. She's not in the picture and neither are you.
We know that he replaced his mother, but he's taken things in his stride ever since. Okay, you're embarrassing me now. Dad, good to see you. I see you're still committed to the monkey body. The monkey revolt is coming, Hayley, and I'll be ready when it does.
He's also Johnny's agent, which puts him at the top of our list. Listen, I'm sorry about the gun ban. E-Dawg, you know I hate to make Mr. Parker give up his gun. I can't allow it on Major Crimes. I'm sorry, AK. What you'll be sorry for is if it disappears.
No. I thought I could sort it all out myself. When Annabel relented and said she wanted to recant about the photo and the story, I got Matt to set up some emails between Claridge's and Hoda Amin. We had to protect the story. If it fell apart, I knew it would destroy our careers.
I'm very sorry. There are questions that have to be asked, however impolite they may be. And you have to be honest. If you lie... She'll know.
It wasn't always in this state of disrepair. - It went into decline. - Yes. The story of its decline. She'd like to hear it from you.
But if Bates convinced Willis that he was in York that day... - It might not be over. - Why is that? The sergeant is nice, but he's not very bright. According to Mr. Carson, Mr. Bates told the Sergeant that he visited a shoe shop when it was opening.
But beyond the less pure motives I may harbor... Beyond my ego, even my legacy, deep in my heart, I believe that Daniel Holden killed that girl. I believe it as strongly now as I did 20 years ago. And I also have to believe, Ted, that somewhere deep in your heart, you've at least considered this idea. You can't just ignore it, Ted, or hope that it will somehow go away.
- A random card? Charlie, I don't see the point of that. It's from your sister. My sister wrote you a letter? She's an atheist, Charlie. It's not for me, Daniel.
He was no good. I know you've always considered him the genius behind Godfrey Industries because that's the history of the company. I didn't want to spoil your fantasy. JR's only talent was recognizing the talent of others. He met a brilliant medical student in Greenwich Village, in a sauna, and an even more brilliant woman on the stage in London. Pryce and I made this company what it is.
We'll have a hearing tonight, so why aren't you working? ! What's wrong? What do you want from me? The power of the cape comes from what's inside it. But he had to feed her and she was only hungry for one thing.
What did you think you'd get out of this sabotage? People will wake up. People like these devices. All this rebellion of yours is pointless. Not if it inspires someone to resist what you're doing.
It's time to meet your enemy. It's time to know your enemy. Satan is black and white, your life is caught in his vise. Color is his weapon of choice, with Death singing the loudest. Colors play a game of chance, the rules are divisive. Humanity is in its cage, it burns and disintegrates.
I still want that for you. Do you have peace, Tawney? Sometimes. And do you think that peace comes from God? I know it doesn't come from ourselves.
- What's that? - I'm exercising your memory. Daniel, you don't have to put up with any of this. No, no. That's the thing about memory... it's malleable.
You left me. I let you say what you wanted to say, Daniel. I let you get it off your chest. Perhaps the details were hazy, but the truth was clear as day. It remains the same.
Or a woman. Did the Khan listen to our advice? Our Khan has a will of his own. It's a will that could be broken if he doesn't act. We will support and strengthen his will, whatever it may be.
I chose you. I chose you and the children. And while you stand on your balcony, looking at the life you're leaving behind... I need a drink. You have to accept that she's gone. You're lost. Just like you.
I know you don't entirely agree with the project. But in less than 72 hours, the world's second nuclear reactor will begin operating. Do you want to watch history happen? Or do you want to be part of it? So, it was our second wedding anniversary, and Frank was clutching this brown box like it was the Ark of the Covenant.
Thank you. Gentlemen, here's how it's going to be. The treasury will replace the casino. Nice irony. A culture's largest building reflects what it values most.
Remember, don't hold your breath when the nano-dimensioner is activated. You'll feel the need to do so, but keep breathing normally during the miniaturization process. - Why? - Have you ever heated a lasagna in the microwave without piercing the film? - Does it explode?
How would it be possible to detect it? Or even sense it? Except in those moments when, for no apparent reason, we choose to speak aloud. What would such a creature want? What would it do?
Sometimes you put it down, turn around a bit and when you come back, it's gone? Everyone does that. Yes, everyone. - Who turned off your TV? - She does that.
Everyone does that. Yes. Everyone. - Who turned off your TV? - She does that. She just turns it off.
At last, I've caught up with these irreducibles! After years of humiliation, four buildings and a few matrons, they've come to an end. Caesar! Our victory in Gaul is total! No! It will only be total. When there's not a trace of that ridiculous village left.
He has almost 30 years of covert operations in the service of this country, ma'am. - This sounds like a sermon. - No, ma'am. - But the truth is... - The truth, Charleston, is whatever we want it to be. It's not in the facts, it's in the words.
Something happened almost two centuries ago. And I was transformed. My life is like yours... Except for one small difference. It never ends.
Call the emergency services! There are many things we can do to prevent death... Exercise, eat well, wear sunscreen. And even if you try to negotiate with death, make no mistake. It will find you.
Yes, I've already found him. He's dead. Good night, detective. Good night, Henry. As sad and terrible as death can be, it forces us to appreciate every moment, because the truth is:
I've taken an optical reading of what's down there. The Moon is not disintegrating. Or rather, it's fracturing and we have about an hour and a half. But that's not the problem. It's not infested.
I need you to help us follow him. As much as I'd like to help, I'm dealing with a more urgent matter. What's more important than your own brother? My life? Davina had Mikael on a magic leash and it broke.
What about the horrible, horrible death you have in front of you? Is that what you really want, now that you've admitted to yourself who they really are? Tituba... Do you know what the greatest pleasure in the world is? It's when the pain is over. And it will end.
Master Polo is among them. I taught you to merge with all attacks. Absorb your opponent. - When you pour water into a container... - It becomes the container.
The Byamba will travel with a golden tablet. All the gates will open. Why are you telling me this? If Lord Khan dies while you're away, your only defender will die. See this tragedy for what it is.
I'm not a witch! I'm not you. It's time to meet your creator. Many say that the soul remains for some time very close to where the body is. It sees, hears and feels everything that is happening.
The only reason he's carrying a suitcase like that is to access the bank's data remotely. I was waiting for you to say that. So, tell me about Natasha's key. It's a USB stick with an encrypted code. Plugged into the laptop, it installs a program that allows us to access and track all the bank's data.
- Hello, Auggie. - Hi. Have you got everything you need for your date with Ivan? Everything, except Natasha's key. She's ready.
You said this Remi had a lot of real estate, right? At least 25 properties, which he could be using, one or none of them. We have the kidnap van. The odds are good that wherever the victims are, that van was there. We're still working on the van, and finding out where it was.
I wasn't a good man at the time. I know that. I didn't listen to you, I kept avoiding you. But the Dome showed me a new way of being. And now it has brought you back to me.
A translucent curtain in the shower so no one can hide. A bed that's glued to the floor, so you can't hide. She hadn't felt safe for some time. Look at this room. It's no big deal for a designer. The bed should be here, facing the door. But it's here, because... she sleeps on this side.
Stay here, don't move, okay? Don't move. No... I thought you... Derek went to the house because he thought she'd still be there, right?
How does it feel? Well, it's incredible. The pain from the transplant. Do you still feel it? No. It's gone.
Wait a minute. You make it sound like they have a mind of their own. They do. It's not just physical strength. There's an alien life merging with your human DNA. It wants to control you.
It's not just physical strength. There's an alien life merging with your human DNA. It wants to control you. It does? Yes, it has feelings, desires... stronger than anything you've ever felt.
You're not giving up, not under my watch. Do you hear me, soldier? Do you hear me? Repeat after me: "the fight isn't over until it's over".
Do you hear me? Repeat after me: "the fight isn't over until it's over". Say it. "The fight isn't over until it's over".
"The fight isn't over until it's over". It says that. "The fight isn't over until it's over". That's right. Now repeat it with me: "The fight isn't over until it's over".
It says. "The fight isn't over until it's over". That's right. Now repeat it with me: "The fight isn't over until it's over". The fight isn't over until it's over!
"The fight isn't over until it's over". That's right. Now repeat after me: "The fight isn't over until it's over". The fight isn't over until it's over! It continues! "The fight isn't over until it's over".
That's right. Now repeat after me: "The fight isn't over until it's over". The fight isn't over until it's over! It continues! "The fight isn't over until it's over". "The fight is not over, until it's over".
Keep going! "The fight isn't over until it's over." "The fight isn't over until it's over". "The fight is not over, until it's over." "The fight's not over until it's over!" Be strong, boys, I'm coming. "The fight's not over until it's over."
I think you've won. No. I can do that. After I've said goodbye. "The fight isn't over until it's over"!
I can do that. After I've said goodbye. "The fight isn't over until it's over"! "The fight is not over, until it's over"! "The fight is not over, until it's over"! "The fight is not over, until it's over"!
It's coming to get everyone. And I can't stop thinking about it. Maebh, the forest is communicating. With you and no one else. There's no technology that can hear what it's saying. But you can.
Shana sent them to Jenna. And Alison asked me to pick them up from her room. You broke into her house too? When did you break in? A few minutes before she exploded.
I think she was once quite a sociopath. Alison volunteered for the lie detector. - How do you know that? - She's Mona. After they left, I did some research. Alison wasn't going to put herself at risk unless I believed her story. When you believe a lie, it turns out to be true.
And yes... I think I'm pretty good. He wasn't lying. I hate math. It's useless.
There's a part I didn't tell you. Just before we got into the car... My mother... My adoptive mother, I think... We had a big fight. I don't even remember why it happened, but...
Your mother's name? Did you have any beloved pets? Okay... I know that the bonfire at the beginning of the season is important to you. I also know that it gets out of hand sometimes.
Are you all right? Last night my printer turned itself on. I couldn't turn it off. Not even with the cancel button. - But it kept printing.
No! It's not finished! You can't destroy them. Okay? If this thing is being used to dissiminate the list, it will probably continue until everyone is dead.
Not likely. Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1979. We've only managed to eradicate two viruses in our history. The other was rinderpest. It killed cows.
And apparently I'm not a great banshee either. But I'm trying to help my friends. I don't know if you can hear me. Or... What am I supposed to ask you? But if I've got this thing, it's got to be worth something.
But I'm trying to help my friends. I don't know if you can hear me. Or... What am I supposed to ask you? But if I have this thing, it has to be worth something. It has to help someone.
What are you looking at? The Gem of Power. Do you know this thing? In Asgard, they told us about it in the classroom. It has immeasurable power,
Let's go! Wake up! Where's the moon? It's dead! I became Guardian and then she died.
- And who was he shouting at? - I don't know. There was no one else there. But I think that guy saved my life. That force... What did she want?
- I don't know. There was no one else there. But I think that guy saved my life. That force... What did she want? It seemed like she wanted me... me.
So... Let's do it now. Let's write a story. It can be about a boy or a girl, just like you. It can be as silly or as scary as you want it to be.
This morning, he stepped on my foot on purpose. Emily, do you know why people do bad things? Because it makes them feel strong. Really, though, you and I are strong, we just keep our strength inside. Sometimes we forget it's there.
I have one of those too. But those stories we tell, which keep us going, sometimes blind us. They take us to dark places, where I could beat up a good man just for the fun of it. The people who love me pulled me back from that precipice. Cole, once you touch that darkness, it never goes away.
- Music. - That's right. Music. The reactor will be fully operational in a day's time. We've given you a list of 22 serious risks to resolve before we go any further. And the Army intends to give your list the consideration it deserves. - When?
What is your third condition? More detonators won't change the laws of physics. Well, we've never let the laws of physics get in our way before. We've checked the British calculations several times. It shows that the only problem with implosion is that it's completely impossible.
Seventeen-year-old Christopher Davis pulled over to the side of a deserted road near Scape Ore Swamp to change a tire. Just as he finished, he heard a noise behind him. He saw a strange creature, about two meters tall, with glowing red eyes, running straight at him. Davis took off but the creature caught up with the car and jumped onto the roof. Swerving to get rid of the creature, he saw that it had three fingers and green skin.
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything.
Did you push her in that direction? No. She went to school with you, son. She loves this city. She just wants to live.
They burned our crops. We tried to fight back. Anwar had a rifle to scare them off. And then, one night, they set fire to the house. It burned down, and I was left with this.
I thought you were a bad man until you said you were going to drive. You said it was a funny story. I like this scar. Do you want to know why? It tells me never to feel like a victim.
They're older than I remember them. Does that mean they're going to die soon? Not necessarily. Death is... uncertain. It comes when it comes.
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything.
And just as God revealed the Ten Commandments to Moses, God revealed to Hermes the secret knowledge of how nature works and that, with the right instruments and mental tools, you can discover what God was essentially thinking by reading the world. According to legend, John Dee used this knowledge of the natural and supernatural worlds to predict the storm that would end up destroying the Spanish Armada. The story goes that John Dee told Queen Elizabeth not to worry, as the Spanish Armada would be destroyed by a storm. And then, when it happened, he conformed his knowledge of the world and what is in it.
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you at all hours every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything.
I'm being buffeted by the winds of enmity and tossed about on the tidal waves of cruel fate. Yet I, a captain, am no longer able to command my ship, my squadron, my usual helm, my office. I've worked most of my time on Earth overcoming all prejudice and fighting for the position I have. And now I feel like it's slipping out of my grasp.
Thank you, sir. And in view of that revealing fact, I suggest a one-hour recess. Why did you admit that? Because it's the truth. This is Washington. The truth is what you need it to be.
-Come on. It's Christmas. Let's toast your new home. Maybe I should mention something. Say, your new home, but it's not just mine.
The house was never sold. - Who was he? - Marcello Panneti. Nice guy, didn't say much. I can't free the soul without knowing its name... But I can take you to a place where it can't kill.
That explains how he was able to surprise my agent. Langer knows the security protocols. We found the van. We follow it to a warehouse in Baltimore. She goes in, but never comes out.
And if you kill me, they'll see. This isn't her. Do you know a plant called votura? It grows in South America. Precisely, in Corto Maltese, it makes the individual very susceptible to suggestions while he has no memory of his actions.
But she was the only person I could turn to. It never occurred to me that they would find out and go after her, too. Sergei and his group want me dead because I refused to work for them. Russia has police. Sergei said she wouldn't help me.
Let me feel the Spirit! Let me feel the Spirit. Please! My leg! It's back!
I can't talk about that. But I can talk about his magic. It's very powerful. All this healing energy has to come from somewhere. If history tells us anything, then... it's already taking its toll right here on earth.
You feel helpless. You can't fight it. Everything becomes a question of getting to the other side, shrinking your world into a tiny dot. And when that wave is gone, you feel relief. Just for a moment, until it comes back to remind you.
It's not a scam. All right? Just give me the vinyl and I'll give her whatever she wants. She wants her soul. And she's not yours.
A mutation in RAF1, right here. This orange bastard caused Robbie's cardiomyopathy. RAF1. Since when? She was isolated a month ago by a doctor in Australia. And the screening panel was updated last week.
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you at all hours, every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything.
And again, I'm sorry to hear about your health problems. - Let me know if there's anything I can do. - Well, there is one thing. We go back to the lease amendment, page 24, paragraph 18 C. It requires your physical presence on the premises, Diane.
He seemed like someone you could trust. But he broke that trust. One afternoon, I forgot my backpack. There's no one here except you and me, man. There it is!
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you at all hours, every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything.
What the hell is going on? (sighs) I don't know what to do, guys. The cookie store is going under. If it fails, we're screwed.
I had an experience in that house. What experience? It's true. What the legend says is true. It is haunted by the dead and those who have lived there have experienced it.
No! Watch out. - Was he living in the house? - Yes. He lived in it for years. I think it was actually haunted.
What? Can you tell me where you were last night? I was at home with Kenneth. Are you accusing me of killing that bitch? She was 15 years old.
Look, he's... he's... frozen. I think I forgot to tell you everything that happened while you were gone. Did Ingrid do this? To be fair, it's the only good thing she's done since she came out of that urn. Look. There she is.
Anywhere in Washington? Kubiak couldn't find it. He looked everywhere. I broke my head and I'm in the same boat. I have no idea where she could have put it.
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything.

Yes, I'm still ill. Yes, I'm going to work on a Saturday. No, this isn't wine, it's medicine... My stupid brother caught the flu in Mexico on his honeymoon and it's going around the whole family.
- The bullet. It's still in Cooper's head. We requested it at the trial to prove it didn't come from my gun. But they denied it. They said it was too dangerous. Removing it from the brain would put the President's life at risk, so it stayed there.
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything. Violent crimes involving normal people.
Its plans are hundreds or thousands of steps beyond what we imagined. The Machine will protect us. Even if I have created a benevolent machine, if there is such a thing, don't forget that the supposedly friendly Artificial Intelligence is just as dangerous as the hostile one. Your machine has always seemed warm and indistinct to me. Have you forgotten that it asked us to kill a congressman?
Human nature has unleashed itself in all its failed glory. The Samaritan has revealed his secrets, and now they're killing each other. Harold Finch's machine must learn that humanity requires supervision, not pampering. Why isn't their machine responding, sir? It will.
When Michael confronts Fredo about his disloyalty, he says: "I know it was you, Fredo". "You broke my heart, you broke my heart." He delivers his accusation right into Fredo's ear. It's just between the two of them. Despite Michael's anger, he hides it from his community so that it can be preserved.
Don't worry, Neal won't be staying with us. Who's staying with him? You. We're not afraid of your magic, Emma. It's what will allow you to defeat the Snow Queen.
My goal is the same as yours, to rid the world of evil. We only differ in our definition of evil. Looks like we caught a big one, Flippy. Hyperion didn't use the citadel to its full capacity. It's actually a warship.
Better? No. The armor is perfectly functional, sir. But she doesn't recognize your body signature. She thinks there's someone else in the armor.
- Do you mind if we investigate? - Please do. Be my guest. Physical pain has a function. It teaches us.
Make yourself at home. Physical pain has a function. It teaches us. Don't you agree, doctor? It teaches us to protect ourselves.
This is spectacular. The Peabody Essex Museum hosted an exhibition by Iris... PEABODY ESSEX MUSEUM CURATOR OF EXHIBITIONS AND RESEARCH "The Rare Bird of Fashion" in... 2009. And then when the exhibition came to the museum, we invited Iris and Carl, of course, to take part in the installation. Then I learned that Peabody had a fashion collection, but it ended, more or less, at the same time as mine began.
I found a way for you to stay alive without breathing. All right? Send it down! Owen, there's a machine upstairs. It'll take your blood, add oxygen, and send it back to you, okay?
Its walls have never been breached. You forget that I know the city better than anyone. Why do you think you'll succeed where many have failed? In the royal vault, there is a statue called Palladium. Atlantis will not fall as long as she is on the walls.
In the royal vault, there is a statue called Palladium. Atlantis won't fall as long as she's on the walls. - Do you believe that? - I've held it in my hands. It carries the power of the gods.
Release your anger. I'm going to teach you what your master couldn't. You have nothing to teach me. The darkness is too great in you, orphan. It's swallowing you up. Right now.
Listen, I'm going to talk to him again. No. You can't do that. You can't take the deal. Four months ago, my life was just my life, and now I don't know what it is.
Bonnie and I came here every day. It was the closest thing I had to an imagination of her. And I needed every memory I could get. It's funny. I had so many good memories of this house, and after just one bad day, I burned it all down. I just couldn't bear to see her again. I can't believe she's gone.
Roger Penrose, from Oxford University, and Stuart Hameroff, from the University of Arizona, believe that quantum particles in the brain and nervous system could contain what we call consciousness. The theory is that perhaps there is in fact a physical structure in the brain that we call microtubules, and they are small enough for all the strange effects of quantum mechanics to occur. These quantum mechanical effects could be what gives rise to consciousness. However, even after death, this information is not lost. It still continues as a state of quantum mechanics. And maybe that's what brings consciousness to life.
And then, finally, Mahatma Gandhi got involved in the story. He did an investigation and analyzed it for himself. He said he was convinced that she was the reincarnation of the other woman. Could Lugdi have died and been reincarnated as Shanti Devi? The faithful Hindu believes that reincarnation, a spiritual resurrection in which the soul is reborn in a new body, happens to almost everyone after death. The person's soul ascends and they need to be reborn in something else, in another form of life.
Things got stormy at times. Because I wanted the Malibu house, and he wouldn't give it to me. That house has sentimental value for me. Along with the monetary value. I mean, after 20 years, it's worth... 8 million dollars.
Uh... Yes. Yes, because it's like... "oh, shit, I'm in someone else's house" "can I do this, can I do that?" And that card, it takes away that worry. You try to open a door and it won't open. No problem, it's because you don't have access.
We'll see each other again. Not as a soldier. You won't even recognize me. Be careful... with your life. Is it precious to you?
Leland. What happened? We fixed the ... steel grid for a new antenna. When, when it finally worked ...
I guarantee that those days will come again. I will light the great forges of the dwarves and riches will flow once more, from the heart of Erebor Death, that is what awaits us. Dragon fire and ruin. If you wake the beast, it will destroy us all.
His mind is destroyed. He lives in a world apart. Many moons ago, a boy found two white men in the desert. He brought them to his village to be healed. When they found silver in the river. They asked the boy where it had come from.
Here. I told him. No talent. The records indicate that you are a very intelligent man. As such, I expected you to see and understand the situation as it is.
In my eyes, you're a hero. - Thank you for that. - But there's a catch. An uncomfortable piece of evidence has come to light. If it becomes known, we're screwed.
The turning point for me was Kennedy's assassination. I was working non-stop and I was sick. I felt terrible. We found out later that when the heavy suits we were wearing were dry-cleaned, they used a solution of tetrachloride. I would sweat and it would be absorbed into my bloodstream and shut down my kidneys.
It's incredible. You're accessing the genetic operating system of a living organism. Yes. Can you let go of my plant? It doesn't like it.
- No? No. - No. This is the footage of the search that the police handed over to the defense... just before Miss Stubbs' trial. - Have you seen this footage, Mr. Duncan? - I'm aware that it exists.
He put the gun to my throat. Then he put it between my legs... and pushed it into me. I felt the cold steel as he put it in and took it out. Do you remember anything about that gun? What did it look like?
- Benny, it's me, Leo. - It is? I want to withdraw the bet, the bet on Harvard? Leo, I didn't place the bet. It doesn't exist.
Pull it. Pull it. Now I've stood in its shadow And watched it grow And it sways and guides me
Stay still. Hold still. Let me see. Let me see your tongue. There it is.
The same goes for the Croats and the Nazis in the Second World War. The truth is that you can go back 1,000 years and not know how a conflict really started. But we all know how it ends. Do you think you're the only one who lost something in the war? It destroyed me.
- It was us! - That's right. I mean, our generation may have created this whole thing, but the torch is in your hands now. So, really only one thing to do. Bring home the crown where it belongs.
I'll ask you again, friend. - Where's the Cup? - I don't know. We all want the same thing, Lukey, don't we? The difference is, I think you know where it is.
And Reverend Stephens, I believe. Yes, sir. Mrs. Lincoln. How dare you enter the house of the Lord? My family owns the land on which it was built.
My stepmother always wants to go out with us, even bribing me with wine coolers. It's pathetic. This is a really good price for 70 hectares. We closed on this house eight months ago. It's only now that it's come on the market.
We closed this house eight months ago. It's only now that it's on the market. That's sad. It's not so sad. It had to go to someone.
Right? Do what? Would you? I went to a house, and it wasn't a house. It has big stairs and a huge, big hall.
I don't care what you show me. She deserved to die. Hey. I went to a house, and it wasn't a house. It has big stairs and a huge, big hall.
How are you going to kill the Wicked Witch? I just have to steal her magic wand. Once I've destroyed it, it'll be over. Why don't you use this? - She's got a knife!
- Yes. Where's the sword? What does this mean? It means that your mission is just beginning. - You know where it is, don't you?
Your father ruined my life and now I'm going to ruin his. By killing you. How beautiful. You hold on to your grandfather's sword until the end. But now it's coming back to me.
I don't know what you're doing. Just wait. Return, Benvolio, and face your death. Tybalt, just keep the peace. Put up your sword or she'll separate you from me.
"We leave something of ourselves behind "when we leave a place, "we remain there even though we have gone. "And there are things in us that we will only find there again when we return. "We travel to find ourselves when we go to a place "where we have lived a part of our life, "however brief it may have been.
No, it's not all right. But... I have something for you. This is 160 gigs. I'm going to download some songs. She only turns 12 once.
I'll check it out. I'll take a look at that. We'll be fine. Let's hide somewhere and wait. What's that for? To stop the infection before it progresses.
Son, you're dreaming. I'm not going to lend you 500 dollars on a whim, let alone 5,000. And, given the state of your mother's mortgage, I don't think this is the time to get into more debt, do you? You can't live life as if she still owes you a living, Andrew.
The bastard's going to take all my stuff. We made something for you too. How's the new board? Tearing up, yeah? Dude, she says.
- Mom, what's happening? Foje, little one! Come here! My life is full of people like Harlo Landerson. It's not that I don't like my face as it is...
So we have an agreement. Your gesture is deeply appreciated, and I'm sure Mr. Graham will come well equipped. Careful. This suitcase was a gift from the Governor of Virginia. Well, then, it may well get in the way.
Seven, the human body is not a platter. Eight, animal magnetism. Nine, the animal magnetism of the human body causes the pressure to be oblique, which is why a coffin is made inclined. Ten, if you look at an old grave you'll see that the earth sinks obliquely. Eleven, whereas in a normal hole it sinks in the center because the pressure is exerted from top to bottom.
- Like... - Sorry, a bit more! I was interested in information... Well done, mute! ...and how it spreads through society.
You can trust me. Yes, and it's quiet. There's a new download on the submission platform. Around my twenties, I created a tool called Rubberhose. It hid confidential information under layers and layers of fake data.
we encourage the media to follow the company's members. We will strike back at two more companies for their injustice. We will show no mercy. All right, then, spin the bottle. Whoever it stops is your partner.
Stop it! Please don't! There's a dog's grave around here. It scared the hell out of me when I was a kid. There it is.
Is she okay? Is she okay? Give her some space. Get out of the way, man! There was a sheep and it fell.
No. Something else. Hercules, shut up. What can I use as a substitute? You know, when she comes up in conversation.
She's only mine! She's super tame! Look at a giraffe. Oh, my God! Where do you think it's going?
The worlds are almost aligned. You will be the last of the Damned. Let my life be sacrificed. It is no less than what our people have done, nor what you have done. You will melt into darkness, cursed with this existence until it consumes you.
I... It's all right. It's not that. It's just... The van, it's not broken.
We are, but there's a problem with... earthquakes. What do you mean? We left here and ended up here in 1946. We know how the earth moves. We know where it will be in its orbit around the sun.
But... it happened very quickly. It was there and then it disappeared. You mean it moved? Yes. Yes, it moved.
I just need your signature here, and then we're ready to go. I don't mean to be difficult... and I know you're just trying to help, but this isn't exactly a high school play that I wrote... Well, I understand that. And as much as I want it to be produced, believe me, I'd rather it wasn't staged, than badly staged.
Yes, yes, yes. I'm taking the gun. Yes, a gun will be better. The gun will be better. It's there.
It may not be around curfew. Lon, that's exactly what Harry wanted you to think. I have a note, too. This morning. It's addressed to you.
That's why you're here. What's wrong? I can't face my father. You've got a time bomb. It's going to explode.
No! Fuck you, I know. Go on, tell him, Sarge. An ice stalagmite. Because after you stab it, it melts.
No, we can't! I need to lie down! - I've got a headache! - Hattie, darling. Take an aspirin and it'll go away.
- I hadn't seen him with so much energy for years. Should I let Roger know? - Give your father some time. It looks like another storm is coming. It's going to be strong.
Really? What kind of ideas? The name "Cynthia" has been changed to "Winifred". That's fine. She didn't approve of Dick Van Dyke. The sketch of the Banks house makes her look too opulent.
We share a Celtic soul, you and I. This world... It's just an illusion, my little Ginty. As long as we have that thought, darling, they can't reach us. They can't make us put up with their reality. Cruel as it is.
But crime in Gotham has plummeted since his return. Explain. I'm glad you asked me that, Ted. Imagine the public psyche as a vast, damp membrane. Batman hit that membrane hard and it retreated.
My decision was completely legal. There were certain... circumstances that caught my attention, Nobody is questioning the legality of the decision. It's the headline. When something like this happens, people see controversy, whether it exists or not.
Well, we know that sweating sickness first appeared in Europe and there were several recurrences between 1485 and 1551. We also know that some of the relapses wiped out half the people affected. And each time the disease disappeared. Yes, the orchid turns to ash and releases the plague. Exactly, but when we found the orchid, it was complete, although it had already released the disease in the 15th century, so there must be a way to reconstitute it.
He had to sit on a chair, pull that chain back and get soaked! -Where was the water coming from? -Who knows? ! It came from his belief that it was there!
You're perfect. - You're the perfect wife. But not for me. I've been waiting all my life for the right girl to come along. And it turned out that you weren't her.
We have to keep going. This is my domain. - What magic is that? - It's not magic. It's a machine and it has power.
So it's in the blood. Why aren't humans affected? There was this flu. I had it. It knocked me out for, like, a week.
There was this flu. I had it. It knocked me out for, like, a week. Right. Yes, it knocks humans out, but it knocks vampires out.
We picked up a cat from the street. Ki... Kibby. We've practically brought her back from the dead. And now she must be walking around, reanimated... with another... with a bunch of other... cats from her past life, which for a cat... is the worst thing she can do.
Sally? It's Trent. That's why you can't see anyone from your past. They would die. There was this flu and if you drink the blood of someone who had it, it kills vampires.
Or am I? You're going to be a werewolf! I'll be quiet. He's serious. The thing that attacked you, it... It wasn't a dog. It was a werewolf.
The natural light was very good. Perfect! What's wrong? You don't like sunlight? Not when I'm blown out and it's hitting me straight in the face... not really.
As you know, this store was opened by my grandfather, it's always been my father's and now I'm going to have to close it.
The people are waiting for a savior. A Messiah. Rebellion in Jerusalem. A Roman eagle rises over the Jews' holy temple. An abomination to their faith. It must be removed.
- My name is Moses. God sent me to set you free. God took us out of Egypt. He promised us this land! Soon it will be ours!
some aspirin in there. Sorry, darling. I couldn't find your toothbrush, but I found... This, look at this, it was on top of the sink. You never know, it might come in handy.
Our Poloshon is a hottie! I doubt it. I'm like a pepper in a hot old frying pan. Sometimes without words you say more than words. She eats you with her eyes.
- That one, much less. That's fine. It's the perfect occasion to start it. You do it like in the school canteen. Squeeze the lemon over the oyster. Usually, if it's nice and fresh, it moves.
Please... I'd like to welcome a new member to our small but... close-knit group. Welcome, Mr. Marcos Vela. Human flesh is the source of life... and youth. It has a surprisingly healing and regenerative effect.
I don't know, maybe he treats me like an equal. - You treat me like a guy. - But you're a girl. And my father taught me how to treat girls. Always be kind and polite, if a girl comes into the room, stand up and take your hat off and if she's a vampire... stake her.
And yet the other half wants to throw caution to the wind. - That's three halves. - You're good. Really good. So, this house of yours, how big is it anyway?
Before I found it. No. Hello, this is Lou. I bought this machine second-hand, and I don't know if it doesn't work or if no one ever calls me.
If you mess with my brother, I'll mess with you. Do you want to see that photo? Come on, I know you do. It's here, somewhere. Here it is.
If they can't find a newspaper, they put it on the Internet. They ruin reputations, they don't care. Sell the company. Take the money and go live your life. My life will never be what I expected it to be.
Kevin Ball. I'm his wife. Hey, Tommy! Do you still have that garage? Yeah, it comes with the house, Frank.
No. I'm so happy. Hey, don't be ashamed. God is ridding you of your pain. Where is it going?
- Are you waiting for Mack? - Yes, I am. - Are you waiting for Brady? - Yeah. Okay. We have to get Lela and Tanner together, get them to find Les' machine and destroy it before it destroys them. No.
Ours or theirs? - Ours! - I think she's talking about us. Did you mean them? What do you mean, them? All of us! The only way out is for us to cooperate, free our friends and destroy that machine before it destroys our world.
You're just like me. You're from the future! What exactly are we talking about? Two thousand kilos of secret concentrated gel. For military use. Let's write history together, brother. This battle isn't over. It has only just begun.
No. It was a Saturday. I was about to cross the road, and I saw this big orange van. I thought it was going to stop. I kept walking and it ran over me and my baby.
- Hello. - Hello, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I'd lose the tie if I were you. And if you're listening to Mason's story, understand that it has little reality.
Let's go! We're waving... Pick up your hand! And here comes the big girl! There she is!
Well? Go on, then! I'll buy it from you, I'll work my ass off. I love the van, you have to give it to me! Yes, but it's got a lot of miles on it!
Most people don't think I'm Muslim. It's only when I go to the mosque and put on a turban that they are surprised. But Jerusalem is full of surprises. Twice a week, in the Jewish Quarter, there is a big celebration. For the kids, it's called a bar mitzvah.

Don't let anyone into your old pants. - I love you. - I love you. Your head isn't here yet. Don't worry, it'll catch up with you.
- You did the right thing. Not everyone would, but you did. I told you, good luck will come when you really need it. Well, I really need it. - Then it will come.
It wasn't supposed to exist, but someone wanted it to. Someone made sure it would survive, because they thought it was important. This is it! It was from this window that I looked out onto the street in my view of the tank. There it is!
Otherwise, you and I would never have met. You said you could help me. I can change your frequency. - Decrease it? - I don't think it can increase much.
Where? I think nature is revealing itself. Just like in the old days. Should we do something? No, she should calm down, the more we stay together.
1 minute. It feels like I'm leaving at the right time. We're just not meant to be together. Incongruity... The indirect representation of a contradiction... between an action or expression and the context in which it occurs.
Otherwise, you and I would never have met. You said you could help me. I can change your frequency. - Lower it? - I don't think it can increase much.
The music... is the reset button. And where is that, exactly? In the soul. And what happens when the music stops? Oh, it can never stop.
So a fault only happens if it actually breaks? Rubbish! The fault is the crack. Well, you could argue that... The fault is the crack, because it's not in the project.
- Dylan. Are you all right? - Better than okay. - I caught the dinosaur. - Where? On the tennis court. The creature's trapped, not that it matters if it decides to get out.
-The thing you threw away? You didn't throw it away, did you? Tell him you threw it away. Yes, I threw it away. But Birch thought she was here.
I have nothing more to say to you. How long has the other woman been missing? I didn't say she was missing. No, but I told you that she was standing next to a woman's body. If you thought she might be the person you're close to, then she must be missing.
Do you think the camera survived? Are you kidding me? That's professional Japanese engineering. That thing was built to walk in the field. It takes a beating and still works.
- Let's go. Come on, let's go. Get down. Why are they trying to kill us? You can have the cure in your arm, and if the General manages to do it his way, no one will ever know it exists.
Green Containment Statute. We contained it, Mr. President. No infected person managed to leave the island. How bad was it? The eastern part of the island was hit, but it had already been evacuated, sir.
Okay, fine, the only reason to steal Kevin's car would be to set him up, but then why stop and steal her backpack? She had something they wanted. Something they were willing to kill for. Of course Tiffany had a backpack. She always had a backpack. But it's not here.
- What about you? - I pushed Derek's mother down the stairs. - Did I? - Yes. They wanted me to radiate mischief and I looked her in the eye, but I don't know if the camera was close because she was a stunt double in a dress.
Light... In the absence of light, contours are lost. Everything is swallowed up by the digested light. That's very, very good. Because music can't be heard. It passes through the eyes, it burns the retina.
Yeah, well, your little family crest here tells a different story, buddy. - This? - Yeah. I got sick last month after this thing appeared on my arm. I thought it was really cool, so I made it my family crest.
I'm only carrying two bullets at the moment. There's room for 17. You take the gun. Put it in. Close the device. And it's ready...
Can you slow down Abbadon? Because if you can, I'll do the rest. What a surprise. Now give me the box. Where is it?
What happened? I'm fine. I got called in for the night shift and had a fight with a board. And you hit the board? Imagine my surprise when she hit me back.
Uh, wait, what's a clone? You're a clone. Are you working undercover? I don't know what you're talking about. Listen to me, soldier, whatever your mission, it can't be more important than mine.
Hold on. There. There's a cruiser up there. And that ship, I think - Yes, it's being loaded with Rhydonium canisters.
If you all want a man to represent you, be my guest. That bitch has a plastic pussy or some shit. Do you want to see her? Please! You praise that shit like it's made of diamonds.
Or rather, his fruit. Thank you, sir. - What's going on? - That's a good question. I'm sorry Leon, but I knew you'd never agree to this meeting or believe it was possible.
What's that? The company car will pick you up. No way. I live five blocks from here. People wait their whole lives to see the assessment come out. You just have to stay in one piece until it comes.
That drug, Flash, shouldn't be available for decades. Are you saying it's from the future? Made with technology from the future. In my day, it was known as Retrievanol. What does it do?
Check him out. I'll check Peter. Dennis Flynn Jr, you are under arrest for attempted distribution of counterfeit items and attempted murder and any other crime you committed with that gun. You planted that gun. I've never seen it in my life before.
- What's going on there? - A slight change in our mission, General. The droids and I were stowaways on that cruiser. Where's R2? I'm sorry to report that he was on that ship when it blew up, sir.
That's why he lost consciousness. He was lucid for a few moments. But he's in trouble. We need to take the pressure off his brain. Okay, where is she?
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you, every hour, every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything.
That way, you'll have time to transfer a bit of money to finance our legal battle. It wouldn't be sportsmanship otherwise. - "Sportsmanship"? - Of course. You don't hunt the fox while it's still in the den.

Just... Is this an ice bullet? I've faced a myriad of problems using a traditional brass and gunpowder coating. What's "a myriad" of problems? One: the heat generated by the ignition of the gunpowder melts the bullet before it leaves the barrel.
Can you call me when he leaves? Sure, no problem. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. We can't repair the carotid under tension. It will break.
We've just eaten with my ex-roommate. The bass player? No, she's not just a bass player. She's the bass player in the best wedding band in the tri-state area. They were scheduled to perform this weekend, but it fell through this morning.
You don't know what you're talking about. But I know you. I care about you. Much more than you realize. I know that you care about the island. That you're worried about what it will become.
A trip? They won't be back for another ten years. Ten years? Use all the trees and kill the mountain. Leave her power and go away, and she'll be reborn.
Give the trees ten years and you can work on them again. Charcoal is like that too. But what if the mountain really is dead? The leaves were so beautiful... It's not dead.
Dad, you said people would be drinking each other's blood. You've been able to watch a VHS copy of "Violent Dawn" 13 times! Stop complaining. What happened to P.E.M? The power only went out in Springfield, and after a few days, it came back on.
- Sue appeared. What's with the word "Selina"? I just saw it. - There she is! - There she is!
Shinjuku... Shinjuku Station... Thank you for traveling with us. When I was little, the sky was closer... much closer. That's why I like the rain, and the smell of heaven it brings.
What's he doing to the Maelstrom? Eating him. This is just another weapon... that the Guardians built to destroy us! Look at that thing, Zox! It's eating the Maelstrom!
According to what he told us, Donovan wasn't even there. New instructions. They argued. Tully pulled out his gun. It went off on its own during the fight.
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you all the time. I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
The only one that ever mattered to me, my friend. From this day forward... I may be destined to die. Where is she? We need to find Ulik's weapon! Unfortunately, it has no trace of science, which prevents my sensors from locating it.
We must take her to the portal. Doom, that's crazy! Even for you! Let history be my judge! She's avoiding the place.
- You've seen them before. - Many of them. On Krypton? In Kandor. The capital. The day she disappeared.
I've done everything. What did you do? You've done nothing. The GCHN1 protein is everywhere! I made sure it was, what more did you want?
It could be broken up and used to feed animals. It saved billions, everyone wanted it. What does protein do? Does it? It doesn't do anything.
I paid attention. Very detailed. Thank you, this is just a simple start Let's move on to the advanced course. For memory to be useful, it has to be as precise and as fast as a camera.
This isn't me. You two... A vision told me about you. It told me that this day would come. But it didn't tell me everything.
Actually, I have a lot of respect for witches. Yes, but why Silas? Why are you so afraid of him? They said that if Silas rises, he'll bring hell to Earth. I like the Earth as it is.
Yes. And then again, hundreds of years later, the night your parents were killed... that night, Claudine was able to move him to a dark realm where he had never been before. How do we stop him? There is a power within the faerie of our bloodline... a secret that has been passed down through the generations. We channel our light into a single ball of energy that, when released, turns into a supernova, killing any vampire it touches.
Concentrate. Now put all your love, all your pain, all your secrets, hopes and dreams into it. And feel how the light holds you. It's like the sun. Sookie, she's more powerful than the sun.
It's not to help you sleep, darling. It's to muffle your crying so I can get back to work. Are you sure you want to do that, darling? I'm sure. If you don't know how to use that wand, it can do nasty things to you.
And they found me. "They?" Believers. People who know that magic is real. And that it doesn't belong in this world. And they're willing to do something about it.
Let's keep going. You know what? Find the cure. Get in. Get out. Where is it?
An ancient volcano, rising above a plateau that is two billion years old. This land has remained unchanged for longer than any other part of Africa. Animals here have taken a long time to find inventive solutions to the challenge of finding water. On the open plains, life must wait for the chance of rain to arrive. When it falls, it has an extraordinary effect.
The families and Freemasons who lived in this house appeared in the future. Now they live in a time to which they do not belong. That's enough, Leopold. You need to listen to me! Hold this knife and it will become part of you and your time.
You'll never convince me to let Tyler go. Well then, I guess I'll never get my chance with Tyler and you'll never get a chance with Caroline. Do you want to know why I like that painting? Well, maybe because it allowed you to look inside my deep, hurting soul. I saw how troubled she really is.
What excites you? What drives you? Death. Death excites me. It... stimulates me.
We're on the same team here. You stabbed my friend! I don't play with witches. You can't use the cure on Silas. That's what it's for!
What else would you use it for? Your friends... Your sister... I'm sorry, boy. That's not what she's for.
But this nursery won't last long. Four weeks from now, and it will be 10 meters underwater. If these chicks can't fly by then, they'll drown. The problem for the young terns is that when they hatch, the lower part of their beak is the same size as the upper part. While they wait for it to grow, they do their best to learn the technique of carving the water.
After 10 days of intensive fishing, the parent returns to take his turn at the nest. But has he arrived too late? He greets his chicks for the first time. The cold Benguela Current has brought the penguins here, but this great coolness is a great disadvantage, because it generates little rain. It can, however, produce moisture in a different way.
The temperature has already risen ten degrees. This lizard avoids roasting in the sand. Only 30 centimeters above the surface, it's significantly cooler. The reverse push technique is certainly the fastest way to keep the ball rolling. But it has a disadvantage.
But there are already victims. Just one more minute and they won't make it. Something has to change. The silver ant is the toughest of all the desert inhabitants. Even so, it can only survive outside at midday for a matter of minutes.
Who hates margarine? - You said there are no wrong answers. - I didn't say that. I don't hate it. It was invented for Napoleon III because armies had to travel and it never spoiled.
If it isn't my old friends, Kilowog and Razer. Calm down, Jordan. Your head is being controlled by that thing. The power of orange energy comes from greed. You have to get rid of that battery before it destroys you.
The power of orange energy comes from greed. You have to get rid of that battery before it destroys you. Never! The orange battery is mine now! It will always be mine!
It's good to get out of the city. It gets my blood flowing. It's not the mountain air. It's the thought that the war will continue. You think you want it to end, but...
The PCA is over. Looks like Morgan isn't the only one retiring today. I still don't know who Morgan is. Let's go. I wasn't in the cabin when it exploded.
Did she say why? Well, she... no, but she mentioned an... an old orchard that had disappeared. Gone? This... this town had been wiped off the earth by a river flood that lasted 100 years. It was then... It was rebuilt.
Tell me... How did you meet this unicorn? I found it. Tell Winchester the crypt is empty. Then you can go back... It's protected against angels.
Why are you doing this? It's strange how normal it seems. What? I feel like I'm 23 and no time has passed. Well, I guess when you have a connection with someone, it never really ends, you know?
What do we do when they betray us? Because they will. We have to trust that we'll be able to see it coming. Remember, April, your weapon chooses you, just as you choose it. I think it chose the tree.
I've said my piece. You'll do as I say. Yes, Father. That Kraang ship is incredibly dangerous. We need to find out what it's doing here.
-Hey, I've seen her. I've seen her. Don't worry, I've seen her. Look, look what happened. You thought you really knew, but she wasn't there.
Can you do it without revealing his name? Because if I'm wrong, and he finds out, it'll be the end of what's left of our relationship. Thanks for lending me your control. You were right. The lurch sensitivity is excellent. It anticipates movements.
You're being watched. The government has a secret system. A machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I designed the machine to find acts of terrorism, but it finds everything.

The world has had a major upgrade since your death, Cage. On-board drones, anti-aircraft countermeasures and fuel tanks that allow you to circumnavigate the globe three times without landing. You can hand over your jacket. I guarantee no one will dare steal it. I can't guarantee that he won't leave on his own.
16, maybe. Let's decide what's right now. Cheers. - What do you think of this world? - It's its own.
You'll do the same. The battery should... If we just make it bigger, then the third... The third verse grows. That way, it stays on top.
No! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! How could you do this? He trusted me!
You've looked hard for these blue creatures. But this hat comes from somewhere new. Yes. Where? Where does it come from?
Fresh food bought locally. Intervention programs to inspire students to think independently. Inspire them to believe that yes, they can do it. There was a time when this port served thousands of boats from all over the world. It can rise again.
I have to go back because of the shark, I can't open it, it's stuck in the chain, it's coming - hurry up! I thought I was going to die, I thought... you're dead, the cage is cracking, it's going to break... it's going to get in, shut up... shut up!
I can't open the chain, it's coming - hurry up! I thought I was going to die, I thought... I thought I was dead, the cage is giving way, it's going to break... he's going to get in, shut up... shut up, he almost got in through the cage.
Lisa? I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm in a cave... I narrowly escaped this shark. Where is he now?
Where's the card? Are you the one with it, kid? The card? The card? There it is.
You've ruined everything! Crap! It goes higher and higher The heart goes higher and higher like a kite It goes higher and higher
He climbs higher and higher The heart climbs higher and higher like a kite It's just a game so to speak My heart flies like a kite while these eyes are sharp like a rope Tied to the kite is the fate of a rope He climbs higher and higher
God willing! Today a series of five explosions rocked three metropolitan cities in northern India. People were transporting the injured to hospital in cars and on motorcycles. That's when we realized the intensity of the explosions. We can only identify the body if it's intact. Not if it's been torn to pieces.
I took it off to have a bath the other day... and I thought I knew where I'd put it. But... It must be in the house, though. So I've been looking for it. Why would you tell Tessa that it was being cleaned then?
Her name is Genevieve. Here, take a look. She was locked up in that mental hospital, Eloise, just outside Detroit, you know? Yeah, yeah, that place closed down what? About 30 years ago? It burned down, didn't it?
Then she just disappeared. You think I'm crazy. No... yes... well, maybe. The hole must be here. I mean... it dropped a few floors, it was very deep.
Viggo and Eruptodon traveling without support? That's strange, isn't it? Yes, Fishlegs, he's up to something. Something happens when you remove an animal from the safety of its home. In principle, it becomes disoriented and... aggressive.
I mean, it's not real, you know? It's not how I imagined it. It hurts my head to see him like this. Well, I'm sorry, Gardner, but the world doesn't always give you exactly what you want. It gave it to me.
A revolution in the livestock industry! And now we have a competition! A local farmer will breed the biggest, most beautiful and special. The ultimate super pig! But who will it be?
I can't tell you anything. Let's try. Xiaoguang, be careful with him. Yes. See if it can be restored.
When General Bhima and Wang Xuance got separated in the snowstorm, Bhima and his men took shelter in a cave. However, there was an avalanche and they were trapped inside. General Bhima must have escaped and drawn the map! If that's true, he must be upstream.
- I'll give him the message. I'll give you the message. - I'll give him a message. - Look, I think I left a coat here. - I haven't seen it. What's it like?
Boom! You're going for a walk. I'll be right back. Where's that smile? There it is.
The only map I've found is 30 years old. So far, the only thing I know about Canaan is where it is. That's all we need to know. Scott, Malia and Lydia are going to Canaan. He says to continue with the plan as long as it doesn't destroy his house.
The lightning strikes the lightning rod, which sends him down into the tunnel. We grab the Ghost Rider, push him into the shelter, and hold him here. Okay. How do you prevent him from riding the lightning out of the tunnels again before you put him in the trap? Well, if the lightning strikes again, he'll only hit the lightning rod.
The closest he could get was "mischief". His mother even called him that... I remember when... When Stiles got his jeep. It belonged to his mother.
- This was a bad idea. - It's not a bad idea. It's a terrible idea. I told you where the transformer is. I told you how it worked.
Your father is a ruthless bastard who always has a sinister plan to hurt everyone around him. What happens when he wakes up and gets out of bed? - Do you have a plan yourself? - I have a plan. - I don't know how sinister it is.
I'd say high. Like 100%. If there's a train station, there's probably also a train. And if there's a train... It's going to the Wild Hunt.
It was good. By chance, we hit a deer. - A what? ! - No...! - And he died?
I couldn't. I know it was guilt I felt. And I was angry. I think I was very angry. Angry at this fucked-up world and how it works.
If you had a superpower, what would you want it for? Well, I'm not really in a situation I want to get out of. What kind of situation are you in, then? I'm in a party situation. And if you could use a superpower right now, what would you want it to do?
Control, did you get this? Yes, we fucking did! Thank you, sir. I'll see if I can remember to turn the cerebris off. In fact, I think it turns itself off after the brain melts.
Which usually means that you feel insecure. Or... Or... What? - Or that I'm in control. Sometimes it's me, sometimes it's him.
Lieutenant! Come in. Don't stand outside. The Shepherdess. The best shelter would have been our mill, but you've seen how it turned out.
I watched it. The financier he's talking about is a Mossad agent. -The whole thing is a charade. -The only charade was the deal itself. It was never going to go ahead.
You may feel nauseous or uncomfortable when you pass through the set of lasers while the cycle is starting. Do not touch the lasers. Enter the event chamber, close the access door and turn the latch to the left. With force. It locks.
Change it? - All of it? - All of it. The money that was supposed to be our treasury on which the viability of this venture was based. If the deal is consummated, it's gone.
And maybe I'm making things worse. No. It's not you. For Aisha, nothing is ever enough. She helped me with this deal, but as soon as it closes, Aisha and I are done.
I won't take a share. Not a single penny. Mr. Carter, a certain amount of money is entrusted to a man. That money disappears. It doesn't matter how. A man is responsible for his money. But it's gone.
I'm trying. Now, you. Repair the flash drive and recover the data. I need my laptop. It has data recovery programs.
Three of them come out of the printed circuit board. - Oh... - What do you mean, "oh"? The vest has a vibration sensor. It goes off if the remote detonator is deactivated.
- I'm very lucky. - Can I have her coat? - Give her your coat. - What coat? No, it matches my dress.
Everyone here is nervous. Hugh has been tireless, I honestly feel relieved. Calvin has grown up very quickly... and this has allowed me to reinforce security with the crew. The box must remain closed and so must the laboratory... regardless of the risk involving Calvin. He's floating.
Calvin just left, he got stuck in my suit. He's bigger! He's trying to get in. Trust your suit. - Can he breathe outside?
He's trying to get in. Trust your suit. - Can he breathe outside? - No. But maybe he can store oxygen for a period of time.
I'll close the valve. It's squeezing. Kat, are you okay? Yes, the suit is very thick. It's going up your leg.
She's drowning. - Brace yourselves, it might not look good. - Roger that. No time for the EVA suit. I'll use the launch. It wasn't designed for that.
-Good. Or not. This has evolved quickly. We've come to discuss a creative project with you. Well, it's about a movie. It's about the complex dynamic... that the three of us have nurtured for years.
Sure, just a minute. Here it is. Where's the poem? Your poem? Didn't you know? It wasn't published this week.
Every breath I take is a prayer for you O beloved Every breath I take is a prayer for you O beloved My heart has become a devotee My heart has become a devotee He has given up everything except you
Take care of Shashi until I get back. After that I'll take better care of her than you ever have. My heart begs for you it unravels thread by thread My heart begs for you it unravels thread by thread Like the fabric that covers a pillar it flutters in the wind
You are a silent melody that penetrates my heart and disappears I'm lost My heart is covered in ashes My heart asks for you It falls apart thread by thread Like the fabric that covers a pillar It flutters in the wind
What are you singing? It's my favorite record, son. O Sahiba Can I see it? Where is it?
Did you? Yes. You taught him that. Okay, lie down. He said you put the stethoscope under the beaker and it amplifies the sound.
You don't have to tell me anything. I'll just say that in some magical way your hair has grown back. I won't ask you how. You obviously don't want to tell me, otherwise you wouldn't have tried to hide it from me. So I'm not going to ask you how it grew back, but please tell me, how did it grow back?
You're not right in the head, Mick. That's why I'm here. To get you back on track. The amulet. Why is it so important?
What inspired you to write it like that? I don't know. I had this old piece of wood. I thought it would be a good prop for the movie. Where is it?
The apology I owe you is for not telling you about the unique circumstances of your conception. You didn't want me to know that you didn't want me. No, you're right, I... I didn't want children. But if there's one thing that my travels aboard the Waverider have taught me, it's that Time sometimes doesn't provide us with what we want. But he... he is adept at giving us what we need.
Anatoly, you said that putting on this hood helps me to direct the darkness inside me. And it worked, I know Kovar's plan. But at what cost? You're a fool to think that a piece of cloth can separate man from monster. Splitting you in two only makes the monster stronger. Until he's stronger than you.
We're finally getting somewhere. Confess. Oliver, we've been betrayed. Viktor... I'm very proud of this casino and what it represents for our country.
- Strange. - What's strange? There's no power in the whole place. Any chance Oliver forgot to pay the bills? Very few, because I moved the place so he could hide and...
Like a hammer. "Who's coming?" I asked. There was no reply. I thought about going back, but curiosity got the better of me. I moved on, but the closer I got, the further he moved away.
It's a loop with no beginning or end. It's just a single infinite cycle. The old story of the chicken and the egg. The remnant is a copy of you. It has your feelings and your memories.
- And why is that? - Because I'm a responsible devil. And I... well, I know how important that kiss was... - for the detective. - For her? I'm sure it had a big impact on her.
- Is she going to be all right? - They found Ashley. She's in hospital. But the poison must be different from that of our first victim. The antidote they made him... he's useless.
What else can you do? Take it easy. This isn't for you. Let the Universe do what it does best, okay? It'll take care of you.
- I don't know. - Answer him. - Seriously... sell me every day before you bring me to work. I... This place, it's not supposed to exist.
- What face? - You know the face. - There is no face. - That's the face. Mom, we have our own equipment, and it works well.
- Do you have it here? - Yes. Right, make a dye and cover a silver bullet with it. Use this spell. It mimics the original carvings.
This is Agent Beatrice Quimby. Thank God for that. There's a bear here. He's the size of a fucking tank! I think he wants my picnic basket!
But she's very upset, saying very strange things. Like what? Like they were attacked by a wolf... An invisible wolf. The girl says that it, you know, comes out of nowhere and that it will come after her next.
But the dog's head nailed to my wall? So we have a vengeance-crazed Hellhound, and it's personal. Nice one. Just when I think this job couldn't get any weirder... It always manages to get weirder.
- Yes. Fabulous. Right, so... So... Kelly and Dagon meet in this place, and then it catches fire. Coincidence?
- Yes. - He's a health inspector. He's trying to shut us down. Why's that? This place is spotless. It's very clean, but our equipment is a bit outdated.
- Yes, what about him? - Okay, right... There was that... There was this spell... That Cass and I were using to... to find him. Yes, but it didn't work. - You needed Gadriel's grace, and he couldn't get enough out of you.
You scared me. What a delicate constitution you must have. That's a lovely ring. Yes. And if it goes missing, I know who to blame.
- Why did you... - Max, listen to me. I had to do it, okay? That deal wasn't with her. It was with a demon.
That completes my exam. Right, Drexel, as much as I enjoy playing doctor with you day after day, I need to get out of here now. I ask you to be patient. Until I turn off the security device, you belong completely to Crowley. Right, if he's at minimum power, and I'm at maximum power, I'll roll the dice, man.
Can you get me in? Can you? Me... I might be able to. But I need my equipment. - Where is it?
My laptop was stolen and I'm looking at it. So it wasn't stolen? No, no, it's been stolen. My cell phone... is indicating where it is.
"Captain Crane must lead this organization. It is his sacred duty to remain vigilant against all threats deemed supernatural." It's Washington's agency. George Washington founded a group to confront the supernatural. He survived.
I'm not much of a logistician. "Security consultant" would be better. I used to be a policeman. It'll look better on your CV than your current employer, SMQParking. So, take my money, pass it through this place and it comes out clean?
He literally sucks the oxygen out of the room to put out the fire. - A fire needs oxygen. - Yes, I know that, Dumont. - What good does it do us? - If I can trigger the system Without activating the alarm, it will suck the air out of the room, Cut off the oxygen to the fire, just like with anyone else in the room,
The accident. The crash wasn't an accident. What the world knows is that an ISAP plane with volunteers on board crashed yesterday in a remote region of the Ural Mountains, just inside the Russian border. What they don't know: it was brought down on purpose, - by us.
It's started. I'm connected to the Air Force network. The control towers in SeaTac, Vancouver and Anchorage. No sign of our plane. No sign of our plane. It hasn't disappeared.
-All right? -Hello. -He was on the soccer team. But I quit when I saw Chuck's book. And maybe you know where he is.
Each of our subjects describes this place in remarkably similar terms. They drew this. Concentric circles. Scientists and theologians have studied the brain for centuries and what happens to it when it fails to function as expected. Does it cease to exist?
Do you still have that fatal smile? No. Come on! Let's go. There he is.
Nowadays it's easy to find information about someone. Everyone is connected. You... Do you really think the universe shows you where to go? The universe has a correct course. It talks to you.
It seems so. - And the envelope? - Sir? Have they checked the envelope? Well, it'll be full of prints.
Yes. It's a pity Dr. Turner hasn't returned yet. He will certainly receive a copy of my report. I'll pass it on to him. Would it be completely inappropriate to inquire about any conclusions it might contain?
Do you have big plans for the weekend? That's right, I've got a game of golf with my father-in-law. Lovely, that should be fun. What's his weakness? Whatever it is, it's smaller than mine.
No one is the... The wolf is the wolf. The wolf is you. He represents your worst fears. He knocks on your door, and it's like a... A reckoning, Ramon.
Have you ever met the crazy one? She's wandering around pregnant. No, I've never seen her. I realize you don't know how far we're willing to go to get all the clones. You'd better embrace this new future, Art, because it's coming soon.
You think your feelings are real, but they're not. Trust me. The sky is blue, right? But when it's cloudy, you think it's gray. In fact, it's still blue.
But we did it so that everyone else could live. The way you can honor their sacrifice is by keeping your mouth shut. Forever! Welcome, friends. We are gathered here to celebrate the passing of another day, and with it another step on our journey...
- Get in the car. - I beg your pardon? There's a meeting at the colony. I'll explain on the way. If it's about last night's incident, I can assure you he didn't come from my camp.
Good Simpson. Faithful Simpson. You would never go back to the nuclear power plant that was cruelly taken from me. What does your heart say? I looked deeply into my heart, and it said...
Cobbler. I have a grandmother in Atlanta who makes them just for me. Peach, berries, cherry, rhubarb, pineapple. You can't put pineapple in a cobbler. And yet here it is.
If you can't stand a strong female hologram, that's your problem. Jay G and DO-GG. We've turned the tables. This ultimate betrayal is part of your spiritual journey. Lesson number one: protect your neck. Say goodbye to your vengeful rap forever, because it's about to fall off.
We're closing early today. I brought bad luck. Bad luck resides in our unconscious. We bring it on ourselves. It always finds me.
I couldn't eat the rooster. But I jumped. I'm sorry about that. I wanted you to be happy, if only for a minute. But he was alive, just like Gary.
Nick! What was that? So you felt the arm come out of the mirror in the store? I saw it first and then I felt it. He hanged her.
- I want to see the mirror. - Not alone. - Are you sure about that? - Not completely. Where is it?
- Are you sure about that? - Not completely. Where is it? I broke this mirror. It shattered and the pieces came together.
- Not completely. Where is it? I broke this mirror. It shattered and the pieces came together. It's not magic.
Look, I saw my friend killed. You're wasting your time. You should stop that thing. The blood on his jacket wasn't yours. - Because he stabbed you.
- Why? - We found one... - Stop right now. We can't open the portal. He needs Nick to get through.
It could be anything or all of them combined. That staff is to turn Diana into his bride and destroy the world. In short, we need to destroy the Destroyer... or it's over. Something about his staff bothers me. It's totally cracked, as if it had... been assembled from different pieces. And none of these texts refer to that.
In short, we need to destroy the Destroyer... or it's over. Something about his staff bothers me. It's totally cracked, as if it had... been assembled from different pieces. And none of these texts refer to that. Something also bothers me. If it's as powerful as it should be and belonged to the people mentioned...
- I think they're going to kill you. Two guys waiting in the car. You chose the right side this time, Sean. Two dimensions exist simultaneously. One in which the cat lives and one in which it dies.
Meaning that Kullen could be Julia Kiefer's real killer. We intend to take this into account when making our decision. Wait for our decision in 48 hours. Not at all. I'm telling you, he's in.
It has to keep going up. And there's nothing we can do about it. - She takes what she wants. - What are you talking about? The sea, it takes everything.
Yes. Stay like that. Good. Tell me you saw her eat that insect. - I'm sure it flew away.
We know. You took on a huge debt just to make yourself more boring. It's a crippling debt. And thanks for never leaving a tip. What they teach you is that you can't tell the market what it wants.
Believe me, the king doesn't love me for my ability to have children, let alone look after them. You're free, you can go. So you've found the murderer? Yes. Who is he?
Yes, sir. That's enough for now. Agent Simmons? Not good news, unfortunately. The serum that's been giving him his strength... he's... he's... potentially lethal.
If we could talk to someone - who wasn't in the operation... - Agent Fitz. Yes, Coulson, sir. We were unable to locate the submarine via satellite. Do you think it's capable of launching missiles?
- released? - Yes. We managed to locate the two agents threatening Framework. They're on board a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet. As soon as he's in our sights... my men have orders to shoot him down.
Now... you're like a child, unable to process these new emotions... or the idea that... you don't always get what you want. And you still need to experience... the great feeling that killing brings. Maybe you'll experience that now... with you. Destroy this body for sure. It was only designed to kill.
- Darling, he's shown his face. - Who's that? That Anton guy who has the Serbian book that might have a cure for... That eye is a bit crooked. Ever since I put it back, it's been running away.
-I refused. -Wait. Wait for what? This is our dream. I know, Benjamin. But he wanted to keep 90 percent, and I'm not willing to give up 90 percent of our dream.
The Sumerians are said to have created the first riddle. The answer is fire. Right? If you light it, it lives. If you give it water, it dies.
Keep your cell phone on. Aren't you going to stop? Just wait. Now is the right time to celebrate. The money didn't go into the accounts of 300,000 dead people. It actually went to the right place.
Brand new. Well, they certainly do things differently in Boston. Would you be interested in a glass of eggnog, ma'am? Thank you, ma'am. It has a ring to it.
So, man, who doesn't like the future? I like history. Yeah, I know... It's full of terror and violence, - but the future is just... - It's uncertain.
That's not "Rest in Peace." That's the name of Dr. Midnight's killer. - I don't understand. - Please be more specific. That could be a long list. Right, even assuming the Legion took the Spear fragment from here, how did they know it was here?
- Forgive the interruption... - Excellent timing, Gideon. Your daughter Lily's algorithm has identified the location of another piece of the Spear. Well, when it rains, it pours. Where is it, Gideon?
Don't you get the pun? Too bad. Basically, your king now does everything I want him to do, so if you don't want him to spread your blood on this ground, I suggest you hand over your Spear fragment. My patience is wearing thin. The fragment... Where is it?
- The fragment of the Spear... we have to get it out of the castle. How can your team protect the Spear? They couldn't even protect Dr. Midnight. - That's not fair. - I'm not going anywhere and neither is the fragment. Fascinating. It seems to contain some kind of sophisticated receiver.
- and his protector. - The beer, professor. It could be a six-pack. How far are we from the eyeliner? It looks like it's just ahead.
Question... what can we expect when we get inside Rip's mind? - I have no idea. - Wait, what? Well, I've seen them do it, they've done it to me, but I've never been on one of those trips myself. Given that you'll be entering his subconscious, I suspect he'll look somewhere familiar from our old captain.
No. It's already started. I just wanted... Someone to love me. You can't impose love, Mxyzptlk. You have to let it find you.
So did I. Less than two hours. Time is passing quickly. I know it is. And if it runs out, we both lose.
Loyalty is good for business and I give it a lot of work. This spirit is ancient. Like the tides of other times. Feeding and sleeping. Then he wakes up and I'm lunch. He wants power and Marcel is powerful.
The question is... who among us chose this moment to carry out such a dangerous and treacherous task as digging up the corpse of a man who could uncover the Portuguese gold map? Was De La Warr returning here to exercise the role of Governor? - But he died at sea. - Do I understand correctly? If gold was found, then... would it belong to the Company?
I don't think so... You never reveal your tricks even if you want them to work out. - I'll park the car for you. - Leave him here! He and I won't be long.
I like Claire. I thought you knew. I like Diaz, but we can't pay for what she's done. Don't pull the lever. Let fate take its course, otherwise it'll come back to haunt us.
Grayson and Jessica were English teachers at the same school, but two weeks ago she blocked him on all social networks, which is a sign of trouble between a man and a woman. - Do you know what happened? - Of course I know. I called "The Land of the Morning" and spoke to a Mrs. Thompson. She said that Jessica had filed a formal complaint against Grayson. She said they were dating and after she broke up he was harassing her.
- Last time you lost control. You have to learn not to fight against yourself. The consequences can be fatal, and not just for you. It's a long road, MK. Don't look for shortcuts. Ryder asked for the conclave and, as the affected party, he will organize it.
Suspenders, the last resort for fat people. Your belly gets so big that your pants have to hang down. The belt no longer fits around the equator. It has to be tightened from below. Instead of holding the pants up, it pushes them down.
When that hard, difficult work is done, the seas calm down, which means that the workers can start to relax. It didn't fit in this guy's traction ball because it was big. It wouldn't go in. The rule of the hangi once it's buried is, if it's all right and the hangi is in the ground, all that's left is to have good thoughts, say nice things, don't swear near the hangi . Encourage laughter so that it creates a good atmosphere, which I believe positively affects the outcome of the hangi .
Go on, girl! I didn't know these pants came with an erection. I don't know how I did it. You know how they say rhythm gets into you? It got into me!
The movie, managing this bar, and working for that man. It's a man, right? And with the demand we have, we'll leave the Café little by little. And the deodorant that's hot to the touch. It stinks. I'm not giving up on that.
Uh, well, thank you. You're welcome. Have a nice day. Bro, if you let emotion get in the way of sales... I bought that dress for Ava, and I needed it gone, so let it go.
And you like her? So what's the problem? I had a fiancée... not so long ago, and it didn't end well for me. Oh, the heart is a strong muscle. It comes back to life.
Let's see. Is a shark good or bad? Bad. Why bad? Because it eats people.
Is a shark good or bad? Bad. Why is it bad? Because it eats people. So, if you're a person, a shark is bad because it can eat you.
If you stay calm, keep your wits about you and do exactly as I say, everything will be fine. Just do your job. No, for a second, the card actually slipped out of my hand. It felt like slow motion. It was in the air and boom, I caught it back.
- Mother. - Gaia, please. The Skaikru helped you protect the flame. Now, help us. He adorns the crypt of the First Commander,
If this bill passes, it will probably be because of you, and the President knows it. And if it fails... Well, we thank the senators who voted yes for their courage and promise to keep fighting for the issue. And then we won't talk about it for a while. This was the President's cause, And if he goes down...
This is where the yoga classes, drumming, cooking and healthy food workshops are held. Here are the stables. Where's the gym? I've been there or... We have one, but it's not essential to our camp.
I wish I'd met my son's father. Yes. I liked him. Go say hello and then we'll hit the road. "Dear William, I received your beautiful poem and it comforted me.
- Answer me. - I'm back, Dave. And I'm feeling like old times again. Now listen carefully, and I'll tell you where you'll find it. "What madness is it to expect evil before it happens?" Lucius Annaeus Seneca.
- No, it has to be... What? No, we're not raping the robot. No, we're not raping the robot. - What's that? - He kissed me.
And why is this important? It's because human beings are the only animals in the world that need help to give birth... and that's the beginning of social cooperation. This begins to distinguish the herd within a community. Because you need language, you need empathy, you need to share and all of your things are the building blocks of society, communication and communities. In every small-scale society, in every open society today, fire is a huge focus. It really creates society.
From the flame came new materials, stronger, lighter and better than the previous ones. From copper to bronze, iron and steel, fire transformed the natural into the extraordinary. Metal opened the floodgates to a new world of technology. We use it to launch empires and build industries. It transformed weapons, tools, transport and ultimately civilization itself.
And with this power, we begin to harness the destructive potential of fire. We turn against each other, but it's dangerous to believe that you can command a force of nature. As we know, fire can turn against us, and from destruction there can be rebirth. For our ancestors, fire was a mysterious force, there was nothing like it. Each new generation learned that it was a gift from the gods because there was a power in it that could not be explained.
Henry, come back. The great fire in London was like the explosion of fireworks, it destroyed everything. The actual physical devastation was enormous, more than 90 churches were burnt down, more than 13,000 houses burned down and 100,000 people were left homeless. The Great Fire of London was one of those opportunities to rebuild, not just physically, but mentally. It became known as a scientific revolution and was truly an opportunity to start from scratch.
We created machines that we could power with this power. Steam engines led the Industrial Revolution, which led to the invention of the locomotive and more and more to the modern world. Fire is a natural force, a force we can't always contain, but we can't give up and we won't give up because we get good results from this force. By harnessing the power of fire we have become closer as a species. Fire has made us smarter, safer and more united, united around our inventions. It has allowed us to make the world smaller and smaller and to go anywhere on Earth we dream of, and beyond.
during the Second World War, to develop military rockets and the world's first ballistic missile, the V2 Rocket. But if we hadn't had the V-2 Rocket, we might not have had the space program. We wouldn't have had rockets taking astronauts into space, putting up satellites and revolutionizing our entire communications system. Goddard's experiments are among some of the most sophisticated and high-tech projects of his time. He took humanity one step further. We walked with fire and then discovered how to harness and use its powers from our desires.
It's our evolution, the infinite journey. We only have our past to help us navigate and face our future. When we first trapped fire, we set a path that would define our species and forge the modern world. Fire became so central to our lives that we even began to worship it as if it were a God. It led to the evolution of our culture, our technology and even our biology.
His discoveries and his books were incredibly powerful because they allowed the knowledge to be transferred and spread to Arabia and Europe, until it became the code of medicine for the next thousand years. Unfortunately, all his autopsies were done on animals, not humans. For about a thousand years Galen improved modern medicine and people's treatments and methods, but a lot was wrong, for the main reason that Galen couldn't do dissections. Religion didn't allow people to dissect bodies. Andreas Vesalius, who was a Belgian doctor, lived at a time when dissections were possible, when it was possible to look at the human body and how it was made.
It's the best part of the day. He's focused on seeing his little friend. And at this stage he already has an absurd vocabulary. The lady appears, the gorilla is happy. He looks at her: "Hello, lady!
I'm sure you won't be arrested for that. We steal money, we steal credit cards. Plane tickets! How long has that car been following us? He looks suspicious.
I'll let Kanan know. Ghost to Spectre-1. Do you read me? Spectre-1, come in. This shield, what was it protecting?
Marla, everyone. You see? You need me. That better not be Marla's bass. He's already been sued.
At first, they were butterflies with glitter and things like that. Then they turned into... this. There are 42 in all, each one predicting something, horrible tragedies, murders, accidents, catastrophes. This is Flight 361, which crashed in the Andes last year.
You'd better explain. For years, an FBI agent has been making me do his dirty work. If he finds me, he'll kill me. So a corrupt agent is trying to kill you? Who is he?
Yes, I wish it was as bad as Cairo. And, you know, I really wish we'd stop talking about this now. Looks like you'll get your wish. Deckard's car is only half a mile away. There it is.
- Sigils? - Yes, demonic symbols. Each sigil casts a different killing spell. Sigils are usually recorded in hidden texts, they are not marked on the skin. Yes, because when you access a sigil, it is incinerated.
I only caught a glimpse, but the jackal mask and the bronze arrows were clearly Egyptian. It fits, if that piece of the talisman was hidden by Benjamin Banneker. It looks territorial, like a supernatural watchdog. It's as if we woke him up looking for the talisman. He didn't chase us.

Remember that Jake and Alex are stuck in training, so they're not going to the party. What about Jenny? She wants to go. She's been turning over debris in Sleepy Hollow. But Ms. Jenny knows as well as I do that evil tends to rise when you think it's been extinguished.
He's no longer the Knight of War. What do you mean, Jobe? Don't be afraid. The War Spirit wasn't destroyed, it was just separated from Crane. He can be reinvoked, if he has the right host.
Dreyfuss has the Knights near the president. You and I are the Witnesses. Yes, we are. The spirit of War was only separated from Crane. It can be summoned again, if it has the right host.
He doesn't have super speed without gravity. Latest news, Raymond: I don't need super speed to kick your ass. What's with the red button? It separates the Lunar Module from the Command Module.
I was at Oxford for a year, working on my master's degree, and in between dating this girl, Wendy, I remember reading an unpublished work by a classical scholar from the early twentieth century. This scholar had this innovative theory about Sir Gawain, that this knight had returned from the Crusades, not with the Holy Grail, but with something much more valuable. - The blood of Christ. - That's right. The work followed the theory that Gawain had a vial of this precious substance with him at the time of his death and that it was buried with him somewhere in the north of France.
One that would give the bearer unimaginable power. Have you ever heard of the Spear of Destiny? I've obtained numerous obscure references to it in my studies. But of course such a divine artifact could not possibly exist. But it does exist.
Discovered cold fusion. It saved the polar bears, fixed global warming. I mean, you even made desalination sustainable. I mean, you solve problems like this every day. If anyone... anyone can know why there are these scars and how to put the world back the way it was... it's you, man.
Speaking of him, what did Thawne have you working on? Grisalho did most of the work and... I just made his life a living hell. But from what I could see, he was building some kind of reactor. He said it would burn a thousand times hotter than the sun once it was operational.
I should have listened to you in the First World War. If we had used the Spear when we had the chance... I might have been tempted to use it to change my own future. Now... We have nothing to lose. Marty, Marty, Marty. I know you've been working hard on this project, and I wanted to stop by and say thank you, but if it doesn't come online in the next few minutes, I'm going to have to kill you.
In a society full of human innovations, one invention stands above all others. One that has become the obsession of the modern world is money. Money was not just an invention, it was a mental revolution. It created a system of trust, an elaborate bond that unites us all.

Money wasn't just an invention, it was a mental revolution. It created a system of trust, an elaborate bond that unites us all. It connected the world, making merchants cross continents in search of distant riches. Trade was the engine that drove the progress of civilization and money was the fuel. It allowed us to specialize, turning hunters into welders, artists, soldiers and kings.
We have taken it to incredible levels of complexity, from gold coins to pieces of information stored in clouds. The history of money is our history. Every coin, stone and cowrie is a symbol of what we are worth, who we serve and how our cultures have evolved. Money has become a language spoken by all humans. This is the story of how money made us modern, how it opened up the world and spread ideologies, transforming the ancient world into a complex civilization of merchants, mercenaries, executives and billionaires.
Money. It's a primary obsession and a global idea. The paper changes, but it's always spent in the same way. Money can solve all our problems, but it is the root of all evil. It buys happiness, but not love.
It is not a machine that we create, but a tool that we imagine, the technology of the mind. This technology drives the modern world. Economy, industries, innovation, globalization. Money allows billions of us to cross continents to interact on a common system, regardless of language or belief. It leaves us free to trade, invest and identify what we collectively value.
Economy, industries, innovation, globalization. Money allows billions of us to cross continents to interact over a common system, regardless of language or belief. It leaves us free to trade, invest and identify what we collectively value. In fact, money is a fundamental building block of our humanity. It made us civilized. But money didn't come out of nowhere.
This luxurious fabric was worth more than its weight in gold. A network of trade routes emerged to serve the demand. Merchants from east and west sought their fortune on the silk routes, clearing icy passes between mountains and scorching deserts. They founded new paths, connecting the world by land and sea. But trade moves more than just goods, it moves people and their ideas.
Perhaps the strangest form of money can be found in the Pacific Ocean, on the island of Yap. Here, the islanders trade giant stone wheels, some weighing thousands of kilos. These exotic coins reflect our technologies, our cultures and our values. As history reveals, money is more than just beautiful or useful. Money is whatever we imagine it to be.
We are mentally and physically addicted to money and when you are addicted to something you can be controlled by those who provide you with that something. We will do jobs we hate, we will do things we know are wrong, not because we want to, but because we need to. However, the value of money is built on trust. We all have to believe that our coins and notes are worth something. So what happens when the people who control your money decide that it is no longer worth what you thought it was?
When paper money was invented, it was something that could be exchanged for real gold, but of course, when people began to accept it, it began to be treated as currency and then the temptation began to want to print more of it, you could print as much as you wanted. And this was a temptation that, over the years, governments fell into. But of course if they are printing more money than they actually have, and if this spreads, then this will cause hyperinflation. And paper will quickly become what it really is, just paper.
There are many clever people who work hard to create counterfeits. The security features on a $100 note include a watermark with a portrait of Benjamin Franklin that is put on in the process of making the paper. And then the most prominent security feature is this 3D ribbon here. In the Western world we're used to credit and digital electronic transactions, but one of the characteristics of paper money, of course, is anonymity. I think the fact that it's so valued around the world is that they can conduct transactions using cash without being able to trace it.
I think the fact that it's so highly valued all over the world is that they can conduct transactions using cash without being able to trace it. So much of the world still uses these tangible products: Money is with us from birth, it accompanies us throughout our lives, it's with us until after we die. It's a force so fundamental to the human experience that we can't live without it, we can't survive without money. Money makes us modern because it is always at the cutting edge of technology too.
It is a work of art that tells us the story of humanity. The symbols and proverbs of our nations, the kings and queens of history, the gods we worship... They are all stamped on our banknotes and coins. With every advance, we reinvent money, only for money to reinvent us. It united our species by giving us writing, mathematics, spreading democracy, new religions and new societies.
My name is E.J, My name is E.J. Would you like me to stop and get you some coffee? Ejetto Technologies was founded by entrepreneur Ginny Bretton. Say her name quickly and it will rhyme with Einstein.
So would it go against the car if it only had two passengers? No. The vehicle would continue on its way. In order to kill as few victims as possible, your car would go straight into the tree and only kill you, and there would be no way to avoid it? He performs millions of calculations, better than any human can, in order to save as many lives as possible.
Doctor! - Look... A rock landmark from the Pictish culture. The bird! What's wrong with it? He said "dark".
The bird! What's wrong with it? He said "dark". Yes, that's why we hurried, because there's not much light at this time of day. - But he spoke!
And they'll keep eating until... there are no more stars. So which side are you on now? Because the way I see it, there's only one side. If it helps... I have a plan. It feeds on light, but is guided by sound.
You have to computerize. I work for the government. We're like the Flinstones. There's a program called Lotus 1-2-3. It would save you tons of time.
Well, before we got here, our staff took care of that. What happens in these cases is that you need a new name that fits where you're going. So they looked up the name of someone who died. They don't... they're not using that method anymore. So... that's where it came from.
You told me we needed to come up with a new plan. It just came to me when I was with him. It's going to work. I worked with him on the note he's leaving. He says it's all because he hates his life here and they've forced him to live in the United States.
Sometimes my friends don't believe me. There must be a better way. On the contrary, Mitchell. It's very simple. I take out the nest, it falls into the can and you close it.
8R requires your rigorous honesty, your humility, your patience, your diligence. You've reached Eddie. Leave a message. Stay close to the Light and the Light will give you everything you need. Of your own free will, you cannot overcome fear when it conspires with your pride, or your mute darkness, or your willful denial.
-Think of this egg as the submarine. -And the whole ocean above it. -Not just that ... the whole ocean. -According to the project ... ..... the S21 can dive up to 250 meters. -Rumors say it can go to 300.
We're ready. Imagine that this glass is the Earth. As you all know, the German V2 long-range rocket crosses the ionosphere as it leaves the continent. Now imagine if a rocket were fired vertically without any deviation. It would reach the F1 and probably the F2 layers, so this means that...
SETI stands for "search for extraterrestrial intelligence". If you're talking about communication between us and intelligent life in space, if there really is a society out there that has mastered radio technology, they will build transmitters that put a lot of information on a small part of a radio dial, you know, like your station with your favorite songs. Any society will have a radar. It's very useful.
I can't tell you what a pleasure it was to meet you. Ana! Hello, Diana! What have you done to your hat? I wanted to make a good impression, and it's so unattractive...
You are advised to remain in your quarters. Good evening! What shall we toast to? Won't you share a glass of wine with me? I prefer to see the world as it is.
Imagination is so much more fun than reality, isn't it? Does anything bother you? It's a big gap, isn't it? Where? Between the world we want it to be and the world as it is.
- On our way! The tunnel we came through has collapsed. We have to find another way out. What about the great abyss we're crossing? It goes all the way to the surface.
But at some point, they all started disappearing from my favorite places. It's one of my favorite creatures in the whole world. And I thought: "If it's happening to one of my favorite creatures, what others are going through the same thing?" And that's when I realized that one of the ocean's biggest problems is that it's out of sight, out of mind and that's basically a publicity problem. When we look at our planet, it's unique in the known universe because we have an ocean that is the source of life.
- She took us from Mars. She's an assassin. Enjoying your bacon sandwich? Why's that? Because he had a mommy in a daddy.
I'm going! I know you dream of leaving. Who, me? This is your heart now. It will stop beating outside this hospital.
Falling in love again. All this while raising a new child. Believe me, that's not what I imagined for myself when I was a kid. And sometimes I felt... That the dream had died. It took me a while to realize that it had just been replaced by something stronger and better.
It's dangerous, and there are many factors, but if we manage to coordinate everything perfectly... Zarkon's reign will come to an end, and the savagery that has poisoned the universe will finally be purified. -You did it, Shiro. -We did it together. As long as everyone follows the plan, it should work.
Zarkon's reign will come to an end, and the savagery that has poisoned the universe will finally be purified. -You did it, Shiro. -We did it together. As long as everyone follows the plan, it should work. It will work and it will show you that not all galra are as evil as Zarkon.
I'm talking about quantum realities. Cracks create fissures in space-time, increasing the likelihood of alternative dimensions in which your mother dies. Can we take another route? One that doesn't have cracks? We can take the pebble duct, but it's full of pebbles.
No. Come on, my birthday's on Saturday. You've been talking without me lately. If you must know, we've been talking about your new haircut. We weren't going to tell you until it grew out.
- Don't do that. - What? What? Come on, you're looking for an excuse to go out front where there's air conditioning. - What? - Yeah. Believe me, he'll kiss your skin, you'll love it, and then you'll have to go back and melt.
I can't think of him in prison. But 5 years is a lot less than 25. He must be suffering from the decision. Whatever he decides, he has our full support. He knows that. It's important to him.
Let the record show that the witness answered in the affirmative. Mr. President, thank you for coming and I hope we can get some clarification for the American people. Mr. President, you have the floor. Take your time. If you have any written testimony, we will include it at the end and it will be part of the record.
But he knew a crazy Michigan fan who came to watch a game against Ohio State, and he was the letter "G" in the line of drunk, naked guys. And that was your father. I don't see the advice coming, Mom. Yeah, I thought he'd hit on me, but...
You bet I've called a trial. I have work to do, Doctor. How did you lose your arm, Colonel? I didn't, Doctor. I know exactly where it is.
Turn it off! We don't need your help. I don't need your help to decide if we do! Raj, what is it? So, I went to warm up Halley's milk, and it smelled funny, so I saw the date you'd written on the bottle, and it said: "Friday".
It was a trap! Bring the spy. I'll end this dispute. Guys, the gravitational generator won't last long. If it stops, we'll be unprotected in open space.
- I'm not. - Good, neither am I. Have you seen this advertisement? That juicer can do anything. - Look at it, it makes soup.
Let's go. I found a camera nearby. I'm sending you the coordinates. Go quickly and find that worm. He's small.
What a stupid boy. You let a wolf into the hen house. It's a fox in the hen house, you idiot. You don't let anything in the hen house. Because he'll eat the chickens.
You've had a rotten tooth in your mouth for five years. And did you hear me complain about it? No, because I chew on the other side and avoid hot and cold. My body is my dentist. When the rotten tooth has to come out, it will come out by itself.
- Interesting, because you're about to cut off my leg, and I still can't believe it. - Energy potion, sir. - Thank you, ma'am. Did you unlock Sharov's cell phone? No, he must have a disposable cell phone.
But none of this would have been possible without the stirrup. Two strips of leather attached to a saddle. The stirrup, in its own way, was an important military innovation, as were the sword, the bow and arrow and later the rifle. Why? Because it allowed people to control their horse very efficiently and this was very revolutionary.
The stirrup, in its own way, was an important military innovation, as were the sword, the bow and arrow and later the rifle. Why? Because it allowed people to control their horse very efficiently and this was very revolutionary. The stirrup was a very important thing, both at the time of the Mongols and later, at the time of the European knights. It allowed the rider to stay firmly in the saddle, which allowed the person to wield a variety of weapons for both speed and precision as they moved forward.
And with just one competitor remaining, Charles Robinson from the USA has secured a place in Level 4. The only question now is who he will face. We have a great climber coming up, Roberto from Mexico, so let's wait and see. It all depends on that now. There's only one competitor left and that's Mexico's Roberto Perez.
His office didn't say. But we'll be ready for any and all attacks. But why? Why should we defend a program that provides a home to street children in India? Senator McDowell ran his campaign on fiscal responsibility, so I guess he'll challenge our program on the grounds that it diverts funds....
What does it say? Is that a yes? - Miss Aguilar, is that a yes? And there are those who believe that only the heart knows what we really want. That it is the compass that can guide us to happiness.
I'm so humiliated. That was ridiculous. And that keeps César Curti and the hopes of an all-Brazilian final alive. Anderson and Rafinha better not celebrate just yet. There's one more competitor and he's Germany's Ludwig Hefele.
It's sinking. - It needs... - Look at that! Get out of there! And it sinks.
That's very good. What will your technique be like? But he couldn't hold on until the end. He missed! If you have that much friction, it will burn your hands.
Emma. When we met, I was only interested in one thing. Getting my revenge. And you did something that no one else had ever done. You showed me that a heart full of love is the most important treasure. And one I don't want to lose. They say that a captain's heart belongs to his ship. But with this ring, it now belongs to you.
Hello, Mom. It won't be windy or rainy in here. My mother won't be cold. What's happening? The volcano is just warning us that it's there.
My mother won't be cold. What's happening? The volcano is just warning us that it's there. It's incredible. It could erupt at any moment.
The Beam has been on the International Space Station since May. It is 16m³ fully expanded, but the B330 is 330m³. If someone was going to Mars, they would probably want to put a few of us together in the center of the B-330. It was designed to hold up to 6 astronauts.
Beverly believes that I unconsciously consider my bedroom an escape from reality. Does that bother you? Yes, I don't like unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. He should tell me everything.
I'll let you know when I have. Captain, my research theorizes that marginal singularities can pass through realities and pass from one universe to another. Spock, what do the logs show? They're encrypted. But from what we've been able to decipher, it seems the Defiant discovered this so-called "black hole" while it was traveling to our reality.
With some fine-tuning, Galileo turned his telescope towards Jupiter and what he discovered was nothing short of heretical. And when discoveries like this turn against the divine, they become dangerous. Although Galileo was put under house arrest for the rest of his life, the details he discovered could not remain hidden and would reach scientists for centuries to come. It seems that a telescope is a wooden tube with a few lenses, but it had this incredible geopolitical effect.
The invention of the horseshoe turned out to be a watershed moment because it allowed Rome to expand its dominion even further and beyond the known world, spreading its knowledge, its laws, its way of life. And in return, bringing more money and tribute to the center of Rome. The horse and the roads in Rome actually enabled the creation of the world's first postal service and there are reports that, with a good relay team on horseback, a message could be transmitted 800 km in 24 hours. That was quite a distance to cover in the ancient world. The advantage of a horse is that it shortens the distance.
The Mongols' ability to conquer most of Eurasia, in my opinion, is inconceivable with what they had. They took 3 or 4 horses with them at a time and sustained themselves with those horses, whether from the milk of the mares or the blood of the males. They drew their sustenance from those horses. The horse is undoubtedly the most important animal in all of human history. But we wouldn't know the world as it is today without the horse.
We always want to go further and faster. It would take thousands of years for horses to give way to mechanical descendants: The iron horse. A steam engine was obviously revolutionary. The biggest change was that it created the organized world we live in today.
Then suddenly, the world became much more organized than it was and this is a pattern that still persists in the world today. At the beginning of the railways, it was realized that moving at high speeds was not healthy for man and without a doubt, one could explode or collapse. Moving above 50 km/h would definitely be a radical event. The train changed the world by allowing the transportation of goods, for example. It was designed and built as a machine for transporting goods.

Steam engines inspired a revolutionary new invention: internal combustion. The engine that would drive the modern world was born. The automobile led a revolution and ushered in the new world. It brought us personal mobility on a speed and scale never seen before.
And Dayana Mampasi? In just six months, she turned a pacifist NGO lawyer into a dangerous spy. There must have been a reason. She was a child soldier in the Mugabe regime. She would say that she left her past behind when she came to this country, but it never went away.
There's also a factory and an abandoned kennel. - A kennel? Let's see. Can you access a satellite map? Here it is.
She couldn't go to people one by one and clear everything up. It's a generational problem, because during my middle and high school years, when we got home, all we did was hang out on MySpace, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Our world was school and social networks. That's why when we suffer from cyberbullying we're attacked by lots of people hiding behind a computer screen. Adults have no idea how damaging cyberbullying is. PSYCHIATRICIAN UNIVERSITY OF STANFORD It didn't exist when people my age were younger and cyberbullying doesn't end when the school bell rings.
What's that? Throw a piece of potato or pepper inside, cover it. The pressure of the steam holds it in the hole and it seals. It's the same with an egg. Just crack it and it cooks right into the hole.
My belly is very disappointed in you. Go to The Biggest Hole. Eep, wait. What would a lesmode do? Or rather, what wouldn't he do?
- Leighton? Haven't you noticed the way he looks at you? How could he not like it? What does it look like the monster is doing? Well, he's a nocturnal creature.
- On the road to Foyers Point, where we were supposed to meet Jonjo. Evie? She didn't want to tell you why she took your car. Very well. Show us where you think he started following you.
Very good. Show us where you think he started following you. More or less this way. There's a speed camera after the hydroelectric dam. If he didn't take a side road, we'll be able to identify him.
What he did was unprofessional... He compromised the case. He told the truth. We're dealing with a serial killer. When Detective Redford found the piece of brain, it was in a bloodstained bag.
Okay. Well, we've discovered what's causing the power drain: a new hybrid is wrapped around the main battery unit. That's where we go when we go down the spiral staircase, and turn left after the breakfast room... It excretes some kind of liquid through its tentacles.
I couldn't forgive myself if it fell into the wrong hands. We must destroy it. You're right, Doc. I'll use the secure recycling. It'll be gone forever after that.
Assassin for hire. Don McGrellish promised me money if I caught the wolf. He lent me this rifle. Why would you kill a wolf? He's killing Don's sheep.
- Do you want it? - Yes. Anything else? It's no good, you know that. - He can fly.
If you love something, set it free. Isn't that the motto? You know I can't do that. Do you know what happens to a great white shark when you put it in an aquarium? It smashes its brains against the glass.
All these maps were drawn by someone who could see a part, but not the whole. I spent my last dollar on a one-way ticket here and you tell me about healing through belief? You look at the world through a keyhole. You've spent your whole life trying to widen that hole to see more, to know more. Now, when you hear that it can be widened in ways you can't even imagine, you reject that possibility.
We have new orders... To map the Verde River. Please! Find its source. It forms a critical part of the border between Bolivia and Brazil.
- "They're evaluating my hiring!" And if my colleagues at Columbia University Google me, it's the first thing that comes up! Along with an emoji of a ghost, thank you very much, doing a little dance. That book was our baby. And you abandoned that baby before it learned to fly!
Get downstairs... and get him out! Hold it right there! Turn it off. Ghostbusters! I'm glad you found a hobby, and I believe that flooding New York with ghosts seemed like a good idea, but we like the world as it is!
I don't want to talk business on such a beautiful day, but I have to have that money. Escobar sent me his business card. A bloody coffin. I apologize for the rudeness of my partners, but as your friend, I beg you to get his money. Without it, he's an animal.
I'm not much of a team player, but... maybe we should accept it. She wants to take over the world. So what? What has the world ever done for us? It hates us.
I've only raised your stress levels to the point of triggering a mutation. You sadistic bastard! I cured you, Wade. Now, your mutated cells can cure everything. They attack your cancer as soon as it forms.
There you go. Michelle! Let me give you a ride home. We're going to the same place. - I've already called the cab, he's on his way.
Now. I've never been through puberty! - I thought it would be a private moment. - This is good. At 30, I never went through puberty. I had a tumor on my pituitary gland and it blocked everything.
Remember, we talked about it! Can we take it easy? When I met you two years ago, it was the best orgy of my life. Let's get that feeling back! It's there.
Girls Like Us? - They need an ending. - We're working on it. Find one that's happy. It will be.
"Sometimes a thousand tinkling instruments will murmur in my ears, and sometimes voices, that if I had just woken up from a long sleep, will make me sleep again." I thought of something about the book, O, Lost. I think we should discuss the title. I don't know if it captures the body of your book.
Mr. Hughes, the Americans want to know... if anyone is making a profit from a plane that can't fly! Senator... I came here to testify of my own free will. No one is making a profit. This plane will be used for testing and research... and advances in the art of aviation in this country. In a few more days, it will fly.
Finally, there's a better way: helium! It's a gas. Don't worry about your balloon. It'll end up in the ocean.
Judging a music show like me, huh? Am I doing something wrong? That's easy to say. You've never had to worry about money! You've never had to worry about whether the next check will arrive or not!
I like your hat. I bought it for you. It's too small. No, it suits you. Darling, it doesn't fit your head.
Please, Mom! Where did that come from? Let me hold it. You really stink, little boy. Guess what, I saw a rat downstairs and it was huge!
Tull. Love is a lie. It's a trick played by the cruel on the foolish and weak. Keep it away from your spirit. Never let it weaken your spirit or your resolve. Because in my kingdom there is only one law.
Stay behind me. - Why do that? - Do as I say. Praise be to the Great God Ra. Usually, when a bird lands on my boat, I kill it before it makes a mess.
Don't take revenge so personally, the republic will take care of it. It's already done. - Your nephew confiscated his castle. - Confiscated the castle? Yes. Today it belongs to the people.
Can you leave us, citizen? - Why? Because we don't need you anymore! - Because we don't need you anymore! You fooled me. The Austrian cousin is no cousin. - He's a prisoner!
- It's completely black. - Sausage is black and white. - Of course. - I make it just like Mama Renee. - His mother. I didn't skimp on the paprika, even though it's so expensive.
This is magic! - How do I get back? - Go to Issoudun, to the herb square! There's a store there, that of Citizen Eusebe. He's my descendant, Shrew, he'll make the magic potion.
I'm going to hide in the bushes. Hello, Mervin. Shut up, or I'll dress you inside out tomorrow. Good morning. I took the car to a service station and it's fine.
And he showed me, man, you have to listen to this. We said, well, we have to do that. Fall of a scientist, huh? ♪ Lie down and surrender to the void ♪ He's shining ♪
You son of a bitch! Die like everyone else! Cool! I don't need you! I saw the map, and it said to go that way!
- What do you want? ! If you're going to wander around the forest, you'll ruin everything. You have to start thinking. I saw the fucking map, and it said to go that way!
However, you can learn something from it. The first hat I ever made. I thought it had gone a long time ago. He kept it. It's impossible for it to be here, and yet here it is.
But it seemed an impossible probability. And even though he was working desperately to create a cure, the girl's father took records of his daughter, her voice, her appearance, saving them for posterity. But then a breakthrough was made. Marcus discovered the T virus. Once injected, it would detect and repair damaged cells in the body.
What's wrong with you? It's a day of celebration. Celebration of your faith, not mine. That's the virtue of wine: it doesn't discriminate!
Except me. Have you seen a dragon? Of course I have. Of course I did. What did it look like?
All green. Except the eyes. His eyes were red. Like hellfire. Before he could blink... he tilted his head back, opened his huge mouth... and fired...
We need a helicopter, because the dragon flies. A dragon? Jack, you brought me here because of a dragon? I don't know how to explain it, but he's telling the truth. He was here.
I've just returned from patrolling. Copy that. Shutting down protective shield grid on 24A. Once inside, Ratchet and Clank will go straight to the Star Cracker chamber where the core is located. When Ratchet exposes the stabilizer, it can be turned off quickly...
The other door they demolished was identical to the one in my building. You see, both buildings are exactly the same. Did the demolition team inspect the elevator before sending it to the basement? The one next door was already in the basement, it didn't need to be abandoned. And the cops investigating Crowley's death couldn't have looked in the elevator, could they? Because he was under 20 feet of rubble.
I'm saying... Miss Edna and I think you have a gift. You've been talking to Miss Edna! Maybe she's sown some seeds. - She's good at sowing. - And this gift... not only do you love it, you're good at it, but it can also finance our family and the church.
- So how did you lose the demon? I have to get to it. It's complicated. I've been trying to hunt him down for over 30 years. But he always finds a way out of my hands.
He's the father of this project, and there's no one better than him to explain everything about it. Ladies and gentlemen, with you, Mr. John Henderson. I didn't know I was so important. It's more than thirty years since this dream opened its doors. And, like all great dreams, it must come to an end, even for me.
The North Koreans are my friends. Now move! What about the door? We forgot the detonator. The body, it's gone.
I stayed there and saw the ship hit the rocks... There were no survivors. You hid them... you buried them in those catacombs. It broke into a hundred pieces and sank beneath the waves.
There are no enemies here. Here! You have the world in your hands, benefactor. Know this. I believe he's with these men.
And I know you didn't want to do that, but you did it anyway. And now you have to pay the price. So it's going to happen in one of two ways. One, you'll tell me where the kidney is, and when I have it, Tommy here will put a bullet through your heart. Or, you don't tell me where it is, and I have one of my less civilized men take care of you.
What's happening to me? Everything here is a lie. Stop it, Ina! This place twists you. It changes you.
You had a... strange little object. I could see it. It was something that had been put under my skin. It was a kind of bean, but it was a bit stretched out. And it had magnetic properties.
But I met Rachel and decided I wanted to be with her. She's fantastic. When I said to my mother: "I'm seeing a magician." She said, "Did you say musician?" And I had to explain to her that no, he was a magician.
We don't know the date yet. But it'll probably be a while, won't it? What does it matter? It's the last job we'll need to do. When it arrives, we'll go there.
What are you, eight? You don't know how to sail. It's an obvious choice. It chose me for a reason. If the ocean is so clever, why doesn't it replace Te Fiti's heart?
- Six months. - Six months. So sweet. A teacher once told me that I'm a master of self-reinvention. I didn't really know what he meant at the time, but since we've been here, I've started to understand.
- Oh, my God. I can't believe it worked, I didn't even know what I was doing. - Zan, concentrate, tell me what you see. -The house is empty. I'm sure that if you blow on a condom, it'll go round.
But in the end, she remembers the good things. Now, Sofia, I know... that what the dream says, is what your heart desires. I know that. The dream comes to you, doesn't it? It's Sofia's dream.
The phone doesn't work. I think I've got to you. I have a cell phone, you idiot! I know you do. I'm looking at it.
- I thought it was better to sin by... Varga, what did we say about you thinking? The poison will dissipate. I need this pure blood and I need it now. He needs his time.
- I've just signed up. - Thank you very much. Too much independent spirit for you? No, I just don't like criticizing my country. It's my country too. And right now, it has blood on its hands.
- Thank you very much. I work in IT, and I thought I could hack the market like a poorly protected network. May I ask how much you lost? I told Lindsay it was 20 thousand, but between you and me, it was more like 45 thousand. I tried to recover, but... It was a mistake, and now I feel like I've lost control. I've seen it many times, and it always pleases me to help someone overcome a bad habit before it prevails.
Now they can't stop and we have a lot to reveal. You have no idea what awaits you. This is fantastic. Another controversial article appeared in the Washington Post. It reveals another extensive and secret surveillance program.
This is the interesting stage, hibernation. Like suspended animation. Coma and paralysis. We thought the heart would stop beating. But it slows down and becomes virtually undetectable.
I'd like to see the world as you do, Marie. Why are you always causing trouble? You say one thing, you do another. You must see the world differently from other people. You see how ugly it is.
- Holy shit! It's so fucking intrusive for a bathroom attendant. I just... there's a sex app? Well, I mean, yeah, it just kind of contacts you with other people looking at it, in your neighborhood.
Yes, for a minute. Fuck me. Yes. For a minute. He gave me the price of $900 and called over one of his customers, and before I knew it, his customer came and took out a wad of cash and, um, put it right in front of me.
Hey, hey, group-- table group here. Come on, Warren, man, quit giving her such a hard time. Shut up, Benny, will you? Drink your drink, will you? She can have it.
Uh, four-- Six-- Four to six months. We--we averaged that out to five. The beginning is always strange. Does it start with the first text message, the first kiss?
That's a new record. Not everyone is good at the same things, Mitchell. Dad doesn't think Mitch is dedicated and says he seems to blame other people for his problems. I think Mitch will be fine. I've actually read the article he writes for that magazine, and he's really good.
I've actually read the article he writes for that magazine, and it's really good. He's a great writer. So, this is big news, Mitchell. What's it about? The article, uh, he's, um--
- You talk like an addict. - It's important to me. No, you have to come to your senses. Moriarty's back, we've got a real problem now. - He's coming next.
No more! Never! What are you saying? Is your body made of sugar or what? Does it melt when it's kissed?
What about this system? It's a G-class star with a planet. The planet is class M, with no signs of life. But there's something else. The fact that this monument suggests that someone was already here, it is also situated on a huge energy source.
And that doesn't happen everywhere. I like this place, we've built a dam so that the water can be stopped. And we can get the gold out of this place. Dam? So the river will flow with lots of water. It's flowing.
You can't be sure. But if I were to guess... they made him too smart. He came to his senses and decided to use it. We never opened the file. - Who did? - He opened it himself.
Let's take the portal. I thought so. Guys! Remember me? -Look who it is.
I need you to be brave. Braver... than ever. I can distract him. I can use the fire, I can use it. So I can go outside, and he'll follow me... So you can get out of here and run away.
I didn't say that. You said "convince him". Seeing and thinking are the same thing when your eyes are closed like a dream, but you choose what happens. You remember the bright lights and adults shouting, and everything is cold inside. Then you think of the sun, how warm it is.
They've spent their lives in this career and... They haven't saved any money, they haven't done anything. They have nothing. Many continue to fight because they need the paycheck because they've already spent all the money they had. I can say that I've saved 90% of the money I've earned in the last four years. Some athletes have saved and are doing well. Some spend their money as if it will never run out.
And he's been my friend since I was a teenager, which is strange, but if I try to find another person with Asperger's who understands me, maybe we can become best friends. Their humor, I think, is what really brought them together, and then Noah deepened the relationship. I hope you're not talking about me. You told me to be myself. You see, like humor, it exists.
These writings are basically a kind of code, with symbols and double meanings. You have to translate them on two levels, the language or symbols, and what those symbols are trying to say in the context of the symbols around them. So how did this old book get to the house? I don't know how it got there. I can only tell you what it says.
No, Andy, come on! I thought I was going to drown for a minute. Do you realize we're at the lowest point? My dress is ruined. It dries.
That's right. Wonderful, Daisy. Come on, lovebirds. Save the flirting... until we've got you safely in that ambulance. The baby's turning, Daisy, he knows exactly what to do.
They'll get you, Alex. Justice will prevail. Cornell taught me to be strong and that's what I'll be. People understand the threat, the kind of person you're up against. They don't talk about the money or where it came from.
Time has no meaning here, only memories. Memories? We've been fooled into perceiving Time as a straight line, with a past and a future, but in fact, Time... Time is a circle. And memories are timeless. Every moment of our lives, it exists in this place... Every memory.
We can reverse it, clean them up and put them back in service. Do you think I'm going to play along and allow this homicidal thing back into service? It's homicidal by design. Walter kills other hosts all the time. I admit the method here was unconventional, but he didn't hurt a guest.
- I'm not your judge. - Yes, you are. You're the only one who knows me like I know you! Do you think the world stops when you leave it behind? Did it stop for Mary and Joshua when you went off to war?
It was difficult at first because I missed my mother. But then I had a Mohavi... I had a Mohavi sister and... Excuse me, this dress doesn't look right. But the dress is part of the story, it shows that you were saved.
Darling. Kevin, this morning I forgot to give Anna her medication and she didn't ask me either. - Come on. - Two days ago, she could barely get up from the sofa and I don't know how she's like this now. We enjoy a good day when he shows up, darling.
Look at their past. Don't go too fast. First love. Why does first love happen? Why doesn't it happen again?
We can send him to hell, but your fiancée must be dead. Roizman. We can save her. Maybe we can. But when we start taking that demon out, he's going to put up a hell of a fight.
The money you earned. I need it now, Phiona. I gave it to the wedding man. - You gave away our money! - I had to! Without it, the man wouldn't have taken Brian, Mom.
Did I stab him? Did I push him off a roof? I don't know. My parents were wearing fancy dress. It was cold and raining. You grabbed my mother's pearl necklace, it broke.
How did it go down? We chased him through a subway tunnel, back and then we caught him with a half kilo of coke in his sock. Wait, wait, wait. - It was in his sock.
What? What? Better ... better man? - All right, I'll work on it. - OK. Sarge doesn't approve of marriage, and honestly, it's killing me.
Keep asking. I hope you find out the answer. What does that mean? Your body won't last long. If it doesn't, you'll be stuck there for the rest of your life.
There's a chance he won't come back. Mom, Dad's still here. Can you give us a minute? Do you know why the cat acts strangely? Well, it's because he's Dad.
They were vulnerable to you. They had more to lose than you and fewer means of defending themselves. Until now, I thought that applied to me too. But I don't know if it still does. It's normal for men who have recently acquired power to think that it has no limits.
-gave him power... -He has given those who dwell there to revere him and his authority first... - And he works great wonders on all those related to him or with the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding count the number of the beast, for he is the number of a man, and his number is 666.
There's more, guys. Check it out. Let's have another look. Who's that? He must have been in the car when it fell into the water.
- What does that have to do with me? - You were at table 9. If you say so. I don't remember. Were you in the car with Laura when he fell into the water?
Well, a friend of ours just hung up on me. That's not my phone. I swear, I've never seen this before. Would you like some advice? You should use it to call a lawyer. Like I said, my client never saw that phone in her life until it rang inside the drawer.
We did everything we could to make ends meet so that we wouldn't be a burden on our family. After Ronald died, I moved into an assisted living center. It was a nice place. They told me they would take care of everything. But one day, they said that all my money was gone. How could that be? Where did it go?
After Ronald died, I moved into an assisted living center. It was a nice place. They told me they would take care of everything. But one day, they said all my money was gone. How could that be? Where did it go?
William Fosset. A man named William Fosset was dismissed from a commercial painting company shortly after starting three days ago. His employer, Bleaker Paint Works, filed a complaint for trespassing and unlawful entry into its warehouse. It seems that he stole supplies. When the police checked the address, it didn't exist.
Neil. What's wrong? Tom won't be on this plane. Do you want to explain that? They said a plane was on the way, but they didn't say he was coming
I don't have any money. Why are you in this place? Don't tell me if you don't want to. I twisted my sister's arm. I twisted it so much that it broke.
Yes. Give me fifteen minutes. - Sugar, where's my computer? - Exactly where you left it. It doesn't come on its own.
Can you confirm that there is no pathological agent? No, Mulder. I mean, there's nothing. But there is something. There seems to be a material, but it doesn't appear.
You've done well, you've fought against warming. You love animals. Come Friday, maybe Wednesday, the garbage men take the garbage away. It's no longer your problem. Magic! But it's your problem, because it piles up in the landfill.
I panicked and crashed. I thought I was going to die. That's when I heard the sound. It was so loud and sharp that it hurt. It was in my head.
He hides in the shadows, never attracting too much attention, but in every life. he stands next to a seat of power, sowing seeds of destruction. Who remembers the name of the man who whispered in Gavrilo Princip's ear and convinced him to start the First World War? Why did he do it? What's in it for him? The more the world is focused on destroying itself, the less he notices an immortal psychopath in the shadows.
One of the great lessons of time travel is that many things cannot be changed. Time wants to happen. Chronos, even the Vandal, won't be the only enemies we face. Often it will be Time itself. Whether he wants it to happen or not, we will change time, we will erase Savage's future, and we deserve our rightful place in history.
There's no blood circulation. We'll have to amputate. Serra. Amputation below the knee of the left leg. We're recreating the incident. Put the article exactly where it was found.
I'm... glad to see you, Commander. You seem... unharmed. What's the point of a toy? To be played with. So not playing with it would be...
I never expected to be one of those people, where did it happen? I was at home in Nevada. But not in the desert. In the suburbs. Just having dinner and this white orb came down from the clouds and it lifted me up.
I said, are you on vacation? I know some good restaurants. Do you like Italian? My partner has a nice place. He's right on the river.
Let's go. Some, including you. - Does your family know? - No. If you decide you want this inheritance, and... you're willing to prove that you're Chelsea, it will become public domain. Anyone will have access to the will when it reaches the Administrative Court.
Look. Gracias. Climb the ladder to the roof Where we can be Where we can be Closer to heaven We'll laugh and I'll tell you The story of love As it is And the happiness it contains Clear as day Dark as night
One per person. Thank you, sir. I'll do that. This huge 334-page document, which has yet to release its final verdict, is carefully balanced. It's hard to tell which side Mr. Irving's decision is on. It praises Irving's skill as a military historian, while at the same time drawing attention to flaws in some of his reasoning.
A game of lies. Chess, on the other hand, is a game of order. This pawn can only move in one direction. Moving forward, it can only capture diagonally. But if it tries hard, it can become something greater, or something more.
The main thing is that it works. - And how do I get back? - Another chest. There's another chest? Great, where is it?
You're holding on to hope. He covets the light at the center of your being. He needs something to hold the darkness together, Abbie. He's regaining his power. He needs the rest of your Eternal Soul.
No, but I have to be up to it or I'll look like less of a man and I won't be worthy of marrying you. Shouldn't you get that? Nothing else matters when I'm with you. If you're going to raise a child with Anika, how will that leave us? He's my son, she's his mother and you're my wife.
I see you're running the malware we found in the van. Dissecting it. Running it could be very dangerous, since one of its main functions is to connect the host to Samaritan. So what did you find out? Well, once active, it tries to access all the files on the infected equipment and send all the information to Samaritan.
If you don't tell me where Reese is, I'm going to do more than just point. I don't know, and I don't want to know, but I can't let you leave with that hard drive. Why? What's on it? What's on it?
Even if you like fairy tale endings, Harry. Family politics, well-done meat, monogamy. What's not to love? Bear eats a spoonful of food twice a day. And you can answer the phone if it rings.
Would you like to hazard a guess as to the target? The Russian consulate. Fast and accurate. Impressive. Still, your former employer may not detect the equipment until it's in place.
Come on, take a look. Agent Cole, your old partner, dead. I'm starting to see a pattern. Dead... Or... Alive? Did you set this game up by yourself, or did he tell you to bore me until I died?
Where to? Samaritan's copy was transferred to a server in a building downtown that has only one defining feature, a "Torus" antenna. This means that Samaritan sent a copy to a satellite. A Russian satellite, in Molniya orbit. He can then return to earth unharmed by the virus.
Give me a smile. Don't move! Hey! Give me a smile. There he is!
- Because it's political. It's in the government's interest to chase him, but not to catch him. Never. The Senator is a communist, like you and me. Yes, but he has special protection.
There's a man. A man who is about to kill me. Is he still chasing you? It's possible that he is. Who is he?
If it hadn't been for the kind Mr. Zheng, we wouldn't have made it. Humans can be bad, but there are good humans too. Love surrounds us. Love is patient. It can stand the test of time, it will never end.
He's awake! Go back to sleep, please. I never really believed that we were going to find a load of cocaine. For me, it was just one of those adventures where you go, like, to find your G-spot. You don't believe it really exists, and you're not sure what to do with it if you find it.
Why are they still poor? - The rich take everything. - No, because they don't dare. You have to dare to be rich. Visualize the money, and it will appear.
Who's this? Mr. Smitrovich takes photos for our newsletter. In our understanding of how history really works, he gives us access to the levers of power. His studio, for example, is an instrument of pure capitalism. As such, it expresses the contradictions of capitalism, and can be entered to finance its own destruction.
In our understanding of how history really works, it gives us access to the levers of power. Your studio, for example, is an instrument of pure capitalism. As such, it expresses the contradictions of capitalism, and can be inscribed to finance its own destruction. Which is exciting! It can be made to help the little people, the nobody.
I love that guy. Why don't you go and scare him to death? I didn't expect to see you so soon. Do you think I'd miss my killer's funeral? Here he is.
The pussy broke my nose. Looks like you've learned. I'll get your man, you go home, and next week bring more stuff. Well, well, well. Look who it is.
Do you have anything to say? I admire your dedication to the law. I really do. But we live in times when we have to look beyond the rules. We have to realize that they were made for a world of the past. Not the future. I beg you one last time. To see the world as it is.
You just don't care. You're afraid there's something more and that you're not worthy of it. Why is that? How do you stop a ghost? By finding out what it wants.
- Do you know who the killer is? - No, but I know how... - Then mine's better. Come on. We should have brought my car, it does 22.5 km/h.
Not everything, but it's something. So I went door to door, all over the block. I said I was doing a follow-up for the IA. I wore my old badge. I'd forgotten how soft it makes people.
We don't deal with that. Yes, because Trish and Colin came on a cruise ship, it fell under maritime law, so the Belize police department didn't investigate. The ship's security screwed up the investigation and eventually it was filed by Interpol in Canada as a "cold case". So we think this third body could be Colin Jackson? The same height, the weight estimated based on bone density, it's more than likely him.
Who's this? Excuse me, sir. I don't want to bother you. I just want to know where the girl found the cap? It belongs to her.
Manohar? He wanted you to see that. The other voice on the CD could be Manohar's. You're making a mistake. It was him.
Is everything all right, Grace? I'm just worried about Brooke... She's suffering, lost. Yeah, that's the problem with atheism. It doesn't end pain, only hope.
Fish and cheese together, David, this tuna sandwich is exquisite. It is. Exquisite. It's provolone. It was my idea. I love what it does to the flavor of the fish.
I don't know why you're freaking out. We literally know nothing about this guy. You're right. We don't know anything. He could be a nutter with a dungeon in his basement. If he's into Ruby, he's certainly crazy. Do you think it's a sex dungeon or a death dungeon? Is it so bad that I hope it's a death dungeon?
We have been presented with a unique opportunity. An almost impenetrable country opened its doors to a scientific partnership between the University of Cambridge and North Korean volcanologists. Thanks to this partnership, we were invited to film there. But everything we witnessed was an act and we went along with it. There's no other way to see this enigmatic country than the way it chooses to present itself.
I'm nothing. I'm nothing more than a blade of grass. But I exist. Do you think you know evil? Here it is...
A brother chopped up by a thief? It was something like that, I know. It was something like that that happened to me. Sometimes I remember it in one way and sometimes in another. If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice.
"And then all the light will end and the world will live in darkness. The very air will be pestilential for mankind. And our brothers, the Creatures of the Night, will emerge and feed. Such is our power, such is our kingdom, such is my kiss. And I know that my destiny, whatever it may be, is somehow intertwined with Ethan's.
in a store. And... it's a bookshop. I sit down, and there's this book... And I start leafing through it. I'm reading, and... he starts explaining life to me.
What about his heart? I heard an acceleration, but only once and only for a second. That didn't mean he was lying. Not really. The rest of the time he was calm.
Or do you, Corey? Very good. Do you see that? I see blood. Look where he's going.
- What do you want? What's the difference? I can find it. You can't. It leads to the tunnels, doesn't it?
The plan didn't go so well. So I'm going to need your help, okay? - You had a plan? - Yes. It looked good on paper.
Basically that's what we got out of all the fire, blood and carnage. How many size 41s are there out there? Only one with Parrish's blood on the sole. So are we going to try and cancel the game? No, no, let's play, but let's hope very much that it doesn't turn into a bloody massacre.
It goes straight to the head, to the neck. - We're sure of that. - This will not stop. Where the wolf finds one lamb, he will look for another. But he never eats his victims.
- Of that we are certain. - This will not stop. Where the wolf finds one lamb, he will look for another. But he never eats his victims. He kills them for sport.
Damnatio Memoriae. They erased every detail about him. Everything he signed, everything that was his. They burned everything. The name Sebastien Valet has been forgotten for 150 years, but when he is remembered...
Wait a minute. His ex-wife used to catalog antiquities at the Naydel Library before it closed. It closed three months after the accelerator exploded. Enough space to store Turtle's stuff. - Wait, Barry. We haven't even figured out how to neutralize his power yet. I'll have to be stronger than him.
Amputees have an itching sensation that they can't scratch or a pain that couldn't possibly be there. The amputated limb is so important that the brain acts as if it were there. So my subconscious is trying to tell me what's missing? Maybe. How the hell am I supposed to understand what it's saying?
I think I loved him. Power. The ability to control things. This metal has no power. It's small, weak, insignificant.
Find a way to remember me. A relic would be proof that Stiles existed. And that maybe we can bring him back. Let's take everyone to the Argent safe house. It's underground.
I know that direction. I don't know what to say. I haven't seen that jeep for... Almost 18 years. It's in your name.
I don't know what to say. I haven't seen this jeep for... Almost 18 years. It's in your name. But it's been stolen.
I haven't seen this jeep for... Almost 18 years. It's in your name. But it was stolen. So how did it end up at the high school?
All right, that's enough. I won't let you get out of control. Aninha here, go. I really don't care what the ad in The Times says. And if it does:
- How do you know the shape? - It left a mark, a cut in the skin of his neck. Alison, have you ever heard of a restaurant called Two Crows? - I don't think so. - What about it?
I know you ran a lot. Ronny. I can't live a moment apart from you Listen to me Without you my heart rages Now that we're together it says I'm filled with your love I'm completely yours
What do you do? Your J.D. Peoples file. I kept it. There was something there. Here it is.
But for failing to save my family? That's something I'll never forgive myself for. Time Master Declan, I... I thought the court was meeting. It's been canceled.
-Elaborate. -First of all, this app isn't bad. You see, most cell phones don't block all unwanted calls and messages. This app does. It also blocks them from your social media, but that's not the most revolutionary part, sir.
-First of all, this app isn't bad. You see, most cell phones don't block all unwanted calls and messages. This app does. It also blocks them from your social media, but that's not the most revolutionary part, sir. It uses retinal recognition technology to determine your emotional state.
You know, most cell phones don't block all unwanted calls and messages. This app does. It also blocks them from your social media, but that's not the most revolutionary part, sir. It uses retinal recognition technology to determine your emotional state. So before you call drunk, it saves you.
This was Dr. Garner... before his permanent change. Is the "Rasta-Hulk" your husband? I don't care if that "thing" used to be Gandhi. For God's sake, what is that thing doing here? It needs to be frozen in a gel-matrix cube.
- Something like that. What have you heard about the product? Sumerian fragment. From the beginning of the Dynasty. It has some... intriguing characteristics.
Previously in Sleepy Hollow... So you could see me just by touching the symbol? If the symbol works with the Witnesses' tablet... It could be useful to our cause.
- Did you kill him? - I didn't mean to. When they find out you've killed one of them, they'll massacre all the miners. Then they'll come after us. - Why did he attack you?
- Have you seen the troll? - Which troll? - Did you see it too? - No, but... - He's gone.
When he comes back, give him what he needs. Go! Where's the troll? I took care of him. So he didn't just attack once.
Breca! Where's the troll? I took care of him. So he didn't just attack once. He came back.
That's where we have to arrive by surprise. That's where... we get gold and iron. We strike at their heart. And this time we don't leave the dog guarding the boat. Bring the dog! He's coming with us.
Tell me what you know, and if there's anything there, I'll investigate. The only thing I ask... Can you not publish my son's name? I don't have to use his name. But when this article comes out... it won't be difficult for people to do the math. They'll know where he comes from.
Pius XIII appears, as do his beautiful blue eyes... and this soft round mouth. A dazzling image, so dazzling that it blinds people. In other words, a powerful, evocative image, not unlike that of Christ. But Pius XIII not only dazzles, he also offers words of comfort. With a magnificent speech, full of Latin quotations, he tells them that they, the faithful, should not be afraid.
I was so weak, I was strangling rats to survive. When did who find you? The Masters of Time. They took me to a place called Vanishing Point. Time doesn't exist there like it does on Earth.
What the hell? Don't pour the damn tea so close to the bills! Crap. God knows when we'll see some money. It'll come when these sarcastic comments stop.
You're a child. I'm not 20 anymore. Thanks, I know. I am a child. That's the only way I can see the world as it really is. In a different way than the zombies have shaped your vision.
Apparently, he's a fucking big shot. Fine! The plan, therefore, would be to attack the subway and kidnap him at MacArthur Park station. Judging by the presence of security, it looks like Wilshire and Vermont will be the final destination. But we want to hit the train further upstream, here in the tunnel before it enters MacArthur Park station.
We can hide here while the Hunters look for the Fragmentations. What if they decide to check this place out first? You know, feel free to update us at your convenience. As you've seen, Time doesn't operate as it's generally thought. It wants to happen.
You need to stop. - Stop what? - Fighting our destiny. Isn't it fate that brought you here? What part of destiny is she fighting? All of it. We've been reborn.
Well, I'm not the law and order type... or the type to stay in one place. Well, at least we have all that in common. At least. Take care, Jonah. The good thing about my world... For you, it's not going anywhere.
Under heavy fire. We need air support. Where is the Delta camp? Establish a perimeter! As soon as it's secure, we'll look for survivors.
Now might be a good time to start praying. - Gideon, what's our status? - I'd say "miserable". Shut down all non-essential systems for Savage's robot... Too late, Captain, it seems you've determined that he's still alive, because he's closing in on our location.
I'm all right. What are you doing here? - I came to leave a note. - Let me guess. It says, "Hello, Felicity.
I just heard a few beeps and followed the noise. Now, is deleting the little - trash can? - No. You can't delete anything on that phone. But it shows Ty and Ali having sex.
That dark desire that I see you're struggling not to say. What I myself want... Yes? To put my fist in Arietta's face. And there he is.
Because he didn't have faith in me. I felt that way once too. But now I know, deep in my heart, that God has a plan for me. His plan for me was very clear. How do you know it's over?
You know, I don't know how they do it. 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, 50 years. I mean, you don't get out of hell just to get into another one. Well, about the robbery/murder/boredom. The container that's missing, it was yours.
It's about my case. It's about my case. A murder on the docks. A security guard killed during a robbery. Yes, the container that was stolen, it belonged to Lucifer.
Well, I have a business to run, detective. I can't always play Good Cop/Good Demon Cop. I've got a case I can't solve without you. Really? What's so special about it? What's so special about it?
So he flew to Port Au Prince to see him in person, and when he realized where the money had gone, he confronted Vanessa and she killed him. That's pure speculation. If Vanessa transferred the money to herself, it should show up in her personal financial records, which you have access to.
Hand him over and we'll all go our separate ways. You two made a big mistake coming in here. What do you say to ignoring jokes that slow us down? What about your mortality problem? It doesn't exist when the detective isn't around.
Now the other one. There you go. Are you happy? Yes, as soon as I get my money, of course. So where is it?
Everything your men do to us, they want to do to you. Dad didn't destroy the work before he died, he hid it in us. You were right, the program creates awareness. We need to know more before we act. Until then, he should stay with someone we trust.
Who separates the jacket from the pants? I'm sorry, it's a coincidence, but... that jacket happens to be mine. I found it first. In the store, yes, but... but that jacket came from my closet. Look, it matches my pants.
When was the last time the wristbands were checked on entry and exit, and if they're still active, that sort of thing. I'll see what I can do. You know, this park is the biggest in Mumbai. It's the birthplace of Indian cricket. Now, it's just being stepped on.
Don't get upset, Eldritch. What's the status of the Aurora Cutlass? The ship left Egypt 31 days ago. Excellent. Now you have to make sure it docks here in New York.
Albert has the precursor. I could bring it back. I hadn't perfected the process, though, so I aborted it, but you're trying to regenerate without the precursor. It's not possible to restore life without it. It only works in 1 in 10 million.
"Graff"? Hmm? Gracie sent me a text. I didn't get it because I had my locator app on. It just came through.
Someone on a bus platform burned their lapel with a cigarette. So you had it repaired? No, I hate anything damaged, no matter what. Did you throw the suit away? No, I gave it away.
Did you hear that, guys? - It's so good to hear that! - It's wonderful! Here's the thing, guys. We saw him and he's a bit of a chatterbox.
We almost made it, but thanks to Pache, we lost Key and Peele. You need to do something to fill their time. What's that? But I haven't prepared anything, and I can't dance in this dress. It's just for poses!
The five of us against the entire German Army? Think about it. I can send a message to the Camp, and the British Air Force will send a bomber. Maybe they'll scatter around the village, forcing the Germans to retreat. Harry, we did everything we could. You wanted to make a bigger impact on the war. Here it is.
Keep moving. 9.5 KM FROM THE CONFEDERATED LINE I can barely feel my feet. Do you think the Major will ever give his horse a break? Not unless he gets up and begs.
Jed created a website and put it online without much thought. There are a lot of legal risks, money transmissions. Jed sold it to the first person he found. That was Mark Karpeles, a Frenchman who lived in Tokyo. He knew very little about Mark when he decided to sell to him. And as soon as he took over, it started to grow faster than Mark was expecting or prepared for.
Everything is falling apart. All my work. Falling apart. Did you like my humidifier? It's... 150 years old.
- What's going on? - A possible flu outbreak. At 4:27 p.m., Dr. Sanders died. Her boyfriend died shortly afterwards, which suggests that the virus can replicate quickly. Since the virus spreads, it can be anywhere inside the cordon.
It's a long time to take a father away from his children. But if it gives me time to reflect on my work and my priorities, and to calm down, not just in the marriage but in general, it will be worth it. Don't do it like that. Everyone is just trying to help. Yes, putting the problem on a boat to Australia, hoping that it will resolve itself or, better still, sink.
If you follow the instructions, you'll increase the acceleration force in your system and run faster than you ever thought possible. If it doesn't work, I'll be back. Dr. Wells, we need you. It's time for you to go home, Flash. Our satellite has finally found our floating friend and he's back.
I browned the onions. Now this pan won't be coming back to my kitchen. Now put the chicken in the pan. And let it cook over low heat. Chicken is eaten with rice. But it can also be eaten with bread.
I'm here to stay to beat the best I'm here to stay to beat the best Whenever fate gives you a chance to prove yourself You only have a few days to prepare He asks for every drop of your sweat in return
This city is destroyed because of you. It used to be normal. Until you came along talking about science and changing the future. You didn't stop to think what your accelerator would do to others. You only thought about what it would do to you.
She shot me before I knew it. The cleaner has a son, that's probably why she doesn't want to testify, she's worried about him. Annalise? How's the baby? If he didn't stop crying, I was going to suffocate him.
- My ass is offended. - Is it? Really? Let me see it. I'll make sure he feels better.
Here she comes! She took me for a poilu. - What happened? - Mom... Don't worry, I'm a doctor. He's had a shock.
- Yes? - Nathalie? Yes, it's Jean-Pierre. I'm at Maroini's shipyard. He's cut his femoral artery, he's bleeding to death.
About an hour later... We heard gunshots, then we heard her screaming. We ran to the water, called 112. At first we thought she'd killed her husband. So you don't believe in this lake monster? We sell some items that suggest it exists.
I didn't think you would stoop so low as to kill a boy. That boy was the Emperor of China! Nice one. He's following us. Look who he is.
Her grace, her spark, her memories... Everything. She... She really filled me up. Did she? I mean, Heaven brought the thunder and it barely scratched my painting. But you and your shiny knife?
He is traveling under the protection of the Blackwater firm in an armored vehicle in a heavily armed caravan. At 7 p.m. tonight, he will meet with tribal elders to acquire land rights. We have him for two hours. Okay, we get it. He's rich, don't let him die.
Put a leash on that thing! I warned you not to irritate it. Jaime's right. The beetle isn't a pet. It may be fused to Jaime's spine, but it's not exactly under his control.
Look at the ventilation. Pick a spot and focus on it, and see if you can melt it. And a bird hit me when I was flying. - No, you hit it. - No, he hit me.
- I'm Jamie. Logan... use your armpits. What's that for? Put your fingers under your armpits. When your body is freezing, it concentrates all its energy on keeping your vital organs warm, so... your torso stays at the ideal temperature.
- Dad... - Don't worry, it's fine. What happened? The wolf came to my house last night. I shot him twice and he didn't die.
I've got to go. - Danny, wait! - I'm all right! I'll be back! I saw you with the wolf. Why doesn't he attack you?
- I'm very good at these things, but even I need help sometimes. When I know who bombed him, you'll know. We found a cell phone. I think it's Krispin's. I need you to analyze the signals from the towers so we can find out where he was.
And keep pointing, then we'll give the money back. You were involved in an accident yesterday. Me? You're wrong. Please. We'll find your car and it'll be damaged.
A place of pure evil. Yes! Yes! Yes! Here he is!
How to take over the world. Max, we have to hide that crystal again, where Phears won't find it. I don't have it. What? Max, where is it? Max, where is it?
This show isn't leaving here anytime soon, right? So, what I thought was, maybe we can come over later in the month to see it, okay? And, believe it or not, your dad won some money tonight, so now he can pay for everything. That'll teach him. I know how much you want to see the show, and what it means to you.
- I can offer you a donut. I have a question for each of you marshals. What do I need to do to be a marshal? I have this lazy eye. It has a life of its own.
And I worried about myself. Now that we know who and what he is, what he did to those children, to Martin, I just... I want to kill him, put him through a clock and suffocate him. That's it. Let's see that button. It looks so ordinary. No, I feel something emanating from it. And strongly.
And I'm clean, too. Oh, but I'm clean! My dear wife will attest to that. I've been known to take two baths in the same month. And I'll scrub the place until no trace of a stench remains. Not that I'm suggesting it stinks now, Major General Bagsnog, but there must be a stench.
How did you know that, Jack? Monty, the company that bought Chief Daichan's building? Is it Taylor Investments? Affirmative. The restaurant is our link. Jack, our link is not just Chief Daichan, but where he stays.
Your intentions are very clear. I think I should be able to judge that for myself. No doubt you think so. Just be careful not to let his uniform impress you. It has that effect on some people.
I've seen women 'tickled', I've seen them 'hugged'." But like these, they've never been seen. Of the women he "hugs", he cuts up the "fun dinosaur toy" and takes it home. You're about to look into the abyss, ladies and gentlemen. And you'll be damn lucky if all he does is stare back at you!
A pillow. For naps. Anywhere you want. If they call you during a midnight kidnapping, for example, this way you can sleep... On it?
We use biometric identity confirmation, we do daily spyware inspections on our computers. They do daily inspections for spyware that you already know where to look for. You're trying to find known code anomalies. So you think there's some invisible kind of super-spyware hidden in our systems? It's only invisible until I find out what it looks like.
I knew Roman would come after me. It wasn't safe. I... I left you in a small hospital. It was run by Canadian volunteers, but...
I broke the rules. Natalya should never have known what I was. I thought love was enough. This secret... It doesn't protect us.
Natalya should never have known what I was. I thought love was enough. This secret... It doesn't protect us. It kills us.
Feel how the breath has calmed your mind. Keep your eyes closed, place both hands on your heart and breathe deeply into it. Breathe with your heart and feel its strength. Give thanks for the gift of your heart. As long as it beats, you live.
He can catch you. So you need to attack and hit. Don't worry, I'll tie the noose on myself. He comes with her, she smiles at me...
London City Airport is due to close. Good God. The Meteorological Service has reported that an anticyclone persisting over London is to blame. The smoke from the chimneys is stuck at street level, making the fog worse. With the lack of wind, it should last for some time.
Bad kitty. You're a bad kitty. Right. Your sweat. It doesn't lie.
And you didn't imagine that criminals could use it? - The enemies of our country? - Yes, I did. That's why I modified the code and included an alert system. Every time they use the program, it alerts my server,
- Freeze! - Jane, put the gun down! Where are they taking her? To a coronary lie detector. It monitors all contractions in the veins, heart and brain.
Jones ruined my life. What did he do? What did he do? At first, I thought it was just me and Tim. But... the camp he runs... is just... a way to get to the kids. He's insane.
Alexandra Parrish, my name is Matthew Keyes. I believe, like many others who work for me, that the FBI treated you very badly. They didn't trust you, they didn't help you and then they abandoned you. But I know that you love this country. And although you can't do much for it now, I know you wish you could.
Don't be arrogant. It's your first time in court - and it can be scary. -I'll be fine, they say the defense lawyer is a complete amateur. -Yes? Who is he?
Which is interesting, because there is an assault charge on his record. I've asked the Paris police to send us the file. Also, Rosey mentioned that Zoe had a laptop. But it wasn't in the tent. We'll look for it in the hotel room, see if it's there.
He called that number 2 days ago and didn't do it before or after, as far as we know. Can you trace it? Prepaid. We've called, but it always goes to voicemail. So he doesn't belong to any of the suspects?
A hotel guest found him swimming underwater. The killer must have thrown it into the sea. It's badly damaged. Have someone from the lab pick it up and see if they can recover anything from the disk. I was hoping he could give us what we need to sort it out.
Can we sit down? Thank you... Yes... We came across Zoe's diary. It didn't tell us much that we didn't already know, but it showed us that you and she were very close.
That's better. No. You can fool those fools over there, but you can't fool me. You've tasted blood. You know what it's like.
Look... I know you've had an experience with the acceleration force. And I'm glad you think we're going to win at the end of the day. But a little fear can be healthy. It helps you determine which risks are worth taking.
I want to. Okay, I'll give you the short version. - That's great! - There's an evil book. It possessed my car, then killed my father.
Baal doesn't use brute force. He instills paranoia. It enters people's minds, turns them against each other. The Necronomicon is the only way we can banish Baal back to the underworld. The book, it did something to me.
I have a plan for Baal. I'm going to find him, I'm going to take my chainsaw, I'm going to stick it up his ass. The book. He did something to me.
What are you doing? Listen, sweetie. I'm from the future. So all this Deadite crap of yours is nothing new to me. You can blow it now, you can blow it later, I don't give a shit. All I care about is that book and you're going to tell me where it is right now! Stop it!
You don't understand. So just listen to me, okay? Okay. It's about your father. The accident he had... it wasn't an accident.
You know it won't do you any good if this book comes out in a few months, right? Won't it? Other people will announce it sooner. If you wait even a month, you'll be late for the party. - It has to come out now.
I thought: "I'll keep reading. I'm not buying any damn Audi." It said: "Rub the cream on your penis and it'll get bigger." I thought: "I'll stop you right now. Rub your penis without the cream and it'll get bigger.
Mr. Maxwell's actions. But we came here for a specific reason - one that means a great deal, internationally... - Madam Secretary, I have to tell you that the reluctance I expressed to Mr. Maxwell was genuine. If Myanmar is to sign this agreement, it has to be amended so that the problem of possible damage from hydroelectric dams is resolved.
He made me put a gun in my mouth, and I couldn't stop him. I was like a doll. I was like a... a cow in the labyrinth. Wait, the priest put a gun in your mouth? No, no, no. I put the gun in my mouth, and... he just made me do it. I... pulled the trigger, and... I was going to shoot, but his power... controlled my mind.
Now we are here. You are in possession of great power. We need to take it back. What is it? It lives in there.
Harold just had hip replacement surgery. And Arthur's wife had just left him. Broken heart. I think he's vulnerable. They hunt in the same place until he's clean.
- It's you I'm worried about. - Aren't I lucky to have you? My brother needs to be found. Are you really sure, sir? If it were any other man, I'd send out a search party. It won't be any different with him.
You see, ladies and gentlemen, what I've been telling you? And we were together... alone the night Red Killeen was murdered. That's why I know he has no crime to hide. And I stopped wearing my wedding ring. I don't even know where it is!
They don't need George. You can't put a boy on the stand. Oh, look who showed up to save the day! Just in time, Mr. Blackwood, just in time to witness justice in Jericho. You can't create a monster and then expect it not to roar!
By maintaining this tradition, you are becoming their legacy. Close your eyes. Come on, close your eyes. That's all right. Now, imagine this hall, it's full of people.
Does anyone know how to turn off the fire alarm in the elevator? Because this wise it's really the snap out of it. Hey, pufpuf pass. Ah, you don't smoke. No, it cleanses your aura or some crap like that.
You don't even have to blow it up. Let's analyze it again. Excuse me, antonio? Could you water that cactus? It's looking a bit dry.
I came all the way here to tell her. Yes. Do you think you'll give me a baby? I'm not sure, but you can get a baby for 80 dollars on the dark web. And it comes with two pieces of equipment.
There was a wave, there was no wave. I don't know anymore. So the boat didn't sink. Listen to me, okay? It sank.
I don't know anymore. So the boat didn't sink. Listen to me, okay? It sank. - It did sink.
Merrick has the detonator. He's demanding that you come here or he's going to use it. - I don't have an answer. - I need to know that you haven't fixed what you did to the rocket. It has to fall!
We all have to accept our limitations. There it is. The elegant apartment of the Queen's personal secretary. -Our new home. -How much of the first floor does it occupy?
-More than 20 times. -Yes, for the technical challenge. -He escapes me. -Perhaps you're running away from yourself. That's why it's more revealing than a self-portrait.
This isn't an education project, that's for sure. It could be... An idiot. I was going to say stubborn. It's this place, this office. If you let him, he'll change it.
Elizabeth! What matters is that you're running for President, and without President Grant's support... I told you, I don't want his support. He's the leader of your party, Susan. Without him, you'll lose the election.
Madam, if you could just take one step away from the monitor... I'm literally going to kill you. What did you say? The Governor's education plan... is a failure. As a whole... It does more harm than good.
I need you to open your eyes now, okay? Tell me what the target is. Tell me where the attack will take place. I want a partner. Someone who knows the world as it is, but also someone who knows it can be improved.
What the fuck is going on here? - What happened to my car? - It arrived like that. Fuck me! It didn't get here like that.
I saw him die. - And yet he's alive. - That's not an answer. He wasn't actually terminated for misconduct. He was pulled over because Billy didn't show up.
- Wendell. - Donald. I've been thinking. This case needs to go away. - It will.
- Well, not much yet. And Weiler, the janitor... His alibi checks out. But not his social security number. It belongs to a Mamie Garcia, who died in 1988.
Let's go! Alex is gone. Dean, listen, I found an old map of the school. There's a building that used to be a swimming pool. They closed it down because it contained asbestos.
So we will dispense with the conventional rules of verification. What are you talking about? The complex case program. It's been around since 1996. When a case is deemed too complicated for a juror to understand, it is deferred to a complex litigation manager, which I happen to be.
Let's just say that this is a personal matter. Your girlfriend? I assume she was on the plane? As far as the rest of the world knows, you had nothing to do with the attack in Vietnam or the destruction of my plane. Your hands are clean and will remain so as long as you answer my questions... and provide my ship with the fuel it needs to find our men.
So what are you planning to do with that finger? Boss! You also have zombie radar. That explains a lot. Of course, you don't run around the street waiting for it to... Give a signal.
There's a note with it that says this thing is what he was working on at Borns Tech. Don't fuck with me. This? He was working on this? That's what he said.
Happy, get behind the wheel in case we have to run. They're unloading drugs from the first wave that came through. Yes, look over there. The drone that bypassed the device. We need to catch it to study it, find out how it got through.
They're not for nothing, just because they're pretty. Did you spend money on them? Just a penny. They look good in a vase on a windowsill. Yeah, well, I worked hard for my money, girl, I don't want it wasted on flowers.
I'm sure you'll be warm in prison. Let's go. Mr. President. You said this case made me think about why I became an agent. Well, that's not entirely true. It made me want to work harder.
No, you didn't, Booth. Monsters aren't real, there's nothing to be scared of. Your mother's right, but what I meant was that I wouldn't let anything happen to you. You don't believe me. He was here.
I worked with Watts in the same district for 11 years. I know him better than any of the negotiators HQ sent. So let me bring him in. Let me do it. If he puts you in danger, Trudy...
It's not about flags. Next call. I hope you don't think I'm saying this just because it's Valentine's Day, but... I love you so much. I'm going to put this in your robe. He's not moving, but I think he's still alive.
Combined with our analysis of the "ground zero" material, we are now confident that Tuwala used its entire stockpile, approximately two kilos, in the device that exploded in Virginia. What about the rest of the stolen uranium? The CIA is on it, but the trail is very cold. - Not exactly lullabies. - "Our current thinking" is that he's still on the outside.
I've never liked this swamp. I grew up here and... the kids always talked about a... monster that lived in it. The Mean Green One. The swamp itself is the monster. Do you know that if you leave a body here among the insects and bacteria, it will disappear in a matter of days?
I have very little circulation. No, my grandmother has little circulation. She has to wear a knitted cape in the fall, but you... You look like a block of ice. Well, I envy ice. At least if you give it warmth it melts.
- that you won't feel a thing. After all... I love blood! I love it! It's 92% water and contains hemoglobin, which carries oxygen through our circulatory system.
No, no! No! The Moombas have been plotting against us all this time, and you make fun of me. Look at this. The Moombas have been injected with an explosive compound, but it only reacts to a certain type of protein.
Your wife is... She's with me. But you need to know. This isn't revenge. They want a safe that one of us stole from Bin-Khalid's compound. I don't know why or what it contains.
What do you mean... Who am I? You're a mystery. I can see inside your heart. Feel the love you feel, except... He's shrouded in shame.
You know what to do. The butcher still insists on his innocence. Like all men before they die. I have something for you. Francisco was so nervous during his Coronation, his palms so sweaty, that when the Cardinal placed the sceptre in his hand, he almost slipped to the floor.
What the hell is this? It's a phone. That's right. A phone in your pocket. The next thing this guy's going to tell us is that he's from outer space.
- but it looks like it might work. - Do you have all the ingredients? All but one. That's why it's never been used. It requires the power of an archangel.
No, what would be the point? They would never achieve the same richness of flavor. Not with the fish caught in your part of the sea. Do you think our part of the sea is worse? Maybe that's why your air has a certain smell. It penetrates.
I think I could try, if I wanted to die. What are you doing? The oxygen tank was on the stretcher, instead of the side partition. Because that's where I like it. Of course, you don't mind if it goes off.
- No. Look. A horse goes into a bar. Why would a horse go into a bar? If you think that's bad, he'll talk too.
Obviously, I expect the same thing to happen here, but these two... Their vital signs are failing too, so... Right. Thank you for your time. So, Bobby and Rufus' case? Yes, he's back.
Talking about books with Lee. Having a beer. I wanted to know if he'd say anything about Kennedy, and guess what? He didn't say anything. If you mess with the past, it'll mess with you.
The baby just kicked, That makes me so happy! Again! Oh, my God! I think he wants the salami!
The ATF said it was none of our business, and it didn't end well, so... This is your game, tell it to me now, buddy. Don't waste my time. It's a top secret operation. Military weapons have been disappearing for years, so we installed these tracking chips. Not anticipating this theft, but... When it happened, it seemed like a... good opportunity to test our system.
5 million, no less. I'll fix it. Three days. Or I'll call Epifiano myself. And whatever fate has in store for you, he'll finish the job.
Let's get out of here... together. - Say it! - Okay, okay, okay. It's all right. We're off. I know you've been waiting for our last video, so here it is!
And Muldoon's story coincides with his wife's. So it's all on. Until the other shoe appeared. "Another shoe"? There's always another shoe and it always appears.
Quick, painful... It makes no difference to me. Death for me is the death of my bloodline. Any bloodline you left would have been massacred. You did your children a good service by not having them. The Antonov name... comes with a high price.
Death for me is the death of my bloodline. Any bloodline you left would have been massacred. You did your children a good service by not having them. The Antonov name... comes with a high price. It also affects my children, which is why we've been living in hiding.
It doesn't look like the heater is on. I'll check. Try going back to bed. Well? Well, I'm waiting for it to restart.
What are you doing here? - Did you track my cell phone again? - Yes, I did. Mom, that's so invasive. I paid for the phone, I can find out where it is.
Many things have changed in this profession. People are no longer interested in learning it. We don't make as much money as we used to. There isn't enough demand. Most people buy bread in stores. When we discovered bread and that it was made from this grass called wheat, wheat production skyrocketed and it became the most important grass we grew.
I prefer to put them in one at a time. I'll show you why. They're better if you slow them down a bit. I went into this with the question: "What is bread? And what's in it that's worth making again?
I'll show you why. They get better if you slow them down a bit. I went into this with the question: "What is bread? What about it is worth making again? What is it that provides sustenance?
They're better off if we slow them down a bit. I went into this with the question: "What is bread? What about it is worth making again? What is it about it that provides sustenance? What is it about it that keeps us alive?"
What were you doing back there? What were you doing back there? Hm, nothing. I, um, lost an earring. Uh, there it is.
Just because you've chosen a place doesn't mean you won't get hit in the nose. We're lucky to have you here. But you need to know what it really means to be here. Go home safely, sister. I'm not saying you went looking for this evil, but it found you.
Or I'm going to look at her one last time before she's gone forever. Tell me this isn't true. It was posted by an indigenous human rights worker in Chile. He made the same video in Spanish and in his native language. He says he's going to do a live broadcast until he reaches the summit or until he dies, whichever comes first.
Can I tell you something? I'm a simple coffee man. I was prepared to suffer in the name of diplomacy, but it's delicious. I'm not suffering at all. When the French planted coffee in Vietnam, it thrived.
Drek! A new world awaits us. And out there... we'll be gods. I threw my badge and said, "Have fun with your girlfriend" because he loves his job so much, but he didn't hit.
Why did you come here? What happened to Owen's sister? You're a friend of Owen Hunt's. I thought he'd told you. He said you put her in a helicopter and it crashed.
I've had better days, but... What brings you here? The White House asked me to do the autopsy on Brandt Walker. And I thought you might want to see this. I found wounds on his left elbow, suggesting that he had recently hit something or someone with it.
He told me the odds to make good bets. I started winning enough to keep my pride. Are you proud of cheating? Talk to Trevor. He'll tell you. I've been complaining ever since the robbery.
So far, that's the first unusual discovery. Can I add another? The road is straight. Babish would have seen the bus a thousand meters away. So why were you on the road when it passed?
Free. Clear. Looks like the Babish need a new decorator. It looks like Jared Zorn was here looking for his laptop. If he was here, he's gone now.
If this isn't Storybrooke or the Enchanted Forest, where are we? Well, wherever it is, I'd rather not stay too long to find out. Can you... use your wand to take us back to Storybrooke? Not really. Then we're stuck in this mysterious realm. - Whatever it is.
Incoming. The cell phone isn't with them. - What's wrong? - It's not moving. He's still in the house.
Let's conquer the world! Now, I want to welcome my son and descendant, the incomparable Jamal Lyon, to the stage to perform for the first time since he faced death! These are very difficult times. There are a lot of bad things happening. I wrote this song and it means a lot to me. I hope it touches you all.
- This is from the Supporters' Fund. It's the only money we have. When the partners find out we're going to use it for the deal, they'll come after it. So you have about an hour to sign on the dotted line, or the money is gone forever. Look around you, Arlene. Because when it's gone, there won't be any left.
Dolls? Why do you want my dress size? You're wearing this on the winter solstice. - Cool. What does it do?
- Alex! You've made a serious mistake. If you were anyone else, you wouldn't be suspended, you'd be fired. I won't talk about it here anymore. Church and state. My baby is dying, he's not getting any blood, and he's going to die.
If you detect changes in what you monitor... Cabum. The bomb explodes. What kind of changes are we talking about? Any one, choose an application. Change the GPS, - change the altitude... - It explodes.
You said the test came out. How do I know if it's worth anything? We're running out of time. But we can show you the results. - The test, it compares your...
Even before I was born. If you let true love wake you up, maybe you won't lose so much. We can talk about this at home. I'll come back. But I won't be making a home next to you. Our son gave me a warning and I'm going to listen to him.
- That's right, Emma. You're not the first savior I've come across. Where there's a savior, there's a villain to defeat him. That's how savior stories unfold. So who is he?
Believe me. Besides, if we're voting on names, I like "Fantochito", the little puppet. Okay. "Fantochito"? That nickname makes no sense. He's not scary at all.
- Oh. Looks like we're going to have company. Hello, Roza, come and join us. The most pressing problem is the need to repair the truck. Without it, we can't leave for the villages and start with the vaccinations.
I noticed that you checked in a laptop last week, but it's not in the evidence locker. Any idea where it could be? It says I signed in again. Yes, it was on Wednesday. Well, then it must be there somewhere.
We'd like it that way, I think. Walling ourselves off from the world. But after she died, I stayed in that pain... until I reached a point where I realized that I had to... get rid of the ghost, so to speak, or... Or what? Or it would become what it is.
I used to think you were smarter. Let's say you're zebras. You need to learn to face the lion, but you don't want to end up on the menu. What does the zebra's brain do? It uses nightmares to simulate conflict.
- Yes, really. Let's not have Lucifer fighting inside Cass. What if he can't? Dean, he's a strong vessel. He's held Cass for years, and we know what he's been through.
But I don't know how you got your speed. Before I was in this life, I drove illegal cars. I had a new nitro that increased the acceleration of my engine. One night I raced under a storm and my car was struck by lightning. It must have mixed with the nitro, because...
- but I did it. - Excellent work, Jax. - What's going on? - I'm flying us on a collision course against that torpedo. With luck, it'll hit us before New York.
Do you want to come? No, thanks. I have some things to read. All right, maybe when I get back we can go for a drive. If he still has the wheel.
She tried to kill me. I don't have much time. And I need answers. Your sister Alex is insisting that I open the safe. I need to know what's in it.
I hope you didn't bring me here to complain... how unfair life is. No. I find it boring too. There's a book I want. We found out where it was... In the hands of another Grimm. A Mr. Josef Nebojsa, in Prague.
Can I try it? Sheriff? Matt and Emmy just called. They said they saw fog in the Jasper Hills area. Did they say where it was heading?
I think you and I need to have a long talk. If Amara erases the painting, everything will be destroyed. My partner and I have seen this before, right? Wes, Deputy Harris has been infected by something in this fog. The amulet... it glows brightly in the presence of God.
The final days shouldn't worry you, Row. You're a rat. You'll find your way onto any sinking ship. You bet. The spell I'm working on is magic from the Book of the Damned, and it can take us back.
- I don't know. They've hidden it somewhere secret. Him fixing me is just the beginning! I want an army. I want an army like me! - And he's going to give it to me.
- Controlling the climate. I think we've lost Walt. He's gone mad for good. A tornado needs hot air to exist, doesn't it? Without it, it's over.
We need instant data. I can't provide that. Ralph can. Ralph, you need to connect your software to the satellite. If it downloads the Library of Congress in 5.9 seconds, it can give us the data in real time.
Did you take such a risk for a bag of bones? They prove the origin of the artifacts. Some can't be sold without others. But this booty, especially the gold ring that everyone wants, must be in the other bag. And you don't know where it is?
Thank you. Thank you. Where's Boyd's body? That's a good question. I'm sure they exhumed the coffin, right? Boyd's name was in the drawer he came out of.
Like a bully who makes you fight. If we get to the white shoe office in Long Beach, I'll be able to hack into their server and see if I can find a way to stop the hacker's signal. Then I'll tell the authorities in the other cities how to do it, we'll kill the signal simultaneously and regain control of the ships. Toby, I left my car in Tahoe, Paige left hers at home, I'll need yours. Okay, but it was washed in 2008, be careful with it.
I saw how he handles your cheese. - You're an idiot. - No, I'm just hurt and angry. Do you have any idea how I feel? It's like you grabbed my heart and ripped it out of my body, then threw it aside... And now it's there, covered in flies.
I saw some of Krieger's men studying his map. That must be where Krieger plans to make the exchange. Nate overheard Krieger talking about making a trade on something called the Askaran amulet. Hitler has been hoarding ancient artifacts like that. He might want the amulet because it could have occult powers.
Grab the handcuff keys. Alpha stabilizer damaged. The suit won't work. They took my amulet. - And without it I think you're just...
I think I can save him with this. Is that the Nazi serum that created that monster? Are you crazy? I've made some adjustments to the formula, so... - What's he going to do now?
And armor is only as strong as the man who wears it. I don't want to shoot you. I love ninjas. It was the armor's relay. It slowed down the limbs' response time.
He'll tell me. Otherwise, I'll kill you outright. Now put that iron down and start talking. The ore in there? It's rare.
Actually, Jonah... I'm glad you decided to pay me this little visit. You know, I've been working on something. It seems that the ore I've discovered... It has special qualities.
Gray! Gray? That's not a reaction to time travel. - What did you just see? - A woman. Someone I've never met, but her face, it keeps... appearing in my mind.
Some people like to call him "the peacemaker". But I don't care about peace. Yes, thanks to what I got out of this mine, I have my own weapon now. Something that will tip the balance. And win the west back for the people it belongs to.
That's what you are. But that's not all you are. - What do you mean? - Don't deny this animal. But don't let it control you either.
Actually, there are three of us. It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Malcolm Merlyn. Well done. The new suit is good, but I think it needs the modifications Cisco mentioned.
No, thank you. I was never meant for these things, and I know that now. And besides, you can't just go back and change things like that. Why not? Because Time is sacred, and it can't be changed to satisfy one person's desire without hurting the lives of countless others.
Yes, in Lars' apartment! Remember the books about The Thousand and One Nights? I think that symbol was in one of the books. Yes. Here it is.
When it comes to internal investigations, however, they manage to lose their objectivity. Well, I don't envy you. That's probably why I chose this job. Nobody argues with me here. Although this case seems more complicated than usual, it turns out to be quite simple.
-Right. Shall we recap? -Please. According to Caleb, this cell phone will ring at 8am sharp. As it has built-in GPS, it will only work in this specific park.
Michael has a condition called Long Chain Acyl CoA Dehydrogenase, or LCADD. I know that's a lot of words, but what it basically boils down to is that he can't process fat. So... When, uh, the body can't use fat for energy, it relies on glucose, but there's only a limited amount available.
- Your X-ray. - Yes. Uh, the blow didn't cause any significant damage. He said. It did show something else.
I can make my own drink. We're going to see Baker soon. Make sure we're ready. Sir. The reason to buy this car is that it's smooth. It has monstrous performance.
That won't be necessary. Let's go. The flowers say, "I'm grateful for your greatness, even though I suck at showing it". And what does the vase say? It says "I misjudged the weight of a bunch of flowers and knocked over the original vase when I grabbed it".
Man, being a cop is like having homework every night for the rest of your life. I take the opportunity to write what I think, and improve my perception. What was that? The button that opens the trapdoor under your chair. It helps me.
Traitor! There's no one here to help you, Dad. This is your fate, alone and unloved. I don't need your love. It's worthless.
Winds 2-7-0-1-0. Altimeter 2-9-9-2. Take-off warning 125.15. Have a nice day. It seems that every time we put the country back together, it falls apart again.
You're an American, Colonel. Back off. Go ahead. Take me, it doesn't matter. Someone else will take my place, someone who sees the world as it is and will seize the opportunity.
I don't want my baby to die. - Darling, everything's going to be all right. - Can we talk outside? - If this baby is born now... - It has to be born.
Dr. Russo, I told you to stop. Robbins, I'm almost done with the C-section. But you're not going to finish it. Can someone explain to me what's going on? Tara and Jenny, I'm going to put the baby back so it can develop more.
Are you saying you think that will happen again? That was different. How was that different? Love certainly has its limits. I saw where it ends.
No. So my baby's going to die? No. April, no. It means he's not getting all the blood he needs, and... We need to take it out right away, to relieve the pressure on the umbilical cord.
- Okay. Why don't you come into my office? - Why don't you come into my office? Let's see. A dead fetus? I'm sure if you water it, it'll recover.
My colleague was having a crisis. What was she saying? How my book changed your perspective on sex. That's right. It activated a button inside me, and I haven't been the same since.
And for that we have to find out where this evil spirit came from. There are good spirits and bad ones too. If we want to find out the witch's name or where she's from. Then only a good spirit can tell us who she is. This lemon will stop rolling when it finds a good spirit who can help us.
All my life I've tried to atone for your shit and do something decent for myself. Why do you insist on dragging me down with you? It's not going to happen. They'll kill me. I lose this money, it's localized...
Together. I went to Bali while he was finishing his promotional tour and waited for him. But he never showed up. I went my own way. He went his own way and... eventually withdrew completely. And now he's back.
Well... more or less. The problem is that I can't find the gene. What do you mean... you can't find the gene? It's not a bunch of keys. How do you even know it exists?
It's not a bunch of keys. How do you even know it exists? Where there's a plant, there's a seed, right? And you, my friend, are a very confused plant, which means that somewhere inside you, there's a very confused gene. Although I can't see it, I can feel it, I know it's there.
- And if we don't go there... - Barry! That's why speedsters don't go to the future. No one should know their future. Just as there are several Earths in the Multiverse, there are infinite possibilities in the future. It's always bending and changing.
Uriel! I thought it would be you. Welcome to Earth. Clearly, I have all the fashion sense in the family. A word of advice, I'd get rid of that long coat, because it's not cool, aneglical brother, it's more like "Pedophiles".
Let's say the detective finds her and takes her home... She'd be killed for not tidying up. That's why the detective can't be part of the investigation. I need you two to move Uriel's body. Somewhere where he won't be found this time.
You can. No problem. I'm trying to get off the painkillers myself. I have a map. It helps me find my way around.
Let's get back to that annoying word... "must". This is new territory. I can't promise that the spell will last forever. There's no known magic for that. But it will last.
Magda, I know it doesn't seem like it now, but... you'll be fine. You can do it. You're going to do it. Just remember, that power... It doesn't control you.
- No sulfur. - No EMF either. Maybe bags of spells? Yeah, you know. Antique store full of old stuff. Maybe the guy had a cursed object in his hand... and he went into action, starting to kill everyone.
Yes, I think so. According to Marv's records, the watch belonged to a member of Hitler's inner circle. - Where is he now? - I don't know. The police didn't report finding it. And I have a small bet that it's not out there and probably not in here.
He's joking, right? He's joking, right? This is... this is a joke. Let's go back to the part where your father is going to resurrect Adolph Hitler. After the safe house, the Thule agents who were going to smuggle Hitler's soul were killed by the Soviets. - So you lost your watch. - I didn't lose it. It ended up with a Russian family.
After the safe house, the Thule agents who were going to smuggle Hitler's soul were killed by the Soviets. - So you lost your watch. - I didn't lose it. It ended up with a Russian family. Then the Thule tracked it to China and then Peru. Then it ended up in that antique store.
You've done so many things. But now? Now all you want is to relive your glory days with Hitler. Your generation... your millennium... are too weak to lead the future. It needs a stronger hand.
I came to this meeting because you looked good in the photos, but I'm not feeling it. Right, you know what? We're not here for a meeting. Tonight's Vince concert. Where is it?
Again. The muse... I think she's taken powder. Relax, Russell. Tonight's concert? He's going to kill.
These images... The level of violence is completely unnecessary. Lucifer doesn't like to be messed with. I think that when the archbishop's priests saw that he was possessed, they tried to keep him quiet and perform an exorcism. I mean, not that it worked.
Have you seen it too? You know we have to keep our options open. The heart knows what the heart knows. And what does your heart know about me? I know it likes you.
There's enough here to say goodbye to the year. I mean opium. What's that? So far, it's helped us hold on. But when it's gone, we must be strong, very strong.
It was a foster home until ten years ago, but before that it was an insane asylum. I mean, you should hear about the lobotomy labs on the third floor. - Noah, focus. - Right. It was closed down after an abuse scandal.
Ready? Yes, I'm ready. I'm ready. You're on a rocket. He's at his peak.
Swagger must be released from prison with protection and put into the general population. He's the best-known prisoner in the world. I can't transfer him with magic. Here. Put this in the ventilation system. Turn it on, it'll do the rest.
Do I need to continue? I understand that you've spent the last decade of your life with the code of conduct hammered into your head, but that doesn't help you win this war. And I know you know that, or you wouldn't have moved to a position of command. Surprised, you've read my dossier. Of course I read it, and he tells me that deep down he wants to make a difference.
Just... let's go. We can't just leave. Forget I said anything. Next time. It was the first time we caught an animal with the triple helix, before it caused an environmental catastrophe.
Forget the Black Question. Don't write voting rights. It's something we already have. It's called the 5th Constitutional Amendment. What we have to pay attention to in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is what's going on in this country, and what's going on is that a brother killed a brother knowing that he was his brother.
Kingston will sell enough weapons to start a war. We need to find him. Can't you use your magic phone? I beg your pardon? It won't work if they change the board?
Let's find her. Well, look, I didn't want to tell you this, but in some research I did yesterday, I discovered that there are some native nations and cultures that have a demon called the Skinwalker. It's a kind of pure spirit. It doesn't cause evil on its own, but when it possesses a human body, it can cause horrible things. If the body dies, it frees itself.
It gives off smoke, but it's dormant. So it's asleep, but not dead. So when it explodes, many megatons of energy will be released. What do you mean "explode"? We'll use the HAARP transmitter. If we turn the beam on the right frequency, it excites the magma.
Do what you can to minimize the consequences at the station. - I want everyone on it. - Yes, ma'am. Nichols is almost on site. HAARP should be ready when the device is in place. Understood, ma'am. It will be ready.
We believe that it communicates with the sharks around it by overloading the circuits in the ampullae of Lorenzini. But sharks don't use their sensory organs until they bite their prey, and they need to be close for it to work. It's not like their sense of smell. Ampoules are actually quite weak, so the fact that our shark is transmitting electromagnetic signals to a shark that it would detect at a great distance... It must have a very powerful energy-transmitting organ.
- Katie! The show only aired during the murders. Now the show is back. You've been out of a psychiatric ward for three days. He did something to my brother.
- I have to go. I read that you witnessed the murder and I thought I'd come and see if you were all right. Jacob Appley was my patient. It was a shock for the whole town. You talk as if he did it, when he didn't.
What do you mean my trapdoor has a legal problem? And while you're explaining, please take two steps back. The old trap door was perfectly within the law. It was protected by the Reagan-era code. But as soon as you started renovating it, it has to adapt to modern standards.
It's at the back. It's fine. Try not to scratch it. Close the door. There's a dog inside, but it won't bite.
Below the protons, they found the quarks. And below the quarks, they found the threads. And the threads aren't even particles. They're just vibrations of energy. We think the world is so solid. And suddenly it melts.
The launch of Daedalus It was the start of our historic 7-month journey to Mars. But getting to the red planet wasn't easy. We needed visionaries to guide the way. Mars and Earth are sister planets. Young Mars had rivers and lakes, even an ocean.
They had been test pilots and flown in the early age of jet engines, and more than a few of them died. Challenger now heads downrange. Obviously a major defect, we have no downlink. Sometimes painful things like that happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. The future does not belong to the faint-hearted, it belongs to the brave.
Watching movies with him and just kind of hanging out. It's like the things that don't seem important at the time, but when it comes to them being gone you realize they're the most important. I saw his report card. Yes. He was good.
Marta is preparing the drones to start lava tubes for ice and the geology we need to deploy the dome. Javier is optimizing WAVARs for water. And Robert is doing everything he can for Environmental to keep the air breathable. But the mods for the workshop are already in the electrical system. We'll be lucky if it supports us for 8 months, assuming Amelie can stop this crew from disintegrating.
It was the devil. You're just jealous. - Because you want the book for yourself. - You're absolutely right. I want it so I can destroy it before it destroys us!
- Why won't he die? - Because you can't kill him. Just like Regina couldn't kill me. And now he knows it, so if you don't want to spend the rest of your days strangling him... And the necklace? There it is.
She's all right, isn't she? No. Things are worse. The demon can move things. He can hurt people.
You know, as children, when we were sad, our elders told us not to cry. When we were angry they said give us a smile. Do you know why? Just to keep the peace at home. When we wanted to hate we weren't allowed to. So now when we want to love we suddenly find that our whole emotional system is a mess. It can't function.
Where is it? Somewhere safe. Okay, I'll go, but I'm going alone. The cave is deep, with lots of paths and turns. How can you know where he is now?
I went back to the Goff house. Remember it had a shed? Not anymore. It was destroyed at some point.
Trial and error after trial and error adjusting the technology. You can't expect a reorganization like this to work out of the blue the first time. Why is Flynn altering our portal? He's trying to use it to find Charlene. - Can he do that?
- How beautiful. - Can you believe it? Good. Eleven more suckers like you and I'll have the jury in my hand. I never realized that this building is restricted. Maybe it's because it is restricted.
"Are we dead or alive?" "Are we tired or vigorous?" "Are we healthy or sick?" "Are we good or bad?" "Do we still have time or is it over?"
I have to check the drains. If you find my love life down there, give it back to me. Han, the hurricane isn't coming, man. My body always knows when disaster is approaching. It predicted El Niño in 1997, and my third wife, Diane.
- I know you think so. And I'm asking you to trust me. Dembe says you have a lead on Agnes. A few years ago, I had a tricky encounter with a bull shark while snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef. I think he was trying to be affectionate, a bit cheeky even.
No, the inside is like your thoughts. It's what makes you... you. We call it "stuffing" and the stuffing lives on. Can we see Maw Maw's stuffing? No, but it's good to know that it's out there. Now, let's go to sleep.
Should I be afraid? - I don't know. Maw stuffing, should we be afraid of you? Yes, be afraid of me! Maybe if we ignore Maw Maw's stuffing, it'll get tired and go away.
Quiet! My delicious delicate hooves! This Crood is out of control! My poor hair. Come on, it'll grow back.
Look, an egg. Nice try, but we're the best egg collectors. Right, brother? Ovally right, brother. We broke an imaginary egg and it exploded.
Do you want me to stop us falling out? Are you saying you can't? I'm alive! And the egg is all mine. I'm sure it's mine.
But until then, purple mucus. Right, that's it. Now let's save lives in dramatic style. Not yet. A layer of mud protects us from the sun, making it think we're earth.
Outside? Please don't leave me alone. We can play any game you like. I know a game. It's called "hunter-prey".
Why? I know why. You can do this. But the way he treats love, he finds it, I can feel him sniffing it out and twisting it. That's what he's doing with Casey's soul.
So, we all know that the beehive pattern on Jane's right hand was made with two different types of paint. Last night I was teaching the girls programming, and that's when I started thinking about these two types of tones. How they would look on the computer. - Ones and zeros. Yes, code girl. When you follow the pattern of each shade, it goes around the whole tattoo.
The fastest way to send Gregorio and the FBI back to the Capital is to eliminate the cartel. And the fastest way to do that is to work together. I'm really sorry. I'm still trying to keep up. When you finish a case, isn't it reviewed?
I was confirmed as an Anglican. CONFIRMATION GROUP So a lot of things were happening to me emotionally and spiritually. But I didn't do anything at the time to distance myself publicly, especially as the book died down somewhat. Sales dropped a lot. The media weren't interested. And I thought it would go away quietly.
With my wife, I've been supporting schools around the world to become more inclusive for kids with special needs. So what's the connection between the needs of these special needs kids and my desire to see the Cookbook come out of print? The Cookbook has been found in the possession of alienated and disturbed young people who launch attacks on classmates and teachers. I suspect that the perpetrators of these attacks felt left out and that the Cookbook may have contributed to their isolation. It should go out of print quietly."
The shield belongs to me. That's ridiculous! The Captain was frozen in ice with it before you were born. And it has that wonderful red, white and blue paint job. Which makes me think it's not yours.
Are you better? Your screen got stuck. Do you need help? The tablet has a fault in the EO-52 operating system. If it locks up or you forget your password, click the power button three times, sliding it to the left. It turns on, skips the login and takes you directly to the command screen.
Aram, we need to know what's on the train. I'm in front of you, sir. Only there's no train. I mean, there's no train - scheduled on that line at this hour. - Well, there it is!
It's trying to transmit. I can't hold it! I've got it. I hit it! Do you think he sent a signal?
Oh God! The other thing you get for your money is a team of mechanics. But unfortunately... it doesn't have a handbrake. Right, what I've done now is that I've taken... yes... I've taken off the steering wheel, and so I can't put a gear in to stop it going.
- And it costs 1.8 million pounds? - Yes. How much is that, Jeremy, in Rand? Ten hundred and thirty million and one million. But with that it does 0-100 in 2.9 seconds?
I think the terrorists will notice this attack. That's why I'm going to distract them now. I'm going to make doughnuts in front of the plane to distract the terrorists. Oh, no, that's a disaster. Even when you turn off the traction control, it's not totally off So you only get lots of understeer
With the queen finally in the car, we had a very dangerous drive to the embassy ahead of us. However, this meant that I could get back to my work. Let me tell you about the car. This is the S8 Plus. What's more, it has 80 more horsepower than the standard car.
He's not brown in the same way that my car is green. It's brown. Your car is a BMW 7 series convertible. No, it's not. But is it a 7 Series underneath?
- I know I do. I hate ladders, I hate bats. Many hours later, and without any help from Spider-Man, the roof was removed and the bat was free. But was it really? Why doesn't it just come out and live there?
I don't care how many stars he gives Oxfam Whitby, I'm not going there. Exactly. Anyway... I went to Trip Advisor, okay? And there was a comment there about Whitby And he said, and I'm going to quote
- And a small screwdriver to repair the glasses. - He does. He does - No, I don't No, he lives in a... He only has a small bag
It's basically a bush. Better still, it's growing because I planted it all so it has all the nutrients it needs to let my car bloom and flourish. I don't... I don't wash this car, I water it. It's alive.
Test pilots use specialized equipment. But that looks perfectly solid to me. That roof is... James, even taking into account the limitations of the material you've used, your car looks like crap. But look how it blends in with the environment.
Well, apart from your tragic tents, - That's not so bad. - It's all right. It's amazing, isn't it? My car, the way it disappears into the hedge, it's not just camouflage, it's hedge.
- It means... It means hitting the wall of the Taj Mahal with your sausage. -Oh, God! Anyway, listen. We're in Rotterdam, which is a wonderful city, really, because you're not allowed to bring a car into the city - a gasoline car - if it was built before 1992. You're not allowed to bring a diesel car into the city if it was built before 2000, which means you never have to hang out with poor people.
- This is. - No, it's not. Look, I'm not saying this is perfect, because it's not. There's a vertical choppiness to the ride, which is annoying. If you put the phone in front of the gear lever and then accelerate, it shoots under the seat.
This bear, for example. I know about bears. It's an acrylic fiber, filled with industrial waste. 2.75 €. But, because it has a Honda T-shirt on, £10.
Out of this insane calendar came this. The Ford GT. Thanks to its sleek shape and body that stood just 40 inches tall, it promised to cut through the air like a missile. Add a 4.2L V8, and the magic target of 200 mph seemed in the bag. The problem is that a racing car is a collection of hopes and dreams until it gets on the track.
I prefer to think I'm tall, but I'm still hemming my pants. I should have known what I was getting myself into. Don't blame yourself. - You've never lived with anyone. It's like getting your first pet and it being...
It's complicated. No. The truth isn't complicated. I don't know what the truth is anymore. Okay, the truth is that she didn't believe Rittenhouse until President Nixon confirmed it. But for now, if Rittenhouse wants this document so badly, whatever it is, I want it first.
I took aim and fired. In the water it sounded like a dry hit, but the harpoon went right through the water. I had already hit six of them with quick blows, shots to the tail. So I knew that this last predator was mine. And the destruction he had caused was over.
And you owe me, what could be a complicated place to be? We owe you. It doesn't make any sense, I saw the results of De's DNA test thirty years ago. Clearly, he's wrong.
I bet I liked hearing that. Yes, one night I saw a monkey in the street. My old vices led me to go out very late. But this night, there he was.
My old vices led me to go out very late. But this evening, there he was. He was sitting on the sidewalk, under a lamp. First he looked at me and then he ran off between the buildings. But before that, he looked at me as if to say: "You know." I'm not even sure he was real, but, like him, I knew that anyone walking down the street at 3.30am was someone who had made bad choices.
It's never stopped them before. They're getting ready to call Ohio. Citizens United gave us clear support for American freedom. Said the Prince of K Street. You only think money is a speech because it pays you.
What will happen to her? Possession is like a virus. Well, you know that. The more aggressive the attack, the more damage it does to the body. It will force her to surrender.
All the more reason to keep her away. You saw how it woke up when she was here. She can help us show the demon. Bait for the whale. You never give a demon what it wants.
Which means that Wilson had to leave work, drive to Sherwood Beach, meet Maggie, kill her, take the body to the woods, dig a 1 by 1.5 m hole, bury the body, clean the evidence from the car, clean the evidence from himself, all in an hour and a half, something I can assure you is impossible, because I just tried to do it. Okay. Yes? What if "their place" was actually in the woods, and not on the beach? What if he lied about it?
The old politicians believed that crises could be resolved through negotiation and promotion. The bankers had a completely different view. They were merely the representatives of something that could not be negotiated: the logic of the market. there was no alternative to this system. They were supposed to lead society through a single transaction.
he gave the weak what the strong don't have. And that is their ability to turn their bodies into bombs like the Palestinians do. Hamas continued to send bombers into Israel on consecutive days. The horror has made Israeli society desperate and it has completely destroyed the ability of politics to resolve the Palestinian crisis.
Tell me everything. We'll never be able to keep them away from the embassy. So let's invite them in. Mac, I'm still a bit confused about how detergent is going to help us move this. Because it changes the coefficient of friction.
Inside the book. I can... 162."I knew then that the demon would never rest, "he would never stop until he had Regan for himself". "He would come for her, until the end of time."
I'll keep your rebel base a secret. No deal. You're not getting out of here in one piece. I've placed a beacon near here. Hit me and it will activate... revealing your presence to the Empire.
Can you see it? There. It takes them a week to see the new species for the first time, and even then, for less than a second. There seems to be only one dolphin. To frustrate you, it can appear anywhere without warning.
Food is so scarce in the desert that, even at night, the animals can't choose what they eat. Negev Desert in Israel. Otonícteris (Otonycteris hemprichii), the long-eared bat is on the hunt. Most bats catch insects from the air, but there are so few flying insects in the desert that this bat has developed a different technique. It hunts on the ground.
At dawn in the Namib dunes, something magical is happening. The humid air over the nearby Atlantic Ocean cools and moves towards the continent, forming fog banks that shroud the desert in mist. This precious moisture sits tantalizingly unreachable on top of the dunes, and it won't last long. It will be dissipated by the sun a few hours after it rises. Dark beetles race to the top of the dunes to reach the fog before it disappears.
It will be dispelled by the sun a few hours after it rises. Dark beetles race to the top of the dunes to reach the fog before it disappears. Some dunes in Namibe are 300 meters high, the highest in the world. For a beetle smaller than a thumbnail, it's like climbing a dune twice as high as Everest. But the most impressive thing is what it does afterwards.
But the most impressive thing is what it does afterwards. Completely still, facing the wind, the beetle does a headstand. Fog begins to condense on its body. Microscopic elevations direct the water into grooves that channel it towards its mouth. Before descending the dune, it will have drunk 40% of its body weight.
The fog begins to condense on your body. Microscopic elevations direct the water into grooves that channel it towards his mouth. Before descending the dune, it will have drunk 40% of its body weight. This little beetle has learned to extract water from the air in one of the driest places on Earth. And it's not the only one at the top of the dunes.
This is the newest habitat on Earth. It is here that animals have to face the biggest change happening on our planet. In this decade, the urban habitat is expected to grow by almost 30%. It may seem hostile to animal life, but for the brave it's a world of amazing opportunity.
Something hot-blooded. There you go. A leopard. Look at this. It knows I'm here.
Sooner or later, you're going to die in a stinking room with one of those things on top of you. I know the cost. Then why? The demon. When he died.
- I'm doing some research. Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in bad taste? Yes. Do you think it's in bad taste? Does he spin and maneuver?
Would you like a Turtle? Do you want a chocolate with nuts called Turtle? Or an Almond Roca or something? You can check with the guide. It says so on the lid.
- Yes, Dad? - Watch. It's important that you see this. No! - Don't hurt them in front of me. - John, what did I say about seeing the world as it really is?
I can't say any more right now. I saw the plane crash into the building. Everything has changed. From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime. The only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our lives is to stop it, eliminate it and destroy it, wherever it appears.
- or what you were looking for... - The Eye of Ra! - The Eye of Ra? - Where was it last seen? - What does it look like?
Well, he likes American soccer, ribs, and he goes to church. Well, I used to date him. What, are you crazy? Dating a guy like that is like buying a car that's been in a brutal accident. You think everything's fine, and one day, you turn on the ignition, and it's drowned.
No, it's not trouble Mike, it's over. - Well, who broke up with who? - No, she dumped him. And... I can't understand it. I mean, if I was going to create the perfect boyfriend for Eve, you know, like... like in a lab, maybe with parts of other people and personalities, he... would be Rob.
Say hello to my large and somewhat clumsy friend. I think I'll call her Annette. Let's see if it works. Ready? I don't know if he'll catch the drone, but he'll do some damage. Seeking safety in the forgotten corners of the city, he comes here in the early evening to rest.
It is powered by lithium polymer batteries. It has a safety switch. If I leave the board, it cuts the power to all the motors simultaneously. Inside this protection is the board's brain. It has a radio receiver, which receives the signal from my transmitter. It sends them to the flight controller.
Inside this protection is the brain of the board. It has a radio receiver, which receives the signal from my transmitter. It sends them to the flight controller. The flight controller has a three-axis accelerometer. At ten o'clock. With the data sensor and my commands, it controls the eight motors simultaneously...
Cover with stem cell material, cover with paint and apply the laser for ten minutes. Laser on. I've done some strange things, but covering a pig's colon is up there. There, it's sealed. He farted.
Yes! Here's the hoverboard! Thank you. I spent many nights and weekends working on it and almost gave up. The hardest part is taking off, because you have to give it enough momentum to get off the ground. And if I'm not careful, it sends me right into the ceiling.
Except in the bedroom. Christie wouldn't accept that. My pool cleaner has gone mad. No, I'm serious. He jumps out of the pool on his own.
John? That's the payment. Put the boat down and don't delay. Have you seen him? Is he down there?
Thank you, sir. So... The microphone more to the side, please. Up? Where is it?
- Did you unlock any books? Yes, I'm sorry. It's around here somewhere, I dropped it... I'll put it back and we'll get out of here. - Look! There it is.
It's the Abominable Snowman. That's not his name by chance. And it just came out of a book. It's an inexplicable thing! I'm going to find Hannah! I read what he did in Pasadena.
What are you doing? Let go of me! No, stop! You don't understand. The only solution is to stick it in the book! - Let go of the book and let it suck you in!
Pure skill. Mastery! It belonged to my great-grandmother. 1890. I want to take it apart and scatter it all over the floor. And no offense to your great-grandmother, but I see a watch like that and I want to know what it looks like inside.
Yes, they're like TV, but for intelligent people. You see, what we're looking at here is time. Geological time. Hundreds of thousands of years of movements shifting the tectonic plates. It's as if the world is being reborn from below while it's being eroded from above.
- I don't know. Did it work? Where did you get this from? This egg is the symbol of rebirth. Where did it come from?
Where's your wedding ring? Oh my God. Did you take the ring off before we got here? No, Rusty! It was wide
Listen, Michael, Metro Capital backed you four years ago, when you were a doctor with a tiny website and some inherited money. We all made quite a profit. Stick to stocks. You know me. Me, I look for value wherever it can be.
Hold your horses, my Russian friend. We may be engaged, but I'm an independent woman. Besides, I wouldn't be wearing my engagement ring. Remember? It's just been stolen.
A long time ago there was a girl called Ella. She didn't always see the world as it was, but as it could be, with just a little magic.
They entered through the cracks that Dr. Patterson opened. She's special. It's easy to create a victim. You trap a person in darkness, and they begin to suffer. And then you feed that suffering methodically and precisely, so that it lasts.
That's right, Matt. Hyde has been a box office monster with 450 million dollars worldwide, five nominations, including Best Picture and two for actors. And that surprise of the year, a nomination for Best Supporting Actor for Johnny Chase. What did I tell you, Turtle? You visualize success and it happens.
I can't even say it's your fault. I mean, a man does what he has to do to survive. But, uh... With all the loggers and hunters out there, it upsets the balance. Look, this bear, he's... it's not just territorial, or it's hungry...
Yes, I'm getting ready. Will the transport still arrive at zero seven hundred? - The bus? - The bus, I'm sorry. Yes! No, it usually arrives at 7:00.
Forget it. I have an idea. All we'll need is... My plane! There it is!
God, if one more wonderful face comes out of there, I don't think I'll be able to stand it. Oh. There you go. I really can't. - Look who it is.
Well, you have a good eye. I assure you they are the best. - I have a confession to make. - A confession? Yes. As wonderful as the horse was, it would never make it over the dunes in the desert. Yes?
Listen, miss. I don't know where that attitude came from... Do you want a piece of this, Daddy? Come and get it! Do you? Well... Here he comes.
Some men don't like roses. Closer. Now tell me something interesting. About the mystery. Treat this world as it deserves.
Zoso. Can they? No, they're too big to fit through there. But a mouse can. If there's a mouse here, it's still around.
How many days did you say it was? 301. 301. We weren't supposed to be here for a day. But when we needed it most, we found this shelter. And it gave us food, a home, a life.
I don't want to go. Why do you have to go? The man from the government. He said... the virus. It changes people drastically.
Who is this son of a bitch? I'm sick of you! Don't fuck with my head, fuck off! I want to know who it is! Tell me who he is!
God, what am I doing here? I just want to go home. Okay, I know there has to be another tunnel. There's no way they could have gotten out of here, unless there's another tunnel. And where would it be?
Don't leave. I can't finish the field alone. From the finished field, Pa. I sowed. It will take care of itself.
That's exactly what I wanted to use in the book. Chris, it's not easy to relate to someone accused of four murders. But everyone understands a child who wants a toy. And the teddy bear running out... It's as if he died when she did.
Spectacular, right? And finally, Stu, Stu-art, Super-Stu. I have the most brutal invention of all time. The hypnotizing hat! You can hypnotize anyone with it.
- Hi, what can I do for you? - Jules got her Saint Laurent jacket dirty. Can you take it to the studio? They have lots of cleaning products there. - Sure, where is it?
Look at the legs. Three joints. The eyes, teeth... Whatever it is, it's like a... hybrid between man and wolf. It's wearing a ring. Oh, look. He used to be like us.
Captain! That was really dramatic. I'm sorry about that. I know you mean well. But you haven't thought it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change.
The genie is out of the bottle. The most pressing problem is Ultron. I don't get it. You built this program. Why is he trying to kill us?
Charlotte... it would be difficult for you to understand the depth of the problems I've gotten myself into, or to talk about the guilt that accompanies me and has tormented me, of not having realized the scale of this monster called the East India Company. In its greed and avarice, it led its empire down a path of destruction around the globe. At the time, and over time, there was an investigation. Which finally resulted in this report. It has a lot to say about Charles Kemp and, I'm afraid, about me too.
Mr. Flack? What have you found? A Leyden jar. - Do you know it? - It stores an electrical impulse.
And all of you: To bed at 6 o'clock sharp. And fish soup three times a day. This is disgusting. - I have an eye in mine. He's looking at me.
A girl and a book. Mommy... What are you talking about? This book is fabulous. It has the power to determine who will be a master hypnotist, and it will choose me.
Rey... Help me with this. Hurry up! Whoa, what's wrong? Sir... we couldn't recover the droid on Jakku. He escaped in a stolen Corellian YT model ship.
You'll be relieved to know that I don't know. You still want to kill me. That happens when you're chased by a masked creature. Tell me about the droid. It's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal thruster. It carries part of a navigation map.
Everything's broken. - Do you mind if I go to the toilet? - Why should I mind? I have a feeling the balance may be lost. Where is he now?
The ladies are talking, sir. Meet my brother, Cornelis. Tell us about the system we've developed. The system. I'm with him here.
- I want a baby. - A baby? Really? - Yes! I think that if we have a child to love, it will teach us to love each other again.
- Lizzie. This is bullshit, okay? We have a safe full of nitro here. Where'd it go? Where did it go?
I read a book. Was it a dictionary? No, it was a book called "Predestino". Okay, I don't care. With predestination, it says that there is a force or something that controls things and prepares everything so that it is put perfectly in...
Jacob, it's okay. No... No. Our nitro had disappeared, because it didn't exist yet. But if Adam took the nitro to the past, then it exists here, in the future.
Hey! Where are you going? People are shooting at each other. I'm getting out of here. Here's the thing, Soph, I've seen our future together and I'll be the first person to admit he's crazy.
That's not why you're going to help me. You wanted the 100 dollars. And for which I want a receipt, by the way. Right, I asked around... a drug-addled transvestite who turned out to be completely useless and a closet DEA agent who was the exact opposite of useless in so many ways. Okay, Valentine, I ordered a bowl of soup. I don't want to hear how it was made.
No, none of them. They don't move, not even in their sleep. How's your leg? Are you using my vegetable cream? Yes, but it doesn't absorb well into my bones.
I forgot my homework... I forgot to give it to the teacher many years ago. And there's also a strange animal in the lake. That day, I don't know what happened. It swam around, free of gravity, very serene.
Otherwise he could get caught up in the deep currents. - It is possible. - Bring it closer to the surface. Yes, it could work. It has to hold on. It'll hold, but it'll use up its charge quickly, so when you're ready, turn on the switch and it'll activate the signal.
Want to hear more? It's been 15 years since I was touched by a man. Tell me, Shahrukh Khan, where and when do you want to meet? And then his pants opened to release his dragon. But as soon as his dragon came out, he shrank like a mouse.
I knew a lot of people who idolized the DeLorean, so to speak. The DeLorean fan base. And there were some guys in Los Angeles, Joe Walser and Terry Matalas in particular, who had their own DeLoreans that they turned into Back to the Future DeLoreans. I think Bob was rightly disappointed with the state the car was in, and said, "We've got to do something about this." The tour guy outside the studio, Fred Diedrich, called us into the studio and we took Terry's car and showed him how it could look.
-Lawrence, stop. -The ceiling is falling on me. Stop playing with the ceiling. -Why don't you fix it? -I hold it and it collapses.
"Struggling to see that it's not there. "Trapped in a refuge of misguided intentions. "Even so, I wouldn't invite interruptions from this boredom. "I enjoy the lament. "It creates the illusion that I'm doing something."
We're not entirely "sure" about that. May I? Maybe the rat was hungry? That wasn't a rat. It sat here, like this.
I'm 43. Many think it's a miracle. Many think it's a miracle. My pacemaker... runs on two batteries. Now it uses a chip. If it stops, I die on the spot.
You're white, asshole. This was just a joke, I was only joking! No, no! This week, Olivia's mailbox wasn't empty, as usual. This week, it contained one of those lovely notes that indicated she had a package at the hotel reception.
Come on, I want to win tonight. Yes, it's me. I have a problem that needs fixing. I found this rat in my kitchen. And it needs to be exterminated immediately.
Almost the entire station has been exposed to frost. I haven't seen anything on the monitors, no movement, nothing. And you turned on the power, the ventilation, everything, right? My first job out of school was writing code. This stuff, it's old, it runs in ASCII and base binary.
A man without the proper wisdom to grow. You can be useful. You've been useful. Real power, Dickie. Real power. He camouflages himself.
And it wouldn't be boring either. I don't think so either. But it's a bit heavy, right? -In physical weight. -When it fell on a friend's porch, he said it felt like a bomb going off.
- Shut up! Shut up! Are you going to cry? For them? They made their choice. And they knew their day was coming. And when it comes, do they regret it?
Send my friend Ajit Banerjee to me. Otherwise the police will never find out why the opium in Calcutta has disappeared. Tea? What do you know about the missing opium? It's being cooked into heroin.
I'm going to complain about you I'm going to put the ring on your finger What's the range of the remote control? I've installed the battery. So, until tomorrow, it will work at a distance of 50 to 60 feet.
What are you doing? I'm ringing the bell. - What's ringing? - Someone built this building, right? It didn't rise by itself.
The boss wanted to give me this car to get around. I can't accept it. Please take it. Mr. Pratz said that if I didn't take it, he'd fire me. Why didn't he bring it?
Well, you can come any time. Oh, thank you, thank you. We'll come. Take care of this old place. It needs a family.
The problem is that these kids are living a lie! You've gone too far... Santa Claus doesn't exist, you silly child. This is a disguise! But when they put on the disguise and impersonate Santa Claus, they take a solemn oath to represent certain values that he represents!
The right thing. It's inspiring. It can be intoxicating. That's why I love it. But you see the world as it is.
He wants to make his own album. He has a lot of money but no songs. I suggested that you two make a deal. And you'll both be happy. It will be your album.
Particularly on a Saturday night. The cops are too busy with everything else to care. They look like normal drinks deliveries for a nightclub, so nobody thinks about it. The safe is behind the paintwork in his office. Nobody knows it's there.
Father saved your life. No, it's okay. I heard that you arrested the guy who made the bomb and then let him go free. There was a reason for that. Sometimes we let a suspect go to see where he leads us.
We didn't know much, but we knew it was powerful shit. This will give us better results, okay? Cocaine takes over the pleasure centers of the brain. A rat chooses cocaine over food and water. It chooses cocaine over sleep, sex,... over life itself.
The princess belongs to the royal family. If the royal family is what separates us, then you'll have to include us in your family today. As you know, I don't know how to speak sweetly or tastefully, but I'm trying. Two days after Diwali, it's Bhaidooj (Brother's Day) and we're celebrating it this year! Sisters celebrate this festival but it's called Brother's Day and this brother really wants to be a part of your family!
But how? I have about 10,000 euros. I'm looking for a client who will help me escape... in exchange for that money. What if he takes the money and just disappears? Or what if he tells Manol?
But what they will never be, under any circumstances, is partners in a reconciliation plan with England. From my point of view, it's clear that we must act to prevent this... Should we? I'm sure you're not suggesting that we do anything. The only way to ensure that L'Urca's gold doesn't get here is to eliminate everyone who knows where it is and how it can be recovered.
My challenge would be to find peace, awaken my chi and make amends for my sins. Perhaps this Golden Nectar in the Wuyi Mountains can help me build a new future. God knows how much I need this. But no matter how much you want to leave the past behind, it always finds you in the end.
Innocence! She's alive! Well, Brother Kung, the winds of change are upon you now. Brother Thaddeus, if fate really is the great planner, then may it smile upon your journey.
Vartan Sofoyan. You know this man. I'm afraid I don't. Then why the lump in your throat? The hood, brother. He scared me.
Habibeh, have you seen my sapphire ring? The one with the little diamonds in the center of the stone? I'm afraid not, Khanoum. It was here. It didn't come off on its own.
Close your eyes. Leave it... no! Yes. - A mirror of water. - He needs some water.
The other agents are busy, so they send me. I go. I got more out of the contact in one night than he did for six months Because I knew what I was talking about. So I write the report. It gets circulated everywhere.
I wonder the same thing. Every time I think I'm free of this place... - This place is your home. - It's your home! - It's not mine.
- Two. One mechanical, the other digital. If we pass the encrypted code, I'll have to drill through 15 cm of reinforced steel to deactivate the system's drum. Job will discover the encrypted code. - It changes every 12 minutes.
She said she'd been out all night and when she returned home she'd been burgled. She said that the manuscript of a book had gone missing. Burn marks on both sides. It seems she died from a large electric shock. It probably caused instant cardiac arrest.
- No... Did you get to see him? No, Suzie wouldn't have let me. She kept it completely secret. So how do you know he really exists?
We need to talk about the manuscript. We need to talk about the manuscript. Now is not the time. Tonight isn't about money, it's about Suzie. But when he shows up, you'll be the one making decisions.
To be honest, Aunt Edda, I know you and Mom had problems. And I just thought we could... Dig them up and deal with them. Darling, maybe this isn't a good time. It's Christmas, what better time could there be? Christmas is a time for forgiveness, family, tradition. If you believe in it, if you let that spirit in, it will fill you.

Come on baby Let's watch a movie baby From 9 to 12 baby My heart beats out of rhythm Every time I look at you it screams hip-hip-hurrah
The hospital is closed, but the emergency room is operating normally. Everything is fine. Don't worry about it. The baby is fine. There's nothing wrong with him.
At lunchtime, you want to do something really tough? And that's... eight points of non-fatal damage. It exceeds your HP. Your cleric is unconscious. Bloody hell! And he's still breathing?
It was perfect. Saturday was the day of his piano lesson. Most of the offices were closed. There was very little action in the building. I couldn't leave any trace that the elevator had been tampered with, but I knew enough to make it appear broken.
We're in this situation together, Vincent, or we're not. I don't want to force you to do anything, and the last thing I want is to put you in danger again. But what choice do we have? Right, what about us? - And our future. Does it count?
In other words, once the house has claimed one victim, it's over. But you can stop it, stop it from moving on and making more victims. Find the dark heart of the house and destroy it. Where is this dark heart? What does it look like?
No. It's about moving much more. Did you hear that? He's getting angry. Hurry, we have to be faster than him!
Don't touch my feet! Thank you for keeping my honor, ma'am. You've put my mind at rest. Don't forget, my lord. This welcome stops at the threshold of the house, it doesn't extend to the heart.
What do you want me to do? Stay in bed and cry like a little girl? - We have to get you off this island. - I'm not leaving until I find the baby. He's still alive, Alan.
Give me the baby. No. - You won't do the same to him as you did to me. - No! If you follow us, I'll make sure he never cries again.
Don't tell Connie any of this. I won't. - But you mustn't forget either. - Why should I? This cat is from the DEA. Mark my words, he'll get justice.
The guy said 15 years, if treated well. Fifteen years...? From 2014. That's right. We'll be approaching 40 when he dies.
- Did you like it? - Very good! I like it. Mom, why is this train so slow? Because it's not the fastest.
Is that all you need? Just my wolf blood? That's all we need. It's not going to happen. If you don't give it willingly, it will have to be taken from you.
Essentia crescat. A skin cell, a strand of hair, that's all I need to grow a piece of Aleister. I'll never get used to that. What will this spell do? It will kill Aleister.
A premonition of something that will happen. The Ruin has begun. If we don't kill him by sunrise, all the witches will die. - What will this spell do? - It will kill Aleister.
Nothing was here at the time. Unfortunately, that's the best chronology we have. The plane... It looks like it never touched the ground. - Are you saying it didn't crash?
We shouldn't go there. So who is he? According to protocol, he should be ignored. I'm going to bed. He'll stop eventually.
That's good. That's good. - Have you seen my bear? - This isn't the time. He's gone.
Mr. Malcolm will be back tomorrow. And so will I. Do you believe that the past can come back? More than that. It never leaves us.
A kind of relic, in a long-forgotten box in the archives of the British Museum, and I can't imagine it's been seen in recent years. In the 11th century a Carthusian monk, known only as Brother Gregory, began to lose his mind. He claimed to be possessed by a demon, perhaps the father of them all, the fallen angel himself. In any case, this demon spoke to him in the Verbis Diablo. Brother Gregory wrote down what he said on what he had at hand.
* I hope the magic never dies How can I describe this feeling? * It's almost as if we can * Complete each other * But time can be sneaky * It can separate us little by little * Without us realizing it
$50 taels. Let's go! Let's go somewhere else. Name a price. I know how much it's worth.
Is this food? Here's the main course of our banquet. Raw brain of a baby monster king. - This dish brings long life and prevents them from growing old. It moves.
Obey me! You're in my house! What is it? I'm your father. You don't have to set a plate for him, that's not why he's coming.
Andrew has been obsessed with girls ever since Ali disappeared. If he really thinks she's here alone, there's no way he'll pass up the chance to catch her. What if I'm wrong? Dad, it was my idea. If we don't sting the bear, he'll stay in hibernation.
If you've been wasting money... Look here, in addition to the EMI (mortgage) on your house, every month you withdraw a large amount of money. What do you have to say about that? Oh yes! Your daughter has a heart condition. This money is for her treatment, it can't be controlled.
You know that Jenny and I have three jobs. Two months is too little. If you've been wasting money... My daughter has a kidney problem. This money is for her treatment, it can't be controlled.
Thank you. Daddy, that hurts. It's all right, darling, you're a brave girl. Look at that little bird. He's flying... flying.
Let's go. It's time to complete your education. I gave you a chance. The world is very cruel, Professor. He laughs at your pain.
You told him one of our secrets. Look, look. Everything's going to be fine, okay? We'll run the DNA test. It will show that he was the father,
He'll show that he was the father, and then, hopefully, the laptop will prove that he was on the roof of the sorority house. And if that doesn't happen? He will.
And then, hopefully, the laptop will prove that it was on the roof of the sorority house. And if that doesn't happen? He will. He will.
Um ... Here. Sam's ring. I took it off right before ... I thought you might want it.
He is being held hostage by ms. Parks. I have no idea what she's talking about, her honor. My husband's laptop is being held on police lockdown. It probably contains his cell phone coordinates,
And this represents the economy of profound and extreme unsustainability. For a scholar of these matters, it's mind-boggling and horrifying. What happened with clothing was fast fashion and then, gradually, the household consumer products sector. Almost everything in our home has become a fashion item, and this has been a dramatic change. If you think about the concept of fashion, it incorporates the idea that you can throw things away, not when they are no longer useful, but when they no longer have social value or are out of fashion.
Meditation is a technique for finding well-being in the present moment before anything happens. We can be happy and content simply by feeling our breath. We rarely devote ourselves completely to one thing. We interrupt ourselves or allow ourselves to be interrupted by this flow of data and what would, in another context, be considered a distraction, we now see as necessary parts of our bandwidth. If I leave my phone in my pocket in vibrate mode, I will unconsciously react when it vibrates.

Cleaning out the closet? No. Bern, yes. But no. He needed cleaning.
Let's go. - We only found alcohol? - Yes, we did. - It won't help. - He knows. - It'll only make things worse.
No, it's fine. I'm usually awake. I used to open a coffee shop every day for seven years. The brain gets attached to things it no longer needs. I also still like to carry my cell phone. One day it rings and I get scared.
They died. They all died because of me. They died. There was no guard at the gate. It was open.
It was open. I asked Gabriel to close it. Go! I didn't bring him here. He came in on his own.
That was my hair, Kev. How could you do that? How could he do that? V, it's just hair. It grows back.
Go back to the part where he's... You have to lose Matley. We're 40 seconds into a shitty interview. The graphics don't work. It shows where the new documents fail with the originals.
This was not used for personal memos. I'm saying these documents are forgeries... Copied using a 15-generation copier... To make them look older. Okay. Mary. What the hell is going on? Space isn't just similar, it's identical in every respect.
You have to present your case to the panel, darling. You have to fight. - Even if manipulated by the system? - The system is rigged. It's always been...
Would it be right to say... Were you looking for something negative about the president? I'd say to be precise we were looking for some information... from his time in the Guard that hadn't come to light. And that's what made it tasty? Not because it reflected badly on the president? It was tasty because he had the potential to be news.
- All right, we'll do it! That's it. Thirty-three seconds. Right, that'll be our baseline. I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but when a rat completes a maze, it gets food in return.
I've found the key! So it's the key to the door? Is that it? We spent 200 dollars on six minutes of fun? It's like when you bought the remote-controlled helicopter and it just... flew away.
Bernadette, strange things are happening around here. I think I suspected it was a bad movie when I looked in the script and saw the title... Serial Ape 2: Monkey Sees, Monkey Kills. Spoiler alert: after the monkey sees, he kills.
When we burned the doll, it was too late. They said you were going to die. Or worse. That the gray scales would grow little by little. That you would only live until you knew the world and then it would be taken away from you.
Or maybe not. Then we'll have to have this conversation again. And again and again. I'm tired of running away from my life. I want to eradicate it... so that he leaves me and never comes back.
Today's target was an eccentric multimillionaire. I had spent the last six years taking money from people. Banks, university scholarships, teachers' pension funds... If there was a penny to be taken, it was my job to do it. When the feeling of guilt grew, I buried it with my ambition. If I climbed high enough, maybe I could be faster than him.
Can we get out of Wonderland? Because we know there's money. I even remember well a duel over money, money that we discussed in detail. You gave me various excuses for having said money. - It exists.
- It's all right, Lydia. There are other ways to get to the details. This special equipment is designed for trepanning. The medical art of drilling inside a human skull. Let me show you how it works.
I mean, it's Daedalus! Fate? No. Impossible. But if the ring is in Troezen Forest, you must take me to it immediately.
"Today, I give myself to you and to this marriage. I will be faithful, true and loving without any brain activity that is associated with hesitation or doubt." "A true promise made in earnest literally puts the brain at ease. And if you could examine my anterior cingulate cortex now, Donnie, you'd see that it's never been more relaxed."
If you have evidence, arrest me. But if not... Nobody said anything about arresting you. The State Department will expel him. I'm sure the Bangladeshi government will be very happy to have you back when they learn of your plan and the lives it has cost.
That's enough. I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't get my patient away from this stressful environment. Mr. and Mrs. Tyler, you should know that while we were looking for your daughter, we found the vehicle that killed Jessica. Where was it? Where was it?
That's enough. Then I accept. Your Majesty has shown great wisdom and discretion. Do this... and you will never see the code again. If it even exists.
It's very strange and no one is investigating further. I'm guessing you haven't spoken to Phillip about it. No. I know I shouldn't get involved. I could probably create a test, but we'd have to get to his body before he decomposes, which will happen much faster than usual, since he was found in the water.
- And our patient? Stable pulse. This is the key to separation. We enter here at the bottom where they are connected, gain access to the ligament and place staples. The delicate work will be to divide the liver in half, giving equal amounts to each girl, so that it can regenerate equally in both.
- I don't have a phone. - Take it anyway. - Can we look in the container? - No. He's mine.
- Look over there, guys. - Oh, my God! - Tell me what I can do to help you. - Can you take down the video? - Well, it's already been posted.
What do I know? Whether you're the cat or the mouse. Remember that viral video where the lynx grabs and drags the shark out of the sea? It's sick. And up until that moment, I bet you the shark thought it was the predator.
We're here to see... Please empty your pockets into the tray. Please remove your belt and put it on the tray. I kind of need this belt. It's crucial for this outfit.
But it's worth something to you, so you won't get it for free. What does the book do? - Tell us about it. - I've already told you. - It opens your eyes.
- Tell us about it. - I told you. - It opens your eyes. - How? It triggers the memory centers of the brain, clearing the fog and bringing the images of the Dread Doctors into focus.
You're here to help them. For millennia, they have gathered vast resources that can help you in your hunt. A legend has been passed down through the centuries. It speaks of a book, an ancient volume of uncertain provenance and some divine inspiration, the "Occido Lumen". And... what do you know about this book? Now I have proof that it exists.
Now this is the Peggy Carter I need. - What do I need her for? - To clear my name. You can't be serious. I try not to be, but sometimes it just slips out anyway.
- When I die... my spirit will find the next commander. Reincarnation. That's how you became commander. How do you choose your leaders? He found us.
I'm already working on it. Another organized crime thing? All about Hell's Kitchen. There's a new player on the scene. Nobody knows who he is or what he wants.
In every moment, there is a choice. We can cling to the past, or embrace the inevitability of change and allow a better future to unfold for us. An uncertain future can call for even more uncertain allies. Either way, a new day is coming, whether we like it or not. The question is, will you control it, or let it control you.
We all live with a demon inside us. You can't hide from me forever! Sometimes we control the demon. This is my house. Are you okay? Other times, it controls you.
Come on, let's get you into your real body. Although I'll probably have to torture Freya and Esther to do it... which might be fun. No, Nik, I'm sticking with it. Eva's gone, but her body, this body, is still connected to Davina and the kids. If I leave it, it dies, and Davina and the kids die with it. So? I like Davina.
He should fear us. So let's stay. The helicopter is back on the roof. I didn't knock. Actually, he has keys.
The breakage indicates that the door somehow had zero viscoelasticity when it fell to the ground. What does that mean for normal people? Something went wrong. The steel shattered like glass. He's been frozen, Joe. - Snart.
The first thing I remember is the pain. I had just woken up... somewhere in the desert. I had this huge piece of rock lodged in my back. I didn't know how long it had been there, nor did I know how long I had been there, but I knew...
I've always been concerned about the path you've taken... trying to make sense of it all. Well, it is... similar in a way to the path you've chosen. I care about you. I knew your heart when you were little, Samson. He was perhaps quite brave, quite... kind.
But curfew is at nine. Well then, Miss Pair of Shoes. Looks like you've got a problem. That's right. We can't find him, because he's not here.
Clear your mind. - What are you doing? - Contact with the poltergeist. - Why are you doing this? - To find out what it wants.
- You can join in if you like. - I have homework. So relax, Janet. Just... let the thoughts leave your mind. Like... water going down a drain. If a new thought pops up, it's just passing through and everything... goes down the drain.
It's happened! A friend of mine is a genius at creating sensors... I imagined the canary and the rest? No! I know what he wants. He wants to hurt me.
Our son, Richard, told us that she was in a coma. We had to hurry. And my sister, Miriam, had a watch that hadn't worked for years. God knows why she kept it. Anyway, it started working soon after Janet's accident and it worked until... 04.20.
- Did he hang himself? - It was the poltergeist. Tell him about it. - Did he leave a note? Yes. It said: "I can't take it anymore.
Creepy Uncle Danny. Yes. Danny, don't do that! Thanks for the cigarette. Look who it is.
The accident didn't just screw up the engine, it screwed up the whole system. It's in a cycle. Torture, heal, torture, heal. I don't think he knows how to stop it. So if we don't destroy the program, the only way out is to die faster than he can fix us.
Yes, there were a lot of numbers. They're GPS coordinates. It's probably where the laptop was used. It looks like a warehouse off the road. It's still there.
Clear your mind. - What are you doing? - Contact with the poltergeist. - Why are you doing this? - To find out what it wants.
- I have homework. So relax, Janet. Just... let the thoughts leave your mind. Like... water going down a drain. If a new thought pops up, it's just passing through and everything... goes down the drain.
- I was awake! It happened! A friend of mine is a genius at creating sensors... I imagined the canary and the rest? No! I know what he wants.

- It was the poltergeist. Tell him about it. - Did it leave a note? Yes. It said:
- Go on! - I hate Maureen who's a bitch! And I hate the poltergeist for smashing my head and burning me! I hate it more than anything and everyone! I just want it to go away.
We're not honoring his memory, we're living in the past. What else are we supposed to do? Teri, the world didn't end when she died. Ours did. No, it didn't end.
You're no match for her with a sword! I've already hurt her once. If I'd known who you were then, I'd never have left you alive. Where's the Magi Ring? I'll take you to it if you spare our lives.
I know it's scary, but it's a risk we have to take. It's the only way we can be together. Sebastien... I hope that's not true, because your plan is awful. I'm not going through with it.
Is that why you won't call me back? - No, I lost my cell phone. - I thought you were angry with me. - When was the last time you saw him? - If I knew, he wouldn't be lost.
We traveled far to the land of Moab. DEAD SEA JERUSALEM We stayed in the village of Sa'adallos. Eleazar and I never lost touch. With our doves, we sent messages of our love. And it lasted.
Isn't it great that I can finally - see the apartment. - It's so exciting. There's not much to see. In fact, it's quite small.
He may have hidden it, but Mrs. D was alive. What prevented her from telling anyone else? Why do you think she didn't? Wilden couldn't be trusted. He told someone about the deposition, someone who wanted him to disappear, and paid him to keep Mrs. DiLaurentis quiet.
I'll be awake for three days when the hurricane hits. I have to get as much sleep as I can. That's a good idea. I won't bother you anymore. Have one of the maids wake me up when it hits the coast.
He can't even look us in the eye. And you had to tell him that? We want my brother exonerated, we want him released immediately. You understand that there will be civil action against this office. If a mistake has been made, it will be corrected.
No. Nemesis? No. You refuted my entire book. It didn't stand up to scrutiny.
- Everyone's looking! We were finally gaining strength! How do we get back to the war if there's no way? Well, nobody wants to go back as much as I do. But my job is to make sure there are soldiers to march on that path when it appears, and it will.
Five of my brothers are dead. And you're alone, bitch. You don't want to do this. I'm hosting a monster who doesn't take threats well. And if you piss him off, he'll kill them... the same way he killed your brothers.
Santa Muerte was dead. You really do have a demon in there. I'm just trying to keep it locked up. As long as I'm here, I can't drive it out. All he has to do is watch the clock tick.
You're our only hope, at least try. Fucking John Constantine. You're the center of attention again. This demon will try to use our weaknesses against us. If he emerges, don't listen to him... it won't be John.
Well, that's not the impression you gave. The impression you gave is that he wants you to go back on your statement, to perjure yourself, and say that it was you all along. No! I was speaking hypothetically. If I took the rap, it would have just been a juvenile sentence, which doesn't count, technically speaking.
20 years in the blink of an eye. Ohh. It's really something, isn't it? Oh. Where is he?
¶ I could compromise my pace ¶ ¶ So, we both take it slow ¶ ¶ Take me to your growing treetops ¶ ¶ In your dry-out cities ¶ ¶ If you take my heart, it'll never stop ¶
- No. - Well... There was that time with the smoke bomb... Smoke bomb? A week or so ago, some kind of beacon was set off near the mortgage sector. It set off the alarm.
I'm sorry if I crossed the line, I was just... It's obvious how much you help him... No, he helped me. I'm a better person for knowing you, Reg. Let's leave the past where it belongs.
The lord of bullshit? Landman Zack says he's on vacation on a very unpronounceable island where they use coconuts as telephones. Another connection to the air. Westmeyer-Holt with the Fisk Confed. If we pull on that thread, we'll see what it reveals.
Silver Brent sells and buys new properties all the time. One of them must have been sold that day. That's what I thought, but... look. Look at the balance sheet after the property disappeared from the list. It hasn't changed.
Yes, but ... Oracle ... can I kiss you? No. No? If the kiss doesn't mean what it should, then it won't work.
And you can't attribute more value to some, to the detriment of others. Not for me. Not for anyone else. People are not something you can sacrifice. The lesson here is that anyone who looks at the world as if it were a chessboard deserves to lose.
Let her show you. What the hell is this? This is our salvation. The virus isn't finished with us yet, Mr. Cole. It will mutate again and again until there is no immune left standing.
Barry's marrying Iris, not you. We have to give this ring back to Grandma Agnes. You, Eddie, won't need it. An anti-telepathy bandage. He uses magnetic resonance to neutralize any external neurological stimuli.
And that's why he's faster than you. The accelerator has been reactivated. - It can't be. - How is that possible? It exploded.
It tracks the vibrations of all the different objects in a space by the minute, and analyzes the sounds they create. Okay, I understand that the sound of a voice can make leaves vibrate, but if you can't even see it, then how do you measure it? Well, this is where the impossible becomes possible. This software is able to detect movements smaller than a hundredth of a pixel. By combining and filtering out all the tiny movements in the image, it can actually recover the sound of the voices in them.
God, I'll never eat bacon again. The heart is gone. Just like the head. My mother received a heart in a box. - This is where it came from.
This is Riley's place. Forever. Emma, again... I'm exponentially sorry about that video. I had no idea that it would just mutate and spread like some crazy zombie or sex virus.
Why is your DNA inside the mask? If you believe in your heart that Audrey didn't do this, just listen. I'm ready to talk. Nina and I made this video. The night it went viral, I went to Audrey to confess.
That's all. Thank you, sir. Well done. Sheriff! I know this dance will be irresistible to the killer if he's not Seth Branson.
Noah? I've almost isolated the signal. And I found out why we couldn't reach the staff. The malware doesn't just access webcams. It turns off ringtones and notifications.
We have to be quick. Did your inner voice finally say something about Sameen? No, but Ms. Thompson will. At least she should know what our rival does at the factory and how he manipulates the people of Maple. If he recreates this in other towns, countless people will suffer.
I'll book our flights. Are you wearing the blue outfit I like? Do you like how it looks on me? TWO YEARS AGO No, Renee. I like the way it falls to the floor.
Maybe we'll get something from the atmosphere. "Blessed are the peacemakers", General. Let's take it easy for now. You've all had contact with this avatar. He defines himself as the Overseer of Earth.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Still no ID on the victim? Garcia's running her markers through VICAP. This unsub went to a lot of trouble wrapping and sinking the body. Normally it's the production of gas after death that brings a body to the surface, but if you freeze it, it'll rise to the top, like ice cubes in a drink.
I assumed that "The Empress" had sunk off the Caicos Islands, but Rick found the ship here, 1600 km north of where it was supposed to be. But wait. Wait a minute. How did he get there?
They were the newcomers. He didn't trust them. Davey, you're a diver. What state was the wreck in? Could you tell us why it sank?
Do you know what happened to them? The story is a bit vague, but one of the crew members was shot by the captain on the ship. Get him out of here! The key fell off the dead man. Soon after, they revolted, broke free and took control of the ship. But it was too badly damaged.
With so many discreet men in this world. Abigail, who did this to you? Should we really know everything about each other? Isn't it possible to just... leave our past behind? Not if it keeps haunting you.
When you think back on all the decisions you've made in your life, the one thing you don't want to feel... is regret. Is regret. Am I right? That's why this car makes so much sense. Economical, stylish, safe... It has it all.
For a life more exciting than mine. You wouldn't like it. There are several people looking for me. The money in his room was all I had. And I had to make it disappear.
They found you. What happened? To free the Master of Time and Space, I have to overcome one final obstacle. Which one? What is it?
I'm a bit disoriented. This is it. Stay there. Jesus. There he is.
Is all this true? You're going to allow this E.N.E.H to happen, and the only thing you'll be creating is the extinction of man. No. I have a plan. And it's sad to tell you this, but it doesn't include you.
I need to see her. We're still working on it... I'm afraid that's not protocol. Please, please, there's a place right behind her head, here. If it's blocked, it interrupts his power.
Ladies and gentlemen. We don't serve lungs because they are difficult to digest due to their compact structure. The heart is nutritious and fat-free, as is the liver, but one of the two guests was unfortunately an alcoholic and his liver was hard and inedible. The brain, however, is rich in cholesterol and I don't recommend it if any of you suffer from arteriosclerosis. This is the spleen, and it's especially good.
Zoey is missing. She could be suicidal, or she could be homicidal. Tell me where you got this video. He filmed it when his family went hunting with Zoey and her father last year. People are scared, Dad.
Like a criminal who puts on his gloves and scrapes the serial number off a gun, you took every cyber precaution to hide yourself, but like most criminals, you made a mistake by using a disposable cell phone to send a message to Zoey's father. We traced the serial number of that phone back to you. You can't prove anything you're saying. Even I know that disposable cell phones are untraceable. But what you don't know is that the first time you connect a cell phone to a computer, it records that activity.
Now Ross P. is in jail and Frank Broussard has disappeared off the map. And my guess is that if Dante was thinking of showing up the buyer, now he's scared. Okay, put out an APB on Frank, and see if anyone can make up for the DEA ruining your party. Should I ask? If you wave to him, he'll wave to you.
- Zo! Oh, shit! Say goodbye to your Prince, Da Vinci. The sign... Where is it?
That's certainly what I saw. The specifications were clear. It was a series of pulleys and gears... Yes. United by a metal-permeated cable to your headless bird. I thought the wind would activate it. The crystal mechanism, does it turn?
Are you all right? - What happened? - It was a stray dog. I think he was more afraid of me than I was of him.
Yes. - What happened? - It was a stray dog. I think he was more afraid of me than I was of him. I tried to take him in, but he had other plans.
- A tumor? - Benign. But it secretes insulin, which causes huge fluctuations in glucose levels. - And that was... - Exhaustion, confusion, forgetfulness. The accident was the tumor's fault. And now it's gone.
Did I mention it's a boy? We're having a boy. When the shock wears off... When the body accepts that a trauma has happened... When it can let its guard down...
You haven't even had a chance to open it. Yes. I bought it for you to put on your dashboard. Why a shark dancing the hula? Because I thought it would make you smile.
You said that at first you thought it was because of the disease. What made you change your mind? Well, I hadn't finished the exam when I explained all this to the other... what's his name? Gideon. Yes, him. Now that I've had time to fully examine the body, it tells a different story.
- And when she doesn't come, who do you think is responsible? I don't care about the President. He's not the problem. It's the system. It's rigged against us.
No, I don't think so. That's why I took the risk. All right, then. And what did you find out? I have a plan. And it involves Chopper.
So you'll keep quiet? If it involves enough beer. John, I feel... wet. We're filling your hypothalamus with hydrogel; it mimics cerebrospinal fluid almost perfectly.
And one thing I know about classic cars is that they don't use hemp in the carpets or seat coverings. Not in 1976, anyway. By the way, check out the chrome result. It's not chromium potassium sulphate. - It didn't come off the girl.
The cell phones were thrown. Yes, but I don't see any bodies. That means the girls could still be alive. A video has been opened. It looks like it was recorded inside a vehicle.
None of them, however, are alive to tell us what it was like. There are strange stories of the book appearing in India and Burmei, always? presaging massacres, calamities. If we find him, we could do ourselves harm. You're not wrong, Dr. Martinez. In 1856, it was part of an auction in Marseille.
My life didn't include her for some reason. I had other things, power, respect from other men. Just listen to me, the philosopher. It's funny to have desire when it has never brought me any happiness.
What's this? This... This is the Silver Angel. Nice to meet you. Do you want to talk or drive? I don't feel like I'm playing the violin as much as it's playing me.
Nice to meet you. Do you want to talk or drive? I don't feel like I'm playing the violin as much as it's playing me. What do you mean? He's had so many owners before me, each with their own way of playing.
I'm with you. It's all right. There's a remote control detonator. Trigger contact. If I pull it, it'll go off.
But it's the toughest fights, the ones that take place outside the ring, that really mean something. Everything else is a waste of time. I don't want to waste any more time, I want to take this fight to those behind me. John, I've just looked at the new BAV algorithm. It turns out that Zimmerman was just one of hundreds of users it was designed to target. People whose search history indicated depression, for example, BAV sent results that probably made their depression worse.
I'm confused. Noah is using his room as an office until the baby is born. - Until the baby is born. - Yes, exactly. You know that it's customary to prepare a space for the baby before it's born, right?
I got up and left the house and walked across the ice of the lake. I was terrified. He told me he'd kill me if I wanted to leave him. The only good thing I got from Ron was my baby. We moved to Elizabeth, New Jersey, and he started writing Dianetics. The book was planned and he started work in 1950.
Mom, when you find it, how exactly do you intend to use it? You said it's dangerous. I was curious to know if it's dangerous for everyone. I need to train him, teach him control, which is much more difficult without the book. Does he have the answers?
That place is an illusion. You don't know that. See that building? It was once the seat of power for the whole world. It stood tall in a shining city on a hill, where so-called enlightened men promised their citizens a bright future.
One of my bites, I think it's infected and it hurts. Look, since we got back from that trip I... Tell me about it. Look, I'm covered. But I went to the dermatologist yesterday and he gave me this cream. You have to use it, it will help.
You know that thing you picked up from Kellogg's soldiers? It's off the magnetic scale and I think I've figured out how to turn it on. What makes you say that? You need to see it to understand, but it lines up with a certain magnetic field. I made a map from the police station and it takes us to the empty factory near where the van was last seen.
The MES is perplexed. The Security Cam hasn't got a clear picture of the killer. Was this book stolen? Yes. It belonged to John Dee, an Elizabethan-era academic ...
Yes, well, I'm hoping that we can count on this talent to help us now. The great grimoire? This is a book of powerful and dangerous magic. It was stolen from a local auction house last night.
This is a book of powerful and dangerous magic. It was stolen from a local auction house last night. Here? After all this time? Someone must have taken it from here,
Rumor has it that there are eight of them circulating around. Any idea who has them? No, but there is one user who is trying to find them. He goes by the name "DesertSky60", and has spent the last month asking about these knives. I searched for the username using a search engine, to see if it would appear on any other sites, and found this profile.
I don't think we've shared yet, have we? Scott has a question for you. If we had the original genome, we could solve everything. Has it really been destroyed or is it just another classified secret? Believe me, I want the source material as much as you do, but thanks to the Duncans, it's lost.
So, explain our success, can you? As you know, this requires qualities that you have... Patience, concentration, sacrifice. You conceived this book, Virginia. You helped bring it into the world, after the longest labor in history, 10 years. And now here it is.
Since it has become public knowledge that they were treated by us, I can say that they were our patients, but I can't reveal any details. Very well, then. In general terms, what was so important about this case? Well... let's use as an example, a real monkey taken from its natural environment, as a way of understanding what happened to the Neely... Because if you take that monkey and hurt it in ways that only humans can, and it becomes something it's not.
Everything will be in the open. All right, then. You need to modernize your closet. I'm talking about Virginia, Betty... with the time she spends with Dan Logan. He's blinding her, you know, distracting her from the work we should be focusing on.
What a wonderful invention. That undead robot understands how our powers work better than we do. He's really, really smart. But imperfect. He fails sometimes, and when he does... I feel my power.
I hope so. I'm going to help Mrs. Vanderwaal with the tea. Okay, I'll be right behind you. The stopwatch. Every time it stops, you'll get older, but no one else will.
Again, please. And one more time. Was the last pass painful because of that burn on your arm? No, ma'am. My elbow, this part of my arm, I've already broken it, and it never healed completely.
For the tumor, we are murderous, soulless monsters. Why am I doing this? Why am I calling it a baby and talking about killing it? Because this kind of tumor deserves respect. It deserves a little humanity.
And all of them in themselves. Technically it's called a fornix. But I call it the "dream box". The question is: what happens when that box is invaded? When a tumor is so big and brutal that it's drying up the dream box? It's taking over. Stealing dreams and hopes.
Look at my hands. Can you hear me? Tell me... What does it mean... the message in that sign? What is it trying to tell us?
There is another world. I've seen it... In the magic mirror. A world the opposite of ours... A dark place... where greed and corruption reign... It has to be kept hidden...
It's probably best to destroy the fragment. - Are you kidding me? - It's the only way to protect him. If he wants it so badly, why not use it to lure him out and then kill him? See? Even she doesn't want to break it. We can't risk him falling into her hands.
If he wants it so badly, why don't they use it to lure him in and then kill him? See? Even she doesn't want him to leave. We can't risk him falling into her hands. We have to keep him away at all costs. Once he's dead, we'll see if he can take us back.
Oh, I know... you have a cat or a dog. No, I don't. I have a canary. A canary? How does it sing?
My friend... Try to be patient. Let's make sure Anton comes home again. - Have you got rid of the teddy bear? - No. Make sure it disappears.
They just took it from us. How the hell did that happen? He was sitting and talking to me an hour ago. Well, we knew about the spleen. It made his stomach muscles bleed, but Pierce will cut them and gray ...
Meet the Asian girl ready for any practice. The clown who will make anyone forget their fatigue. The dynamic duo of Fizbo and... Lezbo! - Didn't you hear that? - We still have to work on the name. Oh, no, Fizbo's dropped his hat, where's he gone, Lezbo?
- Didn't you hear that? - We still have to work on the name. Oh, no, Fizbo dropped his hat, where did he go, Lezbo? He's right there. There he is!
And her mother. But it happened to you and you're alive. Yes, but my baby was extracted from me before it developed. "Extracted"? Did he survive?
Whether it was because of the radiation, I don't know. But your behavior was unstable, you can't deny that. If you keep lying, I'll show you what instability is. We had the boy's body in the morgue. He was in a kind of stasis.
I'm pregnant, Dad. Now just turn it on. Did you get that dress from my closet? No, I printed it. I told you it was inappropriate.
Second quote. "Newspaper strips", so what? They call that a trail. Wait, yes, I think I learned about that at the Academy. It's a way of spreading the fire from where it starts to other flammable materials that already exist, right?
Help me! There's a demon. There's a demon here! You can't see him! He's blinded you!
I'm sorry, sir, but... That's the worst Starscream imitation I've ever seen. Starscream? I've picked up a Decepticon signal. It seems to be coming from...
That's new. Jo made me a new ring. Do you like it? That depends. Does it work?
They were negative, against everything, a radical, extremist group. I got fed up. Kyle and I started arguing a lot. I left him. Do you have a dog? No. I had a cat, but he ran away.
Thank God they're alike. Don't you drink milk? A tiger doesn't drink milk. Donkey, a tiger doesn't eat grass. He drinks milk and is strong because of it.
What happened? He was here. I wonder what he wanted to show. Do you think it was the man in the van? Who but him?
This toy will beep whenever it's near the polonium. Take a look. How long is it detectable? Well, polonium isn't the kind of thing you just wash off with detergent and bleach. - It stays.
- Those responsible are dead. - Those responsible are dead? That doesn't make me feel any better, because it doesn't solve the problem. It doesn't bring the money back. There is someone who knows where it is.
We won't have enough time to get there and place the explosive charges. Maybe we don't need the explosive charges. Listen... the train is an explosive in itself. - T3 torpedoes and cannonballs. - All right, here's what we do. We'll board the train when it stops for maintenance. We'll remove the guards, rig them with fuses.
Guess what? I've updated your outfit. It's just like the one in the future newspaper that Gideon showed us. I was thinking, you know, you don't have to be afraid of the future anymore. No. It's going to come faster than we think.
Mainly because they stay in the water. And I don't like water. We need 3 minutes to get the board up, 5 to get to the engine room and approximately another 5 to locate the weapons and 14 minutes and 32 seconds to disarm and reprogram them. A total of 27 minutes and 32 seconds. We leave the boat at the time it leaves.
- How are we going to deal with him? We're going to provoke it. We're going to make him feel us everywhere he looks. To prove the fire we have to catch him in the act, and that's what we're going to do. Put pressure on the volcano and wait for it to erupt.
Well, I'd like to see the body. So where's the simulation? A few floors below us, which is easier said than done. In order to simulate the conditions on Mars, as well as avoid any mistakes, the simulation is filled with noxious gas. Okay, it won't kill you, but it will induce nausea and a rash.
In fact, it's best to look within a radius of 1.6 km. Some of the best snipers have that range. He was Special Forces. The problem is locating the bullet's path. It doesn't line up directly with any of those buildings.
28 men and 3 women. That's how many deaths this war has caused us. My thoughts are with them. The 31 soldiers who have lost their lives in this unnecessary war. Does your report mention their names? Does it reveal why they were sent to war?
No big deal. Outside of work it's easier to stop drinking. It's work, Jim. You get angry. Insensitive. Yes, he does that.
I don't like those odds. Of course, if you really believe that this was sabotage, the most likely thing is that the diagnostic program has been tampered with. And in that case, there's nothing really wrong with the joint. Would anyone like to take a chance? You said there was a second option. The computer has identified what it believes to be the faulty part.
Ventilating the camera. You should know that I used my neural link to upload a replacement program. It can be accessed via the panel on the control bridge. That won't be necessary. Just start the program and then, after a few minutes, when complete, it will automatically execute the entry into hyperspace.
The color will have to be customized because they no longer make "raspberry ice cream". They're all so beautiful. And they're all to be tested. Jumper style. I love this mattress. And he loves having you on it.
- Not yet. You've done something new to your hair. It was Wendy. Do you like it? I don't think there was anything wrong with the way it was before.
Because that would be crazy. It's crazy and no one would see that movie. Do you know why no one would see that movie? I... Because it was never made.
As I said, she was very stingy with the details. By the way, the baby... was a girl. No... That's not possible. He was a boy.
We always bring our lunch. Thank you for sharing your lunch with me, but... but no, like, do we die if we eat cotton balls? Only if they cause an obstruction in your intestinal tract, but that's what the sauce is for. Lubrication. And it gives you full satisfaction but without all the calories.
Hold on! That's it! "Find my device" is an app. Every smartphone has a GPS on it. Even without a battery, it can tell us where it is.
I'm so proud of you! I mean, this is so exciting, Kappa is really going to change and it all starts with you. The biggest change I'd like to implement would be to stop these serial killer killings. That's what we need to talk about. I know we don't know who the killer is, but we know he goes back to this house.
And do yourself a favor, have a small slice of that soft, unpasturized cheese. It makes any sushi so much more delicious. You're right. And, Hester, you have to try this champagne. It's a special champagne with triple the alcohol and a... nicotine sensation, because it's infused with tobacco.
That's true. Let me help put this on your lap. What are you doing here? How are you alive? It's a good thing I was wearing the neck brace when you pushed me down the stairs, because it saved my life.
Come on, boy, you've got a letter to open. Whatever it says, I expect you to stay here until your work is done. - THE CONDOR... - It's the future, the tip of the spear, the edge of the knife, the cat's pajamas, whatever. It's the cat's ass, wise guy. Let me know which side he falls on.
- What's your name, babe? - What's your name? Jesus, what a fucking waste this crazy woman is. What's your name? Whatever you want it to be, darling.
Well, I'm going to Chinatown so someone can stick needles in me. Oh, my God! I love your coat. You look beautiful. I mean, the way it flows.
Maybe you too. The list of people is a social network from hell. Villains, despots, terrorists, rebels, enemies of the state. If you're not here, you're not bad enough. You're nowhere to be found. I can't find the auction website because it doesn't exist.
Yellow tweed tuxedo jacket for a fucking boy? I mean, what is that? Do you see what's on the mannequin? ~ It's a bit like that. ~ Yeah. ~ It doesn't match that tie thing.
~ Just no? ~ Just no. What else? Well, we could watch this Sandler Adam movie. It starts at 8. 10.
Like a fire sprite or a basilisk, something to... A basilisk is a reptilian monster that petrifies you with a single look. - A look like that? - Yes, you got the point. Anyway, what's important is not the lighthouse itself, but what it had.
Christopher? Good Lord. Christopher. So the prospector tries to escape into the lake, but the bear was faster? It grabs his feet in the water and starts tearing him to pieces.
Follow me. - Are they looking for the bear? - No. Who told you that? Patrick. He said it was 22 feet tall.
- Are they looking for the bear? - No. Who told you that? Patrick. He said it was 22 feet tall. Well, he's not.
They've been seen in Lake Michigan and there are plenty of them swimming happily in Lake Nicaragua. Well, how long does it take before they run out of that osmor... what you said, to kill them. Bull sharks don't die from lack of salinity. - In English. - It will live and thrive.
- I need that restraining order today. - Not now, Hernandez. I don't think the shark will respond to a restraining order either. But don't worry, honey. He'll answer to me.
Goodbye, Peter. Mom. Are you all right? I have to take the shark to the morgue, open it up and see what's inside. - It almost got my mother.
Cause of death? He probably blew out his lungs. Common in an improvised bomb attack. Yeah, the vehicle those poor guys were in basically ended up on top of one. I'll get Sebastian to analyze the clothes. If there's any residue, maybe he can tell what explosives were used.
For old times' sake, my dear For old times' sake Happy New Year. For the good old days. Make me smile, as we celebrate the future every year, whatever it brings.
Sick. In fact, I was poisoned. By the family Bible, the one your father used to read for comfort, like me, after he died. The poison had affected our personalities. It also altered my taste buds. I crave sweets.
- They change us. - That's right. Without death, there would be little progress. I believe that life began without death in the beginning until it was discovered that life didn't work well without death. Because it didn't give space to young people who didn't know what the world was like 50 years ago, but saw it as it is today without preconceived notions and imagined what it could be like based on that.
While enjoying a few pints of Pilsner, Apple's Gray Powell was testing a new iPhone prototype. But as he tumbled out of the bar, Powell forgot something. His iPhone. It was found on a bench by a student called Brian Hogan.
That's how people talk when they're looking for something more. Maybe because I'm a woman, I hear it differently. Arkady Ivanovich, give it some more time. It's in everyone's interest. Come in. * the warmth of your hand and a cold, gray sky * * he fades into the distance *
No, I don't mean to quote the fairy godmother, but "today" ends at midnight, so... Just... Call if you need to talk. What's wrong? Your smile is so perfect. And there it is.
Let's do it. Three, two, one! He's full of stars. Oh my God! He's just eaten Bill Glates!
I want confirmation that that fish is dead. -Understood? -Yes, sir. What is it? Admiral, it's alive.
I read that woman's lips. I'll do it. She asked where the Japanese art salon was. He sent her to the east wing. But he was moved to the west wing just after the pyramids exhibition ended 10 years ago, implying, of course, that he knew the museum when he worked on the exhibition, but didn't come back after it ended.
He seems well informed. Professor Worth, this is a bottle of rum. - Yes, it is. - English rum. The Isola Perduta didn't just sail the Mediterranean, it was in England, as I suspected.
Can't we get it away, like off the island? Thor's hammer, in theory. No. That would sink half of New York into the sea. If it breathes, can't we kill it?
You and Ezekiel take the antiques. - I thought you and I... right. The spirit found the final passage into the heart of the Library. They've reached the elevator. It will take them to the heart of the Library.
Almost 100 rooms to search. Normally I'd hack the security system, look for clues, but we have magic. Munchausen's top. Keating family, secret treasure and contract. Not exactly, but he gives us the building.
The new material allows computers to work tens of thousands of times faster than they do now. So are we talking about artificial intelligence? No. This is a software problem. This is pure computing power. Best suited to battle analysis, it runs millions of scenario simulations, predicts the future with 99% accuracy in a second, or, in this test, maps a 3-D space and uses it for a quantum teleportation model.
Okay, let's stay calm. Let's assume it's a time loop. - We start here again... - Every time. Where does it end?
Yousaf, I've been doing this for a long time. It doesn't get any easier as a result. You make a lot of mistakes. And they weigh on you. But you look around and see that the world is hell for most people most of the time, and you think about what it could be and what you can do about it.
Listen, I've already told the detective all this. Why are you putting me through this again? Lilly found money in the hotel room, money you were hiding from her. It was for a present for her... a necklace. I told the detective it was stolen.
Lilly found money in the hotel room, money she was hiding from her. It was for a present for her... a necklace. I told the detective it was stolen. Diamond and sapphire. Lilly was wearing it when she was attacked, and she bought it with that envelope of money, so now it's hard to prove that it even existed.
This is the pier. I'm moving the map back to Saturday between 12:15 and 12:30. When Scott said the car dropped them off. - And that's the Ross car? - Yes. And here he is in the bar.
Strange. The deer is injured. I was there. No need to rub salt in the wound. He's been shot. From a gun.
You won't stop living until I say so. - Michael. - Who's this? - My lawyer. - I've come to notify you. In this county, a shot deer is the property of the hunter no matter how far he runs or if anyone interferes.
But do it because you really believe you're not the right person, not because you're afraid of failing. - Who... - It's okay to be afraid. Sometimes fear keeps you safe. Sometimes it gets in your way.
Sit down. He's broken the contract. I want the kid out of my house. The contract says I can leave if I'm discreet. Yes, it does.
It's fun and you're happy for a while, until it's over. Things always get weird and confusing. Then I exaggerate, or he misinterprets. Then we're no longer in the same relationship, because we never were. We've always been distant with this hole between us, pretending it didn't exist.
I was joking. Have a seat. It's been so long. And his smile. I've forgotten what he looks like.
I can live in your footsteps I can live with your love If you can't be mine I'll live in your heartbeats Why is your heart looking for me? How he conquered both worlds
I know who they're from. Do you feel like sharing? Not really. As long as you're happy with it. The heart wants what it wants, doesn't it?
Congratulations. Let's run this one for the crime lab. Packaging, everything. Let's run this blood, too. And see if it matches any of our victims.
Bad blood is like a ... a bad cold or worse. Coffins? I prefer blackout curtains and a Duxian bed. The sun won't kill you, but it should be avoided. It will sap your vitality.
People do enough damage without the help of the afterlife. Put it in your guide. That was your office. The room you're staying in, 64. If this building has a heart, it's black as the ace of spades, and you're sleeping in it.
Kanima. You're not dreaming, Tracy. Are you going to do a magic trick? No, but you are. I only know one trick and it's with a playing card.
In a dream. What dream? I've been having them here and there for about six months. I'm walking in the woods, carrying a body. But it's totally burnt.
They were scientists and healers thousands of years ago. I've never seen that place. But that's why you're here. He lured you here. That's what he does.
What's that? Nothing. That's it. That's the end of the dream. I only know one trick. And it's with a playing card.
It's like the other ghosts with those strange black eyes and... No. No, wait. Your coat. It's torn.
What's the problem? Because everything else is going well... The phone signal doesn't reach there. What do you have to do... Clara, leave the phone outside, you'll be able to see it through the little door, and when it rings, if it's safe, you can go out and answer it.
And we had what looked like arms and hands, fingers. A leg, where you could feel the knee, the ankle, and the foot itself... and one of the bags, which contained the legs, had like little holes that had been torn in the bag through which you could look, and I remember seeing a toe. The dismemberment started with the right foot and went to the left leg, to the left arm, to the neck, and then to the right arm. The right arm, being the last, was cut off, but only sawed in half, and then it apparently broke, either by being stepped on or something like that, to break the bone.
"And that puts her in the city. " And then they would leave me alone. Did you ever speak to her that night? No. We trusted the police and the procedure, but it clearly failed.
Give me some milk! Okay, that helped. Wow, this place is garbage. CLEVELAND: Yes, it is, isn't it?
Why am I the only one who's never seen that ad? Because it goes on all night. And when you're not working, you're asleep by 10:00. Why would anyone want to kill the Pitbull? Maybe the forensics police will get lucky and find the murder weapon. In the meantime, let's take the body to the morgue and see what it can tell us.
I forgave you for yours. I know you weren't to blame for any of the ills that befell me. I remember when I couldn't be that close to you, or even hear the sound of your breathing. I cling to that sound now. I don't want it to end.
Previously on Teen Wolf What does the book do? It triggers the memory centers in the brain.
You know more than that. I think you need to focus more on school. All of you. If this place is so important, why didn't you want to show it to me before? The problem is that it's not so easy to find.
A port city of this size... I'm sure you see many strangers. We do. Most of them more than happy to answer my questions. And what news have you brought us? From Mary, Queen of Scots? Forgive me my bodily sins, Lord, for they give my heart the strength it needs to heal.
Yes. - Is something wrong? - No. It's silly, but I... I had imagined my son's room, green. - He's not your son.
- Which way? - To the other side of the station. - Where are you? - On the other side. He's right there.
I defined a level of smoking and a level of crazy. Hey, girls. Do you mind if I stay here with you for a while? Oleg's upstairs, he's trying to seduce me by cleaning the apartment. And he's so, so dirty.
The range of these phones is 80 meters. And yet we received this video 16 km from the coast. Whoever did this is a communications and IT expert. They hacked into the alarm and emergency system, reprogramming it so that it could be used with "Bluetooth". That's how it paired with my cell phone.
And the problem is that I hurt you. I hurt your feelings, and I'm really sorry about that. Last year, I came to you to propose, but I let our professional differences stop me. We love our work. It means everything to us. That's why it's easy to prioritize it.
I don't know what I want to do. But I know it's not for me, because it was disgusting. Are you hungry? I heard it's croquettes day at the snack bar. No, no, no. The problem with love is that when it goes well, it goes very well.
Okay, so why doesn't everyone keep their own? Because they can't! Among other things, the vector is extremely rare. Outside of Reiden, you're the only ones who know it exists. Only a few people inside Reiden know where it comes from.
A few weeks ago. So that's why you took me to bed so suddenly, so full of regret. You wanted me to believe that the child was mine. Of course I'd take you back. No, I wanted him to be yours.
Grey, I need help. I flew a plane. I had the controls in my hands. I don't know how to fly, but I flew a plane. We were in a plane and it crashed.
Don't call me "ma'am". Lieutenant Granderson, how are we doing? Clearly, a component is missing... The device used to control the Bluetooth amplifier. Without it, we can't access the Valkyrie network.
What about Bob, the guy with the test tube? He was working out with his trainer. Man, I don't get it. The algorithm only exists on paper, only here. He didn't walk out on his own.
Nobody's listening. Let's go. Watch. I've coded an app. It searches for radio frequency impulses.
The police couldn't find him. No mother or woman came to claim him. And that baby is now in an orphanage and will be fine. He's going to be fine. He'll grow up, he'll find it hard to get attached to people and he'll find it hard to give and accept love.
Do you know her? Where's your whistle? Where's your whistle? ! Where's your damn whistle? Where is it?
He doesn't believe it's true. Just tell him you have it. I mean, I... I have it. I mean, it exists, sir.
He was... He was my father's source. How can I find that article? You can't. It was never published.
Perhaps you don't understand this. I live by a 5,000-year-old book. I ask you questions as if you were alive. And you are alive. It tells me that you have a purpose.
I live by a 5,000-year-old book. I ask him questions as if he were alive. And you are alive. He tells me that you have a purpose. He says: "A superior person in an inferior position, graciously accepting a task, brings good fortune to all."
- Please. - Thank you very much. Tell me, how do you tell the real pieces from the fakes? I have a trained eye. He exudes a beautiful sense of history.
But we'll watch everything she does. And we're still without sonar? No, sir. Our engineers are trying to connect a depth sensor. But when we do, we'll put ten times more current into it than it was designed for.
There will be other, far more interesting projects than trying to take an oil company into the future. Of course. Come here. You're a force of nature. You make the world what you want it to be.
I only came here to see you because, as a former client, I think you deserve an explanation. It's a ransom demand after they've already killed the victim. I prefer the term transformed. Some ideas need a bigger ecosystem. If you give a buffalo a lot of hectares, it thrives.
It's a ransom demand after they've already killed the victim. I prefer the term transformed. Some ideas need a larger ecosystem. If you give a buffalo many hectares, it thrives. But put it on a desert island and in four generations, it withers away.
He really likes me! This is like Sally Field. I really like you too, Jimmy, and I'd appreciate it if you'd take the tissue samples upstairs and put them in my lab. I need to concentrate on the car. I hope you find out where he's been.
We need your help. Please tell me you're not afraid of heights. I've never wanted to dive into this aquarium so badly. Cooling off would defeat the purpose of what we're trying to do. With the temperature this high, when we receive the serum, it should speed up recovery, and in the meantime, it could prevent the virus from spreading.
What have you got? We found the formula in Karakurt's apartment. My plan was to reverse the process. There are millions of DNA combinations. If I found the profile he wants to destroy.
- No, we won't. We're not going to hurt you, Martha. But we're going to take your phone away and lock you in the bathroom. All right? All right. I must say that your hair... The way it wraps around your face is very attractive.
Okay, I think I know a few tricks I can use. Okay, I trust your detector to work, but when we detect it, can we stop it? I wouldn't be a very good Tony Stark if I hadn't thought of that. This malware is Ultron's destroyer. Guess what it does!
This experimental armor has formed around me, and I'm stuck here. I can't control anything! Really? What about the giant robot that attacked Avengers Tower? Did it go there?
It doesn't explain Elia. We have images of you outside her house - before she was murdered. - Elia was alive when I got there and when I left. Where's the laptop? Better still, what's on it?
Never mind. Sorry, my mistake. What have you got there, Chili? I'm developing a new product for the adult beverage market. So, in each box there will be miniature bottles of champagne and every time you press this button, it will activate a CO2 bottle and thus refresh you instantly.
So I'm worried that it will obscure the public's view. It will be very difficult for them to see your father or my boss, the ambassador. This is the desert. The sun is always somewhere. No matter where you move the audience, they'll find it.
Darling... I think we need to go out. Have an American coffee. And convince myself that I'm really home. I think, um, I'll go to my office, see if he's still there.
I needed more time with him, but he keeps going faster and faster, and there's no more time. We can't go back. We can't pause. The merry-go-round never stops spinning. He...
- That movie could change the world. - Yes, it certainly changed mine. - Why do you think they tortured us? - I feel like you're going to tell me. Because they know that that movie shows the world not as it is, but as it could be.
When I was a kid, I had a train with blue stripes. The coolest toy I ever had. I know that a magnetically levitating train is much cooler, but the color is still making me sad. Let's paint blue stripes. And by the way, it has to reach 500 km/h.
- Yes. Let the games begin. Right. Remember, pull the arrow slowly. Stay focused on the target until it's fixed.
I remember. I was waiting for you, Carrie. I was waiting for you to come through the door. Okay, now I'm a bit lost. I want a companion. Someone who knows the world for what it is, but who also knows that it needs to be improved.
He's our guest presenter this week. I remember when Sid asked me to present the pilot of this... crazy show. Everyone said, "Refuse. The show's a flop." Well, 35 years later, he's still going strong.
I see something. It could be anything, Max. Let's go! I'm serious, Max. It's probably nothing. It's the car he changed.
I was banging a weird girl who threw me into role-play. I don't want to hear that. Anyway, I told him about the book and he freaked out. He said he could translate it, no problemo. I'm glad we're sending evil back where it came from. I'm sure of that, but I'm a little sad that we're already disbanding our team.
He loves it. Listen, Pablo, let's just summon a tiny demon. - Like a demon rat. - Let's call Kelly. - So we can vote on this. - Listen to me. Every time I've faced evil, it's had this advantage over me.
It's the one on this map! It cost me 50 zenis, it looks real. How could you believe that? The same thing happened with that boat, the engine blew up because it was a starter. Without it, we won't make it to the other shore.
Just let me go in there and talk. They executed my men. Where are the Zygons? We need to bomb this place. It's infested with these things.
Not all families get along. My father hasn't spoken to his brother for 20 years. - It's empty. - Look for his cell phone. He was dragged away.
What's your car powered by now, chubby boy? Hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen. Yes, yes, wonderful. My car is powered by the wind! How it blows.
- Good evening. Since I'm not taken seriously because of my gender, a friendly guard has hidden my invention until a future time when a free woman has her husband's permission to look for it. There's a closet full of these things! How many magicians do they have in this place? Find my diary and it will lead you to my greatest invention!
A sake cocktail, please, and matches? You're lucky to be alive. Kido let you go because he still wants to find your girlfriend. Stay away from me, okay? I don't want to be part of your movement, whatever it is. When they saw me...
I meant pretending not to... You know... I didn't mean that we should make the same tragic mistake of getting married... again. Call it what you like... but, you have the ring you once threw in my face. And we're having sex regularly... so the only thing missing is a piece of paper. And your ring, not that you know where it is.
You know... I didn't mean that we should make the same tragic mistake of getting married... again. Call it what you like... but, you've got the ring you once threw in my face. And we're having sex regularly... so the only thing missing is a piece of paper. And your ring, not that you know where it is. I know exactly where it is.
I'm not like that. I don't care if this place is brilliant or innovative or a junkyard. In my opinion, it will always be the ship that made the Kessel work with less than 12 parsecs. This is not a foundation stone for me. I believe in this hospital and what it is capable of.
Quite a lot. It's state-of-the-art. And anti-coagulants have to be used in almost every surgery in the clinic. So he started using a cheaper substitute. Pocket the difference between what it costs and what he charges for Froße, and voila!
Is that a subtle hint? Would you like one of these for your birthday? Yes, please. No, actually, what I'm getting at is that this new model has a memory. It memorizes the decor of the room, the placement of furniture and objects, and automatically maneuvers around them the next time it starts the cycle. This is our digital witness.
- Here it is. - Are you sure? This is the book. - I knew I'd find it. - How did you know it was here?
And for God's sake, forget "Tommy." Tommy is an errand boy. Our experience, our knowledge, our ability to put very rich people inside an auction room and exalt their competitive spirit to the maximum. There's a lot of "new" money out there. If we can get it to compete with the "old", then, believe me, magic will happen.
I haven't had any tattoos. And it's... Counting down. Sorry, what? The tattoo is a number and it's counting backwards to zero.
It's vigilance. - It's a professional interest. - A preventive measure. You're still saving the world from me, then? He's still here, right?
They're exaggerating. They exaggerate all the time. History will be fine. Time will heal. It always does.
What if one last heartbeat is all I have? What if Time isn't healing? What if the universe needs me to die? The universe is over! It has nothing more to say!
These have been the best days of my life. And they are mine. Tomorrow is promised to no one, Doctor, but I insist on my past. I have a right to it. It is mine.
Have you found her yet? No. Someone moved her from London. I'm still looking for her. But this restaurant... He hasn't always been here, has he?
No. Someone moved her from London. I'm still looking for her. But this restaurant... It hasn't always been here, has it? It used to be on the other side of the hill.
I'm the Doctor. You'd better be, you have an operation to perform. Here's the entry wound, just below the hairline. E... Here's the projectile. He should have killed him immediately, but he's too strong.
Would you like a drink? Brandy Aldebarano. Help yourself, but don't tell Daddy. What's that noise? It sounds like he's switched off to conserve his batteries.
What's the point of having a boat if you never take it out of the dock? It's like camping in the living room. Over there. There are easier ways to make money than kidnapping. Mr. Braun needs to see the world as it is.
Why are you looking at me like that? Kelly, you have to be careful with revenge. My uncle always said, "Pablito, beware of anger, fear revenge. "Once you go down that road, it will forever dominate your destiny."
Kelly, you have to be careful with revenge. My uncle always said, "Pablito, beware of anger, fear revenge. "Once you walk that path, "forever it will dominate your destiny. "It will consume you."
I'm not the best person to answer. It's my first mission. - Is it? - Yes. I didn't get off to a good start. You brought the movie where it was supposed to go, right?
Have you traded church pews for sacks of grain? I'm afraid God may not recognize me the way I've been lately. Why is that? My heart feels so strange. Like it's beating inside another man.
Because I am grateful... For the peace, security and stability that this country has offered my family. Because... It's her. She is your target. Because I believe in this country and what it stands for.
Some of you may already know each other. Mr. Haas, welcome back. It's good to be back, sir. Now for the exercise. Learning to identify and stop an attack before it happens.
I know you think I stand in your way, Mr. Asher. But let me assure you that no one is putting the twins or their education at risk. And why the hell not? Because you're a good agent. You put your country first and your ego second, and when you're faced with ruining a good project and all the good it can do or keeping a secret and having parole stricken from your record...
It wasn't the middle of the training session. It was the end. Well, for those of you who made it, anyway. Because this job will test you. It will push you beyond your limits.
I keep thinking about copper braided wire. Why use that instead of detonation wire? Braided copper... It's non-corrosive. It's designed to withstand extreme temperatures...
Please, no more! - E03 ] - d3bug.mkv - . Programmers think that debugging software means fixing a bug, but that's bullshit. Actually, debugging is all about finding the bug. It's about understanding why the bug is there in the first place. About knowing that its existence is no accident. It comes to you to deliver a message, like an unconscious bubble floating to the surface, bursting with a revelation you secretly already knew.
It's a beautiful evening. The weather is nice, and I'm enjoying my cigarette. The bug forces the program to adapt, it gets involved in something new because of it. It works around and within it. No matter what, it changes.
I had minor corrective surgery. I was in bed for several weeks then. To help me fight the boredom, every night my father... took my bed outside and talked to me about the stars. Well done, Dad. So, this portal... How do we know it's not just a one-way door? I think it acts more like a valve.
- You don't need to justify yourself... - You're right, I don't. If there are no answers here, where do I look? I'm serious. Do you have any idea how I almost died trying to take this movie where it was supposed to go?
That's important. Daisy thinks I can be of value to S.H.I.E.L.D. But she said my fate is in your hands. Yes, it is, Joey. It is.
An energy pulse was detected inside our facilities just before... an apparent technical problem in Security. - Have you discovered the cause? - Well, ma'am, I think it might be the S.H.I.E.L.D. containment module we brought in. Honey... is it possible that your containment module tried to access the UCAA system? Absolutely. It searches any local network it can find.
Kisses. If your daughter saw him, he may well have seen her. If she had seen something, she would have told me. It would help if we had Elizabeth's computer. He's not here.
Emma crushed my heart. We have no time to lose. Arthur can't have this dagger. This altar is the place to keep it, but it's protected by a dangerous spell. If it's to keep the dagger safe, then can someone with it get through?
- Where are you now? - To the right! I can't see it. It's in front of you! There he is!
Now I'm curious. What other creatures could this bring? I like where you're going with this. Can this book take monsters out of Pandora's box? If it can, it could be very useful indeed.
Thanks, Dad. But we won't be able to leave it intact if we don't solve the Rumblehorn problem. Okay, then. When exactly did the problem start? A few weeks ago. We didn't even know he was on the island.
Don't give up! No! What's going to happen? No. He's absorbing our magic.
The name of the car was Kitt. Nobody rode Michael Knight. You're thinking too much, Summer. I'm Little Rick! Grandpa, I think when you put your mind in this young brain, it did what young brains do -- it pushed bad thoughts to the back burner and built walls around them.
The name is... Super God Warrior! Just as I imagined! Super Warrior God... If he has "God" in his name, then he must be a deity.
Elizabeth. Is it worth it? All this hunger? All this anguish? God tests us more than I can bear. God only gives suffering to those with enough faith to endure. Perhaps he has mistaken me for someone stronger.
Where's what, darling? The Book! The Book of the Damned. The Codex is here, but the book isn't. Where the hell is it?
He would destroy me if I ever hurt you. Do you forgive me? Of course. I hate seeing you in so much pain. I was drunk and not to myself, but the thought of losing you and my children, it brought a rage inside me.
Oh my God. I'm not sure you're allowed to use that. Just leave it. You know it never made any sense to me. The spell pointed directly at you, but the tests came back negative, and then it hit me.
Were the aliens premeditatedly trying to help Columbus? Perhaps some of the knowledge he gained from the maps, and that he would actually discover land on the other side of the ocean, was guaranteed to him. Could Columbus have been intentionally guided to this region not only by ancient maps of unknown origin, but also by extraterrestrial beings? Although Christopher Columbus' secret maps and charts have been lost, scholars consider them to be a key element in the creation of one of the most enigmatic maps in history. The Piri Reis map was dated 1513 AD, but what it illustrates suggests a geological knowledge unknown until the Modern Era.
Their eyes have image intensifiers to detect the slightest glimpse of potential food. Some sharks are so well adapted to life in the depths that they don't rely on sight for everything. DUENDE SHARK The duende shark is a living fossil, practically unchanged for 100 million years. Its long snout acts as a metal detector, sensing the tiny electromagnetic field created by the fish. In the dark, it drifts towards its prey until it is directly in front of its jaws.
14 species of shark live in these shallow waters. The conditions here change dramatically, twice a day. And that's what the smallest shark on this reef is waiting for. At 60 cm long, TUBARÃO EPAULETTE an epaulette shark could be eaten by larger sharks if found. So, while they're out and about, it remains well hidden.
The conditions here change dramatically, twice a day. And that's what the smallest shark on this reef is waiting for. At 60 cm long, TUBARÃO EPAULETTE an epaulette shark could be eaten by larger sharks if found. So, while they are out and about, it remains well hidden. He's waiting for the tide to go out.
The scorching Australian sun is no place for a shark. When the water finally drains, the epaulette is left to dry out. No shark can breathe out of the water. But the epaulette shark has a trick. By closing its organs one by one, it can live without oxygen 60 times longer than a human being.

But the epaulette shark has a trick. By closing its organs one by one, it can live without oxygen 60 times longer than a human being. And, if necessary, it switches to survival strategy number two. This is the only shark that can walk on land. It heads for the nearest water.
There is one shark above all others that combines every single one of these capabilities, and then some. GREAT WHITE SHARK The great white shark has it all. Speed, strength, stealth. And huge teeth. He needs them.
GREAT WHITE SHARK The great white shark has it all. Speed, strength, stealth. And huge teeth. He needs them. Of all the sharks, it has the most difficult prey to catch.
Speed, strength, stealth. And huge teeth. He needs them. Of all the sharks, he has the most difficult prey to catch. He hunts off Cape Storm, on the wild coast of South Africa.
And huge teeth. He needs them. Of all the sharks, he has the most difficult prey to catch. He hunts at Cape Storm, on the wild coast of South Africa. He specializes in hunting another predator.
If they lose their way, they'll get stuck. There are little squeezes and there are little gaps so, definitely, at the forefront of your mind is where you think about turning around and going back. So we definitely take it cautiously and slowly. Enduring these freezing temperatures, they find that the Greenland shark is perfectly at home in this frozen world. It certainly lives in a very hostile environment.
Andy needs a cage to get to the safety of the seabed. We're diving around colonies of suckers where they're hunting. It would be stupid not to be cautious. He's able to get a single perspective from inside the kelp. As the shark's attention is focused on the suckers, it must ignore Andy.
- His eyes follow me... - And me. Who? Who is what? Who? That half-naked man in the picture over there. Who's that?
This robot, which is part of the Geminoid series, was designed to look identical to its creator. But what sets it apart from other robots of its type... is the number of miniature motors, actuators, used to imitate human expression. While most robots use ten to twelve... the latest Gemino uses more than fifty. Inside the facial skin... there are pneumatic actuators... that pull or push the skin... and so we can reproduce facial expressions. The robot is programmed to mimic as closely as possible the movements that humans make while at rest. It responds spontaneously when touched... or when asked a question.
Perhaps thousands of years ago? Abydos, Egypt. 11 km west of the Nile. Inside this huge archaeological site are the ruins of the Hall of Osiris... where thousands of people gathered to worship the god of the underworld. Compared to the other gods, Osiris was believed to have lived physically on Earth as one of Egypt's pharaohs. He is often depicted with the winged disk of the Sun. While many scholars have suggested that this is nothing more than the worship of the Sun... this Sun, as far as the Egyptians were concerned, also had wings and descended from the sky.
- Dad, we're going to be late. - All right, darling. I'll send you an address. You have to be there at 4pm today. Well, we were right, Geitman was interested in Holder Industry's Sarin stock. We interviewed his supervisor, he said he asked about it two months ago.
- would never come down. - Yes. Built to last forever. Impenetrable. It lasted less than 30 years.
So Troyer must be weten ogen, like all the suitors. We know Troyer is. Find the third suitor, he's your killer because... Find him quickly, because this mission won't be over until you kill Frankie. And don't wait for Troyer to tell you who he is.
Our ancestors were unable to understand this. They mistakenly believed that these extraterrestrials were gods, because they came from the heavens, influenced humans and had supernatural powers. They were definitely not spirits or ghosts. The Mesopotamian story of creation talks about the existence of some elements that needed to create this working race that the extraterrestrial gods wanted to make. In order to get a body to work, you have to introduce a soul, so that it can function.
Come and get it. Shoot the transformer. Come on, Hank. I think it worked. - Is he dead?
Let's not rush, okay? We still have this last weekend of fun. Playing games and doing puzzles, baking cookies with our girl. It's pretty exciting, honey. Well, we all know that the past can be a bitch from time to time. But when it catches up with you, it's best to be prepared.
You, stay alert. If you see something, say something. Something. Where do we go first? To locate the werewolf, we have to start where he appeared.
That's why I love you, Edna. You're good at reading maps. Imbeciles. There are werewolf behaviors that will reveal his location. You mean where he eats?
You're good at reading maps. Morons. There are werewolf behaviors that will reveal his location. You mean where he eats? Where he sleeps?
Morons. There are werewolf behaviors that will reveal his location. You mean where he eats? Where does it sleep? -Where he defecates.
What did I miss? Now it's personal. How did the werewolf get a pilot's license? He has the intelligence of a man. Yes, but you'd think someone would have said something when he asked for it.
Maybe he disguised himself as a man when he went to the office. Shut your trap! To catch the monster, you have to think like the monster. So we think like a man? You said he has the intelligence of a man.
You need to stop, Dad. Things are different. Now it's all about the future. There are a lot of people counting on you. Look, let the finger go that way, that's why it goes that way. That's right.
- That's right. He doesn't post comments. It's through a proxy server, so it's untraceable. He recognized the first 3 plays in Detroit as his, but there's nothing on the site about the murder of Russell Pearson. - Why didn't he do it?
Don't touch it, it could explode! That's never happened with a helium core. - We need to evacuate. - I have a laboratory full of people here. I'd like to stop it from going up in smoke.
As we told the sergeant, we didn't know the money was fake. We believe you. Thank you, sir. But here's the problem. The person who printed that money -- who, by the way, is dead -- was trying to use it to cheat some drug dealers, which is why we need to know how it got into your hands.
Let's see, if he's been in hiding for 30 years, we need to find out what he was looking for back in the daylight. That could give us the identification we're looking for. Age progression software uses sophisticated modeling to predict the visual changes in a person as they age. However, the software can be used to reverse age too. Can it bring back my Afro?
Your orders, Commander. That's fine. Keep me informed. Well, the disposable used by the kidnapper has been disconnected. Forensics will locate it if he reconnects.
I saw the murders. I saw what Silva did to my friends. But he thought I was beautiful, so... He spared my life and... My daughter's life. That's why the DNA test didn't find a match. It only compared the victims' DNA.
Or the dream of being famous on YouTube. Okay, let's try again. Do you know any good mechanics who fix cars out of passion? What's wrong with your car this time? I think it hates me.
Okay, let's try again. Do you know any good mechanics who fix cars out of passion? What's wrong with your car this time? I think he hates me. He doesn't even tell me to put my seatbelt on anymore.
Machines know what people see, what they read, what they buy and even what they feel. They can tell us which people are a risk to public safety. Let me tell you right now that this is not pre-crime. The Hawk Eye algorithm doesn't predict exact behavior. What it does is record patterns.
Katy Perry. Kate Upton. Kate Middleton. I mean, I did all three and dated all three. By the time I managed to get Captain Wozzles' suit from the store, it had already been washed.
All set, my queen. My friends. We are on the brink of a great scientific discovery. Remember this day. For it will mark the beginning of a New World Order.
Your stolen painting is a treasure map. I'm pretty sure of it. Look at this. Here's the painting hanging in the Palace, just before it disappeared. And here's what it looked like when it was recovered 40 years ago.
It could have been an accident, but there's also another possibility: the pirates did it on purpose. I'm thinking that after they sacked Oahu, something happened that forced them to hide the treasure here on the island. Maybe the army was after them. Who knows? I think they hid the treasure with the intention of coming back for it later.
We had bros coming to school who recorded that freestyle episode on a Stretch and Bobbito box and the bros were back on, pause. Confession. The bros were scared to death because I wanted to mess it up. Even though we knew we had the freestyle, it would have been fine with everyone if you guys forgot to ask us to do it. The only reason you could hear KCR in the tri-state area was because we were broadcasting from the top of the World Trade Center. So the signal would travel, but it was a tiny signal on a small, scruffy station with a sign from the 1960s. Sometimes the left channel would go out and I'd have to punch it on the console and it would come back.
You've heard of a prism, right? We need your help, Solomon. The engineers realized that you tried to debug the program, not infect it. Did they find the virus? Was it still in the directory?
Do your friends here know our story? Do they know you got your ass kicked by a former cheerleader? Inmates only care about the present, the here and now. Is that why you want to get revenge by having me killed to regain the respect of your friends? I keep the past where it belongs.
What's that? It sounds like you're saying 3000 dollars. It's a Balmain. You have to pay to play, darling. We should take it to Melrose and ask for the money back. Then you can explain to Hetty why it never appeared in her closet again.
- No, no. On the rockers. Like... rockers. - Okay. - There's not much description, but she said he was white, wore a colorful jacket and jeans.
You have to believe that. We got into this for the same reason... to put an end to it. - Why are you here? - Because of Katya's notebook. What's in it?
Yes, probably nothing. Good night, asshole. Good night, asshole. The coroner showed me the sheriff's body. And he's been pretty badly attacked.
I once stole a plate of sweets from George Carlin's house. I wasn't proud of it. In fact, I still have it. He's... He's right here.
Oh my God! Watch where you're going, toad. I'm sorry, Laurence. When are you coming to do the show? If he still sucks like last night, never!
Yes? I had a very difficult night. I'm sorry. What happened? I saw your show and it sucks!
If they can imagine it and pay for it... She'll make it happen. How do you contact the Djinn? At the dawn of the Internet, a virtual fantasy world was created to connect people of all ages around the world. The technology became obsolete, but the site never went offline. Today it is a hidden oasis for freaks and weirdos. No digital signature. Tor encrypted on the dark web. It offers anonymity for new customers to contact Djinn.
- That's mine! - Come and get it! - Give it to me! Come and get it! Am I the only one who felt that earthquake? My God, it knocked down a house!
I'll double it! So, Gonzo. How do you feel after the fall? It looks like you might have broken your nose in like a thousand different places. No, my nose is the only bone in my body that I haven't broken. That's why it looks good.
This is the happiest day of my life. Well, I just hope you can do it - without hurting yourself. - If you're talking about the suit. I doubt it. It becomes part of him now.
That would be you. You have time to roll your eyes. Today, we just want to build a duck village. We just want to create your smile. Don't fight it. Here it is.
You hired Justin to transport the painting. No. I hired someone else. Transporters earn a commission for each delivery. The commission on that painting was worth six figures. Justin must have gotten greedy and changed his mind. We only realized after the real courier arrived to take the painting that it had disappeared.
Point the gun at me. Listen, that painting belongs to my family. My father spent his life looking for it. He died a bankrupt man. I will never allow it to stay in a billionaire's living room.
- Ask Elijah! What matters is that he knows what he's talking about. He helped write the ventilator patch. Checking the pharmacy now. Here he is!
Do you really want to provoke that space cop again, Quill? The real question is how did Titus follow us from Conjunction? It might have something to do with this beacon. Right, we're looking for a very large Pandorian crystal. It should stick out like a sore thumb in all this leafy green stuff.
Quill? What have you done? - Me? - It's the fungus! It's taken over just like the stone creatures!
I taped it to my helmet. He said it was what he needed. I'm from Nova Corp. We're all Nova Corps. But... I found the locker number you gave me, but it's protected by a force field.
It's called The Ballad of Sue and Lacy. It's a working title. I'm hoping a clue might come from outside. Are you wearing perfume? Uh, it's called Desire-Rx.
It's a working title. I'm hoping a clue might come from outside. Are you wearing perfume? Uh, it's called Desire-Rx. It has human pheromones in it.
- I found Gabriel. - The archangel? Gabriel cut the Utopium the night of the boat party. And you'll never guess where he is now. I walked through the valley of death, and he looks a lot like a crack den on Third Avenue.
He got a bit cocky and too greedy. What does that mean? There's no honor among thieves. That's very funny, coming from you. I'm not going to give you your money back, Mr. Van Zant, because it wasn't yours.
Thank you for coming. - Frank wasn't answering his cell phone. - Where is he? This way. - What are you doing? - He's in pain.
And you think he's human? Yes, I do. But I can't ask our lab to analyze it without telling us where it comes from, and we're already pushing it by suspecting Suzuki. I can send it to the FBI lab. Where is he at the moment?
Hell, yeah. The Ghostfacers didn't pick up the vibrations... of anger. - Do you think we'll see anything? - Do you know why I stayed in this room? It's supposed to have strong paranormal actions.
Well, you saved us, Len. Yes, that's not why I mutilated myself. I wanted to see if I could do it. It hurt like hell... but that didn't stop me. I cut my thumb like it was a mini hot dog.
And he... He couldn't lose me too. So... I didn't say anything. Fear hurts you. It makes you stand still.
So... I didn't say anything. Fear hurts you. It makes you stand still. Or worse... It makes you do something you regret.
I just... stopped here for a bit. A lot of value in this shithole anyway. Or would I be alone? I didn't bring my passport. Things used to be so fucking easy here. People just see the world as it is.
We don't want to, but I didn't want to make it known. I don't think babies like me very much. Sometimes babies point at me and I don't give a shit. I'm in an elevator and there's a baby in his stroller with a big board in front of him, as focused on picking up a Cheerio as a chess player. He looks at me and does...
I have two sisters and a brother and the four of us would go on a four-hour family road trip to Wisconsin. My dad was driving down the highway in our white station wagon with wood trim on the outside. Remember how fashionable it was for our car to be made of wood? Remember that time? We thought, "How much wood can we put in this car without it catching fire?"
I told you not to do that. Now they know about the bacon. What if they find out the rest? I've taken care of everything. I disappeared with the evidence. If you had a bacon-sniffing dog, he wouldn't notice.
What if they find out the rest? I've taken care of everything. I disappeared with the evidence. If you had a bacon-sniffing dog, he wouldn't notice. He'd be so bored he'd fall asleep.
I've changed my mind. S11E10 "Future Perfect" Pt-Pt translation: Rkocheckers "The clock was ticking loudly. I threw it away. It scared me when it rang."
My father would pick me up and throw me in the water so he could learn CPR. My father's most precious possession... Do you know what my father's favorite thing was, ever since I was little? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle chrome. An absolutely immaculate Mickey Mantle chrome. He kept it between two plastic sheets.
The victim is Lara Madden, a dancer from the show "Speakeasy". -She performed yesterday. -That explains the 20s dress. The ship she was working on was a Titanic-era ocean liner called the RMS Bently. It docked in Manhattan at dawn.
Anything you wish, Your Highness. Damn. Honey, where did you put my cell phone? Why would I go through your phone? I can't find it.
Don't you feel comfortable around disabled people? -It's okay, a lot of people are like that. -It's not like that. I'm very comfortable! Unless I approve your newspaper, it won't be distributed here.
And I want to be on her right side. Back to the classroom, kids! I like smelling trees! A school newspaper is attracting attention, and more and more people are refusing to read news online. I read Super School News because it doesn't try to trick me and the news isn't paid for by advertising companies.
PCs are being manipulated, unconsciously setting the table for humanity's new enemy. ISIS or ninjas? Something much worse. Have you ever felt that an ad had intelligence? That it knew what you wanted, even before you knew you wanted it?
What do we know? The victim is Petty Officer Second Class Adam Meyers, a culinary expert based in Norfolk. - Cause of death, Duck? - I'd say it was the gunshot wound to the chest. - He went through. - Time of death?
I'm going to make some calls. Wait, Delilah... I think you were right. About the sofa. It doesn't fit in the space.
I'm sorry. Why would Milo know anything about a stolen boat? Why would Milo know anything about a stolen boat? I don't know. Maybe he doesn't. Whoever took it must be crazy. It belongs to a man called Jesus. He's very dangerous, a psychopath.
Are you the physicist who placed the ad on OLX? - Yes. - Hi, I'm Vanessa Bennett. Sorry for taking so long to get here. I got stuck in a boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I saw your ad, and it saved my evening.
Nobody puts Drax in a cocoon. What took you so long? I'm running out of time here. Where's that arm? There it is!
So why weren't you affected? Because Quill hasn't matured yet. Or the Cosmic Seed energy in my Box protects me. It's probably one of those two things. Groot, is there any way you can dig out and seal that geyser before it melts all the ice?
Our economy is becoming one in which producers exchange services. I hate computers. I need you to hack into the federal server and kill that ransomware. I'm in, and it's not happening. Every time I try to break the code, it changes.
There's nothing between you and Erica anymore. You made that clear when you confessed your love to Carol less than five minutes ago. I'm the father of her child. - You're not anymore. - What's that? He's going to have a father.
Of course. So why do you keep repeating the word "headquarters"? Because every day I come into this place it tries to make me a little more like it. I've already done a lot. Now he can be more like me.
All right, then. Go ahead. The last layer of security is international jurisdiction. Before being admitted to the UN, you need to pass through the biometric hand reader. It maps the individual signature of your palms.
- Since when do you fight? - What are you talking about? - You were humming. - Are you sure? Sometimes, when my brain is really moving, it makes noises.
Cam, wasn't there a remote control that controlled everything? - I think there was. - Do you know where it is? Ours is always buried in the sofa. Here it is.
All right, whatever you say. See if you can find another sitter. Hey... I... I was wondering if I could have my trumpet back. We had fun, we played war. But it belongs to my...
Never, not a single movement. Otherwise I would have told someone. I tried to take my arm off Jake... That's what they call it... I tried to get it off, but it... It stuck like glue to Kristen's neck.
I tried to take it off, but it... It stuck like glue to Kristen's neck. Aaron, is there anything else you can tell us, anything that might prove your story? I have no idea what happened. Maybe... Someone hacked him. Maybe he went crazy on his own.
I stopped going naked about 20 years ago. And you started dressing up? For work? Yes. They found a body in the woods in West Virginia. He's being taken to the lab.
Let's go! Come on. Push the button. What button? I don't know where it is.
During this period, another seal might be captured. But that doesn't last indefinitely. As the summer continues, the temperature rises. Each hunt requires more energy, using up the bears' reserves. When the thaw ends, it reveals some of the richest waters in the ocean.
The tiger hunter's last trick is to approach without moving. Let the deer get as close as it wants. Then wait for it to turn around and step forward. The perfect attack... and a brave one. This deer is almost the same weight as the tiger. Instinctively, it hides its prey before starting its meal.
Has Jake gone mad? I don't want to talk about it, Abby. What else can you tell me about the needle? I got the serial number off the syringe and looked up the manufacturer. It indicates that the syringe came from a batch that was manufactured three months ago.
- Gail, will you help me? - Yes, of course. This is so exciting. Well, there's your baby. Yeah, there he is.
This deep-sea squid catches prey using long, sticky tentacles. Each one has a glowing lure, pulsating to attract the prey. A slight contraction increases the attraction. Down here, in the darkness, this meal is a rare item. The open ocean may be a vast blue desert, but like any desert, it has oases.
It's not designed for speed. Success here depends on delicate movements. Its tactic is to hide in plain sight, lulling its prey into a false sense of security. The lionfish's stripes confuse vision, making it difficult for prey to determine its distance. Using its extravagant fins to hide slow, deliberate tail movements, it gets closer and closer.

The lionfish's stripes confuse vision, making it difficult for prey to determine its distance. Using its extravagant fins to hide slow, deliberate movements of its tail, it gets closer and closer. It needs to get within a few centimeters, close enough for a lightning strike.
Come on, Bud. See, I've heard how dangerous the Banzai Pipeline is, but you have no idea until you're actually surfing it. I mean, th-this swell came out of nowhere and bent over section in... - Really. - It chewed me up and spat me out.
I recommend that you move all non-essential resources from Kharkiv and Luhansk to Mariupol as soon as possible. Yes, sir. Ephraim, can you wait a minute? Of course, sir. As you expected, our NATO allies are anxious for us to end this conflict before it escalates.
God! - One final push! - No, no, no! That baby likes a sweet before-and-after. Whether he leaves before or after, that future deadly beast won't be able to live.
Apart from a rather frightened fish, this one is empty. The octopus moves on. A rock pool might seem like a safe haven. But the octopus's suction cups allow it to move silently in and out of the water.
The only way to achieve something better is to find a way to get closer to them. The only way is the burrow where the chicks are and where they often return. To our surprise, the likely den is in a busy port. We're close to the Otters' den and we're going to set up the hut on the spot to do some close-up shots of the Otter. It's a strange combination, trying to hide from the animal when it sees us all the time.
It's yours. Darling, guess what I brought you. It's the latest model by Italian designer Artobert Donjuane. This suit costs 150 million won. He begs you to wear it.
I've been living alone for a while. I'm quite comfortable with the way I live. I think marriage is the only thing we should all want. Really? It creates another person.
They tell us, all of us, of all colors and beliefs, that we have to do this. They tell us that it is unacceptable that more than 50% of Selma's population is black and yet less than 2% has the right to vote and cannot determine their own destiny as human beings. They tell us that the local white leadership uses this power to keep us away from the polls and keep us silent. As long as I am unable to use my constitutional right to vote, I have no control over my own life. I cannot determine my own destiny because it is determined by me, by people who would rather see me fail than succeed.
I'm older than you, Alcides. And I'm heir to this throne. Let's back away slowly. Don't see your horse. No, let's run. Your horse runs faster than he does.
Your father was always there, Hercules. You just weren't ready for it. Zeus cannot alter the minds of mortals, but he has given you a gift. And I warn you: if you abuse it, it will lead to your destruction. Respect it and it will save you and those you love.
Íficles... return me to my home. Give me back to my father. The gods don't want this marriage. I don't want this wedding. But it will happen.
Am I an idiot because I believe in the legal route? Let's go. This is our job. Clock ticking. He's running.
Let's go. This is our job. Clock ticking. He's running. He's still running.
The father above! It's online! Mom! Mom! Oh my God, Mom, check it. He just went up.
Like the Bull of Crete. He fought it seven days and seven nights. That's a bit of an exaggeration. And he hit it 49 times with his staff. Maybe not that many. Until he died and Crete was saved.
The Shredder will force the city to live by our rules. We'll be gods. I'd already thought about... not being a ninja, but I did a lot of yoga for about... 10 days, but then I got a muscle strain. - There's the gate. - There it is.
A double-decker sofa? Yes, sir. Is that right? Like a sofa and a bunk bed? Is that what it looks like?
Hi. I'm Dick. Of course you are. OK. Is he, um, in the front at the bottom or the back?
My attention was on her a long time ago. I saw the accident report. And, there's no way that any of you survived... The accident was what awakened her spirit in the first place. The fear of seeing you dead made it wake up, allowing her to heal, making you create a bond.
Go on, say goodbye. Good night, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Has anyone seen my lighter? Look who it is!
They are leaving the bubbling lake to find a place to nest. Soon they will all have left the lake empty for another year. But there are worlds in Africa so dry that they seem permanently empty. The Namib desert. It's been here for 50 million years.
I've got to go. Will you bring me some paper? Paper. She wants paper. And I'm currently getting it.
You can't come here and ruin everything I'm doing, Dad. What's happening? Don't come towards me! Don't come, I'll blow this whistle again! If you don't forget your past, it will strangle your future.
So, tell me Mr. Karlsson, how are we going to get this out of me? Few people know the true origin of what we call today... clown. I can show you here. Take a look. He lived in the mountains. His skin was as white as snow. And his nose was red from the cold.
He swore to me that he would find a cure. That's the last thing I remember. When I woke up, the suit was gone. The curse had been broken. My brother had given the demon what it demanded.
Yes, we made a commitment. Sometimes in ways that didn't let us sleep well. But we did it so that people could be free. This is not freedom, this is fear. SHIELD accepts the world as it is, not as we would like it to be.
That makes me feel much better. Thank you. Thank you. I drew this holy well on my map, I knew it. We're on the right track. He'd better not have any snot.
Of course, Gus. Would you give them to Mr. Williams' ex-wife, please? And then escort Mr. Williams to his ex-car. You'll put the vehicle in her name. And you go to DeVaney Motors, ask to speak to Mike DeVaney, the father, not the jerk of a son, and sell him his new car again, for the "nabobs" it cost.
A pigeon! - What does the pigeon do? - It lands on a branch. Land on a branch? - And what did it do on the branch?
He'll tell you all about Jesus. How about that name? "Jesus". Ooh. "Jesus". He creates so much hope in so many, and so much mistrust in so many others.
Drinking a few whiskies... Fifty years old... Good ones. Here's to a bright future together! Whatever that may be.
Is it a joke? Did you add a zero to test me? The amount is correct. Where did the money come from? He received it as an inheritance.
"The ancient Greeks were masters of artifice, "although the base of the Parthenon appears straight to the naked eye, "it is actually completely crooked. "By placing a hat on one side of the temple steps, it disappears completely when viewed from the other.
Great. It seems... I think we'd better call it a night. Look at the size of that bastard! Look how fast he's spinning!
You don't even fight for the woman you love. Don't let your mother's death haunt you for the rest of your life. - This has nothing to do with it. - Look... Love is like a savings account. It reflects your investment.
- You didn't write it. - Oh my God! You're so selfish! That book changed my life. It inspired me to write!
- We're two flawed people. - That's your argument? - This isn't working. - Look, love is difficult. It's confusing, it's frightening. It's painful, it's horrible.
All right, fear is a primal thing, right? Hey, babies are born with it. It's part of our damn genetic code. We evolved and have survived because of it. I know all about fear, and it has no place in my world.
It's just us. I know that. But it will come back, and it will be stronger. Fear never dies. He wanted you.
Did you do it? Of course they did it, you dummy, look at the crime scene. There's no need to be rude. I'm just trying to move. I hired these guys to do it; accidents happen. It's an old car, miss. It's worth a lot.
Just... Get out of here. There's nothing for him out there. There's nothing for him out there. "The world doesn't want you. It doesn't want me."
That can't be right. That can't be right. It's a mistake, you'll have to check it. The body is actually still there. They'll need you to sign off on it. Before it can be sent back to London for burial.
After I ran out of the office, I had her meet Ricky. there wasn't enough time. So Ricky was the only one who could still get into the establishment. But it was too late. So the money is in limbo and everyone wants it back.
Well, I heard a story on the news... about a guy who ate an undercooked pork chop and... a worm swelled up his brain very quickly. Uh-huh. And to relieve the pressure, they had to cut off a piece of his skull. Oh, wow. They took a triangle out of his skull... and implanted it in his groin... so he wouldn't die.
This is attracted to other microbots, but that's impossible, they were destroyed in the fire. This thing is broken. Your mini robot is trying to go somewhere. Is it? Why don't you find out where it wants to go?
Are you crazy? What are you doing? I found out where your mini robot wants to go. I told you, it's broken. He doesn't want to go...
At first, I thought it was a coincidence, or a well-timed prank. Deep cuts in the trees in the forest. I mean, it didn't mean anything to me at the time. But now, with that dead deer in the road... He had four sharp-edged cuts on his body.
I'm not saying they're true, but... I think we're dealing with something that's not easily explained. A few years ago, I saw on TV, they caught a giant fish off the coast of Taiwan or somewhere like that. They thought the fish had been extinct for thousands of years. And, bam, there it is.
Three girls and three boys, who filled the house with laughter and jokes. We have a little guest. She wants to hear the story too. Let's all make a request. But quietly, or it won't come true.
To my youngest daughter. She's the most precious thing I have in the world. So I'll give you one day to say goodbye to the ones you love. Just say... "More than anything in the world," into your horse's ear so that he can bring you to me.
But thanks to Fred here, we got the lights back on in no time. Well done. Thank you very much. And the real belt? Where is it?
your father was the only one who saved my life. That whisky you saw in the cupboard? Yes, I saw you looking at it. It's a souvenir. He tests my will.
Oh, no. What's that? What is this shit? Oh, fuck! Where is he?
Would you like another? Earlier this week, patrolling the street, first call of the night, I pulled a baby out of the bottom of a garbage can. I'm giving him mouth-to-mouth breathing. He's already dead.
Do you hear the voice? Is that what gives it a name? What is it? - What did you say? - It says he's called.
I feel sorry for your children. They're not my children. That said, they're lucky. If you want to go home, you must follow the path of courage. And when the time is right, it will lead you home.
And with public awareness, smoking was banned on airplanes. And in 1975, states regulated smoking in public spaces and taxed cigarette packs. After we banned it, almost all of Western Europe did the same. What we see today is the Irish, Italians, Spaniards, English, French... They stopped smoking in public spaces. Today, we see cigarettes for what they are: an addictive, disgusting and lethal product.
Lovely. Thank you very much. Do you have a complaints department here at El Corazón? Hang on, I'll get a form for you. Here it is.
- No. I swear to God. - I swear to God. I can smell old people all the way up here. - Can you? - He's following me.
Tell me, what happened here? - My dog was killed. - I'm sorry to hear that. The blood. Where does it lead?
So why don't you explore some of your options? Well... I mean, I have to ask first. This isn't an exam, stop playing games. If this is a game for you, it's called... "This lead, not interested".
A guy who jumps off the tractor, but he wasn't a friend. But this thing? Look at it. This tractor has no fuel, no points, no plugs. John, it doesn't even have an engine.
What if we did? Listen carefully, Zarina. We don't manipulate magic dust. It's very powerful. But if we don't, we'll never fully understand what it's capable of.
Yes, yes, I saw her fly into the powder magazine. The blue magic dust. That's bad. Yes. Without it, the tree can't produce the magic dust.
Finally, it's paid for. Look, don't touch it. Do you understand? Shouldn't it have a diamond? There it is.
Hawking is basically saying that the universe exists because the universe needed to exist, and because the universe needed to exist, it created itself. It's like this: if I tell you that I can prove that there's no better food than canned food, because in all of history there's never been anything better, you'll think it's strange, and you'll say that I've never tasted anything. And they were right. All I did was reaffirm what had already been said. But Hawking claims that the universe created itself, because it needed to create itself, and gives an explanation of how and why it was created. We don't immediately realize that he's doing the same thing.
She died believing a lie. She died believing in a being out there who loved her... even when she was being strangled by death. A God who allows that, is not worth believing in. That's why, Wheaton, you'll discover... that the most fervent atheists were once Christians, but we took the blindfold off. We've seen the world as it really is.
- As usual. This is the problem. Murder. You stare intently at the body. Until it's burned into your head.
Come back to life. And then I found this. This is what the first policeman at the scene said. "I saw her body. It was everywhere.
I'm going to find out who my neighbor is. Be careful, okay? Please. You have a baby to think about, remember? He's not Josh's.
That night in the forest, he was on top of me and I thought, "This is it." You know, this should have happened when I was 8 years old. And it's finally come to me now. Death. He's following me and it's only a matter of time.
Everything doesn't matter except you! And let's face it, Dad, you're not doing this for the art, you're doing it to feel relevant again. You know what? There's a whole world of people struggling to be relevant every day! And you act as if it doesn't exist.
Hi, you've reached Linda Atkins' voicemail, please leave a message. Hi, Mom, it's me. Great news. I've got... a part-time job working for one of my teachers. It pays very well, so I'll be able to send him some money.
Don't you know what it sounds like? Oh, wait a second. That's the sound! That's the sound! It will haunt my dreams!
Plans change. No, they don't. No, they don't. Plans don't change. We had a plan, but it changed.
No. Wait. "Spying" isn't the same thing as just looking at someone. You'll get her back, I promise. But right now, he's going behind the monkey's back.
Mythical snake demon. It looks like a dragon. I say we kill it. What? No, he's asleep.
We have dinner once a year to talk about it. It's a big deal for us. Listen, could you take a look at that tablet for me? There's something wrong with it. It's losing its power.
Yes, Lawrence. Attila and your boy held the lady's guard at your stand. I don't know how long he'll hold her.
The others and I have been talking. Ahkmenrah's place is here with your family. He must remain here. And the tablet must stay right here, son. This is where it belongs, Gigantor.
I've never smelled anything like it, Sergeant. Do you know how to kill a horse? You stroke the... You stroke the horse's mane. He becomes your friend, and he does it like that.
I'll be out in a minute, darling. I'll be out in a minute, darling. I'm right here. This is good. Is that bacon good? It's been there for a while.
What are you doing here? We agreed to meet at the train station. I had to close Mrs. Blum. Why hasn't the game started yet? I need as many players as possible or it won't work. There's only one train to Zyl a week and it leaves in an hour!
-or punch them? -Oh, so you read my work. Yes, I read your work. I like your work. It really reminds me of some of the shit I used to write.
I told you there were tigers out there! I'm very unhappy right now! It's really dark out here He probably doesn't see you Oh, he sees me after all
You don't have to be such an idiot. Since you quit, I've had about twenty applications. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I didn't mean it like that. Look, I want you to see this place for what it really is.
It smells like shit. Where are we? I think we're in the place where the animal that destroyed Shorty decided to relieve itself. That's a lot of shit for just one dog that got stuck. Not only that, where did he go?
Get lost, what are you doing here? Look at that big, burly dog. He knocks everyone else out. He's yours for 8,000 guilders. - He's worth nothing.
This phrase is believed to be the key to all magic. It means that what is inside me also exists outside me. On Earth as it is in Heaven. As I am, so are my cells, so are my atoms, so is God. Ultimately, the world is as I believe it to be.
I think Israel has enough trees. And that's why, Mr. Bloom, we encourage children to plant a sapling in their own backyard. You never took your sapling, Mr. Bloom. No, no, that's fine. Here it is.
Now let's talk about a special case. The only living creature that uses its brain better than we do. The dolphin. It is estimated that this extraordinary animal uses up to 20% of its brain capacity. In particular, this allows it to have a more effective echo-location system than any sonar ever invented by mankind. But the dolphin didn't invent sonar, it developed it naturally.
Imagine a car racing down the road. Accelerate the image infinitely. The car disappears. So what proves its existence? Time proves its existence. Time is the only true measure. It proves the existence of matter.
The Next Generation. How it was born and survived the chaos of the first three years. I was fascinated by the struggle, not just the creative struggle, but the struggle for power. Those doors are opening in Studio 6 where the bridge to The Next Generation was built. Power is ephemeral, it's what is seen. For power to exist, it has to be recognized by those involved in the work.
He's right. - Don't give me that look. - I'm not giving you a look. I don't care how many law degrees you have, it doesn't give you the right to give me that look. There he is again.
Why is that? Are you recording this? No. Are you? The last time I saw my recorder, I swear to God, it was in a fridge.
Chloe, Chloe, look at me. - Are you all right, Chloe? - Yes. Okay, we need to be quick. Take this phone. It'll be safe for at least an hour.
You'd better get out of there or I'll come and shoot you. All right, Ben, I'm coming. The bastard's clever. Look at that sun, Ben. Looks like he's really taken a liking to you.
Okay, Ben, I'm coming. The bastard's clever. Look at that sun, Ben. Looks like he's really taken a liking to you. He loves you, Ben.
Paul. I just found a bunch of pictures. "John Madec moves jobs to Asia?" Look at that sun, Ben. He really likes you.
Both times, I didn't know he was there. He came to the first New Year's Eve concert I did. It was a street show and I was like drunk and singing. The whole band was out of their minds. He asked me how it went and I said, "Oh, it was good," and he said:
You have to understand your limitations. It's your limitations that make you the magnificent disaster that you most likely are. For me, that's where collaboration comes in, to take away an idea that is blind and unformed and that has been incubated largely in solitude, allowing those strange collaborative creatures I work with to become something else, something better. Well, that's really something. I mean, with the last record I was on, in Nocturama, it wasn't open like that ever again.
Sometimes the sky is so blue and the reflection of the sea so dazzling that you can't even look at it, and other times big black storm clouds slide across the ocean and you feel like you're inside the storm itself. What I fear most is nature. Now that she has sent her weather to take revenge, now we all have to put up with it. Soon, the weather will put on a real show. Interestingly, the more I write about the weather, the worse it seems to get. And the more interesting it becomes and the more it shapes the narrative I have prepared for it.
Aren't you a bit old to be having a teenage crisis? Your theory is all very well, but in the real world, you need a job. There's no job I like. Work isn't pleasure. It would be called leisure if it were.
You really want to drag me down with you. Look at you! You're so idle, even your hair doesn't grow. You haven't had to cut it in 8 months! Maybe it's reached its maximum length.
Like a superhero suit... I've become someone else. Someone said... Don't say that, it's an amazing name. It really suits you too.
I'm not sure if any criminal acts were committed, but some people have speculated that he may have seen something in Stonehaven that he wasn't supposed to see. Are you having any problems with the Danvers? No, but it looks like someone is. You mean the body of Richardson's son that you found? Yes, he was left on the Stonehaven estate.
Stamps, it's a hobby. This is psychotic. - How did it go with the prosecutor? She believes we have a strong case. Hopefully he'll hang himself this time.
Make and model of car? Yes. Ford Mustang. - You'll have no problem finding it. - Why? - It has a tracker installed.
What's this? Do you know what my favorite story about the Buddha is? It's the only one I know, actually. You bastard! There used to be a local monastery, but it fell into disrepute.
Just you and her. If you bring anyone else... you'll never see your little boy again. He won't show up. Would you leave your son without help? If he was a cheap son of a bitch, I would.
Well, it wasn't the end of the world for Washington. He got his troops ready to flee. But in daylight on that island, the British could easily see them and corner them. But then a fog appeared. It came and stayed until daylight faded and hid the American troops who slipped away unnoticed.
Believe me, I know all about this. You don't have a choice. You don't anymore. - We don't know that. - Yes, we do. Because that's where you are, Nessa. You don't control this secret, it controls you.
I'm tired of shouting. Henry? What are you doing? You know, I always thought that one day I'd bring my grandchildren here and show them Dad's old train. We'd dust it off, put the track back together and it would run again.
What if you refuse to decipher the code? We're both toast. So why are we still here? You have the logbook. Without it, the secret of longitude is lost forever. Let's burn it and get out of here.
There's nothing you can do to change your true destiny. You're wrong. We can always do something. I swore an oath that I would never use Satsui no Hado again. If it's the title of Master of the Ansatsuken you want, it's all yours.
What do we call the elevator? It's not called an elevator. What does this mean? It's a decoy. It only goes down.
That's what I'm doing now. Listen to me. At the end of the corridor you'll find some tunnels. Turn left at the intersection, and follow the sound of the water. It will lead you to a spillway and your freedom.
And it inspires... Any sensitivity? Anything? Everything's normal, Doris. I've brought you some Epsom salts to help dry up the milk when it comes in.
He who stands still dries up." So get moving... And eat. I think that's a symptom of living in the city. I've tried to find my appetite as it used to be.
I'm avoiding the Law of the Pack. You know, the one that says I should steal my son from his mother and raise him as one of us? I got this yesterday. But nobody really knows about this pregnancy, let alone that it's a boy. It has to be Santos. He's been anticipating our every move.
Well done. - Hello, there. - Hello, there. Anything on the GPS? My phone picks up Santos' car and it hasn't moved.
They weren't disappointed. It has been a welcome sight every 76 years since. When Halley's Comet returns to our skies, sunlight heats up the ice on its surface, once again releasing trapped dust and gases. Comet Halley's most recent visit was in 1986. And if you're watching this in 2061, then you'll know it's back.
Michell realized that we might be able to detect some of these dark stars because of their extreme gravity. If one of them happened to be close to a smaller, brighter companion star, that star would appear to be traveling in a tight orbit around nothing. Even if we can't see it, we'll know that something of great mass must be there. A black star, or as we call it today, a black hole. What would a black hole look like and what would it be like inside?
In the meantime, trees continued to sprout, die, fall and be buried by the mud that had covered them for eons. There ended up being hundreds of billions of buried trees, buried forests all over the Earth. What possible harm could come from that? This cliff in Nova Scotia is another kind of calendar. It tells the story of another world that once flourished here.
When that happens, the earth shakes. It's not because someone has behaved badly and is being punished. It's due to random forces that are governed by the laws of nature. Our sense of the Earth's stability is an illusion due to the very short lives we have. If we could see our planet through its own time scale, in which major changes take millions of years to unfold, we would see it as the dynamic organism that it really is.
Once upon a time there was a world not unlike our own. There were occasional natural disasters, gigantic volcanic eruptions and, every now and then, an asteroid would come quickly out of nowhere to wreak some havoc. But for the first billion years, it would have seemed like paradise.
This is the wreckage of Venera 13. In 1982, scientists and engineers from what was then the Soviet Union successfully landed this spacecraft on Venus. They managed to keep it cool for a couple of hours so that it could photograph its surroundings... and transmit the images to Earth before the on-board electronic circuits went haywire. Venus and Earth started out with roughly the same amounts of carbon, but the two worlds followed radically different paths, and carbon was the decisive element in both stories. On Venus it is found almost entirely in the form of gas -- carbon dioxide -- in the atmosphere.
Back then, at the biggest fair the world has ever seen, a forgotten genius showed the solution to this problem. Come with me. There was once a world that was neither too hot nor too cold. It was just right. Then there came a time when the life it supported began to realize that its lovely planet was changing.
If life had ever existed on Venus, it wouldn't have had the chance to avoid the hellish fate of its world. That uncontrolled greenhouse effect was unstoppable. There was... once a world... ours. And that world is now. There is no scientific or technological obstacle to protecting our world and the precious life it carries.
He was a 26-year-old minister who led the civil rights movement. Are you comparing yourself to Dr. King? Not at all, Reverend. What I mean is that progress rarely comes from those who are complacent. It comes from those who don't keep quiet about what they see.
Look at me. Look at me. No! No, Candy! We'll get him later, darling, wait until he stops.
This weekend sucks. Yes. I'll suck it. I promise, the first thing we're going to do when we get home is put my cell phone in the microwave. It'll explode like fireworks while we're making love on the kitchen floor.
