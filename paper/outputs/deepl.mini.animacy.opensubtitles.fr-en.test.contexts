Somewhere safe. That wasn't part of the plan. After all these years, are you still surprised when I improvise? No. But the mission was to destroy it.
Out of the car! Get out! Let's go ! Crap. He tries to reconnect it.
We were trying to get away. I'll give you a lift. No. Listen, dickhead, you've got to pull yourself together. Your car's too conspicuous, you've got to stash it somewhere.
Not great either. Has Ed been acting weird lately? Have you noticed anything? Weird how? Like did I see him with his idiot friends around the table looking at bank plans and discussing their plan to rob the bank?
Where the fuck is Ed? - Ed's laying low. Too much attention on him. Where's my video? We'll give it to you when we get the bag back.
You've got something on your mind. Do I know you? Can I say something else? I'll say it. No one deserves a minute of your attention unless it's returned.
- What's it like? It feels like your dick is wedged between two wooden slats. All right, I can... Shit, I can't reach it. Get under there and loosen it.
But someone always refuses. - Who won't? - Chen. And if anything happens to him, his property reverts to the city. Who do you think she'll sell it to?
I don't care, I'll get another you I'll get another guy who looks like you I don't need you and you don't need me Give me back my house key You can leave it with my new boyfriend
I'll get another guy who looks like you I don't need you and you don't need me Give me back my house key You can leave it with my new boyfriend You can leave it in the back deck
I don't need you and you don't need me Give me back my house key You can leave it with my new boyfriend You can leave it on the back terrace I don't care, when you leave it, leave a message
Who did? Lindsay. Why are you so mean to Mommy? I'm not mean to Mom. You drew a line on the floor with nail polish and said she wasn't allowed to cross it anymore.
He always shared his food. Do you have it in your mouth? Did you swallow it? I didn't really like that treat. And he wanted it back.
Uther, we cannot win this battle. I know Mordred. He will accept our surrender. Watch over the crown. Do not let it out of your sight.
If you're king, say so. The others will follow, unless you make the right choice. Do we understand each other? If words fail you, let the sword speak. Take it!
What we're interested in is what you're doing with that sword. Why don't you leave me with him for a minute? Put your back into it, darling. You don't have enough arguments to make this convincing. And if you like that sword so much, my Lord, you can keep it to peel your grapes.
Come on, let's go. Run for it! Down with Vortigern! You found a way to control the sword. I wasn't controlling it.
All right. All right, all right. I've got to get out of here. Excuse me, sir. Mr Rubino would like a bottle of Cristal in his office, immediately. Put it on his account.
- What's that? - There's another towel in the back. Take it. - I'll take it. - Put it on your father.
- Good-bye, Paul. Paul? Where are you off to? We had an agreement. Now you're breaking it.
Fate wants me to stop you. I didn't kill those women. You don't have to convince me. You know why I've never been caught? Because, when Providence beckons... I recognize it at once.
We've found out everything, Paul. It's the end of secrets. Maybe you remember this? - How come I've never been caught? Because, when Providence beckons, I recognize it at once.
What are you... What are you...? I'm really scared, guys! Stop it, everyone. Open your backpacks, get out your special tunnel survival kit, find the little glass vial with "light" written on it. And shake it vigorously.
Doesn't sound rocket science to me. Thanks, old-timer, we'll get you on the force. I'm watching a series called New York, Police judiciaire. They wrap up their cases faster than you do. You should watch it.
- Hi, folks. - Hey, guys. Mack, did you watch the game last night? Since when do I control the remote? Someday you'll get it back.
You're welcome. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! Dad, catch. There's no more room. You should put that somewhere you can find it.
- The map. Go ahead. Read it. And I'll tell you what... I'm not giving it to anyone.
After all, it's my inheritance. She will have the best and will never hear a breath from her feckless, drug-addled biological father or her prostitute mother. Nobody is better than nobody. In the end, I gave them the damn card. With a nice, cheerful drawing to sell it, it did the trick. WINNER OF THE "FÊTE DE LA COPINE" CONTEST
God is an absurd concept, imagined by incompetents who renounce all responsibility in favor of a magical friend. Yes, but there'll be cake. Will you be there? I'll tell you later. Our Father, we ask you to bestow your graces upon this water and sanctify it for its use today.
Go, go, Power Rangers! I'm not going the right way! Jason, I'm running backwards! Guys, look. Our city. She's destroying it.
Of reasoning. He wanted to destroy. I've been trying for 30 years to prove what I learned that day: the planet doesn't belong to us. Ancient species ruled the earth long before man. And if we continue to deny the obvious, they will take it back.
I know! What are we going to do? We're at the end of the island. Weaver, get up on those rocks and fire a rocket. Maybe Brooks will see it.
Spit it out! Spit it out! Gross! The monster's skin is too thick to pierce from the outside. I have to slice it from the inside.
Go to sleep! I never thought you could do it... knowing how weak and thin you look. I don't know how much longer I can hold out. Metal's too epaix. For the bomb to work, you really have to put it in Ego's heart
- It's so creative. - Oh, it's not clever... I can't take credit for this, but Justin had a tree house by the lake, Their dad made it when they were little. You should have it shown to you while you're here.
Did you report your vehicle stolen? No, he didn't report it. I'd know. His car's gone. We can't find it.
Isn't this your department? Yes, as long as we're notified of the disappearance. Better late than never. He doesn't know where the car is. He's been looking for it for a few days, so, yes, there's a good chance it's been stolen.
He doesn't know where the car is. He's been looking for it for a few days so, yes, there's a good chance it's been stolen. Stolen. All right, Mr. Jones, where did you leave your car? If we knew, we'd know where to find it, wouldn't we?
Send! I'll do it! Absolutely not. This music fills me with rage. We'll keep it.
The Hand is everywhere. - Why do they want you in New York? - Heroin. I invented a formula. You were going to manufacture it here and export it.
I wasn't born a bum. Yes. I'm sorry about that. Most people are just passing through. I need information about the factory, the guards, and the woman who runs it, Gao.
You said you were in control. I meant it. I've... - I've lost... - Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand, when you know how to control it.
I don't think so. I've been waiting for this moment. You seem anxious, Danny Rand. I need some information. Why should I tell you anything? If you don't, I'll cut off your head and feed it to the rats.
I was a kid. "A child touched by fire." Right? And the child grew up. Guilt is so unpleasant, isn't it? It's easier to burn it in the flames of anger.
I know you do. I love you too. Love, Mom. Transparency is one of The Circle's hobbyhorses. We live it.
A car... Which right now is in my warehouse. So, we're sacrificing everything... for a car? It's not just a car. It's John Wick's car. Sir, why don't we just give it back to him?
- It's beet season. - Looks delicious. Thank you for your time. Did you have any trouble with the glucosamine? I went to the vet. He said it wasn't necessary, so you want to give it back to me.
They do this every year. Yes. It's an anniversary. My arrival in this world is not something I want to celebrate. I want to celebrate it.
Please - it doesn't go with the outfit. - It doesn't. Put the sword down first. Promise me you'll protect it with your life.
What you're doing is very honorable. Therefore, I'm here to help you. Unofficially, of course. What's your plan? If there's another weapons factory, find it and destroy it.
It's that you love me. And you're not going to shoot me. You should have given him the suitcase, because I'm not going to chase you. All right, all right, all right. I'll take it over a dead girl.
You're going to have to get your hands dirty like the rest of us. Or if you prefer, stay a lonely dog and see where it gets you. - Hey. - Hey. Hi. Joshua wrote you a letter. And he can't wait for you to read it.
- Hey. - Hey, there. Joshua wrote you a letter. And he can't wait for you to read it. He wrote it all by himself and... I wanted to give it to you... but one of the guards at the gate took it.
- Hi, there. Joshua wrote you a letter. And he can't wait for you to read it. He wrote it all by himself and... I wanted to give it to you... but one of the guards at the gate took it. I know, I know, but... they're going to give it to me. - IT'S OKAY.
Joshua wrote you a letter. And he can't wait for you to read it. He wrote it all by himself and... I wanted to give it to you... but one of the guards at the gate took it. I know, I know, but... they're going to give it to me. - OK. - I can't wait to read it.
Ready to go? Come on, let's go. We're not messing around. You, put the gun down. Put the gun down, take the cocaine, put it in the case and shut up.
They're threatening. Money being offered... it's only a matter of time. Name one thing that's not a matter of time. They say you're going to sell gunpowder to the Republicans. The Republicans have no money, why would I sell it to them?
Until then, I bid you good day, gentlemen. Saddle up! To Molly House! I can't fold my whole life into five minutes. Well, you can pack it in or you can lose it.
- Where to? Lincoln's Inn. And why is that? There's a handwritten letter in the attic on my desk. You're to take it to His Majesty the King's secretary.
Hello? An intermittent lobbyist who thought the war in Afghanistan was futile. Is this some kind of joke? I'm not going over there. Until he was offered a lot of money to sell it.
- That's not the point. What were you doing on television? Why are you on TV? We've got to make up for it. We're trying to hush it up, and you're throwing the spotlight on it!
NI "X" in "dog"! What does Oscar Grouch's foot look like? Nobody knows! I've got a TV for Bart Simpson. Put it with the others.
Put after one too many show-off shots, Homer Simpson had something he'd never had before: enough. Uh, son, some of the other parents are complaining. Apparently, they're attached to their child, And they want to see their child touch the ball. They can touch it for the team photo.
Not in public. You too? Go back to bed! I love this song. Shall we play it together?
Hi, Bob, it's Danny. I was just heading back to Florida, but... I've got a couple of things to take care of back in Texas. So... I'm gonna send you a letter. If you could hold on to it for me, that'd be great.
I promise you, someone is listening. It all started with a pothole. So, the song that follows is written by one of my fans. Her name is Diwata Jones. I thought I'd sing it and send some love back to her... BASED ON STEPHEN KARAM'S "DISCOURS DÉBAT" since she likes everything I post on Twitter.
Anybody else. If he doesn't kill anyone else. All that matters now is getting through the crack. Then you're out of luck. The crack burns everything that crosses it.
I'm really sorry. - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - Tommy. I know I should have called, but I wanted to surprise you, and my key wasn't working, so I set off your alarm, and I may have broken your door. - But I'll fix it.
Missing lieutenants? Unpaid bills? [Darling, it's hard enough for me to get a decent cup of tea around here, so forget about the mutinies on the inside. I think you'd rather destroy the company than leave it to me.
[Honey, it's hard enough for me to get a decent cup of tea around here, so forget about the inside mutinies. I think you'd rather destroy the company than leave it to me. Margot. [Your father and I built this company, for you and for Rhys. You didn't have to take it.
Your King Edward VII was dazzled by this beauty. I see, I see. But Your Majesty, just out of curiosity, how much is this sword worth? Let's just say that if I send this to the Indian National Army, Bose's army will get everything it needs to free India from your grip. In that case, perhaps I should steal it from you.
You'll be Francis Llewellyn Poncherello. That name sucks. That's a lot of names. Well, that's too bad because we've already done the biography. What are we going to do, change it?
I know it sounds crazy, but... The tape is a gateway to the afterlife. So, why is she dead? We've got 7 days before we die. All you have to do is watch the tape, make a copy, show it to someone and you're done.
Better for whom? Three little dots. Don't do that. Three little dots. My life is better with you.
I don't resurrect, I give life. Life is my gift. That I give. Great, great. Great, because I happen to have a reason to live. And it's... so close I can feel it.
You've been chosen because of the physical advantages you've enjoyed all your life. With your natural gifts and our determination, we can be part of something bigger. Something perfect. The Coagula procedure is a human miracle. Our order has been developing it for many years, and only recently has it been perfected.
I was talking about your ass. But the lights are nice too. He sent you, didn't he? Rainer wants you to forget about Locked. If they make me an offer, I'm taking it.
- What? What? You want ice cream? - No. Even less if you eat it.
Then I went to court. And I was transferred to the California Supreme Court. I was indicted for fornication in a public place. The state strikes against obscenity I said, "I don't put my dick in these women. I put it next to them.
Dude, just aim and pass. You'll feel better. We gotta fix that window, Tyler. It's about time. They're gonna break it again.
They're rotten. Zach didn't throw the letter away, did you know that? No. He showed it to me. He asked me if I wanted to read it.
Zach didn't throw the letter away, did you know that? No. He showed it to me. He asked me if I wanted to read it. And I couldn't... read it because... I'm starting to understand why she did this.
You knew where it was coming from and what people would say about it. I realize that I dreamed of someone listening to me... and you did. Then you made my innermost thoughts public. This is her handwriting. I recognize it.
They're in for a world of hurt. Is there anything for dinner? Pass me a beer. If you're hungry, honey, go get us a pizza. We could have it delivered.
What the hell happened to you? I'll show you. Couldn't this wait? Copy that tape. I'll get it back in class.
You're not up to it. All this has come at a high price. By lives. By arms. Legs. This peace with the Saviors is painful. But it is peace. I must preserve it.
Welcome home, mullet. There are others in the library. Lots more. You have a library? Your buddy Daryl ran off before he saw it.
Right away, if you like. - Anything I can do to help? - No, you can't. Can I, uh... - Can I take you back to the cottage? We have a delivery, but I might miss it.
You never know. Yes, I'll show you. Look for the first one. Cross in the palm of your hand. The top loop, you pull it down, then up and through again, like this.
Uh-huh, it's, uh... What's this little trinket you got here? It's-it's interesting. It's our shiny stone. We carry it with us out of sacrilege, to remind us that there are no gods.
Oh, crap. Rick, you're up. Barely. We're under automatic turret fire. Can you deactivate it?
And Flint? You think the war is over, but as long as we live, it will continue. If we succeed in recapturing Nassau, what will become of our old friends who welcomed the Governor so warmly? I've come to offer you the chance to regain our friendship. Or rather, to redeem it.
You're going to kill me. I have to go to Phoenix in the morning. I'll be back Thursday night. But it's the premiere of the play. I'll go see it when I get back.
- No. Nathan, if you're trying to be funny... That's not funny, Nathan. It's shocking... It's a little disturbing, but let's separate the nobility of the cause from the means used to serve it.
Derrick Flout. Derrick, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Derrick. Same here. Let me get this straight. My role is to accept your loan application, or not, and pass it on to the underwriting department, which is in another state.
Nobody's going to buy a painting! Well, not you, anyway. The family won't buy anything. I don't want your pity. No ponchos, no acquisitions. If you like a painting, I'll give it to you.
My brother. My brother. He was in my office. He put his schwanz in the cup Esther gave me. I had to throw it away.
Because I won, see? I won. He spent his life watching trash piss on his shoes. So I went up to him and said, "That's enough, now. Let's forget this silly quarrel."
You're my bodyguard. It is your duty to guard my body. Isn't it? Not if you rob a bank. In this case, my body will enter the bank, not rob it.
- Agent Meyerson. If you're ever looking to make ends meet, give me a call. Do you have my card? - Yes, sir, I do. - Please don't lose it.
The captain's right. No one asked you, sans-cou. The protomolecule. What are we going to do with it? Simple: stick it behind a torpedo and shoot it into the sun.
A form of life. Probably extra-solar in origin. Extraterrestrial life? According to the geek who discovered it on Phoebe. Whoever dropped it on Eros irradiated everyone to spread it faster.
Someone has to stop these idiots from killing each other. I'm not passing. All right, then. I'll clean my cabin. Leave her be.
Do you hear me? He violated our agreement. I heard that. How's the FBI going to react? Go tell him to pull it out.
Open up and get out! Open the fucking door! ... arrests for attempted murder... What are these? According to the President's Chief of Staff, these are officials from various departments, including Defense and the CIA. The President is sending a clear message. Our democracy is strong and resilient, and we will do everything to defend it.
Anyway, things haven't been great lately. So you decided to pull out all the stops. Put a ring on her finger. Yeah, apparently I do that. Can I see it?
I'm from Bebbanburg. Yes, you are. Are you planning to raise an army? Last night I was a slave. Raise an army and I'll command it, but only if your intention is to go against the lords of northern Kjartan.
They do, but the Danes rule. Although the warlords have to look elsewhere, to Ireland and Alba. War makes a man rich. I disagree. War is like a man taking his wealth, Earl Ragnar, it's land and trade that make it.
A pimple waits until you're 12 to squirt in your face. All right, then. The lady has carte blanche. Nothing stands in the way of the lioness. For you, just one rule - remember it well.
The person is gone. Maybe you can have mine. After receiving a saline solution, you'll undress outside. Once in the truck, you'll see the cab at the back. Join her calmly.
He went east, but we lost him on 13th Street. I found out why Bin-Khalid's people want the safe. Inside was a flash drive with a list of sleeper cells that Bin-Khalid has set up here and the codes to launch their attack. There were 15 or 20 of them, but I didn't have the list very long. He's going to sell it to the terrorists if we don't give him what he wants.
Search him. Stop it, you'll break his arm. I said search him. Stop it, calm down, okay? Take his gun and throw it over here.
They found us. They killed the rest of the team. There was a key containing a list of sleeper cells with all the codes to activate them. - You're saying Grimes still has it? - He said he'd sell it to the terrorists if we didn't give him what he wanted.
I'm trying to help you. Everything you've done since the beginning has been the opposite. I never wanted the terrorists to have the list. There was a simple way to do that. Don't steal it from me in the first place.
I just heard from Keith. An operation Eric Carter ran turned up a promising lead. We may be able to find Jadalla without your father's help. CTU launches an operation. Keith asks me to oversee it with him.
I think you need to see this. A video of the fight against Gabriel's men has been posted online. Although none of the police agencies have confirmed their involvement, at least one of the victims has been identified as ex-military... I've ordered an immediate blackout. How the hell did this get out? A journalist must have posted it.
- To get to Eric. And when they do, they won't need us anymore. Jadalla has my wife. And he also has my brother. The USB key containing the list of sleeper cells has been damaged and he needs someone to fix it.
Jadalla has my wife. And he also has my brother. The USB key containing the list of sleeper cells has been damaged and he needs someone to fix it. You're not telling me to fix the key, are you? I'm asking you to help me destroy it.
- Nor in 1960. Nor in '61... - Okay, we get it. And what about this "total disinfection"? I was going to do it before reopening, only he asked us to stay closed.
Dr. Gould reportedly asked Gibbs to reset JASON before the tournament. - Is this normal? - Yes, JASON was behaving strangely. It's very common. You stop the machine and then restart it.
It's more valuable than bullion and tampons combined. Bleach okay? Let's see if he survives before you thank me. Someone forgot to do his laundry. You want to put it on my side, cowboy?
- Give it to her. - What? No... No... It matches my dress. It's an outfit. It makes you look fat. Give it to her.
Preparing to receive his samples... has been the aim of our mission over the last few months. But the Pilgrim capsule is damaged. At 06:30 UTC... Rory Adams will perform a spacewalk to establish visual contact with the capsule and retrieve it with a remote-controlled arm.
Its filaments resemble cilia, longer than anything we know on Earth. I'd say flagella. - What's the temperature? - -110°C. Start bringing it up.
We've summoned some kind of otherworldly killer. My friends have split up and I... won't let them fight the beast alone. Do you want me to go with you to Fillory? This could be a solution, a weapon. If we find it, we could kill the Beast. - There's a price.
The food is succulent. Let's sit down. - Do you know this place? - A binding word? I suppose the other segments enchant the dagger to kill me instantly if I ever break it.
- For TV. - For TV. Really? In a jury trial, there are two stories. The jury chooses which one it likes best. The story and the way it's told is what counts.
- I'm a writer, John. I don't see how that makes me a coward. All you do is write! It's the only freedom your fear gives you. You write about life without really living it.
She's safe here. I'm really sorry about the park... and about lying to you. It won't happen again. Thanks, I appreciate the apology, but the time machine is still broken. Let me help you fix it.
He started touching my legs to remove the ants and lifted my skirt. I was hysterical, I hate ants. And he knew it. He was just pretending. He took a picture of me and told me that if I didn't undress, he'd put it on the Internet and my parents would see it.
Hello. I left a message on the answering machine. I was at Marta's, from high school, with some other girls. You want to live your life? Then you'll have to pay for it.
- No, I don't think so. - All right, then. - How about a bathroom break? - Yeah, sure. Uh, are you going to help me, or do you want to hold it for me?
What happened to my picture? I... was just tidying up. I accidentally... ran into it. Look, I can replace it.
Did you tell him it was your business? No. I never did. Must be my aura of authority and natural knowledge. You can take your aura and put it on...
I'll show you. She's still stroking Chelsea's thigh with her hand. Still? This was Coach Field's first meeting I don't know why I can't find her, but if you'd seen the photo you'd understand why everyone's so embarrassed.
Why was she gone? She was gone. I don't see why that matters now. You have the ring. Then why does he keep taking it off?
It's a simple test. Just to see where you're at. We won't know until you try. Good. Good, now put it in your left hand, crush it.
Previously... I saw her find a puzzle piece, it was hidden and she knew where to look for it.
Are you offering me a deal? One you can't refuse. Alistair and his group hated me because of my strength. Now they despise you. Creatures like this only respect one language, and I speak it fluently.
Do you understand? Before you know it, you'll deserve to survive. I hope so. The generation that inherited the Earth. They have 6 months to save it.
I bet there are. But what if you're wrong? If there's no oil, will we lose the ranch? It's always a risk. Every time you find suitable land, someone's bound to try to steal it.
That's why we do counter-expertise, understand? The European Association for Diabetes Studies was counter-expertised, or the... I don't know which study you're talking about, and being unable to see it, - I won't comment. - I can show it to you.
Amen. Amen. You want to know what I was praying for? The bathroom door squeaks. I can fix it.
I won't last another four years. It was supposed to be a week. - Poseidon left us here to die. - We still have a card to play. I didn't want to play it, but it's already been thrown.
Slide into the air vent. I'm not leaving you. Your power armor is in the skiff. Why did you bring it? Get it back, come and save our asses.
Just listen. This thing tears through steel like tinfoil. It doesn't need air. It doesn't care about bullets. You think an electric shock will stop it?
So they don't think... you know. Do you happen to have a nuclear warhead around here? We took it off a torpedo a long time ago. A good Beltsman never throws anything away. So we're going to carry it off-hull until we get to the cargo hold.
Do you happen to have a nuclear warhead around here? We took it off a torpedo a long time ago. A good Ceinturian never throws anything away. So we'll carry it off-hull until we get to the cargo hold. And then I'll pull the protection, and you throw it away from the ship.
The head is open. Guys, guys... It's working! Roger. Prax, the moment I remove the locking system, the chamber will want to close, so I have to keep it open manually.
You wanted a brother so badly. To have someone to share your pain with. - Stop it! - I can't, Clary. This empty feeling that consumes your soul and makes you want to die, day after day, it never stops. Accept that pain and use it.
You doing okay? - I tried to stay. They... - It's okay, it's okay. You know I didn't kill anyone. But I should still let you off the hook for the beating I took. You deserved it.
It's a compass. Compasses find things. Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny? It can be used to rewrite reality. How do you find it?
What are you having done? Brain surgery, don't you see? - It's down there. - Good. 'Cause you'll never find it. Because you'll never find it.
Good to see you, too. We want Strange. You're free to go. I know in your own way you love this city, and Gotham is bleeding to death. We need this bastard to heal it.
Please don't say that. - We'll get you some help. - Just listen. You listen to me. Make this town yours... or destroy it.
I haven't... slept. I thought the NSA was a dead end. The file was deleted. Yeah, but then I remembered that nothing on the internet is ever deleted. Everything leaves a digital shadow, and I scoured the dark web, trying to find it.
Oh. So no more secrets. Thank you. Thank you very much. What's that letter in your pocket? Uh... Emma asked me to take it so no one would read it.
Walker was on his way to the hangar. That's where the bomb is, every time. Felicity! Why this sleight of hand? Why sell a nuclear weapon once when I can steal it and sell it to some other rebel scum?
Just do it. What were you doing with a gun in here? The way I marked the guy, I'd say I was saving people's lives. Your security said the shooter dropped his main weapon. We need it before the police get it.
Oliver. We're not targets. We're your teammates. We're your strength. You give me strength until Chase turns it into weakness.
But you told me to atone as a Spartan. And if that's true for me, it's 100 times truer for Green Arrow. You can't run away, buddy... The hood's part of you. Don't you think you deserve it?
I don't think that's gonna work. Wait a minute, wait a minute. You said the hatch was titanium, right? Yeah, it was. Hydrochloric acid would turn it into Swiss cheese.
So stop wasting my time. It was my epiphany. For true retribution, I couldn't just make you suffer. I had to wake you up, open your eyes, show you that the pain you're suffering from is still inside you. This drug helps release it.
We've lost a module! I want those scientists alive! Nothing happens to this guy! The protomolecule wasn't there by accident. If we master it, we can apply it.
Deimos was no god. He represented the horrible fear that accompanies war. Can you imagine what it would be like without the moon? Our moon? Never to see it again in the sky.
You want to ask them questions, and they're not just going to talk about raping children. But if you show them photos, they'll go on and on. I spoke privately with Cortazar. Eros is his pedophilia. You were talking about putting a stop to it, taking it away from him.
Previously... Crap. "Protomolecule." They named the damn thing. What are we gonna do with it? Stick it on a torpedo and shoot it at the sun.
They've named the damn thing. What are we going to do with it? Stick it on a torpedo and shoot it at the sun. It's too important to destroy now. - We'll hide it.
A form of life. Probably extra-solar in origin. Extraterrestrial life? According to the geek who discovered it on Phoebe. Whoever dropped it on Eros irradiated everyone to spread it faster.
Someone has to stop these idiots from killing each other. I'm not passing. All right, then. I'll clean my cabin. Leave her be.
This is her 16th birthday locket. - Are you sure this is Rebecca's? - Yes, I'm sure. I wanted to buy her a housewarming gift, not to invade or judge her, but to be a good mother. I went on the Internet to find her new address, since she refused to give it to me.
This man deserves our respect. Fuck respect. A gift for you. We'll tell this story, Shadow. Tell it how you like, or not.
I said to myself... "See what this dumb white guy wants." And he tells me about his secret place. I said to myself, "General. Big boy, why the hell do you want a plane... instead of a bomb?" I've had bombs dropped on me since I was a kid. And I thought... as long as we've got the bomb, we might as well drop it.
This Friday or not at all. I'll be honest with you, Mr. Mayor. I'm not a fan. I'm not going to hold back. My audience expects the truth and I'm going to give it to them.
Yet they all failed. You must be the only person in history to kill people for the sole purpose of finding a life coach. You should abandon riddles. A good riddle never reveals its author. To solve it is to solve the mystery of the enigma.
Do you really think that by telling me a transparent anecdote, - I'm going to go back to Selina? - Not at all. Sylvia and I have cleared the air. It seems Miss Kyle is offering you the same opportunity, and I'd advise you... to take it.
Harvey, you're the captain. I want you to open an investigation into Frank Gordon's murder, and I think Jim should be questioned. You're accusing Jim of killing his own uncle? - Why would he do that? - I don't know, but I know he's involved, maybe not in his death, but maybe to cover it up, make it look like suicide.
You think it's part of you, but it doesn't have to be. Do you know why you were so easily beaten? Your rage, Bruce. It blinds you. You try to control it, yet it's controlled you since that night.
That's true. But the strain only survives a few minutes in the air, and in this restricted space, it will only affect guests. But in the open air, the radius of infection will be almost a kilometer. This is just a test. Place it in the middle of the room.
I gave him a way out. Can you imagine that, Jim? I left you an escape hatch. Have you found it yet? You should have found it by now.
Please don't say that. - We'll get you some help. - Just listen. You listen to me. Make this town yours... or destroy it.
Antibiotics won't work. We have to do something. Doing nothing is not an option. What do you do when a banana ripens too quickly? - Put it in the freezer.
I couldn't beat Solovar in combat, but you could. You did, and now I'm the new ruler of Gorilla City, and all the gorillas will follow me. Solovar never wanted to attack Central City. But you did. You took my home away from me, and now I'm going to take it back!
But you're going to have to live a little longer. Long enough to watch Iris die. The blade didn't hit your organs, but it shattered your collarbone. Hang in there, buddy. - We've got to get it out.
- Is it over? - If Savitar gets the stone... He'll escape for sure. We can't get rid of this stone, Wallace. You're not fast enough to throw it into the Speed Force yourself.
That's why I'm here. No, Jay, you already went through your own hell when you were Zoom's prisoner. And you freed me, and I owe you. - Jay... - I've run a hell of a race, but every marathon has a finish line. It's time for me to cross it, but you... You, Barry, have to end this once and for all and stop Savitar.
- Yes, - but it was well thought out. - Now, wait a minute. Are you saying that my ideas about... Velocity force. Velocity force, that we can control it, manipulate it, all that... is it true?
I still know how to do everything. I can teach her. All right, then. That's how you beat Savitar. But there are plenty of villains left in this town, and no Flash to protect it.
- Happy? - Yes, we are. The inspector and I... sorry... Chloe and I are for real. I didn't think it would happen, but it has and I have this funny feeling... I can't even describe it, but... I feel invincible.
Anyway, I flame this Hell, that's where they made me An artist and an arsonist I'm a pyromaniac Exploded on the stage, then I heat it up
I just need a little more time. You're off the case because it's closed. AR's new boss. Ms. Anika Lyon. You built this company on my back, and now you're giving it to that bitch?
We're gonna need more wood, honey. Watch this video first. That bear is going off on these guys. No, that's not why we come out here. We come here to commune with nature, not watch it eat people.
And something else. Vodka? Something like that. He'd been drinking. I could smell it on him...
Who are these flowers from? I don't know, sir. They were lying on the doormat. With a card. Do you mind if we take this?
Back to work! Back to work. - Action - Blanche, you'll never sell the house. And you're not leaving.
And you won't leave her. Ever. And... action. Blanche, you will never sell the house. And you'll never leave...
We haven't balanced the images yet, Joan. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about that. Blanche, you're never gonna sell the house. And you're not leaving. You're never leaving.
Your client understands that if he violates these conditions or is arrested, the crimes he confesses to will be prosecuted - and then some. - Yes. And please know, Mr. McGill, that as an officer of the court and a member of the Bar, we will inform the New Mexico Bar Association. I have your statement. Has everyone had a chance to read it?
We ask a lot of you. And if you don't feel like it, we can stop. - And save you the trouble of testifying. - No. Only I can explain why this tape was made. Or the defense will throw it out.
Please continue, Mr. McGill. Without physical evidence, I thought a recording was my best bet. I knew the evidence was meager, but it was a start. A basis for a solid case. Jimmy must have thought the tape alone was already concrete, or he wouldn't have come to destroy it.
Today. I have it right here. You did a commercial to make commercials? I'm beginning to think I'm on to something. Let's have a look.
An appreciable fraction of the value of the portion in New Mexico, but without paying the duties themselves. A kind of indemnity. But no taxes to pay. Would that make sense? If someone came to me with that offer, I'd take it.
He pays with two dollars and this coin. I knew right away what it was. 25 cents, George Washington. I said to my father, "This coin is rare. It's worth four dollars." I didn't have time to finish before he went out to give it back to the guy.
I knew right away what it was. 25 cents, George Washington. I said to my father, "This coin is rare. It's worth four dollars." I didn't have time to finish before he went out to give it back to the guy. When he can't find it, he sticks it on the cash register, hoping the guy will come back so he can give it back.
I said to my father, "This piece is rare. It's worth four dollars." I don't have time to finish before he goes out to give it back to the guy. When he can't find him, he sticks it on the cash register, hoping the guy will come back so he can give it back. He's even thinking of giving it to Father Mahoney for the poor, so I make it disappear.
It's the intellectual property of Saul Goodman Productions. - I don't think so. This is us. - Our store. And my advertising. So you need my permission to run it.
- I doubt it. This is us. - Our store. And my advertising. So you need my permission to run it. Is that how you play it?
It's your employees who are at risk. Like this. Stay calm. That's part of the presentation. Now, what do you do when there's a fire? You send your men in, put dynamite near a 1000-degree flame, detonate it and cross your fingers that the blast puts out the fire.
Do you like this sentence? Is it too much? No, it's not too much. I like it. Here, take it.
If I was honest, I'd destroy his marriage and try to kidnap his wife. Is that what you call helping? But the fact is, he couldn't kill anyone if he tried, so you don't have to be sorry. There's an explosive capsule in the C4. Would you like me to remove it?
It's been a long time since we've had such a frank conversation. It's good to want to do the right thing. I can see it, even with that black eye. Archie, if you're convinced it's the right thing to do, even if it's difficult, even if it might... If it has a price, you have to do it.
What did you find? My grandmother's ring. She gave it to Jason. He proposed to me with it. How did your mother get it back?
He asked for my hand in marriage. How did your mother get it back? I... I... Hands off, Gollum. If your mother has the ring, it's because Jason gave it to her. Or your father. Jason would have died before parting with it.
Your grandmother's ring. It's not in my jewelry box and Polly doesn't have it either. So where is it? That's not my fault. It's Polly's. She threw herself at me to get it.
Mother, get up. We're going to look at that car. Why? What for? To be seen around and get caught? No, because we have to get rid of it in a better way than leaving it in the woods like the remains of a pie we didn't eat.
This is stupid, Norman. We're fine. I've taken care of it. The car's well hidden where no one goes. No one will find it.
I'm fine. I've taken care of it. The car is well hidden where no one goes. No one will find it. We can't even find it!
I took care of it. The car is well hidden where no one goes. No one will find it. We can't even find it! That's exactly why we need to find it, Mother.
I removed the plates. I erased the VIN number. I wiped everything down for fingerprints. I covered the car with leaves, and I covered my tracks. No one is going to find this car, and even if they do, they can't connect it to us.
I covered the car with leaves, and I covered my tracks. Nobody's going to find that car, and even if they do, they can't trace it back to us. How do you know? It's not rocket science. I think we should move it.
Why don't I ever do anything nice for you? I'm sorry, Mother. You were right about the car. You were right about the car. Let's leave it and go home.
And I had this doctor friend... We were often together. The doctor was crazy about Charu. One day, he asked me to send a letter to Charu. A love letter... And I gave it to him.
There will be fewer of them. They'll have less armor and fewer weapons. But the armies obey my sister out of fear. The Unsullied fight for something greater. They're fighting for freedom, and the person it was given to them.
So? I need you to give him a letter. You just said Tom Larsen's here. Yes, he is. So just give it to him.
No. Don't be afraid. I just want to talk to you. Drop the gun! Drop it!
I'm off to a good start. Glad to see you back on your feet. You know, you can't get rid of a bad girl like that. - There's enough here to make a song. - Let's write it.
I know, I know. It surprised me too. Because I find it incredible. I really believe it. Tell me, what if I record the song and put it on my new album?
Is that my robe? - No, it isn't. - Yes. He says it looks like silver. Just wash it when you're done.
Gideon, are you sure? I mean, this is a sensitive matter with a lot of attention. And we still hadn't finished our conversation when you gave me the badge. Cool. Let's finish it now.
1099. 1309 answer. How are those bikes? Officers. I can't let you do this. You haven't even tested them yet. The party's started and I don't want to miss it.
These are experimental bikes, they were at the lobo 11 hours ago, I told you they're not ready. Brandt? I need you to do something for me. I'm a little busy right now. It's really important. I want you to take your body camera and place it behind you, as low as possible.
Yes! We got it. Not bad for a first case, Detective. This thing is absurd. You're not the one wearing it.
How could that woman cheat on you? I taught you to be a scientist. To question everything. No, you taught me to doubt myself. To get validation from somewhere, so much so that I was willing to take it from the first mentor who offered it to me.
My gods are only concerned with my victory. (Explosion) No. No, destroying this city is not the answer. A city that is destroyed will need a new leader to rebuild it.
- Technical detail. And Ortiz left a bomb in his father's house. - Perhaps to kill Liseth. - The bomb was covered in blood that couldn't have come from the bullet wounds. Why leave a bomb intended to kill his wife, if you're going to add things to it that will prompt us to seize it as evidence?
Inside. Get inside. Watch your head. Ortiz will use anything to make bombs, and he's got a lot of C-4 left over. I promise you, if there's a bomb, the dog will smell it.
- I want to make a deal. She's not well. At least the bitch is with the Beast now and I don't see how that helps her. A binding word. I imagine the other segments enchant the dagger to kill me instantly if I ever break it.
They can't blame us. They've blamed us for a lot less. In the meantime, we have to keep doing our job, which is to maintain order in the colony. That's what I wanted to talk about. Everyone on my block saw the explosion, and I'm sure the resistance will claim it for propaganda purposes.
Fred has seen what the Protomolecule has done to Eros. He wants to control it. It's too dangerous to leave our sample there. It's far too important to destroy now. We have to destroy it.
We just saved your life. We're even. I know we've had our differences. But if you find the protomolecule on Ganymede Station... I'm certainly not going to bring it back.
Really? I'm sorry to hear that. According to her daughter, she'd received a letter from the hospital. Someone was supposed to visit her on Friday, the day she died. - May I see her?
It's exhausting. You know that saying, "Waiting for the inevitable shoe to drop." Yes. It appeared in the late 19th century when people went to the big cities to live on top of each other in these huge apartment buildings, where night after night after night they had this shared experience where tenants heard their neighbors by the thousands, coming home from work, sitting down, taking off a shoe, throwing it on the floor.
Now, how do I get enough melatonin? - Don't forget to install the cameras, so you can keep an eye - on the whole room. - Got it. And the only way you'll be able to hear us is with this earpiece, so put it on when you're in the room.
All those who disappeared were in the same area of the woods. In an area of thirteen square kilometers. Do you have a list of the victims? - Not on me. - Are you going to get it?
Waiting for this thing to come after me, or us, would be more dangerous, and Adalind, I think one of the reasons it's connected to me is because I can see these symbols. Diana sees them too. I know she can. That's why we can't wait. We have to find this thing, and kill it.
We need to find out what's going on in that other place. There might be only one way. How? Go there. We've got to find that thing and kill it.
This is his home. This is it. And where you gave me the key. I brought the key. Here, I'll give it back.
Perhaps a kind of Achilles heel. Specifically for Zerstoerer? No, it's more general, in reference to indestructible demons... Zerstoerer seems to be a dark force in the universe that triggers apocalyptic events. "When the beast seems invincible and death the only fate of those who fight it, only The Force of the Blood of One can overcome the great evil and destroy the destroyer."
Hello, Daddy. - See you soon, Mr. Benjamin. - Thank you, Kitty. I've got Harris's list. Give it back!
- So long, Mr Benjamin. - Thanks, Kitty. I've got Harris's list. Give it back! Give it back!
My kitty brings food back to the table. I'm sick of Covent Garden, sick of Margaret Wells and her hypocritical cackling! Sweet Emily. Why don't you shut up? Our new house, if I can still afford it.
Mrs. Wells keeps me stretched out morning, noon and night and I know I can expect better. I assume Wells owns the dress you're wearing. How much do you owe her? I don't know, five pounds maybe? Out of kindness, I'll pay it.
If I'm not in your league, why isn't she loyal to you? - Be careful, Harvey. - Now, Robert... I'm not looking for a fight with you. But as my associate told you, we don't want handouts. So I'll stop giving it.
Look, Margo's here. Remember Lasaro? The moron who did the Margolem? I twisted his arms and/or balls a bit, and he dropped the formula. Living clay is hard to find, but Fogg left his stash so unprotected, it was like he wanted me to steal it.
- Or I'll just take it. - Back off. - Give me the ball or it'll blow up in your face. Give it to me. Hand it over.
Hernia? No, it doesn't work like that. Yes, it does. Just checking. If we'd let you keep it, I'd have had an unpleasant phone call from you.
- I know what I'd do with it. I'd do nothing with it. You wouldn't have to do anything to it. A dress like that has a story. You look like you're going to tell it.
It had cost him a lot of money. I can give him $2,000 cash. There it is. Is she gonna bang this jacket or what? And sell it for even more.
Happy New Year! Say something. Very well, then. I don't like you manipulating my emotions with this song. I didn't ask to play it.
I'll take a cab to the hotel. If you stop by the pharmacy, pick up some vitamins and Band-Aids. I'm going to fuck your dick off. - Where did that come from? - I don't know where it came from. And the sad thing is, I've had that sentence in my head for six hours and I dared to say it.
The Little Dipper. Did you see that? Is it possible we're seeing the same thing? Try changing the space for me. - Do you see it?
In the meantime, you want to move on, so move on. You've got houses to sell. You ready? Why do you have that chair? I'm wearing it.
Listen to me. If we'd come to take this place back, we'd be outnumbered, and you know it. Where's that machine for the King? We've got a lot of work to do to get the ship ready in time for winter. Sector 4... Crack in the outer wall needs to be filled.
But that, my dear, you already know. That's why you're always here. Hello ! It must be easy to relieve yourself when you're a man. You don't have to stop the car, just take it out the window and water the lawn!
That's a good point. We're a team now, and I always say that a team... I read the poster in the bathroom. I read the poster in the bathroom. The team's trust in the two of us has been eroded, but I'm hoping to regain it... work out problems together within our administrative structure...
The sniper was just the beginning. Sabotaging the Quinjet was Plan B. Communications were down. The crash must have cut the power. I can still try to fix it.
Probably a lot more than she's paying you. If you're going to make me an offer, you'd better hurry. It looks like we have two choices. Either I crush this case into a baseball and nobody gets what they want, or... Or we kill you and take it.
Man is the supreme machine. And I... am a superior man. I'm told you refuse to talk... and that you endure pain. I, too, love pain. And I love to make others feel it using the old ways.
You told me that when I was cured, - you'd buy me the real thing. - Now I remember. I want you to know that the day you left me, I threw that painting in the garbage can. I couldn't look at it anymore.
Radcliffe said it was in the Frame. Yes, but it's a closed prototype. - Simulations are limited. - If Radcliffe built a world, he must have built an independent, more powerful facility. - So how do we find it?
- to slit my wrist. - Do it! - That's a lot of blood. - Did you cut your radial artery? I really tried to miss.
- Yes. But their physical bodies will eventually give out because of this. Aida, it doesn't matter. Reality is only a perception. They perceive it as real, which makes it real.
We rejoin our team and find out where their bodies are being held. We'll meet up at the rendezvous point straight away. That's where I programmed the back door to get out. Reality is only a perception. They perceive it as real, which makes it real.
We're going to change the world. Fitz, this is wrong. This is on the level of a crime against humanity. These are Inhumans. You're a good agent, Skye, but unless I ask for your opinion... don't give it.
Someone is betraying us. You know, my father always said you have to trust... to be betrayed. This mole is a tumor, take care of it. I'll cut it out myself.
The Russian has a base under a drilling platform in the Baltic Sea. Go save them, and leave us in peace. How do we get out? Have you built an exit to the real world? Of course, but Aida must have discovered it by now.
This body will no longer be important. Finish the machine. She's figured out how to create living matter, human tissue. She wants to become a real person. She's building it, but not in this world.
Now, calm down. We're not the enemy here. - Let's just stay calm... - You, shut your robot mouth. Or I'll make these men shut it for you.
And do what she pays you to do. Nance! Will didn't come home last night. I thought you'd both been taken. If I have to look at your evil face I might be inclined to smash it.
I'm on my way. I'll see you soon, then. What about me? What about my soul? We can test it.
What's the minimum? 1 %. You won't miss it. - Is the machine going faster? - Don't rush it.
Wait, the other morning you told me you were running the practice. Well, I am. I haven't told Louis yet, and Donna won't let it go. I think it's a mistake. - What's a mistake? - You didn't come here to date me, you came here because you're in the middle of another crisis and you need me - to help you through it.
But instead of throwing the book at her, the lawyer showed mercy, she reduced the charges to a lesser felony with a suspended sentence and saddled up the reports. It's a touching story, but I don't see what any lawyer has to do with procedures. She's not talking about any lawyer. She's talking about me. I've shown compassion before, but he doesn't deserve it this time.
- Thank you for your time. You're welcome. I'll let you get back to work. All I'm saying is, you're rushing this. And I'm telling you, when you overthrow a dictator, you don't leave his statue in the square. You burn it to the ground.
That's the best news I've heard since I heard - your call to the Bar. - Thank you for that. But you should be doing this without me. Rachel, I... I couldn't have done any of this without you. And that may be true, but it's your story, and you should be the one to tell it.
What's this? Whitford gave me a gun, just in case. Do you know how to use it? A little. I know how to load it.
A little. I know how to load it. We have to be ready. Just in case. Show me how to load it.
- Morgan, you're a beauty. - Yes! Come on! Silas, honey, is this van gonna be parked here all day? Once it's unloaded, I'll tell them to move it, okay?
I'll tell you what. Go stir the pot. You're good at that. We'll alternate between intercostal and diaphragmatic breathing. Take a deep breath... And hold it for ten seconds.
Thank you for your help. I like to eat. We're not so different, you and I. I've been doing a lot of thinking. For example, does a pizza become personal if you cry while eating it?
Seriously, don't you get it? It started when we destroyed the time pigs, the Time Masters, and now history is in danger, and it's up to us to save it.
But... You can give this love letter yourself. This isn't a love letter. It's a military strategy. I wanted my men to receive it in the event of my death.
Auxiliary power supply activated. He's leaving! Lockdown mode initiated. Why are they locking us out? The only way to catch this thing is to trap it in there.
[KARA GROANS] [STILL GROANING] That was good. Is there a special technique for doing that, or just a quick kick in the hindquarters? Because if there's a technique, I want to know it.
I hacked into L-Corp CCTV to get a copy of the video footage of Lena taking the Kryptonite. It looks like someone already hacked into this system a few days ago. I know this code. It's the same code the real Hank Henshaw used the day he broke into L-Corp to take the isotope. Okay, if the video has been corrupted by Henshaw's cyborg signature, then I can reverse that signature decrypt it and separate the video file from the corrupted one.
Dad, are you there? Right here, Alex. We'll wait for your instructions once we're inside. Just be careful. Something happens to the bomb before you disarm it, and the whole town could disappear.
No, I know the spell. We don't need a Sabbath, we just need a powerful little witch. [I've got a car in the back parking lot. If I'm not back by midnight, take it and go.
Pémét pou accessum. Do it now. Your oath. Your promise forever and ever. Forget it.
May I suggest we get started before the evening's over? Shouldn't you be out locating the Hollow's disciples? Yes, I've already started. I was down there talking to all the guests, shaking hands, and while I was doing that, I was imbibing. Now I can take that energy and I can put it in this deck of cards, and it'll help us find the one we're looking for.
- Angie, are you kidding me? - What? What? What? What? It was on your belt! I didn't know I was wearing a belt. I must have worn it when I was high.
Open the door! Open up or I'll shoot! I'm alright. Put the gun down! Put it down!
They like to eat Comanches. I'll fight body and soul. I'll make you proud. You'll look after the horses. When you're able to track a doe and hit it with your bow, then you'll be ready to take on men.
Henry Sharrow has been given all the land a man could dream of. And yet what did he do with his first day of freedom? He went upriver. How could Henry Sharrow have got his hands on the map? Could he have gotten it from a sailor who traveled on the ship that held De La Warr's body?
- Isn't it rather...? - Good day to you. Now that Yeardley's here, Farlow's losing his power, he thinks he has to find her. Really, my dear, come on. You've got to look for her.
Beautiful. I have water. So I see. I have to get the water. Let me carry it for you.
- Normal. - Take my temperature. I already did. It's normal. Then take it again.
- Julius, don't be a bumpkin. - We're out of potatoes. Thank you very much, Julius. Newton's Second Law of Motion. You all know it, but as we go deeper into Newtonian mechanics, I want you to go beyond "knowing".
- We're out of potatoes. Thank you very much. Newton's Second Law of Motion. You all know it, but as we go deeper into Newtonian mechanics, I want you to go beyond "knowing" it. I want you to visualize it.
I don't like the idea of Boyd falling. It doesn't sit well with me. You never deliver your strategy, even if you encourage them to win. I'll park the car for you. Leave it here.
The governor of the central bank told me so. He did? Nigeria's oil industry is weaker than they say. Much weaker. A gust of wind could topple it.
The one I outbid you on last summer? It's parked outside. It's here. The car is a nice gesture. And I'll take it.
- This is a serious booty call. Oh, Boone. Okay, it's a little booty cally. But I had a really good time with you. Grabbing a unicorn in the wild doesn't mean you can bang her whenever you want, man.
You can do it. Our ball went there. Thanks a lot, new guy. Hey, where are you going? I can jump the fence and get it.
Geographically, it's that way. It's not too far from here. But the surface is too big. We can't knock on all those doors. So we have to be able to reduce it.
We'll have to tame you, my boy. While Bailey... Now there's a boy who just needs his honey smile brightened. Your powder should be ready... Pour it down the barrel?
Did you say gold? - He did. - What did he say? He wouldn't talk to me about it. Meredith Rutter sometimes has a stone, and they both sit and just look at it.
My husband knows the box is missing. He'll realize you took it. Verity, you won't even make it to the gallows. He'll skewer you before you can talk. Please, I'll bring her back.
When are you going to stop never opening the bag? I've got a good idea to pass the time. Who doesn't have a clear conscience? It's very simple. I pick a card and read it out loud.
So, we're almost there. Greg, the van broke down. It's okay, Dad. All it has to do is roll along. Let's push it to the top of the hill.
You have to persevere, again and again. She died two months after that. Here, you realize how important it all is. Things like love, family and having incredible friends around you. Life's too short, you have to live it to the full.
But it made me understand why I'm here and why we do what we do. We're helping someone fight. It motivated me and made me work a little harder to reach our goal. Life is fragile. That's why we do crazy things like rowing on the ocean... because we only have one life, and we have to live it to the full.
It's been nine months. Nine months since we rowed out of San Francisco, on the Doris, under the Golden Gate, not knowing what we were getting into. I haven't found serenity yet, but looking back on life at sea, I'll remember the waves, the skies, the stars, not the hardships. I'll remember the positive moments. I'm throwing down the rope, pull it up.
He will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked." I bet your feet are disgusting. You see, this is what it's like with female prisoners. Men understand violence. They respect it.
Piper, honey, is that you? What are you doing out here? My daughter is trapped in a riot. The parents are coming. Don't tell me you're leading her.
He grew up there. Maybe he kept it for its sentimental value. His father beat him daily in this house. He hated living here. Why keep it if he was liquidating everything else?
It doesn't belong to you or your red-blooded king. I can't let you leave with it. You've got no choice. Good technique. I know it well.
Come on, foot. Kick, damn it! Son, I found something that belongs to you. Grandpa's watch! No, I can't take it.
Stop that! I did this when I was trying to get someone to dance with at cottage parties, but it got a little too loud. Crap. There's no way to pick this lock. Maybe we can pick it.
Raisins? Wait a minute. Manure? I bet you love coming here and fucking mortals because back in your god realm, you barely stand out. Watch your words, or I'll cut out your tongue and eat it in front of you.
I want news from the outside. I'm having trouble with this debt I bought in the state. I see. Albany changed the allocation of the gaming license. Are you looking to get it back?
It's a bad situation for you. But, please, don't take it out on Marco's town. You'll get your commission anyway. I don't care about that. Just throw it in the garbage if it makes a difference.
Something big the Quad has never seen. Holy shit. Who set it off? I set it off. The thing we're fighting is organic. And we're never going to beat it until we understand that it's organic, so...
I thought I'd follow you anywhere. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Too honest. Welcome to team awesome Force. Oddity. Yoki helped me find it.
Costs are always personal. Two, we've just received a coded transmission. Is it my ship? No. Direct it to the mess hall.
Android, Five, how's it going down there? We've modified the Blink Drive in an attempt to erase the damage caused by Ishida's scientists. How will we know? First, by running a diagnostic, followed by a series of simulations. If instability persists, we should be able to detect it, well before a real test.
Damn. This is more than a walk in the park. I'm not to blame. She said the place was abandoned, not destroyed. Obviously, when Novina had to leave the station, they decided to scuttle it.
So instead of recharging this digital consciousness in his dying body, you transferred it to the ship's data? Not at first. I didn't know how. I kept it on a storage device. And it was only recently that I was able to find a way to finally load it into the computer.
And I think his death pains you as much as it pains us. So you understand why I act, why I can't back down. I didn't kill Nyx, but I let it happen, and that's enough. Before all this started, you asked for help. I'm ready to give it.
Why are you doing this? To make you suffer. You exploit everything you touch. You owe us. You'll have to pay.
You were right about that thing on Ganymede, ma'am. It's a weapons test. Me and my crew and your marines too, we were trapped in the middle. That test almost started a system-wide war. The weapon is ready to sell and Mars wants it.
- It's a goddamn trap. You're so predictable. So are you. You've already made up your mind, haven't you? Then change it.
I am Gunnery Sergeant Roberta Draper, Mars Marine Corps. I request political asylum on Earth. You were right about that thing on Ganymede. It was a weapons test. This weapon is for sale and Mars wants it.
It's a tough job, a tough life. You have to do it for love. If you do it for the wrong reasons, it shortens your life expectancy, I think. I don't know many people who are prepared to get up at 2 a.m. to come to work, to slave away for 10 or 12 hours before going home. Someone has to light the fire, take out the meat, season it, cut it, put it on the grill and cook it properly, and that takes long hours and a lot of talent.
Previously... I choose to take this disaster as a sign, and while they rebuild this place, I'm going to surprise Randy and try to rebuild us! Fine, use my car, but I'm driving it.
Apparently a bit of her breasts. This sconce. I noticed that if I put all my strength against it, it moved a little. See? I must have jammed it while I was testing his manhood.
It tastes like it. Fear in the throat. Most people stay away from fear, manage to get it out of their lives. Me? I cultivate it.
Fear in the throat. Most people shy away from fear, trying to get it out of their lives. Me? I cultivate it. I try to recognize it, control it and use it.
I'll think about it. Wait a minute, wait a minute. That's all there is to it. This cow is dead, hanging upside down. All we have to do is cut it up and eat it.
An in-house process called Flash-Pas. I have a piece of the company, and I represent its president... for life. He's had enough. He wants out. I can take it over.
You've changed your story. I suggest a new chapter to your story, in which you are the co-conspirator rather than the accused. What story? Sandicot's story. I tell it to you, and in return you tell me if it's true, which it is.
If you do, Deb will book the plane. It's not just that. I never thought I'd live this life. You already are.
- It's the doctor. Neil sent me. Point that gun away from me or I'll leave right now. How about it? I'm keeping it until I know it's safe.
But tracer powder has been around for years. You can't go through the whole district - under the black light. - No need for that. You won't see this powder with black light. You'll see it with this.
Abby, are you there? I'm home. There may be a solution. - That's just great. - But to find it, I have to do something I never thought I'd do.
Maybe you just need to accept the fact that things are different now. Marcy, I didn't call you in to get a fair assessment of this situation. You're right, my bad. OK, maybe I can get some information back from Don, but in the meantime, you need to kick it up a notch. It's like with dogs, you can't just put food out and hope he finds it.
Baylis is making the Nightblood all by himself. It's really our only hope. Are we really still talking about this? The black rain is already here. 18 people died yesterday in Arkadia, so if the Nightblood can help us counter it, I for one want to know.
An access card to the building from which the shot was fired. It's an assassination plot against the President, the death penalty. I want to believe you have a valid explanation, but if you don't give it to me, I can't help you. I'm throwing you a lifeline. Take it.
There must be a weak link. One of them must have personal problems, drugs or alcohol. - What do you have in mind? - We find him and break him down. Discreetly. MacLeish can't suspect a thing. We must rattle his cage, not destroy it.
But then I thought about the FBI. I had to go see the director in person, and I sped off to Alexandria. I was almost there. But I lost control of my car. Yes. They'd managed to hack it.
But some of us are worried about the Texas election. I won Texas by 60 points last time. My endorsement still carries weight there. Will you promise me your endorsement? Show me you deserve it.
I met students from a music program in New Orleans subsidized by the National Endowment for the Arts. Unfortunately, their grant is about to expire. We're going to have to look at arts education since the budget is coming to an end. It can't wait that long. The grant expires next month, unless Congress reapproves it.
I'll explain what it's all about. The procedure is complex, but I've done it many times. We slow down your heart function and repair the malformation... - Great car! - Thanks for your time. - Want to sell it?
We turn it back on. Nobody has anything to... say? Ron? Is it that bad? I have to say, when Olivia disappeared and Kevin decided to finance this play himself and perform it with the author, I thought:
Maybe it wouldn't be silly to remake another incredible being. Yuck! Let's get some chips. Imagine you're a tree with roots that go deeper. If a distraction appears, recognize it and plunge back into quietude.
Neither here nor there. I've turned my life upside down for this piece. It's the only reason I'm here, sir. And the craziest thing about it all is that it's really good... It is. But nobody's going to come and see it unless you tell them to come, so I'm begging you, please... give us another chance.
And then... How's it going? Philly's gone. And I decided, what was the point? When a plate breaks, you can't fix it.
I'll be there in a moment. Thanks for your time. So he's gone. And the time machine? Wells was able to bring it back.
I know. I know you do. I know now. I don't... Exactly. This... could isolate the entity, paralyze it, we can talk to David alone.
Cancer. She tried everything. Chemo, radiation, surgery. You know what they do with a tumor when they take it out? They put it in a bag and burn it.
Initiate fragmentation. Follow me, Mrs. Markridge. This is our secure warehouse. Items leave this area only for appraisal and at the time of sale. At that point, a guard transports the piece from the secure area to the sales floor, where an employee receives it.
When was the last time you slept? Not sure. What time is it now? My watch is gone. Can you see it?
My watch is gone. Can you see it? It's got to be here somewhere. This is the last place. We've got to find it.
The lights would shake... we'd have that rancid feeling. Mrs. Markridge? I'm sorry, but you've bought a lot more than we thought. You've exceeded your credit limit. Well, raise it.
I'm not giving up. Thanks for understanding. Where's Monty? Unloading the rover. We'll leave it with you, by the way.
- Okay, come on. You have to put on this suit. That was for Jasper. At least now he'll be doing something right. You should put it on.
We have 90 minutes left to do 6 hours of preparation, extract the oxygen generator from the house, turn a cockpit designed for two into one for eight, and load enough food to keep us from starving in space while we wait for the algae harvests. You said it would be hard. This isn't the hard part. Becca's rocket is scheduled to dock on Polaris, not the Ark. I'll have to pilot it in the ring hangar.
You really should try Ginny's Cheeseburger Chowder. The ground meat and spices, the melted cheese. I highly recommend it for inaugural balls. If you think you can get your immunity deal by blackmailing the president-elect for taking illegal action on Alexander Kirk's campaign contributions, you're not as smart as everyone says you are. Marlin, your boss made me a campaign promise, and I intend to make sure he keeps it.
And all of a sudden, you've had eleven! You're drunk and you think... But you're responsible. Drunk but responsible. "Shit. I drove here. Shit, I'm taking her home."
He's evil incarnate. No teenage boy band years... Try to find a photo of Adolf as a baby. You look at it and say: "Drown that creature! Go to the river and wedge it under a rock.
I'm Dr... Not Dr. Grey. She's not dr. Grey. Where's dr. Grey? Dr. Grey's not available for your surgery, Lynne, so, uh, Dr. Kepner's gonna do it with Dr. Pierce.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You're back! - In fact, I'm... - I'm so excited! Dr. Minnick's method is great, but I really wish I could have done it with you.
I was there, so... No, no, no. Nice work, Warren. Can you see the source of the bleeding? Yeah, yeah, I see it.
We don't want it to spread any further than it already has. Of course not, but it's a big surgery, so... I can handle it. I'm fine. I'm fine. I want the next surgery as soon as you can do it.
As soon as we remove this mass blocking the bile ducts, her bile enzymes will drop, and she will be. Meredith doesn't think surgery is wise. Meredith is no longer on this case. Now that I know this trial exists, there are even more reasons to do the surgery. I'd like one of you to do it.
This varnish smells bad. Would you like me to open a window? That'd be nice. It's stopped raining. I won't leave it open too long, or you'll catch cold.
An urgent matter has come up, and I've come to say good-bye before hitting the road. And you haven't checked in for weeks. Is Paige home? She's dropping your grandson off at school. I'm sure she's upset that I disappeared, but you know, when opportunity knocks you have to grab it and run with it.
It's faint, but I recognize the sound. I'm not even going to ask why. There's a chance all that dust could foul the press. If it stops, it'll alert the guards if it goes off. We have to keep it running.
We found a crack and quickly repaired it with calcium hydroxide mortar. The water pressure has risen, but not back to normal. So there's another leak. Yes. But we can't find it.
Let's get you seated. The ambulance is on its way. Not cool for the environment. The chemicals are in there. Given the permeability of this type of stone, we have 30 minutes before they reach the aquifer and contaminate it.
No way, Thelma and Loser. We'll print them here. I've got the solution. I hope it still works. I take it apart and put it back together every two hours.
Father said HE destroyed it. Apparently, he just hid it in plain sight. But it's so small and so... not flaming. That's because you're the only one, my light-bearer, who can ignite it. What am I supposed to do, dip it in Whisky and strike a match?
- Try harder! That's enough! That's enough! I'm not broken. The sword must be. Then we'll fix it.
That went well. - You think so? - Yes. He's got what we need in his trunk in the back. He'll get it.
I'll miss you, Daniel. You're my favorite human. Can you find Mom? She's on the pier in Santa Monica, and she wants the coin. We have to give it to her.
We could call her if she could only hear us. Maybe she can. But how? Police radios operate on an RF frequency just like Maggie's hearing aid, which can cause interference. All right, go to 154.400 and turn it around.
Okay, go to 154.400 and turn it. Turn it all the way. What's wrong with you? Get up! Turn it down.
- Oh, me! - I beg your pardon? - That's exactly what I need. It's perfect. I want it.
2 of Lorazapam! And prepare a dose of Keppra! Ok! Okay. You've got some bleeding in your spleen, due to a laceration. We'd like to try splenic embolization, to repair it and avoid surgery.
No hints of new plans I told you, just fix my spleen and then let me go, that's all. Holly, this could give you your life back. Yeah, but it's my life. I don't need it back.
Especially when you have someone like Dr. Pierce telling you she can save you, offering you the impossible. Don't ignore that. The scary stuff isn't dying. The scary stuff is surviving and accepting that you really do have a life to live. Don't you want to hang on and live it?
But you won't see her again. Corey, keep the time you spent together close to your heart. But don't let it hold you back. Don't sit and wait any longer. Take your new life by the hand and go live it.
We're the only thing standing between these monsters and our homes. If we flee, they'll kill everyone. How can we win? This sword... it's called Hrunting. It has been enchanted with white magic so that whoever wears it will be hailed as a hero.
- What is it? There's a creature called a Grendel. It's robbed our village, taken our families and friends into the darkness. I'm afraid my career as a monster killer is over. I made a promise to my son, and I intend to keep it.
The lake is not deep. You can wade in. What's this? Did you bring the dagger? I couldn't leave it.
I still don't know exactly where Ichabod Crane took my gun. Do you want to tell me where he took my... We trust you. Now trust us. What do you know about this weapon and how to destroy it?
I know better than anyone what he wants to accomplish. I'm so sorry. No, no, don't! Dreyfuss wants to undo the country, the world. He wants to destroy democracy and replace it with tyranny.
♪ When we're together ♪ ♪ Dancing cheek to cheek. ♪ Welcome to my humble abode, Witnesses. It took 10,000 unfortunate souls an eternity to make it by hand.
It occurred to me, on this day of ascension, that maybe we really should take a moment to live in the present moment. Do you agree? Take this moment to stop... and... accept the loss, okay? Yes. And we must... nurture and cradle it as we would our own child.
Seriously, you still don't get it? It all began with the destruction of the Time Chickens, the Masters of Time. Now, history is in danger and it's up to us to save it.
Maybe he already has. Now that the Legends have the whole Spear, there's no need to hunt for pieces. I'm a glass-half-full kind of guy... The legendary idiots won't use it. They'll try to hide it or destroy it, and when they do, we'll be waiting for them.
I know that our divisions go back a long way, that they may seem insurmountable. But I implore you, at this moment, to be allies and to respect a ceasefire so that the wounded can be removed from the battlefield. A day may come when men's courage fails, when we abandon our friends and break all ties, but that day has not yet arrived. Perhaps if we show humanity... We can save her.
Frankly, I'd forgotten she even had them. - And the mark on her arm? - She didn't have it when she left. I've already told the police. Whoever murdered her must have put it there.
We're having a hard time finding this Dr Rosa. You don't remember his name, or where the appointment took place? I'm trying to remember. When my officers pursued you, you were heading for the border. In my opinion, you were planning to cross it, isn't that right?
No, it's the beast. It's surrounding us and looking for a way in. It's getting stronger again. Strong enough to feed. Every hour of sunlight that feeds it makes the world darker and the beast stronger.
If you come, I can't promise you won't die. But I can promise you this. You won't all die in a hole. We've got to get her back through and close the gate behind her. The gate won't open until dawn hits it.
You won't all die in a hole. We have to get her back through and close the gate behind her. The gate won't open until dawn hits it. Why can't it? Our ancestors couldn't close the gate completely, but they built the tumulus to control it.
I know it is. It's time to grow up, Kar. To fight you. How does it work? It poisons the light when the beast eats it.
If it helps, I have a plan. It feeds on light but heads for sound. - What are we going to do? - Simple. A little noise, the beast approaches, we lead it to the door.
It feeds on light, but heads for sound. - What are we going to do about it? - Simple. A little noise, the beast approaches, we lead it to the door. But how are we going to hold it back?
He's jihadist scum who deserves to die. Maybe he does. But now it's my only chance to find Syd. Your kneecap is dislocated. I'll fix it or you won't be able to walk.
Look, I'm sorry for the damage I caused, but it wasn't me. I had a video audition this morning. European Orchestra Opera. It has 12 chairs, and we've been open a week. It's the only opportunity in my life, and I can't miss it.
- No, it's on me. Absolutely not. I insist on it. We already have a tab. I'll put it on the expense account.
Okay, wait here. Well, look, the focus is automatic, so all you have to do is frame and shoot. Then, making copies is simple. Put the original video in one machine, press play. Then take a blank tape and put it in the other machine and press record.
Sam? No, I'm fine, thanks. I'll have a pint, enema. Good for you. Look for it yourself.
Does she know I'm upstairs? No, but she won't leave without seeing you. - Is my briefcase downstairs? - It's downstairs. Well, put it in my car and I'll go out the back.
- How's that? - I'll tell you what. I'll be alone all my life, okay? Have you finished? We can show you something, a technique that will help you control your emotions. Control yourself. If you can learn this thing and master it perfectly, you can continue to see him, if that's what you want.
They will face the world's toughest obstacle course, physically and psychologically... the ultimate battle of man against The Beast. Twelve will take part, but only one will win. Introducing Ultimate Beastmaster. I don't know where that thing came from or how it got there. I want to see someone conquer it!
Anyway, how's it going? You must be... - dead bored. - Yes. My agreement forbids me any access to a computer or the Internet. A hypothetical question, to exercise your brain. For example, if I were to hack into the Hooli servers, tamper with an app and dump it on the Wi-Fi at a trade show, how would I go about it?
So if we find the right fountain? We can walk right up to it. I've heard a few archivists talking about it. The fountain in the poison room has a pile of books as its statue. If we split up, we can probably find it in a few weeks.
Our goal... is to spy on the NSA. All the e-mails and calls you've made to the Farm have probably been intercepted and recorded by an NSA listening post. Send an e-mail that could compromise you later, or make a phone call that could tip off a foreign power. We give you the gift of a clean slate, but you have to clean it yourself.
Yeah. When the time comes, this one will be quick to pull the plug. I can't believe Marcy got you a dirt bike. And that she can bring it here when I have to leave my beer in the driveway. This was the perfect place to hide it because I know Don wouldn't dare come into this room.
You want to be permanently transferred to NOLA? Is this some kind of joke? No, sir, I'm not. There's an agent position available. I'd like to take it.
They're making a mistake. These are the guys who can sell this stuff. Not these guys. But they've already decided on the ad's direction. So tell them to change it!
We're executing him. No. But the fact that you want to means a lot to me. We put the note back in the dirty dishes. We let him find it and take it to the Fu Fighter base.
It'll come for you and Colt, and it'll be just as unique. It was easier when I thought they wouldn't keep it. Am I horrible? You're a wonderful girl going through a difficult time. But you're not going through it alone.
Crap. It's... my St. John's medal. It's silly, but when I was playing soccer, I had four knee operations. I wore it every time, and everything went fine. You should have worn it when you played.
It's... my St. Moritz medal. It's silly, but when I was playing soccer, I had my knee operated on four times. I wore it every time, and everything went well. You should have worn it when you played. I should have worn it when we fucked.
Patsy Cline was on the radio, and I thought of you. It seems like you've been gone forever, not a few days. I let my mustache grow. Not sure it suits me. I'll probably shave it off in a week.
We just need to check his room. Evan Finley, Chicago P.D. You in there? Open up! Open up! Open it up.
It's not enough. Keep thinking. Wait wait wait. The bracelet the guy was selling posted an image to prove it was real. I could download it for you.
- Is that you? - I'm Guthred. I saw the Danes in the guise of a ghost rider, and freed Guthred. Swearing an oath over the remains of a saint, he was crowned king. Raise an army, I'll command it.
- It better be good. - Make an offer. In exchange for peace, to compensate for the loss of Eoferwic, I offer you a fortress. - At Dunholm. - It's Kjartan's. We'll take it back together.
Holy cow! - It doesn't look good. - What's wrong? This guy's got a toothbrush up his bum. I gotta get it out.
Can you go and see if I can give it up? I need to sit down and think about the biggest illusion of all: me. Did you invent that phrase? No, my wife shouted it at me during an argument years ago. She says it a lot these days.
So I don't want to present the show anymore. But I have an idea. You turned down my idea for a traveling show because I'm new. And I understand, you're right. But... what if we did it together?
Try to understand. Try to listen. What don't I understand? Explain it to me. You want me to explain that it's not easy to put your life in a box and throw it away?
It would be a shame if it all came to an end here. They're holding my brother. And they're going to kill him if I don't pay them back. Let me help you, okay? But first put the gun down before I take it and use it on you.
It's supposed to get your heart rate up and relax you at the same time. - Oh, my goodness. - Yes. Should I lock the door? You should leave it open just in case I need to be resuscitated.
OK. So what happened? There's not much left to say. I felt that my mother saw me as a child because I never had a rebellious period, so I had my ear pierced. My mother made me take it out.
"But it was the Father who had sent this messenger, the serpent, to tempt his children and lead them astray." It's been a while since I've been to church, but it doesn't ring a bell. That's because it doesn't exist. There is no Genesis 3:25, but this morning one of my systems looked up the phrase "Genesis 3:25" and found something. I was able to trace it to a man named Jared Wisnewski.
Mr. Mason has invented a time machine. There's room for three passengers. Rittenhouse knows you falsified the registration. - I didn't. - Whatever the next mission, record it correctly.
Can you check these handcuffs and make sure they're tight behind my back? Yes, they're tight. Ladies and gentlemen, as this lovely lady has just confirmed, my hands are securely fastened behind my back. I'm going to reach into this trunk. My brother Dash will close it.
Their power targets the part of the brain linked to memory and perception? Is that it? You're getting warm. Fingers tingling. But what are they targeting it with?
The Monks are not our friends. They invaded Earth and enslaved its inhabitants. They keep themselves in power thanks to a powerful transmitter spreading myths and lies suggesting they've always been there. In fact, they've only been around for a few months, falsifying and manipulating our history. Our mission is to interrupt their broadcast and replace it with the True History of the Earth, which will weaken and discredit the power of the Monks.
They have invaded Earth and enslaved its inhabitants. They keep themselves in power thanks to a powerful transmitter spreading myths and lies suggesting they've always been there. Take cover! They've only been around for a few months, falsifying and manipulating our history. Our mission is to interrupt their broadcast and replace it with the true history of the Earth, which will weaken and discredit the power of the Monks.
Send it to every corner. Bill. Mom! She fills his mind with a pure, incorruptible, irresistible image. And he spreads it all over the world without being able to do anything else.
There are no drugs in the car; what's in the car? We don't know yet. I've just received the video from the onboard camera. It's quite damaged, but the technicians were able to save it.
The Russians and Chinese are reporting the same thing. Signaling what? What's dormant? The pyramid. We're keeping an eye on it.
We shape the future. Each thread is a chain of days leading to your end. We can detect when a catastrophe is coming. And? Prevent it.
Of course I'll do it. Because they're always offering their deal and... and I'm the last one. Tell them you're flattered, but no thanks. What does this consent mean? You have to ask for our help and want it, and know that then you belong to us.
Bill, get out of that pyramid! I can't open it. The emergency protocol is activated. You must use the combination. Set it to 3614.
The emergency protocol is activated. You must use the combination. Set it to 3614. You'll have to guide me. I can't see it from here...
Late night. Have a seat. I had a late night two days ago, Freezing my ass off on the docks, Looking for a Russian contraband crate full of... You don't need to know this, except that it had to do with my investigation of Russian hackers. We've got our eyes on that crate When two idiots arrived to retrieve it.
I executed him. Do you expect your life to be spared now? No, no, no! I expect it to be taken from me. And I give it willingly.
Very. I just don't get it. It's quite simple. The Cybermen have removed fear from their hearts and minds. But you, Alit, you're going to put it back.
Paint the house. Paint the house. Yes... Although our house was already almost painted. We wanted our best friends to finish it.
That, and all the darkness you've already faced, has emerged from a twisted soul... the Black Fairy. And if we don't try to stop her, she'll bring back far worse things. How's it going, Mom? It's going... slowly. Casting a sleeping curse is one thing, but breaking it?
call me crazy, but it doesn't exactly inspire confidence. So I need a sign of good faith. And why is that? It's not as if I can defeat you, even with this sword. Then give it to me.
These trances... they're going to get more frequent, more intense. He might even end up in a cell next to me. What can I do to help? You can start by giving me what I want. - We've got to get behind this thing and send it back to Hell.
It's the only option. The spider... you brought it here. You knew you couldn't kill me yourself. Unfortunately, you were much stronger than I expected. And once you'd created it, controlling it was another story.
- Back to the cell. - Ok. Hold it. Okay, fine. I'll take it.
That's more than we had an hour ago. Can you print pictures of the car? Of course I can. Show them to the guard who works on the site. I'll talk to Linden, see if he recognizes it.
You're beautiful, baby. It's in your blood. Not like the other boys. I had to teach them everything, everything. Can you feel the adrenaline? Can you feel it?
That's where we found this one. Alone, wandering. Out there. We figured you had tranquilizers. We need something to soothe this beast without killing it.
When I said you should go home, I wasn't asking. You need your sleep. Yes, I understand. The waitress saw them looking at a map. She was able to reproduce it.
Don't you ever give up? I won't. - Meet me in the newsroom. Room 2b. We share it with the phone book.
I encourage you to think for yourself, just as you encourage your class to think for themselves. Being young is not a defect. It's a quality. Children, that's her theory. Let's see how she defends it.
Am I supposed to answer that? I think you just did. Children's passion drives us to improve ourselves. It breathes life into society. Instead of opposing it, we should welcome it, encourage it, follow it.
That's when you disappeared. Bishop and I came here looking for you and... I don't know what happened. It was an accident. I broke the plate in half. But it's fixed now. You could have put it back discreetly.
All right, then. Let's talk. Where do we start? The truth. What if I'm more sure I know it?
Kolivan tells me you've lasted longer than all the others. - You don't need to go on. - What are you talking about? Give them the gun and let's get out of here. I can't give it to them, Shiro.
Oh no! Yeah. It's done! Do you have scaultrite? I'm picking it up.
Bigger. - Haggar. - What is it? What's wrong? We've found more evidence of a spy. This encrypted chip was in the quantum entanglement chain. Put the chip back and wait to see who comes to retrieve it.
We'd like to see the deceased's hotel room. Unfortunately, this is not possible. Because we didn't report it as a crime, so we removed the deceased's belongings and made the room available to the hotel. Who rented it out to a new guest. We're very busy, and the Chico Reservado area is very popular with tourists, but I can show it to you if you like.
Clear! Jack Garrett, FBI! What do we got, Jack? He's drugged with scopolamine. It's like being under hypnosis, and whoever gives it to you takes over your actions.
If you help me, I can help you in return. Help me? Who cares about prostitutes in Bogotá? What I care about, Canela, is the truth. If you tell me, I can help you.
We seem to be dealing with a malicious hacker. And he has wireless access to a 2013 Meridian. The Meridian is a popular model. Its victim list is huge. We're working hard to narrow it down.
The new offer is 5 to 10 years. Oh, my goodness. It's time-limited. You have until the indictment to accept it. If you decline, there will be no further offers.
Do you remember more about how you cut yourself? I'm trying, but I can't remember. And I'm turning down the offer. I know what's at stake. I'm turning it down.
Let's hear it. We have money... A lot of money. And we want to spend it in ways that will make our lives easier, including lining the right pockets in Caracas. I was just waiting to hear your intentions. Even if I had this information, I wouldn't share it with two men who represent a company that doesn't exist.
He left the country and never came back. But you haven't spoken to him since? No. But every Christmas, I leave a message on his old work number, begging him to come back and give himself up. And the mailbox is never full, so I know he keeps checking it.
Just a moment. I'd... I'd find that completely inappropriate. It wouldn't be like me at all to show people how I brush my teeth. To show reality is to kill it.
Our beginnings coincided with the rise of the environmental movement. We came up with the idea of hedonistic sustainability. What if sustainability could improve our quality of life? This site is beautiful, but it was very polluted. The hulls of the boats were painted here. A large part of the budget was spent digging up the earth and then moving it.
Judges need to be educated, the public needs to be educated, the Justice Department needs to be educated about exactly what's going on. The idea that Backpage only caters to old people's fetishes, it doesn't speak to minors, I don't think they're going to be able to say that in court without batting an eye. The witness stand is a lonely place. We'll bring them into court and they can tell this story under cross-examination. Let's see if they can maintain it.
- Coexist. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, Emily. I'm trusting you. If you really think I should do this ad, I will.
I want the recipe. - Why do you want it? - For... tradition. Everything gets lost. Like drunk driving. I want it back.
I wouldn't know. In every corner of the world, women are imposing. That was Fitzgibbons Munrunney. You can't run a cult like a man. Run it like a female bonobo, orca or elephant.
- Where does the information come from? - It's all in there. If we know it's going to happen, why don't we stop it before it does? Francis kept your letter of resignation. He wants to tear it up.
- Maybe he didn't. What about the gun? That's the problem. We haven't found it. It could have been stolen by a guest or a hotel employee.
Where's my gun? Here. What are my guarantees? I gave you your gun back. Why did you give it to him?
You... Really? Jokes are often better when you end them with "Wocka wocka" or "ha-cha-cha". Good news. The TV I want will fit in the playroom, and if I leave the curtains open, I can watch it from work.
I thought we were going to do it in order. We got mad at each other, and you got caught in the middle. And... sorry about the suitcase. You should be. Your socks were still in it. I had to throw it out.
Leave immediately. - Good heavens. - I mean it! Okay, I'll go. But Benjamin, I'm going to make you this soup... in my heart. And I'm going to eat it in mine.
Phil Knight spoke. "Thank you for coming. We've waited a long time, but we hope it's worth it. Back to you, Tinker." Me, I need to see the shoe. He described it to me, drew pictures, showed me photos... But I had to be able to hold it in my hands.
Over the last 20 years, I've learned that objects are often used to fill a void. The need to fill this void with art is fundamental. AN ORIGINAL NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES My canvases are often devoid of light. You have to do without light to find it.
Something about this model really attracts me, and I run through all these streets in my head. But another part of me would like to know what would happen if I destroyed the model. Or if I added a very subversive element or threw paint on it. My work represents a reaction against that, while perpetuating the influence that was exerted on me. You can understand a city and its history by looking down on it.
She's the one who talked to me about democracy in the theater. If there are 20 actors on stage, you can't control what the audience watches. Theater demands democracy. Whether you're at the top or the bottom, you have to have the same experience. The tower in Wagner's Parsifal. It rotates throughout the play. We see it from every angle.
If your murder case hinges on that video, good luck. Thanks for the chat, boss. The video in question was recorded by an active-duty sailor. It belongs to the Navy. Neither Mr. Stone nor his co-counsel have the authority to view this video, much less possess it.
The video in question was recorded by an active-duty sailor. It belongs to the Navy. Neither Mr. Stone nor his co-counsel have the authority to view this video, much less possess it. We can't put the rain back in the sky. We had no idea of its contents before watching it.
Scientology is... is a closet with... you know, but it's locked from the outside. Mm-hmm. And, uh, once you're in, it's very difficult to get out. And also, it's difficult for outsiders like journalists and experts, scholars to actually penetrate it to understand it because Scientologists have been prepared, trained to tell their story in a very particular way to outsiders, and trying to get underneath that veil of secrecy is a real challenge.
After your purchase, take the key. You're welcome. Compadre, I need to defecate. Here you go. Throw the key out the window and I'll go have it remade.
"I guess I'm not in it." And she, "You're not in it, but he wants to change that. Go talk to him about it." So I went to talk to him about it, and he said, "Remember you told me to take my money and shove it up my ass?"
Symptoms appear almost immediately after exposure, followed by death within minutes. Which is, ironically, the only good thing about the disease. - Is it? - It doesn't spread. The victim is incapable of transmitting it.
Honestly, it was great. I've been thinking about what you said, about why I needed it. The truth is, I still don't know. But what I do know is that this family is the most important thing to me. I don't want to lose it.
No. Do you have somewhere to be? I just don't have to wait for this. That's your prerogative. You know, maybe I'll share it with your son.
- you drive a Prius. - I have a bike. Everybody should. We only have one planet. Does the city's Department of Transportation destroy it?
- I have a bike. Everybody should. We only have one planet. City Department of Transportation, are they destroying it? They're not saving it.
He's no Thomas Edison. He used a $10 app... Pretty good... Jamming, to lower the pitch of his voice. You can turn it to normal.
It's the same person's voice on both tapes. Did you know that Mr. Reynolds met Mrs. Reynolds at university 15 years ago? Do you think someone who has known the defendant for so long wouldn't have recognized his voice? He used an app that lowers his voice by two octaves. I was able to raise it two octaves and restore it.
And I apologize in advance. Drop it, please. And would you do me the courtesy of letting it slide? Charming. Unwind it.
What have you got? I have a lot of countermeasures. I've got a lot of built-in safeties. I've got a lot of decoys wired in. I think only Abati could defuse that bomb. Now, I could try to disarm it but if I make a mistake, I'm not just going to kill us, I'm going to kill half the population of this island.
We've got it, Steve. But Abati's dead. Have you seen anything like it? No. And while there are ways to defuse it,
The problem is, if you try to... Yes, you have to get the uranium out of the cartridge to get to the screws that hold the cartridge in place. Your guy was smart. To unscrew the cartridge, you first have to remove the uranium bars. Once the cartridge is disconnected, you can put them back in and close it again.
That's why Sly sends the photos we send him to CADD-- Computer Aided Design and Drafting software. With the house plan, we'll be able to make a 3-D model of the room and the debris on it. We'll need to enter the weight and approximate size of the pieces of debris, as well as the tensile strength of the power lines. Once we have the numbers, we can decide which piece of debris to remove first. Hopefully, this will relieve the pressure on the bubble without bursting it.
Yes, it's always calculating. Got any better advice? It's incredibly dangerous here. O'Brien, to your left, a 3kg ficus branch. Slide it up at 30 degrees, turn and pull down.
Get into the car. Uno momento. Can I speak to Ada for a moment? - Ada? I'm doing some preliminary brainstorming and I think I can create an algorithm to compress the world's genetic data so that, even if there's only one bone marrow somewhere for you, I'll find it.
You're practically on top of the thing. What's wrong with your hand? A caterpillar bit me, and now it's rashy. It's in a cup in my greenhouse. Do you think you can pick it up so we can check the bio-proteins in its saliva?
Why would Thawne use the Spear to shrink you? He didn't. I think he used Dr. Palmer's armor. He must still have it in his lab. We need to get it back to re-expand the ship.
But you won't like it. What next, Ken? I don't know, Ken. I've never seen my armor here. But only here could Thawne have hidden it.
I think I can help you. What do you mean, you can help me? The Black Fairy used my magic to blacken the crystals, so my magic is still attached to them. How does that help us? Because it also means we can destroy it... with this.
Why did you come back to Pittsburgh? We're making a little stop on the way to see the World's Largest Chocolate Bar. It's as big as a table. A small table. Or a big book, but we still want to see it.
No, because Spencer Reid is incapable of killing an innocent woman in cold blood. You have no idea what I'm capable of. Prison's a tough place. You've probably had to do things to survive that you'd never think of doing in the outside world, things that make you feel guilty or ashamed. But the brain has to deal with that guilt, it has to process it.
That's the problem. Did the camera break again? It broke two hours ago. The technicians have just given up - any idea of getting it working again.
You've worked for the Children's Defense Fund. You wrote for "The Daily Show." I mean, you may have graduated from Quantico, but you quit three months later to write speeches for Eric Garcetti. That kind of thing isn't for you. You want to shape the law, not break it.
I get my best ideas in cabs and traffic jams. I let my unconscious take over. It makes it easier to associate ideas. You have to want to play to create. Otherwise, you don't get anywhere. You have to start with this bar. You can lower it a little. And it's nicer if the word "pier" is at the end.
A limited edition cherry red 1966 Mustang convertible. Like the one you have on your screensaver? Yes, except now it's in McNeile's driveway. I think he bought that car to drive me crazy. I go and see it every day.
Like the one you have on your screensaver? Yes, except now it's in McNeile's driveway. I think he bought that car to drive me crazy. I'm going to see it every day. Or you can see it every day, Rog.
So, before you say no... Here's the offer. There's nothing written on it. Because the offer is all you want. Name it.
Some of this heat is radiated back into space as thermal energy. You probably know that CO2 is referred to as a greenhouse gas. It's not a perfect nickname, but that's where the expression comes from. When I point this infrared camera at my hand, my hand radiates infrared. But watch what happens when I dip it into this aquarium.
It took a lot less time than I thought it would. Good. And now putting on the principal's jacket. Principal's jacket. I remember when you bought this ten years ago and promised you'd never wear it until you were actually principal.
Did you send Nimah to prison? I didn't want to, but we deduced it was safer for me that way. I don't really care. I don't want anything to do with it. I barely got this assignment, and I'm not going to lose it because you broke the rules.
Please follow me. Sorry about the mess. We're in the middle of inventory. Is the auction room yours? No, I just run it.
That's a lot of people. Sometimes Howard puts on a striped shirt and we play "Where's Wolowitz?" And now we're camping outside for the Avengers panel. Do you really sleep on the sidewalk? It gets cold sometimes, but Raj found out that if you urinate in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it keeps you warm.
- Well done, gorgeous! She heads for Spinal Descent. She loves it! Oh no, her shoe got stuck! Grab it!
- He's doing it! He's caught the top! The Korean, Kim Yunhwan! Here's his little brother looking on as Yunhwan now has to do the Faceplant jump. This rope can hurt your head if you don't hold on tight.
It was designed to be the world's toughest obstacle course. As tall as an eight-storey building, it measures 195 m in length. Fifty tons of steel were required for its construction. The end result was so impressive that the monstrosity was given the name... The Beast. Athletes from all over the world tried to conquer it.
Why did you film it? For Kashgar to see. According to the log, he just did. Mason put a Trojan horse in the video. Watching it, Kashgar gives us his IP address.
Found in a shipwreck in the Caribbean. Different from a traditional sword in that the blade folds away, making it easy to conceal. What's all this about? Unger was killed with a sword. We'd like to see yours to compare with the victim's wounds.
We're smarter than that. I know our place is small, but we can find room. We're not buying a life-size Spider-Man statue. There's Sheldon's room. If he really needs a place to live, we should offer it to him.
Can you hold on a second? Hello? Hi. Hi, are you still looking for a place to live? Why would I be? We have a spare room, and if you want it, it's yours.
I'm already afraid of what's coming next. Do you want me to do it? No. I'll do it. We put the same piece of paper... or rather the other half, around this aluminum can. Hold it over the flame I'm going to protect.
We have to find a solution. We have to fix it. We will. The answer's in here somewhere. We'll find it.
He won't make it to the hospital. - Madame. - Oh, my baby! Let them work. We need to remove it.
Let them work. We have to take it out. - No, we haven't... - The bullet's in there. If we don't remove it, he'll die.
It was wise of him to say "we don't need this anymore". Not only from a practical point of view, but also from a human one. After three days with no sign of Japanese surrender, another atomic bomb is dropped on Nagasaki. I now invite the representatives of the Emperor of Japan, the Japanese government... GENERAL D. MACARTHUR ...and the Imperial Headquarters, to come and sign the Acts of Surrender at the place indicated. Let us pray that world peace may be restored, and that God may preserve it forever.
- Why do you ask? Nobody wants you. Don't you see? They were just waiting for an opportunity to drive you out. My father gave it to them.
I left it in the elevator, and it'll take me forever to get up the stairs. Sorry about that. Can it wait? It's an emergency. I've got this Thin Lizzy song stuck in my head, and I need to get it through my fingers.
- Do you have another dresser? - Yes, I have another dresser. Just when I thought you couldn't get any more perfect. It's in... In my storage unit. I'll pick it up tomorrow.
It's your sister. Where are you? The party started an hour ago. The party started an hour ago, I told the kids you'd be here and it wouldn't be cool if you didn't come. And could you come without your wig? Leave it at home.
What's this all about? I'm 10, suddenly you want to talk to me. Lindsey's in trouble. Your gun has been used in murders in DC recently and the like for the past 5 years. She had to hide it before WITSEC could find it.
Can I use your leg to make a tourniquet?" Yes, that was a heroin-addicted Muppet joke. If there was a line, I think I crossed it right there. That's the thing about writing jokes. You have to know where the line is. You don't want to cross it, you want to get close to it.
No, I wanted to buy a drink, and I made $10 buying cigarettes for some kids. Their smiles reminded me of your grandchildren. Gifts from the gas station... What happened to the Christmases of yesteryear? If I see you again, I'll cut your head off. No one will find it until spring, when a coyote fucks your eye socket!
I have a number for you. I've got a number for you. The hackers were hired by Greypool, the private American paramilitary and security company. And Greypool created this fake news story to empty the city. Then they exaggerated the story to keep it evacuated longer.
What's all this? Diane Fowler's living room. It was catalogued, boxed and stored prominently. Looks like the Bureau's run out of executive budget. We'll rebuild the whole scene, and we'll dissect it until we find what we're looking for.
Owen, that goes for you too. Hold the position. Alex, he's right. Owen, we need his earpiece. The cops can't find it.
When ammonium nitrate comes into contact with dihydrogen monoxide... You mean when the water hits the ground? Yeah. It'll freeze the ground around it. Then we can break it into pieces and pull it out like a crumbled brick wall.
I'm not going to say anything about the cops. I'll leave that to Chris Rock. The other big story in sports was the Ray Rice video. Has anyone seen the Ray Rice video? I can't stop watching it.
See, that's the problem with your side. You think the truth doesn't suit anyone, but it's a post-truth world. Nobody wants a boring fact. They want a good story. The better the story, the more they believe whoever's telling it.
Hello. Why do we always get the gruesome cases? Has the coroner determined the date of death? The report just came in. She confirmed it at five days.
Do you copy? Can you move? Yeah, I think I can. You have to keep looking for the beacon. If you don't find it in the next two minutes, the glider will go to safety.
We haven't identified the girl yet, but we did a reverse Google search, someone posted the exact same image on a revenge porn site. It seems our golden boy isn't so perfect. So, now we have a motive. Now we just need to find out who she is, where she is, who she hangs out with. Couldn't we take the different parts of her face, put them together, make a complete image and put it into facial recognition?
They look like our suspects, but there are only two of them. That's all they need to plan their getaway. They're checking the crowd, the escape routes, even you. We need a copy. Can you put it on a key?
Stop! Drop the gun! I heard you killed one. He couldn't have been more than 15. 15 or 50, the trigger doesn't know the difference who pulls it.
Rumor has it that you were promoted on merit as an inspector... is this true? Yes, it's true. What, did you ruffle your feathers in front of the commander, or is your uncle an advisor? I've been undercover for a year. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
Can you treat him? Like before? No, we can't. We have to operate, and fast. If the other half comes out, the staple could end up in your brain or somewhere else you don't want it.
I know it's scary, but it's part of the package. Like airplane turbulence. Nobody likes it, but it's part of flying. This turbulence has been going on for the whole damn flight. I'm trying to get through it, but I'm tied up, and I want to pee like a racehorse.
It was Orson's flavor cup. - Everything had to taste of orange. - Because he hated the taste of water. He took his cup everywhere with him. He never left it anywhere else.
You know, even bloody divorces have their good points. What did the numbers tell you? That Jeff Groves was telling the truth. Marshwood's in trouble, but Orson didn't steal city funds. He was depositing his own money in the town treasury to try to save it.
You can't see the bride! My dress is in San Jose. - I found something sublime. - We can't afford it. You'll wear it once, then we'll return it.
You'll last another two seasons, but after that, you know what you'll become? A poor retired player, lonely and broke. - You want my version of the truth? - Go ahead. Tell me your side. - I won't tell it.
And five years later, bim-bam, something happened. Yeah, but you're going home in three months. You just don't get it. I've been shaking this ketchup bottle for a while now. All she has to do is remove the cap and point it at her fries.
If, in addition to this diary, you found a little skeleton in an elf costume, now you know why. After the dinner incident, things got even more tense. But a few desperate people clung to hope. For this bottle to reach Allie, it would have to go down to the Antarctic Circle Current, be taken to Bengal, then move from the southern currents to the northern ones of the Equator, find a way through the Gulf currents and hope that a Florida fisherman would find it and send it to her.
After the dinner incident, things got even more tense. But a few desperate people clung to hope. For this bottle to reach Allie, it would have to go down to the Antarctic Circle Current, be taken to Bengal, then move from the southern to the northern Equator currents, find a way through the Gulf currents and hope that a Florida fisherman would find it and send it to him. And if I knew the Florida fishermen, I'd probably keep her with me.
I sincerely hope you didn't come for the radio. Walt, we need it to monitor storms and locate boats. You'll sink. Plus, we need it for its crank and some of its components to charge the magnet. No, you'll destroy it.
The mayor of West Altadenia has legally declared me dead so we're going through city hall to bring me back to life. The paperwork requires the brain power of two geniuses working through the night. By the way, I saved something special for you. My letter to Allie. I thought you'd like to give it to her in person. rather than by sea.
By tomorrow, ONYDP will be no more. For what it's worth, Fontino was a pitcher. Yes, 45 years ago. He's retired with a herniated disc and arthritis in both hands. He wouldn't raise the murder weapon above his head, so throwing it hard enough to send blood flying across the room....
If you want to die protecting this tower, forget it! Destroy it! Hey! H-Hey! She's really destroying it!
Here you are. We all said, "That's it, I'm going on." That's... That's what's interesting. Life can be difficult, sad and upsetting. But you don't have to put up with it.
The best cock. I always try the best. Whatever's best, I want to try it. For example, I don't like cognac. I would never buy a bottle of Hennessy and keep it at home.
If someone says to me, "We've got the guy with the best cock. The best cock ever. His dick has been soaking in olive oil since he was five years old. We feed him butter and penis. He has the best cock and you can suck it now."
His cock has been soaking in olive oil since he was five. We feed him butter and penis. He has the best cock and you can suck it now." "Okay, show it to me. Can I see it?
We feed him butter and penis. He has the best cock and you can suck it now." "Okay, show it to me. Can I see it? Can you take it out?
It's magnificent. I've never seen anything so beautiful. I shouldn't have looked. Bring her closer. I don't know what I'm going to do, but bring her closer."
I shouldn't have looked. Bring her closer. I don't know what I'm going to do, but bring her closer." At this point, you have to put it in your mouth, right? If you're looking at the best dick in the world and you're not sure you want to suck it, put it in your mouth.
Goodness... I've got a lot to say. You expect me to memorize all this? - Just the important points. Do you want to read it over together before you sign it?
Waste of time. Glad I'm not an officer. Shit from above isn't for you. I'm no stranger to shit. But I'd rather clean it up than create it.
No, "Thank you, Allie, "for almost ending up in the hole tonight for me." Sorry, I didn't have time to explain. It's time now. Give it back to me.
Think of it as solidarity. Screw you. You know, we may be here together for a while. Don't you think it's about time we buried the hatchet? I'd plant it in your back.
And because of that, Adam, don't you think this party should be at my place? Let Marcy handle it. Yeah, you deported the bison, but she has to live with it. OKAY. Let's do it at Marcy's.
No worries. - I'll take care of the car. - I'll take care of the car. Thanks. According to Jung, we all have a shadow, a dark part of ourselves. It's a part we fear, but at the same time, we feel an irrepressible desire to let it express itself.
Someone in our town is killing people! You don't play the piano, do you? Your manner is hostile and aggressive. You've got to let it go, Velma. Wounds don't heal if you keep opening them.
I ate a side of pork. Not to brag or anything. But right now, it's in my belly. And I realized that you can't eat at a restaurant the way you eat at home, you know? At home, you'd never make yourself a pan-seared pork chop, cook it well on one side before cooking it on the other, and then open it up to see what it's like,
But right now, it's in my belly. And I realized that you can't eat in a restaurant the way you eat at home, you know? At home, you'd never make yourself a pan-seared pork chop, cook it well on one side before cooking it on the other, and then you open it up to see what it's like, and afterwards, you say, "My God, I'm craving that delicious pork chop." As soon as it's hot enough, I'll eat it.
He's just dead! Mike's got to let it go. Should I go back on my word because your client's bullying you? She's a Bono pro. He can let her go.
Mike's got to let it go. Should I go back on my word because your client's bullying you? She's a Bono pro. He can drop it. If I give you a subpoena, you do it.
I usually use the first hour to offer you champagne and get to know you. But the champagne is always chilled, and we can get straight to the point. Are you still overcharging to pay for the Hamptons house? No. I'm working late to pay for it.
She took it, instead of going to court. And I'm telling you, she regretted it for the rest of her life. Oscar, no amount of money can take away the pain. So what's the right thing to do? Do everything you can to make sure no one else feels it.
I've been a freelance journalist for 30 years. I go where I have to go to do my job and make a living. It's a life of wandering... You have to find a good story, an editorial team to cover it and give it to me.
I know what you did. You've been acting all day. You don't go to work. You lied." I went to get my suitcase and started filling it.
The best way to approach him would be to gain his trust a little and ask him to talk about what he knows. I think he'll probably play with you at first, but then he'll start talking. Then he'll get the hang of it. The better you get to know him, the more he'll tell you, before realizing he's exposed himself. It reminds me of the cat who plays with the mouse before killing it.
He wasn't in uniform. I told my father that the man who came to take the letter wasn't in uniform. He said, "It was probably an inspector. You did the right thing by giving it to him."
I told my father that the man who came to take the letter wasn't in uniform. He said, "It was probably an inspector. You did the right thing by giving it to him." All these years, being told it was a clue, that they couldn't give it back to me, made me think:
I went there to give them my contact details, as my parents had died. Was there anything new? Anything to report? Do you have a culprit? But I also want to tell you that I'd like my letter. I understand it's a clue and I can't touch it, but could we...
Was there anything new? Anything to report? Do you have a culprit? But I also want to tell you that I'd like my letter. I understand it's a clue and I can't touch it, but could we... Could I look at it?
Anything to report? Do you have a culprit? But I also want to tell you that I'd like my letter. I understand it's a clue and I can't touch it, but could we... May I look at it? Can I read it?
Do you have a culprit? But I also want to tell you that I'd like my letter. I understand it's a clue and I can't touch it, but could we... Could I look at it? Can I read it? They said they couldn't find it.
Anybody home?" But no answer. We hear each other, because we're all going to the crack. And what happens is that we run into each other on the way to the crack. And sooner than we think, the pressure of that voice filtering through the crack... will burst it open.
How did you find out? I didn't spend my morning perfecting my ass-kissing techniques. You know Lockwood's green department's only been around for three months. They stole this technology. Which is why you should sign with me so I can go get it back.
So there you have it. We're the Yerba Mate in a bag that's a stain on American pop culture. But who are we as individuals? Do you mind if I tell my story? You've got the stage, use it.
I was almost the official voice of CBS. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, but your CBS audition was a marvel. Will you do your CBS audition for them? I don't know if the public wants to hear it. I was going to do it anyway.
Anything you want. Do you have memories of films, things you've kept and love? What can you tell us? I've got my Trois amigos outfit! - Do you ever wear it?
Do you have film memories, things you've kept and love? What can you tell us? I've got my Trois amigos outfit! - Do you ever wear it? - Do I wear it?
What can you tell us? I have my Trois Amigos outfit! - Do you ever wear it? - Do I? - Do you?
Five without chilli. Here, we call it pimento cheese. It's all the same, isn't it? We get the coke out of here. Take it through Cuba, then straight to Miami.
Also, I need to tell you something. Do you? A major film production company has been seduced by your sales, and is proposing to adapt your novel for the screen. If we accept, it'll boost your book's sales even more. I appreciate the offer, but... I'd rather decline.
What if Voltron can't get out of the other dimension? It's another reality, Ezor. What if they can't get out of the other reality? If Voltron disappears from our world, we've won. If they come back with the comet, we'll take it from them.
They'll get the comet back and terrorize all reality. No, you can still get the comet away. Locate the comet, Pidge. I've already picked up its elemental signature. We'll go back for it.
- Here's what we do. Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Shiro. We've got to get that comet. They'll transport it to the base.
I was the whitest person in the audience. In fact, the whitest in the world. I'll pour you a drink when we open. I don't intend to drink, but to collect a credit card in the name of Elsa Gardner. At the risk of sounding like a pain in the ass, only the owner can get it back.
Don't you want the same thing? Of course I do. We have to go North. It's not your fault we lost the war. I know you tried to win it on your own.
I spent my last dollar to come here, took a one-way ticket, and you're talking to me about spirit healing? You're looking at the world through a keyhole. You've spent your life trying to widen that keyhole to see more, to know more. And just hearing that it can be widened in ways you'd never imagined, you reject the possibility. No, I reject it because I don't believe in fairy tales, chakras, energy, or the power of the soul.
Have you finished them all? Yep! Come with me. Let's go. This section is reserved for Masters, but at my discretion, others may consult it.
Seriously, they should put warnings before instructions. Your curiosity could have killed you. You weren't manipulating the space-time continuum, you were breaking it! You don't tamper with natural law. We protect it.
I was talking about him, of course. It's, uh... Hi, junior. If you don't mind me asking, uh, when was the last time we saw this paranormal entity? And if you had to classify it, let's say probably between T1 and T5...
I wasn't fired. Even though I'm holding a cardboard box with a green plant in it. Margaret, hi. I'm just going to air out my plant. I like to put it in a box with all my personal stuff.
It's just a little hiccup. You know what, girls? I think we can really do this. We can become the first scientists to prove that the paranormal exists. All we have to do is find an entity, capture it and bring it back to an environment where we can control it.
Oh, no! Oh, yes! Oh, yes! I wish I still had that presentation. I mean, it was pretty great. I would have loved to have seen it.
Henry, had you forgotten about the gala? I had a place for you at my table. Open up, dear, I just want to talk. I brought you some langoustine. Or I'll leave it on the porch, all right.
Where's that dog going? Wait a minute, wait a minute. I've got some stuff in here you can use. Where's that box? I just saw it.
All of us here are working on a noble and majestic enterprise. Everybody down! Get down! Get down! God has blessed the Bank for International Credit and Commerce - with his infinite goodness. Because we had the courage to receive it in all humility
I'm at the door. I'm ready, just say when. Here we go. The door won't open. I'll go around.
We can keep looking. I think it's important for her to do this. Yeah, it's cute. Did you notice the tag on her dress? She's returning it tomorrow.
Oh, my goodness. I just love it. It's so beautiful. It was my father's. Laura hates it.
I just love it. It's so beautiful. It was my father's. Laura hates it. I should have sold it but I wanted to live here.
- You're not buying an island. - Are you? Because I met someone who knows Warren Buffett's bridge partner. I'm going to offer him shares in my company in exchange for Warren Buffett's cell phone number. I'm going to "I'm looking for you" Warren Buffett, plant my app on him, access billions of dollars in venture capital, buy my island, and fill it with porn stars.
Then I can extradite them both. The president wants to live like a king. Masovich helps him financially with his drug trafficking. If El Toro wants to kill... If he wants to kill the president, why not help him? My job, McRib, is to uphold the law, not break it.
Well, if they don't want them... In the past, they could resell them or throw them away. What about the taxpayer who's hurt by... I raised private funds, for every dollar of the restoration. I loved this house and wanted to share it with the American people as a testament to the greatness of America.
Royalty, to hear you tell it. Royalty means tradition, and tradition means time. There has to be a beginning. After all, there has to be a first day. This is the East Room as Americans have known it for 60 years.
I'm so sorry. Oh, Mother. Jackie. Jackie. What about the guest list for the funeral? What about it? We'll have to narrow it down, dear.
I went into the apartment and never came out. Homecoming was two weeks later. I had a portable radio. Sometimes I listened to music. Eventually, I was nailed to my chair. I only got up to go to the bathroom and eat. The batteries in my radio were gradually wearing out, and I had to hold it up to my ear to listen to it. Then it gave out.
Alexei, open my door, damn it! Come on. Let's go meet your friends. Let's go meet your friends. What do you say? I can close it myself!
I don't want to leave it in the room. Okay. Eksê, I have a favor to ask you. You've got a car, don't you? Can I take it?
I don't know, the spider went away, but it's not like a sad story. I don't know, the spider. The spider. The spider and the downspout, and then it rains, and then she rinses it out.
- I understand your bitterness. Apparently, you've chosen to accept my invitation in spite of it. - He's got a point, Craig. - Where is this thing? - Would you like to see it?
Listen, he's talking about a little a-bite... bee! - A bee of the plush variety. - A bee? There was a bee here. And it was very soft. He let me snog it. There's no truth in what he says!
{\1cH00ffff}That's why we're worth $186 billion. {\1cH00ffff}We pay attention to the bill. {\1cH00ffff}And me to my platform. {\1cH00ffff}My team lives on it. You rent it.
I'd like a room, please. Of course. Of course. It's a weekday, so you're in luck. But we only have the presidential suite left. - We'll take that.
We choose a safe place, a safe day and create a time loop. What's a time loop? A loop preserves the last 24 hours. Reset the loop and the day is yours again. Reset it every day and you can live there forever, totally protected from the outside world.
He was scared. He's a member of the Russian mafia. But you accepted anyway. Have you looked at the contents of the USB stick? I thought I'd just give it to you.
We've come for the black powder. I would have thought so. I came with some mercenaries for the same thing 25 years ago. And did you find it? Finding it and taking it alive, that's two.
Be hurt, absent or cowardly. Stay out of it. We've done our part. The potion must be powerful to put them to sleep. - Spread it well.
Did I pronounce it right? Thank you. Black powder. It's a terrible weapon. It would have been better if you hadn't seen it.
Aguilar was the last person to hold it. You must find out where he hid it. I thought I was here for treatment. Violence is a disease, like cancer. And like cancer, we hope to beat it one day.
They'll think it's a joke. - Defense doesn't have a sense of humor. - No, they don't. Sergeant, the glasses. There's certainly a scientific explanation, but I'm not sending anything to Command until I know.
- Your shots must be precise. - We don't know what it is... Excuse me? Is there anything you'd like to add? If they're wearing cloaking armor, bring it back as intact as possible.
I need you to be our eyes. - Will you put the camera back together? - I've got something better. The camera's already projecting the right wavelength of UV. If I can turn it around and reverse the polarity of certain components, I can turn the camera into a projector.
We haven't even got to the therapy cup yet. Darling, come with me to put the finishing touches to the Huki Muki party. Send it back to me. Are we keeping the Rolls? They're lending it to Emma Bunton, but don't worry.
You keep it right there. Where I'll be. I love you. Do I have to see your deformity every time I go to my bed? Look at it with envy my friend.
You've tried. No one can say you didn't try. But who are you going to save in prison? Probably no one. So why can't you just pick up that stupid gun and brandish it?
- Tonight, I'm flying to Russia. - You are? What's this all about? - A wise old man once taught me that honor is the most important thing in life. I've made a promise and I intend to keep it.
Is Walt Camby on a plane? Can you speed it up? You sound like my mommy. I refuse to talk to you through a door. Next time, I'll leave it open.
Oh, no, you don't. You're not doing this on a Friday night, are you? Sit in front of the TV. The idea of TV, pajamas and takeout is... Take a pool cue, sharpen it and stick it in my eye.
What about the dance school? I don't know about that. No worries. We're a team. We'll find it.
I'm bleeding. Please help me. Drop the gun. You first. Drop it!
Gone! There are over 300 billion birds in the world. That's 75 birds per person. Mom said bird flu was already one of the world's deadliest viruses. For the 3rd Wave, the Others modified it.
That's 75 birds per person. Mom said bird flu was already one of the world's deadliest viruses. For the 3rd Wave, the Others modified it. They made it irresistible. And the birds spread it all over the planet.
Cassie, run! Where's my gun? Evan. Put the gun down. Evan, drop it.
I'd like to ask you a favor. I want you to spend some time in Miami. How much time? I don't know, not long. I won't have your address. Give it to Dion.
- What'd he say? - Let it go. No, no, no, no, no. It's out of the question. Better watch your tongue, my friend. Before you lose it.
That's class. Yes, especially since they haven't seen it. They've only seen the photos. I haven't even met them. Amazing! Who buys a house without seeing it?
It's so easy. I don't think this is a good idea. I'm showing you the famous Craverston hold. Take it. Hold it like a pencil.
If I get caught. See that? No fingerprints. When we move in, we change the locks, but never the garage remote. I forgot to return it when Bridget and Dave asked me to feed Smokey.
3rd question. Is it someone we know? Not that either. Aren't we entitled to the truth? Yes, we are. That doesn't mean I can tell it.
- It's the quality of the bait. - It's too dangerous. - Are you worried about me? No, it's just that my aim isn't as good as it used to be with my spear. So get closer before you throw it.
Thoth, all I need... The answer to the riddle of the Sphynx. A child could have guessed why you came here. Go and ask what the riddle is and come back to me. - I'll solve it.
And destroy all Creation. Ra is not dead. And only he can fight this evil. But he needs his spear. So how do we get it back?
Consider yourself dismissed. You're going to take a message to your boss. Sir, you've already sent him a message, only you're not going to like his answer. Tell him we've taken back his town, we've got his whole valley. If he wants it back, he'll have to make a deal with us.
The crown for Princess Iracebeth. Ignorant peasants. Quiet! Quiet! What are you doing, you idiot? Put it on my head!
No water for him. Have a drink. No, please. No water for him. I give my life willingly.
18 years have passed since the death of my beloved Li Mu Bai. Since then, I've lived isolated from the world. Meanwhile, the ranks of Iron Path followers. Our code of honor and chivalry have become very thin. It is said that the legendary sword, Destiny Can change the outcome of a battle And whoever possesses it cannot be defeated
But not enough. - Master? - Come inside. We can't keep the sword here. Where are you going to hide it?
- Master? - Come inside. We can't keep the sword here. Where are you going to hide it? I can't trust you with this secret. Too many people will be looking for it.
Good heavens! Captain, there's still some current. Let's go up on deck and find the crew. The console's intact, Captain. I'll try to re-power it.
I didn't follow it. - I don't care about the game. - Didn't you hear him at Taylor's? You were supposed to plant the fence. I'll plant it when I get my... hands free!
She loves you. I don't need to be told that. Get the other saw. Where is it? Look for it and you'll find it.
I thought that as soon as I saw him. I said to myself, Rose Lee... you'll be able to open up to him and he'll fill you up! Here's a man who can fill all those voids inside you that make you dizzy. When your daddy came into the house, he was... so big. He filled it!
You know what I see in you? Don't say potential. Potential. You need to expand your horizons, Clark. We only get one life. You need to live it to the fullest.
Get out the red dress. Are you serious? Take off _BAR_'éto_BAR_e. The star_BAR_e? Why, why, why? When you wear a dress like that, Clark, you have to wear it with confidence.
- Holy crap. - Yes. We went out for sushi one day and he tried to speak Japanese to the waitress. I swear, some of the words were in Spanish. He'll probably sell it.
What's next? I'm in. Grab a can. - Got it. - Set it down again.
- Maya, what are you... - Stop it! - Drop the gun! - Put it down! - Put it down!
- No. - Drop it! - Drop the gun. - Drop it, Castro! - Drop it!
I can't believe my eyes. Do you know how much strength that takes? - And the eyes! - Let me see. You have to see the ball with lynx eyes to hit it with an axe.
I must have wasted $200 in quarters on that piece of junk last summer, getting slaughtered by those little devils. Once they hit you, you can't win. You sound like amateurs who haven't mastered the hole method. - What's the hole method? - You're looking at it, Plum.
Well struck, McReynolds. You've had enough, mad dog. Is that the best you got? That's not even close to 145 km/h. Who are you kidding? Go get that ball, I'll sign it for you.
The desert. The audience. Wherever Superman goes, Luthor makes a killing. But, Luthor goes through all that trouble.... Creating a bomb out of a wheelchair and then modifying it to reduce the explosion?
Except Nick Barrow. Listen up, people. You all agreed to be here the day you stole the money. He fights. You don't fight like that without a good reason. Find it.
Pass this on. "Spread the word." "Join the free press." "Fear has taken hold of you." "Kill it."
It's caught up with me. If it's meant to be, it will be. Recite the Law. "Here is the Law of the Jungle, as old as the sky, as sincere. The wolf who respects it becomes prosperous, the wolf who breaks it becomes dust.
The wolf who respects it becomes prosperous, the wolf who breaks it becomes dust. Like the liana on the tree it embraces, the Law, everywhere, passes and passes again. For the strength of the pack is in the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is in the pack." The rain stopped and the dry season set in. Heat crept into the jungle, turning it yellow, then brown and black.
The Red Flower. I don't have one. You're a man, aren't you? That's what makes you a man. You can summon the Red Flower and control it.
You can play them, but not me. I predicted your future. I knew what you would become. Use the Red Flower. Use it against me, like your father.
half the earth's population will die out. But if you don't, the human race will be extinct within a hundred years. What would you do? Humanity is its own cancer. Do you love humanity enough to save it?
The circles of Hell have been arranged differently. It's the same woman from the hospital. We can't stay here and certainly can't trust the consulate. Flatterers soak in excrement, it's not good. If the epidemic exists, do you know how many governments will want it?
No, no, no, no, no. That was... rhetorical. When should we expect the customer's video? It just arrived. His instructions were to upload it within 24 hours.
That was... rhetorical. When should we expect the customer's video? It just arrived. His instructions were to download it within 24 hours. I want to watch it now.
You seem clearer. - I am clearer. - What's your middle name? I am. Zobrist is dead, but if the epidemic is real, then this map is a trail he left for someone to find.
I feel weak, damn it. Let's stop for a moment. Did you see her down there? Yes. Everything I've done, every bit of work and study since I was eleven has been to stop death, not cause it.
- Geniuses don't come into the world with extra rights. No, they come with the responsibility to act when others don't! You want to do something, fine. Then scream your lungs out and leave. If you loved humanity, if you loved this planet, you'd do anything to save it.
Do you feel inspired? I wouldn't use that word. I had this crazy dream. I saw this thing. When I woke up, I couldn't get it out of my head.
Invoke it yourself. Believe me, I've tried. I'm sorry, I don't feel anything here. So it's over? You throw them a buoy, then you take it away?
"that thy days may be prolonged in the land which thy God giveth thee." It's beautiful, it's profound. We should apply this gratitude and loyalty to every aspect of our existence. We were not born into savagery, but into the house of our Lord, the one He and our predecessors built. We must not neglect this house, but celebrate and preserve it, like everything else in Creation.
Mr. DeCourcy arrived at the worst possible moment. Lucy Manwaring had invited herself to Mr. Johnson's to moan. Has she no pride, no self-respect? What an effect she had! She burst out of the library bawling, recognized your handwriting, and snatched the letter to read aloud.
- He read it himself. Hardly gallant! Shocking. Inconceivable. Yes, very shocking. A gentleman who carries a personal letter reads it, and based on a few confidences, I'm condemned to opprobrium!
- Some tea? - Yes, please. There's the church! But the hill? I can't see it.
It was difficult to reach by Jeep. There's a dirt road after the mine, but after that, there's no road. Nice work. What about our POWs? We're still working on them, but if the third creature is still alive, we'll find it.
And if you refuse, I promise you that this time it won't be in a luxury cell that you end up in. - What if the Cavaliers don't need you to get them through? - Okay, so the lab is made up of two distinct sections: the security perimeter and the clean room. The chip should be in this terminal. So we'll have to slide underneath it, then remove it and replace it with a copy.
- You trust your staff. They'll take charge and you'll wait in the car. And you wake up with your eyes open. Back to work. - Excuse me, sir. These people keep following me, you should search them. - Then, we hurry to infiltrate the lab, take the chip to the market, where I'll put it back in the eye so we can finally go home.
I knew you couldn't resist a little bidding war. You doing okay? - I rely entirely on my staff. They've got the case in hand. But I imagine you want to take a look, hold it in your hands, check the quality.
- OK. - There you go. There you go. - It's okay, sorry. - The chip is metal. How do we get it out?
Your father used to come here a lot when you were young. - Would you be patient with me? - You think you're the only one who's wondered for 30 years what could have happened? Well, so have I. Lionel was a master magician. He either tampered with the hinges so he could kick the door open. Or he had access to the lock from the inside to pick it.
Because you have to hope and pray hard that there's someone out there who's totally given up on life and can make her happy. It's just... Excuse me. Can I have the bill, please? - Shall I put it on your room?
- We're not... Separate rooms. - You want separate additions? - No. Put it on my room. Room 106.
Colombian, I think. Everything was going well, the girls were making money. But he tried to force himself on one of the girls, so I intervened. Anyway, he left his card. We didn't want to give it back to him, so that was that.
And if you tell me, why do I need you? Because we know how. I could use other people, probably better. You know, I think you're a man of honor. If I propose an idea that pleases you, I hope you'll let me carry it out.
But they would have found money. I know you want to triumph. I know it will happen. Your ambition is noticed. Sing it!
We were attacked in the night by enraged disciples. The priests paid you to say that. They stole his body and forced us to talk about resurrection. And the stone 10 steps from the tomb? It took 7 men, including me, to place it.
A double engine failure at 2800 feet, followed by a ditching with 155 people on board. No one has ever trained for such an incident. No one has. And that landing at Teterboro, that improbable incline... We're not an acrobatic patrol! How many times did the pilot rehearse this maneuver before succeeding?
I hadn't noticed that... - The tongue was - severed. Savagely. Not surgically. - She could have cut it by bumping into it or by choking -- there are no bite marks.
What's in it? I don't know, but people will love it. - As good as this? - Yeah, I think so. Jade will cut it and sell it.
And I know you want to... you want to escape. I know you want to escape these realities. But, Lou, you've got to take control of your existence, you understand? Don't leave it in their hands.
Where'd you learn that song, Dad? My parents taught it to me. Like their parents before them. And theirs before And someday you'll sing it to your kids too
I know the kind of mutants you're looking for And I'll find them easily This is my first visit to America I'm looking forward to discovering your culture And you won't find it here
He promised! I believed him. Seretse is going to write to Tshekedi to try and reconcile. You have to be strong. You have a voice, use it.
I'll let her out, okay? Let me get the key. - Where's the key? - In my boot. Let me have it.
Places where he hangs out? Any place where there are drugs. Do you have a photo? Yes. You can burn it for all I care.
Of course she does. One day, she'll be home from school. Or she'll be on a date. Or with her friends. And you won't be there to protect her. Let's try it again. This time, take the gun and place it lower.
One day, she'll be home from school. Or she'll be on a date. Or with her friends. And you won't be there to protect her. Let's try it again. This time, take the gun and place it lower. You're holding it too high.
In any case... I'm certainly not a communist. - You only admire their architecture. - I believe in fair play. I've seen the story of David and Goliath repeated in Vietnam, the Soviets in Afghanistan, ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, chemical weapons on the Kurds. The little guy will always need a slingshot, and there will always be someone to pay for it.
I was born awake. Take and pass. Okay, ladies and gentlemen. Here's the new price list. Take a look at it and start studying.
- Perfect! Thank you for this. The jacket... I want the jacket too! No, I'm keeping my jacket. No, you'll tear it when you transform.
- I still need it. - Why do you need it? Okay, amazing! I'll set the watch for you. And I'll set it to... 8:22 p.m.
Let's play one of my favorite games. Now, the rules are simple. My boys will press pressure points on you. You'll scream. Then, I'll give you this stress ball. You can squeeze it, if you're lucky. It'll help you relax.
When a mosquito bites you, it leaves an enzyme that other mosquitoes can smell. And I can smell it on you, darling, anyone can. So you can run for your whole life. Your whole life. But the worst, and I insist, the worst people in the world will recognize that smell and they'll follow it.
I miss my father so much that some nights I can't sleep, and then I tell myself that he's protecting me. Sometimes there's this shame that almost breaks my back, and then I think when you owe your life to someone, you have to live it.
See the handle, how well made it is? I have a dry one, but it's from a pine tree, and pines are tough. Olive? The olive tree too, and the trees found in people's gardens. Every time you see a branch shaped like a handle, you grab it.
Got it. You got the slingshot? It's at Aunt Maria's. I want to dedicate a song to my son Nello, "Incendie en mer", if you can play it because it's always bad and they can't go fishing, Nobody can make a living in this terrible weather.
"Mon petit âne", another Sicilian song. And we continue with the show. We have another request: Maria dedicates the song "Incendie en mer" to her son Nello, in the hope that the weather will improve so that he can go out with his boat to work. I'd like to join her in dedicating it to all fishermen.
- The second line too? - No, I'm afraid not. Let's see the other one. Now read the first line. Can't you see it?
- No, it's not. Let's see the other one. Now read the first line. Can't you see it? Not like this, if I do it like this, maybe, but like I can't see her.
Take a look here. Is it better or worse? - Are you still looking at the lines? - Yes, the first letter. I can't see it, it's worse.
My mouth is dry from talking so much. If you want my help... There's been a mistake. I'm helping you. You got that, asshole? It's your shit and your boss's shit, so you'll see it when it suits me.
If I found this, others will too. Take care of business. Now, listen to me. The whole case rests on this. We've got a case and we're going to win it.
Why did you come to work for me? Because I thought we both wanted the same thing... the truth. There is no truth in the law. Everyone lies. Stop looking for it.
Because I thought we both wanted the same thing... the truth. There is no truth in the law. Everyone lies. Stop looking for it. You won't find it.
- Me too. - Bye, honey. Bye, honey. I love your room. I'd never leave it if I could.
-Have Bixby, Jeannie and Swopes tried to betray you? 2 are dead, the 3rd has disappeared. -Me, Bixby, I loved him like a son. I wouldn't touch a hair on his head. -This Clem used to take heroin to Oxford and hand it over to Jeannie, who acted as an intermediary for Rose?
What do you want? I bought you a TV. Well... you've got a conscience after all! Do you want it or not?
You're welcome. That's enough of that! Step right up. We're going to teach you the true nature of the Lycan warrior. For this lesson, our esteemed guest Selene will play the brave protector of our fortress. I'll play the evil Lycan... who's come to destroy it.
Let me clean that up. That's interesting. - What's interesting? - This blackmail letter. If I put it under the magnifying glass, the letters get bigger, but when I take it off, they get small again.
Australia is an ideal place. Does everyone have a towel? - It's called a "towel". - Napkin. Put it on your lap like this, so the food doesn't stain your clothes.
- Excuse me? Are you still waiting for someone? Or can I take this plate? - Yes, you can take it off. - No, leave it.
Are you still waiting for someone? Or can I take this plate? - Yes, you can take it off. - No, leave it. No, take it.
- What for? He's not gonna do anybody. Don't talk. What I meant to say was that Saturday at midnight, Blue Mountain State will seize this... Goats house and sell it to the highest bidder.
Sit down before I get angry! I'll get right to the point. Talk, damn it. The Dean wants to sell the Goats' house. And I was thinking, since you're super rich and famous, you could buy the house and give it to me.
- What does she propose? - Let her speak! Send your best troops to Scarif. Send the entire Rebel fleet if you have to. Let's steal the Death Star plans if there's a chance to destroy it!
And I'm one with the Force. Deflector shields at 50%, we're taking heavy damage. There's no turning back, we have to support the attack. Shoot that opening. We see it, Gold Leader.
And the rest will follow. Freddy, what's wrong with this machine? It bumps along at times. It's about to go off the rails. Send it back to the shop.
A warmer climate would help. If Hawaii is better for you, I'll come. HONG KONG WEDNESDAY - JUNE 5, 2013 Janine, how did the call with the White House go? I was clear that we held a genuine FISA court order. They wanted to see it.
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute! OK... - We're done! You made this up? Okay, fine, I made up a mission. Because I wanted to make sure it worked before I showed it to you.
Here, it's very thin. I'm going to get off the MA. It's one small step for man... one giant leap for mankind. And the... The surface is very fine and powdery. I can lift it gently with my feet.
Thank you. Moderation in the pursuit of justice is not a virtue. Let me also remind you that extremism in the defense of freedom is not a vice. You know how to win a campaign? By not losing it.
Not me, you. It doesn't matter how many delegates you have at a convention. - It's not fair. - We're going to make you one last offer. Take it, or take your principles and go begging on the street, and see where it gets you.
He'll do what he has to do to get elected. But I think he really wants civil rights. We have a chance, Bob. A real chance. The best one we've had in 100 years, and I'm not going to pass it up.
I won't let my people be fooled by their prejudices. I want to believe that people everywhere can be treated with dignity, equality and freedom. We have a new law. A civil rights law. And I'm going to enforce it, because it's my moral duty!
Everyone's waiting for you. Come and celebrate. It's your party. I'll be there in a minute. It's kind of my party, and I sweated blood to bring her into the world.
She doesn't even know what death is. You want to explain death to her? You might as well tell her that Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny don't exist, while you're at it. I don't think you'll make a habit of it, but if you have the chance to protect a child from the grief this world so generously hands out, I think you should take it.
You put the down payment on the house, $400,000. We both paid the loan, right? I want the house. The car is worth $190,000. If you want it, pay the price.
You really are a geek. Uncle Trent says it's like he disappeared. You know what? Uncle Trent had his chance. It's my turn now, and I'm not going to be poor all my life. The old man's fortune is real. It's on this island, and I'm going to find it.
The 18th hole goes right through here. That's your grandfather right there. Breaks my heart. I love this house. Before they tear it down, I want to show you something.
Sarman, be careful! - Tie that rope over there. -All right, Sarman. Lothar! Pull it out and tie it to the first boat.
- Tie that rope over there. -I'll do that. Lothar! Pull it out and tie it to the first boat. Tie it, quick!
Tie it, quick! Give her more slack! - Hurry! - Bring her in! Hurry up and turn her!
He even gave me this ring. I call it my magic ring. It's not an engagement ring, but I know the question won't be far off. When we first came here I showed you my engagement ring, didn't I? I can hardly look at it now.
Okay. Take care, honey. Hey, Elaine, it's me. You left your ring here. You're probably driving but I'll leave it on the way back.
Stay if you like. Ruthie, quick. Before he gets here. Did you take the TV? We'll sell it.
I like it. We'll let the lawn grow really high. And we need a pool. A round pool. I can see it already.
I always listen to my mother. When I die, she'll be there waiting for me. I never lie. Every morning, I open this door. Every evening, I close it.
You're really smart. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Wherever we go, we'll find a good school. Since we finally had a bed, we could dream. You know this can would still be here in 500 years if we threw it away?
There's something else. I'm pregnant. I wished I were dead. And if I could keep my eyes closed, I could almost forget everything. But I'd made a promise and I had to keep it.
Let's talk about the future, and how we're going to change it. Are you talking about stopping the Jacobite rebellion? Isn't that what we said? We promised we'd think about it? If there's going to be a war with England, shouldn't we be figuring out how to win it instead of preventing it?
- Air conditioning. Did you say Mie Câline? - Air conditioning. - Huggytime Bear? Sometimes Conner has an idea, and he goes after it. Aquaspin PRESENTS THE CONNQUEST TOUR And he's right 99.9% of the time, so you have to believe in him.
You know why I can talk to him like this? Because I'm officially the agent in charge. Which gives me authority over a special agent who's above your captain, who's above you. So the evidence stays at the crime scene as long as I'm not there. You don't do a search unless I order you to. You get a print, you give it to me.
I'm like that guy. He spends more time under than over. He should worry more about his hearing hygiene. You looked a little nervous. If you recognize fear, you can overcome it.
- Why'd you do that? - Oh, excuse me, Frank. We thought you were the asshole who wanted to buy the mountain. I'm the asshole buying the mountain. I'm turning it into a members-only resort for millionaires who want to plow their trophy whore in private.
Imagine yourself on a beach. It's sunny. There are lots of people, children playing. A warm breeze blows across the ocean. You feel it on your face, just like the sun.
Shall we play "maidservant" as before? From morning to night, we see no sign of the Count. Certifying the marriage and converting the inheritance into cash requires a lot of work, he says. How can you be so cruel? You've plucked the flower, now replant it.
It's Patrick, he tripped over Grandma's dollhouse, but he's okay! Kids, what's going on here? Nothing's the matter! Sandy, my mother really wanted this dollhouse. - Yeah, I know, Mom. -If you smash it to bits...
I went to see them last week and talked to them about the situation, and it turns out that Georgie junior is going to college in Boston this fall, and Jimmy is graduating in a year. We can rent out the house until you're 18. And then you can come back if you want. When you're 21, you can sell it or keep it or do whatever you want.
It's a song I wrote for you. - Hank? - Hmm? Take my hand. Okay, now put it on his hand.
Let me buy the farm, please. Well, go ahead, make me an offer. I need to go to the bank, negotiate a loan. My family has farmed this land for generations. And I'd like to be able to pass it on to my daughter.
There's only one. But... but it's kind of tricky. - A big one? - This thing is supposed to bury absolutely everything we've tried before. And there's no hangover. It's the perfect drug. But you can only take it once. You can only take it once. - And that's it.
And I won't have to call the police. Get out of my sight, old man. Let's do this the easy way, shall we? I'm offering you a way out. What do you say? Give me back the candy or I'll have to come and take it away from you.
And I want it noted that I think this is a bad idea. No matter what we do here, this house and the Senator are in danger the night of the purge. Do you understand me? Duly noted. We're locking it. "Lock it down."
Happy purging, you old wreck! You'd better find somewhere else to go. I've got a sweet tooth tonight. And I want my candy bar. And I'll take it.
I'm implying that it's time to put yourselves out of harm's way too. We're at war to protect Nassau. A war in which our most powerful weapon is the fear we inspire in our enemies. We've succeeded in making Captain Flint the name of a grim death for every one of them. The only way to ensure that this story lives on is if he tells it in person.
Did you clean it like I told you? When I can. It's harder when you're at sea. I understand your aversion to being seen using crutches. Well, if you do, I wish you'd stop bringing them up.
The Kindnesses of Astapor and the Judicious of Yunkai. Helped by their friends in Volantis. You see? No need to worry about the rebellion. It's enough to worry about the rich cities that finance it.
Just tell me what you want. Take what you want. It's yours, okay? Hey, you like weed? Untie me and I'll get it for you.
You're not a cop, bitch. Oh, yes, I am. I'm a fucking cop. Put the gun down. And you too! Trunk, put it down.
Holy shit. - Where's the door? - I don't know where the door is. Where is it? Can you see it?
I'll pick it up for you, Mr. Hereward. And I have this for you. Strawberry jam from my Violette. Nectar of the gods. If she'd let me sell it, we'd make a fortune.
This photograph is my memory. I did 27 years at Hayward's. My husband did 30. My husband did 30. He got his seniority award watch before he died. Ian wears it now.
And Linda. And now... I suppose I could ask to see the ring. It's lovely. He sold his father's watch to pay for it.
My mother's parents threw her out. She tried everything to feed me, find me shoes. I didn't realize how much it had broken her. But I wish, oh, I wish so much that she were here now to hug her, to tell her she was good and strong, the bravest woman I've ever known. Shame holds us captive if we let it.
Belonging to a community is the Holy Grail of modern life. In today's world, when we can't find it, we turn to the past and say:
And you have nothing to be ashamed of. No, I don't. And I won't talk to the police. There is a time to mortify our flesh. And a time to cherish it, and marvel at its strength.
His mark remains... on the wall. Put that away in the kitchen. This is for after the debate. In the United States, the pill was originally approved for the treatment of menstrual disorders. But hundreds of American women take it as a contraceptive that has been declared 100% effective in preventing pregnancy.
- She always goes for the one at the community center! Why spend so much money when she's having fun with a basket of sticks and pine cones? Just in time for some bacon! Where's your scarf? It's a school scarf, so I wear it to school, and today's Saturday.
Every mercenary knows the jambo, AmahI. these guys are good. Base, we've got a bunch of Russian SA-7s. Have him watch the truck as long as possible. We'll find the cache and blow it up with a Hellfire.
Can you see us in the C.T.? We have to go in. What if the first assault was a diversion before the real attack? For God's sake. Open the door, or I'll blow it!
That's what I'm telling you. And as a proud lieutenant in the NYPD, my partner and I are responsible for each other. We need to know each other's whereabouts 24 hours a day. Thanks to the GPS on my partner's phone, I have Mr. Cage's home address. And I'll give it to you if you're a good boy.
We've got to get my dad's ring back. Remember what he was like before he drank? Eddie's basically a good guy. To me, the only thing left of him is his ring. He didn't sell it because I took it from him.
Just another poor bitch from the Polo Grounds. Is that why you became a cop? I kick ass and shoot back. I handcuff murderers. I don't seek justice, I pursue it.
But his real son was Carl Lucas. The crazy thing is... Nobody said anything. And Carl and I grew up good friends, despite all the tension. We felt it like a draft under the door.
How do you destroy a SIM card? It doesn't... I can't even... Can I just swallow it? Yeah, swallow it so they can track it back to your ass!
- If you hadn't been there... - I was. Of course you were. Don't worry about the car. I'll get it back to you.
Sit down, please. How much are the Germans paying you to inform on your compatriots? Put the gun down. I said drop the gun. Put it down.
Thank you for your time. Not at all. Come on. She's dropping the case. She entrusts it to me, but there's no one else at the firm to help me. So I look outside.
can it happen? Would you want that to happen? I'm asking you. The question is: can we determine whether this wound was caused by the broken glass or by the knife blade? Look at it very carefully.
- Mr. Church... - Come on, now! - I'm so sorry about this. I give you one rule... - and you don't follow it, do you?
Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Henry. And this boy was afraid of almost everything... except ladybugs. - Ladybugs? - Ladybugs. And one day, he was outside... and he spotted a ladybug and decided to chase after it.
- What's her name again? - It's Sarah. Yes, Sarah. You drew this house next door, but it's not next door, is it? - No, otherwise we'd see it.
You're new. Not a single crust. I'll give you a discount. No offense, but... I'd rather earn a woman's affection than pay for it.
Sounds like fun. You're new. Not a single crust. I'll give you a discount. No offense, but I'd rather earn a woman's affection than pay for it.
Oh, Teddy. You're such a son of a bitch. I know I am. But we have the same values. The business may be disgusting, but it has to be done.
And now for the traditional father-daughter waltz. I wish your mother could be here for your big day. Would you shut up?
At the foot of the wall, you'll find a stone that doesn't belong there. That's a lot to remember. What's the short version? It's right here. With all the information on this USB stick, I bet you could sell it for millions of dollars.
What's the short version? It's right here. With all the information on this flash drive, I bet you could sell it for millions of dollars. You seem very interested in this flash drive. Would you mind keeping it?
We'll see how your therapy goes, and maybe I'll consider talking to someone. S06E14 Murderjuana Your jacket's wrinkled. - Stop it! Stop it! - You could have ironed it.
N... Tunnel. I'm going to set up roadblocks in front of the tunnels. They found his car in a parking lot 3 km from the asylum. He had to park it and walk back to avoid being seen.
Can we order a pizza, please? - Yes! Pizza sounds delicious. I thought you had a writing class. I must have missed it.
This will help a lot. - What is it? - The lifetime value of favors. What are you going to do with the bomb? According to protocol, we have to detonate it at the scene of the crime, which we'll do once the sergeant is safe.
- What is it? - The lifetime value of favors. What are you going to do with the bomb? According to protocol, we have to detonate it at the scene of the crime, which we'll do once the sergeant is safe. Well, is it possible to disarm it, so we can keep the evidence?
We haven't talked about it, but I've always wanted children... We both do. - Don't we, darling? - Yes. "Fill the Earth and subdue it."
No, I'm fine. OJ left a suicide note. It's so awful. I don't know what to do with it. Should we give it to the police?
Don't worry, I'd never hurt your boys. This gun is only for me. No, you don't want to do that. Everything's going to be all right. You should throw it through the window.
We'll let you in. We know you want to go. We'll let you go home. But this gun scares everyone. Please throw it away.
Welcome to jury selection. Welcome to jury selection. I must confess, I've never seen a case as strange as this one. I don't have any problems with the police. Once when my car stalled, they helped me push it to the side of the road.
But that's the verdict, that's the position, of the jury. It's their voice. And I accept that verdict. We've come in search of justice. And you'll have to be the judges, I suppose, to say whether or not any of us find it today.
We don't support the Sons of the Harpy. Fine, fine, but you'll stop all the same. I hope you will accept, my friends. You won't get a better offer. Let's ride the wave of freedom instead of letting it drown us.
My lord. My lord. My friends, the hour has come. Madness has seized the city and closed its fangs on my children. We must drive it back under the rocks from whence it came.
This isn't working. I told you I had a plan. - I deserve the crown. - No one deserves the crown. Then I'll take it.
Knowing that Kubo can count on a protector when I'm dead will be a fitting end to my story. Your story will never end. He will tell it, and it will be retold by those to whom he has told it. And by those who heard it. And by those who will tell it again, and by those who will tell it again.
My father's fortress. Yes. The last piece of armor. Is it here? Follow the setting sun and you'll find it in the place that could have been your home.
What do you think is going to happen to you? When you live with us on the estate, you sign a contract, you hear? - You understand that, you little fucker? - Don't you fucking do it! When I ask you for your car, you give it to me, you say yes.
You look great. You really do. And you're very handsome. I know you didn't have a choice. And I was stupid not to recognize my good fortune. I give you my word and I'll keep it.
But what about your health? To hell with my health. I want you to have everything, my son. This house and everything in it. Leave it as it is, a piece of history, our history.
You're home. Yes. The forensics results are in. The bomb's timer was activated remotely by phone, which was clever. Giving him time to drop it off early and arm it whenever he wanted.
I believe you used to run Pinewood. I believe you've relaunched the program, and I'd like to know... Why are you really here, Mr. Gordon? I beg your pardon? The whole city has turned its back on you, even though you risked your life to save it, time and time again.
- Who the hell are you? - I am Azrael, righteous scourge of sinners, and I've come to kill you, James Gordon. Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon! Drop it now or I'll shoot!
I think I'll just have a cheeseburger deluxe, two pieces of pie, maybe an egg cream. - I'll have that. - And a waffle. A big, important drug case has come across my desk, and I need your help. The only problem is, the sergeant doesn't think you can handle it.
I'm not talking about your burnt crotch. That never happened. There were only slight blisters. The only thing they can hold against you is that you never solved the case. So why don't we solve it ourselves?
That brought me to this. There's way too much crime in New York. No one should live here. Anyway, I struggled with this for a few hours, but cheered up after taking a picture of the kittens playing with my sweater. I'll show it to you later.
What were you doing in New York? Why all the questions, Regis? Actually, it's Michael Strahan now. What? She's so scary. She's so scary. I saw her pull a tooth and throw it in another girl's eye.
I stayed there long enough. What's done is done. I know everyone feels that... I feel like... a tough decision was made. I'm lucky you had the courage to make it.
If I'm wrong, fill out the questionnaire and reschedule. 150 $. My last name is Grosse. Like, "What a fat bitch!" When an idea chases us, we hum it on the train.
150 $. My last name is Grosse. Like, "What a fat bitch!" When an idea chases us, we hum it on the train. We love it, we hate it.
Maybe it doesn't count yet. Gotta go. Lip? We're almost ready to start. When the priest asks for the ring, you just give it to me, okay?
I suppose I'll have to. Lucky Pierre. My dear Count Bezukhov, how kind of you to visit my little salon when you must still be suffering from your poor father's death. Yes, but I hardly knew him. Most of all, I'm embarrassed by my good fortune in inheriting such a large fortune; I've done nothing to deserve it.
How are things? This is reception. I have a delivery for Mr. Richard Roper. I need a signature. I'm sorry, sir. I can't drop it off.
We put a cup like this, one like this, one like this... Okay? Now, I take the ball and put it in the cup. I shake the cup. I turn it over.
Frankly, they haven't missed a thing. The next boat leaves in 15 minutes. Do you often think about death? No. I mean... not necessarily your own death, but the idea of giving it, of killing someone.
Maranda. Isn't that your brother selling grass to some farm outside town? Yeah, that's what I said. My brother, Daffodil. Why don't we spend all our money buying Daffodil's weed and selling it at the tailgate party this weekend?
(CRYING) Oh, shit! JIMMY: She's coming! Free weed! Get it!
Once upon a time, there was a very great lord, and his name was Bluebeard. Now, this lord had a beautiful young wife, but she died, and some people thought it was Bluebeard's fault, but didn't dare say so. And then, one day, Bluebeard said to himself, "It's time I found myself another beautiful, young wife... "tell the story, daddy tell the story!
I'll never leave you. My dear Sonya. Did I ask you to interrupt me? Sorry, Your Excellency, but this letter... Very well, give it to me.
You'd be guilty of living the way others want you to live. What's the meaning of life? Life! The brain asks questions, the heart gives answers. Life doesn't have a meaning, you have to live it!
You won't even get your gun. There's no way I'm hiding it in my super-sexy, skintight Mars outfit. Oh, I'm kidding. There's no skin-tight outfit. But if I take a gun, and it's found, I'll be exposed.
Get up! Get up! Be nice. That's my hand for counting. Drop the gun or he's dead. I said drop it.
Be kind. That's my hand for counting. Drop the gun or he's dead. I said drop it. Drop it!
We should wait until we have fingerprints on the murder weapon. Aren't we going to arrest him? No, well, yes. He confessed. Of course we arrest him. But any good lawyer could get that confession thrown out, but now that we know where the gun is, all we have to do is recover it, dust it for prints, and we'll have an airtight case.
My father confessed. It won't stick. I'll say he told me where he put it. Your father doesn't know where the gun was. I asked him. You're the only one who knew where to find it.
You don't know what you're talking about. Only this son has everything you don't. He was born with that genius, that spark you've always wanted. And to top it all off, he was going to create something magical. This little shit was going to give it to Lisa Hexler.
You followed your brother to the rendezvous. You asked him for the battery, he refused, you killed him. I understand that. But why kill Lisa? I tried to sell it to her, but she understood what I'd done and said I had two choices.
We have to put everything back in order. Remove everything that links us to Theresa's death. When you've finished, I'll give you what you want most of all. I'll free you from the memory of what you've done. And from the memory of your relationship with Theresa. Recalling her would only deepen your grief and risk attracting attention.
You remember. You seem to be part of the same new scenario. They say survival here requires determination. I'm determined to save Dolores. Wyatt, to take over the land or destroy it, but you... you remain a mystery.
He was educated, charming, wealthy, a member of the Dallas Petroleum Club, and in 1962, he became Lee's best friend. We found out there was a couple, who had emigrated from... Russia, and they were going through a rough patch, financially, so I went to see them. Tell me, Jake, why would this guy hang out in Lee's crappy apartment? Are they swingers? Lee took his cigarette from him and put it out on his shoulder.
I take my work seriously. I'm... very grateful to you for... How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb? Classic. One to climb the ladder, one to shake it and one to sue the manufacturer.
And he wants it to happen subito. "Immediately", in Italian. I know what it means. It had to happen sooner or later. I admire you for putting it off for so long.
Why do you ask? I don't get it. I don't get it. He gets points for... - Yeah, eating it and... - If I was tired and the cat box was there, I'd eat it.
So that painting I bought from you wasn't worth anything? Of course it wasn't. It meant something to you. It's worth exactly what you paid for it. - I want to sell it.
Of course you can. Pick a card, any card. Hmm... Now take a good look at that card, please. Perhaps you'd like to move it a little closer, enough so that you can see it clearly.
Guys, I found it! You found what? I found... the bomb. Mr. McDonald, you've made an important discovery. Can you share it with us? Yes.
And you need my help to ensure that this address will convince the most converted? Precisely. How sure are you that this would be a bad thing? What is it? If the Navy takes over, storms the beach and cleans it up, and why would that be such a bad thing?
What are you talking about? Are you saying Flint caused this storm? He caused us to enter it. And who's more powerful? The one who created the storm or the one who convinced us to beat it?
I'm the last survivor out of 13 from the crew of a slave ship captured when the wind blew us aground on this island. I learned 12 hard lessons from that woman. All with the same ending. That sooner or later, death awaits every man who sets eyes on this island. AND before you die, she makes sure you fear her.
Like what? I think they want us to think they're all in agreement here. But in a place like this, how is that possible? There's a sympathetic ear here. We just need to find it.
If you want to leave here, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving. No, I don't. And I think you know I'd never let you call a vote to decide who this fleet will follow and risk diminishing my strength by baiting a minority. I guess not. So we have a fleet and two men claiming it.
I'm well aware that I'm not the first to have partnered him in this way, and that those who have seen the abyss before me have never returned. So we have a fleet and two men who claim it.
The night you left, in the cave, you said Jack was arrested. What the hell is going on? Spanish intelligence. They know about the cache. They asked the governor to find it and return it.
Spain is more furious than ever They see it as an affront. They're so furious, in fact, that they're willing to burn Nassau just to prove it. The only way Rogers can avoid this is to find the cache and return it. Which means, if we find it first, we can dictate what happens next.
And get the longboats ready. I'll lead the landing as soon as we arrive. This fucking chair. To get it, we have to win partners, call them our friends, make promises. To keep it, you have to break them all.
Because if we'd had it, we'd now be up against a force greater than our own, time would be against us, and we'd have no way of securing Jack's release. This way, the governor has everything he needs and no reason to suspect a problem, leaving him to get on with his plan. A plan you think we can disrupt? Jack and the gold are going to be secretly transported in a convoy to a ship waiting somewhere near the south coast. If we can intercept this caravan, we can both recover the gold to start our war and the partner to help us fight it.
From this moment on, any man participating in an act of piracy will be presumed to be one of you. I'd catch him and hang him. If I were you, I'd encourage Governor Rogers not only to send the gold, but also the man responsible for stealing it. Jack and the gold will be moved in a secret caravan. If we can intercept this caravan, we can secure the gold to start our war and the partner to help us do it.
The governor has everything. He suspects nothing. By intercepting the convoy, we'll have the gold we need for our war and a partner to fight it.
Demand has changed. The house can change the rules. Unfortunately, home is New York State. Your junk was packed and marked. What's it going to cost me to get it back?
This is the first time you've heard about her boyfriend. This loser is not her boyfriend. It's an error in judgment. At least he's not a car thief. The car's in my name and I didn't tell him he could drive it, so I'm suing him.
I can handle the subway for a week. Why don't you meet me at my office, I'll grab a few things, and we'll go. I'm in. Good lesson. Never lend your car to a friend. I won't lend it at all.
Throw it far. Ready? Throw it away. The car I brought is clean. No one will look for it.
I gave him his first handjob. We were from the Valley. He became a big dealer. His drugs were the best. I sold it for him.
And? and we think it's a fair and generous offer. Interesting. Allow me to object. How would you feel about taking this offer, and shoving it up your beloved girlfriend's ass?
Sister. This is our bride-to-be. Welcome home, Father. The dress isn't finished. I didn't want you to see it this way.
Three, the prisoner was injured in custody and then something about his condition. And the investigation continues. I have to stop you. You're not making that statement. What's that? The chief wants me to.
You can tell him... that I'm no longer involved in this line of work. He's not with Markridge anymore. I know who he's with. I was poison at that job. Reshaping life so you can destroy it?
What am I supposed to be, a piece of something? It's just a matter of time before my dear wife passes away. And didn't I tell you she was going to leave me her shares of the Empire? And I've always imagined that you and I would either dismantle this company or start a new one... Dismantle it...
I don't see it. There were only orange trees. Torn down after the war, replaced by caravans for GIs. The American Dream. To each his own house, car and garage to put it in.
Do you think your ex-husband is behind this? - I think it's obvious. - Yes, Lana. Mr. Shapiro wanted me to go to his house. I imagine the disk is there, in a safe. I want you to go there and get it.
Fired! They should be dissolving at the bottom of a barrel! Veronica entrusted me with the protection of her diskette. I failed. Maybe, but we'll get it back.
Voicemail joke! So much for stuffing them down a wood chipper. I hope it's a bar. You, fire the limo. Take it straight to the junkyard.
So much for stuffing them down a wood chipper. I hope it's a bar. You, fire the limousine. Take it straight to the junkyard. Shame to crush it.
- It's not so nice to leave. Look, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I just... I had this chance. We had this chance. I want to share it with you.
- Don't follow me into the bathroom to tell me about your freedom, Jane. Tell me about the Nutella tax. - Yikes. Are we really going to call it the Nutella tax? - Palm oil is the key ingredient in Nutella. If the federal government taxes it at 300%, it's going to cost a lot more to gorge on.
- Palm oil is the key ingredient in Nutella. If the federal government taxes it at 300%, it's going to cost a lot more to gorge on it. - Palm oil is in everything, isn't it? - We could have called it the soap tax, but people care more about Nutella than soap. Only five more senators to convince to vote against the bill and we can count on Jacobs to withdraw it.
It's a skin-changer! People fear skinwalkers more than other creatures. Because they can live among us without being seen. If word gets out, there'll be panic. - Can you find the thing and kill it?
Delay them. Slean, go west to Scorann. You and I, brother, will ride north for the others. You swore to avenge Bayen. Can you find this thing and kill it?
How do we know? - You open the box and look. Before opening it, while it's still closed. Is the cat alive or dead? Am I allowed to listen? - No. Or shake the box, or lift it?
- We open the box and take a look. Before opening it, while it's still closed. Is the cat alive or dead? Am I allowed to listen? - No. Or shake the box, or lift it? Or pierce it?
I've never seen her wear this. The date has no significance. It's not any of our birthdays. It's not Dad's death or Melissa's death. What's so special about this piece that she'd frame it to wear around her neck?
You're getting paint out of my nose. I have paint on my face? Dude, look at the moon! What's up? When you see a moon like that, do you ever think... that life is wonderful and maybe we shouldn't waste it by being high all the time?
Leave it to me. Yes, yes. I cut myself on the paper. - There's a note. - You can read it. LES ANIMAUX NOCTURNES EDWARD SHEFFIELD "Dear Susan, my novel will be published in the spring.
We share your money. Always with your BJK... ATM... etc... I saw Saraswati's picture on Bunty's computer. And while looking at it...
There's always another one. That's what your sister thought. Look where it got her. The claw is made of a titanium alloy. It has to be removed slowly.
I'm fine. Look, I'm a 20-year-old mechanic. The world is better off without me trying to save it. I don't understand your decision. But I respect it.
He didn't need it in the asylum. He'll need it now. How many are there? I don't know how many. Normal. I'll give it to Erik.
Leonard said, "I didn't play him like that, "but as a man trying to control his emotions." I thought that was a subtle and ingenious choice, because it created a dynamic tension on screen, especially in the close-ups, where you could see him containing himself. You have to destroy this thing. You've already tried to destroy it once.
And he decided to embark on his own journey of recovery. My first pictures were taken with this camera and enlarged with this camera, with 20 cents worth of Kodak material. I became fascinated by the possibility of creating an image you could hold in your hands, an object you could grasp, it was there. I'd take a picture in the morning, and in the evening, I'd hold it in my hands. I could hang it on the wall or give it to my family.
What are you doing? We prayed... together. Prayed for God to save our city. Our prayers have been answered. God will save Alexandria... because God gave us the courage to save it ourselves.
Then I covered myself with leaves and brush and slowed my heart rate to about 9 beats per minute, allowing me to enter a kind of metabolic stasis. In the spring, I woke up and came out of my cave to see how things were going with your mother. She was still dating that guy, so I kept waiting. Huh. Seasons went by, your mom was seeing other men, I was dozing in my cave, every now and then I'd get out of the logging operation to steal food from the campsites... that is until the campers started putting it in those metal containers I couldn't open.
Two researchers with a touch of psychopathy about them. They've also served time in prison, but for torturing a rival who had copied their formula for an antidepressant. Let's just say they're not very likeable. But they're still geniuses. We tried to buy the formula from them, but they wouldn't listen, so... So you want to steal it.
Start with the decor. This is based on a timeline of the last five weeks. The two chemists live isolated in a little shack just over there, and two kilometers away we have their laboratory, which is in another old shack. - How can you be sure that the formula is hidden in the lab? Because we know the chemists keep it on an external hard drive.
I don't believe in marriage. Excuse me, you don't believe in marriage? As a concept? You have to keep the highway open. Because... sooner or later, you're going to get sick of the same cars crossing it.
This is your new life now. The more you struggle, the harder it will be. So if one of us comes knocking on your door... you open it. This door belongs to us. If you try to stop us, we'll break it down.
We can't stay here and let her catch them. We just can't. You want to try again? I want to finish what we started. I want to kill her.
- Shut the fuck up. Shut up, Scott. I'm a partner here! The three of us built this company. - And now we're selling it.
For the Democrats, this is "very worrying". For the senator, these twists and turns are taking place at the end of an election campaign, not during a confirmation. For Danforth, the whole thing smells of sulfur. According to Ms. Thomas, he's writing a statement. - He wants to publish it.
Hi, baby. Hi, baby. What's wrong with Elmo? He was at the vet getting neutered, remember? I want the house.
Integrate Connerty and his team when the time comes, but again leave me out of it, Lonnie. I'll take care of it right away, keep your involvement between us. All right, Lonnie. Why am I wearing this crap? I'm not wearing it.
I can and I will. It will become your ultimate weapon. Raise your hand. I'll put mine on top. Try to raise your hand. See? When I raise your hand, you rise. When I lower it, you go down.
Right here on these cakes. because we used up all the eggs we had. I don't understand how anyone could do that to their own baby. I do. Fear is a powerful thing. Ever since we were little, we thought we knew it.
But that wasn't enough for Arnold. He wasn't interested in the appearance of intelligence. He wanted intelligence. He wanted to create consciousness. He saw it as a pyramid.
You don't need a winner. I don't have time to explain America to you. We've finished separating the soccer balls from the volleyballs, stretched the rope and set up the net. Aren't you going to do anything? It was assumed that those in charge of the fair would be able to help set it up.
Of course. I'll just... I'll just... step back here. - It's heavy. - Yeah. Can we put it down?
- Bugs. Amazing. Do you have a recipe for sweet potato pie? Good grief. Mom made it so often, she probably didn't write it down.
And I love Grandma's sweet potato pie. I love it too. I hope my version doesn't disappoint everyone. So far, it's not going very well. Are you smiling as you prepare it?
The evening is shaping up nicely. She was crawling on the floor. We had a muffin we didn't want... Turtles are aphrodisiacs. You wanted to eat the turtle? We could have lifted it from the sides...
He said, "Surely obliterated by my jeans." "You don't give them mints full of denim dye!" "Well, that'll make more for me." He pulls the mints out of his pocket and eats them. Five minutes later, I see him take the mint out of his mouth and put it back in his pocket.
- A blue-ringed octopus. - Yes. It has the same type of poison as a puffer fish. Blowfish are only poisonous if eaten... but this critter bites. So be careful not to touch it.
The night manager. We looked at the security camera footage. That's Wayne coming out of storage. The suitcase he's carrying could easily hold a woman. He carries it with one hand, effortlessly.
Sorry, I ran out of Kevlar. {\pos(192,220)}Damaging even the smallest portion of the machine's code {\pos(192,220)}in its current state of compression {\pos(192,220)}would result in the loss of terabits of data. {\pos(192,220)}Recoverable, irreparable. There's a battery back-up, but if this light flashes, it's a catastrophe. {\pos(192,220)}We've got to get back into the subway and try to stabilize it.
Then we'll find Shaw, and get the numbers back. We don't even know if the machine will be intact. It may be badly injured. We don't know. We'll fix it.
The battery is dead. There is no power. The backup battery may have a residual charge. If so, I've fried it. Come on, there must be a way to resuscitate it.
I brought you a TV. Careful, now. Shit, man. I just need to... We should put it here.
Oh, boy. A red dragon. It breathed fire. On me. It's the sunset hitting the northern mountain range and turning it red.
- We do? - We love him. He's more than a boss, he's a friend. Howard is a brilliant, charismatic man. He used to be fearless. He loved life and hates it.
Can I spoil that? You've been crying. I was watching a video of my daughter. She's dancing with her father. Can I show it to you?
We've been driving all day. Can I use the bathroom? Of course. It's upstairs. It's upstairs. You can't miss the first door.
- Fifty thousand? Come on out. - I'll have him erase the picture. - Nancy. - She could put it on the Internet.
- Nancy. - She could put it on the Internet. - Nancy, stop. Abel, that's her face. She could put it on the Internet, where everyone can see it.
They'll laugh if I order you hanged for insolence. But you're right. The work... and the risks you take in the forest... should be justly rewarded. You shall have your law. But only if you earn it through loyalty.
This Slean can call himself the happiest man in the shieldlands, to be able to marry my daughter. So why doesn't he come and get her himself? Slean had things to accomplish in Herot. It's not as if that was the only insult. Roth had to give his life to protect the dowry, and they refuse to show it...
We can have both. That's the first smart thing you've said. - I'll see you there. - I don't think so. If you want to keep that hand, keep it on a leash.
You don't even have a card. Where's your card? I don't need a map. I know where I am. You probably couldn't even read it.
Life doesn't work that way. The world doesn't work like that. Not everything is possible. I'm losing my business. They're taking it away from me.
There can only be one. I'll give you a short position that you won't bail me out. - You know Cross-Co.? - I don't see the short position. I don't want you to see it, I want you to take it.
No, a lot of fucking respect. Politeness on Axelrod. I speak first. I answer first at every press conference. And in the future, if I put you on a case, you take it as soon as possible.
Mom, you can't cry through the whole ceremony. I can't cry when I'm happy? Where's my damn handkerchief? Oh, darling. Let's get out of this dress before I get it dirty.
I wake up. I check my pockets. It's gone. The ring is completely gone. I can't find it.
Yes, we do. We both need zero matter. We can help each other. To understand it. To control it.
We both need zero matter. We can help each other. To understand it. To control it. You can't control it.
- What plan? To turn the gamma cannon into a bomb. When will the bomb explode? It's remote-controlled. Thompson will detonate it when he gets out.
What does that mean? If we're going to put an end to this once and for all, we have to open the rift, remove Whitney's Matter Zero, and send it back to where it came from. It's a tough job. We don't know anything about this rift. We were lucky to discover it in the first place. You're all cute.
What's going on? - The radio controller isn't responding. - Can you fix it? - I'm working on it. - The rift is becoming unstable. We need to close it before we lose control.
What about the gamma cannon? Reloading. There's another option, but it's best to avoid it. We could use the manual override. Then use it.
As your leader, I must tell you that your actions were unwise and imprudent. Mala... Imprudent?! You're absolutely right. By your own rules, you should have let me get sucked into the rift and shut up, period.
I think I'm going on tour. I'll call you later? Let me know what happens. I thought you were coming over later for Cadence. I found her pacifier in the car, and I knew she'd want it, so...
No, it wasn't. She was a handful. Don't get me wrong. But she was also passionate and... there was a lot of love around her. And if it's so important, that Glenn hears the truth, then you should let him hear it.
- About what? Raven, come on. You're not fooling anybody. I'm not trying to. If this machine was broken and you knew how to fix it, wouldn't you do it because it could be complicated?
381 people... 182 men... 173 women... 26 children. Two of whom were mine. Your president left us no choice. What's the matter, you don't like facing your demons? If you want mercy, you'll have to ask for it.
There are traitors among us. We are gathered here tonight, as we have been many times, to watch a man die. Vengeance is yours. I don't know if your death would bring me peace. But I don't deserve it.
You know, if you give me your little finger, I'll grab your whole hand. Can I try? - Of course you can. No. Hold it like this.
- OK. So now we're in trouble. - We've got to sell the weed. - OK, but to whom? We don't know any dealers. - We'll sell it ourselves.
What is it? Why do you need it? Do you need it for a scene? - No, there isn't. - Well, then... I can't keep it?
Why is that? Do you need it for a scene? - No, we don't. - Well, then... Can't I keep it? Let me wear it a little longer.
I'll give you a card trick, if you like. Would you care to choose a card? - Certainly, of course. - Please, go ahead. Take a look at it.
Would you like to choose a card? - Certainly, of course. - Go ahead. Look at it. Put it anywhere.
It's all in the mouth. A card folded in my esophagus, once, twice, three times. Is this your card? I don't know. Was I supposed to memorize it? Was I supposed to memorize it?
Don't you want to live? Be single, be happy... Do something with your life. Life's too short. Why waste it being someone's husband?
Kia Shopping... Entertainment... Emergency... Credit card... If you buy the house and want to keep it running...
For the people on the set, it's business as usual. Let's tell the assistant directors that Baird has a sprained ankle. What can we shoot without him? The inferno scene is this afternoon. Can you shoot it without him?
What kind of name is Thessaly? A name in which 20 million readers have faith. They want to know the truth, Eddie. The truth, yes. We'll give it to them.
Les Ailes de l'aigle? It's been a long time. Except for Baird and the director, it'll be a short list. Yeah. Get it for me.
But I was born under whips and chains. When I saw a chance to escape, I did. Now, this life here... It's not easy... But it's mine. And no one can take it away from me.
Around the corner. I beg your pardon? Luke 12:2. It means my tooth hurts like the devil himself is banging on it, whether you can see it or not. Pull it.
What do you mean, madame? You don't look like a dentist. Actually, I'm the dentist's assistant. And since extracting a tooth is a complicated procedure... Dentist, assistant, whatever you are, you're going to pull it, and you're going to pull it now.
Sing for me. Something beautiful. - Hold her leg so you don't break it. - Just the two of us. You can put it down.
Synchro by -robtor- Everybody shut up. I reserve the new video camera. No one takes it.
Let's see that hand, grandpa. I was a nurse. That's how I met Ronnie. What's your prognosis? Do you think you can save her?
- Got anything? - Negative, we're still looking. Hurry your ass up, Charlie. We gotta find that formula. We'll find it, we'll give it to those Nazis, and this nightmare will end.
Sorry, Max. Look, I'm just trying to figure a way out of this. Crap. He's right, we shouldn't give them the formula. But we'd have to find it first.
He's out of control! You were right. He's only in it for the money. You've got to get out of his mother's house, you're in danger. Meet me at Factor's Walk in 15 minutes. Take the tablet. We've got to get it somewhere safe before Max finds it.
I think I'll have coupons for a long time. I guess I can't ask you to stay here with me. What if I say no? It's a long way home. Remember Leave It To Beaver? If you're going to tell the perverse joke about it, it's okay, I already know it.
Once every 7 nights of sleep. And was the food hot? That's what made it good. 5km from the road and 13 from the forest edge, but was the food warm? Maybe he was carrying it in an insulated bag.
But where can we get it? - And can you get us some ammonium nitrate? - It's not the most obvious thing, but I've got contacts, I can make phone calls and keep Gerry in the loop. Assuming I do, what do you plan to do with the cesium powder? - We'll have some in due course. - No, I mean, how do you plan to handle it?
It's pretty essential if you don't feel indestructible like Superman. How are you going to risk billions every morning? But it's not working for you now. So you need to understand what part of your self-image is wrong. And then you either have to live up to it or lose it.
We need to increase the population of the City of Lights. The more minds on the job, the more powerful A.L.I.E. will be, and the closer we'll be to finding the second A.I. Only problem... when Abby stopped us, Pike confiscated our chip. So we've got to get it back.
Two minutes of downtime. Good start. We left two days ago. Why didn't they fix the door? Maybe because there's no one here to fix it.
But she's out there somewhere. I can promise you that. I hope she speaks my language. Looks like someone lost their drink! We should investigate and return it to its owner.
Tell you what. I was going to tell Howie and Russell to kick your ass, but for old time's sake, I'll let you go in one piece. You know what's funny? I didn't even know I had the map. But when I heard you were looking for it, I made sure I found it and put it in a safe place.
Give the team my location. I'm gonna need Clara. He speaks Creole. So, the islanders call him and tell him where the scrap metal is. He goes there, takes it and sells it for parts.
At your age, I paid someone to work in his company. Do you mind if I borrow your car? - What am I, Yuber? - No, it's Uber. I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
Don't make me come back. - What's up? - I'll take care of your service. - What about the car? - The Fusion. I'll fiddle with the odometer and park it in front of your place.
- What's up? - I'll take care of your service. - What about the car? - The Fusion. I'll fiddle with the odometer and park it in front of your place. But bring it by tomorrow night.
And I'll do the same, with or without you. So I refuse to have this conversation. I won't give you the pleasure. You've got to let it go. I can be part of your campaign or I can sink it.
- Very. I've given away all my correspondence. That doesn't prove anything. I'm trying to save the campaign. If I wanted to sabotage it, I'd let the president do it.
I have some calls to make. I'll come by your office. Get me LeAnn Harvey. Milkin will be with this man, Anton Khalski. He had the second-largest bank in Russia before Petrov seized it.
The salary would be more interesting, but we wanted to leave a mark. My father was very fond of Francis. But on the eve of my wedding, he said to me: "You only have one life, Claire. Do you want to spend it with this man?"
Mom can do it. If you're going to drive this thing like a maniac, I shouldn't come home and fix it for you. You'd like to drive like me. But you've got nothing to drive without that feeding valve I brought you. I can still take it back.
That his men could hunt. We brought him Daisy. Daisy? What? It was all blah, blah, blah the whole time. "Find someone with powers and kill them."
- Absolutely. All right, then. Let's go. The nucleo-nado is heading to Buffalo, New York, right now, where Astro-X informs us that they're going to use their technology to reverse Niagara Falls. The only way to prevent a nuclear meltdown is to cool it down. By doing so, it would neutralize the elements. and allow Astro-X's climate stabilization system to stop this sharknado once and for all.
Stop it. Stop it! Stop it. Stop it! Look, here's the dagger. I'll put it here.
"Paradise Lost. - Whitehall was right. - Whitehall was a blowhard. He was trying to pick our brains. Daddy... He'd switch his stone during ceremonies and smell the notch to make sure he never pulled it out of that bag.
They're on their way. Are you familiar with the ultra-high energy of cosmic rays, Captain? The radiation released inside the chamber will kill everyone but me. Despite your imperviousness to nuclear energy, you're vulnerable to bullets. I need someone to disconnect the base, so I can remove it safely and protect it.
Ah! -Peter! Are you hurt? Cries of pain. Drop the gun! Put it down slowly.
You're not listening to me. Macarena. Have you seen the video of Ángela's son? No. Go ahead, watch it.
You were wonderful, madame. - Mademoiselle. - Excuse me, miss. We're having a cultural evening and there's going to be music. But if it's too loud, I'll turn it down. Today you can turn it up as loud as you like.
She should never have given it to you. I'm the only one who can remove the bracelet. Believe in the bracelet! Ahaaah! You may believe in it, Harry Clayton, but you don't yet know how to control luck or sculpt it to your will.
- Please. And I'm going to save his life. Please give me the key! You're running out of time to save her, Harry. Put it in your mouth and pull the trigger!
Mr. Drake has guests as you know. But he needs to hear this. Frank, save your soles. They must be almost worn out, and new boots are expensive. If I weren't so sure you'd like it too much, I'd take this machine and stick it up your...
We haven't revealed any of this to the press, but ask him what it is. What is it, Captain? Bite marks, Reid... Flesh torn away with teeth. Clause 15 of the file... Read it.
Look what the Profaner has done. Beowulf killed our chief Kragen must be avenged. We must save this land Save it from the humans... who slaughtered our parents.
And the Atlas rocket can launch us into orbit. It ascends, leaving the capsule in an elliptical orbit. Earth's gravity continues to pull it along, but it spins so fast that it always misses the Earth. That's how it stays in orbit. Getting it back into orbit - that's the math we don't know.
The Earth's gravity continues to pull it along, but it spins so fast that it always misses the Earth. That's how it stays in orbit. Getting it back is the math we don't know. Yes, Katherine. The capsule will continue to orbit the Earth forever, because there's nothing to slow it down?
Getting her back, that's the math we don't know. Yes, Katherine. The capsule will continue to orbit the Earth forever, because there's nothing to slow it down? That's right. The challenge is to slow it down to precisely the right degree at precisely the right time.
I agree. Planck-Einstein. The problem is when the capsule in elliptical orbit goes into parabolic orbit. There's no mathematical formula for that. Because we can calculate the launch and landing, but without this conversion, the capsule remains in orbit, and we can't bring it back.
Give me the blanket. Give me the blanket. Give me the blanket. Why should I give you the cover? I shouldn't have given it to you.
Frank, what's going on here? This is Jorge Mendoza and his clan. Why are they in our garden? I rented it to them. If we let you take the house, will you rent it to us?
What, you don't believe me? No, I just don't want the house repossessed because we bought it with money from drugs or whatever. Let's not be hasty. This isn't about you, Frank. It was my house long before either of you could claim it.
Go out into those dark streets you know so well, those stinking alleys, those secret lanes, and find a bad man! An unfaithful husband, a cruel lover, a despot too rich, a scrofulous man, busy screwing a girl like you, and quick to use the back of his hand. Find him and bring me his right hand! Slice it off and press it, still bloody, against your breast!
An unfaithful husband, a cruel lover, a despot with too much money, a scrofulous man, busy screwing a girl like you, and quick to use the back of his hand. Find him and bring me his right hand! Slice it off and press it, still bloody, against your breast! Bring it back, throw it on this table, and we'll sing a happy song together!
Is it attached? - Yes, Doctor. He was biting, so... - Yes, yes, I know. Open it up.
I told you to use your hands. Not to knock on the door with them. This is all a bit new to me, so feel free to be more specific. Your hands can guide your voice. They can help you direct it to your target.
Throw the arrow. Do it, Marie Jeanne. Do it. Release the arrow. Release it, Marie-Jeanne.
Hey. Hi. I lost him. I don't smell it anymore. I'll help you find it.
I've got 800 years to find the balance. We need to help Mason now. I need my sword. It was forged with a single power. It takes a certain amount of power to repair it.
It's a famous painting, apparently, recently found in Markovia. The painting is on loan to the museum from the Silverberg family. Jacob Silverberg himself said, "The safe return of the painting means more to us "than all the gold in the world." It's like begging the Turtle to steal it. Right, yes.
You see that? Let go. Can you still see the map? No, it's gone. - Can you see it now?
My sources are looking for Marcel. They should be back soon. And yet, I find it hard to imagine that this turn of events will improve your chances. The game's not over. Once the Strix have found Marcel, they'll take the charter and hand it over to me.
I gave wedding rings to all my friends and got rid of the others. This is my city because I took it. That's what a leader does! If this prophecy you're all afraid of comes true, it will happen here, on my streets. And if we're going to stop it, stop it from killing us all, who'd be a better leader than me?
That's what you heard, but we heard Ezra kick us out of his house. Girls. Every policeman takes this case not just seriously, but personally. Without going into details that would hurt the investigation, I can tell you that we're narrowing down our list of suspects. We know what the murder weapon was and we'll find it.
Polls show a 12% gain. I'm more convincing than I thought. Hail the conqueror. Do you have that label on your old suitcase? Gil says you need it for...
- I talked to him about it. Because he loves to fix things. Why do you think I broke it? When did you notice it was broken? When I took it out of the cab at the Philly airport.
Here... where you grew up. What was drawing? My mother was alone so I thought it would be nice to be near her. Well, that's fine. Would you like to have a cup of coffee here and drink it along the street?
Whoever it was, they want to find out. How do you know that? They may have found the weapon. They what? They threatened to kill me to get it back.
Why do you want me to write with you? It would be huge for me and it's not that I think my work is bad... I have to ask because, you know... Nicole's voice was... carried away. And I want it back.
That's right. Please inform the board. I just wanted to stop by, see how you're doing. Well, I think the answer to that question is pretty obvious. Thea's bloodlust balances an equation, she was given life, now she has to take it.
My father once told me about an elixir called Lotus, capable of countering the effects of the Lazarus Pit. A secret weapon made by the League's enemies. Have you got it? Yes. And I'll give it to you on one condition.
Don't move! Don't move! Where's my idol? It's none of your business. She's close by. I can smell her.
Now give me the damn... That was embarrassing. I have a tumor on my L4 vertebra. This little thing has wrapped itself around my spinal cord. The only way to cut it out involves an operation that will leave me paralyzed below the waist.
Thank God, Taiana, wake up. It's okay, everything's fine. Reiter, he's gone! He must be in the tunnels looking for his idol. We can't let him find it.
Khushu is an ancient Arabic term for humility, needless to say, it's something I wouldn't associate with you. When the first Homo Magi forged these idols, they did so in the image of the creatures whose powers they wished to channel, so attention to detail is essential. One piece is missing. The Ribalvei stone. They must have hidden it here somewhere.
When the first Homo Magi forged these idols, they did so in the image of the creatures whose powers they wished to channel, so attention to detail is essential. One piece is missing. The Ribalvei stone. They must have hidden it here somewhere. Find it, or Genesis won't be what you and your daughter have to fear.
We can't give up hope. We can't give up hope. You have. I can see it in your eyes. I can't believe I thought I could be the one to unite this town while Damien Darhk tried to destroy it.
Someone has to bring a little optimism. Nobody here seems to have the strength to do that. Then you know we've lost the town. No. I know you're running out of time to get it back.
Get out of this town! "Get out." This heart-warming vision could mean so much more if I hadn't seen you all tearing yourselves and your town apart. That's why I did it. Humanity is incapable, and I wanted to purge it, of these millennia of rot it's been infected with, and I will!
Why'd you do it? I had it. No, you didn't. An explosive charge. He was going to blow the oxygen tank no matter what you told him. Can you deactivate it?
You've misunderstood, the jumper isn't Tom. - He's me. - What's that? That's right. Tom was trying to talk me out of it. If there's an interview to be done, I'll only give it to Tom Tucker.
Very good. Very good. You grunt like a Hungarian lesbian. Thank you, Dimitri. Your testicle's hanging out of your shorts. I'll freshen it up.
Yeah, but what difference does it make? It's the law. There's nothing we can do about it. We'll see about that. I bet if we work together, we can find a way to change it back.
Maybe at first, when she took the stick. Oh, yeah? Well, I don't care. Okay? I'm the bren'in. Foster, we don't demand trust. We earn it.
You can talk. It's a side effect of the changing weather. Why, because you saved me? You've just been given a second chance. Try not to waste it.
He's the Witness, the guy behind the apocalypse, the anomalies. If he's here, we've got to find him. This guy... he's jerking off in his basement and thinking about amputating limbs. - You want to trust him? - If there's a chance we can find the Witness, I've got to take it.
- Your car's backing up. Ah, okay, so... that lady's probably taking it to the car wash, you know? - See you soon? - See you. Be quiet and wax it.
- What if he's immortal? What then? The antitoxin might be the only chance of bringing Daisy back. She could go into cardiac arrest or convulsive shock. Let's test it.
Let's test it. Where can we find a willing Inhuman? Those who don't hide are infected and want us dead. I'll do it. Test it on me.
It killed Ward, and got us into this mess. We're running out of time, we need to figure this out. - Understood, sir. - Good. I'm sending a team over there. I'll send a team out there, and you and May will lead them.
In the dark depths, she was a ray of hope. Do you know why I stay on guard, why I stay hidden here, while the others live in the light? Once, and only once, did the gods all work together. We took all the Evil of this world, and hid it elsewhere in this Pandora box. And the duty of guarding it fell to me.
"The villagers had recently suffered a terrible disaster, "an attack by an evil creature. "A creature they call... the Verslinder." "The creature made a massacre "before the Dutch could capture it.
I have no idea. Come on, Pandora's not far behind. We can't lose her. She's psychically linked to that thing. Find a way to protect her or...
Anyway, we got Michael for money laundering through his private security company. - We had enough to put him away for 20 years. - You offered him a deal. He'd testify against Arthur in the murder of a Kevin Willkie, a little snitch in his own right. He put his hand in the till, and Arthur cut it off with a machete.
He wanted more from them, and he wanted a superior. Then, less than a week later... he was dead. Do you think Brian McDade was the source of the leak? I can't say. On the other hand, if there was a leak, they would have buried it instead of trying to stop it.
There's a beautiful bouquet on the way. Can you help me explain to your roommate - how the business works? - I already know. I have an idea, and a company wants it.
Can you help me explain to your roommate - how the business works? - I already know. I have an idea, and a company wants it. Another company might want it too.
And he withheld this information? Not officially. With the launch getting closer, I started trolling black market sites for anything resembling THRUsight, and found a listing on the Tor site dedicated to the sale of illegal weapons. If this is true, why didn't you tell the authorities? Because a gun is a gun no matter who owns it.
That's right. Counterfeit money. Which they won't use. Counterfeiters never use their currency. Will they try to sell it?
You're old enough to understand. She's crazy, Norman. She always has been. No, you're not here, you're not here. It's... is part of the disease and... and I have to control it, you have to go.
You must delve into your past, Sarah. All of it. Find out what your parents were doing 30 years ago. Find out what's buried in that house. Nobody lights a lamp and puts it in the cellar so that those who enter can "see the light".
Yes, but the water's cold, there are fish, and I'm delicate. I just don't understand why you need such a powerful crate. Exactly, Corey. I don't. I want it.
If I take it, my family stays together. So which one's your favorite? The general. He's got a gun too. You just have to put it on him.
We can't let them through. We go out once a week to clean bodies. Are you all right? He had a pickaxe. He was swinging it like...
I just wanted you to know. To know what? That I liked your homily. That... is not enough. Because it's not enough to like it. You have to perceive it.
And, uh... I'd like to try to do something... different with my life. Something better. So you're giving up the farm? I was only renting it, so...
He... he sent for the Quinjet by remote control, didn't he? -Then he probably... -Set coordinates for space The Quinjet will disconnect from the Zephyr and fly away to leave the atmosphere If we can steal the warhead and load it into a Quinjet or something...
Don't dawdle. As soon as I closed up store, I bought my own cab. - Let's take a leaf out of his book! - Yeah, take the piss. The fact remains that I'm working hard and I've put my license up for sale. - You haven't started paying for it.
But we believe we bring you the truth. Truth is universal. It's true for every country, in every age. That's why it's called truth. If a doctrine were less true here in Japan than it is in Portugal, we couldn't call it truth.
- You weren't supposed to do that. - Weren't you? I don't mind. Since we're breaking the rules, I have a video of your man. - No, you don't. - But I want to see it!
We have to be ready. No, it won't come to that. What's the big deal? What was the point of doing that? The people demanded justice for what Geronimo did, and we gave it to them.
(Strings creaking) You see, there's an anchor lock my brothers inside. Something representational. That's why they can't get out. (Sighs) But I'm going to bust into that little mental prison and break it inside.
I guess that's the thing about old vampires. They don't pay attention to modern things, unlike your friend here, who excels at computers and wrote an article about the Dark Web. Sum it up for me, Zuckerberg. I came across some rumors online. Turns out someone claims to have the ball and is selling it to the highest bidder.
Mini-glasses, free of charge. We seem to have a problem with both good and bad news. Marcel, I simply don't have time for this. I have an offer on the ball. Whoever finds it sells it to the highest bidder.
It's strange the way you talk about the two of us, as if - we were different. - We are different! You see, I still have a chance to be a little happy. And I'm going to take it.
It's worse than I remember. The rage. The hunger. I'd like to blame Finn for my anger, but it's gotten worse and worse since I came back. I never learned how to keep it normal.
Good. That's exactly what I want. That's exactly what I want. The only question is... Are you gonna be alive when they get here? Your doorbell's broken downstairs. I forgot to ask the landlord to fix it.
Kol is linked to this candle, so whatever these two lovebirds say to each other, our witches will be able to hear. I don't think a few extra minutes of intimacy is too much to ask. I couldn't care less about your teenage love. They have a task. They have to finish it.
It was brilliant. And I want you to do it again. But this time, you'll be the thing they're afraid of. New Orleans is our home, Marcel. And it's time we took it back.
It may be a little salty, but it looks pretty good. The kids thought it was bad... Since when do you drink beer? It's Breece's. I didn't think it was right to throw it away.
Thank you for your time. Humans... see evolution in terms of progress and advancements. This latest task will be the catalyst that precipitates a new era on Earth, like the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs and heralded the Ice Age. I'm honored, sir... and humbled. Once at the docks, you'll take the briefcase and place it exactly where I've indicated on the map.
My mother. She would have loved him. Norman, I don't think we ever really lose the ones we love. I don't think so either. I'm sure she'll see it.
When he wakes up. - I'll get it. - I'll get it. Jace, what happened to you? Maybe Luke's car found its way into a pole while I was hiding it.
Clary won't be happy if I let you die. I'm running out of magic. What'll I do? I can't leave it, but the potion still needs Komodo shell. Find it, add the rest when they arrive.
I've run out of magic. What'll I do? I can't leave it, but the potion still needs Komodo shell. Find it, add the rest when they get here. You'll have to feed it to Luke.
I haven't spoken to him in two years. I'm curious. What does he want from me? He didn't tell me much. He asked me to give you this letter. And he said it was very urgent. I'll read it and get back to him.
It could backfire. If you ask me, you need to put Kevin in a position to confirm any accusations the police might make about someone else. You want Kevin to come forward. I don't want Kevin to go to jail. If he has to make a statement, let him.
Alec, this has gone too far. We don't have a choice. And neither do we. Let me get this straight. You need Alec's stele to open the safe, and you want me to steal it from him?
Where? Right there. Are you sure it's still there? Yes. We tried to lower it.
You seem overweight. Yes, well, you seemed bulimic. What's on your mind? I, um... I found this picture of you and I wanted to show it to you.
This girl? No, I don't remember. Just a girl. Yes, all right. But if you leave it with me, I could try and find out more if you like.
Okay, here's the strategy. Frank has to tell his story. Make the connection between the colonel and the neurologist. There's no need to prove that Frank's version is real. Just convince the jury that he believes it and relives it every day.
If Nick is covering for someone, then the real murderer is still out there. There are plenty of murderers out there, Detective. You heard the man. He deserves the punishment. At least he's getting it.
How did you get into Nick's holding cell? By asking politely, of course. Which you should try sometimes. This case has nothing to do with you. Why don't you let her go?
Putting my wings in the band as shoddy paraphernalia. All right, then. You can take solace in knowing that the auction will be raided tonight. So the FBI is going to seize my wings? When we get a chance to catch bad guys, we take it.
I wonder how many of your dear humans I have to kill to reach such a rank. And yet, you call me a menace. When I was little, my father used to take me and my sister to the movies. I saw a poster for a film called "The Day the Earth Stood Still". It was about an alien, like you, who had come to Earth and threatened to destroy it if mankind didn't change its ways.
James, are you still there? Astra confessed to No. We're regrouping to get Hank out of there. Astra would never betray her soldiers or her husband. If there's a chance to save Hank, I've got to take it.
Your presence is no longer required. Thank my agents for completing your mission. Their idealism will doom this planet. No. It's what's going to save it.
I can't hear you, I'm coming. What an idiot! For what we said about Richie, write the letter. To fire him? I'm not giving it to him.
- With Jorge, we're skimming the clubs. - Who does? Who? Why, if we were letting them go? Their song, Kill the Lights, is great. We've got to get it out there.
- Show Keating out. - I know where the damn door is. "Procedure." I'll tell you what he can do with his fucking procedure. Stick it up his ass, that's what he can do with it.
Reggie turned the other way. Was it a mistake? Or did you think he didn't deserve to die just like your sister? The whole thing pissed him off so much I thought he might even kill himself. I put the rope in the stable, but he just stared at it.
I told everyone how it should go. Thanks, Mike. We're almost ready. Buzz, can you transfer that video of Sherry Hickman to the big screen in Mike's office - so the witness can see it.
No. But Tamika's baby was... You have to understand. I didn't think she'd have her son in the car at this hour. When I realized I'd given her the wrong heroin, I had to get it back.
I love being a comedian. It's the best job in the world. And I love being a comedian from Los Angeles. Alfred the Assassin. My role is to live my life and tell it to others.
I'm interviewing to be a bank clerk. You'll be that much more memorable. To stand out from the crowd, send a thank-you card after the interview. It's more personal than an e-mail. But write it in advance and mail it as you leave.
You're safe now. I just want to go over the details. We'll just talk about the details. A school in Camden, New Jersey, was on a trip to your workplace, and two young girls came up to you. One of them took your hand and put it under her sweater, on her chest. The second did the same, and they ran off laughing with their friends.
No. It's a waste of time. We don't do that. Rule number 26. Read it out loud, please.
They're not your friends. The entire prison has been compromised. Compromised. She has an earpiece. You can see her.
Take my identity card. If I get arrested, I'll use a fake name. Your name won't be a problem, half the family's seen you. We'll wait until they leave in the morning. The woman will leave the briefcase and we'll go get it.
- But you can pay me. - Pay you? I'll take your ration card. That's what they asked for. I could just give it to them. Now you can just give it to me.
Good. We've got to work fast. Tommy's life depends on it. "That I pray, not to be preserved from dangers, "but to face them. "And may I not ask for relief from my suffering, but for the heart I need to overcome it."
And where? How are you going to make a living? - I got the house. - Are you moving back to Venice? I can sell it.
I know you can't wait to get started. With each passing day, our task becomes more difficult. The master builds an army. I'll be careful. I made that mistake once and I won't make it again.
We'll find them tonight. What's the matter? Didn't Minow lead you to the cargo? He did better than that. He led us right to the factory where they kept it.
These factories represent nothing if we stop the Master. You say the cargo - is at the Tremont factory? - It was there. They left before we could get it back.
But I'll give you this. Ten thousand dollars. Travel. See the world while you can. Life's too short to spend it stuck in an office.
20 more blocks. - Where to? - The old sewers. The silver powder... how do we disperse it?
I suppose there's a small chance. I know it's not what you want to hear, but... A small chance is better than none. And if I can have this opportunity... You should take it.
We've crushed the Strigoi's WiFi. These monsters are no longer connected. They're too stupid to hide or coordinate their attacks. Like animals. They see food, they want it.
These are mustard seeds. Mustard is made from these. No, mustard is yellow. You get it in stadiums. You put it in a hot dog. It's yellow.
An experimental treatment for my cancer. He's staying home so no one will know. I should have told you. It's working already. There's a light in you, I can see it.
His band played at the ball. Garret's a drummer. Can he stay for dinner? Please go home. Don't open a door unless you're ready to walk through it.
I earned that money. And no Pritchard, living or dead, is going to take that away from me. Who are you, really? You tell me. Don't open a door unless you're ready to walk through it.
-If I get close enough, I can memorize the settings, the marks on the machine, -how it works. -Then it's true. The Germans have an encryption machine that's impossible to decode. And you'll come out with a chance to decode it.
- What's it like down there? - I'm testing your contacts. How's that supposed to work? Theoretically, the Connaver device has been on Arkyn, so it absorbed radiation. Beta radiation is invisible to the eye, but these sensass lenses will translate it into a visible signal.
Stanley didn't want to answer my questions. He was pretty scared. When a hitman's scared, you know something's wrong. Do you have the meta-human's identity? Yeah, I'm running it through 5 different facial recognition systems right now. It should take a minute.
Let's go. Marv... listen. I felt bad about us getting off to such a bad start, so I had your watch fixed. Check it out. I was gonna drop it off at the office tomorrow.
Mr. Eastman. Advanced mathematics. My father was to a lot of people. He was so proud of his watch. He wore it all the time.
In the previous cases, the bodies were all found within a three-kilometer radius of the abduction site. A radius close to the souk isn't exactly a comfort zone, but the hospital is in it. Between the hospital and the souk, where would you get rid of a $6,000 watch? In a jewelry store? The jewelry store owner said a kid came by and sold it to him this afternoon.
- Norman! Calm down or we'll blow you away. Hey, get your hands off me! I'm just looking for my friend! Shut your mouth now or I'll shut it for you.
What are you doing here? I was looking for a drugstore. Can I help you? I needed a prescription. Requesting one by text isn't really possible, so...
High up, it's the safest place in a storm, except for Bitscan, of course. Got room for one more in there? No one's allowed in. I made the rule. They won't let me break it.
It's not my real name, it's the one I use for my job. I'll tell you what happened to me. I'm not sure why. Like a session with a shrink, let's say. Even though I'm someone who's never really liked talking. I'll put it all in this video, and then I'll send it to my lawyer in Miami, who'll put it aside in case one day, after my death, someone wants to know what really happened to Frank Kitchen.
I love you, baby. But you're gonna buy me a real ring. You're going to have a diamond the size of a grape. We can go tomorrow. We'll choose it together.
But, once again, I managed to save the day. Have you? My efforts persuaded Mr. Gradgrind to put you in the next phase of the recruitment process. Your reputation is at stake. Spoil it this time, and I won't save it...
Ha! So close, yet so far from the goal. We've lost her... again. We've just been informed that the last stone has been targeted. Unfortunately, it's not you who'll have to find it.
But not too much. Tell me before tomorrow night. I will. Apparently, my phone is south of Tijuana. Your cell phone's probably already been resold, and your car's license plate's already been changed, but we'll do everything we can to get it back.
"My dear Frankie, I've been told that these brushes were the ones Picasso used to paint Guernica. If that turns out not to be true, just know that I had a ball sleeping with two Spaniards to get them. It's the postcard that counts, anyway." My goodness! LOTUS GALLERY WORKS BY FRANKIE B. "I've rented this gallery, so all you have to do is fill it.
When I was in Afghanistan, I lost a lot of friends. So losing Jay, I know how you feel. Questioning yourself. Blaming yourself for his death. And that guilt, it can destroy you, but believe me, you have to control it, or it will tear you apart from the inside.
When I started out, I was a man of science. I believed that truth could only be revealed through experimentation and proof. I no longer believe that. Now I wake up in a cold sweat, convinced that a deeper truth has appeared in my dream. If only I could hold it before it fades away.
One second, please. I swear to God, if you... Threats again? I didn't tell you to come to my house this morning, but you did. You promised me the truth, or that you'd try to find it, but absolutely not that.
Why would I risk everything I have for this? It won't bring them back. - It won't save lives. - No, it won't. But our friends died looking for the truth, and you're just a few keystrokes away from revealing it.
The lady and I have a special date. Have fun, Miss Katie. Thank you, Thomas. What are you up to? Take your blanket and put it against the window.
What do you mean, you don't have the money? I was going to sell a nuclear warhead and pay you out of the profits. - Well, things have changed. - Did you want me to give the meteorite away for free? No, I was hoping to take it by force.
Is he afraid they'll send him to the chair? That's not going to happen. California no longer has the death penalty. Oh, thank God. They can bring it back for a celebrity like Peri.
He can walk. How long have you both lived here? Almost a year. Hard to believe given the poor state the house was in when we bought it. So you moved in to help him renovate it!
It's just a little scratch. Jesus Christ! This car is worth more than your life. Mr. Powell will kill you. But we can fix it, right?
Thanks for your time. But do you really think prison is the best place for kids? Hey, listen to me. I've been here a while. You have a chance to hug your family, take it.
It was there. It was there. Even then. On my first night in the house. Death. But I don't see it.
- I have to look for dung beetles on my own. - That's not surprising, is it? - These dung beetles are made of dung. - No, they eat it. They cut the dung, then they push it... and finally, they bury it.
You don't know him, you don't even know his name. I'm sorry, sir. It's another Kostis. She's buried in the valley cemetery. And Kostis cleans her grave and visits her all the time.
Very painful. What are you getting at? Reverb had the ability, in a way, to manipulate this multi-dimensional energy. - What's your point, Allen? - My point is... If his powers are linked to the energy that connects the multiverse... If he can manipulate it...
I know what I said. But you're not going to stop, are you? So I'm going to do everything I can to make sure you don't get killed. I've recalibrated them to the electromagnetic frequency of this Earth. That should help you access and manipulate transdimensional energy.
- Let's get on with it. Let's get this over with. This thing is what allowed me to steal Flash's speed in the first place. All he has to do is run, and his speedy strength will be transferred to this vial. but only as long as I calibrate it.
No. We have to help him. The cops are on their way. Give me the gun. I'll put it in the pool like you said.
It's true. It's true. The first thing on a long list of things you can't do anymore. I should have told you. I just thought something bad would happen. So why bother with the new one if I was going to take it back later?
Monsieur. Perfect. The president assumes his graft. Good for him. Why hide it?
- MATILDA: You're nervous. - REID: No, not at all. This research I'm starting in Whitechapel - you disapprove of it.
Energy. I found this chocolate bar in the sound department. It seems to me that the guy is rather greedy, and has a serious addiction to porn. We can cut it up and share it. Is it real, or just another fake? Have you been hiding it from us? Were you? No. I've been saving it to share with you.
What's up? No. I was saving it to share with you. I'll give you $50. - I'll kiss you. - I'll kiss you. We can all have it. You just have to cut it into little pieces.
I'll give you $50. - I'll kiss you. - I'll kiss you. We can all have it. We just have to cut it into little pieces. - Give it to me.
Wally and Jessy are fine. They're fine. Thank you. So that's what it takes to get Barry's speed back. It's not easy, but it's almost done. I've already told you, once Barry's made his decision, it's impossible to change it.
- Cameras and all. Do you shoot for newspapers or magazines? For magazines, yes. And websites. How does it work? Do you first take the picture and then sell it, or...
Senator. I'm honored, Mr. President. I have only one reservation. Between you and me, I don't even know if this law will pass. If I have to support it, you can imagine...
Give me more. Tell me what people want. People didn't want jazz until they heard it. I can make them love music. But I can't make them like it.
I want my life back. I'm the one Jingim married. This is my baby. You found a way to take it from me. Find a way to give it back.
A rare combination. When you think about it, he's everything you wanted me to be. Go out with him. He was my date, but you're the one with the crush. Okay, play it cool, but if he hands you a hook, grab it.
I buy this phone? You advise her. What to wear? You suggest. Her car breaks down. You fix it.
So where's the car? This is crazy. We can't really remember because we were pretty drunk. We had a good time. Would you like us to find it?
After that. All right, then. How do we get past that? Leave your car there. I'll watch it for you.
I am the regent, and my mind is made up. The Duke arrives tomorrow. The wedding will take place quickly, pending a meeting. A meeting? I'll take it gladly, and I'll send that duke running for the hills, I promise!
I'm sorry about that. Get some sleep, miss. - Good night, miss. - Lock the door. I should leave it open with a sign.
And a new low for humanity. Wait a minute. He had that camera with him when he was arrested? It's in the register. Should I get it?
God entrusted him to me. I raised him. Nothing can stop me. Let go of me! If I let go of your hand I'll never take it back.
You have to talk to her. She listens to you. Tell her to give up this quarrel. She mustn't give up. She's got to finish it.
How long have you been trying to get it? Because it only took me a day. And it only took you an hour to lose it. When I get my revenge, it'll be my victory. You won't be there to steal it from me.
It's true enough to make it the top paranormal show. And there's no gooey paste. Does it look like it? You've come all this way, let me give you a picture. Go show it off to your family and friends.
- I've got it. - I got it. All right, great. What's the plan? If they can't renovate the house, they can't sell it.
You're no better than Valentin. But he had the courage to tell the Downworlders that he wanted them all dead. You... you hide behind the law. I'm not hiding behind the law, Isabelle. I'm simply following it.
We're airborne. The energy is very low. He was asleep for a long time. So have I. Let's see if we can wake it up.
"And the moon gave off a magical glow as if they were dancing on the Milky Way." - Mom. - Yes? You have a voice. So use it.
You've come a long way, Lotus. The Wudang Crane. The sutras and secrets you've guarded have survived the Mongol flame. I won't let you waste your life. So you must take it from me.
Asmodeus is the last one. She's from uptown, but rush hour, you know. You're welcome. I see you've met. Obviously, I didn't realize you had a history, and I don't want to deny it, but we're running out of time, and we need you both.
You can't kick me out of my own room. "Beware the fury of a patient man." Have you ever heard that phrase? I don't know it, no. My dear old dad used to say it to me when I was a kid.
He sold you out without the slightest hesitation. Can't you see that? If you don't speak now, you'll be hanged! I hope you're not trying to take a look at the dress? It's not bad luck if you accidentally see it, is it?
I told Naz I'd stop by, see if you had any leads on the gang of damaged bills. Yeah, I got something. So my theory is that whoever pulled off the heist planted the bacteria, right? And since the financial district was the first to lose power, particularly the Chambers Street block, we can assume that's where the bacteria was first introduced. Now, as to who did it, there are only 12 people in the New York area with enough scientific knowledge to not only make the bacterium, but also successfully release it.
: Okay, money transfer. Do the thing. I understand there's a penalty for changing flights. I'll pay it, I just...
the Lord takes vengeance on his adversaries, and holds a grudge against his enemies." It's not about inhibiting your emotions, Alan. Cry for them. Pray for them. And let it increase and strengthen your faith, rather than diminish it.
We... really messed up out there. I'm really glad I could help. I don't want to be... greedy about it, because I tried on the most perfect dress today, and I should wait... - Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - I really want to wear it again.
I'm really glad I could help. I don't want to be... greedy about this, because I tried on the most perfect dress today, and I should wait... - Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - I really want to put it back on. - You should put it back on.
- I really want to put it back. - You should put it back. - I know I should! Okay, I'll try it. Try it again.
I thought I'd pay you a visit. Come over here. Give us a hug. My favorite crown. I'll get it back.
The scan and X-ray show that it's not near any major vessels. So we'll give you antibiotics for the infection. Other than that, you're good to go. What about the bullet? Given its location, there's no medical reason to remove it.
- that will break this pattern. - Holy shit! - You're going to break that pattern. - Now! Most people are so busy surviving and making a living that they forget to shape it. If we don't shape it, like we're doing here, we miss a lot.
Be in the moment, as if you were there. See what you see, feel what you feel, enjoy... Feel the blessing of that moment. What a blessing it was in your life and how grateful you are. Soak up the gratitude of that moment. Feel it.
- It's up to you to imagine. Something that makes them say: It's worth talking to the Syrians. I don't know if you can find such a luxury product. If my son has made a mistake, I want to try and fix it.
Better now than when you were alive, isn't it? I don't think there's anything here. There's something you can't see. Like the cards on the keys. The cross was in front of us, but we couldn't see it until we started thinking differently.
We have to get the phone back to him. He must not suspect that it was out of his attention. When he wakes up, he'll call someone. Who could lead us to the cell phone of the Black Claw who set this up. Make a copy of the SIM card and put it back.
I'll be there for her if you're not. Everyone knows we're gonna die, but you never believe it. I don't. Why do we joke about death? Maybe it's the only way we can bear it.
He has just declared an official period of mourning. But within 3 days, believe me, the Ukrainians will have to pay for their treason. General, I... I understand your indignation. And I share it.
Did you see what just happened, what I just did? You're just... [Your best bet... is to get up, grab that ax, and plunge it into my skull.
In an underground prison. I escaped through the tunnels. They let me out in a cave somewhere in the forest, and... then you found me. Where's the cave? Can you find it?
His teeth can shatter your bones with a snap of his jaw. And his eyes... they burn away your soul and finish you off. Nothing can defeat this monster. That's just not true. And I know exactly what this beast is... and how to defeat it.
Is it alive? Oh, yes, it is. And when you broke it, Henry, and sent it down here to Hell, its purpose was not fulfilled. That sums up unfinished business. And now you're going to find it here with my help.
Yes, but you're supposed to get the call before the letter. Can he change his mind? No, it's to talk about the decision. I know the decision. I have the letter. Shall I read it to you?
Then it's over. What are we supposed to do? Send the bastard a message and hope he gets it. He bought me a red plaid shirt. He liked me to wear it.
Unstable, hasty, misspellings and completely focused on Ivy. Which makes me think... Phoebe is expendable. Have our man draft a response. I want it as soon as possible.
Bombay! For me it will always be Bombay! Not cool, bro. Give me your jacket. No, please, you can't take it.
I'm sorry, he can't help you. Are you at the office? It's Thursday. I'm watching my show. Record it, you have to help me.
If you had been our lawyer from the start, he wouldn't have been convicted at all. Thank you, Gloria. That'll be all, Your Honor. Mrs. Danner, I happen to know your son's case. And to the best of my knowledge, to reopen it,
Your protection is useless. After the election, it will be a formality. We know where the child is. Settle it today. We'll get to her through her money, via Diaz's war chest. Too bad for the senator from Missouri, because we'll steal it and he'll lose the election.
Rana? The van's not in the parking lot. I took it out this morning. Why did you do that? I got tired of having to move it.
- Right where you left it. How are you? I'm glad you're here! Make yourself at home. - Don't go looking for it.
They locked your sister and me in the cellar. They were here. They dragged us down here, and forced us to watch this creepy video. What video? I didn't want to see it again, but I went back down with him anyway because I wasn't going to stay alone in that house.
Kirsten, get ready. We're going to set fire to every synapse left in Ed's house. Can Kirsten's mind handle it? The new suit is made to protect you. It's made of solid stuff, like the person who wears it.
Stuff about his son. He even brought an official letter of apology with it. Why did he give it to you? He said it was so we'd know he was honoring the restraining order. I was going to give it to Dr. Silverman this Friday.
Lots of men. You can have all kinds of male meetings. It's really fun. New York doesn't have the death penalty. I think you just inspired us to put it back.
That hurt. I'm not gonna lie. It's the story of a nerdy teacher who learns he has terminal cancer. He starts making meth to earn money for his family. Except he dyes it blue.
How serious are her injuries? She has a few deep cuts, caused by metal or glass. We vaccinated her against tetanus as a precaution. What does this image mean? Do you recognize it?
Caleb, a "reliable guy." If only they knew. No, they don't. Caleb is a monster, but what we learned today is that he's a monster dying to do good. So we've been looking for his weakness. And we just found it.
She made me who I am. Okay, we don't have a way out. But we didn't before either. My magic works now So, let's separate this heart. That way, when we find a way out, we can get through it.
That's what you get when a series is youth-oriented, with teenagers running around screaming, in a school where things made of wood and poorly constructed can be found anywhere but in craft class. It should remember the emotional truth of the character. That's the basis of acting. Look for the truth. Tell me more about that truth and how to find it.
We're all Negan. What you want is impossible. But all is not lost. Just go home. Burn that car. Sink it in a lake so it disappears.
Who did this to you? It doesn't matter who did it. It's done. You can't walk around with that horror. I probably deserve it.
Fortunately, our husbands support us. Honey! Do you know where my blue floral shirt is? In the dry-cleaning pile. I wanted to wear it to lunch at the club today.
The principal is a bad sport. He pinches my arm when no one's looking. Pinch, pinch! It's not a foul if the referee doesn't call it. I've got a slice so big I've got to fold it in half.
Cattleman's Ranch is our livelihood. So you can understand our concern when we came across your son's site. I do. I'm sorry about Phillip's review. That's just great. Are you going to delete it?
Anything you'd like to share with the class? "The real me"? It's a tape. Impossible to know... Play it through the device we used to study the Doppler effect.
- It matters! - Yeah, it does. But... (sighs) You look like the birthday bitch in that dress. - You have to wear it.
I think you followed him, and when he was bleeding you took his gun to make him look innocent. and because of that, a good cop is going down - For something he didn't do. - You really are unbelievable. If you have that gun, you have to give it back right away.
Think what you will of him. He's the fuel that runs this big, beautiful machine and that fuel is made of one thing... you. That's what the bigwigs in Washington like to call The American Way See you next week. And remember, enjoy your freedom or lose it.
Which one? The one with the red cap. Just bean paste. Here. Bring it here.
- James. - When you see David, tell him there's a new sheriff in town. The power of the Author is far greater than that old man wanted you to believe. And when you broke the feather, you sent it here, to the Underworld. And now you're going to get it back.
Here, the rules are a little more... flexible. I saw no reason to tempt you. Your current dilemma is the reason. I'm not looking for the feather for Cruella. I'm looking for it for me.
And now you're going to pay. Guys! Guys! You can take them off now. It's time for the plank. I'll cross it with joy.
How do you make it clear that it's not about Family Banter? What if, in the 1st scene, we showed my character casting a bronze on a VHS of Family Banter? What's that? That's crazy. Okay, I'll put it on. I'll put it in, but we can always take it out later.
What the... Right. Engines are cooled by seawater. Without water, they overheat. The water inlet's clogged. Unclog it and let's get out of here.
That's right, boys. This is our sales team. The best in the business. Sales? Shouldn't we build the platform before hiring people to sell it?
Absolutely, I was there. It's still Don. Sorry for the misunderstanding. Our entire plan has always been built on a freemium model like Dropbox. The platform is accessible for free. When we get enough users, we sell premium services to businesses. If we make it accessible and wait for sales, why are we here now?
Can I borrow it for a bit? Just a minute. - Do you have a gold chain? - Yes, I do. It's been a while. I wear it from time to time.
You want an animal? Well, let's say a box turtle. How's that? You're not taking this seriously. In fact, I don't give a shit about the design of this box. If I could, I wouldn't. So there you go.
- That's a bit inappropriate. Driver, you're making me uncomfortable. What the hell are you doing, Todd? Did some shady driver ever give you his number or say you reminded him of his dead ex? Or repeated your address slowly, as if to memorize it?
Actually, she's nice. Too bad Richard's gonna screw it up. So you moved the pool? It was too far from the house, which was crazy. A box came and moved it closer.
We're not coming out of beta. We integrated the neural network a week ago. The platform is full of bugs. But that's what a beta is for. We give it to people in the real world, they use it, and that's how we find the bugs.
- Thank you, Arthur. Arthur, listen to me, listen to me carefully, there are people who call me 40 times a day to find out where their money is. I've even thought of selling my house to pay them. So you're going to go into your little fucking piggy bank right now and pay back every fucking kopeck (Russian cent) you stole from Big Head, and if you don't, we're going to hang our little business and maybe show it to someone we call the "prosecutor."
So we're going downhill because we're too good? That's one way of looking at it. Our product is so innovative that it's hard for people to get a clear picture of it. So all we have to do is change the platform. Simplify it.
- Heart attack. - Heart attack? He looks to be 26 and in top form. He has an incredible body. The chances of a male under 30 having a heart attack are 1 in 780,000, unless he's already ingested something that could cause it.
Well done. No chance of Dustin Diamond being his friend. Where are these Doppelgangers? They teach at our alma mater. We call it Harvard, but most people know it as Miami University in Massachusetts, Ohio.
What's more, we're going to be launching a new business venture. It's called "FastFruit." It will revolutionize fruit delivery. Suddenly craving a plum? Within five minutes, a drone will arrive and drop it in your right hand.
Ted, it's okay. Give me the drone remote. As we speak, the drone flies toward our New Hampshire warehouse. Can we know the nature of the hack from whoever's supposed to have done it? There, I pick out your tomato from a huge pile of tomatoes, and fly it back here.
I sent a sample to pathology. Yes. Yes, I did. I think there's a good chance the tumor is malignant. Then remove it.
Why did I stay? I wouldn't waste useful pages on that question. It's inappropriate. It's irrelevant. We need an answer, Mellie, and we need to put it in your book, Otherwise, people will speculate.
Alone. Smithers, why are you always in my way? I'm sorry, sir. If there was a less spectacular way to save your life, I... I should have found it.
I'm a hypochondriac. I've been taking my own blood pressure since I was 9. Why is Sylvester treating you? My doctor says my blood pressure is high. I have to take it every morning.
Where the Navy will retrieve it in a watertight bag. Now, if your calculations are complete, you could deliver a WMD (Weapon of Mass Destruction) to a neighboring regime that's not on Washington's Christmas list. Trust me, I'll take care of it. In case you're wrong, I want a photo record of this technology because if we lose it permanently, I want proof of what Rahal was trying to build.
Great, but how do we get through without it detecting us? We walk like Egyptians. The ancient Egyptians used to make mortar from water, sand and limestone. The sand will be on the other side of the basement walls and we already know that the pump room will have water pipes. We'll fill it and turn the whole room into one big block of stone.
That bastard. I'm so mad at him. I'm gonna drink the last weird beer, even though it tastes like shampoo. - What are you doing? - No, give it to me.
You've always been obsessed with this place. - I've never been here before. You even took me here once. The town was buried under the sand then. Ford must have dug it up.
Don't ask me any more hypothetical questions. I won't. Don't ask me to bring you any more sensitive police material. Her blood pressure has plummeted since dialysis began. She might be too weak to take it because of the fever.
I was digging through my old stuff the other day, and came across this old letter dating back to the Canyon Grove camps... Old! And I was like, "oh, my God, I have to show this letter to Josh." You, you want me to read it to you?
- There's no way this redneck is going to screw up the business deal. I had to rewrite a whole Billy Joel song - to make that happen. - Yes. And we had to sing it.
I had to rewrite a whole Billy Joel song - to make that happen. - Yes. And we had to sing it. - You mean we had to sing it?
I just wanted to let you know. The map I told you about, leading to treasure or missiles or whatever... I don't want anything. The map is for Dany. A client of hers wants it.
Davie, the salt. That's enough, thank you. Angie? Ben? God hurled his thunderbolts at the city and burned it and its inhabitants, annihilating the whole country in a single conflagration.
It's all right. It's all right. I know how much the church meant to you. What, the church? Haven't you heard? They're tearing it down. They're tearing it down.
I don't want to break the mood, but I hate my ears. Could you please... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I must say, I do miss the ear. You can put it back on.
Tell me, when was the last time you watched a sunset without waiting for the next thing to attack you? - You should give it a try. - Yeah, well... I just hope this one isn't the last one I'll ever see. Does it really work? A banshee appears and you cut your hand, slam it on this and it gets trapped.
It's the least I can do to make it up to you. So you haven't heard? It's got nothing to do with you. She's got the fever. I had to provoke her.
He was just trying to help. I didn't want to hurt him. I wanted to get away from him. Are you telling me... that Red's death was because of you? Johnny tried to cover it up.
Yes. The only way to move it is to blow it up. You could kill them all. You asked for my expertise and I'm giving it to you.
- Disconnect yourself from Arkadia. That would not be wise. The migration is incomplete and the bag is now compromised. Without Arkadia's mainframe, the mobile unit would be my only source of power. If they destroy it...
I served your father with distinction for 20 years. You shipped me off to Staten Island as soon as you arrived. That has nothing to do with this. Of course it has. The city's going back to the wolves because you tied up the people who saved it.
This is what it must be like for Kim Kardashian to walk into a room. Well, it's pretty simple. One picture. And don't worry if you get an erection. We'll cut it off.
We thought we were dead. Not a single bullet hit us. We thought it was some kind of miracle. There are two ways to look at this story. The way I like to see it... it wasn't our day to die.
- I don't know. But this technology was developed by my husband. I'm afraid it's... it's powering another machine. The Witness has his own machine. - We've got to find it.
That was the plan. We don't want to know why. - The answer is here. - Damn it! We've got to find it.
He's in every movie. He's like the black Kevin Bacon. Girl, can you believe my life? And did you see the pool there? You don't even have to inflate it.
He's like the black Kevin Bacon. Girl, can you believe my life? And did you see the pool there? You don't even have to inflate it. Let's go take another look.
And how many years are we going to take for this? It's my fault Linda's in this situation. We can't let her die. We'll sabotage that rocket. We have to get it off course without alerting anyone at NASA.
Let us come to our senses and we'll get back to you. If you launch the rocket, he'll detonate the bomb. I don't want to die. We're not going to die. You said it yourself, there's no way to disarm it.
- Monsieur... - But nothing more. And the meeting with Eisenhower in Washington? Alas, I've been forbidden to fly, so I have no choice. - Should we postpone it?
with cute 19-year-old girls. Yes, I can. - Give me your hand. - Can what? Give me your hand.
"I leave you in charge" "The world has lost its mind... Let it speak" "Life is as capricious as a Ferrari" "Your life is as you decide to live it"
It's a disaster... - losing to those pirates. - I know it's a disaster. Just look at him. He doesn't give that mustache any respect. He doesn't deserve to wear it.
Facing the elements! Keeping the family dry! It's fur! What's the plan, Luke? There are no bad ideas, but waving a metal shovel around in an electrical storm could have a downside, so let's go store it in the garage, huh?
We're taking you to the hospital. I'll be fine. You're not the patient. The bullet's lodged at the base of your neck. You need to remove it.
They evolve. And you haven't evolved at all. You think you want to preserve life. I sincerely believe that. But all you've learned is how to control it.
Thank goodness for that. Why do you have Isabella's amulet? She never took it off. She hasn't? Cause I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've seen it.
Thanks to folk art. Specifically, chainsaw carving. A chainsaw is used to skilfully carve a bear or eagle from a tree trunk. Always very kitsch and very noisy. I went to get my chainsaw and was oiling it when the fire broke out.
Let's see how good. Yes ? I understand you insure rare items. My grandfather often tells me about this rare piece. He keeps it in a cigar box and a friend suggested I call and ask for Geb?
The list. Where did Riggs keep this list? Jack said it was a notebook. A notebook like this? Salib tortures and kills Riggs for the list, then destroys it.
Everyone thinks I should be a lawyer someday. I mean, I... - I don't have any money right now... - You don't. All you need to do is fill out this pardon petition and turn it in with the letters of support from Ana and her parents.
Mike's out of town for a while, so AJ will be staying with us. - For how long? - Just a few days. Jude doesn't get back from his school trip until Friday, so he can sleep in his bed. I finally have the room to myself, and I have to share it again?
♪ On second thought, maybe not ♪ Who is it? Looks like they're advancing on the Valencians. I can't see, but they missed my song. Maybe we should ask them to wait for me to sing it.
Marina security isn't as careful with their cameras. The "I" stands for "investigative." And the "S" stands for "Super Showoff." Well done. I'll get the video and take it back to Ops.
He's the king of Auto-tune. And what's that again? When a singer alters the sound of his voice to hide the fact that he's singing out of tune. Or when he's bad. If it's true and the voice has been altered, we should be able to de-modify it.
Here it is. We have the real voice of the 911 operator. 911. What's your emergency? Why would our target want to alter this voice? To disguise it.
It's not as if what Mayor Cavanaught said wasn't true. Did you really take that eight million? Except for that, Krummy. We cleared you a long time ago. The point is, you can't rewrite history, but you can make it.
She can't even cook an egg. [I know dinner's ready when the smoke alarm goes off. She knows, too. She hates her cooking as much as I hate eating it.
- Are you still under contract? - No, not since last year. I don't know what you're talking about. Did you record this song? I play it at birthday parties, but this video is online and it's getting a lot of buzz.
- No judgment. - We saved your life. There might be a solution here. A weapon. If we can find it, we can use it to kill the Beast.
The circle is complete. No one can erase that. So, that's it? Not my problem. My problem is that I'm strong enough to perceive a time loop but not strong enough to change it.
It was a rumor, there was nothing for sure, but I heard about the existence of a video. One of the few guys I still talked to had seen it and heard it was circulating. He told me it was kind of blurry and really dark. And then it got rawer. You could see it on her, who was just... all limp and far from her normal self. He assured me that I shouldn't see her, otherwise it would get really bad.
You two go that way. You two go that way. "Neerja... I've waited so long for your birthday I've rewritten this letter 15 times. But I finally had the courage to give it to you today.
Right now I'm doing research to find and stop the next attack. Has Krumitz been able to retrieve any information on the fitness bracelet? Not yet, no. The device was damaged. The chip was broken and waterlogged, but Krumitz promised to get it working again.
I can't wait to please you, my angel. You chatter and chatter. You talk without acting. Act, Bumble! Make me proud, earn my gratitude. How could you show it, my sweet?
How long have you been planning this? Couple of days. Oh, yeah? I've been planning this for two months, young lady. I even got two haircuts for the occasion... One to create my parting, the other to reinforce it.
Okay, since this is our session, can we talk about the fucking music? This elevator music from hell. This is music? It sounds like... Turn it up so I can check if it's music. Or turn it off. Otherwise I might slit someone's throat this shit is torture.
Can we stay focused? You stole the TV from creepy wrestlers. - I did not! - How could he be wrong? It's not even the same brand. So you're telling me these guys didn't steal a TV and erase the brand, knowing that if I found it and brought it back, we'd be having this conversation?
I have an offer. That cocaine you took from the Disciples and the 25 Boys? 30 kilos? Coming from you, we all know that. I can get it back.
That cocaine you took from the Disciples and the 25 Boys? 30 kilos? Coming from you, we all know that. I can get it back. You resell it, you make 100% profit.
And his basic right. Fighting for his neighborhood. Uh... I lost it. Anyway, I'm sure there's a story. And I can't wait to read it.
A signature or something? And why do we sign things? Because we want recognition? Recognition. And we took it away from him.
It has a charm, a baggage, a Christmas spirit, Grandpa. It was really nice of your family to let us have the room. Oh, I have an idea for the app. - (TV playing loudly) - We should sell it...
It was really nice of your family to let us have the room. Oh, I have an idea for the app. - We should sell it... - So we can sell less. - (TV playing loudly) What? - We should sell it...
So, how did the big date go? Was it as sexy as her New Yorker piece about gender bias in the tech space? Well, it was fun, but it was a little weird. Anyway, she paid the bill. And she didn't just pretend to take it and pass it on to me. She took it, and she paid it.
I have a jumpsuit... a dress, and a wig. Where's Rudnick's body? The dogs are up to something. Car's locked. Open it up.
We've got lives to save. Let's put on our other scrubs. You know that show Scrubs? - It's great. - Shall we watch it?
Not be afraid of it. Make it real, give it life. Your uncle Edward VIII threatened to do the same, to impose his individuality on the institution. To give it life! And in doing so, he almost destroyed it.
It really looks like things are changing. Did you know that the UN has declared intersex rights to be human? Fascinating. There you are. I was going to tweet this photo of us, but I wanted to show it to you first.
Because, believe it or not, I don't want to kill you, Stefan. It just doesn't make sense. Take my word for it. I know you don't deserve this mark, but someone else does. What if I told you I could transfer it to someone a little more deserving?
It's just me. I'll be right out. Drop the gun. Drop it! I'm dropping it.
I feel guilty about breaking it off. I had to stop all this. There are plenty of other places I can work. Yeah, I hear you. But you know, when Platt signs the paperwork and gives it to the commander. She'll want to know why.
No worries. If I may... I feel like an idiot asking you for another favor, but... My landlord fixed a leak in my living room wall, and I need to put a big cabinet back and my boyfriend was supposed to help me. Would it be possible for you to come up and help me move it?
No. It's taken everything we've got to find this place. I'm not ready to give it up. Not going to happen. The Rebellion needs this base and we'll do whatever it takes to keep it.
I think we should go. Is this the girl who was attacked with acid? In Saudi Arabia, we've learned that Hizb Al-Shahid is targeting Noura Al-Kitabi's family. You're telling me this is the same group that tried to buy the uranium? The conference...stop it. Stop it now.
I don't think so. [Anything else in the tablet we can use? This isn't working. I'll put it in a bag, take it back to Tear Down.
RYAN: It's okay to be afraid. In your situation, fear is good. It'll keep you alert, and allow you to fight. Use it to survive.
Asking for help had never been Darlene's forte. But is it easy for anyone? Admit to being weak. You can't escape the truth. The only way to heal your vulnerability is to show it.
Annihilation is always the solution. We destroy parts of ourselves every day. We Photoshop our flaws. We change the things we hate about ourselves, the things we think people hate. We create our identity, we modify it, we sculpt it.
Some of us need to be controlled. Once in a while, the best action to take is to follow the line of the barrel. Stare at the road ahead and hope it takes you somewhere you want to go. There's a flash drive in that bag. When you get to your desk, turn off your machine, insert the USB key and turn it back on.
But I did it for them. What we did was incredibly stupid, and we can't afford to find out now. Peace, Trent. Yeah, I'm on my way. Well, my proposal, we leave it here, wipe off our prints, and get out of here.
It screws up the economy and affects the prison budget. You got lucky. Don't waste it. That card's worthless out there. Do you want to keep it for sentimental reasons, or can I throw it away?
You got lucky. Don't waste it. That card's worthless out there. Do you want to keep it for sentimental reasons, or can I throw it away? Throw it away.
Why would you say that? You must have something in your hand. We found the ring. I was saving it for a special occasion.
But then we found Staci's body. Melissa went upstairs to check on the baby, and I... Ran for the camera? I know it was a dirty trick, but I also knew the camera must have recorded the murder. As soon as I erased the kiss, I was going to hand it over to the police.
We're hunters. Hunters? All you need to know is that we save people like you from things like this. Even if it's not a shapeshifter, it still changes form. If we can figure out what it is, we can figure out how to kill it.
So you're not going to pin this on me too. That doesn't mean you didn't take part in the robbery. How would they have known about the gelatin formula? That's easy. I'm not the only one who knows it.
You've got to come in! Buddy, the fire department will be here as soon as they can. Now we'll tell you how to save your brother. Compression? You need to take off your shirt, but keep your hand on your brother's leg the whole time. Take off your shirt, roll it into a ball and try to put pressure on your brother's leg.
Now we'll tell you how to save your brother. Compression? You need to take off your shirt, but leave your hand on your brother's leg the whole time. Take your shirt, roll it into a ball and try to put pressure on your brother's leg. Put the shirt in and around the edges. Make sure you get it in as much as you can.
We got a call about hazardous materials. That was me. We use ammonia as a flower coolant. Nate, he radioed that he was moving around the shed when he snagged a hose with the forklift and damaged a valve. He tried to close it but didn't get out.
Okay, how about this gray sedan? Partial plate "TSJ". - I'll check with the immats. - Good. 'Cause if one of them's driving it. Because if one of them is driving it, we're one step closer to Pride.
Finally, I thought she was dead. I sank. The pain was... so great that I started self-medicating, my work suffered and the mistakes began. Small ones at first, then more serious ones. Finally, my ineptitude was so obvious that I could no longer deny it.
You're not a genocidaire! You're a scarback! You take away people's suffering; you don't cause it! Are you going to give it to Jelco?
You're a scarback! You take away people's suffering; you don't cause it! You gonna give it to Jelco? I was going to make it empty, and we can always do that.
No, we're not signing. Well, I should use the fake signature Axl taught me, because I need it for this project I'm doing for my film class. Oh, and I'm working on a tight budget, so I'll have to shoot everything in the house. So it's a horror movie? Well, we have to take a scene from a cult film and reinterpret it in our own way.
Don't make that mistake again. I just... I don't know how to say goodbye. Then don't. Just promise me one thing. If I helped take off that armor, don't... put it back on just because you're gonna lose me.
- Exactly. - Could you tell me the best way to return the tablet to you? It's not the Foil. The Foil will be out for the start of the school year. - So, can I keep it?
Is that all you think about? Surfing the waves? The truth is, there's only one wave I can think of surfing. You know that waves go from the ocean to the shore. Legend has it that every decade, there's a monstrous weather phenomenon on the Atlantic that reverses the Jet Stream, and that on a Florida beach, you can take a wave from the beach and ride it all the way to the center of the Atlantic.
You should have listened! That's why he's looking for other best friends! Yes! Music is a clue. Follow it!
Maybe I tried his by mistake. Keep trying. It was late. I was tired. An image appeared, and I tried to close it.
There? What...? That was a good trick. Where's my wedding ring? I guess you'll have to look for it.
Bishop talked about it when I was clocking in. Who does it look like? I've replayed this surveillance video over and over, and I can't find it. De la Rosa's air intake is on the wall. Any diver could have disconnected it.
Let's go. Where's the information? Where's the information? Is it safe? Give it to me.
Where is the information? Where is the information? Is it safe? Give it to me. Give it to me.
I was just making a little joke. I, uh, I had a sandwich, so I'm not hungry anymore. The audition's just for a gas station TV, okay? Nobody watches it.
I can still help you. Well, I've got an idea. Why do you keep chasing me? You took my sword. I've got to get it back.
I don't... No, no, no, no, no. I'm not apologizing because I didn't do anything. Please, stop. The defense, the judge, Barba, they all had access to the video. Thousands of people could have broadcast it.
Thank you for your time. Are you reporting in? The aerial was in place for a drilling exercise. Lieutenant, I wouldn't want to involve you. The aerial's position... had nothing to do with the call, so maybe we shouldn't write it down?
Someone who knew you were going to Canada. - Now there's a coincidence. - I'm trying to help. It may be too late for that. I remembered, I left a toothbrush at Ruzek. If I leave it there, it sends the message that I'll be back, but if I ask him, he'll think I'm obsessed with him.
Now, if you try to break that bond, then... Then there will be consequences. For both of you. How's your clothespin? Are you wearing it right now?
- Your supervisor? Right on time. Under no circumstances is this letter to come to light. Do you understand? You burn it.
Tell him the whole story. - Horace Pete opened in 1916... - Damn it. - I'm telling the story. - Go ahead, tell it.
Oliver. Who's Oliver? You got page 172? It's high quality stuff. I'm not just gonna give it to you.
Petty Officer Finn didn't stand a chance. Death was instantaneous. He took a large-caliber bullet at point-blank range. Abby has the bullet? They were able to recover it.
- What's he like? Is he a magician? - With the gas stove... It's really... I'll put it back.
- What is it? - What's what? Dictionary, thesaurus, Principia mathematica... You got a letter from April. I'd been deciphering it for two hours when you called.
She can't see me like this. - Don't tell anyone about the restraint. - Mum's the word. PROVISEUR - Thanks for stopping by. - I had to say goodbye. I have a question and I'm not asking it at random.
- A key. - To where? My family home in Maine. It's great, private, near the sea. It's empty, no one ever goes there. My father bought it because Martha Stewart wanted it.
I sat down and it just came to me. Like the story had been stored for years, taking up space. - Like the lyrics to "My Sharona". - Exactly. It was there, waiting for me to put it down on paper.
- Did you want it? Lord, no! - So, no? - I'm sorry, no. Since neither of us wants it, we might as well sell it. - But I...
Lord, no! - So, no? - Sorry, no. Since neither of us wants it, we might as well sell it. - But I... Or someone will give me a fortune to tear it down.
Don't do that. Why don't you want the house anymore? It's not mine anymore. Not since your father died. I've tried to change it, adapt it, move all the furniture around, without success.
I miss her. But I love what I do. It's fascinating. I can determine the alkaline level of the soil - by tasting it.
- We cut. - We're bored. Right here! This shelf is driving me crazy. I'm trying to shore it up.
The bartender says, "What did you do?" "I went out with his sister behind his back." Emily had a sense of humor. - Beth, our spleen. - We share her.
She has autonomic hyperreflexia. Her blood pressure can go from low to high for no reason because of her tumor. And according to her basics, it's too high. Let's sit her down and put her legs under her, and try to get her blood pressure lower. If we don't lower it, she could have a stroke.
Here's the next photo Sasha has hidden in the site, the next victim is drug-related, and will be in this photo. Can we see the photo without triggering the site, which sends it to everyPicThread user? So why are you so excited? The photo is geotagged like the others. I can get the photo's metadata without pulling it...
I have the forms. I haven't done it yet. To be honest, it reminded me too much of him. My grandfather loved this gun. But it worked well enough, so I decided to keep it in my glove compartment.
In 1947, the Bulletin set its clock for so many minutes to midnight. The closer we get to midnight, the closer we are to the end of the world, midnight being nuclear annihilation. In the 90s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the clock went back to 17 minutes to midnight. Today, with the modernization of nuclear weapons and growing arsenals, the clock is at minus 4. But there's talk of setting it to minus 3 at the Bulletin meeting here in Washington this week.
I know it seems pretty small for me to bring this up, but you said you'd handle it, and that makes me anxious, so I thought I'd make sure. The washing machine. I got it. I ordered the part online. It'll arrive tomorrow and I'll fix it.
- Madam Prime Minister... We can move our weapons wherever we like. So we can refuse to talk to your puppet government, which is controlled by warmongering generals who don't even know how to negotiate. None of this will matter if that bomb goes off. Which it may very well, unless we agree on a plan to defuse it, and fast.
Which may very well be, unless we agree on a plan to defuse it, and fast. I'll send a team of engineers. - No, you're not. - This is our weapon. In my country, and if you can't transport it without colliding with our land, how are you going to defuse it?
You're the first foreign dignitary to have the privilege. You're not going to convince me to give up our bomb. Prime Minister, the reason we've kept you waiting is that it took a bit of direct pressure to get Prime Minister Verma to agree to give up your nuclear bomb. Good news. Verma is willing to give it back to the United States.
The window on diplomacy has closed. I've got to go. This isn't a negotiation. Excuse me? The American team that worked on the bomb will load it onto one of our helicopters and take it back to the Pasha base in Pakistan.
They got it off the surveillance video. Why do you blame Gloria's Guns? The gun that killed my daughter came from her store... What does "anonymous" mean? Someone buys a gun and sells it to someone else who couldn't have bought it.
It was dark, crowded and the music was loud. Why do we have this photo of you coming out with the gun? I wasn't thinking. I panicked when I saw the gun on the ground. I just thought I had to get it out of there.
So I turned my back on the idea of never finding any family ties. And after years, I finally found my family. With you. And now I have to open that door again... Don't open it.
What watch? You couldn't pay. I was going to call the cops. And you gave me your watch as a bargaining chip. Said you'd come back for it, but you never did.
Best buddy I ever had. She doesn't look familiar. And it's a fake. But it's the most recent clue I have. I'll buy it back from you.
It's a unique blade, but I guess you don't know that. You're lying. And here it is. Great, great. We'll bring it back together.
It's too good to be true. Because if someone were unfaithful, I'd hope they'd have the decency to confess. What are you doing? Because guilt is a very powerful thing. And if you hold it in too long, it will burn and burn, hotter and hotter, ...
Thanks, Dad. I'm glad, too, but I have to be honest. I think I'll concentrate on me for a while. Ken, I got my evaluation, and... I'm a little too nervous to read it alone.
Where? Here, in Norman's room. What was she doing there? Let me see it. Could she have given it to him when she slept at the motel?
She was unstable, talking about Emma. I didn't want to get involved. All right, fine. Why did Norman have the letter? She wanted to give it to me, but I refused.
You finally got me into bed. You planned it all along, didn't you? Art, the reluctant swinger, was just a decoy. I know your jacket. You wear it at work.
I hope you'll change your ways. Or our arrangement won't last. There'll be no reprieve. Libby forgot her jacket. I'll give it to her.
Want some? No. I'll have a drink, if you pour me one. On Saturday, I noticed that the outside light wasn't working. - I thought I'd fix it.
It's perfectly normal to have bloodstains. You told the nurses that you had problems with your eyesight. I was seeing black spots and I had a migraine. I think it has something to do with your blood pressure. It's within the norm, but I'll check it.
- Just try, kid. Oh, come on, we can work this out. Look, we'll already have a gleaming mailbox. For some reason. Yes, Henri wanted to replace it, it was "soiled by thugs".
You're frigid. Wouldn't an inability to ejaculate be better? - For whom? - For us. We have a specific method for treating it, this would be one way to see if these clinicians copy our protocol.
And to see a people who have a profound recognition of this fact is quite exhilarating. All over the world, on weekends, many people go to church and meditate. Martu people too, in their own way. In general, they spend most of the week living in modern houses and eating modern food. But at weekends, they head into the hinterland to rediscover their land and traditions, which are deeply linked to the importance of fire. They burn the earth to revive it and make hunting easier.
I'll be back in a minute. Where are you going? To get my keys. The case won't be reassigned until tomorrow. So we have all night to solve it.
Are you well? Yes. I'm great. - Let's get you home. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you know where my dope is, go get it right now.
You know what's real? I know what's real. Our restaurant is real. This life is real. And you should start living it.
Manager Kim came to help us. Oh, I see. Sit down, I'll make some coffee. No, I'll get it. "If the pan catches fire, cover it up.
I don't even stop to think. You know, I go first and I look later, right? Now, there's this problem with Gerald, okay? I've made a lot of bad choices trying to do the right thing. But this time, gaining your trust and then throwing it away, that was as bad as it gets.
And they all hired the same guy to make the Parisian pasta porcino? No, but two of them did. It's not a big lead. But it's a lead nonetheless. We'll follow it up.
Oh, crap. Look who's come crawling back. And I'm glad you're here, because there's something I want to tell you. I wouldn't raise your baby on a 10-meter pole. Even if that pole was made of gold and I could keep it.
- Yes. What are you going to do with it? What do you mean, what am I going to do with it? It's in my drawer. - Are you gonna bring it back?
What are you going to do with it? What do you mean, what am I going to do with it? It's in my drawer. - Will you take it back? - You want me to?
- If it goes on like this... - It's a lot of work. She didn't want a ring on her finger, why bother? Because it's in that drawer like a loaded gun. When we have sex or fight, he could pull it out and point it at me.
Because that would be hell. No offense, but your timing sucks. You know why I brought Jen here. What do you want me to do? I want you to take that ring out of your pocket and gently toss it out the window.
Recognize it? It contains a camera. Someone screwed it on top of your poker table. What did they do? The thieves' warning shots almost hit it.
To capture her raw emotions. Maybe you need to do this so you don't have to face your problems with Karma. But I don't... You need to deal with Lauren yourself. Off camera. Leave me alone or I'll take that camera, shove it up your ass and make a documentary about your insides. Jesus.
I'll let you get to work. I found this brand of tire in the mud. Wide enough for a truck or a van. Shall we tell the detectives? Take a picture first, send it to Sebastian.
I haven't heard you ask about them once. They haven't been your friends for a long time. And whose fault is that? I think we need a stronger opening. I think what we need to do is take that idea and put it forward.
Have you used this safe house before? Several times, but we do everything by the book. Nobody knows what goes on here unless they have a badge. That would mean someone with a badge placed the syringe under the table. And told Pena where to find it.
It looks like Zorn might have killed Babish for writing this article. But why would Babish go to Zorn? Ask and you shall receive. The video had a lot of static. But with a little Irish luck, I was able to clean it up.
May God protect her. And you are? It's better if you don't know. There's a mechanical clock in the corridor leading to the great hall. Hide the weapon inside, and I'll retrieve it when the time comes.
You become a powerful sovereign. This is what Scotland needed. That's what Elizabeth needs to know when it's time to step down. Do you think she will? She felt there was a place to take and tried to take it.
Stop him! Stop him! Stephan, let me go. No! No one admitted to helping them, but I saw people stealing food and supplies from the barn. Once we've surrounded it, we'll burn it down.
- we have. - with Boko Haram. You've got to be kidding me. Jay, this drug could be our only leverage. So you'd rather give it to this murderer than to the other people who are infected?
Well, now that we're starting afresh, can we finally get rid of that awful duck paint? - No, Louis, we can't. - Why can't we? Because it's like you. I can't stand her, but she's family.
It's a security. Unless she oversteps it. Damn. So what's the problem? I can see the information, but I can't manipulate it.
And I feel better. Can't wait to hang out with you guys again. Oh shit. What the hell is this? A woman gave it to me. - Well, throw it away or burn it.
- I can hear you. - But you can't hear the phone. - Maybe the ringer's off. - No, it isn't. Aspiration. Sometimes the ringer's been off so long you forget it's off and need someone to help you figure out how to turn it back on.
I'm doing fine. Been a long time! Yeah, it has. And whatever you're up to in there, it's not gonna work, okay? I like my life slightly better and I'm not going to let you ruin it for me.
Am I? You're a good person because I say mean things all the time and you just smile. You're sweet. So nice. You do things for people, and I don't. Sometimes I need a fork, and you go get it for me.
See how I do it? What's this? It's my granny's famous soup from Italy. I've already given them my famous canned soup. I could have made it myself, but they wouldn't have liked it.
You don't remember? - No, I don't remember. - It never happened. This isn't like me. You do things for people and I don't. Sometimes I need a fork, and you get it for me.
The crystal my grandfather used to link the magic of Storybrooke to it. Wait, I don't understand. You said the magic was bad. Why are we taking it out of Storybrooke? To destroy it.
He... he took me prisoner. We need magic to repair the wand. I know exactly where to find it. The hospital lab, but... I can't take anything without the Director noting its disappearance. You've got to give me the parts so I can fix it.
that she come home, and we... She had called for help. Why did you keep the murder weapon? I didn't know what to do with it. I didn't have time to destroy it, so I just hid it, thinking I'd deal with it later.
But what the coroner missed 20 years ago was the force with which his head hit the stairs. That's why the police ruled it an accident. So he must have pushed his girlfriend down the stairs, then stood over her, grabbed her head, and slammed it against the step. According to the file, yes. But the injury to our victim's head was so extensive that I couldn't conclusively link it to the steps or the field hockey stick.
I could do nothing, but then again, that's your job! If you really want to get out of here, I can arrange a direct trip to Hell for you! Stop it! Now, we've got to be patient. The guardian has promised to repair the wand and bring it back to us.
All of you. Just because the boy destroyed Storybrooke's magic doesn't mean there isn't any elsewhere. Because there's a reason they call this place The Land Without Magic. Yes, because that's how it looks. There's magic everywhere if you want to see it.
My family's in danger, but we can save them with magic! I know how crazy that sounds. But magic exists. It's all around us. You have to want to see it.
How was New Orleans? Tell me about it. - I'm getting ready to leave. - Are they cutting your salary? No, the offer's solid, but for a city with a soul, I'm not feeling it.
Sizz was going to leave it that way. No point in letting someone else... My idea. I take full responsibility. I appreciate it, really, but ... next time you have a brilliant idea, don't follow it.
Or perhaps an Asian dessert? We haven't had dinner yet. Let's start with the salad. Do you want the dressing on top or at the bottom of your salad? How do you want it on the bottom?
And I'll die before I let that happen. All I have to do is take my thumb off the phone. The child is wearing an explosive vest. He's inside the water tank on the roof. He was trying to deactivate it.
Would you look at that? Maybe they've got some sleeping gas in there. Then I reroute the gas that was for the vault door, spreading it through the ventilation system. The sleeping gas gives us 30 minutes to enter the vault, crack it, grab the sceptre and get out.
If we run off into the woods now and get caught, it's over. It's worth the wait. Anyway, shut up, they're here. It's open. Maybe it was their getaway car. but they couldn't find it in the woods.
We totally disapprove... of that. We finally arrived at Pine Cedar Lodge, and I could see why Mike loved it. There was a lot of tile. Sue, I told you not to order the 3-kg omelet. Yes, but if you finish it within the hour, we'll give you a pin.
Having fun? You know, sometimes adults say stupid things that kids don't understand, like when they talk about mortgages or the qualities of other parents. You may think you get it, but your brain hasn't yet developed the capacity for irony. In fact, your head is probably still soft. If I touch it now, my finger will probably go right through it.
I guarantee it. It's a good commercial. Well done, but it's dead, bro. Sorry, I can't use this. So we just throw it out?
Look behind you. It's Reid and JJ. Flash-bang! - Where's the bomb? - You won't defuse it in time.
He wants his nameplate. From the Ford factory. OK. He says his next of kin is his nephew in Arizona. Okay, well... Could we look for it?
I was going to. I even took your address the other day. But I... I guess I thought I'd have more time. I'll get it for you anyway, if you like.
He passed away this morning. Lord, have mercy. Why are you here? Mr. Zeke asked me to bring back his plaque, but I couldn't. I just wanted to see it for myself. I just wanted to see it with my own eyes.
I believe so. Nice to meet you, Bonnie. Nice to meet you. Why don't you keep the plate? It's not likely to be claimed.
I don't know what you see in her. I look at her and all I can think about is sexually transmitted diseases. They say we came by prison ship. Let them prove it. If there's any proof, let them show it.
I can safely say that his last contact was the post. I made a joke. You cut the car in half. No, the fire department did. They were already cutting it up to extract the fake Tony, so I told them to go ahead and dissect it.
Leah Ramsey or Elizabeth Elliott, you're under arrest. I'd imagined putting that on you, but under different circumstances. Are you writing your confession? My... get-out-of-jail-free card. Read it.
Quite frankly, I think he's fine where he is. After all, he opened the door for me. Give me the horn. What do you say? Or we can wait until the seal goes out and I'll come and get it.
Well, Quentin... you know what? I don't know if you're in a position to judge me, anyway. It's just me out there. Sometimes saving the city takes priority over running it.
Who's the toughest guy in the yard? It's highly unlikely that he'll come out just to play, but it's like what my little brother always says: "Don't fish without bait. "Thank you all for coming. With so much riddling our city, I think it's fair to ask why we spend the time and money to honor someone, why we commissioned a statue and had a ceremony to unveil it.
It's very embarrassing. I know Sara told her father she was leaving to protect the story. Why would she do that? Why does history need protecting? Because the morons who were protecting it, the Temporal Masters, have exploded.
Some of the nine families have accepted their fate; others are resisting. This was my attempt to stop it. By killing everyone with a horrible disease? By making this planet uninhabitable for those who want to take it.
You know, I never liked you. Why don't you die? Your bomb, will it work? Not from a distance. The only way to detonate it would be to shoot it, but then...
I want you to be happy. I want our girls to be happy. And one of these days, I plan to be happy, too. Look, there's... we can't escape this life, Care. So let's make sure we live it the right way.
Maybe tomorrow will be better. Bad day? I've been thinking. You're all alone in that big house. I was wondering if maybe... you'd like someone to fill it.
That's not my definition of "service". Enzo, tell the lady why this exchange is so incredible. This is your last mortal life. - I know all about it. - We'd like to take this shamanic life and transfer it to Bonnie.
I shouldn't have run! But you did. And I'm over it. But you still have my letter. Yes, I do.
She still has a mystical connection with all the Phoenix Stone vampires. I'd be happy to annihilate everyone on your list in exchange for a tiny favor. Such as? This is your last mortal life. What we'd like to do is take that life and transfer it to Bonnie.
Yeah, that explains why he had a second one. No, legend has it that this allowed him to conquer half of Western Europe. You know, I spent three years looking for that thing. In every tomb, every monastery in Europe, I couldn't find it.
After everything I told her, she still opened the vault? It's complicated. If this thing gets out in the open, we're... That's why I'm here. We need to know exactly what we're dealing with so we can beat it.
If this thing gets out in the open, we're... That's why I'm here. We need to know exactly what we're dealing with so we can beat it. You can't beat it. You can't kill it.
We're concentrating on the fight. Amara is looking for me. But for now, I'm protected. The second I drop my protection, she'll show up. She'll be expecting a fight, and we'll give it to her.
You're funny, too. Are we done? Here's what we're going to do. This is the prescription for your back. Take it and go.
Colt's ex. Colt, it's your son. The window's broken. It only opens 10 cm. I can fix it.
I know it's 600% in the end, but what can I say? I've never been good at math. The only thing I'm good at... is being Todd. If anyone has a problem with that, there's the fucking door. I mean, I'll hold it for you.
No, sharks pee through their skin. Tastes like bleach. What's on your mind? Maybe I missed your ugly mug. I got used to seeing it the last few years.
- Promise what? - Promise. I promise. I lost the watch you gave me. I was wearing it last night, I thought I'd put it in my box, but this morning it was gone.
All right. You know I love it. You know I love it. It's the best present anyone's ever given me. It must be in the bedroom. I'll keep looking, but... No, it's okay. I'll help you find it.
I'll take care of it. Take care of what, Craig? It was a gift. Marco said it was great. Okay, listen to me. As we move forward, you're going to slowly open your door and throw it open.
What did you say to her? I just took it. She thinks she lost it. She loves that watch. You've got to give it back to her.
She thinks she's lost it. She loves this watch. You have to give it back. Smurf said it was embarrassing evidence. Tell Nicky not to sell it.
Tell me about this one. - This car? - Yes, this car. A 1963 Chevelle. It was my first car. It's a piece of junk, but I'll never sell it.
Cryogenic preservation association. I am a member. Can I ask? Like cryogenic freezing. When I die, they'll take my head and put it in a container at minus 200 degrees until science figures out a way to... kill me.
That's why I'll use your capital. Let me explain something to you. I have not one, but 2 kids who are going to college. All my capital is going into that bottomless pit. Brother, if you had a chance to get in on the ground floor of Google, you'd take it, right?
Find the villagers. Your form is totally wrong. I ordered Ichiro to destroy this blade after the death of his son. Very well, then. I'll destroy it myself.
By the way. This village is under our protection. Leave here and we'll spare you. A sword is only as deadly as its wielder. And armor is only as strong as its wearer.
Why am I not surprised that you and Damien Darhk have found each other? What do you want from us? You've got something we need, and even if my partners think I'm crazy, I'd like to make a deal with you. You're in possession of an amulet. Give it to me, and I'll give you back nine years of your life.
Capone's men attack the ship. We've got bigger fish to fry, honey. Rex's killer? He's searching the ship for the amulet. It's only a matter of time before he finds it.
Why did you open a rift? - I didn't. - What isn't? That's why we called you. - Can you close it?
Let's go to the lab. What's this? It tests how your abilities affect molecular movements. This rod is solid tungsten, and it's heated to 2,000 degrees centigrade. Cool it down, and when we figure out how you do it, we can figure out how to help you.
The message? Come to Earth, make a new start. What about your world-renowned genius resume? You make a point, we're even. If a rope is knotted, patience will untie it.
I've seen us both. Vibe versus Killer Frost. It's time to set you free. Wally, no! You may serve the velocity force, Flash, but I command it.
I trusted Andy. Even when you told me not to, I trusted him, and now Laurel's dead. I need you, the team needs you, the town needs you. I'm not saying you shouldn't do penance. You probably should, but do it as a Spartan.
Keep your gun down. So you can shoot me? We're on the same side. You're out of control. This town is out of control, and you haven't been able to save it.
Justin Claybourne, CEO of the pharmaceutical company that manufactured it. By stop, you mean kill, right? Right. After Claybourne died, his company went under. He had no family members to leave it to.
You don't give your stories away for free, Mr. Castle, and neither do I. If you'll excuse me, I have a class to teach. Dad, what are you thinking? Lars found the lamp, and obviously he rubbed it, but that makes him the lamp genie, doesn't it? But if no one has rubbed the lamp since and I can find it.... then that makes me the new genie master.
I know too much. Lars and I met on a job in Turkey. And one day... after searching for an oil pocket on sonar, Lars came to me. He was so excited. Because he'd found the location of Solomon's tomb, and you used your skills to help him look for it. No, I didn't.
And you know what I think? That you need to call me the next time you see her so I can interview her. I need to make a wish list. Oh my God, I have so many! How am I going to narrow it down to three wishes?
The guy at table eight sent his burger back and left without paying. He said it was like eating cardboard with ketchup. Johnny, come on. If you burn one more burger, I'll fry you. If you gave me better meat I wouldn't have to char it.
I've never... canceled a dentist appointment. I've never... put my foot in the ocean. I've never... honked my horn if I liked something. I've never... thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee. I've never... put salt in my food without tasting it first.
So, now that I'm sober, I'm able to take care of myself and keep a job and pay my bills. In fact, after a lifetime of riding the bus, I just bought my very first car. And then it started having all these problems, and... I just don't know what to do. Why don't you take it back to the dealer?
Why don't you tell us everything you know and save yourself the trouble? You do it, I give you my word, we'll protect you. I was contacted this morning. The correspondent said that, for 10 million, he could make the gun disappear. Otherwise, he'd put it back where he found it.
Kidnapping her here was easier. That means he's been following her long enough to know her schedule. CSU ran a diagnostic on the Hillers' security system. The alarm was remotely disabled just before the abduction. He must have hacked it.
There are those who have lost a brother, others, a father... because of Gennaro and his boys. But that's ancient history. Those who kept us enslaved are now hiding in a hole. Or are hooked up to a machine that keeps them alive. And they must never return. Salvatore Conte and I made a promise, and we'll keep it.
Like don't touch my stuff. I used to. You have to be outside your door when you count. You can leave your door open or closed, it's up to you. But most leave it open.
I don't know, Sheldon. Come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, fried eggs... I've avoided those things my whole life. And now that you're pregnant, you have to. The difference is, she's going to bring life into this world, and you're destroying it.
You're thirsty and tired from the battle. You're standing in front of a tavern serving the best cold beer in the kingdom. I haven't had a drink in months. What do you do? I barge in, stick my sword in the ground, and say, "Tavernkeeper, pour me the best ale you've got, and pour it through a goblin's skull!"
I won't let him down. Thank you. In Turkish -You're waging war on the Turks and I count for what? -This war is first and foremost mine. I wanted to fight it alone, but Eddy convinced me it was risky, especially with Brabant around.
That's what I'm talking about. That's where my political conscience comes from. That's where my fight comes from. This suffering that grabs you, that holds you. It never lets go. This suffering, you want to take it and throw it in the face of all those who have made you suffer.
Taro will present himself. I understand, but what's it got to do with me? Taro is too old for Marseille. He doesn't understand this city anymore. He wants to modernize it with a bulldozer, forgetting what made it great in the first place.
In your house, Chasseron. - What do you want? - Your place. There are two solutions: either I give it to you, or you take it.
I took it, but it's going to look like you gave it to me. It's more polite. And for you, it's better, isn't it? Fred, close the door. Put this in a sealed envelope and drop it off at La Provence.
Don't forget that. Safety first. That's what I'm... You deserve this promotion. Go get it.
We don't know each other. You could have just said you were out of 4G. I'm uploading the video tomorrow at my cousin's wedding. Wi-Fi is free at the dog park. Would you consider not downloading it and deleting it instead?
Oh no, because I'm sorry, because I want to say If you can't do it, - who can? - That's so sweet. Did you get my picture first? No, he wants to keep it as a trophy, which is bizarre and a disastrous choice in decoration.
- Owner Bob said they loaded his food into containers. Maybe that's what this is... a warehouse, a distribution center. Looking at all those "peacekeepers," You're right. Castillo must have fenced off his stash and loaned it to his people as calories in exchange for their labor.
The food was not stored, but stolen. I found a railroad heading directly to a warehouse, and they've been using it for the last 24 hours. Next time a train shows up here, stop it... Hit them hard in the middle of nowhere, without being surrounded by 100 soldiers. We don't have to destroy the food... we can steal it.
And then I felt the beginnings of a will... not to let myself down. Because somewhere in all this, I sometimes managed to fight for myself for a reason, to fight for my life for a reason, And I survived for a reason, I'm here, still, for a reason, And not knowing that reason doesn't minimize or invalidate it or disprove its existence.
"a fountain. "One day when it was very hot, "the princess went into the forest "and sat down by the cool spring. "And being bored, she picked up her golden ball, threw it into the air and caught it.
Why not put that money into something worthwhile like a cute hat or a raincoat? A baby in a raincoat. It's like... A baby weatherman. Okay, so it's very simple. We wanted to pay for this bread maker, but they wouldn't sell it to us because it was the expo model, - so we had this plan...
I'm a grown-up! I can make my own decisions. It shows. I received a new dose. She tried to take it from me.
I can make my own decisions. I can tell. I received a new dose. She tried to take it from me. Just take it.
Accusations? No, that's not why I'm here. I'm a businessman, Andre, not an asshole So go ahead and make an offer. Just make sure it has seven zeros on it or I won't look at it.
We'll see about your pulmonary embolism, then. Believe me, I've survived worse. The scourge of my life is calling. Let me schedule the surgery and we'll talk about it when you get here. I'd like that. Schedule it for my 65th birthday. That's the ideal age for surgery.
Is that okay? Or you'll spend the next thirty years of your life in a box rethinking that. We should have Earl Scheib check it out first. I'm just the carrier. Three times a week, I fly to Green Island Atoll, pick up the cargo and bring it back.
He said we had to ditch. We're not going to ditch. Control, we have... lost both engines. All right, Inspector, under the dashboard there's a big red handle. Pull it to secure your footing.
Oh, crap. Oh, you poor thing. Your mom's gone, but you still have us. Has Mike been around the cow? He was milking it earlier.
Please listen to me. Hurry inside! Mom will be right back. The pizza's here. Can I open the door? I just ordered it.
Perfect. I want to sideline someone before tonight's event. That'll do it. What exactly do you... have planned? The city took love from me, so I'm plunging it into madness.
Captain, I'm glad you came. I came to congratulate you. If one person comes in contact with my blood, it changes him. You and I are going to make a difference in this city. We're gonna clean it up.
Just let me go. If the cops want to chase me, fine. But you... let me go. I wouldn't do that. You'd be condemning this town when I could be saving it.
Give us the necklace and you get your friend back. That's the deal. You mean the key, don't you? You don't get her back until I talk to whoever you're working for. Maybe we should just kill you and take it?
You mean the key, don't you? You won't get it back until I've spoken to the people you work for. Maybe we should just kill you and take it? You think we're stupid enough to bring her with us? Do you really want her back?
You won't win. If my son is dead, I don't care about winning. Gotham will burn. This city is on the brink of chaos. We're the only ones who can save it.
Or anyone? You think this is about Alchemy? One way to find out. Julian lied to us about the Philosopher's Stone. He must have found it during the archaeological dig.
One night, I was alone and she came to me. She stood before me, visible as if in broad daylight... a kind of ghost or vision, but... she was real. What happened? She told me about the stone. She told me where to find it and that if I did, it might bring us together again.
Jay's right, the stone is the key to everything. We destroy the stone and Savitar is gone for good. It's impossible to destroy. It's been there all along, there's a reason. Why don't we bury it, put it back where you found it?
It's impossible to destroy. It's been there since the beginning for a reason. Why don't we just bury it, put it back where you found it? Jumanji. Someone will find it and we'll be right back where we started.
Jumanji. Someone will find it and we'll be right back where we started. We've got to make that box disappear forever. There's only one thing we can do. Throw it into the Speed Force.
Family's a little down on me. Believe me, I understand, man. Where's that box? Somewhere in the storage room. My son was looking for it a while ago.
No. That was almost 100 years ago. I'm not that person anymore. It doesn't matter, Stefan. That stain will always be in your soul, no matter how hard you try to purify it.
A tragic poet filled with darkness. Why is it fun to go back to an inferior version of myself? You had a lot going for you, too. You were loyal, creative and wildly romantic. You know, even if I turn it back on, it's too late for you.
Mr. Morningstar. - Yes, Mr. Morningstar. - Ryan Goldburg, Kimo's manager. I wanted to thank you for bailing him out. Kimo certainly couldn't afford it himself.
"Coraline finally allowed herself to sleep. "While the sweet music of the mouse circus "wafted through the evening heat, "telling the world that summer was almost over." Read it again. You want me to read it again?
Everything I say is a metaphor. If you don't mind, you're spoiling the mood. Ladies. If you change your mind, my door is always open. Feel free to close it again.
I never wanted to believe that my father had killed a cop. And then today, when I got the video... What video? His lawyers sent it to me. He said I should receive it after his death.
You see? He's innocent. Tina, I can tell your father loves you very much, but... that tape doesn't prove anything. Those lawyers had that video for 16 years. He made them promise to give it to me when he died.
No, Maze, you don't understand. It's going to accelerate. Going from human to human, leaving an unimaginable trail of destruction in its wake. Yes, bad little thing. We've got to get it back.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Let me remind you that I have a job. And let me remind you that this blade doesn't just kill humans. It also destroys celestial creatures, demons included. Suppose the inspector finds it and takes it home...
Why would you say that? What's wrong with you?! Me? If you didn't want the blade to be found, you shouldn't have left it in a hole in the ground!
If you didn't want the blade to be found, you shouldn't have left it in a hole in the ground! A hole in the middle of nowhere that no one would have found without your help. Yes. Well... that's it. Besides, where else could I have hidden it?
And I used your... little history lesson as inspiration. The Lux is out of danger. It can't be demolished for expansion. Inspector, you... you saved my house. You still have to buy it back from Eleanor Bloom, probably above its value.
She saved the Lux. No strings attached. I didn't even ask. Chloe has seen that your home is a very important place to you. Does it really surprise you that she wanted to help you protect it?
If I can get it signed. - If? - It'll be easy, you think, after your provocation with her voice on Hakeem's song? You've got to stop interfering with what I do. Get me that song so I can throw it into what I'm doing.
If it's good enough, I'll sign right away. I don't have any contracts on me. Put the offer on this napkin. It will be binding until everything is settled. But I'll sign it if it's good.
It's part of the user agreement for the connected TV that was in the office with Jacob. "Please be aware that anything you say can be captured and transmitted to a third party when voice control is enabled." So when you listen to your TV, your TV listens to you. Only it doesn't record your voice. It reduces it to a data stream, which I'm now inverting to recreate the content.
If you look closely, there are small imperfections in the prints... this is perfectly normal. But if we compare these prints with those in Jacob's file... we find exactly the same imperfections. The chances of this happening are slim to none, as Agent Reeves would say. I think someone used Jacob's file to make a fake print. Can it be traced?
Well, because, look, I know how much this dress means to her and I... I think, together, we... God, I can't even look at that thing anymore. I can't get over how horrible it was. Please take it off the mannequin.
God, I can't even look at that thing anymore. I can't forget how horrible it was. Please take it off the mannequin. After a while, we'll find a solution. I'd say let's burn it, but it seems completely flammable.
Well, almost. Tell your Flo Rida story. It's so funny, go ahead. I was at a radio party. And the DJ... a buddy of a buddy, was a pain in the ass and... it was a big thing for the radio station, and the party was in full swing, but he ruins it for her, then changes the sound
Go away! Close the door! Close the door! Close the door! Close it! Close the door!
Close the door! Close the door! Close it! Close the door! Close it now!
Close the door! Close the door! Close the door! Close it now! Close it now!
- Driver! Is that you? - Yes. How many people can be in the lead car? We have to uncouple it and go to Busan.
So... does it feel good to have your daughter thank me? Are you grateful or not? Why is your ringtone in such poor taste? What's wrong with it? How can I change it?
Jin-hee! Open the door! - Open the door! - Jin-hee, Jin-hee... Open it now!
- Jin-hee, Jin-hee... Open it now! It won't budge! - We can't open it! - Break it open!
Do you know anything about it? No. It's not just what they stole. The remaining food will have to be burnt. - No one will want to eat it.
Disjointed. Is that a problem? People sometimes start chattering when they're scared. It helps compensate for the fear. It also masks it.
Great. Ginger snaps. So... That'll do. He'll be behind the door when I close it, won't he?
- Neither do they. It's about your wife. How can you not be interested? You have a safe and effective option. Use it.
I'm the king of villains. Like you, there, when you tell me you smoke. Alfred, you've got to help me. You know very well you're not going to pay Earn any time soon. I can't lose my job, because I'm all we've got. My buddy, Bibby, buys piss and puts it in a condom and tapes it to his leg.
I'm ashamed to say I tripped over a suitcase. I missed my conference in Lyon. At least I improved my French with an orthopedic nurse from Montreal. The reason I'm here, apart from the coffee, of course, is that the hospital has an internship for you. - I'll take it.
I get it. I get it. It's a... Dr. Downey preferred the saphenous vein to a small thoracic artery. The pulsation of the artery is good. Let's start to clear it.
Martínez was right. You always need a method. Something to grab onto when things get too crazy around us and we're in danger of sinking. Something to bring us home when we feel lost. If we're lucky, someone will give us a method, and we'll follow it.
She's amazing. What's amazing? Why is there a zigzag at the Maison De la Vieille Dame? - It wasn't there when I went. But after you left, we discovered a World War II bomb that seriously didn't go off. Right where the runway was. We had to go around it.
- Can we destroy your house? There's a lot riding on this. It's faster at the end of the first straight. You know where it is. You've both been there. I'd love to tear it down.
- And we buy it from you, at a lower price. It's a win-win situation for you, us and the land. Nobody's forcing you to buy it from me. I'm not Savastano. Buy it wherever you want. If you find it cheaper, but that's not the point:
Stay at the station. This is Three, come in. Is anyone receiving me? You got your com, kid? No, I must have lost it.
Nobody wants it. Jews, veterans. Gays. They all refused, saying it was too big for their showrooms, their stores. The divorce table. He needed it.
Then he launched his reign of terror in Metropolis. He declared war on Superman. Committed heinous crimes. When Superman put Lex in prison, I vowed to take over my family's company. And rename it "L-Corp".
Basically, he targeted the building's weak point. Just like that perfect shot to destroy the Death Star. You don't need Star Wars references, just a plan. If you fix the column, the building should hold. Fix it with what?
43 minutes to go. This better be good. I want to be a reporter. I don't know why I didn't see it. Being a reporter means being connected to others, finding the hidden truth, sharing it with the world.
"We can at least spare her some of the pain." But she was very sensitive. Do you know what she used to say? "Every life has its own share of pain." "The sooner you learn to tame it, the better."
♪ - What a beautiful day for a family walk. Tell that to my bad back! This is not a family walk... Homer forgot where he put the car last night, and now we have to find it.
- I'm not a child. - I know, but you can't blame me for being a little worried. You want to go on a station that has a good chance of exploding. And that's the problem, isn't it? We have to find the bomb and deactivate it.
It just doesn't make sense. I've been to enough spaceports to know that they're always looking for it wherever the ships dock. Correct. It's a precaution against engine failure. If it's a tarium bomb, how the hell are they going to get past it?
- Aren't we all? You know that in the parallel reality the destruction of Eos 7 started the war. And you think the same thing's going to happen here? We think Ferrous brought a bomb on board. Three and Six are looking for it.
You were kind to me, even after you saw I wasn't human. I don't want you to die. - Then deactivate the bomb. - I can't deactivate the bomb. It's in me, but I can't control it.
Demons are... metaphors. Don't you think I know that? Do you know how embarrassing it is to come and tell you these things? But I'm telling you, something's happening. There's a presence, I can feel it.
"when you're armored. "The world is cold, racist, gives you pneumonia. "A cold, racist world like North Carolina. "I stash the drugs on a boat so they can't be found. "Maybe I'll give it to your daughter to try.
- I'm so hungry. - I know you are. I'm so hungry for a waffle and a sausage. What are you gonna do with a sausage? - I'll shred it.
We have a soldier. We need a historian. A maid who knows the customs, can travel incognito, help us keep a low profile. I'll send you a few names. Someone who loves history would like to save it.
No, I was trying to save you! I'm trying to save you now. The airship is dangerous. There's a bomb. And we're trying to find it.
Before the internet or smartphones. You could talk to anyone in the world with one of these. I'll make it work, and you and Gordo... Daniel stop. The radio's in the garage because I want it here.
Would you like me to bring anything tonight? I fry fish like nobody's business. You invited Riggs to stay with us? We have a new house. We're supposed to have friends and family over to make it cozy, right?
Thanks, Mackenzie. All right, I'm off. I'll see you at five. No, you have to... take your hand off... it's there. - Unlock it.
Let's go ! - Hold it right there. - Drop the weapon. - You drop the gun. You drop it.
A week in the past, if I'm not mistaken. The energy machine is a time machine? Did you know that? I had my suspicions, but the good news is... There isn't any. Hide. Take the machine, put it inside.
I thought you were hiding things out of eccentricity, madness or stupidity. But you haven't. You knowingly hid things. - You lied to me. - No, I didn't lie. I didn't tell the whole truth because I didn't understand it...
100 years ago... Stop this bullshit right now. - You wanted answers. - I want reality! I want my reality back and I want it now...
That's right. You destroyed the machine and the plug. You've destroyed the machine and the plug, but there's another way. What other way? This thing. Another version of the same machine. We know where to plug it in.
- Farah, wait. - Stay back! For God's sake! We have to fix this machine. We have to send it back.
Patrick Spring. It's crazy to see it up close. So much money and... Where's the head? We keep it separate.
It's crazy to see it up close. So much money and... Where's the head? We keep it separate. I can show it to you.
And have something that looks like a tomato, but tastes like a raspberry. Is it a tomato? Is it a raspberry? It's a bit of a mind game. I can give you a slice of bread and a tomato, and you could eat it and go, "Wow, that's delicious."
Because it's up there. It's not there." This is going to sound strange, but I honestly think being sick taught him how to be a Chef. Before, he always had to do it, and he wanted to plate the dish for the first week or two before anyone was allowed to do it. Now he creates food without ever touching it.
Every chef wants to be known for using a knife. Cutting, creating, jumping... doing it all. But maybe that's not the most important thing. Maybe the most important thing is to take that idea, that little nugget... and hand it over to someone else.
So here I am, trying to, like, you know, "Oh, I'll make the soup. Okay, that's what they want. I'll make this, taste it. I'll add this flavor." And then the chef tastes it: "Oh, it's good."
It was just something people did out of necessity. At the time, my idols were, Jean-Georges and Daniel, and all these chefs who had restaurants in New York and were getting 4 stars from the Times. So I started looking at schools in New York. I didn't care what they thought. I was happy with my decision and I was going to pursue it.
At one point, I thought maybe I should close the Pujol. It's the worst feeling on earth. One day, out of the blue, I walked into the kitchen, and every time they had... They'd put on music when I wasn't there. And I'd come in and they'd turn it off.
The idea of a product is to be able to present the terroir, which is the union between the land and the people... If we can do that with food, I think it's a pretty cool idea. And we aspire to do that. Agaves take about 12 to 15 years to mature. At that point you can cut the plant, process it and bring it back here to be transformed into mezcal.
I wonder why he... y... That's not real sushi. - It's okay, man. - It's okay. It's okay. I found my jacket. He wants me to give him $50 to drop it off.
You okay, bro? Here's your key. Thank you for this. I've been looking for it all day. Yesterday, when you were drunk, you told me to save it for you.
Tell me about the smoke. What about it? What did it smell like? What did it taste like? If we find out what it was, we can look for it in your blood.
We're talking about a woman my mother's age. I jumped to my feet. I pulled down my pants. I pulled out my erect cock. She hallucinated. I put it in her mouth.
In fact, if you were listening to yourself, it's hilarious! Your own shitty containment team weighed two tons, and required a Mac truck to tow it. How the hell would I...? There are plenty of foreign powers capable of setting this up, Doctor! Why would I have waited for you to come and get it?
I just want to thank you for always being there when I needed someone. You know, in another life, in another time, right? 00:26:57,652 -- 00:26:59,844 Well, uh... Good-bye, David. I've spent my life designing this thing. Now I'm going to blow it up. 574 00:27:14,880 -- 00:27:18,515 And what about the cycle of life?
I wasn't in charge of the strategy for controlling prayer meetings, marches, petitions, voter registration drives. I've seen sheriffs, deputies, storm troopers, more or less, in passing. I never went to town to stay. This was sometimes hard on my morale, but I had to accept, as time went on, that part of my responsibility as a witness was to move from place to place as freely as possible. To write the story, and break it.
I hate him. He was your father, Kurt. And you speak of him in the present tense. My hate won't go away. Because you can't handle it.
Come on. I've already closed the valve that was opened remotely, so you don't have to pretend. So Major Dickless didn't have the courage to do it himself? If you mean Major Gleason, who took your anti-matter yesterday, no. In fact, we're the ones who took it from him.
A cyborg loaded with kryptonite almost killed Kara. So did I. Open your mouth, J'onn. A shipment disappeared four months ago. We did everything we could to find it.
Consult for your cough, Maurice. I said... let's get started. Yes, of course. I offer you this flower as a symbol of peace. I hope you'll take it and we'll put an end to the war and return to peaceful coexistence.
It's incredible. Can you show it to me? No, Patrick. I'm super busy. And everything. - I can't wait to get home and look at it. - Yeah, you will.
Isn't it stiff? It would take the edge off. I guess it would. All right, then. I'll go get her.
This was a really bad idea. I give away all my secrets. Tutorials are all the rage. This video is going to be a hit, trust me. Don't post it.
I know, but it doesn't have the same oomph as the free singing tutorial. - It would be great if... - No, see? This video reveals my secrets. Don't post it.
If I'd had that daughter, she'd already have been whipped and roasted. Priscilla, the bastard's offspring, has hidden her away from our sacred land. I won't leave my land. Never again. I must protect it from intruders like you.
What are you telling me? The dress you ordered to celebrate the 25th year of Father's reign. I can't believe you've forgotten. You love that dress. I saw you wear it for the last time, the night I was removed from the palace the night Father died.
What do you mean there's a legal problem with my hatch? As you said, please take two steps back. The old hatch was perfectly legal. It was authorized under the Regan administration. But when you decided to renovate it, it had to be subjected to the new regulations.
Lawson steps up to the plate. Come on, breathe. - Give me the ball. - Just take a minute. Give me the damn ball. Let them hit it.
I wanted to keep it to myself. - I don't want to brag. I'm so sorry. - Nonsense. There's a dedication and I wanted to read it to you.
Without further ado, I'd like to try this. A little song. A gift for you. I'm going to make this little song. You won't even notice it, don't worry.
They've almost finished analyzing your apartment. You can tell them to take their time. I'm not going home. I've looked all over the Hilton. You know, or at least until this job is over, so when you get the bill for the dress, just pay it.
I'm Madison Gray. How can I help you? I don't know anything about this. I haven't been on a board in over 10 years. You made a promise and I'm reminding you of it.
Our big challenge is actually how to get to the surface. Mars has an atmosphere, but it's not enough to really slow you down, so we're going to have to use retrorockets, parachutes, heat shields, we've got all the tools in the arsenal that we're going to have to use to get humans on the ground. One of the most radical ideas SpaceX has for lowering the exorbitant price of going into space is reuse. Elon Musk wants to be able to put a rocket into orbit, unload the cargo in space, then use the retrorockets, and bring that rocket back down to earth vertically for reuse.
He did it because he knew it was the best chance any of us had... I can hardly believe he's still hanging on. The blood was obliterating his left lung and pleural cavity on the left, diminishing his ability to breathe and preventing him from oxygenating properly. After evacuating a large volume of blood and clots, his spleen turned out to be badly damaged. I was able to remove it, but his vital signs remain unstable and his prognosis is still uncertain.
Javier, are you all right? Javier? Yes, yes, everything's fine. Robert... if you open a sign, close it. If you open a box, close it.
What would life be like in a fledgling Martian colony? Let's take a step-by-step look at how we might do things on Mars. There's exploration, someone leaves and comes back. The next step would be some kind of research station. You'd have to supply it mainly from Earth.
Cratered and dead. Life might be more unique than many had thought. It was kind of a terrible disappointment for a lot of people who had assumed there would be something out there, anything. But we haven't given up on the idea that there is life out there. There's an almost religious belief that maybe we'll find it if we keep looking, and that's based on faith and not knowledge, in the same way that religion is based on faith and not knowledge.
And so when the wind howls, when it's minus 20 or 30 degrees, it's enough to make me start thinking about frostbite, or hypothermia. Despite the danger and the extreme cold, and the wind and the dangers all around you, there are questions we can answer here that can't be answered anywhere else. It's that combination of cold, drought, salt and radiation that makes this the toughest place on Earth for life. And my job here is to find it.
This has obviously caused a lot of tension in the company. All stations ready for launch. H minus 30 seconds. Elon Musk has said that the key to getting to Mars is the reusability of rockets. He wants to be able to put a rocket into orbit, drop its cargo into space, fire the retrorockets to bring that rocket back for a landing, and reuse it.
I was polite when your protégé accused me of botching Leonard Bailey's case. But the employer of an impostor won't accuse me - of being a bad lawyer. - You don't think you are. I think you made a mistake. And I'm giving you the opportunity to fix it.
A jury should have heard it, which is what you want to fix. You only want to fix your reputation. And you won't do that by sullying mine. Georgina, a man's life is at stake. And I've done everything I can to defend it, but I don't have to do it again.
Leonard's witness is dead. But his testimony isn't. You want me to testify for her? My protégée has written an affidavit. Sign it or lie under oath that it isn't true.
And you were baby that I handled it. Instead of being vindictive, thank us for not suing you on Leonard's behalf. - Try me. - You made a mistake. We're giving you the chance to fix it whether you want to or not.
What the hell do you mean? Tomorrow at 8 a.m., the government will seize this house. That's bullshit. - This state has a grant law. - I asked around. You bought this house before you sold your old one, so they can and will seize it.
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. You didn't what? I didn't mean to frighten you. I thought you might be able to help me. My daughter told me to download the Snaptalk app, but I can't find it.
- What's Snapchat? It's Snapchat, not Snaptalk. You've got to be kidding. That explains it. And why can't I find it?
I couldn't catch him. He's ready. It's like Murphy's Christmas. Will said to send up a rocket. When he sees it, it'll light up your world like a candle.
In several states, there are reportedly worms in food. Corizon Healthcare provides health services in 28 states. We're talking millions of dollars. Juicy contracts are offered for very long periods. Providers don't even have to provide the service, as they're sure to get paid. It's extremely difficult to talk about and criticize mass incarceration, because it's a very lucrative niche for many people.
And I'm not kidding. Tell me you're kidding me. Oh, come on, that's bullshit. You know I'm a man of my word. Yes, and I told him so, and he doesn't want to risk his life to find out that cancelling his sentence means cutting it in half.
Are you threatening a federal prosecutor, Harvey? You're damn right I am. You better think about what you're doing better than you did last time because this is going to end badly for you. As far as I'm concerned, it's the same thing. I made a promise and I'm not going to break it.
No, you like to intimidate, which is why I didn't want to represent you in the first place. You only came because you needed to. You don't care. Indeed, Nathan, I don't care, but as you said, you're bound by your word. Here's a chance to keep it, and finally get off on the right foot.
Stop what you're doing and find me a house in the Hamptons. - I beg your pardon? - A big, expensive house, hopefully on the water. I'm not your financial advisor, but why buy when the firm is just recovering? I told Tara Messer I had a property and hired her to redecorate it.
Your Honor, all I'm asking is that Mr. Sutter give... Something he has no right to. I have every right to make sure your client acts within the law. On what basis do you say otherwise? When you break the home run record, and someone says, "Your bat is rigged," you give it away to show that it's not.
Something he has no right to do. I have every right to make sure your client acts within the law. What is your basis for saying otherwise? When you break the home run record, and someone says, "Your bat is rigged," you give it away to show that it's not. Except when that bat is the reason you're hitting those home runs, because the second he holds it, the whole world will know what's inside.
Whatever you do here will have to wait until morning. - It can't. - And why can't it? Because Sutter wants me to get an immediate rejection. What? You pressured me into this indictment, and now you want it dismissed?
- And why not? Because Sutter wants me to get an immediate rejection. What's this? You pressured me into this indictment, and now you want to throw it out? I don't want to dismiss it, but if I don't, he'll find someone else who will.
She's nowhere near her innings limit. Or her pitch count. I know, I know, I know. But the corkscrew ball is totally variable. Plus, she throws it 48% of the time, which is 7% higher than anyone else throws their specialty pitch.
Go. Enjoy yourself. I'm so sorry. Did I tear your dress? If I did, I'll sew it myself! No, it's fine.
Dead? No, no, no, no. This adorable little girl is not dead. Now sit down and calm down. I feel Flora's life force, and I feel it strongly.
Move in tomorrow. We'll give you the deed now. We don't want to live there. We can live wherever we want here. We want to keep it empty for the Bouchère.
Those two savages are still at it. We killed people last night, Audrey. Both of us. And it was all caught on tape. I want that video back before anyone - finds it.
The bullet is not in the midline and does not touch the aorta. It's in the left paraspinal muscle. Will the surgeon remove it? It's harmless. It's safer to leave it there.
It doesn't bode well, but it also seems odd. Whoever it is, we'll get them out by turning Miami back on. They do use EMI devices. The fault zone covers the same area of land in all four cities. Its effect spreads randomly, making it difficult to locate the source, but I've got everything here to locate it, - disable it, and make it...
Whoever it is, we'll get them out by turning Miami back on. They do use EMI devices. The area of the blackout covers the same terrain in all four cities. Its effect spreads randomly, making it difficult to locate the source, but I've got everything I need here to locate it, - disable it, and get it... - report it to the person in charge.
Agent Elizabeth Albee brings a USB stick with new information to this location. I'm going to steal his badge... I could clone it and put a false identity on it. Then, you take this USB key... Put it in the server...
- Forget it. I can't forget it. That thing inside you is my responsibility. - No, it's mine. - What if you can't control it?
I'm sorry. What he did wasn't in vain. Mack has a lead on his uncle... His possible location. We'll follow it, make sure he doesn't hurt anyone else.
They thought I was cheating. They didn't think I could do it. They shut me up. Just look... look what I can do now. I can create a city from nothing, or cover it with volcanic rock.
Except that I've proved it wrong. I'm rewriting the laws of nature. Yeah, but you got drunk on power, or you drank your own "Kool-Aid" or you drank too much Powerade.... I don't know. My point is, you don't create energy, Eli... you steal it.
I'm rewriting the laws of nature. Yeah, but you got drunk on power, or you drank your own "Kool-Aid" or you drank too much Powerade.... I don't know. What I mean is, you don't create energy, Eli... you steal it. I steal it?
- You know everything. Look, I'm tired, it's late. I'm tired and I'm going to bed. I just want the truth. To hear you say it!
And sometimes I want to say to him: "Shut up and refuse!" "Don't you have any self-respect?" I don't know what to say... So you can't sleep because you spend all night wondering whether you should tell your friend to shut up or not. My grandfather always told this story... Tell it to your friend.
Have you researched economic and demographic indicators to bring context to the human-alien relationship? All very good questions,... You didn't give me a story. You gave me a half-baked idea. Go bake it completely, then I'll talk to you.
- You can't stop us You can't stop what we're changing This planet is being destroyed by the human race, who live only to suck the life out of it Like parasites. Only we can save it.
- You're coming with me. - Not until I've drained it. I'm afraid Mr. O'Reilly isn't on the menu tonight. This planet doesn't take well to the concept of parasites. This planet is dying, and we've been chosen to save it.
Do you know what it's like to lose someone you love? It's like not being able to breathe. I know what it's like, Phillip. I lost my father, but I don't kill in his name because I want to honor his memory, not destroy it.
Can he increase his power percentage? He knows you'll be afraid to throw another one at him. I'm not afraid. So he'll be on the lookout for a corkscrew ball to the outside. You throw a fastball down the middle, he's going to shoot it 500 feet or he's going to freeze and end up taking it for a strike.
Top to bottom. I'm not going to the memorial tomorrow. It's gonna be, like, 200 people. - Really? You really want to miss it? - You really want to miss it?
My knife is in my pocket. You have to sterilize it on the lamp. What's wrong? The bullet's still there. It's just under the skin, but you have to remove it.
Technically speaking, it broke. Mostly because of General Grant's concern, he and I will be going to see the play tonight. No! Like I said, it's a terrible play. The General will hate it.
But we're in a hurry, Batman. Jaywalking is very dangerous, especially at night. As legitimate agents of order, it's imperative that we follow the rules. By golly, you're right, Batman. No one is above the law, even those who want to enforce it.
Yes. A soldier came to Howard's house. He was scary. What did he say? He gave me his business card and asked me to give it to Howard.
I bet that's Barbara from the retroviruses. She must have heard me throwing up one morning. Ever since she got her hearing aid, she thinks she's great. Why don't you want anyone to know? Because I'm in the running for a major immunotherapy study, and if they know I'm pregnant they might give it to someone else.
There's no more room on our side. Oh my God, Max, why is it so heavy? It's probably the hot dog diaper. Let's put it on Han's side. Move that note, I'll burn it later.
Maybe after we get out of here, we'll be able to look at people and find their weaknesses like they do. What if that's not what you want? Isn't it horrible to know everything about everyone else? To see their suffering? Wouldn't it be worse not to see it?
Come to think of it, that was Bill Maher. Look, it's the Pleurington Bear. Unlike the downpour, this jacket doesn't protect against insults. I need to check the gutters. If you find my love life, bring it to me.
Oh, wait. No, he just needs the pipe. That's a laugh. Now you won't get the story. - You want it now, don't you?
- I'll introduce him to the people. - No, you won't. When you wear this dress, you sign a contract. I haven't worn it in a long time. I hope you get the chance to wear it again.
But you have to remember to rest." I said, "I can't take time off every week." Right, Patrick? This music depresses me. I'll ask Stephane. We'll change it.
You watch us for weeks. You take your notes and decide we're too lame? Who do you think you are? Once again, we really like your company. We'll buy it from you, if you'll let us.
He's your receiver. Trust him. - All right, let's go. - I hear you've got a fastball. I don't know if I can throw it for a strike yet.
Don't do it. He'll hit if it's close. This guy... I played with him in the WBC. Likes to be the hero. Don't throw it on the back rest.
Only one pitch saved for Ginny Baker on a 3-2-3 double play. You don't see that very often. You fooled that hitter good. He crushed that ball. You fooled everybody by catching it.
- I didn't say anything to avoid jinxing it. But there's an Alzheimer's clinical study at Johns Hopkins next month and I hear my mom will be in it. She's in. Excellent news, Spencer. The program is called metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration. Previous tests are encouraging, not just slowing the disease, but reversing it.
He must have dragged it over there. We'll search the area and bring back the dogs. Lab results. The DNA found on the muzzle matches one of the first 5 victims. The suspect must put it on them.
Play homicide detective? You could sit on his lap. He'll let you play with the mermaid. He loves the mermaid. I hate the mermaid.
Do you have a sketch of the nightingale in 2016? From a witness in 2009, but I can't really send it to you across time. There must be a transcription of the description, right? - Somewhere. - Find it.
They'll grow back... probably. And my statue! And my wedding skin. And my hand. She finally spit it out.
This one lost the race. And don't hesitate to come back tomorrow. There'll be plenty more horrible chores for you. I love my new animal skin! Pat is going to flip when she sees it.
Could you turn that thing down? Sure, no problem. Keep your hands where I can see them. Put the gun down. Put it on the ground.
I wonder why? On the way here, I hid a small charge of C-4 in an electrical panel. Roger that. We're on our way. I wanted to set it off as a diversion, to take the guards to the site of the explosion, while Yao and I left.
That's why we remember the Alamo. That's why they were able to defeat Santa Anna in a few weeks. - It's only two sentences. - Exactly. Because Travis was killed before he could finish it.
I know I want the best for him. But there's one thing I can do and that's protect them from Darrell. Then figure out how to do it. There's a right way to do it. Find it.
Just married. He trained here on his honeymoon. Permanent sacrifice. I want to know something. Admiral Cheernow trusts the operation, but you're running it.
Coming through! Weller, Jane, are you all right? Yeah, we're fine. One suspect down. Secure the bomb before the other one detonates it.
No! You don't share top-secret information with a dark web hacker. - You've already done that. - I just showed him the picture. I didn't let him decipher it, but I think he knows how.
Love is the most powerful magic in the world. Is it really? You see this brooch I sold? My father gave it to my mother because he loved her. She cherished it because it came from him.
It doesn't mean a thing. It's not a question. The question is too subjective. You always say I'm wrong, so there's no need to answer it. The area is secure, I'll find it without your help.
If the bomb explodes, the bastard dies. It's improved with American equipment. Heavy, isn't it? Can you hold out until the police arrive? - How do you neutralize it?
I'm sorry... for everything, okay? You were right about Olivia, obviously. Well, she was right about me. What if I do the surgery and nothing changes? If you think that, then why even try?
Excuse me. I-I heard that. I work for the government, we might be able to help. My son can trace Daniel's tablet. It doesn't have that feature, you can't trace it.
No. Just his tablet. So they had his tablet - and Daniel has theirs. - And I guess theirs is traceable and they're trying to find it.
He's going down. Daniel, give him what he wants. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Come on, you can give it to me.
Aram is working on it. It looks like we're involved, whether you like it or not. Any progress with the photo? No. I tried to recreate it using a hexadecimal editor and some customized forensic software, to trim the reader...
You're a technician. You're an operator. The instrument of a greater plan. I, on the other hand, am the strategist. If you throw me that can I'll catch it, but only because I've calculated in advance the risk of someone throwing it at me.
You're welcome. It was an easy job. Our computers are simple paperweights. I always have a safe copy. I run out to get it and give it away.
Oh, that's a shame. You know, I've always loved Halloween. It's a chance to be whoever you want to be. I used to take my dad's letterman jacket, put it on, and grease my hair back, pretending to be cool.
That's right. You're blind like bats. You're blind like bats, so act like them. - We locate each other by echo. - Exactly. Cabe, grab the biggest rock you can find and throw it in front of you.
Smart. For 1985. You know, this album is from 2014 and has a reflection on that screen over there, from that 2016 calendar. That's funny. You know, I took this picture, uh, but I must have put it in the wrong album, Because I ate four Nusty Clusters....
Milk it is. Did you know he had a locker? I'm blind, not stupid. I asked around before I rented him the room. Which is this way, if you'd like to see it.
Katrina Cooper. Bruno's classmate. Prom queen, married to the school champion, active social life. - How did Bruno get her earring? - He could have stolen it, but if so, she never reported it.
I'm not letting my son go through this, okay? You can get us out of Storybrooke. I've seen you open portals before. Even if I agreed... I can't help you without the wizard's wand, and your despicable husband has it under lock and key. It's a good thing I know the person to take it from him.
Really, whatever you want, I'm here. That's my girl. I see you've chosen the big one. Weather derivatives are tradable products that protect corporate bosses from future climate change. It's like licking a slice of pizza so no one can eat it later.
I promise. Kate, could you help me? No, I hate this dress! I know you hate it. But I don't care if you hate it.
I don't know about that. It freaked my parents out, but it freaked me out. When I took up the violin, I felt like I was reuniting with an old friend. Anyway, there's always a part of us that we don't know. And then, all of a sudden, you discover it and you say to yourself...
I'm yours! I've got him! We have to make sure he can't move the tub. Put a rock on it. It'll weigh it down.
As a reminder, it's forbidden to run, dive, and especially to use glasses around the pool. Feeling rested? A deckchair! Run, run. Take it!
Feeling rested? A deckchair! Run, run. Take it! Take it! Take it!
I had guessed. Anyway, welcome back. Gosh. Advanced pancreatic cancer. I say we start with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy I hope that will shrink the tumor so we can remove it
Anyway, welcome back. Thin. Advanced pancreatic cancer. I say we start with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Hopefully that will shrink the tumor, then we can remove it
I escaped after the hostage exchange. So why are you still here and not miles away? And risk triggering their bioweapon? I like my head. I'd like to keep it on my body.
Apart from me and him, you have unexplained parts of your life. they're explained. Maybe not exactly. This coming from a man who spent a decade as a willing witness to murder. I'm telling the story, not making it.
That's what my father plans to cut with these scissors as soon as I'm born. I'm trying to stop him, but I don't know how. The answer to saving me is already inside you. It's right here, in front of you. You just have to be ready to see it.
Dr DeLuca maybe... No. I beg your pardon? This artery that's going to help this woman survive. I wouldn't put it in the hands of a first-year resident who hasn't removed a tonsil.
You're not going to smother someone again, are you? Will you shut up? Shut the hell up! Full suction. You can change it, please.
I don't know. In fact, when I close my eyes and imagine our future, I see us with children. I just... love our life. Just the way it is. And I'm terribly afraid to change it.
In fact, when I close my eyes and imagine our future, I see us with children. Only... I love our life. Just the way it is. And I'm terribly afraid to change it. I don't want to change it.
If I could have your attention. Something important to say. I've got a big surprise for you tonight. And this New Orleans brass band is going to take us all the way to my house! If you could follow me to find out.
Here's what's important. Your theory isn't a religion. It's science. You've got it on paper. It's not a belief; you can prove it.
It's a question of perspective. To me, we're like a beautiful family. I don't see the connection. You don't like my song? - Sorry, I hate it.
Do you really take credit when you're the cause of the problem? I didn't cause it. I didn't let that building rot until it became unsafe, I didn't put liquid metal in those vents. And I certainly didn't build an illegal reactor. No, you just came back into my life after ten years, more than happy to demolish it once again, figuratively as well as literally.
Yes, Walter, hi. We can hear you. Zooming in. Walter, Mr. Elia is very upset, and he wants his rocket back now, young man. I'll give it back, but probably not all of it.
Previously... I love our life, I love it the way it is now. And I'm so afraid to change it.
- After the reading. Paul, the shamash? Sloane, tell the story. You're in luck. - She tells it beautifully.
Okay, maybe there's a problem. I'm 100% - this piece is exquisite. - Oh! Can I see it from another angle?
Like, ready to break out the champagne and Prosecco. If you find marijuana in a locker, it's yours. It's ours. It's part of the apartment. We could just put it in...
- We're not going anywhere. - No, we're not. Rufus, go! This patch isn't as strong as the rest of the shuttle. - If they touch it...
Chet Polian is a retiree stuck in a San Diego nursing home. Bennett's pilot was using Polian's patent without his knowledge. Local police took fingerprints from the cockpit, no match in databases. Marcus has seized the airport CCTV. He is currently reviewing it to identify the pilot or the stowaways.
Did you look at it? I wanted to, but I couldn't. I heard a loud noise upstairs, the killer must have fled when he heard me coming. And now there's a tape with your name on it in Jones's player. If the police find it, they'll come asking questions. They'll find out you were at Jones's.
- Nothing yet. Would you like a closer look? Sure, I'd love to. You really think the killer left the gun downstairs? 20 bucks says it'll turn up in a bush down the street.
Let me check your authorizations. Do you think she has access to the right floor? I hope so. It's pretty unlikely she has a peanut allergy, too. I told you, if you want to keep the room, you have to keep it hidden.
Do you think she has access to the right floor? I hope so. It's pretty unlikely she has a peanut allergy, too. I told you, if you want to keep the room, you've got to keep it hidden. You have to protect it, Ian.
Then follow me. Are you ready? Lead the way. You were supposed to put the tape back in the cupboard. I know, it was stuck, so I was lucky to get it back.
What's in it for you? The bonus is supposed to be more time with the kids. From the sound of it, it was great. Think of what we could do here. We could take an old motorcycle and tinker with it.
Oh, ladies. Pretend to smile, I've found more boring things to do than read. Oh, wait a minute. What do I do with the wedding box? Put it away with my wedding dress.
Oh, here's another one. "Don't tell your mother what I said." What difference does it make to him that we're in the kitchen? They're coming for the food. They won't even ask us, they'll just take it.
There are no files on anyone named Marvin Osweiler. So he gave him a false name; that's interesting. The name may be fake, but the address isn't. I'll put it in your GPS.
Then good people wouldn't need guns, And nobody needs guns, What do you say? And you know what else? While we're at it, We can eliminate discrimination, war, hatred, violence, and all that kind of thing. We'll all live happily ever after, And we can, you know, ride our unicorns to work every day. And you'd probably order my unicorn, and ride it to work every day. And guess what?
What's he doing now? Can you see? Now we can't see anything. He turned the camera off, now we're blind, so going forward was a bad idea--now it's a really bad idea. Let me know if he turns it back on.
Your birthday present. - You already gave me one. - It's not from me. When your parents asked me to take care of you, they entrusted me with this letter. They told me to give it to you on your 20th birthday.
You'll be fine. Because you deserve it. Take a deep breath. You have to feel the water. Can you feel it?
If I'm in charge, it'll never happen again. Tell that to the Council. Is there any more? But I have a ring. Do you want it?
And there's a bit of logic and problem-solving involved. If he fails, he could be kicked out of Scorpio. I'm not sure I'd shed a tear. But Paige would. Their relationship will weaken over time, but if it's destroyed prematurely, the mind will categorize it as unrequited.
If that grump can smile at his wedding, Maybe he can too. Ah... Walter. What's this? Uncle Tobin told me about the village tradition of taking a stone from the bottom of the lake and giving it to a family member.
Tim Armstrong is not a small office guy. I hit the bastard, and so they're going to move slowly. Who were the other guys? We'll know when we find them. Go by the car in case they surround us and try to steal it.
Camping stoves and generators can finally be discarded. Central air conditioning! I'm all over the ice machine. I'm going to chew so much damn ice. I'm going to chew it, again and again.
Activate the megaphone to speak, can you avoid it by chewing? Thanks for your time. This is all great fun, but I'm afraid people are a little upset that we're out of electricity. Relax, we probably just blew a fuse from overuse. The main reason for settling here is electricity, and if we don't get it back, I'm afraid people will start to have doubts about this place.
What do you see? Right there! Let's go ! Seal off the area below. Seal it off down there.
And I don't have time to make puppets. Mr. Burns, being a parent representative is a full-time job. No, my full-time job is my full-time job. I've got 3 projects on the go right now. Why don't you take all that negative energy and turn it into puppets?
If he moves out for good, Leonard could keep what you don't like in Sheldon's old room. - No problem. - That's a great idea. I could turn it into a playroom.
Shh! They're right outside. - They've gone. - Let's say we all finish this video game. How do we destroy a bioweapon without setting it off ourselves?
They're right outside. - They're gone. - Let's say we all finish this video game. How do we destroy a bioweapon without setting it off ourselves? It's not like we can just pull the plug.
- Let's say we all finish this video game. How do we destroy a bioweapon without setting it off ourselves? It's not like we can just pull the plug. Biological weapons are alive. If you raise the temperature high enough, you can kill whatever's inside, bacterium or virus.
I didn't say it before because I couldn't prove it, but you're one of them, and dropping that cartridge just confirmed it! You can't believe that. Shut up, both of you. Shut up, both of you. Sebastian, you and I are gonna find that gun and we're gonna keep it.
Rittenhouse knows you doctored those tapes. No. They know. Last chance. Whatever your next mission is, record it correctly.
About what? The key to Bonnie and Clyde, opened an interesting door. Or a clock. - It's invisible ink. - Read it.
She was the only person in the conspiracy theory who actually got their hands dirty... hiding behind a computer screen. She did her research. She found the proof. Just having a theory didn't satisfy her. She wanted to prove it.
- Yes. - Hang on, guys. HPD found the van. It's been impounded from a downtown parking lot at a pound on Frenchman Street. Tell the impound guy not to touch it and have CSU meet us there.
Commodus realizes he has no one left to turn to. And just when he thinks things couldn't get any worse, disaster strikes Rome in its very heart. Following a thunderstorm, a gigantic fire spreads right through the center of the city... sowing destruction and panic in its path. The fire was caused by a lightning strike right in the heart of the city. Talk began of divine vengeance. The gods were angry with Commodus, with the city of Rome, and were going to reduce it to ashes.
I should have done something. Helped her. There's nothing... nothing you could have done, Dustin. But now, with me, you can make a difference. I bet if you hear a song, just once, you can play it instantly.
So if it breaks, there's no more? Leonard, who should keep it? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you. On the other hand, I love clocks more than you. Do you think you should keep it?
Theodore, meet your new roommates, Leonard and Penny. They're very honest, but don't leave any money lying around. Sheldon, what are you doing? My room's paid up to the end of the month, so I can do whatever I want with it, including renting it out for $1 a night.
"No more windmills, please." "And the name?" "New Amsterdam". It's the pride of the Dutch. Amsterdam is beautiful. The English rename it after the 6th worst city in England.
Woman: Wow. "I help people and feel good when I do. I'm a caring person, a Scientologist. You're not able to face the truth and you deny it because of your own crimes, crimes of not doing your job and instead being lazy and incompetent.
A bit of both. He was crazy in the sense that he wanted to put a pigeon in a missile. ANIMAL PSYCHOLOGIST For the pigeon to go and blow up a ship. Putting a pigeon in a missile is crazy and immoral. But in theory, it could have worked. As the bullet approaches, the pigeon pushes it with its beak towards the other bird.
We've made an incision, as you can see. A stain is applied. It's applied to both surfaces. The dye attaches to the fibers in the tissue. If you could dab it on the wound... - Like this?
Angel's does not increase strength, but has the advantage of a wide variety of useful accessories. As an electrical engineer, expert in robotics and animatronics, I'm excited to see your hand. - And me, to have my hand. - I can't believe it. I'm thrilled because Angel is going to show me how I can control it.
But that's when I discovered an inherent fault in the system. Are you serious? Come on! The card is finished. So I have to stop, remove it and put in the second card.
Asshole on the loose. With four competitors vying for first place, a fifth enters the fray. This time, it's all about me. This invention has been invading the world for the past two years. It's in every tourist spot.
So I'm going solo. First, I'll make a model out of polystyrene. Then I can work out the shape. That's what they did in 1902, they sculpted. Once we've got the shape we want, we can reproduce it in metal.
But first, the finishing touch. Baker dressed his car in wood and canvas. We'll use the same materials. We'll use 6.35 mm plywood. We'll cut 76 mm strips and wedge them onto the structure. Then we'll overlap them and nail them down. Once we've got the basic structure, we'll spray it with expanding foam to smooth it out.

Berezovsky never did anything for free. Wherever he went, blood flowed. Over time, HC had changed. His hair became very greasy. We were let out of our room one morning. HC was there and he had made a kind of sculpture with his toothbrush and toothpaste. He was looking at it.
The fact that the site is a theater of war is a sensitive issue, and one that provokes propaganda on both sides. I was very serious in what I said to the Israeli Prime Minister. I expect an immediate withdrawal. We were running out of time. As this crisis had... a worldwide repercussion, we were under pressure to resolve it.
I'd like a glass of water." Tom sat with his leg like this. In Arab culture, you never show the soles of your shoes. It's not done. Tom was holding his leg so the guy wouldn't pull it out.
It's true, it's true. Yeah. Locked portals. Everything was regimented. You couldn't send a letter out just by putting it in an envelope.
You couldn't send a letter out just by putting it in an envelope. Security read each individual letter that went out. - I see. - If it was OK, they'd seal it and send it. If it wasn't, it was returned to you and you had to change it.
And the second I got there, the illusion immediately vanished. You see, this is heavily guarded property... - Mm-hmm. - ...with a lot of secrets and a lot of control, specifically: "OK, you don't... you're not allowed to make phone calls without permission and without anyone next door listening. If you want to send a letter to your family, you have to leave it open, and it has to be read first."
It's just... Don't say "your destiny". - Your sacred duty. - Or that. You can't refuse her.
The amulet responded to your unconscious command, Master Jim. - You're comfortable, aren't you? - Yes. She feels it. You're beginning to master it.
He hasn't even been training for an hour. Behold the Revealer! He'll judge your true courage. Put out your right hand, Trollhunter. He'll give it back to me, won't he?
Hole. Yes... The situation has suddenly become very complicated... Come back here. Shouldn't the amulet be coming back to me now? Unfortunately, this rule only applies if you reject it.
What's too much? This is too much. Can they smell fear? - Oh, no, they can't! I can smell it too.
Your blade is an extension of your body, and your body is an extension of your eyes. Imitate my movements, troll hunter. That hurt. Real combat is never predictable, Troll Hunter. You have to expect the unexpected and learn to embody the armor to force it to obey you.
That's good enough for me. Ah, there's my date. Don't worry about it. He's all tied up. He'd rather play with his food than eat it.
You gave a blow to a Tracker? - How brave! - I was lucky... Terribly heroic, courageous and worthy of a Troll Hunter. Once a Stalker marks his prey... he stalks it until it dies.
It's a meaningless word. - A bad word. - Yeah. And are we talking happy ghosts or soul-sucking poltergeists? They won't suck out her soul, they'll barely look at it.
- Oh, my goodness! - Yes! - ...and lived to tell about it. - Oh, no, you don't! You never intended to give it to us!
Wumpa, look out! Are you all right? There it is! Oh, it's a finger. Oh! I can't find it.
You told me to look everywhere! - So, what was in it? - Nothing in it. Just a breath. What do you mean by "breath"? The box was empty, but before I closed it, there was a...
It's a start. Is there a place for me? Since when do you know how to do that with a sledgehammer, Tobes? It's a war hammer. Respect it, please.
Brocantia? How did you get my number? Dwarf infestation in my store. I need the Trollhunter! Why don't you take the ring and wear it?
I still have nine minutes left. Isn't that great? That gives me time to decide whether I want to give him back his soul... or wear the ring and control him. The Murder Stone! I can have it back.
Gunmar betrayed him in the hope of taking over his army. The battle lasted weeks. Gunmar lost an eye, Orlak his head. This could be the hardest stone to find. His servants worked hard to steal it from the Kruberas. They won't give it back so easily.
Barbara, you have to leave! This is... - The cellar! - What's in the cellar? Draal was supposed to be watching her.
Are you going to join forces with the IMF like President Lozada? It's a question... - We're dead. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. If you believe in democracy, then practice it here, ask questions.
Damn. What's this? I lost an earring behind the washing machine. Tough luck. I'll get it for you.
The laws of physics aren't the same over there: no up, no down, no straight lines. It's up to us to create one. This rope will link us to life. If we let go, there will be no way back.
The image I have of you is a shadow smoking... weed in a Corolla. I'm gonna go now. I'll be going now. I have another letter for you. Mail it.
Now I notice lots of things and I want to see... how they work. Like this clock. Goldsmith's work. What craftsmanship! It belonged to my great-grandmother, 19th century. I want to take it apart. Spread it out... on the floor.
The camp serves as a facade. Inside is a hangar. Skynet has hidden his ultimate weapon under this hangar. When Skynet realizes it has lost, it will deploy this weapon to ensure its survival. If we don't neutralize it, our future is doomed.
It's no use. You've given us a future, John. Mine will serve a purpose. When this is over, I'm going to find my parents' house. I'll fix it up.
To me, all those assholes in Winter Hill are treasonous bastards. I grew up with him. Jimmy, his brother Billy and me. That's a bond for life. If he gives me his word, he'll keep it.
It can't be done. It can't be done. This land belongs to us. Our ancestors lived here, cared for it and bequeathed it to us. It's our duty to protect it and pass it on to our children.
Daddy wants me to go. He wants you to go because you're a baby. Play the game. Turn off your lamp. Turn it back on, you'll feel better.
We'll give you one-fifteenth of the profit. And that's more than I ever paid a first mate. And if you bring back 2,000 barrels of oil, I give you my word, next time you'll be captain. You've already given me your word, Mr. Mason. So this time, I'll put it on paper.
Henry Say it! Henry! Henry! Put the gun down. Henry, put it down.
Mr. Chase, you have the best position. It's just a whale. Right there! Throw the spear! Throw it!
Can you smoke that outside? Is this weed for your artists? Yeah, shit. I'm trying to get back on my feet. They smoke it, sell it, have a fiesta, whatever, as long as I'm left alone.
But, if it had worked, you wouldn't have that ring. Well, if he comes back for it, I wouldn't want him to find it covered in flour. Let me see it. Well, there you go... I don't want you to lose it.
Not in front of my family! Your wife left it in Missouri. Maybe it's important to you. Is that my wedding ring? He was trying to give it back.
I think it's safe to say that your problem has nothing to do with X-rays. Come on, darling. Show me your beautiful hand. All right, darling. Put it right here.
Tomorrow will be too late. What's that supposed to mean? I just need my guitar. - Forget it. - Forget it?
What's that supposed to mean? I just need my guitar. - Forget it. - Forget it? Don't say forget it,
When the market shuns an MBS, what do you do? - Take a guess. - I don't know. Tell me. Do you think we store it in our positions?
- Take a guess. - I don't know. Tell me. Do you think we store it in our positions? We mix it with other unsaleable crap and create a CDO.
Take a look at what I've unearthed at the store. Is this a good idea? No, no, it's fine. Well, we don't have to... No, no, no. Let's just stick to one bottle. Well, open it.
First choice. This is a... particularly robust stock. With a stable market, if we harvest later this century, profit margins should eclipse your nearest competitor. Understand this, M. Night. I'm going to harvest this planet tomorrow before she takes it away from me.
Kaulder! I'm here to help. Chloe! I told you not to come! That immortality was never yours! It was mine! You only wore it for me!
Drink this. Thanks for your time. The Queen of the Witches is back. I thought immortality was her way of punishing me. But she only used me to keep it.
Don't get carried away, my Russian friend. Engaged isn't for anyone, and I mustn't have a ring anymore. Don't you remember? It was stolen. Your fiancé would have gone out at the crack of dawn to replace it.
So, according to its calculations, it had to pass close to Earth in the winter of 1981. - Did it? No. No, it didn't. But that hasn't stopped us from watching for it every year.
Not for the first time, Ella felt sorry for these two she-devils, whose inner ugliness was matched only by their outer beauty. My prince! You will love me. I'll be his queen! Since her stepmother wouldn't order a fourth dress, Ella figured there was no reason why she shouldn't make it herself.
As I was saying, it's the poetry of the chords that blends with the poetry of the lyrics. Like two people in love. Yeah, like a dwarf who asinates himself. In fact, it reminds me of a song I just wrote. I can play it for you later if you like.
A trivial question. It could have opened by itself. Oh, come on! I didn't do it. Last one out the door has to close it.
- She'll come out. - She will. And Marzin will arrive in a stolen gray van, Carolyn's DNA under his fingernails, and everyone will be a winner. Forget the van. We'll never find it.
If I... We found a wrecked van on Grand Street. The driver fled. The interior smells of bleach. He tried to move it.
A van was found wrecked on Grand Street. The driver fled. The interior smells of bleach. He tried to move it. He tried to move it!
- Drop the gun! - Get down on the ground! Drop your weapon. Drop it now! Put it down.
Drop your weapon. Drop it now! Put it down. That's it, that's it. Slide it over here.
When I was six, I once read a book about the rainforest. The book said, "Boa snakes swallow their prey whole, without chewing."
Good evening! Good evening! Oh, excuse me! That's just the beginning of the story. Never mind. Nobody understands her anyway.
- To Theo. I have a gift for you. Since you refuse my alcohol. A box! Not just a box. Open it.
Each one older than the next. A packet of licorice lasted them the whole show. They chewed on it for two hours. You've got a new poster on Sunset. You should stop by on your way home.
Bagels. Mom called you. And you're home early. Hope, your favorite flower is... The rose. To smell it, you breathe through...
Let me tell you something. I'm feeling generous today. Come on, stop it. You can't be serious. As soon as you stop enjoying this machine, you'll give it to someone else.
I still don't know... Have fun at the doctor's. Your favorite flower is... The rose. To smell it, you breathe through...
Have fun at the doctor's. Your favorite flower is... The rose. To smell it, you breathe in... Hold your breath as long as you can and release it in a big...
No, buddy, no, no. I have to do this alone. - This is yours. - No, I'm not taking this shit. - I'm giving it back to you.
- Can I be excused? Hey! What are you... I heard about your stupid magic list. If you want it back, you'll have to come and get it from me.
Good. You want to move a mountain? Right there. Move it. Move it. Move it!
You want to move a mountain? Here. Go ahead. Move it. Move it! Move it for everybody!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Didn't mean to. - Really nice guy. - It's not gonna get any better, so... - Got it. I'm going to put a key in my mouth and double-lock it.
It's much more than a battery problem. Why? Because you have a conscience. Because you have a conscience. You're not data. We don't know what consciousness is. So we can't transfer it.
Put this on. What's next? Consciousness is energy. The helmet reads your energy and my energy. I have to find a way to get it out.
Hey, it's me. We've got to get moving. I know what consciousness is. Cool. This helmet can read it.
They're not all dead. Michelle is still alive. Do you have anything else to say before you go to prison for the rest of your life? I'm not going to prison, Elizabeth. - I'm leaving.
Just a moment. Hey! You're not homeless, are you? I didn't dare interrupt you. Give me back the sunscreen so I can give it to a real homeless person!
That's it, yes. That's very funny. What's the news? That's the news. We're selling it.
What's a solarium? A solarium? Are you old enough to have a mortgage? Yes. But we pay cash.
Number one only. Sure, come on in. And you can do whatever you want. Wow. I'm renovating it because I'm going to sell it.
All right. Geernt! Hi, there. I've come to carry the paint. I'll put it by the pool.
- You've done enough. Don't you have a plane to catch? When are you going to learn that we don't need your help? I can't do as much as Maura, but I have a little money. Can I live in your house, temporarily, with Haley, and fix it up?
Go home. I don't have a home anymore. Take out the granddaughter's card. Oh, boy. All right, I'll give you two weeks to fix it up, then I'll fire it up for the insurance.
The police academy must be great! Look, kid, I really don't have time to play! There's a teacher who teaches you how to find clues and when to turn on the siren! - It's true that you have to-- - Okay, stop right there! My leg's so bent that you can bend it the other way. My boss, who's a complete idiot, thinks I'm a marble!
He wanted to tell me personally that they chose not to comment and ... that he wanted to be courteous. God, the balls on this guy. What did you say? I told him he was mistaken and that we'd run the story. Of course we're running it.
That's why I don't approve of mass suicide. If we don't take District 2, we won't be able to get in. Wouldn't it be enough to neutralize the fortress instead of taking it over? What do you have in mind? Think of it as a wolf's den.
I'm fine. Plutarch gave me a letter for you. I don't want it. It's never easy with you, is it? OK. I'll read it to you.
Dad said I could. He doesn't want to see you grow up. Did you go back to the platform? What are you doing there? Are you trying to stop them dismantling it?
All right, then. Suppose I knew for certain the exact moment of your death. Would you want to know or not? Of course I would. But... what if accepting my death causes it?
Thank you for your time. I just don't know what to do. You already do. Frankenstein, open this door! We're gonna break it down!
Long live the resuscitation rooms, eh? So, did my beauties sleep well? My beloved beauties. Were you able to move the car? We couldn't move it.
- Give me the books. I'll be there in a minute. Hello. - My bike's broken. Can you fix it?
Try to stay alive, kid. Bodhi, I don't see any tracks. I don't. Well, I do. I see it, and it's beautiful.
How old is your daughter, Señor Blanco? Jamie is 10, and Julie has just turned 15. When is her quinceañera? When? I'll put it in my window.
Take it off. Whoa, easy. I spent 30 years. not enjoying life. and making it miserable.
- Hang on! - Daddy! Daddy! - Hold on! - Give me the tiller! - Tuck it under the handle!
You have to leave. Take your daughter and get away from all this. I've been running my whole life. There's no end to it. If they come near my house, I'll defend it.
We could stay here for hours! My poor little granny! Why do you say that? Because of this shack! But we can always tear it down!
- What is it? - Hawaii. A change of scenery. I think I've kept you here too long, and I apologize. But during your week's vacation, I'll be doubling your medication. Don't forget to take it, and I promise these episodes will soon be a thing of the past.
- Hey, hey! Hang on, we're entering a turbulent zone. Dima! I think we're lost. The GPS says we have to pass a bail bondsman and a wig store. These morons who work for me leave me a mountain of shit and tell me to turn it into roses.
What a bad idea. Your instavitation has been sent to the entire galaxy! Uh-oh. "Uh-oh" indeed! Our enemies, the Gorgs, will receive it and will be able to use it to spot us!
Next! What if we hacked the fugitive boov's email and canceled his instavitation... Or we could hack into the fugitive boov's email and cancel his instavitation to... What were you saying? So the Gorgs don't get it.
What if we hacked the fugitive boov's email and canceled his instavitation... Or we could hack the fugitive boov's email and cancel his instavitation to... What were you saying? So the Gorgs don't get it. So the Gorgs don't get it!
We need his password, or we'll all be wiped out by the Gorgs! Find it for me! That Boov's made his last mistake. Tra-la! You were supposed to fix it!
So insecure and so... Robin Why did you leave me Nia I didn't leave you here. I left you with Ben's torch and I found it in a fucking cave.
I'd love to, but the recipe's gone. You and Plankton stole it. No, we didn't. It's gone. We're putting together a team to find it.
Let's tiptoe. Stop with the mini-piano! You'll get us spotted. Sorry, folks. Reach out and grab it.
It's no use, Plankton. Krabs knows all your plans. He searched my hard drive for the recipe. I never got it. But we'll get it back.
Deflate it a little. Are we building our machine here? Yes. We've got everything we need. A photo booth, a cuckoo clock... some old chips. Now all we have to do is build it.
- Shut up! Shut up! It'll be a disgrace. You have to stop. Stop what? I had that rope unhooked. Reese, you saw me unhook it.
- Aerated titanium. This has the same kinematic physical properties and weight balance as human bone. We bubble argon through it. But tensile strength like an aircraft fuselage. The eye is probably the single most complex component of the human body, but with this device, we're able to convert a hemispherical, fish-eye image into a flat representation that allows a computer to see it, just as we do...
- For the sensation? Perhaps. Or microcharging. Small vibrations contain potential energy. If instead of dampening this energy, we store it in the capacitor
Perhaps. Or microcharging. Small vibrations contain potential energy. If instead of absorbing this energy, we store it in the capacitor, we can convert it into electrical energy, or a robot could become self-sufficient.
The woman has a child. You can tell right away. The bank has a house. Stop paying your taxes and see whose house it is. You rent it to the state.
There's a song. At least one, or part of one, but she knew absolutely nothing about it. - And you can't listen to it? - I have no idea. She might be tearing it to shreds as we speak.
- And? - And I refused. You did? Why did you refuse? When there's a fork in the road, you follow it.
I'm organizing it. She's in a meeting. Can I help you? Jules got her Saint Laurent jacket dirty. At the photo studio, they'll clean it.
How can I help you? Jules got her Saint Laurent jacket dirty. At the photo studio, they'll clean it. - Where's the jacket? - She's wearing it.
After the successful attacks in Hamburg and Tunisia, the unsuccessful attack in Mexico City, and the death of our late colleague, Marco Sciarra, leaves his task unfinished. Signor Guerra, the Pale King must be executed. Will you be making the trip to Altaussee? Of course, my loyalty to the organization is total. I'll protect it to the death.
One of his agents stole it to blackmail him for profit. And kept it in a secure computer room. He died during interrogation to extract the access code. Leaving Lane with a serious problem. So the key to destroying Lane is in a computer waiting to be taken.
And kept it in a secure computer room. He died during interrogation to extract the access code. Leaving Lane with a serious problem. So the key to destroying Lane is in a computer waiting to be taken. And why didn't Lane send someone to steal it?
Don't do that! I'm gonna... Ugh... I'm taking the car! Well, I'm taking it back!
-Let's get off this train! We've got to get them out too. The keys... Open the damn door! -Quick, barricade it!
You need patience. You need the big picture. I don't have the big picture. I only have a small image. I take it out and look at it, every day.
It is downloaded into the body. Where is it? The real power is in the Nacelle. The stone, its power is uncontrollable. You can't just destroy it.
The real power is in the Nacelle. The stone, its power is uncontrollable. You can't just destroy it. You must get the Pod to Stark. First we have to find it.
I'm gonna miss you, Tony. You will? It's time for me to retire. Maybe I should take a cue from Barton. Build Pepper a farm and hope nobody blows it up.
When do we go for a ride? Car's still on the fritz, buddy. I haven't had time to work on it. And I don't have the money or the parts I need. Maybe you should sell it.
Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you. How much for the car, kid? It was my father's. I'm gonna keep it.
I tried to leave. When did you leave? When my mother died. When she died, I found my father's old car in the garage. She never told me she had it. She was afraid I'd decide to sell it to try to get her out of trouble.
When she died, I found my father's old car in the garage. She'd never told me she had it. She was afraid I'd decide to sell it to try and get her out of the shit. So... she kept it a secret. She wrote me a letter. She asked me to fix it and get it running again so I could go away... somewhere...
You think it's funny?! Give me the combination. They're either dumb or deaf! What's the combination? I don't know it.
This is the latest twist in the case of serial killer Calvin Diehl, nicknamed the Angel of Debtors, who has killed or, according to him, "helped to die with dignity" some fifty people since the 1980s. Each of his victims was asked to sign an "authorization to kill", along with a farewell letter to their loved ones. "Dear Ben, Michelle, Libby and Debby, I doubt this letter will find you, but Mr. Diehl has promised to keep it.
I'm not sure either. Does anyone understand? We're very sensitive to the government's concerns, Judge, about this Pandora's box. But each country is different and sets different conditions, unlike, for example, Cuba, in the case of Austria, there is a treaty, so there is no dispute as to what type of law should apply. We advise you to open the box and extract just one small worm with a pair of tweezers, then close it quickly.
Let's review. These are DARPA documents. It could very well be true. No ? It could be. Let's build it!
What if we sold the idea to a multi-billionaire? First of all, we didn't invent anything. We assembled a machine according to blueprints. It's not Ikea furniture. We can't sell it.
He launched a TV channel. Fox Television. Before that, he had run 20th Century Fox, among other studios. He bought a small cable channel here in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He hired me to run it and develop it.
I told him about a project Dad and I have. Right? Yes, that's right. Do you have any idea how much your idea will cost? How you'll sell it or to whom?
So, five bags... that's 40... Will you let me know? Yeah, listen... The flour's in the cellar. Go and get it.
"Son, I love you." "I love you too, Dad." There's a good reason for my visit. I've been stealing from people since I was nine, so I've amassed a nice little fortune. I want to do something good with it. I want to give it to you, son.
One team deploys on the field for defense, while the other takes turns hitting the ball with a stick. How are you going to name this game? By the only possible name! Le Gourdin Frappe-Balle. The pitcher's aim is to throw the ball to me twice without me being able to hit it.
I sent her, and she knocked his tooth out! What a jerk! Mom. Anyway, I've still got a bottle left from that crate. I'll get it and we'll have a drink to that ugly wife and son.
Then they should be able to retrieve the droid. Intact. Careful, Ren, that your personal interests don't conflict with Leader Snoke's orders. I want that map. For your own good, I suggest you find it.
Most of them. Others are different. BB-8 is on a secret mission. He needs to get to your base. Apparently, he has a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone wants it.
He would have disappointed you. Get out of my head. I know you've seen the map. It's in your head. And you're going to give it to me.
No, madame. My body feels like cotton. I've given you a dose of opium. Have you finished? I still have to clean the wound and suture it.
They ask for tap water. They wear suits. They're polite. But be careful. They may place a fork on the floor, under the table to see if you notice, and they won't drop it because it would be noisy and too easy.
He burned them alive. You want to save Buddy? There's only one way. See that mountain? We'll blow it up and mine the money.
You want to save Buddy? There's only one way. See that mountain? We're gonna blow it up and mine the money. We'll dig it up, we'll blow it up from the inside.
We have to change cars. They'll come after us. This is the place. It belongs to a farmer, a friend of Felix's. Felix wanted to buy this car, but he refused to sell it.
Fasten your belt by inserting the metal end... into the buckle. A little at first, just to titillate the buckle. Want a little? Take that buckle. Take it...
- You want to tell me what's going on? - Sorry, it's very personal. You entered into an agreement to publish your autobiography in order to "share your story with the world." It's unauthorized. Well, I guess you're going to read it anyway.
- Hi, there. - Where's your hat? - What cap? - Your pilot's cap. Oh, right. I... don't like to wear it when I'm not flying.
I see you're more observant than I am. And his shoes are classy, but worn. That must be Dr. McMichael. He came in his new car to pick me up. Why don't you come look at it?
Don't... The gun! Pick it up! Pick up the gun, damn it! - Pick it up!
Deep down, somewhere, I didn't want to believe it. But she's dead. Dear Greg, I heard about your homework and the University of Pittsburgh. So I wrote them a letter to convince them to take you back. I kept a copy if you want to read it.
Right, guys? But if that's what you're convinced of, if that's what you believe in your heart of hearts, then... you're just a bunch of dickheads! Good for you. Life's all about second chances, isn't it? If your second chance shows its dick, grab it!

We solve our own problems. I like that. I'm in. And I want to change my shirt. I've been wearing it for three days and it's garish.
Human history is defined by war, and war by the men who wage it.
Yes. You were always a bum, Antoine. An imitator at best. This rage of despair suits you like a glove. The key to success... is in your mind, and you're going to give it to me.
It's true, you were on a boat. A refugee ship. It was sunk by terrorists. Why can't I feel my body? Mira, your body was damaged, we couldn't save it.
I'll get it. Wait! Wait! Wait! Major, stop! I've heard this speech before from your competitors. - And now Hanka Robotics is serving it up...
C'est la vie. You're late! Right on time, boss. They force their way in, smash our faces in, and seize the only device capable of causing a power shift. So, how do we get it back?
That's an elaborate way of saying he bought you a new mode of transportation. The world has come a long way since you died, Cage. Built-in drones, anti-aircraft countermeasures and fuel tanks big enough to fly over the planet three times without needing to land. You can put your coat in the checkroom. Believe me, no one will dare steal it.
X takes care of his team. This better be a joke. We failed. Xander, Marke's activated the satellite. It's heading our way. I'll have to destroy it kamikaze-style.
You can't imagine how grateful I am that you're taking the trouble to help us again. I have no problem with that. Perfect. Same procedure as usual. We'll spend the night here, then in the morning we'll collect it, distribute it to the other branches and pay it out to the farmers who come to cash their cheques.
What did I expect? It's crazy, one day you're so sure of yourself, the next... Are you hungry? Because there's a tray of sausage rolls coming up. Grab it.
I always wanted to sing in a nightclub. Fiction writer. Now I run a café. Bina took over the café from her family. I was persuaded to run it after our wedding, just as she wanted.
You can have them. Oh, Sam, you're breaking hearts all over the place. Am I breaking yours, Mr. Daimler? Do I what? Your heart, do I break it?
- Where is it? - Under the table! I love rats. Yes. Get him, Bailey!
I really missed Hannah. Ethan missed her too. I could feel it. Ethan, I made you a sandwich. I'll put it in the back seat.
The sword can only be raised by Uther Pendragon or his direct descendant. You felt it, didn't you? That power. That's what knocked you out. You don't know how to control it.
You're incapable of doing it. You're finally showing a little imagination. - What did you do to her, Jack? Where did you put your knife? Throw it over there.
We're ready. Open the door to the terraforming bay. Opening airlock. Walter, send her to airlock 18. Don't shoot if you can avoid it.
The breath of Life. She's my Spirit. Love is supposed to exist within a relationship, Mack. It's everything we'd like to have with you. Even if you can't see it.
Don't open it. Don't look at it. Don't touch it. Don't even think about it. Just put it away and forget about it.
I can give you my number. I'll give you my number. Yes. I'll give you my phone... If you'd like to hold it for me - and I'll contact you...
Listen, once you're there, you'll be like my money man, my henchman. - Yes, I will. - It's important that you're always on my right. And I want you to hold the bag. When I come for the money, you give it to me.
I won't pay the workmen. But I can pay you to forget about it. If the workers don't get their money by the end of the film, your life will be over. Got it? Just put it down there.
Woo! "Look! We've got the diamond! And we're going to... Take it to the AVL and get our jobs back!
- No, you don't! - Yes, I do. - Give it to me. - No, you don't! - Give it to me!
We hope for a unicorn and we get a goat. Well, you know what? Lucky is the best goat in the whole world! Look at that face! I just want to squeeze it.
The toilets are at the back, and no mess. Ah, the control room. The eyes and ears of the whole building. We've set up a little corner for you in the back. Make it your own in your spare time, okay?
- A now useless module. On the surface, yes. But if he wanted to take it away from us, he must have a reason. Take another look at this module. Tear it apart.
Never mind. Look, look, look! It's the guy from the other night. Find anything? Whatever I find, I'm keeping it!
Billy, are you listening to me? Billy, what are you doing? Billy! Where's the crystal? Come on, Billy, find it.
Onwards and upwards! Stay the course. We've done this before. Dear Billy. Have you ever looked at a hurricane and thought, "What if I go through it?"
There are others. What do you mean, "others"? This world was never ours. It was theirs. The question is: when will they take it back?
So, what's the worst you can do? Reveal your worst secret. Because... if you reveal it and it turns out your friends would rather not know, you can't take it back. You can't take it back. Once you've opened your heart, you can't close it again.
I won millions of pounds. For myself, for those present and for millions of strangers. Works that I subsidize would not exist without me. If life is a balance sheet - and I think it is - I seem to have a positive balance! But I have a peculiarity that needs to be... controlled. I've got a problem. And there's only one way to solve it.
Yes, I'm John Watson. Dr. Watson. - I love his blog. - His blog? - Don't you read it?
She follows her routine. 2 more minutes. - She puts the vacuum cleaner back. - What's the big deal? She'll be safer when she puts it away.
Sherringford? Forget it. Forget what? Sometimes in these waters, we get that message. Forget it.
Move the plane away from populated areas. - It must crash into the sea. Obviously, she's going to crash it. No. Let's help her land it.
And the worst is yet to come. Francis Francis, CEO of Toutou Co, made this statement. Teddy, throw out the clip. We will, on schedule, release the most adorable puppy ever. We'll launch it at the Toutou Show in Las Vegas.
Here it is! The file! See, I was right! I saw this somewhere. We need to replace it with something else. I agree.
Way to go! Go for it, Tim! Launch engaged. I'm launching my Eternal Puppy. And there's nothing you can do about it! Baby Corp stole all my love and I'm going to take it back.
And that's when I came... to a profound revelation. My innate desire to seek life elsewhere... Was not so much to be able to walk with these life forms. Peter... I've found the meaning. I see it.
Come down to earth, give your opinion, baby. I just think... maybe Lauren doesn't need the distraction, I mean, maybe you just need to let her feel alone instead.... There you go. There's a rag here, you'll need to push it into the drain hole if you're going to take a bath.
You act like nothing happened. That's fucked up. What do you want me to do, cry for the rest of my life? No, you can't tell me how to deal with this. I was there, I was there for everything, I was there to remind her what her catheter was, every time she tried to pull it out and I was there to rock her when she was in pain,
Hello. Did you get my message? No, I didn't get your message. I sent you one. Tell your wife, Darren.
Tell your wife, Darren. Phil. I gave Dougie your coffee. I'm sorry, Phil. He really wanted it.
I'll tell you what I'm thinking. We're sinking in the mud and the fuckers are at it again! Still the same vast global industrial conspiracy. One day follows another. You need a cosmic lamp to see it.
Please tell me. I need to know. I'm fine. Good for you. I don't know what's going on, but I know we've got a problem, and I need you to be in a position to help me solve it.
I need a drink. And you're going to join me, I hate drinking alone. Your glass. At the monastery, Brother Kuo... harvested plums every summer to make wine. He hid it in big clay pots, and fermented it all winter in the bell tower.
Sorry, folks. Most people are just passing through. I need information about the factory, the guards, and the woman who runs it, Gao. I've got the money. The only fool dumber than the one who wants information about this witch is the one who gives it to her.
It looks like the tattoo on your chest. What's your connection to these people? I don't have a connection. It's a sacred symbol of K'un-Lun. Gao gives them the finger and puts it on his poison.
Your father? Look, it's too complicated for you to understand. Try me. That's the trap. And he knows it.
- You need stitches. - Airport? We're going home. No. The passage to K'un-Lun is open, and you're not here to protect it.
All the more reason to get out of town as soon as possible. We're not leaving. Yet. The passage won't stay open. If we miss it, it'll take years to get back.
As if emotions didn't exist. A gun has no feelings. Danny should be back by now. His chi may be more damaged than we thought. Master Lei Kung will be able to repair it when Danny returns to K'un-Lun.
I never want to work anywhere else. I told Carolina's mother. I let your salary slip. - Mom! Mom! Mom! - What's up? It's fun to slip it into conversation.
Order confirmed. - What's this? - He's completed his mission. The medallion... is honored. Mark it.
- The biggest mistake of my life. Did more harm than good. Hello. Thanks for waiting. Can you sign it on behalf of Tony?
One more time. I can't find my DVD. It's right here, honey. No. You come and get it.
It wasn't his death she was talking about. I tried to dissuade her. But you know how stubborn Diane can be about some things. I called M.I.T. Shankland is thrilled to be publishing with you.
She was mad at you. But something good came out of it, Evelyn. She needs you now. You're perfect for the job. Take it.
Just a minute. On the "front" of what? Sir, this is the proof we need. You've got to find out where they're making this gas. You have to burn it to the ground.
You mean Ludendorff. No. I mean Ares. Ludendorff is Ares! Sir, this is our last chance. Our very last chance to find out where the gas is and how Ludendorff plans to spread it.
- No way. - Yeah! Whatever it takes to make it work! That's the Cuban spirit. That spirit, never lose it.
Means using a free relay. Look at these two. Which means it has an amount of decomposition synchronization. Which we can reverse. And follow it back to the original source and find Dom's true location.
Your family has already been replaced. You picked the losing team. I guess your brother's smarter than you. Clever to have integrated the Eye of God into the mainframe. All this way to get it.
How I do it in 10 seconds. What's wrong Roman, did you forget the snow tires? You like your Lambo now? Okay, everybody, let's get together and launch a missile later. Now, I want that submarine in deep water, where no one can find it.
- You gave it to me. - Callate. Give me 4,000 for the crate, the window and the garage. And take the dog, because the story of the niña, it touched me. - I don't have that kind of money. - Then I'll kill you. I can find it.
Well, he's back. And Delaney's will leaves him everything. Including Nootka. Do we have a copy of the Nootka Sound treaty? Or could our lawyers retrieve it?
He must surface, Sir Stuart. And, uh... I believe only the original exists. So our long negotiations with the girl were in vain. If the will hasn't been read, and Nootka is so strategic to us, why not... burn it?
No. Listen... go to this address, okay? There'll be a man with scars on his face to meet you... he'll take you to my friend Atticus. Tell my friend Atticus where Helga is. Write your report... he'll protect it and keep you safe.
You must have forgotten it. I've got somebody's wallet. I don't know where it came from. Let me see it. It's not your wallet. Shall I take it to the authorities?
The bill must be here somewhere. Do sit down. I can't take any more of my absences. In that case, you could take your medication again. I don't want to take it anymore, Mom.
Did you think I wouldn't find out? - Did they tell you? - Of course they told me. It's my bank card, Diwata. I don't work myself to death every night at the hospital for you to take this money and throw it out the window.
Yeah We win Yeah How do you solve a problem like Maria? How do you catch a cloud and bring it down?
Because it's in my name, and it's my social security number. It's probably an account problem. Or identity theft, but they usually take money. Not the other way around. Whoever put that money in your name knows you well enough to have thought you'd never find out.
That's why your firm's equipment will remain in FBI hands and the investigation will stay open until we catch my man. Or should I say your man? I hope he's worth it. Ben's number is blocked. I can't trace it.
I can feel where I am. - What are you, a dog? I've been smoking for centuries. Stay back. - Okay, take it.
I'll say it again. Since the attack, the British have become much more attentive. The last show is at the Singhghat camp. From there, we'll be able to grab the chest and take it across the river to the other side. So why not hide it in your ambulance?
I'm not working on it. We're working on it. You were right about that pilot who jumped. He had a second apartment. There's no way he could have afforded it.
It's just pictures, but... I can't describe what it felt like. Flood. Fire. Cremation. It wasn't in the video before. For primitive cultures, the only way to free a soul is to burn the body when you find it.
Do you want to starve them? They used to fast. Forty days. Not out of piety, out of necessity. Hunger was a form of prayer, but they were never hungry. They take a dish from the freezer and put it in the microwave.
It must be a success. I'm ready for it. I want this. And I know you need it. I believe you, but... it's hard to sell with just your name on the poster.
Nina's smart. They could offer Jordan the part of Ed. Bring me a gun. Maybe he won't get it. We both know that if Jordan wants it, he'll get it.
- Thanks. I work at LDM if you have a script. O.. Yes, I do, yes. Great, great. Send it to me.
That's my opinion. I don't think it's the most honorable industry ever. Now I'm working on my website. I want to keep doing that. AUBREY GOLD ACTRESS But if anything else comes along, that would be cool too. I'd like to hire people to do it for me, so I don't have to do it anymore.
- Need a lift? - Where to? It's okay, it's okay. I've got my bike. Put it in the trunk.
I don't know about that. But I'll help you. Hey, girls. I didn't know you took pictures. It's a contrast project, so we have to do it at night. That's why I'm sleeping over.
The show's over. Class dismissed! Where are you going, Clay? Where's my bike? I'm gonna keep it for a while.
No. We'll communicate by sign. I know you think I'd laugh, but... Where's your bike? I wrecked the crankset, so Tony's going to fix it for me.
Okay, girls, let's go! Maybe you don't know what it's like to be on the sidelines, Zach, like most of us. You can't understand why a little piece of paper matters so much. Everyone, before we left, we added an anonymous chat bag to the lockers. We'll bring it up every Friday for discussion.
What happened? I don't get it. Still don't. Welcome to the world. I hate it.
- Come on! - No! Sheri, stop. I had to find a phone. I wish I'd found it sooner.
Clay, about this trial... Can we not talk about this every morning? The subpoenas are coming. Who else is getting one? I'm not allowed to tell you.
Hi, Helmet. I know, I got your text. I don't know. I don't know. I'll give you a call. I can pick him up.
I can pick him up. I've got errands to run. I don't mind. - Thank you for your time. - I could have mailed it.
And this... records onto my parents' tapes? Yes, like a memo on your cell phone, but much more stylish. What kind of project is this? Something stupid. - Can I keep it for a few days?
This peace with the Saviors is painful. But it is peace. I must preserve it. I must try. Even if the Kingdom cannot offer you help, the King sympathizes with your plight. I offer asylum to our friend Daryl, for as long as he wishes.
Did you get yoghurt? No. That wasn't on the list. I eat it all the time. Then you should have put it on the list.
Where are you? On my counter, Morty. You're invisible and you're going to fart on me? Turn the pickle over. What, I'm gonna touch it, you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.
I'll give you the combination. That money belongs to the people. Shut up and call me a helicopter, asshole! Do we have a deal?! Take this money, give it to Jaguar's daughter when you set her free.
I'm just a ghost train conductor. You, you're a pile of insignificant insects that [ bleep ] my wife! [It's a three-pointer. Where's the main [ bleep ] wire? You always put it in the weirdest place.
It's not what I say, but... the beard suits you. The book! Where's the book? No, it's not ready. He's going to destroy it.
Her resentment's too deep, she has to burn. Felicity... The greatest obstacle in the world is love. It's always in your heart. She fills it.
You're the only one in my heart. Only me? Your headband belonged to Miss Duan. The memory haunts him, so he takes you for her. - You can tell by his smile.
What are you doing? - Give me back the headband. - Leave it alone. It doesn't suit you. You look terrible. - If it's like that, take it.
People were stealing them. Anyway, he's looking for something, and he tears out a page. It's a public directory, for everybody. So I told him something. Can I see it?
That's so negative. We weren't talking about your butt, honey. What was I thinking? We'll never get Burt Lurdsman if your chi is this blocked. Okay, so how do I unblock it?
I won. He spent his life watching trash piss on his shoes. So I went up to him and said, "That's enough, now. Let's forget this silly quarrel." And I gave him the frame, but he was furious and tried to give it back to me, we got into a fight, and the frame broke.
Oh, good, good. I just needed the file, Mr. Greenburg. For the shredder. Oh, no worries. I can do that.
- What did you just say? - You can hear me. Delete the recording. You're really something, Mathison. I have to give it to you.
My team. What's up? What's going on? Give me the headlines. The van carrying the bombs... Sekou was driving it.
Shit, I didn't know what was going to happen. I mean, the explosion, I still can't believe it. Because the recording cleared it up, it's important evidence for the bombing investigation. I told the FBI I wouldn't say where it came from and I won't, but...
How did you get it? I don't know. There's a third party involved. There's a third party involved. I don't know who it is. But whoever it is, they came and brought it to my office.
Some have died for it, have you forgotten? Last year... I moved his remains in great secrecy from the Kharavan cemetery to Behesht-e-Zahra. The resting place of the martyrs. I chose a lovely shady spot... in a pine forest. I can draw you a map to help you find it.
It's a dream path. Is it? You can leave now. You can't keep that. The microphone, no problem. But the player, can I have that back?
Start with this. We have an agreement. You see the problem. Your cooler's leaking. - Can you fix it?
Got it. You brought your book. It's Matt's. But it's about you. Will you finally read it?
You said we'd be at Miracle on the 14th. We will be. We'll be back. But an exceptional man needs to be here with us. He's in Melbourne and because of this explosion, he's stuck in Australia. God has placed an obstacle, but He wants us to overcome it.
No, for me. It's a dangerous drug. That's what makes it cool. My lighter. Can I have it back?
I was too young to understand the rules, so I watched spectators throw a beach ball at each other. The whole stadium got into it. When the ball came towards us, you stood up and kicked it. It was the first time I'd seen you smile. Then the ball fell into the aisle. An usher ran over and picked it up. And he crushed it to deflate it.
Are you going to stay? I'm afraid I can't. No, wait. Wait. I've got your lighter. You can keep it, I've stopped.
Identity confirmed. Perfect. Now, your penis. - I beg your pardon? - Your penis. Place it on the other scanner.
I wasn't in the campaign office at the time. I go running every morning at 6 a.m. right after prayer. I've never missed either since I've been in Washington. Show me your route. We'll see if we can confirm it.
Are you all right, Mr. Harris? Your hand. I, uh... I dropped a beaker. I cut myself picking it up.
Now that his son has obtained this list of sleeper cells, how long will it be before they strike? It's safe to assume that the cells are ready for action. Attacks may already be underway. I'll talk to the President in ten minutes. He'll want a worst-case scenario, so let's do it.
Don't do that. Hands behind your head and go over there. Hands behind your head now. You've got a gun in your belt. Put it on the ground and slide it towards me, slowly.
Gabriel entrusted me with some money. He's disappeared. Kill him. Ben and I fought together, and I took an oath. I won't do it.
And he's got my brother. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. And if I bring him someone to fix the list, then he'll let them go. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're... you're not asking me to fix the disk? I'm asking you to help me destroy it.
Crap. Is something wrong? This isn't easy. I have to make the virus undetectable. If Jadalla and his men discover it before he's finished erasing the disk, we've failed.
Did you follow me? Tell me what you're doing. We're looking after Jadalla Bin-Khalid. Jadalla's disk is damaged. He asked me to bring him someone who could repair it, and he...
You just relax. I'm not going to shoot you. It was a decoy. The real USB key is safe. And now that Hamid knows where the virus is, he'll be able to deactivate it.
I was going to call you. Uh... My wife decided to stay home, so I won't be able to see you tonight. We're sending you a link, Mr. Grant. Please open it.
The manager can see you after 11:00 pm. Good. That's plenty of time to write a speech. But I don't... I don't want to do it from here.
Just listen. The phone's asking me for a four-digit code. It must be an encryption lock. All right, what can we do? I can try to bypass it.
All right, what can we do? I can try to get around it. How long is this going to take, Andy? I don't even know if I can do it. Simms' phone is encrypted, but if I can unlock it, Senator Donovan can call the cleanup crew and try to stop them.
- It's called a cremation, and no, he'll be buried next to your grandmother. - Grandpa would have loved a Viking funeral. Viking? - Yes, that's right, he loved that kind of thing. We could put him on his boat and set fire to it before pushing it out to sea.
When we have nightmares about BPO, it's usually about him. Where can I find him? You've got guts, kid. I might be able to find that for you. But be careful, you'll probably have to pay the price. I'll pay it.
Missing since the end of the quarter. Could be consistent with the condition of the body. The contents of the wallet are soggy. This, though. It's not engraved, but someone might recognize it.
A little change is good for you. Give me one of Russian scientist Yuri Gradenko's unexpected defeat by the computer JASON in a game of chess at Lovelace. Professor Amory, from the Oxford team, predicts that within a generation few compartments of the intellect will remain alien to the machine, and that the problems associated with creating artificial intelligence will be solved. We're not even close to finding this bastard, and now everyone knows it.
- Yes, no more external communications. No, it's an independent system. Can we run diagnostics from here? The transmitter has failed. But we have to go outside to reactivate it and re-establish contact with Earth.
It's all my fault. It's all my fault. Maybe it's your fault, maybe it's your fault, maybe... It doesn't matter, does it? Bringing that thing aboard was a risk and we knew it all along.
Unless someone...someone, the inside pilot. I'll use the oxygen candles to lure Calvin and get to the A boat. I'll close the porch and you push the button so I have manual control. If I can hold the stick, I can hold the handle to maneuver. And if I hold it long enough, it will prevent entry into the atmosphere.
Derailed again? - Yeah. You ever gonna fix that bike? What do we do now? - Fix it, please.
I'm almost out of battery. Go away! Mamma mia! What's wrong with it? Recharge it later!
I'm here now. I'm okay. I'm okay. If you hurt her... Good God, H.G., the role of hero really isn't in your toolbox, is it? - I mean it, John.
I guess it's something from my future. Why didn't you write more in that letter? Believe me, I racked my brains. I needed to convince myself to trust Vanessa, but there's a danger in knowing her future. You might be tempted to change it.
We'll have to wait a little, but I promise. Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Wait, wait, wait. - My green sweater is at your place. - Leave it there.
How does she know that poem? Grandma, what do you sing? This is my favorite record. O Sahiba... Can I see it?
- Oh, yeah. Better than ever. - That's the victim's skull. - Yeah. Angela just finished scanning it so she can do the facial reconstruction.
Well, there's no flesh or clothing, but thanks to my esteemed colleague, John George Haigh, I'm able to estimate how long our victim had been in the acid. John George Haigh? You mean the acid-bath murderer? The one and only. So, George found that it takes 48 hours to completely dissolve a body to the point where you could actually pour it down the drain
I'm just saying marriage is a crazy idea. I don't know why anyone does it.
Mellie, listen to me... I'm not running for President anymore! I'm not running! They stole my phone out of my purse. - I want it back.
Any other messages? Before I hacked into the server, someone else came in and manually deleted a message from the toll-free number. What does it say? We don't know yet. I'm trying to get it back.
I have no regrets. If you're watching this, it means you're doing well. I wish I could be with you, but as you now know, I didn't have much time. I made my choice. I don't regret it.
Why would he need money? His parents... They cut him off. Noel was broke. And he wasn't about to share it so he lured me back to my old school to get rid of me too.
Come and meet me. Come and meet me. Hi, I'm Julie. We spoke on the phone. That's right, hello. I was worried you weren't going to make it before closing. Here's your scanner. Point it at the barcode of the item you want and voilà, it goes on your list.
Now it's my turn. You didn't sleep either? No, I've been waiting for that phone to start screaming again. You hid it? If Caleb finds it...
No, I waited until that phone started screaming again. You hid it? If Caleb finds it... No, I put it in my purse. He won't find it.
Technically, there's no "D" in anonymous, but whatever. I know what you mean. Are you sure this is serious? The post has been reblogged at least 500 times in the last half hour. And if Claudio Greco actually reads it.
Here it is. "Done." Your hands are much bigger than when you were a kid. They're a lot less purple, too. I can see why she wants to leave it there.
This is crazy. How do you know my schedule? I'm done talking. Let's go. Let's move it.
Hear that? It's like a buzzing sound, then a bunch of clicks. Yeah, trust me this thing makes all kinds of noises. I can't tell if it's mechanical or electrical. I can't get through a firewall and hack it.
I thought you said that. We've tried this a million times. Has it ever worked? It only has to work once. Hanna's dropping it off, so let's see who picks it up.
She knows the answer before we ask the question. We don't need your theories. You forgot who replaced the windshield after you removed Dunhill. You still want it. - I want it back.
Of course, of course. Well, I... I killed Archer Dunhill. I ran him over with a stolen car and buried his body in the woods. Later, I moved him to where I said you'd find him.
You have my venom. When can I leave? As soon as I know it's working. And when will that be? Believe me, you will be when you see it.
- Excuse me? "Ellen" doesn't suit you. It's too old-fashioned. - I've never liked it either. - Change it, then.
It was a thing of beauty. - That was so sexy. - I know it was. That was the point. I manage to pull my ID bracelet up my arm and hide it under my shirt. I walk past the guardroom and out the door.
It has no nutrients. It's an excess of calories. When you eat sugar, there's no immediate inflammation. You don't have plaques forming in your vessels. When you eat sugar, your body will store most of the glycogen, or burn it as calories.
Milk is a hormonal fluid, and goes hand in hand with sex hormones and natural steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone. It doesn't matter whether it's conventional or organic milk. Hormone-free milk is an oxymoron. Organic dairy products have just as much saturated fat, cholesterol and galactose, all the things you don't want, as conventional milk. Dairy products, in general, have many other associated products, not the least of which is pus. There are laws that limit the amount of pus tolerated in milk in order to sell it.
- the interview is over. I'm not going to start a discussion about... Oh no, I just wanted the studies showing if it's true, or that demonstrate it. Any diet works. Any diet works if people follow it.
Government advertising schemes for industry. More cheese in beef? More milk in coffee? Things that only increase consumption of these incredibly unhealthy products. McDonald's, for example, has six full-time staff, we're told, whose salaries are paid by this government program, but founded by the producers who regulate it.
He was right. I thought canines were for meat, but what kind of animal could kill and eat raw meat with those mini-tines? The thought alone was disgusting. I mean, everyone loves fruit smoothies and even some vegetables. But if you're thinking of putting fish or meat in a blender and pulping it, this idea is downright repulsive.
- I'm sorry, sir. Delicacy, all right. Show me. Like this. Wrap it gently with your thumbs.
When the light goes out, you follow. Come on. It would be so much easier if it was just you and me, like all the other times. Nothing's easy about this one. Tell me about it.
A lawsuit? Expensive. And very damaging to HHM's reputation. Not my preferred solution. Nor yours, I suspect. The firm could buy me out, but the amount would drive it into bankruptcy.
Really, yes. I'm fine, thanks. I'll take Mike's bag. Oh, don't worry. I'll get it tomorrow.
I hate to say it, but this file is full of dead ends. There's nothing in it. There has to be something. I don't want Paul to have died in vain, but this file needs to be seen in a new light. Read it for yourself.
Is there a plan B? Make plan A work. Upper deck clear. Where'd that thing go? Can't see it.
Where did that thing go? I don't see it. I don't see it either. Naomi? We just saw it behind the container near a bulkhead on the lower deck, aft.
Abandon the undersecretary and you're good to go. Repeat that. We've got Mao's little racing boat on the other dock. Hand over Avasarala unharmed. You and the Martians can take it and go.
Yes ? Yes. I'm warning you. Don't come any closer. I swear I'll block it for good.
Hold it steady. Got it. When I tell you, you take out the heart. Take it out now. Take it out now!
All I know is that, according to Gideon, the bikes Darhk and Merlyn stole are here. So we just need to ride around until we see a "this way" sign? Good idea. "Legends. This way." Subjugating the world to your rule isn't saving it.
Where, Cap? This is it. Get to the cargo hold. Ray, don't crash my ship. If you break it, you pay for it.
It's Butch Gilzean. Really? His file says his real name is Cyrus Gold. Cyrus Gold? He must have changed it at some point.
I really like that. You weren't kidding when you said you were hard to pin down. It's child's play with you. It's cool. I can take it.
It's the Special Forces. Special Forces? Like Green Beret? You have one too? - Do you want to see it?
And I couldn't have been prouder. My son honored that commitment. He made the ultimate sacrifice. And I honor his memory by wearing this uniform. Just as you honor the memory of every officer who gave his life in the line of duty. Wear it with pride.
Lots of tattoos. What should we do? Give Cynthia the phone? No, no, no, listen, I want you to call me from this phone, so I have the number. Then delete the call and put it back, okay?
Back to work. Very nice. Very nice. Councilwoman, thank you so much for coming. From what I've heard, you do the trick. But given your poor political capital, you're really making an interesting choice about how you spend it.
I mean, aside from the fact that he is, why? I don't know. I mean, he said she confronted him about it, and he fixed it, but she's not going to let it go. What are we going to do? Hack into his computer and... find out what's on it and delete it.
- Thank you. - Thank you for your time. What happens next? You mean, what do I do with your secret? Keep it.
This computer shows that 80 million roubles are being transferred from Kovar's account to the account Gregor controls. Yes, we know. To be divided between the Bratva captains. It also shows that 40 million rubles were transferred to Kovar, which Gregor never mentioned. Open it up.
Do you think you and Prometheus had the same teacher? You accept the invitation to join Helix. All the way. What are you doing with your secret? Keeping it.
But first, I have a gift for you. Your tattoo. Being an American and named captain at Bratva, you must have done something extraordinary. When you look at it, it must remind you of a victory. Now, when you look at it, you'll remember the time we spent together and the secret you told me.
The pixelation algorithm is encrypted. I should have known it would be encrypted, but it is encrypted. How long would it take you to break the encryption? If I'm not mistaken, (3.1610^18)(E^6)(75 teraflops)... 13 months. I know someone who can break it faster.
If I'm not mistaken, (3.1610^18)(E^6)(75 teraflops)... 13 months. I know someone who can break it faster. Kord Industries. They created encryption. They can break it.
How's it going out there? Every defense lawyer in town has just discovered that the D.A. is a serial killer, and therefore evil. Do you think the court will overturn Chase's conviction? If they didn't, I wouldn't have called this council of war. It would be nice to have a mayor preside over it.
Felicity, I trust you. Fair enough. Is this the painkillers talking? If you've got a plan that'll get us out of here, fantastic. Let's finish this and give it a try.
The chemicals Sampson stole are more refined than Justin Claybourne's and could produce a biological agent a thousand times more powerful. - And without a cure. - How could Chase spread it? It's in aerosol form, so more or less any way he wants. We need to find out where Chase has stored this stuff and stop him before he releases it.
Their life, my life is better because you decided to become Green Arrow. Well, when you decide to become Green Arrow again. I know you're right. I think you're right, but every time I move forward, I feel like the past is pulling me back. Probably because you let it.
No, I don't understand, but only because you're wrong. I told you, Oliver, everyone around you is suffering for your sins. And the only way to keep them from paying the price is to let me go. I'll find another way. Find it quickly.
And not in a normal way. He said if I took it off, it would hurt my kids a lot. I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it out without knowing how to break the spell. Even if it's dead, it could still be there. We'll find a way to break it.
First time I'd ever seen a dead man's grip. I saw those symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the fabric. Maybe we didn't see everything on the cloth. Do you always carry the stick with you? I'm not sure you should carry it all the time.
We're following your orders. You lied to me, doctor. You entered Eros. We found your colleague dead in the airlock. I forbade Dr. Kane to touch him, but he never listens.
I have to keep my finger on a button to keep it from turning off. Well, then... Make sure we didn't come all this way for nothing. Give me the transponder code. I'll bypass it from here.
Got it. Go ahead. You know those voices I hear, I think this thing has taken on, I don't know, consciousness, or some of what makes us human. It digests it, and spits it out in another configuration.
It's alien. Do you still want to destroy our sample? Yes. Now more than ever. Miller wanted to destroy it too, you know.
He wants to control it. Fred's trying to protect the belt. Or so he claims. It's too dangerous to leave our sample out there. We've got to destroy it.
Be sure to tell them that. Hi, Alex. What the hell are you doing? Fixing the Martian flag. You're defacing it, Picasso.
I don't have any more! I'd give you some. Do you have any gold? I had some, plenty. I was saving it for someone.
Therefore, she owes me the money I would have made, - plus interest. - Otherwise what? I would never hurt a woman. However, I think it would be justified to give the police enough evidence that your girlfriend can only talk to her mom every Thursday through a glass window for the next forty years. So, you give Maria the money, she gives it to me...
Hugo Strange, you're under arrest for attempting to turn a virus into... shit, you know why. Oh, don't do that. The delivery mechanism they plan to use to release the virus arrived recently. The shipment from Dock 9C. It's yet to be tested, which means you still have enough time to stop them unleashing it on the whole city.
The delivery mechanism they plan to use to release the virus has recently arrived. The shipment from Dock 9C. It's yet to be tested, which means you still have enough time to stop them unleashing it on the whole city. But of course, if they discover that their lab has been compromised... He's right, they could release it immediately.
Like you, she understood nothing. If she came to see you, the only thing she got out of it was that Mario was completely mad. Any last requests? My badge. If I die, I want to die wearing it.
It trains them. What I did with you, the Court has been doing with them for 200 years. But the process does more than remove feelings. Slice the little finger off your left hand. Should I ask her to eat it?
We arrested this guy 5 minutes ago. There's something else. What's this doing here? It's supposed to be in Lucius's office. He must have moved it.
It's Butch Gilzean. Really? His file says his real name is Cyrus Gold. Cyrus Gold? He must have changed it at some point.
You see, it's not fixed, so you can make the future whatever you want. - I agree. - Another group of fans totally disapproved of this vision. They said, "No, no, no. "The future is already written, and you can't change it no matter how hard you try."
I can't lose her, Cisco. Tell me you found a way to change the future. We found a way to change the future. Did we? No, but Caitlin and I found a way to map it.
Nothing abnormal. There must be a place where the necrosis is higher. Take a look! We've got less than fifty minutes before this body disintegrates into ash like the last one. - We've got to find it now. - I know we have to.
Is Grodd there? Why on Earth, any Earth, would your father want to go there? We received a mathematical cipher at our S.T.A.R. Labs. It was extremely complex. It took us a week to decode it, but Dad and I managed.
Slowly, slowly. Come on, now. Take it easy, take it easy. The... hand me the X-ray machine - Can you take it?
The... hand me the X-ray machine - can you take it? - Sure. Here, here. Okay, good. Take it out.
She's not breathing. We need to call an ambulance right away. H.R., get the crash cart. Cisco, get the oxygen. Roll it over here!
I didn't know it at the time, but looking back, I think that's when I fell in love. It was that night that we realized we needed each other. And... I wish I could take away your bad memories. I wish I could make the pain go away, but I can't. But what I do know is that for every bad memory, there's a good one... that will help you get through it.
What do I want? I want to fix my brother, I want to get rid of the devil, and I want my future with Elena. But I won't become human while she sleeps for decades. You don't have to take the cure right away. Enzo will take it from Cade, and then,
I want to fix my brother, I want to get rid of the devil, and I want my future with Elena. But I won't become human while she sleeps for decades. You don't have to take the cure right away. Enzo will take it from Cade, and then - you can take it from Enzo.
The messages don't make sense. "Today was a cold day. The harvest is plentiful." It's like there's a message within the message. If anyone can figure it out, my money's on you.
And yes. Why are you so interested in my family tree all of a sudden? I haven't been able to sleep lately, and I thought this would do the trick. What about you? Matt's been having visions because of this diary, and you're coming to get it.
What about you? Matt's been having visions because of this diary, and you've come to take it away. Coincidence? I don't think so. So why don't you tell us why you really want it.
What's he going to do with it? I don't know what he's gonna do with it. But if it saves my brother's life, I don't care. Sorry, folks. You can't give the devil what he wants if you don't know why he wants it.
I did. I realized I was an idiot. I'm intellectually challenged, maybe even blind. I couldn't see that everything I was looking for was there in you. I have a lifetime of work to do to make things better, but I can't imagine doing it without you.
Let's go. Listen, you have to keep going. I'm going to stay here and help Stefan. Help Stefan do what? Katherine took Elena's body, so I'm gonna help them find it.
Did you know they went from the Armory to the heart of Mystic Falls? I bet you didn't, did you? Do you really think Bonnie Bennett can magically draw fire through tunnels away from town? Even better. She thinks she can send it straight back to hell, where we'll both be waiting patiently.
With the quote from when you were arrested for driving under the influence. It doesn't take me near that lake where Carla drowned. Carla. You know something? I didn't even remember her name until I saw it in this file.
We're Lyons, so we roar. From then on, every employee of this company, their number one priority is to do everything possible to make Inferno what it should be. It's an album I'm producing. I'm going to have Empire's best artists on it, and I hope my son, Jamal, will bless me with this song. Seeing that the position of AR Director recently opened up, I decided to fill it with someone I feel is deserving of such a position.
Cut the music. Turns out your slimy father got a nasty virus and is bedridden. Probably nausea. - Mom - If we hurry, we can get a teaser out this week on Xtream before he finds out and blocks it.
I couldn't possibly. She told me not to tell you. Why would someone do that, Dad? I'll keep her phone in an unsealed bag. If anyone wants to see it, they'll have to go through me.
- Leah, seriously... - Please, daddy! Please don't be weird right now. That's my locker key. If Mom's computer is in there at the end of the school day, I can take it home without telling anyone.
I hate not being in control of my life. I go to bed when I want. A pyramid won't tell me what to eat. And I put on my gloves before I put on my coat. How do you close it?
Bore me with what it's all about. Luck is a river. You don't try to control it, you just go with the flow. Until you understand that, you can't control the bracelet, and that's when things go wrong, Harry. What's the point of having it if I can't control it?
- Hi. - Hi, Daisy. Come on, Daisy, you'll miss the beginning of the movie. She can't go anywhere without eyeliner. She doesn't know how to put it on.
I've seen experienced candidates barely finish a single term as president. You don't learn this job on the job. Let's see. It took all my internal resources to get back in the game, and there's no way I'm letting amateurs in diapers get me out again. There's a link between MacLeish and the shooter, and I'm going to find it.
You know, we're so busy, no one really looks at what anyone else is doing. Right? I guess so. Then he realizes he can't hide Lily-Anne's hair because it's already been spotted. So he waits until it gets here, in the sealing room, shows up and steals it.
We're your first line of defense. And when you're in too much trouble? Give me your cell phone number. Come on, I'll give you mine. Bill, trust me, just give it to me!
But not anymore. I don't feel like celebrating, so I'm skipping it. I bought you a present. Should I return it? You don't have to return it.
I bought you a gift. Should I return it? You don't have to return it. It was very thoughtful of you. I'll return it.
Someone's here with a cake for you. They're really insistent. Tell them I'm operating and I don't want it. Actually, you know what? Why don't you share it with the other nurses?
We're going to connect the two ends and graft the opposite iliac to avoid ischemia in the leg. We didn't maintain his mobility so that he would lose his leg. What about contamination of the perforated colon? We'll place a retroperitoneal graft. This will protect him from infection.
The studio system was on its last legs, and the only women hired had... big breasts and small brains. Is this documentary about all of us, or just Joanie? Is it like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood? I don't know, darling. Honey, I'm sure whoever sees it will love it.
Really? Call it loss aversion. How about now? Now what? We take this PPD and shove it up Chuck's ass.
Yes, it wasn't pleasant. Where did you hide it? The sound was clear, so not under cushions. Well hidden under a survival blanket. I couldn't have seen it, given the state of your house.
Yes, you did. You built Matty a carport as a kid. Did I? Yes, he often told me about it. When you asked for estimates, you called them all crooks. So you decided to do it yourself.
All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Lunch is served! Swim, baby. Catch it before it gets soggy.
What do you think? I can't thank you enough. I couldn't call my mother. I've spent 30 years building up a nest egg. I don't mind spending it on a friend.
He'll be giving us a presentation. - Welcome, Mr. Reeves. - Thank you, Mr. Mayor. - Before you begin, I'd like to say how sorry I am about this tragedy, and I'd like to... offer my condolences. Oh my God, I've heard this speech so many times, I know it by heart.
You've just described my life with you. So I've prepared you well to be a wife. And I'm going to miss you terribly. This marriage is something I can offer you. And if you want it, I want it to be perfect.
She played Scarlett O'Hara. Skeptically Do you want to do this movie, Bette, - or not? - I don't want to do it.
Skeptically Do you want to make this movie, Bette, - or not? - I don't want to make it. I want to do it right.
Switch off telephones and radios. Interference could set off the detonator. How do you intend to access the explosive? Wait, wait, wait! I can feel it, I can feel it.
Now you're going to help us find it. How did my team gain access to the building? You... programmed the servers to overheat, opening the air vents. And shut down the network. I want you to restart it.
Understand? Where are you? Are you all right? I'm far from all right. But I have a plan, and I need your help to carry it out.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. I talked to Scottie. She's fine, but she's on the run and doesn't want to be found. Hargrave wants the network up and running. She wants it off.
Of course you should. You should be. In fact, you're invited to the party. It's princess-themed, so I hope you're wearing a tiara. I wouldn't miss it.
My wife has never been so upset. I understand, and I sympathize. But you can't take your money out of the deal. I'm not taking my money out. I'm giving it to the prosecution.
There was a computer on the premises. It burned, but there might be footage in it. CHARLIE: We had it in our hands at the cabin, but unfortunately, the federal agents swiped it from us. Take it back then.
Don't you dare. That's what I'm doing, Olivia... My job. I'm protecting this office. No, you're destroying it.
I'll take care of it. It's going to take me a while, so don't wait up. Here are the groceries. Don't make the chicken. I'd like to do it when I get back.
Remember when the police found Keith's truck near our property, Mother? We can't take any chances. You're exaggerating. We're miles from the motel, and no one's found her. Because no one's been looking for her, and now they are.
Oh, I'm a poet. Okay, pour it, and I'll start mixing when you pour. There it is. It's mixing. We can bake it now.
And to take Charlie out for a nice dinner. Yeah, yeah, at least at the drive-thru. Oh! Thanks, guys. Love him. I'll, uh... I'm gonna take him for a spin!
This boy in high school started it. People got wind of it, he got a little funding, and wham. I mean, it was almost that big of a period. I just always thought it was so cool. Of course, I never got to see it, but...
I handled it a lot. I've thought about it too. However, there is one place where it would have been impossible for you to leave a thumbprint. Under the stamp. We had to peel it off gently, but a small part of the stamp had not been glued.
Only because he has you. You must be on the throne. You're a king, Cyrus. I can help you get what's yours. Do you want it?
I'm sorry, sir. You'll have to say that again. Nice and easy. Tom Larsen has confessed to the murder of Frankie Vargas. He'll testify that Cyrus ordered him to do it.
Little children, little problems. - Big kids... - I know, I know, I know. Sandra said... Remember Sandra? The problem with punching is that you have to punch back.
Centuries of peace and prosperity, where a Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, and a Stark served, as Guardian of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor your ancestor's oath. Submit, and I'll name you Warden of the North. Together, we'll save this country from those who would destroy it.
Golden roses. Your brother and his new queen thought you were going to defend Casterly Rock. The truth is, Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. It is to me, but my nostalgia won't keep Cersei on the throne. So you're going to let them take it?
The truth is, the Roc isn't worth much anymore. It is to me, but my nostalgia won't keep Cersei on the throne. So you'll let them take it, then? For the time being. They won't be able to keep it.
You see? -Pagamos our debts. Of course, except mine. Ser Bronn from Blackwater, come... no matter what you came pit, with a bag full of gold, complaining of not being paid. When we win, you'll pick a castle in the Seven Kingdoms no one to take it from you.
Let's go! Now! You're the fastest without the hammer. Give it! Give it!
To be the Lady of Winterfell. All I have to study is your face. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I wish I could take it back.
I wish I could take it back. I wish we'd never left. I don't. If we hadn't gone up there, I'd never have seen it. You have to see it to believe it.
On their own, these viruses have no effect, or they trigger themselves. But together, they become an effective biological weapon that's easy to control. Well done, Professor. No wonder you survived Raccoon City. If the trigger's in the air, it's hard to control who gets it.
I'd like to get Rebecca back, but the trucks are our priority. Three things to do. Blow up the trucks. Get Rebecca back. Get the vaccine and distribute it everywhere.
Are you saying that because I was in prison? Well, I know how to do it, but it's not the same. It's our only hope. Talk to me. Separate the yellow wire without cutting it.
Well, I know how to do it, but it's not the same. It's our only hope. Let me know. Separate the yellow wire without cutting it. Tie it to the white. The yellow?
- We're going to win some badges. - Let's get started. Take the thread and tie it... - There's a green one. - Yes, tie it to the green one.
Straight hips. Yes. Good. That's good. That's good. Good. Now, um, keep your arms above your shoulders and move your palm towards the blow to block it.
Are you a policeman? Yes. Then where's your badge? I'm undercover. You wanna hold it?
You're definitely taller. I have a grown daughter! Oh, here. The door was unlocked. I spent a whole weekend installing this double cylinder, but if you don't lock it...
Here, at 9:17 a.m., he was on the Springfield interchange heading back to Washington, D.C. Where did he come from? I think I know Marriage is a crazy idea I don't know why people keep doing it
So we focus on Jennifer. - ♪ We all must take... ♪ - She's got a cell phone. I gave her one just in case. We can track it, locate the signal.
- just like everyone else. - You've got to be kidding me. How can 2 people like you disagree? You know what we should show her? Our wedding album. Would you get it, honey?
How can 2 people like you disagree? You know what we should show her? Our wedding album. Could you go and get it, darling? I think James would love to see it.
Here's the money, as we agreed. This is your last chance. Go give her the money and bring her back. I don't care if she dies after the shoot, just bring her back. We have a contract. And keep it.
Now. All satellite images of the island are blurry, but... Susan's camp is... down there. Boathouse... here. And the village is somewhere around here. They call it "Renaissance," but that's all I know.
- Yeah, I'd say that's a safe bet. - Better... but still no one in particular. Actually, I can help with that. We got a report that the gunman threw his mask away on his way out of the pharmacy. Brandt and Goss managed to retrieve it.
Without that, it would have been much worse. Duly noted. Here's your C-4, Lieutenant. We believe this large flowerpot next to your father's grave contained the bomb. And that your ex-husband came to the cemetery to plant it.
But I like it. A little too much sometimes. So why keep the gun? I don't need it anymore. Can you throw it away?
My daughter almost died. I don't want to hear any more of your sincere apologies. We had carried out a thorough inspection of the dinghy. It must have scraped against some sharp rocks or debris... Or maybe it was deliberately sunk.
Yeah, you could do that. You could do that. Seriously? Suit yourself. We're out of gas. Then don't.
"I'd rather fish." Right. The bone? That's exactly how bad I am. Hmm. I'll take it!
Even a friend, We no longer want to be afraid to disobey, to have our air cut off, our water rationed, to be kept away, or herded into rooms, to be used like animals. That's the way it was done, until today. Not anymore. I stole your secret, Fred Johnson. And I'm going to give it to the Belt.

The deadliest fire in the universe. This is really good. How do you do it? Only one way. We go through it first.
We're in hot pursuit. - Close Milwaukee. - Set up a perimeter. We can't go far. We'll have to dump it.
- You know, maybe... - Look. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the stick. So I think I should be the one who decides when not to use it. Well, there's no risk to you here, So I don't see how it would hurt to put it away for a while... if you can.
How did you get out of there? It was amazing. It was that stick thing. Talk about speaking softly and carrying a big stick. They tried to take it from him, And it was like they'd been struck by lightning.
What are you up to? I'm just trying to help Rosalee and Eve see something. See something where? On this old piece of cloth. It has some writing on it, and we're having trouble seeing it.
He has some writings about her, and we're having trouble seeing him. - May I try? - Oh, honey, that's really old. And we should move on. I can see it.
These are the symbols I saw on the dead man's face in hell, Or wherever he was he took me. And everything else is what Diana saw. Did the crusaders make these marks on the cloth, Or was it already there when they got to her? Well, I don't know if the cloth was with the stick when they found it, But none of it was visible with spectral imaging. How could Diana see it?
- It's powerful, but we don't know where it comes from. - What's wrong with it? - I didn't want to leave it.
Previously... There are patterns on this fabric. - I've seen it before. - I can see it.
I don't know if there's a word for it, but I know what they do. They get inside your head and feed. - Feed on what? - They feed on your sleep. Basically, they steal it.
Forget it. Monroe, when you met Rosalee, was it love at first sight? It's hard to say. No, it wasn't. She just didn't know it yet.
The little mirror we used when you turned into a fox. It was next to her, covered in blood. She must have fallen on it, but I don't know why it was on the floor - unless she looked at herself. - She must have picked it up.
- The man with the skull. - Yes. So it makes sense that she's the connection. Maybe the blood on the mirror prevented something worse from happening. Maybe it's a good idea not to clean it, then.
Maybe the blood on the mirror prevented something worse from happening. Maybe it's a good idea not to clean it, then. No! Let me do it. I don't want to destroy it before we know what happened.
No! Let me do it. I don't want to destroy it until we know what happened. It's all right. It's all right. Let's put it where no one can see it until we figure out what's wrong with it.
Leave it to me. I don't want to destroy it before we know what happened. It's all right. It's all right. Let's put it where no one can see it until we figure out what's wrong with it. Let's put it here.
It shattered into a thousand pieces, then all the pieces came back together. It's not a magic mirror. It belonged to my mother. It's always been in my family. As long as nobody looks at it, it's probably safe.
- I think I was. How come? There are patterns on this fabric. They're here and here. I can see it... little drawings and strange writing.
Apparently, Diana drew them when she was with him. What else does he know? He knows about the tunnel. He just doesn't know where it is. And he wants to see it. but Nick won't show Renard the tunnel unless he can talk to his friend, and of course he won't let him talk to that friend until he can see the tunnel.
- Diana! - Diana! Don't open it! - No, Diana! - Close it!
It didn't work. It's all right. The knife has to go through all our hands at once. Then what happens? Then we pull it out, and all our blood will flow at once into the bowl.
What's going on? You can have it. No,nick! You can't give it to that lying devil. If he wants the stick so bad, why doesn't he just take it?
You can have it. No, Nick! You can't give it to that lying devil. If he wants the stick so badly, why doesn't he just take it? Why ask you for it when he can take it from you?
What's he hiding from you? You can ask your kids what to do. Nick, you can't give it to him. I want the people I love to live again. - Take it!
The owner has just died, leaving everything to his wife. And? ? And that's why I need cash. I'm going to buy this bar. Take over the lease, and run it.
- This is it. - Got what? My text messages. Asleep. The 0-6 post in Guam, the base sewage treatment? He's gonna take it, and he wants us all to move.
My favorite show. The one where I get my stuffed white rhino. You dropped it off yesterday. Stuff it! Stuff it, or I'll stuff you.
- Have a look. Good news at last. If it's not too much trouble, can we draw up an action plan? It's not too much to ask. It opens in about fifteen minutes, but if you've got a package, I'll take it.
You're the one who taught me that my Earth comes first. And Eros? 100,000 souls. Did I teach you that? If I'd known what was happening on Eros, I'd have stopped the project and Jules-Pierre Mao along with it, and you know it!
- What can I do? Ask your operator to send you recordings. We have our evidence, and they have nothing. What about GPS? Yes, we have a GPS. - In the car. - Check it out.
- Go away. - I'll get out. I'll clear out, but listen to your heart. It's got a little mouth. Listen to it.
Do you know your OffKey Security login and password? Yes. It's... ChandlerFamily1, and the password is... my God. Tom changed it every week.
Who did he call? I don't know. I didn't ask him. I didn't ask him. If Mr. Bloom went out with his son's cell phone... He could have opened the application, discovered the new login and password, and told someone by calling from the landline.
- considering the new evidence... - What new evidence? Let them finish, Miss Rothman. Your Honor, we wanted to be careful not to reveal the results of our report prematurely. But as soon as it's complete, I'll personally give it to Melle Rothman myself.
You said I could keep silent. Do I have to answer these questions? No. But we do need you to give us your phone. Put it on the table.
It hurts, but dying isn't the answer. You've got to live. God wouldn't want you to give up because Jenny's a janitor. God has a miracle for you. Just around the corner. But... you've got to live to see it.
- I've got it. - Got what? Wait, let me see. Straighten it out. Wait, turn it around.
We weren't his friends, remember? We owe him that much... because we weren't his friends. We don't have the money. We're magicians. Let's build it ourselves.
Pick it up! - Shut up, Firuz! Shut up, Firuz. Success can be isolating. We're all looking for someone to share it with.
What's wrong? Anything! Tell me when I lied to you. You said we could buy the rights to the word "zarb." No, I said it was zarb that we couldn't.
You should never have cut those pants. I wouldn't if they were rare or couture. It's a consolation, Sophia. If you wanted a modified version, you had to find the fabric and take the original as your pattern. And then, if you were like me, you would have wrapped the item in PH-neutral paper, and put it in a box to preserve it for future generations.
Do the others. First things first. The site should be easy to use and cool to look at. I don't want people to find it boring. Great, but who's going to do it to make sure it works?
Your father would have said the same thing, Sire. It's been a long time since I thought of him. May I ask you a delicate question, Sire? Your father's hunting lodge stood on these grounds. To build your palace, you could have destroyed it.
I need to talk to him. Will you be here when I get back? No! I have to go try on a new coat. On me? You wouldn't want me to pay for it...
Monsieur Marchal told me that you were his informant. You will now inform us about your husband. If he does or says anything contrary to my interests, you will inform me. Yes, Sire. As for love, if that's what you're looking for, I suggest you look elsewhere.
The higher you're rated, the more he collects. It's limp cookie. Did he go after them? Not the band, but the thing they're named after. Cookie limp is hazing. Guys ejaculate on a cookie. Last one to do it gets to eat it.
He does his job and doesn't move. Then he goes back to work. He has a lot to teach us. This yogurt's expired. You see, that could have killed me. Now I can give it to Erlich.
- Pleased to meet you, Jemma. - What's your name? Thank you, Doctor. We won't be needing you anymore. - I'll read it if you don't.
I've never slept with Aida. We're just good friends. Good to know. Basically, Aida is like a walking smartphone? If you lose your cell phone, you can locate it.
Do you need anything? Answers about Aida. To complete the security report on the incident. What do you need to know? How well did Aida know what she was going to do before she did it?
You wouldn't happen to have any cyanide or... - Cyanide? Why would I... - Or a paper bag. You put it over my head and I choke quickly.
As you know, they're not that easy to find. Not anymore, though. Pure terrigen crystals. I collected a few samples last year when I was working for a former benefactor. Its objectives were very different from yours, so I tried to refine the compound, make it evolve...
- I need your phone. - Of course you do. Who's calling? I have a confession to make. You don't want to hear it just as much as I don't want to say it,
Although, to be honest, I'm starting to feel a certain tension, sexual among other things, so I thought maybe I'd take a chance, but I'm afraid it might go wrong. - You Americans talk too much. - It's our biggest flaw. Our unit has been informed that an object was found on these premises. Our orders are to retrieve it.
It's simply not true. One of the distinguishing characteristics of humans seems to be regret, from what I've observed. You even asked me to repair a regret for each person entering the Framework. Yes. Well, you, Doctor, have poor self-control, and if one day you came to regret the construction of the Frame, you could change my parameters and have me dismantle it.
I assure you... your mind is alive and well in your head. Intact. - This body is mechanical, yes. - What's mechanical? You're controlling it remotely.
Probably contraband. They arrested my neighbor for a computer last night. - The drone is in my bag. - What's in my bag? I was going to bring it back myself to keep you out of trouble.
Don't play innocent with me. We both know you've gone way beyond that. I removed their greatest regret. What happened next was beyond my control. You entered the frame. You've been manipulating it ever since.
This is all new to me, but I want to help. I owe it to you. You can start with the bus outside. We need to change the plates, digital tags, and erase the GPS. Are we going to use it again?
I can't wait to shove a knife down Agent Coulson's throat. Speaking of SHIELD, we've located the two agents threatening the Cadre. They're aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. jet. Once located, I'll order my men to shoot it down.
I should have stayed in the damn spa. You recognized the decoy pretty quickly, didn't you? Yeah, 'cause you're not robotic. Oh, really? How long did it take you to notice?
In that case, you'll need a dress. And a crown. Careful, careful! I like that sound, too. Would you like to hear it again?
Ômer, mon man'. I discovered your book a year ago thanks to Deniz. And I really liked it. You've managed to make the tales of the oral tradition read in modern language. Then she insisted that I read it, and she was right.
They wanted to expand their store, I said, 'My brother's not here.' -I can't decide without him. -You should have if it suited him. You own this store. You make it happen.
Why doesn't anyone want her? Mr. Lynch says she stepped aside when he touched her. We were counting on that money. If he'd taken it, it would have paid off half our debts. Now Lennox wants his loan and we can't pay him.
Satan built a palace in the fire... What set us apart was the warmth of our welcome. It's different here. Our customers don't want ordinary girls singing bawdy songs. They want a good time, and we know how to give it to them.
♪ And begged him to leave ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're not supposed to play ♪ ♪ My little fiddle ♪ ♪ My thing is mine ♪ ♪ And I keep it quiet ♪
♪ Even if the other girls ♪ ♪ Can do what they want ♪ Of course we can! ♪ My thing is mine ♪ ♪ And I keep it quiet ♪
You have my word, he won't take your children. But right now, I need your help. Please, I need your help. I can feel your despair. I can feel it.
She was arrested during a dyke purge... and reclassified as a Non-Woman... sent to the Colonies. I can't... I just can't... Moira, what did they do to her? "If my right eye offends you, pluck it out."
You'll be carrying children for them. Welcome to the dingos. "Blessed are the meek," my dear. What did they do to him? "If your right eye is an occasion for falling, pluck it out."
- The partnership table. - No wonder he broke you. - He didn't break me. He said he'd think about it, but he hasn't told me yet and I don't know if I'll get it. The only way to get his attention is to go in there and get your check and tear it up.
Because I didn't come all this way to force this woman's hand. And I know the story of the wind and the sun. What are you talking about? She's talking about Aesop's fable. Which basically says that if you want a man to take off his coat, you don't blow it off.
And I know the story of the wind and the sun. What are you talking about? She's talking about Aesop's fable. Which basically says that if you want a man to take off his coat, you don't blow it out. You make him feel warm, and he'll take it off by himself.
She was a perfectly healthy 39-year-old woman. She died rushing from work to pick up our children. What does smoking have to do with it? It shouldn't matter, but this company doesn't care about helping people. It's about making money. So if they can find just one reason not to honor the contract, they will.
Katrina, being a partner here will always mean the same as before. I'll make sure of that. I hope you're here to tell me that everything - is settled. - I'm here to tell you - there's no more deal. Senior partner means something and I can't just give it away to make a statement.
"You enter me Like a hook in an eye "A hook "An open eye" I have a gift. They've all been destroyed. Some of us still have a taste for old things. I thought you might like to read it.
- Helps block the smell. Don't drop any ashes on my instrument tray, Insp. Bradfield. Based on the hypostasis and rigor examined on the body, I'd estimate she was killed between 6pm and midnight on Sunday, May 13. Cause of death, strangulation? The knot on the bra was so tight I had to cut it off.

In this notebook, we have a list of your customers. This Tod had a party on the 13th. You supplied him with various drugs on the day Julie-Ann died. I've never seen this book. One of your cops must have dropped it in.
Glad you could make it! - We're at the vows. Take the bouquet. - I beg your pardon? Take it, come on!
God knows I have no desire to delay your release, so I convinced Mikey to tell the guard that he'd missed a step. What's the big deal? You should tell your dog to watch who he bites. Trust... that's very important to me, Clifford. I've invested too much in this job to let something screw it up.
What's the big deal? You should tell your dog to watch who he bites. Trust... that's very important to me, Clifford. I've invested too much in this job to let something screw it up. You promised me you could do this.
- Daya, you should rest. - Pidge needs to give me back my gun. - Pidge? What? You loaned it to her, not me. Would you give it back to me?
- With the inscription. - "What would Jesus do?" Very nice. Yes. I got dressed so quickly, I didn't think to put it on.
I'm the bisexual version of the worst Batman ever. I bought a document shredder. I shred everything: my receipts, the manual... I plugged in the shredder and put the manual in, thinking: "If it doesn't shred it, "I'll read it."
The oil company, of course, was against the ban. But who better to talk about it than their CEO of Western energies, Mortimer Pétrole. You've got some nerve! Oil made this country, and it's fashionable to hate it, but there was a time when the men in charge of extracting the black gold were seen as gods.
This should attract the attention of my former partners, and when they travel back in time to rescue him, I'll welcome them with open arms. Not too open, I hope. Don't worry, Mr. Thawne. I'm not attached to them. In that case, kill them all, retrieve their fragment of the Spear of Destiny, and bring it back to me.
Raymond. Forget about history, okay? This is the Age of Legends. Remember what Santayana said. "Those who cannot remember their past are condemned to repeat it."
You can do it. You saw what they did to Arthur. Imagine an army of manipulated knights. - What do you suggest? - The piece of the spear... we need to get it out of the castle.
- No. Dude, I can't... do this anymore. Look, man. If there's a flaw in your suit, it means the suit's defective. I got to go fix it.
- Can it be turned off manually? - No, we can't. The White Martian who took Winn's appearance also took his intelligence and recoded everything. We've blocked the whole system. We need the real Winn to unlock it.
R.A.S. We're not very good at communicating these days? I was upset earlier. About the earth anniversary. I knew you would be.
- It's paying off. - Maybe he's worth it. Armek's ship is in orbit. I can transmit from here.
Um, no. Not a thing. Is it possible they've developed a hidden device? No, it isn't. They would have needed me to build it.
We're under the radar for a reason. So do it anonymously. If we do that, no one will take it seriously. But they might listen to CatCo. I'll write an article, and put it on the front page.
It's Cadmus. Very well, then. Off the record. I won't reveal that it came from you. You give me a name, I'll check it myself and then we can get started.
- What is my mother doing? Cadmus stole the alien registry. They're abducting everyone on that list. My article was meant to warn everyone. For something this important, if Snapper won't let you publish it for Catco, publish it as a citizen journalist.
I love saying it that way. Come on, not even a little smile? What's going on? I'm trying to decide whether or not to publish the article on my blog. What happens if you blob it?
Once this ship has passed through the atmosphere, it will travel at the speed of light. So we've got to stop it before it enters space. - I'll never get there in time. - Plan B... It's a Hoshin ship, guide me to land it.
It's a Hoshin ship, guide me to land it. - Okay, give me a second. - Winn! Okay, that's it! Try pressing the button next to the control command and it should switch to manual then I can fly it from here.
Try pressing the button next to the control command and it should switch to manual mode then I can fly it from here. - Two minutes. - Nothing happens. - The ship's still accelerating. - We need to slow it down.
- Nothing happens. - The ship is still accelerating. - We've got to slow it down. I'm here now. I can slow it down.
I'm happy to be your muse. But believe me, it's never that simple to be the parent you aspire to be. Should we test it again? Let me plug in the algorithm and turn it on. Okay, what you're going to do is turn this and lock it.
We know Winslow can't keep his mouth shut. He's my boyfriend and my best friend. Maybe the President and Alex are right. Supergirl has a responsibility to protect everyone. I'm thinking about the two people I love who are trapped on this ship, and if we destroy it...
Being with Kyle was great. At the same time, it's Kyle West. But Kyle's world is huge... It's easy to get lost. That's what happened. We lost our connection, and when we realized it, we couldn't get it back.
Hey, hang on. Weren't you soaking that thing in gasoline this morning? Marcel, do me a favor. I want you to keep the book away from me. If I try to come and get it, I want you to kill me.
It's not the ancestors, Marcel, it's something different. It's something older than the ancestors. And the book never gave it a name. Okay, so who gave you the book? - A witch must have planted it or...
She mentioned a blue light. Yes, that's the will-o'-the-wisp. A New Orleans legend says that a spirit can manifest itself as a ball of blue light. How wonderful. How do you kill it?
We can only free Marcel and Klaus if we break the spell. How do we stop it? I don't know how! It's a sacrificial ritual. I can't break it unless I kill one of those children.
There must be another way. Where are we now? Don't look at the blue light. These kids feed this ritual. But there could be a loophole, if I linked it to you.
I'm glad you're here. It's not like I had a choice. Keelin... - You have to understand... - Look, maybe you and yours see things differently, but... where I come from, when you make a deal, you keep it.
I appreciate that, but, as usual, I'm in the middle of a family crisis. What's going on now? Last night, Klaus was infected with dark magic, the likes of which I've never seen before. This totem represents that power, and the only way to find out how to cure it is to channel it, which will give him access to me.
Check it out. Tell me what energy you feel. It's the magic of the Hollow. The Labonair blood was supposed to kill her. Unless she deliberately drew on her bloodline, to overcome the power and turn it into strength.
Hope's still out there. Do you think it will work? The pendant was built to accommodate a person with Mikaelson blood. So it'll hold Hope. I did my best to fix it.
"Family is power." You're a good father. And you deserve the truth. There's something you need to know about the ritual. Vincent didn't want to tell you because he didn't think you'd agree, but I know you will.
No. We hid it, remember? - We did? - In our secret hideout! Yes. The secret stash where no one will ever find it.
You, come with me. Help me with the sofa. They're coming from the front. Squeeze it tight. Tuck it under.
In every man, lives a legion, several versions of himself. one blocks your way. what do you mean? MK, your gift is the most powerful I've seen, but you let someone else control it.
It appears invisible, without a flame under the paper. How do you know about such processes? You have to get the paper. How do I do that? Dearest, you take it.
How do you know about such processes? You have to get the paper. How do I do that? Dear me, you take it. You pick it up and steal it.
- I've been thinking about it. - What about it? It would be worrying, so it's best not to think about it too much. Look at that building. Just look at it.
They don't come from anywhere, they're there all the time. In the wall? Not in the wall. They're not in the wall, they're the walls. These little robots didn't build this place, they became it.
Try your luck! Flip a coin for a pie! Better luck next time. Isn't that cow's brain or sheep's eye? I catch my own fish. I do it here in the...
I know you! You're the crook! I love what you do! That sound he made... I couldn't hear you, but that sound... it was like I felt it in my gut.
It's just one day of class. Tell me about it. That's why I choose to teach. But there is a national day of mourning. The University of Heidelberg must respect it.
I just need to know where. Sandicot. I'm still waiting for the commission's official decision, but they sent me a strong signal, so I know it's a done deal. You casino guys are old-school crooks. At least we wear it with pride.
You don't know all this because you're children. They work very hard to keep you out of trouble. Unfortunately, this creates tensions between them. You sometimes hear them arguing late at night when they think you're asleep. And it scares the hell out of you. Your father, that proud, irrational man, really wants to give you that dog. Even though he knows they can't afford it.
Now the Captain tells me to stop. He's a trained soldier. It's just a one-way trip. This guy takes everyone through a polygraph. If you're wearing a wire, he'll find it, and I'm not sending you out there without one.
They tried to bribe the Powhatan, Pamunkey and Chickahominy to reveal where the gold is. They said nothing. But it's here. Yeardley was very close to finding it.
Pamunkey and the Chickahominy to reveal where the gold is. They said nothing. But it's here. Yeardley was this close to finding it. So I came back for it.
Yeardley was very close to finding him. So I went back for him. Why should two farmers succeed where an expedition has failed? When I have the gold in my hand, brother... then I'll be my own master. It won't be found.
Why should two farmers succeed where an expedition has failed? When I have the gold in my hand, brother... then I'll be my own master. We won't find it. I will find that gold. I'll do anything to find it.
What you were saying obviously worries you a lot. Perhaps if you told me what it's all about, I could reassure you. Secretary, when I saw the plantations, I thought, "Why reject all this?" Reject? Is it true that King James hates tobacco so much that he would compromise the entire colony with a ban on growing it?
Maybe I can help you too. Any woman who mocks her superiors will suffer the same fate. You were brought in to belong to your husband, and your conduct will conform to that. Marshal, I seem to have found your glove. Allow me to return it to you.
Did you get your phone back from the van? No. Greg. If Mom found out, she'd be furious. Okay, I'll take it back.
We can eat bacon every morning. The truth is, I wasn't 100% there when Manny won the pig. He was with Greg. I couldn't help it. I didn't want to take it, but I was pressured by farmers, I guess.
- Good night. They have to cross the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The doldrums, as they say. INTERTROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONE There's a current in the other direction, eastward, like a riptide on a beach. Impossible to fight. It has to be crossed.
I didn't expect this challenge to deprive me of the pleasure of participating. The aim was to challenge myself and take it on. We're off to Australia and if it takes us nine months, it'll take us nine months. We're going to do it. As hard as it is, we're going to do it.
I've never known people so completely and intimately, and I can't wait to celebrate this feat and appreciate its magnitude once it's achieved. 8,579 MILES RAPED It's important to remember that we weren't rowers. Nor were we people who had done a lot of incredible things. But that didn't stop us from having a dream and making it come true.
- Sounds fishy. Is it possible you're coming? I wouldn't want to be taken advantage of, especially with my memory. I'll tell you what I tell all my customers. What's in it for me? When you hear a sound, accept it and let it go.
Do you know what that means? What if your mother left and there were no more couches? What if the sky turned dark and the crops died? Would you know which plants to eat and which ones would kill you? Could you kill an animal and gut it without cutting out the intestines?
Let's go to the infirmary. If we go outside, they'll kill us. The funny thing about wolfsbane is that it works from the outside in. Most people first feel a tingling in their fingertips, their nerves paralyzed. Then it moves slowly up to the heart, encircling it and petrifying it.
I know. Let's go, come on! Come with me. I've got the baby. What do you want? We'll drop him off at your cousin's.
Tell her it's off. She's babbling like The Exorcist. I don't want to get puked on. I can't play mom right now. If you see a problem, deal with it.
Hello everyone. Thank you for bringing books. In honor of Poussey, welcome to the new Litchfield Library. As you can see, it's no longer just one room - it's everywhere. Take your book, replace it with another.
You're not listening to me. Pennsatucky is a shower tricard. You're not allowed within 90 yards of Leanne. I can't think of a single judge who would validate that. The justice system didn't do its job, so we're replacing it.
Not good. But don't worry. Your face is under there. And it's beautiful. You'll see it someday.
Holy crap! Damn it. Damn it. I'm sorry. I forgot. Oh, I forgot. This is Dr. McCurry. He's gonna cut your finger off and put it on Leanne.
I know. That's why it better be important. That's why this better be important. We've got a little problem. Great, it's small. So you can fix it.
Is that piss? It looks like piss, but it smells like shit. It looks like lava. This article referred to coffee as the poor man's cocaine - I thought you had to snort it.
We just have to decide who's going to live here. Raven, we're not talking about the list yet. Clarke, we're running out of time. We need to make a plan for the day we close the gates, run drills, make sure only survivors have weapons, agree on protocols for dealing with those who'll be pissed they weren't chosen. You asked me to take care of rationing, and I'll do it, but choosing who lives or dies is your specialty.
Even technology has become a weapon in their hands, used to poison our minds. I know you're suffering. I know you're afraid, but it doesn't have to be this way. There is a way out of the darkness. I can show it to you.
Life magazine Le Sténographe du Samedi Soir and Professor Caboche Taloche and the Dove Soap Parade show. I'm thinking of getting involved in, uh, solar. I won't use it for myself, I'll sell it to poor people and musicians. Oh, not me.
Just watch the movies. Words and ideas can change the world. Oh, look at this world! It's just pissing its pants. You, you, change it.
With or without you. I don't know what you're talking about. He'll be swept away by the wave. I'm offering you a lifeboat. Take it.
- We have no choice. - If Evans contacts her, she'll cave. If I don't wire the rest of the eight million today, we'll all end up on the hook. And that includes the money I've already taken from Eugenia's account. I don't know what'll happen if Sam claims it.
- He was a good person. - Thank you for your time. Yes, listen... We understand that you want to say goodbye to her as she deserves, but as a financial advisor, I have to inform you that there are usually penalties for early withdrawal that can be very high. Okay, but I have to do it, so...
You want him in debt for life? You don't care if he goes to high school. He might miss a day or two because he's so easy. If you're so desperate for money, why don't you just do it? You're the one who learned how to launder it.
Soft tissue is vaporized, bones... You thought about what you wanted to do when... You know what I mean? I want to be buried without a coffin. Leave my body to the maggots. They will decompose it and it will return to the earth.
Kady, you're taking Cou Barbu. Pull yourself together. It's only a finger. You speak to him, grab his hand and say, "Can I borrow it?" You dip his finger in his glass to clean it, and... you put it in your mouth, walk away, and remain an emblem in his heart for life.
When did everyone lose their sense of humor? If you're right, then Luna is the miracle we need. I wish I could be there with you. Me too, but you have to be there. Once the Nightblood serum is created, we'll need to distribute it very quickly, and we'll need peace for that.
We do a lottery, we draw lots for the 100 people who will survive, but we'll have to work for it every day. If we don't show our assignments, we won't be in the lottery, and when the time comes, we'll pick the names, and decide. All right? Good? Then that's settled. Now, the radiation shield is ready. Who's going to help me install it?
We'll make it. Get up. Get up. What are you doing? What are you doing? Taking you home. Your ship protects against Praimfaya so I intend to take it.
Come nicely. I'm waiting for you. Skaikru had me murder my whole family. We're taking you home. Your ship is a shelter from Praimfaya, and I intend to take it.
I'm not here to kill you. I'm here to take your ship, a ship you repaired to save your people, not mine. This ship is a rescue plan. It can only hold 100 people. Then you won't mind if we take it.
Love begins in the eyes, continues in the lips, germinates in the heart and becomes permanent in marriage. Nurdane. And marriage? What's it like? Don't ask me.
Liv, are you still at the morgue? These 17 syringes make up the complete package of the world's cure. Side effects can include complete and utter memory loss. It won't be long before you have an episode too severe for this inhalant to help. You keep it somewhere you have access to it.
You're just a messed-up kid. Embroiled in something way over your head. If no demon has taken up residence in me, it will. I want to be a part of something bigger than this shitty town. We'll bring this world to its knees. Take it. Dump it on yourself.
Oh, the ancestor. Heroin. I always thought I'd die like that. Potassium chloride will stop the heart. The adrenaline will get it going again.
Intelligent, studious. And an internship with you would be... Cut that baby out. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you. I love the sound when they cut it.
She's waking up. We're approaching Leith. 36 hours ago, a secure research complex fell. Fortunately, it was only communicators. We need you to fix it.
Really? Maybe we can concentrate on Corpsey McGuts. The blast radius would have fragmented the room, but most of it's inside him. He was right on top of it when it exploded. He was either fixing it or...
No, we can do it. Okay, you need to find the processor, remove it and then reverse the flow to the ODBC source administrator. What? In English, moron. And you can't redirect it that way, it'll lose the signal.
I couldn't do it without this. I sent Jumpers all over the J looking for this thing, carry it home. And you know what I've noticed? That you have narcissistic personality disorder? That no matter where there's green juice, there's always Killjoys guarding it.
Don't stay out too long. But do the readings match those of the ship? Yes, this ship has definitely been here before. Johnny, we're coming to a... Village. Can you describe it?
- Why, why not? - No, my turn. Where did you get the ship? We found it. Khlyen must have left it.
His failure is a double setback. I've lost one of my best agents, as well as the means to locate the Raza. But all is not lost. In time, I'll have another way to locate the ship. And with your help, to take it.
- Their boss? - Is he your friend? - I like him. Didn't you tell us this before? I wanted to, but they told me their secret, and keeping it seemed normal.
He's confused... scared. Of what? Of death. I told you when we met that our programming is flawed. At least, that's how humans see it.
His nanites have healed his superficial wounds, but the damage to his neural matrix could be irreparable. I'm sorry, but that's not the only thing you need to consider. - We've already discussed the possibility of Anya unwittingly transmitting a homing signal. I'll find it and eliminate it.
What's out there? Our creator. What are we looking at? An extraordinarily complex cipher. It would take a very advanced mind just to recognize it, and approximately 87,560 hours of computation to decode it.
It would take a very advanced mind just to recognize it, and approximately 87,560 hours of calculation to decode it. Ten years... - Give or take. - And yet... antilogical aspects of the puzzle would be better suited to an intuitive approach. So someone with android logic and an emotional sense would solve it faster?
EC-5 series ? - New models must be equipped with a device that masks the tracers. - Can you remove it? - No, I can't remove it. - But I can neutralize it.
- And I saved you on that station. We're even. Truthfully? Geez. I'll pass you the gun, I have your word you'll hand it over the second it's done?
Galactic Authority, elite criminal division. I landed in a module after the destruction of EOS-7. We heard gunshots. The complex's security drone was still active. I had to neutralize it.
Wait a minute. You don't think they'd try to use the drive, do you? We have a slight problem here. What's wrong? I don't even know how to describe it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's that? That's far enough. If you come any closer, I'll throw it away. You don't want to destroy it any more than we do.
Time. Very funny. It wasn't a joke. I've spent 48 hours analyzing the Blink Drive and I still can't see the solution. I don't know why it activated or how to fix it.
What's up? The good news is that it looks like the right file because it has Ferrous military-grade encryption. The bad news? Ferrous military-grade encryption. We can't read it.
We can't read it. Tabor found it, and he doesn't know how to set an alarm. He probably had software. - Not with the file. - He must have hidden it.
Wait a minute. You don't think they'd try to use the drive, do you? We have a slight problem here. What's wrong? I don't even know how to describe it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's that? That's far enough. If you come any closer, I'll throw it away. You don't want to destroy it any more than we do.
She left Paris so that my grandparents could help her raise me. Now, here I am, defending this city at war. The loss of life is... unimaginable. The last few months have been... particularly bloody. But the spirit always finds a way to bear it.
MCRN establishes a secure corridor for an incoming vessel. These scientists were folding up the lab to leave with this thing. I imagine it was their transport. They won't be happy when they see their lab is lost. All the more reason to kill it.
No. Bacon, eggs, sausage. Simple stuff. That's what barbecue is. It's not like a hangi that takes hours. You throw it on, it heats up, it's ready in half an hour and everyone's eating.
I'll make one tomorrow. Get in the legs, the legs. Stay away from the claws. It's getting together, sitting down and sharing a boodog that makes the meat better. What gives the most pleasure is the meal, and sharing it with your family, because you're laughing, smiling and chatting.
Get in the legs, the legs. Stay away from the claws. It's getting together, sitting down and sharing a boodog that makes the meat better. What gives the most pleasure is the meal, and sharing it with your family, because you're laughing, smiling and chatting. It's the pleasure of sharing it as a family.
When I slit his throat, he didn't die quickly. At first it was hard, but now I've got it under control. We put the pig in a barrel with boiling water, shave it. Then we cut the pig in half, and take out its viscera. Place it on the spit and add the spices.
At first, I had a hard time, but now I've mastered it. We put the pig in a barrel with boiling water and shave it. Then the pork is cut in half, and the viscera removed. We place it on the spit and add the spices. After that, we put it over the coals, and turn it.
I studied, and in my spare time, I worked. That's how I learned. I'm now 20, almost 21, and I've been working for almost five years. Once I've finished making it, I taste the mezcal, and if the work is well done, the product is good. When people taste it and say: "This is excellent mezcal", I reply:
Do you have anything that says "Grand Reopening"? I want to be naughty. But I get cold fast. I found your shoelace section, but where's the underwear? It's the underwear, and you're holding it inside out.
I want to be naughty. But I get cold very quickly. I found your shoelace section, but where's the underwear? It's the underwear, and you're holding it inside out. Of course, I can see it now.
Mine got me kicked out of the army. They asked, I said. Let's do it! Everyone back in your chairs. I'll show you the sequence and then I'll break it down.
How hard can it be? You're doing it. The truth is, this job takes a lot out of... You don't have to tell me. I'll do it.
"you don't need superpowers to accomplish great things. With love. Daddy" He gave it to me when I was little - I always keep it with me - so cute And now you're sniffing it in a very creepy way
- in a way... - They're not here. They're at home counting their money. But they do get their money. Yes, but good luck tracing it from them.
Did he say anything else, anything that might help us? No. He was here before he left. He was at the computer. And it's password-protected. Can you, I don't know, hack into it?
The storm's over. You know where to go now? I'm going home. Back to my stupid herd. Walk into the sunset and you'll find it.
Stay out of sight. I've been a fool. I realize now... that anything gained can easily be lost. The book is safe, Professor. We'll come back for it as soon as we get out of here.
Your messages are just too much, Bob. Come on. Careful not to electrocute yourself, there's a bare wire on this cable. I touched it. I'll fix it, but I knew you were going to do that.
That's right. - Where are we with MacLeish? - The trap is in place. Wells is watching MacLeish's army buddy, waiting for him to act. I've briefed his protection so they'll back off if he asks.
- And it's no coincidence. - The investigation is ongoing. No, I understand, believe me. It's very difficult to run this country. But with everything that's going on, you're not really running it.
Superb work. Incredible. - Where's the champagne? - I have Scotch whisky. Bring it over.
Fingers up your nose. A small tip. Thank you, sir. Would you like this? No, keep it.
The whole of NATO. Right, then. But I'd like to start with France. We started this arms reduction dream together. And I'm going to need your help to make it happen.
It's not a signal. It's a memory. It's all the same in a way. Kirsten's emotional state maintains the tangle. If we can isolate her memory of Jacqueline Stinger, we can manipulate it.
Linus and Camille, I need you to isolate the memory. Linus, are you okay? He's fine. Let's get her back. Isolate the signal and send it my way in three, two, one.
The Grasshoper project was a failure. Depends on who you ask. The laboratory incident accelerated your mother's brain. It evolved in more complex ways than we can understand. We tried to recreate it, but failed, and that's why we need to keep your mother safe.
I thought you were in trouble! This is a club med! We're being reassigned, not tortured. Blair intends to continue the program. I told him I wouldn't.
I don't know what you've done. I'm not sure I want to know, but well done. All I can say is it's good to have friends in high places. By the way, congratulations on your promotion. Just because I was offered Blair's job doesn't mean I want it.
Well, working with other departments might give me a chance to evolve one day. Anyway, you said you wanted me to have a desk job. Yeah, I did. I did. You should take it.
That I, Gordon Meredith Enver, should be in your shoes, breathing your rarefied air as a beloved visionary, instead of... loitering, unknown and ungrateful in the shadows, like a digital thug! Give us a moment. Gord... I'm so sorry... that you feel this way. But I didn't steal anything from you. We developed this code together, then I begged you to follow me to Silicon Valley to finish it.
Very good question. I've got eyes on a shady guy heading straight for the exit. Follow him, but don't engage. - We're on our way. - If you want the heart of a lion, you must first be prepared to consume it.
That's true. But we have to remember the newlyweds we once were. I miss them sometimes. I miss them too. Someone's replaced the soap dish. Would you like to... try again?
Let the music howl. Get an afro. Let others make your bed. I like making my bed, you old coot. Then make it.
Get an afro. Let others make your bed. I like making my bed, you old coot. Then make it. You've earned it.
He thinks he's mentally ill, but at the same time, part of him knows that the power is real. And are we sure about the scope and nature of this power? No, but if the analyses are right, he could be the most powerful mutant ever encountered. After the Red Hook incident, I'd say that's implied. So he has the power, but he doesn't understand it or know how to control it.

After the Red Hook incident, I'd say that's implied. So he has the power, but he doesn't understand it or know how to control it. I'd like to dig deeper to see if we can figure out what triggers it.
Utopia Project... so far, I've found a spiritual retreat in New Mexico, a rock band, and an African charity. In our quest for answers, we only find more questions. I've really blundered with my invention. Time travel was for research and observation. I wanted to improve the world, not destroy it.
I told you, stop calling me that. Nuñez is missing. It's just Rita and me, and Rita's sick. So are Warren and Frank. If you want the job, you can have it.
[BIP] Manfred is ready to risk his life to save Lem. But for this to work, we're going to need divine help. I've got something for Zach. He wants the power Lem has, I can give it to him.
We take him by the blood! Where's God in that? Divine right is a fable. A right is taken. It is taken by force. It is preserved by force. Take the right, Henri. Take it.
Talk first. What do you want to talk about? I want to know your secret. -How do you... -I can feel it.
David. David, wake up. He's not in his memories, in his subconscious. I've looked. Wherever his mind is, I can't find it.
And besides, with this kind of reasoning... - David. - With that kind of thinking, the war will never end. You have the power. You can control it now.
That led us to Titan. Ramse ripped this from a document in Berlin. So you've been hunting monkeys for years, but this Mot is your chance to pass them by? We have to go back to Berlin. If we go back and steal it, we may never get the tip to find Titan beforehand.
Straight ahead, Jonesy. Relax and enjoy the tale... the Word of Witness. A feast of history and prophecy, an ice cream with the fruits of future, past and would-be-would-be. Everything you wanted to know about the Witness, but didn't know how to ask. When the 12 Monkeys army fled Germany, they couldn't abandon their manifesto, but they were afraid to move it through official channels.
1957. That's us. That's how Olivia knew. It's all in this document. - If anyone else sees it...
Listen, kid, I'm going to tell you something very important, okay? Your father... is a bastard. Don't ever forget that. Olivia was right, it's hidden behind the painting. We just have to go through it, find something incriminating, take it.
My associate Olivia Moore. Is Winslow in? My wife is picking her up from school. Is everything all right? The truck outside, who's driving it?
Shall we get started? In the meantime, do you know the story of the poor woodcutter and his wife? I don't believe I have. One day, a poor woodcutter and his wife found a crane caught in a trap. Pitying the bird, they set it free.
I was right. You're not just a telepath. You can control objects with your mind. "Control" is saying a lot. What we're seeing here is raw, unleashed power, but you can learn to control it.
The wave of death will arrive in 10 days. I found a fallout shelter, designed to hold thousands of people. Salvation lies there. Radiation doesn't care if you're from Triku or Azgeda. Azgeda will never see the inside. - Why don't we share it?
What's going on now? If she can't use her brain, why do they need her? Initiating launch sequencer. You can tell me it's none of my business, but why live underground when you've got a working rocket? Do you plow the ground or stab it?
What would you like me to do? Live? The radiation will be here in 6 days. You were willing to share the bunker with us. Why not share it with Trikru too?
You don't have to kill 12 warriors. I just have to kill the last one. Octavia kom Skaikru has won. Skaikru won't have the bunker to himself. We're sharing it.
This cable is insulated with PTFE. Teflon. Yes. Shiny. I can strip it and melt it and use it to seal joints.
You know what ruins my talent? Death. The whisper is always there. Shocking your heart could cause cardiac arrest. If that happens, you'll have to shock it again with the defibrillator.
Breathing is important, too. What's the oxygen plan? Based on what Murphy says about the bunker light, I guess...I pray.... There's an oxygenator here. We'll take it with us.
- Where's the system? - It's here. Safe. For now. Reddington says the NMB sent Farook with a team to retrieve it.
I said, 'Stop! Get on the bike! Was it good, that Brussels sprout? Was it good? Because now you're going to pay for it!"
Get him out of here!" "Seventy cents! And twenty-five cents for a banana!" "Anything you want! Buy it before it rots!"
Don't get me wrong, it's fast food. We've always been fast food. Breakfast is about service. And to freak out IHOP. We do that too!
We've always been a fast-food restaurant. Breakfast is about service. And to freak out IHOP. We do it too! We do it too!
She could have come back and gotten that gorilla out of jail. Night: "You're doing it!" He puts on the jacket, the hat. "Come on!" We take him to the car, it's the only way. We've got to get him to the port by car. So we can take him back to the jungle.
In the distance, on the horizon, he finally sees the jungle. He gets overexcited. He jumps off the boat and rolls around in the sand. "We made it! Don't stain the coat, we've got to bring it back!"
I wanted to burn the damn house down. I was ready to leave. Then my wife came in, smiling, with a sandwich. Cut in half, diagonally, a sign of love, right? If it's not cut, they might as well throw it.
All questions. He's been inactive for quite a while. Nas doesn't really know who he is. But he gave him his phone? Nas and the team at the NSA tried to hack it, but no one succeeded.
And this amputation is going to go... No, don't do that. What's the matter with you people? Nobody touches the board but Chief Bailey. If Bailey sees you put a finger on it, she'll cut it off, and then she'll kill you.
A neighbor called 911, and the firefighters broke down the barrier. They saved your life. Damn wire. I'd almost dismantled the whole thing, and now I'm falling off the ladder right into it. You were dismantling it?
I'm sure it's not everything. I mean, it's not right, what Bailey did. You can't rat someone out as chief of general surgery Keps is good, but Grey put herself out there for the job, okay? She deserves it.
- Damn. - Webber, what is it? Did you tie off the kidney? I... I got it, I got it. Put it back in the ice.
They both have a chance. We just closed the boy, he's screwed. - He doesn't have access to... - We closed the mother the mother, and then we give him the debilitating condition. We've got to give it back to him.
At her expense? She came here in perfect health. If you'd found the stenosis a minute later, we wouldn't even be talking about it. The kidney would already be in the boy's body. But it isn't. And if we don't get it into a body soon, the kidney will die, and no one will have it. So who do we give it to?
What would you do? If we can wake up the mother and ask her what she wants... We can't do that. She's probably been awake long enough to think about it. The kidney wouldn't survive. I know, but if we could, she'd want to give it to her son.
We can't do it. She's probably been awake long enough to think about it. The kidney wouldn't survive. I know, but if we could, she'd want to give it to her son. She might. Give it to the child.
Give it to the child. Any parent would say the same thing. Certainly any parent with two good kidneys. She only has one left. She might want to keep it.
Certainly, any parent with two good kidneys. She only has one left. She might want to keep it. If she's a monster. I'd like to keep it.
I wanted him to stay where he was. I wanted Minnick to add value, but she didn't want to work with him. So you worked with Minnick, and put Richard aside? No. I had a choice to make, Grey, and I didn't want to make it, because, yes,
So you worked with Minnick, and put Richard aside? No. I had a choice to make, Grey, and I didn't want to make it, because, yes, Dr. Webber built this hospital. But I have to keep building it.
-I'm sorry, darling. I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. -I know you are. Your arm is partially burned. You need to learn how to bandage it while it heals.
Stop it! You keep saying, "I'm an Avery, I'm an Avery" but you're not, not in the sense that you mean. A title means nothing. It's the person who owns it.
Surrounded by things from the past that held me back. Sometimes I can't even get into the driver's seat. You see what I mean? This is what happens when you carry your past around with you. The past is dead, let it go.
So, between you and me, things are certainly not back to normal. I just got a call about my house, it's officially mold free. You get your couch back, and I'm out of your hair. We're still in the middle of this strategy game. I guess I could come over one night, and we'd finish it.
I'm going to cut it so Happy can check every room, just to be sure. How am I supposed to sleep in here with all this mess? The suction cup exploded. Looks like a piece of copper ripped off in the velocity of the friction. We've got to find it if we're going to fix it.
Don't cut it too short. I need three meters of hose. I'll get it. I'll fill it up! All right, I've got the end, put it down.
I'll use real jujitsu on you if you don't have that rattlesnake! Let me explain. Rattlesnakes don't hunt by sight. They feel vibrations and sense heat. So I put my cell phone on vibrate, run several apps to warm it up, and put it in my sock.
A perfect shot. Your help was greatly appreciated. Cabe has had his fill of rattlesnake vitamins. Where are you with the hydrogen sulfide? We're in the process of recovering it.
Yeah, that makes sense. We're out, except for Veronica and Paige, who are still out there. Cabe's calling Homeland Security for backup. Whoever's after you sent someone over, too. We got a keychain on the guy and we're using Sly's scanner to decode it, but it's encrypted.
Great. Holy stack of greenbacks. It must be a federal railway station What is a railway station? Hidden treasures across the country where they store money before distributing it to banks.
And there's the rub. That abandoned factory where we found that nuclear device? That's where I hid the money. That's why you were using a jackhammer. I went back last week to finish up and retrieve the money, but the workers showed up and I bolted before they saw me, but now there are full-time security guards, and I need your help to get it back.
Completely full of it. Look, I swear I didn't know anything about asbestos. You probably didn't. I'll get rid of it, just, just don't close my yard. Sorry, we have to send the sample in for testing and reporting.
It's going to take a while. We need to stabilize the silo or it will fall over before we're done. But how? It's ready to fall. We'll secure it with cables.
- You could have protected yourself... - Forget it. ...and instead, you protected me. You got me this job. You deserved it.
But... why? We can't put you on the stand knowing you'll perjure yourself. You can only tell what is true or potentially true. God, I love the law. Everyone takes it so seriously.
But given the importance of the agent's testimony, I'm curious as to why his dashboard video wasn't provided. Good question. Mr. Prosecutor? The recording is not exculpatory. That's a relief. I imagine you'll want to see it.
He's the one who arrested me a few nights ago. Can you tell the court about that? I was driving back from my mother's house. He pulled me over, claiming I'd changed lanes without my blinker. I hadn't. He told me to get out of my car so he could search it.
The symbol on the phone we found is the label's logo. And they chose to release this music of their own accord? It's a pretentious label. It only exists to produce the music of one guy. Who owns it?
Exactly! Exactly! So it was all for nothing. Lucifer is even worse. This phone could be the key to bringing down the entire Ruiz empire. Yes, but how do we crack it if the cyber police couldn't?
Maybe it's an instruction manual. In an ancient language I can't read. That's just great. Here. I can't read it.
This family is too weird. "You'll get the hang of it." "It just takes practice." And that hug. Are you doing it?
It's a judge's robe. Federal Judge Trisha Culpepper Drowned in her country club pool this morning. The club janitor saw her come in around 8 a.m. And then, 30 minutes later, 9-1-1 got a call from an employee saying she was drowned. Someone made this diorama after learning what happened And put it on your door?
You want to hold this for me? - I'd love to. - Thank you. I've got some bandages and a defibrillator. I have some bandages and a defibrillator and no splints, so I can shock you, but not immobilize your wrist. We'll probably have to put it back in place, then wrap it tight, and there's no pain medication here so it's going to hurt.
I know, I know, I know. We'll be fine. Here we go. Here we go. Candace, does the kit have an Ambu balloon? I'll get it.
Cuvette. Is that Liam? Little Liam with religious parents? That's the one. I saw his name on the board and couldn't believe it.
She took me away from here with this copy. Years after the Black Fairy kidnapped me, I found it in her things. I kept it under the mattress in my cell. The tale carried me through the endless nights. But one night, the Black Fairy caught me reading it.
I still haven't seen it! I hate it when that happens! Cab drivers go to the movies, too! They should ask if we've seen the movie before spoiling it. You still want to go see it this weekend?
Dreyfuss doesn't act like someone who's out to burn the world to the ground. He may have other plans. In many traditions, such as Norse mythology and Hindu spiritualism, an apocalypse is a time of transformation. This is an interesting hypothesis. The Horseman was summoned not to end the world, but to shape it into something new.
No sign of patrols. Are you sure the package is safe? It is, below the farm in a hiding place of my own invention. Very well, then. Whatever it is, it must be very valuable for you to deliver it yourself.
Not my best day. We don't have to talk about it. I want to. You know Dreyfuss has a weakness for artifacts. He sent Jobe and me to raid this place, empty it of anything of value.
It's so beautiful. Here. Listen, Summer, there's something I need to tell you. I think you... I've put a message inside for you, so whenever you want to hear it, just put it to your ear and you'll hear me.
I don't know that. Yes, you do. It's gone to your head. Yeah, maybe it has. But my moral compass is out of whack and I've got to set it straight.
We'll be at Ray's launch position in 18 minutes. We'll only have one chance to intercept him before gravity pulls us back to Earth. Henry. You must know how time travel works. He does.
How rude! Well done, girls. Star City owes you. We're just doing our job. But you do it so well, and with such... style.
Did you know that taking a photo of a gay man by surprise is a criminal offense? I'm cute. I forgive you. Is that my phone? Let go!
And now these people are protecting it. So tell me what I don't understand. What you don't understand is what this place means to these people, it's all they have left. And any attempt to cross this border will end in violence. What he's trying to say, sir... are these people going to die to protect him?
Against who? You. Me? Nick, can I read your book? - I was just going to ask you.
It helps to know that. Why didn't you tell me this before? I was embarrassed, and I didn't want you to think I wasn't excited to read your book, because I am. I am excited. So... you're excited to read my book, you fall asleep when you read it but it's not personal.
Are you going to fry these too? Possibly, but we've got another problem. Opening the airlock was the station's plan A. Plan B: Eliminate all oxygen. And sell it back to us?
Stop being brave. I can't stand brave people. I'll carve history in stone. I'll draw your name in the air. They'll see it for centuries.
And there's music. Always music. So, team, who's helping me hide her guitar? See, that's what I'm trying to teach you, Missy. You understand the universe, you see it, you grasp it.
Margot: Yeah, girls should have the bedroom now. You're clear on the approach. Congratulations on your citizenship. Thank you. Hong Kong recognizes talent when they see it.
We're supposed to update the Department of Energy's server today. No. That job has been postponed indefinitely. What? No. I spent weeks securing this contract. And Walter spent a few minutes dismantling it.
Actually, Mr. Dodd, I'm here to learn more about your councillor program. Some say you're a "one solution" candidate who only cares about the fate of his favorite comic book stores. Putting that aside for the moment, can you explain how you intend to handle the budget crisis in West Altadenia, You have yet to request a copy of the city's finances from the city council. Miss Logan, I'm a genius. I didn't ask for the budget because it would take me less than a few minutes to read it, identify inefficiencies and compensate for them.
Sounds easy. What's the catch? She's sequestered by the Sardovian government until the International Chess Championship, which starts tomorrow. The only people she'll be interacting with are the government security agents and the players sitting opposite her, from now until the end of the tournament. If Cypher has only her name to decipher, he'll crack it before then.
- I accuse! My date was covered in mucus. The only piece I needed was the one you doused with your filth. Firstly, I don't have the ability to aim with my mucus. Secondly, you could have cleaned it.
Fine. You give up. You're losing anyway. First of all, I'm not losing. You're falling into Monticelli's trap and you don't even see it, and secondly,
Even smarter than playing chess without a bishop. It's true. It's true. This just in. Okay, Happy, I'm staring at a solid wall. How do I get through it?
Cut the crap. What are you doing here? Look, I just came by to try and make up. And before you start bitching, I'm not trying to get my job back. Good, because you're not getting your fucking job back.
We're delighted to supply windows to the nursing home, but to save time we need the signed contract and deposit. As you said, Mr. Swan, make an appointment with Sarah. - There's no rush. - No, no, no, it's fucking urgent. Look, I've got the contract right here, if you'd like to sign it.
Does Morozov know anything about insects? I wouldn't know. He's an agricultural expert. Did he talk to you about insects? He knows about wheat and what can destroy it.
Don't make a sound. I don't have much money. You can have it all. My purse is in the kitchen. Please take it.
If you scream, I'll shoot. Natalie? Would you like some money? Please. Here, take it.
- Where is it? - What are you talking about? I don't know what you're... Where's the signal? Get it back.
It's a piece of gristle that these two kids can pull back and forth in their golden years. But you know. You create something, you start well, then you juice it up and lose focus. And... I've barely covered the dog in a color, brown, they put it in the oven.
I was furious with myself. I said, is this all I've got for my dad? A little decoration? Maria! She hates it.
A small decorative object? Maria! She hates it. It worked as planned! Yes, I bought a Chinese cat to put on the opposite side of the room to create some real tension.
Should I continue to be firm, puffy and wet... so as not to diminish the property value of the person next to me? And then I thought about Los Angeles. There are 100,000 people living on the streets. We need more of me. More places where you can take the emotional equivalent of a cart full of empty batteries and lift it.
I don't like people. Listen, Linda. I'll put my purse in the middle, and we'll pretend we're in economy. Let's upgrade. We deserve it.
What the hell is this? It's a license. For your peer-to-peer communication patent. It's a standard contract. In exchange for your patent, you'd receive royalties and shares in my future start-up. If you'll just... sign by the post-it, I'll take it and get out of your life.
I'm looking at your embarrassing personal info. If you're looking at my stuff, I'm looking at yours. Relax, man. I'll get your mailbox. If you've taken one selfie, I'll find it.
Our contract fell through. We're not going to Hawaii. Look, we know you worked your ass off to get this deal. We'll never forget it. Yes, and I'd gladly do it again for you guys.
Energy capable of making this damn world a little less unbearable because we're trying to do the same, dammit, and that... that's no weakness. Take it from me. You don't like this world? Well, you see its flaws. It gives you the perspective and solitude to really fix it.
- What do you want? - Immunity. I give you the Doctor, you give me a new place to start over. Max, my right-hand man, you have to leave him alone so that everything runs smoothly. Maddie tells the Doctor they've found the missing money, he's coming to get it.
I thought you wanted it in English. Don't overthink it. You've got a mission: add 4 names to your guest list. When your father-in-law gives you the dowry money, you'll kindly give it to me.
Somdev, you're my only friend. I don't have anyone else! What about me? You broke my heart, Badri. I'll fix it in a jiffy!
Vaidehi! - Vaidehi! Vaidehi! Vaidehi broke my heart! - I'll fix it, Badri!
I like that. Then a golden egg appears between them. Uh, sorry, a what? A golden egg. The woman eats it and a few months later she has a baby.
Hello, "brother." Ah, so you got my message. I was so excited, I made a cartoon of the Burns Brothers logo to show you what I was talking about last night... look. Our first names exploded outside the house. Say, can you send it to me so I can show Don?
All right? You know my wife. You know my wife, you know my daughter. It's time you got to know me. For example, one of my hobbies is going for walks in the woods and burying stuff. Sometimes I take something, cut it up, and bury it in different holes.
There's only one real estate project left in New Orleans that's still standing. Abandoned years ago. How do you know this? My ex-husband was the developer. When the scandal came out, he fled town, the building was condemned, and no one had the money to tear it down.
I need more. Javier has an office in his house. A computer with a dedicated server from which he manages all his business. If there's a compromising file, it's on that server. Can it be hacked?
I didn't know you were in the bathroom." And you'll find clever names for the Wi-Fi network - like, "this is 4D." - It's very good. I think we should... let's agree right now to change it to this one-the fact is, your lives are about to continue, and I'll just be that weird guy you've been living with.
My apologies. I'm on a quest to find a spell to kill a god. It can't be that no one, in all of history... Apparently, no one ever wrote it. Look, if there's a way, I'll find it.
Seriously? - My God, that's... - Girls, when you're done, could you ask her for the book now? Relax, man. I'm gonna find it.
I'm going to need a guarantee. I'll do that. Here are the keys to my place. You can pick up my mail and feed the cat. Who do I feed it to next?
Who told you that? Your little telephone? Yes. It says there's an accident up ahead. If there was an accident, I'd know about it.
- Brilliant. Six thousand five hundred. Congrats on the job. You overpaid for a bull. I hope you can bring him back.
Who wants to go fast food? - How are you, Abby? - Chip going well? It's going. We've got a lot of work to do and no time to do it.
I like your dream catcher. - Your what? - Your dream catcher. I hung it the day I bought this bar. You're the first one to notice.
- He fixed it last time. - No. He knows how to talk to the generator. And I'm not exaggerating. He leans over it, strokes it and says:
I'm talking about the technology. The psycho killer part isn't cool at all. Can you trace the bracelet? No. Not possible once he's in it. Unless he has it scanned again.
We have a secret Uber account. For when we go out. Maybe he used it? This is awesome. Can we see it?
You're walking down the street, when suddenly Jack-0-Lantern hits you with a fireball... Citizens of Charm City! Who loves creme brulee? But thanks to our new indestructible phone, the phone's perfectly fine. As long as you don't drop it on the screen.
Try to break it. I dare you. We haven't made it waterproof yet. Can I see your phone? Are you going to drop it in the beer?
That's good. That's good. - Give it to her. - I forgot my wallet. No, he's got money in his shoes. He hides it in his socks.
Ed called me in a panic. I got to his house before the police. That's when he asked me to get rid of the knife. But it was evidence, so I couldn't destroy it. But I couldn't really return it, either.
I'll check on the others. Hey, what's up? Where's your suit? I had a bit of a complex, so I hid it under the bathroom sink. You could have put it in the coatroom.
I like the outfit you chose for Denise. It's nice to change so you don't always see her in jogging pants and a "Crade" cap. Yes. I remember when she was in 4th grade, she wore a John Starks Knicks sweatshirt all year. She spilled sauce on it and kept wearing it for a month.
It's nice to change so you don't always see her in a jogging suit and a "Crade" cap. Yes. I remember when she was in eighth grade, she wore a John Starks Knicks sweatshirt all year. She spilled sauce on it and kept wearing it for a month. I had to sneak into her room to donate it to charity.
This is Los Angeles. I'm looking for Den Mother. Anyone receiving? No more. I have the gauntlet, but I can't keep it any longer.
My wife is pregnant. The King! Look at me... all of you. You all have a choice to make. And now is the time to make it.
The King! Look at me... each and every one of you. You all have a choice to make. And now is the time to make it. Live the dream of Versailles... or betray it.
- Yes, I'm here. You come to see me as a last resort? Yes. How far are you prepared to go to win back his love? To possess him forever?
How can you be so calm? You never were a groundhog. Hey, Scarab, stop. Control that thing, Beetle, or I'll do it for you.
Good news. Your heart is fine. But your pacemaker is defective. This type of device has already had two other incidents of low blood pressure in the United States. It needs to be replaced.
There are no other pilots. I'm all you've got. So leave me alone. This is my last recording. Give it to Rittenhouse.
But there was one thing missing. We needed a wiper to keep the glass clean. Richard wanted to capture images underwater. UNDERWATER CAMERA They called us in. This one's a bit dirty. We designed a magnetic arm that propels the wipers around the dome and keeps it clean over a long period.
It's very noisy. Every fish and animal has its part to play. There are those who farm. They grow plants and seaweed. They pick up a piece of seaweed, plant it and watch over the area.
And it's getting worse. I didn't know focus could change over time. Hawaii went white. The worst bleaching on record. And we couldn't film it.
It's flesh. It's living, withering tissue. It's really disgusting. I thought I'd see the bleaching. I thought we'd film it.
I've never tested positive in an anti-doping test. Have you ever taken growth hormones or other doping substances? No. For the sake of clarity. How many times do I have to say it?
It knows how long it takes for a substance to disappear from the body. He knows, and informs us. He's the most eminent specialist. The ARD documentary about the Russian whistle-blowers... What did you think of these allegations? CHIEF INVESTIGATOR, INDEPENDENT COMMISSION They were serious enough that they were afraid to broadcast it, knowing that the whistle-blowers were still in Russia.
These bottles came from Nikita Kamaev. "Grigory Rodchenkov, the director of the lab that handled the testing of thousands of athletes, said he developed a cocktail of three doping products that he mixed with alcohol and supplied to Russian athletes, helping to engineer one of the most sophisticated doping schemes in sports history." FEBRUARY 2014 Support our fight for fair play. Athletes deserve it.
- Come on! We don't have a ring, we rush every step of the way. It's better this way. I'll come up with a plan B. I'll do it for her, for Valentine's Day.
All right, then. We have a filtration system that releases toxins into the air. It operates on a 30-minute cycle. It will release the bacteria into the atmosphere. So turn it off.
You don't think you could turn the Walking Dead theme Into a lullaby. Yeah, I gotta get her to hang on the TV, Or someday she'll want me to play outside. Boy, this floor is so creaky. I'm surprised I didn't wake her up by walking out of the room. Have you tried anything to correct it?
It's an age-old story... they never wake up looking good. Goodbye to the truth? I've come a long way to read this book! 2,000 years, after all. If you don't want me to read it, why don't you stop me before I do.
You haven't read the Veritas. Sorry, we'd love to, but we've got to run. Pick a number. Any number, both of them, right now. And say it as I type on this table.
These people are scared. We can help them a little. In the end, why not just be good? See this face? Look at it carefully.
Listening to your business plan? What was option 1? - Look who I found! - I saw the live feed. I had to see it with my own eyes.
Monday. I've had other offers, Deran. Cash? Who else can offer you this? You can promise me a polar bear if you never intend to give it to me.
First of all, thank you for coming to this event. Can I just add that everyone looks fresh. So, when Aly gets here, I'm going to suggest an activity for the four of us to do. Then, I'll elegantly retire, leaving you two to distract her. while I get ready for... the show! I have a scream and nowhere to put it.
I can't wear this. I like lying. My name isn't even Elliot. It's Jung-yi! I'll take it.
Have you ever wondered why the Black Fairy collects all this dust? Years ago, she used it to create a most terrible spell. It was called the Black Spell. The Black Spell? She was obsessed with perfecting it and never stopped collecting dust.
There's nothing here for you. Good morning, mademoiselle. May I offer you the latest news? The paper's not out yet. I'd be delighted to deliver it personally.
Mine taught me not to starve. Hey! I just sold my last newspaper! - I've got one more. - Sell it or pay for it.
Fine arts? Are you kidding? But you're an artist. You've got real talent. You should be illustrating the paper, not delivering it.
That's a whole other level. His lawyer said you were overcharging. Let me tell you about Frank. He always gets what he wants. But, before he pays you, he finds your weak spot, touches it and offers pennies instead of dollars.
Sarah said Frank would never tell you his dark secrets. My God, she was protecting you. - I have to go. - She was protecting you, and you're going to let her go to jail. It's a very different world... I'd like to keep it that way.
I'd like to know. According to LexisNexis, the only place he was quoted was in a book called "Negotiate Up". Do you know who wrote this book? Yes, I do. I can sign it for you, if you like.
Deran and I bought a bar. - What bar? - It's a wreck, but it'll be cool. That's why I didn't send you any messages, because we're working like crazy. We're giving it our all. Can I come and see it?
- What kind of problems? I'm not sure. I'm just not sure. I get the feeling he needs money, and I'm afraid he's going to toss this thing somewhere it doesn't belong. The bracelet? You want me to sell it? I can sell it.
I know you don't trust him. I don't trust your brother. Neither do you. I don't. Why shouldn't I?
I need to be able to contact you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. What's more, our new product is finally ready. It's been soaking for 20 days. That's twice as long as Ravi's recipe calls for. I need you to take it for a test run.
I need you to track the comings and goings of your zombies and report back to me. And what are you going to do with this information? Something that can't be ignored. What's that? Capture a zombie. Starve him, broadcast him live and let the world see what he becomes.
- Don't do that. - Hi, there. Who's ready to fill their hobby hole? Okay, I don't have a hole. And if I did have a hole, I wouldn't want to fill it with a hobby.
Who's ready to fill their hobby hole? Okay, I don't have a hole. And if I did have a hole, I wouldn't want to fill it with a hobby. Of course you would. Take him with you, Dad.
We've gone from 27 to 30 inches. Your mother won't notice. She's not interested. What happens to "one thing"? If we're paying for this fight, we need to see it on a good TV.
Go away, Clippy. You don't know what I'm doing. Well, stay if you like. You'll get bored. Luckily, I got your old chair back before Jessica sold it at the yard sale.
During a debate, mockery is not tolerated and is not graded. Fortunately, this isn't a debate, and you've got a face like an ass. Dessert? Hector has made an unturned pineapple cake. He's afraid to turn it upside down.
My God, Eddie! The perfect superheroes are right in front of us. Oh, boy. Here's your exemption form, signed by your teacher. I'll put it in your binder.
- Same box. Oh. "His favorite book is 'Good Night, Gorilla'. Every time we read it to him, he wiggles his little legs." And there's a photo of you reading it to me.
I'm sorry. I just... I got carried away. It's just that you look so grown up, and you won't let me touch you anymore. I like the suit, but I think something darker would bring out my eyes. He'd like to see it darker!
Don't you have a wallet? This is so stupid! Where do you keep your money? I've told you. I put it in my sock.
This is so stupid! Where do you put your money? I told you. I put it in my sock. If I'm not wearing any, I put it in my shoe, and if I'm wearing flip-flops, I roll up the bills, tuck them behind my ear, where my illustrious hair holds them in place.
These convictions are also my convictions. So this is about the two of us, okay? You made a mistake, a big one. But you're going to find a way to live with it. And, from now on, you're going to make every day you do this job, a day you do it the right way.
Give it a try. Do you know your neck size? No. Is it serious? We'll take it. Hold still, please.
Help me unload everything. No, I don't want stolen beer, man. It tastes the same, right? What if the truck has GPS or something? Did you think about that before you stole it?
Hello, my mouse. - Where are you off to? - Busy. What about your lunch? Put it on ice.
♪ I don't believe it when you say you don't want me ♪ Don't you want me? ♪ I don't believe you when you say you don't need me ♪ Too late to figure it out when you think you've changed your mind ♪ Change your mind or we'll both pay for it

It's too late to turn back. They've sent us the itinerary, but we've got to be quick. It will only be open for a few vargas. Then it'll close for two quintants. - They'll close it for two? - Two days.
To publicly attack Scientology and break away from it. To do this, you wrote an internal report called a Knowledge Report in Scientology. Knowledge Reports are things Scientologists are supposed to write and report to the Church about non-optimal situations. Scientologists are supposed to write these kinds of reports because they believe that, by writing them, the person guilty of transgressions of one kind or another or doing something wrong will get called to come to the Church and get corrected, which will be for his own good. If you're found guilty of a crime and someone knew about it but didn't tell us, they'll be punished in the same way.
Yes. As many paintings as people come to see. I'm sure they'll be very impressed. I don't remember paying you for the brush. - You can keep it.
- Oh, yes, it was. It wasn't true. I've never read Leah's book. I never... I didn't want to read it, because I'd already experienced it.
As you can see, our firm has plenty of capital and is ready to meet all the conditions for starting business in your country immediately. Including paying "special" fees, so to speak. I'm listening. We have money... A lot of money. And we want to spend it in ways that make our lives easier, including lining the right pockets in Caracas.
We won't get all the power back until it's fixed. We found the generator. You were right about the power surge. And the generator's fried too. I can get the minimum emergency backup power, but that's all we'll have until I fix it.
And underneath all the neurotoxins in your head, you know I'm right. You don't have to be afraid anymore, ever. Hey, Doc. what's going on? The generator over there. To save yourself and your friends, you've got to fix it, fast.
We weren't kidnapped because of you! It's because of me. Hello, Olivier Steele. In the top drawer of the vanity, you'll find a message. Stand in front of the camera and read it aloud.
Here's a phone! The new owners have converted it into a playroom - Put the phone down! - Don't shoot! Put it down!
He's a cop, bro! No, no, I'm not... Come on, let's go, let's go... How does the capital background carry Jane's name? I don't know, but now that we're conscious, we can try to find him, Hope for Shepherd's return.
And I looked for a New York scene with this indoor-outdoor feel. And I thought of the subway. With its windows and people sitting in them. The subway was perfect. That's the idea behind the magazine. It's the plane through which a person passes. You can see it from the inside or the outside.
The wall is really nice, isn't it? It shouldn't be a problem for us. It's really our style. And it's the idea we've developed the most. There are lots of ways of putting it together.
Now, the craft was more or less an oval or egg-shaped contraption. It was not saucer-shaped. This particular loom ... There were a few problems with it... Number one, getting it on the flatbed scanner to take it to Area 51.
You seem moderately satisfied. Well, I am. No. Savor this moment, Francis. You've earned it.
All right, then. Shall we communicate? Where's the truck? We don't know where it is. When will we find it?
Jesus said, "Do you want to be my neighbor?" No, they use it to act crooked. When they humiliate a skinflint at the fork, it's not hypocrisy: "Zipporah took a flint, cut off her son's foreskin - and put it on Moses' feet."
Great. Although I'm not sure I like the idea of being used as a guinea pig. When you get the machine, you'll see how you feel. Maybe I could use it to figure out why women keep dumping me. You don't need a machine, just send a questionnaire to all your exes and tell them that if they fill it in, they might win a present.
I wanted to deconstruct the anatomy of this four-piece band. We could see the singer's mouth, the drummer's nose, the guitarist's eye and the bassist's ear. But in my enthusiasm, I forgot that this was their farewell concert, and that they would be waving to the audience, stepping out in front of their adoring fans. I'd stapled up the curtain, placed them in their boxes, stapled up the projection screen and they couldn't get out. I'm told I should see the movie Spinal Tap. I haven't seen it and I don't want to. Apparently, it's the story of my life.
Crap. What happened? They fell under a sleeping spell so I could save you. Emma... I've been thinking. There might be another way to break it, but it's risky.
That was before I moved to Chicago to be close to Trevor. Trevor has a bank account with practically a quarter of a million dollars in it? Where did all that money come from? I don't know. Did his father give it to him? Did his father give it to him?
All this...it's incredibly compartmentalized, and there's a mechanism set up in Scientology that Hubbard set up very early on.... Either you haven't reached the appropriate level. Mm-hmm. Either you're not... You don't have the f... [bleep] rank to ask for it.
Sorry, man. You know about a Johns family property out of town? What about it? We heard the brothers talking about this place on the bug we planted in Harley's truck. Can you use police resources to track it down?
She said I was in charge. So we're throwing it away? What do you want to do with it? Put it in your coffee? I don't drink it black.
How to smoke in the shower? If you think I'm going to erase decades of tradition as if it were one of my sons.... The Gunless of Washington. Hands off my guns! I might buy a jersey just to riddle it with bullets.
Sounds racist. I like that kind of film. You think it's a documentary, I guess. I learned this from my black buddies: when a movie about slavery comes out, it's not up to the white buddy to suggest going to see it.
But through sheer guilt, I finally went. It was tense and strange. I stayed for a while before leaving. The next week, I got an e-mail on my cell phone that said, "Testament of Daniel J. Brennan." I thought, "Let's open it."
Some kind of drop. I've never seen him use it. All I know is that he gives it to her twice a week. Who does he get the poison from? He's never said. But I can tell you where he keeps it.
But I can tell you where he keeps it. What on earth? You have no right to enter my... Search warrant. I don't know what you're looking for. But I guarantee you won't find it.
Bring them here. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are you going to do with a flare gun? I'm just curious. I'm going to melt some of the rubber floor mat over the hole through the rubber hose and that should seal it.
Can I-- can I make sure it's right? That's a very good point. - Thank you very much. - Why don't you find a big piece of wet tree bark, hold it for me. You're going to hold it between the fuel line and the undercarriage of the wagon.
Man, you'd be very impressed with this new control over my emotional state. Now Paige and Tim are in trouble. No surprise there. 12,000 kilometers apart is not good for love. Yes, like I said, she's hurting, so she needed space and I gave it to her.
Find the right needle among 3 billion other needles. They don't understand the principle of "private conversation"... But they do understand the principle of electrocution, and with every piece of debris you pull out it gets more dangerous, so be careful. You know, I think this painting is a distraction. I'm going to turn it in the opposite direction.
It'll protect her, but she'll need a better breathing apparatus. A full oxygen tank is no match for a Hazmat suit. Paige? Take an earpiece and tell Ada's dad to sterilize it so she can communicate with us when she's in the suit. Copy that. I'll take the filter from the regulator, put it in the mask, cover the ventilation holes with tape and there she'll be able to breathe clean air.
I don't know, I sent you a picture. Wow, that hives is either an allergic reaction or I've never seen one. She's not allergic to the materials in the mask or the suit, what's she reacting to? It's ethylene oxide. We didn't have enough time to ventilate it.
Gunshot wound. Clavicular midline, left fifth intercostal space. What does that mean? It means that if we don't get him to hospital, he'll die. I'll get him to the helicopter and back to you as soon as possible.
Did he escape? We have to find him. How do we do that? She's got a point. He's a monkey in a vast, hostile jungle, and the only person with a clue on how to trap and track him has been shot.
What's on your mind? Wasp bomb. Sorry, I asked. The tree moss is moist enough to create a lot of smoke. The smoke makes the wasps docile, so we cut the nest and carry it back to camp.
Nervous. I've seen what these wasps can do. Please don't let go of that nest. Okay, when he comes back, I'm throwing the wasp nest... You're going to throw it away?
Coming through! I probably have a concussion. Stop being a baby. What's wrong? I'm gonna take this clicker and push it right up your...
There's nothing here to indicate any kind of atypical viral protection. But the monkeys are immune to the virus. How can that be if Toby can't find anything in the DNA? It could be a parasite. So let's open it up and see what's inside.
Now we'll cut down some vines and tie them into ropes. And I can make a grappling hook out of the frame of your backpack. Nobody can throw a grappling hook that high. Especially weighed down by vines. We're not going to throw it, we're going to toss it.
- She fell, Rosa. Oh yes. Besides, it's not about me wanting the record. It's about who holds it.
Land of fruits and nuts. This explains everything. It's the first time I've seen the famous scars on your face... and that's something. Don't tell me the nickname they gave me. I hate it.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Everest. Everest. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'll give you some money. I'm trying to give it back!
Everest. I'm sorry, sir. I'll give you some money. I'm trying to give it back! I'm giving it back.
You're the white guy, Kyle Copner. I haven't seen that movie. Didn't you see the movie that made me want to write Bodyguard 2: Glued Tight? We could see it together.
But why? - Why me? - Don't you know? I think it's because I'm hopping all over campus. Perry is the most promising student in my seminar. He wrote an excellent paper and I asked him to read it in my Intro to Philosophy.
Do you like it? Since the Post, I've felt compelled to wear a vest. What's wrong? Something wrong? I was going to wear it for the launch of a low-fat baby milk.
Pretty sure. We had the DNA tested. How is that even possible? How...I mean, how could she appear with my blood on her? I think it's possible. She was collecting it when she attacked us.
All right, listen. If you don't give him back his money, we're gonna take it out on your car. It's up to you. - Are you serious? - Seriously! And you're gonna give it back with respect.
Okay, look, I've got the money. Don't hurt her, okay? Just tell me what you want me to do. Look at the wall. Yes, I can see it, I can see it.
That's it. If any part of his body touches the platform or the water, he's a goner. We can use the bungee cords that hang from the beds to help. He can grab them from the second bed, and pull it towards him. Grab the bed and pull it back to you.
This dancing soldier overcame obstacles like a dance step. And he's still wearing his beret. I love it! In Level 2, I was already wearing my beret. I'm putting it back on for Level 3, for my comrades.
That's why he's still working. So did you call to make an appointment? Not yet, no. I'll go as soon as I get to the office. Do you want to do it now?
Oh, we know the story, darling. Not this version. Dave made some interesting choices. Good job on the costume. I said I'd do it.
I want her in the crisis room. Is this about the smuggling ring? The CIA found another flight carrying contraband. That's good, isn't it? Not if they shoot it down.
If you wait long enough, something good will come along. Come on, Cupcakes. It's, uh... Frozen broccoli... She's eating it, she's eating it.
We've got a lot of ground to cover in a short space of time, so let's get started. Madam President? Terrorism is never spontaneous. Every act requires preparation and planning. It takes money to fund, strategy to make sure it's done right, technology to be modern, weapons for fear and control, the media to make sure lots of people see it,
- Glory to God. - Amen. The Congo is going through a very complex crisis. The country is rich in minerals, but with the money this has generated, corruption has set in. Rebels, civilians, militias... In the Congo, the underlying notion is that if you want territory, you take it.
Lord of the Dance with Marcy. You don't deserve to see handsome Irishmen tap dancing their way into your heart! Great, great. I'm off to the car show. While there, I'll grab a hot dog, and hopefully someone will give birth in front of me while I'm eating it.
We're all going to come back down to earth real quick right now, because what this guy did is a crime. Congratulations on your commitment. - Thank you for your commitment. - Nobody cares. But you can't do it without... this.
You find me dead. What do you do? I find a dodgy bar near the Ritz-Carlton. I leave a Bronco Blue Jean perfectly tailored for Mr. Favre, and a t-shirt with grass stains on the bathroom floor. I pick up my phone, hire a tractor, drive it straight into the Ritz-Carlton pool.
You just don't get it! To welcome Normals, everything has to be great. What if nobody likes what I do? Clawdeen, it's hard to be creative. You have to open your heart and show it to everyone.
Hey, Clawdeen, I got a question. Is it okay if I talk to my Normal musician friends about the show? Sure, Ari. That'd be great. And it's okay if they publish it online?
Oh, that's all right. I got you a little good-luck present. A traditional outfit. An aeropostale jacket. You can wear it.
Take the tarpaulin from the bottom of the truck and I'll find a heat source that will seal the seam. This lighter should provide enough light. Care to explain? We're building a balloon. We'll fill it with methane.
What do I look like? Like an idiot? Okay, thanks. I've been on the phone for an hour about pastries. Toby wants a spumone cake, but Happy wants it in the shape of a powertrain control module.
It won't crash because gravity will pull the capsule down. And it will only go up to 200 km/h, terminal speed. So, if we cut the chopper's engine at a given moment, it will be in free fall alongside the capsule. At the same speed and in parallel, the chopper will reach out with its arm and grab the capsule's docking mechanism. There, I reignite the helicopter with maximum upward force to arrest the fall and land it safely in their air base.
But these can spread rapidly. Imagine the most deadly, transmissible flu with no known cure. So what can we do? We need to sterilize the asteroid. To do this, we need to heat it to 3,000 degrees.
We need to sterilize the asteroid. To do this, we need to heat it to 3,000 degrees. At 3,000 degrees, palladium turns into palladium oxide. All our work will be lost. So we don't do it.
She's gone. Is she gone for the day, or is she gone, gone? She's gone, gone. But the important thing is that Patel is out, and you're in. The job's yours if you want it.
Is she gone for the day, or is she gone, gone? She's gone, gone. But the important thing is that Patel is out, and you're in. The job's yours if you want it. Yeah, I'm not gonna take it.
Go, Chang Suk Bang! Go, Chang Suk Bang! He's tying his shoelace again. Take your time. You've earned it.
For Latinos, she's a superhero. A Mexican-American singer. She died over 20 years ago, but people still talk about her. "If Selena were here..." "If Trump built a wall, she'd bring it down with her voice!"
"I'd love to grow up outdoors, but... gangs." Is this chicken expensive, because I'm paying for the hobbies it had when it was alive? This chicken costs $20 a kilo, because he played the cello and surfed. This chicken is great! Why do we eat it?
I've done some research. They have nothing to do with what's going on. About an hour ago, I received a package. It was inside. Open it up.
They have nothing to do with what's going on. About an hour ago, I received a package. It was inside. Open it up. "Do you want it back?
Oh, you know, It's the type of phone you'd use to cheat on your husband or make a call From a jail cell, or in Sabine's case, Talks about her boyfriend With nefarious types Not wanting this to get out. She talked a lot with someone about your father. I'm not answering any more questions. If you know something about Sabine's murder, If you think your father was behind it, You can tell us.
I'd rather have a 1% chance with a real human than a 100% chance with rubber. Guys, Broden was with her when he started having trouble breathing. She might have recorded what happened to him. Yeah... we got a problem. We can't see him here.
It may be underwater. I looked into Unger's financials. One of the last places he paid was a bar, The Salty Bog. Near the Brooklyn Marina. A popular spot for wreck divers and tugboats. If Unger knew the location of the sunken treasure, he needed someone with the skills and equipment to recover it.
He said he had Black Peter's logbook. Any idea who? The logbook was used to locate a sunken Spanish galleon called the Santa Laeticia. Supposedly sunk with a lot of gold aboard. He wanted a boat and the gear to tow it.
He asked Vestergaard to tow the wreck. Vestergaard refused, because he had applied for the vessel a year before. You have the equipment and know-how to launch the same operation. We believe that Unger approached you to make a deal. You understood that by reaching the treasure before Vestergaard did, you would be preserving him and damaging his company.
That was the Brexit. They passed it off as an economic thing. In truth, it was just people wanting their country back. It hadn't gone anywhere. But they wanted it back.
Like when you hear your heart beating in your head. I stood up, "Oh, I feel terrible." When I got up... I could feel the vomit coming. I could feel it...
We should say: "Don't do your penis". Scotland has taught me so many things. A beautiful place, beautiful people, rich in culture. My favorite thing was trying to learn the Scottish accent. I'm butchering it, but it doesn't matter.
Whoever you are, you shouldn't mess with Russians because of that accent. Everybody's afraid of Russians. They do this thing when they talk. They're scary. And you see it every day.
Today, those gold bars are worth a good $40 million. Minus the one I sold to Yaniv, and I guess he's got it all now. Once we were in the States, I was in charge of this. Keeping it here in this electronic safe.
Worst of all, I sent Bernie a Christmas card from Trixie. Howard! Let me finish... in one card I put $5 I took from Bernie's purse. The diary's not in the bathroom. I can't find it either.
Did you try letting go of the rope? Are you crazy? I'm on a unicycle. Have some fun. Wait, I need help getting off. What do I have to do? Bring your mattress here, then go across the street, get their mattress and put it here. But first, scratch my nose.
It was his job to keep an eye on him. Now it was up to him to catch up. Ford had realized that, in wartime, the American public wanted to understand and have a direct, realistic view of the conflict, whereas this film was trying to create a kind of Hollywood-style semi-fictional mishmash. So Ford did what he knew how to do. He was known for taking a script and stripping it down to its essence.
This vision unfortunately coincides with the way Japan was struck... by the most violent of instruments of extermination. PRESIDENT TRUMAN A few hours ago, an American plane dropped a bomb on Hiroshima. This city is now lost to the enemy. If they don't accept our terms, we'll bring them a rain of devastation the like of which has never before been seen on Earth. Already on their way, copies of the film arrive at the front three days after the atomic bomb is dropped on Hiroshima. General MacArthur informs Washington that he will not allow soldiers to view the film, and recommends that it not be shown publicly.
Because it's important. If we weren't together, and you'd been offered the same promotion, would you have taken it? Yes, I would have. Then you should take the job, Reagan. Okay, I'll take it.
- I don't see how that's relevant. - Yes, you do. Because you're a fan of The Crown. - I watch a lot of shows. - And so, you know... removing a piece of wire from a man's sleeve... is a very intimate gesture. I'll leave it here.
Reagan, what the... Just tell him what it's about. He wrote this book. It's about a man who has nothing, and will risk everything to feel something. I'll take it. Will you sign it for me?
Cece, come look at this. Cece, come look at this. Did that just lock everything? One button secures every entry point to the entire house, giving us real-time comfort and peace of mind. Okay, can I unlock it?
Come on, let's go! - Where to? - My office. No, that's not a good plan. I can call my assistant and have her fax it.
"You should stay home. It's everywhere." I was so hungry I asked the steward, "Can I go finish my sandwich somewhere else?" "You can finish it in the bathroom."
There's some stashed away too There's walnuts in the pesto Walnuts are too good I said, "Hey, doesn't she know that?" Where's my sandwich? I just took it out
It's not stupid. I just finished moving into my new apartment! - What's up? - Well, congratulations, you guys. - When are we going to see it?
The thing that shoots cosmic rays? Here's why I rent. Sources say a wormhole has opened on Earth and released a fleet of mysterious alien ships. President Luthor, golfing in Mar-A-Luthor, tweeted back, "A space wall will be built, and the aliens will pay for it."
Oh, no, you don't. I think that's a bad idea. All right, fine. What the hell, right? So, take this metal stick and connect it to the battery when Teddy sprays you with the products.
Well, not you, which means you're very good at your job, and so am I. I'm a media consultant with a very long list of clients. Including a very large pharmaceutical company that would love to crush a mediocre competitor without delay... PhioGen. A false story about the side effects of their new anti-epileptic treatment could nip it in the bud before it's even on the market.
But she hasn't used anything yet. So, for the first time, we have a chance to get ahead of a collaborator before they act? Exactly. She accessed the cache this morning on her phone, flipped her IP to a single server in Riyadh. Shelby, thanks for offering your contact for this, but we're able to trace it back to Rebecca.
Not hard to do once you've got the password. Rebecca is old-fashioned. Her computer is more likely to be a Commodore than a Macbook, so she probably has a rudimentary password. That's the good news. The bad news is that we can't hack it remotely, so we'll have to use good, old-fashioned human intelligence.
You don't say. Here it is, the thorium reactor. Who tinkered with this? She's taking all the energy for her precious plants, but I cut an opening so things could be a bit more equitable. So, she siphons off the power and you try to get it back.
It's a recipe for disaster. I'm sure Jen has the sound and light on in her cell for Mr. Harvard. This sucks. The system is overheating. Can you fix it?
Ammonium nitrate? Stop digging. Do you have pure ammonium nitrate in the lab? We can use it to freeze the soil. Once frozen, it can be broken into movable blocks and removed in a matter of minutes.
Let's blow this damn door off its hinges. Find some aluminum oxide. Calcium hydroxide. - Got it. - Pour it in.
The raid was a big defeat but we've got nothing to hide, so let's face it. I just got the results back on another tattoo. Should we wait until the depositions are over? No, nothing changes. We've got a job to do, so let's get out there and do it.
5 minutes later the house was empty. All six children missing, no sign of the foster mother. - Did you try calling her? - Yes, but her phone's switched off. We're tracing it now.
And now they have it. - I'll get you some new equipment. - It's not that easy. My equipment is specialized. You can't just replace it.
I won't do it. I swear I won't. I have a son. I don't care about the equipment. Keep it.
Werner was very impressive to me then. An international arms dealer, a smuggler, A game of almost any illicit trade one could imagine. I wanted an alliance - to become Werner's most reliable associate. Raymond devised a plan based on an ancient principle. If you want your enemy to become your friend, create a problem for him, then solve it.
No. No, no, no. That's not gonna-- don't screw that up here, Danny. I know it. I know it. I'm not going to screw it here.
Give me the screwdriver. It's my screwdriver. It's mine. Will you take instructions? This is my drill and it's mine and you just stole it.
Let's go. DANNY: I hid the ambulance behind the house. How is he? His respirator's almost out of battery, so we had to plug it into an outlet.
When desire is gone. There are no women there. But this desire... This rising wave drawing you to the sea... Wouldn't killing a man satisfy it?
I didn't fight for Skaikru today. I thought I was fighting for myself, but now I also know that's not true. I fought for all of us. Skaikru won't take this bunker alone. We'll share it equally, because we're all equal.
Yes, but the probability is lower and it's worth a try. We have to stop playing defense if we want to overtake them. Fine, but we need to take extra precautions. I want you to get Tasha false papers, with concrete guardrails... and a way to reach us. I'll get you a prepaid cell phone, but you'll have to sneak it in.
Patterson, what have you got for us? Actually, this is Stuart, one of my lab techs. Where's Patterson, Stuart? She had to leave, but there was an alarm you should know about. Agent Zapata's phone lit up briefly just long enough to trace it.
It'll take a while, but I think he'll be back. I'll take your word for it. I cut my finger. Hurry up and put it under some cold water.
I have to tell you, I've requested a transfer. What? Where? Where? Quantico. A position as a criminal profiling instructor has opened up, so I'm going to take it.
My hands don't fit, so... Let me get through. You're going to put your hand through this little opening. Remove the alternator. It's asymmetrical, so you'll twist and turn to remove it.
Now. Quantico? You really want to talk about this now? There may not be a next time, and I don't want to die with you thinking I agree with your silly idea to leave. If I can't do the job the way I used to, I shouldn't do it at all.
How long until... How long until... We have 30 minutes until it hits the capitol. Patterson, what is it? I couldn't hack it in time, but the glider seems to be in communication with a homing beacon.
It might take a while, but I'm sending an app to your phone, I've reprogrammed it. It might be able to detect the beacon. Time remaining 19:02... Okay, I've got my phone in hand. Ok, open it and scan the place like you have a metal detector.
Corey? He's a good kid. That doesn't sound like him. I don't disagree. It looks like someone put him up to it.
I'd be happy to record it anyway. What you did for Corey Jenkins, protecting him by telling him not to testify, I don't know too many, police officers who would have done that. I have an officer on leave. We could use a hand. I have an open position in intelligence, if you'd like.
So, Mr. Halstead, the angio results reveal that your heart has been stressed for so long because of the valve failure that it has virtually stopped everything. That's why I asked you to get regular checkups. If we'd known about the overload, we could have anticipated all this. Oh yeah, and what? We're going to treat him now.
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Hi, we're the Croods of Ahh Valley. Or at least we were, until my dad got tired of the place and decided to leave and run away.
Did you ever imagine that one day we'd be working together back when I was a bad guy? Who said you were a good guy? I don't understand, why hide the trigger in an app? Security? If someone has access to your phone, you won't see it.
I took your advice. What do you think? Don will love it. And he can reuse the basket for lots of stuff. Picnics, a planter. He could put it on the front of his bike with a little dog in it.
I should inform Lisa that this honeypot already has a fierce and beautiful bear. I'll call her tomorrow. What? No, I don't think you should do that at all. No, I don't think you should do that at all. I think you should let it go. Just choke it down, bag it up, and flush it down the drain.
Is this a good place for a picnic? All right. Let's see what we've got here. Let's see what we've got here. This isn't what I had in mind. This basket is filled with toys and treats. Melissa, did you empty this basket and fill it with toys and treats for Jasper?
What if the test went wrong? If something went terribly wrong? You're fine. But you don't really know that, do you? So the owner opens the door, sees the bag burning, stomps on it, and his foot is covered in dog shit.
We're about to turn it on. Rex and I did our best, but it's Sabine's baby. So it should work. There are a lot of modifications and fuses. We didn't test it when Sabine was still here, so if it overheats, we probably won't be able to fix it.
- The Interdictor destroyed? - We're working on it! Chopper, get us out of here! Governor, we have a problem. I don't want to hear it!
- Okay. spittoon. This spittoon belonged to my great-grandfather... a general in the Confederate Army. Okay, not so unfair. Thank you. [Chuckles] I keep it here to remind myself never to end up like him.
So, to prevent the fire from reaching the cable, we need to delineate the exact contours of the burning lode - and put it out. - We can use the same imaging technique we used to locate the hikers in the forest fire two years ago. All we need to do is add a thermal component to detect the fire's path. We can link it to one of the national security surveillance satellites and get a complete view of the vein in one aerial shot.
Happy, where are we with the solution? We've got something. The chief's fire station protects the airport, which means they've got a drum of high-expansion foam for gasoline engine fires. We'll remove the end of the hose. Cabe will slide it into the stone hole.
We've got something. The chief's fire station protects the airport, which means they have a drum of high-expansion foam for gasoline engine fires. We'll remove the end of the hose. Cabe will slide it into the hole in the rocks. You have to tie a knot at the bottom of the hose and put it under the stones that are trapping you.
And then... Walter just stands up, runs as fast as he can into the wall, bam, the stones fall. Or the fire truck backs up, pulling the knotted hose behind it, bringing the wall down. That's another way of doing it. Right there! Slide it right up to him.
One of you has to come up with a plan to open the dashboard. I've already asked myself that question. The panel is compromised. If we use force to free Scotty, it could cause him serious injury. We need to melt it and bend it like a hinge.
Ask the kid with the two T-shirts to do it. Sir, if I may say so, we've put a lot of work into the current prototype. It's a very elegant solution, and more importantly, it works. You're quite right. And thank you for presenting it so clearly.
I am. Oh, and to be clear, I'm not being intimate with you to keep you from leaving. I didn't think so. No, I'm, I'm warning you, you know, if you find yourself 4828 kilometers away and you're craving a hit of that, you know I can't Skyp you.
Chin, I'm here and Grover. Go ahead. I went through Khalid's credit cards, and it turns out he bought a prepaid phone from a convenience store three days ago. I got the manager's number. I'm tracing it right now.
I don't either. You know, in four years, Katie's going away to college. And then, in twelve years, they'll all be gone. Maybe we'll be one of those couples who gets a little dog and walks it in a stroller.
What is it? It's that Portuguese stuff Happy used. No, underneath it's metal. It's a barrel. Help me dig it up!
shh This engine is a small, high-altitude flying accessory. It's not looking for people. This is data collection. Our only hope is to report it.
- of my life. - Well, neither do I. I wonder who's better. You know, Emily, once a glove is thrown, it can't be picked up. I don't want to pick it up.
Why don't we play tomorrow? If I win, your "closet" becomes my office again. Steve! If you win, you can turn it into a unicorn stable. I don't care because it's a fairy tale!
I learned everyone's first name. Emily... I've been thinking. Even though you lost the game and the office is mine to do with as I please, I'm going to give it to you anyway.
Would you like a pekpek? Here, it's free!" "Pekpek" means "sex." Some understood, others thought, "She's giving away chicken? Every weekend she has a chicken and she's giving it away?
And it's delicious when it's free." He didn't know that, so I had to explain what free milk was. "Joe, free milk is a milk carton that looks like a Monopoly house. There are three simple instructions. You pull the right side to the right, the left side to the left, then you pinch the middle, pull it towards you and it's supposed to make a spout.
"Joe, free milk is a milk carton that looks like a Monopoly house. There are three simple instructions. You pull the right side to the right, the left side to the left, then you pinch the middle, pull it towards you and it's supposed to make a spout. But it never makes a spout. So you turn it upside down and start again.
But it never makes a spout. So you turn it upside down and start again. This side is too stuck. Impossible to open this side. You tear it in the middle.
She's seen it. She's an adult. She knows what her teenager is doing. She just never said anything to her idiot son. But she knew.
I'm not sure. I just know it's the only thing in the warehouse that hasn't been bleached. Did the hit team forget about it? That's a good question. Worth following up. But I wasn't talking about the aquarium when I said you won't believe it, or rather, won't like it.
It's easy to talk about it in theory. The truth is, you really have to have the confidence to stand up for what you believe in, not in theory, but in a situation where you have to be brave when it counts. When I read the ninth episode, I called someone in my family who'd been raped, and she was so relieved that we were addressing this horror frankly, because she believes it's the only way to get across what goes on in a rape victim's head and what she has to go through. I remember reading the script. Just reading it on paper was horrifying. Then having to bring it to life was really difficult. I can't even imagine what these girls or any victim of sexual assault is going through.
I need a horse. Where are you planning to go? To the village where we found the Titan who couldn't walk. Ragako? I need to see it... with my own eyes.
They never know anything. "Do you know anything about him?" "He's afraid of coins. We think someone was throwing coins at him. Otherwise, nothing else." This dog, about whom you know nothing, you take him home with your family, and watch his personality reveal itself.
By holding it by the heel. That's an important detail. By the heel. Funny way to hold a baby. By the heel. Try holding a baby by the heel and plunging it into a river.
What does she... While we're at it. Was there a sign: "One dip per goddess"? Have you ever painted an Easter egg? Well, it's simple. You dip it once. Then you hold it differently and dip it again.
My dick is waking up. What are you doing in here? I've never seen the whole movie. I've never seen Magic Mike in its entirety. Because I don't want to see it in its entirety.
Talk about recipes! Damn it! What are you doing in here? I lost my sweater. I'm looking for it.
Was that the message? We thought it said, "ratopours papa loves bird butt." Try one-handed aussitôgramming. Hang on a sec. I want to apologize before you move it.
The one who smells the fart is the one who let it go. He who speaks without delay smells even worse, Cyclopambre. He who makes a wisecrack is the one who made it. It's getting worse. I can even taste it.
I gave some to this rat-pig. Take a look. He doesn't look so bad. That wasn't the first test, Grug. All right, Grug. So maybe it's lethal. Or maybe it's the cure. We'll have to test it. There's only one man for the job.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Come on. I want to find a cure, but not if it's going to deform my friend. I got us into this mess, so I'm going to test the remedy myself. We need to massage it.
Is that why you're here? To travel safely? Yes, Werner's death has cost me my access to and from the continent. And I'm sure whoever has my jet right now is wondering if they're going to keep it, or at what astronomical price they'll be able to sell it back to me.
Do you know each other? Donald was the public face of the manhunt for Raymond when he was on the run with Elizabeth Keen. Everyone in my entourage knows Donald Ressler. We're here to make a deal with you. If there's a deal to be made, I'll make it with Agent Ressler.
When my father died, he stuck me in an orphanage. Look at this! Look at this! I ordered spicy noodles instead of plain noodles and he hit me with an ashtray. You deserved it then.
How did she find it? I hid it in my sock drawer. That's where he used to hide his girlie magazines when we were kids. Hey, you're older but you're still kinky. Don, they'll wipe the computer before they share it with the public.
Hey, you're bigger, but you're still kinky. Don, they'll wipe the computer before they share it with the public. No, no, they can't. I've got personal stuff on there. I have to get it back.
Maybe I don't mean more time, but another time. I'm particularly tense. A few people came in for quick interviews and all I wanted was for them to leave quickly. Our appointment won't be a quick interview. I prefer the reporter, knowing what he represents.
NOW SHE'S GOING IN CIRCLES. OH, NO, I'M SURROUNDED. Rafa, did I leave the screen at your place? Is it here? I'll come and get it.
What are you? At first, I answered: I'm a man. I use language, culture, etc. that are considered feminine. I'm invading that domain and claiming it as my own too.
- No, it's not. Sonar. First question from the tourists: "Does your boat have sonar?" Then why are you selling it?
So you want to sell me your sonar? You're working on Loch Ness. It'll pay for itself in no time. If there was something down there, I'd consider it, but... Leighton, maybe you don't want to see it.
"Impression"? Have you seen anyone? Nope. Look, I'm trying to establish how the heart got there. If you saw someone, they could have dropped it off after you left.
Your ticket arrived. I printed it out for you. Thank you so much. Evie. Could Jonjo or Kieran have put it there without you knowing?
It turns, tilts, tilts, pans. You're looking at the future. I'm not buying your sonar. That's cool. I'll sell it on eBay.
Victim of harassment. The calls are a hoax. I'll tell you something in confidence. There's a vacancy for a commissioner. I'm aiming for it.
Where did you find this list? In a shared dream. A shared dream? You manipulate brain waves to get into someone else's dream. I found someone who knows how to do it.
I know you didn't feel valued at Pearson Specter, and I wanted to apologize on my behalf. I wanted you to know that it wasn't my intention to get you fired. I hope you're not here to give me my job back. - And if I were? - I wouldn't take it.
I canceled it. - I don't get it. - I arrived late and a woman started showing me the options. But then I realized... I spent more time thinking about who was giving Bratton Gould the information rather than what color the towels should be. So you don't want to do it at the Plaza anymore?
He was a very cold person. I served mass for several priests. And one day, we were getting ready for mass. We altar boys arrived a little early. Maskell enters the sacristy, pulls a pistol from his pocket and places it on the counter.
He was a homosexual. Back then, in the early '60s, it was taboo. It had to be kept secret. To be kept in the closet. This environment had ruined him. Billy couldn't take it anymore.
For the time being. Good. One family will be very happy. Honey, what are you talking about? I was thinking of giving him up for adoption.
A technical pen and a necklace. Nice. Where's it from? It's an heirloom. I'll take it for $20.
Easy, now. It's just a myth. Deep down, this pendant is just a finely polished stone. It's a shame. If it was magic, I could have sold it on the net.
I don't want this magic stuff! It doesn't even fit me. I kept it as a souvenir. I just want to know where it came from. You tell me, and I'll give it to you.
I had no idea. I was the guardian of the totem pole. I had to make sure our village wasn't in danger. It's horrible. Zambezi is nothing but ashes, but it's still my home, and my sacred obligation is to protect it.
Which one to fight fire with? Water. I spent 6 months in Zambezi. The water totem isn't there. I know where it is. But if you want, I'll go with you.
I can't believe an ancient, overpowering totem is gathering dust in a Star City storefront. The water totem traveled far and wide before being auctioned off in your country. It arrived here 2 months ago. Its owner thinks it's a collector's item. Have you been following it all this time?
The water totem traveled a long way before being sold at auction in your country. It arrived here 2 months ago. Its owner thinks it's a collector's item. Have you been following it all this time? I hope one day to have the money and power to bring it back to Zambezi. Where it belongs.
"You have hooks for hands. I don't know how to do it." She would have gone, "Thanks for being honest with me." No one ever is. "Yes, you can squeeze it, any way you want."
And this is the soul of the whole set. This is the original Cosby Show stoop. We got it for a song. They paid us to take it. They said, "This thing is jinxed, take it away."
If you say so. Right this way, Agent Penguin. Honey, look! - Zahid has your number? - I gave it to him in case of emergency.
Enjoy the party. - Thank you for your time. - Enjoy your evening. All right, here we go. Paige lost her necklace on Tuesday. All I have to do is retrace her steps to find it.
Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. As promised, here's the manuscript. Right on schedule. I'll read it carefully.
Pork or chicken? Chicken. With egg, too? Yes, please. I'll make it.
I've heard that 400,000 copies have already been sold. Have they? That's great! Isn't it great? Lots of people are reading it.
Oh, excuse me. Oh, hi there. I'm so sorry for your loss. Let's see, this... was found on the victim's body. You can have it back.
Cat? Come on. We took him because we thought he was yours. Yes, it's our cat. Minami must have been protecting him.
- King Alfor's ships. - Is this possible? Could other Alteans have survived? What if someone cloned the signal to lure us in? The signal comes from an Alter ship. We're going to find it.
I woke up on a Galra ship. You've just unlocked the Black Lion's teleportation ability. Maybe he teleported you to try and save you. By teleporting me to the Galra lair? Maybe Zarkon forced him to do it.
It's good wine. Very good wine. Would I give you bad wine for my family's survival? Keep it. Take it with you.
The throne is still there. - Where is the king? - He will come. And his kingdom will last forever. Will a carpenter build it?
Let's go to the bathroom. This is the common area. Perfect for relaxation. As you can see, I've planned everything for a long stay. The aquaponics system purifies and renews the air.
Not that I want to tell you how to run the place, but I was wondering about Michelle. How close was she to the filtration unit? Do you think she touched it? Yeah, she had to touch it.
Stay out of this. She doesn't know what you're talking about. I wanted your gun. So I had... I thought I'd make a weapon and take it from you.
You're stabbing me? You bastard! The brick, Seth! Use the cinder block! It's moving, come on, take it!
Doctor Palmer will assist me. Thank you, Dr. Palmer. Image guidance. We don't have time for that. You can't do it blind.
In fact, I didn't treat it. He couldn't walk. I convinced him otherwise. You're not saying it was psychosomatic? When you repair an injured nerve, are you the one who rebuilds it, or is it his body?
Time loops! Do you want to get stuck, reliving the same moment, over and over, for all eternity, or never having existed at all? Seriously, they should put warnings before instructions. Your curiosity could have killed you. You weren't manipulating the space-time continuum, you were breaking it!
For now, yes. Not forever? We're not clairvoyant. When are you going to tell me what we are? While heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers, we wizards keep it safe from more mystical threats.
Humanity aspires to eternity, to a world free of time, for it is time that shackles us. Time is an affront. Death is an affront. Doctor, we don't seek to control this world. We seek to save it, to hand it over to Dormammu, who is the culmination of evolution, the reason for all existence.
you grabbed the bride's bouquet. Oh, Brad. The river was deep But I crossed it Janet The future belongs to us, let's prepare it
We're good. What the hell is that thing? Looks like one of those things you use to make cotton candy. It's a KPE detector. If there's a ghost hanging around, this little gadget will spot it.
- Yeah. - Yeah, I saw a ghost. - You, too? Oh, yeah. Could you describe it for us?
It was really great. That was amazing. Everyone thinks this video is fake. Look at the comments. We need to get a ghost back to the lab and film it, okay girls.
And until we find the best way to preserve this entity, I'm not going to see it. And you think that's okay with me? I'll come along. You've captured a ghost. I can't see it.
Yeah, that's a great hat. All right, buddy. Thanks for stopping by. Well, I guess the pleasantries are over. You want to see it?
- So it's hard to get it back in. - It can be done. - But that's why we use that saying. - But it doesn't make sense. If the cat's out of the bag, you can't put it back in!
I bag cats all the time. Yeah, but once the cat's out of the bag, isn't it kind of like, "oh! the cat's out of the bag!" We just want to put the damn cat back in the bag. The cat's been out other times before, and after a while people lose interest and put it back in.
- Oh! Yeah, I made a mistake. That was a mean explosion. This little gem I call a ghost crusher. It's a suction laser that attracts ghosts and neutralizes them.
You found my hose. I picked it up at the junkyard yesterday. I'm going to use it to make a proton gun. Isn't that cool? If it doesn't work, we can always spin it around and break stuff. It's a win-win.
So much the better. Because BCCI values its reputation. - Listen, I assure you... - No, no, no. It's up to us to convince you, Mr Musella. We can turn your money into gold and diamonds and keep them in our vaults, or we can transfer it to Paris or to our parent company in London or anywhere else in the world and wire it to Panama.
I can't find my module. I can't find my module. It doesn't matter. - Aurora. - I can't find it.
You have a purpose. You're always happy. How's your book going? I've never written about myself before. I think it's the best work I've ever done, and I don't even know why I'm doing it.
You're always happy. How's your book going? I've never written about myself before. I think it's the best work I've ever done, and I don't even know why I'm doing it. There's only one person who reads it, and I can't stand her.
- Something big. A vital system has fallen off somewhere. Everything else on board is trying to pick up the load, but the load is too heavy. We've got to find that starting point. - And fix it.
Light. I'm sorry, sir. As soon as I remove this module, the whole computer will shut down. What happens then? I'll get it back as soon as I can.
She's taken over Dr. Moone's body. Where is this witch? In my pocket. Tell me why she wouldn't turn you into a frog. They say the witch has a heart buried in secret... And that whoever finds it can control the witch.
Shit! Shit! Shit! Brother, help me. Before she kills me. Where's your heart? I'll take it back.
Desire becomes surrender. Surrender becomes power. Do you want this? I want that. Then say it.
Do you want this? I do. Say it. Say it. Say it.
You know you have their only embryo? - It's a baby now. - They don't have another one. In the eyes of the law, you carry it, so it's ours. We can decide to keep it for ourselves at any time.
Dopinder, I think there's a reason I'm in this cab today. Yes, you called a cab. No, my thin, dark friend. Love is a wonderful thing. When you find it, the whole world tastes daffodils.
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. There were lots of experimental drugs from Germany. Vanessa is already working on plans A, B and all the way to Z. Me? I memorize the details of his face. It's like seeing him for the first time.
"Ironic? - Ding-dong! Come back down. - What are you doing? Will, if you tell me to take our entire marketing budget and blow it on a billboard with nothing but pictures of big veiny dicks, I'll do it!
But we all need a job. So what do we do? Chug, chug, chug! Find the thing you're supposed to do. Get off your ass and do it.
He trusted you. We trusted you. You both made a mistake. You want power? Come and get it
And Jake Ryan picked her up in a Porsche. Definitely. Did you see the movie? I'm black, so I don't know... You gotta see it.
This is a private airfield. I understand, but I've got an organ in that cooler that needs to be shipped right away. Really? My sister-in-law had a heart transplant last year, and we didn't bring it in a Playmate cooler. I hate to break it to you, but it's not a...
You've seen it? I know I have. All of a sudden, he's got me by the testicles. I was just about to finish my book. I wanted to have the weekend to polish it.
I know you don't need luck. But I'm telling you, "Fuck it." Fuck the president. Shit and die. May they take his heart out while it's still beating and raise it above his body, in front of everyone.
Come on. I read your book. I read your book. It's gripping. Your flight leaves in 20 minutes. Take it and never come back.
I had one case study, in Brazil, in which the patient didn't describe the circle as a symbol of fear. Instead, he associated the word "enemy" with it. Of course he did. Their enemy is our ally. Your laser is smoking. Get it out of here.
- Attention. This old radar truck was supposed to go to the Smithsonian. Nobody took it. Just as well. Take it to the highest point.
- My mail? - Right away. A parcel has arrived for... For Mr. Mooney. - I don't know if you want it.
I have a... I have a granddaughter, that's all. - No, you don't! - Yes, it is. That's the prettiest grandma I've ever seen. There's a smile under there. Someday I'll see it.
Yes. I think everyone deserves to be happy. I'm not happy. Branche, I know you have happiness inside of you. You just need our help to find it.
But my father said the first time should be special. Well, you're the king now. Yeah, I'm the king. But I think I should share this moment with the whole kingdom. Eat it!
Are you finally happy? Are you happy now? I think so. Happiness is inside all of us, isn't it? Sometimes you just need someone to help you find it.
Eat! No! Happiness is not something you put inside. It's already there. Sometimes you just need someone to help you find it.
I was born in Missoula, Montana. Then my parents bought a house in Sandpoint, Idaho. I lived there for two years. I remember one thing. My friend, little Dickie Smith, and I were bathing in a mud puddle under a tree. My mother had dug a hole, or maybe my father, for us to bathe in when it was hot. They'd fill it with water from the hose. And we stayed in that mud puddle.
When I was in this space, I was out of sight. There were other spaces like that around me where you could work undisturbed. At the time, I was painting a 120 cm by 120 cm picture. It was mainly black, but there were also plants and green leaves peeking out from the black. I was taking a break, probably smoking while I was looking at it.
- Bianca. Bianca, of course. Bianca left me your name. She also left me something else. I'm looking for it for her.
Are you lonely, Charlie? What kind of question is that? You and your questions... What do you mean by that kind of question? You know, I hear in these programs they have for some of these trucks you can adopt a dog and take it on the road with you.
And then she disappeared, like a mirage. There, gone, then back again. I never knew where she went or why I missed all those moments when she was so close. I know I've hidden a bag here somewhere. I just can't find it.
There, gone, then back again. I never knew where she went or why I missed all those moments when she was so close. I know I've hidden a bag here somewhere. I just can't find it. I can't find it, there must be something left...
I never knew where she went or why I missed all those moments when she was so close. I know I've hidden a bag here somewhere. I just can't find it. I can't find it, there must be something left... I hid it in one of these pockets so no one could find it, and now I can't.
I'm glad you're on call. - Is she awake? - Yeah, she just woke up. She was so excited about the baby. She really wanted it.
I won the fight. Everyone saw it. They can't take her away from me. Yes, they can take your title away. And they will if you refuse to defend it.
Mine and yours. They took our damn names off. Oh, you idiot! They can't revoke the license, all right? They can't steal it.
{\1cH00ffff} - Destination? - Deepwater Horizon. {\1cH00ffff}What have you been up to? {\1cH00ffff}I've been tinkering with my hovercraft. {\1cH00ffff}I'm pumping it up from 600 hp to 1200 hp.
It's Aunt Sussie. I thought you might like to open this gift. It's from your grandfather. I found it when I was tidying up. I thought he intended to give it to you one day.
Speaking of my traveling companion... He's on his way. And trust me, you don't want to be here when he gets here. So, shall we get started? I mustn't forget our calendar. Would you mind fetching it from the parlour, please, Miss Avocet?
... on a gray coat. You discover this gray hair... And he says, "Put this on it." Really? I was going to shake it, pour it and wait for it to cool. Like a tarte Tatin.
And we'd spotted a deer, so you raised your rifle. But the deer looked at you and continued grazing. He wasn't afraid. You tried to pull the trigger, but couldn't. So you cried. So you cried, like a little girl. I had to take the gun from you, and kill it for you.
Dude! Dude! You don't have to threaten me. I'm your partner. That's not the impression I'm getting. I got this deal and I'm here. I'm doing the work and you're sabotaging it in Miami.
I'm your partner. That's not the impression I'm getting. I found this contract and I'm here. I do the work and you sabotage it in Miami. What do you mean, I'm sabotaging it?
I was... misinformed. You stuffed me in the trunk of a car and pulled a gun on me by mistake? I'm not a bad guy, but in some situations... I have to ask myself: I appreciate you not mentioning my name. I had no reason to.
The Indianapolis is a heavy cruiser designed to eliminate enemy ships and aircraft. But our weapons are useless against submarines. That's why we're usually preceded by destroyers that block any attack. They detect and destroy enemy submarines with depth charges, before they can reach us. Our crew is made up of kids who have no idea of the dangers we face at sea. If an enemy submarine fires on us and we miraculously spot it in time, we have a maximum of four minutes before the torpedo hits us.
If they come after us, we'll kill them in the mountains. Magnet. Too heavy. - Useless. - I'll take it.
After the siege in Rwanda, they asked us for a tool capable of freezing or boiling the enemy's water supply. This device could have dislodged the enemy. Did you test it on living beings? That wasn't our intention in the first place. Test it.
They need your help. Think of it as defense. I'm restarting the guidance system. It's locked. We have to get it out.
- With what? - With everything in this shelter. Everything with electronics, optics. All the equipment brought back from the base. We can take it apart and build an arsenal.
Desmond, we can't take your blood two days in a row. All right, then. Can I have mine back? What? No. My blood, I need it back.
Can I have mine back? Can what? My blood, I need it back. It doesn't work that way. We can't give it back to you.
I could have taken a reprieve but that wouldn't have been fair. It's not fair that other men have to fight and die when I'm home and safe. I have the energy and passion to serve as a doctor among other men. No less dangerous, it's just that while others are taking lives, I'm saving them. In a world that's tearing itself apart, it doesn't seem such a bad thing to want to reunite it.
Why a truck? It'll be our insurance in case Geran tries to kill us. Keep that in mind. Where are we gonna find your truck? We're gonna steal it.
Who's in charge of educating me? Welcome, stranger! I'm the one who asked for watered-down whiskey. You are, eh? Nick, serve Monsieur whisky as he wishes.
"an accountant", "our accountant", "the accountant". Accountant as in "chartered accountant"? Imagine yourself at the head of the Sinaloa cartel. Cartels count their money by weighing it in semi-trailers.
Difficulty with social interaction, communication, lack of eye contact. Lack of eye contact. Good luck with that. It's all nonsense. What's the point of stealing money if you're only going to give it back?
What is it? He owned a chain of electronics stores in New York in the '80s. Crazy Eddie... He started stealing right away. I'm not following. He deposited money in Tel Aviv, recycled it in Panama and reinjected it into his stores.
I don't follow. He deposited money in Tel Aviv, recycled it in Panama and reinjected it into his stores. Why put it back? First, to avoid paying taxes. But he had a better idea. By stealing his own money and putting it back into his accounts...
He donated to the Harbor Institute. Last year, about... One million one hundred dollars. Now that's not a cover. I checked it out. This guy would risk his life doing forensic accounting for the ugly people of this world, he launders the money he makes to give to the poor?
- Are you sure? Sure and certain. This may not be what you want to hear, but there's been no murder reported in a Macau casino. If there had been, we'd know about it.
Here. "Take this. - "Take this phone," Mr. L'Americain completely remains. Here, take it. "
(groaning) (Connor's voice): Bennie. Sorry I ran out on you. Don't take it personally. I'm leaving you this phone, I'm sure you'll find it useful. You just have to find a way to charge it.
Please help me! Please help me! This guy kidnapped me! He said he was going to use me to make a million dollars! - Sorry, folks. He's got brain damage. - I'm an arrogant, godlike American and you have a beautiful country, but I'm going to burn it to the ground!
It's better to go to prison than to be killed by psychopaths, you know. Besides, prison isn't that bad. We can smoke pot, get tattoos, maybe meet Morgan Freeman. - The phone. We've got to get it back.
I'm ready for the big jump. I'm ready to take the plunge. And I am Empress Josephine. - I'm ready to take the plunge. - Of course you are. But not yet to do it right.
It took me 500 years to get Oogway's chi. I'll take yours, even if it takes me another 500 years. Blah, blah, blah. Small talk. If you desperately want my chi, take it.
I want to see! No, Sam. No, wait. Sam, wait! You can see it!
Hey, you're not going to hurt me. I won't. Like that, but harder. Good. Now, at the end, you take my wrist and pull it towards you.
That's right. - How do you do? - Good evening, nice to meet you. This rum is exceptional. I wish we could sell it up north.
I wrote an article about a master glassblower, Jorgi. - Thank you for writing it. I don't know what to say. - You don't have to say anything. Just put it there, as a conversation piece.
Stay in my shadow. - Why should I do that? - Just do as I say. My respects, Great God Ra. Usually, when a bird lands on my boat, I kill it before it shits.
No! - Like this? For you, Mistress of the West? Yes. Grant him a passage so he can give it to her himself.
Bring them. Bring them here. Chisolm? Am I supposed to know that name? You'll read about it in your obituary.
Except what you didn't realize... Obviously, it's impossible to pull off this kind of coup on your own. You need partners. People who have a vested interest in protecting the loot while you hide out in Mexico City. Loomis Fargo may look like a big warehouse, but the money belongs to the banks. And if you take it, it's like robbing a bank.
Let's go back and clarify the situation. It's much more complicated than that. What do you mean, more complicated? Colonel, the Secretary of Defense is on the line. Let's not divulge this information until we've decoded it, so as not to inform our enemies.
You need to distract them for 20 seconds. - Do you trust me? - I trust you. Professor Banks, drop the phone or we'll shoot! - Drop the phone!
- Let him go! - I beg your pardon! This is an act of treason! - Yes, it is. - Let him go! Let him go!
It's very nice. It came off. Can we put it like that? Make a necklace? Let's give it a try. Can you put it on your head?
What was it like? The world? Yes. Fascinating. You should visit it.
That's what I thought. Check it out. I found this. My first hat. I thought it was long since destroyed.
A bad fall. You can't change the past. But I'd say we can learn from it. My first hat. I thought it was long gone.
If that's not a message, I don't know what is. - Do you like your steak? - Yes, ma'am, I do. Because you still have a long way to go? Yeah, you're gonna have to wait all day before I finish this. I'm gonna be here whether you finish it or not, so... take your time.
It goes to the boys. They do? I put it in trust. - What does that mean? - It means nobody can sell it.
Your grandmother died. I'm giving the ranch to you and your brother. Remember we used to go there when you were little? What do you want me to do with a ranch? Anything but sell it.
Target at 115 km, coming towards us. Lock the Hive. Aerobic antivirus. 48 hours to reach the Hive. Drop it now!
What? Fleet files, logbooks, including those of the Enterprise... He was watching our every move. Captain, the fragment was on board all this time? I couldn't keep it with me, so I hid it here.
It's a PX70! My father had one when he was young. He used to put my mother behind him, which pissed her off to no end. Captain. Would the ship have stayed here without anyone noticing?
I think our chances are better with you. The excavators have uncovered a tunnel that leads to the crater. I went out that way. Oh, that'll be our way in. A team will teleport to the end of the tunnel and follow it to Krall's HQ, get inside and free the crew.
Millions of lives. Thank you for this. I'm not the only one you have to thank. The position of vice-admiral is yours, of course. No one deserves it more than you.
My eyelids were swollen. I just stood there... I cried, I... didn't know what to do... But I knew I had to leave home. The world became immense. It took me a long time to carve it out for myself.
When are you coming home? Never mind, never mind. It's just a question. I haven't got time. Your meal is ready, heat it up.
I had to have a conversation with a stranger for 30 minutes. - Right. And show that I'm a good hostess. - And show that I'm a good hostess. Maybe next week they'll have weddings. I'm going to design a new crest for the Dandelions. It'll be huge, so everyone can see it.
What are you doing here? Looks like you and Michelle have built quite an empire. Well, what do you want? I want what Michelle Darnell built. I want her to know that I took it from her.
A pothole. You stamp things on purpose! You know me too well, you're always calling me to order. Do you see the van? Yeah, I see it.
As if we wanted to. Not a chance. Do it! Just do it. He's not gonna do it.
If it smells burnt, it's a bad sign. Three, two, one. Draw on your hidden strength. Don't let go. Can you feel it?
Then I'll be clean and give my body to the authorities. Take me. Handcuff me to the bed. Okay, baby. Baby, put that down. If you break it, I'll have to pay for it.
Because your menu is crap! - My menu isn't... - Yes, Ben. That's why my dream book is on Pinterest. - You can check it out.
You deserve better. Wallace, please... I'll keep telling you this until you leave. I can't. I wouldn't know what to say to Lilly. I wouldn't know what to say to Lilly, she's a good girl. She asked me for her rosary, I'll get it for her.
Come on! Give it to me! Listen, baby. This money is partly yours. Do you want it or not?
Two hands. Come on, grab it with both hands. You have to lift it... using your shoulders, then lower it, using your stomach. Come on, baby! You want your money? Earn it!
Come on, grab it with both hands. You have to lift it... using your shoulders, then lower it, using your stomach. Come on, baby! You want your money? Earn it! Well, you can keep it!
Actually, it's your roommate Beuter, the country boy. Are we clear? We're clear. It's Billy Autrey, his name. It was, until we changed it to the worst hillbilly name we could find.
We're worried about you, you know? Classes haven't even started, and correct me if I'm wrong, but you're the best candidate for the award for New Dork of the Year. - The what? - It's an annual award. It's given to the most ignorant freshman.
You have to listen. You have to listen. Don't be afraid to let experience find you. As Carl Sagan says: "The beauty of the living is not the atoms that make it up."
No, but it was the best of my choices that also offered me a scholarship. So you had to write essays, all that fun stuff? - Just the one. - What was the subject? We had to take a Greek myth and relate it to our lives.
Create a bomb from a wheelchair and then modify it to reduce the explosion? What does that mean? The inside of the chair was lined with lead. There was nothing you could have done. You couldn't see it.
I don't deserve you, Alfred. No sir, you don't. I'm afraid this is good-bye. And every time we say good-bye, you die a little bit. -Put him down!
- Yes, sir? I'll make sure no one gets hurt. Timing is everything. Finally, every target has a weak point to exploit. You just have to find it.
One moment, please. How are things? I turn off the engine when I leave. - Why do you do that? - So no one can wire it.
West Ham have never won since. I think what my half means is that, having gone a bit over the top as a youngster, he's got the experience to keep our kids out of bad company. Yes, I've known plenty. To be honest, we're both stressed. We want to be like everyone else. To give all our love to a baby who deserves it.
Yeah, okay. Yeah, fine. I give up. Put the gun down! I'm putting it down.
Yeah, okay. I give up. Put the gun down! I'm putting it down. I'm putting it down.
All we do is attack our own environment! It doesn't take a natural disaster to get our attention. There's nothing like pain to change behavior. Maybe pain can save us. There's a switch, if you flip it,
He's a scholar about Dante. The owner of the mask insisted we put up posts to keep people out. He won't even allow the team to open the crate without him being present. Doesn't the mask belong to the museum? A private collector brought it to us, and he allows us to show it indefinitely.
Let me explain. - Why did you do it? - It's no good. - Marta, I don't know where the mask is. But I'll do everything I can to find it and bring it back to you.
We don't know, we've lost track of him. Well, the situation's worse than you thought. There's only one reason for him to continue the operation without contact. He wants Mr Langdon for himself. Why does he want him? To find the virus and sell it to the highest bidder, I presume.
So that others can live. I've come this far to make sure there's nothing to stop it. The distribution system we've designed will release the viral agent at midnight tonight. But there are others on the way who will try to stop it. I need to find it before they do and set off the explosion to make sure it's released.
How can we help you? During the Justinian Plague, 5,000 people died every day in the streets of Istanbul. A border between East and West, another entrance. That's why they chose it. If the bag is intact, we can contain it.
During the Justinian Plague, 5,000 people died every day in the streets of Istanbul. A border between East and West, another entrance. That's why they chose it. If the bag is intact, we can contain it. But if someone breaks it before we get there, 95% of the Earth's population will be infected within 47 days.
She just had her baby. She had her baby? That's great news. That's great news. Could you tell someone that the lights on Dante's mask should be on because I can barely see him.
Could you tell someone that the lights on Dante's mask should be on because I can barely see it. I'm sorry, sir, the mask of Dante is no longer here. It's been stolen. Has it really? I was looking at it just a moment ago.
She said she was at the grocery store. She forgot her wallet at the store. With a lot of money in it. She was sure she wouldn't find it. That someone would take it, period.
Does she have to sit in the chair? I just... It makes me sick to see her there like that. It's hard, but the spirit seems attached to this place. Ed will be able to contact it more easily.
My old man was brave. He sacrificed himself. He drank a poison and then killed it. The demon had nowhere to go. I managed to trap him.
He knows how to influence things. - How did you lose him? - We don't kill him. We put him where no one will find him. I rented a plane and dropped him in the bayou.
Not my daughter. She's not your daughter anymore. I just don't understand it. We'd have the same problem with me, wouldn't we? We'll make some poison, you'll drink it, kill her and go back to your daughter.
Don't kill it. I've been doing this a long time. I don't know if there's a heaven or a hell. But I do know that evil exists. You can run from it, you can bury it, you can even slow it down, but you can't stop it.
That's what I did to finance all this. I took out quite a few in the '90s. And some of them paid off. That money would have been gone by now. Now I'm going to spend it on rock and roll.
Take what's mine Almost everything Xbox, jewels, aquarium, toys Poke me in the eye, pull out a gun Throw dirt on my reum Tease my dog, he won't find out Pretend to throw him his bone He'll be looking for it, that nullos
Yes, thank you. No more lugging my albums around. Let's play a record. Let's get it out. For God's sake. Let's get it out of the sleeve.
I could buy bank identifiers to buy online. Next stop, St. - I'm expecting a package. - I'm waiting for a package. I'll pick it up.
That's a promise. Peaceful life from now on. Back to the ministry. Editing my book. Can't wait to read it.
Oh, crap. - Just give me a minute. What the hell? - The drawer. We must not have closed it all the way.
It's not my style. You can always get rid of it. I'm not gonna pay some asshole to rip my guts out. There's always someone who wants a baby. Give it up for adoption.
What's the matter, Lou? You're not pregnant, Lou. You see this? What was it? There was a... a small unknown object. I could see it.
Like I said, it's a sport. There are rules. Even if you have rules, do you think God approves? I believe God gave me this gift. And I believe it would be a sin to waste it.
He is in a serious condition. We're taking him to the hospital. Looks like a concussion. Do you think God approves? God gave me this gift. And it would be a sin to waste it.
Bring him back to me. Can you do that? No. Here's the money from the fight. - You take it.
Are you out of your mind? What's the matter with you? Your bus leaves in 15 minutes. What time is the last bus? At 10pm. If you miss it, you'll miss your flight to Budapest.

Gifted?! ... It's far from being a gift, you know In the beginning it's never a gift The first step in understanding its power is to measure its extent Only then can you learn to control it.
- Now, give me your phone! - All right, calm down. I'll give you the phone. - Don't play with it first. - I'm unlocking it!
Baghdad. Basra. This isn't our first investigation, is it? Do you think I like being in this situation? I've got a job to do and I'm going to do it.
It's not working. Nasty curve on the halfpipe... Manny, I've got a plan! We've got to drop the crystal! Do you understand why we're trying to throw it into the volcano?
Everyone in town could become famous on the stage of my theater! Buster, that's a disastrous idea! No, it's not! Raw talent from ordinary citizens. That's what the public wants, and I'll give it to them!
Please tell us. Is the prize inside? The prize? Yes, it's all there. Why don't you open it?
- Mike? - Yes. Mike says you have his money, which would be in that safe. No, just a moment. That's the prize you have to win. Mike's not entitled to it unless he earns it with his talent...
Mike says you have his money, which would be in that safe. No, just a moment. That's the prize you have to win. Mike's not entitled to it unless he wins it with his talent... - The money! - I'll take it! Hey, hey, take it!
- Did Aryan send you? Aryan has nothing to do with this. Just do as you're told. Camera. If you want cash, take it.
- Thank you for your time. - And you'll have to be very quick. We have orders to shoot on sight. Mr. Muller I brought you your breakfast. I could smell it before I opened the door.
Mike, when you came home on the day of the murder, you went to your parents' bedroom. What was your father doing? I think he was unpacking. So he posed no immediate danger to you? He told me to be ready. On the plane, he told me that when I got home, he'd do it again before I went off to university.
His heart possessed an immense power, absolutely unique. It could create life itself. And Te Fiti shared this power with the whole world. But unfortunately, some people coveted Te Fiti's heart. They thought that if they possessed it, the great power of creation would be theirs.
The ocean chose you. I thought it was a dream. It wasn't! Our ancestors believed that Maui lives there, at the end of his hook. Follow him, and you'll find him.
I know, you don't meet your idol every day. You're not my idol. I didn't come for an autograph on a train set! I'm here because you stole Te Fiti's heart! I order you to get on board, cross the ocean and give it back!
Stay out of this or you'll be sleeping in my armpit. You, stop. It's not a heart, it's a calamity. As soon as I picked it up, someone hit me in midair, and I lost my hook. Take it away from me.
You want to talk about this? Not so loud! Come and get it! You'll be the death of us all! No, I'm taking us to Te Fiti, so you can give it back.
Whisper it to me. Let it out. No. No. Let it out.
No. No, no, no, no. Let it out. Whisper it. Whisper it in my ear!
Turning. - We're in. All right, is it rolling? Uh, yeah, I hear it. Well, when we bring in the new cameras, we'll be able to check it out right away.
That was 20 years ago. We're here to help. And I'm black. Russians are black now. If we fix the well, don't destroy it.
They would walk down the street with a wooden rod, a wooden dowel, which they would pass over the front of a man's pants. If his pubic hair was long enough to wrap around the rod, they would beat him. Now, I ask you, do I look like a man walking down the street with a rod to check pubic hair? No, sir, not at all. I came back to this country to save it.
- Put the cable in the snow blower. - Do what? Do it! Do it now! - Are you crazy? - Put it in.
No, Sam, please, don't... I'm sick of this crap. Enough, okay? Your little game of playing us against each other, to hurt each other, it's not going to happen. Okay, I won't.
It will be a standard tracking procedure, which means... I know what it is. Tonight, you'll receive a call at 11:07 p.m. Repeat the time. 23h07. Write down the message where your wife can read it.
I know what it is. Tonight, you'll receive a call at 11:07 p.m. Repeat the time. 23h07. Write down the message where your wife can read it. The information will be wrong, but she'll think it's important, and she'll pass it on.
Hampstead 235. Lieutenant-colonel Vatan. Do you have a pencil? Go ahead. Noted. I'll pass it on tomorrow.
I look at this mess every day. Some people left me there to rot. Sometimes I just want to find them and greet them with a flamethrower. Oh, we're on flamethrowers now. Yeah, they deserve it.
My boy, we have a problem with this eye: it's a lazy eye. Do you know what a lazy eye is? It's an eye that doesn't work, it's lazy. So, your brain doesn't receive images from the left eye, so we have to force it to use the left eye, and therefore, for a more or less short period of time, it has to use the right eye.
The director told me about Soriano. And the safe. He knew and brought us for it. I didn't know it was Soriano's. I had to take the safe and deliver it closed.
And what we see of her. Would you like to know? Your boss. - Let me see that. - Relax. I'll show it to you.
The hardest part of being a public defender is making a difference. And you have, every time. I feel a bit overwhelmed. No, you're not. The worst vice of all is advice. I just gave it to you.
- She buys drugs. - Arręte! Maybe she went home with a guy... too stoned to tell us. Maybe she lives here. We can't all live in nice neighborhoods. She's got my phone and I want it back.
- Why not? Because I'm banned from all conferences. I'm not even allowed to climb the stairs to my refuge. I bought the building myself. But no, because there are feminists... The women who run it are radical feminists.
She was a redhead. -I didn't notice, sorry. This number requires absolute concentration. We have here... a revolver. Examine it, you'll see it's normal.
And more. I advised him to leave the country. He didn't know what to do and took his own life... -Your token was in his pocket. -He was in such a state that I gave it to him.
Tribeca, can you hear me? - I'm in position. - Perfect. Where did you put the microphone? It's not important. Let's just say we'll probably have to throw it away when we're done.
- Just do it. Lyra! No! They have a child. Find him!
They call it the Death Star. There's no better name. And the day will soon come when it will be unleashed. I've placed a weak point deep in the system. A small, powerful flaw they'll never find.
They call it the Death Star. But they have no idea there's a way to destroy it. You're wrong about my father. - He built it well. - He knew they'd do it without him.
No, we can't risk your father's message. You're the messenger. How ridiculous is that? We all got the message. Everyone here knows it.
Yes, let's do it! Every day, "Anushka, coffee? No, Wahab." "Anushka, dinner? No, Wahab." And now I'm about to commit the first crime of my hacking career... "Hey Wahab, let's do it!"
The last one is my generation's fault. Take it from me. You don't want to live with this weight. We're going to start with an aptitude test. Each of you will build a secret communications network in your own city, deploy it, back it up and destroy it, then restore it.
By activating the camera and microphone. A British program. Activation? Her laptop is switched off. Or was, she forgot to close it.
- This is huge! You can act like you don't care, but I know you're for him. I've watched your liberal side grow. I'll take a modest percentage of the credit. And you deserve it.
"But I also got a lot of yeses." Well, we only need eight yeses to get the bill out of Judge Smith's committee. Very good. Very good. He promised to get it out of committee, and he kept his promise.
As a great man, a man who changed the course of his country, or as someone who just likes to listen to himself talk. Congress isn't the only one causing problems for the President. Mr. Johnson inherited an armed conflict in South Vietnam. President Johnson must decide whether to continue it, expand it or negotiate a settlement.
For the election, he's... 96% of the black vote for Johnson. They owe us, Martin. They have to give us the vote. L.B.J. won't give us anything. We'll have to take it.
It's not... We can't just... At his appointment at the Western Hotel. Vending machines. She was showing him to vending machines.
Distributors. She showed it to distributors. She showed them the film. The film exists. You just have to find it.
But little did I know that the most important race of my life was just around the corner. That's the one. Yes. I brought you some fish. Can I hold it?
- Flush. Stuck. Amazing. I'll show you how to make one if you want. You write a little note, and put it in with the boat, and put it in the water.
When are you going to learn to listen? There's no future in this tackle store. In a year's time, this island will be the number-one tourist destination in the area. I'm ready to make you a better offer. We're planning to build a souvenir store here, and I'm willing to let you run it for, say, 5% of the profits?
Rinse it off with cold water and put a compress on it. - Thank you so much. I didn't know what to do. I just didn't know what to do. - You'll know next time. There are two kinds of creatures in this world. Those who start a fight, and those who finish it.
What's this? You think I left my life to build a boat in a bottle with a drunk, broke, good-for-nothing uncle I've never met? - Will you listen to me for once? - No, you listen! I'll tell you what. All right, let's do it. Shall we write down a Chinese proverb and throw it in the ocean, or is that just your excuse to empty another bottle?
A real ninja. Guys! "Use the birthday decoder." The war decoder at your house. We need it. No, my dad would kill you if you even looked at it.
Here it is. Mark, read me that message, quick. "N-D-D-F-space-I." I've told you before, you can get rich off this island, and it starts with finding where the old man buried his treasure. That's my ticket in. Without it, I'll be sitting on the sidelines watching, so I suggest you go back outside and find it.
Sarman... May your strength grow a hundredfold! Bima! Why does it always have to be you? Isn't there anyone else in the village? Every time Amri has a problem, why are you supposed to solve it?
- What's his name? - Che-val! Che-val! An hour has gone by! Use this indigo to color your clothes or paint your walls... take it!
How do you know Barbara? We danced together in San Francisco. Did we? I hope you like the apartment. It's a bit gaudy, but Barbara wanted it that way.
Let's go ! Raph, do your thing. Oh, no, no, no, no. That hurts. Do it, do it, do it...
Is it really possible? It's confirmed, Master Shredder. The container of purple goo is at the police station. Assemble a team. Retrieve it, whatever the cost.
As if he were here. I'm here, right here, and I'm not going anywhere. You're hard to get rid of, that's for sure. I'm stubborn, like my husband. Let's talk about the future, and how we're going to change it.
Who are you? What kind of experience do you have? What about you? Listen. He went to court under a veil of presumption of innocence. He still has it and will keep it, as long as he doesn't say anything.
Fuck your father And fuck this song Hunter the Hungry beats the balls off everything. DANGER MOUSE PRODUCER We think he's faking insanity, but I've seen him backstage. RZA RAPPEUR He wasn't smoking the joint, he was eating it.
Feeling confident? Let's leave them to it and toast in the crew lounges. Would you like one? I need a drink. We'll put it on Fred's tab.
What part of "shut up" don't you understand? I'm a consultant at Davila Aérospatiale, - I conduct special research... - Industrial espionage? Call it what you like.
- Who said you could talk? - I said I could. Keep going That's not going to help either. You disconnect the magnetic lock, and the backup in that storage will kick in and keep it closed.
Wherever you are, you're closer than I thought. Stay close to us. Your mother loves you very much. She's waiting for you. We all are. I brought you a present. I thought we could read it together.
Yes. And so, if I'm not mistaken, it doesn't belong to you? You've understood who it belongs to. If you don't mind, I'm going to keep this hat. I'll deliver it personally.
Tell me what you're looking for. Tell me what you're looking for! - Just tell me. - My little horse. But I can't find it.
"You don't have mice, they're baby rats." They didn't believe us. I said, "I don't treat mice, you have rats." We had this wonderful rodenticide called thallium sulfate. We can't find it anymore.
Just shut up. All right, we got a lot of stuff to do. - What about the boat? - We'll go and see George and talk about it. There's no point keeping it
It's on hold for now. No, I can take care of all the general maintenance, but the engine's going to fail, and I'd say soon. Okay, I'll take care of it. There's no money set aside for a new engine. Do you know anyone who could take it over?
No, I can take care of it just fine for general maintenance, but the engine's going to give out, and I'd say soon. Okay, I'll take care of it. There's no money set aside for a new engine. Do you know anyone who could take it over? But wait, I have no intention of selling it.
Why don't you even have a winter coat? - Really, Patty? - Go ahead, turn on the heat. I did turn up the heat. Turn it up a little bit, come on.
It's not healthy to fixate on these things. I just had a thought about a thought. How do you hide your thoughts, and why do we have to hide everything? Manny, that's just another power your body has. You can learn to control it.
It's for painting. Would you like to try? Yes, please. Won't you sit down? We take this utensil... and dip it into the hot wax.
I've been out longer than you and? I'm still tripping. - What? What are you talking about? - Carpets. You know, if we went barefoot when we could in our cell or didn't wear sandals in the shower, without the guards noticing, all we smelled was cold cement covered in boogers and semen.
Tomorrow, I'm off again. A clean slate. I'd like to ask you a question and be honest with you, because I respect your opinion. Do you think people can change? I mean, if you've always behaved a certain way, can you change it?
And never left. Even if it won't last. What do you mean, it won't? Felix isn't going to stay and run the place no matter what Hermione says. He'll put it on the market the first chance he gets.
- An argument during naptime? This is the second time in 12 hours he's snuck out. See if there's any connection with the Malton Hall case. Of course, of course. Can I drop the toy off somewhere on my way to the lab? If you could leave it at the station reception desk, my wife will collect it later.
Find out if there's any connection with the Malton Hall case. Of course, of course. Can I drop the toy off somewhere on my way to the lab? If you could leave it at the front desk, my wife will pick it up later. That's fine. Just put it in there.
Hodor? He's got giant's blood. And you, training. Fair enough. Benjen raises his chin before attacking. And he lowers it before dodging.
I know everything. And yet... To tell you the truth, I never thought I'd find you. The anomalies of my creation never cease to amaze me. Jason, you'll stay by my side and help me purify this world. And bring it back to perfection.
All right, let's go! I want access to the city's surveillance cameras. Do a network search on that damn rail yard van. It's here somewhere. Find it.
Thanks for your concern, but I'll decide when it's time to change our tactics. No, I'll decide. This crew has spilled a lot of blood to make your name what it is. It doesn't belong to you. It's a jointly held asset belonging to every man on this crew who has sacrificed a part of himself to build it.
I needed someone I was sure would catch it. So you lied to me about it. What makes you think I'd give them to you knowing what you know about me? There were three of us standing in that room... You, Flint, and me... and we agreed that restoring the fort was paramount to Nassau's safety. We agreed that you would recruit men to restore it.
You gather men together to fight with the idea that these are times when all of Nassau must stand together. Either that means something or it means nothing. And how do you use that as an argument, just so you can avoid a delay? These days any man who can sew a black flag and get 10 idiots to follow it can take a loot. They can take it thanks to the fear that I and men like me have instilled in their prey.
Don't ask me to take sides between you and him. It doesn't matter. It can't be done. There's a reason he's up there in the first place. There's no other place to keep him safe.
"so that I may see what course I must follow. "Instead, in the state I am in, not knowing what I am "and what I must do, "I know neither my condition nor my duty. "My heart tends entirely to know where the true good is, "in order to follow it;
- I want my baby back. - "As long as we desire, we can do without being happy, "we expect to become so. "If happiness does not come, "hope is prolonged "and the charm of illusion lasts as long as the passion that causes it.
If the Unsullied leave to take back these cities, who will defend Meereen? - Will we win without a fight? - Impossible. The masters understand only one language. I know it well.
But never mind. - Are you ready? - Yes. Your face is a gift from God. Why change it?
That's how people talk. Not to my knowledge. - They don't talk like that. - Well, you're wrong. People know the historical significance of the word, you can't pronounce it so casually.
Shit. What's wrong with it? It won't open. This guy's not kidding. There's a bolt there, I can feel it.
And, in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, Lent ends today. When I was a child, my Nurse would never let me eat a single morsel presented to me. Something must always remain, for Mr Manières. I know now that Mr Manières is a myth, and that it's madness to appease him with delights of any kind. And now we take our right arm and raise it in the air.
When I was a child, my Nurse would never let me eat a single morsel presented in front of me. Something must always remain, for Mr Manières. I know now that Mr Manières is a myth, and that it's madness to appease him with delights of any kind. And now we take our right arm and raise it in the air. We move it backwards, form a circle, and repeat the movement four times.
Take a hot bath to relax - heat increases the effects of castor oil. He's not alone? Dr Turner is with him. Johnny's expecting the baby. I promise you he'll see it.
"If you cross the waters, I'll be with you." "If you walk through fire, you won't get burned." "You are precious to me." That baby's still breathing! We couldn't have saved him.
I'll get back to you tomorrow It's about presence and keeping calm And yes, he was busy, constantly telling the truth But I said to myself, "Fred, you're guiding this ship alone" "but you're making it sail for Vi, and we have to weather the storm."
When you're safe in the ambulance. The baby turns, Baisy, he knows exactly what to do. And so do you. It's perfect! It's perfect! Can I hold him?
But you're the midwife! I'm just here to do chores. Fred, that front tire is soft as butter! I told you last week, yesterday and now again! I keep inflating it.
The drug is called Distaval, and has been withdrawn from sale. So you want this back? Yes. Can I have one more? I'm done with the iron if you like.
Oh, for crying out loud! Son of a bitch! The great strategist who commands the Martyrs has left the rear gate open. Boon, this wall will be the new perimeter. Take cover and defend it.
You know that money's at Cottonmouth. Supposedly. Supposedly. What I don't understand is why someone would go through such hell out there, cause such chaos to leave the money there? To take it out of circulation.
"You do the window, brother." It wasn't a question. This place needs to reopen. I know it does. You gonna run it?
Bring out your Geoffrey Canada, no kidding. There's money to be made. Forget the money, Cornell. Forget the club. Sell it!
We were kidnapped, and now we're free. They're not going to wait for a receipt from a bunch of Ecuadorian rebels. - Who would I have given the money to? - Nobody. Because we told you to leave it under a bridge because you... didn't want to involve the police, otherwise they would have killed us.
I want my money and my dope. Tonight. Tonight. You're wrong, you got arrested. When the police came looking for you, I took the stuff. So they wouldn't find it.
- I'll take care of him. - I'll look for them. Go ahead. Be careful, Dad. You stole the money and you fled California, did you think I wouldn't find you? You took Key Flo's money and I want it back.
Stop everything and get on with it. WEBB, RICHARD ANALYST DAVID WEBB (SON) - Madam, I'm sending you the shell. - I'm receiving it.
When I go on stage, kill Kalloor and the girl. Copy that. But my point is that such success comes at a price. There's a tumor at the heart of Deep Dream. A heavy secret. And I must share it with you...
You'll need a dress and new shoes. Unless I don't go. Charlie, don't miss your prom. What's it to you? You won't be there to see it.
Neck. Charlie, listen to me, okay? I'm going to make you a promise... and you know I always keep my promises. If you say yes to Owen... and buy yourself a dress... and decide to go to that lame dance... I'll be there to see it.
She told me where to find you. And not only that. You got kicked out of your apartment? Did I? It was Daphne's apartment. It's, um... It's her father who wants it back.
Why don't you pull over, Bill? I've seen the new gestures, the Rêveries. They're beautiful. How far you've come is remarkable. That's one way to put it.
Geils, can you catch it? Yes, I can. It's so... Do you have it? My fingers are touching it,
Yes, I can. It's so... Do you have it? My fingers touch it, - but I have to push it away.
It's so... Do you have it? My fingers touch it, - but I have to push it away. - Don't push it away.

It won't help you. Richard, I don't know what to do. Maggie, don't worry. He won't hurt you. Just give it to me.
We will settle this here as God... Like God planned. Here in the desert. I said get back on the horse. You want my ultimate judgment, you'll have to deliver it yourself, as I intend.
If you want my final judgment, you'll have to deliver it yourself, as I intend to do. - I'm not your judge. - Yes, you are. You're the only one who knows me, as I know you! Do you think the world stops when you leave it behind?
Joshua when you go to war? Does he stop for Naomi when you abandon her... - And William? - Get on the horse. You can't see him, can you?
It would be wise to keep things separate. No detail left out. You're absolutely right. That would be the prudent thing to do. So if those bastards come in here, throw the money around, that thing up there and I'll take it and get the hell out of this shithole.
Was Otis selling unauthorized products? Well, the difference could be an aberration in the manufacturing process. I'll know for sure once I've tested the T.H.C. levels of these samples. When you say "test", how are you going to do that? Well, yes, we're going to burn it, in a controlled, ventilated environment.
Or when to call the coroner's office? - Anything like that? - Yeah. Okay, we need to know exactly when you got this call. - so we can trace it.
You should take a nap. NASA pilots who sleep for 40 minutes increase their reactivity by 54%. - Is that a fact? - Yes. You can take your fact and shove it up your...
Yes, okey-doke. We work in silence. That's not silence. We dug into Joe Harris's cell phone. Maybe he doesn't carry it all the time, but if he does, it doesn't look like he's gone any further than jail in the last two weeks.
- I'll make you a deal. I'll give all the money I got to the Boys and Girls Club - and you don't tell my mom. - I'll make you a deal. You give me all the money you've had, I'll give it to the Boys and Girls Club - and I won't tell your mother.
I understand "the opposite of me" as qualities of someone else I admire. Mm. Sounds interesting. I look forward to reading it someday.
Not "this thing". You don't realize what's happening to her. My fiancée. That thing inside her, it's a demon that's taken over her soul. We'll send it back to hell, but it could kill her.
You don't seem to realize what business you're in. You're not in hamburger. You're in real estate. You don't build an empire on a 1.4% share of a hamburger that costs 15 cents. You build it by owning the land on which that hamburger is made.
Wait, so the blood traces... were somehow put there by a bunch of racist cops? At the crime scene, in the Bronco and in Rockingham? Who else could it be? Take a step back. Isn't it odd that this glove should land in Rockingham at the same time that Detective Fuhrman just happens to find it?
What do we have to work with? Cersei is the king's mother She has his attention and trust; And the king has, more than once, spoken with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras. The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well that we would bicker amongst ourselves, rather than take it back.
I joined the troupe the next day, without a backward glance. You're very talented. My last tirade was crap. But to be honest, which I always try to be, the text is crap. Change it.
My last tirade was crap. But to be honest, which I always try to be, the text is crap. Change it. It would all be farts, and vulgar humor without you. How would you change it?
Now! Do it now! You're the fastest without the hammer. Hand it over! Hand it over!
To be the Lady of Winterfell. All I need to find is your face. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I wish I could take it back.
I wish I could take it back. I wish we'd never left. Well, I don't. If we hadn't gone up there, I'd never have seen it. You have to see it to believe it.
This is your plan? Insult him? - Just follow my lead. - All right, then. You wanted a rematch, we'll do it.
You have feelings for him. Words aren't enough, Amberle. You have to prove your commitment to the quest. I'll do whatever it takes. Prove it.
What's wrong? I've let you down, Father. I've let you down. And I don't know how. But this space between us, I can't stand it.
The world has let me down. I need you by my side now more than ever. But not on the throne. Not until my work is done. If you won't give me the throne, I'll just have to take it.
It smells like death. Look at all these engravings. This must be the place. The Druid's book showed a symbol. We need to locate it
She said it reminded her of where she came from. Have you ever seen the ocean? It's like the biggest bath you've ever seen. Blue and sparkling. I can stare at it for hours, wondering what's on the other side.
No, please... Come on, kid. You're doing good. For the brain. I place it through the nostril and press gently with this.
Welcome, dear individuals of our existence. How do you do? I want to hear from you. Tonight, we are gathered in the vibratory field of a potential in motion, founded on love. Love doesn't just happen, it has to be chosen.
And let her go. - Yeah! - Touche! Touche! Nice. How do you plan to get the fish on board to eat?
- But? - It's not about the port. Of course it is! The port is Marseille's greatest asset. If we don't develop it, we're dead.
The kitchen. - The wallpaper is oppressive. - It's great. We can always paint it. - We'll take it.
Of course there are floral crowns. Headband braids. We have extensions. We can make you a weave. You can pick up something outside and put it in your hair.
Did Kringle herself tell you she was going south with Dougherty? Not in person. She left a note. Do you mind if I look at it? I didn't think of it as a souvenir.
I've got a gun. That's a good reason. Please tell me where it is. Tell me where it is. Come on, kid! You're not even pointing it at me.
It's much worse than the mail story. What mail? No mail. No mail. No mail. But it's my sperm. How did you know I wanted it?
I'd like you to use your badge and gun to intimidate him into dropping the case. That's highly illegal. He won't do it. I don't care if he won't. You have 48 hours to do it, or I'll take your sperm, dump it in the East River.
Let me take a look at you. You have a beautiful front door. Mom, seriously, the fire? It's okay, it's okay. Things don't burn like they used to. I'll just put it out.
Weichselbraun fans. Not Weichselbrauniacs? Oh, that's a good one. I'll use it freely. Anyway, Weichselbraun's $40,000 oboe was stolen from his apartment and you need to find it.
Everyone knows to enter when the owner is present. That way, access to the safe is guaranteed, and you can send a message and knock his teeth out. Okay, why don't you... Of course, we could slit his throat, but then what would we do with all the blood? We'd leave it in his body, where the blood resides, because we're cops.
Brad Pitt, Se7en. Seriously, what's in the box? The worst thing in the world. Shut up, idiot. Who sent you a kitten and why do you hate it?
Gentlemen, I've just thought of a plan. Fake Pimento's death, and we'll go to the rendezvous ourselves. Good plan, Sarge! No, I wanted to say it first. I thought of it before you did.
Dude, I've been waiting for you. I don't think I can eat this. Nobody can, that's why they closed it. We're not eating in that restaurant. We're gonna tear it down.
But at your age, stories last five minutes, three with a child. But I'm not like you. Play along. Kill him, the bastard. Is it too hard to put him in the laundry basket?
It's against the rules. I could lose my license. I need it to be oily. I need it to lubricate the world. I need this dog to be covered in grease, so that when I eat it, the grease lubricates my throat.
Super sexy disco baby. Super sexy disco baby. My girl's here. Nick Lock shot the Rasta in the back of the neck and the Rasta flew through the walls, dying instantly. Nick turned the gun in his fingers and pointed it into the future until Rasta came back to life.
They'll fight to the bitter end. There are only a hundred men surrounded by women and children. - Is the chest over there? - a coast. Bury it. Whoever knows where to find it is in the camp and can't run.
I've depended too long on Flint to rally the men. We need an alternative. "The night I confiscated the list of graces, "I began to exist. "I explained that there would be two categories of men from now on. "Those like Vane, faithful to the end to their oath "and those like Throckmorton, "delighted to be the first to break it.
We have an audit. I can't have 10,000 fake Donny Osmond returns! That's more than the real print run! You shouldn't have done an illegal print run. I paid for this print run, I can't sell it.
The view. Still no signal? Remember that guy Ryan? The one I made a short film with that ended up at Sundance? He sent me the script for the movie he's working on. He wanted me to show it to the producer of the film I shot in June.
I was sick of it anyway. Of course you were. Screw 'em. You have a problem, Lip. You need to grow up and deal with it.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - That's too bad. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's bad timing, because I just signed a one-year lease on a nice apartment, and I turned down a part in a movie with Liam Neeson, which happened to fall at the same time as Witchita. Crap. I'll get it back.
Third floor. The elevator is broken, which is good for your health. AGENCE INTERNATIONALE DE MAINTIEN DE L'ORDRE The chicken will be fine, darling. It doesn't matter if the date's a bit past, as long as you cook it right.
Now would be the time. Or shut up forever. You're too perfect, Jonathan Pine, that's your flaw. Doesn't suit me. Take a cookie, eat it.
That's how it started. OK. The first 2 years with Béatrice are like a romance and adventure novel. A fast-paced novel. Shall we keep it?
Excuse me, I found this in your daughter's room. Do you know where it's from? Lulu has lots of toys and stuffed animals. No idea. Do you think maybe your husband gave it to her?
Likewise. Those pictures... why did you hang them in your house? The pain. That black cloud that follows you. You can let it in.
So... why don't you sit down? We've got a lot to talk about. I'm not going to mince my words. A void has been created here today. We all feel it.
All those years spent abroad, in extreme conditions, certainly took their toll on him psychologically. Can you be more specific? I'm talking about his mental health... which is a matter of professional secrecy. But you have to understand, if there's a hell on earth, Damien will be at the center of it, photographing it.
We thought it was time for a change. Things have changed. So he's ready. Well, not exactly. You know he has to accept his role, embrace it.
Let's take it to the fields. Sir, what do we do with her? She's not family... Child, that thing was worth 10 million. If you were going to throw it away, why did you steal it?
But my father dropped dead. When I realized... I replaced my field hockey stick with a sickle. I left home, went to the village of Sarhota and worked on the farm. One day, a package fell from the sky. I thought that if I could sell it, I'd finally have a good time.
Well, well, well. Well, look at that. Looks like your daughter found your vibrator. Stella. She always does.
Are you trying to screw us? What the hell are you talking about? I asked you months ago if you understood what being in receivership meant, and you said 'yes'. You should tell us once more. You should tell us once.
Look at this pizza, how old is it? The cheese is moldy. SHELBY: The cheese is rotten. I can eat it, whenever I want.
Anatole has left Moscow. It makes no difference. When you see Countess Rostova, tell her that she was and is completely free, and that I wish her no harm. Is that all? Look, I'm sure it was just a moment of madness, and that she bitterly regrets it.
He enjoyed the good parts and endured the bad with gaiety. And his little dog. How much he loved her. "She knows how to ask for love," he said, "and she knows how to give it. "
This way, you'll stay together. You're a divine messenger, my boy. Thanks to you, Luz and I won't be separated. This workshop is mine. I give it to you.
Don't compromise your future, Alejandro! Butterflies don't have to turn into flies, and poets don't have to turn into teachers. I'm a teacher, and I don't turn into a fly. The world is what it is. You can't change it.
Butterflies don't have to turn into flies, and poets don't have to turn into teachers. I'm a teacher, and I don't turn into a fly. The world is what it is. You can't change it. If I don't change the world, I can start changing it!
This guy knows his stuff. Mason said he was a little sick. Does your son know the name of his medication? Clonazepam. He knows it.
I'm talking about the trophy. The Prometheus Science Trophy. Given at Hudson University to the most brilliant Science and Engineering student. This? Shouldn't you have won it?
Because being brave is really hard. You know what gives me courage, Mason? My badge. It does? I'm going to give it to you, and it's going to make you brave.
Two minutes to site annihilation. - What's all this? - Feld's paranoid. He's rigged the place with a self-destruct system. Erica must have triggered it.
By the way, she was joking. I know you're a little young, but... cops are quick with a joke. It... helps relieve the stress of the job. I'm not a kid. My job doesn't stress me out. Come on, I can see it.
How about that? I analyzed the info on Jason's computer, although it's encrypted, recovered some algorithms and it turns out they're for gaming software. If Jason was developing gaming software, it might have been of interest - Lisa Hexler. - Lisa Hexler. And if he was developing it at work, then the people at Sistex must have something to tell us.
- before killing him? - That's up to you. - Just give me the money and... - Wait a minute, wait a minute. How do I know you won't take my money before you disappear? I guarantee, if you don't give it to me, you won't.
You're the one with the memory. I said this memory is mine... This gift, this curse, whatever it is... Has made it impossible for me to do this job and keep my sanity. I said I couldn't do it, and you said...
This is no time to be hypo. What do we say about the plane? Mechanical failure. But the conspiracy theorists are getting busy. There's talk of hacking. Our finest act, and we're not claiming it.
Be careful. I'm sorry, señor. Yes, that's all right. - Your coat. - Leave it on. - Are you sure?
Previously on "Better Call Saul ..." We'd like to work on your case. Chuck wouldn't want us to.
Do you understand? He's... he's... he's my word, he's my judgment. Yeah. You and I both know you can do this job. But please, just do it right.
Just the two of you? No one else? Not necessary. We can handle our own affairs. It takes time. Get the money, count it, play detective.
Single-shot, bolt-action rifle. Simple, effective, reliable. .50-caliber bullet. Very effective against people behind light protection such as a car or a small tree trunk. As always, I've taken the trouble to file off the serial number. Unless you really scrape it off, the acid can pick it up.
What if it wasn't hers? It doesn't really mean for my client to say, now, does it? He's not a forensics expert. Who knows? Maybe, uh, it fell off the beak of a passing bird, and Mr. Salamanca caught it and tried to throw it away.
Let's get these letters back to the tavern before anyone notices they're missing. Is that King James' signature at the bottom? I recognize his handwriting now. Everything else is in code. The seal was unsealed at least three times before I broke it myself.
I recognize his handwriting now. Everything else is in code. The seal was unsealed at least three times before I broke it myself. We're not the only ones interested in Stuart mail. Can you decode it?
Of anyone who walks through his door. Whatever, you little rascal. This is unbelievable. What have you done? There's a nerve here, and if you're lucky enough to pierce it directly, the lower extremities are rendered painless.
Uh, little problem. We're gonna need another rug - 'cause I fucked it up. DEE: What? Oh, come on, man! - All you had to do was put it on the barbed wire
What, what did you... Oh, shit, great news, guys. Great news. No problem with the check. We just have to meet with his financial advisor and he'll sign it over to us.
I think it's a good idea. We shouldn't die keeping certain things to ourselves. You go first, Dee. Mac owns a Cowboys jersey. I've seen him wearing it in the office.
I'm fine. Thank you. [Chuckles] You should talk to my doctor, find out if I really need a CAT scan. To Vlasceanu? I'll do it.
50 50 But wasn't Uncle Emil a size 56? And who's going to wear it? For me, it was symbolic. But it must be worn by the recipient.
One coming, one going. Lary? Sebi's gone. What do we do with the suit? Do you want me to put it on?
- Would you like me to... - Thank you for your time. The crew trusts the captain and me to watch over and protect the gold for everyone's sake, don't they? So, as your quartermaster and as a friend, I suggest you reconsider such an important withdrawal without a plan to keep it once withdrawn, no?
I only came back because I knew this island. I came back because on this island I was sure I could find the men I needed, and one in particular, whom I thought deserved to stand by me in the face of this terrible fleet. I wonder if he's still here. Listen to me carefully. I'm dedicated to defending this gold, the fort, this place, preserving it for all eternity.
That's what I thought it was all along. Don't you know? - An invasion? - A fleet. 8 ships, 700 soldiers, led by a man who claims to have been appointed governor of this place and to have the power to take it back by force if necessary.
And for that, what's he offering you? Loyalty? That's how a dog survives. Not a man. I don't seek your partnership because I'm too weak to defend myself I don't seek it to protect my property or to increase my profit
Pass the word to the commodore. The resistance in the fort has been defeated. The fort was already cracked, so it only had a small chance of holding out. And the gold? As far as I can tell, it's the effect of the explosion and our efforts to find it?
Then I'll approach the queen and make it clear that either the entire crew is released with a guide to take us back to the beach, or the queen dies shortly after the king. Even if you could get close to her without being killed, even if you could put that knife to her throat and convince them to let us go, you wouldn't make it out alive. You said you lived here. For a short time, when I was very young. Before my father moved us inland and the opium dealers claimed it for themselves.
I found myself faced with two choices... report what I've heard, that you're thinking of keeping this money and know that Nassau will burn for it and me along with it... or open that door and warn you of the dangers you face if you don't return all the hidden gold with the fort's gold. I can hardly imagine what would induce you to tell such a lie. Let's assume for the moment that you're telling the truth. I'll see the money safe and return it with the rest of the gold in a few hours.
What step? We have to change our names. Eventually, money will protect itself It will hire guards, it will make us friends, it will protect itself with investments and partners, but as long as it is in its current form, it is as vulnerable as a newborn To protect it, given the attention our names give it, we will need to resort to the law.
But if we can't find Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny, if we can't find the treasure in their possession, whatever happens in Nassau, you and I are probably finished. Pardon me, gentlemen, may I ask where this wagon is going? To the fort. To do what, exactly? To repair it.
I honestly don't give a shit what you do or don't do. It's not your decision. It's hers. I've come to take back our pledge, the one we swore our lives to. If you stand up and acknowledge it, this fleet will follow.
English won't do. Don't do that. I haven't. One of two outcomes will have consequences. Rogers will realize that his defeat was inevitable and he'll leave this place, in which case I'll get him back.
I'm worried... maybe we've made a terrible mistake. I see what you see in them... Silver and Flint. But their relationship is so volatile and we've entrusted our lives to them. These men will stand up for their conditions because they are peerless when it comes to shaping the world to their will, in creating a narrative and wielding it to coerce the hearts and minds of men.
If you want them to fear you, you shouldn't be the one to give them the message. You're back from the dead. And no ghost story I know of starts with the ghost introducing himself. What I'm saying is that going out there and insisting on fearing yourself is likely to do more harm than good. I get the message, but I think someone else needs to deliver it.
Find out which way they went! I've known him since we were children... I've suffered illness and loss at his side. I've seen him offer his loyalty, his sacrifice and his love to my mother, to me. So you can only imagine how it feels, asking him to accept what was done to him at the hands of men who looked so much like the men he saw kill his parents when he was a child. You can imagine how tempted I was to take that knife and put it in his hand and let him use it as he saw fit.
"and that my execution will take place "privately and with mercy." Tomorrow at noon, you will be taken into the bay. The Shark will take you to London, where the Admiralty Court will try you. Accept this plea and the Governor will support it. We'll try to enforce it. Your passage to London will be short and dignified. Refuse to sign it, and it will be just the opposite.
The pain was racing his heart rate according to the questions. The machine was getting confused and this skewed the results. Did it work? I never got my hands on him again. He said he'd confess if I let him go.
Why not? The department doesn't allow personal calls. Next thing you know, we'll be paying for our own electricity. Aunt Tess has a flat tire. Do you mind if I help her change it?
I've decided I might want you to live. That's good, because the doctor said a blow to the head isn't fatal. Besides, I have a favor to ask. You're pushing too hard. I need you to take an empty van, and park it in the parking space next to my storage unit.
I don't know. False floor. Wozniak didn't say anything about this hiding place? Did he send you for an empty van? Maybe they're planning to fill it.
Drug dealer Raul Mendez owns this place. We went far away on an extended vacation. [Thuds, Wozniak exhales sharply] Straight ahead, inside the door on the left side there's a button. Just push it.
Beautiful day. You Wozniak? Where's Linklater? Do you have his money? No... and if I did, I wouldn't give it to Mr. Mom.
Do you have his money? No... and if I did, I wouldn't give it to Mr. Mom. You won't have to. A foreign bank account number. Clean the money and deposit it.
You will not need. A foreign bank account number. Clean the money and deposit it. There's just no way. If he wants it, he'll have to come and do it face-to-face.
All 12 million of them. A security camera picked up our accident and they tracked down the guy who hit us... it wasn't Donnie. Who did? Who... Who do they think did it? Stahl didn't give any details, but he gave me the money ... and he told me to put it back in play.
326 Bradley. I pay a C.I. to sit. [laughing] You were never very good at the next orders. I'm supposed to tell you that I tracked down the money and convinced you to set up a meeting with Linklater and Donnie to split it.
[I was thinking about that. Then I was thinking about the message I'm passing on to my daughter. How is she ever going to take responsibility for her mistakes if I don't? Look, I'll text you an address for the money. You can pick it up and stop me there.
I liked being here because I felt safe. But that's because I liked living in sorrow. I don't want to be here anymore. It's harder to kill you when we're in the same room. It's easier to rip your heart out of your chest and eat it when you're just a monster in spirit.
Age. 23rd August 2026. It will be 100 years since this hotel was built. On that day, it will earn its rightful distinction as a historic site. They couldn't tear it down even if they wanted to.
I am the queen of every hive. I am the fire on every hill. I am the armor of every man. I am the spear of battle. I am both the tree and the lightning that strikes it.
- We're not having sex. No, darling, we won't. - But I want to. - Justine, turn off the music. - But I want to.
Stop it! Stop it! What are you doing here anyway? First time in your life you've been up this early on a Sunday. I've got a job. I thought you might want to do it with me.
A million dollars. He told Howard that if he found the crate, he'd split it with him. Let me guess the end of the story. He told Howard where the money was. And nobody else knows.
And if we plant it, it will grow, and it can be used to level the playing field between the haves and have-nots. The have-not will keep his money. Period. You know, change is scary. Some people can't handle it and go back to hiding in their cocoons.
What about you? Except that Mario 2 didn't invent the POW block. It was in Mario 1, but you couldn't... Pick it up. You couldn't pick it up.
If you could live in one of these houses, which would it be? It wouldn't be Beverly Hills. Why wouldn't it be? I love living on the coast. My apartment is near the ocean, and I often look out over it.
At the end of July, Ben was executed in Sing Sing. A convert to Christianity, he wished to be cremated. Ben wanted his ashes scattered in Manhattan. Bobby scattered them in front of an establishment where Ben had spent many happy evenings. Bobby's friends, Rad Taylor and her husband, came to his aid to buy the club and run it.
Can you feel it when I touch you there? It feels weird. Your hand is functional. However, I have a problem with the radial nerve. The bullet didn't really enter the path of the radial, but edema can compress it, and it's very edematous above the elbow.
Jennifer, give me the virus. This is what you were made for. Your whole life has been leading up to this moment. The Witness has spoken. You may release him, Mr. Cole.
Jennifer, you don't have to do this. You don't need anyone to stop you. You've got a choice. This isn't fate. Spoken by a man who's capable of defying it.
No. I'm going to thank him. Thank him. That little jewel of a family he dropped was something very personal and private that I entrusted to him. But once he did, I realized I didn't have to keep it private anymore.
We own this album. Right, babe? - Right. - Actually, they can, little brother. You see, there were never any stipulations to which label would release it.
Right, babe? - Yeah, they can. - Actually, they can, little brother. You see, there were never any stipulations to what label would set him free. Try it and I've had you tied up in court for years.
- Yeah, they can. - Actually, they can, little brother. You see, there were never any stipulations to what label would set him free. Try it and I've had you tied up in court for years. Try it and we RUN online. (laughter)
You know who I'm talking about. He was your Uncle Bunkie. You see, that's how much the empire means to me. And if you think you're going to be the CEO of my company, I'll do anything to take it back.
OK. OK. Damn it. Damn it. Okay, come on. Stick it in.
He ran after them like, you know, I run through cheese. Do you have a photo album of your family? - Uh, not on me. - Mm-hm. Well, who'd want to carry it?
Wait, uh, wait. Do we have the money? We... No, I don't have the money. - Oh. - I'll have to get it from somewhere else.
Where's your sample bag? - Oh, I, um...? - I think you left it in the cabin. Okay, let... Sorry, let me get it.
Are you nuts? I don't know, maybe. Maybe I am. But take this! And that, ladies and germs, is the best thing that could happen to you. And if Veronica Deane doesn't bring her wrinkled old ass back with the Tsarina, we're gonna have to go get it.
You can't use this forum to make allegations... - Please type the following address in your browsers: 216. 449. Download a file named Earthquake. - I can't support the project with one hand and drown it with the other.
- Quiet, please. Is everyone here? Here we go. Periodic table. Close your eyes and visualize.
One of the most beautiful, kind and intelligent women in the world. One day, while walking in the woods, she was attacked by a monster. It was nature's mistake and wanted to eat her. The woman was very brave, but the monster was huge and ferocious. She couldn't kill it.
She couldn't kill him. Her sword and spear were broken. The monster was about to devour her, then a young girl arrived. She was like Achilles, invulnerable except in a secret place. She killed the monster and beheaded him.
Lucas Hood. You're under arrest for the murder of Rebecca Bowman. Brock, is this a joke? I'm sorry, but we have a warrant. - You know I'm innocent.
Leave us alone. - Are you out of your mind? - You took my money? You stole that money from my strip club. It didn't belong to you. You didn't give me the money, but I deserved it.
I want my dog. I said. I didn't want to be here if they wouldn't let me have my dog. Sir, go to your room. The dogs have been sent to the shelter. I'm sure you can find him there.
Sounds like a good investigation plan. But the first thing to do... is get out of this motel. Once upon a time, a village was plagued by a man-eating dragon lizard. The local police did everything they could to try and kill this creature, but nothing could stop it. So he visited a gypsy, who told him that the only way to kill this monster was to stab it in its appendage with a spear made of green glass.
How would I pay my bills? Without a job, I would never have gotten a loan or a mortgage of any kind. I was already terrified I wasn't saving enough for retirement. What else could I do? If I didn't write my novel now, I was never going to do it, you know?
The alien DNA must encode something that targets the CAS-9 protein. It must somehow deactivate the weapon. But we should have seen it in the gel. Why didn't we? They must have discovered that someone was... tried to find it.
So, Josh, what do you do? Astronaut, huh? You wanted to see me, Mr. Pell? Our administrative manager, Vanessa, is leaving to take care of her children. - Her position's yours if you want it.
Her fantasy of a perfect life. Which grows as time goes by. How do we get her out of it? Kara has to reject this fantasy. If she doesn't know it's false, how can she reject it?
The other day, you forgot a piece of paper. Oh, I see. My mechanical bird, indeed. I'll just... Would you like to see it?
Thanks for your time. When do we interview the pool girls? She left dirty dishes. Cell phone. Impossible to trace.
Poquito Mas. L.A.'s best Mexican takeout. I got you a new phone. Thanks, Dad. Why don't you turn it on?
Ride this thing! What's that? A microphone, I think. Crap. Can you destroy it?
Do you have any idea of the extraordinary opportunity we've been given? A chance to be killed by an immortal psychopath. Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine. Look, I'm a 20-year-old mechanic. The world is better off without me trying to save it.
Did you get the photo? Yes. Looks like a symbol. The surface isn't flat, so it's impossible to be sure. Can you extract it and compare it to the local folk symbols?
- Oh, crap. - It's okay, it's okay. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh, no. I had to do it.
Ok. I need a stapler. You stay. So this is it. All right, Nick, I'll sign it.
I won't abandon you. I told you to go. Please, just go. If you... care about someone, there's a price to pay, Morgan, and you'll pay it.
- Seriously, leave him alone! - Admit it. Admit it! - Fresh blood. I knew it. I knew it.
If the vote takes place today, you'll lose. It's Jack. It's not that they don't want to vote for you, it's that they can't, because of the pressure they're under. We're going to postpone the vote, hold hearings, and get those votes back. The only way to get approval to postpone the vote would be to ask for it yourself.
This is sexual harassment. And I hope we'll stay the course on this particular issue. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. We've just learned that Professor Hill submitted to a lie detector test, and according to the expert who administered it, she passed.
Firmly. Immediately. Yes, when the time is right. But for now... remember that emergency plan we talked about? Now's the time to put it in place.
I wanted to tell you before they did. I asked to stay on XHP with you. Thanks for the consolation prize. I know you did. You deserved it.
So what do you propose? We need something tangible, a message of change to send to these people, or we'll stay... Or what? Or what? I'll tell you what. You'll get your message, but if you can't sell it, we'll shoot the messenger.
Tell you what, I'll make myself a medallion. What do you think? So I came early. What's that awful smell? Lunch! It's called "mutton filant". Because we don't keep it long.
We can preserve it for a few more years, by imposing a few... "confused reforms" as you put it. Don't take it literally, sir. So, do you support this law? Of course I support it. But I wonder... sometimes you're only faced with a choice if you've had the will to see it.
Didn't she already promise us a first chapter? Yes, she did. - What about it? - And? When can I read it?

- Well... Kelsey goes over it with a fine-tooth comb. - You know how dedicated she is. - Yes, she is. I'd like to read it tomorrow.
Hold on a second. Let me see that. All we need is one chapter, right? Yeah. - Well, you're looking at it.
Absolutely. You're in my squad, girl. - What's that for? - I need his twisted mind. Take it.
Hashtag "good luck". Your waiting room is full of out-of-touch 40-somethings who only understand your book conceptually. We're living our decade of decisions right now. We care about your book. And we can sell it.
It was my ex. We just broke up. Another good thing about farm life... you never run into your exes again. Okay, baby. Time to open the kimono. Let's get it on.
Strawberry-rhubarb. You're mine. Well... I've installed an accounting software, free trial for a month. The good news is that I can renew it with a false e-mail address.
You don't have to be shy. I'd really like to get to know you. You would? That's something I've learned from our relationship. When you feel a knot... you take a deep breath and look at it and face it without fear or judgment.
Hi, Tommy. You didn't see Grandpa drop that piece of bread. I'm glad. I'll give it to Joey.
They were getting cranky. My friend and I were admiring your tattoo. I'd love to know the story behind it. I like your hat. Maybe I'll keep it.
At that moment, the dog spotted a cat. It must have looked like a piece of felt. He started running. I'd never seen anything more beautiful than this old dog running. Eventually, he caught up.
It's a common misconception that hosts don't record sexual acts when reprogrammed. But it's wrong. I need a favor. We sent a body here, the lumberjack from Sector 14. I'd like to see it.
I don't think so. We could play catch with Jock. Did you bring him? Where is it? Where is it? If I'm a genius and I hide a relay, where do I hide it?
I don't think so. This morning, Cynthia woke up to quite a shock. A local hero raised the Indian flag in the middle of Cynthia's lawn. Aren't you going to take it down? No, I want to see it, so everyone knows what we're up against.
That's the one. Is that your dream, to be a private teacher all your life? I'd like a more creative job. In fact... I've written an episode of Witchita, which has been sitting in a drawer, and I'm hoping that one day I'll be able to give it to someone on the show and...
Is Jeff here? He knows his way around. Two egg and bacon sandwiches. And two more. Remove the bacon from two of the sandwiches, replace it with sausage.
I called Dr. Bruce, he's on his way. Just relax. Last night it got worse. I'm afraid it's going to get worse. I want to take it out of the final. According to the rules, you have to report it to the medical team.
I can kick his ass. I already chopped his balls off. You're not gonna get that ass, Lonnie. If you bit your wife's ass, you'd have a happy marriage. Bite it, lick it, whatever.
Have a look. Free soap. No, don't take that. It's good soap. Take it.
You take it very gently. Unroll it to expose the glans. - Okay. - You continue gently. You've got to... Excuse me, love. Then you go all the way in like it's... You masturbate him until you sit on him.
Drink more! Drink, drink! Is it me who drinks again? You said the word trap. That's where you say it.
You said that at recess to call in a favor. We're not there anymore, Alison. Not for a long time. Please? I'm not one of those candidates who comes along and says he hates the government and wants to dissolve it.
Ezra? What's up? Were you working on the last chapter? It's finished. Want me to read it?
You're describing time travel as seen through the eyes of popular culture. I'm talking about science. You're talking about reality. That's what I'm talking about. Ari, did you have a question? If time travel existed, we'd know about it, someone would have come back and told us.
And I'm leaving my cell phone here because my mom is tracking me. As if she couldn't trust me! I had a brilliant idea. I tied the cell phone to the dog's collar so your mom would think you were moving around. You could also hold it while moving.
We've got a winner! If for any reason the winner can't fulfill his or her dog obligations, one of you... will be contacted again. I said "dog obligations"! My aunt found an abandoned pet. Can you take it in?
You were kissing! We weren't. Your mother had a piece of popcorn stuck behind her molar and I was trying to get it out with my tongue. Just tell me the truth. The truth is that your father's lung failed and I was trying to re-inflate it.
I'm guessing that whatever it is, you can't get it unless you've been exposed to tainted blood. The ME had the most intense and prolonged exposure, which may explain why he succumbed first. At your convenience, I'll need a written report stating exactly what Detective Henry told you. I'll get it to you right away.
That's tough. An octopus arrived today. A weird octopus. An octopus? It could kill you, so don't touch it.
An octopus arrived today. A weird octopus. An octopus? It could kill you, so don't touch it. It makes me want to touch it when you say that.
His partner retired to Puerto Rico in 2006. The only personal number we have is out of service. I think I know someone who can help us. I'll have to make a few calls. If you have any movement, please do.
I mean it. We won. You were supposed to make the last point. If I had an opening. You were supposed to.
Someone did something to me. Mommy, mommy... Wait, wait, wait. Go back. When you make that first move, let it come, okay?
Years ago. My friendship with August Corbin was strained, but there was always mutual respect. Here it is. The Poetic Edda. If there's a clue to the myth of Ragnarok, you'll find it here.
There was an old friend there, who came to tell me my work is done. And this place... where are we? It's a waiting room between life and death. I've been called. No, we started this journey together, we'll finish it together.
Look, if the U.S. Attorney is really coming, maybe it's better that we don't make you more than one target. And more importantly, lighthouse Garth Sykes. Hated to see you on the cover of the post with that fucking seaside abode. Teachers in this pension fund make 40 grand a year. People who have it spend it.
Hey, I'll make sure of it. No, if we're stuck again. We have to find a way to get Pete Decker on the hook, right? Decker hires young, and he pays at the top of the range. Now, once these guys get a taste for that kind of money, they're desperate to maintain it.
-Yeah. -He must have gotten rid of it when we were chasing him. -Maybe it's under the snow somewhere. -Yeah, you're right. We've got to try and find him.
You know him, don't you? -I reread the police report on the fire. This is the report that was given to the insurance company? -Yes, it was. May I see it?
Steve Aoki will have a huge impact on what happened. Even if Steve Aoki didn't make dance music explode, he served as a springboard. When it comes to passion and people, go-getters, battlers, whatever you want to call them, Steve is one of them. There's a wall in front of him, he goes around it, over it, under it, through it.
And I release my album a week before. I can't believe it. STEVE'S STUDIO LOS ANGELES I'm on tour all the time. The hardest thing is finding the time to finish my album. And when you say it, imagine...
Oh, dear. We seem to be having a problem with facial recognition. startup INTERRUPTED. Another bug. Let's add it to the long list.
[DARK MUSIC] â™ª â™ª So you know I have a record, but.... Yes, we have that information. It's not a problem. The job's yours if you want it.
What is it? The screen. It's still down. If it stays like this all night, it'll warp. Are you asking me to put it back up?
Your balls are about to explode, my friend! You should at least jerk off. I can lend you some magazines. You need to grab the bull by the horns! But you're not strong enough to ride it.
They're leaving us the creative side without cutting any jobs. It was a good exchange. - The guys from Beijing are here. - Nobody wants Chinese coffee. - But we have to sell it.
- For your information, it's free. So you can give it to me. I really like you. Mommy says you spoil that word. Not when I say it.
At 16, 17. What are you doing, crazy? It's weird in here. I brought you a mobile router. Plug it into your laptop, and bim, it's connected and paid for.
I have to cross a border that's hard to define. Perhaps you know what I'm talking about? Or not, but you feel it. You've known other boundaries: youth or adulthood. I can help you fulfill your destiny, but not change it.
I'm sorry for the violence out there. But you must know I can't let you go. I just can't. Khatun had forced a mystery down my throat. I didn't understand it, but I felt it inside me.
Elbow. We raced against our captor. Overhead, Hap was learning every move. What would happen if we got the fifth move? Would we be able to hide it from Hap long enough to escape?
To me, you're all my collaborators, but you, above all, are my partner. Don't do that. I know we're worried about the same thing. Are we going to discover the fifth movement? One of us will get it.
They sing. That's where you were. I don't think Khatun will give us the fifth movement. I don't think she wants him to have it. We'll get it.
That's where you were. I don't think Khatun will give us the fifth move. I don't think she wants him to have it. We'll get it. We'll get it.
What if, I don't know, we change? No, we won't. We won't become like that. We can't. People who want power try to control those who have it.
I went to New York, but my father wasn't there. I made a mistake. Now I have a new dream. I don't understand it, I don't understand the meaning and I don't know what to do. This time, just accept it, maybe.
I made a mistake. Now I'm having another dream. I don't understand it, I don't understand its meaning and I don't know what to do. This time, just accept it, maybe. Whatever happens, accept it.
I mean, why are we still trying to figure it out? The future is bleak. Not in a bad way. It's dark. We just can't see it.
I've kept it inside me while waiting for you. Want to know what it is? Come closer. The end is near... but I can hold Stan close to me one last time. Will you give your lives to protect him?
We'll come by every eight weeks just to see how things are going... Who's this Indiana Jones over here? That's my husband, Hector. He's carrying that boar like in the movies. I see he's got a rifle. Don't let the kid near it.
Form filler. That's how they get you. Whatever you want to do in life, you have to fill out a form. There are forms for everything. You fill it out, it goes up, and they make you fill out a new one just to confirm that you filled out the first one.
We'll find them. I'm starving. We'll stop by Nathan's for a hot dog. There's nothing to cry about. This thing's empty. Fill it up.
Plus what do they have in common? Look, I'm serious. I'm worried about Alex. Look, between you and me, she came to my place last night, and she was in a bad way. I tried to offer her my help, but she wouldn't take it, of course, and now I've been trying to reach her all night and I can't get ahold of her.
Classify the formation, bounding overwatch. Never be more than 20 shelter gardens away. It may have a locator. You're just telling us this now? If they can track it, why aren't we surrounded by Redhats?
What if it protects us from it? Are we seriously discussing theory now? Do they know what they're doing? Science is rarely elegant. Cut it open.
Yeah, I forgot the bag today. [Oh, I don't think so because, you know, it's not just the statutory law, it's the law of civility, man. And I've seen you before. You come out of that building, your dog craps, and you just leave it where it falls.
This is a revised version. I, uh, cut a chapter, and made some minor changes here and there. And I'd be curious to know your opinion. Wonderful. You can't wait to read it.
"Work is God." In the evenings, he would tell me the story of the farmer and his sons. When he died, the farmer called his sons in to talk about the inheritance. "In my vineyard hides a treasure. "Dig and you shall find it."
How does he contact you? By sms. He asks me for information on every financial deal, - the most important ones. - We'll trace the phone number. - It'll be hot, but we'll trace it.
- Likewise, sir. How's that? They're cancelling everything. Zero matter, testing, everything. We're right at the fingertips of a way to change the world, and they want to make it disappear.
It's not safe. No, it isn't. In fact, I'm surprised to see you alive, Dr. Wilkes. I beg your pardon? Now, you're going to put the specimen in that box, and give it to me.
I'm crossing the T's on this report as we speak. It will be very politically correct. The spy, Wilkes... He stole sensitive material from the lab before blowing it up. I'm going to need your help to get it back.
Agnes Cully was discovered at the foot of the Olympic Film House in 1934. They gave her a pretty name, and put her on the pictures She became Anvil Studio's top salaried employee in '38. Fascinating. Is it in the file? I'll read it directly.
I've finished my research on you, Mr. Hunt. I know you served in the Pacific, which means you'll recognize the effects of malaria. Malaria? A particularly virulent virus, developed from an avian parasite by Stark Industries. There's an antidote, but if you won't talk, why should I give it to you?
Your newspaper! Take your paper! Didn't I see you here last week? We haven't changed the film. What's the point of seeing it again?
Don't let her touch you. I won't. No touching. Dr. Wilkes designed this device to extract quickly. Press the button on the side and then release it once the needles have made contact with the skin.
Dottie is my responsibility. I will not abandon her or anyone else to the clutches of Whitney Frost. Don't abandon her. The killing device on this necklace is wired to a different circuit. Activate it and we're done with her.
On your watch. And I'm not talking about office supplies. We're talking about highly volatile radioactive materials. Uranium, stolen from Roxxon. And you need to find it.
Oh, kinetic force stabilization. Mobile solar energy collectors... What, is he building a palladium core? He's a certified genius. Wants to waste it making movies.
Crime in this town... Crime, yes. Any leads on the Roxxon equipment? Not a single one. I don't think we'll ever find it.
- Sorry, we're closed. We're closed. Aw, nonna, you're gonna love my gravy. I put two cloves in there at the end, - spice it up very nice.
No, I'm not! No, I'm just trying something different! Oh, right. What would you like? Would you like me to throw it in the garbage?
He could eliminate zero matter. Maybe he could cure Jason Wilkes. Or kill Whitney Gel. Look, you already had me to admit, I-I don't know. Do you think you can build it?
It was real. Come on, Frankie! Come on. I don't even want to go to their wedding. - Why would I want to?
- Why would I want to celebrate? - You're the last option. I can't even look Robert in the eye. Then look at Sol! He's the reason I don't want to do it.
I'm really sorry, I did my best and I... and I... You didn't sell the memberships. I didn't sell any memberships. And now you expect to be fired? Would it be easier if you, like, wrote "you're fired" on a piece of paper, and left it on my desk?
I have to move in with my wife. Well, bless you. Press again. Just leave your elbow... Just leave it there.
What was it? Broken glass. Weren't you outside? Erwin just left. He must have put it on the edge.
That's the way I eat. If you don't like it, don't force yourself. It's really rare. If you could stop talking about the blood, I'd prefer it. I'm going to ask them to take it away.
How are things? Have you finished? I don't... His steak is a little too rare. Would it be possible to take it home and cook it again?
- You don't wish me luck. That's the most pertinent thing you've ever said to anyone. And by the way, you're wrong about this place. The fish is worth the price. Thank God you can afford it with your food stamps.
I could occasionally be on the open stage. Not if you're working that day. The application document. Nothing special. We'll give you a minute to fill it out.
He'll see your progress. What do I do until then? What do you normally do? I work. I've had an offer for this incredible film, and I'd love to do it.
Forget these people ever existed and leave them to us. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not sorry. They don't have to take my money. We'll get it back.

Rebuilt. After the fire. Yes. History is dark. If you write him a note, I'll be happy to give it to Mr. Pembroke.
If you write him a note, I'll be happy to give it to Mr. Pembroke. Mr. Pieterson? I understand that your work here is important and that you're a very busy man, but if you could find a moment between managing the aerobics and the baths to let Mr. Pembroke know that a visitor has some urgent information to pass on to him, I'd be grateful. I can also write a note to slip under his door with his tray, in the futile hope that he'll see it before his morning massage, but forget it.

What you're about to see tonight is no laughing matter. Even if it's not a joke, it's still all fake. No, it's not real magic. They're not wizards. Ideally, to do a trick better than the others, you have to make it your own, put your own spin on it.
Gus, the teacher. - What's up? - Here's the thing. He wrote a script. He asked me to read it.
It's all right, it's all right. I'll help you memorize. Splendid. Now, for the dagger... - You need someone to steal it.
Do everything you can to set her free! Hold your fire! Please don't. Not in front of my daughter. They wanted money. I told them we didn't have any, we keep it in the bank.
I'm doing you the courtesy of telling you that I'm going to publish the Whitlock article. You will? What article? The article. I have a reliable source and I'm going to publish it, and you know what I'm talking about.
Don't be silly, Eddie. I'm talking about Eagle Wings. - What are you talking about? - I'm publishing it tomorrow.
These people are horrible, horrible liars. I'll see you later. Simpson, not so fast. Grab a corner of that poster. Now use it to hide it.
Yeah, see, that's gay. That's not gay. This is torture. It's not the same. No. Pulling out my fingernails, or keeping me awake for three months, okay, but greasing up a dildo and pretending it's your dick so you can shove it up my ass, that's gay.

I'll do a quarter of that, less in a clinic. Really? You can forget private schools for kids. Oh, come on, Wendy. The money you have in the Axe fund... if you're allowed to take it out, if it's not just a Ponzi scheme...

You can't leave it up, can you? I'll tell you what. Alec, why don't you go and check by the Angel? We couldn't prepare at the Institute, but we know our ancestors left a cache here somewhere. We'll find it.
- The Prime Minister recently sent his personal attaché Yuri Krupin to the site. The reason... to stop this project immediately. The Prime Minister is against the sanctuary? Yes, because his opposition supports it... that is, the ministers you saw in front of you.
Patterson's boss? Either he's innocent - or he's covering up for them. - What did you do? I cloned their server and sent it to Eric and Nell. They're scanning it.
- And what about the cameras? - No archives. I asked for a description. White, brown hair. Bring the safe back here. Don't let him out of your sight.
I'm not going to reprimand myself. - Meechum? - I'm not excluding anyone. - I've got the safe. - Put it on the table.
We're on hold. Is there a problem? I just know we're on standby. Doug, the plane's going to run out of fuel soon. We have to land it somewhere.

I've examined every member of this team, except you, measured their commitment to this ideal, including two good agents who have given everything to protect this ideal. I think you can be a good agent, but I need to know if you think and want it badly enough.
- And who are you? Daisy Johnson from ATCU. Edwin, right? How did you know my name when you called 911? Because I heard you say it now.
I can't describe it, it was overwhelming. I felt powerless. I was so close to him, I had to save him. Edwin mentioned your name for a reason. Maybe you're destined to save him.

Is it for use in the forest or garden? - No, it's not. - Many people recommend the Stihl 3000, but personally, I recommend this little baby. The manufacturer calls it the turbo model. And it's true.

I want the truth, or what's between us is over. You know how we talked about how most Inhumans have that feeling where nothing feels right, where everything feels empty? Yes, like how I've spent my whole life looking for my parents. It's a classic attempt to fill the void. Well, I tried to fill it with vodka, but I couldn't control it... Neither the drink nor my temper.

We installed the precursor of this device in 2010, which enabled us to assess the dangers. It is estimated that at least 20,000 lives were saved thanks to the effective monitoring of Merapi in 2010 and the subsequent evacuation. I'm delighted that it's still working. Several colleagues and I hold the patent for the prototype, which we designed over 10 years ago. The technology is now found on volcanoes all over the world, and has revolutionized the way we monitor their gas emissions. It's my baby and I'm happy to see it.
per second. Blimey! It's lightning fast. It'll never work. It will one day. And when it does, we'll have to be able to program it.
Negative, capcom. It jeopardizes the mission. Do not jettison the retrorocket beam. Do not jettison the retrorocket beam. NASA confirms heat shield failure, which may not stay in place. If the heat shield is loose, the retrorocket bundle straps could hold it in place.
I want to remain discreet. Mr Caputo! - Donaldson... - I don't need your money. It's all right, take it...
I kiss your ears. My hand is on the big mountain in your pants, and I unzip your fly. I take off your shirt very slowly. No, it's got buttons. - I unbutton it very slowly.
And he was the only one to enter during this entire period? Describe this nurse. What a jerk. Look at his face. Let your eyes roam over him.
The house sucks, but it's been in the family for generations, it means a lot to all of us. Fuck this house. And fuck your family of no-good crooks. Be careful with that hammer. Don't make me take it away from you.
Go away! What are you looking for? Found it. Bhradain's roof is leaking. I'm going to help him fix it.
[Sighs] Oh. - [Ring] - [Sighs] - [Groans] - [Cellphone beeps] Wade Houghton. Leave it.
I'll show him your eyes as a reminder of how you died. Where is Eduardo? Just tell him. Tell him! My son will drain the liquid from your eye then cut it out if you don't tell me right now where your brother is.
He robbed a company last month. Think again, wise guy. Red Hood doesn't exist. It's just guys wearing masks. Yes, the most important member of the team will be wearing it, no doubt.
That thing's still there. Yes, but we've found a weakness. We can go on the offensive. Okay, if sacred ground hurts this thing... Then we take what we can from this place and turn it into a weapon.
Or, rather, she took a leave of absence... Look, all you needed to do was call me. Send me a text. I'm a big girl. I can take it.
You sitting down? Oh, no, no, no. I can stand the length of two men, Lieutenant. Because I'm bringing the desert climate to our Mid-Atlantic abode. It's absurd, it's quite abnormal, and yet, because I want to, that is.
You were abroad for a year, and I got bored. What's this glass harmonica thing? An instrument Franklin invented for parties, festivities... and, of course, lullabies Related. We can get Jenny and Joe on it, see if they can locate Franklin's Glass Harmonica, use it to involve the Family in some...
Randall... what you're doing, it's not you. My days in the second division are over. Nevins' business is mine. Anyone who tries to mess with it... will feel my wrath. Randall, you want Nevins' empire, take it, okay?
How are you? I beat a Ghoul. It was horrible. Come here. Nevins left with the only document Corbin tried to keep secret for 20 years. We'll get it back.
That the smell was the same. She said you were right. There's a path you keep missing. It's easy to miss. How many times have you watched me miss it?
- OK. STILES: I thought you had her perfume. I lost it. Then find it.
(Groans) Anybody know how we're supposed to get out of here? This place is still in lockdown. - It's not locked enough. - Yeah, I can feel it, too.
Hear that? That was the sound of real power. Another arrogant kid. A competitor to steal my name? You think you can take it from me?
No, not here. You stole my party. You gonna steal the lacrosse captain, too? I wouldn't think you'd be mad. - How could I take it?
And that's all I remember until someone shot me! You were going to tear us apart. It's not his fault. When a coyote smells fresh death, his senses are heightened. Blood drives him crazy.
Good news, I know where Julian's keeping Stefan, so sit back, relax and there's no need to cast that locator spell. What are you talking about? That's right, spoiler alert. While you were taking care of me, Julian stole Stefan's body. I'm going to get it back.
Somewhere out there is an elusive weapon capable of killing an Original. I suggest we pool our efforts to find it. I don't play well with others. Lucien's witch, Alexis, has left her clues in a rather secret puzzle. What if I told you I had the means to piece it together?
Relax, I'll just go and come back. That's easy. All I have to do is channel your power. See this foot, Davina? That's me tapping it, for once, for your own good.
I could order my comrades to fight on my behalf. Such is their loyalty. But we both know that's between you and me. Power must be earned and no matter how, I will have that privilege. Come and take it.
- I'll examine both laptops. With two hacks, I can follow the tracks - to find a common source. - How long will that take? I'll clone her phone. She retrieved it before realizing.
I thought I could afford it. Are you sure I can't? - Mrs. Harvey... - I asked for privacy... Deduct it from my salary, I suppose.
They were ready to kill me for it. Sara Harvey came after you? She didn't. Sara wants this murder solved. Whoever it was, they want to cover it up.
Anybody home? It could have been used as a weapon to break someone's neck. Sara Harvey wants this murder solved. And whoever it was... they want to cover it up.
But do you really think Damian Darhk cares about you? He believes the world needs a reset. And honestly, John, after what we witnessed = in Afghanistan, can you tell me otherwise? Okay, John. All right, then you and Darhk burn down the village to save it.
That's the wound Ra's made. If the life she possesses doesn't come from taking others, it will come from the life of the host. Thea, please don't go... There's only one way to stop this. My father once told me of an elixir known as the Lotus, and I'll give it to you, on one condition.
Whatever Reiter has planned, he's going to kill everyone here. Mr. Queen... It seems we're within striking distance of my prize. I want you both beside me when I claim it.
Stable. I need the totem. Did it have any effect? Felicity: separating him from Darhk doing nothing.
John and I will watch your back. I guess it's too bad I already sent out all those disinvitations. Clearly not, if you spend your time on gossip sites. Look, those bloggers love nothing more than a secret wedding. I'm leaking information that you want to keep it away from the cameras.
You know you don't have to do this. I do. The 3 words every marriage begins with. True love. People need to see it.
Or we're standing in the wrong place. If Andy says this is where it's going to happen, this is where it's going to happen. So far, no movement from the missiles. We should be there with them. Even with the sophisticated toys ARGUS gave John, this place is safer because we're watching it.
Who wants to go for a walk? Andy here may have mentioned the fact that his brother John works for Green Arrow, or should I say Oliver Queen? I know what you're all thinking, but no, he didn't tell me. It was just a little deduction from the Diggle involvement, by way of you, your little sister, your ex-girlfriend. But when you came to save that boy, William, that look was that of a father. I should have recognized that.
And pretty awesome. I think you got hit harder in the head than you think. No, he's right. I can't hack it. But if the bomb gets close enough, which it will... We could change the line of sight on the missile itself and disarm it.
Oh, my God, it worked! Whatever you did, it was amazing. We just countered a nuclear bomb. We've still got 15,433 more or less The code for the sight hack, can you distribute it to everyone?
It's too risky to wear the suits in broad daylight. What about the elevator in the old lair? Mr Dennis had it closed after Larvan's attack. So John's right. We'll go in and help you and your dad get him out of...
It doesn't eject. It never blocks, unless... This. We can't leave without the processor. - We can if we clone it.
Is that so? He's got a point. The world's falling apart, and so is Star City. It's worse than it's ever been. Because Darhk spent the year trying to destroy it.
I've seen too much! Stewie, look! It's the monster! Quick, Brian! Kill it! Kill it!
He posted a photo of his feet in the sand. You're a guy, don't do that! What a jerk. Hey, I'm gonna swallow his floss. You pull it out and we'll put it back on the roll.
In the air. Squire, my chamber pot needs emptying. What's he talking about? He's shitting in the waffle iron. Plug it in and close it, it'll burn everything.
I may be close to the grave, but I'm still a woman. I can see the love for a man in a woman's eyes. I cross her path, I hear her voice. My heart beats so loud everyone can hear it. I want to get him out of my heart, he's driving me crazy.
Ronny? My name is Guddu Sohan. I'm a producer. I started a film 2 years ago... And I had to start it over 3 times.
The monster wants to destroy the world. - It's all right. Mommy will stop him. Shh. Mommy wants to kill it.
What do you want from me, Aaron? I want you to understand. It doesn't have to keep happening. There's only one way to stop the cycle, Cass. The Witness destroys people like me, the ones who keep time from collapsing in on itself, but we can't hold it back forever.
Yes. But clothes can be a problem. I fit into this vest, but I had to cut a pair of jeans to get out of it. It's too visible. You have to keep an eye on an object for a while and then steal it.
I listen to Beyoncé. So... bow down, bitches! We wanted to give you my brother's number. He's a surgeon. And I'm happy to take it.
I've fought a Kree, they'll be hard to kill. These Reapers are more dangerous. That'll make it harder for you. Which is? For the experiment to work, we need the blood of a living Kree. It's up to you to get it.
I mean, things are a little out of control here, and I just wanted to try some new things before I go. You know my nickname at work, right? - The fixer. - Right. There's a problem with a plan, I fix it.
I told Craig I'd look after his grandmother. Much better. She'll be delighted to see you. I've prepared a gift for you. Would you like to see it?
What does he want? He's a parasite. All it wants to do is consume. But he's also got humans somewhere inside him, and you've spent a lot of time with both of them. We need to know his objective and we need to know him for yesterday.
I have a new informant at ATCU... he gave me the name of someone on their list. We're going to make an example of him. The world needs to know that Inhumans are a disease, and we're the only cure. Daisy... are you listening? I know if there's a way in, you'll find it.
Here's what you do. See the laser circuit at the back? You have to interrupt it with the mirror. Don't touch anything else. Right, leave it there.
Well, it's purely hypothetical, and there are plenty of unknown variables, but... Based on what Daisy told us about Hive's new pathogen... We think we know what he's planning to do with it. If it can create some kind of shockwave, then Hive can potentially infect a significant portion of the human race, turning them into the dominated Primitive Inhumans that Daisy was talking about... If, and only if, he can find a way to disperse it high enough into the atmosphere.
This urban legend still holds true today. It would be nice if, for once, the legend were just a legend. And yet, we must face the facts. The Jersey Monster is in Sleepy Hollow. You know, the best part of Sunday lunch is the part that follows it.
Find a way to protect her or... Jen! Let her go! No more than I'll tolerate anyone else's intrusion! My power is mine, and no one will ever take it from me again.
Jen! Let her go! No more than I'll tolerate anyone else's intrusion! My power is mine, and no one will ever take it from me again. Here, take it, let her go...
I don't know. I tried isolating every bandwidth and frequency on the recording. There's just no sound. Not to the same end. Play it back.
And it falls upon us to be the same. What role could we play to help in an attempt at deliverance? If I were to draw power from the Emblem as Pandora worked a charm with her Box, it might lower the barrier. But at the wrong moment, it could do worse only matters. If we can use this device to communicate with the lieutenant, we may be able to time it correctly.
(Joe... he's in pain. What's wrong? PANDORE: I can harness the power of the beast, but I can't direct it with precision.
- To proceed by elimination. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. Did they take anything with them? But a crime has been committed. Unless Miss Galdie doesn't report it as such.
Do you think he's the mole? And now he's scared. Freya, I don't know if you can hear this... Freya, I don't know if you can hear this... Have the place secured and guarded.
That and a reservation for hell. Lord God. He's against abortion. I'm pretty sure it's written down somewhere. Can we do it today?
A fresh batch. It's light. What is it? It's sand. A little salt to cover it, but the rest is just sand.
You see, I've kept my word. The price of your freedom is the Wulfings' agreement to my proposal. Make sure you keep yours. You've stayed in the shadows far too long. If you want power, then take it!
Beowulf, no! Look, he's calmer. Let's go back. He doesn't do here. Please don't kill him.
I bumped into him at the market, when I was spying on him at the market. - And the kiss? - My cheek still tickles. Maybe it was strategic. As a businesswoman and a woman, I'm still digesting it.
The contract for the lubricant gives me the right to decorate the box. - I know what I want to paint. - What do you want to paint? My vagina. If they take my face out of the box, I'd love it if they replaced it with your vagina.
And so am I. You want to know why you haven't arrested this guy yet? Because you're too nice... too decent. You of all people should know how indecent I can be. You give everyone the benefit of the doubt whether they deserve it or not, and Mr. X doesn't deserve it.
We're still waiting for the coroner's report. We can't just wait. We have to act like this is a murder. And assume that whoever killed Gwen has the computer. And it's either to use or to sell.
Yeah. Nothing can hurt this guy. But why would Gwen fake her own death? If someone was trying to steal the software... Maybe someone wasn't trying to steal it.
Nothing can hurt this guy. But why would Gwen fake her own death? If someone was trying to steal the software... Maybe someone wasn't trying to steal it. Maybe Gwen was trying to steal it from her boss.
But why would Gwen fake her own death? If someone was trying to steal the software... Maybe someone wasn't trying to steal it. Maybe Gwen was trying to steal it from her boss. So she could sell it on the black market?
How can we turn this into a debate? We're not. We're giving the computer back. We can't do that. If Phillip Thompson wants it back at any price, I say we give it back to him, and see what he does with it.
We can't do that. If Phillip Thompson wants it back at any price, I say we give it back to him, and see what he does with it. Val will shake hands, collect our fee, and Phillip will be a happy customer. But after that, he'll want to get rid of the software fast, which means we'll have to catch him in the act. So he can sell it back to us.
It's too far away to read her lips. but if you watch her body language, it's like she's saying, "Are you lost? Where are your parents? Should we call them?" Joey hands him his phone. The man walks away with it, presumably destroys it, and hides it.
For what reason, I wonder? Friends, the class action? Multiple sclerosis interrupts communication between the brain and the body. I tried to walk, but I staggered. I go for a drink, and I break it.
Where's my bracelet? Why do I get the feeling this phone call is for me? I need the bracelet. You're good at stealing from others, but when it happens to you, you don't like it. I was forced to steal it if I don't get it back,
Look where I am. That was before. I've changed. I'm going to get shot if you don't give me back the bracelet. If I give it back, I'm an accomplice to a crime.
Would you like to try Felicity's omelette? I'm fine. I already have. What's with the bracelet, Rhys? Why do all the crooks want it?
The minute you pay me back. So much for peace. I gave up this month's payment in exchange for the bracelet. In fact... We should go retrieve it from its secret hiding place.
We talk more now than when you were Christopher Hall. Where are you? On my way to the consulate to return the bracelet. Oh, don't do that. Agent Dao's looking for it too.
Can I have that? I'm sorry, sir. Mickey Shive was expecting me. What do you think they'll do with it? Sell it, of course.
What do you think they'll do with it? Sell it, of course. As will I. Who to? If you tell us about this bracelet, we can help you get it back.
That was for me. I hate that guy. You stay on Christopher because you want it to be him. But we can't ignore the other thieving families present last night. We're watching all of them. If Mickey shive has the bracelet and tries to sell it, we'll be there when Christopher tries to steal it.
You stay on Christopher because you want it to be him. But we can't ignore the other thieving families present last night. We're watching them all. If Mickey shive has the bracelet and tries to sell it, we'll be there when Christopher tries to steal it. And if Christopher has the bracelet? We'll be there when they try to steal it.
What's the good news? We have until noon tomorrow to get the bracelet. Do me a favor. When you get the bracelet, give it to me. I'll give it to Rhys.
You know I don't. You act like I'm supposed to believe you. After everything you've done to me, all the lies you've told... Did you at least get the bracelet back? Shive gave it to his boss, who's leaving for India tomorrow. I've got to get it back first.
Because I speak for both of us. Margot, we had a deal. Yes, we were to steal the bracelet from the Consulate in exchange for a missing payment, but... We had an agreement about the bracelet. If you want us to steal it again, you'll have to erase our entire debt.
That's why I invited someone she might want to talk to. No. She has vital information about the inner workings... Are you offering her a deal? And you're negotiating it?
Absolutely. Happy to help. Do you recognize this painting? Yes. The Singer Museum recently hired your company to protect it for an opening?
And he saved my life. My boyfriend and I had broken up. We had nowhere to live, he invited us into his studio, paid for everything, and we recorded a great album together. So, why do you want to break your contract? Because PMG won't release it.
He speaks. Why is he talking? What's this job? I worked my ass off to get a package delivered to the hotel. - We're going to steal it.
If not, I can put you in touch with the clinic for these tests. Great. I wanted to talk to you about the clothes he was wearing that night and if he still has them. I think he does. If you haven't already washed them, put them in a paper bag and seal it with tape.
I'll see you later, okay? Thanks, Ken. Come on, man. Take stock. Take stock. If you want to take stock, take stock.
Thanks, Ken. Come on, Ken. Take stock. Take stock. If you want to take stock, take stock. Take stock.
She doesn't have to keep a $900 bracelet. What money did you pay with? It's nothing to you. It's $900. Are you serious about this? You're getting it back, Kevin, and you're getting it back today.
You were right. Large quantity of venom in Vargas's blood. - A shape-shifter. - I'm in. I'm a shifter.
She'll be your cook Sister Bice has served three Popes behind you When she was young, she was a missionary in India And fortunately for us, she speaks good English So, my sweet Holy Father, what would you like for your meal? All you have to do is tell your sister Bice what you want, and I'll prepare it for you.
Is that right? Yes, it's true. We don't ask for money. There's no illicit traffic. I have a gift and I want to put it to good use... the needy.

This bungalow has been empty for years. I've never seen you... This bungalow belongs to my father. We moved to Bombay when I was 5. Are you planning to come back? No, I plan to rent it.
If you don't mind. I didn't bring it with me. Okay, but if you need any help... Yeah, sure. Or you can give it to Mom...
Listen up... Read the dosage on the box. Yes, it depends on the size. You take a tablet and hide it in his kibble.
"On TV, there are also pros", don't they say? - It's okay, I didn't say anything! - Attention, first text. - That's mine. - Shall we read it?
- Your computer is ready. - Perfect. - Do you work at this hour? - Overtime, too many viruses. I'll pick it up tomorrow. Around 7?
By Gotô, I was completely overwhelmed. I baptized over 100 adults and children and heard countless confessions. At Kichijiro, I felt the greatest need. You didn't take the rosary. I didn't deserve it.
Father Valignano, you will say that their deaths were not in vain. That God surely heard their agonizing prayers. But did He hear their cries? How can I explain His silence to these people who have endured so much? I need all my strength to understand.
Then I realized that whoever we were before we came to Renaissance is just fucking worthless! You create an image for the zombie world. Here, you don't have to be a zombie. Here, you have to kill your inner zombie, wrap it in plastic and smother it with a towel to shut its big mouth. Then drive it to a desert hellhole!
You're a kid. I'm not 20 anymore. Thank you for that. I know you're not. I'm a kid. It allows me to see the world as it really is. Not the way the zombies have conditioned you to see it.
As would my brother, who is constantly drowning at the bottom of the ocean. Killing Elijah is the only mercy I can offer him, Aya. But what if there was another way? Help me break the link between the Originals and their paternal bloodlines... And maybe I'll show you.
Are you sure? I saw it with my own eyes. Finn must have come back when Davina resurrected me. The spell was linked to the Mikaelson bloodline. Either it worked on him, or he found a way to deflect it.
I asked him for a favor. Look, the transition's gonna be rough, and your first full moon's gonna be a bitch. But like I said, you're strong; you can get through this. You'll never forget what happened, but... you can't let the past define who you are. Finn, give it to me.
You'll never forget what happened, but... you can't let the past define who you are. Finn, give it to me. Give it to me. Then go. After all this time, go ahead and destroy it.
Elijah, forever is a burden no one should have to bear. You can't keep that white oak in this house, Elijah. It's already a beacon attracting your enemies. Perhaps the best solution is obvious. Entrust it to the one who loves each of you most.
Perhaps the best solution is obvious. Give it to the one who loves each of you the most. I can hide. If it must exist, at least I can take it far from here. Hide it under a thousand spells, somewhere no one can find it.
In any negotiation, there comes a time when one party must submit. You're fast approaching it. Let the sisters help me resurrect Kol. He'll give us the missing ingredient, I promise. Otherwise, you may never find it.
They need my heart. Or one that's identical. Jackson. The unification ceremony didn't just marry us, it also made his heart a mirror of mine. We need to dig it out.
Only, it's going to take a while, but if I concentrate it in his heart, we can extract him with that... destroy him, and make sure we don't have any more - intuitive monsters on our hands. - Right. Meanwhile, I think I've finally found a way to kill Lucien. My mother once tried to kill my brothers and sister by reversing the Original vampire spell, and according to her grimoire, only the witch who cast the spell can undo it.
Once I have it, I can make Lucien mortal again. So what's the problem? Everything comes with a price. In order to take the Ancestors' power, you have to steal it.
All right, thank you, ma'am. I got a call from Raleigh. State's claiming the body. We called the ambulance. They're transporting him to Charleston.
They knew we were coming. Strange, isn't it, G'win? As strange as you not telling me what you were really going to do that day? Is that why you were wearing that lucky shell? You should have worn it all the time.
I already know what you're going to say. You're not going through with the wedding, are you? I knew you wouldn't. No, Asa. I will.
What's going on here? What's all the fuss? Didn't you promise to behave? Melissa, put your phone away. Put it away right now.
And on the detonator. See? I'll leave the detonator with you. It's armed. You'll keep it for the Master.
What the hell was everything who? Anonymous tip from our favorite cell. Probably just a crank. - Probably just a crank. - I'll check it out anyway.
Yeah, my mom's apartment's right across the alley. Okay, we have to be careful. There are eyes everywhere in this place and the whole dark world is looking for you. I mean, I guarantee you, no one's going to find this shortcut. I used to take it in junior high to see Clary.
Have you ever seen an action movie? We're on our way. What's taking them so long? It's a fire. Find it!
And now they think we're not. We'll do better. Jace, Alec and I will restore the family name and honor. Then you must understand that honor comes from actions. It's not a simple proposition to restore it.
You're trash! In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and all the saints and angels, I command you to say your name. I don't... Say it! Say it! Say it!
But they didn't want a black woman playing the piano, playing classical music. They wanted her to sing, because that's what we do, isn't it? I know you've come a long way, but unfortunately, the money Miss Simone thought was hers was simply not hers. It saddens me greatly, but we have examined as many of your contracts as we could find and it would appear that the copyrights to your songs were sold a long time ago. He stole my money and I want it back.
Nowhere. We're just walking. Stupid. It's good for your heart. Like it'll heal it.
I haven't left him because... he keeps showing me a good time. To him, everything I do is cool. I can make a crappy macramé bag. And he'll say, "It's a masterpiece." You understand? Don't make me wear it.
- To me. In this country, you can be anyone you want to be. Go show them. Look at the tip of my pen. Just with your eyes, follow it.
Thank you. I've written a book. I wrote a book, and I got more applause than you did. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present the World Mascot Association's highest award. The Golden Fluffy goes to... I can read it if you prefer.
I'll wait for him at home. Home? We'll rent a room. With what money? We'll rent this apartment, or sell it.
Let's go. We're risking everything, aren't we? Going against the Enclave, against the other Shadowhunters... Valentin's trying to destroy the world, Clary. We're trying to protect it.
What do you mean by that? We don't have a job. Don't look at me. If there aren't any jobs, I can't give you any, can I? There are jobs, but you reserve them for the old ones.
Of course it is. You're right. You're right. Hear that? It's the sprinkler. Your father will be angry if we leave it on all night.
Yoga is a democratic practice. Anyone can do it. Making zucchini ribbons isn't popular. You do realize that only rich white people do yoga, right? What about the billions of Indians who've been practicing it for over 5,000 years?
That damn shooter, he stole $1.2 million from me. He took my son. I lost a kid. He takes my money. I'm getting it back.
I'm taking your title, it's either that or you wear orange for the rest of your life. Orange, mother. No accessories. You had 30 years to make this call and we both know you're not going to.
- I am group O. I'm healthy. That's not the only criterion. You're a recovering alcoholic. If I'm a match, do it.
But I know my husband. If he were aware... "He would support me." He'd tell me to help by serving our country. "I'd serve it better in Germany than in the hospital.
Oh, he's... he's no miracle, I can assure you. Uh, Mrs. Neal... Sarah. Sarah... when the disease is gone, I want you to promise me that you'll take what's left of the medicine and burn it, bottles and all.
- Yes, is it weird? - Well, I... I know what you mean. I want you to see this place. I can if you describe it to me.
Knock yourself out. But Tepper won't go for it. The DA has him. And he's had time to refine his story. We only have 12 hours to dismantle it.
I know who you are because I watch the news. "The successful arrest of Wilson Fisk." I'm wearing a mask. Not on the ass. I'd know it anywhere.
Have you seen the piano? My son, Frank Junior... He used to take cookies and hide them in the bench. He played soldier. He'd guard it, protect it.
At least it wasn't a total dud. We found out about Kendra's bracelet. What bracelet? My bracelet... I wore it the night I first died.
But remember why we're here: to stop Savage, not slow him down. Do we have a plan to steal that bracelet? We're working on it. Please don't tell me the plan is simply to enter Savage's citadel and take it off his wrist.
All this time, I wondered why it was so difficult to locate you in the story. Because you moved through it. You'll learn that's just one of the things we have in common. We both do what it takes to save the world. Submitting the world to your rules isn't saving it.
The source of all our timeline information. Why didn't I know about this? No captain does. The existence of the Oculus is known only to the Grand Council, along with the greatest of secrets: the Oculus is not just a window on time, it has the ability to transform it to our liking.
Sorry, that's your job. Miss Lance, stay where you are. You're good at driving. About the tractor beam... Dr. Palmer will help me cut it off at a distance.
It seems your friends have let you down. How long do you expect to hold on to power without the support of the Time Masters? Not long, I'm afraid. But they have provided me with a time ship. I no longer need to rule the world, Chay-Ara. I now have the ability to change it.
Definitely. You don't fear not having power over Chloe. You fear she has power over you, but that's not true either. People don't have power over us. We give it to them.
The name, Lucifer and all. - And desire is your superpower. - It's more like a gift from God. You're thinking about it now, aren't you? I wouldn't recommend it.
A bribe, perhaps. Not sure. But I moved closer to hear what they were saying. And accidentally, I made a noise. I could feel it.
I don't know whether to be horrified or impressed. My friend has a horse. That's oddly comforting to know. What were you going to do with it? I was going to throw it at Tiffany.
The container. Did you hear me? The container's gone. I heard you. So why aren't we out there retrieving it?
The container's gone. I got that. So why aren't we out there retrieving it? What's all the fuss about? I guess if someone wants it that badly to steal it, then maybe they should have it.
- Lucifer! That's not the way we do things. This pathetic jerk's real name is Frankie Costa, and his real job is transporting and storing illegal goods. Maze found the warehouse thanks to him. So, if anyone knew how to steal it, he'd be involved in the theft.
We found out what your father never had to tell you. He was going to let you have the restaurant all along. If you don't even want it. I think I do. And maybe I could rebuild it.
(CLEARS GORGE) Um... So, you gonna take the job? Well, what do you think? Do you think it would be fun to work together? I think you should take it if you want it.
The album has already sold 50,000 copies. - Do it again. - No way. - Too bad for you. - I can release it without your permission.
Sidney, he won. 33 to one! Of course, I'll donate all the money to the church. Except there's a raincoat at Joshua Taylor's that caught my eye and... I'll give it to the church!
He stole $316, four packs of Newports, and six Baby Ruths candy bars. It's nice to know he has priorities. But forget about him. There was obviously an accomplice driving the car. If it's my mom, then Gary made her do it or she didn't know what he was planning to do.
Why don't you sit on the floor here, Buddha, and we'll check it out. That's not necessary, Officer. You're really tall, and I can't shoot you. No quotes match the license plates on half these vehicles. We should shut this place down permanently and go over it with a fine-tooth comb.
And we still have no idea who this person is? Unfortunately, no, and that's one of our best questions. But the fact that Emile and Tamika may have spoken to the same person just before their deaths gives us a warrant. We trace this mystery phone, but it's switched off, battery removed. Well, maybe the owner will turn it back on.
Sadly, no, and that's one of our best questions. But the fact that Emile and Tamika may have been talking to the same person just before they died gives us a warrant. We trace this mystery phone, but it's switched off, battery removed. Well, maybe the owner will turn it back on. And leave it on for at least an hour so it shows up online?
Like Jon Barnes? If we come to drug charges, we want double immunity from all federal charges. You've got your story. What about the gun? Did Dennis pick it up?
Look at all the minorities that gather together. A crowd makes you feel safer. - Congratulations, Lieutenant. - Congratulations, Lieutenant. Marriage is a wonderful thing, and that's why Provenza does it so often.
I don't want to hear you complain anymore: "Men never call me back." Press a vibrator against the chubby one, and you'll have to shut down a cell tower, because that man will harass you. Right? After you've made him shiver. Don't put it on maximum speed right from the start.
A few seconds later, I realize how stupid it was of me to tell him to go and look on the Internet. How could I? Figure it out, asshole! Have I lost my mind? I pull a DVD out of my bag and hand it to him.
What's that? Take care of yourself, asshole! Have I lost my mind? I pull a DVD out of my bag, and hand it to him. "Here's my name. Type it in and you'll see where I perform."
Vodka. Very dry. Two olives. Very dry. Too much vermouth. Are you going to serve it in a cauldron?
- Got it. The set should contain three parodies, something about advertising, - something about politics. - Good. Do they like the cartoon idea? Because I was thinking of illustrating it a bit, so they could read it like a comic book.
All right, then. It's about a girl who lives in a small town, and she makes sculptures. The whole town saves up to send her to sculpture school, and after she gets there, she never sculpts again. Why not? Because she's afraid. Can we read it?
Young? Fifteen years old? Illegal? How young? I can keep a secret. At first I thought I couldn't keep it.
"Thank you." I've called a car to take Jack back to the station, we could wait outside and then I'll show you the theater. Yes ? What theater? My father had bought an old porno theater and we're going to renovate it, so it'll be a place to do improv.
It shows who you are. Look at your sweater. It's ruined. It's dirty. Take it off.
... even if it makes people uncomfortable or angry. Because there's no way they're going to solve these problems if they don't know... So what do you think of what Monte said? I mean, how can we trust a bunch of legislators and social workers to understand what we're going through when they're not living our lives? The only way real change can happen is if we ask for it.
That's a good possibility. Hmm. Yes, I thought of that. The spell is called a Scarlatti Web. It can't be undone
Uh-oh. Ah, that never gets old. Great. Now I have two migraines. Let's take it down.
Okay, if I don't say anything, I won't get in trouble? Amazing. The code of conduct, young man. Read it, learn it, live it.
We're a week away from the test, and I don't like the results of the mock tests. 78% in English and 76 in math. These are not winning scores. I've been growing my number one bush for a decade, and I don't intend to cut it down.
All right. Do you want to know where the cameras are? No, I'll be fine. Did you read my article? Are you transcribing it already?
The NCO and "in a way more 'than two hours. Usually, after you pass out. How long was the needle in the arm, Captain? About half an hour. It looks like they're taking our blood and giving it to 'the other goal.
Misdemeanor. I'm stuck here. I have to spend the night. That's why I need your help. I've got a thing tomorrow. I need you to do it and pretend to be me.
So what? Interesting. A sonic weapon. The guards all wear these little earpieces that cancel out the effect. If they want, they can broadcast it throughout the prison, harming every inmate in a second.
I'm sorry, but I couldn't tell you over the phone. She had a child. - Or several, right? - That's right. So we need to find him.
And this. Not that. Well, we'd better get out of here. Who's ready for a massage? - Do you do it?
How's it going? This is a sampling of Strigo communications occupying a fairly defined amplitude. So far. A direct signal from the Master. If we could separate it from the other strigoïs, we could locate it.
The one that was born. Did he take it? He could be handing it over to the Elders as we speak. Or worse, the Master. - We've got to get it back!
That's quite a communication network you've got there. Anyway, thanks for taking my call. I'll do the talking. I've got your damn book. If you want it, you're going to have to keep your promise.
Can I buy you a drink? If it's all the same to you, I'd like to seal our deal as soon as possible. Why would you do that? You don't believe all those superstitions about the book? I'll just say it's been a burden owning it.
If we block them, they go back to being dumb animals. Ready to go? Come on, little monkey, how are you going to get that blood? Well, that's it. You grab the hose, you pass it through the cage, you bring the bowl back to you.
Is this what you looked like? But my hair was much shorter. What's the name of your kingdom? China. And who runs it?
- Help them brother, help them. - I'll try, I'll try. Now we've sent another signal to Paris. A sign from the gods! Do you think they can see it?
- I'll try, I'll try. Now we've sent Paris another signal. A sign from the gods! Do you think they can see it? Do you think they can understand it?
Why did you look at me like that? Like that? Why do you feel sorry for me? I think you're carrying a terrible burden. And you're carrying it alone.
He wants to say "I don't want you to go." [Why aren't you in the hospital? The knee was dislocated. They passed it back, but we have bigger problems.
What do you mean, do you know where he'd take it? Connor owns 200 acres of land north of town. - That's where the lab is. - How do we find it? It's an abandoned missile base, so most of it's clandestine. You wouldn't see it unless you knew it was there.
The lab is in the safest spot, which is the old mission area of fire control. There's only one way in, and that's across this bridge. Connor says the machine guns have been placed here. The guns are still there, but now they're triggered by a digital scanner that you want to get through. So you'll have to get into the office first to disable it.
[crickets chirping] - Stop! - It's... [crickets chirping] My medicine is in there. If I don't take it,
Are you sure you were giving me the right number? Yes, I'm sure. DUVAL: Even if it's off, you should be able to get through and find it, right? Even if it's out of battery, we should be able to find it.
Excuse me a moment. There's something bothering me. I thought it was the fact that you knew his nickname. But it wasn't that. It was the way you told her, and what you said about her.
What are you looking for? I'm just looking for an appliance. Did it belong to the Connovers? They're using it to get to Arkyn. - Why do you want it?
Clara, we really have to get to Arkyn. Where did they get that shield? They found it. On a crashed ship, which they followed from Arkyn. As soon as they knew what it was, they wanted to make it portable and safe, so... they put it inside me, took one arm, gave me Alice to protect it.
In the meantime, we'll be reading Golding's Lord of the Flies, a cautionary tale about entrusting power to a mass of fragrant, shaggy urchins. And that's not what's going to happen in my classroom. Okay, open books please, page 1. - The blond-haired boy climbed down the last few meters of rock and began to make his way towards the lagoon. Although he'd taken off his big school sweater and was now dragging it along with one hand, his gray shirt stuck to him.
- That's why I can't sleep - I can't, my nerves. - You're going to win. - No you don't - I don't know anything about rugby but I feel it in my bones.
Sing it. Sing, you little faggot. - They wanted me to sing? I was going to sing like a canary. I had this big gossip I could share and why was I keeping it to myself?
It's all right, it's all right. We have to leave. Vorza will be back with an army. All right. All right, all right. Let's move the body before it's discovered.
We seem to be dealing with experienced kidnappers. They have forbidden the family to contact the authorities. So naturally, they called us first. The man on the phone said he'd call back in eight hours. Monty will intercept the call and transfer it to us on the jet.
Good job, Mingo. - Yeah, Mingo! - Come on, Mingo. I love your money, guys! You can pick it up at the next fair.
You always have to tell people the real story. Leo, the fact that Lommers is trying to neutralize you means you're close to something. They lied about the bioterrorism, they lied about the body count, they're lying about the situation here! You don't have to reveal the location. As soon as you say there's an exit, the cops will know and block it, but at least people will know the whole story.
To tell you the truth, in my youth, I loved Vincent Price's cinema readings of his tales. Μbut what's your point? Poe wrote a brilliant essay entitled The Philosophy of Composition. In it, he developed a very personal theory about art. For him, true art is free of all moral or political considerations. Its sole object is itself; you should read it.
It's not easy being Frank Kitchen again when you look like a chick. I had to flatten my tits. I had to sit down to pee. And those fucking hormones had made me soft. There was nothing left of the old Frank but one thing. His relentless close-range shooting. And I couldn't wait to practice it.
Sell it. I'll buy it. It's none of your business, brother. Considering the money you owe me, brother, the whole estate is my business. Tell me your name! Say it, filth!
Tells me things. And what are these African ghosts saying? That the world is bigger than this farm. Of course it is. We'll never see it.
Do you want to try it on your own? Can we just try it one more time? Try this for a while. Next time you're nervous, imagine yourself doing the movement exactly as you want to do it. Then do it.
She won't stop until she gets the painting. She's texted me six times since we hung up. - They all say "Kenny Loggins." - There you go. You go to the garage, you pull it out. You say he lent it to you and you give him your best.
- His son. Katie, good to see you. I need a break, come on in. I don't want to talk about work during your break, but I have a question about the virus. If I can explain it to my students, that means I understand it.
She's the supply girl. She had no identification. She told the agent her name was Sara. I'll put the bear with the other personal effects. Maybe someone will recognize it when it's all over.
How convenient. No kidding. Whatever they're trying to hide, it's working. All right, then. We'll find someone to fix it.
What, it's not good? No. It's not that simple. Someone got into the file and corrupted it manually. First I have to recover the data, and then I'll decrypt it.
- At first I thought Thomas wasn't infected because he was resistant to the virus, which would have helped us make a vaccine. But now I know we can do better than that. I've just discovered that Thomas has virus-specific antibodies, which means he's been infected. But everyone who's had the virus has died. His body is fighting the virus, and this will help us defeat it.
I thought you were busy playing soldier? I found a recording of this delivery to the CDC. What about your other priorities? I said I would, and I did.
Do you have a plan to stop him? Back, please. I need to speak to Captain Scott. Food and water for two days. Empty the bucket, use it for garbage.
It's not a cure, but it can help someone live longer. So you need a human guinea pig. Try it on her. Without more time or resources, there would be a risk of ABO incompatibility reaction. to the antibody serum. Her body may reject it.
I moved anyway. And I kept moving. And the fear went away. Being your mother was the best adventure anyone could have. And I know it feels like someone made a hole in your heart, but you can fill it with memories.
Difficult to manipulate. To create a biological weapon, you need a willing scientist and hope. So you're putting us all at risk in case they do it? Sometimes protecting people means putting them in danger. But if there's a virus that can be mutated to be deadly, we need to know about it.
So you put us all at risk in case they do? Sometimes protecting people means putting them in danger. But if there's a virus that can be mutated to be deadly, we need to know about it. If we can mutate this virus, so can our enemies. If we can mutate it and create a cure, then we can survive an attack.
The future of the world is in jeopardy because of Vandal Savage. You have turned against the institution you were meant to serve. The Time Masters refused to act against Savage because he didn't threaten chronology. The Oculus isn't just a window on time - it lets you shape it.
Savage still has Carter and Kendra. It's a time ship. A little gift from our friends. I don't have to rule the world anymore. Now I can change it.
Why? Because Kendra's there. Because Kendra's there. How is that possible? She sent us a message through time. Go ahead, say it.
She would have to marry in a civil ceremony abroad and would have to live outside the country for a few years. But then you'll have kept your word and she'll get what she wants and be Mrs. Peter Townsend. Of course, that's the strategy. What strategy? Forcing me to make this choice and expecting me not to.
Wait, slow down. Go slower. Okay. You were going to give Lee the car job, weren't you? I mean, if you think you can do it.
- You read my book. I stayed up all night. It was a good read, by the way. They should make a movie out of it. It was a mistake not to read it, and I'm sorry.
I see no need to make jokes. The divorce will happen, and I'll probably find a lawyer to get access to my money. My dear, even if you do, you'll never get the money. Oh, really? It's all been transferred to offshore accounts where no one will find it.
The divorce will happen, and I'll probably find a lawyer to get access to my money. My dear, even if you do, you'll never get the money. Oh, really? It's all been transferred to offshore accounts where no one will find it. I'll find it.
I'm sorry about that. But all you had to do was apologize. And you had to take my side. You're the one who encouraged me to play the game. You play it a little too well.
Are you James Hamilton? Yes. Are you a volunteer? [I've heard about the work you do, and I want to see it for myself.
My apologies. I thought we'd meet in a neutral location to discuss custody. Custody of what? Of our social calendar. We need to divide it up and decide who's going to which balls, fundraisers, galas...
You haven't seen my biggest surprise yet. You made the bed? - But how? - I Googled it. And if it's messed up, I'll do it again.
Why should I be? It's fabulous! I thought you'd appreciate it if I set the table properly. I meant your uniform. It's wonderful, as if you were born to wear it.
It's just that you have to know that Gail and I... Stop it! Stop it! We're adults... divorcing adults. I couldn't care less who you stay with. In any case, when your penis falls off after being with Gail Fleming, please deposit it in the proper trash can.
Oh, very well. Mrs. Powell tricked me into getting the code for the door. She tricked you? How did she trick me? By asking for it and offering me nice things.
I know what I saw. I'm calling the police. Bring me my phone. Zoila, my phone... now. Give it to me now.
The obligation to stay true to the subject. To Polly. - I don't know what you mean. - I don't want to tell you everything. But Mr. Waxcap, I'll never read it.
Ok. If it ever happens to me, - what advice would you give me? - It's all about power. Who has it and who wants it.
If it ever happens to me - what advice would you give me? - It's all about power. Who has it and who wants it. If you have it, what do you do to keep it?
- It's all about power. Who has it and who wants it. If you have it, what do you do to keep it? What are you willing to sacrifice to stay on top? And if you want it, what are you going to do to get it?
He's the only qualified doctor here and you let him leave the island? Please, help us! Come inside. I think it's his appendix. Sudden pressure could tear it.
OK, together we'll find her a new Greek husband. - Is it too soon? - Yes. Don't worry, I've examined Leslie's arm and treated it. I'm pretty sure we can save it.
Don't worry, I've examined Leslie's arm and treated it. I'm pretty sure we can save him. His what? His arm? Save him from feeling a little stiff in the morning.
I'm not going down that road. I won't wear fur, it's in my contract. - I'm an anti-fur advocate. - Why is there a fur coat on your hanger? Do you think it's real? Even if it's not real, I don't wear it.
But God was just as determined. The 3rd was a girl, and so was the 4th. At this point, I was disillusioned myself. The food's ready, Dad. Turn it over or it'll burn.
A simple twig can give hope to a drowning man. And my uncle had just found two rescuers! I always dreamed of a son who would win gold for our country. But I forgot that gold is gold. It doesn't matter who wins it.
I'm your daughter, and I miss you. Is that a fact? Do you want to help me? Get me some butter from the refrigerator, baby. You won't get it by staying here.
Nothing! We vaguely slept together, but not enough to say, "That's your daughter. Hi." It's too easy! Me too, I take a kid and give him away!
You know... Which part of me helped the most? Good question. I'd say your smile. No, don't hide it.
We have a house. - That's quite a commute. - I'm taking the company plane. You mean you... You're flying it?
Save us time and energy. - Look, I... - Will you shut the fuck up? Just this once. Take the gun, put it in your mouth and spare us your bullshit.
His phone book. That's it! That's it! I'm going to give her back her phone book and then she's going to fall in love with me! How are you gonna pull that off? My senior year, I confessed my feelings in her yearbook, but I freaked out so I stole it from her so she wouldn't see.
The registers are full, transfers here and there, stripping one to pay the other. You pay tribute to the Salvation Army for not supporting vagrants. It's not illegal. The vagrants' lodge is too expensive. I agree.
Excuse me, I have to help my brother. The brother is Wesen. He's what? The one who dropped the mug. He woged when he bent down to pick it up.
I don't know, he's obviously losing his mind. But he's still causing us trouble, so we'll just have to deal with it. Look, here's what we're gonna do. When he comes back tonight, he's gonna ask for his money back. And we're gonna give it to him.
We're just naive bauble salesmen. He's taking all the money! Where do I find him? He's coming back here tonight to collect his money. But if you get rid of it, we'll give it to you.
OH- oh, yes. Hey. Headed to student housing? That place is flooded. No, no, I can't allow that.
Your family knows you're gay, right? Oh yeah. They know. Eat the egg camp. Aunt Francine will shove it down your throat if you don't.
It was a demon. Believe me, I know about demons. He was a great man. We were going to make the world a better place. We were going to rule it together.
The Titans need me. To hell with them. I'm out of shape. I'm the only one who can touch the crystal. He can escape, but not destroy it.
Pinot grabbed him in his jaws and started shaking him. - Damn. - He wanted to kill him. Or at least eat him. So I had to do the thing. I had to shove it up his ass.
through the... - Mud. - To see through the mud. I need this place. I don't know what I'd do if I lost it.
I'm really sorry about that. I had to take care of something. There's always a thing. Yeah, but I really wanted to give you this cake. No, you wanted to take credit for it before you even made it. In the end, you didn't, but you take credit anyway.
You can keep your job against your delegates. The offer still stands. I've been loyal. I got you this office. Do you want to keep it?
I want to act fast. Unless you have a faster idea, keep your opinion. - Yes, sir, I will. Do we have a problem? No. I'll work with Doug. When a dog bites, you either put a muzzle on him or put him to sleep.
We think we've identified them, but if we make a mistake, - we'll be weakened. - No names. Our scenario is written with me as the interlocutor. - We'll have to rework it. - Please do.
It's not as bad as I thought! She's very good, she's discreet. She's a professional. Ha! And that doesn't bother you? - Sure, it bothers me a little, but... she's so good. Geneviève, you'll tip her well because she deserves it.
Because it reminds you of your own weaknesses. And what you're missing that's keeping me from marrying you. I get that. First you broke my heart as a lover. Now you're breaking it as my friend.
Very true. Another truth? When I see you with another man, it makes me sick to my stomach. I hope your marriage breaks up tomorrow. If you've got the guts, break it.
You see everything. I've been wanting to tell you something for a while and not having you, like, right in my face makes it easier. I owe you an apology. I was too hard on you ... for the way you treated my ex-husband, how you handled yourself in the commission. You were right about terrorism even if I couldn't see it.
You're here instead of on your undercover mission. I'm clouding your judgment. You're clouding my judgment too. People shot at me with guns today, and... all I could think about was you. I want to do this job, I want to do it right and I...
It suits you. I thought a new role would suit you too. Head of the JTTF branch... Hannah's job. Yours now if you want it, well I guess you don't since I heard you asked for a transfer to LA.
I want to change before dinner, but I can't find my phone. Have you seen it? No. Go and change. I'll find it.
They've already scheduled my intake meeting. I'm going to use my money. They'll trace it back to you. They won't. I'll put it in a safe deposit box in the bank you were going to.
Because for them, eating their hearts out, fucking like brutes, that's the most they'll ever be able to aspire to. Words like "expansion" and "empire" have no meaning. They need to see the future. Feel it. Hold it in their hands.
- What's this? We'll get Eddie Redmayne to play the fetus. Do you hear yourself? We're not going to fake an abortion on live TV. We'll pre-record it.
I've got to go. We need to know who we can count on. It must be pretty deep. Where's my money? I want it now.
I told you to bring the boat back. It's in the lagoon. - We'll show you where it is. - It's stuck. Sir, we tried to bring it back!
Could we slow down, please! Who carries a passport in a foreign country? - I do. - I do, too. Everyone does. No, they leave it in a safe place like their hotel.
You guys are so nice. We got him. It's in here. In this room, under the bed. You take it. We're leaving.
If you love your Queen, William, you will support me. Help you steal a husband? The people will call you a teaser, a whore or worse. You're making a horrible mess, Elizabeth. Then clean it up.
- Archduke Forlay. - Yes, of course, of course. I'm not enchanted by this. Thank you for your gift. I'll think of your mother every time I wear it.
And be honest this time. I'm not going to lie to you. Poverty weighs heavy. So it's money you want. I want to earn it.
I'll bring you back in a moment. Have you had breakfast? I just had coffee. Good, I've got it. 149.99. What are you talking about? I'll take it!
But it is. Why don't I go ride it? And you call Cisco to come race him. We'll have a championship. I'll ride him.
Who's got your phone? Them! In there! Is that your phone on the sidewalk over there? Can you pick it up for me?
Can I have a dog? Why should you? Because you wouldn't take care of it. No, I will. I'll walk it and feed it and everything.
Me too. Okay. Where's the book? It's right here. But don't touch it with your fingers.
Here. ♪ I got the number. A0772BR5524. Where do I pick it up?
They're bad kids. The worst. What's with the cake? My class made it for Hunger Action Month. Shouldn't they eat it?
The worst. What kind of cake is that? My class made it for Hunger Action Month. Shouldn't they eat it? No, I took it from them, so they know what hunger is.
And look at this place. We've got half an hour. You've got half an hour. Cora's bringing in a boat. You've got to take it, or we'll all be stuck here.
When are you gonna get it through your stupid head that I do everything for you? Especially the things you can't... like Snow's heart. How long have you been trying to get it? Because it only took me a day. And it only took you an hour to lose it.
Ready for your trip? Don't do that! I've done it. I've already cast a spell to seal this portal once you're inside. Even I can't open it again.
Super. Who is it? According to Cochran, the technology expert. He's the key to the whole network. If he created it, he won't just cut it off.
Come in. Sit down, sit down! This'll do. Do you know why I called you here, Phears? I suppose it has something to do with my mission to unleash an army of ghosts on the world and plunge it into an abyss of darkness?
I'll be fine. Do you know why I called you here, Phears? I assume it has something to do with my mission to unleash an army of ghosts upon the world and plunge it into an abyss of darkness? Wrong. It has to do with your failure to unleash an army of ghosts upon the world to plunge it into an abyss of darkness.
Yes, Nicky and Tara. Felicia! Yes, Mr. Drake? The mirror's all dusty. But I just cleaned it.
What does he want? He wants the crystal you found. Our parents didn't hide it for nothing, and if Phears wants it so badly, he must have a good reason. Like taking over the world. Max, we have to hide this crystal where Phears can never find it.
We've got to go! The crystal I gave you. Thanks again, I love it. That's great. But I have to get it back.
But I have to get it back. - Why do you want it back? - It's a long story. You'll get another. You have to give it to me now.
Nothing like it to get the old blood flowing! Isn't it brave of them to want to save you? Now it's your turn to save them. Give me the crystal. Free them, and I'll give it to you.
All you'd have to do is take the crystal. Maybe I don't want to. Maybe you can't. You can't take the crystal from me. I have to give it to you, don't I?
It's so beautiful, Max. Please, will you give it to me? Anything. Yes, Max, give it to me. Put it in my hand and everything will be fine.
I'd be aware of being me, right? Would I know I had to find the portal? There's a catch. There's always a catch with fairies. Your alternate self could consume you if you let it.
Ok. Wrong tactic, no runes in this dimension I'm from an alternate reality. If that were true... Without an anchor you'll be assimilated into this world. Believe me, I'll try to beat it.
We were fools to think Valentin was dead. Previously... My sister wants you to be her lawyer. For a good price. - Name it.
What is the White Book? It's an ancient book of magic for wizards containing spells more powerful... than most magicians could imagine. I had the book when your mother came to see me, and I used it to create the potion. Unfortunately, I no longer have the book. I asked Jocelyn to hide it so Valentin would never find it.
And yet true love can't die. But people can. People are more than toys to entertain you. Hundreds of years and still so naive. You wouldn't know what to do with love if you found it.
No, don't be so modest. If you hadn't made a tourniquet with that scarf, Robyn would have bled to death. Speaking of the scarf, where did it come from? Robyn was wearing it.
I've been involved with some shady people, but I'm fine. Is that okay? I'll start tomorrow. There's no blood coming out of that sweater. You should throw it away.
Let's have a look at that button. It looks ordinary. No, I feel something emanating from it... a lot. You really don't feel anything? Maybe you should put it away.
You said your discipline was historical magic. Yes, it is. The Romans still fascinate me. In fact, I'm about to publish my third volume on the illusions of the Collis Aventinus (Rome's mountain). Can I see it?
You've evolved. It's time. No pun intended. Not to state the obvious, but we're pushing the boundaries of what's magically possible. We're working our way up to the energy glass ceiling so we can break it.
I'm more concerned with justice. I was just enjoying a moment of peace. What's the matter, Mom? Tim needs a doctor. We can't pay him.
Do you like me? - Very much. - That's all that matters. Life is fleeting. If happiness is at hand, grab it with both hands.
There will be progress, and maybe sooner than you think. Now let go of my arm, before we draw the wrong conclusion. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. You say there will be progress. When can I see it? - Soon.
You look pleased. I had an excellent meeting with a merchant, an acquaintance from Leicester. It could be very lucrative. Police investigation, mademoiselle. Do you recognize this wallet?
You're burning up. No, I'm cold. It's not very explicit. It doesn't say what to do when the cord is cut. Just swaddle the baby and hand him over to a nurse.
He must be looking for a doctor. I wonder what it is, a little boy or girl? It doesn't matter, a daughter or a son, as long as he's healthy, - but I wonder. - He's unwanted. I desire him. James wants him.
Why should you care? You have to see that what you did was unforgivable. You BEAT ME! And, for that, I apologize. You know my temper better than anyone, Arthur, and you've given me good reason to lose it.
So why do I get the impression that YOU are going to be the head of the Satis house... not me? Everything I do, I do for you and for our friendship. You've made me angry, because in a single act of drunken madness, you nearly ruined everything we've worked for. Putting you right back in your place as head of House Satis and on the Havisham legacy. We started this journey together. Let's finish it together.
And we definitely don't want that, do we? I didn't say it was Rebecca. What I'm trying to say is that a little trouble could be a blessing. I'm listening. If Senator Morra waits just a little while between doses, just long enough to draw his blood, we can use that clean blood, put it on a new identical coat.
And this Brian story is your story? The memory implants and the innocent man on death row? It's better than what I got And it happens to be true We can sell it, Brian
- A job? - Mm. A very lucrative one at that, working on the senator's private security team. I'm going to write a number on a piece of paper. When you see it, I'm sure you'll be convinced about how serious we are about having you on our team.
It's Kalinka! I can't believe he knows that. Did you get lost? My wallet's been stolen. Will I find it on you?
Gordon was an investor. Are you saying your husband had a kidney that was 3-D printed? The first one ever made. Great. Certainly explains why someone would want it.
I don't know why I didn't put it to bed. You know how I feel about the thing. But I was tempted. Let me guess. I was thinking about giving it to my mom.
I always wondered what it was like to be like Brian, when he was on NZT. I thought he felt numb as a human calculator I was wrong. Every part of you feels alive, Open... the air crackles with information You breathe it in like oxygen.
- We've packed a bag for you. - He's not coming. He's not? I'm not taking the bag back inside. Dylan can have it.
I lost a glass of milk. You lost a glass of milk? Was it full? To the brim. I could barely carry it.
What on earth has happened to my castle? We sort of dismantled it to make houses and stores for everyone. That would explain the déjà vu. You tore it down? I demand you rebuild it immediately, or I'll have you all cut to pieces and...
So, as soon as you guys fix me up, I'm back and I'm gonna finish this reno. Look, I'm no expert In this field, But I think you should hire Somebody to finish this job. you're gonna feel Another pinch. No, I have to do it myself.
Surely with imaging. I knew we should have Bipper Dr. Harris. I'm going out for a while. I want a catheter and an IV ready for when I get back. We need to perfuse this liver to keep it viable.
Is it still a "thing"? If I get a viable graft, yes. The saphenous vein. It's pretty thin, and she can live without it. Prepare another surgical tray, place it over her pelvis.
-firecracker? Yes, that's it. And that's me. Right, sorry. Okay, Dr. Williams, I need you to support the liver, on sponges and hold it steady, that gives me better access.
He taught you that you didn't have to do anything to be loved. That all your needs had to be met. He's a good man with a big heart who screwed you up. He made you believe you were entitled to everything, and you're lost when you don't get what you want. You could refuse your love if you didn't receive it. You never feared losing it, because it always gave it to you.
I'm so happy. It was important for me to have the support of others. There was a moment when I felt I could trust myself and that I was in the right place. Everyone wants to know what happened after the call. I came here with the weight of the world on my shoulders. I got rid of it and I don't want to take it back on.
When I think of the families affected by this week, when I think of the companies and employees, it all makes sense. What do you want us to take away from this film? I hope that one day, someone will see it and say, "It's wonderful to see these people transformed." Let them watch it for that, and maybe they'll think about what's possible for them.
I give you my word. Or... you give me your left nut. [What? Mail doesn't go through, I carve your left nut and feed it to my dogs.
He's right, Nick. You can't go alone. I'll be fine. Wait, what if Black Claw knows about the keys and knew they were in the safe? The Black Claw doesn't know we have the safe, and the people they sent to find it are dead.
Give him a pen and paper. Who do you want me to give it to? I'll tell you what. I'll keep it with me. I'll give it back to you when this is over, okay?
My ex wants to come back. Her grandmother smuggled it out of Nazi Germany in her vagina, so it has sentimental value. Many people come to this store to look at this ring. Well... Well, don't sell it.
Her grandmother smuggled it out of Nazi Germany into her vagina, so it has sentimental value. Many people come to this store to look at this ring. Well... Well, don't sell it. Can you take what I've got and put it on hold?
Didn't catch that. I said yes. You had assured Mr. Pfender that his engagement ring was waiting at the pawnshop. But we called to check, and that the ring had been sold. He said he'd hold it;
Sorry, I tried. Maybe a piece of wood from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. You mean the tree from which Eve took an apple in the Garden of Eden? If so, we've just been to the other side of the world and risked our lives for a stick that has swindled all mankind since the dawn of time. Maybe that's why they buried it, because the gates of hell are about to open and the world as we know it is about to disappear.

- Oh, my God. I knew it. I knew it. It's blood poisoning. Quick, we need a tourniquet. Put it on his arm before another infection
We've found what caused your husband's paralysis. Please tell me it's good news. Yes. Dr. Harris identified the problem. We were able to fix it.

No, but he'll be watching, he'll be close by. Yes, but so we can catch him. Then it'll be over. What are we supposed to do? Send the bastard a message and hope he gets it.
Okay, everything's fine. It's got to be here somewhere. - He has to be. - All right? We'll find him. We'll find it, okay?
What happened next? He had me pour bleach over her body. Then cover... her face. To finish it off. So he'd never have to see it again.

Goodness gracious. Let's issue a warning. To be covered. Kenneth, this should come from you, as chief scientist. Take it to the Prime Minister.
Let's issue a warning. To be covered. Kenneth, this should come from you, as chief scientist. Take it to the Prime Minister. He won't read it.
But I do. I know what's inside us, and I know how badly it wants to come out. Go ahead. Shoot me. Spill my blood, lick it up afterwards, and then run away with me like the animal you are.
I've already signed you up. Thanks, Dad. Mrs. Paulsen. May I offer you a drink? I won't be here long enough to finish it.
- Don't tell me. They said we're not in a position to poach anyone. That's exactly what they said, right before they offered me a job. So, you're here to tell me you passed. I'm here to ask you if you want me to take it.
You think you're better than me? It's not about who's better. It's about who's better for this case. And my life is on the line. If I go because of my calling, I can take it.
If I go because of my calling, I can take it. If I go because of you, I can't. This is not only your life. It's as much ours. Well, as I said, it's my calling and I'm doing it.
You heard her. She said the fact is I'm not a fucking lawyer. Well, the only way to change that fact is for a jury to see me be a fucking lawyer. You try that, all they're going to see is somebody going to jail. It's my call, and I'm making it.
Well, enjoy it, because it'll be your last meal - as a prosecutor. - Mike Ross promised me that if I gave him the phone records, he wouldn't say anything. I'm not Mike Ross. and the way I see it, I have no reason not to tell Gibbs about your questionable past unless you give it to me. And how am I supposed to do that? You pack your lunch, take it to the courthouse café, and share a table with any juror who shows up at break time in about two hours.
I just spoke to Vanessa. David Green never showed. Whatever it is, Louis, I don't have time. Well, you better find him because Gibbs just offered me a deal. I assume you told him to shove it up his ass.
Then don't come... Sorry to interrupt, but your cousin Gertrude's on the line. She wants to know if you've found her old recording. Tell her I haven't. Tell her it must have been thrown away, and never to ask me again.
And the customers who were willing to stay with you before won't be now. That's what I'll miss the most. Miss what? Coming home and seeing you. I know I should have told you what I was going to do before I took the deal, but I didn't know I was going to do it, and I had three seconds to make up my mind.
Elizabeth, this is Barbara Menninger. I'd like to apologize. When I realized who you were, I overreacted. I thought you were a pretty terrible person and you weren't. you deserve a second chance, and I want you to know that the apartment is yours, if you still want it.
I wish you didn't have to come home to this empty apartment. I don't know about that. I'm a bit empty. I'm having to... take my time. Fill it with what I want.
I'm not interested in disappearing or dying in the foreseeable future, so I'm going to look at your back and pretend to look at you. Is that clear? Your assistant said you had some urgency to discuss. We have a major breach of national security. Everyone with a tree to shake has been ordered to shake it, see if anything falls out.
All those lives in danger, and you didn't help in order to force it down my throat. What do you want? The Keeper's ledger. I'd like to borrow it. If it were up to me, I'd burn it.
Was this your plan? 'Cause a little sooner would have been nice. Tell you the truth, until I pulled the trigger, I hadn't reconciled my mind though. Well, have you created it now?

Look around you. When I lost my daughter... I crawled... crawled into savagery like a mortally wounded animal to get as far away from the pack as I could, to... to use up all the time I was given. To use up all the time and die. If you've come for the survival manual, you won't find it here.
How did it go? Not really, no. The guy I was supposed to give it to, I wanted to give it back to Gabriel, but he was unreachable. So you took it home? I couldn't leave it.
Did it go that badly? I've been thinking a lot about... There was a... kid back home, after the war, when the country was still in ruins. He and his friends used to pick on me when I went into town to buy milk. They'd steal it and beat me up.
Who are you with? Call me back when you're alone. I want to talk to you. About my number. Don't know it.
All right, then. You can explain to your wife what you were doing there. Call her. Take out your phone. Take it out, I said.
And now it's a problem. It's not a problem. It's a reason to get involved. You saw that some people brought up the breakfast program again. How you pushed me to change it.
It was inconceivable to be at school and hear a gunshot, this sound that violated this space... it didn't belong here and it didn't make sense. The birth of my children is very important, but this event touched me as a father, a husband, a parent, a teacher... a citizen, a friend. It changed... it touched every aspect of my life. It's hard for people to understand what mass trauma is. If you haven't experienced it, there's no way to describe it accurately.
I'm scared. I'm really... I'm really scared. I've spent my life trying to fix things, but I can't... I can't deal with this. I don't even understand it.
She's got to move on. She won't do that, you know? She'll listen to you. Why should I deliver this message? She needs someone to tell her.
They would have spotted us, and so would she. Don't worry, she's equipped with one of the best tracking devices we have. Sound, position. Battery life... - She just threw it away.
Of course she threw it away. I would have done the same. And if Sandstorm is half as good as you say he is, they'll scan it. This tracker is almost invisible. If they find it, there's little chance they'll keep her alive.
Jerking off the MCC? Who cares? I know it's been a while since you've been a goalie, but you must remember what it's like to be on the field, or has your nice suit given you amnesia? I've had enough of this. You hired me to do a job and you're going to let me do it.
Where the garden used to be. As close as possible. Can you warn everyone? Don't you trust me to bring juice? I know you're not going to steal it.
I'm going there right now. I'm going to call him. I don't have his file. The crisis management team has it. But as soon as I get it, I'll call him.
I know things are tough. They'll get better. Hello. Have you seen Dad's phone? He can't find it up there.
Someone's in the house. Hey, Lee, I'm not staying here alone. Where's your gun? Where it belongs, in a drawer upstairs. Shouldn't we go back up and get it?
Except with her best friend, Amy. Sorry, were we saving that for something? The party. Goodness gracious! I can't see the cork so I'll just plug it with a... fresh carrot?
Sedan black. I can't read the plates. Maybe you can. The memory's in my head. You'll have to go and find it.
Her memories are a mess. It's as if... they've exploded in the middle of his consciousness. It makes me dizzy. His mind is completely fragmented. - Can you defrag it?
With what? The computer. The computer, of course. Yes, that's why we're here. Get it on board, tag it and get it back to the lab.
The computer. The computer, of course. Yes, that's why we're here. Pack it up, tag it and get it back to the lab. Afterwards, I'll look for a garbage can, a laundry basket, a bread box, something to carry it in.
Murderers make mistakes. That's how we catch them. No. The ventilation system is the heart of the laboratory. If anything goes wrong with it, someone notices.
I love being back in the field. You may have fooled me. But you're making decisions like you're still in charge. Let me ask you something. If it was you sitting in my chair, and Billy and Meredith pulled this kind of stunt, how would you handle it?
- So much for safety. - Check this out. Ellen is the only assistant to have logged on to both his calendar and personal e-mail. And he hasn't noticed. If you don't look for it, you won't find it.
- In Germany? Hanuman Chalisa is engraved on it. Daddy loves it. Take good care of it. We'll put it in the trunk tomorrow.
So you're saying they're going to try and launch - ASAP? - That's what it sounded like. Once they launch, they'll have no reason to keep you alive. All right, we've got to make a game and we've got to make it now.
- Yeah. We need to get to a power source. (Weller) We know where that is. Now we just do.
Here. Try and climb that hole. - Can you do it? - Yeah, yeah. Need something to seal it.
Did you bring my crossword puzzle? Did you solve another tattoo? "Got One, Patterson." Wait. (David) Pretty clever, huh? It took me forever to work it in there.
The building thinks it's a drill, but if there were a real emergency, the lockdown would be bypassed and the evacuation protocol initiated. The doors would open. You want to fool the system into thinking there's an emergency? The solution is extreme. I can't access the system, so I can't fool it.
Carlos... There's no way out. You won't get out of here free. Give yourself up. Is she dead? Can you do it?
And I'd ask my guys to contact Sadie's family and friends. Maybe they'll shed some light on this love affair. See Marcus? And you were worried. guys, we've found the dirt, now let's keep it closed.
And you took advantage of that, and I admire that it's a good deal. Good points. But I don't like carrying debts. Unfortunately, Dark One, the contract is binding. Even if I wanted to change it, I couldn't.
But the Cho family is fierce and stubborn. My parents... They campaigned, researched, even mortgaged the house to keep going. In 1994, I started experimental gene therapy. By the time I graduated in bioengineering, I was in total remission. And as an engineer, when I see a defect, I want to correct it.
Aren't you supposed to be more... Taller? Well, not to be mean, but you said your heads block the sun. Yes, they do block the sun. You need to catch it at the right angle. Sorry about that.
- What do you mean by that? - It was the women who invited me. We have some advice for you. Yeah, don't be a jerk. If you know the advice, why don't you take it?
Yes, just a second. What kind of book is this? It's philosophy. - Let's start again. - Can I borrow it?
What do I do? Training. We have to give them all our weapons. We can't! If you keep it and they find it, someone will pay with their life.
You're kidding yourself. Maybe you could... start in someone's salon. Learn the trade and take over. You'll be boss in no time. You're like a parasite on a parasite that manages to control it.
Which reinforce the stereotype that black people are stupid and superstitious. They steal and love to be fed and laundered servants. And I'm not even talking about cannibalism. - Frankly, it's disappointing. - I sincerely regret it.

That's not how Erica got the information about the theft. Instead, she found a weak link: a marshal who was the victim of an underwater hunting campaign. The leaked flight number and the marshal carrying the witness. What about the victim's name? I don't see it anywhere.

He chose to look like Aaron, and no, I'm not crazy. It just happened. Is that even vaguely possible? Yes, there's a psychedelic juice amalgamated with this tea. They'd drink it, and they'd see it in their heads.
No. You can fool those jerks over there, but you can't fool me. You've tasted blood. You know what it's like. You want it.
What's he doing here with you? He hates you. Jake's home. So should you. Then again, maybe it's better to fight for the pleasure of ripping the beating heart of power from America's chest, holding it in your bloody hands, than never to have entered the battle at all.

I thought we decided - to talk about the system. - No, you decided. I've been trying to change it for ages. This system is 15 years old. I know it is. We had a cake to celebrate it the other day.
I have no logical explanation. Except... No, you've been wrong about our firm's name for days. You just got lucky by giving them the wrong name. I mean, look at you. Your heart wants so badly to believe it, but your limited doctor mind won't let it.
So I went over all that history with Hartley, didn't I? And he postulated that we could create some sort of dimensional adjustment fork... There you go. Okay, you didn't do it yourself. Let me handle this one. - All right, take it.
Sedate her. Will it work? Absolutely. It's a miracle. A machine can't command, it can only follow orders.

I know I'm not wearing the right outfit, but I promise you, they're real. They're great. And there was this rose for you, too. It's like this rose was painted. You know, it stands out from the rest.
I don't want to see that. It's gross. Are you kissing that? I can't believe you made this ice cream, Ally. It's better than the ice cream at the restaurant.
I thought if I had a party, you'd come. I love your room. Yeah? It's my dad's old hangout. It must be bright.
Where are you from? Do you have a medal? I know that smell. Don't be frightened. It reminds me of a time long ago.
Grandma's here. That smell again. I'm fine now. That's quite a surprise. She's stronger now.
Down with Vortigern! You've found a way to control the sword. I wasn't controlling it. Here. It controlled me.

That's more than enough power. It's not designed for a space launch. I don't know if it would hold up on entry. The cabin works in space. It'll take a beating.
Where is the unidentified life form? Movement? Walter! Just a moment. There it is.
I'll get out of here. I want to talk to her alone. You won't be so harsh as to prevent a daughter from saying goodbye to her father? Eternity has the leisure to grant a minute. Once this door is closed, it will never open again.
Forgive me, mademoiselle, but I will show you to your room. My room? - But I thought that... - What, that "once this door is closed, it won't open again"?

Raees wants to add color to your life. Hence the TV. But Raees was resourceful, and by dint of his attentions and money, he had won everyone over. Raees-bhai, you know what's happening at the factory. It's going to close any day now.
Pass me my jacket. We're going down the pub. A good lad from Trent. He was a good lad from Trent. With a cock so long it fell off.
A good guy from Trent. He was a good guy from Trent. With a cock so long it fell off. To relieve himself, in a case he stuffed it. But then it exploded!
With scheduled flights, but no longitude or latitude. And without these parameters, we have no idea of the drop point. You can make out a stretch of waterway, but that's all. Have you tried enhancing the image? It's pixelated.
I've got it. I've got it. Put your foot in there. - What's this? - A Faraday cage. If we're lucky, it should block the signal.
- It's already here. At best, I estimate we have eleven months to go. No, sorry, I meant days. We have eleven days left. Since we're the Power Rangers and this is our ship, if I head for the door, will it open for me?
But Man arrived long before... to escape the tyranny of Harald Hårfagre. Harald of Norway. Later, new pioneers brought the word of God to the pagans. What was life like? It was simple.
When the ice melts, it creates this river. The glacier slides a little further, refreezes... It's a constant cycle. Life recreates and reinvents itself. Jenai, she's trying.
No... - That dress looks good on you. - What's the matter? Your dress is pretty. It's not mine.
- That dress looks good on you. - What's the matter? Your dress is pretty. It's not mine. It looks good on you.
Commonly known as the patient pomegranate. Patient? The motion detector is activated. If you move, the grenade explodes. - How powerful? - It will destroy the house and us.
- Soldiers. Tick-tock, ticket control! Not to complain, but this room is empty. You ran out of ideas? It's not empty.
Who's ticklish? There you go. Now, that's my story. Our story. Fortunately for me and my brother, it had a happy ending.
- Yes. - Can I stay on Earth? - I can't answer that. - Why rain? - Because it cleans everything.
From time to time, we see a blurred shape pass by, but only a few images. Then, on the night of the murder, this was caught on camera. What in God's name? The other cameras didn't pick it up. And as soon as this thing moved, it disappeared.
What do you write about? Various things. About two weeks ago, did you write about the discovery of what you describe as an alternate reality? Another dimension. Yes, but it's real.
I've wasted years of training at K'un-Lun on a virtual threat. - This is insane. People are dying because of this. If synthetic heroin hits the streets, it'll affect your students. It'll be on the market, and everything you've done for them will have been in vain.
The apology got you into this mess, so yes, officially, it's a statement. It's the first step in IGC's plan to save the company's image. What about the factory? What about it? Maybe it's making people sick.
To know the truth, I have to find her. What if she won't talk? She will. Have you considered the fact that your idea sucks? It doesn't suck.
Do you want the money or not? There's no money. Of course there is. The offer doesn't expire for two days. It doesn't expire.
Not bad, eh? This is where I should be right now. I'm going to surprise you: these images don't come from a huge camera, but from one of these little things. This camera is wireless. It transmits the image by satellite.
I don't want to have to track down the people I love. We'd lost sight of Mercer. But what if we decided never to lose touch? What if we didn't have to look, what if we knew everything? What I'm proposing is radical transparency, a continuous connection. And it has to start here.
No, not George B. Imagine hundreds of horses drinking from the same contaminated water source. - Is it deadly? - It can be. Untreated, it spreads to the horses' intestines.
I can't believe my girlfriends are at a Dards Mortels concert. I am here. I'm cursed. Maybe we should take a break, honey. This looks like a nice place. What do you think? Ah. It moved! The shoe. It moved.
And two, the only thing we can really give another person is information, so... See this camera right here? The moment you make a move, highly-paid men with guns would take their places in this room. With very... specific instructions. She's not to save me.
And the photo? It's a photo of my family home. A photo of my parents' house. - I haven't seen it. - It was on my desk.
You're one of us now. Would you risk your son's life? What have you done? Killed him. James, the powder isn't ready to be moved because it's unstable.
From what I can make out, that's where we have to go. But there are no more roads. The information Major Briggs gave me made me think. You'll understand when... I've explained my map. This map is very old, but it's still up to date.
I say to myself, "I wish I were there." - But you are. - I know you are! I feel like I'm watching from the outside. I see this life and I think it's wonderful... but it doesn't belong to me.
I don't hate her. This isn't about your father or her or me. It's about you and your future. Success isn't necessarily measured in money. It can be holistic.
And dump it somewhere, while you're gone. I need the car. Well, let's get to work. Look at the moon... It has a beautiful reflection in the water.
I hope it's not upstairs. Let's split up. Hey, look at that. The crevasse isn't above us. It's below us.
We're trying to get them out. A huge air operation had been launched. There were the First and 508 Paras Infantry Regiments. WENDY R. ANDERSON PENTAGON SENIOR OFFICIAL TRAINER 7 Special Forces Groups were included, over 15 different air groups. This was a major operation, and it would last for weeks and weeks. Within the first hour, one of the Chinooks was hit by a Taliban surface-to-air missile.
- What am I doing? - What is this shit? No. Hey. This car doesn't have any plates. No, because it's brand-new.
She just wanted a story. Everyone seems to want something. These people are dangerous. Don't try to have it both ways. Remember, the axe doesn't mourn the tree it chops down.
Well, maybe... All right, then. Talk about anything you want. Many couples experience a decrease in passion. The problem isn't passion. Or maybe it's that there's too much of it.
We have a unique relationship. We're bound together by all these ordeals. The idea of detaching myself from him would be like tearing off a limb. What impact does violence have on your children? It has no impact on my sons, believe me.
You're young to come here. Don't lose your skin. Excuse me. Could you tell me about the church? When did it close?
Evelyn Borden. Did you know her? We all did. She was a prisoner under the church. I found the room, and it looks like a prison.
You can't swim. Yes, I can. But I'd like to try. I respect the sea. It's beautiful, indifferent, deadly.
Do you believe in the soul? If not, close your eyes. Let's say the soul exists. Where in the body would it be? If there is a soul, it must be in the brain.
But I know which one is less. The truth. The truth isn't always the most exciting version of things, or the best or the worst. It's somewhere in between. But it must be heard and not forgotten.
The truth isn't always the most exciting version of things, or the best or the worst. It's somewhere in between. But it must be heard and not forgotten. The truth will out, as they often say. It's always there.
Even if Paul Desmond wrote it, but never mind. How about "Gloomy Sunday" to liven up the crowd? Are you serious? That song's depressing. Or it's beautiful, if you have taste.
Here you go. Thank you for your time. What exactly am I looking at? A shadow on the moon. Look, it's getting bigger.
Well, I... Can you drive? Because I'm grounded, Courtney's dads are strict, and Ashley's car is old. - Not too old. - It's older than me.
Be careful! Oh, boy! Well, well, well. I love this car. It smells like new.
We can do it. We can make it. We're the ones who survive. What about the car? - It's safe.
Rosita! Get into position. I'll signal you. Will it hold? It'll hold.
You're in slippers. Good thinking. Has it occurred to you that the morgue is never on the top floor of a hospital? I notice these things. It's always in the basement, with its own elevator.
Istina, God's. But there is also nepravda. Non-truth. The weapon used by the leader. Because he knows what others don't know. Truth is what he wants it to be.
Like in the story with the ghost of Christmas past. I, uh... I believe you came back for a reason. The gun. It's on the counter.
Pass me your plate. Are you there, my friend? Good as new. Here we are, together again. Salad. Shoot, it's in the fridge.
And they transfer the data here. It's an abandoned com relay. At least some of the people in charge of Eros live here. If we want answers, we have to take this station. It's pitch-dark, barely visible on radar, but it has a residential ring, so someone's there.
I'm trying. Call me if you need anything. Anything at all. How was your day? It started with someone throwing a coffee mug at me.
He would be so proud of you right now. Okay. I see Facebook accounts, Instagram accounts, Twitter accounts. 4chan, 8chan, fucking LinkedIn, etc. And that interface masks your identity. As long as it worked.
But I don't see God. He was there, in all of us. Praise Him. Word of victory spread through the land. The people will hear that it was given by God.
Sigefrid, leave him be, he's only a priest. Come on, brother, we've got Scots to kill. Erik! We'll leave the town in your care. It's ours, and it should stay that way.
If you're on this earth, you'll know who I am. You'll know not to hurt me. The priest tells me I have you to thank for my freedom. I didn't raise the ransom. If the ransom isn't paid, she goes back to the church.
I lasted 2 hours, then went to a $2,000 spa. I hated our house. Did you really? I didn't say anything because you paid for it. You should have, it was both of ours.
I have a very important question. - She doesn't know! - Shut up, she'll remember. Hey, Mom. Remember when I was 5 and you found a videotape I couldn't live without? Tell her she's delirious, Mom!
"Her tattered sails, her damaged compass, her rotten hull "would barely allow her to face the breakers. "But that would be enough for him to flee. "It was only an hour later, as he pulled away from the dock, "that his thoughts turned to her. He imagined her alone. "She must have searched the house and found it empty.
That's between me and a lonely Eskimo. Isn't that romantic? Let's hear it for the messengers of love. If only life were all about love. But it's made up of temptations.
Isn't it romantic? Let's hear it for the messengers of love. If only life were all about love. But it's made up of temptations. It's made up of failures.
We applaud the messengers of love. If only life were all about love. But it's made up of temptations. It's made of failures. It's made of weaknesses.
But it is made up of temptations. It is made of failures. It's made up of weaknesses. You know what I'm talking about, don't you, Sister? It's made up of sins.
She was going to set them free, And draw Naseri while I could bring him down. My wife will die a terrible death and everyone will see. What's this? I have an operation that may be compromised. She needs a cleaning.
You could make a life with him if you could put your pride aside. Don't make the same mistake I did. Take the deal. That voice in your head... I think I know who it belongs to. Eleanor had the same dream as you.
I admire that kind of loyalty. What do you think of this nightclub? What do I think? Are you kidding me? She totally rocks.
And we love this place. So we'll figure something out. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Have you seen the bathtub? It's huge.
Open up, Mrs. Cho, it's the police. Come in, Mrs. Cho. It's a little early to break the door down. My son's room. It hasn't changed.
She used to make these for my father when he missed Spain. You know me well enough to know that I don't listen to anything or anyone when I'm angry. That's for sure. But yesterday, I heard a voice... and it was crystal clear. What did it say?
You know me well enough to know that I don't listen to anything or anyone when I'm angry. That's for sure. But yesterday, I heard a voice... and it was crystal clear. What did it say? It said: "Pack your bags, the whole family.
Did you ever wonder how Silas so easily found my medicine? We both have the virus. Plus, he told me that very soon, there might be a cure. Why are you crying? Sometimes I forget that... if life is full of surprises... it's also full of gifts.
But... you speak so well when it comes from the heart. Darling, your interview at the preview was incredible. That's probably why we invited you. Of course we did! It's got a million views.
No, I'm listening. You were at the rave. I don't know what you're talking about. I can't see where you are. You feel gravity without knowing how it works.
If we have the power to prevent a tragedy like this... we should, shouldn't we? You know what she called Brandt? Whispers. She said that the voice in our head that tells us to slit our wrists or take a handful of pills or jump off a building... that voice never screams. It just whispers.
You can count on me. Nice to meet you. How do you do? Do you have a key to open this door? See that drain? It goes on behind the partition. But the door is either jammed or locked.
Dorothea told me you were in Lonsdale. I'm from the Scottish Lowlands myself. Red bricks, French fry shops and all. Seriously, you should come to my place, I've got a pretty good cellar. I'm sure it's much better than mine.
- It's looking for a path. - System won't give me access. - Switch to manual. Just turn it off, okay? - How smart is this thing? - It senses air movement
You see, what you're feeling, the tormented look in your eyes, it's not coming from nowhere. And where does it come from? At the center of your being, there's a little beating heart. What, you mean my soul? Partly, the thinnest part, but it holds a special power.
Only Hermie could have a rare, incurable disease with no apparent symptoms and die in front of Equalizer. I know how much he meant to you. It's quite a blow. I really hate death. It's there, right under our noses, waiting patiently to pick us off.
- No, Mama. You can't do this! - Can you believe it? Bourbon. No ice. - How's the evening going? - It's going...
The skull was still covered in carbon, but I don't think I missed a thing. And now, go closer on the mandible. Oh, good, I see what I missed: the erosion on the mandible. It suggests a collapse of the teeth.
Angela and I were talking. She and Hodgins are thinking about having another child, and she asked about us. What, you want another one? Why would I? Our family is perfect the way it is.
- Who tried to kill you? It started at the airport. I, uh... There was a... a red sedan. It started following me.
Very powerful players. Sayed, do you know this mosque? The Aksa mosque. It's one of the most important in Sanaa. It's very distinctive.
he's probably more torn up inside than you are. Thank you. (Chuckles) No worries. Try the pizza. It's good.
She had no choice. Was gassing Caleb her punishment for trying to stop A.D.? I didn't finish my turn, so I got this. What happens to your puzzle piece? Will it be for a stranger?
"Please." Why don't you just kill me? Because I'm not like you. I'm stronger than you. My life is no longer tied to yours, and the city whose foundation you love to claim as your own... it's mine.
Your father is a simple animal. His conscience doesn't trouble him. He sleeps soundly, convinced that men are as replaceable as oxen. But he doesn't understand that his philosophy, his approach to life, can become contagious. And when it spreads, it spreads fast.
The first spanking, when the heart went on a lonely journey. When they called you whiny, poor, fat or crazy, when they made you a stranger, you drank their acid words and kept them inside you. Later, if you faced death from bombs or bullets... it wasn't with a flag. You only did it with a hat to cover your heart. You didn't stroke the weakness inside you, even though it was there.
"My parents had it, I had to have it and the same goes for cancer". People have inherited a bad lifestyle. Their environment has exposed them to a certain way of eating and living that they reproduce as adults and pass on to their children, which is why they will develop the same diseases that their parents and grandparents may have had. But this is not inevitable. Even if you have a genetic predisposition, it won't necessarily manifest itself.

What determines whether it manifests or not is also these epigenetic variables, the things you control.
And this dioxin will accumulate in his fat, in both milk and meat, and anyone who eats dairy products will get this dose of dioxin. So it spreads through the food chain. Men have no physical way of getting rid of it, but women have two. Both involve having a baby. One is for the dioxin to pass through the placenta to the child, and the other is for it to be expelled in breast milk.
Look, I'm a lawyer, and I do this all day long, so here goes. I won't fly a plane, you won't set foot in court. I know your type. You think you're so smart. You think you don't owe anybody the franchise. The wheel will turn. It always does.
I won't last another four years. It was supposed to be a week. - Poseidon left us here to die. - We still have a card to play. I didn't want to play it, but it's already been thrown.
I don't know what you're talking about. You don't? I'm gonna break you in half when I find that watch, you know that? Search the cell. It's not in here.
Which friend? He's at Patrick's. Where's your grandmother's ring? I'm such an idiot. I took it off on the way here to protect it, I didn't want it stolen, then when I looked for it on the way back, it was gone.
Just what I needed. Drink up. No need to sleep. And the battery? It was dead, but we changed it.
With your permission. The bracelet is as important as the watch. That'll teach me to be stingy. We'll find it. Where is it?
That'll teach me to be stingy. We'll find her. Where is she? Oh, don't worry. If she's here...
I bet I can swing this thing through one of the holes. Not a chance. A maneuver like that would cut it in half. This thing is sturdy as hell. I doubt it'll wobble and fall through space.
Your suit may filter a little, then your heart stops. You know a lot about how to die. Yeah, I can imagine. Fantastic. Whatever this thing is, it came from a human.
It's a living organism, so it must have constraints. What if we electrified the bridge, trying to stun it? Just listen. This thing tears through steel like tinfoil. It doesn't need air.
What if we electrify the bridge, try to stun it? Just listen. This thing tears through steel like tinfoil. It doesn't need air. It doesn't care about bullets.
Understood. When I tell you, you remove the heart. Now. Take it out now! She's out there.
Now. Take it off now! She's out there. She's coming your way! She's coming over here!
And I don't know how to tell you. Is it that bad? We said no more secrets, but I still have one. Whatever it is, it's okay. The protomolecule changed everything, except for what it didn't change.
Firearms. Cannons. Nuclear bombs. No weapon brings peace. No one knows what the protomolecule wants or what it does, but they use it anyway.
Nuclear bombs. No weapon brings peace. Nobody knows what the protomolecule wants or what it does, but they use it anyway. It's already scattered far and wide to make sure there's nothing left. It's part of the equation now.
They respect you. What exactly is your plan? Clary. She'll know it's a trap. Even a clever mouse would walk into a trap if she really wanted her cheese.
No. It was my idea to hush it up. And I approved it. I'm the Mayor. And if this impeachment process goes the way I think it's going to go, not for much longer.
No, in that hotel room, it was madness. And it reeked of sickly death. You see, you and I, we come from the slums. So I know you know what smell I'm talking about. And there was a puddle, of blue-brown slime, in the center of the bed and it had dripped, onto the floor.
Clearly, they've been used. To observe the evolution of the infection on a human host. You infected them and watched them die? We watched the progress. The protomolecule is the first evidence of life outside the solar system, and it came without instructions.
Please. Tell him about the reactor. When I arrived, the power had already been cut. The protomolecule was frozen around the reactor core. It was starving.
62 resets. The best we can do. Good Lord. Oh, boy. If this thing blows it could set off the other bombs before the Nauvoo arrives.
I can't find it. Holden, we've lost Eros on the radar. The station just disappeared. Noted, Tycho. It's off our radar too.
Eros heads for Earth. By himself. What can you tell me about it? The chrysalis is transforming. It's becoming.
It's too important to destroy now. - We'll hide it. - Where will we hide it? Outside. She'll be safe.
This order wouldn't have made any difference. The acceleration was making my body so heavy that even moving became difficult. EMERGENCY STOP It was bad, but that wasn't the worst of it. Because the most dangerous thing about a high-gravity surge is that if it lasts too long, it'll kill you.
But ask yourself this question... Does it make sense that Mars would want to test its cutting-edge technology on a contaminated area of its own creation? I suppose not. What if this biological weapon wasn't a weapon after all? What if it's the cause, which we can't yet understand, of the Eros movement?
And reshape the solar system. My engine will give us the means to finally free ourselves from Earth. And build a new world for ourselves. That's the wonderful and terrible thing about technology. It changes everything.
And they transfer the data here. It's an abandoned com relay. At least some of the people in charge of Eros live here. If we want answers, we have to take this station. It's pitch-dark, barely visible on radar, but it has a residential ring, so someone's there.
I've executed mutineers. My father always said, "The man who passes the sentence must wield the sword," and I've tried to live up to those words. But I will not punish sons for the sins of their fathers, and I will not take away their home from a family that has owned it for centuries.
We had given them a meaning to life. So start again. Are you leaving? On a beautiful line. Wasn't it beautiful?
I'll do whatever you want. Just don't take me back there! Give me your money! I have so much to teach you, Bruce. But your pain... it's keeping you from being who I need you to be.
You think you can control it... you can't. You think it's part of you, but it doesn't have to be. Do you know why you were so easily beaten? Your rage, Bruce. It blinds you.
You think it's part of you, but it doesn't have to be. Do you know why you were so easily beaten? Your rage, Bruce. It blinds you. You try to control it, yet it's controlled you since that night.
Slice off the little finger of your left hand. Should I ask him to eat it? He would if I told him. Put a bandage on it. You see, Bruce, the pain of our memories can hurt us, but it also defines us.
- K-9s, stay with me. - Harvey, by 5 p.m., Union Station will be packed. Even if we evacuate, thousands will be infected. Not if we find the bomb. But I'm guessing it won't be planted in the middle.
What do you see? A rather realistic sort of "Temple of Doom". They've got a box. God of speed, soon your enemies will fall and you'll return to Earth again. It looks like the one that contained the Stone.
Come on. I love you. I love you more than anything. That part hasn't changed. It never will.
Show your face. I want to kill you so badly, and I will. But you'll have to live a little longer. Long enough to watch Iris die. The blade didn't touch your organs, but it shattered your collarbone.
Cisco told me, or showed me, that you hadn't been on a team for a long time. And I know I'm the reason. Iris's death shouldn't have separated me from you. I feel... it should have brought me closer.
I feel like Mystic Falls isn't as safe as it used to be. Tell me about it. Is it an antique Tupperware? Elena, Bonnie and I made our time capsule when we were 11 and buried it here. I can't believe it's still here.
One. Two. Three. The bell is corrupt! It will destroy us all!
Let me explain what you've become. You had a powerful, traumatic awakening, as I did. My true self awoke at the moment of my death. Accompanied by hell and eternal suffering. I'm as much a part of my psychic dimension as it is of me.
- I'm not surprised. Why are you so surprised? You're mortal. Your death is inevitable. But it doesn't have to happen today.
The worst possible place to take a siphon. Easily the worst. There's practically... magic in the walls. See? Okay, it's, it's not practically in the walls.
Crap. Come on, keep moving! This way, this way. The boiler room? There's a horror movie reference in there, but it escapes me.
You must force Katherine to break the spell. I'm on it. Do you need anything? You're a glue pot. The funny thing about the dagger of my bones is that it sends me to hell, but it can't keep me there...
But not without a broken heart. In death, we find peace. But suffering is the price of life. Like love, it's how we know we're alive. Do you think she exists?
Even after our long and happy life together, Damon is afraid he'll never see Stefan again, that he'll never find peace. But I know he's wrong. For there is peace. It exists in everything we hold dear.
Which formula? You need to know how much of each ingredient you're using. If you get it wrong, it could be fatal. The professor was the only one who knew the formula. He liked to say that the only place it could be found was in his head.
Uriel... I know, I know, I know. It's a lot to take in. I don't... I don't understand, Azrael's blade, it should have destroyed you, not sent you to hell.
- It's my rehab. - So Lucious Lyon wins again. - He killed Frank Gathers and I can prove it. I just need more time. You're off the case because it's closed.
I could feel it on him... And a light was shining, from over there. - What kind of light? - I don't know what kind. Very bright. Was it coming from the cottage?
- We're still looking for the weapon used to stun the lady. - I can see that. - Bring me a seal bag. This bat needs to go to the lab for analysis. It's part of a pair, in fact.
- Not really, no. - I know your boss. I know your colleagues and I know your customers. I can find out anything I want about your wife, your kids, your pets. And I can easily make your life even worse than it already is.
Let someone else do it. They don't know what I'd do. He says he can see into my soul. Well, I've seen into his. It's rotten.
The case, you know? The dreadful Huxley. Sometimes there's no justice. Fortune favors the bold, Harry. As far as I can see, it smiles on hypocritical bigots.
Amateur work by a copycat beginner. Hey! I wouldn't underestimate Seth Wright. We're dealing with kids here, Kimble. Overprotected Gen-Yers who wouldn't know a real story if it bit them in the ass.
I can't believe one of our guys stole evidence. I just don't think a cop would. Same here. - The list isn't complete. - Yes, it is.
I didn't realize it until just now, when I saw her photo, but I know Isabella. Only by her first name. How do you know her? We both go to the same association that... helps us with our gambling addiction. It protects the anonymity of its members.
No, she doesn't care about Blanche. She stole her spotlight. Use that metaphor. I don't need innuendo, Bob, I need a good script. Bette, this is today's scene, she's good, and Joan loves her.
The black rider of the Apocalypse, I call on you. Horseman, finish it! Death wins in the end. The box... it's going to explode again.
I was on the verge of concluding the ceremony. Now I have to wait for the next astral phase. Where are we with, um... the thing and the other thing? The entity has claimed its first confirmed victim, and it's loose.
How did it go? Yes. Thanks to your movers, I didn't have to do a thing. And Pop, this house... - Is it nice?
Yes. Thanks to your movers, I didn't have to do a thing. And Pop, this house... - How is it? - It's beautiful.
It'll be neither. Tell you what, you do the right thing, or we'll make you. - How's that? - You know what I mean. If you threaten to attack, the meeting's over. The meeting's over.
A guy comes in and buys a pack of cereal and a pack of beer. He pays with two dollars and this coin. I knew right away what it was. 25 cents, George Washington. I said to my dad, "This coin is rare. It's worth four dollars."
You know, when you're someone like me, people tell you what you want to hear and I need someone who doesn't. Okay, but I'm not an inspector. I've read your file. You have all the qualifications to be an inspector and more, so... Look, I really appreciate what you're trying to do... all this technology... but it doesn't solve cases, the police do.
- Nothing. We just... We'll start again, Joanie. You don't even need this scene. It seems unnecessary.
I fell apart. Howard was my foundation. Finally, I... I took over and... We moved on. But all that pain, he repressed it, we... we masked it, it poisoned the mind.
Give me a few days. I'll find you a safe place. Please, Polly. I can't lose you again. It's a change from the sardine can where we used to work. I wasn't sure you'd take me up on my offer. - I wasn't sure it was real.
My dad hired Jughead's dad to trash the drive-in. Given recent events, it's not inconceivable that he hired him for other jobs, like going after Jason to get revenge on the Blossoms. I want to help you with your investigation. I want the truth, whatever it is.
He never had the guts. But you, you're a Blossom, a real one. One last word before you go out. Your grandmother's ring. It's not in my jewelry box and Polly doesn't have it either.
That "Danny is a terrorist" was my plan B. Which you wouldn't have quoted if the lady in the niqab hadn't testified. You know what I think? The law should be pure, like physics. It should be better than the media and politics.
Which you wouldn't have quoted if the lady in the niqab hadn't testified. You know something? The law should be pure, like physics. It should be better than the media and politics. It should exist without the notion of race.
A very interactive museum. Someone slept in the bed. Pulp's still fresh. Sheriff Greene, we found a suitcase buried out front. It belongs to...
Who's there? - Good afternoon, sir. My name is Adi... First day, first idea. I hope it's a good one, or it'll be your last.
Your eyes will do. No need for a well! Pure architecture... It's like magic. It creates fiction... It creates unexpected places.
No need for a well! Pure architecture... It's like magic. It creates fiction... It creates unexpected places. And it provokes unexpected conversations.
Pure architecture... It's like magic. It creates fiction... It creates unexpected places. And it provokes unexpected conversations. It generates passion, love, romance...
Rather disoriented, I'd say. There's a guard outside. That should help you sleep peacefully, without any worries. I wonder if you could come and open my window? It's a bit hard, and it was so hot last night.
So, what do you think? Of course I was terrified. Pain is strange. A coyote kills our dog, we scrape our knee when we fall off our bike, we see a loved one die, and then pain suddenly appears, it's there, it's palpable, and we look like fools in the eyes of others.
Because I believe in you And I believe in the world you want to create. But the world you want to build won't happen so quickly. Probably not in a single lifetime. How can we make sure your vision endures? After we break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?
If you can hold out for twenty minutes or so, you'll see how powerful it is. I can't wait to introduce you to the new Rebecca. The question is... will you have the courage to kill her? My army of the dead will make the world a better place. It will correct the imbalances of recent wars.
Got a sec? There's something I want to show you. What? No. No. Does it work?
- Fine, thank you. This call is like good news-bad news. I played the song for Maddie. She doesn't think it's really for her.
Yes, he's handsome! He's not ugly. This is the kind of conversation you can have after the episode. Grace, did you bring the TV? Yeah, it's in my bag.
You make a lovely couple. - So you have a gun. - Of course we do. Has it been stolen? No, it's in the safe.
The gazelle searches for its daily ration... The zebras continue to cross the savannah in search of young shoots. I'll be back for my car tomorrow. I'll take a cab home. I'll take another one tomorrow. Leave my car where it is.
Yes. WE HAVE DELETED YOUR POST BECAUSE IT BREACHES OUR RULES. What'll you have? Chicken soup? Yes, but it's not on the menu.
It works. I just gave the remote to Supergirl. Only she can turn it on. We should call the WD. Let them know Supergirl can use it if she needs it.
And blood... was smeared all over it. Mike, could that radio have contained a bomb that could cause that kind of damage? Yes. But I didn't look inside. If the bomb was hidden there, and if it had exploded while you were checking the body...
Three people were injured, and a leading member of our forensic team, Haley William, was killed. Make no mistake, when one of our own is hit, we don't take it lightly. In fact, when we attack the police, we attack the fundamental order of our society and the safety of this city. And whether this violence was ideologically inspired or an assault on our civilization, it is tantamount to an act of terrorism.
- What is it? What's wrong? We need to call the bomb squad immediately. I have to thank you anyway. The info you gave us on the radio helped. Are you sure it was housing our bomb?
Besides the way you flirt with that door? I'm wearing silk, Sol. Not cotton, not flannel. Silk. Nature's sexiest fabric. It clings in all the best places.
I'm wearing silk, Sol. Not cotton, not flannel. Silk. The sexiest natural fabric. It clings in all the best places. It clings everywhere, actually.
I hear the cry of pain of the mother wolf giving birth to change. You know we're chasing someone? We'd better stop. The gauge is unreliable. It reads halfway, and I'm out of fuel.
Assume, baby. Monarchy. So we're not the first Brakebills students to go to Fillory or take the throne. It's a good question for history class, but if the beast reaches the fountain now and dries it up completely, no more magic in Fillory. - If it dies there...

I love you. Your hot dogs didn't get me through my childhood. You did! That's why this locomotive decorated as a hot dog seems like a joke! Take my hand, son. It's strong from opening cans.
There is Protomolecule on the Ganymede Station. There are no errors in the data. The Protomolecule signal appeared at about the same time when Earth and Mars started shooting at each other over the Ganymede Station. And it's hard to believe it's a coincidence. We know that the Protomolecule learns, that it never stops evolving.
Come on. No interference here, I see. The vault is secure. So, does your box move? Can it go wherever it wants?
Do you think your bacon sandwich loves you? What is it and what was it doing on Earth? Well, there were burn marks on the concrete where we found it. The shuttle could have left it. The puddle, what did it look like?
Super-intelligent space oil. No, it's part of the ship. A fluid that becomes what it needs. Seriously? But it spent time being a puddle, what changed?
See? The puddle has found a passenger. The remnant of a drop from a liquid spaceship. A single tear, alone in a strange world. And one day, it finds someone who wants to escape.
The puddle has found a passenger. The remnant of a drop from a liquid spaceship. A single tear, alone in a strange world. And one day, it found someone who wanted to escape. Not just a passenger, more than a passenger, it found a pilot, so it ate it.
Why wog in a store to steal medicine? - Built-in mask. - No. He fell on the floor. Why would he do that? He didn't slip or trip, no one around him, he wasn't pushed, and he was grabbing his head like it was going to explode.
- Maybe I did. - What happened next? This thing came out. It was covered in leaves and moss and mud, and it had vines for arms, and it grabbed him. - It grabbed him right here.
- She caught it right here. - What did you do? I shot her, but it didn't do anything. And then... and then I ran, because you I thought - she was after me.
I've just started the 2nd book, and so far there's nothing about mirrors... as portals or gateways to anywhere. So if you're worried about me, don't be. Yes, I'm really worried about you. We're the only people who have seen this thing. If we don't find a way to get rid of it, it'll find a way to get to us.
I wasn't going to wait for the skull guy to come after us. You shouldn't have come here alone. You shouldn't have come looking for me. Eve... You don't owe anybody anything, and I don't know what you're trying to prove, but you're... I don't want to prove anything. I want to kill this thing before it kills us, we can't stay here;
He also saved me. What's the matter? He's getting better. And Eve. I hope this thing is doing what we think it's doing.
Come on, darling. This is it. This is it. We met here to settle our differences over the key. Oh, that. We decided it couldn't end up in your hands.
You'll find your way back to sadness, no matter how far you get from it. Well, that's comforting. Is there anything else you want? Everything I've ever wanted, I've gotten. Magic is real, and it can fix everything except what I need.
He must have escaped from the Paramount studio. I love this dress. Of course you do. It's the one from your dirty magazine, dingo. It suits you!
They will never know what their purpose on earth was. They live and they die and they go to sleep for eternity in a pile of mud. And here I am, in the rain, literally emptying my guts with a bag full of a dead woman's clothes. My life has to change. It will change... won't it?
It was great. I don't know if it was great. I've only been here a few months, but the city is... - Careful, that's my home. - It's expensive.
You don't? Everything I've learned about you proves otherwise. Do you like my hair? No. It's really horrible, actually.
No ideas, no creativity. You're a failure. What got into you? It's my hernia. It exploded.
I'm thinking about taking that advertising job in Seattle. Oh, don't do that. Fuck you, Kyle! And fuck commedia dell'arte. Man, my sleeveless dress came in, and it's just perfect.
Good grief. It's a 1940s debutante dress, straight out of Bonwit Teller. How did I miss this? I'd love to keep this dress in a box. Wrapped in paper for eternity. It's so beautiful.
You're a woman who built a business from nothing. You moved the needle to leave your mark on the world, where it wasn't. If you give up... you're just a girl in old clothes. This suit is good. It'll sell.
Going out? With the brush, you go very slowly. My father's church is still in my name. What about it? It remains empty.
My father's church is still in my name. What about it? It remains empty. I called the lawyer, he checked. Anyway, it's mine.
So, please, Marcel. If there's a part of you that still cares about me, help me. For all we've been to each other, for all we've shared, I beg you to let my brother go. What if I say no? You know better than anyone that my family always gets what they want.
I'm here now. Take Riley and the others to the mess and tell them we'll take them to their villages in the morning. Where is it? We don't have the machine. It didn't survive the landing?
It's not a gift, it's a habit. You'll fall into it. I'm afraid of heights. You're probably wondering why I asked you here. Whatever the reason, Sire, I'm sure it's a good one.
- You thought I was one. You didn't want this technology to fall into the hands - of an unknown Director. - I didn't. But now it's totally out of control, and for that, I'm sorry.
- than software that makes you die. - That may be so. But I have something you'll never have... a soul... that will live on long after I'm gone. How can you be sure I don't have one? If a soul doesn't come from your flesh and blood or my ones and zeros, then it must come from somewhere else, from a place unrelated to our physical envelopes.
You don't understand. Aida... No army can protect him from the forces Madame Hydra has unleashed. Does it have anything to do with... that machine Leopold's working on? It will kill everyone Fitz cares about.
You shouldn't be here. I told you to wait for me at the inn. I've been waiting all day. It's a complicated situation. No, it isn't.
If Lydia Quigley is attacked, she will respond with all the power at her disposal! So think carefully... before you use this dying girl as a weapon. "The contagion was Mary's reward," "because disease spares neither rich nor poor" "It lives on when the sport is over"
I don't see how this concerns me. Margaret Wells is behind this. You could have had her flogged and deported but you let her go free. Justice can't concern itself with a pointless vendetta between 2 madams. What exactly is justice looking at when it asks me to kidnap an innocent girl?
♪ In reverie ♪ Go back! Do not cross the threshold of the Moorish pimp and the sworn madam of London. Your lechery will confound you. It will cost you your soul!
Harriet? Are you in? Yes. Ask him for 4 guineas, see if he ticks. And get Repton to come and get his goat, or it'll end up on the plate.
Tangled Up in Blue. Blue Oyster Cult. Blue Monday. That was the color of our car. Bought on Craigslist. It smelled of maple syrup.
If I let myself go too much, I won't be able to get up again. I'm relegated to my room. For thirteen days. My door is open. It doesn't close anymore.
They'll have to lift the embargo or the euro will collapse. An Aunt has run away from Needham Red Center. The Eyes will catch up with her. She crossed the border. She gave an interview to the Toronto Star.
My wife died in a car accident, Mr. Ross. She was a perfectly healthy young woman of 39. She died rushing from work to pick up our children. What does this have to do with smoking? It shouldn't matter, but this company doesn't care about helping people. It's about making money.
"She shall be called woman, who was taken from man. "To his wife. "The man and the woman were naked. "They felt no shame. May God bless this union. And may it be fruitful.
Are you going for a walk? I don't want to keep my partner waiting. Of course you don't. I wanted to give you a gift, to thank you for your sincerity. It's been invaluable.
The doors! Don't you have a door? Until you've lived without them, you don't know how great they are. I'd kill for a door! And if it had a lock...
Insider lock mode. Why are they locking us in? The only way to catch this thing is to trap it in there. - With us? - We don't even know where it went.
Why are they locking us in? The only way to catch this thing is to trap it in there. - With us? - We don't even know where it went. Or where it didn't go.
The only way to catch this thing is to trap it in there. - With us? - We don't even know where it went. Or where it didn't go. It could still be here.
You're telling me that Jeremiah Danvers, former DEO agent and missing father of Alex and Kara, is back with the news that our enemy has developed a nuclear fusion explosive using Kara's supernatural heat vision and they're going to loosen it on National City and kill us all? Is this place bombproof? You could trace the heat signature of Kara's vision. Okay, fine, if the bomb is primed, then yes, I'll be able to pinpoint its location before it goes off.
The horsemen of the apocalypse! Jennifer is in 1922. It's Cassie's watch. Clothing stops paradoxes. But it doesn't stop them.
Now this thing, takes everything dark and twisted in me and uses it against me. It used it against my wife and ended up taking away everything I ever cherished. So you have every reason to want to wipe this thing off the face of the earth. But let's say we find that thing today, Elijah. It's going to take everything you want to keep buried, it's going to use it and make you do exactly what it wants you to do.
And it's the same thing that took my wife... then it took me... now I think it's trying to take my best friend. Was this your plan, Vince? Invite me here, confront me? Whatever this thing promised you - it's not going to deliver.
Whatever that thing promised you - it's not going to deliver. - You are mistaken. The Hollow rewards those who are faithful. Maybe if you'd done what it asked, things would be different.
For me. For Cami. For all of us. Is that what she told you, Will? That's what she showed me, Vince.
Take it back from what? From him. Vampires. For 5 years, we said nothing. Watching you rule this town like you own it.
It means the Hollow. The Hollow is coming. The Hollow wants power. The kind that comes from sacrifice. This thing is dark, angry, powerful.
Yes, and I didn't tell them that. When you leave here, you need to go home, pack, and find a way to get out of town quickly and quietly, with Hope. What are you talking about? The Hollow sensed your little girl's power. And she's going to want that power back.
I don't think I have a choice. You've outgrown yourself. I'm inclined to accept. It's a shame these lovely sheets will soon be red with blood. Violence must be seen as a last resort, or it will weaken our position.
This thing has followers everywhere. They've infiltrated the entire city. If they get the other bones before us... They'll resurrect that monstrosity. And it will come for all of us.
I spoke to my girlfriend there. She didn't say anything. The riot hadn't started. Aren't you listening? It started yesterday.
- Why should he have it? - Just look at him. That vermin. He insisted on burying De La Warr before anyone else could find it. It's safe under the ground until he uses it.
Well, dear? Farlow was scribbling intently when I arrived, but when I looked, the page was blank. He must have been using artichoke ink or something similar. Artichoke ink? It seems invisible, without a flame under the paper.
- What a planet. - What planet? So, Lord Sutcliffe is an alien? - He might be. - Because the creature is alien. It seems to produce fuel useful for interstellar travel.
- (THE DIAPASON VIBRES) - Time to pay. - What's that noise? That tower, it was at the back of the building.
Then imagine an identical ball in space, racing against the Earth ball, with the same force applied. Which ball would win the race? No need to raise your hand to speak here, Albert. Really, Albert? Well... the ball in space would win because it's moving in a vacuum.
Just because a guy buys a lady tickets to London doesn't mean he's her boyfriend. You know I'm the one who put them in touch? You know, I like your combination. Thanks, man. It's cool, huh?
I never cursed it. I didn't curse him. I was just joking. My brother used to tell us we had to cross 6000 km of ocean to have a better life. Now that it's here, he's not here to enjoy it.
What have you brought me, woman? You know, they'll take you away. They'll strip you down and they'll see the mark. It's just a mark. It's always been there, ever since I was a baby.
You know, they'll take you. They'll strip you down and they'll see the mark. It's just a mark. It's always been there, ever since I was a baby. It doesn't mean anything.
I think I have. Then we're almost there. Greg, the van broke down. It's okay, Dad. All it has to do is drive.
Look at his Smurf cock. Smurf cock? They're blue. It's bluish. It's small and droopy.
But before that, we could find someone to talk to if we wanted to. He'd have cookies for us and... Now it's, "Fuck you, inmate. I'm going to ruin your life because I've got the power." It's as if human kindness has rebelled, and I doubt it's coming back anytime soon.
We're up to 600,000 views on YouTube. But what are they saying? The comments are mostly positive. "Down with the system." "Access their requests." That sort of thing. You can't deny cruelty when it's shown on Facebook.
Because we won. We fought back and we won. And you're a big blind jerk. And you're a... I lost my humanity in the mire for a moment, but it's slowly coming back.
I have a ship to seal. I'll drive. The end is near. Listen to me this time. The end is coming, and it's coming fast.
Finally! What's wrong? Looks like we're going to need my people after all. There's a storm coming. When it hits, we need to be on the right side of the door.
They were just...knocked out. Are you suggesting she's not dangerous? Not at all, sir. I'm gathering as much information as I can. If you can't tell me what it is, what it wants, how can you stop it?
He follows me. Buddy. Did he drop my bike? - He dropped the bike. - It jumped.
I found you... you. You're my compassion... my best self... my angel. I'm bound to you... by such strong ties. I find you... so good... so gifted... so lovely. A fervent... and solemn passion, conceived in my heart... and it leans toward you and draws you to my center.
You are my compassion... my best self... my angel. I'm bound to you... by such strong ties. I find you... so good... so gifted... so lovely. A fervent... and solemn passion, conceived in my heart... and it leans toward you and draws you to my center. And source of life, it... coils your existence.
Just imagine cocks. With one, you can only shake yourself, but with three, suddenly, you've got six people fucking. Which is more powerful? I think your metaphor literally makes no fucking sense. It doesn't have to.
Pigeon pie, pate, and a bottle of sherry. Cheers. Life... Life's a big wheel, isn't it? It goes round and round.
Corrections are needed. There is a way out, and it's difficult, but necessary. As Taleb says, "Become strong, or die." Once done, the city will face the challenge and emerge stronger. Or it will disappear.
- It was Ferrous Corp. - Why would they do it? To weaken their rivals. I guarantee you, out there, it's going to turn into an all-out war... If it hasn't already started.
Remember how I told you about that bubble of non-space and that it wasn't much bigger than the station? - Yes - I know because I sent radar signals to find the edges of the bubble. And? It's shrinking...
And? It shrinks... She's collapsing in on herself. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. When we arrived, it was 3km in diameter.
It shrinks... She's collapsing in on herself. My goodness. When we arrived, it was 3km in diameter. Now it's less than 2.5.
And you're an idiot. The matrix has been checked. All is well. Whatever the anomaly, it's real. The strangest thing is that it persists, with no apparent source.
I thought I was there for a second. We had traveled 600 years into the past. Just as I suspected. The station called Pollux-4 is no longer there. Or should I say, it's not there yet.
The area is crawling with federal agents. You'll never see your ship again. Wait a minute, I know how to fix that. We've got a time machine up ahead. Does it have a power source?

Where's Turrence? Do you think you can sell it to the workers? I'm sure I can convince them - that it's their best choice. - You surprise me, I must say. Your reputation may have preceded you, it was far from reality.
Yeah. Because we betrayed him. Crap. I must be getting old. My memory's not what it used to be.
To begin with, what if you made the right choice? This is the right choice. Did you mean it when you turned your back on us, when you turned your back on your wife and kid? No, man. That neurotoxin, it messes with your mind.
At the start of this war, I wanted to let the corporations destroy each other. But now it's time to choose sides. Does this mean you're coming back? Unless you've given up my room. Lucky for you, it's available.
Affirmative. Tactical nuclear device. It seems to be aimed at the base. What about the shuttle? It hasn't taken off.
I do bear responsibility - for Nyx's fate. - but you didn't kill her. You didn't give that order. And I think her death grieves you as much as it grieves us.
I didn't know about Praimfaya. You can tell them. I never meant to kill anyone. The sword doesn't care what you wanted. It just cuts.
Crap. Well, that makes six. The Martians have probably turned this into a bottle game. I could use a drink myself. The atmosphere above the impact site is much more corrosive than it should be, and it's getting worse.
Sir, we've just received urgent information from the United Nations. Apparently, they've caught wind of an OPA plot to plant a bomb in your transport. All traffic in and out of this airspace is forbidden until further notice. Who sent this notification? It came directly from the office of Undersecretary Avasarala, sir.
Madam, you and I are fortunate to spend our lives in positions of great privilege and power. Our actions affect the lives of millions... billions... Entire planets in ways that few can understand. The Eros experiment has never meant an attack on Earth, and I hope you know that. I also hope you understand what the protomolecule is and what it means for humanity.
Gear up and go. Roger that. Jim, I'm not going with you. Jim, I'm not going with you. If the protomolecule was here, it could be in 50 other places.
That's not my gun. Whose is it? I don't know, I found it. Where? Well... I was waiting for the bus early this morning, and I... I threw a piece of gum, and there it was...
Go back to class. The serial number matches a gun sold in '89, in Indiana. Looks like someone's been playing hockey-with it, ever since. - Does it work?
I really do. But when you look at the evidence logically... This will show that my client didn't fire the gun that killed that poor girl. We just found the murder weapon. It was in another kid's room.
This is a public emergency, and we need to think outside the box. The last thing I need is the federal commission wringing my neck. So, we're going to sit back and let these kids kill each other on their own turf. Come on, you know there's a middle ground between doing nothing and this. Why not try to stop the worst offenders who perpetuate this violence before it happens?
Even if the recipe is the same, it's the touch that makes the difference in the end. Each hand has its own taste, and, as a result, a different result. Homeland is one of the most precious things there is. It's your parents, your children, your most cherished possession. It's irreplaceable.
"Thus pass the empires." Thanks, Wags. You've given this a lot of thought. Do you have a place of your own? If humanity were to be rebuilt, it wouldn't be in my image.
Stop him! If the law gives me the power, yes. If not, someone has to work to change the law. Robert Kennedy said, "Every society has the criminals it deserves."
He's something of a prodigy. If Axe is wading into something, Taylor is there with flippers and snorkel. It's time, no, long past time, to turn your charitable arm into a permanent foundation. Properly piloted, it will leave the mark of your generosity in history, alongside Carnegie, Vanderbilt.
Why does everything have to be a scam? When Armageddon comes, the doors will be closed. It's a good idea, a safeguard. The end may come sooner than we think. It may already be here.
You've changed your story. I suggest a new chapter to your story, in which you are the co-conspirator rather than the accused. What story? Sandicot's story. I tell it to you, and in return you tell me if it's true, which it is.
Don't try to stop me. I can do this. You know I'm crazy when I'm high. I heard a lot of noise coming from your room last night. And since I know the bat is dead, because it had a heart attack on my pillow,
Hey, that's a New York guy right there. - New York is gone. - No, it hasn't. I know that's the rumor. It took a hit, but it's still going.
You wouldn't be referring to a government missile silo - by any chance? - What makes you think that? Your jacket. It says you've been working
You see that window over there, Percy says in his notes that he thinks the killer escaped through it. Why didn't she hear it? I don't know, sir. A remote control. I wonder what it controls.
Understood. Raven says the black rain is coming soon. She's right about that. I used to love rain. Now it terrifies me.
You know that fundraiser at my hospital we're going to this weekend? Oh, right. That party. What's with the cough? I hope it's not contagious, because I really want to get dressed up and talk to complete strangers.
Their whole theology was based on the end of the world. I have bad news, Abby. The black rain is here. It's worse than we thought. It burns on contact.
I've got bad news, Abby. The black rain is here. It's worse than we thought. It burns on contact. It kills.
It's not safe yet. What have we done? It took courage for you to be out there with us today, now facing grave danger and tragedy. On the Ark, such rain was just a dream. Now it's a nightmare, because we know it can change every minute and kill us, as it did 18 of our brothers and sisters, whom we honor today among them, Erin, Samuel and Louis.
- He's not a war hero. - He's a war criminal. Hannah Wells, an FBI agent, tells me she has evidence against Peter MacLeish. Any news on the key card? It gives access to room 7 on the eighth floor of the PLC building.
Blood pressure is not rising. - Ayo. - Ayo, wait. 93 over 62. It's rising.
I'm deleting the background now! I tried to save you. Save me? Save me? You're the reason my life is the way it is.
That's... that's what I was going to say earlier. Thank you. And there's really no reason And there's really no reason for us to sit at home alone when I have... this amazing Pennsylvania beer. Did you just go buy it? I hear it's pretty good.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - Wait for what? It's this door, but the handle is different. What do you mean, different? It's not there anymore?
I want to know forever! I want to know deliverance! Syphillis. The big pox. For a while, I covered the rash and became quite artistic with makeup, but now... now she's got it on her head.
Tell us about your emergency. How do you know? - You really have an emergency? - I can feel Sloane's anger. She's burning up.
How about you? No, I haven't. I've got it. Those are my colors. And it's on sale.
Nothing too invasive. In a controlled environment to study your psychopathy. What's in it for me? The time machine, of course. Do you know where it is?
You know how I am. I hate to miss a party. You want the time machine. You know me so well. But as you know, it's under lock and key.
And the time machine? Wells was able to bring it back. Remotely? Yes, he's hooked it up to computers now. But it was empty.
This monster isn't David. It's some kind of parasite, you know? Another consciousness inside him. What does it mean? This thing... buried itself in David's brain when he was a child. certainly since he was a baby, and it's been there, feeding off him all this time.
What does it mean? This thing... buried itself in David's brain when he was a child. certainly since he was a baby, and it's been there, feeding off him all this time. -The memories. -The memories... exactly. Every time David sees this thing, or realizes it exists, it makes him forget.
She rewrites her memory. Is that why we can't see her? I think so, and I think it makes us forget too. I mean, the power of this thing The power comes from her, not from David?
She's an excellent assistant. Unfortunately, I can't give you a preview. The painting is on its way from Austria. But the sale is tomorrow. She's not going to the sale.
Not a thing. That's just as well. Because we've got a problem. The paint isn't here yet. It won't arrive until just before the sale.
Not sure. What time is it? My watch is gone. Can you see it? It's got to be here somewhere.
Let's retrace your steps. That's right, my footsteps. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I've got it. I'd hate for it not to be here when you find my body.
I'm a terrible person. Everything I put you through. Liv. Spoiler alert. This letter, it says good old Major loved you more than anyone.
And the good news doesn't stop there. This is me. That version of me, small business owner, amateur lounge singer, that guy who feels lucky every time you walk through the door. Is Major going to get his memory back? She disappears slowly, at first, then completely, and a few days later she...
- Yes. Turns out Blaine was lying the whole time. He never lost his memory? Just for a day or two. So, I'm guessing she came back and he was fine, he just kept playing.
Pitying the bird, they set it free. Shall we begin? A few days later, on a snowy night, a young woman in white knocked on their door and asked for shelter. The snow lasted for days. When it stopped, the young woman asked if she could live with them.
You can tell me it's none of my business, but why live underground when you've got a working rocket? Do you plow the ground or stab it? You know this is stupid, don't you? We'll all be dead before anything grows. The Earth survived Praimfaya once, it'll do it again.
- I know... - I know who you are... Wanheda. You helped my people find the bunker. - Thank you for that. - And you gave the flame to an unworthy king, who said it was destroyed.
Of course you want to talk. And the Azgeda alliance is surrounding it. None of your people will return until we have an agreement. This war is inevitable. If it hasn't already happened, it's because Lexa ordered it.
Then we should force her. Then she won't be protecting anyone. Bellamy will find a way. The black rain is keeping the clans under cover for now. But when it stops, and they find out what your people have done...
What about them? Do we just save ourselves? Clarke, if the Nightblood works, we need to get you back to Polis, them too. We get as many people in as we can before the death wave hits. If your mother can turn us all into Nightbloods, we'll just have to stand here until she passes.
How do you choose? We've already chosen. Clarke's list. It's always been our best chance at survival. And I know where it is.
Out of the ashes ... we rise again. Can you hear that? There are 340 km between Polis and the island. According to the latest drone data, the wave is accelerating. If we don't take off at least 20 minutes before it arrives, the electromagnetic charge of the pyroclastic cloud will cut the rocket's avionics, so it won't fly.
I've got you. And he gets the hug. - Did you choose the machine? - I did. It's in the lab, where it needs to...
Have you forgotten that her agent status was revoked? I haven't forgotten that, for the plea deal I worked with Laurel Hitchin who kept her out of jail After she shot your Attorney General. You don't want to revisit the past, So dwelling on this the loss of her badge was a stain on Elizabeth's name and reputation, for which you are ultimately responsible. Your presence in her life transformed her into what she is today.
Try to find a photo of Adolf as a baby. You look at it and say: "Drown that creature! Go to the river and wedge it under a rock. If you don't, I will. Seriously, she's looking at me.
Can you tell me where you are? What's happening to me? I promise, I'll tell you everything, but I have to do it in person. Roman, look in your pocket. There's a coin, it's very special.
Dr. Wilson? The repair went well. You repaired what you had damaged? I fixed what I damaged. And your esophageal tumor is with the medical waste, where it belongs.
They're drilling through the wall. It's faint, but I recognize the sound. I'm not even going to ask why. There's a chance all that dust could foul the press. If it stops, it'll alert the guards if it goes off.
Okay, fine. Do as I say, and do it quickly. Use the screwdriver to remove the access panel from this old generator. Kid, what's the plan? This old pump was added to use electricity, but basically, it used human energy.
And you really think it's the Sword of Fire? I thought Father destroyed it during my rebellion so I couldn't use it against him. Father said HE destroyed it. Apparently, he just hid it in plain sight. But it's so small and so... not flamboyant.
Apparently, he just hid it in plain sight. But it's so small and so... unflamboyant. That's because you're the only one, my light-bearer, who can ignite it. What am I supposed to do, dip her in Whisky and strike a match? The last time it ignited, you were angry, so think of your Father, it should work.
I'm perfectly fine. Yes, that's what Uriel was trying to tell me. Just before he died, he whispered in my ear, "The room is here." I thought it made no sense, but... it explains why the sword didn't work. It wasn't complete.
Curiosity is a bad habit. I still don't get it. It also killed a lot of ancient Greeks, when Pandora had to open that box full of death, plague, and other things.
You have this needle inserted into his brain... - Told you. I've got the needle. - What if you don't? What if I slip and it goes into...
- They overanalyze the stats. It's too confusing. It's frightening. We've seen this stat, maybe you've seen it too. It says that every time Curry shoots 40% from three-point range, a black man is killed by the police.
She just laughed and said, "We'll see." That night, she took the boy who was in the next cell. She dragged him to her tower, where she whipped him. I could hear her screams echoing through the corridors, begging someone to stop her. I reached my cell door, and it was open.
Had he done so... I feared he would have been lost to us. When we stop him, I can give him back his magic. No one needs to get hurt. Gideon has the sword now. And it's more powerful than ever.
If Alex, Jake and I join forces, we might be able to decipher Dreyfuss's coding and find out where he is. All right, then. Good luck to you all. This can't be right. You said it burned.
Turn around. Fire at will. My money's on the wizard. Will this war between us never end? It will... today.
You've got to be kidding me! Just kidding. What's wrong with the house again? Well, I'm just worried about this room. It seems to be getting...
That's all there is to it. That's all there is to it. That's all. That jerk Jian-Yang and his shitty app. I don't know about shitty.
No. His suit is up. He's just following. Oh, my... Is it holding for him?
He just follows. Oh, my goodness. Is she holding herself together for him? Gyro-stabilizers, magnetic boots, gloves, computer. She can run, jump and update her Facebook.
Should I tell you? No. It's called the Light Devourer and we're holding it back. Every generation, another warrior comes through the gate and fights the Light Devourer to stop it escaping. But the creature has escaped. It escaped and destroyed the entire IX Legion.
Easy for those who aren't uptight to say. I know the numbers for this place, okay? I know they don't add up. I think I've figured out a way we can not only pay our bills, make this place profitable again. And we can give the community the attention it deserves.
Nice to meet you, guys. Wait, I haven't finished my story. Oh, then let's all hear the end of your story. Well, he parked his car and forgot the parking brake. It ended up in the lake.
She's, uh... She's kidding. Well, actually, Sam, I remember when this was a town of workers who would have understood striking miners. Now it's all Thatcher's cunts, wanting to buy back their council flats, and splashing out on luxury cars and shitty double glazing. So I hope that if this evening has been fun, it has above all been an indispensable lesson in social responsibility.
I'm reporting a missing briefcase - gone, gone, gone. - I beg your pardon? A briefcase, you idiot. It fell out of a car somewhere in West Essex.
USA! They're about to take on the world's toughest obstacle course, both physically and psychologically... the ultimate battle of man against The Beast. Twelve will take part, but only one will win. Introducing Ultimate Beastmaster. I don't know where that thing came from or how it got there.
He has fallen. It's all over now. Simon Brunner representing Germany got his arms working! My forearms gave out. His strategy of going to Point Thruster got him 20 points, but it cost him his forward momentum.
I've got to try it. I'll risk it. We've got to get moving if we're going to make it on time. If there really is a tornado out there... - Imagine if it hit the ship.
You're a fucking sadist. You're sick. I'm almost tempted to sign away your time. This technology didn't work when Peter theorized it. It doesn't work now. In fact, it works now.
Should I join their ranks? In today's climate, you fraternize or you vanish. Laurie's pregnant, too. Are you drinking cream? She's semi-skimmed.
As I was saying, I've convinced a lot of managers. I'm leaving Raviga to set up my own company. This seems like a good time to change creams. Damn, you're a real ninja. Your revelation has absolutely no strategic value. It did, however, reveal your great loyalty. Everything's back to normal now.
I'd like to know why. 1) No more Erlich. Plus, we get our 20 million back. But more importantly, when you look under the hood, Keenan's tech is crap. No, it's not.
1) No more Erlich. Plus, we get our 20 million back. But more importantly, when you look under the hood, Keenan's tech is crap. No, it's not. I thought so too before the demo. It's pretty amazing.
It's an investment in our future, son. One day, when you've embraced who you really are, you'll come find me. How can I help you? We're looking for a clock. It belonged to my grandfather.
A girl that shy could never grow up to be a watcher. All right, let's get serious. I'll give you $1,000 for the clock. It's a collector's item. - 20 000 $. - It's not for sale.
It's your senses opening up like a flower. - I don't feel like a flower. - Let's go outside. Come and touch the grass. It's beautiful.
So I went to the mall. And there, in the window, was a leather jumpsuit. Just like Eddie Murphy's stand-up special. Mm-hmm. It was shiny, tight and bright red.
Yeah, me too. This weed vaporizer is awesome. - It is, isn't it? - Yeah, it is. - It lights up, too.
What's his story? I don't know. What's his story? Does he love lollipops and get tired of holding six at a time? Or was he a giant who got hit by a shrink ray, but the lollipop didn't get hit. - And it stayed giant.
Evan, I want you to think about your future. When you graduate and you're living your own life. No, it's never gonna be my own life. It won't. It will be. I promise you it will.
I thought my system was infallible. I have a list of all the qualities I look for in a guy, I assign them a point value, and if the number exceeds 200... Any suggestions? Burn that list. It's in the clouds, so it's gonna be tough.
Relieve myself. - I don't want to fill my pants! - Halig. The prisoner needs help. Uhtred wants to know more about Kjartan's fortress. It's high.
My minister, murdered. His wife, murdered. The murderess, who took her own life. And the epidemic continues to spread. It's within my walls.
His wife, murdered. The murderess, who took her own life. And the epidemic is still spreading. It's in my walls. It's in my blood and in my mind.
- My son. Would you like to see the toothbrush? See this? Damn it! It's in there.
Denise, put on your nice dress to look pretty for dinner. Seriously, this is bullshit. These aren't the clothes I picked out for you. Where's your pretty dress? - It didn't fit me.
Seriously, this is bullshit. These aren't the clothes I picked out for you. Where's your beautiful dress? - It didn't fit me. - It better fit you.
Say it again. Would you like to dance? Of course I'd like to dance. It's a beautiful song. Tell me what it's about.
I know what to expect and we're perfectly prepared. Perhaps you should join forces with King Ecbert. I have no desire or need to ally myself with that degenerate monarch. My daughter, we are aware of your scandalous relationship with your father-in-law. It affects us deeply.
These are the deeds to the Maintenon estate that the King is offering you, in your name. Oh, nonsense. I'm not interested in titles and things like that. You soon will be. Do you know where Gaston de Foix's new fortune came from?
We have this evidence transfer form we need you to fill out. For $2 million in cocaine? That's a lot of powder, isn't it? I need Avery's signature. It's right here.
How are you, Riggs? A little hungry. Thanks for asking. Where's your wedding ring? It, uh... fell off the bottom.
But one day, they started disappearing from my favorite sites. It was one of my favorite creatures. And you think, "If my favorite creature is going through this, what else is going on?" That's when I realized that one of the biggest problems with the ocean is that we don't see it or think about it. Basically, it's a publicity problem. When we take an interest in our planet, we realize that it's unique because we have this ocean, which is the source of life.
At this stage, almost two-thirds of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are experiencing temperature increases in areas where bleaching is taking place. Stress levels... Let me zoom in on Hawaii. You can see that here, the temperature has risen by 2.6°C. That's well above average. When you look at other hot spots around the globe, the temperature has risen by 6.1°C, 2.7°C, 4.5°C compared with seasonal normals. There's a huge heat wave sweeping the planet, and it's killing coral everywhere it goes.
- Five times a week? - Yes, it's on your schedule. We're going to inject 0.5 ml. - Big needle. - It's small.
It's wrong because it's easy. In the old days, I'd have burned an entire city to the ground just to see the pretty shapes the smoke would have made. I'm sorry your friend doesn't have a happy ending, but whether you like it or not, I just saved this world because I want to change. Your version of good isn't absolute. It's vain, arrogant and sentimental.
There are no drugs in the car; what's in the car? We don't know yet. I've just received the video from the onboard camera. It's quite damaged, but the technicians were able to save it.
No. This pyramid is 5,000 years old. But there's a problem. One small problem. It wasn't there yesterday.
I broke my glasses. Tell me what you see. A 5,000-year-old pyramid. What do you know about it? It wasn't there yesterday.
With over a billion intelligent species living in this galaxy, it's an ever-increasing challenge to know how to kill them. Here, we proudly serve as executioners of every living thing. But the execution of a Time Lord is a great honor. This technology is well calibrated. As you can see, it will stop both hearts, as well as the brain stem, and release a cellular shockwave that will forever prevent regeneration.
I'll ask you again. When you hold me in your arms... it hurts my heart. Lovely. No, that's your chest unit. She's pressing on it.
This is the last of Robby's stuff. How are you handling the breakup? Really well, since we're parents, and all the laws of nature say we shouldn't be together. If you need me today, I'll be in my room moving furniture around so it doesn't look like a place I kissed my cousin.
- They're so bad! - That's what I thought. I sent "The Pepperwood Chronicles" to a publisher and got a rejection letter today. - My career is over. - No, it's not.
- Are you going to help me? - Yes! Let's go! Damn, this glue works good! And it smells good, too!
- Yes! Let's go! Boy, that glue sure works! And it smells good, too! It smells really good.
Mr. McDuck... A highly efficient source of clean energy that could power Canardville for 50 years, courtesy of your friends at McDuck Water and Electric. Ooh, Mr. McDuck, what do you say to the other Scottish billionaires who claim to have the real jewel? This trinket? It's pretty, but it's clearly super bewitched.
- I was thinking... - Bolton! This show is crap! It's like a bunch of punks have infiltrated our studio. - You don't like my show? - Yeah, it stinks of ass!
And now you're all mine. You'll do everything I say... all the time. Now, you're going to find The Savior. And when you find her, you're going to kill her. Then, when The Savior dies, the sword must do what it must... free me from this prison.
The guy needed a moment to say goodbye to his entire comic collection. We had a few more questions. First, why is Dan's missing cover image being sold here? This is the first time Lady Wellin Marsapple, heroine of the Ogden Twiddlyhut series, has appeared in paint. And who says she's missing?
You touch it. Throw for damage. Booyah! What do you think of old Earl now, you little lich? Is she dead yet?
- I'm just saying, with his abandonment, you're now entirely responsible for my future and my safety. Let's put our foot down and jump that hump again. No offense, new Erica, but we've tried this before and it didn't go well for us. But this new car is so much more elegant, Adam She's got the concierge broom behind her that will act like a wing and help us get to the heavens.
18 h 15. This votive candle was burning the first time I saw Mitch. So many memories of Mitch. This broken baguette can clear. No, it's from the first meal delivered when we moved here.
That's right, Garfield wears a Rolex. Garfield wears a Rolex. Your pianist scarf. You found it. It was with the hurricane emergency kit in the garage.
But the pineapple cake looks good. The pie is better because it's full of nourishing fruit. It's the healthiest dessert. In fact, pie is so good that it's no longer just a dessert. It's also available as a chicken or meat pie.
The tart is better because it's full of nourishing fruit. It's the healthiest dessert. In fact, pie is so good that it's no longer just a dessert. It's available as a chicken or meat pie. It's been used by shepherds, mathematicians... and the possibilities are endless.
Young lady... what if someone had stopped you from following your dream? Am I supposed to answer that? I think you just did. Children's passion drives us to better ourselves. It breathes life into society.
Do you really want to watch a movie? It's a school night! You understand, Blake, it was the hospital's fault. They're the ones who gave me the room your mother was supposed to have. That's why they thought there were 2 Ferguson babies. Mmm. My mother says you stole her room because she was better off.
Maybe it still fits. Really, Mom! I can't even lift my arms to shake hands with anyone. Wait... I think I have a jacket that might fit. It's very masculine.
Isn't that right! That's what I've been saying. Here you go. On the house. I paid for this beer. It cost me $16,000.
I went to inspect it. I thought it was a plant. We ate the plant. Delicious! It's reassuring and warming.
- That's it, then. All set. - Well done, Pidge! The ship's technology never ceases to amaze me. It's so elegant.
The Cube is finally ready for shipment. Embark the best Olkarion engineers and prepare for take-off. Once the Cube has destroyed Olkarion, with any luck Zarkon will welcome us back into his fleet. Their headquarters is impenetrable from the ground, but there is a passage: a small opening in the roof. It leads to an open courtyard.
Step back. You've already taken all our supplies and resources. My people are aboard the Ark to leave our beloved planet before it dissolves completely.
Galra destroyed our ship's engines before leaving. So Galra was there. Lance... They've taken everything. We have to evacuate the planet before it dissolves completely!
- Call off your beast. - Step aside. We're leaving now. You won't get away with this blade. It doesn't belong to you.
Great! Scaultrite is an important substance used in commerce and industry. It's used to make foam, night-vision goggles, Teludav, klanmüirl antifungal lotions and oils. Why doesn't video work? It's 10,000 years old.
When the Black Lion is ours again, no one will stand in my way. Have you made any progress with my armor? None of the tests were successful. Each time, the subject was killed. It has to be ready.
- Good. - Right, then. Mary and Joseph! Have you seen the size of this church? It's enormous.
You're in your car on the way home, everything seems normal. You've almost arrived and suddenly something happens. What's the matter? There's a problem with the radio. It's changing stations.
Do you go there by choice or by order of your king? What's the difference? And don't pretend to be heartbroken. We know you courted me only to undermine Charles and take his throne. However our relationship began, it has evolved into something very real.
I trust you have good news? Good and bad, Your Majesty. You promised me that the cargo would be intercepted discreetly. Don't worry, we've hidden our ships and taken the bounty of the entire shipment. It's in the port, being loaded into several carriages.
You act on your emotions, and so your relationship gets in the way. You betrayed a mission for this. Why would I do that? Because my relationship makes me stronger, Harry. It doesn't hold me back.
You betrayed a mission for this. Why would I do that? Because my relationship makes me stronger, Harry. It doesn't hold me back. It allows me to accomplish what I need to, including this:
Yes, I'm locked in, too. I'm locked in, too. And I'm freaking out! Relax. The cellar prioritizes seed security so it should lock when it's most vulnerable, i.e. a reboot.
So whoever did this knows your family pretty well. Well... (Sighs) My father was an important accountant. I suppose that has something to do with my privileged adolescence. The card doesn't say pay. It says to give the money back.
and 70% of "we've got a big problem, we've only got 12 hours left, let's call this guy, who should be able to find us a solution and save the day in time." And I loved that, the tension in publishing. It was Chuck Close who said, "Inspiration is for amateurs. We pros get up and go to work." I love that quote, because it takes a lot of pressure off me.
It's all bullshit. Alas, I have to say that Backpage's legal strategy has been very effective. It's a mystery why Backpage always wins, and always with great fanfare. With very expensive lawyers, hiding behind the First Amendment and Section 230. As far as legal strategy goes, it must be brilliant, because it worked.
And she chose to protect the Internet. TWO IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICIES COLLIDE This particular comment really pissed me off, because I don't believe Congress did this. KRIS MONTGOMERY WIFE OF JOHN MONTGOMERY He was frustrated, because he felt like the judge hadn't understood what he was trying to say. The fact that Ropes Gray lost was actually a revelation of how much the justice system needs to be trained on underage sex trafficking. So his decision wasn't too surprising. But it was very disappointing, on the other hand.
Thanks for ruining "Spartacus" for me. They found the security footage Of the man who soiled my toilet. We'll find out. Jackie, there's a bee! It seems to be stinging!
It looks like it stings! Okay, ignore that. Jackie! - I'm meditating. - Jackie, is it on me?
Okay, ignore that. Jackie! - I'm meditating. - Jackie, is it on me? It was on top of the desk!
Jackie! - I'm meditating. - Jackie, is it on me? It was on top of the desk! It's in the room!
Were our predecessors more upright? More worthy of the power they wielded? More capable of serving the people? Yes and no. History always seems more beautiful than it really was.
The device is synchronized with your phone. Give it a try. Very good. Now, I'm going to look at some photos to generate an emotional response and we'll see if the machine can identify them correctly. Okay, remember, it can only detect happy, sad, angry, or excited.
People kept asking us to make these shoes. In 2006, I finally said to Mark Parker: "Why don't we try to make this shoe? A copy of the shoe from the film?" The shoe used during the shoot was a dummy. It didn't really work.
Michael looked at the shoe, looked at me and said, "I'm listening." I said, "You wanted mid-top sneakers and no one had ever made them for basketball. That's what you wanted. And you told me that the shoe should already be made to fit your foot, comfortable right out of the box. This shoe is made of very supple leather, reinforced in strategic places. You'll slip it on like a slipper. It will fit you perfectly."
Some of the drawings are moving. Others are funny. It's an avant-garde approach to sneaker design. That's what makes it special for me. It's truly original.
I was at the end of the bed drawing from Kanye's ideas. One of them was a man made of LEDs. After a lot of trial and error, I drew this posture. He seemed either too strong or not vulnerable enough. That day, I finally came up with a sketch that he loved. We made this model. We showed it in Los Angeles and everyone hated it. So we brought it home. She bows her head sheepishly. The parrot man cheers her up.
I'm not afraid. I'm absolutely convinced that Es is the most determined person I know. She's so enterprising that her imagination would need a personal chauffeur. It's not pure ambition. It's about exploring the imagination.
She's the one who talked to me about democracy in the theater. If there are 20 actors on stage, you can't control what the audience watches. Theater demands democracy. Whether you're at the top or the bottom, you have to have the same experience. The tower in Wagner's Parsifal. It rotates throughout the play. We see it from every angle.
We're going to find him. We don't even know where he is. Yes, you do. This magic can bring together anyone who shares a true love. It can open a door to Hook.
You're suing the Department of Justice in federal court. If your murder case hinges on that video, good luck. Thanks for the chat, boss. The video in question was recorded by an active-duty sailor. It belongs to the Navy.
Symptoms include sudden high fever, stiff neck, purplish rash, seizures, respiratory failure and death. - How contagious is it? - This strain has mutated to such an extent that it is transmitted by physical contact. Sweat, saliva, the slightest contact can be fatal. The good news is that it does not survive outside a host.
The good news is that it does not survive outside a host. Symptoms appear almost immediately after exposure, followed by death within minutes. Which is, ironically, the only good thing about the disease. - Is it? - It doesn't spread.
But in the end, that's all we have, isn't it? What's real, what we can taste, touch and smell. The words that pass between us when we look into each other's eyes are... all we can hold on to. The truth. I hold it dear.
I'll be able to walk out of here and take to the streets. I've always been okay with that. But lately, I feel it in the air around me. Like death is... looking down at me from the corners of the room. And I can't tell if it's here for me.
On his way to collect the money, his ex-wife wounded and killed Councillor Jones. - Felony murder. - I'm afraid I'm being repetitive, but nowhere in the law is intimidation deemed sufficient to trigger the felony murder rule. The law is illustrative, not exhaustive. It specifies that any offence involving a threat of physical force will trigger the rule.
None. She won't cooperate. If someone hired her to hunt you, she won't say who. The truth will out. It always does.
Seawater can make you hallucinate. Have you read La Complainte du vieux marin? I don't even know why you're asking. So the tooth that was in my stool... it was mine. It fell out due to stress and lack of dental floss, not to mention scurvy.
Oh for God's sake, Annie. If Jesse Shelperd was at the church where Sandy's body was found without fingernails, and they send me fingernails in the dress of a doll dressed like Mary, and they tell me to shut up or I won't learn the truth about either of them. So what? The cabin was just there for twenty years? It's overgrown.
Her HEPA filter goes out. She's going to die. No, only one line is broken. The other two are intact. But the line is glowing, and it's right on the bubble.
Why don't you check for yourself? You're practically on top of the thing. What's wrong with your hand? A caterpillar bit me, and now it's eruptive. It's in a cup in my greenhouse.
Bugs are dangerous. Ralph, did you look at the larva? What are you doing? The caterpillar! It's gone.
I can't say that, Nathaniel. Because I don't want to go back to 1942. I know I have to. I know I have a destiny and that we shouldn't damage time any further, but I think time is stronger than that. And if I have a destiny, it will be waiting for me.
They can be so much more. My magic? Why not yours? My dear, don't you see? Your magic is useful because it's unstable.
Your partner was busy. What do we know? We know there was heroin in Eric Cates' car. He swears it wasn't his. Listen and learn, the lab says it was 10% pure.
Can you describe what he was wearing? He was wearing a... a brown jacket with a ForeRange logo on it. - Yes, he was... wearing a ring. Can you describe the ring? It was silver.
You do your best. But you've really done it with this girl. Why did you come back to Pittsburgh? We're making a little stop on our way to see the World's Largest Chocolate Bar. It's as big as a table.
Dad needs to rest. The roads are full of potholes. Thanks, Obama. By the way, your mailbox jumped in front of us on the way here. It didn't make it.
Have you seen her? - Where is it? Where is it? - Hook. Give her a minute. That wand is... it's in the center of Storybrooke.
The Beast has no respect for you or your homeland. He fell in the blood of The Beast. The Beast punishes all mistakes. It is merciless.
He attempts the Point Thruster, but misses! - Coil Crawl! - He goes for it! He crosses Coil Crawl exactly as he should, which is to say very quickly, because the structure goes down. It's going down, but he's out of it.
Garcia. Sir, I know, I know, I know. The address will come to you now. It was complicated because Ben Davis never had a home, and he went back to his mother. I need to find out where his disability pension was going because it looks like it was going somewhere.
Sir, I know, I know, I know. The address will come to you now. It was complicated because Ben Davis never had a home, and he went back to his mother. I need to find out where his disability pension was going because it looked like it was going somewhere. It was going... do you have it now?
A product needs to be tested and fine-tuned. It takes a lot of testing to produce a viable product. When we designed the Sinnerlig range for IKEA, it was very important for us to develop furniture that would appeal worldwide. For this project, we had to understand what mass production is all about. Instead of saying "that's awful", we had to ask ourselves questions and understand that mass production can be beneficial. It allows as many people as possible to have access to certain products.
Coal, oil, natural gas. They all contain carbon. And when they burn, they produce carbon dioxide, which chemists call CO2. Carbon dioxide has a remarkable property. When sunlight penetrates the earth's atmosphere, it passes through CO2 molecules.
We have about ten tubs. - Ten tubs? - Ten. The water never stops. It rises.
What? Remember when I was shrewd and judicious? I was standing right here. Well, yeah, you got it all figured out, but the baggage is still there. I mean, once we understood gravity, it didn't stop affecting people.
The principal's jacket. I remember when you bought this ten years ago and promised you'd never wear it until you were actually principal. Principal Day. - Are you ok? - I don't think it fits.
It wouldn't have matched my room. It's not the right style for me. It looks great on you. Thanks, it's perfect. And, Nick, I like your room just the way it is.
It's not the right style for me. It looks great on you. Thank you, it fits perfectly. And, Nick, I like your room the way it is. It's already got style, it's you.
That's exactly what they're waiting for. You're going to have to attack them with kittens or mercury or the notion of time. Caleb's right. These people are unpredictable. Your strategy was helping us at one point, but if it's no longer useful, then we should change our approach.
She knows nothing. The less she knows, the better. Kelly Hughes... her mother was placed among the first eligible for organ donation two days ago. No doubt the Collaborators who gave her this advantage. My mother had an infection but just as she was getting better they moved her.
You sure about that? I'm not the boy in the bubble anymore. Is that good news? The half-life of the radiation used to poison you was very short. It was 24 hours.
I suppose you're suggesting that the helicopter ascends to an interception point with the space rock and we use the arm to grab the capsule. But won't the pebble crash into the helicopter? And even if it doesn't, how do you catch something falling from space at millions of kilometers an hour? It won't crash because gravity will pull the capsule down. And it'll only go 200 km/h, terminal velocity.
That's determination, Terry. He must have given up. He arrives at Faceplant. He says he can visualize the race in his mind and knows in advance what he's going to do. My injury handicaps me a little, because it's difficult to understand certain aspects of the race, but it also gives me an advantage, because I can interpret it very quickly.
I've been trying to get back into shape. I went to the gym today. I'll be back inside tomorrow, but... I just had to find it! It's next to my McDonald's. I hadn't noticed.
Can you hold on a second? Hello? Hi, are you still looking for a place to live? Hi, are you still looking for a place to live? Why would I be? We've got a spare room, and if you want it, it's yours.
Can you feel the heat? It's cool. Or hot, rather. The heat moves my hair. It lifts your blouse.
Really, Bob? You want to go out? Let's go. Yes, I have a new denim jacket I've been meaning to wear. It's faded.
Come on in. This food is incredible. - Where did he get this stuff? - I wonder. And this weapon. It went right through an Exterminator.
Yes. This is the factory entrance. These automated factories are scattered throughout the city. This one is the closest to your village. It's opened!
Can't we just go back to the automated factory? We can make anything, right? No. We can't go back. It's infested with Exterminators.
Don't go back to work just yet, you need to rest. I need to earn money. You had to win the war, now you have to make money. These men are back from the war, but they're still fighting an inner war that haunts their dreams, like their insomnia. It haunts their choices and their reactions to conflict, in the reality of post-war America.
He spared his effects, because he really wanted to make a big splash with the scene where Fred Derry climbs aboard a B-17. In this sequence, he shows all these planes lined up there, tails up, noses to the ground. For the first time in the film, Wyler moves his camera. So we see B-17s as far as the eye can see in this World War II cemetery. Then Fred Derry climbs into the plane, and the camera does this wonderful shot where it moves towards him.
It's probably a tree shoot. You know that photos always add 5 kilos. Have you ever taken a photo at zero scale? That's impossible. It always looks like it's at 5.
Pass the pill, please. The pill, Gail. The pill. The what? Where's the pill?
The pill, Gail. The pill. The what? Where is it? Well, the good news is, she's around here somewhere.
Stop talking about Rip Torn. - Do you have another dresser? - Yes, I have another chest of drawers. Just when I thought you couldn't get any more perfect. It's in... In my storage unit.
I'm both their girlfriends! How did you get in here, Jess? - Through the doggie door. - There's a doggie door? It's at the front door, and stuck with paint, so I really had to stick my head in.
- In the air. Satellite radio. And don't worry about accommodation, because we've taken care of that too. You have your own hotel room. It's adjacent to ours, but it's very private.
No. I don't think so. Do you have a white van? It used to be white. It's more of a rust color now.
I didn't mean to do it. Spit out the key! I'll give it a try. Disgusting! It's swallowed.
Spit out the key! I'll give it a try. Disgusting! It's swallowed. - It's in my stomach now.
Is this the house Lowell made for you? Very impressive. Did you know that Adam made a human-sized house all by himself when he was only 22? He did, huh? And it fell apart when he was 23.
The only way to fight this is not the truth. I couldn't tell the truth, so... I left. Do you miss it? When you leave your... your home, you can't know if what you'll miss is reality or what you wanted it to be.
Thank you. Wow, pretzels, 3 adults and a kid. The cops are going to shut this bachelor party down in a few minutes. I know, it's not, what we planned, but the bus is ruined, the piñatas are toxic, and none of you are fit enough to run around tonight. But I've got a surprise on the way, and it should be here in a few minutes.
I don't know... No, it's my own actions that have driven a wedge between me and the community I care so deeply about. A fortnight ago, I was supposed to go to Flint, Michigan, for a charity gala to raise public awareness of the disastrous state of the water supply. I don't know if you've heard, but the water in Flint is poisoned. It's making people sick.
Obviously, Bill Cosby was my hero. She doesn't know what it's like to think your hero did something so despicable. Oh, my God, you have no idea. It's like finding out that chocolate ice cream raped 54 people. You'd think, "But I like chocolate ice cream. I don't want it to rape."
This thing... it cracks me up every time. No guy says that. Only Lil Wayne says stuff like that. Like, "Is her pussy good?" "Yeah, it's juicy.
We can all admit it, right? This time, we're going to put you in a stomach. Hi! Womp, you've got one last pick. Make sure it's a good one.
The President wants to see you. All of you. Too often, when a President has to speak to Americans about terrorist acts, it's with a heavy heart. Today, I stand before you without that heavy heart. And while the threat of radicals is never far from our doorstep, it has failed.
How did you get this? Am I being bugged? On what grounds? The wiretap wasn't on you. It was on the mayor.
That's important, I suppose. Let's talk about our meeting this week with the investors. It's essential that you look professional. I'll wear my tie that looks like a fish. It's very popular and realistic.
- You sent Don a gift basket? - Yes. And for Mother's Day, you gave me a Sausage McMuffin. Can we stick to the issue at hand, please? Don's going to call our boss and break off a relationship she knows nothing about because it doesn't exist.
You're the sole beneficiary of Orson's estate. Which gives you motive. See the powder residue on the edge? I think it's Foxglove. This cup is our murder weapon. and it was on your drainer.
The problem is how to stop it before it reaches the nuclear repository? Do you have any more of these old cards? Yes, in the truck. I'll notify Homeland Security. So, if the burning vein goes up along this road, it might be shallow enough for us to use the foam.
Not necessarily. The vein runs through a sand pit. A sand pit. It's perfect. Lightning started this fire, now it's going to put it out.
The fire crosses the sand pit in less than eight minutes, and then it's off to the nuclear depot. Happy, I can't marry you if you explode into pieces. You've got less than 8 minutes. The indicators show that we've almost drained the truck batteries and fully charged this pit, and once it's saturated with energy, there's going to be excess voltage down. But if it discharges before the negative plate is in place, it will simply pass into the ground and we won't see a glass wall.
- I am. Positive that we're all going to die. Despite my convictions, everyone tried to contribute to the cause. Toby provided medical care. The wound is still there, but it's healing slowly.
You do. If, in addition to this diary, you found a little skeleton in an elf costume, now you know why. After the dinner incident, things got even more tense. But a few desperate people clung to hope. For this bottle to reach Allie, it would have to travel down to the Antarctic Circle current, be taken to Bengal, and then pass from the southern currents to those north of the Equator,
Yes. Well, do we know if it worked? Was the magnetic pulse triggered? Walter, look at your watch. Wait, it's stopped.
He wasn't there, and neither was Pride. We need to know where they are. Patton checked the CCTV. Stone's car left the clinic. And disappeared.
The suspects are somewhere on the water. Trapping - a dike. - But which one? We've got patrols sweeping the surface. And no guarantee we'll find the dam before it blows.
Better. I have the annual reports of the ONYDP when Kirby was on the board. What for? I'm hoping to find evidence of malfeasance. Let's see how many people will buy this ridiculous silver star when it's tainted with corruption.
- Why would I do that? - I don't know why. It's just a rule. Now that I know, I won't do it again. How did you read the list? It's in my pocket.
I'm an old man. When I landed, I shouted, "Oh, my hip! Oh, my hip! It's broken!"
Once again, women should have this right because... For two reasons. Number one: life isn't that important. It isn't. It isn't.
I wish I had a big, strong boyfriend. He's my boyfriend. I'm mad at my boyfriend. I'm wearing his jacket. It's too big.
He called to tell me he was missing a wrench. It's possible that a prisoner stole it from him. Cell confinement or an after-breakfast search? You read my mind. If she's in this prison, I want her found, before she cracks someone's skull open.
Maybe not this minute, but any minute. It could come at any time. Like now! Thanks for trying, but we'll never get out of this one... Your crazy idea... It worked!
Oh, hi, Katie. So, I don't know... how was the library? It was great. I got a lot of homework done. You did not! It was closed!
His lawyer claims not to know where he is, so the police are looking for him. I saw this. The DNA matched. The urine on Chantal's bed was Roy's. I can't wait to find out how she got there.
The DNA matched. The urine on Chantal's bed was Roy's. I can't wait to find out how she got there. What? "How it got there"?
I can come back. Yeah, that's a good idea. He's upset. This guy claims that Dr. Marr gave him 20 pounds to cremate the beast. He didn't want it to attract vermin.
"Let's face it, that's the worst of it." Okay. I ate a side of pork. Not to brag or anything. But right now, it's in my belly.
But right now, it's in my belly. And I realized that you can't eat in a restaurant the way you eat at home, you know? At home, you'd never make yourself a pan-seared pork chop, cook it well on one side before cooking it on the other, and then you open it up to see what it's like, and afterwards, you say, "My God, I'm craving that delicious pork chop." As soon as it's hot enough, I'll eat it.
I got a number, and it's good. Crap. What's up? This offer isn't just good. It's too good.
I must have been the last to see her. This is the parking lot where her car was found. Once we got there, we called the police. They came quickly, secured the area and told us, "Don't get in, don't touch anything." The car was parked exactly where we're parked right now. It wasn't locked and the keys were in the ignition.
There were lots of boxes. In plastic bags. Typical of a pedophile. He can't part with his collection. He needs to know it's there, even if he doesn't have access to it.
But I also want to tell you that I'd like my letter. I understand it's a clue and I can't touch it, but could we... Could I look at it? Can I read it? They said they couldn't find it. It did exist.
I have some information about him. I know there was a letter his sister received afterwards. As far as I know, the letter is no longer part of the evidence. The city would have taken possession of it. We've never seen it. What I think you're saying, Robin, is that... You know it's not part of the evidence provided to the county police?
Seeing Kevin Murphy speak... It brought back memories of Maskell v. Madame X and Y when he interviewed me in 1994. And today, he speaks as if he sympathizes with victims of sexual abuse. Do you see any other reason for the usefulness of the statute of limitations other than the failure of memory? Seven years is not a short time. It's a rather long statute of limitations, but it prevents the alleged abuser from continuing his abuse for the next 13 years.
For many years, I couldn't remember anything, and one of the first things that came back to me was Cathy Cesnik. This woman died for wanting to stop what was happening there. Thanks to the group Justice for Cathy, thanks to Cathy's sister who had the courage to get involved, to ask questions and somehow, to find peace... I've reached a stage in my story where I can move on. You can't bury the truth, it reappears.
You're not gonna believe this. The facial recognition algorithm Felicity gave us? I modified it to detect meta-human activity. Are you listening? Sorry, I'm looking for a U.S.B. key, it's not at the station.
It's a casual joke. That's even cooler. I ruined it because I went back and talked about it. It's ruined. She's not glib anymore.
She was vomiting. And as she vomited, she felt someone tugging at her panties. She couldn't turn around because she was throwing up too much. She vomited again and again and her panties came down. All the way down.
It wasn't bad. And during the summer, he'd gone to camp and blossomed. He was a star, he could finally be whoever he wanted to be. So parents think... "No, camp is great." She's going to assert herself.
And during the summer, he'd gone to camp and blossomed. He was a star, he could finally be whoever he wanted to be. So parents think... "No, camp is great." She'll assert herself. She'll be happy.
- Rachel - Listen... We've been through so much together to know that I'll still love you in the morning, but ask yourself: what's your word worth? Because these days, it's not worth much.
Hoping it'll make less noise, when in fact it makes even more. Really enjoy the noise as you unwrap your Swedish Fish, the Lamborghini of jelly beans. Or maybe you've brought along a Werther's Original, the danger alert of toffees. Those familiar with our work, which means eggs, will recognize this piece. It's more autobiographical than our other pieces.
The stage opens on a brown room, a ray of yellowish sunlight illuminates what looks like the dry skin of an ugly old man. This is George Reddington. George has trouble getting a hard-on, so he uses a tongue depressor as a splint for his zigounette. I dunno. George went up like a hotel clock, she's crooked and she's seen terrible things.
You should be more interested in young audiences." What nerve. I think about teenagers all the time. But George, what did the letter say? It said the book won't be made.
Shall we put them side by side? Or just sit there. We have to stand and talk. Is the news good or bad? It's bad.
It costs $67,000 to put a kid in jail for a year in this town. That's crazy. Come on, fatty. These boxing gyms that created champions and legends MEMBER OF BOXING'S HALL OF FAME seem to have disappeared. It bothers me, because boxing has given me so much. I wouldn't have had this life without it.
Ernesto Rubio is linked to the Avendaños. GENERAL BLANCO, PRESIDENT'S RIGHT HAND MAN AND IMPUNISHED VIOLATOR It's the gringos, they were threatening to talk! It doesn't matter who leaked it. It's in the hands of a journalist.
It's not going to be that easy. Why are you being so negative? Help me out here. The cover is grim. It doesn't stand out.
Not really, no. So, could you tell us everything you know about her? The police told me about Nanaka's life. She had a simple life.
Let's see if it's inhabited. Maybe they need help. We can send a probe to see if we can learn more. You do that. The energy doesn't seem to be radioactive and it's not thermal.
The crew abandoned ship? They couldn't have got far without their combinai... They're not empty! We've located the other comet thanks to King Alfor's indications. We've managed to bring it aboard, but it's causing major disruption.
If Voltron disappears from our world, we've won. If they come back with the comet, we'll take it from them. Either way, we win. This is the comet Rear Admiral Trayling was talking about. It seems to be stuck between two realities, like the ship.
I'll give you a mouse bath. We'll do that after we find Lotor. Can we activate it to see if it works? We may not have adjusted the polarity correctly. I've found the comet, folks, but it's moving away from us.
Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Shiro. We've got to get that comet. They'll transport it to the base. It'll be vulnerable during the transfer.
Little did they know that on that night, the fate of the universe would change forever. I finished evacuating all the Galra citizens near the crater. - What did you find out? - We're not sure. This comet is like no other. It seems to be made of materials that can cross realities.
We don't know what lies ahead. The ancients believed that lightning was an arrow from the gods, before scientific advances. Knowledge always pushes us into dangerous territory. Alfor and Honerva erected a particle barrier around the crater to contain the creatures. But it didn't hold.
A distinctive sign? - No. They're Jews. - It's always the same story. Yes, and it's a popular one.
- They'll see that it goes on. - They won't come. That's the way it is. Their war is over. It's over.
Apneist, negative on stroke test and reflex apnea. I think I've found the problem, Dr. Palmer. - He's still got the bullet in his skull. - No kidding. It affects the spinal cord.
It's just that you said, "Let's go," so... - Oh, my God. Shoot it... - We're wasting time. Just slam the door on your way out, it'll lock!
Right away. Please, everyone. Fernando was here when something slipped out of this ventilation window and... I heard him screaming so I came over to look, and that's when I saw this "thing" spinning Fernando around the room. I thought it was going to slaughter him.
- Hmm. It wasn't even the cat. It was the president. Oh. It was part of the "Colors of Past Presidents" collection.
Oh. Uh-oh. - Go for it. - Go for it. Physics is the study of the motion of, uh, bodies in space, and it can unlock the mysteries of the universe.
Uh-oh. - Go for it. - Go for it. Physics is the study of the motion of, uh, bodies in space, and it can unlock the mysteries of the universe. But it can't answer the essential question, which is: "What is the purpose of our existence?"
Henry. Hey, Henry. Hello. Henry, there's an old Japanese proverb. "The wounded carp cannot heal his gills "if he seeks comfort and distraction "from the pleasant seaweed god."
Uh, listen, sir... I don't think... I don't know if this is exactly the subject you're looking for, but I think it highlights my ability to recognize what's unique about an individual and how to bring it to the fore for the market. What is your corporate philosophy? It's all about customer satisfaction.
Why are you here? I'll tell you why you're here. You're here because I want you to run our Internet and viral marketing. You're offering me a job? I saw your Skeezy D video, and it blew my mind!
Can you explain? Just listen. I was stupid, okay? I thought I'd failed in life. I thought it was banal, and I was wrong.
Hey, listen. I was stupid, okay? I thought I'd failed in life. I thought it was ordinary, and I was wrong. It's special because you're here.
He'd jump. He has a better chance of falling than crashing. And the fall isn't fatal? It all depends on altitude and landing. I've heard a story. I don't know if it's true. It's about an assassin so efficient that he killed more than 30 high-ranking people during his career.
Dinner's ruined. I told you not to wait up for me. We've been over this. Can we just take it easy? We started 2 years ago with the best orgy of my life. Let's find that lightness again, it's there.
But I feel like I've always been connected. Tell me, do you know the fountain of youth? Why does everyone keep asking me? Not the palming salon where you used to work in SoHo, the mythical fountain. It's said to be 6,000 years old and originally located in the Garden of Eden.
Here we go, my sexy sister. Look, erotic combat! Lethal! Tommy says yes. Guys, pay attention, I'm holding a bomb and it's on.
That's what Jack called it. When he saw what we were spending, he'd say, "Your little vanity project "will bankrupt the federal government." People need their history; it strengthens them.
And what about you? Do you think you've done him justice? I think the characters in books are more real than the man standing beside us. It was too much to ask to grow old together, to see our children grow up. The darkness will undoubtedly remain, but it will eventually fade.
Cheers! Enjoy! The whole thing is a machine. When the machine works, it feeds everyone. When it breaks down, nobody eats.
The whole thing is a machine. When the machine works, it feeds everyone. When it doesn't, nobody eats. Don't you see? The machine doesn't stop for anyone.
All tugs, evasive action. Stand back! Get back! Get back! - Charlie! Charlie! She's going to crush the base!
I don't think it's dangerous for us. But it must be for them. He turned it on just by touching it. I got activated when I noticed that your biological signature was different from theirs. It talks!
We're rich! We're rich! I don't know if this planet can survive another attack. Excuse me, Director Levinson, you won't believe the weapons and technology this thing has on its hard drive. It wants us to lead the resistance!
Would you like to find it? Thank you for your time. Did you use my toothbrush? - I might have. - It was wet.
I went into the apartment and never came out. Homecoming was two weeks later. I had a portable radio. Sometimes I listened to music. Eventually, I was nailed to my chair. I only got up to go to the bathroom and eat. The batteries in my radio were gradually wearing out, and I had to hold it up to my ear to listen to it. Then it gave out.
Come here... So, I have a story. It's a story about a spider. There was this spider... that climbed up this water tank, no it climbed up the downpipe, like, you'd do it with your hands, like this.
I don't know, the spider went away, but it's not like a sad story. I don't know, the spider. The spider. The spider and the downspout, and then it rains, and then she rinses it out.
He moved, he moved, he jumped. There's nothing there. He just jumped, he moved. There's nothing there. Anxiety, it rises to the surface.
And we take a very aggressive approach. A brochure? Yes, of course. My secretary can send you one right away. But I have to tell you, about this offer, it's already very saturated.
And best of all, they all have 12 to 18 months of positive income. - Manitoba? - Yes. We took an option on a missed claim at the auction. Yes, but the option is valid for 90 days.
But that doesn't happen much anymore. They'll think we might be shopkeepers, or someone's mother-in-law. How much longer? This jungle will test you. It'll grab you, weigh you, and decide your worth down to the gram.
Then tell me. - You lack vision. Okay? Fucking vision. Your vision starts here, and it goes all the way to here.
Hang on a sec! Listen, he's talking about a little a-bite... bee! - A bee of the plush variety. - A bee? There was a bee here. And it was very soft.
{\1cH00ffff}Shutter block. {\1cH00ffff}"And they sink into the mud..." {\1cH00ffff}Verse. {\1cH00ffff}Filled with straw. {\1cH00ffff}"Mud so heavy it keeps the monsters from climbing.
Good, good, good. I'm so glad to see you. Oh! Do you like this dress? Is it ugly?
I'm so happy to see you. Oh! Do you like this dress? Is it ugly? I think it's a little... I don't know... you know, it's a little puffy.
You know what you have to do. I'm not going to be stupid and tell you. You know what you have to do. I like this song. It's a great song.
Come on, little guy. It's you and me, kid. Big boy! There you go. - Yeah. Look, I just want to say. I don't know the whole story, but whatever it is, it'll blow over.
Now, listen to me. This is not a safe place! Stay away from here. Grandpa, did you take your medicine today? The Key to my gun cabinet, it was in the drawer.
Yes, that's exactly it. Well, I think... if she wasn't beautiful, you wouldn't have even noticed her. Beauty isn't everything. It's everything.
- No, because we're worth it. - I have fake nails. You're one of a kind. I'll miss the view from the beach. It'll be there, but not at the window when I wake up.
Is it legal? It's not illegal. Wanna give it a try? What about your charity run? Was it 5 km?
All the lights. We'll leave it to you, Captain. Listen up! Listen up! We'll put the swell behind us. It'll push us right up to the shore.
- That's right, that's right. I brought it back from DARPA. A hyperspectral camera. A more powerful version of your men's helmets. It perceives the light spectrum better.
You saw it. What was it? It was human. A human form. It was conscious.
I lent it to that boy who had the accident. My pants don't fit so well without it. I don't have your belt. No, I know that, Madame. It's still on the boy.
Geran, the work you do, the risks you take, deserve that you keep half of our profits. But the person you are, compared to me, obliges me to reject... to refuse your request. It's a question of character, refinement, value, virtue, which are... foreign to you. Accept the comfort of your place in life, Geran. It suits you perfectly.
No! It was 1943. God, I've always hated Wednesdays. I was hiding in my father's study. My little sister and I were playing hide-and-seek. I suddenly discovered this briefcase. It was my father's.
You can deduct the space dedicated to your work. Mr. Rice, how big is your dining room? Mrs. Rice's office. I wouldn't call it an office. It's about 19 m²...
First, to avoid the taxman. But he had a better idea. By stealing his own money and putting it back into his accounts... He generated cash. He went public at $8 a share. The following year, it sold for $75.
You were good at school, with lots of friends. You probably played soccer. Maybe you were even captain of the team. Life was easy. And then, all of a sudden, it wasn't.
Wasn't that Parkinson's last week? Have a nice evening, Dr. 36 hours? The start of Bastille Day. Is it going to happen?
- Really... - Shhh, shhh, shhhh. - The mud speaks to me again. - And what does it say? It's telling me that anyone who talks all the time is a fool.

My name is Sam Chisolm, and I'm a sworn officer in Wichita, Kansas. I'm also a licensed peace officer in Indian Territory, Arkansas, as well as seven other states. What just happened here was only the first skirmish. The real battle is yet to come. The idea is that, when it comes, it will be on our terms.
Remember what you said to me when all those Yankees were beating the crap out of me? - I do. - You do, huh? You asked me why I was rescuing a dirty Southerner like you, and I told you the war was over. - But it's not over, Sam.
- But it's not over, Sam. - Yes, it is. No. The killing isn't over yet. It goes on and on and on and on.
Not in my part of Texas. Look, Billy, it doesn't have to be God or country. But it's got to be more than you. Some people like to think they're already dead. Bob, I appreciate the question. It clears up a few things for me.
His soul or... I don't know. Billy. Often, that's what happens. Everything goes dark and when the light's gone, it reappears.

How do they communicate? Louise gave us a lesson. The first discovery was that there is no correlation between what a heptapod says and what he writes. Unlike human languages, their writing is semasiographic. It has meaning, but does not represent sound.

The engineers on site said they were going to extract 2,000 barrels a month from this place. Try convincing a judge to give you a warrant for someone who's going to make 50,000 a month for stealing 40,000 from a bank that runs his family trust. Midlands manages the trust? You'd expect them to want to clarify that. I think all that matters to the bank is that this trust stays where it is.
- And who's he? - An old friend of your husband's. Ex-husband. I'm doing some work on the house. You don't live here? No, it's not mine, it's theirs.

She wants to keep you. She loves you. I don't need to hear that. Get the other saw. Where is it?
And I followed you. I learned a lot about life from watching you. I've learned how to recognize trouble, how to sort out the good stuff. You taught me a lot of things. How not to repeat mistakes, how to take life as it comes, how to keep moving forward.
Show him places. Make him laugh. Good grief! What if this list could do more than that? What if it could change his mind?
That's it. Like in the song. What song? There's a song my father used to sing to me. It's about dragons and where they live.
Nobody believed me. I know what people thought of me. At times I even thought people were right. But then I'd think back to magic. It changed the way I saw the world, the way I saw the trees, the sun, and the way I saw you.

Like I'm being used. Does she ever say things only to you? That only you can hear? What does she say? That she wants to hurt you.
So, in theory, deep lakes could be home to such a creature. On land, I mean. A giant sea creature on land. Well, no. If its body evolved in an aquatic environment, it can't move without feeling gravity.
Daddy! Daddy! - Hi, big guy! You made it, huh? Hey, you see that spot right over there? It's for you, it's the best.

If there were any other way... Jack, if I thought it would give you pleasure, I would have killed you the moment you suggested it. Hmm. The first time I saw it on the beach, I thought, "My God, the things I'm going to build with this." A city... living in a world where it doesn't belong, defying all reason and refusing to be dislodged, but growing and... a place that, 50 years from now and when I'm far away

She tried everything to feed me, find me shoes. I didn't see how it broke her. But I wish, oh, I wish so much that she were here now to hug her, to tell her she was good and strong, the bravest woman I've ever known. Shame holds us captive if we let it. It distances us from those we love, and who love us.
Come, we'll escort you. As if you were the Queen. Help me, please help me... Take my hand. See how steady it is?
You were unconscious this morning. Please don't close the door. After years of caring for mothers and babies. I've realized that all pain eventually passes. I know it does. Sometimes it doesn't go away until you acknowledge, that it's there.

A maturity that says, taste this. A maturity that urges us to share without fear or retribution. It's the fruit of our experience and, in its heart, it bears the seeds of all hope. Take joy, take all it gives. Life is sweet and it's ours.

Tickets. That's the wrong one, that's your letter. - I threw the letter away. - No. It's right there.

We resisted from the start in our own way. I personally have no qualms about killing a Nazi pig. But don't think that what you do doesn't affect us. Because it doesn't. You should clean your gun, because it's dirty.
First of all... All of you who continue to steal, kill, sell untaxed drugs, who don't pay your alimony, but just bought yourselves the latest Xbox and a pair of Jordans... I'm talking to the bankers, who make a million with every sneeze, while people can't pay back your loans. Tonight, as Americans, we purge. If you've done nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about. The Purge isn't about you, it's about everyone else.
Put it there. Are you following me? I don't think I do. You stab someone with a knife, so hard that you hit the bone and your hand slips on the blade. But it only slips once, despite 22 stabs.
I...I...I have to go. I guess that means maybe? Every time I walk into this room... I hold my breath to hear hers. Hoping she'd still be here. Sometimes she's so slow...I have to climb on the bed to put my ear to her mouth...to make sure.
I guess that means maybe? Every time I walk into this room... I hold my breath to hear hers. Hoping she'd still be here. Sometimes she's so slow...

Don't come any closer. I'm not sure it's safe I'm standing on a. - I'm standing on a mine. Normally, you step on a mine, it explodes in seconds, but we think Korsak stepped on the edge of it and he shook it and that's how he saw it.
- Big machines and small thugs. Juvenile delinquency in blue jeans. Then there's the service. The order takes forever to arrive - and when it does...
They probably want to get home to their kids. No, we're fine. We're just doing our job. I know about your gun. Yeah, but it's not for you.
We want to project the right image. Some of our jurors will be admiring and deeply touched. People already admire me. Everyone loves my house! It was in Sunset Magazine.
Get back in the van or I'll tell them you're Jewish. Oh shit, this is bullshit... back off! But it's not true! What the police department has done is increase the number of uniformed officers Just to assess the situation if it changes and adjust it if it changes.

You have until nightfall. You gave it to me for a purpose. I've achieved that purpose. It's yours. It will always be yours.
My parents might disagree, if I dug up their bodies from your basement and asked their opinion. I know you hate Elves, but we don't murder prisoners of war. If your parents were prisoners here, we would have released them at the end of the war. Perhaps they chose to start a new life, free of their burdens. Your ear... It's like mine.
No, it's not all right. - It's not okay. - Bloody hell! I summon the indestructible sword! It's broken.
I'm a little disappointed with this magic sword. It's the wrong sword, you fool! Look, look, look! The sword! It's on his skull.

What's the point of reanimating the dead if they come back insane? He's not crazy. He simply doesn't know who he is. His psyche can't accept the idea of having been brought back from the dead. It's broken, and clings to fragments of memory.
We shouldn't even be talking about this. This is a chance to do better. what? What would you like? If you want food, it's in your bowl.

He's right. He's right. He's right. He's right. I don't like seeing that gallows, despite what they say. If we were to remove it, the governor would lose the confidence of the residents. That said, in three days, I want it dismantled and out of sight.

So... Tom Quince. Ready to go? Let's wait for the dope. It'll be here soon, and we'll be fine.
Killed in Virginia while researching a possible scandal involving our government selling arms to Syrian rebels. - Never heard of it. - Yeah. Because it never came out. The story was discredited after Brooks' death, and it never came to fruition.
and Congressman Hill was on that commission. He headed that committee. So Wythe and his men could have eliminated anyone who got too close to this scandal. What happened to this investigation? Well, it was disbanded after Congressman Hill withdrew due to his injuries.
You think that's funny? Get out of here. You deserve a good beating. Brother, I know what you mean. If there's no fuel in a car, will it run?
Mmm? TEDDY: What does the water do? MAC: It muddies.
I wouldn't miss it for the world. - Aren't you scared? - No, I'm not afraid. Why should I be? If death comes, it comes.
On his pants. I remember thinking that nobody has any. Let's get back to the car. Remember the car... the color? It was gray.
The place is untouched. No personal photos, friends or family. He looks lonely. I know this photo. It's famous.
There you go, talking like a soldier again. Abbot, forgive me, but you don't understand. Yes, I do. I've grown fond of you over the years, Aramis. I enjoy your company... but your soul is as restless and confused as it was the day you arrived here.
It's always the Muslims. I know, they're not all nuts. Where's your brother? - He's in bed. - Perfect, I'll join him. Don't drop your suitcase, it'll explode!
2pm, line dancing. Etc., etc. They always leave 3:00 to 4:00 free. Why? "The murder she wrote." It's been in syndication since the 1850s, and let me tell you, when this thing is on, it attracts blue hairs like butterflies to a zapper bug.
I screwed up, plain and simple. And then I... I blamed you. It's this damn electricity! It weakens me.
And then I... I blamed you. It's this damn electricity! It weakens me. It diminishes my faculties.
In its writing. Can you assure me that none of this is illegal or dangerous? I can assure you, if my husband asks you, it's for a good reason. This is the basic melody. It repeats in declensions.
For example, this artist worked for 30 years before finally finding his style. He left home as a boy to escape the Nazis, fled to Paris, and painted the poor children he saw on the streets. The ambiguity he uses to paint children and animals. His work provokes. It raises questions.
What?! So that painting I bought from you wasn't worth anything? Of course it wasn't. It meant something to you.
! So that painting I bought from you wasn't worth anything? Of course it wasn't. It meant something to you. It's worth exactly what you paid for it.
It meant something to you. It's worth exactly what you paid for it. - I want to sell it. - Okay. In this exchange, it'll only be worth what I'd pay for it, which is, again, um, nothing.
She wrote to me asking for a Snow White dress from Disney. That's it! That's it, what? I thought the fuchsia dress was prettier and could pass for a Snow White dress. But it's yellow in the film.
Solid arguments. It's unfair to discredit those who seek the truth just because they suggest plausible hypotheses. These are speculations, not hypotheses. You know that scientific research feeds on the imagination. It takes various scenarios as a starting point to develop relevant hypotheses.
Rogelio, is the halyard undone?! It's stuck ! It's hooked to the mast ! It won't go down !
I understand why you're here, and I understand why this concerns you. But they don't. To get this over with as quickly as possible, perhaps it would be best if all our roles remained clearly defined. To avoid any unnecessary and unpleasant confusion. A man buries a dead thing, he expects it to stay there.
But they don't understand. To finish all this as quickly as possible, perhaps it would be better if all our roles remained clearly defined. To avoid unnecessary and unpleasant confusion. A man buries a dead thing, he expects it to stay there. Sometimes it resurfaces
Help! My goodness! They say the worst is never very long. And that the sea always ends up taking back what it has given. It makes you cold, it scares you.
My goodness! They say the worst is never very long. And that the sea always ends up taking back what it has given. It makes you cold, it scares you. It shows you things.
It shows you things. Bad things. And then warms you up. It settles your account. It shows you where you've been.
A bare-knuckle fight between two equal men, the only difference being the size of their will. And now all you have to do is say "please". You want us to fight over this? I had such high hopes for this island when I heard the Guthries were gone. I thought it had a chance of regaining its former power, as it did then.
I suppose you'll be looking out for each other, and I'll be looking out for myself. What's the news, Captain? I chased Captain Flint as promised. When he and his crew declined my offer to pardon them, I used my advantage and pushed him right into the storm When it subsided, I patrolled the entire area and discovered a lot of wreckage.
What future do you propose? I want to gather forces and reconquer Nassau. Conquest is always weaker when the conqueror allows himself to believe it's already done. For Nassau, that's the case now. England may hold the island, but it still needs supplies.
I want to gather forces and reconquer Nassau. Conquest is always weaker when the conqueror allows himself to believe it's already done. For Nassau, that's the case now. England may hold the island, but it still needs supplies. It still depends on trade.
And now you want to do the same. You let him go long before it was time. That time was already past. That you can't see it makes me realize more clearly that you've never known this place. This fleet is all that's left of it, and as long as it belongs to me, Nassau must remain in the past.
I would have spared Nassau... and do you think this story will be told long after I'm gone? It will. I'll make sure of that. A dull story in my opinion, and one that requires promises about ensuring its telling. When the actual story unfolds, I assure you, it will encompass everyone, all by itself.
But now we have to decide what to do with it. Maybe I can help with that. Something to add to our asset pile. Before Ocracoke, we came across a loot... Spanish loot carrying a wealth of information. Most of it was destroyed by the time we found it, but among the debris was a piece of information, something everyone quickly dismissed as worthless at the time.
And they've made it clear that failure will spell the end of Nassau. The governor is a reasonable man. He's compassionate, but he needs this cache. I don't care what he needs. Jack doesn't want it handed over.
It's just rumors at the moment, but sooner or later it will affect him. Undermine his support. Complicate the role he must play. The position of governor is undoubtedly as ruthless as mine. It demands the same kind of sacrifices and presents the same kinds of dangers for those close to him.
So we put a knife in his hand and let him have his revenge. For reasons beyond comprehension, Mr. Dobbs still has a number of friends on this crew... How can we explain his disappearance to them? This story will spread, and when it does, all hell will break loose.
I was there. In Nassau. She's there too. Eleanor's there. She'd have a lot of influence. To the right of the governor. She's one of them now. When I was in Nassau, I realized that when this war breaks out, it will have several meanings. In your eyes, it will be a civil war. A clash between two cities you've managed in secrecy.
It's always like that. Darkness uses the reasons that will drive us to act. The more we ignore it, the more it grows. Then, it can consume us completely without us even knowing it was inside us. Listen to this. If we're going to lead these men together, you're going to have to learn to recognize its presence so that you can use it, and not let it use you.
- Let me see your gun. Our shooter had a tattoo on his wrist. I'll accept your apology in cash (small cut). I'll keep it short. This same footage tells me you're not our shooter, but what it doesn't tell me is why the shooter was in your car.
How long does it feel? Like I don't exist. Is that why you went ahead and killed those people? I didn't know my company was dead. It's not dead.
As if I didn't exist. Is that why you went ahead and killed those people? I didn't know my company was dead. It's not dead. It's dying.
Of the good time you're going to have and the dress you're going to choose. I don't know what to say. I buy my jeans at the supermarket. The dress doesn't matter. It's about repairing 400 years of injustice in a sleeved, pleated, brightly patterned dress. It's beautiful.
How long have you had that condom? I... I don't... I don't know. I... I forgot it was there.
Oh, thanks, Josh. You put a smile on an old condom. Right on. What was your favorite part? Oh, probably the part where the rocket breaks down and it needs moonstone...
Anyway, you're still stunningly beautiful. I haven't seen our neighbor for a while. He must be out of town. He usually waters his lawn. It's getting damaged.
Did I miss something? Is this thing shooting lasers out of its eyes or something? For starters, there's its emergent precognition. What you don't understand is the scope of its intelligence. Doctor, with all due respect, do you want a pane of glass to separate me from this thing? In that case, we can already conclude that she failed the assessment.
I'm going to the Council. I've got an intelligence meeting. We can drop you off. - I've got my car. - It'll follow.
- And the entrances and exits? - All this state-of-the-art equipment - it hardly seems necessary. - The two of us are old-school. The camera can see more than the eye, but it doesn't interpret what it sees.
Let me see. Pam, if a single flyer leaves here, I'll sew you up in a sack full of rats and throw you in the river. I've got a pollution control! River? It's concrete.
- Yes, but... - She has diarrhea. Is she? - You guys! - You what? You swallowed that pizza like it owed you money.
You'll discover all the stages she went through with the accused, on her cold and calculated itinerary, which began with the theft of a car in Queens and ended with the violent death of a young woman in her bed. Before this descent into hell, a few words of advice. Don't be fooled by the innocent air of Mr. Khan, who sits among us in shirt and tie, or by the defense that focuses on the victim's wanderings throughout her all-too-short life. This case is not about Andrea's life. It's about her death.
That's right. - What's this? - The entrance gate. It's ajar. It hasn't closed for years.
It's ajar. It hasn't closed for years. Hence the rust on the lock. - What's this? - The basement door. It closes. According to the experts, it was unlocked, as was an upstairs window on the garden side.
Objection overruled. Is Dr. Chester, although unknown to the general public, a good coroner? I'm under oath. I must answer: no, I don't think so. You dispute his explanation of the wound on the victim's hand, but also... what he said about this cut on the defendant's hand. Yes, it's not due to the fact that the hand slipped from the handle onto the blade.
All black-blooded, all born of the dust of this dark land. Go on. I remember doing it, but not the reason... Don't look for glory. It will find you.
People fear skin-changers more than other creatures. Because they can live among us without being seen. If word gets out, there'll be panic. - Can you find the thing and kill it? - If it's still here.
Slean, go west to Scorann. You and I, brother, will ride north for the others. You swore to avenge Bayen. Can you find this thing and kill it? If it's still here.
They are on the cliff. They're jumping to escape the flames. It's my parents. They're hurt, they won't wake up. I saw her head fall. She just disappeared.
It could have solved a mystery to which I would never have an answer. Please enlighten me, Agent Mulder, how nine years of college, three degrees, and two years at Quantico have left me so simple-minded. Not simple-minded. A mugwump. I don't appreciate that description, and I don't even know what it means.
- for all of us. - I agree. A child is not a tool for spreading hatred. But where does hatred stop? Maybe it stops where it started, by finding a common language again.
- Which car? That car. The one we're riding in. Why would I recognize that damn car? Doesn't it look familiar?
When I woke up, the voice was back again. I decided to flee. I crossed the sea. When I landed on solid ground, I heard that cursed voice. Do you know what it said?
I decided to flee. I crossed the sea. When I landed on solid ground, I heard that cursed voice. Do you know what it said? It said...
When I set foot on dry land, I heard that damned voice. You know what it said? It said... I'm sorry, would you excuse me? Okay, Maeve. What did it say?
You know what she said? She said... I'm sorry, would you excuse me? Okay, Maeve. What did she say? She said, "This is the New World.
Deletes this interaction. Confirm. Yes. You'd better get back, Dolores, before someone notices you're gone. When I set foot on dry land, I heard that damned voice. It had followed me.
Confirm. Yes. You should go back, Dolores, before anyone notices you're gone. When I set foot on dry land, I heard that damned voice. It had followed me. Do you know what it said?
When I set foot on solid ground, I heard that cursed voice. It had followed me. Do you know what it said? No. It said... "This is the New World.
All right, gorgeous. You're back on the job. You'll wake up in three, two, one... I decided to flee. I crossed the sea. When I got ashore, I heard this voice. Do you know what it said? It said... "This is the New World.
What's up? You're not contesting? What's the point? You have the murder weapon and you've linked it to my client. How it got there and who put it there is a subject for another day.
The Blue Sky is not filled with ice. - As Genghis Khan said. - Contrary to your prediction. "Victory does not come to him who lives by the rules. It comes to him who makes the rules, to him who imposes the rules on his enemies."
Well, now there's Khutulun and Kaidu. Wine from the silver tree. I hate this liqueur. It's peculiar, isn't it?
Hi. I wanted to make spinach pancakes and look, what he bought. And what '2 The round flour, you understand '.7 He said it seemed fine enough.
You can have them. I also want you to have this Jesus wig. - You know wigs aren't illegal. - I know they're not illegal. But I think it would look great on you.
Can you show him what you showed me? Please do. Did you see that? It's the electricity, Mom. It's playing up.
You got it? Yeah. You get any sleep? Every time I close my eyes... I keep seeing this thing. I don't know where I've been, but this place, I think it lives here.
Yeah. You get any sleep? Every time I close my eyes... I keep seeing this thing. I don't know where I've been, but this place, I think it lives here. It used to feed there.
Just trust me on this. I'll find it. It's heavy, this filth. Come on. Come on. Come on. It's upside down.
Sergeant Willis, NYPD. Are you his wife? Yes. Is the car impounded? It was just a stone's throw from the Mercer wreckage.
We've looked. It's not in the apartment. Just because you haven't found her doesn't mean she isn't. There's a girl. She looks like Jocelyne.
We live with him. You know, he can be a pain in the ass. The apple fell so far from the tree... - Oh, dear. - It fell into a truck and disappeared.
- I can do that. I'd love to. Jess, could we have another child? That idea never occurred to me. In fact, it hasn't been fertile.
So what happened to him? Banerjee is here in Simla. And I'm sure he wants to strike right at the heart of this festive picnic. He's been planning it for months. If the bomb isn't here on this map, it's somewhere else.
Banerjee is here in Simla. And I'm sure he wants to strike right at the heart of this festive picnic. He's been planning it for months. If the bomb isn't here on this map, it's somewhere else. It's very close.
I'll just... step back here. - It's heavy. - Yeah. Could we put it down? If we took the drawers out, it wouldn't be so heavy.
Do you like brownies? This must be a special recipe. - I love your house. - Do you? Oh, thank you so much. It's so beautiful.
When I played in pubs in London, she was my only audience, and she'd come and cheer me on. Why did you leave her? We've got the studio until tomorrow morning. Teach us your song. Richie said our music reflected our lives, or something like that.
Let me rearrange your song and make it my own. It's no use. He blew it up. I love that song. It's funky.
"Depending on the symbol, the attack is either melee or long-range." Adam, I have a question. I know what you're going to say. What are you going to say? You're wondering why your figure is octagonal when it's on a hexagon connected to the center.
As you can see, we've formed an impenetrable circle around you. Fernando, I'm sorry, but I just don't feel it. I don't want anyone following you around the track. Ramona is very happy here and I love living with Stephanie, D.J. and her sons. I like my life the way it is and I'm not ready to change.
That's the way they say it. In my head, it sounded like gibberish. Your first clue. "Onward to a journey of delights "in the former bedroom of the Katsopolis twins." It's gorgeous!
Why are you telling me this? There's a limit to my happiness. A limit I can't go beyond. I reach this limit faster than others. It happens even faster than an ant.
You've created a true artificial intelligence. I wanted to create a machine that would serve us, not overtake us. A computer that thinks 100,000 times faster than a gifted human automatically becomes a potential threat. Once it surpasses us, it would be foolish to believe that we have the means to control it. If a limitless artificial superintelligence saw us as a threat... It could exterminate mankind.
A computer that thinks 100,000 times faster than a gifted human automatically becomes a potential threat. Once it surpasses us, it would be foolish to believe that we have the means to control it. If a limitless artificial superintelligence saw us as a threat... It could exterminate mankind. Calm down, Mr. Pessimist. Why assume it's hostile?
Once it surpasses us, it would be foolish to believe that we have the means to control it. If a limitless artificial superintelligence saw us as a threat... It could exterminate mankind. Calm down, Mr. Pessimist. Why assume it's hostile? It could be friendly.
If a limitless artificial superintelligence saw us as a threat... It could exterminate mankind. Calm down, Mr. Pessimist. Why assume it's hostile? It could be friendly. If it had the slightest compassion for mankind, it would fight cancer, global warming and eradicate poverty with ease.
SEARCH FOR ENEMY COMBATANTS Harold, what happened? - I failed her. I failed her. - Finch. If I hadn't crippled the machine to begin with, it might have had a chance against Samaritan.
Are you going to cram everything into the wagon? No, there's no need. The car is the brain and the graphics processors are the rest of the machine's nervous system. When you were out, I used the subway's encrypted system to tap into the government's surveillance feeds. So the machine will retrieve all the information it has lost.
But of course, Grace is in Italy, so... it must be a malfunction. You haven't slept. Are you sure it wasn't you who derailed the train? Honestly, no. Let's run a diagnostic on the machine and see how it handles context on a few subjects.
No need to panic yet. [FINCH: Oh, thank God. The machine is operational. It wants to talk to us, but refuses to unlock the doors.
Please stay with us a little longer. The Machine has a loose component. â™ª â™ª John, the machine, got unstuck in time. It no longer knows the difference between past and present.
All right, I killed her. But there were extenuating circumstances. Ms. Groves, I should talk to the machine face-to-face. FINCH: The machine, I killed it because it lied.
It's just a little engine trouble. Can I see your license and registration? I'm afraid I was in such a hurry I forgot my papers. Is something wrong, officer? Well, the car has no plates, and it matches the description of a stolen car.
Capable of doing horrible things, but she chose to do good. Well, since she found you, at least. I watched her die 12,483 times in the seconds before she died. I couldn't save her, but I kept trying. You can't imagine my pain because you don't experience it the same way, but it's there.
Well, you really dodged a bullet there. If the threat is real, why doesn't Samaritan warn the ISA? I mean, it couldn't be more to the point. I don't know, but if we have his number, we're the only ones who can save him. Whatever the threat, I doubt it's in the White House.
Just a little longer. I'm afraid I can't. All right, then. Imagine your shoulder's all flabby. It can stretch.
What's the matter? I don't know. I've been working really hard. I've worked very hard. Yes, you've worked hard, but you don't know life, Alfonso. You don't know how hard it can be.
Move, come on. I've been in this business a long time. "No child left behind" is our motto. Well, not the official motto. But it's certainly mine. So, for this transition period, I'm going to have to inspect your property to make sure it meets our high standards.
- All right, then. - Crowded. Seems more crowded than when you have to work. My brother spent the night in your car. We'll make sure it's intact.
Keep going. You don't know where his attention will go. Sometimes you hope on you. Sometimes you'd rather be invisible. Because if it's on you, he sees everything.
Why were you trying to steal this from the safe in New York? Perhaps I had been employed to steal it? Maybe the brooch isn't just a brooch. Maybe the brooch reveals the secrets of every major decision made in this repulsive country. Maybe it went well with my blouse.
I'm deeply offended by that remark. And I don't see how you'll be serene sending me out there with... her, unarmed. Where's your watch? It's a wristwatch, Miss Carter. It belongs to my...
I've always been Renoir. Now I'm Baskets. - All right. - Another thing is, I think I can, you know, work on my brand, So I want to do an ad in the Yellow Pages, But I want it to stand out.
When you're a medium, you're sensitive to certain... waves. What do you mean by "waves"? It's an intuitive thing, a sensation... There's a door... It's slightly ajar.
Have a rest. Your driver's name is Salim. Better leave just before dawn. Count on a good five hours and don't worry. The road is safe, even if it's deserted.
- What's the matter? - My dick is numb. He knows you know he knows. I'm sitting wrong or an artery is clogged, but... my big dick is numb. Oh, no, it's not. It's numb?
Maybe you and I should form a secret alliance. What if your boyfriend Rick... I mean, what if Ron, the one with the muscles and the tattoos, finds out that you're secretly working with me? I'll just tell him our secret alliance isn't real. But it won't be, it'll be real.
They won't even hire me at Urban Sheik, and their clothes suck. You can start as a waitress at Margarita's. Can I? Go set the table. She won't set herself.
- He understood our plan. - What plan? To turn the gamma cannon into a bomb. When will the bomb explode? It's remote-controlled.
A little over a kilometer, I think. Would you like to walk there? Can you lend me your bike? What will you give me in return? It belonged to my mother.
You're welcome. Please take it. It's a symbol of our home. You fit right in. It's amazing. When I dreamed of Earth, it was empty.
We all have pain. Some of it is physical from injury or age. Whatever mental ... you know, living with the loss of our loved ones. If you think about it, if we fight that pain or succumb to it, the result is the same. It diminishes our lives, robs us of our passions and hobbies and damages relationships between friends and lovers.
He smells like sunscreen. I know the type. By association of ideas... sunscreen, the beach, bikinis, nudity. Yeah. No, it's just... I'm picking up a girl with this car and I want my car to smell good, not stink.
Even if its aim is to exploit ordinary people. And society. Are you for the common man? For or against, it makes no difference. History will be what it is, and we can already predict it.
I don't know how to explain it. God wants us to do what's right. Yes. Yes, of course. That inner voice that tells you what's right comes from God, my son.
"You've earned it, handsome. I'm kissing you, Dakota." Dakota looks hot. Here's the key! And she doesn't smell like shit.
Got it, you don't like it. But the good news is, we know what the killers want. Yes, the formula. That's why they robbed me. You think it's at your place?
- Money makes you lose your mind. - I know it does. Did you bring the tablet? Of course I brought it. It's right here.
Go and play. What is it? What's wrong? We fished out the tablet. My best technicians examined it. And... it's ruined.
It is. We just need to link him to Pepsum. - Then we'll turn him against Axelrod. - How's his personal life? Man, she's too perfect.
I've got stuff to do and I'm having dinner with the governor. Yeah, 'cause it's Iowa. Barry, take a break. How's our windup going? It's coming along.
- See you later. - See you. Have a great night. My jacket. It's still on the chair.
Where... they summarized the whole episode and the lessons learned. So they could move on to the next episode without a hitch. So what? Life isn't like that. No, it isn't.
And why would I do that? Because deep down, there's still a part of you that remembers that music can be magic. You're right. I can't kill your passion. I can't kill your passion. It'll live on until third grade, when you'll have Mademoiselle Ortner.
And get this... chair ball outta here. [What's going on with the meditation room? I asked one of the workers. Axe is having her reinforced in a panic room in case of a fucking attack.
As will everything you hold dear. It's beginning to unravel, isn't it? Your portal destroyed, the Inhumans you stored murdered... It wasn't easy getting this number, but this call is going to cost you. We're tracking this line wherever it's connected.
- This is the wrong video. - My name is Bruce Mindhorn. He switched it... Jeffrey Moncrief, who I'm going to kill, has the right video. It's in the trailer.
Where's the car? No! Where is it? Where's the damn car? It should be here!
No! Where is it? Where's the damn car? It should be here! It should...
Quickly. It's time for the apocalypse of justice. Baines, don't shoot. We have the video. It's safe.
I love you. What a mess. Where's the video? It doesn't exist. It's fake.
The map? Yes, the map of 19th-century Russian occultist Helena Blavatsky. It's said she used it to track down demonic presences. Well, I don't have it. But you know where it is, don't you?
She's really good at it. I can see why you want her back so badly. From vision to reflection, from light to dark, see us with your unblinking eye... and open the bridge to endless worlds... That thing wasn't human. And it wanted to kill us.
It's bad. Especially in spring. Softer, the trigger. I touched it! It won't move.
It was late, I told him, he just looked at me... and left. He came back at midnight, smelling of alcohol, sat on the edge of the bed, and took out a ring. He didn't ask, but I said yes. Then we went to bed. It must have come from a pawn store.
But because despite our problems, we are a community. A family. And that's a strength. That strength is a powerful thing. It's not invisible.
A family. And that's strength. This force is a powerful thing. It's not invisible. It radiates.
There are no more than five of them. And they disperse. Okay. Did Dad take his gun with him to Florida? No, it's still there.
- I'm scared, Raye Raye. - It's okay, it's okay. Everything's going to be okay. The storm of the century just crossed tornado alley. It's ravaging Kansas.
I want a security perimeter. Give it to me. I need an ETA on the storm. It's north of Pittsburgh. It'll be here in 20 minutes.
"Hear the workings of our intertwined lives." "Like the beat of a drum." "Hear the workings of our not-so-rosy lives" "Like the beat of a drum" "Like a capricious wave, it has ups and downs"
Ladies and Gentlemen... 8 YEARS AGO TOT The grand finale of the kite-flying competition. With Rakesh in blue and Rehmat in red. Govind, are you sure this dish is reliable? Can it survive a storm?
Sultan, a photo. The wrestler's pose! How does it feel to win Olympic gold? Ask the medal. I didn't win the medal, it won me.
My father told me that Sultan was born to fight. I'm a businessman. I came with an offer. Now I know you belong in the ring. Wrestling has taken everything from you... Maybe it will save you.
"You are the son of this earth" "Your soul gravitates between heaven and earth" "How much have you saved?" "My father told me that Sultan was born to fight" "The fight has taken everything from you... Maybe it will save you."
Old Delhi. The real Delhi. Here you'll find things you can't find anywhere else. A martial arts school has existed here for 25 years. It has trained many of India's greatest athletes.
I'm happier than I've ever been. You know what I mean. You've felt an emptiness all your life, like me. We tried to fill it, but it never worked. I found the answer... and it's beautiful.
Full. Stowed. Nico, the water. - Put your hand under the water. - Careful, it's hot.
Hey, you can't leave me here! You lied to him. He didn't let on, though. His cheating was perfect. No, it wasn't.
I rarely find anyone here to talk to about my work. I'll be back. Perhaps I can tell you about one of my riddles. You're anchored to this view today, Miss Susan. It interests me today.
The mountain was set to explode at any moment, and 70,000 people were quickly evacuated. Fear was rife, due to an event that had taken on apocalyptic proportions. It was known that in 1902, on the neighboring island of Martinique, Mount Pelée had erupted. The signals from La Soufrière in Guadeloupe were remarkably similar to those of Mount Pelee, measured in 1902. It was feared that it would erupt extremely violently, with a force greater than the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
I expected a personal response. However, personal opinions seem to reflect the pervasive ideology of the people and the leaders. All Koreans climb this mountain frequently, but each time they do, they feel a new and solemn sense of purpose, while being even more determined to serve the country with patriotism. And all Koreans sing the song entitled "Let's go to Mount Paektu". It perfectly reflects the spirit of the Korean people.
And only a man can do that. We'll bring John Glenn back safe and sound, because we have to. Because he's got to tell us what he saw. The Redstone rocket went straight up. The capsule didn't have enough speed to go into orbit, and it fell.
Shepard's and Grissom's. We need something else for Glenn. And the Atlas rocket can launch us into orbit. It ascends, leaving the capsule in an elliptical orbit. Earth's gravity continues to pull it along, but it spins so fast that it still misses Earth.
We need something else for Glenn. And the Atlas rocket can launch us into orbit. It ascends, leaving the capsule in an elliptical orbit. Earth's gravity continues to pull it along, but it spins so fast that it always misses the Earth. That's how it stays in orbit.
The capsule will continue to revolve around the Earth forever, because there's nothing to slow it down? That's right. Getting it to slow down at precisely the right moment to precisely the right degree, that's the challenge. Yes, Katherine. So, it has to go from an elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit.
The highest bidder gets the house. And a bunch of scavengers are just looking for the right deal. The bank wants its 60,000 and the highest bidder gets the rest. This house is a shithole. If you make an offer, I bet it's yours.
And thank God for Sean. He's the one who pushed me to take this loan. Oh, he's like Superman, except for the junkie thing. Does he know about Gus's ring? He knows it exists, but not that I pawned it.
That's the beauty of the mask. It's like a cop's two-way mirror. I don't know, this... That chemical plant... I quit because it creeped me out.
Please. Bless, O Lord The gifts You give us in Your service for Christ's sake Thank You. I've been thinking. Maybe we could go back to our old house. I've spoken to the owner, and she's available, if we'd like.
We should have taken my car. Like I said. Many times. It's a new car. It was new to someone.
- Up in the tower. - Okay, we got it. Let's go, let's go. The creature. There it is.
The creature. There it is. Follow me, please. There, on the ledge. It's moving!
His body is here, but not his mind. What's wrong? It doesn't make sense. The candle was supposed to be an attachment point. It should have... brought him back.
Money. He said the Doctors were there. He also said you might know what this thing is. We have a theory. It's a little scary.
What are you up to? You want out? Smash the glass. It's not just a window. It's bulletproof.
You didn't. I had to. Hello, Scott. I've never seen that color on you before. It suits you.
All right, then. I'll get your toys. Just keep the damn fence up until I get back. My witches have made a discovery. Whatever it is, Elijah clearly wants it hidden.
That I rebuilt this city in my image under my rules. I gave wedding rings to all my friends and got rid of the others. This is my city because I took it. That's what a leader does! If this prophecy you're all afraid of comes true, it will happen here, on my streets.
Can you help him? You've got to help him. You're the only one who can. Our clan's magic is black. And it comes at a very high price.
They can't... They can't fix it. What do you mean, they can't fix it? The damage to his spinal cord, it's... Oliver, it's permanent.
Maybe a part of him still is. I don't know. Get off. font color = "# 804040" Donna: The damage to his spinal cord, it's permanent.
Well, I think the answer to that question is pretty obvious. Thea's bloodlust balances an equation, she was given life, now she must take it. Malcolm, we already know that. What we don't know... What you don't know, what I didn't know until Thea collapsed, If the life she uses doesn't come from others, then it comes from the host.
I became someone I didn't know I was capable of becoming. I became the best version of myself. This would never have been possible without our love. Our love gives meaning to my life. It gives it purpose.
It's still there. Don't move! Don't move! Where's my idol? It's none of your business. She's just around the corner.
Guess who's back at the controls. It's me, Curtis, in case you haven't recognized my voice yet. Stay down, bitch! A little too direct? The bee came back to life and things got a little out of hand, but don't worry, it's dead now.
You channeled your grief and became Black Canary, but Sara is no longer dead. Maybe you owe it to yourself to pursue the path you've been following. Are you serious? This town has enough masked heroes. With Ruvé Darhk as mayor, it needs a hero without a mask.
Maybe you owe it to yourself to continue along the path you've been following. Are you serious? This town has enough masked heroes. With Ruvé Darhk as mayor, it needs a hero without a mask. It needs Laurel Lance.
Drug me again and I'll kill you, you bastard. Hello, everybody. This is Uncle Lonnie. You see, I love your little community. It's so open to outsiders, but it's so...structured.
I hope your day improves, but don't count on it. It wasn't easy, Mrs. Parkhurst, but we managed to get the nails out of your slippers. You strike me as someone who'll never be married, that's for sure. Bring me back my anti-itch cream. - Is it in the drawer?
This sucks. Oh, it's not so bad. Sometimes they let you take away the good garbage if you ask politely. Last week, I got an old greeting card. It obviously wasn't meant for me, but imagination, that's something!
We'll do a full investigation. Wade, I know you're lying to me. It was an accident. I have a little boy. This mountain will fall on you, just like it fell on your father.
Someone comes to clean and check on the house from time to time. I pay them too much. If nobody lives here, why did your father keep it? It wasn't his. It's part of the Markridge family trust.
Let's go. They said I was crazy in Vietnam. I said that's what the jungle does to a man. I knew it. The war wasn't there, it was here.
Death is like... everything. It's a deadline that makes us better. Makes us love harder. I don't know about that. I think maybe... it makes us human.
You're out of control. The office incident? Who shits on demand? I doubled my dose of beans. That tape was fun, now it's scary.
Batwing got involved all by himself. And Batwoman? Did she force you to reveal our secrets? You weren't there. Master Dick made a decision, and I think it was the right one.
- Wow. I didn't recognize you. I didn't recognize you. You've lost a lot of weight, and your... Your skin looks fantastic. It's so shiny.
This is the car I drive. - I own this car. - Yeah, you do. - Well, then... - It backs up, your car.
Complications were inevitable. - It was bound to work. - Yes, I assure you. But I need the right ingredients. Are you blaming me? I didn't mean to.
And if you're a man. And straight. And... I get it. Man, if this town wasn't filled with moronic idiots, it could be as terrifying as hell.
I'll tell you what, I... don't think of us as something past. And I never will. Thank you for telling me the truth. The truth... For a long time I thought the truth was dangerous, and it still can be, but... but now I'm starting to know that the things we think hurt can actually save us.
He wanted to tell Freya the truth, so... I concocted an alibi. I offered him 24 hours. If I'd picked him up when I had to, he'd be alive. Why didn't you? Because... what's the point of a new life if it's not worth living?
- The other was different... Damn. Younger, maybe. Just a minute! This is very important. Do you know where the car was parked? Precisely where it was parked?
- How could I not? Almost as creepy as Hive, this one. Remember us? Fitz and Simmons are working with Dr. Radcliffe to counter the effects of Hive's formula, but it's an uncertain goal. The threat must be neutralized before it approaches detonation.
I think I've found Edith's jewels. No, you didn't. No, I didn't. But I found the beach house. It belongs to Payton's grandparents.
Pass. You're often seen as the guy from that lame '90s show. Galipettes en Famille wasn't a bad show. - In fact, it was. - It lasted nine seasons.
You're often seen as the guy from that lame '90s show. Galipettes en Famille wasn't a bad show. - In fact, it was. - It lasted nine seasons. It needed ratings, so that the network could sell advertising space and the series could earn more than it cost.
Well, let's get started. Most Holy Father, I'm sure I don't need to remind you that the Cardinals await your thanks before being sent home. Indeed, it's unnecessary, but you did it. What about the tiara from Washington? Apparently, it's been shipped.
- I need your forgiveness. - No, you don't. All you want from me is compassion. Now stop making a spectacle of yourself and leave. Holy Father, the papal tiara has arrived from Washington, it's in very good condition.
And if you don't stop fooling around, I'll have to prove to you that God does exist. Let me explain something to you. Your demands might have been justified at another time in history. At a time in history when the Church was more powerful than it is today, the Italian political equation would have been forced to take your demands seriously. As it always has.
Ni mara ngapi mimi aliiambia! Huna kutumia maji, siyo nzuri kwa ajili ya afya! All that glitters is not gold. This water is dangerous. It can cause anaemia, osteoarthritis, toothache and kidney malfunction.
Not fast enough, Thawne. [I'll never lose to you again. [♪♪ This war between us, it ends now!
And I know this may sound strange, but I'm... glad we got stuck here. I'm glad, too. I have another surprise for you. - Beacon. - Waverider detected. It's picking up a signal!
Dharmendra! Clear the plates! And bring the potatoes! Did you clean the bathroom? It's filthy!
In the army cemetery. And the other wish? Before I die, I want a happy family photo. That I can hang on the wall... I want it to say: 'Kapoor & Son, since 1921'.
Nah, same old, same old... What? They all want a happy ending. What about your story? It's realistic.
The only couples that last are the ones where one of them takes a step backwards... which makes them take a step forward. I don't want us to become like... Barbie and Ken. You all done up and me with no balls. - I change my shirt, it sticks.
We've lost Ferreira. This is his last letter. Lost? Why should we? This letter was sent during our trip from Portugal. It took years to reach us.
I can't allow you to do that. How can we abandon our mission? Your mission was to get news of Ferreira. You have it. Forgive me, Father, but this letter, although it tells an atrocious story, says nothing about Ferreira himself.
Thank you, Padre. Padre. The doctrine you transmit may be true in Spain and Portugal, but we have studied it carefully. We've thought about it for a long time. And we conclude that it has neither use nor value in Japan.
Padre. The doctrine you transmit may be true in Spain and Portugal, but we have studied it carefully. We've thought about it for a long time. And we conclude that it has neither use nor value in Japan. We conclude that it represents a danger.
And we conclude that it has no use or value in Japan. We conclude that it represents a danger. But we believe we bring you the truth. The truth is universal. It is true for every country, in every age.
But we believe we bring you the truth. Truth is universal. It's true for every country, in every age. That's why it's called truth. If a doctrine were less true here in Japan than it is in Portugal, we couldn't call it truth.
He'll give us the missing ingredient, I promise. Otherwise, you may never find it. I guess you know what this is. It's a Hand of Glory. A mystical candle, once lit, it will let me open any window.
Esther cast the spell. You died with vampire blood in your system, came back, fed. Then you became vampires. So... the heart of the bond must be blood. If there's a rift, it has to be blood.
Ma'am, I don't see anyone in these photos, much less a Farell. Deputy, if I go to bed at night and there's no snow on the ground, and I wake up and see a carpet of snow outside, then I'm convinced it snowed. Well, fill this out. File a complaint, get yourself another one. And in the meantime, if the other shoveler reappears, it will reappear.
I grew up in the shadow of these hills. It's like a part of me. I mean, of all of us. The Cherokees said it was cursed. They called it the "Blood Mountain", claiming it had evil powers.
- You can't have it! - Go on, take it! He can't have us both! Asa Farrell's soul is special. It's as black as coal.
They have one to three bedrooms, new appliances, carpeting, eco-friendly toilets, and top-of-the-line security systems. I'm not sure if you're interested, but Sally-Ann might be. She could use a home, don't you think? So you're going to let us live in this house? It comes with the job.
Yes, just a minute. Let me have that. I'm thinking of selling the house. - Why are you thinking about selling it? - It's old.
It was a lie. But... whatever was in that box meant a lot to her. Maybe there was something inside that could help us track him down. Where can we find this box? I think it's still in the loft.
But I have to protect you. Protect us? What do you mean, Jonas? Are you drunk? It doesn't matter where the soul goes... what matters is how it gets back.
I didn't even have time to talk. I love you. I had so much to share with you. But don't worry. We'll be together soon, and you can be whoever you want to be. Don't ever give up. The important thing is not where the soul goes, but how it gets back, right?
I said, rock, what's the matter, rock Can't you see I need you, rock Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord All that day I ran to the river, it was bleeding
Can't you see I need you, rock Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord All day long I've been running to the river, it was bleeding I've been running to the sea, it was bleeding
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord All that day I ran to the river, it was bleeding I ran to the sea, it was bleeding I ran to the sea, it was bleeding
I ran to the river, it was bleeding I ran to the sea, it was bleeding I ran to the sea, it was bleeding All that day I ran to the river, it was boiling
I ran to the sea, it was bleeding I ran to the sea, it was bleeding All that day I ran to the river, it was boiling I ran to the sea, it was boiling
I ran to the sea, it was bleeding All that day I ran to the river, it was boiling I ran to the sea, it was boiling I ran to the sea, it was boiling
Power Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh, I ran to the river, it was boiling
Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh, I ran to the river, it was boiling I ran to the sea, it was boiling
Oh, yeah Oh, yeah Oh, I ran to the river, it was boiling I ran to the sea, it was boiling I ran to the sea, it was boiling
Now, Miss Lance. I'm in position. Your turn, Mr. Snart. Since the introduction of our latest batch of autonomous police officers, violence has dropped precipitously. In fact, it's non-existent.
- How do you know? - I just know. Look around you. This city is a sewer. It stinks, it smells like shit, and I can't get the smell out of my nose.
Good grief. Why are the Yakuza digging? Give me the flashlight. Did she hit bottom? Tell me when she will.
I swear to you. I've heard all about you. News travels fast around here. But there were at least 100 shooters that day, and every finger found a trigger. Your crusade, it'll never end, will it?
But at the same time, you have to let your heart speak, don't you? Otherwise, what are we fighting for? Frank was humming an awful ditty. He'd heard it on leave in a children's program and brought it back to Afghanistan, where it was a veritable epidemic. It affected everyone like a virus.
Others pour blood into the streets to stem the tide, the crime, the cruelty... the disregard for human life that surrounds them. But this is Hell's Kitchen. Angel or devil, rich or poor, young or old, you live here. You didn't choose this town. It chose you.
Then the world can find someone better than me. I trust us, I trust Firestorm. Well, let's sleep on it. Come to my office tomorrow, and if your answer's still no... It will be.
Your money. Well, well, well. Let's see my impostor's face. The resemblance is uncanny. It certainly isn't.
Did I come on too strong? How did you... ? What the... ? Lucifer, what are you doing? I'm finally focusing my anger where it belongs.
I know. But I put the album on tour. - Jorge and I have been club-hopping. - Who does? Who? Why, if we were letting them go? Their song, Kill the Lights, is brilliant.
It's the foundation of his personality. - What did you lose? - A cigarette box. I threw it away. It was full of junk.
- What did you lose? - A cigarette box. I threw it away. It was full of junk. It had great sentimental value.
Get Stephanie Dunn in here. Do you really think the person who killed my husband also killed that Tamika woman and her baby? A third man was in the car the day Reese died. Find the gun this time. It's connected to Daniel Price.
Gray found out what we were up to and asked us to stop. - Why did he do that? - Eavesdropping. If Gray, an experienced prosecutor, had mentioned the presence of an unidentified accomplice, she would have made a nice gift to the defense. I'm glad we found the murder weapon, but it doesn't bear the owner's name.
I'm going to go undercover and hunt down Reverend Price's drug dealers. Can I use the numbers on Tamika's phone? Yes. Yes, I'll continue with the analysis of the heroin found in the car. It's much more valuable than I thought.
Goldman also came for six other dealers. Steph, if you could find out who called Goldman on these cases. There's one problem. The motel drug was cut with baby laxative, not cornstarch. So it doesn't match the heroin in Tamika's car.
No. No. She often did as she pleased. She'd just never lied to me openly. Maria may have found a way to phrase her decision so that it seemed less drastic than it really was.
Wait, I'll find it for you. Gideon read it in the Count's memoirs. Here it is. "The Ruby, Born Raven of the union of two, Will live forever. Its star decays when tormented by love and its fall is freely chosen."
"My back doesn't hurt as much." We were worried about your 3rd lumbar, we're reassured. It's crazy, and it's true. As much as I love movies like this, I've never seen a smaller version of my dick than when I'm at the doctor. It gets so small, and it goes off to the left.
I don't get it. I don't get it. It's not near a window. There she is! Look at it. It's locked.
He's nowhere near a window. There she is! Take a look. It's closed. There, it's open.
There she is! Take a look. It's closed. There, it's open. It's closed.
Oh, God, no. No. What I'm saying is, you're not alone. Funny irony they didn't tell you about, Magic isn't obtained with talent. It comes with pain.
Please, not that song. Ah, sorry. What was that, Penny? Oh, that song, please don't. It goes into my head and doesn't come out.
And on my campus, you're under my rules. You're very close to violating rule number one. Respect your principal. It's the most important rule. That's why it's number one.
I'm calling Georgia. - What are you talking about? - What are you talking about? My car! It's not here!
- You must be mad at me too. - I am. All right, then. That night didn't just happen. I wanted it to happen.
Who separates jackets from pants? Excuse me, pure coincidence, but... this happens to be my jacket. I saw it first. In the store, yes, but this... this jacket is from my closet. You can see it goes with the pants.
If I'm arrested, I'll use a false name. Your name won't be a problem, half the family's seen you. We'll wait until they leave in the morning. The woman will leave the briefcase and we'll go get it. - Yeah, but what if she's not there?
Please help me. It's based on pure science. India has one of the most specialized flavor profiles of any cuisine in the world. - You don't like Indian food? - It doesn't like me.
I thought you'd be older. Ah, sorry! Anyway, you're spoiled for your 1st day with us. Just to remind you, we're in the big chapel. It dates back to the early 14th century.
Is it here? The disease spread so quickly, with any luck they didn't have time to send it to Washington. It looks like a small generator, about the size of a bread box. And it's not a black box; it's actually orange.
It's my destiny. So, yes. It's a suicide mission for me. - If the mythology is true. - It is.
Seven days. Seven more days and the levee burst. The government exhausted its resources trying to contain the infection in Washington, Atlanta, Dallas, but it spread to 20 other cities, then 50.
I intend to become King of Norway! To become King of Norway, you'll have to defeat my husband. That was impressive. I've modified the French weapon. It has a better range now.
It's not my intention to give you that impression. You should know that I'm carrying Rollo's child. Life is strange. Let me drink to the honor of the first child... born of the Franco-Viking alliance. May it live on.
He said they were the greatest threat to his empire. My grandfather, wise as he was, great as he was, didn't understand everything. Times have changed. But the threat of the Scandinavians persists! Of course it does, poor Roland.
Why would they lie to me? Is there anything else you've learned from the head of Ecbert County? What else? It was about your father's farming colony in Wessex. We asked if it still existed and he laughed and said it was razed to the ground as soon as he set sail again.
No. agreement. Arthur and I put together every available photograph that was downloaded from the accident. The images will progress every five seconds. You'll be able to see each car in relation to Marie's vehicle. The minivan moving up just before it ran us off the road.
So come on. Sell me a car. The interior is designed to give you total control. Everything is where you want it. It handles well.
You're going to a lot of trouble for a simple piece of misinformation. Unless you want to look at them -Send message? -If I get close enough, I can memorize the settings, the markings on the machine, -how it works.
Your wife will wait. Certainly, Brigadefuhrer. Retreat? The generals agree. The mission has accomplished all it can for now.
If her neighbor threw a party, it would cheer her up. - A Babe party? - Babe party. The ultimate party. She won't be able to top the last one.
They're right. My meeting didn't go well. The NRA is going to fight this tooth and nail. Of course, and the bill may not pass. It will pass, because you'll support it until both houses vote for it.
According to the State Department, which apparently keeps track of such things, the tribe is taking part in the Mousseum of Sidi Mohammad Ma Al-ainin, an annual gathering of Tuareg tribes that happens to be taking place in Casablanca right now. The Tuareg are nomadic traders who still cross the desert on camels, setting up camps wherever they go. They are famous for their goldsmithing and their beautiful indigo-colored clothes. The blue dye they use rubs off on their skin, and over the years, that's how you recognize them.
That's the Irish. I know them well. Scrub all you want. The shit's not under your fingernails. It's inside you.
It's broken! I'll call an ambulance. All we've got is an image problem on our hands. People need to understand that this outrageous photo is a violation of your privacy. We can't prove it's real.
Do you know where to go? Where did you go on your honeymoon? Positano, Italy. You'll love this house. It's very spacious.
I present myself as someone who knows your worth. I've come to offer you wealth, power and more pussy than you've ever had. Whatever the pussies are, we're not interested. You and I could own this whole town. If I were interested, I'd own it already.
Μais you compromised it at the audition. I knew from the day I attacked you in a fit of anger that it was ruined. And that the eventual trial would only be a long ordeal, with a predictable outcome that would put me in an even more humiliating position. So I decided to leave it at that and accept my fate. Μbut I wanted an official record of the truth to remain. I wanted it to be recorded for centuries to come. Just in case, one day, someone might take an interest in the facts.
Your pussy's on the fritz. What's wrong? I've read about it. It's very common. Your cat's depressed and fed up. If she could talk, she'd growl like Marge Simpson.
Hmm. Seriously? Who are you? Mm-hmm. You'll get used to it, honey. That's it, the countdown is on. The weapon must be deactivated before it destroys the server.
See it, then do it. Huh? You're too late! It's the weapon! It's jamming the signals.
Really? That's crazy. - Great quiche, Mom. - Thanks, honey, - but it's bland.
No need for hydrogenation. - It's antioxidant. - Inhibits cancer cells. Super texture in the mouth. No taste or smell.
When I was in Afghanistan, I lost a lot of friends. So losing Jay, I know how you feel. Questioning yourself. Blaming yourself for his death. And that guilt, it can destroy you, but believe me, you have to control it, or it will tear you apart from the inside.
When I started out, I was a man of science. I believed that truth could only be revealed through experimentation and proof. I no longer believe that. Now I wake up in a cold sweat, convinced that a deeper truth has appeared in my dream. If only I could hold it before it fades away.
I just want to be left alone. When did you start drinking tea? I thought you were "black coffee, two sugars" for life. Nothing's for life, son. Life changes, it surprises you, it bites you in the ass.
Without more time or resources, there would be a risk of ABO incompatibility reaction. to the antibody serum. His body may reject it. What then? She's already dying. Thomas' particular strain of the virus may be lethal, but it's less devastating than the previous strain.
Chris surprised me one night at home. He told me to go away. I doubt he'll say the same today. This... War. It steals our children's childhood.
As I am Ganesh or the Minotaur. We're half-human. Ripped from the pages of a bizarre mythology, with our two sides, the human and the Crown, fighting a fierce civil war that knows no end. And destroying every human transaction we've ever had as brothers, as husbands... as sisters, wives, mothers. I understand the agony you feel, and I'm here to tell you that it will never leave you.
Great. A manual. Who has gears these days? I just realized, we could have taken my mother's car. It's probably still in the garage.
Where? It was earlier today, in fact, when I was running to take Hartley down. Uh-huh. You're just mentioning that now? I didn't know what it was. I thought it was some kind of illusion.
... not even cute... How's it going with Peri's video? Have you learned anything? Just that Peri loves talking about herself. She's nine hours long.
- What is it? Is the tide going to rise? No, it's Mediterranean. It's just a small tide. - I checked, it's going down.
- Wally, wait. Let him go. We had a deal. My speed for Wally's life. Let him go, and she's yours.
Please be quiet. So I can concentrate. Wake up, man. This town is ruined because of you. It used to be peaceful and normal.
That's where they put us all. Who's "they"? A branch of the federal government. Don't try to find it. It doesn't exist.
Is he for real? I don't know. I guess it's better to believe in monsters than to know the truth. Yes, because you can always convince yourself that monsters don't exist. Reality isn't what it used to be.
He's loyal. Like a dog. We had a deal. My speed for Wally's life. Release him, and she's yours.
Right there with the rest of the shipments. Hey, yo, tell your boss, next time, if we don't get all peach vodka, I'm finding myself a new distributor. What the hell's going on? Upgrading the crib because it's technically mine now.
Everyone behind this desk is entrusted with something far more fundamental: the survival of our nation. As President, I must face the storm. That storm is terrorism. More dangerous than any hurricane. It has threatened us abroad.
As President, I have to face the storm. That storm is terrorism. More dangerous than any other hurricane. It has threatened us abroad. It has threatened us at home.
This storm is terrorism. More dangerous than any other hurricane. It has threatened us abroad. It has threatened us at home. And it places James Miller in the greatest of dangers.
- Well yes, but that's the problem too! - Just think of Ginette. - Ah, you're a cellar-dweller! Well, you're going to have to come up with something, my boy, because Geneviève, she's got a lot of pull. She'll come up with a solution.
I'm the one Jingim married. This is my baby. You found a way to take her from me. Find a way to give her back. If she were still flowing, pouring arag, beer, wine or mead, no warrior could stop me.
Fortunately for you, the RD180 has been withdrawn from the market because of sanctions against Russia. If this goes on long enough, Western stock will run out just as you put your engines on the market. Unless the war ends before you're ready. Russian engines would return and Pentillion's efforts would be in vain. Your stock would plummet. I don't know how you learned of Zolotov's pacifist mission, but you thought it would thwart your ambitions, and you had him killed.
You know Keith? Tell him to clean up his mess. That's Keith for you. Do the grownups a favor. Go find your shadow, will you? It was here a second ago.
Do you know Sextina Aquafina? - I work for her. - She's so cool. Her music makes me feel strong. Like I'm capable of anything. Doesn't she hurt you?
It was built during Prohibition. It leads into the tunnels beneath the city. Did you find out where it leads? There was this big door. It looked like it hadn't been opened in hundreds of years.
When Milo gets home, tell him to call me. And don't worry, Lex, I'll find your car. What does she mean, find our car? She saw the rental keys on the table. - She asked where it was.
- She asked where she was. - What did you say? - That we'd lost her. - Why did you say that? I didn't know what to say, so I said we didn't know where she was.
I'd put down a deposit on an apartment, which I'd lost. It was a bus company, I had the opportunity to get out of the shit after Kayla and all the other crap that happened to me, and all I needed.... Watch out for the open sewer. You know what we should do? Go sit in front of the embassy and wait for it to open.
We're innocent! - We're Americans! - Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Milo left us this villa. It belongs to us, but you can have it.
No big surprises like another restless soul. You'll return to a life of luxury and privacy soon enough, once you're married to the Prince of Spain. Will I be invited to the luxurious party? There won't be one. It would be in poor taste, as I've recently become a widow.
You've been tense ever since Lord Narcisse became regent. I have something different to take your mind off your aggravations. The servants told me it belonged to Prince Don Carlos. It was found in his room after the accident. It would be burning in the fire if I hadn't retrieved it.
Not that I don't like having someone in the house when I come home. It's that I'm worried about you. I know you've been scared since that night in Greer's tavern, when you were in the same room as the murderer, but you're safe now. Sir, an anonymous letter has just arrived. It's about the murders.
He starts thinking of that murdering bastard as his father because he's a liar... Someone in this school is filling his head with totally inappropriate ideas. Do you recognize this person? It's a woman, not a guy. Our Clare thinks she looks like Miss Wealand, your new assistant.
There's a lot of stuff. Looks like we got the trailer back. ♪ ♪ There's something about that lock. It's bigger than it's supposed to be.
Are you going to accept that? Today is all about proving you can behave. No need to sulk. I won't harm your precious town. It has sentimental value for me too.
I let my brother drown so I could save myself. Is that why you see him everywhere? Because of a false version of your brother being upset about something you did in a false reality? The stone is trying to tell me something. It's trying to prove something.
There you are. You didn't think you could get rid of me that easily, did you? My dear friend, I'll always be there for you. Now, please, put that horrible photo away. It commemorates a night I'd rather forget.
What? A mistake? Yes, probably. But we can't prove it. - Technology being what it is and all.
I need your help. You owe Jacob Marley a debt. Why do you come here at night to see him, instead of at his home or business office? Because this meeting is secret. I want to keep it secret.
Your father gave it to me when I was 9. He said it brought good luck. - I can't take it. - Keep it. Until I get back. Maybe it'll bring us both luck.
Not until I've exhausted every avenue here. Sorry to drop in unannounced, but one of my investments is in a shipping company. My geography is sorely lacking. Mr. Pocket mentioned that you have a fine library. Yes, I'd be delighted to use it.
Is this the kind of thing you were looking for? - It's useless... - You were right. I wouldn't have chosen Marley or any of the other things in my life. If you'd known famine, you'd know that it never leaves you.
We have two victims in the same neighborhood in less than 24 hours. This can't be a coincidence. It isn't. Look at his watch. It's on his right wrist.
Look at his watch. It's on his right wrist. So he's left-handed. Look where the blade handle is. It's in his right hand.
Hear that? Then the electricity doesn't come out of the generator. It doesn't reach the power lines. Exactly. It just disappears into thin air.
It seems the CDC has a new piece of information. All right. Well, aren't you supposed to wear masks or something? Aren't you supposed to wear masks or something? The bacterium turns out to be non-transmissible. It seems to feed only on electrons found on inanimate sources.
What is ... ? You think I'd go back to that shit without bringing some heat with me? Grandma, don't do that... Bastard, asshole, piece of shit... - Every time I get a bar, it disappears. - Just keep trying.
Every man has a flaw. My husband's was that he was weak. Characterless. But yours is only that you see what you want. Your vision is 10/10, but it can't see where the truth lies.
And I was nervous to meet him. And he was going to kill me. Even if he had known you, it wouldn't have made any difference. The rules are there and he firmly believes in them. Your biology saved you, it gave him the chance to know you, to love you.
This is certainly uncomfortable. You did this to me! Are you trying to get me killed? I saw her head! It was right there!
You did this to me! Are you trying to get me killed? I saw her head! She was right there! And she gave me that look.
The nurse in charge knows nothing, and Nurse Fields has no emergency contact in her file. How much longer can we keep the clamped liver before it gives out? 10 minutes, max. Check his leg. It's very hard.
So, Sienna, what's frustrating you? What would you like to change? My diet. What about your diet? It doesn't have to be perfect, but my body and my health deserve better.
Relive each of these moments of gratitude. You may feel a hand touching your head. If so, keep the same state of mind and let it intensify. If not, you'll still feel the energy. It will be inside you.
It's a beautiful house you have here. It's yours, Uncle Stan. Don't you remember? Not even a little? No, but this chair hugs my ass like it remembers.
The church didn't even exist during the Fourth Crusade. But it's the closest church to the one on the map. So we must have made a mistake. We need to study the map again. This map isn't even to scale, but it clearly shows that a church stood here in the 13th century.
- I can handle it. - Of course you don't. When do you find time to sleep? How complicated must your life be? Not as complicated as it's going to get?
At the end of this service, this captain will be downing tequila shots. You should join me. I don't think I should. I've given up having men in my life for the time being. You know, I'm just trying to avoid complicating my life any more than it already is.
What a name! When you move the mouse... See what my hand does? Look at my hand. It moves like this.
They're yours now, honey. There's no Ben upstairs. Thank you, dear. Loneliness is a dangerous thing. It can turn you into someone you don't recognize.
And now she didn't even react when he wrote to her. She's protecting him. She's not. Sorry, I don't want to have the same argument as last night. In case it ends the same way?
And I bet you haven't found anything. Well, we were hoping you could help us, Mrs. Tedder. Besides Carol, who else lived there? Well, it wasn't her house, you see? It belonged to her lover, Greg.
She's back. She's back. She's back. Do you want your reward? Come over here. We can make our house exactly the way it was.
But of all the Bureau divisions and units that make up the NYPD, it is Patrol that is the backbone of this department. It is Patrol that has the ability to prevent crime before it happens.
Why did you do that? I wanted you to know the truth. And what exactly is the truth? Our relationship didn't end because of Mike. It ended because I'm not ready to face what was wrong with me, and I don't know if I'll ever be ready, but ...
I'm not the one on trial here. No, you're not. You're the only one in this chair, so why don't you answer the question, or we can stop all this right now. There's no trace of me living there because I sublet up there when I had my place here. So it's possible that someone doesn't have a Boston address without it, which means they don't go to Harvard.
Between Seoul, Moscow, Beijing, Shanghai, it would have been a month and a half. I cancelled it. I wanted to bring you something. Oh, Raymond. What good is a collection if it doesn't grow?
The analysis confirmed my fear. The placental abruption caused amniotic fluid to leak into Liz's bloodstream, producing a severe inflammatory reaction. Are you with me, Liz? I'm going to put you on a BiPAP machine. It forces your lungs to expand and helps you breathe, okay?
loingtain... The rage you feel... We're all feeling it. - The waves of energy are somehow... - But with me ... it reaches deeper.
I want to know if the teleportation room is secure! Smith! Is the teleportation room secure?! It is now.
- Is that it? - Don't be vulgar. If one of us spills the beans... This story... It's destroying your students.
- Don't be vulgar. If one of us throws things... This story... It's destroying your students. - It's destroying you.
What are you talking about? - The van's gone. - What's gone? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Where was it?
I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! It's true that bad things happen. No more so than in the past. But today, when a crisis erupts, it does so in a digital echo chamber that repeats and amplifies the problem.
There's a house on Woodside. Northeast corner of 72nd and 48th. Someone will be waiting for you there. He gave me an address in Woodside. It wasn't Hobbes, a different voice but... it sounded familiar.
It paralyzes skeletal muscles. A sufficiently high dose blocks the diagram and causes death by asphyxiation. Leaving an unharmed body for the assassin to work on. Exactly, and I want to see his first victim, John Lavin, the guy from Tallahassee. If the killer made a mistake, it will be on this body.
Billy Joel sings the hymn. I can't go with you. What can't I go with you? I thought the investigation was over. It is.
For God's sake, Judy, stop the charade. It's the heart that chooses. And you're telling me your heart chose her? Does the huge age difference surprise you? Well, it's not that big.
That chili thing makes me cry. That's it, that's it. It burns! You've got to be kidding me! I've been looking for that church door for ten minutes, and it was in your pile.
Do you know where your family is? How serious are her injuries? She has a few deep cuts, caused by metal or glass. We vaccinated her against tetanus as a precaution. What does this picture mean?
You saw him kill Sadie. No, Roger, I just thought I did. Memory's a funny thing. It doesn't like a vacuum. So it fills in the blanks.
How about a villain? Deal. No, don't do that. What are we going to find on this tape? We were told it was here, weren't we?
Wyatt told us he never takes his eyes off his gun. Is that true? Hilarious. This guy loses his gun all the time. It was landing in vans, toilets, cutlery...
One more time. I beg your pardon? You ran away, but it's all right. I took a picture. It's beautiful. Would you like to see?
We're all Negan. What you want is impossible. But all is not lost. Just go home. Burn that car. Sink it in a lake so it disappears.
She doesn't know if I'm saying "Ça roule?" Or, "What's up?" What are you going to do? I'm going to make her a mortal coil! She'll speak for me!
You'd take her hand, tell her she should cherish every moment because life is too fragile. You should start enjoying every moment. Two years ago, Dr. Reybold told me I had bone cancer. He said it would be tough, but we'd get through it together. The kind of chemo he gave me eats away at your bones.
Make room, boys. Welcome, welcome. I'll be damned. I never thought I'd live to see my son with such a bushy beard. It's not bushy.
Welcome, welcome. I'll be damned. I never thought I'd live to see my son with such a bushy beard. It's not bushy. It's fine in these conditions.
I'll be damned. I never thought I'd live to see my son with such a bushy beard. It's not bushy. It's fine in these conditions. And it looks good on you.
Maybe he was going to come back, fix this place up and retire here with all the money he made selling all the top-secret files he stole from under your client's nose. Billy hasn't done anything yet. He may be flirting with the Post, but he hasn't stolen or leaked anything. So what? So that information isn't out there, so we still have time to stop him before it is.
I need to show you something. The Author's feather? I thought you destroyed it. I did, but it only brought him here. The apprentice told me where it was.
Jefe, it's Delta! I miss you, baby. Just look at him. This car had never let him down in war or peace. It was everything to him.
I miss you, baby. Just look at him. This car had never let him down in war or peace. It was everything to him. It didn't even have a CD player.
- Naughty girl. - You'll have to punish me later. Jill and I have a very special relationship. Tell me about the show. I hear it's great.
You're welcome. In Baja California lies the town of Rosarito. To the southeast, there are hills. On these hills stands a house. It has food stores, gardens, a well and reinforced concrete walls.
Don't ask. I'm not the CEO. There is no CEO. Obviously Jack's empty chair is a better choice than me. Ask the chair instead. See what she thinks.
I'm not fired. It doesn't make sense. I didn't read the article. Too busy making one hell of a tech. It's not mediocre, but downright revolutionary.
Mr. Peanutbutter, use a napkin. Don't shake it off. - This sauce is so sticky... - Don't shake. It's dripping all over me.
- You're doing 80 in a 50 zone. - Damn, that's true. I feel so alive. This letter is so explicit. It talks about their magical nights at the villa in Ojai.
It was in my car! Oh, right, right. Since I'd driven so much, I ran out of gas. I had to fill up. At the pump, I realized I didn't have my card. It was on my desk because I had contributed to my friend's silly Kickstarter campaign.
Is that how balls work? I don't know, it's a work in progress. Professional integrity. "Our relationship no longer has any professional integrity. So it must end.
Shit, man. I... I... I deleted a photo, but when I clicked on the album again, the icon reappeared. It came back by itself.
It's a promising compression company that doesn't pay very well. - Did you send him the beta? - Yes, I did. Are you fucking insane? Cause I've been testing it all day, and it's pretty great.
- Did you send him the beta? - Yes, I did. Are you fucking insane? Because I've been testing it all day, and it's pretty great. It's full of bugs.
Okay, I did a quick count of your assets and liabilities. Jared, don't look at me like that. Just give it to me straight. I won't. Your house has appreciated in value since you bought it, but if you sell it now, for what Zillow and Redfin think it's worth...
You might have... killed him? Would I? Looks that way to me. You took the gun out yesterday. It's been repainted with his brain.
In an instant, everything you think you know changes. The ground shakes, then it shifts, and suddenly you're falling, praying to God there's someone there to catch you. There wasn't supposed to be any surprise. I know. But based on the size of the tumor and how aggressively it invaded the sinuses...
She hung up on me. And now he took the last craft beer, which he said he didn't even want. That bastard. I'm so mad at him. I'll drink the last weird beer, Even if it tastes like shampoo.
Spoons are so much better than knives. - On the floor! - You don't want to... You should try it... This spoon is really fun. It's better than the knife.
You'd go through hell here. You'd all go through hell. It's unthinkable. There is another solution. Let's break the loop before it starts.
You're out of line, Maureen! You're screaming so loud we can't hear the TV. - What's going on here? - We're having a family discussion. It's over now.
Yes, it's true. It's true, it's true. But you were right. This town is in trouble. It needs help.
Damn you, Eugene! Hello, Cynthia. Miles Person. I'm sorry, but there must be something wrong with my mailbox. It's empty and then suddenly...
Jesse, it's important to set an example for others to learn from. Come to church tomorrow. You don't leave a Christian after that. - My father's land. - It's yours.
My aunt used to teach me to recognize stars. I'm going to get us out of here. No. Justice has finally come for your friend. Pray it hasn't come for you either.
To hear you say that, to hear it now... I brought you some more pig's blood. Don't worry, nobody saw me come in. I don't know how much longer I can hide this masquerade. My pregnancy isn't visible yet, but it will be.
- Narcisse. What are you doing here? - I hope you don't mind, but we took the liberty of searching your apartments, which are our apartments after all, having been lent to you as to our guests. Did you find what you came for? You may not know the hand, but you know the man it belonged to.
Trust issues. Yes, I noticed... Was your mother a hunter, or a witch perhaps? No, but her father was part of some kind of secret organization. It's disbanded now.
See, ladies and gentlemen, what I told you? And we were together... alone... the night Red Killeen was murdered. That's why I know he didn't cover up any crime. No, I'm not wearing my wedding ring anymore. I don't even know where it is!
I think I can tell you where that ring is. She sold it to me... in exchange for taking her to Settle. She was looking for her boy. He'd run away. She's in a store there.
Not S.A.R. Just madame. - Madame? - Or Madame la Duchesse. Why did you choose this house? It has 80 acres of parkland, a guarantee of discretion.
- Box. Every day, the monarch receives a red box from the government. Official documents, topical issues requiring royal assent. This was the last box I received as king. It contained the documents for my abdication.
"The almost saintly reverence that the people show to the Crown is a fact, as the recent coronation showed." "Few countries retain such reverence for their monarchy. But are these centuries of deep respect coming to an end? Can this veneration endure in light of the cruelty of the royal family towards its members?" "The British royal family has survived a thousand proofs that it is artificial and superfluous, and seems to have lost none of its hold on the loyalty of the people.
"Few countries retain such respect for their monarchy. But are these centuries of deep respect coming to an end? Can this veneration endure in the face of the cruelty of the royal family towards its members?" "The British royal family has survived a thousand proofs that it is artificial and superfluous, and seems to have lost none of its hold on the loyalty of the people. On the other hand, it is unlikely to survive the clear evidence that it is insensitive and cruel."
I'm going to the station before my dance class. You can't go to the station like that. They'll laugh at you. When are you going to stop worrying about what people say? When I look in my suggestion box, it's full.
I was in a cult once. It was called Avon. So you were so sure I couldn't make friends that you had an escape plan? Every now and then my negativity pays off. Every once in a while it leads me to the mall jail.
I know, but some small bones are still missing. The phalanges of the fourth and fifth fingers, and fragments of skull bone. Bertha may have struck again. Do you think the rain has temporarily flooded the scene? If there was enough water, it might have washed away a few bones downstream.
in two words. "Water... falls...", OK. OK. "Water falls" Water falls from the steamy air. It falls like hair.
It falls like hair. falling on a young girl's shoulders. Water falls, making puddles in the asphalt. dry mirrors reflecting clouds and buildings. It falls on the roof of my house, It falls on my mother, and my hair.
Nothing. A bug in the system caused by the core damage. Tell him. What is it? The attachment... it released itself from the system and reappeared... some kind of bug.
No one came for the books. Nobody cared. Until winter, of course... when the fires had to be fed. Then you saved them. Humanity did for its words what it could not do for itself.
We have no choice. Calculations are Dr Adler's specialty. He could betray us. I had him detained. So did Dr Railly and Mr Ramse. Betrayal is terrible because it's committed... by our friends.
If a thief manages to get his hands on it, he'll be forever recognized in the world. Many thieves have tried to come to this island to steal it, but so far, none have succeeded. I was finally able to get a spare key from Tesoro. A key? It's used to open his safe at the top of the Golden Tower.
The surveillance system surrounding the entire launch site makes this virtually impossible. Fuel. This is the last thing loaded on board before lift-off. If the fuel can be diluted before it's pumped out, the rocket won't have enough thrust to get into orbit. It will crash harmlessly into the Pacific, and it will look like a simple failure of the fuel mixture.
The rocket is an immobile, self-contained object - nothing moves around it. Walter really does have the base's classified frequency from when he synchronized his computer upstairs. It would be simple to use it to hack into and loop the signal from the cameras. Surprise interrogation, show-off: there's a rocket with bad fuel. If it launches now, it'll crash into the Pacific.
Now... for the final stage. She wields the weapon of judgment, the one that thirsts for the blood of those who torment us. Bind her spirit to this sword. This blade draws vampire blood. It will guide you. It will help you destroy them.
Armando Vega... That's a mustache. - Why don't you leave yours on? - I've tested it, it grows funny. You should call your moustache Ana because it won't fit on a man to save his life.
- Of course you can. You women can't resist touching it. Go ahead. Why doesn't it come off? I know it's fake.
I've been stuck here all day. Now I'm going to that bar! The last thing I need is another delay. Where's the chainsaw? It's right over there.
You're wasting time, Doctor. 4 more rebel houses cleared today. Yes, madame. How's the operation going? He says it will take hours.
just above. So don't rock the boat here, no drugs. Not like last night. Got it. Bathroom's over there. Shake the flush if it leaks.
I believed it once. - I'm not falling for it. - I'm not kidding. Apparently, there's a photo of you being hoisted out of the ravine. It's all the buzz.
- 8 months on bail... - Were you absent the day law school taught the concept of judicial immunity? It protects you from being sued in a professional capacity, not a personal one. This crusade will cost you. It will cost you so much.
Are you saying that the manual authorizes the school - to withdraw funds from the newspaper? - Yes. Above all, Illinois Park is committed to the protection of individual liberty. And Miss Stowe's editorial failed to take seriously the life experience of Palestinians nor that of individuals on Park campuses. I don't expect a school like Park... nor sincerely, any university... to use the fact that it's a private fund to cut short debate about how it treats its students.

Although, technically, it can.
You don't know Grover Ogden, but he knows you. I'm not paying you to screw around, Vince. What's the delay? The shredder won't start. It's clogged.
Wasn't that in Underhill's file? Yes, it was. Her DNA was a perfect match to the DNA taken from Mina's toothbrush in 2004. Curious, that toothbrush... It disappeared at the time of the test.
I'm fine with it being published, so whatever you told your editor, tell him to stop. It's fine. It's fine. You sure about this? I read the sequel. It's better than the first volume.
Yes, and why was that, Sid? Why was I briefly dead? I told you I didn't feel well. - Aren't you going to let go? - Like when you dropped the sword and it flew out, to puncture my torso killing me briefly?
There was no kitchen knife? No ? That's a shame. I've got a potato. It's very sharp.
It's time for war! Yes. War. We should reach the royal observation zone. It's over that hill, away from the fighting.
Nick isn't here you need to get out of here! Now! Did you just... I saw the safe house. It's got, like, a steel-reinforced door and a mailbox with the name "Thompson" on it.
Bar fight. I signed the register and there were a bunch of security cameras. It's not gonna be hard to check. And where was your car? As far as I know, it was in the garage.
You invented an energy drink? Callen and Sam did. Ah. Yeah. It's not legal in the U.S. yet, but it's a huge hit in Eastern Europe.
Corpse spasm. The deaths occurred violently, intensely. That's why his hand is wrapped around the phone. The battery's dead. See if she has the virus.
- Good afternoon. This is Mrs. El Mansour. * - Hello. - I bought you a black dress. * Yes. - I wanted to know when it would be ready.
* - Yes. - I wanted to know when it would be ready. * - What's the name? - El Mansour. * - It will be ready late this afternoon.
A mini-computer, now called a "packet switch". It's a... tough military machine. Indestructible. It's designed to last, unattended, for years. This machine is very ugly on the inside. How beautiful.
It's a... tough military machine. Indestructible. It's been designed to last, unattended, for years. This machine is very ugly on the inside. How beautiful. It has a unique smell.
Exactly. You just mentioned something called "the law of large numbers". The law of large numbers asserts that a large unpredictable number of players, or messages... behave collectively in a very predictable way, in a way that we can deduce with precision. And so, network performance is only predictable if it is vast. The power of this technology has multiplied by a million, in terms of computing speed, communication rates and storage capacity... Within a decade, it could multiply by a billion, or even a trillion.
Team Ensco's robot-style buggy, Dexter, came out of the starting blocks with the wind in its sails, and fiercely attacked the desert terrain. Kat 5, the Ford Escape hybrid from Louisiana's Gray Team, literally raced through the crowd, and Terra Max, the 16-ton cargo transporter, took off at full speed, determined to finish the race. Driverless cars are developing fast. Today, we no longer see huge radar installations or tons of equipment. The main aim in building this car is to make it look... completely normal, inside and out.
The telescope discovered the black hole in our galaxy, the Milky Way. At the Visitor Center, you can spin coins in a funnel that simulates a black hole. The coins disappear irretrievably. If there were a civilization like ours on a nearby planet, we'd certainly be able to pick up TV stations, or maybe even radar... God knows what. This collection zone covers an area of several hectares. It's able to pick up an enormous amount of signals, at enormous distances, but having traveled so far, they're so weak that... normally, they contain much less energy than the energy of a snowflake falling to Earth.
He made his fortune with PayPal, builds Tesla electric cars, and is currently building the world's largest battery factory. After a few setbacks, he is now successfully trying to launch rockets. For the first time in Earth's 4.5 billion-year history, we finally have the chance to replicate life on another planet. As far as we know, life exists only on Earth. Chances are it exists elsewhere, but we have no proof.
I think any insect is extraordinarily... superior to today's robots. Let's consider cockroaches for a moment. They can... scurry across the floor, they can avoid danger, they can find food, they can reproduce, and they can live independently for many years. Robots are still a long way off. In fact, I think... it would be great to have as many abilities as cockroaches. I can't even imagine artificial intelligence developing spontaneously on the Internet, but I can't say it hasn't already happened. Because... it wouldn't necessarily reveal itself to us.

The real risk is not that artificial intelligence... will develop a will of its own, but rather that it will obey the will... of those who decide on its usefulness, its optimization function.
Do we really want to do this? I think we're living in an incredibly creative time in human history, not only technologically but also morally and culturally. This room... needs to know I'm here. I should be able to talk to it. It should be able to answer me. Orally.
She should be able to answer me. Orally. For example, I'd ask where I could find a printer. Where did I put my keys? Where is a certain book? And she should answer me... using speech, a hologram, a screen... in a very natural way.
Where did I put my keys? Where is a certain book? And she would have to answer me... using speech, a hologram, a screen... in a very natural way. I could gesture to her, touch her... even use smells, all my senses, to interact... in a human way, using the technology that surrounds us. Once this technology enters our physical world, and becomes embedded in our walls, in our office, in our bodies, in our fingernails, in our cars, in our offices, in our homes... it should disappear,
We have a vocabulary, the brain has a vocabulary that we're just beginning to discover. Here, we need a $2 million machine that weighs 7,250 kg. The question is: in the future, will some genius or biophysicist invent a little cap or helmet that can do this? I think it's quite likely. Electromagnetic energy is already here. It's already here.
Maybe he's hiding a scar or an injury? He looks confident, like he belongs there. He's hiding in plain sight. That confirms he's using a ruse. Yes, but we don't know what it is yet.
Are you kidding me? Come on! All right, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Boss, this thing is sentient and loyal only to its master.
This is the end of the pages. Nothing has happened. If Martin killed the Beast, would we be here talking about him? But here's the thing. What Martin didn't know was that he'd fail to find the blade, which would remain hidden for decades, so it could still be somewhere waiting for us.
Please, no books on the floor. I love this one. Pictures of unimaginable places. I know you hate them now, but travelers wrote our best books. The bookstore is what it is because of them.
- If you want to know how to lie to anyone, whether it's your mother, your boss, a torturer or the President of the Republic, you need one thing, and one thing only. Knowing how to lie to yourself. How did you find out about Sciences Po? - Information circulates. It's not classified.
Why not? With my crazy side, you never know when I'm serious or not. If I'm preparing a rave, a rap concert or a study for Westinghouse or Toshiba. Is this study commissioned by a foreign firm? No, it's commissioned by my father at the request of a foreign firm.
Have you taken care of the cameras? No, not yet. Miss Bennett... I wanted to make sure Ferguson got the shower she asked for. She's taking it this morning, while
We have to be more careful. Why aren't they here? The Flame offers protection, but it's getting weaker and weaker. Can you get up? My father's watch, it works.
Can you come back later? Who smokes marijuana here? I have a prescription. - Let's take a look. - It's in my car.
I didn't kill my wife. I loved Ali. I've always loved her. I would never hurt her. My leg... it's broken.
No, I didn't. It doesn't matter now, because I like the way things turned out. I like it too. And I think you're even more beautiful than this rose. The last time I saw my grandmother, the most exciting thing was watching the ash from her cigarette lie and wondering if it was going to fall into her pudding.
There's no room for manoeuvre here. And it's clearly marked on the outside of the case. Legally, you can't touch it. There has to be a way. The only way to open a diplomatic bag is if you think it contains a corpse.
Her name could very well be on all your trophies at the end of her training here. But she desperately needs to learn a little humility. Did you find anything at the autopsy? Yes. The bullet burst when it hit a rib.
A few weeks ago, Flanagan found out I joined the academy. He ordered me to be his girl on the inside... his mole. Threatening to expose me if I didn't. And ruin my career before it even started.
And took all the herbs. - We need them. - Unfortunately, we're all out. This herb is rare for a reason. It has strong anti-magic properties and is therefore anti-witch.
Are you dreaming, Elliot? You're looking so much like you've never asked yourself that question before. I said, do you want to be here now? And I don't mean here, here, I mean here in the cosmic sense. Existence can be beautiful, or it can be ugly, it's up to you.
We've got them all. Every relationship is a power struggle. Some of us need to be controlled. Once in a while, the best action to take is to follow the line of the barrel. Stare at the road ahead and hope it takes you somewhere you want to go.
If Malotru's gone to catch up, it means we've got an agent on the spot, who could be described as a renegade if this goes public. Do you agree? - Who's the fuse, then? Disturbing music... Disloyalty is a cluster bomb. It does unsuspected damage, long after it's been dropped.
It had been less than 48 hours, so no official investigation had been launched. That changes everything. One other thing. Mrs. Cruz had a scratch between her thumb and forefinger. It's the kind of wound usually associated with the slide of an automatic weapon, because it catches on the skin when it goes up.
Don't worry. I'm sure we got it. - We cleaned it up. - No, I left it. It's not here.
I'll see you at dinner. You can be my sister. What happened? My wand. What about it? Isn't it magically protected?
He's not talented. Sure he is. Last time, you lost your watch in there. No problem. It's waterproof.
I don't know. Then what did he say? That he had to think about it. I know he did. Maybe it's the midlife crisis, but... I was just starting to think about my life, and what I want it to look like, you know?
The kids are here. Chambers must have them. Anyone else on board? I'm spearheading a new learning technique. Until I'm sure it's viable, the invitation list for the station is very exclusive.
We communicate according to a schedule. It's never early. Communicate about what? John, the data sensors have located Arkyn's transmission. It overloaded the main memory and was rerouted to Classroom A.
Olan barely escaped with his life. When did the overload take place? At the same time Red 17 was shut down. Guys, I think I found Khlyen's last transmission. It's in Olan.
All that to say, it's like a hot potato. You have to keep passing it on. Otherwise, you die. Melissa, this curse started with you. And I think it wants to end with you.
We're hunters. Hunters? All you need to know is that we save people like you from things like this. Even if it's not a shapeshifter, it still changes form. If we can figure out what it is, we can figure out how to kill it.
Come on, Sam. Nell, talk to me. There should be a door on your left. There is. It leads to a balcony, but from there you're on your own.
There you are. There we go. Why didn't you show me this house? It's got everything I want. I forgot it was for sale.
I forgot it was for sale. You're the agent. I remember now... It's bottom of the range. Seems pretty solid to me.
Hi, there. This vacation beard is really starting to take shape. [It's starting to trap food.
Just a moment. Hold on a second. This necklace... The rose... does it have a sapphire?
I saved your life, anyway. I guess you could say that. Where's the video? It's safe. I want it destroyed.
They arrive, more jealous than I expected. We have something to celebrate. It's a big night for both of you. Caroline, your movie's getting made, and Max, I found your sock. It was under my refrigerator.
I leave for... five minutes, and he's married again... to someone else? So he can make a commitment, but not to me! I'm such a quiche! You're not a quiche. You came up with the dump truck idea, and it's brilliant.
Mike, I found the solution! - Oh, my God! - What? The coin! I know what it goes with.
- I don't know that for sure. - Believe me, I know. Why don't we find another place to continue this conversation? I have another question. It's not on the questionnaire.
I'm the Savior. I have magic. And I'm the Lord of the Underworld. That should tell you something. Ambrosia is powerful, and like a spoiled little child, she wants all the power.
The cannibal witch has cast a spell that's keeping us here. Let me guess, she got it from Hades. It was a ruse to trap us in the Underworld. - The ambrosia... - It wasn't there.
Hurry up! Come on! Come on! I'm sorry there's no other way. When I bought this jacket, it was supposed to be armor to protect me from being hurt by those I love. But now it reminds me that I have to protect the ones I love.
- How can you be sure you haven't lost it during one of these breaks? My backpack is equipped with a charger. When I'm not working on the device, it's always plugged into the charger. Did you take the tablet out during the after-party? No, it stayed in my bag.
I'm with the CIA. We checked it out. We checked it out, but that doesn't mean it's true. Callen, does my voice sound familiar to you? Should it?
So let's do it smart. The cryptex... led us to the poison, and the poison led us to the antidote. but there was no clue to the antidote. The clock was part of the solution. maybe... it contains the next clue.
It's my job to give her love and support. That's how I get her to the audition. As a cop, do you think I can get someone to do something by being kind and encouraging? Of course you can't! Listen, I recently found my cop voice, and it's very effective.
And thank you. It's been enlightening. ANTHONY: Erin, I understand what you're saying, but maybe... You wanted in on the investigation, it is what it is.
Right. Time to go. We're looking for a way to get rid of a mystical mark. That's right, we are. It links me to a madwoman.
It hurts me to see you like this, Stefan. It really hurts. Because of our connection, I can feel what my targets are feeling. Like when Matt freed me at the Armory. As soon as I touched my sword, I felt what it did to you.
Of course, they didn't break any of those annoying windows. Gratuitous nastiness. I've got a picture here so you can see the pattern. Warning. You learn exactly what a blade can do before it cuts you.
There are two key questions, and we wanted to answer one before answering the other. What we said about Tahan was true. We wanted to eliminate prejudice and emotion. What's wrong with emotion? - It clouds judgment.
What we said about Tahan was true. We wanted to eliminate prejudice and emotion. What's wrong with emotion? - It clouds judgment. - Or it clarifies it.
I could try, if I wanted to die. What are you doing? You've got the oxygen tank from the stretcher attached to the side compartment. That's how I like it. Does it bother you that it can fly everywhere?
He's in freefall because of the ranch. It's a time of crisis. Did you say you were a beaver? It has to do with the totem pole. In fact, the base of the totem pole is the most important part. It holds it together. It's all in the base.
The system is there and it's just waiting, Motionless, like a machine, waiting to be tweaked while you watch TV on your fat asses. If everybody woke up tomorrow, and said, "We're not spending any more fucking dollars, "or voting for any more candidates, or starting any more fucking wars until we get justice, this shit would change tomorrow. But it won't, and the rulers knew it.
Surprise! Oh, my goodness! This is just one example of how terrible birthdays can be. Now, can we please drop this topic and talk about something else? I suggest, "How thick can a soup get before it's a stew?"
When you selectively start enforcing the law, the bad guys selectively start obeying it. This is really quite catchy. But what about the ordinary citizens who make up our district? Madam President, I came to defend a policy I believe in and you came to challenge the basis of that belief, so if your law passes, the press will say you won. If it's rejected, they'll say I won.
I see... - But when? - Soon. They're... They're going to rent their house, but it's for sale.
He'd started to explain stuff to me, but his office kept beeping him, so he had to leave. But it didn't look good. Necrotizing fasciitis is what people call "flesh-eating bacteria," but that's a misnomer. It doesn't eat flesh.
But it looked bad. Necrotizing fasciitis is what people call "flesh-eating bacteria," but that's a misnomer. It doesn't eat flesh. But it spreads very quickly.
Now we know which way the car went, life will be easier. All right, then. Lydia Bernstein had been in Cancún for the last ten days. Her car was in the long-term parking lot at Midway. She didn't even know it was missing.
- Yes, it is. Wait a minute. The serial number says it was made in Des Moines, Iowa, - in 1995. - 1995 ? Yes, it's 21 years old, and landed in your shooter as recently as a year ago.
Hold on. The serial number says it was made in Des Moines, Iowa, - in 1995. - 1995 ? Yeah, it's 21 years old, and landed in your shooter as recently as a year ago. Where's it been all this time?
Shoot, I got the wrong number. - I'll call you back. - Can I have my car back? I'm waiting for a part. It's from a 1983 DeLorean.
- Is it him? - No! I didn't want this promotion. Don't touch me. There's nothing wrong with feeding your family. She's not home.
Dirk has always disappointed the family. Your wine. Next! Your car is ready. I can't guarantee it'll make it to your place or that it'll run.
It helps me feel confident. - What is it? - A red flared dress. - It's in my closet. - You're kidding, right? It's cute with booties.
What's a key? - A key. - What's it for? My family home in Maine. It's great, private, near the sea. It's empty, no one ever goes there.
My father bought it because Martha Stewart wanted it. She'd gone out of business. He was furious. Your family doesn't have an ordinary life. It's yours.
- This is me talking! You should be ashamed of yourselves. - Look at this catastrophe. - Thank you, sir. All she does is sigh, whine, and forbid us to park in your spot, even though she's near the door, unlike the others.
If anyone has another point to make... What about the buoy shack? Seriously, get a room. What about it? It's broken and unusable for the summer.
A bunch of conservatives from... Not helping. Beth has a stage 3 leiomyosarcoma in the retroperitoneum. There's no sign of metastasis, but we have to remove the tumor. It surrounds her inferior vena cava, compressing it and reducing the blood flow to her heart.
A good husband. Please pray for us. Whoever did this should be before God and judged. I can't imagine losing a loved one and hearing about it - on a social network. - PicThread removed the photo, but it's already viral... it's all over the internet.
Fresh tool marks. The bolt is loose. I'm guessing... this is the device that lowered the gate. We've got a cellular antenna. It's possible it picked up Joel's phone when he approached here.
Because in Brody Nelson v. USA, Avery is the USA. How odd. Riley has a second mailbox. She's logged on to it almost every day for the past two months, but it's empty.
All the e-mails were sent from the same e-mail accounts. And ... this IP address looks legitimate. Okay, no proxies? No evidence of identity theft? No, she didn't even scrub the e-mail heads.
I can't find anything... Your approach. What's wrong with my walk? Nothing's wrong with your walk! It's great!
I have the forms. I haven't done it yet. To be honest, it reminded me too much of him. My grandfather loved this gun. But it worked well enough, so I decided to keep it in my glove compartment.
I'll take the call. Eggs Florentine. I modified the sauce slightly and... spiced it up. - I hope you like it. - I'm sure it'll be great.
I know it seems pretty small for me to bring this up, but you said you'd handle it, and that makes me anxious, so I thought I'd make sure. The washing machine. I got it. I ordered the part online. It'll arrive tomorrow and I'll fix it.
Nobel Prize-winning engineers and physicists. I'm a fan of their work. Not everyone knows, crazy party people. Just before their publication announcement, they throw a big party all night long. As someone with an insight into these great minds, do you think I could get them to leave the clock where it is?
It seems I came here for nothing. Earl, I know you still think this can't be fixed... It doesn't need fixing. There's a brand-new pulley in it. It's not the model I would have used, and it had to be tightened, but it works.
Gloria's Arms is the store that sells the semi-automatic used to kill my client's daughter. My condolences, sir. The poster is protected by the 1st Amendment. No, it's defamatory. We want it taken down.
Shut up, both of you. It's all right, it's all right. I brought food. Here you go. It's not much, but it'll make you feel a little normal.
When and where it was bought and if it's local. - Dress history. Understood, sir. - Thank you, sir. I just don't get it. If this isn't her dress, whose is it?
No, you don't! Jesus, Norma! I just said we'd go tree shopping with you! Did you know Norman had this letter? It's to Emma, from her mother.
They put it on hold. There seems to have been some kind of... thaw. See you tomorrow, bright and early. The husband is a real womanizer and the wife's dyspareunia seems psychosomatic. It started when she discovered that her husband...
And don't say it's what you want, I know it is. My mom helped me out a lot. She... stocked our fridge. And you should see the bedroom. My dad painted it, and it's perfect.
I'm lonely... I'll even ask Barton to come back to the clinic. He's always been there in my life. Like family. And since our family isn't what it used to be... and...
It's perfectly normal to have bloodstains. You told the nurses that you had problems with your eyesight. I was seeing black spots and I had a migraine. I think it has something to do with your blood pressure. It's within the norm, but I'll check it.
One last thing... I know. I type up the week's interviews, bring Betty some food and get the photocopier fixed. Did you make a copy of the Clavermore file? - It's in my office.
Just me? What about Art? What about the people who hired you in confidence? You know as well as I do that sex therapy is exploding. It's evolving very fast.
Some three to four thousand new chemical compounds are created when meat is cooked. So it's a more complex food. And that usually means more flavor. When you grill a food, most of the energy actually comes from infrared radiation. It comes from light, from the glow of red embers.
I had a tiny bit of weed. - I had a little bit of weed. - And Mom lost her... - Careful. - ...stuff. I'm impressed with the weed here. It's incredible.
Yes, Mrs. Park? This ring belonged to my mother-in-law. I kept it for Joon's future wife. Let's make it official, shall we? It's so beautiful.
- The ring's in your drawer. - Yes. What are you going to do with it? What do you mean, what am I going to do with it? It's in my drawer.
It's in my drawer. - Will you bring it back? - Do you want me to? - It probably cost a lot of money. - Yes. And it's useless in your drawer.
One day, she wants to stop. Another, she doesn't want to stop. - If it goes on like this... - It's a lot of work. She didn't want a ring on her finger, so why bother? Because it's sitting in that drawer like a loaded gun.
That you weren't afraid of anything. Was he lying? This bundle of cash didn't come from a bank. Why don't you start by explaining this troubling detail? It's not mine.
Let's start again. Forget the last one, okay? - Okay. - Just relax. I'll just let the camera roll so it gets everything.
This is war. Yes, it is. How's Laurel? There are worse places than this prison, I can send you where you won't see daylight for the rest of your life. I have an inner light and it shines.
He is. Treat him with respect. He's earned it. Trust me, okay? How do you stop the strike before it starts?
Did you have Lola followed? Your spy has read the letters, learned their code, written a letter from Mary. Your understanding of espionage is impressive. You used Lola to link Mary to this attempt. So that, even if it failed, it would become personal between Mary and Elizabeth.
Because it'll come here anyway. Sir. Marburg spreads through the bodily fluids of infected people. In crowds, it could be highly contagious. If this epidemic goes unchecked, it will arrive quickly in populations like Maroua.
Well, now that we're starting afresh, can we finally get rid of that awful duck paint? - No, Louis, we can't. - Why can't we? Because it's like you. I can't stand her, but she's family.
So Jared killed his client with a post-workout smoothie. Except Jared could have gotten away with it if he hadn't asked Andy for help. And what about the other can of vanilla protein powder? Very Vanilla. It looks good at first glance.
- I can hear you. - But you can't hear the phone. - Maybe the ringer's off. - No, it isn't. Aspiration. Sometimes the ringer's been off so long you forget it's off and need someone to help you figure out how to turn it back on.
I mean, Cinema Paradiso, right? Are you telling me the diapers were Marlene's idea? Yes. But don't worry about that. I've got another winning idea, and it's all mine.
Looks like she got us. Back to the human back-scratcher hand. Turn around and I'll scratch your back with my hand and a piece of wood. Tell me which is better. I'll hold up my hand so it looks dead.
What's up? What's going on? I got your message. It's my grandfather. He's trying to steal the magic from Storybrooke. It made me realize how bad it really is.
Every time we look like we could be happy, the magic comes and destroys everything. - Is that what you really think? - That's what I think. In case you two forgot, magic took my dad. And it took Violet's mother.
- Is that what you really think? - Yes, that's what I think. In case you two forgot, magic took my dad. And it took Violet's mom. And I don't know what I'd do if it took either of you.
We're conquering the world! Now I'd like to welcome on stage, singing for the first time since his dance with the Angel of Death, my son, my offspring, the incomparable Jamal Lyon! Listen, these are really difficult times right now. So many bad things are happening in the world. I wrote this song, which means a lot to me, so I hope it speaks to you.
Saeed! Busy morning? I had to take the car to the garage. - I thought it was new. - It is new.
I don't really see any good in it. It's... it's there. And the good has been fighting to get out for a long time, but it never could. Until now. The flower... it's from the vine you pruned in the garden.
My name is Henry Mills. and I need your help! My family's in danger, but we can save them with magic! I know how crazy this sounds. But magic exists. It's all around us.
And I know how hard it is. I once gave up believing. But I was wrong. We need magic. It can make the world a better place.
What's this? I think it saved Monroe's life. He was bitten on the arm. The wound healed. It's completely gone.
It's 70 degrees outside, but it's cool. It was Derek's blanket. I always hated this stupid thing. It's so... It's not soft.
It was Derek's blanket. I always hated that stupid thing. It's just... It's not soft. It's not warm.
I've always hated this stupid thing. It's just... It's not soft. It's not warm. It doesn't have a nice color.
Thank you for your time. I'm gonna head out. So, in case anyone gets really hurt, you can stay in your room if you want. It's clean.
These GPS coordinates correspond with these axes. Give me everything. Here it is, in order. How far away is the Chinese frigate? Sir, last time, it was 15 km from the James, close to the other ships.
I know his conscience isn't clear. Do you know that? It's not a bad thing. It's even a good thing. It would be a bad thing if it were clear.
The kid's got a date. Good for him. Would you like to see my room? Uh, Mom? Ted? More than anything. It's upstairs.
They're not good Samaritans. Roman's men. They've come to finish what they started. My belt's stuck! It won't come off!
- but I did. - Excellent work, Jax. - What's going on? - I'm putting us on a collision course with the torpedo. With any luck, it'll hit us before New York.
Jaqobis will be too dead to complain. The killjoy dying in a gas accident might be convincing too. You know, I never liked you. Why don't you die? Your bomb, will it work?
You lying little bastard. What makes you think he's lying about that? Look at his neck. See that little love bite? It's fresh.
I love it. But I-I don't want to do this alone. Why don't you take some lessons? I was hoping you'd say that, because I've already got my license and bought a motorcycle. It's in the office garage.
And who's Abby? Colt's ex. Colt, it's your son. The window's broken. It only opens 10 cm.
How did you guess? I have kale in my garden. Next time we'll smoke some salad. Your trailer's as good as new. In fact, it's even better.
You've got it all. I'm 70 years old. I don't know how much time I have left. I want to live under the same roof as my wife. I like my life the way it is.
Let go of me! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! I've got an idea. Get in the shower. It's big enough for both of us.
- Move over! - No! I brought it back for you. You're right, a gun is a signature, I wouldn't want it found in my house. The watch I gave you. It didn't fall off the truck.
You have your friends, your loved ones. And above all, you can count on your family. Family is what we say to the seriously injured. Family, like a band-aid. Sorry, I shouldn't be telling you this. But my family could explode, because I'm not exactly where they expect me to be.
- The third one. - The third. Ramani will never agree to come out. - What if you file his list late? - It will be invalidated.
- Promise what? - Promise. I promise. I lost the watch you gave me. I was wearing it last night, I thought I'd put it in my box, but this morning it was gone.
I don't know what happened. I blame myself. Oh, boy. All right. All right. All right. You know I love it. It's the best gift anyone's ever given me. It's probably in the bedroom.
The mermaid? You played with a mermaid? Mom's friend has a siren in his car. I was supposed to turn on the big light, but I accidentally hit the siren. It was really loud.
Knife. After we fix the JD-X. Threat warning. Since when do you keep food here? Uh, since she started disappearing around the house.
Just to say. I love this town. Likewise. How did this tradition start? Some believe it began with slavery, a long march to the cemetery outside town... Singing, dancing, remembering loved ones, forgetting their suffering.
I saw some of Krieger's men studying a map. This must be where Krieger intends to make the exchange. Nate overheard Krieger talking about trading something called the Askaran Amulet. Hitler has long amassed ancient artifacts like this. Maybe he wants the amulet because it transmits some kind of occult power.
This sword, what did you say your surname was? Yamashiro. Thank you for lending me your son's armor. I'm sorry I bent it a bit in battle. So it served its purpose.
The bullet has lodged itself in several of the Dr.'s vital internal organs. How can this be? He's made of steel! This was no normal bullet. It was made of a dwarf star alloy.
And you two can help me? Actually, there are three of us. Pleased to meet you. I'm Malcolm Merlyn. The new outfit is good, but it needs Cisco's modifications.
That's all very well, but we've got to get the register back, otherwise the story's ruined. Knowing that your plan was an abject failure, someone else should think of a strategy. Let me guess, you? Let's hear your brilliant idea. I don't have one, but it'll be better than yours.
- Particles! Look H.R., I know you're trying to figure out how to help the team, I get it, but this... Let me stop you right there, B.A. - Okay, don't call me B.A. ... - I can make S.T.A.R. Labs the home of the scientific community it once was, and win people's trust back to boot.
Well, by all accounts, in fact, she's taking it pretty easy on him. Thank you for taking the time. Thanks for giving me a chance to explain my opinion on the matter. Well, I said I'd give you a month without any negative headlines. The clock is ticking, and it's ticking for the other thing too.
It's without doubt the greatest discovery of the last 50 years. I need your expertise on this. Of course you do. See these grooves? That indicates it was made of earth, unlike the metal ones that were so popular in the '40s.
Why should I be jealous? You've been looking for King Solomon's tomb for over 15 years. We spoke to the dean of your department. He told us about your obsession. How it ruined your marriage and almost destroyed you.
We must have used a lot of deodorant. His nephew lives overseas. Very motivated to sell. So, the best bathroom. Needs work but has great potential.
Run away! Like you did when she was dying! So, now that I'm sober, I'm able to take care of myself and keep a job and pay my bills. In fact, after a lifetime of riding the bus, I just bought my very first car. And then she started having all these problems, and...
In fact, after a lifetime of taking the bus, I just bought my very first car. And then it started having all these problems, and... I just don't know what to do. Why don't you take it back to the dealer? It's still under warranty.
No answer. I'm sure everything's fine. I'm not so sure. You didn't see what I saw. This conversation Lou was having, it was pretty tense.
It's Aquino. I guess Garavito prefers to be alone. Wait, where's his hand? It's right here.
Who is Jason Putnam? My name is Jason Putnam, and I have a confession to make. In the past year I've worked as a private financial advisor, and I've embezzled over $800,000. The majority came from elderly clients whom I thought were less likely to detect fraud. Jason Putnam posted this video on his profile three days ago, and it's gone viral.
No more teleportation, hero. Give me the wheel. You don't have any magic left. Did you notice? She must have died with Régis.
Giving a future to those who want one is priceless. You're not afraid, even though the future is dark. If you are sincere, perhaps you are worthy. We give you our light. Know that it will leave you at daybreak.
The cancer should respond well to hormone therapy. But I'm already on hormones. You have to deprive the tumor of estrogen. I can't stop taking estrogen. There is an alternative, but it involves greater risks.
Dr Jenofski's? I just saw his TED talk! Yes, you did. Back to Penny. What were you telling me about your company car? It has heated seats.
Who is it, Mom? Who is it, Mom? You know this picture. - Yes, I do. - It was pinned up in the hallway.
I always wondered if you'd run off before the breakage. There was no heist. You know that all the accounts of the previous campaign were rigged. If I remember correctly, 13% overbilling. Even if your house is shabby compared to your dreams, you can pay for all that.
I don't like these photos. Who did the color grading? [Adrien] I prefer this one. You don't look like a young wolf, you're smiling almost naturally. No, Adrien, this one lacks a bit of nerve.
But since the target was neutralized, the mission was a success. And the well-timed sniper shot was buried. Clearly, it was someone on the inside who had leaked the details of the operation. That's why I conducted an unofficial investigation. All my agents were cleared. The leak didn't come from MI6, it came from NCIS.
Melon spoon! Is that a bread maker? From... Schmidt's mother. "Cece, this bread machine couldn't be easier to use. It's got a button.
- That's no problem at all. - Step into my office. Let's have a look. A dead fern? If you water it, it'll come back to life.
You scum. I'm sorry, but they made me! They said, "Where's Christy?" It was your voice. It was very threatening.
Good heavens! Really? Just for a piece of brass? Mmm. This brassware isn't exactly like yours, but it's not so dissimilar.
One of my friends goes back to Afghanistan all the time. And he prefers this gun. Were you there too? You have to use the forge to strengthen the blade. It has to be thin enough to cut... through, but not brittle.
I feel God's light on me. Yeah, I'm sure you do. I was just about to call you. Hot sauce? Yeah, it's in there.
She'll be starting first grade next year. It's dangerous here. I was thinking... before she started school, of moving to a better place. I saw your car. It's nice.
Pizza's here. Can I open the door? I just ordered it. It'll take a little time. The pizza's here.
But your wife doesn't understand that. There isn't a picture of me here. We have a picture of you. She showed it to me. It's inside somewhere.
I'm very sorry. I was insensitive and rude. Does Alfred know you have this car? Why should I tell him? It's mine, not his.
Your guards have agreed to a long meal. Do you know where they've taken Alice? But it won't be long before Barnes finds out and sends in the cavalry. How did you find me? She also told me that if you escaped my surveillance, she'd kill me.
- You do now. Because you know the price other people will pay if you don't obey. I don't know what I'd do if I lost you. This connection. It keeps me sane.
Because you know the price other people will pay if you don't obey. I don't know what I'd do if I lost you. This connection. It preserves my sanity. It always has.
What do you think of what Julian said? I know all our villains pretended to be our friends, when in fact they were evil, criminal bastards, but... If he's lying, he believes his own lies a lot. And this box? Scary.
I know it's hard to believe, but you have to accept what's happening to you. Don't you want us to be together again? The stone. It's the key to everything. It can change people.
- God. You look just like her. One of the last victims. She said the island fed us. And when it didn't, her faith was shaken.
Uriel's body is still there. But Azrael's blade isn't. I do believe that the Angel of Death's weapon is in human hands. Let's recap: in human hands, Azrael's blade wants to kill? It demands to be used...
I do believe that the Angel of Death's weapon is in human hands. Let's recap: in human hands, Azrael's blade wants to kill? It asks to be used... - to accomplish its purpose. - Humans are more... suggestible than we are, so it whispers in their ears, asking to be held... She chooses any reason to
You'd like to help, Maze. No, thank you, Maze. Let me remind you that I have a job. And let me remind you that this blade doesn't just kill humans. It also destroys celestial creatures, demons included.
- when did you change? - Now, more than ever, I know that humanity and divinity don't mix. This... this blade, Luci. This blade was the last drop. It shouldn't be there.
You'll like it. You won't get a better offer. You won't? Tell me the offer. If it's good enough, I'll sign right away.
Tell me the offer. If it's good enough, I'll sign right away. I don't have any contracts on me. Put the offer on this napkin. It's binding until everything's settled.
If it's good enough, I'll sign right away. I don't have any contracts on me. Put the offer on this napkin. It will be binding until everything is settled. But I'll sign it if it's good.
Read this. It's part of the user agreement for the connected TV that was in the office with Jacob. "Please be aware that anything you say can be captured and transmitted to a third party when voice control is enabled." So when you listen to your TV, your TV listens to you. It just doesn't record your voice.
It's part of the user agreement for the connected TV that was in the office with Jacob. "Please be aware that anything you say can be captured and transmitted to a third party when voice control is enabled." So when you listen to your TV, your TV listens to you. Only it doesn't record your voice. It reduces it to a data stream, which I'm now inverting to recreate the content.
Prepare the meal. I'm not your cook. Sir, to keep you informed, our spies in the Pacific States have had access to a top-secret report. The resistance car was recovered from the site of the massacre where Karen Vecchione was. The Kempeitai believe it came from the hideout at Haut Chateau.
And they will counterattack blindly. And fear will spread. Fear changes nothing. Fear changes everything, Frank. It changes everything.
You're right, Onoda-kakka, but where there's power, there's revolt, whether here or in Manchuria. Kakka, could we discuss the films again? You don't understand Kido-tai-l. We are perceived as weak. If a nation is seen as weak, it's because it is.
And the truth is, I think it's better than ours. When the music plays, our daughter has trouble falling asleep. Maybe you should go and see her. If this music can turn the heads of made men, God knows how it can turn the head of a 13-year-old girl.
Hey! OK. Thanks for your time. The photo of the kid, it's a dead end. It doesn't match any missing persons report.
- You could say that. - Good morning. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. The Tower of Vortigern... It sealed Merlin's fate with Pendragon.
Did you tear this book in half? What are you, the Hulk? You want to know something about the dress. All right, all right, all right. It's white.
I should have told you before but... But Jess... says it's... It's beautiful. It's great. And that it just needs a finishing touch.
Why did you tell her that? Well, because, look, I know how much this dress means to her and I... I think, together, we... God, I can't even look at this thing anymore. I can't get over how awful it was.
I know it's not easy. I appreciate you making the trip. We've got a lot to talk about, so let's cut to the chase. Is it possible that the explosion hit them? If it was that powerful, no one would be here.
Now, as your President, I humbly offer my sincerest apologies. The president's remorse. Since the release of this statement an hour ago, St. Louis seems to have remained confined, with no comment or additional info to back up the president's statements. In these uncertain times, I will continue to follow this story wherever it takes me.
Amateur, more like. I got a science degree at Birmingham University. I was there more for the clever girls. Don't worry about the radioactivity. It's at a super low level.
You just want to be yourself. Precisely. I kept the outfit just in case. Do you want to tell me more about this transmission? The erasing function prevents eavesdropping on past transmissions but neglects fragments of data.
In the meantime, it's in our interest to stay put. We'll be fine. Don't you ever get tired of being wrong? Electus discovered that some people on our planet had a genetic mutation. It caused an increase in what they called A.C.P.
He doesn't seem to be afraid of contaminating her. There's very little risk. You have to live with it. Life isn't perfect. But it's pretty great.
Something to bring us home when we feel lost. If we're lucky, someone will give us a method, and we'll follow it. If not, we'll have to find our own. Pablo's enemies had found their own method. And it wasn't pretty.
Thank you for your time. You saved me a trip to the bar. A little inter-agency cooperation. That's a joke. It is funny.
Thank you very much. And welcome to the very first Grand Tour. Thank you very much. Now, we hope you like our tent. It's the best solution because it can travel around the world, we'll have a different view every week through this fake window.
I went back to "Le Pas droit" and unleashed the 370 horsepower of the turbocharged 3L in-line 6. It's not as fast as an M3 in a straight line, but everywhere else... it's much better. It feels less heavy, less clunky. And thanks to the unique shape of our "Straight Pitch", I can tell that the steering is less... It's less nervous.
Be quiet! Let's reveal P1 time. We're off. - Oh, dear. - Where is it?
I'd love to, but I've got bridge. Before you go, could you check my printer? I have a hard time printing important papers. - Of course, of course. - It's right over there.
It's too big. People don't like retro chic anymore. They can't renovate it. This table is absolutely beautiful. It's not retro chic.
Does this seasoning look like fine rain? - Yes. - No, it doesn't. No, this salad is drowning. It's floating on a sea of dressing, like little Kate Winslet in Titanic.
Apparently, you do. Some people think we need to talk. What's there to talk about? You're guarding kryptonite, J'onn. It could kill me.
What's wrong, Shekhar? What's wrong, Shekhar? Whenever you're afraid of anything in life... then you have to face it. Fear is cowardly. Look it in the face, and it runs away.
- Black is a night color. This one. Hey, we picked this one up in Switzerland. Remember this one? This one looks good on you and... the green... This white shirt will go with the green, and it looks great on you. Brown, green, white
Traugott will propose a resolution to introduce 3 new members to the board. Ferrous will oppose this, naturally. Of course he will. If the resolution is rejected, Traugott will have no choice but to accept the results. However, if it passes, we believe Ferrous will disavow the results and withdraw its support for the board.
You can't have it. Thank you for your time, I'll take that under advisement. You think this is a joke? You know we have this drive. You've seen it in action, and I assume you understand how powerful it is.
The android has calibrated them to detect any trace of Tarium radiation. We can't search the whole station. Let's limit ourselves to the upper levels. If someone planted a bomb on board, they wouldn't risk being caught by slipping into a restricted area. I'm guessing it's in someone's quarters.
You must leave quickly. What about the other people on this station? There's nothing I can do for them. This improvement doesn't just change your speech. It changes the way you think and feel.
And who was it for her? It was her husband! He was naked. Wait a moment. She told me to take the dress back, saying it was bad luck.
The guy was right. If you buy a refill of soap... Clearly, he's right. But why are you taking so long to answer this question? Because it's a tough one.
And what are you going to wear when you get there? No clothes in the suitcase! Come to think of it, Casey, this isn't your fault. The writer can't help it if the show sucks. And it does suck!
What happened? Ham radio. The other night... a voice came to me. But the radio doesn't work. It works.
Amateur radio. The other night... a voice came to me. But the radio doesn't work. It works. It works for me.
I'm fine. I'm fine. No, you're not. Just let me help you. You can't help me, okay? I've got a lot to deal with, and this surprise, as nice as it was, is not something I want right now.
Just his job. I fully intend to hit him back, especially as I have the Bergerane population with me. They have all the firepower of Serge Vauban. Vauban's only power is his love for his son. And she doesn't give a damn about love or justice. No ?
I fully intend to hit him back, especially as I have the Bergerane population with me. They have all the firepower of Serge Vauban. Vauban's only power is his love for his son. And she doesn't give a damn about love or justice. No ? And sometimes, she doesn't care about the truth either.
Today you're Patrick Spring, but your name is Zackariah Webb. And you made a terrible mistake. In the 1880s, you built a time machine. But there was a problem. At first, the machine only worked halfway, traveling energy instead of matter. It tore souls from bodies.
Are you accusing me of something? Should we accuse you of something? Well, let's see. There's the house, the address you gave us. - It burned down yesterday.
If this thing reloads... You had to say that. Think about it. What are we missing? Todd! The horn! We have to connect the horn! It's too big, it won't fit.
What is it? - Why? I showed him the map. - I showed him the map and he said we couldn't go in that car. We're going off-roading. You traded the Corvette for this? Oh, don't worry about it. It was leased.
Does it have to do with the universe? If I don't do it, will something weird happen? The universe is already weird, Todd. If you don't tell him now and we get killed... Farah and I are taking the machine back to find out what it's for.
You can count on him, he does it without being forced. Call him back. He doesn't answer the phone much, in my experience. Once we plug in the machine, everything will become clear. - Well, clearly... it clarifies everything.
He doesn't answer the phone much, in my experience. Once we plug in the machine, everything will become clear. - Well, clearly... it clarifies everything. Let me see. Does it do that?
So if it bleeds milk, they're not ripe. - Let me give it a try... - Bleeding milk? That's... Every fig will bleed milk if it's unripe.
And they liked it. The article changed things. It put us on the world map. All these little things, which aren't all that little... help the gastronomies of small countries like Slovenia to slowly position themselves on the international stage. At the time, it was a very important story for Slovenian gastronomy, because it was still developing.
Cerlains chase Cerlains are licked. Cerlains never move. The girl in the amber trapped Coinoée for Pétemité. A toumoyer dans Pentrée. May we remember her every detail Her clothes scattered by the earth. La fille dans l'ambre piégée Un repos qui dure une étemité Elle ferme la pone de la salle de bains.
To toumoyer in Pentrée. Let us remember her every detail Her clothes scattered by the earth. La fille dans l'ambre piégée Un repos qui dure une étemité Elle ferme la pone de la salle de bains. Le téléphone, le léléphone sonne Le téléphone oesse soudain. Cette chanson, cefle chanson Elle toume depuis 1984.
And if you want to leave, don't breathe. And if you want to leave, don't breathe. U" muse", ékalgne-kal. This song, this song, it turns. This song, it doesn't turn anymore.
No, you're not Brian. Then I passed out when he started slashing. Tell me about the smoke. What about it? What did it smell like?
On the 30th and 31st, you work in Miami. Guy-girl and girl-girl, with a bit of text. Tell me what you know about Rocco Siffredi. He's got a really big dick! It's huge!
That's all we've done. All your buried corpses are now starting to talk. I say violence is necessary. Violence is part of American culture. It's as American as cherry pie.
Damn, man! This is the recipe for the decline of any nation or kingdom. Because no kingdom can maintain itself by force alone. Force doesn't work the way its advocates think it does. It doesn't, for example, reveal its opponent's strength to the victim.
This is the recipe for the decline of a nation or kingdom. For no kingdom can maintain itself by force alone. Force doesn't work the way its advocates think it does. It does not, for example, reveal its opponent's strength to the victim. On the contrary, it reveals the opponent's weakness, even panic.
No. Why do you ask? Never mind why. We've won. And the Rhodians have a particularly cruel punishment. It's only fair.
Check the D.A.L.L. preceding the messenger's arrival. Why should we welcome a traveler who has already arrived? Who am I talking to? I'm Grace. We share the same mission, MacLaren, and it concerns Marcy.
I didn't have access. Try to think of it as a reset of the original. What will become of its current consciousness? - The usual. - It will be replaced.
An abused child. An indoctrinated girl, convinced by the DOE that demons are angels. That your life should be sacrificed to them, to our invaders. All I ask, Alex, is that you think about what your life would have been like if the aliens had never come. What it would be like if they were gone.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - King Julien? Now that's exciting. - I licked it. - Let go of that mango! No, it's mine!
And above all, it's really disgusting! It's true, it's true... Sage, are you listening? You have to ask my soul. She controls my body's answering machine.
- Obviously. An Orteils Glacés for the lady. Fifty cents, please. Great. I just put a video on the net. It's amazing.
Can you show it to me? No, Patrick. I'm really busy. And everything. - I can't wait to get home and look at it. - Yeah, you can't. It's really good.
And how am I going to get to work? How big is the room? Super big. Gigantic. But it looks small and intimate.
Her style evolved over the course of her life. In darker moments, she experimented with techniques to add texture to the canvas. As she approached her thirties, the diagnosis... How's the back of your neck? She's feeling a bit lonely.
This time, it has to be more ambitious! They'll be begging you to come and sing at their house! Stop with the viral video. Look, I've written an original song. It's sure to go viral.
- What's the matter? I forgot all about Poppy. - Who's Poppy? - My tortoise. - Did she belong to your host? - No, she didn't.
The war is going badly. It's only a matter of time before the enemy cuts off your supply routes, overruns your defenses and descends on Zairon. But it doesn't have to end this way. You've just seen first-hand technology that will enable us to change the game. We'll be able to travel to Pyr in the blink of an eye, lay waste to their capitol, and destroy their fleet before it's even launched.
I saw you wear it for the last time, the night I was taken away from the palace, the night Father died. I don't have it anymore. I threw it away. Why did you throw it away? It was bound up with awful memories of the night he died.
This is the blade that ended the glorious reign of Emperor Ishida Tetsuda. Do you recognize it? Yes, we do. Your genetic residue was discovered on the weapon. I'm not surprised, it's been mine for a long time.
His lips are trembling. I'm sorry to tell you that, all these years, all the interesting things I've done, are in fact, pure lies. I didn't land a Chinook helicopter. I didn't see Bin Laden die, or even see the movie about it. Now that I've apologized, the network has promised me it has every confidence...
What do you mean there's a legal problem with my hatch? As you said, please take two steps back. The old hatch was perfectly legal. It was authorized under the Regan administration. But when you decided to renovate it, it had to be subjected to the new regulations.
As you said, please take two steps back. The old hatch was perfectly legal. It was authorized under the Regan administration. But when you decided to renovate it, it had to comply with new regulations. It must also be handicapped accessible.
More. And again. Oscar. The door was open. It wasn't.
Do you remember that time... When was that? Last year, when we were working at Columbia University? We were doing cancer research. We were talking about mitosis. You asked, "How do you grow these microtubules in the middle of a cell and make it divide?
Let's hear it for Chloe Arnold. Give it up for Chloe Arnold. Previously... Grass is good stuff. I think she's making a comeback.
I'm going to take this off. Because it's so tight. See what's swinging? That's my dick. It's swinging.
Indeed. He once dreamed he was a butterfly, and when he woke up, he asked himself, "Am I a man who dreamed he was a butterfly or a butterfly who now dreams he's a man?" If you're trying to convince me that all this is real and that all my experiments with the "Raza" were an illusion, don't bother. I guess what I'm trying to tell you is that reality is a little more subjective than we think it is.
Are you absolutely sure they're your friends? I'm sorry. I just... I just have to go. The suit was a good idea, but you forgot one thing... It has a wireless connection to the ship.
The launch of the Daedalus was the start of our historic 7-month journey to Mars. But getting to the red planet wasn't easy. We needed visionaries to show us the way. Mars and Earth are sister planets. Young Mars had rivers and lakes, even an ocean.
We needed visionaries to show us the way. Mars and Earth are sister planets. Young Mars had rivers and lakes, it even had an ocean. If there was water on Mars, couldn't there have been life? Is it habitable?
Not a single tube shows the slightest horizontal entry. They must be dispersing. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I think I've got something. We ruled out this horizontal entrance because it was clogged with debris and too far from the nearest well to be part of the same tube network.
There are two basic reasons for going to Mars now. One is to settle down. Can we expand man's future. The other is science to find out if life ever developed on Mars and how far it's come and what it looked like.
There's an almost religious belief that maybe we'll find it if we keep looking, and that's based on faith and not knowledge, in the same way that religion is based on faith and not knowledge. Marta, mission statement. Phase 2. The search for evidence of life on Mars. No living matter. I've found many more places where it doesn't exist.
Please don't be upset. It's all right now. Your dress is really beautiful. Oh, thank you so much. It is, isn't it?
You're doing great. Your dress is really beautiful. Oh, thank you so much. It is, isn't it? I couldn't believe it looked so good on me.
They had grown. This increase was due solely to demographic change. Politicians took the opportunity to say that the civil rights movement had contributed to this rise... EDUCATOR AND AUTHOR and that if blacks were given the freedom they wanted, crime would become a plague. The U.S. prison population stagnated overall for most of the 20th century. It varied little.
We will save $1.8 billion in fiscal 1982. The luxury goods market expects record sales. The number of Americans below the poverty line is at a twenty-year high. Poverty has increased, of course, but less sharply than in previous years, before our arrival. The curve is reversing, even if it's still rising.
They broke with their party's principles. They sent a signal to criminals by supporting the death penalty. After defeats in 1988, 1984 and 1980, the Democrats realized they had to adopt a more centrist stance. It was impossible for a presidential candidate to have a weak criminal policy. I wasn't in favor of his bill, because it didn't go far enough.
Instead of asking me to betray Kevin because Gallo won't be released, you should be helping me get him released. I'm not helping that bastard, this isn't about Gallo, and you know it. No, you're telling me to betray the one guy I trust for a plan we don't know will work. No, Mike. This is about getting your life back before it changes.
Find a way to make him believe. I'll see to it. That's not the only problem. What else? Gallo's application is back. It has to be filled out by the lawyer representing him.
I don't know if you'll ever forgive me. I just want you to move on without the weight of lies and doubts. Surrender yourself to me. Look at that moon. It's full and bright.
I just want you to move forward without the weight of lies and doubts. Surrender yourself to me. Look at that moon. It's full and bright. You can see why people thought it had mystical powers.
However, he forgot to inform people of the servants' presence in the cellar. The house remained in the Mott family for over a century, but it is said that madness never left the Mott family. The descendants died out in scandal when the last Mott died in South Florida in 1952. By then, the house had changed owners many times, but no one had stayed long. Do you think it's haunted?
This boy is good at it. He's only good for two things: harvesting grass and... taking pictures. I have money. I can make your lives easier. We like our lives just the way they are.
This is crazy. We just heard. Our gangster, Marco. The bullet's not in the midline and doesn't hit the aorta. It's in the left paraspinal muscle.
If you turn it off and on again, the parts of his brain that were hyperactive - should return to normal. - That's crazy. No doubt, but we're running out of time and options. Once her heart has stopped, we'll have about seven minutes before she suffers irreversible brain damage and we can't bring her back. We'll monitor her brain activity in that time, and when it drops below the minimum threshold...
- About earlier... - Just forget it. I can't forget it. That thing inside you is my responsibility. - No, it's mine.
I'm an Inhuman. Director Mace, just to make sure I've heard you correctly, are you really saying you're an Inhuman? Yes, I'm an Inhuman. My life didn't just change when that bomb exploded in Vienna or when I protected that woman. It also changed when I experienced Terrigenesis.
This chamber should work. But it's these energy cells that will save me. What does the book say? Why the experiment failed before. It didn't.
and I died. And there was nothing. Just darkness. And then I heard a voice. It asked me if I wanted a second chance, if I wanted to punish those who had hurt my brother, if I wanted to avenge my own death.
ROXXON CENTRAL I've done everything you asked. We can't stop it now. This plant has been shut down for cause. It could explode at any time.
- "That makes three." - The gang of three. - The gang of three! Shall I show you where my mouth is? No. I know where your mouth is.
Can I cut to the chase? This is your meeting. 8 years ago, I was pregnant for the first time. Randall was fighting to become a partner in his company. We'd just bought the house, confident, even though it needed a complete makeover and we couldn't afford it.
Hello, Tim. What are you financing? Policy change. "Koch Industries is one of the largest private fossil fuel companies in the world, doing anything to protect its interests. Would you give up industrialization and the productivity it has brought us over the last century just so the temperature wouldn't rise?
All those cities in the night, millions of people bustling about. On the lit surface, you can see nature at work, with hurricanes like immense whirlpools over the oceans. I saw the Amazon flowing between my feet for five minutes in the middle of an immense green carpet. It was magnificent. All the way to the sea. The sun rose over the Amazon, the whole forest woke up and, like every day, breathed in and out our air.
Shoulders back, Williams. My shoulders are back. How's my tie? Perfect. It's exactly like the last 2 times you asked me.
You see? You did it. And the suspended camera? What does that mean? It's suspended, like my future.
And a year later, my mother returned to Goa... with my new little brother, Kiddo. I was jealous. Because he was with Mom... And I wasn't. Then my mother told me they were going back, but not for long... I was happy to hear it. I remember asking her if she'd received my last letter... She told me it was so beautiful... That she'd put it on the fridge.
A distraction? This season, forget it, it would be the end. It's too bad I still think we have a chance. Now, if you're smart... and you are... Your big tech company has won so much it can afford this team...
I was struck by the depth of the gash. I asked, "What monster did this?" Outside, I saw two young people. They were comforting each other with inappropriate signs of affection at the time. Take a picture of the body bag as it comes out.
- What burden? - To put an end to this permanent war, so that real work, progress and perfection can begin. By killing millions? Joseph. This war will be terrible, yes, but it will be the last. When it's over, we'll have a united and pacified world for the first time in human history.
Do you have any leads on these terrorists and the next potential target? The WD is gathering lots of data and generating a target. How does it work exactly? For example, the police inform us that they're investigating a suspicious van parked outside the Central Bank on Bridwell Avenue. So we analyze this lead and see if it's reliable.
They've got us, Robin. A trick of our arrogant adversaries. But in their hubris, they may have left a clue to the location of their lair. This machine contains the information of two complete encyclopedias. BAT-ANALYZER It can extract and analyze data in a matter of seconds.
Lex parsimoniae. The Latin "principle of parsimony"? That's a good one. Your command of dead languages has improved. No language really dies if it lives in our hearts.
A bunch of love letters never mailed is nothing sensational. It's just literature. Pack your bags, call the driver. You no longer have a car. I've asked for it to be confiscated.
I don't know if I'll be able to keep this appointment. On Wednesdays, there's golf on TV. Holy Father, tell me you don't want to disappoint those children, do you? Madame, it's the children who have disappointed me. Didn't you love your childhood? All I remember of my childhood is that one day it was behind me...
First, we'll take 200 pairs of your talking glasses. There you go. Your boss's only ambition: glasses. Aren't you tired? A man incapable of delegating to a woman, who despises the intelligence of his collaborators, because she refers him to his lack of education.
Until next time, Ginny Baker. Maybe to get your car washed. How bad is it? I saw the video of your dunk contest. Luckily, I was able to turn off the cell towers in the area before it hit the Internet.
Once I'm up there, I'll help you climb, okay? Okay. Okay, in the meantime, there's gonna be a wave. you gotta get under that ledge, hold your breath when it comes, okay, you gotta hang on-- you got it?
Because you're a man? Is that it? A man doesn't go on a joyride, waving his father's card to get him out of trouble. And pray the car wasn't stolen. It wasn't.
Is that it? A man doesn't go on a joyride, waving his father's card to get him out of trouble. And pray the car wasn't stolen. It wasn't. It belonged to a friend of Marcus.
She's vilified by the public, and she dies of cancer. Crap. Sounds like she had it all. Nobody has everything. We should take the briefcase back where it belongs.
In retrospect, it wasn't a good idea to dance in an underground death trap. True, but you wouldn't have done it if I hadn't forbidden dancing. Shaking your booty saved ours. So dancing's not forbidden anymore? Of course it's not forbidden!
I'm a different kind of tough guy. I'll be old someday, even older than Weez. Older than Weez? Good luck with that. I knew dust when it was stone.
I don't know about that. This outfit is really awful. You were saying, Mrs. Stafford? Well, we've brought in four archaeologists for a quick visual examination of the piece. But none of them are sure what caused the decomposition, and they don't want to take any samples or work on the column since it's so fragile.
Under the chapel, through a hole the size of a tennis ball. through a metre of stone. And how are we supposed to get out? Sorry, where's the good news here? How's the letter coming along? It's not.
- Hands up! - Drop the computer. Turn around slowly. You're too late! This metal box is on American soil, and it's filled with damning evidence against you.
Love is the most powerful magic in the world. Is it really? You see this brooch I sold? My father gave it to my mother because he loved her. She cherished it because it came from him.
But we're not done yet. The bombs aren't here, they're at the stadium. Where did you get this information? Is it true? Yes, it's accurate.
Stop the car. He has to go two blocks further. He's telling you to go two blocks farther. Tell him if he hits that big one, he'll know exactly where the bomb is. He tells you... to hit the big one, and you'll know where it is.
You're insane. Why are you walking around like a lunatic? Where's your brother? Look at that lamp. Doesn't it look strange?
You'll never shoot. Wanna bet? Okay, we'll bet... on your defeat. The bomb is wired to my heart. It will explode as soon as it stops beating.
It makes sense. Warbeck was working on a security project on undersea optical cables. If you find out where this card came from, it'll give us a lead on who killed Warbeck. Easier said than done. But Patton and I worked our asses off and cracked it. It's from a company called Certel... under contract to the government.
She wouldn't like it. - Wouldn't like what? - I read a study. - Take it from me. It says that couples who follow more standardized gender roles get laid more.
He can't help it. His dick's not so hard anymore. It's not... Nobody wants a half-hard cock. I knew that cock when it was 20 years old.
Can I talk to you in my office for a second about your report? What about it? What do you need? I know what's in the report. I want to talk to you about the amending clause. It's not in there.
No. I mean... Yes, it is. I know, silly me. Not if your idea is stupid. If it's brilliant, then yes, you're stupid.
Riley! Funny, I was just talking to my managing partner about you. Were you wondering if I was stupid or brilliant? We were talking about your idea. It's very interesting.
Thanks to participative collaboration, they come up with fun, easy-to-reproduce experiments. In short, I love them. I'm still a fan of our first invention. The SpikerBox. It records an animal's neuronal activity to understand its brain.
As luck would have it, Aron makes his living playing with lightning. CEO, APPLIED TESLA TECHNOLOGY With a nice gadget, the Tesla coil. What's a Tesla coil? A Tesla coil is a high-frequency air-core transformer. And in layman's terms? It enables us to convert high voltages into very high voltages.
It's a Faraday suit. It conducts current better than we do. It's great. Wonderful. This is Aron's lightning tamer. When electricity hits the suit, it'd rather run over it than into the body underneath, which conducts it poorly.
From the Corey Hart song. Corey Hart? "Sunglasses at Night." It's an old radio. It's not old.
Corey Hart? "Sunglasses at Night." It's an old radio. It's not old. It's from the '80s.
What happened to your mother? That's what I need to find out, but she's watching us, so you need to find a reason to get us out. Can you do that? Do you like this dress? It's a little simple.
Thank you very much. - So... - So what? I think you really like this car. Oh, it's amazing.
Oh, it's incredible. What I really like is that they designed it with parts they already had all over the factory. It's like coming home from the show in South Africa, opening the fridge, and using what's in there to make a delicious Shepherd Pie What? Like expired milk and an old piece of cheese? - And it costs 2.1 million?
- And it costs 2.1 million? - Yes. How much is that, Jeremy, in rand (South African currency)? Ten hundred and thirty million and one milllion. And for that price, it does 0 to 100 in 2.9 seconds?
I'll have that back, thank you very much. With the Queen finally in the car, we now had to manage a dangerous journey to the embassy. However, at least it meant I was back to my usual job. Let me tell you a bit about the car, it's the S8 Plus. Plus means it has 80 more horsepower than the standard model.
Well, that's not quite true. - Where the hell is this embassy? - Go that way. - No, this is bullshit. - It's over there.
Boys, watch your pants. Understand? Their aim is as good as yours. Your sauce looks great. "Great isn't good enough. It has to be perfect.
Your sauce looks great. "Great isn't good enough. It has to be perfect. My sister's pie will be perfect and I won't put up with my mother's passive aggressive remarks if my sauce isn't perfect. Perfect. Honey, it's perfect.
Meningitis is a devastating disease with symptoms such as extreme fevers and acute headache, but there are also neurological effects such as confusion, aphasia, amnesia and sometimes even epilepsy. Can amnesia remain after infection? Yes, it can. In these cases, the disease is the equivalent of a trauma. In other words, it leaves lasting or definitive effects.
Your colleague has been hit on the head by an ice axe, and is about to take up the saxophone! Can he be discharged? No, but I signed him out. There you go! She's beautiful!
Not bad, this lawyer. I'd rather have him defend my friends than my enemies. If I'm not going to jail, I'm going to Quebec. Away from all this. Away from this fucking mountain. It's taken too much from me.
This? A stone, a bottle... It was flying everywhere that day. - We're not going to tell that story. - It's a good one.
Because I am .. hungry. We... We shouldn't. Your sauce, I think it's burning.
- All right, Hank. - Hank, I've noticed that you've been putting too much stress on your kidneys and shoulders, so I bought you this ergonomic office chair. - I think you'll find it provides more than adequate lumbar support.
Do you really think you'll find someone here to explain your visions to you? I think I just did. This is it. The sword of my vision. This is it.
Now. It's an emergency at work. Funny, I thought your work was here with us Listen, I've got the last trial of a case pending, and unlike this pointless pantomime, someone's life is really at stake. Keep your attention where it belongs and do your chores on your own time.
She's the worst. And I have my Internet girlfriend. That you've never met. @WinnieCooper534 is real! The ear, she just wants
And I have my Internet girlfriend. That you've never met. @WinnieCooper534 is real! The ear, it just wants - what it wants....
There shouldn't be anyone out there. It's too dangerous. We need a flat road. No hills, no bumps, no clods. Boss, I've got a nuclear box connected to a 12.6-volt DC battery. It's already starting to heat up, and the marshmallows are melting. We need a plan.
Here, you'll see millions of fibers and could spend a long time studying them. When you look too closely, you see only part of the picture. It's only when you step back that you can see the role each fiber plays and its relationship to the others, and so the full pattern emerges. Imagine the level of understanding we could achieve if we could all learn to think differently, and look at our world from the perspective of a broader, connected vision. For Einstein, geometry was a key to understanding the unity of the universe, because it represents the relationship between things.
The answer: the edge of a black hole. Haramein studied the possible connections between the forces of rotation and the forces of gravity, which would be intertwined at the quantum level. The rotational dynamics of the structure of space-time itself is what produces what we call a black hole, and this new equation proves it. It proves that it is the fluctuation of the Planck that produces this effect.
Haramein's proposed connection between the forces of black holes and protons could be very important. We're made of these objects We're made of protons, atoms and molecules, so it makes sense to think that the same kind of dynamics can be found at the biological level. This is what Creation is all about. It emerges from the void through the structure of the black hole and into our reality.
and today could well be the day science changes forever. But so far, it hasn't been the day that changed science forever. If we look back at the history of physics, it's a pattern that keeps repeating itself. Someone comes up with an idea, which later becomes a standard, but nothing happens at the time. And sometimes even the idea gets a lot of criticism, because it's based on a different way of thinking.
One person has a problem, solves it, publishes it, and we can all benefit from it with a few clicks on the Internet. Scientists around the world can collaborate remotely and exchange information like never before. We are now living in the most technologically connected moment in our history. What are we going to do with this opportunity? Technology is a two-edged sword, and it can cut both ways.
In fact, in 2013 a student found neural activity in subjects in a deep coma. You both said you'd try. We're here for relaxation. Sorry. And we're going to find serenity, even if it kills us.
The light, darling. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! The washing machine won't turn off. It's like it's possessed.
It's spreading. Thank you, Winston. Now I feel understood. No, I just figured out why I know this house. You see, it's in my favorite.... school district.
Then follow me. Are you ready? Lead the way. You were supposed to put the tape back in the cupboard. I know, it was stuck, so I was lucky to get it back.
It's useless and I'm totally excluded. This is serious. It's very serious. This wedding dress isn't here. Then it's at the thrift store.
You can't go out there! What are you doing? I'm just going upstairs to get my dress from the closet. In your closet? Yes, it's in a box, the same one I've had for 15 years.
- The CDC found the link. - They were all at the polling station. - What are you talking about? Election volunteers. Ricin was on the ballot boxes. It became airborne and was inhaled.
I don't know how much longer I can help you. Look, I understand. Did you get anything off that security card? Yes. It gives you access to room 7 on the 8th floor of the PLC Building in Louisiana.
Yes. It gives you access to room 7 on the 8th floor of the PLC Building in Louisiana. Louisiana? Chuck, this room 7... Does it face east or west?
Ágata, it's over. Come away with me. Cassia. I want you to find out everything you can about this candidate, understand? This test you've created... I don't know if it selects the right people for the Other Side.
That's the point. We need leverage. I'll get some strong guys to help us. This water tastes funny. It's probably from the other side.
Do you want it? It's a magic ring. Do you want it? I have the ring. Do you know whose it was?
It's better this way. Did you have any interaction with Agent Caesar? Not really, no. So you didn't know what he thought of your performance? That it was below average?
I'm not sure. Now I'm busy. Please excuse me. I'm developing a revolutionary application. It maps products in a grocery store and cuts annual shopping time in half, to an average of 26 hours per year per adult.
Walter. Hey! For our new friends, it's tradition that the procession takes the statue of St. Charles de Mont Argus from the church to the cemetery, where we honor the dead. And where we will dedicate Megane's tomb. Parishioners join the procession as it passes, and it'll be happening to us soon, so... if you could all get ready to go.
He was visiting the biggest motorcycle rally in the south. The question is... how did his ride go so wrong? Here's what we've got. It looks like a small caliber. It entered through the back of the rib cage, puncturing the heart.
When I was in triage, they said my neck muscles acted as a sort of neck helmet, which made me feel like I wasn't talking to real doctors. Anyway, I'm just going to wear this thing for the next few days just as a precaution. Well, if you want to cover it up, Cece gave me a scarf that would be perfect. It's long enough to wrap around an above-ground pool full of Alfredo sauce.
How'd it go? - Did you break the news to Robby? - No, I didn't break it to him. Before I could break his heart, I broke his leg. It's now in two pieces, connected by... a tunnel of skin where his knee should be.
Earth is the only planet we know where life exists. And, here, it does so in abundance. The jungle is Eden. It covers less than 6% of the Earth's surface but is home to half of all plants and animals on earth.
It's just John Stamos on the Greek yogurt float. Drop the bomb now? He can't even tell John Stamos from Snoopy. You can't dump a man on a holiday. I'm telling you, it happened to me once, and that pain... It comes back year after year
We had no choice. - Do you have the key? - I've got it. - Then we've got to get out of here. - But it's around Bonnie's neck.
Oh, no, we don't. Look, we don't have much time. Flynn's coming in with a lot of cops and they're heavily armed. The ambush has changed. Is it happening earlier?
What are you talking about? Heaver was a trumpet player in the Navy band? Okay, so... Where's the trumpet? It's not in the house.
Where's the museum?" "The subway?" New Yorkers demand information. No excuses. "Where's the ice cream from?" You flinch. If you say it, they ask, "And is it good?"
The idea is that if you can get a celebrity to "win with Scientology," and they start telling everybody, that's then going to result in a bunch of people getting interested in Scientology and getting into Scientology. And that idea isn't... wrong. It's true.
It was cancelled for PR reasons. Mm-hmm. And it doesn't change the treatment of SPs, Suppressive Persons. The Church says the Fair Game rule has been rescinded, but it continues to behave exactly as before.
Nuclear energy is generated by the heat of fission, which produces steam. This steam drives a turbine, creating electricity. In short, a nuclear reactor is like firewood, and a steam turbine like a pressure cooker that boils water. Nuclear power is the only resource capable of replacing oil and coal, which are expected to run out in the near future. Fossil fuels cause global warming and acid rain, but nuclear power is ecological because it respects the environment.
This steam drives a turbine, creating electricity. In short, a nuclear reactor is like firewood, and a steam turbine like a pressure cooker that boils water. Nuclear power is the only resource capable of replacing oil and coal, which are expected to run out in the near future. Fossil fuels cause global warming and acid rain, but nuclear power is ecological because it respects the environment. It creates enormous amounts of energy from very few resources. It's a highly efficient industry.
And our nuclear power plant is perfectly equipped with control units. The situation is nowhere near as serious as you think. Sir! The pressure in the containment vessel is rising. It's reached 350 kPa!
What happens if the water level continues to fall? In this tank, 400 tonnes of spent fuel are stored with coolant. If the coolant drops, the fuels will be exposed to the air. And just like in the power plant, there will be a hydrogen explosion and a meltdown. The fuels will melt. There's only one concrete wall, and if it explodes, a huge amount of radiation will be released.
Look in the back. Sometimes it's booby-trapped. This is L-7. The new Lucasville prison is one of the largest in the country. It cost more than $23 million.
Sometimes it's rigged. This is L-7. The new Lucasville prison is one of the largest in the country. It cost more than $23 million. It can accommodate 1,600 inmates.
Today's best hybrids are rated at 4.7 liters per 100 km. Can you imagine 3.36 liters per 100 km back then? It would have been a game-changer. The plates showed a car worthy of the space age. READY FOR THE MOON! In addition to its revolutionary capabilities, it promised good handling, greater safety and good value for money.
It would have been a game-changer. The plates showed a car worthy of the space age. READY FOR THE MOON! In addition to its revolutionary capabilities, it promised good handling, greater safety and value for money. All for a modest price, compared to other cars. UNDER $2,000 It retails for $1,969 and consumes 3.36 liters per 100 km.
Is this a joke? There were rumors that the engine was that of a BMW motorcycle or a lawnmower. In fact, this car is a pile of mud. It can't run. But from a distance, it looks like one.
The scam was over after nine months. For originality, even though the car didn't move, it's a hard scam to beat. It was made of wood, but it looked like the real thing. You'd have bought it. Cars used to be weird, it looks real.
How do I get to a taco restaurant? A taco is a dish of Mexican origin. No, not the definition of "taco". I should be more fluent with voice recognition. It needs to understand pauses, all accents, and words that sound alike but have very different meanings.
But my last competitor should make it a lot worse. Hi, there. My name is Jim. My addiction ruined me. It cost me my job.
Has science succeeded in improving cyborg vision? Check out this guy. Neil Harbisson was born with extreme color blindness. Doctors implanted an antenna in his brain. My antenna is part of my body. It allows me to hear colors.
Check out this guy. Neil Harbisson was born with extreme color blindness. Doctors implanted an antenna in his brain. My antenna is part of my body. It allows me to hear colors. It sends light frequencies to a chip in the back of my neck. This chip transposes the colors into sound waves.
I feel there's something missing. This Star Trek-inspired device is very close to the futuristic promise. Long life, and laser stitching. And, number one: the flying skateboard. If Grant's creation is a prototype, it's a flying board, and it's here.
With four competitors vying for first place, a fifth enters the fray. This time, it's all about me. This invention has been invading the world for the past two years. It can be seen in every tourist spot. It sells by the millions, but is banned from Apple conferences, Disney parks and Wimbledon.
This invention has been invading the world for the past two years. It can be seen in every tourist spot. It sells by the millions, but is banned from Apple conferences, Disney parks and Wimbledon. Why not? Because it's terribly annoying.
Why is that? Because it's terribly annoying. It's the selfie pole. Also known as the narcissistic pole. The selfie pole is so popular that it features among TIME magazine's top 25 inventions of 2014.
A photo enthusiast and engineer at Minolta, the camera manufacturer. He invented it after asking to be photographed in front of the Louvre. We left with his camera. Hiroshi's creation was manufactured and distributed. But it didn't sell well. The patent lapsed in 2003.
It was huge. Literally. Physically gigantic. Control cables connected the keyboards to what Cahill called his music power plant. It consisted of miles of cables, generators, rows of spinning rotors, alternators, transformers and switches.
Trying to read a road map in the middle of the street? That's it! Just look at it! All of Los Angeles. Ridiculous. This kind of traffic is supposed to be ideal for the crowdsourced app, as it adapts to the conditions.
It's a plastic rim. It's a little different from what you've seen. It's 42 grams lighter. It feels good. The car runs well. It goes straight and it's powerful.
It was time. We asked questions, but he flatly refused to answer. The meeting was over. We got into a van and turned down a street. A somewhat deserted street, on the outskirts of... a residential area. A white car pulled out in front of us, and began to slow down before braking.
It's broken! I'll call an ambulance. All we've got is an image problem on our hands. People need to understand that this outrageous photo is a violation of your privacy. We can't prove it's real.
Do you know where to go? Where did you go on your honeymoon? Positano, Italy. You'll love this house. It's very spacious.
I present myself as someone who knows your worth. I've come to offer you wealth, power and more pussy than you've ever had. Whatever the pussies are, we're not interested. You and I could own this whole town. If I were interested, I'd own it already.
You couldn't send a letter out just by putting it in an envelope. Security read each individual letter that went out. - I see. - If it was OK, they'd seal it and send it. If it wasn't, it was returned to you and you had to change it.
And the second I got there, the illusion immediately vanished. You see, this is heavily guarded property... - Mm-hmm. - ...with a lot of secrets and a lot of control, specifically: "OK, you don't... you're not allowed to make phone calls without permission and without anyone next door listening. If you want to send a letter to your family, you have to leave it open, and it has to be read first."
"Oh, what happened?" "Oh, he jumped over the fence and ran off and they're looking for him..." Gotta say, la... the... the base is in the middle of nowhere. - That's it. - It's more than 6 km from the first sign of human life.
- I don't want to die! Who doesn't? You should take it back. The amulet called to you, Master Jimmy. It chose you.
Don't say "your destiny". - Your sacred duty. - Or that. You can't refuse her. It's yours until death.
I can't believe this just happened. And did you see the way the chiquita looked at you? - Your armor did you a favor. - I'm still looking for the buttons. The guy with the eyes says it reacts to your emotions.
What happened? The amulet responded to your unconscious command, Master Jim. - You're comfortable, aren't you? - Yes. She feels it.
It's all my fault. No, Blinky. You've got to believe me. I know what I saw. If the proof isn't here, it must be somewhere else.
Sorry to disappoint you, but baby's not going to follow you like that. It's really not safe for kids. Oh, Didi Dodo. Your sister's in trouble. What's the point of this amulet if it can't help me?
The teeth tear and chew, reducing the food to a paste before it is swallowed. Then it passes down the trachea...
- Did you lose the address? - What? No! No! Of course not! You don't know where I put it, do you? - It must be here somewhere.
We drug our coffee. Shadow stick. I use my warhammer to eliminate his minions. - Then I gently remove his ring. - But what if it doesn't come off?
By Merlin's grace, may the sun grant me its infinite power. - Oh, no! Oh, no! - Give me the ring! My soul. It's... gone.
I'm a little surprised we made such a good team. I still intend to eliminate you when this is all over. Maybe, if we get out of this, I can tell my people about the Eye of Gunmar. I suppose you still want to find the last Triumbric stone. - Do you know where it is?
Continue... Global domination. In 2007, Biderman becomes CEO and finds himself in the middle of a media storm. I don't encourage infidelity. It doesn't need encouragement.
According to the emails, they help to automate it. Making it very accessible. Just as Google didn't invent search. Ashley Madison doesn't run a prostitution ring or an illegal escort service. What I find immoral is the way they talk to journalists, making them believe that the company is something it's not.
How does he know? Alodi. What's Alodi? An entity from a time before the Kirin Tor. We believe it has a function similar to that of the Guardian.
- I'll watch the end. When you see the press, can you tell them one thing? I made a mistake. I told Candy the quote was by Goethe. Who's it by?
What happened to you? Portugal, 2003. A monastery in the Bussaco forest, and a particularly ferocious entity. Did you chase it away? Yes, but it bit me on the leg.
Yes, but what's the story? What do you mean, what's the story? Monsters lose, good guys win, the end. No no no. It doesn't work unless it's a real story of goosebumps, twists and scares.
And, like him, I intend to work day and night for the glory of our kingdom, in accordance with the teachings of Luther, our spiritual guide. I inherited from my father a country of miners and lumberjacks, peasants and soldiers. Ignorance and illiteracy reigned over the lower classes, and the people despised the learned and distrusted knowledge. The French philosopher René Descartes says... that curiosity is a great asset. He says it predisposes us to the acquisition of scientific knowledge.
"Long live Christine! "Long live Christine!" "Long live Christine! ..." "The passion of Desire is a restlessness of the soul caused by the spirits which disposes it to want for the future the things it represents to itself to be suitable."
Yes, I've been told. I sent you a letter a year ago. Did you get it? Yes. What did it say?
She still loves you. So, what do you think? They all had incurable diseases. That's the recurrence. We've looked into it, but it doesn't add up.
Nothing at all. Nothing at all. Nothing at all. So, how's the investigation going? Progressing.
Hello, John. You look wonderful. I read your letter. I've read it several times. It's different from the others.
He's not even human. We don't know what he is. I do. At the end of the war, Skynet wanted to develop a new type of infiltration unit by infecting human beings with robotic matter. It restructures and rebuilds tissue at the cellular level to maximize combat utility.
If we have the momentum and the power, why wait? You're not the political voice of this movement. I'm the political voice. Protecting our people remains the priority. But the world is waking up to this war. No one will escape judgment when it's over.
Yes. The water is coming. Don't fall, my friends, into water addiction. It will make slaves of you and you will feel its absence.
You drive! Hold the torch! / I'm holding the torch! Closer! / It's under your nose!
I got my good shirt on. I'm taking you to a nice restaurant. Okay. It's not the kind of shirt they had in mind here. But it's nice.
- Black hole. - God. The source of the conflict was clear. The king-in-law was upset because the king's sword was long and shiny, and the king-in-law trembled at it. Even though the beau-roi saw that the king had a big sword with beautiful engravings, all the ladies in the kingdom preferred the medium size of the beau-roi's sword, because she was a good listener.
Finally! Hi, Mark. It's carnage. Morgan stock has dropped by half. It's down to $23.10.
Shoot him! Strangely enough, it doesn't seem fair to me. Left and right. This street goes nowhere. - It goes where I want it to.
He's an astronomer. His greatest achievement was discovering a rather unique comet. How unique? Well, it has a mathematically perfect perigee.
His greatest achievement was discovering a rather unique comet. How unique? Well, it has a mathematically perfect perigee. So, according to his calculations, it should pass close to the Earth in the winter of 1981.
Well, it has a mathematically perfect perigee. So according to its calculations, it should have passed close to Earth in the winter of 1981. - Did it? No. No, it didn't.
Lavender pretty You must love me Dilly dilly For I love you too But sadness spares no kingdom, no happiness. She entered Ella's house.
Go. There's no shortage of cat food. Girls gotta help girls! You're missing the party. I guess it's just like any other party.
In the forest near Itzelsberg. Near my field. - Bullshit, Eberle. I'll give you a good thrashing if the poaching doesn't stop. The tango dance, from South America. It's very intimate, almost sinful.
You're suffering from paranoia. And the victims? Hitler always talks about providence. So for you Nazis, there's also a higher law. And it says: Thou shalt not kill.
The stars are coming out. The little prince... he loved sunsets. One day he saw the sun set 44 times. His what? His planet! It was so small that... all he had to do was pull his chair back a few steps to see another one.
He's helped me a lot in the past. Did you sleep well? I'm adjusting. Yes. You have to adapt. Like water. If you put water in a glass, it becomes the glass.
Did you sleep well? I'm adjusting. Yes. You have to adapt. Like water. If you put water in a glass, it becomes the glass. In a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
Yes. You have to adapt. Like water. If you put water in a glass, it becomes the glass. In a bottle, it becomes the bottle. In a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
Oh, very well. Samantha, you were there. Oh, I see. We had a deal. And if you ask me, the day's not over yet. It's not over, Dad!
- Yes, you did. I guess I was stupid. Why don't you try it again? Try again. There, it moved.
Colonel Bob said that... The bomb may have harmed the American prisoners. What are you talking about? The Japanese might try to hurt your father in revenge for the bomb. It wiped out an entire city.
I think I've got it. The world's first true 100% artificial intelligence. A computer system more intelligent than man. If I show it a work of art, this thing, this being, could judge it. Decide if it likes it.
These spirits shouldn't be filmed from the wrong angle. They're very fickle, the ghost-divas. We'd do anything for an apparition, wouldn't we? Can you check this camera? It's tilting down, weird.
"We" are happy with the decision. Go and enjoy the house. No, we won't. It's spotless. It has to stay that way for Monday's inspection.
Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? Robert Pacino. No bullets! Why don't you stick your head up your ass and see if it fits?
- No. Why don't you stick your head up your ass? Why don't you stick your head up your ass? See if it fits! See if she comes in!
Why don't you stick your head up your ass? See if she comes in! Stick your head up your ass and see if it fits. I'll pass. Stick your head up your ass and see if it fits.
But I don't think anyone outside the 2 knows what we've been up against. This is the Walnut. Capitol headquarters for all offensive operations. Inhabited by District 2 military and civilian personnel. As you can see, the fortress is buried so deep beneath the bedrock that it's untouchable.
We have 58 days left to change things. But we've got to turn this thing off at all costs. Young lady, you still have a few gaps in your tachyonic fusion. Turning this machine off is impossible, there's no "off" button. Do you realize what it does?
A world where a victim can face his killer in court. Where a crippled soldier with shrapnel in his back can be killed, healed and brought back to life so he can walk again. The possibilities are endless! Life is beautiful! Unfortunately, it comes to an end.
Have a look. This is the refuge. Drilling 24 hours a day at maximum speed, the drill will deviate, like this. Or like this. In fact, it can deviate in 20 different ways.
and a temporary school for your children. That's all for now. Minister! We know that the mine is very dangerous. It can collapse at any time.
Not a chance. The mountain is very unstable. We'll have to find something else. We know it's unstable. We know it's unstable, but it's the only way.
Decorated in the colors of the national flag, here is Fenix 1, the rescue capsule to which the Chilean authorities, like the rest of the world, are entrusting all their hopes. The metal cage is designed to bring the 33 miners, one by one, from a depth of 700 meters, to the light they haven't seen for 62 days. Open it up. Good. It collapses.
How fast? Too fast. See the green line? We marked this stone yesterday. See how it's gone down?
Something's wrong. Hey! Hey! - Wait. - She's not moving.
- Shine the light over here. - What do you think? I'll try again. The wheel has stopped. It's starting again.
You're the little rascal Dad told us so much about. He tells me he just lost $6,000 worth of cocaine in the parking lot. That much coke, I've seen that twice in my life. I almost had a heart attack. I couldn't think about anything else. I couldn't think of anything else. I grabbed a dozen roadies and asked them to look under each car.

I couldn't think of anything else. I grabbed a dozen roadies and asked them to look under each car. We were in a stadium, so you can imagine thousands of cars and roadies in the middle wondering where she was.
- Showman 5-0, Bravo 2-7-2. It's too risky to follow them. Go back to base. Showman 5-0, do we know this house? It belongs to Amadu Mukhtar.
We don't have to risk our lives for personal pleasure. The aim is to integrate a whole far greater than the individual. The Eight pay homage to the essential forces of the Earth. And Ozaki wanted to achieve the Eight so that the world would remember the beauty of this planet. To make the world realize that it is dying.
Try to stay alive, kid. Bodhi, I don't see any tracks. I don't. Well, I do. I see it, and it's beautiful.
I need a white shirt my size with a pocket. Yes. Which store is still closed at 8:45 a.m. Do you want me to send someone and have them return in 15 minutes? Go to the lobby, find someone my size wearing a white shirt, tell him I'll trade him for a computer and my shirt for free. Does it have to be white?
Keep up the good work. - What do you want from me? - You brought me here. I bought her a $400,000 house. It's worth twice that today!
Keep Riley happy all day long. And may I add, I love your dress, it's adorable. Oh, that old thing. Oh, thank you so much. I love the way it twirls.
- They're in the dumpster. - Nothing's coming back from the Dump. - Yeah. Look, lady. This is our work, all right. When Riley doesn't care about a memory, it fades.
So are you. Come here. Come on up here. Danny, stop looking at the hill. She's not going away. Neither are you.
Let's live like no one has lived before. A life of madness. Once the soul was perfect and had wings... Courageous. ...it could soar to heights only winged creatures could reach.
Once the soul was perfect and had wings... Courageous. ...it could soar to heights only winged creatures could reach. But the soul lost its wings and fell to the ground. It then took on human form.
Courageous. ...she could soar to heights only winged creatures can reach. But the soul lost its wings and fell to the ground. And now, as long as it lives in this body, not the slightest trace of wings is visible.
She then took on human form. And now, as long as she lives in this body, not the slightest trace of wings is visible. Yet their roots are still there. and their essence is to try to lift this earthly body and fly with it to the heavens. When we see a beautiful woman or man... the soul remembers the beauty it saw in paradise.
So what? It's bath from bath. Welcome, gamers, to the first annual World Video Game Championships! Tonight, we're joined by representatives from Guinness World Records and NASA, the nation's space agency, who will be filming the competition for a 1982 news and pop culture compilation. The videotape will be placed in a space probe launched by NASA into our solar system, in order to reach, or even pass on a message to extraterrestrial life, if it exists.

Because it's the best tree for climbing, but if you put a hut in our way, we can't climb anymore. If we remove part of it, that would be fine too. No, it wouldn't. If it would, it's just that you don't want to. I'd be okay with it staying, but it has to be smaller. or not take up so much space.
If it's okay, you just don't want it. I'd be okay with it staying, but it has to be smaller or not take up so much space. How many boards? No boards at all. What's a shame about this hut is that it'll only last a few months.
I could have written him a check. Could you? But would you have? Eddie, I know you're disappointed. You thought you were getting a new car, but it's got a little gas mileage.
3rd year student. - Anirudh. Anirudh, very good question. But your question hurts me. It hurts me.
Really? What did you do? He knocked me to the ground, wrapped his leaves around my face and arms, and when I came to, I had a branch up my ass. Oh, no! It was sharp... that branch.
I let you out of the fridge. We're even. - What did you do to my car? - What do you mean? It should fly better.
- What have you done to my car? - What do you mean? It should fly better. It's a car. It didn't fly before.
-Fire! I'll get my battery No, no, no.... I know where she is We can call for help
Sorry, Amelia. I couldn't find my phone battery. I was looking everywhere and my flashlight died. Well, does it look like it's working now?
You did all your exams. - I had a lot of stuff to do. Oh, my God. How did the tumor get so big? Because it's aggressive, like you.
No. You came here and made me drive 400 km just so you could get laid with a bartender! There's no way I'm giving in this time, you're on your own. You're gonna... go home by yourself like a big girl. - I am. - Yeah. And by the way, fix your wig, it's ugly.
I'm not the man I was when I left. I need to understand why you didn't come back. I'll tell you this, and then we'll say no more about it. The idea of finding you is the only thing that kept me going during that damn war. And when it ended, I swear to you, I tried to come home.
They don't take the time to understand what really happened. Maybe it doesn't matter anymore. Of course it matters. The truth is always important. It seems to matter to you.
I felt the life leave her body. Then she breathed again. Then I squeezed harder. Then I realized I couldn't put her in the suitcase like that. She was too big.
Krabs knows all your plans. He searched my hard drive for the recipe. I never got it. But we'll get it back. We'll go back in time and steal the recipe before it's gone.
Get out of my sight. Bye, Fabrice. I liked him, he was funny. So, what do you think of the dress? Oh, it's gorgeous, so trendy, so Valentino.
What is it? Delirium. Brooke! I'm Kelly. - What's wrong with the door?
Pfeifer, give me that. Give me that. Is there something wrong with this door? No. Why won't it open?
When I was at MIT, I designed a robotic hand that could crush a billiard ball into dust, but hold a butterfly wing without hurting it. Mechanics don't matter. What matters is how sophisticated the input sensors are. The importance for this hand was not in its movement, but in the way it moved.
But not really, it's not an analog or anything. So it's a power source? It's not like Mr. Fusion. Back to the Future" enthusiast. Not only does this technology not exist, it never will, no need.
I didn't mean to offend you. I'm just curious as to why your love of innovation is limited. If you love practical science, why limit yourself to simply admiring it? Your interaction ends when you write your article. It ends with your assessment of new technology on a superficial level.
You forgot to rewind. That's all right. I don't blame you. I don't blame you. What did you think? I thought it was beautiful.
It's not about the money. You could have helped him with his homework, made him something to eat or... phoned him. Let her know you're here. Thanks for the tea. Can I go to the bathroom before I leave, please? You know where it is.
You hit me in the butt with your dick. So yeah, it startled me. I'm sorry about that. It was my fault. She has one eye, but she can't see.
Sorry about the racket. I hardly noticed. Let's just say I believe you. I love this house. It exudes happiness.
What's wrong? - There's an alarm. - No, there isn't. Yes, there is. It's going to go off.
And it's amazing how little it's changed. That's quite a feat. For her, life seemed easy. It always did. Even when it wasn't.
Yes, exactly. The Kartenhoff meteorite, the oldest in man's possession. The meteorite that caused this crater. Think of it. So many years up there, alone, silent, preparing for the moment when it will mark the earth forever.
The meteorite that caused this crater. Think of it. So many years up there, alone, silent, preparing for the moment when it will mark the earth forever. An immense, unstoppable force. Except that it has stopped, hasn't it?
And he doesn't even use a book. He knows all these things. Let's hope the next course is easier, eh? One of the things that ruins Christmas around here is the turkey. It tastes like sawdust.
- Merry Christmas. - Cheers. Miss McAdam is leaving us. She's going to live with her sister in Manhattan. She has the best room in the house, the basement, and her own entrance.
He's decent and nice, has a job and works hard. We go to the movies on Wednesdays and he takes me to Father Flood's dances on Saturdays. I think about you and Mom every day, but I know now that I can have a life here with Tony, a life I couldn't have had before I met him. My body was here, but my life was in Ireland with you. Now it's in the middle of the ocean.
Atlee said you'd understand. Atlee, your head of British Intelligence. And he didn't call you back? Even after you gave him the key? You know perfectly well she was a virgin.
- This watch? - Yes, this watch. - You're still into watches? It's a Piaget Emperador! It's worth 200,000.
No chicken or veal? I don't eat meat. You don't eat meat? You look like the kind of guy who would eat meat at every opportunity. If it had blood on it, I wouldn't eat it.
-I don't know, I can't see. Bring me the first-aid kit and some water! Breathe in. Don't stop pushing! The door! The door! Is it locked?
I'm sorry I behaved like a cow. I think I spend too much time on this train. I know the feeling. Have some water, Jenny. Sorry, it's almost empty...
You certainly did. But you needed a little more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter. I didn't expect it, but I saw Stark's fear. I knew she'd control him.
Isn't that what the mission is all about? Isn't this "what we fight for"? So we can stop the fighting. So we can go home! Every time someone tried to win a war before it started, innocent people died.
Touch them and they engage the reverse thrust. The city won't fall gently. The needle is made of vibranium. If Thor hits it... It will shatter.
One, two, three, four, five. Fifty. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. How much for the car, kid? It was my father's.
Are you in town? What do you mean, what city? Kansas City. Isn't that where you live? Yes, I live in Kansas City. Is your offer serious?
which has no place in American courts. Thank you, Mr. Gould. Mr. Franks, representing the U.S. government. Your opening statement, please. Judge, if this law were to be applied retroactively, it could open up claims against a number of foreign countries, and would only complicate our international relations.
This could be a possible outcome, Your Honor. Ms. Altmann, it would seem that if your case goes ahead, world diplomacy will collapse, and you alone will be responsible. Mr. Schoenberg. Your Honor, and may it please the court... We believe that the application of the FSIA is not impossible retroactively. Why not make it easier to say that it can be applied retroactively?
I won't let you sell. I'll manage. I'll work. It's too late for that. You applied for a scholarship, it was denied.
What the hell is this? When did we get this camera? Dad's old camera... Remember? It works.
The fire extinguisher! Why a bag? I'm reducing the machine to fit into a 55 x 35 cm bag. In portable mode? - It would weigh 4 kg.
I don't know. I thought I thought I'd find something useful, but there's nothing. What the hell is this? When did we get this camera? Here it is.
She reads the film. When did we get this camera? Dad's old camera... Remember it? It works.
It's good, shall we buy it? Don't get carried away. It's absolutely brilliant, no need to touch it. Ideally, you should put your head in the washing machine. So that it's nice and clean.
Because with a 100 m ball of cotton, which I made myself, that's a hell of a lot of absorbent cotton on a little broom head. I've already finished, without wringing it out once. Question... Would you take this broom, which was used to clean the toilet and all that, into the kitchen, where you feed your children? I run the broom head through the machine, and it comes out clean as a whistle.
I'm going to sleep with you. Super sexy! Never mind, I'm coming! This camera is totally lethal. It looks deadly.
Is it a guy or a girl? Tobi sounds like a stripper. "She comes on stage, we applaud her... "Tobi!" The camera's not broken, she's seeing things.
Let's get out of here! What was that? Father Michael, please. Our house has been... It's haunted and it's affecting our daughter.
Yes, I buried it. Deep, near a wind turbine. A wind turbine in the West is vague. It's a special kind of windmill. It sings.
Not even a lock on the door. It never locks. A big nugget hangs over the fireplace. People come from all over to see it. They say it's worth close to $20,000, easy.
The Blocker. Third shot! Out! No, the ball was... too low. For it to count as a hit, it must pass through... the zone.
It's in and around everything that lives. Close your eyes. Feel it. The light. It's always been there. It will guide you.
That sounds really scary. You look really brave. General. I regret to inform you that the map recovered from BB-8 is incomplete. And what's worse, it doesn't correspond to any mapped system.
You see him as the father you never had. He would have disappointed you. Get out of my head. I know you've seen the map. It's in your head.
It's not a joke. He took it as a personal insult. - Tomorrow I'll bring a more appropriate gift. - You will not. And in my presence, you will refer to the Minister's request for what it really is: a bribe.
Show us where they are. We won't be impressed. Show me a map of the western region. We have an old map. Do you know where it is, Gizzard?
And Brooder shouldn't have shot those Mexicans and exacerbated things. I can't honestly tell you how it would have turned out with the Mexicans or if I should have let the vagrant go. But we're here now. You can't go anywhere on this leg. It needs surgery.
They'll come after us. This is the place. It belongs to a farmer, a friend of Felix's. Felix wanted to buy this car, but he wouldn't sell it. I hope it's as fast as it is pretty.
I killed three people in the D.R.C., five or six at Felix's country house, and blew up two in Barcelona. Probably Spanish citizens, killed by an American in Spain. All Spaniards. Here's what I found. The company has a limited liability subsidiary, an import/export thing called the Aquila Company. It handles clandestine operations.
All Spaniards. Here's what I found. The company has a limited liability subsidiary, an import/export thing called the Aquila company. It handles clandestine operations. It hires Spaniards, because it's based in Gibraltar.
And it's the story of your life. It's called Larry Gaye: The Unauthorized Autobiography. Unauthorized autobiography? But an autobiography can't be unauthorized. Or can it?
He was running away from his age, you see. That's why he dressed so well. Why he likes long walks. His hand feels cold. Why is it so cold?
Fetch. Hey. Where's your ball? You lost your ball? Hey. Where is it?
I beg your pardon? When we get to the crossroads, do we go left or right? How do you deal with a tough decision? There's no such thing. When you toss a coin, you know which way you want it to fall.
Damn it! Maybe I can help. You're an amazing man, James King. Let's do it on the new house. It's gotten bigger, hasn't it?
- Right, Mom? - Yes, it's true. What's true? I've heard that story a thousand times. It's still a good one, isn't it?
If I join you, it'll ruin your career. You know it would. I know... but I don't like it. So, are we going to do a full tactile response test of my projection? Soon... I need your help with the other matrix, it's degrading faster than my repairs.
"Golden dreams and heartbreak," "mingle in the soul of this river... called life." "When mountains stand in its way," "it cuts gorges in the rock... to keep flowing."
Master! Master! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! A cave! We never knew it existed! It seems to go all the way to the top of the mountain!
You won't do it again, promise? Looks like he'll make it this time. No, he won't! Look at the mountain! It's touching the clouds... And how many times has it already fallen?
That traitor... that was me! "Golden dreams and heartbreak." "mingle in the soul of this river... called life." "When mountains stand in its way," "it cuts gorges in the rock... to keep flowing."
Lisa Loeb? I can't believe Nick Webber knows the cat trainer's name. Yeah, it's crazy. I just wanted to say that I love this song. It sounds so personal.
I'm Jessica Williams. Tonight's guest is Dame Jennifer Lawrence, who will be talking about her film about the life of Meryl Streep. How do they persuade people to take part in the show? You've all seen the satellite images of the road incident involving two self-driving cars in New Detroit. President Neil Patrick Harris called for stricter auto regulations, and Republicans defended the right of any automobile to shoot a black car if it looks suspicious.
We solve our own problems. I like that. I'm in. And I want to change my shirt. I've been wearing it for three days and it's garish.
What was he? Nobody gets up after being shot four times, it's inhuman. Subcutaneous titanium armor. It is injected into the skin in liquid form. It is flexible and extremely resistant.
- Goodbye. - Goodbye, dear. Oh, I'm so glad. Sell the house, Marianne. You're the heiress. It's yours now.
- Yeah, I get it, man. It's just that I'm looking at you right now and your head is the size of a... Tangerine. And the rest of your body is normal size. It's just your head, it's tiny.
hombres Dos. Uno de ellos Que esta tocando. The surface is fine and powdery. I can make it fly with the tip of my foot. - It adheres in thin layers, like coal dust...
Marlon Brando, Daniel D. Lewis, OK? Ed Norton! Ed Norton must have joined the Aryan Brotherhood for American History. The guy's got a fucking swastika tattooed on his chest, Brody. On his fucking chest! And it's still there, by the way.
- Right, okay. So you're going through this rough patch and all of a sudden, you find yourself in the middle of... I guess you could call it a surreal experience. Tell me a little more about it. How did you... experience things? Well, when you're staring death in the face, and it's staring you in the face, it's scary too.
It could happen. - Sometime next week. - I'll do it. - I've got an idea. - Uh-oh. - That's a good one.
That's what makes this work so special. If you have any questions, come and see me. Excuse me. Just one second. It'll double in value in a year.
I'm going to work for a while. Are you making dinner? You were brave. I'm calling about the Jacobs' house. I'm looking at the ads, is it still for sale?
Well, there aren't 36 roads. Hawkstone. Hawkstone? By the train wreck. So, how did you get across the tracks? Your car was parked on the other side of the tracks. So that's where it was before the accident.
By the train wreck. So, how did you get across the tracks? Your car was parked on the other side of the tracks. So that's where it was before the accident. We found this tonight in the signal box. And I'm pretty sure it belonged to... this girl,
I'm sure that bitch told you about us. Briefly. - Did she tell you about my cock? - Not in detail. It's big.
I believe in life after death. So why am I a doctor? Why do I work so hard to keep people alive? Because reincarnation is a load of rubbish. We've only got one life, and it's worthless.
Move to your mouth and chin. Shift your attention slightly to the tip of your nose. Let the energy spread further and further out of your body, until it fills the room. Move this ball of energy to the field outside. Once outside, let it expand.
Shift your attention slightly to the tip of your nose. Let the energy spread further and further out of your body, until it fills the room. Move this ball of energy to the field outside. Once it's out there, let it expand. Let it float up until it reaches the moon.
You're tripping, I don't like it. Why don't you say you like my short story? I don't know! I'm just jealous! It's better than mine.
If you sincerely believe this, you may well aspire to the crown as well as the title of Thane of Cawdor. But it's strange, and often, to lure us to our doom, the forces of darkness tell us truths, they seduce us with innocent trifles, the better to betray us when the consequences are felt. This supernatural solicitation can't be bad, can't be good. If it's bad, why has it given me a guarantee of success by starting with a truth?
All I have to press the flanks of my will is the spur of an inordinate ambition that takes too much momentum and allows itself to be thrown off course. We'll go no further in this matter. Has she since fallen asleep? And has she only just woken up to look so pale and greenish before what she so willingly contemplated?
But I have words to say that should be howled in a desert where no ear could grasp them. My dearest cousin. Is Scotland still in the same state? Alas, poor country, She is almost afraid to recognize herself.
My life has been cursed and can only be interrupted by a man not born of woman. Count no more on this magic trick And let the angel you've always served tell you that Macduff was torn from his mother's womb prematurely. Curse the mouth that tells me, for it has just destroyed the best in me.
-I want an alliance. No, what you want is revenge! -That's not for me. It's about putting an end to a system that says one group is more deserving than another. This city may be surrounded by a wall, but it doesn't have to be a prison.
- Okay, good idea. Rocky, have you seen a blinding white light? Actually, that light does exist. Do you know what the epiphysis is? It produces DMT, which is also in our serum.
- Yes, she is. - She's a tigress. - I know she is. She's a unique specimen. She's priceless.
Your farm? My inheritance. Which was my home when my parents died. My uncle left it to me. It's a bit run-down now, but it was the prettiest one around.
My inheritance. Which was my house when my parents died. My uncle left it to me. It's a bit run-down now, but it was the most beautiful around. I want it to be again.
You! What the hell are you doing? I brought smoke. We just changed the bottle. It's expired.
It's your mother's, I'm used to it. You remember things in a different way, don't you? The reason for all this is to renovate the house. Well, you can paint it. And if it squeaks, I can oil it.
Excuse me, tell me... I'm afraid she's so distressed that she doesn't understand why everyone's suddenly come to see her. I don't know if Mom is aware of her condition. This conversation is painful for me. It's hard for you... but we have to talk about it.
I had just proposed to her, and we were on our way home. There was... this song she loved on the radio. She looked... so happy. Then all of a sudden... a car came out of nowhere. It slammed into us, and we ended up in a lake.
,But it will take us an hour to locate you. That'll be too late. Do everything you can to conserve your oxygen. We'll reassemble the turret. Will it hold?
1 million pounds. Did you bring the treasury bonds? I think I'll keep the money and the vase. - Last time, you had me fooled. I paid 3 million for this tapestry... only to find out it was only worth one.
Your Highness, I'm not the one sent to make peace. I will not go. The location of the legendary fortress of Alcaman has long been forgotten, along with all its secret magic. Wise kings have realized that magic is best left alone. It's too powerful in mortal hands.
Look what the rats brought in. Gorak, it's been so long. Roland, you're looking for something rare. A map that doesn't even exist. That's right, it doesn't exist.
Gorak, it's been so long. Roland, you're looking for something rare. A card that doesn't even exist. That's right, it doesn't exist. But if it did, it would be the only way to avoid the dragon that guards the forest.
The crown. - The crown? - It must be in here. Finally, something easy to find. Too bad it won't be yours.
Oh, you think that's too much? No, no, no. I think it's good. I think we have to keep constantly shocking the viewer. I mean, if it's too much, we can change it later, right?
She suspected this, but she had to be sure. So, in the house, we're under protection. So ... Inna goes to apply ointment 938 00:56:26,484 -- 00:56:28,851 on Katarina, Jenny, and Ethan. She says she should protect them.
First-rate DeLorean fans. A couple of guys in Los Angeles, Joe Walser and Terry Matalas in particular, owned a DeLorean that they had transformed into the DeLorean from Back to the Future. Bob was understandably very disappointed with the condition of the famous car, and told us, "We've got to do something." The guy from the lot at the back of the studios, Fred Diedrich, called us over with Terry's car, and we showed him what it might look like.
We maxed out our credit card to buy a DeLorean, and turned it into a time-traveling car. I should mention that we built this machine. That was about fifteen years ago. All we had as a model was a videotape. From a distance, it was perfect.
If a poor farmer has to go to Monsanto to buy seed, and expensive seed at that, then I didn't know about transgenics. A genetically modified seed, I didn't think about it. Even the seed monopoly is a bad thing. So farmers go into debt to buy the seed because of the high price, 17,000% more. They go further into debt because it doesn't deliver on its promise of pest control, so they have to buy more pesticides.
So farmers go into debt to buy the seed because of the high price, 17,000% more. They go further into debt because it doesn't deliver on its promise of pest control, so they have to buy more pesticides. The tragedy with chemicals, whether fertilizers or pesticides, is that they're what's known as ecological drugs: the more you use them, the more you need to use them. The more you use them, the more you need to use them. For a while, the harvest of a crop increases, then it starts to decrease because you've contaminated the earth, the soil.
"The neighbors said they found my husband lying in the field." In the last sixteen years, there have been over 250,000 farmer suicides recorded in India. That's about one farmer every thirty minutes. And it's the biggest wave of suicides recorded in history. While the impact of fashion on our world is becoming increasingly clear, a large body of research suggests that it is also having a growing effect on us, the people who buy these clothes.
As consumers, they are part of the problem. We hope to encourage our customers to join us in questioning consumption. Because without a reduction in consumption, we don't think we can work together to find a solution to the problems that collectively, year after year, are causing a steady decline in the health of our planet. The fashion industry needs to think. It needs to take the time to think about the way it works... FASHION CREATOR ... in the conventional way, and call it into question.
Because if you work in a capitalist system, the most important thing is to generate profit, and you need to generate more profit than your competitors. And that's what drives companies to lower and lower wages. But companies... Fashion stores only go to places like Bangladesh to get the cheapest possible labor. There are no collective rights in Bangladesh, there are no trade union rights, there's a very low minimum wage, there's no maternity benefit, no pension, which is why the fashion industry goes to Bangladesh because it can make the biggest profits from these people who make the clothes for them.
So don't bother trying to improve their conditions, just take care of the system, or it won't be worth it. Our economic system is part of consumer capitalism, and that's why the government has to keep consumption at a very high level. That's why companies do it, and that's why at some level, most of them buy into it. I couldn't tell you the number of people who say, "But if we were less materialistic, our economy would collapse." They're right on some level, because our economy is based on materialism, on those kinds of values. That's what it needs to survive.

They've never bitten me. - But people who work with bees often do. - Royal jelly? What's royal jelly? - A special secretion from the glands of worker bees. It's royal because?
- But people who work with bees often do. - Royal jelly? What's royal jelly? - A special secretion from the glands of worker bees. It's royal because? - It feeds the queen.
You know, a few years ago, I would have been able to tell you everything about the woman in the photograph. I would have remembered what happened to her. Victim or perpetrator. But that night... I couldn't remember. I was certain of only one thing: this was my last case, and that's why I left the profession. I came here to join my bees. So I decided to put the whole story down on paper. As it was, and not... as John had imagined it.
- He does. He comes home early, before his wife, and I suck his cock until I cry. His dick is too big, I feel my lips about to tear. What's too big? How big is it?
What's on the key? No idea, but we're about to find out. Crap. We gotta get out of here They hacked the key now They know where it is.
She, because yes, she was a woman, she was the best in the world at infiltrating impenetrable places and then disappearing without a trace. I must admit. This story has always fascinated me. Its heroine and ultimate tragedy, because the explosion didn't kill the intended target. Instead, it took the lives of her three young children and their mother.
Lie still, don't move I think this should be our last face-to-face. You hid it on me? That tie really didn't suit you. It had to serve a purpose.
You mean satisfy him? Like Jerry in the pool. No, that's not what she means. I just mean that I don't like my life to be complicated. I like it just the way it is.
Come... Take a look. In spring, come here every day and you'll be able to see the flow of my life. If the water is clear, you'll know that my life is also clear and serene. If it's muddy, you'll know that I'm in danger.
Is there a problem? I was driving under the legal limit. No, it's not your fault. It's your car. It's leaking oil.
Welcome home. This house belonged to Beverly Brown. Yes. But it's your home now. And like all the houses in Wayward Pines, it's equipped with a state-of-the-art alarm system.
The handsome new doorman, texts me. - Hey, how's it going? - And I lied to Bruce first when I never gave him a chance to be my first. I hope the day continues to be good. If it wasn't, I hope it will be...
Yeah. - Hey. - You got your dick? You got your dick, Naomi? If I had it, would it take me anywhere with you?
So we're going to take this opportunity to leave the farm. To go where? We can't see ourselves living here for two more years without sheep, with the debts piling up. And no one knows if the scrapie won't come back. She doesn't have to come back, Villi.
Come on, Kitty. Dear Sandra... It's me, Herbert. It's slowly getting worse. This is my voice. It's fading.
Dear Sandra... - It's me, Herbert. - As far as I'm concerned, you're dead. It's slowly getting worse. This is my voice. It's disappearing.
Take care of yourself. "For Sandra and Ronja." Dear Sandra, it's me, Herbert. It's slowly getting worse. This is my voice. It's disappearing.
That's why it was evaluated. We've got a problem. Ethan Burke's wife might be looking for it. This is your car. It's leaking oil.
I have my whole life ahead of me, and I'd like to become an actress. I don't want to rely on my beauty. So, do you study? Or do you just watch reality TV? I don't mind irony... but it's unhealthy and poisonous, and it has a force of its own...
Reverend, please, I need to see her. We've already discussed this, Rose. It's best she stays in church. Mrs Gray, would you allow me to see Angela's room? It's upstairs.
Behind the door. Whispers. Which door are you talking about? My old bedroom door. It opens.
So it's just a fucking theory? Yes. It's a fucking theory! Everybody, we've got a fucking theory! This thing, it takes hold of you,
Well, I'm not. Well, kid... the old team's back together. Let's get this ship in the air. Let's get one thing clear. I'm not the Chosen One and the prophecy wasn't about me, assuming it even exists.
It's okay, it's okay. You're probably right. I mean, it's like rule #1 of journalism. "Never let emotion cloud your judgment or the public has a right to know." Man, all I have to do at work is listen to music and say if it's good.
- Springsteen, The Stones, The Hollies. - Mmm. I was obsessed with this song, "The Air that I breathe." I love that song. It's so good.
I'm not going to stop you. Let's just leave it at that. - You still want my bone marrow? - I'm going to need it. - It's yours.
How old are you? That's none of your business. Over 40? All right, you're drunk, and this conversation is over. Yes, I am, and, no, it's not.
Against what? Something we can't stop. I know it sounds crazy, but you've seen what it can do. And you've felt it. It's a gift. You have no idea what this thing is or what else it can do.
You didn't want to see her in her hospital bed, all alone, but she's dead and you can't bring her back. No! No, no, no, no. I'm not going to let them take that thing. You know what she showed me?
Together, we're going to take steps to prepare for what's to come. You may have noticed that the weather has been a bit temperamental of late. You may have wondered what might happen next. A flood! So gigantic that it could cover the Earth, sweeping away and destroying everything in its path!
I'm so sorry! I can't help it when someone tickles my nostrils. Bless you! Thank you. Oh oh, the water, it's already here!
You Nestrians sure know how to make things comfortable, don't you? You bet. We should reach the top by morning. But the flood. It seems endless.
But you still tried to save me. Wha... Mal... No! All I have is that I'm soaked. And this stone is for you.
Nothing has changed for centuries. In 13 years of independence, nothing has changed. No schools, no hospitals, no roads... See that mountain? It imprisons the village of Gehlore.
what do you say? You really do have a vivid imagination, don't you, nigger? So you intend to kill me because of the nigger and his crazy theory? Can you prove it, cabron? It's not that far-fetched, Senior Bob.
But even if we'd never had children, I'd never consider leaving my wife. Even if it was just the two of us, on our own, we'd go on trips. We'd go to Portofino in Italy or some Greek island for the summer. And then our relationship would be as intense as it was in the beginning.
We need backup, call Kung Fury. Oh, yeah, that's my bicep. A second doll. Hello? Hello? Hello? We've got an arcade machine that's gone mad, it's killing everyone, it's chaos here, we need...
It's Dougal. He's just found out his wife died of a sudden illness, and he's violent and drunk. What happened? What's happened? It was a fever. The nurse said it was gone in a day.
And where are we now? I think I have a theory. What theory? You won't like my theory. It's better than the one we have, which is none.
But how did you achieve all this in such a short space of time? They helped me, sir. Otherwise it wouldn't have been possible. But the idea was yours. If you hadn't had so much light in you, it would never have reflected here.
The company was threatening to close down, so I simply presented Ted with an alternative. His methods may seem unorthodox, but you can't deny the results. After that nasty stunt you pulled in junior high! The only school that would take me was a university in Romania. But it turns out, it had a good MBA program, a brand new innovation in business.
They'll eat you alive. Literally. Literally, literally. Not the way people usually say it. You never know if you're the kind of guy who'd jump on a bomb before it landed at your feet.
When he's angry, it's a black anger. But when he's happy, his dogs get a double ration. The strongest moment was when you answered my signal for the arrow. That's when I knew we could do it. The arrow almost fell, it was balanced.
But when he's happy, his dogs get double rations. The strongest moment was when you answered my signal for the arrow. That's when I knew we could do it. The arrow almost fell, it was balanced. No, it was exactly where I aimed.
I've got an idea. What do you think? Let's go see this house. I really think you're going to love it. It's got a big garden, it's around the corner, and it's private, very private.
I know what you're thinking. "It's impossible. How could we be in 4028? How could we have skipped that long?" What if I told you that this mouse could put itself in a state where it could survive all winter without eating, without drinking, and actually live longer in the end?
- Poison. Would you like some? Very funny, go on. - A new CD store? - Who owns it?
- Yeah. Holy crap! That banana saved your life! That's Ronald's watch. And it still works!
Hi, there. Are you okay? Yeah, I was just looking for your earring. - Oh, it's... - Oh, it's right here.
Are you okay? Yeah, I was just looking for your earring. - Oh, it's... - Oh, it's here. - It's right here.
- No, sir. - Yes, Chief. You know what this is worth to you, Katherin McVitie? A hundred lashes. You may think your life is miserable now, but it'll be worse after 100 lashes.
Joan. Just like my mother. I'm in touch with two worlds: those who have passed to the other side and those who are not yet born. There's a soul waiting for you to give it life. - It would die.
I'm afraid so. Mr. Molloy told me about the letter from your wife. - Did he? - Would you let me read it? It arrived the day before we left England.
Amazing job with Mary's lyrics. It was really great. Thank you. Great job on the letter. I almost thought it was real.
- Stop pushing my leg. - More than you know. I like you, Rachel, despite all the crap I give you. You know what, I really don't like this. If you really want to do this, Rachel, you have to be willing to drive the car as fast as it will take you.
Stop it. Someone with enough money to sit on the board spends a fortune on lines of coke on a Saturday night. Where's that glass of water? My God, all this bowing and scraping. He may think this little shindig is for him, but it's for us.
Just my father, my brother and me. Your father raised you... - in a way. - What does he do? He was a molder at the foundry before it closed.
- No. No, no, no. No, no, no. It's pretty good. But here's the thing... a crew's banner is a sacred thing. It must both strike fear into the hearts of hardened men and inspire a spirit of union for all who will sail under it.
You look lovely. New dress? It was on sale. Do you like it? I wish it wasn't black.
Previously... Where's daddy? This school... it's not like the others.
I think he's over there. What are you doing? What are you doing? We can't meet here. - I thought this room was clean. - It's clean.
You know what I mean? I kind of... Let's just... No, let's just be quiet and think about this. This music is so disorienting. Is it coming from the front or the back?
You like it. Forget everything else. Is it that simple for you? Just be honest. Baby, life isn't always what you want it to be.
- Even if you are... - You're what? - You're back in jail. - You made me a promise. - It still stands. I'm innocent!
I always have a very simple dinner at home. I don't want any, thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. We've met before, you know. Forgive me, my memory isn't what it used to be.
Even though I'm no longer the housekeeper, I can still keep an eye on the house. As a friend. I lock the house. I suppose it could be sold. But it's yours now.
Clergy to ease minds. Provisions for all, lasting six months or even a year. Three ships to carry them, sailors to sail them. And an honest governor, the first to supervise everything himself. In short, you set up a colony, put it aboard these ships to sail across the Atlantic, and hope that when it arrives, it will get used to the environment and be able to resist the various attempts to thwart a stable trade.
- Walk away? This business is shaky. How long before the street realizes it? How long before the crowd comes to your door again? What happens if this time they refuse to go away?
What about your speech? Got any good jokes? The ice drill is on its way. It is? It left Oslo this morning, arriving on Wednesday.
Looks like it's just you and me, kid. Hey, babe. How's the house? Hi! It's perfect.
I've had enough. Yes. I'll leave you to pray then. Marie. The cup I must drink... how bitter it is.
This is where we used to keep people who went crazy on the assembly line. What's behind that door? A fireman's emergency ramp. So you didn't get an offer on this house? People seem afraid of it because it's haunted... and disgusting.
It's not even 9 o'clock in the evening. Even Oma hasn't gone to bed. Why is there weed in your freezer? A colleague gave it to me for my migraines. I get them from time to time. It's in the freezer because I read that it keeps all its potency.
Why am I supporting you as captain? Yes. That night, when I fell into the water after Andromache, I remember losing my footing on deck. I remember trying to grab your hand as I fell. And the last thing I remember before I was in the water was that it slipped out of my grasp.
I'm, like, your friend and your aunt. I'm your tamie. ((Aunt+Amie)) Yeah. Anyway, I have something I want to talk to you about. It's a big news story, well it's in three parts.
And with this light, it's almost uglier. It's unique. It's a big statement, it has its beauty. See, she's already getting bigger.
Hey, I'm ready too. Almost, your tie's crooked. Oh. Hey, you're not wearing the ring. Yeah, that's 'cause it's new.
And I don't think it was a coincidence. I think she intended to give him something. A... a stone. I think that's what he was looking for in her apartment, and he took it from me and ran. Wait, this rock, what did it look like?
I think she intended to give him something. A... a stone. I think that's what he was looking for in her apartment, and he took it from me and ran. Wait, this stone, what did it look like? How big is it?
No, I meant about the antibodies transmitted by the mother's milk? Breastfed babies have significantly less bacterial colonization in the feeding tube. How do you know this? I read it in The Lancet. Your room has been aired but it was unoccupied for a while so it may smell damp.
No need, I've updated the log. You can update the list. It looks really effective. In the meantime, what about the patient's hypertension? I hope it resolves.
They call me... and I wish they hadn't. You're confused. You try to hide it, but you can't... The pain will go away, Abigail. - It won't last, I promise.
You're confused. You try to hide it, but you can't... The pain will go away, Abigail. - It won't last, I promise. - It won't stop!
Roll up your sleeves! Sometimes I think there's as much embellishment in your head as there is on your hat. King Henry VIII, married six times: one dead, one surviving, two divorced, two beheaded. Poor Anne Boleyn was the first to have her head cut off with a very sharp sword. A good swing and she was off!
- My goodness. It's one of those things - that I've only read about. - What I remember most is the awful smell. You know, like... Like a nosebleed. It gets everywhere.
I've never seen anything like it, Doctor. A fracture. - I swear we haven't... - No, of course not, Mrs. Bishop. The fontanel is wider than it should be.
But June needs someone who understands her completely, and that person... is the father of her child. I think Nurse Franklin's right. - You want to hear my news? - You've made such a fuss about it, I'm afraid she's not up to the job.
Even during the war. Blue for your sister, yellow for you. Cigarette? I don't like smoking in the store. The smell permeates the wool, and I'm not sure it will wash out.
Few of the kingdom's creatures appreciate rain. Elephants, at least, can apply the wet mud to their backs, which acts as a sunscreen as it dries. The monsoon winds that blow across the Himalayas have brought more rain in recent weeks than at any time during the rest of the year. The water penetrates deep into the soil. In a few months' time, we'll have plenty of fruit to harvest.
Yeah! Oh, it's a little squirrel girl! Oh, she's eating him! Look at her big bushy tail. Oh, she's cute.
Control! This is Hammer 19, do you copy? Over. Question about the target. It's in an area populated by civilians.
Stolen? You hurt my feelings. You don't even want to come up and see the house. - I can see it from here. - But it has a certain charm. My father let it fall into disrepair, but it's steeped in history.
I don't know. It looks like the house of a woman who lives with her cats and is going to die alone. Not here, anyway. She can't afford it. If someone doesn't buy this house by next week, it'll go to the bank.
We need to gather intelligence on the enemy. This information could give us the upper hand in the event of a thermonuclear conflict with the Soviet Union. Or prevent such a conflict. To the people, as far as your wife, your mother or the Lord are concerned, your mission is non-existent. If it doesn't exist, you don't exist.
She's probably hoping to up her game. Not with me, she isn't. Here comes the cheese. A transient banana. It doesn't work.
Although... Tempting. You'll laugh. The machine's broken down. We used it this morning. It must work.
At my first speech here, - we talked about "chung-mania". - I remember, yes. I was thrilled to have a mania named after him. I had "chung-manie-manie". I love that story. It's so funny.
Um... Yeah, all right. I'm fine with ice cream. It's weird here, how people like to wait in line? This honey-lavender ice cream is delicious, but is it really worth the 45-minute wait?
- But what? You've only just arrived, haven't you? It'll be better for us. Better for me. Well, this town is really great on Halloween, but it can also get kind of crazy, so...
I'm starting on Monday, but I want to empty it before I change it. You're getting a new car? Yes. A Mercedes hybrid. - It rocks.
But it's the right decision. - You don't want bad rumors to kill such a great idea. Like with your app. What do you mean, with my app? Everyone said it sucked and you finally gave up.
The world has come a long way since you died, Cage. Integrated drones, anti-aircraft countermeasures and fuel tanks big enough to fly over the planet three times without needing to land. You can put your coat in the checkroom. Believe me, no one will dare steal it. But it could save itself.
I think you'll do the trick. You'll what? And then you're just going to go through it and then like that. If I was going to live the same day over and over again, I wanted it to be a day worth living.
How do you know this place, my beloved? Tell me where we're going. Why don't you answer me? Tell me what we're doing here. My love, tell me what's going on.
You know what happens if he doesn't come. I'll start with the little boy. Take the girl and go. The venom will reveal what's hidden from you. It will show you things you don't want to see.
No! Get out of the way! Go, go, go! How could you? He trusted me.
The freight elevator, you say? It's got four motors. That's more than enough power. It's not designed for a space launch. I don't know if it would hold up on entry.
Fortunately, I knew a few magic tricks. However, one problem remained. The name Smurfette tells us nothing about her. Okay, the physical properties are... It doesn't tell us who she is.
Le Détecteur du Truc Smurfant, test 1.03. - Ready, strong Smurf? It's working! This thing really gets me. It determines Smurfy's dominant character.
You're just in time to witness a historic moment in science. What's going on around here? None of your business, Nosy Smurf. All right, then. If your vegetable hat can tell us that Strong Smurf is strong, maybe it can tell me what an Ette is.
Show me the house of the Smurf who wore that hat. You've been looking for these blue creatures for a long time. But this hat comes from a completely different place. Yes. Where? Where does it come from?
It's not possible, my demon friend. Forgive me, you and Jason Blood, but your future bodes a common fate. Imprisoned in human form, I merge with you, the demon Etrigan. Thus began my life in perpetuity in Etrigan's company. I didn't think you'd let me have it. And while this piece may be useless without its other half, it's far from harmless.

I didn't think you'd let me have it. And this piece may be useless without its other half, but it's far from harmless. It's safe here.
What's going on? If this were a computer, it'd be on the fritz. Cheers. Felix Faust has taken precautions not to be found. There's another way, but you'd have to ask a favor of someone I'm not on good terms with.
You're the one who says that, even though you've escaped everything? Ever since you infected me, I've been looking everywhere for a cure and I've finally found it. A shard of the Stone of Dreams. It's alive. He told me the Demonic Triad could summon the rest to Earth.
10 years. Soon, we'll be paying for café crème on credit. We tip 20%. We'll do that. That'll pay for his cruise. So, I've got a rhubarb tart, a blueberry crumble - he's a bit stale - and a chocolate cake.
At some point, I'm going to have to go home on my own. I'm 14 years old. No way, baby. This neighborhood has changed a lot in 40 years. Yes, it's safer and more middle-class.
Talk to her, Joe. You're a selfish bastard. I don't get it, Willie. I would have given you my kidney. It's probably not fresh.
Local food. Awareness programs to encourage children to think differently. To help them realize that...yes, it's possible... There was a time when this port welcomed thousands of ships from all over the world. Now it can be reborn again.
It's like... Sometimes the world is just perfect. - I know it is. - Sometimes it's not. Most of it isn't. But when it is, it's just...
And right now, I've never been in a worse position. I need a plan B. I need it now! Because I have no idea and I'm freaking out. All right, listen. Whatever the problem is, it's not getting any worse tonight.
We'll save ourselves another panic attack. Number? I didn't memorize it. - You haven't? - It's in my cell phone.
Yes, I'll take my foot off right now. But before I do, let me explain. Important announcement. If anyone finds a 5 cm penis, give it back to the principal. It's his.
You got it? Where you headed? - I live here. Your license. - It's at my place.
You cut the wrong kite. You messed up! Oh no... It takes flight, it flies and flies away, my heart flew away like a kite. It takes flight, it flies and flies away, my heart flew away like a kite.
Where's he going? Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! The soldiers' camp is still in motion. My guards think they know where he is.
We're all set. Sorry, I was distracted. Please repeat the question. As usual, Watson, you see but you don't observe. For you, the world is an impenetrable mystery. Whereas it's an open book to me.
Russian secret service. Specialist in counter-intelligence in Europe. Responsible for the deaths of nine of our agents. The most dangerous man alive. With a CV like that, why isn't he in the file?
Satan's Snow. - It's right at ground level. - Just? This toxic agent is used at high altitude. It can cover an area 100 times larger than this village.
- It's good! It's good! Greco. This is your man. He's Russian, under an assumed name. He manufactures dental supplies, drill bits,
My MI6 traitor. If you doubt the danger you're in, I have a copy of this file ready to send to your boss, Gisela Summer. You must return the device your colleagues stole from me in Rome. It contains a secret they must not discover.
If you have any doubts about the danger you're in, I have a copy of this file ready to send to your boss, Gisela Summer. You must return the device your colleagues stole from me in Rome. It contains a secret they must not discover. The longer it remains in your possession, the greater the risk to my mission.
Agent Volkov. I'm sorry, but I'm more interested in Mr. Miller. Of course you are. Do you have the module? It's in a bit of a state.
We'll treat you at the embassy. - Did your captors beat you up? - Yes, but I'm fine. The drone's control module and our files on Barovski. He's very dangerous, but we'll subdue him.
Just like that? Just like that. Why is it on? The geothermal plants are automated, so they'll power the country for a while. Before it collapses?
Remember the glacier? And the water? This is the water. When the ice melts, it creates this river. The glacier slides a little further, refreezes...
If that's the best you can come up with, get to work! Very well, then. Get up! On your feet! Did you see that? It's bleeding!
- No, you won't. - Keep your scars. I want to see your bag. Why should you? It's too heavy.
But it's over. There's a hole at the top. Recently, it was on a wall. So rupture. The paper absorbed steam and odors, so it had to be displayed in the kitchen.
I'm high, not romantic. - We're getting to that. - I know, I have a plan. What plan? - What's up? What's up?
- Its power? - It will destroy the house and us. Your neighbors should be safe, but it's on the floor. Is the café downstairs open? - Sunday morning. It's closed.
- Guide her? Are you there? Yes, just a moment. Let's get the plane away from all populated areas. - It must crash at sea.
Try not to drown. What? I'm finding you. - I'm finding you. - Please hurry. I haven't got much time. He's leaning.
Teddy, release the clip. We're on schedule to release the most adorable puppy ever. We'll be launching it at the Las Vegas Dog Show. Watch out! He'll blow the competition out of the water!
I don't usually write much, but I've discovered the importance of memos. Even though I didn't go to business school, I learned to share in kindergarten. If there's not enough love for both of us, I want to give you all mine. I'd like to offer you a job. You'll have to work hard, for free.
I'm Groot. "Raccoon." Whatever. How do you kill a Celeste? There's a core. His brain, his heart, whatever it is...
I know it's not enough, I know. I know it's enough, but it's the way I am. Chapter One. Once upon a time in a kingdom called Delaine, there was a king with two sons. Delaine was a very old kingdom and it had hundreds of kings, maybe even thousands.
It's not real. It's not like... I imagined. It pains me to see it that way. I'm sorry, Gardner, but the world isn't always the way you want it to be. - It gave me you.
What's this? This is... a golden pig. Pure gold. In ancient times, the elders gave their daughters a golden pig as a wedding gift. Mija, it's yours now.
It was there that I considered new and better ways of doing business. When my sister was CEO... Which lake was it? Moose Lake. When my sister was CEO, she dumped so much waste into that lake that it exploded.
So I have to deal with the leak all day? Do you realize what this means? Did you put in a bucket? Yes! But it filled up and overflowed.
All aboard, Sonny Jim. I hid the money. I counted it... 425 000 $. Don't worry about it. It's in the stash.
What is this place? Where are we? Dougie, what's wrong with your arm? I don't know. I think it fell asleep. I think it fell asleep.
Especially his liver. Perfect for Terence. Perfect for Terence. His liver will never end up on the national list. It'll go straight to your nephew.
- Did you get the job? - Yes, I got it. I fought all the way. I earned it. Was it worth it?
Yes, of course. Why did you wait so long? To get back. The passage was closed. I had to wait for it to open again.
Claire too. I can handle it. What about Radovan? I know where he is. I have a plan, but it's dangerous.
That K'un-Lun needs protection. This is your mission. Look at the mess you've made here. I've seen this world. I don't think it's worthy of our struggle.
We got the payment. No, it wasn't late. But it was $78.13 for a bill of $78.31.
I don't believe it! Do you think he's here? Mercer, are you there? You're gutting a deer to make a chandelier? We know you're in there. We saw your truck.
Do you understand? Do you? I never thought you'd stoop to such gossip. You had no right to take that necklace. It belongs to me and to the estate.
And Monarch? What's his stud fee? Breeders are well informed. They know. They're waiting for a fire sale to get him at the right price. Whistler painted a portrait of my grandmother. - She built this place. - I'm not an art dealer. But it's worth two million dollars.
So tell me. We can't let them drink too much at once. I'm full of hay, dust and manure. Just tell me. What are you afraid of? There's a program that could help us with the horses, but it involves doing something I don't like. Go back to prison.
We mate them with this superb stallion you have here. Total market value. And we release the foals onto my property. You win. What's your price? You say that the Educational Program was a mistake, that it's wrong and that all horses should be released.
New blood! It says $24,000. Do I hear $25,000? That money was for you. Now it's going to people who need it.
Hush now. The desert is unforgiving. Even for its own children. Eat... or be eaten. Sometimes there's room for everyone.
Yes. Excuse me, just... One more time. I can't find my DVD. It's right here, sweetie.
Come on. Come on. Hold still! Where's it coming from? From a field over there. There's plenty of it!
There's not much we can do, if that's who I think it is. But we can stop this plane. If we could get to the radio, we could get the air force to shoot it down. No. If it crashes, it'll wipe out everything within a radius of 80 km.
No. If it crashes, it'll wipe out everything within a radius of 80 km. We've got to immobilize it! Bad news. It's on a timer.
I don't work for anybody. You don't have a choice, Dom. We're going to have this conversation one way or another. That's a funny spell. He's crafty.
You don't have a choice, Dom. We're going to have this conversation one way or another. It's a funny spell. It's tricky. It can bring you beautiful things, and it can also bring you moments like this.
Simple solutions could simply... For the Eye of God to trace these fake pings, The means using a free relay. Look at these two. Which means it has a quantity of decomposition synchronization.
No. Don't press here. I've got it. Something's wrong with it. It won't launch.
Good for you? Spyder is the pizza delivery man. Carlos Manuel Ochoa, alias Spyder, with a "y", linked to the Sinaloa cartel. He allegedly killed a waitress who misspelled his name. Not obvious, there's a "y". In a nutshell.
Thank you, Mr. Thoyt, you may leave us. Mr. Pettifer, I hope the report from the Africa office is as complete as Mr. Wilton's from the reporting office. According to the documents, he went to Cabinda aboard a ship called Cornwallis, then aboard a ship called Influence, bound for Antigua. It was a slave ship. It sank off the Gold Coast, and Delaney was presumed dead.
For nine years, Mr. Chichester, you wrote to my office every year. Every year, on July 10. July 10 is the anniversary of the sinking... the sinking of the ship L'Influence. Of course, that's not the boat's real name. Its name was changed and its papers altered when it loaded humans in the port of Cabinda.
But these slaves were nevertheless loaded aboard by the Company. As part of a thriving illicit network. This was done for personal profit. The ship was officially registered as leaving Cabinda empty. That's why it sailed with a skeleton crew.
A famous lunatic. With explosive fits of anger. May he rest in peace until revived by his Savior. Slowly, slowly, through the potholed roads. The chlorate is still there, just asleep.
Cholera. Cholera? Where is this cholera now? Hendon Road. Down by the Fleet and Kilburn rivers.
♪ Standing on the bridge ♪ ♪ It was that damned Bonaparte! I passed the rope to his... ♪ My boat's in fucking pieces, Godfrey. It's in fucking pieces.
And yet you're a rationalist. What kind of rational man believes in justice? I'm investigating the sinking of a sloop called the Cornwallis, renamed the Influence, off the coast of Cabinda in July 1804. Mr. Delaney... I have strong reason to believe that you were on board this vessel the night it sank.
He's got a gun. Oh, my God, Russ! You put a gun in this car? What the hell were you thinking? - It was out front on the floor.
- It was out in front on the floor. - I didn't know it was a revolver! He could have killed himself! It could have killed us all! It was at my feet, I pushed it out of the way.
It's not Karzai. Try to understand, it's like raising a child. A child needs both parents. Who love him and who love each other. That's what he needs most of all.
It's me, sir. Sorry to wake you. We've got a situation. The Rolling Stone article is out, and it's not good. It says we're insulting our president.
It's just before the ring road. I drove by it! I love your house. Makes you wonder who built this mansion! It reminds me of a Hopper painting.
Not bad. How's that for dirty? What's this? What's this? It's my vibrator. It turns itself on.
You fell! That was over-canon! Jess, you were supposed to catch me. I forgot this bit, sorry. It's so important!
I had an erotic dream with him, I didn't tell you. Yes, you did. - To everyone. - By text. He was brushing my hair...
I take that back. It's not nothing. It's immensity. The ocean is powerful. And above all, it's vast.
It's not nothing. It's immensity. The ocean is powerful. Above all, it's vast. It's full of life, full of mystery.
- Diwata. Howie. The children of the council unite, don't they? This is my private blog. It's getting famous, lately...
About Abraham Lincoln? As a teenager. I really respect Abraham Lincoln. When I was in fifth grade, I entered this contest, not at the national level. There were only three districts.
Don't you have any computers? Sophie has her laptop. If she can trace where the money came from, we can at least tell the revenue service. Or keep the money. It's not yours to keep.
Or keep the money. It doesn't belong to you. But I could pay you, and pay back all the money you've loaned me over the last few decades. We could use the money. Not if it doesn't belong to you.
Your royal highnesses, my lords, ladies and gentlemen, good evening. There's someone very special I'd like you to meet tonight. He's come straight from the battlefield, fighting for us and with us. No one does the biryani sheep better than he does, and I'm proud to call him my friend. Here's to his noble empire and the good he's doing for our country.
Thank you, Mr. Billimoria... Rusi. I'm honored. I may be a white man on the outside, folks. But this heart, it's Indian.
Ah yes, our local hero. Jemadar Gurung. Jemadar Sarabjit Singh. Mr. Billimoria, where shall we send the body? Where it came from!
He worked from sunrise to sunset. Occasionally he'd wake up at night and play poker. He'd go back to bed. Wake up early in the morning, put on his uniform and boots, ready to work with a huge smile on his face. We thought it fitting to name the camp after him, since he had given his heart and soul to building it. You've held back a little on this subject, but I'd like to talk about Rob and also about this day. CAPTAIN JASON DOA 072 Yeah, it's not an easy subject to talk about, but if you've got any unanswered questions you'd like to know about, I'd be happy to talk about it.
I love you, son. I love you, son. Crap. AMEX just called to confirm a 48,000 s purchase. What the hell? We needed equipment and new bikes.
Ponchy, she's old! It's pathological. She's old. What was her body like? It was firm.
It's pathological. She's old. How was her body? It was firm. - Was it firm?
Home run! Home run! Give me five. Oh, my God, you did it! Don't ruin that top. It needs to be hand-washed. Tell Bonnie.
On the other hand, puppets having sex is vulgar. You'll have to prove legally that there's no artistic merit. I'm not talking about the legal side. You'll still have to... Canceling a show just because you don't like it, two weeks before opening night, I'm afraid...
That's it! The bird. In the car, that's the bird I saw. What did you see? It's not normally there.
A girl. I don't know, a... A burning body. I'm so sorry. What's wrong? What's wrong?
My clothes are sterilized. I have 100 white T-shirts. That's my standard outfit. The airlock is a sealed room at the entrance. It's hermetically sealed, so nothing can filter in from the outside.
Maddy, can you hear me? Can you leave us alone? Madeline. My heart stopped. Then it started beating again.
I love you too. What premonition? I don't know. The weather... It's like the air is constipated. If we had a nice storm, we'd be all right.
He's not important! He's nothing. He's nobody... but he's the one he wanted. When we robbed the casino, Voyageur screwed up my perfect plan? It wasn't perfect.
No, that's all right. I just didn't understand. I assure you, I've done nothing wrong. Let me explain. I lifted your phone to wipe down the desk, and it accidentally disconnected.
All right. Okay. Shit, man. Are you ready? I'm looking for my camera. It's right over here.
Kyle with nine toes? He has ten, Jake! Only two of them are webbed. Uh, you didn't get a, uh, callback for the movie, did you? These losers couldn't recognize talent even if it was right in front of their eyes.
Where do these waves go? There's another level of existence somewhere. There's no doubt about it. But you can't say exactly what it is. When you see a train leaving a station... do you have to know where it's going to understand that you've seen it leave?
You're not the type to pray. Not believing in God doesn't mean you can't pray. What kind of atheist talks to God? Why did you give me a false name? It wasn't false.
"You are who you are and I am who I am, and no matter what comes out, we're beautiful." My son told me that. When trouble melts like lemon drops I'm not saying I want out of porn. I love porn for what it is, and how it can develop. DANNY D ACTOR
Maybe you think you deserve everything you get... I AM Z 1 ... and more. Maybe you're used to the screams of the crowd. Clay. What are you doing here? There's a basketball game on.
Hannah! Mom, he's not a customer. Oh, I see. I'll get my coat. It's in the back, so...
You hardly knew him. No. You don't understand. Yes, I do. You make every drama your own, or it doesn't count.
There's beer everywhere. It wasn't Jeff's fault. The stop sign on the corner had been hit in the night. The cops thought it was Jeff's fault, I guess. But he was already on the ground.
And the beer's cold. - Let's go. - Shall we? Let's start with the part of the evening I skipped. You can have a superpower, but it comes with a price.
No. No, I'm not. - Yes. - No, sir. Yes, your tone... it's aggressive and alarming.
Yes, we get it! Yeah, we do! Thanks, Rick. I'll try to remember to turn off the brain-scanner. Actually, I think it turns itself off when your brain's liquid.
You wish it was just sex! We loved each other! - We had a child together! - What? I conceived a child with Million Ants. I conceived a child with Million Ants and he died inside me Because he was half Million Ants and half falling stars!
No, Mum! I have to go, I'm the boss. Do as I say, lock the door. If you see anyone, just press the horn, okay? If anyone approaches you, use the anti-aggression spray, like I taught you. It's in the glove compartment.
That's what we're doing here. The chef's not too bad. The cook's better. Bread, Madeline? Yes, it's delicious.
I can't take any more of this bullshit. It wasn't an accident. Why wasn't it? Their language. It's identical.
Very naughty. Take a look at this. The master's whip shows no mercy tonight. That whip's been controlling that monkey for 500 years. It has to be.
This can't go on, I have to get the headband back. What are you doing? - Give me the headband back. - Leave it alone. It doesn't suit you. You look terrible.
Like you said, it was an accident. Besides, we're leaving here today. I gave the cops a fake ID. The apartment was rented under a false name. If anyone tries to follow us, they won't find anything.
You can't give me what's mine in the first place. Oh, well. No, it's... You take it. - It's yours.
Agent Dollard, IRS. Your letter was addressed to me personally. With a message. I never sent anything to... Your name's on the card.
Agent Burgle. Gloria. You can trust me. The future is certain. When it comes, you'll know for sure where you belong.
So say your goodbyes and kiss your moms goodbye. It's going to be a long trip. Don't worry, Hilly. Your legacy will always be there when we come back. Of course it will, Travis.
Really? Yeah. You fucked up coming here. Fuck you! I found your drawing. It's so beautiful.
You cover the Israelis like no one else. Technical glitch. And? There's... a travelling Russian funfair with a squirrel running in a wire wheel. The squirrel thinks he's turning the wheel, but if he stops running, he gets his feet caught in the wire mesh and breaks his legs.
I just can't believe it. But it's true. I watch the damage on TV. How could they have known? Apparently, there's a security camera recording they haven't released yet of the truck, just before it exploded.
I didn't know what was going to happen. I mean, the explosion, I still can't believe it. Because the recording cleared it up, it's important evidence for the bombing investigation. I told the FBI I wouldn't say where it came from and I won't, but... - It wasn't mine.
I told the FBI I wouldn't say where it came from and I won't, but.... - It wasn't mine. - Well, that's fine. But... The problem is they know it came from the NSA.
He has the proof in his phone. This financier is Mossad. This is a farce! The masquerade was the agreement. He didn't stand a chance.
Are you accusing these men of lying? Yes, I am. They were either mistaken or encouraged. What about the recording? Is he lying?
That's just it. Either they got it wrong, or they were encouraged. What about the recording? Does it lie? Why does it end there, with an image of my son running away?
Welcome back. Your heart is calm. I beg your pardon? Your pulse. It's very stable.
One of them can eradicate cancer, provided the other one dies. You don't have to kill it, just nod your head and let it happen. Are you nodding? If so, how will the baby be killed? Will it suffer or not?
We've lost our way. We need to focus on Kevin. Where's my book? I threw it overboard. It was just getting interesting.
- This is nothing. I killed his hamster. You what? When you went to your Model UN. I didn't feed it. I went upstairs before you got back, and it was dead.
And you changed your mind. I didn't change my mind. I went through with it. I was in a parking lot, naked, curled up like a baby. The same parking lot as before, but without trucks. There was nobody there, nothing.
I assure you we don't have time for this. Behind this wall... Damn it, Bates! ...there's a staircase. It leads to a maintenance room and a door at the back of the building.
Crap. Is something wrong? This isn't easy. I have to make the virus undetectable. If Jadalla and his men discover it before he's finished erasing the disk, we've failed.
Shut up, you two. You, now fix the USB key. Retrieve the data. I need my computer. It contains the data recovery program.
There's only one way out, and we both know what it is. Your people will lose. You don't understand, Jadalla. This country is so much stronger than your jihad. And it will still stand firm long after false prophets and madmen like you have passed on.
Cheers. - Cheers! Cheers! I hope you enjoy it. - This tea would be at home in a café in Karachi, Ellen. It reminds me of home.
The flagship is approaching. It has emitted a signal. Governor Rogers' signal. We must not fire. His signal? Could they have imitated it? It's too recent.
Icelandic labels on medicines. The sound of the sea. The seagulls sound as if they're speaking Icelandic. The pot of skyr? We know which farm it comes from:
But, no, I know that... I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm just fooling myself. I can go. Dani... If we can all fit in the tub... it's a sign that it's for us.
We should get out of here. The devil! It's the devil! ...toilet paper stuck to your shoes. We remove it with the other foot, it sticks to the other and we can't get rid of it.
I think I just caught the sensory equivalent of an STD. - Let them play. - Hey, Mr. Gorilla, where's the ball? Where's the ball? Oh, it's in the goal!
For Teagan and Tom, the quest is over. Marriage is a sacred union. It's a rite that unites two individuals and forms a family. Weddings always make me cry. - It binds two hearts and souls together.
"good night air" "good night air" Wait. Calvin needs oxygen to survive. With the little oxygen he has left, he'll target the oxygen candles.
And if I hold it long enough, it will prevent entry into the atmosphere. - You'll be flying into deep space. - With... with Calvin, yes. In the meantime, you get in the B-boat and push the button. If there are no problems, you'll be on your way home.
A world of the blind! By leaving Amit's handkerchief on Wasim's body, you've tried to lead us astray. But it won't be so easy. I've learned that Amit... - He's going to burn, sir.
I can't work alone anymore. I need the money, Norman. I understand that. Does this freezer work? It's working much better.
I understand. Does it work, this freezer? It works much better. Thanks for fixing it. It does work.
Have a nice shower. Wha... Wha... What happened? I was trying to use the razor, but it's more complicated than it looks. It's old.
What... Wha... What happened? I was trying to use the razor, but it's more complicated than it looks. It's old. It's from my ex-boyfriend.
It's my writing. "It's true, H.G., don't be silly. "Believe it. I wrote that, but... This symbol, what does it mean?
- No, it's my heart... Do you need any medicine? I don't need any medicine! Then, what is it? Is it there?
Come on, read it out loud. An outpouring of love, like wings spreading. Love makes its entrance, like a conquering phoenix. Though it has unsettled me, I want it to stay... it's my only wish. I feed him sweetness and affection, hoping he'll whisper my name.
An outpouring of love, like wings spreading. Love makes its entrance, like a conquering phoenix. Though it has unsettled me, I want it to stay... it's my only wish. I feed him sweetness and affection, hoping he'll whisper my name. He will, I'm convinced.
Although he's upset me, I want him to stay... that's my only wish. I nurture him with gentleness and affection, hoping he'll whisper my name. He will, I'm convinced. They say he is skinned alive by the thorns of life, his blood a harbinger of eternal spring. They say he'll build you a nest of thorns, and lull you to the rhythm of painful nursery rhymes.
I'm convinced he will. He's said to be skinned alive by the thorns of life, his blood a harbinger of eternal spring. They say he'll build you a nest of thorns, and lull you to the rhythm of painful nursery rhymes. And when time stops flying but seems frozen, and your battered soul finally passes away... It will take flight again, sing another melody, and lure another heart into its cursed net.
Each of my breaths is a prayer for you, O beloved. Each of my breaths is a prayer for you, O beloved. My heart has cut itself off from the world. My heart has cut itself off from the world. It has renounced everything but you.
Allow me and I'll drown in it. Each of my breaths is a prayer for you, O beloved. My heart has cut itself off from the world. My heart has cut itself off from the world. It has renounced everything but you.
Love makes its entrance, like a conquering phoenix. Even though he's unnerved me, I want him to stay... that's my only wish. I feed him sweetness and affection, hoping he'll whisper my name.
No matter. Let's get started, shall we? Evan, open one of the barrels. Be careful. This place is just like they said it would be on the news.
We have a lawyer here. Who represents Goodlife Chimicals. All these precautions... Hazmat suits, decontamination foam, imply that these chemicals are dangerous. Nonsense. Sulfuric acid is not only dangerous, it's extremely corrosive.
Who represents Goodlife Chimicals. All these precautions... Hazmat suits, decontamination foam, imply that these chemicals are dangerous. Nonsense. Sulfuric acid is not only dangerous, it's extremely corrosive. It will eat your flesh in a second.
Yellow? Yellow? Yeah. No, uh, blackie. Uh, well, black isn't a color. It absorbs all the colors of the spectrum...
- Of course I will. - I'll support you. - Whatever you decide. - It's not your problem. Aria, you're going to plan this wedding, and he'll be there waiting for her while he says his goodbyes to Nicole.
It's the Sugar Plum Fairy meets the Greateful Dead. That's what Claudia said, and she was right. Hi, guys. Can I just say one more thing? If you believed in your talent as much as I do, you'd see this moment for what it is.
This dark area is shaped like Rosewood and these three lines are the three roads leading out of town, this one curves like Route 37 and this long incline leads to the highway. - Why are we being given a map? - I mean, seriously. It's not like this game wants to help us escape. No, but maybe it wants us to find something.
I can't do it. - It's broken. The game has to be broken. It's not broken. He knows exactly what he's doing.
And there's a phone? Hanna, phones have cameras. They can see and hear. I know they can. So far it only tells us who has to play.
Is Sydney A.D. or just another pawn? Do you think Jenna orchestrated this so A.D. could shoot Spencer? Sydney's phone is nearby. - She got a message. - What did it say?
Well, you see... Does this blood freak you out as much as it does me? Yes. Just let me... Scofield said he'd deliver me.
I'm glad to have seen them on stage. That's what we used to say. In their early days. We'd say we loved them before anyone else. I wanted to add you as a friend the other day, but I couldn't find your profile, is it private?
- Do you have children? - No, I don't. What are your traumas? The short version? My job. It takes up all my time and that's fine with me.
But, going to the page of a major diabetes organization, The American Diabetes Association, it wasn't just that the information wasn't on the front page, they were reprinting recipes for industrial red meat. And in their healthy living recipes, they had shrimp-bacon wraps. Bacon shrimp rolls Oh, boy! I'll e-mail the American Diabetes Association and see if they get back to us. As destructive as it is, diabetes pales in comparison to heart disease.
My nephew down the street has cancer. It's terminal, stage four. He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink. And it's not in his lungs, it's in his lymph nodes. Now, living here and seeing what they do, you don't eat pork. I don't eat bacon, because I know where it comes from.
There's nothing healthy about eating this way. But it's not just waste, it's also purulent infections. You may see a lump, or some kind of abscess under the skin. Most of the time, when the skin is removed, either the abscess will open up and pus will come out, or it's deep, when inspectors or employees are doing their job, they might stick their knives into an abscess and it will explode everywhere.
You want to find these people? The university. They have enormous resources. Their computer department. The phone's dead. It'll stay in the store.
Her work, her sport, are more important than me. Even her Monday blow-dry. She makes time for that. I've been to this salon. It's no good.
Everything all right, Officer? Crap. I forgot I was holding that. I'm so sorry. I use it so much, it's like it's part of me.
Go ahead. Look at those floors. But I... What did I say about cleaning? If this place is going to go to shit, it's going to go to shit clean!
Naomi? We just saw him behind the container near a bulkhead on the lower deck, at the stern. There are no cameras on this axis. Keep to your left. He's got to be around here.
We just saw him behind the container near a bulkhead on the lower deck, at the stern. There are no cameras on this axis. Keep to your left. He's got to be around here. We'd have seen him if he'd moved.
He digs into the partition. Why is he doing that? Crap. The protomolecule feeds on radiation. This thing wants to get to the reactor. If it punctures the chamber...
Adjust orientation. Is this your first dive into sulfuric acid clouds? There was this one time, back in college. The Martian ship... it's on an intercept course!
We've just spotted a massive electromagnetic spike. I think the crater's moving. Sir, the Martian ship is gone. What do you mean "gone"? It just disappeared off our screens.
I was explaining to Jefferson that you could help us with... the research project. Like Indiana Jones. Well, sort of. You took him to a cafe? I see he's emitting a low level of ionic radiation.
Because I let Black Siren get away, one of those guards could have been killed. We almost had Prometheus. Your plan worked. He was there. No. If it had worked, we'd be cuffing him right now.
The valley. Look at that. We're grateful. You could use the Chief's office. It's nicer than mine.
My son honored that commitment. He made the ultimate sacrifice. And I honor his memory by wearing this uniform. Just as you honor the memory of every officer who gave his life in the line of duty. Wear it with pride. Respect what it represents.
- What? - The man in the tea bar didn't look like he owed you a favor. He was terrified. Felicity, what's really going on? The NSA file that exonerated John, it was part of a cache of information a group of hackers gave me, and that cache included information I used to pressure the Detralink employee.
Felicity, what's really going on? The NSA file that exonerated John, it was part of a cache of information a group of hackers gave me, and that cache included information I used to pressure the Detralink employee. You mean, you blackmailed him. - Well... - For the cache of data to have exactly what you needed for this particular man, it must be huge.
- Rude - Rude. Yeah. It's become reckless to talk politics. I can't help but wonder if maybe that's why our country is the way it is now.
Let's get to work finding them. - We've got to go. - Yes, we do. So, you ready for your big moment? Oh, it's just a commencement ceremony.
I'd do anything for a friend. Anything for a friend. We're looking for Tobias Church's emergency account. Amertek money? If I tell you where it is, will you let me go?
We're looking for Tobias Church's emergency account. Amertek money? If I tell you where it is, will you let me go? No. You'll show us where it is.
It was Prometheus. I shot the arrows. Listen, earlier Thea was talking to me about not taking credit for other people's sins. What happened with Malone was Prometheus's fault, not yours. Well, Quentin, that advice would have made a little more sense if it hadn't come from Thea.
The district attorney came to see me, and... Are you referring to Adrian Chase? Yes, I am. He ordered me to change the report to indicate that the Shuriken Killer was responsible. You signed that report, even though you knew it was wrong, and gave it to the police.
- Thea. - What? Half the precinct is corrupt, so it's not hard to believe, and he's no longer with us, so it wouldn't really bother him. This way, the cover-up isn't about Green Arrow anymore. It's about protecting Malone's reputation for the sake of his family.
As you wish. This computer shows that 80 million roubles are being transferred from Kovar's account to the account Gregor controls. Yes. We know. To be divided between the Bratva captains. It also shows that 40 million roubles were transferred to Kovar, which Gregor never mentioned.
Chase had anticipated our actions. I never said he wasn't smart. But I am too. What's your toy doing? It's detecting resonant frequencies upstairs.
It worked, by the way. I know what Kovar is up to. But at what cost? You're a fool to think a piece of cloth can separate a man from a monster. Splitting you in two will only make the monster stronger until it's stronger than you.
We're finally making progress. Fess up. Oliver, we've been betrayed. Viktor, he... I'm very proud of this casino and what it means to our country.
I told you it's more complicated when you're on the other side of the... What's more complicated? You're holding someone without a lawyer, without a trial, without justice. And the world is safer. It could be safer...
What's more complicated? You're holding someone without a lawyer, without a trial, without justice. And the world is safer. It could be safer... But it's not better.
- What's weird about it? No electricity. In the whole building. What are the odds Oliver didn't pay for the electricity? Infinitesimal considering I modified the building to be off-grid and...
Careful. - Yeah. - Hold on, hold on, hold on. - Wait for what? My math is probably right, but what if it's not?
- How could Chase spread it? It's in aerosol form, so more or less any way he wants. We need to find out where Chase has stored this stuff and stop him before he releases it. Cyclotrizane degrades rather quickly. Which means it releases traceable emissions.
I'm so sorry, Daddy. What do we know? You mean besides the fact that it looks like the horror version of Groundhog Day? The security camera footage is grainy, but it's enough to see Black Siren doing her best Laurel impersonation. If we know there was a second attacker who should we be thinking of?
Oliver, no! Your bloodlust... Your barbarity. This gun. It only has one bullet.
I never took her seriously. Until now, right? Yes. I've got this bad feeling. Right in the middle of my stomach. What's it telling you?
We make the rounds to find Nick. We shouldn't have left Nick. He left us no choice. This fight isn't over. It is for Nick.
We shouldn't have left Nick. He left us no choice. This fight isn't over. It is for Nick. It would have been for us if we'd stayed.
Nick? He's not out there. Maybe they're still in the tunnel dumping the bodies. We're losing her, Nick. I hope this thing is doing what we think it's doing.
A surveillance team was left at each location. - And his vehicle? - It hasn't been located. - And his phone? - It's no longer operational.
We blew up the ship. But it's still active on Eros. - Were you there too? - Yes. He's learning, you know.
It won't be. This is our temple. You are welcome here. We can offer you salvation. Sounds like just what I need.
What the... Drone unresponsive. Target lock on ship. Done. Mustn't leave.
You have entered Eros. We found your colleague dead in the airlock. I forbade Dr. Kane to touch it, but he never listens. He wanted a sample, but it attacked him. Almost as if he felt threatened.
The accursed asteroid moves thanks to its own energy. That's not really possible. But it does. Moves where? I don't know. But it's heading for the sun.
- Do we know why? - No, we haven't. Was the Mormon ship on its way to Eros before the incident? Johnson said it was an engine test. But given the Nauvoo's speed and trajectory, it was headed for a collision with Eros.
- Come on, cowboys. - And cowgirls. I'm sending the juice. Call from Rocinante, 13 minutes transmission delay. Vessel approaches 15-G to match target speed. It will lock onto Eros to guide the missiles.
I believe that Eros was infected by a new type of technology, something from elsewhere, somewhere beyond the reach of our species. I believe the Eros incident was our 1st extraterrestrial contact. I have a file with 900 pages of analysis, and plans for war with Mars, including 14 different scenarios that suggest what to do, if they develop unpredictable technology. My instructions file if an advanced alien species comes along for the ride? It's three pages long, and starts with, "First, find God."
Cancel their contracts. Paralyze their business. And I have the power to do it, because I'm a fucking heroine who helped save Mother Earth from the cataclysm that Jules-Pierre Mao unleashed. Tell his kids that the government is more powerful than any corporation. And the only reason they think it's any different is because we poor public servants are always looking for a nice big private-sector reward down the road.
- I love you too. - What premonition? - I don't know. The weather... It's like the air is constipated. If we had a nice storm, we'd be all right.
They have an unshakeable faith... in America. Their America. There are more than two Americas. Lady Liberty has a different face for each. Even if it crumbles easily.
They should. You could sacrifice yourself. You already have. And the world opened up to me. Since then, it's closed.
That was between you and your uncle. It had nothing to do with us. When the time comes, we'll call on you. And Franck's body? It's still there.
- yeah. Well, I was just wondering if you'd ever written about time travel? But more specifically, future travel. Oh, no, my best seller... oh hey "The future ain't what it used to be"... That was... That was the story...
I can't tell you how many times I've been in your shoes and a man with your face has made me feel better. Speaking of which, I'd like... I'd love it if you could share some of my double's knowledge. I'd like to know what my smarter version would think. The first Wells told me that the time will come for me to be a hero, that it was my job to show, to be ready when needed.
What's this? It's Joe's alarm. He's got to be on that train. There's no way to stop the train... It won't stop in time.
- What's going on? We're going to move the train. How are we going to do that? I'll vibrate it. I'll vibrate it enough to get it through this. - Can you do that?
We sent Grodd there when he came after Fay Wray. Grodd's there? Why on Earth, any Earth, would your father want to go there? We received a mathematical cryptogram at our S.T.A.R. Labs. It was extremely complex.
Because I see everything, and I saw two people... with two broken hearts. So the lesson was... Love, Supergirl. Love is... letting yourself be saved. It's not just about saving other people.
You say you created Savitar. - How? - Take a look at this. In 4 years' time, the future Flash will create... a memory remnant to fight Savitar. But Savitar let this remnant live so he could become Savitar.
No beginning, no end. It's an eternal cycle. The classic chicken-and-egg scenario. A memory vestige is like a double of you, isn't it? It shares your emotions, your memories.
For the first time, I was able to say no to him. Because of this. If you haven't already given him that bell, I need it. It's part of a weapon that can kill mermaids.
What did that woman do to you? After I flipped my switch, Sybil tinkered in my head. I don't know what it was, But she did something to guarantee That all my feelings for Elena were gone. Damon, I gave you this necklace Because it's as powerful and as magical As the love you and Elena have for each other.
It's all right. She knows exactly what to do. And the girls are sleeping like logs. I'm a little embarrassed that I suggested the problem was ours, - when it was right in front of our eyes.
Maybe when I'm dead I'll be as wise as you, but that's not what I think of him. Then believe Caroline. Believe in how she feels. Share her happiness. It won't stop ours.
And why is that? Because I'm a responsible Devil. And I... I know that kiss meant a lot... to the inspector. To her? It must have had some impact on her.
But she's shaken up, she's saying weird things. Like what? That they were attacked by a wolf. An invisible wolf. She said it came out of nowhere, and that she's next.
It's impossible from here. You know the difficulties of the print media. Our presence in Broadchurch is no longer tenable. We're closing the local office. The paper will continue, but it will cover a wider area by combining our resources.
Are you all right? Murder I can understand. Sex crimes... We'll be issuing a statement today about the assault. It'll be brief, no details.
The police came by. They know about us. Hi, Daddy. - I want to borrow the old computer. - It's Mom's.
You're not a little girl anymore. Face the world. Take charge of your life. The future isn't written. It belongs to you.
- He was upset. He hadn't got laid. You know how they are. Jim Atwood was walking around, sexually frustrated, a pack of condoms in his pocket, at the time Trish was raped. He was the only suspect whose DNA was found on Trish, even though it dated from their morning romp.
I was working and came across this bag. Did you touch it? When I found it, yes. I thought a customer had forgotten it. It didn't make sense that it was there.
And that's how it ended Last scenario. A truck is coming your way. But it has no brakes. If it goes right, it crushes five innocent people.
Last scenario. A truck is coming towards you. But it has no brakes. If it goes right, it crushes five innocent people. If it goes left, it crushes a businessman.
I'm lost. That's my girl! Come on, let's go! What is this place? Does it appear one day every 100 years?
A corpse... belonging to... Dean Adams, 47, real estate developer. Is this his place? No. It belongs to Sam Browning.
She slit his throat! I was there! I saw it! Why did you see her? Because she wanted the building, of course. It's yours, not his.
You know, we're so busy, no one really looks at what anyone else is doing. Right? I guess so. Then he realizes he can't hide Lily-Anne's hair because it's already been spotted. So he waits until it gets here, in the sealing room, shows up and steals it.
So it's true? Everything you told me about the bracelet is true. How does it work? It doesn't. It's 2,000 years old.
Tell them I'm operating and I don't want them. Actually, you know what? Why don't you share it with the other nurses? You sure about this? It's chic.
Can you see the anomaly? I'll have to check with Dr Hamza to confirm. You have neurocysticercosis. A parasitic worm has crept into your brain. It's relatively safe as long as it stays alive, but if it dies, it can become serious, so we need to act very quickly.
- Soon. There are hints here and there that Billy's death might not have been accidental. People talk too much. Talking to the D.A.? You know, sometimes when I sleep... I see what hell looks like... and there are no flames or devils.
You're out of here. Dad, I'll leave right now. Where is it? I don't want dirty money in my house. It's not dirty.
There's only room for one star. Isn't that the truth? The men built the pedestal, not me. There's only room for one goddess at a time. They may have built the pedestal, but it's the women who keep tearing it down until it collapses.
A horror film? Hitchcock just did it with Psycho. And it makes him even richer. But even better here, Baby Jane requires only one set. All you need is a small cast.
You never talk about your family. Where you come from. Maybe that's why Father... It wasn't long before she made her comeback. A role Bette would never have turned down had she realized it was Oscar-worthy.
Hedda, we've already told you, we're as thick as thieves. It's the crappiest thing I've seen since the last time I had diarrhea. What year was that? 1932. You know the good thing about scotch, Bob, it gets better with age.
All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Lunch is served! Swim, baby. Catch it before it gets soggy.
Lucky you. Look, we don't have to be best friends. Just allies. We all want the same thing, for this film to be a success. I'm sure it will be, thanks to you.
We don't have enough toilet paper for that. Let's get to the questions. Yes, I've got one. Why can a rich guy buy justice? Is crime only a problem when it affects you?
Here are your new vehicles. Each one is connected to the APB application that Gideon showed you earlier. You can be seen from the control center at all times. Now the chassis is armored with a heavy-duty alloy from Reeves Industrie. It can handle anything under 50 caliber.
How is your search supposed to go if I have to do patrols? I spoke to the captain. He's in charge of your department. You handle this until we catch Sully's killer or I'm ruined. Honestly, I looked over Sully's file, and there's not much there.
Hello, Mr. Aldrich. And this is his playmate, Jerome. That's Jeremy. He's got an accent. What's up, B.D.?
Livvies! Oh, my dear! Do you feel responsible for the end of Joan Crawford's career? Time has done its work. And it's doing it for all of us.
Dumont, if I don't have the card, we won't have Anna, we won't have her son. - The fire system. - The what? It's a hypoxic system. It literally sucks the oxygen out of the room to starve the fire... Fire needs oxygen.
It's a hypoxic system, literally sucking the oxygen out of the room and depriving the fire of it... Fire that needs oxygen. Yes, I know that, Dumont. How is this good for us? If I can fool the system without activating the alarm, it will evacuate the air from the room, depriving the fire of oxygen, like those inside the room who will lose consciousness and fall like in the scarf game.
I hope the justice system will get to the bottom of this. But since I don't intend to let the justice system establish the truth about me, this is where I get off. The only surviving member of the Pequod. It's the whaler in "Moby-Dick". Oh, it sank.
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. My answer is no. In general, we prefer to ask the question first. You showed me the NTSB report. It says that the landing gear on Howard's plane was sabotaged.
And in three, she'll cling to another girl and destroy her. Good morning, students. I'm your principal. I've been asked about the support rally. Let me be very clear: it will take place as planned.
It's a compliment. I couldn't be seen with them. Not after the way they've been going at it. You didn't know? You've been playing the same game since junior high. And it was worn out by then.
It probably fell when it was attacked, and we don't know where it was. Find my phone. It's an app on the computer that tells you where your phone is. Do we still have Danny's computer? It should be around here.
- Yes, a handsome guy. Are you sure? It was dark. It was under the streetlamp. It's so bright, it lights me up at night.
You'd better go. Can we rehearse one last time? Alice has enough to manipulate the digital inventory, override the CCTV and start production. Benny's fake wedge will replace the real one, which we've altered and left in place. As the fake corner isn't strong enough, it's bound to break.
I was working on something. You were? What are you working on? I'm working on a mystery novel. In the right hands, when it's finished, it'll make a great little movie.
We want Joy! We want Joy! It gives me great pleasure to introduce you to a true woman of faith, with unshakeable convictions. Ladies and gentlemen, my friends, please welcome Mrs. Joy Pettybon! Last Wednesday, we saw the most despicable program I've ever seen.
The war against my sister has already begun. Should we cease hostilities and join your fight against what you've seen? You don't think so. I understand, it sounds like nonsense. But if fate brought Daenerys Targaryen to our shores, it also made Jon Snow King in the North.
She put. I hope he comes back soon. He was happy to see me. When you come, his heart will stop. He doesn't look like her.
Two paramedics and the guy in the back. - To the elevator! - Get over here! Come on, quickly. It's out of order!
Twice. We were talking about Peter Jennings' untimely death. So sad. And we started fucking, right there on the bar, where your arm is. I need a nutmeg grater.
Luke, you didn't know anyone involved in this fire, did you? Fire? Yes, off campus. A horror. I think there was a party that got out of hand.
But have you heard him sing? A real saucepan. Even the most basic dance steps... Watching him dance, it was... You know when a foal is born and tries to stand up?
The energy starts to... Can I take the money? If I can't work it out with my mom or... Oh, please, please. There's only 30 euros.
What are you waiting for? A unicorn mask to go out in the street. Do you like it? I'll help you put it on. It's beautiful.
I'll help you put it on. It's gorgeous. It cost me a fortune. Hold still, I'm taking a picture. It looks great on you.
- So what was it? - Fear. The whole system has been a powder keg since Eros. No one can explain it. Mars thinks it's our weapon.
We've formed a line. - I'm sorry, sir. - Oh, Sergeant. That's when I saw the drone. It was waiting.
Pregnant and running around. No. Never seen her. I realize that... you don't know how far we can go to bring back all the clones. You better embrace this new future, because it's going to be here very soon.
This is the key, okay? Come on, let's go! Let's go ! I've hidden your treatment in the back of a fridge. It's ready, there's enough for you and Charlotte.
And if I can keep my cool with Chief Davis, I expect you all to do the same. - Amy. - I'm going to investigate the C-4. You're right, Captain. The less this crime looks like an act of terrorism, the more it seems connected to Albert Luna.
♪ All I had was ♪ ♪ Talent to entertain ♪ ♪ If love was necessary ♪ Wait, the cottage was there, wasn't it? It's not invisible, it's just... not there.
The Last Hopeful Options. Yes, of course. Elves love riddles and riddles. Especially those that make humans look ridiculous. She gave me the title of the book we're looking for, but I'm afraid it's really hard to find.
Many times. Henry, is that juniper still there? You know, the one in the infirmary. - Ah, yes, it is. - Ah, it has the sweetest grass.
You can't look at your hands for 12 hours. Okay, what's that? I can't even pronounce the name. It's from China. It will keep the blood circulating, but take away a lot of discomfort.
I'd like to point out once again how a good night's sleep can solve a myriad of emotional problems. We think our feelings are real, but they're not. Take it from me. It's like the sky that's blue. But when it's cloudy, it's gray.
We think our feelings are real, but they're not. Take it from me. It's like the sky that's blue. But when it's cloudy, it's gray. But it's still blue.
Take it from me. It's like the sky that's blue. But when it's cloudy, it's gray. But it's still blue. It hasn't changed.
Alex? - Allergic? - Yes. That's why their chef makes this dry bread. It's gluten-free.
And I'm telling you... you've signed your death warrant... and mine... and that of everyone in this camp. The raps don't care who wears the uniform here. When something like this happens, we all go. Unless, of course, it never happened. If there's no evidence that your scheming friend's explosive originated here, nothing happened.
The raps don't care who wears the uniform here. When something like this happens, we're all in. Unless, of course, it never happened. If there's no evidence that your scheming friend's explosive originated here, nothing happened. And if nothing happened, then maybe we'll all live to see another day.
I've heard of you. In that case, you know I can make you answer me. And that knife in your hand won't stop me from asking. No. But it will stop me from answering.
Yes, it's because I've been so nice up to now. Don't you want to get rid of that fake vomit? It always makes me happy. This pencil sharpener in the shape of a nose? Is that what it is?
Whoa, watch out. Hey, where's our sailboat? Oh. It really harmonized the room.
No! Because his face is asymmetrical. Take a look! Look into the puddle. Your face is lopsided, because it's right.
- Something asymmetrical. - My badge! Your friend saw it right away because of her eye. But... it moves like a reflection. It doesn't reflect you.
- My badge! Your friend saw it right away because of her eye. But... it moves like a reflection. It doesn't reflect you. It imitates you.
I'm on the run. I need a place to hide. They know Bud. They put a BOLO on his truck. He's outside his store.
A lot is. Nick, I'm going to need you to give me that rag. I want to take it to Rosalee. Why do you want to do that? After everything that's happened to us, we need to know what it is and where it came from.
Why should we? After everything that's happened to us, we need to know what it is and where it comes from. The answer might be on the fabric. I'm not so sure about that. We need to know where its power comes from before it kills one of us.
But we don't know where this power comes from. - I don't think it matters. - It matters. Look what happened when those guys Tried to take the stick away from you. He acted defensively, as he connected with you.
- I don't think it matters. - It matters. Look what happened when those guys tried to take the stick away from you. He acted defensively, like he was connected to you. It's different from what he did to Monroe Or me or you when you got shot.
What are you up to? I'm just trying to help Rosalee and Eve see something. See something where? On this old piece of cloth. It has some writing on it, and we're having trouble seeing it.
Previously on "Grimm"... I don't think you should carry the stick all the time. Look what happened when those guys tried to Take the stick away from you... he acted defensively.
Well, I don't know if the rag was with the stick when they found it, but none of it was visible with spectral imaging. How could Diana see it? Remember what your mother told us about Diana? This child has an extraordinary destiny. In the wrong hands, he could do great harm, But in the right hands, he could do great good.
Just try to get with the program. Now! Do it now! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - It's almost ready.
Well, maybe we... Let's do it again, shall we? We've just done the charm on Nick As we're doing it for the first time, Except we're going to turn the captain into Nick. It's a great idea... so all we need is some of Nick's hair. It won't work. We'd be doing a spell on a spell, And there's still no guarantee it wouldn't kill Nick.
An Alpe can smell it. It's like a junkie - with his drugs. - Why does an Alpe keep attacking the same victim? Because when the body overcompensates, the brain produces even more melatonin when it's not sleeping.
Just for one night? Yes, just passing through. Name, previous address if you have one, payment at 11 o'clock. 305. We have an elevator, but it's broken.
Dinner is at 8pm in the dining room. - We'll meet at the bar. - You're on. Let me call the elevator for you, sir. It's a bit old.
She didn't want to stop. The only odd thing... was the mirror. What mirror? The little mirror we used when you turned into a fox. It was next to her, covered in blood.
The only odd thing... was the mirror. What mirror? The little mirror we used when you turned into a fox. It was next to her, covered in blood. She must have fallen on it, but I don't know why it was on the floor...
Aren't you going to arrest me? Not while you're helping us. How long have you had that mirror? Since always. It was my mother's.
It was my mother's. I remember my dad taking it to the store for me to play with while my mom was in the hospital. It was during my princess period, so I needed a mirror. I think it's been there ever since. It obviously has nothing to do with any strange behavior.
And then the face. The same one you and I saw? Yes, so I smashed the mirror. Just as I was about to clean it up, all the pieces started coming together. And then... he grabbed me.
What was that? "In the morning, relieved, I see my enemy lying under the tree." So you felt the arm go through the mirror in the spice store? First I saw it, then I felt it. It smothered her.
I shot her, but it didn't do anything to her. And then... and then I ran, because you I thought - she was after me. - Where's Dev's body? It was right here.
- Are you sure you want to do this? - Not completely. Where is it? I broke that mirror. It shattered into a thousand pieces, then all the pieces came back together.
Where is it? Where is it? I broke that mirror. It shattered into a thousand pieces, then all the pieces came back together. It's not a magic mirror. It belonged to my mother.
See if you can find out what the other three were doing there. We'll question Ralph again. Maybe he forgot to mention the spaceship. It had the shape of a man. He killed my friend.
Oh my goodness. This gives a whole new meaning to "family tree." I know that kind of tree. I didn't think of it sooner because it's not Wesen or a monster, per se. It's just a tree, except it feeds on human blood.
For a tree that feeds on human blood, it looks pretty harmless. Come closer. Sweet Jesus. It gives you a real sense of communion with nature. You know he's got this thing called pareidolia that makes the brain think it sees faces in inanimate objects, and that can happen because of sleep deprivation.
I need to understand how these mirrors work. You mean what you saw in them? More like how to get through them. I don't think that's a very good idea. That skull tried to grab me and pull me into the place where it is.
And it almost killed you. I think it's gonna kill me if I don't do something. So maybe you should stay away from it. Nick saw it too. What if he goes after him?
Why not? It's worth a try. What's this? It's something Nick and Monroe found in the Black Forest. It's something special.
Let's think about it. What if you don't find her? Or what if you find her and you can't come back? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! The stick can't cross. It just can't.
Or what if you find her and you can't come back? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! The stick can't cross. It can't. It doesn't belong there.
So Renard knows about the symbol? Apparently, Diana drew them when she was with him. What else does he know? He knows about the tunnel. He just doesn't know where it is.
They buried a stick? Always the same reaction. But it's more than that. It's not just a stick. For one thing, it can heal.
But he wasn't. No, he wasn't. You're telling me the... the stick saved Nick? It saved me too.
A poisoned cat, locked in a box, with a 50% chance of survival or death. Exactly. But when the box is closed, two dimensions exist simultaneously. One where the cat is alive, the other where it's dead.
I think he came here to tell Zerstoerer. Who now knows we're here. Okay, so what did your Russian friend say? The skull isn't after Eve and it isn't after Nick either. There are a lot of prophecies about something called a Shaphat, that's what he wants.
It takes Hexenbiest blood to cross. A stick? That's how Nick was able to follow Eve. The stick couldn't get through. It can't.
A stick? That's how Nick was able to track Eve. The stick couldn't get through. It can't. It has to stay here.
"Follow and flee" Wait, if we untangle this properly: Grimm attracts child bride follow and flee, what does that mean? Free the devil in Another Place. And he needs a Grimm to lure something to follow him and run away.
Wait, if we untangle this properly: Grimm attracts child bride follow and run, what does that mean? Free the devil in another place. And he needs a Grimm to lure something to follow him and run away. He needs a Grimm to get him out of the place where he's trapped?
March 24th. Oh my God, that's the day. The day that was foretold all the planets are aligned and something very bad is going to happen. That's why the man with the skull is chasing Eve now, and she'd go after him now and Nick would follow her too. So he can use the Grimm to come back here and go after Diana.
Why do you ask? I think we've found a... Stop what you're doing. We can't open the portal. He needs Nick to get through the portal so he can too.
Look what David's holding. Oh, my goodness. I thought David killed Goliath with a slingshot. He had a staff, too, but for some reason, that part of the story isn't emphasized. Apparently David left this exact staff to his descendants, and the Davidic kings used it as a scepter until the destruction of the temple, when it miraculously disappeared.
The point is, it could be any one of these things or the combination of all of them. Let's do nothing... And this famous stick is supposed to help him by making Diana his child-wife and destroying the world as we know it. Long story short, we just have to destroy the Destroyer, or we're cooked. There's still something about Zerstoerer's staff that bothers me. It was completely cracked as if it had been reassembled with lots of different parts and none of these texts mention anything like that.
Long story short, we just have to destroy the Destroyer, or we're finished. There's still something about Zerstoerer's stick that bothers me. It was completely cracked as if it had been reassembled with lots of different parts and none of these texts mention anything like that. Yeah, something about it bothers me too. If he's as all-powerful as he's supposed to be by having belonged to all these people He supposedly belonged to...
Previously... - They said you were dead. - I think I was. I hope this stick does what we think it does.
- It cured her. - I'm being hunted. I think they're going to kill you... two men are waiting at your car. This time you chose the right side, Sean. Two dimensions exist simultaneously... One where the cat's alive, one where it's dead.
They can't be dead. He killed everyone. Except me, and I don't know why. Maybe he thought you were dead, or... the stick protected you. If the stick protected me, why didn't it do something to help Hank or Wu?
I don't know, sir. Bullets have no effect on him. I've got the stick. That's probably why I'm not dead. I tried to use it... on Wu... and Hank... but nothing happened.
- And the safe? - What about it? Is it the right one? We got the right safe. There was $3,000 in it.
We're off. I never went to school. It shows. A fancy wedding on a yacht? We'll do it when he's at sea.
Call me back, please. Call me. Thank you for calling. I saw your truck. It's in bad shape.
Mrs. Chandler's right, isn't she? If her husband didn't open the door himself, the killer must have used a registered phone to do it. Would that be possible, Mike? Mr. Bloom giving away his phone? I'm tracing his cell phone, and, right now, it seems to be coming back from Catalina.
If Mr. Bloom went out with his son's cell phone... He could have opened the application, discovered the new login and password, and told someone by calling from the landline. There's still a problem. No new Bluetooth devices have been registered at the Chandler home. I checked the wife's phone, and it hasn't left Santa Barbara.
- You may be right. I'm going to start by studying this bastard, but I'm also going to work with his lawyer, who, I'm sure you know, will be Linda Rothman. Why are you telling me this? Your case against Bloom isn't just thin. He's anorexic.
Everyone knows that, Mark. But do you know what it tells us about your businessman, Richard Bloom? Of all the phones at his disposal, picky Ricky chose this one because it's methodical, complicated. Our businessman doesn't take risks, and, in my humble opinion, that's why I think this phone was a mistake, because it proves his character.
- considering the new evidence... - What new evidence? Let them finish, Miss Rothman. Your Honor, we wanted to be careful not to reveal the results of our report prematurely. But as soon as it's complete, I'll personally give it to Melle Rothman myself.
But we still don't have proof that Paul Bloom is our killer, and whether or not he was at the Chandlers that night. Here we are, Paul. Sound familiar? Let's take a look at when you last used OffKey. Then we'll take your cell phone to Chandler's house and see if it sets off the alarm.
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Did Mike Tyson kick your ass? What happened to you? I hit a moose on Melrose Avenue. Must have escaped from Paramount Studios.
Me too, for that matter. But you went on. You told them the wire was attached to a kite. Not just any kite. It sent out fireworks... and had a rainbow tail.
- We need to talk. - I know why we need to talk. You know, I... I was stupid to think that keeping my word would kill the current between us. If he can overcome an age difference that's frowned upon by society, then...
- I know why. You know, I... I was stupid to think that keeping my word would kill the current between us. If he can overcome an age difference that's frowned upon by society, then... He could get through anything.
Do the others. First things first. The site should be easy to use and cool to look at. I don't want people to find it boring. Great, but who's going to do it to make sure it works?
I've done 24 this year. I've been busy. I'm done with art. Or rather... art is done with me. It has spoken.
Like, Bob Mackie and a divine orgasm. A vintage Gucci bag. Handmade by Italian women with a passion for fashion. You should see my apartment. It's unrecognizable.
When are you coming back for me? I don't. I didn't know you had a dog. I don't anymore. The dog died.
And after that, I hated everything. Everything. Even the sun. You know? It kept rising every morning, as if it were just another day and the world hadn't completely changed.
It's just... I haven't missed anyone this much in a long time. May I ask why you always have this? Just doing a favor for a friend of a friend. I am now ready for a bourbon. What's up? What's up?
This baby will only hasten the inevitable. Mandrake. Keep it with you at all times. She kicks you at night in the left flank with her heels. So close to your heart it feels like it might burst.
See them? Anyway, this is for Marie-Louise. I hear she likes to write. I hope she'll write to me one day. The pony is for Anne-Marie. I hope she likes it.
He must work in his garage, a bit like us. I'll show him our app. Just us coders, we'll be fine. You've got a big heart. It looks big. Everything else is shrinking.
20,000 dollars. You're doing fine. No, his patent is for backing up media files. He can't sue us. He probably can't. But to find out, we'll need a trial.
She fights constantly, and yet she was more anxious before she woke up than during your fight. That's odd. It makes perfect sense. The flaw doesn't come from the material. It comes from May herself.
If I study it, I could determine... No. Nobody touches it. When this is all over, I'm going to destroy that book myself. Because it's dangerous.
We could ask someone who wasn't on the op... - Agent Fitz. - Yes, Coulson. Sir. We haven't been able to locate the sub by satellite. Based on your best guess, you think it might be armed with missiles?
But my impulse, to keep Coulson out of danger, that desire... - it came from me. - Good for you. And I'm sorry to say... you're not him. What we can decipher from this insane bundle of code that surrounds us is that it duplicates our world.
No, not him. Why shouldn't he? Because he shouldn't go. I'll go in his place. I thought this world meant nothing to you - that it wasn't real.
Why shouldn't he? Because he shouldn't go. I'll go in his place. I thought this world meant nothing to you - that it wasn't real. - It isn't real.
You've seen the worst of what mankind is capable of. But so have I. The only thing that could prevent my children from going through the same shit we did is to make the hard choices instead of the easy ones. It's deciding not to kill men if there's no reason to. The world is the way it is.
Doesn't it make you feel alive? What are you doing here? I'm going to marry the Queen of Scots. She will never win your heart. It's mine.
Do you really want to attack this hive? Do you? An army of wasps could rise up and sting you. Is this fish fresh? It turns my stomach.
Yes, sir. With pleasure. Any other requests? There was tuna at Pains et Poissons yesterday. It looked good.
It's a little early for that. - Is the Putnam cake ready? - Yes, madame. I just have to wrap it. Then it's not ready.
That's all there is to it. So what do you think? Shall we go out and have some fun and kick some ass? Or do you want to measure the wall for your bike rack? It won't measure itself.
Yes! Roger. Svetlana... You know this desk isn't going to tidy itself, right? It's not tidy because one of us has been at work for three hours.
He saw a red Jaguar take Julie-Ann from the hospital on May 1st. I want to find her pronto. - We'll be right there. - Morgan, Tennison, go to the boss's office. Eddie Phillips puked all over the place and needs to be cleaned up.
Sergeant Harris posted me on foot patrol on Five Beat. Sorry about that. Tennison? There was a matching necklace. It was a set.
We took them 2 days before he died. On the street, he's called Oz. Thank you, sir. According to the plan, the 1st wall is somewhere. This is it.
Relax, unbuckle your seatbelts and enjoy the joys of weightlessness. Our film of the day: Comme des bêtes is about to start. Have you seen this movie? It's so funny.
Hello. I was told two young people came by, and here you are. Yes, we work a lot. We just wanted to get a better idea of what you do here before we took the plunge. We looked at your website and it says we can make a lot of money quickly.
- The piece of the spear... we've got to get it out of the castle. How can your team protect it? You couldn't protect Dr. Mid-Nite. - I'm not going anywhere, and neither is the fragment. It seems to contain a sophisticated receiver.
It can stand up to the Legion of Doom. I hope you're right. I'm usually right. I see the delineator. What's wrong with it? It's in Gertrude's territory.
- and his protector. - Beer, Professor. Make that a six-pack. How much further to the delineator? It's right above us.
- You flatter me. - I only write the truth. I'm learning to keep looking even when all the evidence points in one direction. There's always another angle. Even when it's hard to find.
- I only write the truth. I'm learning to keep looking even when all the evidence points in one direction. There's always another angle. Even when it's hard to find. Especially when it's hard to find.
This is not good at all, Kara. He's taken the national registry of aliens. Okay, I'm on my way. What's wrong? What's wrong? What's up? What's going on?
I'm the one! I'm the takeoff! - What's up? - This isn't a drill. Once this ship passes through the atmosphere, it'll accelerate to the speed of light.
I'm taking off! - What's up? - This isn't a drill. Once this ship passes through the atmosphere, it's going to travel at the speed of light. So we've got to stop it before it enters space.
It's under control. - Is that why you're calling? - No, actually. I called to get an update on the Daxamite ship. It seems to be in low orbit at the moment.
If it's about the people, then things have to change. One day, I'm going to be king. And I want to be a different kind of king. Why not start now? Why not rebuild our kingdom better than it's ever been.
- Delicate? - Yes. You broke one man's arm and gave the other a concussion. That was after you landed on the roof of a National City landmark. And now there's a giant hole the size of Supergirl.
Previously... To new friends! The portal could help your planet enormously and it could help me get home.
I think it's appropriate to set limits. Yes, but I want to be the one to set them. Like with your father? At least I'm talking to you about it right now. I know my past is a drag, but I can't pretend it doesn't exist.
- She'll let you know. I saw Haines' article. I don't know what Tom had in mind. Yes. He was careless.
The sewage system was hit. The government was targeted, and the aim, although thwarted, was to cut off the transportation network. These events underscore the urgency of my request to declare war. Tonight, members of Congress will spend a dark night, before reconsidering their paralysis and choosing to act. Capital East Telecom repairs the network as quickly as possible. No signal It will take two days to restore.
And why this sudden melancholy? Were you expecting to come out of the Hunting Chamber and into a family cured of dysfunction? When we walked in, it felt like the world had stopped. But it hadn't. It's still spinning.
I loved art. I used to make my own paintings from flowers and berries. Oranges are the liveliest. I love oranges. Oh, there's a butterfly. I think it's stuck.
Oranges are the liveliest. I love oranges. Oh, there's a butterfly. I think it's stuck. Yeah, it's got a broken wing.
Now it has to be fed. I feel dizzy. And my head hurts. Ah, Marcel, the spell is already on its way. It's sucking the life out of these children.
There's something you need to see. This guy Dominic... You trust him? Loyalty's good for business, and I give him a lot of business. This spirit... it's ancient. It ebbs and flows like the tide, food and sleep.
Loyalty is good for business, and I give it plenty of business. This spirit... it's ancient. It ebbs and flows like the tide, food and sleep. So it's awake, and I'm lunch. Well, it wants power.
It ebbs and flows like the tide, food and sleep. So it's awake, and I'm lunch. Well, it wants power. You're powerful. Right now it's stuck, caught between the world of the living and... where it's trapped.
Well, he wants power. You're powerful. Right now it's stuck, trapped between the world of the living and... where it's trapped. Was trapped? He freed himself.
[CRACKLING] [CRACKLING] [CRACKLING] Despite the spell I've cast, the medallion's integrity is becoming unstable. It won't be able to hold Elijah's soul much longer.
This book is special. This book represents an extension of the Hollow's power into this world, okay? It's just as eternal as she is. And I'm telling you, if I say this spell the right way, I can lock her in the book and wipe out the Hollow for good. So where is it?
You have allies. So tell me exactly how much of that damn rosebush is there. Enough to kill you and your whole family at least a dozen times over. So... do you want to give me Marcel, or should my friends and I put an end to the Mikaelsons once and for all? I wonder what the almighty Hollow will do when he finds out you've been plotting with the enemy.
Tell me what he wants. The Hollow has been inactive for some time. He needs to feed. Poor darling. I can see why he has a penchant for innocent children.
Is it too hot? At least you won't be scalded alive! You don't think I'm trying to get rid of him? I'm going through the file. That's why it's in my desk.
You don't think I'm trying to get rid of it, do you? I'm going through the file. That's why he's in my office. No charges have been brought against him. There was arbitration.
Freeze! Hands in the air! You, over there. - Did you steal our gun? - No, it was in his belt.
I don't want him to target us. So we decided to be afraid. This is our choice? If we do that, we join a war. And the next time you hear a gunshot, it'll come from right here.
But that doesn't mean he didn't have it, you know that. Michaelmas, when De La Warr's body arrived here, where was it stored? He had been dead at sea for some time. His body was hastily stored. But he was in the church at night?
The question is, who among us would choose this moment to undertake the equally perilous task of digging up a man's body to perhaps find the map to the gold? De La Warr came back here as governor? - But he died at sea. - Do I understand correctly? If we found the gold, then it would belong to the Company?
He went up the river. How could Henry Sharrow have got his hands on the map? Could he have gotten it from a sailor who traveled on the ship where De La Warr's body lay? Perhaps he waited until the treasure he could find was his alone. Had he left earlier, it would have been yours, Master Massinger.
You're a great tutor. When the Vikings invaded, they'd take their ships out on shore, turn them upside down and live inside like houses until they'd looted enough to build new ones. And? You didn't see any ships out there. When the colonists arrived, they must have lived inside and started building from there, it's still here, inside this building.
- Please pay attention. Attention. Erewhon system engaged. Ship's systems respond to human presence. He was asleep.
Attention. Erewhon system engaged. Ship's systems respond to human presence. He was asleep. We've arrived, now he's waking up.
- What's in them? What's in those capsules? - I was wrong. I was very, very wrong. The Colonial ship isn't on its way, it's right here.
It looks so simple. And now I have to go. What if you don't? Well, Kyle doesn't direct and the universe explodes. Does it really explode or does it just open up?
Stuff was thrown everywhere, but everything seems to be here. I don't know what the hell they were looking for. Maybe nothing. How is that possible? You have a security system. It was on.
Please, I'll do it for you. I'll face Henry Sharrow and tell him. Please, I'll do it for you. You're the purest woman I've ever known. Don't let this place do to you what it's done to us men.
Interesting developments indeed. 2 years ago, a private plane crashed into a field in North Dakota. Six dead. The black box showed nothing wrong with the plane. It just fell out of the sky.
There's still work to be done. Breathe out. What's going on? The good news is the fluid in his lungs is drained. But it'll be back.
- Marie-Antoinette. - Privileged. - Yes. And I intend to keep my privileged neck. I had it contoured in January after Colicchio told me it was wrinklier than an old apple.
To the toilet! They said "the can". We should sew up her anus so she can't shit. But where would the poo go? It would fill her lungs and suffocate her.
Snape was a Slytherin. He had an altruistic love. I had a snake as a kid. A Burmese python named Krueger. Technically, he was Cal's, but Krueger preferred me.
- By giving up a little ballast. - And there's the catch. There's always a catch. As eloquent as your requests are, they don't take into account the current economic situation. The federal budget for private prisons is restrictive and too complex for me to explain here, but believe me, it clearly prohibits us from acceding to all these demands.
I do believe I'm in love. I have to get her hooked on my pheromones. We have a meth problem. My finger. It still hurts.
You've taken me hostage. - Why would I want to help you? - I'll fill you in. Previously on the Screwed Prison Channel, we're negotiating for stuff like justice, better living conditions and education. The governor gave us chips. We said they don't buy us. They don't take us seriously. They say we have an education program, when we all know it's about digging trenches and getting tetanus.
Not good. Not good. But don't worry. Your face is under there. And it's beautiful.
All right. All right. All right. What happened to you? I need some help! Then we'll have to iron his cells... But don't touch the iron. You might burn your fingers.
I'll get us some coffee. I broke the vase. You what? The vase in your room. Was it green or blue?
Yes, I know. That's why this better be important. We've got a little problem. Great, it's small.
- Hou hou! But what are you really going to tell them? I'll start with the life cycle of the atom. A baby atom is called a "neutron," and when it turns professional, it becomes a proton.
But what are you really going to tell them? I'll start with the life cycle of the atom. A baby atom is called a "neutron," and when it turns professional, it becomes a proton. And if it wants to become elected, it's an electron.
Chips is what I call my Pringles. Just watch the movies. Words and ideas can change the world. Oh, look at this world! It's just pissing its pants.
- He can't do that. - And yet he can't. We'll have to stop him, then. Its scales glistened like precious stones. And this fish was so big, when he wiggled his fin, huge waves hit the shore.
There's no need for it to get out. The images are already ready for broadcast. I understand, it's your wife, but it's a matter of terrorism, of homeland security. It would therefore be a crime, in this case treason, to broadcast these images. Doesn't the public have the right to know about the danger they're facing?
I'm really sorry about what happened to Eugenia. - She was a good person. - Thank you for your time. Yes, listen... We understand that you want to say goodbye to her as she deserves, but as a financial advisor, I have to inform you that there are usually penalties for early withdrawal that can be very high.
Of course, but if I may say so... This card... I beg your pardon. All this belongs to you. The first time I came here, you showed me this stream, and I saw that it ran west.
It's all yours. The first time I came here, you showed me this stream, and I saw it flowing west. Strange, isn't it? West? If you follow the creek all the way up to Jefferson City, it flows into the Missouri.
The first time I came here, you showed me this stream, and I saw that it flowed westwards. Strange, isn't it? West? If you follow the creek all the way up to Jefferson City, it flows into the Missouri. So it doesn't depend on the Missouri River, it's one of its tributaries.
I was right there. I killed you. My cacodemon... Your cacodemon wasn't powerful enough to kill me. He tried.
I've killed you. My cacodemon... Your cacodemon wasn't powerful enough to kill me. It tried. But when he saw he couldn't win... well, let's just say he locked me up in a very convenient place. In that stupid trap tattooed on your back.
It's really fucked up. Why on earth would she do that? To kill your friend. I tell Moon to calm down, but she repeats, "This baby is evil." "It could hurt even more people."
Why do you want to kill us when you know we may all die soon? I'm not here to kill you. I'm here to take your ship, a ship you repaired to save your people, not mine. This ship is an emergency plan. It can only hold 100 people.
Phosphoromancy. I'm an idiot. Correct. Shut up, I remember. The viewing device, it's in Professor McKellan's office.
-We've loosened up. -We do the work of men. Is this God's will? My heart no longer beats. Every day, it runs out.
I swear, I've been stuck in there for eight hours. Jesus, are you okay? Yeah, honey, I'm fine. I wanted your wedding day to be perfect. It will be, when you get here.
If each of you had half the courage of Silas Sharrow, you'd face him alone, not in an arrogant crowd. Have you forgotten the Silas you knew for so many years, or is your camaraderie so fickle? Forgive me, Silas. For pushing you away. It's my wounded spirit, it got the best of me.
- Good. - And bad. The only way to get there, Service Corridor Seven. In the process of separating into a corrosive fog. it targets everything organic.
It was there when they brought me in. Their research and development focused on healing. I hope I can bring my leg back. But no such luck. When I spray this on fresh skin, it keeps it alive and supple between hosts.
- He moved. - I'm sorry, what? The ship... this ship. Turin brought it here for me to study. It moved... and recently.
La Pièce qui Chante. Isn't it beautiful? I don't know about singing, but it sure is beautiful. I mean, this ship is, like, 100 years old. Amazingly, it still works.
No, it's nothing, I... I thought you'd look better. - But how did you...? - A sexy deduction. First, the ship moved when it was in danger and stopped when it was safe.
- do something great. - There won't be a next time. But I'm the new nerd. Dutch said so. And as the old nerd, I'm telling you your job isn't fair. You gotta be careful.
Can I try something? Yeah, sure. Never mind. His neural link is an asset. It gives total control of the ship, shields, navigation, weapons...
Are you sure? I checked. Whatever that white wall is, it's coming our way. We've got to get out of here. Let's take the Blink Drive and get out of here before it hits.
Time. Very funny. It wasn't a joke. I've spent 48 hours analyzing the Blink Drive and I still can't see the solution. I don't know why it activated or how to fix it.
I've got an idea. - Six, your turn. - Yeah, go ahead. Jake says to pump up the rear tire. - It might be flat.
I didn't know its value. If Tabor knew, he didn't tell me. How do you know he didn't take it with him? He was paranoid about keeping stolen objects in his room, so he gave them to me. It should be on my hard drive.
He can decide when he wakes up. In the meantime, we need to find a file. There's a force... field. How's it look? The good news is it looks like the right file because it's got Ferrous' military-grade encryption.
Are you sure? I checked. Whatever that white wall is, it's coming our way. We've got to get out of here. Let's take the Blink Drive and get out of here before it hits.
Prepare the air assault. They just dropped a bomb. What's that? Another ship has come out of FTL, - and it's opening fire.
So how did you get here? Are you saying that security let you come? - They had no choice. - That's a lie. We just saved your asses by neutralizing a missile before it razed
I'm telling you... Where are you going? I'm telling you, look... Look at the screen. Tell me what it says.
They're laying the groundwork for the next wave. In fact, it's worse than you think. You're not really Five, are you? Of course you're not. Your mind is too primitive to understand what we are, too afraid of the truth... so it seeks the comfort of familiar images.
We can't get to the shuttle. There are no exits. We have to get to the station reactor. - Why do we have to do that? - It's powering the anomaly...
Raza, this is the Marauder approaching. Did the Mikkei ship just fire a missile? Affirmative. Tactical nuclear device. It seems to be targeting the base.
When I was a little boy, about your age, I saw one trying to get out. But he was in trouble, so I tried to help him. Really gently, I cut the envelope and the butterfly flew out! But it couldn't fly.
The serial number matches a gun sold in '89, in Indiana. Looks like someone's been playing hockey-with it, ever since. - Does it work? Ballistics says it goes off.
Inside, the temperature rises. Then, for 30 to 40 days... you can't touch it. Meanwhile, the green wood on top dries out completely. The green wood heats up. When it reaches a certain temperature... it causes pyrolysis... and turns into charcoal.
With tebasaki, chicken wings, the skin should be crispy. The fat between the skin and the flesh is delicious. If the temperature is too low, the fat sinks. If it's too high, it crisps. When sake is added, it takes on a pretty color.
So the $43 from your tits is going to take us to Texas? Don't forget the rolls I've got between my butt cheeks. Sweaty but ready. Okay, everybody, can you shut up? I have to make a boat before it leaves for New Orleans.
Oh, four. No winners. Yes, winners. We had four, but the boat moved our chips. Yeah, and it also knocked over my soda.
Is "they" the whole of New York? Drop the brains, zombie scum! The script says "keenly", not "British". I can't move to Los Angeles. We worked so hard to get the dessert bar where it is.
Easy, Dad. You need a tête-à-tête with Black Jack Foley. You need to talk about Sandicot. The proposed location for a casino. - Is that where he is?
Axelrod lacks 5 of the 8 Bushido virtues. 6. Often, he wasn't even polite. Under these circumstances, honor doesn't demand silence or self-mutilation. It demands vengeance.
Tell them I'm in, with a big donation. All I want is their assurance that Jack Foley will be named their Man of the Year and that I'll be the one to present him with the thing. A package arrived for you. It's on your desk. It smells musty.
Walker wants these relics. It's a trailer full of crap. Are you scared? You'd better be careful. My sense of hospitality may bother you, but trust me, it's better than theirs.
The last words are for idiots who haven't said enough. Marx. Karl Marx. Tell me about your champagne, Victor Strand. It's from 1985.
♪ Baby, baby, baby ♪ I didn't think those pants came with an erection. I don't know where that came from. You know how they say rhythm is in you? It's in me!
I would, but I can't get these pants off. Max, come on. You can't let one bad experience ruin everything. Otherwise, I won't be using our bathmat. It's hot for no reason.
I've been there. With a stroller? I ask because that's how I push it. This wedding won't make it to the banquet hall. I don't even think it's going to make it to the car.
But I do think we can change life, but I know deep down you care. Can I choose the color? It's 7 o'clock. What am I doing here? Van, this gadget we created just alerted me that Jack-O-Lantern was in this area, giving us enough time to get to safety. It uses advanced chemoreceptors to select Jack-O-Lantern's unique olfactory profile.
It's 7 o'clock. What am I doing here? Van, this gadget we created just alerted me that Jack-O-Lantern was in this area, giving us enough time to get to safety. It uses advanced chemoreceptors to pick out Jack-O-Lantern's unique olfactory profile. We call it "Jack-O-Lert". It's discreet, stylish and available in a sangria shade.
Yes, but... All right, Pete, show him the money. So, the idea... is to mark each bill with an ultra-fine tracer powder. That way, whoever touches the money will be marked by the powder. Then we follow the money, and find out exactly where it's going. I get it.
What happened? The pneumonia was going to take you, but we couldn't give you the cure until your wounds healed a little. What happened with Blaine? Is the memory serum working? It's not working.
Gern Blanston. I don't see why not. Tell me about our first kiss. It's a memory I don't want to lose. It was actually an intense makeup session.
I was just telling Mark how much I miss Marshall. He's not far away. Where are you off to? I forgot my bag. Here it is.
And that's a threat I can't tolerate. Once again, we're at an impasse. Perhaps not. Our world is at a turning point. It can't take a war.
A society that will benefit every living being on this planet. There will be no more violence, no more crime. And we'll all live out our happiness in peace. This is our future, my friends. And it's bright.
Hi, Miranda. All set for tomorrow? What's tomorrow? Don't make fun of me. You bring the fridge and, when it's empty, you carry me out with it.
This man just died in excruciating pain, and you want to do it again? You got a better idea, Raven? So what, we go out there, capture someone else? Nobody's going anywhere in this storm. We wait it out.
You got a better idea, Raven? So what, we go out there, capture someone else? Nobody's going anywhere in this storm. We wait it out. When it's over, there may not be anyone left to capture.
Where did you get this? I found it. And I think that's what led me to you. Tell us about the symbol. Where does it come from?
Mother. Gaia, please. Skaikru helped you protect the Flame. Help us now. It adorns the crypt of the first commander,
We're counting on the Democrats in the Senate to support Senate Bill 8180. Given your record as Massachusetts State's Attorney, I want to have you as an ally. Gun regulation in Massachusetts is the most important in the country. Background checks should be universal. This project may not go as far as you want, but it's headed in the right direction.
All I ask is that you listen to your conscience when you vote. - It's going to be close. - I've done all I can. You've opened the door. If the project goes through, it will be thanks to you. - The President knows that. - And if it fails?
And finally, Mr. Zwick. Come on. Yes. For this vote, there are 51 for, and 49 against. - Carried!
How can you expect me to continue working here after you've taken me away from everyone? I haven't alienated you. I haven't yet. He used me to force you to stay? You know, this lab... it reminded me of everything that was wrong with my life.
I think his time off did him good. I don't take time off. Shepherd tortured you, your boyfriend shot you, then tried to give you a lethal injection. You're entitled to a few days' sick leave. You've been working on that leopard tattoo for two weeks... maybe Sandstorm took it off Jane's body because it was a dud.
Well, when my memory was erased, I was... I was a total mystery, even to myself. And someone told me to start with small choices, like coffee or tea. Looks like you chose for me. You like coffee with as much sugar as it can hold.
- Beautiful house. I saw the knife that was used to kill Jones. It wasn't yours, it was Freddy's. Patterson solved the leopard tattoo. It leads to Kat Jarrett.
How could you not see it? All your work... Your whole job is to analyze people. You bugged his office, for God's sake. He was right in front of you, but you were too busy listening to the right people.
Can you get past his security measures? Technically, the U.S. government prohibits me from operating anything illegal... Local security isn't the problem. The tricky part is the badge in Riley's hand. It generates a new eight-digit password every 90 seconds, and it can't be reproduced... we need the code.
Go for it. Thank you for your time. I forgot my wallet! Did you... look on the coffee table? It was on the dresser. Great, you found it.
We retreat to familiar, reassuring places, behind the ramparts of our virtuous bastions. But these are only illusions. We are not safe behind these walls. Nor in our homes, nor in ourselves. We have been deceived. Not... by the one who seduces all. The devil doesn't exist. But devil or not, evil is real, it exists.
We are not safe behind these walls. Nor in our homes, nor in ourselves. We've been deceived. Not... by the one who seduces all. The devil doesn't exist. But devil or not, evil is real, it exists. It poisons us, it spreads hatred, madness and death.
Matthew? Piece of shit. A smokescreen in the face of the world, a load of crap. I believe in good and evil. And that good can and must prevail. And it will, as long as it lives in the hearts of the virtuous.
A fallen angel. I'm speaking to you as a neighbor and a friend. And as a reverend... who can listen and keep your secret. The veil over Midnight... It's unraveling... and Evil is drawn here.
Uh, Fiji made this place a shrine to the dead. Thank you, Fiji. Oh, well. Oh, this quartz is sometimes called the dawn crystal. With light behind it, it can release UV rays, like sunlight.
Not anymore. They poisoned it. - They poisoned him with what? - The money. He's helpless until it wears off.
Good thinking. In our opinion, given his location, he must have acted quickly with us on his tail. She has defensive wounds. Right, the coroner thinks she tried to struggle at some point, probably when he abducted her. We found someone else's blood on her, enough to launch a search, and we were able to confirm that it was Yates'.
It's a mass of skin and cells, like a tumor. Wilson, stop talking about the symptoms and talk about the patient. Kristen Rochester, 16, 31 weeks pregnant, ultrasound revealed TRAPS syndrome. It's hard to be sure since their ultrasound machine is a piece of crap. It's just dated.
Wherever his spirit is, I can't find it. - But he's not... - Brain-dead, no. His mind is active. What's he doing, then?
A fungus that infects ants. It's priceless, really. The spores take over their central nervous system and force them to climb very high, so the fungus starts to grow, splintering the top of their heads like a branch. It kills them, of course. So it can spread new spores over the jungle, infecting more ants.
What if it fails? Think of the Shadow King as a computer virus. He's been inside David's head for decades. Learning his systems, bypassing his defenses. Now it's ready to replace the original program.
Just a moment. How does this work? We've identified other brainwaves in David's brain. This device targets anything that isn't David. It creates a vortex...
Sorry, folks. I'm having a little trouble keeping up. - Wha... - The monster. You know what he is.
Your rational self. You have a seizure... in response to stress. Your power steps in to save you. It created me.
- Good. Carry on. Let's just say, for now, that Dad was worried about my safety. So in response, to protect myself, I'm going to live with my other mother and father... adoptive... in secret. Who knows how, the monster was watching and he found me.
He could take his revenge. Or worse. Then Syd arrives. She wakes me up. The monster realizes he can't hide anymore.
That's how Olivia knew. It's all in this document. - If anyone else sees it... - They won't. Whatever he says about us, we'll destroy that chapter.
Guess who had a vision of Natalie whispering that number to Janko? I mean Major Lilywhite... The number sounds like a dangerous thing to have. I could enter the number. See if it's traceable.
Get him out of here!" "Seventy cents! And twenty-five cents for a banana!" "Anything you want! Buy it before it rots!"
I say to myself, "Thank God he's black. That is, "Thank God for that ego in him..." When this thing came down from heaven, or from the cosmos, if you believe what Joel Osteen says... Yes ? When that thing fell, it could land on anyone.
That is, "Thank God for that ego inside him..." When that thing came from heaven, or the cosmos, if you believe what Joel Osteen says.... Yes ? When that thing fell, it could land on anyone. Thank God... it landed on a black man.
Yes ? When that thing fell, it could have landed on anyone. Thank God... it landed on a black man. Thank God he was wrapped up in there, stuck in there. He's safe now.
When that thing fell, it could have landed on anyone. Thank God... it landed on a black man. Thank God he was wrapped up in there, stuck in there. He's safe now. Nothing to worry about as long as he's here. Because if that ego had fallen... and landed on a blue-eyed white guy, there's no telling what damage it might have done.
Long story short, she talks to this gorilla, and one day she decides to give him a kitten. A little kitten. Immediately, I say to myself, "Not a kitten! It's a gorilla." He's going to take the head off, throw the body over there, and play with the head.
He was super sweet and full of joy. It was beautiful. They realized that he loved this kitten, so they used it as a teaching tool. Every evening, they took the cat back, and came back the next day. If the gorilla knew his words, he'd play with the kitten.
So, what I wanted to say... This woman has to go to the zoo and tell the gorilla that the kitten is dead. She goes to the zoo, and the gorilla is excited. This is his favorite moment. His mind is awake and he goes to see his friend.
His mind is awake and he goes to see his friend. At this point, he has a crazy vocabulary. The woman arrives. The gorilla is excited. He looks at her: "Holy shit!
What's going on? Is there something I should know?" The woman sits there... "Well... Well, the... the kitten... was run over... and it's fucking dead."
"Well... Well, the... the kitten... was run over... and it's fucking dead." The gorilla understood immediately. Immediately. His lips began to tremble, the tears to flow, he was saying, "Cry."
I have to think about this? Can't this be the end? It's not fucking possible. This gorilla understands the concept of death. If he understands the concept of death, he understands that he's in captivity.
Dr. Grey Kepner. Yes. I'm sorry, sir. I know his name as it is on
We're going to find Patterson. What do you got? I walked into one of Sandstorm's phone operators. This man right here, the one Roman "forked"... he sent a message to Borden and 15 others late last night. But the message... it just looks like spam.
You've been in a car accident and are seriously injured, but we're taking care of you. And my baby... She's fine. That's the heart sound. It's perfectly normal.
It's Karev. - Where's the social? - What's that? The social security number. It's not on here.
Can I have a portable ultrasound - in bed 2, please? - Of course. Dr. Murphy, tell me about bed 2. It's a 9-year-old boy with right upper quadrant pain.
No, I'm not hungry. Come on, can't we be civil? I've always been a good surgeon. But I'm an excellent teacher, and today I was very bad. I know you thought this program had problems, well, it does now, that's for sure.
- What happened? - The donor's remaining kidney had a stenosis. When we opened it, the vessel was shelled and obstructed. Where does the kidney go? To the mother or to the son? It was already in the son's block.
He was already in the son's block. What does the law say? The mother signed the papers. The kidney has crossed the line. It belongs to the boy now.
At her expense? She came here in perfect health. If you'd found the stenosis a minute later, we wouldn't even be talking about it. The kidney would already be in the boy's body. But it isn't. And if we don't get it into a body soon, the kidney will die, and no one will have it. So who do we give it to?
Claire, how are you feeling? I'm gonna check your dressing, okay? I wasn't going to put... in the order. They've got you on, and off, they've got schematics, and conditions... Claire, we've been monitoring your pacemaker and it's working fine.
Of course. Of course. It's fine. It's fine. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. It's hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The left side of Gus's heart is underdeveloped, and he can't send enough oxygenated blood to the rest of his body.
Tell me how bad. You have a cerebral hemorrhage. Good heavens. Elsie, the bleeding is only going to get worse. It could become very severe at any moment.
I don't think Karel was talking about a garage sale. It was more in the spiritual sense. It's a bad idea to focus on the past, because it pollutes the present. We spend so much time trying to fix things from the past that we can't see what's good for us in the present. We have to free ourselves from the past, because it doesn't exist.
That's a coincidence. - Hop in. I'll give you a lift. - No, I'm on my bike. It's nearby.
And I... succeeded. Has the bleeding stopped? He's stable, but the clamp won't hold for long. When will help arrive? Lancaster has sent a helicopter, but it's 400 km from here and only flies at 240 km per hour.
Lucinda said the U.S. brought Norteguay to its knees through sanctions. Now they want to hurt our economy. By mixing a huge amount of counterfeit currency with the real thing, the dollar will evolve. Once the public discovers indistinguishable counterfeits, the bank runs will begin as people start to fear that their money is worthless. It's going to go global, it's going to crash the world economy.
Your lung tissue will bleed, and you'll drown in your own blood. With the volume of this warehouse, we have approximately 5 minutes before suffocation. any luck with those sprinklers? Gas isn't as dense as smoke. It won't set off the alarm.
Let's go, let's go! Keep moving! Keep moving. This building. It contains nothing but machines.
Which is bad, because we're above the San Fernando aquifer. And if the chemicals fall into the sinkhole, they'll contaminate the aquifer, it'll destroy the drinking water for part of Southern California. Millions will lose their homes, stores will close, tens of thousands of acres of farmland will be unusable. A fiscal and humanitarian disaster. We've got to get these products out of the silo before it falls.
Fertilizer is made from hydrochloric acid. There should be some in the plant. We could use it to dissolve the steel wall and then create an exit without shaking the silo. It's going to take time. We need to stabilize the silo or it will fall before we're done.
We could use it to dissolve the steel wall and then create an exit without shaking the silo. It's going to take time. We need to stabilize the silo or it will fall before we're done. But how? It's ready to fall.
It's holding, but who knows for how long? How far along are you? Well, the steel's thicker than I thought; I might not be able to get it out in time. You see, the more the silo tilts, the more pressure the trucks have to counterbalance, and with their power, if the silo tilts another four degrees, it falls.
It's a record label. The symbol on the phone we found is the label's logo. And they chose to release this music of their own accord? It's a pretentious label. It only exists to produce the music of one guy.
Will you calm down? They have my files, all the businesses. I'm going to jail. Ben, how many deals did you and I set up? We knew this day would come eventually, that it would end.
How dare you tempt me with a bookstore! - We need to focus. - You're right. We do. Teddy's over there. And he's relaxed, in casual clothes. His phone is on the table, as it always is, because he's afraid it'll affect his testicles.
Oh, she's gonna hate me. That's a good point. It took me a long time to tell you. Love is mischievous. It always comes along when you least expect it.
Once I start, you'll feel a little pressure, and it might be a little uncomfortable. But it... it won't hurt. I promise. Will cancer complicate childbirth? Your body is already working overtime, so surgery is an added stress, but if there are complications, then we'll deal with them.
Can you give me a hand? Okay, one second. Yes ? The body adapts. It protects itself.
and smoke instead. Yeah. But we decided to talk to them once. Can you wipe my nose? - Is he sweating?
But she had the same Arma Mutata symbol tattooed on her arm. She works with or for Dreyfuss. She stole this book to bring to him. Which book was it? It might give us a clue to where the Totem of War is hidden.
Is our good fortune still with us? For the time being. No sign of patrols. Are you sure the parcel is safe? It is, below the farm in a hiding place of my own invention.
Yes, you are. And you've got magic at your fingertips. A Crystal enchanted to eliminate a demon. He didn't eliminate it. It only imprisoned it.
Isn't it? I think so. - I'll get the doctor. - Yeah, that's a good idea. I swallowed a penny when I was 6, I want to see if it's still there.
He doesn't have super-speed without gravity. News flash, Raymond. You don't need this to kick your ass. What's the red button for? It separates the LEM from the control module.
I innovate, invent and inspire. A genius brain requires a genius challenge. Just go. Enjoy your family, squander your fortune. The world is as it should be.
Don't you get it? It's a scar from reality acting on your subconscious. A reality scar. What does it do? Theoretically, it targets irregularities in the hippocampus, acting like a Z-control for memories.
I should have listened to you during the First World War. If we'd used it when we had the chance... I would have been tempted to change my future. Now we have nothing to lose. I know you've worked hard on this project, and I wanted to thank you, but if it doesn't work in the next few minutes, I'll have to kill you.
Just a moment, Mr. Thawne. I need... I need a moment. Here we are. As you can see, the machine seems to be working, but it may take some time for the core to reach its highest temperature. You'll stay until it does.
Sorry Doug, time's up already. But it was nice to meet you, and I'll be in touch. What the hell was that? I'm interviewing potential roommates. When I agreed to take over Max's lease, I didn't realize how expensive it was.
It really worked. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! My photo album. I've kept it since I don't know when. I don't know how it got there, but...
There's a knife and lots of blood. Who's holding the knife? Who stabs Rosa? I've no idea. It's in my hand.
He said there was someone else in the motel room, but... Who holds the knife? Who stabs Rosa? I don't know. I don't know. It's in my hand.
It's a fool's game. Don't let my words alarm you. I promise you they'll pay dearly for what they've done to us. Thank you, my lord. What's your price? If it's not right, keep it.
Space... The final frontier. Ultimate because it wants us dead.
What's this? This... is my ringtone. Also known as a distress call. Do you like distress calls? You can only see the true face of the universe when it's calling out for help.
I'm just saying that Nardole said... Four. Four, Bill. Four survivors, one distress call. The universe shows its true face when it calls for help.
Listen to this. Still insolent after all this time! Please explain. The oxygen is for personal use, at a preferential rate. It's only in the suits.
- No! - What is it? Our vital signals. He's linked them to the cooling system. If we die, it will drain.
Oh, Doctor! Look, a burial mound... from the Pictish civilization. The bird! What's wrong with it? He said "black".
The bird! What's wrong with it? He said "black". That's why we hurry, because it's dark. But it spoke! Of course it did.
Hold it! Turn it over! The sun's coming up! Reverse! Back into the void! It'll stay open as long as the sunlight shines on it.
Does the whole mode include Topher? No, he's not part of the deal. He's the heart and soul of this hospital. A hospital doesn't need a heart and soul. It needs a leader.
But who is the customer, and what should we do for them? She did. Joan Davis contacted us. She e-mailed us after reading about our use of echolocation in bat caves in Arizona. and she wants to use our technique to find lost treasure. We've designed an acoustic gun. It shoots sound waves into the water which bounce upwards.
Good news. Well, the good news is, with the boat destroyed, so is the source of the electrical interference. We'll be able to communicate with the base and tell the others what's happened, and they'll come and rescue us. You're going to have to do that because my transmitter is at the bottom of the ocean; it fell off when I jumped.
Wrong. For now, it's a table. That's it. I'm building an astrolabe to determine our exact position. Happy already knew the coordinates of our boat before it exploded.
On what? If it had been me, I'd have cobbled together some kind of raft out of debris, tied together with shoelaces and cables from the hydrophones. Walt probably did the same. We're in the North Pacific Gyre. It's big and swirly and occupies the northern basin of the Pacific.
Two of our informants were killed. Given the speed of decryption, we suspect they're using an Enigma-type machine to crack the code. A continuous cryptogram, probably working on various algorithms simultaneously. The names on the list are individually encrypted for this situation, so they have to crack them one by one. But if the codes have all been generated by the same program, as the cipher decodes them, it will take on the programmer's idiosyncrasies, becoming more efficient.
Listen, until I see any potential new salespeople, I just need you to keep the bar steady without screwing anything up. Got it, boss. But in the meantime, I'm still going to show you the Fitzpatrick method. You do realize that the name Fitzpatrick is synonymous with total screw-up. Yeah, well, if you don't want it to be "synonymous"...
I had to give them to Lavender after he fingered you behind the dumpster. OKAY. Well, everything seems to be in order. Thank you, Mr. Swan. I'd like to say the pleasure was all mine, but as we both know, it was mostly yours.
Hello ! Is the beef fresh? It has a big impact if you add more. Is the beef fresh? Is it fresh?
Is the beef fresh? It has a big impact if you add more. Is the beef fresh? Is it fresh? Is it fresh?
You were there. I know I was. Thank you for bringing back this very painful memory! Can I... draw on this... Why not? It's in pieces, like me.
I gave you the means to lay gold. But you lay pubic hair with shit and gravel... Wait a minute. Jian-Yang created a pretty good classifier. The core works. It just needs training.
- Couldn't we... - Absolutely! Let's put it in the garage. Where I sleep? Yes. There's plenty of room.
Looking for something to do? You're lucky I'm giving you the time of day. I've got tons of stuff to do. I've got a thriving incubator. It's thriving.
Check out his site. Give virtual coins to virtual homeless. Grow virtual corn to feed virtual villages. What kind of crap is this? It claims to turn a mobile device into an empathetic machine, but it does nothing.
Good. See? That's all I had to say. That's all I had to say. Do you like halwa? No. - You should try it, it's delicious.
And he didn't hide his anger. Daddy! Daddy! You opened your salon? Sell my kidney and open a second one! Sell all my organs! Sell my heart while it's still beating!
Abandoned years ago. How do you know this? My ex-husband was the developer. When the scandal came out, he fled town, the building was condemned, and no one had the money to tear it down. It just sat there.
I wanted her to feel comfortable. I'm here now. What do you want me to do? Take a deep breath, and let this little gem get started. It's asking for a password.
I'm asking for a gift. A gift? Yes, well, name it and we'll find it for you. You've already got it. It's in your pocket.
Since I'm hungry, I go to my favorite ramen place, Mr. Taka. I know it, it's good. It's delicious. I love their chicken ramen. It has the delicious lemony taste of yuzu.
Your discipline is meta-composition. You are a student of Knowledge. - Knowledge? - Half psychic, half physical. There's no branch it doesn't touch.
This is where we keep the books that are too dangerous for the public. I suspect the curse tried to steal its contents. Wait, Howard kamikazed himself because some guy wanted banned books? How disgusting! What's... disgusting is that there's knowledge so dangerous that it needs a poison room to keep it out of the wrong hands.
Listen... here's the deal. I just read your book in the library, both volumes. My book? Why do you ask? Because it ends like all the others, in a few days, with 20 blank pages.
We'll make sacrifices. I want to have children with the man I love! I want to have a real family with a man who loves me! Everyone has a weird family. You can't trust normal families!
- No, I didn't. But it's Heather's choice. Your last choice was whether or not to use a condom. Besides, you screwed up. Okay, so when the baby comes, I'm responsible for it, but I don't get to decide if it should come.
It would be faster on Route 50. Who told you that? Your little telephone? Yes. It says there's an accident up ahead.
To the south. When you feel you have to lock the doors, you approach my house. Shit! Shit! Shit! Is that your phone? No, it's on silent. And it's in the fucking lake!
We'll be fine. We've got four-wheel drive, chains... One of the belts works. I packed a suitcase, so I guess we'll be staying in a hotel. I didn't say it was a hotel. It better be!
- Since he knows that you're... - Pregnant? I told him. I was gonna say spinster, but yes. Say, Heather, I got a question. Hypothetically speaking, if the baby saw something coming at him... could he push himself off?
You see, I have a great sense of humor. Has the fuse blown? Rust on the terminals? Is the choke broken? Are you going to ask me if the gas has run out?
You know what they say. Once you get past the mesosphere, you don't.... The bottom line is these guys want a partnership with Reeves. They're practically throwing money at us. And with your track record, look at the way he does it.
Ladies and gentlemen, please acclaim the finest men and women of Chicago's 13th Ward for saving my life! It was a good idea. Using the drone. Yeah, well, I guess it has its uses. Until it gets sentient and tries to kill us.
Promise me you won't do anything foolish. That's a promise I can't keep. Foolishness is in my nature. You're tired of my advice, but here's a last one... Your heart guides you and I know it's good.
It's a promise I can't keep. Foolishness is in my nature. You're tired of my advice, but here's one more... Your heart guides you and I know it's good. I pray it remains pure.
Except maybe with you two. But I will fight you and I will win. So why argue? The king recognizes only one God. His preference is for agreement. - He'd better be good.
He wants to lure Gabler so he can kill him. It's revenge. Mr Gabler? Are you bringing the money? It's in the back seat.
Mahalo, Max. This may come as a surprise to you, but I've always thought of you as a kind of role model. It is, it surprises me. Surprise us all, Max, but go on. I've always been the victim of your sarcasm, but to tell you the truth, it's never bothered me.
You'll continue to investigate, interrogate, bully people. It's more than your job. It's your nature. This poison is like love. Why is it like love? There's a mystery ingredient.
It's more than your job. It's your nature. This poison is like love. Why is that? There's a mystery ingredient. I haven't figured out what it is yet... but I'll keep looking until I do.
I have my friends here. No, I miss you too. Taste this wine. It's incredible. I'll taste it. It tastes like feet.
Taste this wine. It's incredible. I'll drink to that. It tastes like feet. You're nuts! It's disgusting.
None of us do, as far as I can see. What do you want? Does the global authority still have an interest in claiming the stolen gauntlet? That's what started all this hullabaloo in the first place, isn't it? I suppose it's valuable.
I just have a few questions. Let me see your badge. There's nothing there, man. Okay. It's probably in the car.
- He has Lucy. - What are you talking about? What do you mean, he's got Lucy? - Where's the mother ship? - Uh... It's everywhere.
They all do. Let's not, shall we? What if this is the secret to P.T.'s longevity? The treatment isn't working? We'll have to wait and see.
It was one of my favorite creatures. And you think, "If my favorite creature goes through this, what else is going on?" That's when I realized that one of the biggest problems with the ocean is that we don't see it or think about it. Basically, it's a publicity problem. When we take an interest in our planet, we realize that it's unique because we have this ocean, which is the source of life. And it controls everything.

And die of hunger. As the coral whitens, the flesh becomes translucent. What you see is the skeleton underneath. The white flakes you see in the photos are the skeletons. If the coral is bright white, it's still alive.
What you see is the skeleton underneath. The white flashes you see in the photos are the skeletons. If the coral is bright white, it's still alive. Nothing else can grow on it. It won't grow.
If the coral is bright white, it's still alive. Nothing else can grow on it. It won't grow. It won't reproduce. It will surely die.
Here's a parrot fish. These are beaked fish. They eat coral. They crush coral. When the coral passes through the parrotfish, it comes out as sand.
But time has proved him right, more than once. I love reefs. It's what drives me. That's why I came here when I was 18 and studied the reef. Not because I thought it was going to disappear or because I was trying to fight climate change.
Then you bring me your urine, and we complete your biological passport. That's all there is to it. No words can describe what you're about to experience. Your body will shut down. It will fail completely.
The Justice Department loves organized conspiracies. It's their favorite charge. Whether you conspired with Mutko and others... What do you mean, conspiracy? There's been a conspiracy since 1980.
ADAMS. Play fair. Explain the collection process. The sample is provided in front of the Doping Control Officer. It's in the container.
It was incredible. A delegation of foreign scientists entered the laboratory. If there had been any substitutions and manipulations, these people would have had a front-row seat. ANTI-DOPING LABORATORY In Sochi, the laboratory was like this. Our entrance was here, and behind it, near our emergency exit, was another building.
Los Angeles is surely safer than Russia in view of recent... - Bryan! - Yes? The article is incredible. It's really well written.
And here's the jukebox. It's been broken for weeks. - I know, I know, I know. - Wait here. It could have a second life, thanks to Dr. The Fonz.
- Did you bring that suit?! It's a size 62. I wore it to my college graduation. It was in your closet!
6 000. How many have reached level 2? You can't accept their offer. Why not? Because whatever the price, it's too high.
We owe him two minutes and we're going in. Agreed? Okay. We have a filtration system that releases toxins into the air. It operates on a 30-minute cycle.
Is that all right? All right. We have a filtration system that releases toxins into the air. It operates on a 30-minute cycle. It will send the bacteria into the atmosphere.
Do you have any power? We're representatives of the three largest armies on the planet, so I guess so. Does power consent? We consent. If your consent is impure, it will kill you.
Blue dog. What were you thinking about? Tried to nail a couple of the boards down. Did it do anything? Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, which is why I bought the carpet.
Bigger problems. I felt something pop. There's a cucumber in my water. Uh-huh. Do they know it's there?
There's a cucumber in my water. Uh-huh. Do they know it's there? Uh, should I tell someone? It's there on purpose.
Anything else? Take a look at this. I mean, come on! It's like watching plants grow. He's heading for a black hole.
She brought us back from Mars. She's a murderer. Do you like your bacon sandwich? Why do you like it? Because it had parents.
I was looking at you on the screen, it took me a while to figure out who you were. There's always something scary about you, isn't there? You understand that now? It's really interesting. I thought this ship was from Earth, and full of fragile humans. But it's not from Earth, is it?
We need your TARDIS. We can't go up, but we can come down. Your TARDIS is at the bottom of the ship, isn't it? - I suppose it is. - Is it or isn't it?
I'm a father. - This is a cat, Winston. - He's my blood. I'll never understand him. I feel like I've found a forest baby, and I don't know when he's hungry or sore or afraid of the kitchen light.
I don't know. Something must have gone wrong. Something must have gone wrong. "Go wrong"? Don't you know how to use a beanstalk? You think of the place you want to go, and it takes you there.
He brought her here to kill me. I'm sorry, but your son can't be saved. He's evil. This is where she keeps the most powerful things she owns. If the globe exists, it must be here.
I was wondering about this melon. Seedless? Without parents, how did it get here? Without birth, there's no life. And if it never lived,
I need you to track the comings and goings of your zombies and report back to me. And what are you going to do with this information? Something that can't be ignored. What's that? Capture a zombie. Starve him, broadcast him live and let the world see what he becomes.
We're going to question witnesses to find out where they went because that's what we do, we're lawmen. Tonto. Hey, Seth, Mason asked me if you could check out the simulator. It's lagging.
What are you doing here? Where... where's Seth? - He's working on the simulator. - He's what? Yeah, it's idling.
Do as you please. Morse code. That's how we used to communicate. Now we have the telephone. It connects us.
The perfect superheroes are right in front of us. Shoot. Here's your exemption form, signed by your teacher. I'm putting it in your binder. It belongs to you.
I just don't get it. Why do you care so much about something you ignore most of the time? If we're going with that theory, why are you still with Mom? I love that suit on you. And it loves being on me.
The night guards are tired, half asleep. The other guards don't arrive until 30 minutes later. We've got pre-set charges and enough weapons, but we're outnumbered. And the chopper will be at maximum range. It will only be able to stay on the ground for 3 minutes.
Boss, I appreciate it, but don't forget I'm an NCIS agent. Bishop, where's that chopper? 5 kilometers away, waiting. Fuel level critical. Ready and standing by.
Whisky. The past catches up with us all the time, don't you think? The past, present and future are disasters no matter how you look at it. The second year on the job there was this guy, Peter Scarelli, who raped and murdered a ten-year-old girl. We had DNA evidence, but just before the trial, the DNA sample was corrupted in the lab, so it was inadmissible in court.
It's cooler. Is it cooler if people can't find the bar? Can you help me with these kegs? Are you sure the bar's ready to open? It looks like it still needs a lot of work.
Is it cooler if people can't find the bar? Can you help me with these kegs? Are you sure the bar's ready to open? It looks like it still needs a lot of work. No, I don't want it to look too clean.
- I'm scared. Don't come out until I get back. Is that a promise? I'm sorry, the airport's closed. There aren't any flights. - When will it reopen?
You're our last hope. - I found one! - What do you want me to do? We saw the water cat you arrived in. He can stop the Queen.
This thing wants to turn us into a space taco! I can't free myself! I'll get it to back off! We've got to keep that monster away from us. It's trying to suck us in again!
It's trying to suck us in again! The thrusters are on full blast, but it doesn't matter! Is everyone all right? I'm alive. But am I all right? - He's going after the Château!
Voltron is too precious. The universe needs you. Get ready! Ulaz has opened the parallel space from the inside. It folds in on itself.
Why would a company of technological geniuses use spores? Who cares? When are we going to see this town? Actually, the distress signal isn't coming from the city. It's coming from the forest.
We must free the people. Come on, team, we've got to take down the Cube. Shield assembly! Let's see how tough this Cube is. Did it absorb our lasers?
Let's just say: "Number 44? Your order is ready." Bon appetit. What did you do to his face? It's all cracked!
They managed to bend space-time, and it was just an outpost! The space taco. I miss it already. Yes... But imagine what their HQ will look like! It could be anything.
It's no better. You said it. Inside a black hole, the temperature rises to a millionth of a degree above absolute zero. But on the outside, it's several million degrees Celsius. Like when you put a frozen burrito in the microwave: it comes out scorching hot on the outside but still frozen inside?
Why would we go unarmed? I don't like it, Shiro. It's too late to turn back. They've sent us the route, but we've got to be quick. It'll only be open for a few vargas.
- Stay away from his face. - Is that the first rule? We just broke it. Oh, no, we didn't! What's he doing? What's he doing?
What do we have to do to get the glands to respond? Wait. "Stay away from his face." I know! You know what? If we want the glands to secrete, the weblum has to evacuate me by farting, so I attack its face and it vomits lasers.
- I'll take care of it. This crystal is getting on my nerves. Let's destroy it! I'll take care of it. Shiro, it's heading for the Castle!
- Not a fan. Stop hitting the Teludav! Princess, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about. What is it, Caron? Our plan, it's... dangerous.
Aaron: I was led to believe that the IRS had eternally persecuted Scientology and that David Miscavige was now the first person to ever have the IRS recognize Scientology as fully tax-exempt. 17800:09:39,212 -- 00:09:41,346 Scientology had previously had tax-exempt status, but the IRS had taken it away because it had discovered that L. Ron Hubbard for his personal interests. I'd never known that. And so I was watching this event, and it culminated in the announcement that the war was over.
There you are. You should have your things packed. And look for a wife elsewhere. What are you saying? That our marriage is no longer of strategic interest to England, and therefore will not take place.
She thought we could be a family again. How did it end? We're not a family anymore. I remember the day we signed the divorce papers. We look forward to that moment, then when it finally comes, we just remember that it's a failure for us that it didn't work out.
- Don't let people get confused. - All right, then. I stopped by to see where my booth would be. But I took a look and I can't find it. I'm sure it's here.
Brandon, I was really sad to hear your story, because I know you... you trusted the church, you believed in the church. And now that church has turned against you. From what I understand, there was something wrong with you. In 2012, I was going through a manic episode. And it was an episode of bipolarity undiagnosed at the time, and which I was later diagnosed with by real doctors.
We're married. Till death do us part. If you stay, it's your heart that will die. So will mine. I've wanted so much to make this marriage work, but it can't.
I felt myself leaving, but it was your voice that brought me back to life. If it hadn't been for you, I wouldn't be holding my son right now. I was mistaken. The danger isn't in being close. It's when we're apart.
We're in the middle of nowhere. Guys. The map the feds gave us isn't working. Lights out, power off. When the computer system went haywire, he had to drain the generator.
No symptoms. Nothing, I'm fine. No complaints here, except my arthritis is acting up. You don't have arthritis, Cabe. Tell that to my hand, I tried flipping the breaker and it won't budge.
Throw the bag in. Where are you? I want a meeting. Throw the bag in, or the deal's off. It's in the cart... Where's Shepherd's appointment?
In class, we'd start with a theme like a clown's nose and have fun with it. A thousand and one variations. Eventually, I realized that there was never anything simplistic, like a black square or a line. Every idea requires a specific amount of information. Sometimes you need a lot of detail and realism.
We came up with the idea of hedonistic sustainability. What if sustainability could improve our quality of life? This site is beautiful, but it was very polluted. This is where boats were painted. A large part of the budget was spent digging up the earth and then moving it. And then we thought of covering the ground with a wooden deck and leaving it as it was.
Underneath, there's a basement full of cars. So these apartments are accessed from below. So we made very colorful ceilings. When I design homes, I ask myself what I'd like, what I'd find great. For this project, we realized a dream. A building doesn't have to look like a concrete block. It can look like a man-made mountain.
Please. - Are you kidding me? It's a fork in the road. The map says go left, but this little trail looks adorable. And there's a waterfall, so... Waterfall.
May it please the court, my name is Jim Grant, I'm here on behalf of the petitioners, Village Voice Media Incorporated, Congress made a very clear choice with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and that choice was to preserve the free speech of the Internet, Congress decided to give online services immunity for their actions as to content published by a third party. The fact is, when a third party publishes online, you can't sue the site. Backpage's lawyers gave their usual speech, that they are there to protect children, and that the CDA protects them. Your client couldn't seriously say he didn't know that escort services are usually something else entirely.
- You hate them. I know, but Chelsea and I are going away for the weekend and she wants to bring her son. Isn't "no children" in the contract you make women sign - before they go out with you? - The contract says you can't have any, but it doesn't take into account the ones that existed before.
People use my first name as a verb? I wouldn't emilize. I don't want to make this a big thing, But someone I haven't mentioned Needs a little help. Are you trying the Emily thing? We're not giving Jackie money unless we know what it is.
"The three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico" . "Each was occupied by three human-shaped bodies, but only three feet high" . The case became the number one single document seen on the FBI website after publishing this. Now, the craft was more or less an oval or egg-shaped contraption. It was not saucer-shaped.
This particular profession... There were a few problems with ... Number one, getting it on the flatbed scanner to take it to Area 51. The inner craft was, uh... It has no actual levers or flight control systems that we identify as a flight control system.
Almost looked like they were naked. But they actually had a very thin but tight appropriate suit on. One was alive... Partially alive at the time it happened. They died in ... I think it was 1952.
I place a bogey around 10 o'clock here. I don't recognize the craft. I say, "Bogey, 10 o'clock." And the captain looked over there, says, "Well, we'll find out. "So he kicked it in afterburner, and we went after that and it disappeared like that.
London Control called us and asked if we would intercept a UFO over central England, at about Stonehenge, Oxford area. We're in place at about 33,000 feet, and these UFOs have dropped to about a thousand feet. We dived on that. Finally, we got up close to it, and we could see what looked like a cruise ship at sea with all the lights and everything. You got about a mile away from it and it went up into space.
A performance that exceeded even the most optimistic forecasts. You are now watching 8 News. At 11 a.m... Officially, the U.S. government ended its study of UFOs in 1969. Because it assured the public, there was no evidence the phenomena represents a threat to national security.
But, what if these unknown aircraft showed an interest in our nuclear weapons? A group of over 150 veterans, missile officers, security personnel, including many who worked on Nevada test sites say they've seen the mystery intruders on nuclear facilities. Advancing this concept, Vandenberg Air Force Base in California became the Air Force's first aerospace operations center. In fact, they photographed the UFO following the missile as it ascended into space and a bright beam on what they could have neutralized the missile.

It flew into the frame like this, and she fired a beam of light at the explosive head which is represented by my thumb here.
Which is more sensitive than the development of the hydrogen bomb before its detonation? The UFO question. Our priority, then... The subject was entirely handled in a manner from the later 40s onwards with the extraordinary secrecy around it. The event at Roswell, because it gave rise to the acquisition of materials that could be studied.
The UFO question. Our priority, then... The subject was entirely handled in a manner from the later 40s with the extraordinary secrecy around it. The event at Roswell, because it gave rise to the acquisition of materials that could be studied. It created a change in the whole national security organization, because a few weeks after this event, the CIA was formed.
I'll do it again. Yeah, why not? Right? And you know, there's a new name. It's "Unexplained Aerial Phenomenon. "
He said, "Do you know why they killed Marilyn? "Mr. President, the end Marilyn Monroe. And I said, "Well, I didn't until I came across this document. "It's a virtual death warrant, because she was found a few days later.
In response to Project Blue Book, an academic committee was formed in 1953 called the Robertson Panel. Composed of some of the most respected physicists and astronomers of the day, the Robertson Panel was charged with providing a fair and independent academic analysis of the UFO files. In this document it is stated point-blank, that the people who are on this panel are answerable to and working with the CIA, but who cannot be disclosed. And these are esteemed scientists in academic circles. He says point-blank.
We have lost a hundred years of evolution on planet Earth. A real lost century. Enormous progress was made in the 1920s as Nikola Tesla developed energy-generating technologies that could power the Earth, drawing endless free energy from the so-called "empty space" around us. So-called "empty space" isn't really empty at all. It's actually full of energy.
A truly lost century. Huge strides were made in the 1920s as Nikola Tesla developed energy-generating technologies that could power the Earth, drawing endless free energy from the so-called "empty space" around us. So-called "empty space" isn't really empty at all. It's actually full of energy. So, instead of being like some kind of calm empty lake it's more like the foam at the base of a waterfall or something.
So, 10 with 26 zeros behind it joules per cubic metre. And that's enough energy even in a cup of coffee to boil all the Earth's oceans completely off into steam. The acronym, "Unidentified Flying Object," is a deliberately obscuring term. And what it really is is an alternative energy and propulsion system.
Give me five minutes. - Closed or open? - Closed. - Have you corrected the press release? - It's on my desk.
- No, it's not. - We just need to recalibrate. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. Listen to your body. It will tell you when to stop.
That's why I'm surprised by your refusal. I cannot accept without the agreement of my advisor. There are 112 people on this ship. 113, if you count Mr. Peterson. She'll sink in 20 to 32 hours.
You have 30 seconds, but first, is Mr Grayson your superior? Yes, I'm sorry. Tom thinks that you and Stamper were involved in Zoe Barnes' death. He has a phone that belonged to Miss Barnes with only one outgoing call: you.
And I realized, Claire, that you have to think and act in a totally different way. It's no longer about living in the White House... it's about running the White House. Can a politician aim higher than the presidency? The real power isn't here. It lies beyond, but it works in concert with the presidency.
If you get him a job, he'll live here forever! He'd get an apartment. Did he ever have his own apartment? Yes. Did he have a metal toilet next to the bed?
It was an accessory maker who pulled on the laces to tighten them and make them look as if they were tightening themselves. We'd always wanted to make one that actually worked. This is the first working prototype of the Back to the Future shoe. It dates back to 2007, when? The motor! It was bigger than it is today.
Instagram could become a triangle. The more I work, the more introspective I become in my practice. That's the case right now. I ask myself why I'm working with this person, what this project can bring me, and what I can bring to it. And that's interesting. The word "show" implies that we're revealing something. It's not about finding it.
What's there to show if you've never searched or found? Tomorrow evening, it's off to Belgium in a truck. I've been watching videos of babies playing with shape boxes. There's a triangle, a circle and a square, and you have to put them in the corresponding holes. It's incredible to watch. When babies discover something, their bodies produce dopamine. That's why human beings love novelty. And a baby, whether he manages to put the shape in the hole or not, each time it's a new sensation that comes with a reward.
Leah: I knew Debbie Cook as a captain of the Flag Service Organization, which, for Scientologists, is the heart and center of Scientology. What happened to Debbie was, she was a victim of her own success. Her organization had, uh, an annual budget. I think it was $100 million, $150 million.
So Weckler didn't commit suicide. He was murdered. I got an invitation to the zombie rally tomorrow night. We're going to capture a zombie. Let the world see what he becomes!
Hang up the phone! We don't need any help. I don't need your help deciding when we need help! Raj, what's going on? I was heating up some milk for Halley, and I thought it smelled funny, so I checked the date on the bottle, and it says "Flerdi."
You've got a great job. I make good money. You make more than I do. You don't have a house yet, but your place is great. It's bigger than mine.
Someone within my organization. Someone with access to an offshore account that was used to fund recent attacks against me. 11 people had access to this account. Last night, I invited all 11 to dinner to confront them. What happened next I can only remember in bits and pieces. The restaurant, what it looked like, not where it was.
I need to connect to the Black Lion. Kolivan, I'm in. Now what? You have to reboot the system using Thace's codes. It'll be off for a doboche.
It was a trap. Find the spy. I'm going to put an end to this. Now, listen. The gravity generator will soon run out of power. If it cuts out, we'll be totally visible.
Maybe we can't get to you, but we can get to your friend. Let him go! So here's lesson number 1. I know Shaw's got your back, but I'm in charge. In two weeks, my package will be coming through here and you're going to make sure it gets to me safely.
So, me... waving a sign in front of city hall, I can't make it stop in North Lawndale, Cicero or anywhere else in Chicago. All it takes is one leak, one spark and one boom. - The death convoys. - Exactly. How else should oil get where it's going?
Here's what we're going to do. If at any time my presence makes you uncomfortable, makes you feel like you can't quite get to the romantic, intimate place you need to get to say the word, I'm out. Is that okay? Like a password? I say the word, whatever it is, and you...
Weave it in. We have a homicide. Also, happy Valentine's Day. How's the hotel? Crowded.
If we ever sell organs. I don't mind. The purpose of this bunker is to make games, but we'd have to... Jackpot! This puzzle is still packed, so it must be complete.
That's a very good point. - Thank you very much. - Why don't you find a big piece of wet tree bark and hold it for me. You're going to hold it between the fuel line and the undercarriage of the wagon. We need to insulate the heat.
The bubble is threatened by a hundred kilos of debris and sparks from power lines. Yes, and if the bubble bursts... Your sterile environment will be flooded with pollen, dust, branches, leaves, pieces of ceiling and roof, all of which contain bacteria. And it would die within minutes. You can't clean up debris with the power line on, but you can't turn off the power, because its HEPA filter will stop working.
My companion, my equal! I'm sorry I threw the garbage at you. That's all right. It wasn't nice. There could have been a rat. And babies in wigs...
I think this space has great potential. We could hang lights from the ceiling, put up some trees. It could become a really magical place. I think it's possible. Don't you feel a draft? There must be a window open. And look at the walls...
That thing... was draining my magic. Why would it do that? Because there's no magic in this heart It's just a worthless piece of glass. For it to work, it needs someone magical... My magic.
This is what recycling looks like in the '50s. Sorry you're not having fun with Wyatt and Lucy. - What's wrong? - Your eye. - It's red.
- Your eye. - Your eye. - It's red. - I rubbed it. No, it's like really spaghetti sauce red.
I haven't seen him in a few years. So where do you keep these books? He used to work for my brother, man. I ain't got nothing to do with his ass. If this was a robbery, I'd be looking at Ricky Marscak's crew.
- Talk about it! I understand. I agree with you. The problem is the writing. What about the jingle? Here it is.
It's not every day that newspapers say, "From old to better." They also said, "After the black, the glory." "Badger to hero." "From ugly to handsome vest." They Photoshopped me a vest. There's better news.
I get the feeling that all this attention - it's made you forget our purpose. - No! The tigers. No, the toilet rat. It'll disappear.
Hello? I've been to see Raina. I went to see Raina. She wasn't there. Her apartment is full of anti-American propaganda, plans for a shopping mall, bomb components. It looks exactly like yours did last year.
It's an Euler disk. A physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy and kinetic energy. Look at you, watching sports. We bet to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disc can spin. Its weight and thinness, with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time.
I've represented the basic topics of conversation and who you can discuss them with. I call these circles "Privacy Zones". Don't Google unless you want to see images of genitals. This circle contains only you and me. It represents the subjects we share only with each other. Details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits.
Have you tried talking to someone? Get some help? Yeah, we went to a therapist, and you know what he said? Divorce. You went to the wrong therapist. It's not about the therapist.
I'd do anything for you, son. Now, tell me where your heart is. I... I can't. I'm sorry, son. I just don't know where it is.
It could be decisive in moving on to the last new one. He moves on to the first bonus obstacle, the Bungee Beds. Petit, I'm sorry. There are three hanging beds to get over without falling. On this obstacle, you mustn't rush.
It has to stay in the center. Let's see what happened. It looks like he landed on his side. When he tried to center himself, he lost his balance. Bungee Beds are ruthless. Taeho Kwon's failure on the Bungee Beds cost him 40 points, but he had enough to take 1st place and eliminate Brazilian Marcel Stevanin.
And it's like everything is in slow motion. Wait, something's wrong. There's a knife... and blood. Who's got the knife? It's in my hands.
Please. We've never met. We've never met. Madam Secretary, this is all a terrible misunderstanding. I read your file on the way here, and your name sounds familiar. It's on a plaque, isn't it?
They said they'd protect me. I want to do it. I want to do it. It happened outside Groveton around 2:15 this afternoon. Residents as far as Rose Hill say they felt the blast when a truck, loaded with a deadly bomb drove into a field, where it exploded.
Here, two floors underground, you should have all the privacy you need. Can anyone tell me what this is? A canvas on which we can paint our hopes and dreams? It's a smart board. It's a list to fill in with the names and faces of our collaborators.
From there, I realized that the hero is the person who pushes us to rethink our sense of morality and responsibility as citizens of the world. Plato addresses the powerful and the power of the subjects he chooses to photograph. Human Rights Watch contacted me. They said: "Burma is under the yoke of a brutal military regime that nobody talks about. Can you do something?" My work was published. And it went everywhere.
Design isn't just visual. It's a thought process. It's a skill. Ultimately, design is a tool for improving our humanity. It provides a framework for our lives.
To get ideas. With environmental graphics, I was able to design spaces in the physical world at a time when the most interesting designs were digital. I worked with large lettering to create a sense of space while helping people find their way around. Graphics exist beyond screens. It influences reality.
Roger comes out. Hey Big Rog, got a minute? We really need to talk about your palm tree. Sorry, I don't have time. Maybe you haven't noticed, but the tree... it's dropping its fruit, the little berries, on my brand-new purchase... totally refurbished...
What did you do to my vase? Well, it was an accident. An accident? Adam, I got it from my grandmother. He's irreplaceable.
What's going on? My skin... - it burns. - What's wrong? What's happening to you? - The gel, it's burning my skin.
I think you're spending way too much energy asking questions when you should be treading water. I thought we were going to perfect my instincts. I already know how to swim. This exercise isn't about what you already know. It's about pushing your limits so far that you'll have to rely on your instincts instead of what you've learned.
Maybe I'll try it with a little more. Ninja blasters! Hey, guys. I upgraded my holo projector! It'll create more powerful holo clones than ever.
So, what do you think? Frankie? I think you ruined my science project. I'm about to ruin a lot more than that. I'm going to destroy that thing before it does any more damage.
Yes, it's super risky, but we can't get out of it anymore. Look, it's going to be scary when you decide to do it, but you're going to have to do it sometime. Why not do it today? It's a nice plane. Yes, it is.
Thank you Todd. You're welcome. Would anyone else like to say a few words? I'd like to. Every time hope comes into my life, it dies.
So we're going to die because there's no wind. We stopped a tornado once. Can't we make a little wind? No, but you can take some weight off. A 17 km/h wind should power the winch as long as it doesn't have to carry much cargo.
The problem is, the capsule will crash in about 20 hours, and with that, everything they've worked for will be lost. I assume you mean meteorite, not asteroid. Meteorites are asteroids in the atmosphere before they hit the Earth. But this asteroid is in a protected capsule so it doesn't burn up as it passes through the atmosphere. So it remains in an asteroid state.
Meteorites are asteroids that enter the atmosphere before hitting the Earth. But this asteroid is in a protected capsule so that it doesn't burn up as it passes through the atmosphere. So it remains in an asteroid state. So it's not a meteorite. It passes through the atmosphere anyway, so by definition, it's a meteorite in an asteroid state.
So it's not a meteorite. It still passes through the atmosphere, so, by definition, it's a meteorite in an asteroid state. I'm going to send you both to your asteroid states if you don't let go. So, why is this rock so important? It's rich in palladium.
It's for when he's tired. Concentrate. I suppose you're suggesting that the helicopter goes up to an intercept point with the space rock and we use the arm to grab the capsule. But won't the pebble crash into the helicopter? And even if it doesn't, how do you catch something falling from space at millions of kilometers an hour?
But won't the rock crash into the helicopter? And even if it doesn't, how do you catch something falling from space at millions of kilometers an hour? It won't crash because gravity will pull the capsule down. And it will only go up to 200 km/h, terminal velocity. So, if we cut the chopper's engine at a given moment, it will be in free fall alongside the capsule.
It sounds like a threat. In our country, executive power is exercised by the military. President Korsovich was elected from among the three candidates shortlisted by General Savic. It's an illusion of democracy. I pray, as the country moves forward, that it will become freer, like the USA.
They must think we're trying to run a re-entry simulation. Well, just turn it off! This isn't a desk fan. It's a 5,000-horsepower turbine. It takes a 15-minute cycle to slow it down.
An elastic rope, with just one hand! Look at this! Can you see it? Felipe is one of the best climbers in the world. This obstacle might be a little harder for him, as it makes less use of his climbing skills.
- He's done it! - Go for it! Let's see how Felipe Camargo finishes level 3. He's on the first tube, and already seems to be struggling. This should be a challenge for him, since it relies mainly on his climbing agility.
It looks easier than it is. I'm too heavy. That's an added handicap. A guy ten kilos lighter would do better. Student model Nam Vo from Germany is in second place with 180 points, which means he's on the hot seat. One competitor remains for level 3, and that's Korean parkour specialist Taeyoon Kim.
"All right!" I'm in my room: "What's it like outside, chicken?" "I'd love to grow up outdoors, but... gangs." Is this chicken expensive, because I'm paying for the hobbies it had when it was alive?
I'm in my room: "What's it like outside, chicken?" "I'd love to grow up outdoors, but... gangs." Is this chicken expensive, because I'm paying for the hobbies it had when it was alive? This chicken costs $20 a kilo, because he played the cello and surfed.
Rappers rain champagne, I rain penicillin. I'm like, "Here you go, for everybody." I was at Bloomingdale's, in the sale section. I can afford to buy the stuff on sale there. I'm at Bloomingdale's and I see a bag I like. But there's no price on it.
Nor did they promise Unger the 50% he demanded. The Academy is loath to authorize such expenditure without meticulous scrutiny. So you killed Unger and stole the newspaper. What did I do? You arranged for it to fall into the hands of Farhan Al-Asmari.
Si. Mr. Al-Asmari has taken out millions in gold. He's proud of it. It can't be true. I've read everything about the Santa Leticia, including the archives of the Antilles in Seville. There is no historical document to confirm that she sank laden with gold.
In England. That was the Brexit. They passed it off as an economic thing. In truth, it was just people wanting their country back. It hadn't gone anywhere.
Even on a physical level, the vagina is one of the strongest things in existence. Virtually indestructible. Plenty of men here have told the story of how they overcame the vagina. You know what they say? They're lying. The vagina's owner may have given you the impression that you've defeated the vagina, but it's alive and well, my friends.
Lots of men here have told how they overcame the vagina. You know what they say? They're lying. The vagina hater may have given you the impression that you defeated the vagina, but it's alive and well, my friends. When people say that, I say, "Do you know how impressive the vagina is? Do you know how strong it is?"
When people say that, I say, "Do you know how impressive the vagina is? Do you know how strong it is?" Men have been trying to oppress it for a long time because the vagina is terribly powerful. You realize that human beings come out of a vagina. Human beings come out of it and it continues to function as intended.
See how impressive it is? I don't know if I'm the only one. You know what I mean? A human being comes out of the vagina. And it continues to function. It continues to function after a human comes out.
A human being emerges from the vagina. And it continues to function. It continues to function after a human comes out. You say it's weak? A human comes out of the vagina. You only have to sit on a penis the wrong way for it to break.
I'll see what I can do. But if you really want to be sure what we're dealing with, you should try to get your hands on another bone fragment. Could you analyze it? Noelani could tell us whether it's animal or human. And how old it is.
Isn't it? I found it at your place, Charles. There was a little locker in the back, empty. I kept a newspaper in it. It had the position of this container.
Beverly thinks that subconsciously, I see my old room as an escape. Does that bother you? Yes. I don't appreciate unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. It should tell me everything.
I think you're the kind of person who likes to have a backup plan. That's true. I am. Did you know I figured out the order in which I'm going to eat all my friends in case of the apocalypse? You've got to stop messing with your brain so much. It's not a good influence.
She's kidding! Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where's my purse? My phone and my wallet - they're in my bag. - It's right there.
I'm trying. Wait a minute. Let me see your phone. Let me see your phone. Why? It's possible It's possible it tracks every place you've been.
Have you learned anything? Sloth babies cling to their mother's body for almost a year. I go back to work after only four months, I've learned that I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here. I get it, but this sloth is kind of cute. It's not just the sloth.
I hope we've shown you how vaccines are good for the world. They're not just for the good of others. But also for your own health. I have to put on this unusual gown. The one with the black stripes. Personally, I'm concerned about one individual.
Anyone can do it. Because the flesh of your feet absorbs fire energy without burning. - What's that? - That's brilliant. And the second thing is wood, when it burns, it doesn't conduct heat well.
I wish it weren't so, but it is. - Come on over here. - Dad, if you don't mind, I have to go to the recycling center. It closes in an hour.
- Is it ready? - Just a minute. There you go. Here we go. Here we go. It moved.
In front of them, Capra announced the winner, John Ford, who was elsewhere, fishing on his boat. Wyler returned empty-handed, once again. ROOSEVELT PRAISES AMERICAN CINEMA! The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences listens to an exhilarating radio address by the President, live from the White House. We have seen American cinema rise in power throughout the world. It reflects our civilization to people around the world, as well as the goals, aspirations and ideals of a free people, and of freedom itself.
I was put behind a desk. It was terrible. I wanted to film on the battlefield. In the end, he was sent to one of the most remote fronts. He was sent to an outpost in the Aleutian Islands, near the Bering Strait. It was the closest place to Japan. But absolutely nothing happened there. He and the other soldiers lived day after day, waiting for a letter or playing cards.
When newspapers echoed government pressure, the army was forced to release the film in its entirety. For the film's sake, they used the same tactics with the army and its representatives as they had with the studio bosses. But Mellett was right. Report from the Aleutians is too long to go before a Hollywood feature. Exploited on its own, it failed to find its audience.
After Wyler's departure from the project, Capra entrusted the film to another director, but retained the original screenwriter, Carlton Moss. Over time, Moss became the backbone of the project. He brings the necessary perspective, as well as a strong commitment. He stands up for what he considers important about what the film should represent. When the documentary was released, the black community was concerned that it would only reinforce the stereotypes that are omnipresent in Hollywood films.
Quote: "From time to time, illustrated newspapers show how a Negro became a lawyer, a teacher, even a minister. Middle-class American degenerates don't see this as a sin against reason. Yet it is criminal folly to train a half-macaque in order to make people believe he is a lawyer." This book was written 20 years ago. The project it set out to achieve has become reality.
Then it was the colonels' turn. They all left, one after the other. I finished alone. I said to myself: "The big idiots." The army hated the film. They felt it would damage the morale of the troops and the men who hadn't fought yet.
VOICE OF JOHN WAYNE ...but when he returned, he saw things differently. Ford was still in uniform, but with the approval of the Navy, he was back in Hollywood, working for MGM. He directed The Sacrificed, his first feature film in five years. From Midway he wanted to make a film about the sailors who ran the torpedo launchers in the Pacific after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He wanted to tell a story, not of victory, but of sacrifice.
"You're not able to salute like someone who's been to war? "I think it was very difficult for Wayne. Ford probably realized what he'd just done and burst into tears. This film was as much about therapy as it was about filmmaking. It marked the beginning of a long process of exploration into the real impact the war had had in America.
I've been making films for 40 years. And there's one I'm particularly attached to, because I made it just after the war. Most of my films were based on invented stories that didn't involve me personally. But since I'd served in the war, when I came back I made The Best Years of Our Lives. This film gave me a great deal of satisfaction, because it helped to change society at the time.
And there's one I'm particularly attached to, because I made it just after the war. Most of my films were based on made-up stories that didn't involve me personally. But since I'd served in the war, when I came back I made The Best Years of Our Lives. The film gave me a great deal of satisfaction, because it helped change the society of the time. It helped veterans to be better understood.
Bringing back memories? I try to get rid of them. I've been watching The Best Years of Our Lives at least once a year for the last 30 years, and I've been introducing it to others so that they can see it through their eyes. Upon its release, the film was considered a masterpiece of American Social Realism. It was hailed by the critics and became the second highest-grossing film in history.
Look over there. It's a house. Let's go back to the van and have a look. I don't see the van. There it is.
All right, all right, thanks, Rick. I owe you one. Mexican authorities found an abandoned truck last week that matches the one Reid described. It was abandoned two states over. It belonged to Victor Flores?
Voice mail? Lucado, pick up the phone! Maybe try Jeremy again. How long before this thing eats through the trash to get out? I'm sure if I go downstairs, it'll eat its way through me.
Do you know how to exorcise something bad, Earp or not? Lots of fire. Viscous skin. Signs of an exoskeleton. Whether it was growing around him or the specimen has recently molted remains to be seen.
Sounds like my kind of Wednesday. Girls, this stuff is starting to dry out and crack my skin, so I gotta go. We destroyed a dozen nests, which destroyed the main shell thingy. But we checked out what looked like its vital organs. It was more than egg yolk, so we're pretty sure it's dead.
Uhhh, wrap this thing up and, uh, well, Jeremy knows what to do. She... She didn't have a question. Yes, I do. Did blowing up all those demon eggs make you wet? Well, uh, I like my job, but it hasn't offered me a meal in a long time.
If you pass out, land on your back. I want people to see my podcast T-shirt. Okay. As a human being myself, I must warn you that this is extremely dangerous. I thought the name Wayne was my superpower, but it clearly means nothing.
That was super funny, man. President West! Did you get my budget? Yes. It's quite impressive.
Let's keep our cool. We'll think of something. For now, just sit tight, guys. Not sure that's an option. Guys, the fog that was outside is now inside.
We'll think of something. For now, just sit tight, guys. Not sure that's an option. Guys, the fog that was outside is now inside. It's coming in fast.
For now, just sit tight, guys. Not sure that's an option. Guys, the fog that was outside is now inside. It's coming in fast. He'll be down in no time.
Guys, the fog that was outside is now inside. It's coming in fast. It'll be down in no time. No, we won't have to wait for the fog to come down to us. Once it's passed through the ducts leading to the wall vents, it'll fill the room in seconds.
Fetch these items for me. Sal, help me mix all our earth into one bucket. The melting point of aluminum is 660 degrees, but the melting point of your hand is much lower. It's not a high-end mask. It only blocks minor fumes from chemical experiments.
Let's hope her friend is still out there. We've got a signal for Denise's phone. She's at 1227 Langdon Street. Strong signal. It's not moving.
What the..." "If you blow into the balloon and it's negative, I'll give you back your car keys." I went... "Get it out, let's have some fun." I blew into the thing. It made a noise, a beep. I went...
And, parallel to all this, there was a small government agency that started testing drugs to control people's brains. They screwed up. They tested them for 12 years. But instead of controlling the brain, they opened the mind. There was LSD, mescaline, stuff like that.
No, it's the right plan. Just keep digging. But, in his opinion, there's no proof of all the offshore accounts, either. He earns and spends well on his government salary. If he's hiding money, He's sitting untouched under a mattress.
Wonderful. I have such a taste For the little snacks from the bar car, The crackers and cheeses, the sausages. It's like camping. Try the pepper over there. It's surprisingly good.
Just a... a rolled-up carpet or tarp. But when they put it in the back of the van, it... That's okay. Take your time. He unrolled, and I saw a foot.
- And they're all off limits? - Mm-hmm. Now we're getting somewhere, Georgie. You found Krilov. The equipment he's using, EEG Dr. Orchard, it's pinging the manufacturer's server.
I know, I know, I know. Hold it firmly. Firmly! Is it okay? Is it broken?
Give me the screwdriver. It's my screwdriver. It's mine. Will you take instructions? This is my drill and it's mine and you just stole it.
Put them online! Give me the code... or I'll kill them one by one. Give me the code. Your plan is flawed. It's based on stupidity and cowardice.
All done. The glider's just been launched. How long until... How long until... We have 30 minutes until it hits the capitol.
And now I... Now what? I know how you feel, Patterson, believe me. This job takes everything from us. But it also gives it back.
It's written up there. What about the original? I gave it to the other inspector, Woods. I never heard back. And when I asked the police for the file last year, they said it had disappeared.
Do you mind if I listen? If it'll get you both out of here. A holosystolic murmur to the heart and the lungs are congested. And in French? It means your heart has been compensating for your failing valve for too long, and it can't go on like this, so fluid is backing up into the lungs.
He couldn't use a bedpan? He almost threw it at me. - I'm here if you need me. - I don't. So, Mr. Halstead, the angio results reveal that your heart has been stressed for so long because of the valve failure that it's pretty much stopped everything.
- They're doing amazing things with fruit now. Don hates fruit. He says it's like eating babies off a tree. And it's not me he needs to feel appreciated by. It's Lisa. Wait, what if I send Don a gift basket and say it's from Lisa.
We're about to turn it on. Rex and I did our best, but it's Sabine's baby. So it should work. There are a lot of modifications and fuses. We didn't test it when Sabine was still here, so if it overheats, we probably won't be able to fix it.
Let's go, let's go! The shield's overheating. They've had enough. Cease fire. It held!
Your friends' distress amuses you. I've been in your shoes, and the rebels emerged victorious from certain defeat. We're not the same, Kallus, and these rebels are about to find out. Our shield has taken quite a beating. It won't survive another attack.
You and Sabine saved the day. Kanan, we lost everything. I understand you're feeling down, but I've learned to see things differently. There's a future for us, where we're all free. But it's up to us to make it happen.
It turns out that they own a fictitious company that is a subsidiary of the company that hired them in the first place. They created a false reference. So the floor was more of a heat conductor than we thought. We know the fire has gone into another vein. The problem is how to stop it before it reaches the nuclear repository?
It must have been a cave. The path is blocked. We can't get past the sand trap. And we can't stop the fire. The fire crosses the sand pit in less than eight minutes, and then we have to get to the nuclear depot.
Walter, for the sake of your lives and for the love of all the skinny nerdy little kids who can't imagine having a super-hot wife, go through the damn rockslide! The rocks are too heavy to move, so... But we can use this old coal cart to hit the rockslide like a battering ram. This thing is 80 years old. There's no way it's going to break that wall.
We could leave him here and just send him pictures of the reception. I'd be happy to sacrifice my seat at the head table so you could get to the wedding. He's not at the head table. My head is starting to spin, I can only assume that carbon monoxide from the fire burning above me is making its way through the cracks in the ceiling. The carbon monoxide will kill Walter once it reaches the critical dose of his air supply!
That'd be me. Good one! What happened to Gosling's costume? I lost too much weight. It's too big.
Do you see the cut line? There are lots of them. Just a minute. We don't have a minute, not even half a minute. The shrapnel pierced the hydraulic fluid reservoir. It's emptying.
The door's jammed. you okay? Oh, my God. The cockpit was ripped from the plane in the crash. There it is!
I've said too much. No, you said too little. Are you okay, honey? Remember when you said my brain didn't know I was in so much pain? It does now.
Sly is monitoring their radio conversation. How soon will he be close to us? I made a rough nautical chart, based on the data Sly could translate. We think the ship will be in our line of sight in 8 min. So we have to be sure it sees us.
Paige, Walter, we've got a big problem. What is it? What's going on? The wind picked up and shifted. It's blowing smoke horizontally instead of vertically. If the boat passes in seven minutes they'll never see the signal if it doesn't go high enough.
On the radio, a weather front in the Pacific... Oh, you think so? We already know. It's disrupting the smoke. We don't think the boat will be able to see it when it passes in a few minutes.
We don't think the boat will be able to see it when it passes in a few minutes. We don't have a few minutes. I heard them say they were correcting the ship's course to avoid rough seas. I've done the math. The ship should pass the island in 90 seconds, and it will only be in sight for two minutes after that.
Are you going to light a rocket inside him? He's not a Halloween pumpkin. Walter's right. The caustic nature of the chemical can cauterize because it denatures proteins. As soon as it comes into contact with the bleeding organic matter, it will act instantly, closing the wound.
Are you stressed? Am I stressed? Are you kidding me? I can feel my psoriasis festering! It's spreading all over my body.
"Just over there." There are 50 men over there. - Call this burner phone. - Got it. Got it. It's ringing.
The way this guy's been avoiding us, it's clear to me that he's had some training, but since he's not in the system, that means he's been erased from it; he's a ghost. The crime lab just unlocked this prepaid phone purchased with Khalid's credit card. They found these images.
I'll stay on the floor until he's old enough to pick me up. Yes, good point. The other day, I dropped a strawberry and just pushed it with my foot under the fridge. We can't have another baby. You know he'd find it and eat it!
But that's not the design of a behaviorist, is it Toby? What are you talking about? You. Turning my bunker into a house of lies. I did the hydrodynamics from memory, but it should be able to sail.
He'll create a magnetic pulse. but since the chromium levels in the battery are low, Ralph will have to compensate by building a much larger charge, which could cause the electromagnet to explode Good god. Sacrebleu. I know what it does and I think it might explode.
How does a plane get there so fast? Whatever research station took charge on the magnetic disturbance must have diverted a monsoon-tracking plane it was already in the area. shh This engine is a small, high-altitude flying accessory. It's not looking for people.
We've got another problem. This suspect just sent out a Stuxnet worm. None of us know what it is. It's a malicious virus. It infects programmable commands.
Were you raised in a prison? Van, did you know I'm the only vice president here who doesn't have a real office? Emily, you thrive in open space. You're like a tropical fish that lives in the reef, but if you took that fish out and gave it its own office... - it would die.
Who is Marie Tooth? Three surnames. Doctors who have described the neurological syndrome known as CMT. It attacks the peripheral nervous system, arms, legs, hands, feet. It is degenerative, with symptoms worsening over time.
Come on. My God, Kennedy. Call 911 for Christ's sake! When Daddy Warbuck's little girl gets beat up, do they call in the cavalry? I'd be happy to put my ass back in the bed from whence it came.
Add a little ecstasy. Thank God, stupidity is not a defense. - You forgot your phone. - Thank you. I left it on my desk. It was on my desk.
I've earned everything I own. I was the youngest person to go to the Watergate grand jury. During the hearings, there was this huge board where you could see everyone who had touched the secret fund money. It said, "Gordon Liddy, McCord, Segretti." At the very bottom, it said "Stone".
He'd been through a lot, but he's tenacious. That's his greatest quality. That's what my tattoo means. It's not an ideological statement. It reminds me that when you fall down, you have to get back up and fight, not give up.
Trump! Trump! We're going to Washington. To do what? We're going to drain the swamp. It's corrupt.
Their reconciliation is the funniest thing in the world. Just seeing my mom cry, "I just want you to know... I didn't think you gave your pekpek to everyone." "No, Mom. It's right here, it's the same one you gave me."
He was swimming, I was outside the pool watching him swim. He got out of the pool and said to me, word for word, "This pubic hair tickles my butt." He was talking about his one pubic hair. Just one, so long it tickles his ass.
Hi, honey." "Hi, honey. Why didn't you text me?" "I didn't know where my cell phone was." There's a square shape here.
I killed four babies last night. It was crazy! Either one or the other. People say abortion should be legal, safe and rare. Why should it be rare if it's legal?
It was crazy! Either one or the other. People say abortion should be legal, safe and rare. Why should it be rare if it's legal? If it's legal, it's... It sucks.
Either one or the other. People say abortion should be legal, safe and rare. Why should it be rare if it's legal? If it's legal, it's... It's a pain in the ass. If it has to be rare, then it's killing babies.
- Are you leaving too? - Yes, darling, I am. And you should go to Perth. Your future's not here. It's with Nash and Joshie...
I'm sorry, Mr. Channing, it was an accident... - Get the hell away from me! - It was an acci... This workshop is a disaster. It's endangering the guards and the women.
My stomach is very disappointed. Go to the bottom of the hole! Wait, Eep! What would a flemmargot do? Or rather, what wouldn't he do?
Do you still have your cell phone? Do you have something to report? I found this on the floor. You should take a look. There are some rather interesting photos.
It's a family affair. All right, then. I'd like to ask you a question. You pick up a stray dog off the street and feed it well. He becomes very fat and his hair is shiny.
I think there's a guy in Sweden. I don't think we can let Katie lie to us without consequences, okay? She needs to know that we're smarter than she is. I propose this compromise. I won't search her phone, but it has a built-in tracking app, so we can activate it and see where she goes.
Hm? Yes, exactly. Except we'll have lots of questions. Oh, and, uh, by the way, your phone. It was in Don's pocket.
Exactly. Except we'll have lots of questions. Oh, and, uh, by the way, your phone. It was in Don's pocket. Any idea how it got there?
Maybe I don't mean more time, but another time. I'm particularly tense. A few people came in for quick interviews and all I wanted was for them to leave quickly. Our appointment won't be a quick interview. I prefer the reporter, knowing what he represents.
- Yes, it forms little squares... - It's shiny. What I liked... When I went to the beach, to the river... When it flows into the sea, it digs into the sand.
- DO HOUSES FLY? - I LEARNED... For us, a bird flies without a precise goal. But that's the bird's purpose. It's looking for something.
- I LEARNED... For us, a bird flies without a precise goal. But that's the bird's purpose. It's looking for something. It's not just flying around.
As far as we're concerned, a bird flies aimlessly. But that's the bird's purpose. It's looking for something. He's not just flying around. No, he's going somewhere.
IN FACT, IT TURNS. NOW SHE'S GOING IN CIRCLES. OH, NO, I'M SURROUNDED. Rafa, did I leave the screen at your place? Is it here?
But Annie thinks we need a new car. Which we do. So you want to sell me your sonar? You're working on Loch Ness. It'll pay for itself in no time.
- Leighton? Don't you see the way he looks at you? How could he not be attracted to you? What do you think the monster's doing here? Well, he's nocturnal.
- Are you off the case? - What do you think? Where did the heart come from? - What's wrong with the heart? - It's human.
I'm late for class. He's with a patient. I text him. - You have your own cell phone. - It was my mother's.
Step back. Has the suspect been arrested? What was the motive for the crime? SUSPECT ARRESTED FOR ATTRACTION PARK REMOVAL. He must have surfaced with last night's deluge.
It's a nice word, but it's a disgusting thing. And here's what bothers me about it: the risk-reward ratio... it's not good. And I know the reward, I read that somewhere. Apparently, by removing oxygen, or something like that, you increase your orgasm until it's one and a half times more intense than the one you had on Thursday two weeks ago.
I'm like, "Thanks, you're cool too. I love you." "I love you most of all!" "I love you too." "Remember yesterday when you threw me that bone, and it was made of rubber?"
He was in front of a mirror, combing his hair. The light went out. We ducked our heads and tried not to giggle. But very soon, we heard a scream. I'd say it came from over there.
I'd say it came from there. That's where Sister Cathy and Sister Russell lived. It was a man's voice. It was loud, resonant... It was a cry full of emotion, full of anger. It was obvious to us that something violent was going on.
Magnus was there and reiterated that what I had done was so awful that it would be some time before he knew if God could forgive me. If I gave up such sinful and immoral behavior, there would be room for God to fill me with the Holy Spirit, and I would be forgiven. What he was doing was "sacramental", with quotation marks. He spoke of his enjoyment as a Eucharist. He made all kinds of crucifix signs with his sex, as if it were... sacred.
"We'd like Dr. Spitz to come on the scene with us." And what did I do when I got there? I observed the corpse. I said to the police photographer, "Why don't you take a picture of the body as it is here?
I had no idea. I was the guardian of the totem pole. I had to make sure our village wasn't in danger. It's horrible. Zambezi is nothing but ashes, but it's still my home, and my sacred obligation is to protect it.
There are a lot of things I don't understand at all. Without the totem, I had to make deals with those who covet its power. When I found out you had it, I had to find it. The totem sensed me. It woke up for you.
Without the totem, I had to make deals with those who coveted its power. When I discovered you had it, I had to find it. The totem sensed me. It woke up for you. Alas, it also bound itself to you. There's only one way to sever the link.
Based on its location along the M'Changa River and its inscriptions, we believe it is one of the five original totem poles worn by Zambezi chiefs over a thousand years ago. But I still don't have any magical powers. That said, it's a testament to the ancient civilization of Zambezia. The totem pole will be displayed in the gem hall of the Detroit Museum. It's a gift to this beautiful city, where it will remain forever.
I know where it is. But if you want, I'll go with you. I can't believe an ancient, overpowering totem pole is gathering dust in a Star City shop window. The water totem traveled far and wide before being auctioned off in your country. It arrived here 2 months ago.
Once I have this, everything will stop. I promise you that. Now's not the time. I found a chant in the archives. It says that every totem has a center.
I was about to give up, but I stayed. He looks at my throat and says, "We're going to the ER." I had an abscess at the top of my... trachea, which is where you breathe. Either the abscess was going to grow a millimeter, I wouldn't be able to breathe and I'd die. Or it would explode. As it was full of poison, I would die.
Twitter was going crazy. At 8:05pm, I tweeted, "Why is my dog's poop cold?" I'll remind you that I had scheduled this tweet. That's how much I liked it.
Flashforward. One year later. George and Gil are on New York One and on cloud nine. Gil can't get up because his body is made of polenta. That is, everything holds together, but he's limp and soaks up the tomato sauce.
- Thank you for your time. Have you seen my igloo? Do you like it? - Not bad, eh? - It's great.
It can be chilly in Antarctica. As winter sets in, the ice expands and the continent doubles in size. It doubles in size! In this sense, cold creates matter. It is present in space.
Have you ever read this book? LE MESSIE INDULGENT BY YUZU HANAKI Is this his latest book? Yes. It sold a million copies four days after its release.
Do you have a history with him? I just don't like him. His first novel disgusted me. It did? If you say so, it must have been horrible.
No offense, but none of you could have written a novel like this. So, what do you think? Should we read this novel and then confer? If you insist. Even if it's a novel none of us could have written, if it's not interesting, it won't win the prize.
There you are, Mr. Moriguchi. What have you been up to? I've done nothing. Mr. Michima's novel was well received. That's all there is to it. It'll probably sell well.
Isn't it great? Lots of people read it. Yeah. Aren't you happy? It's not selling because it's interesting.
Okay, here. Gently. Gently. Cat? Come here. Come on. We took it because we thought it was yours.
Alteans. We've only got one clue to what's going on, and it's floating right there. Hello? Anybody home? This place gives me the creeps. Do you feel like you're on a haunted ship too, or is it just me?
Form the sword. Keep Voltron busy until the cargo ship is out of range. Don't be fooled. His sword stroke is fatal. He's too fast.
Infiltrate aboard a galra cruiser? You just escaped from one galra ship and you want to go back aboard another? You're crazier than me, who applied to spend five years on an ice cube! Is it possible or not? The cruiser is currently within range, but it will soon switch to hyperdrive.
Honerva has really mellowed you, my friend. I never thought I'd see the great warrior and emperor Zarkon married, and to an Altean alchemist at that. You're still working hard, Honerva. Thanks for the gift. Allura loves it. It's customary to do so.
What kind of weapons do they have? This is where it gets interesting. Altean alchemy can make some amazing constructions. What's more, when I was testing my ships, I began to feel a kind of psychic link. I don't know how to explain it, but the ship was reading my mind and communicating with me too.
Do I get a cape? Shh, shh, shh. Turn it off. Human behavior is rather like that of the albatross. Even if it wanders far from its nest, the albatross will always return.
Hush. Turn it off. Human behavior is rather like that of the albatross. Even if it wanders far from its nest, the albatross will always return. Unless it flies too close to the water and serves dinner to a shark.
- Do you want it? - Yes. Anything else? It's not perfect. - He can fly.
Evan, can you give me a hand? Thank you, Evan. Evan? Where's the blowtorch? It's gone.
She disappeared two years ago. It was on TV. A lot of people think she just took off. There was a message upstairs. It said:
I'll take care of this. Get the hell out of here. Don't ever come back! Why don't you come back the way you came? No, he's here somewhere.
"If you like something, let it go. "Isn't that the way it goes? You know I can't do that. You know what happens to a white shark if you put him in an aquarium? It bangs its brain against the walls.
I'm supposed to be in control by letting myself be carried along? It doesn't make sense. Not everything makes sense. It doesn't have to. Your intellect has taken you far in life. But it won't take you any further.
What about all the people you've killed? Insignificant, ephemeral particles in an indifferent universe. Yes, you'll see! You'll see what we do. The world is not what it's cracked up to be.
Excellent. Given the circumstances, formal wear is optional. Food plays a vital role in the rituals of life. Breaking bread, the condemned man's last meal... and now, this meal. Informal as it may seem, rest assured that the atmosphere was not very convivial.
Let's get out of here! Move it! This is a fast train! And it's not stopping here! It's on its way!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Kevin. Hi, can you answer the phone, please? - I can't answer the phone. It's in the aquarium.
I think what they mean is that the cat's out of the bag. They want us to put the cat back in the bag. No, I understand what they mean. - But what I'm saying is that the cat's already out. - I know, I know it's out.
Hey, stop her! Make it stop! Ah. Ghostbusters. Listen, it's great that you've found yourself a little hobby, and I'm sure that, in theory, overwhelming New York with ghosts sounded like a great idea, but it turns out we like the world just the way it is.
I'm a genius. i see things no one else can. and because of that, i'm mocked and scorned. Fortunately, I'm not the only one seeking revenge. Behind these walls, there are millions of souls who have been cast into the shadows. Souls who see the world for what it is, a stinking place.
Thank you, and now I'm proud to wear that nickname. - It's not... - Patty's uncle. Uncle! Where's Uncle?
Where is it? What are you talking about? I told you what happened. Where's the van? - It's on the other side.
I'm out. Who wants pancakes? I'm not ready to be alone. I don't know how to reboot my router. I don't even know where it is or what it's for.
I know, but it's a bad idea. You're getting your hopes up with Sex and the City and Bridget Jones. You convince yourself that you need to experience celibacy, which, between you and me, is totally bogus. All these chicks are looking for a boyfriend. And that's great. Now you can think about your career. I offered myself to the world and it rejected me.
Yes. Just a moment. Honey, what are you doing? You're damaging the tree. I don't even know if it's on our land.
- Every time I want to play... Happy anniversary! You're very pretty. - Have you finished, madame? How was the swordfish?
Who's that? Aurora. Ah. The sleeping girl. I'm not saying the universe is evil, but it's got a hell of a sense of humor.
My job is to keep you alive until you die, you understand? Spring break! Really hot, but really crazy. The world changed when Superman flew through the sky. And it changed again when he stopped.
I'm not much of a people person... but maybe we should be. She's trying to take over the world. And? What has the world ever done for us anyway? It hates us.
Living there in that big, beautiful house, it must be nice. You know you have their only embryo? - It's a baby now. - They don't have another one. In the eyes of the law, you carry it, so it's ours.
I had a nightmare with Liam Neeson. I dreamt I'd kidnapped his daughter and he wouldn't take it. They made three films like that. You end up thinking he's just a bad parent. The worst thing about cancer is not what it does to us, but what it does to the people we love.
I raised your stress level to trigger a mutation. You sadist! I healed you, Wade. Your mutated cells can cure anything. They attack your cancer faster than it forms.
- It's Charlie! My 6th grade basketball coach just left. Are you interested in the position? I'm sorry, do I look like someone with time on their hands? There's an extra $100 a week.
I have been. In the past. But what about me? I might be someday. Bridget, I haven't been entirely honest with you. Mark thinks the baby isn't his. I made him think it was mine.
You turned disasters into triumphs with your contagious, tireless and joyful zest for life. You managed this pregnancy almost single-handedly, despite a crazy mother, repressed men and unfaithful, unworthy boyfriends. Just a few more moments. Then you'll see your beautiful baby. But what if it's not yours?
You're not stupid. You're not Robbie Wheirdicht, you're Bob Stone. - I made that name up. - So what if you did? - It doesn't exist.
They're not going to fire me, Mom. I'm not gonna lose my health plan. Can you... Can you go to the website? What do you mean, there's nothing there?
- None of your computers are working? - Don't you have your book with you? - It's virtual. - Then it's not a real book. - Yes, it is.
- It turns out that Randy is completely unable to use a computer. - So he asked me for help with basic tasks like finding a folder or stupid videos, whatever. - That means... - It means I have complete access to everyone's academic records. - I looked in Daniel's file, it's empty.
Johnson wants to talk to the press. Let him do what he wants, I'm going out. Will the coffin be closed at the funeral? We'll deal with that later. I want it closed, Bobby.
No problem. Crap! You must be the Chinese pilot. - Did the giant flag give me away? - There's this.
- Kill him! Kill him! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! He's breathing! Get a medical team! Is he dead?
The safest place is near my son David. Since you're an expert on his illness, I wanted to show you this. How can his bond be so strong? During the first attack, he was exposed to their collective mind. There was no filter.
It's about intergalactic war. It involves the entire universe. What about this? Something about an enemy. We must destroy it before it finds us.
Of course. Just wait until we get inside. Sire! I think I have the perfect bib! You'd better be!
I may never come up for air. And your smile... The sun itself becomes jealous ... And refuses to go out Behind the clouds ... Knowing it can't shine half as bright.
Come on, eat! Eat! No! Happiness is not something you put inside. It's already there.
Being able to play in the mud with my friend, in the shade of a tree... There's nothing like it. Then we moved to Spokane, Washington. Back then, my world was very small. On the one hand, it stretched from the local grocery store to a friend's house, two houses down from ours.
At that time, Bushnell Keeler had a workshop in Georgetown. I only went there once, the following weekend. I went, Toby took me, he introduced me to his father and I saw the workshop. It was a reference in the field. It was so beautiful.
I had set up a kind of workspace for myself in a painting studio at school. When I was in this space, I was out of sight. There were other such spaces around me where you could work undisturbed. At the time, I was painting a 120 cm by 120 cm picture. It was mainly black, but there were also plants and green leaves peeking out from the black.
Hang in there! Hold on! Hold on! - I can't hold on! My little glove! It's slipping!
- I like it. - Jimmyface? - Great idea. Want to see our very first processor? It's big and it always caught fire.
- Jimmyface? - I'd love to. Want to see our very first processor? It's big and it always caught fire. It's upstairs with the tequila.
The ink destroyed the cash they took. But their objective was a safety deposit box. Yes. - Belonging to whom? - It belonged to a wealthy Russian named Dimitrije Petkov.
You're going to be fine. You're going to do exactly as we ask. You've got ten times as much tied to your head. We can't open the safe. It's on a timer.
Oh, my God, that was perfect. Tell me who was before me. I fucked girls who didn't care. Where'd you get the fucking gun, Charlie? Don't touch it, it's loaded.
Look, look, look. It's that black over there. It's that black over there. There's nothing there. It moved, it moved, it jumped.
It's that black over there. There's nothing there. It moved, it moved, it jumped. There's nothing there. He just jumped, he moved.
- Metal. Just to confirm, you have no metal rods, pins, plates or artificial parts of any kind. Okay, Mr. leeham, - No. My assistant will now close the watertight door to the room. Under no circumstances touch this phone until it rings.
For example, this phone is mainly wired in copper. All the interior has been replaced by non-ferrous metals. - It's not magnetized. Exactly! And it doesn't interfere with high-frequency headphones.
- I just want the ring. - I have another ring. It's right here. - You can't go out there. Not until he starts.
- What, are you mad now? You're full of shit. They offered to give us back our territory in 1999. In 20 years! It's ours!
What's a prospector? No, no, I... Seriously, what... What's a prospector? It's someone who thinks... he's going to find it.
No, no, I... Seriously, what... What's a prospector? It's someone who thinks... he's going to find it. He gets up every morning, again and again, again and again... sure he's going to find it.
Seriously, what... What's a prospector? It's someone who thinks... he's going to find it. He gets up every morning, again and again, again and again... sure he's going to find it. But there's nothing there.
There's nothing there. And he's standing there on the edge of the desert, looking... a new sunrise straight into his eyes, and... he hears this little voice, this little voice saying... "Keep going. Keep walking." and the sun's getting higher and higher, and it's shining above him, and it's really hot, and he hasn't got a drop of water left, and the people he's been with all want to go back,
What's wrong? Not on stage! - Don't be embarrassed! - We won't. I saw your body last night. It's a lot better than Cody's.
Barry? Yes, he's my best friend! I sold him six tons of ecstasy. And that's why they won't stop the bus. It's full of drugs!
{\1cH00ffff} - Ken, are you okay? - The derrick's about to fall. {\1cH00ffff}Dale! The boat's leaving! {\1cH00ffff}My crane is going to demolish the derrick. {\1cH00ffff} - It's collapsing!
I'm not a violent man. I usually work with numbers. But right now, I'm here to kill you, Frank. My daughter is dead because of you. It's men like you who think their actions have no consequences, who made this country what it is.
- No. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Do you want a drink? No, but set fire to this hole, and we'll avoid this stupid evening. There are fewer people than expected.
For Christ's sake! Eddie's home! Give him a big hand. Give it up for Walker the Dynamite. He's living proof that black doesn't wear out, it decomposes.
It was at a Jewish country club. Italian. No. Jewish. There were lots of Jews.
Yes. Don't applaud. I know I'm old. I fell asleep just as I was about to withdraw. My sperm had forgotten where it was supposed to go.
We have a better way. Helium. It fizzes. Forget your balloon. It'll land on the ocean.
I remember you as a little boy, Kolya, when your father and I used to take you hunting. You were 12, 13 maybe, and you were so excited. You wanted to kill something. And we spotted a deer, so you raised your rifle. But the deer just looked at you and kept on grazing. It wasn't scared.
One eighth of the world's economy comes from the bloody black market. We all know it. Blood money. That's what it is. It could be under a mobster's mattress, or in a City bank.
I swear that no matter what happens to me in this life, I'll never lie to you again. I love you so much! What happened to your nose? I was kidnapped by Albanian gangsters. I think it's broken.
You're too sick to be here. 36500, this is Chatham Station, clear the bar. Repeat, clear the bar. Then head due south. Radar is intermittent, but indicates a point some 20 km east of Monomoy Point, moving south.
He ended up in the Navy. And he can't swim. Tell him why it's okay. Because we're not going in the water? You know how old this ship is, kid? She's 13.
The street killed my father and my little brother. I wanted to leave there, discover the world, pick up little foreigners. I'm with you all the way. Take notes. Adventure. The sex. Put that in your book, it'll sell like hotcakes.
If they reach the capital, there's no stopping them. Even at full gallop, the capital is two days' ride away. There's no catching them. The wind is strong. Tomorrow, it will blow from the north.
They'll use it to destroy us. I will find it. Then I'll watch them destroy you and your Credo. The Credo is immortal. It's in your blood.
Our work belongs to the Elders. It's their finest hour. You lied to me. I've always known that in your heart of hearts, you're a scientist first and a Templar second. Your recent work has impressed us, but it confirms our belief that mankind cannot be saved.
We were impressed by your recent work, but it confirms our belief that mankind cannot be saved. So you've thought of everything. Well, not quite. My speech... It needs an elegant introduction of your own.
But their men are well trained. They're threatening to turn this into a civil war. Moldavia. The Russians had it, lost it. It became independent, but there are conflicts.
All the equipment brought back from the base. We can take it apart and build an arsenal. And we can get to Masarov and stop it before it spreads. The condensate can feed on any energy it finds along the way. It will continue to grow.
Shit! Shit! Shit! Why didn't you tell us? Because you would have tried to talk me out of it and I know what I'm doing is right. And what about His commandment? There's no question of killing when it comes to war.
I wasn't even... Marybeth. You're a Treasury official. What the hell did you get yourself into? How did you dent this thermos? It's just old.
(echo of scream) (groan) (Connor's voice): Bennie. Sorry I ran out on you. Don't take it personally. I'm leaving you this phone, I'm sure you'll find it useful.
Who did you tell my name to? Arlene from product placement? Get out of my jeans. The building was supposed to be empty. It was.
Hello, Sigourney. I need your help! Come with us... Great! ... to discover the wonders of the Pacific Ocean and the living treasures it holds.
Any living relatives? No. My sister died in the earthquakes. Mom and dad were killed by the virus. But it didn't kill you, did it?
Tull. Love is a lie. A deception used by cruel people at the expense of fools and the weak. Put it out of your minds! May it never again make you weak-minded or weak-willed.
Because you do have a plan, don't you? Yes. Is it a good plan? No. But it's a simple one.
My brother believed that the Beyond would be offered to you. I think a king should have higher standards. From now on, you'll pay for your place in the Beyond with your own wealth. Your journey has just begun. It's yours now.
I'd gladly push it into the void. Hello. One day I'll come and steal you away from him. Is stealing always the answer? It is in today's world.
Stay in my shadow. - Why should I do that? - Just do as I say. My respects, Great God Ra. Usually, when a bird lands on my boat, I kill it before it shits.
We're off. And you, schoolmaster, take off your hat. Teddy... I expect better of you, boy. Recoil isn't something to be avoided, it's something to be cushioned.
Being a caregiver is not just about feeding, dressing and grooming. It also involves knowing how to navigate the complex relationship between those who provide care and those who receive it.
- Yes? Why did you call me Hannah? Make them back off. Your name is very special. It's a palindrome. It can be read backwards as well as forwards.
The heptapod can be learned. If we survive. If we learn it, if we master it, we'll perceive time in their way and anticipate things to come. But time isn't the same for them. It's not linear.
The opposite would be astonishing. If you don't intervene, the massacre will be total. No survivors. How can we help? Umbrella has created an aerobic antivirus. Propagated, it would destroy the T-virus and everything it infected through contact.
- Nuclear explosions. This is the last image received from the satellite. There's the boy. In the center of the thermal radiation. That's not thermal radiation. In any case, the satellite's sole mission was to detect nuclear events.
We have to be prepared. After tomorrow, he may not be here. I'm done. Have you ever seen a sunrise? Did you like it? What color was it?
Are you suggesting we turn on the thrusters? I'm open to suggestions. All right, then. - There's a glitch. - What's that? The fuel is ready, but it resists combustion.
Logbook, stardate 2262.18. The mission, a routine investigation... If the Universe is endless... What seemed clear to me two years ago now seems out of reach. Tell me where it is!
But there's yours. One morning, Saint Peter was looking at his book, preparing the Last Judgment, and he showed me your name. It's there, on the M page. Rose's too. I haven't seen it, but I know it's there.
No, it's only $200. See that roof over your head? Let me tell you something. It hasn't been tarred in 10 years. If it snows on that roof this winter, it's going to seep in, little by little, unobtrusively, and all of a sudden, it's going to leak everywhere.
I had to have a conversation with a stranger for 30 minutes. - Right. And show that I'm a good hostess. - And show that I'm a good hostess. Maybe next week they'll have weddings. I'm going to design a new crest for the Dandelions. It'll be huge, so everyone can see it.
I'm going to design a new Dandelion crest. It's going to be huge, so everyone can see it. And it'll be a picture of a woman. A sad woman wearing an apron, bent over an oven. It will read, "Why do we prefer vaginas to mouths?"
What's up? I love this sweater. I don't see why not. This sweater goes with everything. It's neutral.
This sweater goes with everything. It's neutral. It doesn't go with your skin or your face. This sweater is the equivalent of a sandwich board that says, "I give up." And on the back it says, "I've never tried it."
What does the song say again? They're from the north, right? Up in the mountains, where no one ventures. Sometimes, a dragon wanders away from his family, and finds himself far from home. They say he lives in these woods.
Except for me. You saw a dragon? You bet I did! You bet I did! What did it look like?
Have you seen a dragon? You bet I did! You bet I did! What did it look like? It was green.
What did it look like? It was green. All green, except for the eyes. They were red. Like hellfire. Before I knew it, he raised his head, opened his mouth, and spat...
Ask for a helicopter. Dragons fly! A dragon? You brought me all the way out here for a dragon? I don't know how to explain it, but he's telling the truth. He's been here.
Dragons fly! A dragon? You brought me all the way out here for a dragon? I don't know how to explain it, but he's telling the truth. He was here. He's still here.
Honey, look. We never saw that dragon again. I stopped telling my stories. It was no longer necessary. People moved heaven and earth, but he was never found.
How about it? That's a great idea. Look at that. Little pink ass bouncing, saying... Terry, come and get me Terry, come and get me No, he's saying...
But you're not one of them. I had to take the pictures! I had to take the pictures! And I even have a ship. It disassembles to infiltrate enemy strongholds.
We're in the open. Shoot him. Yes, sir, I will. What about payment? Did he come through or was he robbed too?
- I'm a rabid dog, understand? - A mad dog! Those who attack me, I don't attack them! I kill them! All you killed tonight was our chance to fuck! Your little Detroit mad dog act makes you feel tough, but it doesn't help your teammates.
It's beautiful, thank you. Bla-bla-bla! You've laid it all out brilliantly. What's up? Looking for the serum? Right here.
Not like there's going to be a new generation. Thank you, sir. These are all calls made from the Russian's phone. Two mentions of business with the white Portuguese. And he's constantly transmitting encrypted data to Alexander Luthor's personal residence.
Sienna. There are too many of us here! You won't get to that bag before we do! No. But I can make sure it tears.
Are we ready? Then let's begin. Sit quietly and close your eyes. Imagine yourself in a halo of white light. It will protect you.
Your mom told me what's going on, and I'm here to help if I can. Do you want to talk about it? When I was about your age, I was visiting my mom in the hospital and I saw an angel. Yes. He was standing next to a little boy's bed.
Do you want to talk about it? When I was about your age, I was visiting my mother in hospital and I saw an angel. Yes. He was standing next to a little boy's bed. He was gently stroking his cheek, and then he stopped.
When I was about your age, I was visiting my mother in hospital and I saw an angel. Yes. He was standing next to a little boy's bed. He was gently stroking his cheek, then he stopped. Then he looked at me.
I was terrified. But then I remembered what a good nun had told me in Sunday school. "God will be there for anyone who needs him." So I grabbed this crucifix from my nightstand. And I told whatever was under there to leave, or God would kick its ass.
Why would he give us that clue? He must think we know him. What are you going to do about it? A non-human mind capable of blocking Lorraine is too strong for me. We've got to get Janet to the church before he kills her.
- It's nothing, really. What a family resemblance! It moves me. Would you like to change? No, let's have tea while it's hot.
I missed you too. It's a family. He was looking for his parents. I got the truck. It's not moving.
And like you, I'm ready to do anything to avenge myself on those who wronged him. The only difference between your father and mine is that mine is still alive. Get him up. - Then he's the pathetic one who's spent his life plotting against me. I wouldn't have recognized your face even if it had been on a giant billboard in front of my house.
Darkness exists alongside our world. Populated by evil beings. What's that got to do with me? If you're descended from these divine beings, you link worlds. If the demon consumes your soul, it will use your body.
20% for Alex, share the rest equally. It's better to wait until Monday, when the S.E.C.... Do as you're told. Remember, Oz, money doesn't change people. It only reveals them.
I can't leave the cab. What do you mean, you can't leave the cab? It's my father's cab. He needs it. He'll pick it up here or at the impound lot.
But announce it. Was I wrong to trust you? Perhaps you'd prefer a post in hell. Hunt down every disciple. And above all, find the body of that cursed Yeshua before it rots.
- Sometimes we bury them... - No more. No more. Let's not talk about his body anymore. It must be hideous by now.
There are no enemies here. Come this way. You hold the world in your hands, Beneficiarii. Know that. I believe it rests on these people.
The left engine was still idling. It couldn't be. I felt it give out. Like stopping in mid-air. He said it might have been under-revving, with some leftover thrust.
- No, no, it's too thick. It's too heavy. It's... it's peat. I haven't seen this stuff in years. - It's also under the toenails.
We can see you hitting it. Lie back. Don't you know the world hasn't seen such danger since the Great War? They're cutting budgets while the barbarians are on our doorstep. The system didn't fail, it died and you know it.
There was no scar, just this lump under my skin. And... it was mine. But, they tied me up. They operated on me and stole it. By the time they removed that implant, it had begun to fuse with my nerves.
I'm not afraid of him. You should XAVIER'S SCHOOL OF GIFTED YOUNGSTERS I've devoured pages and pages about this place But now that I'm here it's almost Familiar.
I think he's the teacher. A message to every man, woman and mutant. You've lost your way. But I've come back. On Judgment Day, he's here.
It's 6 p.m., Sir Alistair. A glass of sherry? Yes, please. The government will publish this white paper on the situation and your succession. It clearly explains that, without our intervention, Bechuanaland would have been torn apart by the rivalry between you and your uncle.
Michi was right. The forest makes you see things. Take a look. I found a place. There might be a radio.
This is where we die! Hang in there! We're almost there! There must be some way to stop the gas spreading. Check the ventilation control system. It covers the whole city.
Is that okay? And you'll come to Los Angeles at Christmas. I don't want to leave Mom alone at Christmas. Conor, this medicine... It'll cure Mom.
The Universe... An immensity of space and matter. It encompasses everything we see and know.
And you don't look like the picture on your card. Francine, you must be dating a foreign specimen. Francine, let's talk. Is it because of the bikini? I didn't know it was poison ivy.
We need to get there to see what's attracting the asteroid. Once we know what it is, we can find a way to send it somewhere else. If this plan had a face, I'd be happy to crush it. So, instead of running away from a deadly asteroid, you want us to jump on it? It doesn't sound like much, I know, but let's be happy in the knowledge that it will kill us no matter where we go.
You'll be thrilled. What a ridiculous walk! Look at me, Julian. It's me, Julian. Forget the asteroid. Give me a hug, Daddy-face! Look at that pretty bird over there. Yeah, it's pretty.
The blinding light that's getting bigger by the minute? So what? Everything seems normal. With all due respect, Your Torcitude, that's an asteroid. It's magnetically attracted to this place and is heading here.
All right, then. - Yo, guys! - Open your minds. - Now, who's this guy? - He's Johnnie B.
- Hey, Kyle. Here you go, buddy. A loaner violin bow. You break it, you buy it. Is it the best you got?
I'm appalled! I wanted to... No, no, don't go! Has anyone seen my glass eye? He's here, Miss Crawly.
In the beginning of time, there was only the ocean, until Mother Island emerged. Te Fiti. Its heart possessed an immense power, absolutely unique. It could create life itself.
Or accept the mission and return to the dead. What do you think, Senhor Santos? I've got to make a phone call. What'll you do? Tell your employer there's nothing to be gained by screwing a dead man.
The boat's berth is in Sydney at PS 7. The boat you're looking for has left. It must be a big boat. Let's look further out. It must be around here.
He was nailed down. The spirit is not bound to the body. It's nailed to it. Thank you, darling. He won't give up the realm of the flesh easily.
What's the matter? I'm pregnant. I've been wondering what's wrong with me for a while now. My breasts are swollen, I'm craving mashed potatoes and cigarettes. I bought a pregnancy test and it's positive, I'm pregnant.
It's a digestive. It's not crack. What's crack? Crack is a highly addictive crystallized derivative of cocaine. In the mid-80s, it was the cause of the decline of inner-city dwellers.
- I've got some bad news. Uh, we've got about 4 days before you turn into a werewolf. Isn't it supposed to last one more night? No, the moon has to be full to turn you. I'm looking at the l unary calendar. It says we have 4 more nights of full moons.
- Relax, you'll be fine! No, you'll be fine! You'll be fine... You're gonna eat me... Help me with the cage! Listen, if the werewolf inside you eats me, it's not because he's evil. It's because it's a monster.
Listen, if the werewolf inside you eats me, it's not because he's evil. It's because he's a monster. It's good. If the werewolf inside you eats me, that doesn't make it evil. It's just a monster, you know. It has no control.
Can you take a walk, Joey? What's that got to do with it, sweetheart? He needs to go outside. He's healthy. That dog is not healthy. And he'll never be healthy. Because I'm not spending $10,000 to fix his broken ass.
It's for Uncle Mike's cat. God, I love cats. Is that cage for a cat? This cat must be... as big as your bullshit! It's an outdoor cat, and it's tight, especially in the back.
Remember, your worst quality can also be your best, okay? Promise me something, Jack. Don't be afraid if the werewolf inside you eats me. It doesn't make it bad. It's just a monster. He has no control over it. Which makes him a monster.
I outrank you, so you have to respect me. You have to listen to him, Max. He outranks us both. For the past 7 days, Section V has been intercepting coded messages sent from London to Berlin from a transceiver. The signal has not yet been located, but it originates from Highgate in North London, and the information concerns the activities of SOE networks in France.
Okay, why is this happening? Okay, well. It'll happen because you're too comfortable in your lives to see it happen. You young people just don't get it. This country buys its rebels. It turns rebels into fashion figures.
Okay, well. It'll happen because you're too comfortable in your lives to see it coming. You young people don't understand. This country buys its rebels. It turns rebels into fashion figures. It did it with the Angels, it's doing the same with rap.
But she had a beautiful wedding. She became a hood ornament for the best cars. When did you leave home? I know why little rich girls leave their pretty little things behind. When a mosquito bites you, it leaves an enzyme that other mosquitoes can smell.
I wasn't holding it right. Aim, show me. Now pull. See the handle, how well made it is? I've got a dry one, but it's from a pine tree, and pines are tough.
The olive tree too, and the trees found in people's gardens. Every time you see a branch shaped like a handle, you pick it up. This one was a bit dry when I picked it up, but pines are resilient. - Safe. - It's really solid.
Because you're used to it. My boy, we have a problem with this eye: it's a lazy eye. Do you know what a lazy eye is? It's an eye that doesn't work, it's lazy.
I took 68 of them to the emergency room, they were in bad shape. This is a young boy all covered in burns, he's very young, 14, 15 at the most. We see a lot of them, chemical burns, fuel burns. They put them on dangerous rubber boats, and during the trip, they have to fill fuel cans. The fuel spills on the ground and mixes with the sea water, then their clothes get soaked and this mixture is dangerous, it causes serious burns that give us pain and give us a lot of work.
- How long have you had this problem? - A while. A month, two months, a year, two years? Maybe a year. Does it happen in summer or winter?
A Trojan. He put in a Trojan. It started downloading everything. Then nothing. And now... it's empty.
You take gomina? You've got nothing, it's a bluff. No video, no photos. You think you're clever? Beware your pride, it can be your undoing.
My brother... How is he? It's not Ser Loras who brings me. The king misses you. Spousal love is sacred. It reflects the love the gods have for us.
I asked my then-girlfriend to buy me a present, I think it was for Christmas or my birthday, Warren Farrel's book, "The Myth of Male Power", and she did, and it changed my whole life. Her thesis was that women are often seen as sexual objects, while men are often seen as successful objects. It resonated with me. He wrote this book that made us question our notions of power, who holds power, and where it lies, and it questions men's roles, but not in the feminist way, which has always relied on gender roles.
-Keep me warm... -What's up? -Anything new on Jeannie's bag? -Yes, bravo, Jim. It's at the boss's.
She was a redhead. -I didn't notice, sorry. This number requires absolute concentration. We have here... a revolver. Examine it, you'll see it's normal.
It's a scarecrow. What are you going to do with it? I'm going to put him away. Dirty bug... What does the bad dream say? It says:
What's Sophie's dream? Your golden dream. You don't hear about that anymore. But what does this dream say? It tells the story of a little girl.
- I'm in position. - Perfect. Where did you put the microphone? It's not important. Let's just say we'll probably have to throw it away when we're done. So it's in your ass.
Yes. Good. Good! The human body is a temple. It must be honored and celebrated.
Give me five. That's me. WELCOME, THAD! YOUR DAUGHTER, SAMMY - How do I look? - Nice suit. It's just like the one Thad drew.
You're confusing peace with terror. Oh, am I? You have to start somewhere. I'll be no use to you, Krennic. My mind isn't what it used to be.
- Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Am I too independent-minded for you? No, I don't like to criticize my country. It's my country too, and it's got blood on its hands.
Are you questioning this? Glenn, nobody's ever seen one. There's no precedent here. Our source risked his life for this document. It's authentic.
My passport was revoked when I went to Latin America. When people ask me, "Why Russia?" I reply, "Ask the State Department." Would you be prepared to face a trial? Yes, if it were fair and public.
This is the interesting stage, that of hibernation. Like suspended time. A comatose state. The heart can stop, or so we thought. In fact, it slows to a crawl.
- Riley: Okay! 9-1-1 says she needs to breathe! Zoey: Way past! Focus on this baby. It's being born whether you like it or not, so just use everything your dad taught you in little league and catch it like a ball!
It's open! - Hi, there. - You're right on time. Do sit down. The film about the Moon, I'm not telling you what it looks like, but take a look, won't you?
"A voice that says, 'I'm here and it's all good'" "I don't care if I just know where I'm going" "Because all I need is this crazy feeling" "The rat-tat-tat of my heart" "I think I want it to stay" Messengers interview on WTJM Chicago 98.8 FM "City of stars Do you shine just for me?"
Nothing is free. Nothing is free. Not even good. Especially not good. When the carpenter takes his saw, if the wood could talk, it would howl.
When the carpenter takes his saw, if the wood could talk, it would howl. You can't take the right to vote out of the civil rights bill! The bill won't pass if he's in it, not this year. You told Dr. King you wanted to pass this bill by the word. You don't sell a horse by saying he's blind in one eye and nauseous.
He's my vet. And Travis, this is Ryan McCarthy, my boyfriend. Nice to meet you, Ryan. Hey, you want to ride the old rusty Cyclone? It only killed four people this year.
I'm not burning your steak. We got lucky. The sheriff's retriever was a patient of mine, or Travis would have spent the weekend in jail. But I never got the truck out of the swamp. It's still there, a frog motel.
It's not your fault, Travis. Get that out of your head. The world breaks everyone, Travis. The very good, the very gentle, the very brave. And the ones it doesn't break, it kills.
You were looking for Amelia, weren't you? Yes and no. What do you mean, yes and no? My job is very complicated, okay? There are nuances.
Why didn't you watch my movie? - See ya. - Come see it with me. - Have a nice evening. - It's on again.
I must have taken the wrong flight. I'll write when I know more. Sincerely, Guan Chun. My bracelet suddenly had another function. If someone needed help, it started to blink.
Are you saying we were millionaires and lost everything? And you never wanted to look for that? Of course I did. Where's the money? Here it is.
You want your money back? Don't you ever threaten me again. Get him out of here. Go get the stuff. Sorry I borrowed your truck, but it's back, so...
This is how we end up. Always here, always together. You have a beautiful brain. I admire it. I concede that it may even equal mine.
I won't do it again! I'll never do it again! What the hell are you talking about? Is your body made of sugar or something? Does it melt when you fuck?
The East Gate and North Gate are for the citizens of Mohenjo Daro. How was it built? What's the symbol, Uncle Phulji? It's a six-creature symbol! It represents the six great cities of Sindhu.
You won't find this anywhere else! I propose to build a dam to stop the waters of the Sindhu... To unearth the river's gold. A dam? But then how will the river flow? It will flow Jakhiro... and to do that we'll dig a new path for the river... Which will meet here.
Take your things and go to the river gate. Take your cattle with you, but leave the ploughs. We'll all have to leave Mohenjo Daro! The river can't be stopped. It will break the dam and make a new path for itself... And in its course, it will destroy Mohenjo Daro.
Do you mind if I make myself comfortable? No, not at all. What the hell? Your coat. It's so bright.
I heard that too. Spooky. Sit down, Elaine. Elaine, the DNA came back from the lab. It links you to Wayne Peters.
Why am I here? You and your pal, Dr. Stockman, have found something that belongs to me. The teleporter. The teleporter was supposed to break me out of prison. But it's capable of so much more.
The teleporter was supposed to break me out of prison. But it's capable of much more. This device is part of a machine called an arc condenser. Years ago, I sent the capacitor to the Earth dimension. But when it entered your atmosphere, it broke into three pieces.
- All right, then. In my rearview mirror, I see a huge garbage truck hurtling towards us, completely out of control. And what was the purpose of this combat-ready sanitation vehicle? I ask myself the same question. Then it started throwing sewer covers out of its grille.
Sorry, this is personal data. Unless you have a money order. Not the cash payments you're hiding. Credit cards. Not without a warrant, sorry. Here it is, my money order. Imagine it's a C.
It's Conner! Period, I'm the humblest POPSTAR: Famous at any price Number one on the humblest list My apple crumble It's the crummiest But I'm like it's gross Because I'm too humble
What about us? Numbers are overrated, you know that. - Oh, boy. - Can we talk about the helmet? It's so heavy, it's killing my back.
Damn. Conner is full of surprises these days. On my way to the airport, I noticed something amazing. In his bag, he had a book called BE A BETTER FRIEND. HOW TO BE A BETTER FRIEND He'd marked the pages and taken notes.
Something we're very proud of. Would you like to add anything, Monsieur Hubert? What floor are we on, Andrews? 14th. But actually, it's the floor of misfortune, the 13th.
There's one thing I have to do. OK. Wells, Wells! Chase has a lead on a cargo plane. It's at Lunken Airport registered to Jan Martense.
Things are just beginning. The foreigners won't pay us unless we force them. Star Helix, calm down! The power will be back on in a minute. Of course it will.
You know I'm an engineer, right? Show me the diagnostics and the engine core level. Life support. What's going on? I don't know. I don't know, ask the ship, it seems to know everything.
to the nearest radiation shelter in an orderly fashion. Son of a $@#! A ship just exploded on the docks. - The Rocinante? - No, it wasn't in this shed.
Yeah. Yeah, enough of that. Hey, hey, Roach, Roach, come meet these people. Who stole my damn burrito? No, he's right here, Roach.
I'm a healer. Ah... a healer. I see. I see. The dimension and total appearance is as stated. Your name wouldn't happen to be Claire Fraser, would it?
_ (LAUGHTER) _ Tell us, Mrs. Fraser, what makes English ladies call a manly member? Ah, well, I... heard it referred to as "disappears."
- For a hat? - Yes! We warn stations if there's danger, or if someone is ill. A hat is not a person. It represents no danger.
You're a big nose. Yes. Maybe even the biggest. You haven't worn a hat in a long time. It's not bad.
- Evil? - Yes. But not at all. This hat brings good luck. This hat has saved many lives. Do you know who it belongs to?
I saw you in Piazza San Marco. I noticed your hat. Yes ? Did you notice the initials on the inside? Yes. And so, if I'm not mistaken, it doesn't belong to you?
Yes ? Did you notice the initials on the inside? Yes. And so, if I'm not mistaken, it doesn't belong to you? Now you know who it belongs to.
She doesn't like it when we steal. I didn't give it back. It's not the same thing. He loves making love. That's weird. It suits you too.
I believe it's by the same Japanese author who wrote "La peau du lézard". Acquired from a Japanese sailor on a Hamburg ship. Can you imagine my delight when, after such a journey, it landed on my shelf with its brothers? They are the children for whom I feel the most affection. It's known to contain an elaborate monochrome woodcut, but as you can see... it's so unfortunate.
If we eat contaminated food, these parasites find their way into our internal organs. Let's take a look at sample number three. It's a big one. Let's see what we've got. It's still alive.
Come on, Oliver. Come on, everybody. Here, come on. All terriers have been bred for vermin control. Where is it?
Oh, he's downstairs. You can go and see him if you like. What happened to him? He went into cardiac arrest. His heart had become very fragile and... it just gave out.
- You moron. - Uncle, are you out of your fucking mind? Get in the fucking car. I can't obey unless you unlock the door. Shut the fuck up. It's not that the engine won't work tomorrow, but Joe said it breaks down all the time and it's a real piece of shit.
- Really, Patty? - Go on, turn up the heat. I did turn it up. Turn it up a little, come on. It's already on full blast.
Humans have evolved over millions and millions of years to be like this. - We do all this stuff because it helps us survive... basically. What's a poo? It's poop. Poop is when your body takes everything it doesn't want and squeezes it out of your butt.
The phone is beautiful. No, no, no, no, no. It's just a picture of a girl on a phone. What? Where'd it go?
I wouldn't even want to be with myself. Finally... What? Yeah, that's what I wanted to tell you, Hank. There's a giant raccoon, and he's eating all our food.
No need to thank me. Don't go wasting it on those morons. - What's the job? - The job? It's about a friend of mine.
Charming place. - Charles, what's going on? - Just get in the car. You look like the kind of man who'd keep a big gun in the trunk or under his front seat. It's under the front seat.
This story about the knife, is it false? It's true. SALIM: [FROM SCREEN] What knife? NASIR: It was there, I took it.
I don't have any more. Thank you, sir. Here you are. Sign this contract. It stipulates that you will not discuss any business outside this office.
And all you do is talk down to me. I don't give a shit. - You're a coward. Take all my money! It's yours.
Keep watching and be discreet. Right, let's go! I want access to the city's surveillance cameras. Do a network search on that damn rail yard van. It's here somewhere.
Who said anything about going soft? Look, I'm talking about letting someone else take your place and play your part from time to time. Thanks for your concern, but I'll decide when it's time to change tactics. No, I'll decide. This crew has spilled a lot of blood to make your name what it is.
Look, I'm talking about letting someone else replace you and play your role from time to time. Thanks for your concern, but I'll decide when it's time to change our tactics. No, I'll decide. This crew has spilled a lot of blood to make your name what it is. It doesn't belong to you.
The first time you opened this door and showed me the Urca gold, do you know what I saw? A solution. Cement that would consolidate the sand beneath our feet. What I could offer Spain or England or whoever came here threatening to restore order, telling them, "Take this and leave me in peace." Everything depends on that gold, and right now it sits in a fort full of holes and no cannons.
You're getting awfully close to the one thing you promised never to do. Don't ask me to take sides between you and him. It doesn't matter. It can't be done. There's a reason he's up there in the first place.
- There's no time for a real class. - Right. OK. I suggest you think about this sentence by Rousseau: "If there were a people of gods, "they would govern themselves democratically.
- Pandora. - Come on. -We'll have to dismantle the radiator. - In the box. - It's so heavy!
"one expects to become it. "If happiness does not come, "hope is prolonged "and the charm of illusion lasts as long as the passion that causes it. "Thus, this state is sufficient in itself "and the anxiety it gives rise to is a kind of enjoyment
I know it sounds crazy, but this tree raised me. It taught me how to catch balls. It watched me grow. It helped me start my first business, even gave me the products. Then magnolia juice turned out to be as toxic as it was delicious.
I'm calling about a cat. Some kind of ugly red-headed critter. Yes, I'm the one with the foot thing. Yes, I'll hold. Is it still there?
They did. Okay. Steven is reprimanded, he'll pay your cousin's hospital bills and he'll send a heartfelt letter of apology. Great, he'll pay the bills in blood. In his own blood, if need be.
Give me a second, I'll reload. Give me my money! No, don't do that. You know where the money is? It's there.
And one, and two, and three... A woman's body is a complex thing, at once fragile and formidable, vulnerable and courageous. It's the source of our hopes, the fulfillment of our youth, the weight of our fears.

- "Let's look at what we have." - "Not what we don't have." One kiss, Rhoda. And that's all you get! That's what I should have told you nine months ago! Your cervix is well effaced, Mrs. Mullucks. It's dilating, ready for the big event.
When is the term? One week? Two weeks? Dates are never precise. Johnny still has a few days, he must see this baby, he must arrive now.
- Elephants. Rhinoceroses. Hippos. And to extend the comparison, a monkey as a baby. It doesn't seem to tuck in its chin as well as it should.
We couldn't have saved him. But to leave him alone? Frozen, shivering, and possibly in pain? The mother's anesthetic must still be in his system. He shouldn't be in pain.
But to leave him alone? Frozen, trembling and possibly in pain? The mother's anesthetic must still be in his system. He shouldn't be in pain. And he can't live.

Roseanne? He's out He's not moving Is the baby breathing? Why isn't it moving?
- Coming, my love. Although I'm helping out pro bono, I hope to see my good work rewarded with this week's pocket money. I'm sure you'd like that! Thank you so much for coming. We know it took a lot of effort for some of you.
This is Dr. Turner's first chest clinic for chronic lung problems and bronchial conditions Hello, Mr. Philips To help you be a little more comfortable at home. And open wide, please The drainage posture, where the head is below the lungs, is a simple but effective way to dislodge mucus when it gathers in the lungs
They want me to give birth in hospital, because of my age. Well, they seem to be taking good care of you, - because you look perfectly well. - I'm a regular, Mrs. Turner. The autoclave's nearly finished. I'll restock your instruments as soon as it stops.
That's just fine. Come on, lovebirds. You'll be courting... When you're safe in the ambulance. The baby turns, Baisy, he knows exactly what to do.
This is not the time! The enemy is still out there! Let's go ! I asked for air support. It never came.
Forget it. No black man ever accomplished that. Percy Sutton came close, but that was a long time ago. Harlem's Paradise is a special place. And it's going to stay that way.
What's on your mind? I have no remorse. Is that normal? As long as you have an alibi, it doesn't matter. The secret of every big lie is that it must be parallel to the truth.
What is it? Severance pay? You're all working for me now. - What about the club? - Mariah owns it.
Not having seen anything bothers you, does it? Because seeing is my thing! That's what made me a good leader. I could see everything in my head. I knew exactly where the players were going to be, so I put the ball where it needed to be.
It's not simple. It's very hard. And that's why we'll always be needed. Harlem hero, my ass. When it comes to the straight and narrow, it's not all about Luke Cage.
Found by facial recognition. Sealed juvenile record. Is that all? Why sealed? - Statute of limitations.
He can only win by controlling the entrances and exits. I've got to get you somewhere safe. What the...? This building belonged to Lucky Luciano. There are still some safe houses from the Prohibition era.
The garbage bag is for the clothes you wear. You put everything in it. Even jewelry. Spurlock will incinerate it. The secret of every big lie is that it must parallel the truth.
Especially when you've come to kill a man. Someone took care of Zip and his two sidekicks. That's not Cage's style, so I figure Shades didn't appreciate you letting him down. You know when a rattlesnake is most dangerous? When it's trapped.
Luke Cage goes wild. You strike again like a wimp. - The file. - Don't you have it? It's still inside.
I'm not running anymore. How many have you got? Fate's working hard to stop this being a living room. Maybe not. Either way, it'll be a famous place.
No, please, you have to protect her. Don't worry. I'll take care of Malina. You must take her to the hospital right away. This place, it seems so familiar.
Time has no meaning here, only memories. Memories? They fool us into seeing time as a straight line, with a past and a future, but really, time--time is a circle. And memories are timeless. Every moment of our lives exists in this place-- every memory.
Did you really think you could escape without knowing me? It's over, Tommy. My name is Nathan. And you can't stop someone who can stop time. Time travel-- he's a bitch.
See where I work? I'll tell you what. Go search my place. I don't give a shit. It's clean.
Many years ago, I had an idea. Got it. We've got facial recognition. Bourne flew from London to Las Vegas. Landed two hours ago.
I threw those things away like you said. I'm moving to Storlock to train as a healer. You've never been more than five miles outside Shady Vale. The outside world is dangerous, Wil. It's full of gnomes and trolls and Rovers.
The Ellcrys called for me. I heard him during the Gauntlet, then again tonight. I tried to ignore it, but it won't let me. Amberle, you're not making sense. When I touch the tree, it shows me visions... horrible visions of the future.
Does arrogant attitude also come on a silver platter? You don't know the first thing about my life. Well, you don't have an escort. My guess is, you're running away, probably from a guy who either broke your heart or knocked you up. Whatever your drama, it doesn't even compare to what you're going to have to deal with out there in the real world.
Here it is. It's a link to a cramming site that offers revision of French classics, including Éluard and his famous poem. And then if you click on the stanza on the post-it, like so, you'll come across a very interesting blog. Very nice, as you can see. It's full of tips for those who think slimness equals seduction.
This is good news. It confirms that the update was the problem. We can reset them, clean them up, and put them back into service. You think I'm going to ratify that psycho's return to service? It's programmed that way.
By the old tree. She was crying. What's wrong? She told me about the baby. Wasn't it yours?
I just finished the Price report. Would you like a beer? Sure, I'd love one. Hey, what was your dream, anyway? Oh, it was stupid.
Yes, of course. MacGuffin's "Thumb" disappeared - this morning from the Olsen-Medavoy gallery. - The Oh My God. I thought it was in the Lewis Oberby Library.
The painting is gone. The statue's gone. If you say so. Frankly, the comings and goings of the pieces are the responsibility of Randy, a first-rate idiot, a true double-zero moron. Excuse me, but Theodore Roosevelt's 35th birthday cake just arrived, and it's a mess.
We could use a more powerful beater. Where did you get the ferret? Give me a name. - Don't you have a name? - I do, Angie, but I never liked it.
Anyone with a $50,000 cellar. One last question. Do you know how your cufflink ended up in a ferret? I travel a lot around the world. It could have fallen off when I was in the mountains.
Well, you're obviously married to your work. You know something? It's true, I am. And I want to have children with him and grow old with him. And when he's too old to remember who I am, I want to read him stories, and I want to be buried next to him under the old apple tree in front of the police station.
Okay, but judging by this, we're in the same boat. You've got an empty rifle and two fucking fire axes! I'm just saying... It's close, we'll make it quick. Okay, but we're not risking our lives for you. If we find the shotgun, it's ours.
The umbilical cord is tangled. Simple as that. Strange, isn't it? The vital link between you and your child shrank around his neck, like a noose. It prevented him from getting out. It tightened again and again until he could fight no longer.
Finish closing. I'll go check the camera. I'm not going home if this thing's broken. What's broken? What's wrong with it?
- And the mass spectrometer? - Not a thing! It's a jagged piece of metal that's been violently torn from a vehicle. So, according to Newton's 3rd law of motion, there must be something that's been transferred onto the end - which will reveal where it came from.
- No, just a bag of carrots. I'll contact the bomb squad. They want to find the rest of the device, so make sure it's completely blown up. The density of the shrapnel and the powder residue - suggest that it might have ...
Good. Holy water on us all. Bless us all. May the Lord protect us as we protect his will. The demon inside her has access to all her memories. He will lie to hurt you, to anger you.
It's thanks to all this that we have a roof over our heads. - Yes, on mine. - What do you mean, on yours? On our heads. It's a good roof.
Yes. Sunday night, about 10:45. I was driving to a restaurant on... San Vincente... They have great frozen yogurt... and all of a sudden, a white vehicle, out of nowhere, screeches those tires, it was totally crazy. He ran the red light. Me and another car swerved to avoid running into him, and he honked at me.
And if they call him, we've all seen his file. We'll destroy it. The amount of physical evidence collected is impressive. There's a mountain of it. Frankly, there's more evidence than I've ever seen in a murder trial.
Mark Fuhram. Chris Darden. Take a seat, please. Is Bill Hodgman's office still on this floor? It's upstairs.
Will you bring him to me? Let a brother... I'm trying... to bring it to you. The phone didn't ring. It rang.
And what about her hair? Hi, angel. I knew you were here when I smelled cigarettes. Travis, what are you doing here? When I got home from school, I ate the rest of my lunch, because it was still in my bag, I'd forgotten about it.
Other than the two victims, does this incredibly accurate DNA show match someone else's blood and DNA at the scene of the murders? He did, uh, only one individual. And made this same DNA match blood you find - on the back door at Bundy? - Yes, he did.
What's there to question? They know me. I think... I mean, well... one thing they were wondering was-is about Nicole's blood. How he got in your Bronco.
(grunting). It's a matter of pride. . Yeah, we can take it. . And if the world falls. . He can as well accident with me. .
The defendant's hair was on Bundy's cap. The defendant's hair was on Goldman's shirt. The glove found in Rockingham contains fibers that match Ron's hair. The glove contains fibers that match Nicole's hair. Nicole's blood is on the glove.
The defendant's hair was on Goldman's shirt. The glove found in Rockingham contains fibers that match Ron's hair. The glove contains fibers that match Nicole's hair. There's Nicole's blood. There's Ron's blood.
The glove found in Rockingham contains fibers that match Ron's hair. The glove contains fibers that match Nicole's hair. There's Nicole's blood. There's Ron's blood. There's the defendant's blood.
Don't turn your back on me, Jorah the Andal. I didn't dismiss you. You swore an oath to me. You swore to obey my orders. I command you to find the cure. Wherever on earth it may be.
The city has come back to life. - You made a pact with the fanatics. - And it worked. If you shave with a straight razor, the razor will work. That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat.
I did. And now you have to realize his seed at the Bloodfire. I do. According to the Codex, the Ellcrys must be satisfied with your commitment to this quest. If you pass the test, he'll give you the seed.
- Tell us your name. - Bandon. He's either hiding magic or he doesn't know he has it. The Ellcrys called me. When I touched the tree, it showed me horrible visions of the future.
Is that what you meant about Amberle? Before she submitted to the Ellcrys, you said something terrible would happen if I didn't go with her. When you touched Amberle, did you see anything like this? Yes, this symbol. It was in the room where they died.
But the Ellcrys didn't choose him. He chose you. Ever since we left, you've treated me like an enemy. - The tree said we should... - I know what it said.
We'll rest up when we get to Mermiddon. Am I the only one who thinks staying the course is a bad idea? - What are you talking about? - That demon at the fortress? He knew we were coming.
This is no place for elves. We have an urgent mission on the orders of King Eventine Elessedil. Then it's an honor to welcome such esteemed guests. I'm afraid the passage we sought was destroyed two winters ago. It collapsed in an avalanche.
I'm going to fuck you, and you're going to leave. - You're not sleeping here. - That's no problem. I found this rug while surfing the Internet. It'd look great in your living room.
Please, sir. It's too hot in this town. [journalist] Mr. Mayor, did you enjoy the match? I love "footballe". Please stop saying "footballe".
Damn it! Mr. Mayor? You're not answering your cell phone. Your wife. I don't even know where my cell phone is.
Yes, just a second. Come on in. This is the kitchen. - The wallpaper is oppressive. - It's great.
I feel better. It's like living in another city. They're beautiful. I've got a present too. It's in this bag.
I don't want you to worry, Abby, until we know something. We know there's a kill order. You people are fat on these. Indra: It's not a kill order.
We know there's a kill order. You people are fat on these. Indra: It's not a kill order. It's a bounty.
- So why a cop standing for hours, waiting to get frozen? She wouldn't. Which means your suspect wasn't using liquid nitrogen. He was using supercooled liquid helium. It's one of the most effective substances in the world for rapid temperature reduction.
It is one of the world's most effective substances for rapid temperature reduction. Where do you get this liquid helium? - Why do you need it? - It doesn't, dummy. He just wants to know where it comes from so we can find the guy this damned our colleague with it.
Of course it is. It's for my health. Your heart? I have a hole in it. And it's still growing, apparently.
hmmm. Overdone. Oh. Try the other piece. It's much more tender.
I'll bet Strange keeps it in the secret laboratory where he created Azrael. But Stange runs Arkham. He's seen it every day. The lab must be accessible from Arkham. You think it's underground.
But Stange runs Arkham. He's seen it every day. The lab must be accessible from Arkham. You think it's underground. It has to be.
Chairs, desks, printers, pens. But we have to sneak them out, we need a distraction. Okay, here's what I'm thinking. We give the dog chocolate. It dies.
Got milk? Not a stranger in sight. It's so beautiful. I've never seen the copycat so happy. He knows.
We received an anonymous gift basket. It's full of goodies. There are meats, cheeses, candies, all the food families. The cheese is amazing. It melts in my mouth, and in my hands.
I wanted a simple, no-nonsense video of the police station, and you added the one ingredient I didn't: panache. Panache is who I am. Would you ask the sky not to be so blue? - Yes, I'd like it to be brown.
I'm showing my future baby how to kick some ass. Okay, Cortez, time for your appointment. No thanks, I'm fine. No, you're not. It's your uterus. It's about to explode.
- What's it like to be a mom at 16? - Who wants coffee? I'd love some. Don't make it too strong. Last time it was awful.
Do you really want to hear this? Boring. - Mom, where's the coffee? - Over there, darling. It's not where it's supposed to be.
- Mom, where's the coffee? - Over there, darling. It's not where it's supposed to be. It's always a mess in here! - There it is.
Think about it. And you'll find the answer. What does it mean? Your body might give in. And if it expires, you'll be stuck in that cat for the rest of your life.
They had more to lose and fewer ways to protect themselves. I thought I was in the same situation, but now I'm not so sure. It's natural, when you get power, to believe it has no limits. Believe me, it does.
Then you have a herniated cervix. A hollowness? Your cervix may not be strong enough to carry a pregnancy to term. As the baby grows, the cervix widens. If the muscles are weak, the cervix may open prematurely.
You get to see him outside when I'm not there and I'll never see him like this. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Here. I can't believe Abbie gave you this book. It's interesting.
- No. - No. Really? - Yeah, nothing. Looks like it. There's this dumb movie.
Where you at, nigga? Nigger? Get out here! Mr. Constantine just wants his money back. I couldn't find him. He must have gone out the other side.
It's not healthy here. Hi, I'm looking for my cat. - When did the beast disappear? - It's not a beast, it's my cat. His name is Grandpa and...
But we're going to need two more bottles. Of course we will. Right away, sir. Find out where that damn package is. I'll send it over as soon as it arrives.
[Indistinct conversations] [Coughing] [Crows cawing] I can't do funerals either. Everything there is a reason for, it's all part of God's plan."
That's not necessary. It's just some, uh, street psych. We're done here. You said he had a knife. Did you see what it looked like?
You said he had a knife. Did you see what it looked like? Kind of crude, like an object. Did any numbers carved on the handle? He was coming at me kind of fast.
Here. You know, there always comes a time when all your work... separately only autumn. Never go away. I had a real boat once. Plow it capsized in the Caymans.
An advert for a holiday in Goa. That's all I keep looking at all the time, without even winking. Because I think it's one of my good times. And that day will come. And when it does, I'll ask it...
And it's thanks to this girl. Since I met her, I no longer need cocaine. I've regained my power of seduction. My power of seduction. It's back!
- Dead. - Really? Yeah. He was the one with that weird mole on his shoulder. He was going to have it removed. He got hit by a bus.
You know, you haven't changed a bit. Do you think so? In myself, I think I really have changed, and for the better. I heard about your wedding. And how it ended?
You can. "The Being within me is consumed, "shooting flames from the dreams." Come, Alejandro. Look at it! It's a unique being. It's so beautiful!
Your coat... Your skirt... Your shirt... Your blouse... My love wanders the streets I don't know when he'll return
What you need to do is study, get a degree and a teaching job, like me. Don't compromise your future, Alejandro! Butterflies don't have to turn into flies, and poets don't have to turn into teachers. I'm a teacher, and I don't turn into a fly. The world is what it is.
Ibáñez at the Palais will give the sweep! You'll see that everything is a lie You'll see that nothing is love And the world doesn't care It turns, it turns
I forgive you, Jaime. You gave him the strength to endure this world where poetry no longer exists. Recognize your father. Take off his mask. He's not an appearance, he's a being!
This trophy belongs to Kenneth Allen. I saw several behind his desk. One was missing. That one. Why would Garrett steal a meaningless trophy? Because it's important to him.
Like how many bullets were in the gun, and how many were fired. I could have used just one to kill that idiot, but I used four. I emptied it. Rather clever to pretend the gun is loaded. But it's empty.
You hung up on one of our friends. That's not my phone. I swear I've never seen it. You should use it to call a lawyer. Like I said, my client never had that cell phone in her life until it rang in her drawer.
Because I was stupid. Your superior told you to bring back some drugs you'd seized. That's all he told me. Is this the only copy of the evidence report? Yes, I emptied it before it went into the system.
What's the problem? The speedometer is out of order. Why is it vibrating? It's the autopilot. What's it doing?
It's not just the Garde Rouge. Part of Paris has become unmanageable. Thieves, brigands, pimps who describe themselves as shopkeepers. As long as they pay their taxes, their business remains their problem. Even if it involves extortion, murder?
OK, if we save JFK, then, wouldn't there have been Vietnam? Johnson is the one who made things worse with Vietnam. If Kennedy had lived, it wouldn't have happened like that. All those boys... would have lived. Al, I understand, but changing the past the way you think it should be just seems...
The most beautiful in temporary housing companies. [Chuckles] You can't wait to see it. Maybe I should leave HHM. Get on that D M the cushy train. It's very plush.
Um... Actually, uh, I might have found something in the initial information. Oh yeah? Schweikart and Cokely keep referring to the "optional quota program," but I checked a number of resident contracts. Not a single one opted out, which makes me think it's more of a mandatory financial arrangement.
Schweikart and Cokely keep referring to the "optional quota program", but I checked a number of resident contracts. Not a single one opted out, which makes me think it's more of a mandatory financial arrangement. And you think this is the "failure to claim" they filed in their response? They keep saying it's optional, this voluntary.
Not a single one chose to opt out, which makes me think it's more of a mandatory financial arrangement. And you think that's what the "failure to claim" they filed in their response? They keep saying it's optional, this voluntary. I think we can counter this if "opting in" is a residency requirement, which it seems sure to be, thus, their voluntary claims don't hold water.
Dutch apple-butt. Guys, I'm not a native English speaker here? What the hell is a squat cobbler?! It is when a man is sitting in the pie!
So, let's say you and Steve go to dinner at, uh... well, Birdie's. That's where you're all headed today, right? [All murmuring] Okay. So you both have an excellent meal. It's the chicken-fried steak and green beans, and it's all perfect.
Every line starting with 7700 has been redirected to the reliever pen, plus your desk. All assistants know how to keep them open. So, if you're on a call and another call comes in, the call doesn't go to an answering machine, right? Because ... very important ... older people don't like talking to robots. If I'm on a call and another call comes in, it'll roll over to Maida.
It's probably a long shot, given your selectivity. What's the job? I asked. Guy wouldn't tell me. But whatever it is, it's serious money.
Yeah, okay, sure. [Pssst! Dad, come here! Get over here! Dad, it's a scam, like that bum from last week.
Straight up, lift with your kneess. JIMMY: What does the evev mean... "to lift the knees"? I don't know. It's something people say in sweats.
KIM: What about you? [Sighs] No more commercial. I don't want to exaggerate, but I think it might be the longest 60 seconds in television history.
Send. Hit. Bull's-eye. You should keep this ammunition with 168-grain hollow-point warheads. If it's a clear shot.
I've got some. What I sell to my customers who, in a moment of passion, decide to poison their enemies, is bitter cascara. The effects are almost immediate. The stomach tries to purge itself, and... Well, you see. The enemy seems to suffer, but doesn't die.
Will this magic stone protect me? Some call it nature, others call it magic. I certainly charge more for the latter, but for you, madam, it's free. What do you think of my new toy? I think it's wonderful.
He'll take your child away from you, but he can also kill you. But what other choice do I have? Do you want this baby? Of course I do. It's my lover's.
But what other choice do I have? Do you want this baby? Of course I do. It's my lover's. It's his and mine. He's...
I must congratulate you. I wish you and the Marquis all the happiness in the world. Thank you, Your Highness. Of course, the world is not always a happy place. It's even rather unpredictable.
Well, well, well. Oh, my God! FRANK: I can't stand that punk. Where's the rent, Frank? In my pocket, and it'll stay there until you get the plumbing fixed.
- No, not yet. - No. We want your gold. Where is it? It's at the foot of the rainbow.
I couldn't stand her. - Oh... shit. - What the fuck? She didn't put the cork back in. - Is it really open? - Well, yeah.
The last few years have been pretty rough for me, and now I live in a women's shelter, so... Yeah, I figured that. Cause that's the worst. Is the apartment still available or not? Yeah, it's definitely available.
Why is that? I know the number is really, really big, but the check is real. Are you sure that... It's a real check. No, it's backdated.
No, man, what I do is art. And you know what else? I think I should shoot 'em. Yeah. I mean, guys, I'd be crazy not to ride this erotic wave that our culture is on, film them, make the next Fifty Shades of Grey, in my style, you know? My movie would be realistic, it would be tasteful, it would be...
I think I should film them. Yeah. I mean, guys, I'd be crazy not to ride this erotic wave that our culture is on, film them, make the next Fifty Shades of Grey, in my style, you know? My film would be realistic, it would be tasteful, it would be... it would be subtle.
You see, art is an ambiguous thing, yeah? Yeah, just because you make art, doesn't mean you're an artist. But it also means you're an artist. But does that mean that art is good art? Or is art good just because the right people say it's good?
Nobody talks to me. MAC: No, Dee. That's not a very good idea. You know, when my father was in solitary confinement, I used to write to him every day to see how he was doing.
Mr. Meir, can we say you're an expert? I'd say so. Do you understand this bird? Yes. Ask him if he attacked Liam!
You plug it into the socket... What's up? They give me an English model. Doesn't it work? It works, but you need an adapter.
That's true. That's true. Why don't we go to the table? The priest hasn't arrived yet. We're waiting for him. Why isn't he here yet?
Did you? Yes, I took its size. And who'd you give it to? Someone. And what size was it?
Come on, Sandra. What, Sandra? You're friends now? You took his number? He's messing up Dad's memorial!
Sebi's got the suit on, he's in the kitchen. You're coming, right? I agree. Without strict laws, the citizen is not protected. What if it's a criminal state?
We're fighting to protect Nassau, and our best weapon is the fear we inspire in our enemies. Everything depends on that gold, and it's sleeping right now in an undefended, ruined fort.
And who is more powerful? The one who created the storm or the one who convinced us to beat it? For a man with his abilities, his state of mind becomes reality. We are subject to it. And right now his state of mind is so dark, it threatens to kill us all.
Spain may be appeased, but the street is always an open question. If you want me to help you play the game, I need to know where the players are. I see. And when do you think the game will start? It's already started.
But I'm afraid I've forgotten a critical step, something I'm not ready to do. What step? We need to change our names. Eventually, money will protect itself It will hire guards, it will make us friends, it will protect itself with investments and partners, but as long as it's in its current form, it's as vulnerable as a newborn baby
In what way? It doesn't have to last long. A little Spanish bullet. It hit me when I was barely older than him. From time to time it migrates, moving further forward to reach its terminus and strike the chime.
Out of curiosity, how would she do that? Well, I have no idea. Absolutely anything in her power, I imagine, right down to of course walking down the middle of the road in front of us to get trampled by your horses in the hope of getting you to slow down a bit for a short while. It's fascinating to me how people expect the most unlikely of results from your stubbornness because you prefer them. You hope the world becomes what you want it to be, despite all the evidence and experience to the contrary.
Debts that now, according to him, were mine. Debts I couldn't even hope to repay. Debts for which this man would have me imprisoned... imprisoned in a place where debts would only be paid off by hard work. Hard work without pay, working at... hold on to yourself... textile production. "You people are incapable of accepting the world as it is."
I'll have to learn to master that. That'll do. What kind of cop are you? Sorry, I'm the sheriff. You just want to use my computer? It's got Internet, right? Yes.
Why are you suspicious? I saw your taillight. Saying things like that doesn't help. Your car, the light. It's broken.
Who is it? Who... Who do they think did it? Stahl didn't give any details, but he gave me the money... and told me to put it back. Where is this? Well, they think it's at your boat, but I double-bagged it and moved it.
Who... Who do they think did it? Stahl didn't give any details, but he gave me the money... and told me to put it back. Where is this? Well, they think it's at your boat, but I double-bagged it and moved it. It's in an abandoned building in Maspeth.
Do you want me to put it back in the box? No. Use the vacuum cleaner. Where's the bag? There isn't one.
I came to win the big prize at the Juste Prix. Well, that's just great. I hope you'll be invited to play. That's for sure. My Supreme did a little something to my ticket, it's bewitched.
I've passed the torch, and I feel fulfilled. But it's a practical decision, not an emotional one. This is our home. Frankly, it's the only one we've got. None of us knows what awaits us beyond this place if it's demolished.
The only thing he still lacks is time. Age. 23rd August 2026. It will be 100 years since this hotel was built. On that day, it will earn its rightful distinction as a historic site.
The stores on Rodeo Drive and Fifth Avenue? They've closed the couture division. Perfumes and sunglasses keep the rest afloat. And you matter in this world, you know. As long as he lives and your son feeds, you're important.
Give. "Muggers predicts I'll have a nice scar after the last game." I sure hope not. "Thanks for the wool vest." "It's very warm.
How about I take Sophie tomorrow, and we spend the day together? If you're gonna do this, you better do it right. Cause I'm not gonna let you disappoint us again. No worries. You like your sandwich? It's gross.
When Hap and I were married, he'd talk about this old bridge over Marvel Creek. My dad used to take me fishing there, well, when he could. There are a lot of stories about that bridge. A lot of bad stuff has happened there over the years. The local kids say it's haunted.
- This woman died of boredom. - What's wrong? That's impossible. A person can't die of boredom. A person can't die of boredom. It can happen, but it's rare... when a person listens to something completely devoid of interest, the brain becomes hungry for stimulation, and it starts to eat itself.
Yeah, I mean, dildos seem a little redundant, right? Because you already have a dildo josh. - What's that one? - This one is super complete. It's curved to stimulate your G-spot, and it's got a mini vibrator for your clit or anus.
I'm gonna go catch Kyle. Oh, actually, I was thinking maybe tonight it could just be the two of us. Tonight, it's you and me. So, what do we need this thing for? It's just helping me.
- You, too. Bobby, I can't make it tonight. Something came up. An emergency. Let's reschedule. But I had prepared everything, opened the wine so it could breathe.
There, a manager and an educator will assess her needs. She'll be able to go to high school if she wants to. I don't care what you do, think or say. The only one who's honest is Paul. He's the only one I'll listen to. The only one who sees the world as it really is.
I don't have any money. Why are you here? You don't have to tell me. I twisted my sister's arm. So hard it broke.
Do you have a problem with that? No. I'm very open-minded. Got this close to voting for Obama. Hey, where's the shotgun? Oh, it's in the trunk.
Or not. Who cares? What's wrong with you? We published a book about your life. I mean, doesn't it mean something to you?
The creation of synthetic DNA was the simple half of the equation. The other half is where it gets complicated. Like magicians, we tricked the neural network into accepting our nanotechnology and letting it implant itself. Then, during the incubation period, the nanotechnology introduces its own language and commands. The organism's growth rate gradually accelerates in response to the new stimuli, which it then reproduces.
As you know, Morgane was our third attempt. Our first term subject developed internal organs on the outside. It's not working. The pulse is dropping. He died shortly after birth, if you can call it that.
You know the difference between good and evil. That's at the heart of every superhero story. I think you were supposed to be a hero. Mericle: If you look at where we are in the world, it's very unpredictable, but it's also, I think, had a lot scarier for people.
Rip Hunter. I'm from East London. Kreisberg: ...who came in time to recruit a very specific group of people. I know it's hard for you to understand, but in the future, none of you are heroes. What makes our show unique is that it's a motley crew.
Of course, it's a good idea to leave these two unattended on a time machine? The scope of "Legends of Tomorrow" is as big as anything I've ever worked on television. All your worlds are about to change. Because the show can go anywhere in human history... in our future, in our past, it has high-stakes adventures.
The scope of "Legends of Tomorrow" is as big as anything I've ever worked on television. All your worlds are about to change. Because the show can go anywhere in human history... in our future, in our past, it has high-stakes adventures. Each of these characters could have had their own show, but, at the same time, it's even bigger than any of them could have individually.
- Yes, in Laurel Canyon. - Yes, that's the one. Patrol found a body in the trunk of a car. Must have been there two days. If you ask me, it's pretty ripe.
Let's see what Mr. Hagen keeps here. I understand that you and Mr. Hagen published an article last year on the St. Mary's coral reef. Well, that's very gratifying. Did you read it in the national press at the time? No, but it concerns our survey.
And we've been seeing Shapiro for the last two hours, so focus! Someone claiming to be Veronica Deane had us steal a diskette to blackmail the real Veronica Deane. And paid us off with a phony check for $100,000 that... - What are you doing? - You said it was bogus!
You call him by his first name? And I'm really sorry about the dogs. This thing unlocks. Can't dial a number. Because it's not...
It's extortion! Think of the alternative! He has no choice. I'll pay you, but the money's not at my place. It's... It's Tom's, it's Bill's, etc, etc, etc.
Nothing. Back off, Krieger, with your human breast milk! OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. Holy... But he's not human!
- She's efficient, isn't she? - "You're going to look at the numbers"! I'm sure the president of one of the most powerful groups on the hill is honored that Her Majesty agreed to look at the damn numbers! What on earth were you thinking? - The system is so porous it's taking on water.
Why are we going to lose? - For every dollar we spend on this campaign, you know how much the gun lobby spends? 38. - Politicians obey money. Why should they? It doesn't go into their pockets, that would be corruption.
- I have a goal to reach. As a righteous leftist, you can disdain the means. But you need me. - A goal? It died when you squatted to piss on the flag.
When it comes time to vote on the Heaton-Harris bill, I hope that every member of Congress will follow not my example, but the example of the group of people sitting behind me, who have made very great sacrifices I hope that these members of Congress will not use this vote to further their political careers, but will instead vote for what they believe is in the best interest of the country. But I know that these hopes are vain and that such a thing is impossible. Because our system is rotten. It doesn't reward honest politicians who vote their conscience.
It is my hope that these members of Congress will not use this vote to further their political careers, but rather vote for what they believe is in the best interest of the country. But I know that these hopes are vain and that such a thing is impossible. Because our system is rotten. It doesn't reward honest politicians who vote their conscience. It rewards... the corrupt, who are ready to sell their country to get their piece of the pie.
As soon as he was discovered, I had him hunted down and killed. I prefer peace... but if we have enemies, they will be slaughtered without mercy. Show the body. Bring him in. He's in human form.
- I'm fine, thank you. Your smell says you're sick. I've seen you. You picked one up. May I see it? Why would it be the end of the world if it opened?
Thank you, Felix. Please leave us. - Are you out of your mind? - You took my money? You stole that money from my strip club. It didn't belong to you.
Yes. Give me 15 minutes. Sugar, where's my computer? - Where you left it. - It won't come by itself.
How does your alien DNA protect you - from this weapon? - I don't know how. The alien DNA must encode something that targets the CAS-9 protein. It must somehow disable the weapon.
Thank you, Mr. Pell. Mr. Pell, can I talk to you for a second? Of course, of course. I'd like to reopen the dialogue regarding the office manager position. After taking everything... everything into consideration, I realize I'd love to take the job again if it's still available.
That was his right. I have to go to gate BA 109! The gate closed 20 minutes ago. Has the plane taken off? It won't be long now.
How can I believe you? Kara saved me from an unhonorable death. As a loyal soldier, you must understand. Kara was attacked by a telepathic parasite, the Black Mercy. It put her in a coma.
You know all about books, authors and locations. I'm waiting to publish my book. Great! What's it about? It's a children's book, but it's not... how can I put this... there's no story yet.
- So, this guy... he was worrisome. His apartment was so small... That's just New York property. You can't judge someone by the smallness of their apartment. There was a purple couch... It was purple.
- That would be one. Would you stop copying me? Here's your fish. You see it? It's dead.
What is it? I can't do any more than I have. - It's Horvath. - What about my important work? He's not going away.
And it's not Allen's. It could be anybody's. The guy who services his car. DNA? They're trying to isolate it, but it's very degraded.
Why start a losing battle? Because Orus is dead. And father, devastated. Because of you. Eventually, your body will adapt. It will relax, and the milk will flow.
It's too late for that. Every woman is different. Let's not lie to each other, Mother. My body speaks. It says I'm not a mother.
Every woman is different. Let's not lie to each other, Mother. My body speaks. It says I'm not a mother. It speaks for all to hear.
A blurred vision, you know in your hearts. Answer. The vice-regent has not taken control of our capital, our country. Our children's birthright is not out there as Kubilai claims. It's here, on this earth.
He hides in the shadows, keeps a low profile, but with each new life he gets closer to the seat of power, sowing seeds of destruction. Who remembers the name of the man who whispered in Gavrilo Princip's ear, and convinced him to launch the First World War? Why did he do it? What's in it for him? The busier the world is with self-destruction, the less it notices an immortal psychopath in its midst.
One of the most important lessons of time travel is that many things cannot be changed. Time wants to happen. Chronos and Vandal won't be the only enemies we fight. More often than not, it will be time itself. No matter what happens, we'll change time, erase Savage's future, and earn our rightful place in history.
He had trouble walking. So he pedaled. We're ready to go. I looked for Grandpa's bike. Isn't it in the shed?
Why do you want goats? You're doing this to me. Goat cheese is good for the brain, Oli. I'll spoil the cheese. It has to be fresh.
Most of the time, yes. You know how it goes. Everything's beautiful at first, and then the relationship starts to squeeze and destroy everything around it. I think it's horrible, so I stop and it's over. Marriage can be nice, but there's no predetermined beginning or end, and that bothers me.
I enjoyed our precious time today. I haven't taken my pants off in front of a woman in a while. I'm sorry the pretzel fell. It was unexpected. Honestly, I don't know how long it had been in my underwear. and it was confusing for me.
We come from a dying world. We travel the universe from planet to planet, driven by solar winds. We adapt and survive. THE ANIMATED SERIES, 1973 Captain, I found this device on my console. It doesn't seem to have any useful function and...
When I was out there... with them... when it was over... when I knew we'd taken the town back... I had this feeling. It took me a moment to remember what it was... because I hadn't felt it since I woke up in that hospital bed. I want to show you the new world, Carl. I want it to be a reality for you.
Oh, that's so sweet, Nick. But you know I'm not going to jail, right? As long as you're free here, you're never in jail. I got you this disposable from an anonymous store in Koreatown. I think it's small enough for you to hide in the elastic of your panties.
Do you have any recommendations? Yes, sir, I do. Have you read that book Catcher in the Rye? Yes, sir, I have. Do you think it should be in the library?
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on! It's going to be hard to figure out what's in this... Gin or vodka? I'm sure it's a subtle blend, so let's not judge too quickly.
And the other time? The ninth! We're in Hawkins, right? Worst thing that's happened in the four years I've been working here? An owl attacked Eleanor Gillespie's head. Mistook it for a nest.
I went upstairs to change into dry clothes. The next day, you went back and... you think you saw a bear? I don't know what it was, but... I think it... I think it took Barbara.
- How can I help you? I forgot my hat. I'll just be a minute. I love this book. It's so twisted. You can't go in there.
- But I repeat, it's... - In theory. What if this portal already existed? We'd know if it did. It would disrupt gravity, the magnetic field, our environment.
- In theory. What if this portal already existed? We'd know if it did. It would disrupt gravity, the magnetic field, our environment. And it might even swallow us.
The direction can be changed with a magnet. If there's a stronger magnetic field, it deflects the needle. And then there's what Mr Clarke said. The portal would be so powerful... It would disrupt the field.
But she doesn't hunt in a pack. She's always alone... like a bear. And remember at Steve's, when Barbara cut herself? - And then, last night, the deer... - It was bleeding, too.
And you're a loser. Go sell Buicks or aluminum, it's all the same. Zak... We'll cut costs, tighten our belts. This buyout isn't just about you.
What are you talking about? We have to eliminate the Director. What's that? This building is like a bunker. It's impossible to get in. The security codes change every hour and there's an army of guards.
Elizabeth, tell us about the weather up north. Have you ever experienced this heat? Elizabeth. Bernadette was asking you about the weather up north. Ah yes, well, it's hot.
Really? Yes, at Bobby Flay's restaurant. We're meeting him to talk about his new cookbook. So it's a business dinner. Are you suggesting that I thought it was something more?
Look, all I'm asking is that you put in a good word for me with your goddess of a roommate. Because she's being picky and it's really hard to... What? No, no, no, we've got to keep up. It's just been posted on two other sites, and, oh, my God, it's got a nickname now.
- Oh, my goodness. You know who would love this? Hector and Dorff. They could put it in their flagship store. It opens in a few days.
I wasn't. You're still my assistant Liza. And the way you treat my colleagues reflects on me. I understand, Liza. Be back in 40 minutes with a mixed salad, and if the dressing room isn't on your way...it will be.
It's a pretty standard agreement. And we even have a clause in there that gives you approval of the style of the actual book. - I asked for it. - That's great. Yes. I think it's important that there's a handmade feel.
Terry Gross owns the house next door to ours in Vermont. Oh, my God. You crashed into him at the syrup festival? We had a horse. Until he ran away.
You don't scare me. Don't do that. I'll send a team tomorrow morning. We need to recover the control unit. We found the runaway. He didn't get there by chance.
He didn't do anything to us, even if he did act strangely. He smashed his head with a stone. It's possible that this was due to the Good Samaritan reflex. It's also possible that Behavior provides this kind of explanation to avoid admitting that he screwed up. Do we know why he deviated from his plot?
Why do you care? Have you ever heard of a man named Arnold? He was the first to settle in the area. He created a world where you could do anything, except one thing. You can't die. This world may seem real, but it's still just a game.
He already has. Weren't you warned? That won't be necessary, not anymore. Join the others. Tell the board that my script will be completed on time, and that this is not a retrospective. As you all feared.
One day, we took him to the park. Our father had warned us that he was fast. But we couldn't resist. My brother took off his leash. Just then, the dog spotted a cat. It must have looked like a piece of felt.
In front of everyone's astonished eyes, he killed the little cat. He tore it to pieces. Then he sat down, distraught. That dog had spent his whole life trying to catch that thing. He didn't know what else to do.
You can answer: I was helping Behavior. Or: I'm a necrophiliac pervert. It's up to you. Five minutes, then it's off to the incinerator.
Arnold's. He said Jock was a killer. That he couldn't help it, that he'd been created that way. That I could help him. Help him? If he died, he could do no more harm.
Someone is waiting for you at home. It all seems so unreal. I thought the park was all about... indulging our baser instincts. Now I understand. It doesn't release the worst in us, but reveals our deepest selves.
It all seems so unreal. I thought the park was all about... pandering to our baser instincts. Now I understand. It doesn't release the worst in us, but reveals our deepest selves. It shows us for what we are.
We flaunt it to attract a partner. Art, literature, Mozart, Shakespeare, Michelangelo and the Empire State Building... It's not so bad that we've accomplished so much for trivial reasons. But the peacock has trouble flying. He spends his life on the ground, pecking at insects in the manure, with his great beauty as his only comfort.
It's our duty, I suppose. Let's not disappoint our precious sister-in-law. I find her annoying sometimes, don't you? Maybe it's the accent. It gets on your nerves a bit.
We don't know yet. He sent you to make friends with me? Let's put it this way. Your husband's support would do him no harm. But understand that my prince loves the world as it was.
Personally, I'd rather be swallowed up by the earth than accept anything from you. But you're gobbling it up right now. That tea in your hand... Didn't anyone warn you? It's from my plantation.
- Of course it is. I just looked, and it's gone. - Are you sure? - Quite sure. I distinctly remember it being on my dressing table when I went to bed yesterday.
I'm so happy. I wish I could take you with me. We'll always be together. In our heads. We just need a little time.
- Yes? Yes, thank you. What have I done now? - That suit looks good on you. - It's as old as these mountains.
In fact, it's a cut of the female reproductive system. Not to worry. I went to med school for a year before taking care of Blake. Sexy doctor. This is a penis. When a man is sexually aroused, the penis gorges itself with blood and when erect, it can penetrate the vagina.
Go for it! It's more fluid. Even if you increase your power, the fluidity will make you go faster. That's true. The mind has to make a transition from one state to another. Sometimes it resists.
- On the bone. It's the tendon. It's tendovaginitis. The tendon is affected, as is the ligament. The tendon is still swollen, and the sheath where it slides is also swollen, which is what causes the pain. Treatment is required.
They'll turn old buildings into beautiful condos. - What's the problem? - My mother. The shelter is in this district. It meant a lot to my mother.
Next time you say that people find solutions, remember that your mother was one of them. Holy crap! What the hell is that? My macaroni and cheese! It would have been disgusting.
Gary. Let me explain. I've been doing this since before you were born. What I heard at the bat mitzvah was pure talent. Gary Giombetta, you'll remember this melon as your first meal as an American Century artist. My album, it would open like...
Maybe I left it at home. Because I'm cool, I want to be unplugged. Of course you do. Leave The Matrix. Can you come with me, see if he's there?
- Yes. Is it a C.D. mix? Yes. Did you go to 1998? No, my computer is very old, so it can burn CDs.
Don't get hung up on the past. Unless the past isn't really the past. Sometimes the past is the future. Like this sofa. It's familiar, comfortable.
Unless the past isn't really the past. The past is sometimes the future. Like this sofa. It's familiar, comfortable. It loves us.
The past is sometimes the future. Like this sofa. It's familiar, comfortable. It loves us. Maybe it deserves a second chance.
I'm close. Why would he let them implant something in his cheek? They said it was a biometric study. A dentist inserted this little bit of grit, and now... He's getting more and more.
"My driveway isn't lit." He says, "Wimp! "Connie wants to watch this, we'll watch this." Okay. We watch The Conjuring. The movie had the effect I thought it would, it really scared me.
no. It's quite a collection. Do you like this sort of thing? - No, I'm fine, thanks. - There's plenty.
What I'm saying is... We'll kill you if you sing What? I didn't win an Emmy, but it's time to move on But... Winter won't come He has come
Where are you, Galavant? Those pirates were a bit brusque with me, weren't they? Stop talking. Are you still angry about the shipwreck? Seriously, what's the point of the past if it can't be past?
Which means she got what she wanted. No. Abbie. Abbie. I can feel her pulse. It's very weak.
Les Portes du Paradis? No, not yet. At least not yet. Have you ever heard of the phoenix? Yes, a magical bird. When it dies, it bursts into flames, and another one rises from its ashes.
It's a waiting room between life and death. I am called. No, we started this journey together, we'll finish it together. My journey is not over. And for a Witness, it never really is.
Today, they only remember the house. I feel there will be another of us on the front pages soon enough, and they'll forget about it. But if lighthouse makes them try and pull out... We can't let that happen. If lighthouse pulls its $1.5 billion, it goes public.
Close to a rumored $2.5 million position. It looked... Solid. Watching the tele-comm ... this Verizon commercial? He's part of a MacroPlay event-driven.

Guys from her store are preparing their resumes. Well, if it was just smoke, they'd issue a disclaimer... Keep working. Yeah. They're treating this article like it's a warrant.
Not bad. Until... And you were there for it, Chad... Your grandfather asked me to read one putt out of 3. He was a leaker left to right, and I told him so.
Man: Let's get out of here. Mnh! So now the name Axelrod will always be attached to this building for all time. Or until some guy richer than me wants it down.
So, y'all have a nice trip back to SoHo ... and try not to get Jacked. Okay, they got German chocolate, vanilla buttercream, and lemon meringue pie. Now they're specializing. Okay, when in the hell did you ever hear of a birthday cake, Porsha? My grandmother used to make us a peach cobbler every year for our birthday, and it was good, too.
Why are you trying to stir up trouble, man? An eagle is meant to fly. No, it's all positive, really. But I'm currently working on my new single. And it's going to be produced by D-Major.
It's my wedding. She's carrying my baby. Are we crazy? We were supposed to stop the vicious circle. The circle will stop when it's ready to stop.
You have to be careful these days. Like I said, they're after me, not you. Just give me the paperwork and I'll be on my way. Whoever runs these "black agents" must have considerable resources. Before I could break the last phone, it rang.
I thought he would succeed. He said Mount Fuji was beautiful during his flight. Before arriving in San Francisco, the balloon went up too high. So the balloon froze and started to descend. It almost came down to the surface of the ocean.
Don't you remember? Yes. Yes, I do. Has the monster come back? Yes. It's attacked Seoul again.
Has the monster returned? Yes. It's attacked Seoul again. - What is it? - Yes, but it's less serious. This thing appeared, this monster, in the same place, but it just stood there making funny hand gestures. I don't know about that.
Yes. He attacked Seoul again. - What did he do? - Yes, but it's less serious. This thing appeared, this monster, in the same place, but it just stood there making funny hand gestures. I don't know. It destroyed a few buildings, and there were some casualties, but nothing like yesterday.
I'm working. - You're working? - Yes! I've got a job in a bar. It belongs to an old classmate, who hired me part-time. I'm a waitress.

Holy crap! Gloria, you've got to see this! - What's he doing? - He's dancing. He's dancing like...
It's true, it's true! But I don't remember crossing the park... It wasn't even a park then. Can you remember? There was a fenced-in area.
Remember that? There was a fenced-in area. It was a construction site. Yes, with garbage and trees... But there was dirt, not...
- Good heavens. The projection screen is down. The what? The screen. It's still down.
The projection screen is down. What's down? The screen. It's still down. If it stays like this all night, it'll warp.
Tell me... Tell me about it. The dragon... red dragon. I looked at it while the man was on top of me. - It glowed.
I wish I had. I wish I had taken him from you and hurt him, put my fingers around his throat and watched the life leave his little body, slowly. So don't be sorry for what happened to me. I wasn't sorry for a second for what happened to you. The price of coffee isn't what it used to be.
A red dragon. It breathed fire. On me. It's the sunset hitting the northern mountain range and turning it red. It's our red dragon, and for it to breathe fire, the oil refinery just behind it.
I want frosting! I want a big slice. I want frosting. Look, I didn't take that boy's boat. I don't even know how it got there.
Except for an intrusive actress I barely know. What have you got? Multiple myeloma. I battled it at 16, then again at 25. It never went away.
What's wrong? Multiple myeloma. I fought it when I was 16, then again when I was 25. It never went away. On the contrary, it reformed and grew.
This season is always hard for you. Now, wait a minute. We won't tell your father. The treatment was numbing. But it didn't stop the dreams.
I didn't sleep when I should. I didn't warm up when I was cold. That weakened me. But my biggest mistake was believing that with a nice net, I'd only catch nice things. This piece, it's... Russian, isn't it?
Do you have fresh parsley? I'm sure it's perfect already. You're looking at me. I'll get you some parsley. It's in the garden.
I'll be back in a moment. Here, parsley. It smells earthy. I'll eat it when I'm done. "It will never be as good as it is now."
A lot of things don't make sense. AO wouldn't say she was an angel until she disappeared. That's what an angel would do. Homer's trainer once told him, "Knowledge is only rumor until it enters the body."
Lie back. Suck your thumb like a baby. We were lucky. We thought the gas put us to sleep. In fact, it made us docile.
Form filler. That's how they get you. Whatever you want to do in life, you have to fill out a form. There are forms for everything. You fill it out, it goes up, and they make you fill out a new one just to confirm that you filled out the first one.
Can you handle it? How do you think? You think you can find the bird? Yes. I think I know where it is.
Mission accomplished. Let's see how to pay the serfs. Richie's place. Does he have an abacus? It belongs to the company.
Back in the attic. We'll wrap it up and take it away. Classify the formation, bounding overwatch. Never be more than 20 shelter gardens away. It may have a locator.
Mmm, check that membrane at the nape of the neck. We have to cut it open. We don't know what's inside that thing. Yeah, exactly. What if the suit doesn't protect it from us? What if it protects us from it?
Pleasant. Thank you very much. See the launch the other night? Yes. It was different, though, wasn't it?
Yes. It was different, though, wasn't it? Noise. That's very perceptive. What do you think it was?
It was different, though, wasn't it? Noise. That's very perceptive. What do you think it was? Anyway, it's way beyond our comprehension, like, uh, if you were to show a jet engine to someone at the turn of the century.
Kids seem to like it. They go. [What's that noise? It's the wall, above us.
Yeah, I forgot the bag today. [Oh, I don't think so because, you know, it's not just the statutory law, it's the law of civility, man. And I've seen you before. You come out of that building, your dog craps, and you just leave it where it falls.
Of course, let it slide. Here's some dog shit. But those are three little roundabout words. You know, if... if I let your dog shit slide, then I have to be okay with all this place filling with it, which it would be before we knew it. Oh, then it would be on our pant legs and our shoes, and follow us into our homes, then our homes would smell like shit, too.
You think you can tell us: "I'm stopping because I've decided to. - The money's gone. - Where did it go? It went to pay for past shows.
Zheng, our species would be extinct. Humans can be evil. But they can also be good. Love is everywhere. Love is patient. It can be measured in time. It is eternal.
They're trying to fuck me. So, it's like Cynthia. Yes, but more expensive. I'm forced to liquidate my short positions. Someone's trying to push the stock market up, and I need it to go down.
Besides, you heard Violet. If you don't come, she'll strangle me. Very well, then. Our men are on their way to pick up Jane Scott's body from the morgue. It should be there by mid-day.
Their discovery was so dangerous that it destroyed their laboratory. And now they're pretending it never happened. If only you could prove it. Watch the Isodyne film. See for yourself what they're hiding. I've already read the book, and it sucks.
I should have brought my clubs. But I guess you didn't call me to come and play golf. Have you been briefed on the Isodyne situation? I'm crossing the T's on that report as we speak. It will be very politically correct.
No one can. It's a destructive force. Look what it did to me, what it did to you. We can change the world. The world is just fine the way it is.
Spider man. No, he doesn't. He does. I swear he does. He's what makes him big and strong.
How do you guarantee this? Homeland Security talks to your neighbors, letting everyone know hat if something happens o you and your family, everyone will be held personally responsible. Sorry for what? And we've assigned a block captain. He's Patrick and Joanna Hart.
Yeah. So this attacker hrows a bomb into your house and waits for you o run all the way downstairs and grab the fire extinguisher and allows then you get a look at him? You ask me o explain the motivations of a man who was attacking my family? Maybe he wanted you o see him, send a message. Well, if the message was to terrify me, he worked.
Let him be. Now, where is Miss Carter? Has she located Whitney Gel? Uh, the case is almost certain. He's just fine.
Like you were pulling on a thread, and my whole face was unraveling. - I wanted you to make a wish too. - No, I'll be fine. It's like an eyelash growing out of your chin. It's huge!
You're overwhelmed by your emotions. - And you know what that's like. - I know what it's like. You're going to turn away a heart-sick man who's about to go under the knife? My heart's not strong right now. But it knows what it wants.

That voice, huh? I want to work with her. But with all these big names waiting to sign with Highway 65 that would be more lucrative and simple in a way, although Marcus has proven otherwise. There's something about his talent. He's one of a kind.
Remember me? Your sister tried and failed. She told me. When I was in high school, I wrote an article. It was for the school newspaper.
Your sister tried and failed. She told me. When I was in high school, I wrote an article. It was for the school newspaper. It was about the spy planes that were always flying over our community in Dearborn.
What's wrong with him? He wandered off where he wasn't supposed to. He broke his leg. Same as yours. I found him in a drainage ditch, drinking sewage.

You look wonderful. How are you feeling? My collar's a little tight. Oh, no, no, no. It's perfect.
Who is this man? Mr. Smitrovich takes photos for our newsletter. Our understanding of historical events allows us to exert power over others. Your studio, for example, is an instrument of pure capitalism. As such, it represents the contradictions of capitalism and can be used to bring about its own destruction.
I'm not saying that only authors are exploited. Look at you, Baird. The studio takes good care of me. What are you, a child? I think what Herschel means is that even if the studio owns the means of production, it shouldn't be able to pocket the money, our money, the fruits of our labor, and pay us a pittance.
Onwards and upwards. We can't let them catch us. I can't stand the pressure. Kid, I'm sorry! I'm screwing up this stupid stop sign before it hurts someone else.

The family who owned it moved here in the '30s. The state turned it into a historical museum. Every elementary school in the area came here for field trips. The place worked for a long time before anyone built around it. I think people came here because they assumed it would continue to function after the world fell apart.
Maybe a weapons locker, an armory OK. We get there, secure the armory, that's how we end up. That's how Carol ended up here. But we don't know if they have an arsenal or where it is yet.

Bobbi and May, we've been set up. We need Coulson and Talbot out of there now. Before we vote, I'd like to thank Dr. Lundwall for helping us better understand Inhumans. Yes. If the vote is passed and the sanctuary state is approved, it will largely be each ...
Then I'm going to have to take this out on you. Hunter, what's going on? They got Talbot's son. - What? - I'm pretty sure he's him... in one of those gel cubes from the matrix.
And maybe things are getting out of control because it's our time. Do you think it was Lash's time? Was it his birthright? Don't you think Dr. Garner would have liked to have had a choice? All I know is that if the government got their hands on a vaccine, it won't be choice.
She's going to bring these Shadowhunters with her. They're not going to go beyond the front door. Even if they do, we far outnumber them. Have you ever tasted Chassombre blood? [It's divine.
I need to examine the area. According to my research, it's an onryo, a Japanese vengeance demon. Usually associated with the spirit of an abused woman, but this one seems to feed on despair. The locator spell I cast must have drawn him to the area. And it focused on me because of my... emotional state.
They've just found another body with the same marks. A hitchhiker. Further north on Route 10. That's even farther from town. If this onryo is really driven by desperation, he should probably go to a more populated area.
He was a math wizard. A math athlete. But your reactors are cold. I stand corrected. We had 200 assemblies in the reactor, it's now empty.
Or someone. Tillet, why don't we go fishing? Your hunch was right. Our men found a bloated body in the bay a kilometer off the coast. He must not have been in the water long.
See that? Nice colors. I hate it. I think I hate it too. It's awkward to have the Confederate flag at the White House after the drama in South Carolina, even if it does sink.

We're live from Astro-X HQ in Prescott, Arizona, where the 1st sharknada in 5 years has just hit. That's right, Nathalie, but what everyone's wondering is why are these storms coming back now? Previous Sharknados were made of water, but the one in Las Vegas was made of sand, a sand-nado? Nathalie, to be precise, it's a "shark-sand-nado". And when the hurricane destroyed the Hoover Dam, it drew stones from the desert to form what you might call a Roche-nado.
And I'm not going to let them raise my kids on a bus powered by human poo. [This bus produces 30% fewer emissions than a diesel bus. You know what it produces?
What other one was a lie? Oh. Okay. Here it goes.
Good luck with that, buddy. I woke up this morning and had a kale smoothie. You woke up and had a sleeve of Pop-Tarts and a package of bacon. I like my odds. It was low sodium Canadian bacon.

Don't ask exactly, Jax. Sensational. Carter is dead, Kendra is as close o joining him, and Vandal Savage is still alive and out there doing God knows what, and all you can think of is stealing some diamond? He's an emerald.
I think I've determined a more efficient way to accumulate the fragments still inside Mrs. Saunders. Next time you'll be better prepared. There won't be a next time. Can't you fix the suit? It's not the suit.

You there! What the hell are you doing? This bracelet isn't for playing with. What's it for? You know... what it means.
We're going to find out who committed the murders. At least, according to Clayton. I'd need that injunction to get the names of the cartel, at least, with that, we could go after the biker gang. You think they'll come back for the diamond? It's priceless.
But thank you. Gabriel Franks wanted to have the Blue Eye diamond resized for resale. But your father stopped him, didn't he? No, my father loved that diamond. He had it under his spell.
What exactly are you and your boss asking me, Police Officer Orwell? We're asking for your cooperation. That's sweet. But I think I'm asking for a little more than that.

I'm delighted that it's still working. Several colleagues and I hold the patent on the prototype, which we designed over 10 years ago. The technology is now found on volcanoes all over the world, and has revolutionized the way we monitor their gas emissions. It's my baby and I'm happy to see it. I haven't seen it for two years and it's still working.
A unique opportunity presented itself. This virtually impenetrable country opened its doors to a scientific collaboration between Cambridge University and North Korean volcanologists. We were invited to film them. But all we saw was a presentation that we accepted. There's no other way to see this enigmatic country than the way it presents itself to us.
This seismograph will record earthquakes. It looks more like a can of paint connected to a laptop, and yet it has recorded this unique database, so it's something. Don't be fooled by appearances. It's actually a very sensitive instrument. It records even the smallest movements.
I'm not here to cause trouble. What are you doing here? I'm looking for a book. There are some books in the colored section. I don't see the one I'm looking for.

I know it. Strange. Sensational. I just discovered this place last week. It's some kind of food distribution center.
You put me in the unenviable position... I'm putting you... To have to step in and try to make some kind of victory over this steaming pile of crap. No, no-- you're not moving the goalposts with your back to me. Watch your tone, or you'll get a deal you really don't want. That's my boy.

Last night, I was at home. I was helping my son assemble a model wooden boat. It's a hobby we enjoy. And he asked me about the ship. I explained that it was used to explore the seas.

Dad, just once, could you forget about work and relax? I made you some hot chocolate. Thanks, but tonight I'd like something stronger. I found the Catwoman album you lost. It was behind the wardrobe.
A brother stabbed by a thug? It's something like that, I know! Because something like that happened to me too. I remember it one way, and sometimes another. If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice.

What about his heart? I heard him jump, but only once, and only for a second. That doesn't mean he was lying. Not really. The rest of the time, he remained steady.
Do you think, Corey? Good. Do you see that? I see blood. Look where it leads.
It's okay, it's okay. Where are you guys going? To get Kira. Her father told us that her mother took her to New Mexico, to this place called Shiprock. They're trying to find a way to help her, but it's dangerous.

Samantha put you in, I know it was an impossible decision, but you were right. You should have told me. Marriage is about inclusion. It's about leaning on your partner when things get tough.
They lured you to the hotel. Do we know where the call came from? Price and 14th. A bunch of other calls came from there, too. I'm guessing it's their base of operations.
To get me out, discourage anyone from running. Okay, but Darhk's wife is here at Ground Zero, so he doesn't really have a sense--unless Darhk's demolition crew is going to wipe out everyone but Ruve.

I need your help, Crane. My gift means something to you. No. You're the only gift I've ever needed. As it was and always will be.
It seems surprising that he should have given his name to this town after his death. He hardly deserves the honor. You haven't seen Rochester. My sources can find no further details on this mysterious artifact. Only that it's attracting a lot of attention and will be on the street tomorrow night.
Something like that. So what have you heard about the product? Sumerian fragment. Thinic period. It has some... intriguing characteristics.
No infected survived. I'm not giving up on him. So what's the plan? In the archives, there's a book. It describes a kind of creature:
Fortunately, I took several artifacts from the doctor's laboratory, including... Blavatsky's map. Able to track demonic presences. I simply followed it to the creature that was tormenting you. Crane... if the symbol works with the Witness Tablet, and it was able to help you...
Is everything all right? It's the symbol, Crane. All this time I thought I was succumbing to the darkness, and... and it's not at all what we thought. I know, it's confusing. We thought the symbol was tormenting you, when, in fact, it was there to help us.
Orpheus used it to locate Eurydice in the underworld, but it didn't work out quite so well for me. No, but you were on the right track. I followed up on some of your Orpheus research, and the Jug helped him find Eurydice, but enter the Underworld he used a lyre, we strung with gold wire. Betsy has always said that the flag was her greatest achievement, but the flag isn't important. It's the thread she sewed into it. Somehow it allowed them into the Catacombs. So, we need the Betsy Ross flag.
'Cause he abandoned us. I'm sorry, just... we're trying to save the world, and I'm here whining about candy. It's all right. Abbie sent these. They hoped that whoever took the real flag would leave behind a clue, something that power tell us where it went.
Waiting. Then it hit me. This flag is more than just a piece of structure. It's a symbol of the nation we fought to produce. It means something more.
This flag is more than just a piece of structure. It's a symbol of the nation we've fought to produce. It means something more. Just like the national anthem. It means something more.

But today, let's briefly analyze your papacy, Most Holy Father. In nine months, you haven't shown your face to the faithful, you haven't said a single Angelus in St. Peter's Square, nor have you communicated with anyone. You have withdrawn to your palace on the hill. You threatened and terrorized the faithful with your terse, telegraphic communiqués in L'Osservatore Vaticano, with obscurantist, retrograde theses. The result is that, according to numerous well-respected studies, Italian Catholics are turning away from the Church en masse. This new fact not only allows me to ignore your requests, it gives me an even greater opportunity:
Pius XIII appears... with his beautiful blue eyes and soft, round mouth. A dazzling image. So much so that the public is blinded by it. In other words, a powerful, evocative image. Not unlike that of Christ. But Pius XIII doesn't just dazzle, he also comforts. With a magnificent speech, full of Latin quotations. He tells them that they, the faithful, have nothing to fear.
It was perfect. Yes, I know it was. Those dancers put on a good show. No, Holy Father, I was talking about your speech. It was perfect.

At the end, he sang a hymn. No sound could be heard except his voice. The villagers gathered on the beach remained silent. The village was closely watched to ensure that there would be no Christian funeral. Mokichi's body was so waterlogged that it first reduced the flames to smoke.
Any man who respects God's commandments can live a peaceful and happy life. I see. It's very simple, padre. Have you heard this word? It means to renounce, to abdicate, to abandon faith.

You're a kid. I'm not 20 anymore. Thank you for that. I know you're not. I'm a kid. It allows me to see the world as it really is. Not the way the zombies have conditioned you to see it.
Another one. Hey, man, that's too sweet. Who wants to be a diabetic? This stuff will knock your teeth out. It'll make you nice and pop your head off, is that the point? Do you have dental insurance?
It might take me a month to plow through all this. [Good thing we have government jobs. Good thing. Follow the rabbit hole. See where it goes.
The guy who had a gun on you in the Yonk? We just found out he's been there before. What? We pulled a fresh set of prints off the front door. It matched a group of older ones on the bar and in the bathroom.
- Mm-hmm - Our second rate Napoleon, desperately trying to leave his mark on the world with those dirty little claws. Even if, in the end, he left nothing but the scars of his failures. Oh, rest assured, it will work.
But aren't you also asking to be a king, my darling? Oh, yes, I do. It's more appropriate. And yet, the king is both the biggest and the weakest piece on the board. He flounders about once all his defenders abandon him.
It's already a beacon that attracts your enemies. Perhaps the best solution is obvious. Give it to the one who loves each of you the most. I can hide myself. If he must exist, at least I can take him away from here.
Looks like I missed one hell of a party. At my loft. It's not every night you get to celebrate having your supernatural bond to a murderous psycho broken by a blood spell. - He said without irony. - Yeah, well, he wasn't a party at AC Strix.
(Shouts) (Gasps) Have you seen the white oak? Aurora had it but the ancestors don't say where. But it exists.
Aurora will do anything to make this wretched prophecy come true. Let's go stop her, shall we? What have you done to me? I used the same mixture on you that my brother designed for my... episodes. It's pretty effective, don't you think?
If we consecrate her, she'll wake up in their domain, and they'll destroy her. If we don't, we'll never see her again. Enough is enough. We want to help her, so we need to make sure she's consecrated but she needs to be safe so we'll put her somewhere where she'll be protected, and then we can resurrect her. And that's going to take a lot of energy, and my power isn't what it was before I was banished.
Then put his soul in that damn pendant. It worked for Finn. - It will work... - Dahlia created the pendant. It only works for our family.
Are you going to make them leave? Klaus? What's the matter, Klaus? Your heart's slowing. But it's still beating.
The lease would be in someone else's name. Good night, Lucien. Of course, you'd want that person nearby, in case... a friend jumped by for tea. The neighbors are nearby. Of course, he couldn't just be any neighbor.
Breaking windows, heckling, where does that get us? - It's a message! - To the wrong people! The enemy isn't in town. He's up there.
So kitsch. No, no, it's the opposite of kitsch. And you offered to smoke a joint... Because the sex would be better. Because it is.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. The door was open, I didn't mean to startle you. I heard about your mother. She was lovely... too kind for this world. It'll be darker without her.
If I'm here with you, it's because... I'm dead, Dad. No, you're not dead yet. Just listen to me. Father Thomas will perform the ritual of the cross for the second time, but he will fail.
And they work in flip-flops. We need to find out where this is coming from. Maybe the milk will help. How would milk help? It comes from cows that have the intelligence not to end up as hamburger.
There's a ladder there, so you... No. That's my ladder that I bought. - You bought it? When did you buy it? - Yesterday. I've been working on this issue for months. It looks good.
Many people say: "The glass is half empty" or "The glass is half full". For me, it's neither half empty nor half full. For me, the glass is full. It always is.
How did it go with Marius? It's okay. Don't worry, it'll pass. Yeah. When you get to Kensington Garden, and you're walking around with squirrels, our world seems so far away... You'll wonder if it even exists.
No more than three spoonfuls of beans... Lift her legs a little. What's wrong with her? - Give me the booze. - It's over there.
Can you do that? How? How can I do it? He's a novice. He's in a transition period.
Rumor has it that Shadowhunters have been interfering in Downworld affairs. But you don't know anything about this, do you? From New York, under our command, they're worried about our devotion to work and the cause. But we're the Lightwoods. Remember, honor isn't in the name... it's in the deed.
He had some of the characteristics of a Forsaken. He was human. He wore runes. I don't know. He was more focused. He was more focused, more determined.
She was your father's great love. She's dead now. My sister's death destroyed my family... And her death was no accident. On the day she died, she was taking part in a jumping competition. When the horse came home, it was sweating.
Please, Mom, just once! Just once. His horse threw him off. His horse was drugged. - Maybe he was.
Just this once. His horse threw him off. His horse was drugged. - Maybe he was. - Maybe he was?
I called it justice. But it wasn't. It was simply revenge. And that fire never goes out. It just consumes you.
But it wasn't. It was simply revenge. And that fire never goes out. It just consumes you. It burns you.
We can hide here while the hunters search for the other Fragmentations. What if they decide to see this place first? You know, you feel free to loop us whenever it's convenient. As you've seen, time doesn't work is generally considered. It wants to happen.
You know, there are medications that... The doctor here says he has one day... maybe two, if he's lucky. Is he looking at your luck, Mister... I don't know your name. It's Martin.
Well, I'm not the law and order type...nor type stay in one place either. Well, we have a lot in common at least. At least we do. Be well, Jonas. Nice thing about my world... for you, it's not going anywhere.
I can understand that. I want you to see this place. I can if you describe it to me. Well, my favorite part is the ceiling. It's covered with thousands of lights.
I count ten. Armed. Plenty of powder down there. - If those guys fire, the boat... - It'll explode into a million pieces.
- Gideon, what state are we in? - I'd say rotten. Shut down all essential systems so that Savage's robot... Too late, Captain; apparently it's determined that you're alive, as it's closing in on your position.
With destiny. You should recognize this procedure, Chronos. My name's Mick. Although we've made a few improvements. Your conditioning wasn't as complete as it should have been.
Yes, but not you, Maze. You exist to protect me. To know where I am and who I'm with at all times, whether you like it or not. I'm pretty sure your name isn't on the list. It should be.
The murder at the docks. The security guard killed during a robbery. Yeah, the stolen container was Lucifer's. The warehouse was filled with black market goods. Yes, it was.
LUCIFER: Previously on Lucifer... - So, how do you afford this place? - He is my mother.
You're just like Lucifer described. I love you guys. CHLOE: Are we going to talk about what happened? Our kiss. He's kind of a big deal.
Can you smell that? It's the last of Chef Javier's shine, gone forever. I wonder if the police have recovered the remains of his last meal. Well, it was most likely poisoned. Ah, well, he's worth the risk.
What? No (sighs) My father gave me this knife. It's all I have left of him.
Yes, I'm back home So I can tell her I'm clean. And I want to be a new chef. And this meal? Was what I'll do for him to prove it. Well, it looks very good.
I know you're putting your job on the line. I don't care what it costs. I want to find out who did this. Thank you. [Beep] This one right here, Tim's last text message... it looks like it's from Port-au-Prince.
You could feel like this all the time, you know. Free. Untethered. True to who you really are. The world needs Hank Henshaw more it needs Je onn onzz.
What he did was put a bomb in a teddy bear. And then he sent one to his boss. Chester Dunholtz. Except his assistant opened the package. He and five other people killed.
But he's not an android. That's what I'm trying to tell you. I looked into her eyes and there was someone there. She has a mind. It's like mine.
You put yourself out there. So you chose your side. "Blood binds us all." This proverb comes from the days when Krypton was more than a wasteland of warring tribes. And while blood is a powerful bond that unites us, it can also blind us to the truth.
You have to act, Chapman. Be a shark. I refuse to destroy everything I've built. This business is important to me. It gives me a purpose.
You haven't lived. Have you? Have you walked the Great Wall of China? Have you been passionately in love? You wouldn't know love if it hit you in the face!
Why do I spend so much time looking for what's wrong with people? You don't like to see it come to a conclusion. I don't like murder. Even for murderers. It's not about murder.
Sadly, no, and that's one of our best questions. But the fact that Emile and Tamika may have been talking to the same person just before they died gives us a warrant. We trace this mystery phone, but it's switched off, battery removed. Well, maybe the owner will turn it back on. And leave it on for at least an hour so it shows up online?
It's in the gray Mercedes. About three cars from where I'm standing. Is there anyone in the vehicle? Not a soul. What's wrong now?
- Hi, there. - How was your trip? It was great. I think I know the subway by heart. I just wish it would take me straight to work.
And you have no proof. What you're saying is horrible. It is horrible. Perhaps you'd like to answer this prepaid phone. It's from a confiscation you made after a drug bust two months ago.
I'm thinking of a great motto for my party But there are always killjoys. You have to know, green socks or green nails won't be enough. What if I stuck a black eye in you, would that count? It'll turn green then.
Thank you, Mr. Marley. You must be happy? You should eat, to keep your strength up. A rat, Mr Marley! It's looking at me!
The aim is to scare them into getting their act together. So, the big scare. It's phenomenal. I'm obsessed with one episode. It aired once. In 1999.
Take it easy, asshole! Have I lost my mind? I pull a DVD out of my bag, and hand it to him. "Here's my name. Type it in and you'll see where I perform." He thanks me.
In 1955, a group of Chicago actors created the concept of improvisational theater as an art form in itself. Not just a preliminary to other forms of theater. That's what we're going to play with. The 100% American ball. It's a strange shape, isn't it?
Not just a preliminary to other forms of theater. That's what we're going to play with. The 100% American balloon. It's a strange shape, isn't it? It's not really round.
Would the owner mind if I repainted? You can't paint orphans. But I can paint the walls. This is the place I was telling you about. - It's got a lot of character.
Watch out for this. "The art that stimulates us so much today is ephemeral "and not made to last except as an act of love. "It springs up between people and doesn't want to be put down on paper. "It only lasts for a moment and then disappears."
Tell me what's going on. You mean the e-mail? It's nothing special. I'm just feeling overwhelmed. Given the terseness of your e-mail, I thought there must be something specific and urgent.
You can't fool children. It shows who you are. Look at your sweater. It's ruined. It's dirty.
- He's just... - Wow, my mom's dating an anarchist. - That's awesome. - What can I tell you? You know, the heart wants what it wants. And sex is just...
- Can I see your cell phone? - Your what? Your cell phone. May I see it? Why should you? It might have information on it that could corroborate your alibi.
The kind of guy who just sat And is about to put you on that brutal. You like water? I'll introduce you to some fire. Come on, nigga. It's not going to bite you.
I don't want your story. You won't? Sorry you wasted your time. Follow procedure and ask me next time you have a topic. And don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong.
For now, stay here. Can I just say that the "stay here" part worries me? If you go, could you get my wallet? I left without it. It's on the hall table.
If you go, could you get my wallet? I left without it. It's on the hall table. - I'll get it. - It's made of salmon raffia and shaped like a turtle.
I'm not a man of faith, I'm a man of Science. I knew you were something. Look, let's just say you're jumping out of a plane. The parachute is on your back. There's no guarantee it will open.
Where's the line between all this and the real Hef? Who could determine it? But Masters and Johnson, like Playboy and Hugh Hefner, can only be separated by dirt and a tombstone. I can't stop thinking about Dr. Frankenstein. We've created our monster, and he's on the loose.
- Is he with you now? - Yeah. You got the stuff? No. But I got the address where he's going.
She was gone, it was over. My little Laurence, it must be difficult for you too. Excuse me, I have one last little thing. I know it's difficult, but... we'll need your DNA. To be sure it's Isabelle.
Okay, thanks. Hey, you've got 2 minutes to get dressed! Between yesterday and this morning, I've never been to church more. It's this way. It's a man in his fifties.
You come back after two years, and I'm supposed to leave my house in what? The words of a stranger. Where's the Aurora Cutlass? - The ship left Egypt. - You just have to make sure it gets to New York.
Carla, I've been given a new drug. - It's quite experimental. - What is it? I'll have to do some research. What if you don't want to mix it - with your other medicines?
- I discovered something else. - You're bluffing. A ship belonging to Stoneheart. Its contents have been kept secret. But clearly, it's of immense importance.
- still in operation. - I'm sure it will be soon enough. We don't want these things piling up, do we? No, of course we don't. Of course, sir. It'll be on its way.
What are we doing? What's going on? - Hands under, please. - What's wrong with my baby? What's wrong with my baby? - He's in the amniotic sac.
Don't get upset, Eldritch. What's the status of the Aurora Cutlass? The ship left Egypt 31 days ago. Excellent. Now all we have to do is make sure she gets to New York.
- I'm sure Eldritch - will. - What's on that boat - if you want to know, I'll tell you. In the meantime, please let us know as soon as it clears customs.
- It's finished. But we've got a problem, Quinlan's missing, and we need him to lock up the Master. I don't know how we're going to do it without him. Maybe we can help. The device we're working on, it could disorient him or even cut off his network.
But we've got a problem, Quinlan's missing, and we need him to lock up the Master. I don't know how we're going to do it without him. Maybe we can help. The device we're working on, it could disorient him or even cut off his network. It's not fully operational.
No, he didn't see a thing. The signal crippled their communication system, paralyzing them. They disappeared off his radar. You want to lock him up in there, this device can help. It worked on a strigoï, but do you think it can also weaken the Master?
You're the New York expert. Isn't that your card? What the hell? What's wrong? What's wrong with it?
Show me you understand. Show me who you are. Duke Rollo, By the power vested in me by His Holiness the Pope, I come to present you with the annulment papers that definitively end your marriage to Princess Gisla. Since the marriage has not been consummated, it does not exist under Christian law.
No, no, no! Go away! A shard of the true cross. -You're buying! It changes your life.
You told me nothing of your plans. We were to divide Mercia equally between us. But you took everything. And now your new kingdom is coming straight to me. So it does.
This is my crossbow. No one is waiting for you to be able to shoot properly. But if you get close enough, you can't miss. Look, here's the bolt. It goes here.
Play the message again. "Graff?" Hmm? Gracie sent me a text. I didn't get it because I was wearing my inventor's app. It just went through.
At Mary Goodwin's latest cancer diagnosis, Lookinglasstitreap 8% since the opening bell and looks set to continue falling as the day goes on. This is not only due to her illness, but also to the fact that the board members and shareholders have been maintained. She hasn't cancelled the launch. No. She thinks he'll show weakness, so she insists on going out in public.
FBI's looking for him right now. What's wrong with him? His endocrine system is failing. But the reservoir solves that problem. It hasn't so far.
I do. [You keep my rifle, though. [I like to know who your backup is. The catch is impossible to predict because it didn't exist in the object's original code.
Yeah. I'm all set. The software on this tank has been coded for a specific user. I need you to unlock the code so it can be used for someone else. The tank... what does it do? It connects with the user's genetic structure.
I need you to unlock the code so it can be used for someone else. The tank... what does it do? It connects with the user's genetic structure. Yeah, but what does it do? It gives $1 million money to the first person who opens the code.
Well, I'm pretty sure I can turn on a TV by myself. [MARY: James, as you read this, I will take my brother's body home to where our family belongs. [sighs] I will take his house from the ashes and finally pray that it will bring some peace to his troubled spirit.
I can't find his phone. Are you sure you were giving me the right number? Yes, I'm sure. DUVAL: Even if it's switched off, you should be able to get through and find it, shouldn't you?
Just a few days after regeneration, his maximum oxygen consumption reached 342 mm, six times that of a top-level athlete. His muscular recovery after an isokinetic fatigue test is 100%. His body, so recently old and fragile, is now functioning at maximum human capacity. His blood will save my sister. It's got to be.
Mr. Pritchard, Mary's waiting for you on the second floor for her transfusion. If it works, we can try it on others. Do you know how many lives you could save? Then my blood must be very precious. It is.
It's a German long-range radar. I had a crash course in it at camp. -But why... -Their radar beats ours by a mile. It sees much more clearly, much farther.
All right, listen up. We'll think of something. We always do. If that tank doesn't move, we're screwed. It'll move if it's told to.
I'll go in your place. Go to St Denis Cathedral, where Francis is buried. Find the embalmer who removed the king's organs. Ask him if the liver was already black when he removed it. If it wasn't...
I think Pree's having a bit too much fun. - What's it like down there? - I'm testing your contacts. How's that supposed to work? Theoretically, the Connaver device has been on Arkyn, so it absorbed the radiation.
How is this supposed to work? Theoretically, the Connaver device has been on Arkyn, so it has absorbed radiation. Beta radiation is invisible to the eye, but these sensass lenses will translate it into a visible signal. Look for red... assuming the device is actually there. It's there.
What are you guys doing to me? Who the hell are you? What do you want from me? I'm just looking for a camera. Did it belong to the Connovers?
Approaching Arkyn's atmosphere. Lucy, keep your distance. I don't want anyone to detect your approach. We weren't very subtle earlier. Don't worry... as soon as I activate the shield, it hides the ship.
As for Connie and me, things were getting out of hand, and I hadn't heard the news yet. - That's my job. - Don't you dare say that to me. I know what your goddamn job is. It doesn't involve getting kidnapped by a drug cartel.
- It's just that it can be... - Go back to your room, Conor. Good boy - The Berlin Wall was built overnight. The world woke up the next morning and there it was.
But I'll be free. - My father and I used to go boating, before, before... he got interested in other things. I remember sitting at the front of the boat, feeling free, it was like flying. - Do you still have the boat? - It's still there, I think, rusting away.
No, I've got a headache. If our calculations are correct... - And they are. - And they are. When this device explodes, it will collapse the event horizon on this side of the rift to cut off any connection to Earth-2 permanently.
General. Vorza, we've been looking all over for you. - Now, General... - Mr. Gibbons' money. It has arrived.
You've had your fun, baby. Now give me the necklace or you'll wish you hadn't gone out. Rule number one for bouncers: Use your humor to defuse a crisis. - Let's go. - But I took the milk, it's...
He's not willing to give us superfluous information. I need to talk to the Carsons. I need to know they're okay. - Where's my money? - It's on its way.
Me too. This sucks. Here's the truth. I don't know how long this will last. Since the virus has spread, it could be anywhere in the area.
Art is political. Particularly when the opposite is claimed. Art is dialectic. It is enriched by sharing and impoverished by appropriation and commodification. It's about seeing and being seen.
And tonight... Tonight we're going to... make love. When I'm in the ring... sometimes my body moves without my telling it to. It moves without me saying, "I should do this and not that."
Tonight we're going to... make love. When I'm in the ring... sometimes my body moves without me telling it to. It moves without me thinking, "I should do this and not that." It moves in harmony with the moment.
You're the best opponent I've ever fought. It was an honor to be in the ring with you. I learned more about myself and Woojin in that locker room than if I'd fought him 100 times. We exist... through sex. It's nothing to be afraid of.
A rope. It was all there for him. Sorry, folks. The rat on the right is the control test. He received no medication.
Sorry. The rat on the right is the control. It has received no medication. As you can see, his condition is deteriorating. He should collapse soon.
It's pretty complete, so... What's this? Oh, this is Killer Frost meta-data collected from numerous crime scenes... DNA trace movements, facial recognition, specific fluctuations in temperature sound. My algorithm compiles all the data and gives us an approximate location. It works on most metas, except for Zoom, of course.
I don't know. I've never had this problem before. I've never had this problem before. Dr. Wells... Carbyne. He's a form of carbyne.
I just can't believe it. Everything is really falling apart. All my work... is going to come to nothing. Do you like my little humidifier? It's... 150 years old, can you believe it?
I'm responsible for this kind. - I'll find us a new place. - What do you think? He's not like me and my baby will be welcome there. He's not out of your belly yet.
Shame on you. Just answer your phone when I call it, will you? Pay no attention to your homicidal sister. Coffee? Can't, it's bad for the baby.
Oh shit! All the craziness, I forgot. Yes, you can stay at my apartment. That might work. It might be a little tight, but I think we could accommodate everyone.
Exactly. Ask questions about the program. Sorry about that. Did you always want to do this job? No, I got this job after I graduated and it suited me.
My people visit me. Telling me things. And what do these African ghosts say? That the world is bigger than this farm. Of course it is.
if you feel him slow down, just give him a little tap. It won't hurt him. It won't. Now what, Mom? You have to stir the honey until it melts.
You have to be ready at all times. Do you give up? Go for it! Faster, faster. But there's no saddle.
Do you give up? Get on with it! Faster, faster. But there's no saddle. There's no need for a saddle.
Who found him? His wife. She was at her parents' house with their daughter, and when she came back to the apartment, she made the discovery. We examined his alibi. He extracts.
No witnesses, no media coverage, no points. Terrorists like attention. This place doesn't give them that. But I can see why the unsub lured Malik here alone at night. It's the perfect place to find unnoticed.
We had better luck searching for the gas that was used on Malik. It's a tear-gas agent. It is similar to phenacyl chloride, which is a popular riot control gas. It is banned by international convention, but is used by the Egyptian government. The gas, when distributed in large crowds, weakens as it spreads, causing only nausea, but in a confined space, it will kill you in two minutes.
I wish I'd shared, but I'm concerned about your country's policies. Not the ones you march to the world, but the ones behind closed doors. You can't tolerate this kind of unnatural behavior. It doesn't matter what I believe or tolerate. It is the law in both our countries.
I know - I'm a hopeless romantic. Oh! That's so sweet! I remember my first crush. It was at summer camp.
Oh! That's so sweet! I remember my first crush. He was at summer camp. I lived in Toronto, and he was from Edmonton, so he was very cursed.
Hey! I just need a minute alone with my husband. Thank you so much. There's no way you're paying that bill. He's been down there forever, and he didn't even pretend to reach for his wallet.
I'd like to give you two a little something to think about. Most of the food you eat is prepared by us. Or by our private chef. But I like it where you're going. The next time you take a bite out of a big juicy burger or dig into a bowl of spaghetti, there's going to be an extra special ingredient in there, and it's not going to be love.
I'm just an ordinary person, like you. I know people put on my pants one leg at a time. [Laughs] Which is so funny. Barbra, today is her birthday! Well, technically, it was three weeks ago.
The yellow one! Hey. What's going on? I found this inhaler. Do you know whose it might be?
- Might as well make a collage. Let's talk to Brianna to see if she can remove the palm oil. I've tried, she won't budge. I need my lubricant back. It can't be marketed with palm oil.
Obviously, my side is winning. But we have a contract, it's crazy to have to explain that to a lawyer and a lawyer's mother and ex-wife. It's like she fathered me, then married me. Didn't she? We have a contract, but it's fragile.
Tell me you're kidding. This is insane. No, I've never made a more reasonable decision. The cancer's back. It's everywhere.
Did you talk to her? Yes. I got your painting back. Kenny! Kenny! It's still working.
That should make it a lot easier to bring back. And this container. Is it strong enough to hold him once he's sedated? It's made of promethium metal. It's impenetrable.
Previously What's happening? Possible flu epidemic. At 4:27 p.m., Dr. Saunders died. Her boyfriend died shortly afterwards, suggesting that the virus can spread very quickly. As the virus has spread, it could be anywhere.
He was talking about negotiating with these guys. This is a bad idea. Can you stop the elevator with your key? Hang on a sec. He's coming back up.
Anybody hungry? We're fine. And you, Teresa. You're pregnant and probably always hungry. We have juice, but it's... near the entrance.
- What's going on? - Possible flu epidemic. There is currently no vaccine, and its mortality rate has been proven to be 100%.
And he will cleanse you of all your impurities. Amen! He will send the angel of death... This place is as scary as ever. No, it's even scarier.
The eyes of the world are upon us. Once the virus is out, it stays out.
Yes, just leave it anywhere on the table, thanks. Can I borrow your work phone? - Your boss gives you a phone so that the brand appears on the screen when you call. - What's wrong with yours? - Oh, it's dead.
His company gave me a settlement. What did he do for a living? He was a salesman at Anderson Supply, in the warehouse. Where is the warehouse? I've never been there, but I know it's off Highway 92 near the convenience store.
- These pearls are worth - more than you ask. - No, it's not that. I'm not taking this baby. What if it cries?
- more than you're asking for. - It's not like that. I'm not taking this baby. What if he cries? He'll make us notice.
My leave was... I'm away on very important unfinished business. The ship won't be there, Grey. We saw it take off, remember? Yes, and as it took off, it must have left...
I'm not ready to die. Nor am I. Which reminds me... Is our solar ray still working? In fact, it's operating at 12,000% efficiency.
He's no rebel. He made a mistake. There's a harsh reality in all this. No one will come to the rescue of this country. It's on its own.
To forget what had happened to us. Goodbye baby. But the past is never the past. I love you, baby. If it were, there would be no tragedies.
What's all this? - Three thousand a month? - Mm-hmm. This place is a dump. Yeah, it's a block from our old place.
Well, whatever. Uh, so I'm having some sort of party at my boss's house, - so... - A what? It's when you cut a cake and see if it's pink or blue icing inside.
That's it, that's it. There you go. - He's squirming! - Of course, it's a worm. He'll stop squirming when you hook him.
I think she really loves him... It's time to give in. QUE LA PRINCESSE SE MARIE - Give the people what they want. - Do they really know what they want? Frankly, the world isn't the same as it was a few years ago, and he's not the one at fault...
And a long time away from his children for a father. But if it gives me time to think about my priorities, and settle down, not just in my marriage, but overall, it will be worth it. Don't be like that. Everyone's just trying to help. By sending a problem to Australia, in the hope that it will settle or better yet, that their ship will sink.
[Yo. Can we please get rid of Jay's helmet? Uh, no, sorry. He keeps motivating me.
Yo. Can we please get rid of Jay's helmet? I'm sorry, no. He keeps motivating me. Well, he gives me daymares.
Isn't that right, Barry? Yeah, it is. Yeah. What's the project? He's trying to push the speed limit with smaller propulsion systems.
Dr. Wells, we need you. ♪♪ Time to come home, Flash. ♪♪ Okay, our satellite finally found our floating friend and he's coming back.
Oh, hey, Barry. How was your trip? ♪♪ So, aside from the fact that a Wraith time came here and nearly killed us, how did it go? It was interesting.
I belong here. I can't take care of myself, let alone a baby. I abandoned my baby. My book is out. And it's on the New York Times bestseller list.
Well, no. No one has ever called you that... ever. Peri, it's been six months, and I still don't remember anything, and even when I get a glow, it turns out to be wrong. So, your brain is boiled. But it's also a blank slate.
The truth is, I don't want to get your hopes up - About what? - About your film - being back in production - I thought it was dead.
The truth is, I didn't want you to get your hopes up. About what? About your film, back in production. I thought it was dead! Well, it was.
He used to be. But not anymore. Hugh Metzger wants management. Does he really? But we all agree we need a new script.
I know Adrian. That's all there is to it. He could never be happy with a woman like that. When we first started seeing each other, you told me your marriage was over. It's over.
You see, when I play a scene, I have access to a few tools. But some tools don't make it back to the workshop. Oh, my goodness. Is that a tunnel? Yes, and it's almost finished.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait for what? Were you drinking? I'd had half a cocktail. It must have been stronger than I thought because I don't remember anything after that.
A man I knew a long time ago, he... He passed away. I'm sorry for your loss. Stupid. I hadn't seen him in over 20 years. But he was the first man I ever loved.
I'm sure we can divide our assets fairly and amicably. We'll see how amicable you feel after you read my list of demands. The Manhattan apartment. I did some major work on it... It's all yours.
That year's winter was strangely mild for the season, and by February, what remained of the snow on the side of the highways had turned black. Spring brought too much rain, and fruit hung limply from trees, at the ends of branches bending under their weight. The sun in the summer months was curiously hot, stinging my bare shoulders whenever I let it. I remember thinking that autumn never seemed to arrive. And then it never did.
I'm Lawrence Durrell. I'm a writer. And you're from here? Where did you get that nose? Oh, it's beautiful.
She claims it comes from the shock of her husband's death. Her world has been smaller since then. At this rate, she'll end up in a wardrobe. You know money can't buy happiness, but it can buy you a pretty haute couture dress only to be miserable in it.
But God was just as determined. The 3rd was a girl, and so was the 4th. At this point, I was disillusioned myself. The food's ready, Dad. Turn it over or it'll burn.
Hi, there. Are you still mad at me? Come here. Come on. What's in your bag? - Just leave it. It weighs a ton!
Already tried it. GPS doesn't work. Okay, but meta-human detection should work. The watch was created to track metas, right? And since Griffin Grey is one, it keeps sending a message to a server until it disappears.

By the time I saw her reach for the gun, it was too late. She shot me before I knew what was happening. The cleaning lady has a son, which must be why she doesn't want to testify, because she's afraid for him. How is the baby? If he hadn't stopped screaming, I could have smothered him.
Did Annalise find anything? No, of course not. Annalise just arrived, and she needs me, so we'll talk later. Way to resist the magic penis. It's magical... and beautiful.
Wait till you meet my family. Were you planning on keeping your baby a secret forever? I would have told you. - When would you? - When he was born.
Love is very powerful, especially first love, which causes impulsive acts. You know, we can deal with the Turkish language barrier. But what worries me is the cultural barrier and how that will affect Emma's search. What's that supposed to mean? Well, the Antalya police listened to her answering machine, and they don't seem to think there's been any crime.
Well, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that my countermeasures mean that there is no Hanim Atvan Well, Hanim or no Hanim, the recruiter who sent those messages knows where she is. Boss, I've got some bad news. The Istanbul Police have found a body. It matches that of Emma Peters.
Fuck! I have something to ask you, but I don't want to seem like an opportunist who wants to take advantage of our... - Friendship? - Yes, our new friendship. I don't think that's the case, but if you're ever looking for a partner, please choose me.
That. - Yeah, I got... - Do you have a fucking cell phone? Hi, Topher. Yeah, it works great.
I had a good backhand today. I didn't sleep well last night. No, it's just that the bed in the annex is... - It's gone. - No, it's just that it's uneven.
- Are you journalists? - Yes, I'm a journalist. I suppose you've heard about the Diamond Lake Monster. It's a real legend around here. They say it killed someone.
I imagine you've heard of the Diamond Lake Monster. It's a real legend around here. I heard it killed someone. Are you covering this story? If there's blood, it keeps people reading.
An hour later, we heard gunshots, and then we heard her scream. We ran to the water and called 911. At first we thought she'd killed her husband. So you don't believe in the lake monster? Well, we sell articles that suggest it exists.
Do you have it? Are you ready to name an heir? Why do you think I asked you to bring it? Orus will be so pleased. You're going to need six months to work on this bow,
So why keep me here? Because I don't want to be alone anymore. I'll never be with you. You think you're not like me, but I've seen it, the darkness inside you, Caitlin. Just like it was inside Killer Frost.
We haven't been close for a long time. I want things to change. You're my brother. You know that wall's not just gonna open for you, right? It might.
You're my brother. You know that wall's not just going to open for you, right? It might. Trust me, he won't. It won't.
I'm looking for a new distributor myself. What the hell is going on? Upgrading the crib because it's technically mine now. Uh, not with my name on the deed, it isn't. My money, it is.
Hey. Headed to student housing? That place is flooded. No, no, I can't allow that. You know, it was available when I was an RA.
Animals are naked. I'm the whole animal world in the body of a single specimen. More like a bizarre agglomerate. What did your thing say? He's making fun of you.
They were going to impeach you. Sharp had mobilized the Democrats. Your foreign minister had dropped you. Your party? It's rotten to the core, and the core is Underwood.
It must be very nice. It's more complicated than it sounds. Is the stuff here? Please do. It's in here somewhere.
I like writing things down, I can fix them later. Making code work. I like it when the code works. Please tell me the sky is green. It's not, it's blue.
Make the code work. I like it when the code works. Please tell me the sky is green. It's not, it's blue. More precisely, it appears blue because of the scattering of rays in the sky.
Yeah. The conspiracy goes all the way back to Quantico. The terrorist... We've been calling them the "Voice." I thought he was someone from our class, but he could be... he could be someone out there.
Have you seen it? No. Go get changed. I'll find him. I'm sure he's around here somewhere.
- She's so cool. Her music makes me feel strong. Like I'm capable of anything. Doesn't she hurt you? There's this passage: "I hope and pray to God That my fetus has a soul For I want it to feel pain When I eject it from my hole"?
And sometimes I doubt Finding sleep is hard Say it I think of my child's heart And it makes me cry True I hope and pray to God That my fetus has a soul 'Cause I want it to feel pain When I eject it from my hole
He's a Grimm. I thought he was going to kill me. Did you report the wood theft to the police? Why would I do that? There was only $300 worth of wood.
Step away from the table. - He can't breathe! - You're strangling him! I told you to bring the boat back. It's in the lagoon.
