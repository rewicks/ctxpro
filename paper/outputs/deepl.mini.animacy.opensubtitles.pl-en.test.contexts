What did you do with Pandora's Box? It's in a safe place. I don't think that was the plan. After all these years, does it still shock you when I improvise? No. But we were supposed to destroy it.
Serena set us up. She betrayed us. It's not about Serena. We are threatened by war. Either we stop her, or the whole world will burn.
It's about to be overrun with cops. - Where the fuck is Ed? - In hiding. He doesn't want to take any chances. Where's my tape? We'll give it to you when we come for the bag.
- It's not a big deal. Great. The procedure is as usual. The cash will spend the night here. In the morning we'll send it to the branches in the field so that farmers can cash their checks.
You looked at someone for a whole minute, which is a really long time. Something is bothering you. Do we know each other? Can I say something? No one deserves a minute of your attention unless they reciprocate it.
It is like painted. It stands out from the others. Thank you. I didn't say it was from me. But whoever gave it to you put his heart into it.
I can't take her with me. I want her to be safe. She's my life's work, you know that. Of course it is, Simon. We can store it in the basement.

I'm trying! The stars will soon disappear. Carina! Henry, look, there is an island! You found it!
It was the largest pyramid since the Egyptian pharaohs. Ruth loves to go to restaurants. Apparently, she orders pyramids of grub. I have to tell you something important. I have your money, I can give it to you.
They took everything. They even demanded underwear and nightgowns. - Federal agents. - Why do they need your underwear? - They will put it up for auction.
I wasn't talking to you, sunshine. You should keep quiet. Or shoot in the thigh. - Unarmed you asked for money? - And they gave it to me.
- By. - Hi. Where are you going? We have a contract. You are breaking it.
This time I really had to make an effort. You think you know more about reality? From the writer? Let me show you the reality. You created it yourself.
When you close your eyes.... Do you dream about me? I don't dream at all. No one understands my dreams. This is where I found perfection. I created it.
Don't you know that you're the only one I've been waiting for all this time? Take the shovel! Take the shovel! Come on. Take it.
- Stop. - Leave me alone. Another beautiful moment. There was also joy. But it was erased by madness.
You are a selfish asshole. I don't get it, Willie. A week ago I would have given you my kidney. Yours probably won't be suitable. But I would have given it to you anyway.
The phone is free. Is it okay? Sure. We finally have a chance to catch them. We'll finish the pump station, fix it and go home.
We were all constantly stealing. From stores, workshops, from neighbors and family. Buddies? Yet another category of suckers. In the morning, when you rolled away with my fortune, I was furious, but I also thought, "Sure, he claimed it.
He reaches out to me so far. What are you talking about, Murphy? Go ahead, Potato. Finish the story. We all want to hear it.
- Just for a moment. Let's see the island! And what do you think? It's not every day you come across deserted islands. Let's explore it.
See. And you know what... I won't give it to anyone. Only to you. Because I wrote it for you.
Here she is! Damn, she's not here. Come on! She got burned! He still has her in his head.
Show. The damn thing cut me! Where is your card? I don't have it. Styvesan told the boss you had it.
Styvesan told his boss that you had it. Apparently you said it was your best card. So talk! Ask the woman. She saw it.
This. We are not irreplaceable. They fired Irv. The school wants to make me cringe? I'm going to make her cringe!
The plan is this. I'm going to frame Strickland for something he didn't do. What will you do? I got an idea when a drugged horse dragged me down the stairs. I'm going to get the meth and plant it on him in the classroom.
I don't give a damn about you And everything you do I don't give a damn about you And everything you do I hear you have a new guy I see you take a photo You publish it and think I'm jealous
Even before the lightning, they did not dare to approach. No doubt about it. They know what befalls those who violate the relic. Perhaps you do not know the story, brother. Otherwise you would not be so eager to take it.
Perhaps you don't know the story, brother. Otherwise you would not be so eager to take it. Enlighten me. Before we had a beautiful golden casket to store. Other foreigners tried to abduct it. Normans.
- We are the soldiers of Christ. And do you froth before any melee? In the name of St. Matthias, whose relic we have the honor of carrying to the feet of the Holy See, I bless and purify this water. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. I cast out the demons that have defiled it, I send them back to eternal hell, where they will be entombed by fiery fetters, and crushed by the heel of the Almighty himself.
Hello. My name is Victor Nieves, I manage the Landsat team. This is Woodward, from file service. We're headed to a place that has been overlooked for centuries, staking out maritime trade routes. As you can see from the photos... the island is constantly surrounded by storm clouds.... that hide it from the outside world.
I know, and what do we do? The edge of the island. Weaver, climb the rocks and shoot a flare. Maybe Brooks will spot it.
- Let me show you my favorite room. No, let's go in here. Was there a recent meeting of yours here? Monthly summary. Confession is good, provided it can be erased.
Portfolio! Well, and I was right! Leave it. I've seen it somewhere before. We need to replace it.
Gas! Countdown. I'm going to flood the world with my puppies and you won't stop me from doing it! No! Bobo-Korp took all the love from me, and now I will take it away from them.
- Sit down. Everyone will agree that the phrase "This is the wall" is true. This wall is real. I can see it, and so can you.
Everyone will agree that the phrase "This is the wall" is true. This wall is real. I can see it, and so can you. You can touch it.
If you should know a thing about me, know that I don't need anything, I want it. And I want this information. It's a little strange that he can give it only to you. It seems that this information is quite valuable to you. - Rest assured, I will get it.
This one got into the cabinet again and I'm sick of the leaking pipe. It flooded the pantry floor, it's going to be all moldy, Frank. - Did you call them? - Yes, they are very busy. They know about the leaking pipe and will fix it by tomorrow.
This would mean that by some miracle he survived a plane crash in the Himalayas.... and for some unknown reason waited 15 years to return barefoot, with a tendency to aggression. I know, we will find out the truth. We did the right thing. Whoever this guy is, he needs help and thanks to us he got it.
I will not leave. Not without a fight. This fight will not be won, Joy. Not necessarily. If I develop a strategy, will you consider it?
You said you control everything. I thought so. But... - I lost... - Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand, if you can control it.
- Exactly. I destroyed our friendship. I don't want the same thing to happen to us. After my parents died, I always missed my family. At first I thought I had found it in Kunlun.
- Xiaoguang! Hi, I'm Xiaoguang. Do you remember the treasure your father was looking for? Here is the map to it. The doctor brought it back from India.
Before I made the pilgrimage to Kunlun. Before I discovered the substance. And I founded the organization. She was wise and good... But death took her away from me before I learned how to defeat her.
Would it surprise you to learn that the image is not coming from a large camera, but from one of these devices? This camera does not require wires. It transmits this image via satellite. This morning I set up this camera. I attached it to a tree, close to the sands, without any permission.
- Beets are on the upswing. - They are not bad looking. Thank you. Have you given the horses glucosamine? I talked to the vet. He said it was of no use and you want to give it back to me.
Jesus. - I thought all this pressure would push us through. No, I'm even more stuck! Okay, well, take off the bracelet. - Tear it off.
- No, no , no. - We will not surrender. We are not taking prisoners. We have to climb the mountain. And totally go around it!
- What if Sherman can reach the bracelet with his mouth, maybe we can get out. You said you couldn't tear it. That's true. But Sherman can chew it!
Do you snort cocaine every morning, Frank? Funny you should ask. I sell to the Jews in Boca Raton. They skim it like candy. I tell you.They get addicted. If I remember correctly, Wolf Cola was supposed to be used, to launder money. Yes, but now I sell it from a truck.
So the scratch card is mine! Okay, okay, okay. Now, let's recap the facts. Miss Reynolds purchased the scratch card with Mr. Reynolds' money. But Mr. MacDonald now owns it.
You bitch! - After half? - ...out of the way! - DENNIS: Nothing for this one - what did he pay for the scratch card? - I bought it!
! I have a chest. What about it? ! Open it.
How did you sleep? Good. A beautiful boat. From my shipyard in Seattle. Did you build it yourself?
- Do I get a piano? - No. Was Mary's teacher here this morning? I have a book called "Fundamentals of Decision Making." You can borrow it.
- Scouting? - No. Then what did she do all the time? She loved mathematics. It was her passion. She preferred it to other things.
You are doing a very honorable thing. And that's why ... I have come to help you. Unofficially, of course. What is your plan? If there is another weapons factory, find it and destroy it.
It's everyone's fault. Not mine. Maybe mine too! Please. If you think this war should end, if you want it to end, help me end it now.
He killed her. Warning, warning. The temple power system failure. The power fell off a cliff. - But what had emptied it?
Fits. Do you like to read? I have a collection of books on psychology. I just finished reading "The Human Animal." I'll send it to you and a few other favorites.
Now we will get up, ready? Go. Damn, it's real. Lower the gun, do it! Take the coke, put it in our case and close it.
Mr. Delaney has come to see you. He came from the river and is in the garden. If you fuck him, check if he's from the east or the west. There is a cholera in the east. You can catch it from napping.
It felt like an eternity. - When... - I have to leave. - The letter carrier, I'll pick up the mail. - But he will bring it himself.
Beverly? Will you have dinner with me? Hawk. Electricity is buzzing. It can be heard in the mountains and rivers.
/ For the love. There was some tension when our moms started seating guests. Tension? My mother almost threw the main decoration at Ella's head. /No, Diane said, she knocked it down and it flew across the room by accident, and I believe her this time.
Turn off Fox News. Having a bunch of perverts yell at us won't do us any good. - That's the way it is. - So... we should take care of this assessment. - I've already written it.
- So. we should take care of this evaluation. - I've already written it. - When? It's ready. I wrote it at night.
- I have already written it. - When? It is ready. I wrote it at night. It still needs to be polished, but it's basically ready.
If they are to trust us, we cannot accept the existence of an area we do not control. We are to protect the country. We will first secure an area considered impregnable. Good. I didn't come here to manage the war, and certainly not to end it.
I wanted to talk to you about this petition, regarding the performance. There are concerns that it is inappropriate. There is a petition circulating to cancel the show? For Madeline, this show was the last resort, the meaning of life. I signed it.
I am in a hurry. The Lord is in a hurry. Here are the terms. The sticker stays on the car for 90 days. If you take it off earlier, you give your money back.
When my husband died, there were days when I couldn't breathe. But how do you explain to a child that he should take care of himself because mommy feels like crying? I have a way to comfort myself when I'm sad. - Antidepressants? I take a sad song and.... I turn it into a salsa.
How do you explain to a child who opened his heart to you that you used him to seduce his friend's grandmother? How could I have been so stupid? Sorry. Where is the camera? I promise to get it back.
How could I have been so stupid? Sorry. Where is the camera? I promise to get it back. So you stole it.
Go on. His mother brought him back to life to fill the void she felt after Wild Hunt disappeared from Canaan. Mom... What if Sheriff Stilinski fills the void? Does he fill it with Claudia?
We need Parrish. Wait. The woman, Lenore, summoned her dead son? She was the only survivor. She had to fill the void somehow, so she filled it with her son.
- Always. - No. - We need more time. - No. The longer this restaurant stays open.... The more people you box up when you finally close it.
Where do you think he could have gone? It depends on whether he took the cash or not. - If not... - He did. - He took it.
The decision has been made. You will leave the Tribal Lands. You will never return here. I will take you to the border. - And then what? - You will cross it.
You can't hurt me. The wizard protects me. But his doesn't. His is protected by magic. And the Wizard hates magic. Are you able to break it?
Close your eyes. Tell me, what do you feel? Hatred. For the Wizard and the man who killed my family. Absorb it.
Tell me, what do you feel? Hatred. For the Wizard and the man who killed my family. Absorb it. Take it with you.
It's not about me, it's about what's best for Oz. Meaning? Sending you home. Tell me how you got here so I can send you back. Let me initiate the sequence, if I remember it.
We need to hurry up. Do you know how it works? I built this machine. - Really? - Yes. Yes, to go home with you, but the Wizard appropriated it.
Speak. He is a prisoner of ... Eternal Beast. No. Only you can stop it.
- How much? - Mm. A cache of jewels. Spain is ready to burn Nassau to a barren land. The only way for Rogers to prevent this is to find the cache and return it, so if we find it first, we can decide future events.
I was always told that you are not afraid of anything. Could it be that my information is false? I am not afraid of wanting to do a difficult thing in a smart way. He wants this fight. So let's give it to him.
Increase how? Underhill Plantation. The largest and richest of the interior estates, it is home to more than 200 slaves. It is well protected. Until now, I didn't have enough forces to conquer it.
Gandhi's peaceful struggle ... SWARAJA HOLY LAW ...for independence resonated throughout the country. But another fighter of this freedom struggle, Subhas Chandra Bose, does not support Gandhi's peaceful approach. He believes that freedom should be fought for, not asked for. To win it, one must fight fire with fire.
I cannot knowingly risk Julia's life. Mr. Billimoria... - Please trust me. - This one. This is the cage, cut it.
Your turn. I come from ... Of the untouchables. That scar on your back. It is beautiful. Where did you get it?
Francis Llewellyn Poncherello. A choppy name. Too many words. Too bad, because we already have a biography. Should we change it now?
They have to give me Springer's assignments, because no one else has such information. Information that would allow the SS to take over nuclear experiments from the army? Do you know that this bomb could be made if we put enough resources into it? The army doesn't believe it, because it would deprive them of their jobs. Only under the command of the SS will it be possible to create it.
A genius, probably already deceased. His sister was a beauty with raven-black hair.... and a touch of wildness. One night she showed me their hideout. You see, they were Catholics. And being good believers, they used her for good purposes.
He would never do something like that when we were together. Never! But for Bonnie, he's a model of chicken sacrifice. Maybe leave some of that anger - and turn it into something positive.
I wanted to believe that this tape had many meanings. That our souls are eternal.... And that when we die.... souls look for a new home. And then I saw this picture. Skye's face. You guys saw it too.
Everything you know about this tape is here. It will help you more than me. A person can never match his work. Those images on the film were her story. She wanted to be heard.
Well, you lived to see it. Enjoy. It will be a war on which you will fall. Tell believers and non-believers that we have taken over the spring. They will get it back when they pray for it.
Something perfect. The coagulation procedure is a man-made miracle. Our association has been working on it for many years and recently succeeded in perfecting it. With my own body and blood. We are honored to offer it as a service to our group members.
I miss them. Dots and dashes. Secret codes. There was a lot of drama in it. When you received an envelope, you jumped up out of impatience. So you opened it slowly.
No note? Nothing? No. Does he have a cell phone? He left it in his room.
Then there was a hearing. We filed an appeal to the Supreme Court. Co-opting in a public place," said the prosecution. I said: "I didn't put the yuck in them. I had it next to me.
Attendance? Make sure your teachers mark your attendance so we know if you are coming. But why? After all, I have high attendance. Someone cares that you maintain it.
To help me reach one person? I doubt it. People like you don't act selflessly. God, man. This is some kind of madness! "Today I'm wearing black lace underwear. Just so you know I'm wearing it."
I wanted to be someone else. You know that feeling? I didn't want to be invisible anymore. I wanted to start over. To cut myself off from the past.... And leave it behind.
- Sure. - Bye. Gary? The Bakers considered our settlement proposal. They rejected it.
You would be a lousy therapist. Now get lost before I'm finished. According to the city council, the river was dredged in '94. That doesn't necessarily mean it was in the water after that time. They might have overlooked it last time.
Worried not a bit think to stay away from loners. I thought our efforts escaped your attention. - You came out to us yourself. - Because you triggered my trap. I thought I noticed it in time.
- Not necessarily. Cool, I'll teach you. We'll start with this. You squeeze the rope like this. Here you have the top loop. You bend it down, up again and translate it. - And you're done.
- What can I do? - Make him an offer. - Make him a verbal offer. - Write it down. So that you can trade it.
So hot. So that's how I'm going to die. Oh, God, the humidity. Oh, God, the humidity.... Reduce it a little, God.
So this is how I will die. Oh, God, the humidity. Oh, God, the humidity.... Reduce it a little, God. Reduce it just a little bit God!
It's hard to leave... Fortunately, you are here. Your company was so kind.... Mr. Ehrmantraut, your broker, arranged a loan for us with you last year. We want to pay it back.
Lief Ericson saw her as she drove home. - Where is her head? I can see that much. Then why do you ask? We think she was taken away.
I need to talk to Munk. How was it at Vuko? Cool. That's what I was thinking... since we already sold the boat, we can afford to move there. Did you sell it?
Did she just sing them to you? No. She had a long-standing affair with him and it would be bad if her husband found out about it. Well. You're really pissed at everyone, aren't you? I gave myself to this job and I want to know why I lost it!
I will find him and get his support. I strongly advise you against disappearing with the governor now. We are close to victory and bringing Nassau out of the darkness. I'm afraid we won't secure victory on our own. We need help, and this is the only way to get it.
Go get that book. Where the fuck is it, Michael? No, no! It's not ready! - He will destroy it!
People were stealing them. He flipped through it and suddenly ripped out a page. And this is a public book, for everyone.... - I raised a ruckus. - Can I see it?
A Santa Claus convention is being held. - I don't know why here. - What was in the bag? Mostly flannel. Will I get it back?
- What are these? They will stop the chase of thoughts. Now... Imagine an island. A tropical one, in the Pacific. Can you see it?
I gave you the wrong coin. It was my lucky coin. You can't act carelessly with a lucky coin. You have to guard it. Here's what we'll do. I will give you back your coin if you tell me how you conjured it out of thin air.
It was my lucky coin. You can't act carelessly with a lucky coin. You have to guard it. We'll do it like this. I'll give you back your coin if you tell me how you conjured it out of thin air. I conjured it out of thin air. That's how I conjured it, perverted worm.
Did you give Pernell my cell number? No. He left a message for you. It's a sweet one. Do you want to hear it?
They arrive every day. Tammy leaves them seed. Can I... 471 dollars and 26 cents. What was he doing with all that cash? Do you want it?
Some stars shine and dark shadows around them. It's like thirst and water. Right next to each other without having to become one. If they did, they would create the most glorious planet. Do you know the eggs I call it?
This way, at least my death will mean something. Just promise to take care of them and never leave them. I promise. I don't want to be buried with the winners. War only ends when you lose it.
For the past few years I've been thinking about the vacations I spent here. I remembered what it was like.... This green, this shade of green. This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. That tire swing. Every summer it would break down and every summer my grandfather would fix it.
I'm telling you it's here. - I can feel it. - Sure. Remember that observation I insisted on? - I commissioned it from Cole.
- I am not on either side. - Sekou can spend 15 years in prison. You are on one side. You gave him $5,000 that you thought was going to go to a jihadist in Africa. If that's what the money was for, and Sekou took it, tell us, we'll listen to you.
- I come from Bebbanburg. - Yes, that's right. - Are you planning to form an army? - I was still in captivity yesterday. If you create an army, I will lead it, but only if your intention is to go against all the Northern Lords.
Fiske? That's right, ladies, we heard about it from the merchants. And where are these merchants? - We heard the same story 3 or 5 times.... - We heard it 3 times.
He was friends with Michael. I read your book. - Did you really? - Yes. Kevin left it in the bathroom, I took it for a while, I didn't look at it and twenty minutes passed.
Well. You made it! I believe that on the 7th anniversary of the Sudden Disappearance the downpour will come. And with it a great flood. And I have to sing to stop it.
20,000 holes in cash taped to my body. - Close the door. - What are you doing? I used your duct tape. The scanner would have detected it. - Forgive me.
Good. You brought your book. It's Matt's, not mine. But it's about you. Do you finally want to read it?
- What are you looking for? Anemia, glucose, potassium, heavy metals and pregnancy. Pregnancy you can cross off right away. Well, yes, your IUD. You must remove it before you travel.
- Will he also come? - No. But he gave me something for you. He apologizes for not putting you in his fucking book. - Who burned it?
I remember. Once they took us to a baseball game. I was too small to grasp the rules. But my attention was caught by a beach ball, bounced by people in another sector. The whole stadium got into it. When the ball flew up to us, you stood up and bounced it.
But my attention was caught by a beach ball, bounced by people in another sector. The whole stadium got into it. When the ball flew up to us, you stood up and bounced it. You smiled then for the first time in a long time. But then the ball flew into the aisle. One of the orderlies ran up to it, grabbed it and squeezed the air out of it.
Will you stay? I can't. Wait. Your lighter. Keep it.
What do you want to do at this point? How? - How do you want to handle this? - One of you will surrender and stay here so that the conditions will be honored. You will send someone to get the chest, and when he gets here, I will take over.
No, hands behind the head. Go over there. Hands behind your head! Behind your belt you have a gun. Put it on the ground and move it to me.
Keith just called. Eric Carter's operation has yielded a promising lead. Maybe we can find Jadalla without your father's help. CTU will conduct the operation. Keith asks me to supervise it with him.
Here I read. I don't use the ballroom. You lay the dance floor from scratch. Laundry. After washing my laundry, you can hang it on this line.
He says hello to your mother. I'm here about buying a boat. - It's a boat, my grandfather's boat. - I know, do you want to buy it?
- Nobody. I just called you two. My daughter is everything to me. I believe she is for you as well. However, the chest is essential to win the war we are starting. And what's worse, if we dig it out under the cover of darkness, it could cause damage to our alliance.
They claimed they sounded like the voice of God That warned them to stay away. How much of the story Avery made up is unknown. It is true, however, that the story achieved its intended effect. Captain... Billy chose it not by accident.
Are you okay? We found it. I can't see the crate. The tracks stretch for 200 meters. He brought it here.
- Maybe from 200 meters. - More. He wouldn't get that far ahead of people, carrying that crate. The crate was never here. He left it behind.
- More. He wouldn't get ahead of people that much by carrying that crate. The crate was never here. He left it behind. Will they realize we dumped it here?
He wouldn't get ahead of people that much by carrying that crate. The crate was never here. He left it behind. Will they realize that we dumped it here? We have to bury it.
Even with duplicitous returns and the outflow of institutional funds, when quantitative funds were created and lit our way to collapse, we stubbornly refused to change. Looking at the longer term, we are already dead. I know this, even if you don't. But in this microsecond, while we are still breathing air, I intend to fight the inevitable. If you have a folder in front of you, pick it up and hold it in front of your face.
Do you clean every day? Usually yes, but this month we have a truncated lineup. Who used the two after Miss Palfrey's death? No one. We closed it out of respect for the deceased.
Today the Pilgrim probe with samples of Martian soil completes its eighth month of return from Mars. Acquiring these samples has been the goal of our mission over the past months. But the probe has been damaged. At 6:30 UTC, Pilgrim collided with debris and veered off course. Rory Adams will go outside the deck, locate the flying probe and then capture it with a remote arm.
The creature killed four of the six ISS astronauts. Dr. David Jordan probably died sending the entity into space. My colleagues sacrificed themselves to maintain safety. Commemorate their dedication to this cause. Martian life forms should be considered hostile. Do not underestimate their intelligence and adaptability. We do not know how to stop or eliminate it, but if this creature ever reaches Earth, do everything possible to destroy it, otherwise humanity will be in danger.
My friends, just.... I can't let them fight the Beast without me. Do you want me to go with you to Fillory? Ok, we may have a solution, a weapon. If we can find it, we can kill the Beast with it.
Good evening, gentlemen. Now that we're all here, let's get to the point. You know about my obsession with time travel. How is your novel coming along? Have you finished it?
I assume it's something from my future. Why didn't you write anything more in this letter? Trust me, I'm breaking my head over this. Clearly, I needed to convince myself to trust Vanessa, but there is danger in knowing your future. You would be tempted to change it.
Talk to me. I can see that you are angry. I'm telling you, if I were down there in the basement, that needle wouldn't be evidence. No. I would have shoved it down his throat, making sure it poked all his internal organs along the way.
I don't know. I... I remember things, I remember seeing the moment when Cam proposed to you and how happy you were. I remember that you wore a cigarette behind your ear to remind you of your father. I remember how proud you were when your book was published, even though I find it too corny.
Let me know if you need anything. Of course. Why do you need this plant? It's for my new office. - Are you going to take it to the other end of the States?
We missed you at the scene. - Are you all right? Totally. - Is this the victim's skull? - Yes. Angela just finished scanning it so she could do a facial reconstruction.
I'm just not hungry and that's it. Dr. Brennan, how is your audiobook career going? - Don't encourage it. - Excellent, thank you. I finished recording my version and sent it to my publisher.
The diameter of the hammer head is the same as that of Margaret Kwan. The size of the cracks is identical. However, Mike Reiss was tortured much more brutally and longer than Margaret Kwan. Margaret was tortured to get information. Once the killer received it, he quickly ended her life.
Everything will be fine. I'll make sure everything is in place here. Tom, what the hell happened? Two armed men raided a safe house. How did they find it?
As for contact lenses? This could mean a double donation of platelet cells. A double donation? This is a rare type of blood donation. I do it myself, but it can be done no more often than every four months.
Booth? What are you doing here? I gave your purse to Arastoo. My purse? I thought Michelle had it.
It was ... a brilliant move. But you made it clear during the election that you didn't want my help. I didn't need it. San Benito County made the difference. You had a win in your hand and you lost it.
Is there another message? Before I hacked into the server someone else got in there and manually deleted the message from the server. - What was there? - I don't know yet. I am trying to recover it.
- I don't know yet. I'm trying to get it back. Frankie Vargas passed away before he was able to assume the office to which he was elected. But his achievements, his selfless work and his dreams show us a clear path. Even if we don't have a message we have the phone number of the person who recorded it.
You don't have to introduce me to your betters. Where did you get that dress? - I beg your pardon? - The dress. Where did you get it?
Who is it? It's you. You mean to say that you have been involved in this since.... The game appeared a few days after the action at the school for the blind. We hid it at Spencer's house.
Ali's child. No, no. No one will tell Ali anything about it. Did you see the book with your own eyes? Yes, Emily and Hanna called for me when they found it.
No one will tell Ali anything about it. Did you see the book with your own eyes? Yes, Emily and Hanna called for me when they found it. Where is it now? They put it back in its place.
Girls are easy targets. Please look me in the eye and tell me that Hanna is not in trouble. She's not in trouble. Sheila, that swing has been hanging from that tree since we bought the house. I wouldn't even know how to take it down.
- Good night. - Good night. Are you absolutely sure? Mona has the game. Not only does she have it, she can also control it.
Give fatherly advice on how to accept a father who is.... you. - Does that blood give you the creeps, too? - Yes. Scofield said that with this we will atone for the guilt. All I have to do is deliver it to him.
Since I'm the owner, isn't it by chance my foray? The chief is dead. I was shot. This is our money. I don't want to sound like your mother, but where have you seen her lately?
Do you understand? Before you know it, you will deserve to survive. I hope. They are the ones who inherited the Earth. They have six months to save it.
- How can you know that? Let's call it faith. Faith may work for the Comanche, but the bankers want evidence. Do you have any evidence, anything? Phineas, if you had cash, would you invest it in this oil?
- When you were little, I didn't hug you, I didn't care. I didn't know about postpartum depression. - That's not why. - Never mind. I talked to Jean Williamson. Do you remember her?
Why. Your sample has been destroyed. You are to appear at the counseling center on Monday. Destroyed, that is. I dropped it, accidentally.
It's the superintendent's idea - I'm supposed to finish at 9 p.m. or after two beers, whichever comes first. I thought I was doing the right thing. Next time I'll give it to myself. This sculpture... Caroline Andersen made it?
You asked me about the map of this place Bajie is always reliable Are you sure that it is up to date? And who knows ? I got it from the oldest digger in this byie
Yes, Rip was welcoming us. Do you remember his speech? I know you don't remember. You were snapping your beak non-stop yourself. Sure I remember it. You just repeated it word for word.
I can't believe you did all this in three days. Am I seeing things correctly? Did you accelerate the date of the retrial? Yes. Three dates, depending on your and Kevin's availability. I moved the closest to the fourth. You moved it up by almost three weeks.
Fall. What happened to you? Give me a razor blade. You're not going to kill yourself, are you? Give it to me!
All they care about is Ramal. We will save Sid if we escape from here. They will forget about him and start chasing us. Good job. Pick up the pipe, attach a spoon to the end and bring it closer here.
- Yes. - We're screwed. - Unless I put this ball to good use. What? - I admit that you used it well.
- At the moment no one knows him. - What should I do? Play by his rules. Put on your own mask. When an opportunity to run away with Mike presents itself, take it and disappear.
This is what I needed. Drink up, guys. No sleeping on watch. Have you taken care of the battery? It discharged, but we replaced it a few hours ago.
They control their urges. Think Lucian Graymark, sorcerers like Magnus Bane, and even.... Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon? No matter how good they try to be, the Underground can't fight their demon blood forever. If this blood is so bad, why did you give it to me?
Valentine wants it. You know that if you touch this Sword, it can destroy the entire Underworld, including Simon. Valentine needs a source of energy. Lightning. He has it.
Too much for sunny California. When we're done here, we have to go to the 1600 block of Vine Street. - Why, please tell us. - It's where Frank Sinatra's star is on the Avenue of Fame. I've always wanted to see it.
I mean you feel something, and as a result of the departure of your partner, it is normal. I don't have feelings. Run the tests, fix my brain. What's up? Sara asked that we find any description of the spear to help us find it.
Thanks for believing in me, HR. I was waiting for the right moment to tell you. What to tell you? Right before he died, HR asked me to give you a message. Pvt. tell Cisco that it took strength and he gave it to me.
There is no doubt that it was him. This also explains why I was terrified and ran away. It makes more sense than a disguise. Except that the prosecutor will demand to see the DNA tests and then they will notice that a third set of DNA was also tested, and that could lead them to Doug Harvey. If they find out how you got that toothbrush.... I found it. In his dumpster on the street.
- Where is Walker's man? - Curtis and Rory are guarding him. He's protecting him from me. I still think it's a mistake that we don't press this schmuck to say the location of the sale. We don't have to, we'll get it within the hour.
The bomb is not here. Walker heads for the hangar. There's a chance that's where the nuke is. Why the ruse? Why sell a nuclear weapon once when I can steal it back and sell it to another rogue sucker?
And he said that's exactly what you're going to say. - The bomb is in countdown mode. - What is it! It's wired with a fuse. We had to trigger it when we came in. - Can you disarm it?
Fortunately, for us, we have both, friends as well as money. As I believe, your presence here means that our .... agreement ...has borne fruit. The package has been delivered to this place. The bank codes are inside. All you have to do is pick it up.
Mom, this is not the way to do things. These are personal matters. In our family, this is how we do things. This tradition was started by Simon's father. We continue it to honor his memory.
Jace? Is he okay? Where is he? I can only show you the right way. - You have to walk it yourself.
I have always admired your courage and sincerity. These are the qualities of a great leader. Why should I believe you? What did you write Imogen? I reminded her that Clave has a big secret. I threatened to reveal it.
The water surrounded her and froze her to amen. / It's her. - Are you sure? - The blue sweatshirt. She was wearing it when she went missing.
This is no ordinary biotoxin or genetic manipulation tool. It's alien technology. - Still want to destroy our sample? Especially now. Miller also wanted to destroy it.
Make sure to tell them. Hi, Alex. - What are you doing? - I'm correcting the Martian flag. - I think you're disfiguring it.
They send all the data here. This is an abandoned relay station. At least some of the people responsible for Eros will be there. We must occupy this station if we want answers. It drifts in silence and can barely be seen on radar. But there is also a habitation ring there.
I have to go. Your clever Mercy lured the tosser out in her dead mother's voice. Nothing incites a crowd more to quick violence than threats against a child. Silence. We are trying to restore your reputation, not slander it.
She was the only victim in Mary Sibley's lust for power. I knew... when I saw her sparkling like an uncut diamond in this nest of debauchery, that I had to free her from the cruel circumstances to which this heartless city had condemned her. You are a good and pious man, Judge Hathorne. I am. Surely love is where we find it.

- Something more poetic? - We are not poets, Tarly. - Please take a moment for me. It's okay. Make good use of it.
He deserves our respect. Jeb's respect. My gift to you. We will tell the story. You can tell it any way you want.
Friday or not at all. I'll be honest, Mr. Mayor. I am not fond of you. I won't hold back. - The audience expects the truth and I'm giving it to them.
- Wait! - Stop it! - Take his gun. - Take his gun! - Give it to me.
- Stop it! - Take his gun. - Take his gun! - Give it to me. - Give it to him!
I'm supposed to kill you. - And what does that mean for us? - It's up to you. Someone has to replace me at the Tribunal. Someone who will figure out what the weapon is and how to stop it.
You think it's part of you, but it doesn't have to be that way. Do you know why you were so easily defeated? - You don't. - Your rage blinds you. You want to control her, but she controls you. Since that night.
The first time you felt rage after the death of your parents. - Do you remember? - Yes. The rage burned inside you ever since. It fed on your pain and overshadowed everything else. If you don't do anything about it, one day it will completely consume you. We must remove it before that happens.
- Your uncle's autopsy. Ballistics tests gave a contradictory result. However, there were post-mortem abrasions at the entry wound. - What do you want to say? - Someone removed the bullet that killed him and replaced it with another one.
If she came to you, she finally understood that Mario was insane. Last wish? Yes, my badge. If I'm going to die, I want it on me.
The virus sample from Hugo Strange.... - It has disappeared. - Maybe Lucius took it. - Only you know the combination? - Yes. No. Lee also knows it.
I'm getting used to it. And I'm getting used to this rifle. Thermal-guided cartridges are just the beginning of this rascal's capabilities. - Where did you get the Plunder gun? - Barry rolled it for me.
I can't lose her, Cisco. Say you figured out how to change the future. We found a way to change the future. Seriously? No, but Caitlin and I figured out how to map it.
And where is Julian? He's in London dealing with family matters. For your information, we are just friends. Friendship zone. I know her very well.
My mother used to say that musicals have the power to change everything for the better. And did they succeed? I do not know what the future days will bring The future to change I will not be given either But I want us to spend it together
I'll run into your arms... Your arms I don't know What the future days will bring The future to change It won't be given to me either But I want us to spend it together
- We are building a launcher. - Well, such a bazooka. A trap. We need to power it with something extremely powerful.
But you have to stop using it against my boss. You know I did it for you. I know, now sit down.... I made you a grilled cheese sandwich. I burned it, but now you can't say I never cooked for you anymore.
We were a little bit of a mess and he threw something out the window. So maybe he should be the one to help you look for it. He, he took the morning off from work. Anyway he doesn't want me to have this thing. In fact, I don't know myself why I want it.
So maybe he should be the one to help you look for it. He, took the morning off from work. Anyway he doesn't want me to have this thing. In fact, I don't know myself why I want it. Because when I have it, I just feel better.
I could have called Damon. He has the third part of the bell. The heart. Which is? The iron ball. His sister told him to take it from the Maxwells.
I received a call about a fight in a cafe. The two guys almost killed each other. I have a feeling that Mystic Falls is no longer as safe as it used to be. Tell me about it. Is this ancient Tupperware? Elena, Bonnie and I created our own time capsule when we were 11 years old and buried it right under this tree.
Jana urged me to smuggle for Burt, - but I refused. - Then why did you run away? On Jana's last flight a shipment went missing. - A package? - Burt thought she had stolen it?
He had to maintain his reputation. If one gets robbed, the rest will think it's possible. But then who has the package? How did you find me? I'm sorry I took it.
In fact, I ask you to explain the truth to him. If he is to make an informed decision about Chlo about his future here, he needs to know the facts. Right? I said "please," didn't I? If this information is as upsetting as you present it, I'm not interested in being a messenger.
Sam? Hey. I don't see it. Have you seen the registration? Yes, I have it.
It's not Cass' fault that Heaven has such crazy rules against Nephilim. Your daughter. You think... Her name was May and she was beautiful. I think this doll is disturbing. Her father gave it to her.
Your daughter. You think. Her name was May and she was beautiful. I think this doll is disturbing. Her father gave it to her. He loves her.
But now look at yourself. You are sad and pathetically weak. So now... I will help you. I will cure your human weakness the same way I cured mine -- by cutting it out.
I don't know you and I have no intention of taking orders from anyone. Especially from some british official. - You didn't fully understand me. - But I did understand. No offense. but take this offer of yours.... and shove it deep up your ass.
My name is Dean Wi-- Winchester. My name is... My name is... myself... Gideon Loughlin The address was in the accountant's papers. If the book is there I will find it.
That's how we're comfortable. So if you want the crown, It's yours. Unless... Sure... I'll take it.
Sometimes literally. And I never murdered you anyway, Ketch. We often had sex with each other. Hmm. I've been learning about the situation in America and how to fix it for years.
Hey. Where is your older brother? Right here. It's a cool toy. I got it from an old -- new friend.
Who gave you the flowers? I don't know. I found them in front of the door. There was a note next to them. - Can we take it?
Everything will be fine. I found this bag while working. Did you touch it? Yes, at first. I thought it was lost by a customer.
They will be there in 20 minutes. Let's go and tease him. You searched everything the day before yesterday. That bag was not there. Are we supposed to believe that you find a suspicious bag, for example, in a shed, pick it up, leave prints and DNA and rummage through it?
Where is the ball? Walk! - Don't shoot it. - Hit it. We threw it over the fence.
Are you sure it's the closest? I'm sure it is. Jacquelyn, can you bring a very large line? Jacquelyn? I will bring it myself.
This is Uncle Monty's writing. He probably wrote it in the movie theater. We were right next door. We would have seen that he got the message. Unless he got it in a secret way.
Take a week off. - That's right. - Thank you. Aaron told me himself. He revealed this information to the Hookstraten announcer, and she passed it on to Leonard.
Only I don't know numbers here. What I know how to do is bring out of people their best abilities. This company is in fucking trouble, But whatever Axe Cap is at the moment, I know what's best for it. You'll get it there, too.
I need permission. - I hear you're already on the boat. - Great. I'll take it that you agree. Bosch, what the fuck? I think Woody Woodrow hid the cash there, and Dobbs is tracking it.
Punctured the colon, ruptured the iliac artery. More blood. All we have. The artery is too damaged to repair. Tie it at both ends and connect it by a sternum to the opposite artery will prevent leg ischemia.
I set its amount at $2,500. I fucked up. Chuck did me in again. He made sure Ernie heard the tape. Because he knew Ernie would tell me about it, and I would come to destroy it or steal it there.
You bet. We can. But dinner is almost ready. I'd have to throw out a good fish. Just throw it in the pan.
If you don't feel up to it.... I'll just say it this way. - Maybe you don't have to testify. - I have to. Only I can explain the context of the tape. - Otherwise the defense will sink it.
With no physical evidence, I decided that a recorded confession would give me the best chance. The tape alone would mean little, but it's always a start. A foundation for a more solid case. Jimmy must have decided that the tape was sufficient evidence. Otherwise he wouldn't have broken in to destroy it.
There was a lot of fuss about it, but we haven't talked about that tape of yours until now. The opportunity for that was lost when you barged into my house and destroyed it. Bottom line. That was my mistake. But I would like to pull the subject of why and how you recorded it.
Jimmy McGill has worked tirelessly to establish a practice that will help a neglected and ignored segment of our society. The elderly. You have listened to many of Mr. McGill's clients today. Each of them came here to support their lawyer. Jimmy McGill reached out to people who had not seen a lawyer in their entire lives. He took the time to make sure their wills accurately reflected their wishes at a price that was affordable for them. Because Jimmy McGill cares about people. He sacrificed three years of his own life to help his brother. He would get up at 5 a.m. to buy Charles' favorite newspaper at the only newsstand in town that brings it in.
I can't turn into... an advertising profiteer. Moment. Repeat after me. "Special offer. Today we are shooting a commercial, and tomorrow we are releasing it." Today we are shooting a commercial, and tomorrow we are releasing it.
- Something like a bribe. - And you get your taxes out of the way. - Such a thing will pass? If someone approached me with such an offer.... - I would accept it.
- I read your file. - You don't qualify as a detective.... - I really appreciate all this. All this technology, but it's the cops who solve the cases. You haven't seen my technology yet. If I'm wrong, I'll leave you alone, and if you like it, you'll help me.
Well. Move on to the world. I have to write something. I'm working on an autobiography. How do you think I should title it?
Now help us find it. How did my team get into the facility? Mr. programmed the servers to overheat, and open the vents. Which shut down the network. I want you to recover it.
I think it is. How is the case going there? Do you think he did it? Between you and me... He's a bit of a nut. It's my first murder case, so if I make it to trial, my career will take off.
To find out who tried to kill you and why. I don't want you to meet with anyone until I am sure, - that it is safe. - I can't not meet with a confidante. You asked for my help, and now you will get it.
What to do. Really? Great. I'll use it and you won't regret it.
Your father has tremendous influence. And he has put all the money we have into this business. Dad really is... Dad is a businessman. He saw an opportunity and took it.
Please take your seats. I would like to start the funeral ... With a few words about Jason. You will only make it worse. The last time I saw Jason, I was wearing this dress. I know it's impossible, but I swear that when I put it on I feel like he's in the room with me.
You know, like mother to mother? No. Mom, please. She really needs our help. You wanted to hire my team on the first day of construction? When an opportunity comes, you have to take it.
Who are these people? I say this in confidence. They are from Daddy's board. They have sensed weakness. That's why they are here. They are worried that Daddy is losing control of the company and are looking for a way to take it away from us.
No wonder, then, that they descended upon us, like some biblical plague. Nearly 100 years ago, Grandfather Blossom came to this sacred maple tree. The annual extraction ceremony heralds the blessing of each season. I have performed this ceremony many times in my life. When my son, Jason grew up, he also performed it.
Why do I feel put off? Will you tell him, or should I? What is it all about? We went to your dad's trailer.... To search it, Jughead.
Everyone. Breaking into your dad was bad, but at least something good came out of it. I'm pretty sure my dad was arrested for murder. That gun wasn't there when we searched the trailer. Someone planted it after we left.
In fact, I talked to Hiram, and well.... We would like to pay you back. Fred. I got you into a situation you never wanted to be in. Make me an offer in writing. And I will consider it.
Ride! Yes... We made it. They say they are preparing for the coming apocalypse. Probably for causing it.
Sorry, I didn't have time to clean up. I'm working on something. - Really? On what? - I'm writing a suspenseful novel. I think that when I finish it, in the right hands it could make a really good movie.
Then what do we do with ... Where do we put it? There is a place in the forest, on a mountain pass. There will be snow there.... There is such a small clearing, next to an abandoned hut. We found it when we were collecting leaves for...
We sit back and wait for a miracle. We don't have to wait. We can use the machine. No, it's unstable. We can stabilize it, you and me.
Now take advantage of that and ask Charlie out on a date. Yes, or at least to a car dealership. Thanks again. She's great... I'll take her for a ride!
/Another resistance movement is growing outside the colony. What if it was an attempt to recover the lost glove and take it outside the walls? I made contact with the pilot. I represent the resistance movement from outside the colony. I'm here because the real war is about to begin. And what you stole will help us win it.
Neither did the baby. Shelagh, don't get sick from these nerves. I'm afraid I'll forget something. Everything happened so fast. You didn't lose your cool then, you'll keep it today too.
From me it pours out like milk. Let someone take him! Thank you for taking care of him. His handkerchief! Keep it.
Neither we nor the patients are machines. Community nursing precludes such a rigid approach. We are crossing a very thin line. I don't know if Sister Ursula is even capable of making such decisions. Listen, Sister Ursula was a supervisor in a religious rural infirmary when it was closed by inefficiency.
If I am allowed and if I can choose.... please call me by my first name, which is Cynthia. There are so many hidden wounds, so many kinds of invisible scars. At one time Nadifa decided not to have her daughter circumcised. It was a bold step and required courage, like any new path. The soul, stronger than we think, can survive any mutilation, and the marks left behind make it perfect and complete.
- Can we...? Please, put the gun down. - Why? Why? So that you can pick it up and kill me?
As I said, it is impossible to download so much in a day. Well. There are two federal agents here. Since you were considering kidnapping, that means you have cash. Please hand it to me, or I'll go out into the hallway and tell everyone that I was denied payment.
I write the address, and they just.... deliver. No questions asked. Without deviations. No interruptions to consider eternity.... Or beauty.... or death. Even you, with all your conviction of free will, If a package arrives in your name, you can't even imagine doing anything else.... Than to open it.
Fortunately, you are at home if Pasha needs you. Yes, but I would like to work. Do you not like your work? Oh, I don't know myself. Sometimes I think I even like it.
They will face most of the Lannister forces. The enemy will be outnumbered, have better armor and more weapons. But my sister's soldiers are fighting for her out of fear. The Unsullied are fighting for a greater cause. For freedom and the queen who gave it to them.
So why did you move? It's a long story. I was a medic at the S.T.A.R.S. branch in Raccoon City. I've always been interested in medicine. I don't want it to be used for disreputable purposes.
I would prefer to pick up Rebecca first, but the tankers are a priority. We have three tasks. The first, blow up the tankers. The second, recapture Rebecca. The third, get the vaccine and distribute it in the city.
- The seasoned detective points the finger at a colleague, then denies under pressure. What is really going on in the Gunn case? Are the police covering it up? That's just the story. You can write it.
No, he was here, in the real world. But he experienced something ... disruption. Holden's connection to the Kingdom is stronger than I could have imagined. As for the machine... Holden destroyed it.
We really need to... I said right away. Sorry, I lost my wallet. Buy that boat. Buy it and let's go somewhere.
- Of course it is. - You have to pay for it. - Pay for her. Succinctly. When you give me the cash and I put it in the safe, you call Audrey
Songs. I don't want to sing it. Why not? Scarlett, it's just a song. You didn't see a problem when we chose it.
I don't want to sing it. Why not? Scarlett, it's just a song. You didn't see a problem when we chose it. We sang it every night on the tour and it didn't bother you.
- Absolutely not. - Because it worked! You got me! And I'm trying hard to get through it there, but singing this song is a little difficult for me. And now we're going to sing it all the way through, for a good couple of months.
It was a wonderful evening. - Thank you guys. - Thank you. Listen, this may sound like madness, but I have to say it. I see an opportunity here and I'd like to take it with you and Highway 65.
No, I rather missed it. Me too. Save your body for later in life. Yes. Since you didn't ask, the reason why I'm here. is that Mr. Wheeler is selling his company, and Rayna and I want to buy it.
It's terrible! I don't understand. What is he trying to do? He wants your attention. And he gets it.
It feels like. someone has sewn you into someone else's skin, which is on your skin, and you can never take it off without feeling like you're being stripped of that skin. You've barely slept at all. Bottom line. Honey, I thought it would be easy to describe our story. It was not easy to live it.
- I listened to my session. I? It was strange for me to hear myself singing a Rayna song. Yes, I can imagine. But you sing it for her.
I'm still thinking about it. I don't know. Maybe people will like Juliette's version better. Clay liked it. I don't know. If I change it, then.
I have a good streak. I'm glad you're back on the horse, too. You know what, don't get me down. - We have a song here. - Let's write it.
Because she's nice? Oh my God, you are so naive. Don't you understand? She saw an opportunity. And she took it!
You're thirsty and you walk into a bar. In it are the meanest types you've ever seen in your life. And they don't like you. What happens? Then the meanest guy at the bar grabs a bottle of Bud and slides it across the counter and sends it in your direction while the rest of the guys stare.
You're close with Rayna's daughter Maddie, right? I have a song that would be great for her. I'd be happy to pass it on. She doesn't think it's good for her. What if I record a song and put it on my album?
Yes, I love this song. It's just that she is Juliette, I don't know if I can sing it. What are you talking about? Of course you can. We can sing it together.
- Come to Texas. You can perform in a couple of concerts, or just go along for the ride. You're close with Rayna's daughter Maddie, right? I have a song that will be great for her. I'll be happy to pass it on.
It's that dress. I literally can't breathe. It's so exciting. Your first song is in a commercial. Think how many people will hear it.
No. I lost my cell phone. I can't find it anywhere. I'm sorry, honey. Do you remember where you last saw it?
- You pass through the wall. There is one lower point where the wall crosses the mountains. - It's about 45 meters high. - How do you do it? My drone takes the rope up and hooks it to the top.
It went so well that they offered me a position. - A position? - Yes. - They started such a new program and.... - Wait, did you accept it? Yes, I accepted it.
I need you, do you understand? Answer your phone. Yes, connect me with Webster. The call list is growing by the minute. - Shall we go through it together now or...?
Rethink it. /SIGNED PROPOSALS - We will resubmit the project. Olivia, it would be pointless. This bill, its language... We've reworked it hundreds of times, and no one wants it.
Less control. But why not dope or guns? If they brought something else, they'd have to strain when they wanted to sell it. Cash is cash. but they still have to launder it.
All satellite maps of the island are blurred. Susan's property is... here. And the marina ... here. And the village is somewhere here. They call it Rebirth, but that's all I know.
Young William. I guess they taught you to knock before you enter? I have your gun. That's wonderful! Where did you find it?
You can stay in my basement. It's a bit damp in there. - There may even be rats. - No, or something bigger. I want to say that I will clean it properly.
The Hurricanes are coming home. Our fighters land after a quick but victorious skirmish with enemy forces. They are part of the boys who broke Hitler's air offensive. In time they will stop it completely.
Can we focus on work? In the middle eight you start fast. A good place for a trumpet solo. No. I blew it out.
And we have a problem. Do you agree? - May I ask you a question? - If it's something relevant. You once worked on a case for two years, and then the prosecutor dismissed it because it wasn't a sure thing, and he was more concerned about statistics than administering justice?
And what do you have on your phone? Two karaoke bars and a masseuse. It's much more interesting than at my place. Have you ever been to karaoke? I respect music too much to profane it with my voice.
/ It's been better. Fowkkes just spoke up. Holland doesn't want a settlement. That's a good thing. I'm glad he turned it down.
Would you like some more coffee? Sure. Don't go so crazy with the fucking sugar this time. The bullet shattered the blade. They put it together with screws and plates.
- Yes, I solved the case. Your mother was Marjorie Phillips Lowe? That's right. The case is still open. I explained it for my own satisfaction.
Are you sure? Everyone will be watching. We didn't finish our conversation after the promotion. Great. We will finish it now.
These are experimental motorcycles that stood in the lab a while ago. - I said they are not ready. - Brandt, you have to do something for me. - I'm a little busy. - This is very important. Take your personal camera and put it as low on your back as possible.
Where is Wags? It's here. Continue. I want Wags to hear this. The game with Krakow, your hostility to it, what really animates it?
Graduates giving graduation speech, Phi Beta Kappa, Head of Crim. Did you ever get a four, Kate? - In third grade, in fine arts. - I got a chance to improve it.
They can't blame it on us. They have already blamed us for less. Meanwhile, we must continue our work. That is, to keep order in this colony. That's what I wanted to talk about. Everyone in the district saw the explosion. The resistance will want to attribute it to themselves for propaganda purposes.
- I am Noa. - Why did you come here? Because of the attack on the invaders? I am here... Because the real war is about to begin. And what you have stolen.... will help us win it.
I thought your mother would tell us that grandpa died. The meeting is not over yet. The monks' philosophy is simple. Take each thing in your hand and ask yourself: does it still give me joy? If it does, you leave it.
The monks' philosophy is simple. Take each thing in your hand and ask yourself: does it still give me joy? If yes, you leave it. If not, you thank it for its service - and throw it away.
- Enough of that. - Commander. Priority message to you. From Dawes. Cabinet. Let her go here.
How do you feel? Different... and the same... As if there were two of me. It's very confusing. Like so many things. I'm going to need that fabric, Nick. I want to take it to Rosalee. For what?
Bright. Set the camera so, - to cover the whole room. - I understand. You will only hear us through this earpiece, but put it in your ear only in the room.
What do we have here? Dr. Deirdre Hampton, professor of biochemistry and regenerative medicine, was working late in the lab yesterday when something went terribly wrong. Terribly wrong looks like this. It looks like nothing was lost. Her purse is lying by the door, unopened, she probably dropped it there.
Maybe that has to do with it. It does. I know you love Juliette. But you have to end it and never see her again. You want the truth, you'll get it.
Question... when it's ready, how do we give it to the destructor? Maybe we can fill the bullets with it, like we did with taranogr, remember? We shot him with that poison and it worked. - I still have that weapon. - Maybe we should take it.
Why don't we fill the bullets with it, like we did with taranogre, remember? We shot him with that poison and it worked. - I still have that weapon. - Maybe we should take it. I'll take it.
Proper waves, what's not? For the panic is not new, but for me it's a real discovery! Of course, do you know about Holy Well? No, and what is it? A cave between the rocks on the sea, with clean and fresh water and therefore consecrated by Saint Sawle himself a thousand years ago.
- I have to be ready. - Verity... My dear, don't feel sorry for me, but for Caroline. Her life with Dwight barely began, and I had six years of happiness. I have our beloved child. I never expected such joy, and even if it is gone, I will always be grateful that I had it.
Completely. I realized how the countryside had dulled me. I feel like I can breathe again. And since we arrived a little earlier than planned, you might want to accompany me to my next trial? I will try to make it as entertaining as my first one.
Don't answer now. Go home and consider everything I said. And give me an answer when you are ready. Soon. I will give it to you soon.
Should I be ashamed of him? To be related to the thief? You know very well that nothing of the sort happened. Geoffrey Charles... is a child whose feelings can be manipulated. Your chagrin feigned devotion to the household in an attempt to steal a valuable family heirloom, - surely, to cash it in.
You are wrong, my lord. I do not support bloodshed and lawlessness. But freedom, equality and fraternity - that's what I'm happy to subscribe to. It was not my intention to do so. Power must exist, someone must have it, and since man is not perfect, it is sometimes abused, but who is more prone to do so?
I do not support bloodshed and lawlessness. But freedom, equality and fraternity - that's what I'm willing to subscribe to. It was not my intention to do so. Power must exist, someone must possess it, and since man is not perfect, it is sometimes abused, but who is more prone to do so? The one who has barely acquired it, like the one who has never tasted wine?
- It was bad. I'm sure he regrets it. But if you argue, you will grieve me greatly with it. For you, mother, I will be polite. Who owns the old smithy on the outskirts of Trenwith? Ross purchased it for his brother-in-law.
Forgiveness. I forgive you. Is Westminster ready for Ross Poldark? Ready or not, change is inevitable. When the next offer comes, I believe he will accept it.
- Yes, he accidentally bumped into a child abuse website online. Yes, as he ordered a trip to Thailand. Did you pay the person who posted this garbage to become the owner? And maybe you traded those photos with other perverts? Regardless of how you organized your collection, someone stole it, and you paid large sums of money to return it.
The owner recently died, left his wife all the mayhem. So, that's why I need cash. I'll buy the pub. I will take over the contract and run it.
- Sure. Would you like coffee? I'd love to. I want to talk about your offer. - You have thought it through.
On the second day I was flying, and when I caused a "garbage storm," I fell on a rotting turkey carcass, and it exploded. All the cartilage and bones got tangled in my hair, and its skin coated all over mine. I don't know where I ended up. If it makes you feel any better, your skin looks amazing. My cafe was destroyed by a giant frog, and when I reopened it, it disappeared into a hole.
You said that I have the right to remain silent. Do I even have to answer these questions? No. But you must give us your cell phone. Please put it on the table.
Do I even need to answer these questions? No. But you must give us your cell phone. Please put it on the table. Please unlock it, immediately.
New me. Todd, answer honestly. Are you wearing my vest? I'm wearing your vest. Keep it.
- The other one. - What's up, I love your song "Mister DJ". You must sing it in the program.
Everywhere, however, heard the words of this Get out of here Get out of here.... I love this song. It massacres her.
Gus and I can organize something that would give back everything Mom would want and have everything that is important to you in it. And what would that be? We still have the element of surprise. Plus, the props guy from "Badge of Justice" made such a real bale of marijuana that we could sell it.
By helping Ghost, you protect everyone. I'll give you the money. Not bad. Are you sure it's clean? Petar transferred it from the company's account, so on paper it looks like a refund.
- Will you get a warrant? - In 20 minutes. We sweep the pawn shop. He comes in every few weeks with jewelry. Where does he get it?
- In 20 minutes. We sweep the pawn shop. He comes in every few weeks with jewelry. Where does he get it from? - I just buy it and sell it.
Prosecutor Kot is here. He would like to have a word. - May I have some water, please? - Yes. Do we have a theory? Because if so, I need to hear it.
They sleep in the open air, plunder, starve. The army roams with their stomachs! Bishop! Here I am. Didn't I help you grow in strength and keep it?
It's been 8 years. Any ideas why the kidnappers contacted only now? It was all over the press. We had a software company. We sold it for 23 million.
I won't spoil it for you. - In five hours the end! - We will wear a different biretta and toga. This sash has been worn by everyone honored for decades. I won't be the one who lost it after it survived earthquakes and wars, and the gravy fire in the cafeteria in '64!
You need the cart. It is yours. I don't know what to say. How about "made it?" I've wanted this car ever since I saw it, but I knew my parents wouldn't let me have it.
He is yours. I don't know what to say. How about "made it?" I've wanted this car ever since I saw it, but I knew my parents wouldn't let me have it. I also knew they wouldn't keep it if I gave it to them, so....
Can't I at least talk about it? We're not going to terminate this pregnancy. How long would I have to have chemo? It depends on what the oncologist recommends. As a rule, it is given in cycles of 1-4 weeks followed by a break.
Okay, what about you? Won't you ask me to sit down? I usually can't sneak past you. I'm just a little busy. I have to figure something out quickly I hit a roadblock, and I don't know how to get around it.
We need to hold off on procedures. Why? Our patient has just confessed to a crime. That means this gun is evidence. And since his father convinced him to withdraw his consent, we have to get a warrant to remove it.
His oncologist ordered them through the hospital. He had no other way to get them. Was he waiting for his son to die? Mr. Moore. We know that his son was prescribed new oral chemotherapy, and you withheld it.
- Please help them - Bleeding head wound. Cut temporal artery. Give me two forceps. I need to clamp it.
I'm sorry, but I have to keep you for a 72-hour psychiatric observation. For your sake. What? A 72-hour one? You wanted my attention then you got it.
Mr. President. We don't know who survived, but our top agents are looking for the quinjet. Agent Burrows had a briefcase, but we don't know if he was on board. Yes, sir. Let's hope Director Mace has it.
Probably a lot more than it pays you. If you are making me an offer, go ahead. It looks like we have two options here. Either I crush this suitcase to the size of a baseball and no one gets what they want, or.... Or we can kill you and take it for ourselves.
The guy is a tough guy. Do you have any cyanide? - Why should I... - Or a paper bag. You put it on my head and quickly strangle me.
Electricity is used to execute criminals. Does that mean we shouldn't power hospitals with it? It's not the same, and you know it. There are always risks associated with science. However, that doesn't mean we stop developing it.
- And you just had my wrist slit. Well. A lot of blood. - Did you cut the radial artery? - I tried to avoid it.
Not true. The most important human trait seems to be regret. You even ordered to fix one thing each that people in the Structure regret. Yes. You show poor self-control, doctor, and if one day you regret creating the Structure, you can order me to destroy it.
What happened here? For 70 years after World War II, nothing. No one even knew about it. But a few years ago, a brave agent, Billy Koenig, gave his life to pass this location on to me. It took so much time to restore it....
And already two female agents qualify. - Jemma Simmons and Daisy Johnson. - Non-human. She has crept into the Structure. They have their memories and are trying to destroy it.
I've seen it before. It was designed to create elements. This looks like creating something even more complex. The machine there required a huge amount of energy. It was powered by a hydroelectric dam.
Don't move! Calm down. We are not the enemy. - Let's keep calm and... - Shut your robotic mouth. Or they will weld it to you.
It was amazing. You are amazing. Did you read that contract? It expects you to be the perfect girl. We have a secret, so if you don't want me to talk it out, we'd better discuss the new contract.
You have met Katie's ghost. Respect her other half. The girl who was. This is the soil from where she was last seen alive. Keep her.
It won't be easy without a husband. Why don't you worry about yours? You have to go back to Jezebel. You have to take the package. You have to hide it and someone will contact you.
Damn it, Mike, if you can't be honest with me, we're ending this conversation. Yes, I screwed something up. Finally, a blade of truth. I work in a legal clinic, but not as a lawyer. I faced the opportunity to become one and turned it down, but then I had to idly watch a woman lose her home because I couldn't help her.
Newton believed that light was composed of particles. Professor Godfrey lectured on the wave nature of light. And you came through the door. A wave needs something to move against, right? - That's what makes it a wave.
We allowed ourselves to believe. We guessed. You were right, William. He found a man with similar features and killed him. So he removed the bullet from his own arm and placed it in the corpse.
Bright. They have made progress in transplanting limbs. I like to remember what I was given. Your suggestion... I have thought it over.
Any signs of forgery? - Remote access? - No, sir. We checked three times. He's the one who worked on the machine, this only proves that he knows it better than we do.
Whitford gave me a gun. Just in case. - Can you operate it? - Somewhat. I can load it.
You have to come up with something. What is the shipment? Apparently important. And don't open it. You need to hide it and someone will contact you.
! - Be nice, Suzy. I didn't recognize the name. White, gray, had a sick leg. And yes. He broke it.
So...in this little book we have a whole list of your clients. This Tod had quite a party on the 13th. You supplied him with a lot of drugs on the day Julie-Ann died. I have never seen this booklet before. One of your cops must have planted it.
But by lying to us, you helped the scoundrel who did it. Did you conceal anything else? Anything. Her bag. She left it behind.
Did you conceal anything else? Anything. Her bag. She left it behind. A destroyed old thing.... But I kept it.... In case it ever came back.
Thank you. - Hi. - Soda. - I see, thank you. - I found it.
You didn't have to kill her. Sara shouldn't die, not like that, not at your hands. Not a reason for anything, Jax. History is war, slavery and holding your dead sons in your hands. There's no point in defending history, so we might as well burn it.
Thermonuclear bomb. They intend to destroy National City, and accuse hostile aliens of doing so. How did this weapon get into the hands of Cadmus? It didn't get in. They built it.
Dad, are you there? I am, Alex. We are waiting for your instructions as soon as we go inside. Be careful. If anything happens to the bomb before you defuse it, the whole city will blow up.
To find out who can do more, and who has already scored the best year. I think talking about what has been clearly demonstrated is pointless. I know that analysis is your cradle and numbers are your kingdom, but there is this other side. Few know the math. Even fewer know how to explain it.
That is, he spotted Keith with the guitar, or the killer himself, who took it from Keith. He followed him home. Woody was finding targets in a shopping mall. Why would the killer take the guitar there? To sell it, perhaps to price it?
Forever. Open your eyes. You can't fall asleep. I'll tell you a story. And you can't fall asleep to hear it.
- You don't understand. There will be no exchange. She wants Elijah dead so she can get energy from his sacrifice. She has already poisoned him with rose thorns. She wants the bone by sunset. If she doesn't get it, she'll come here and take it for herself.
That's the point. We don't understand it or how to stop it. But one thing is certain... We need help. And I'm going to get it.
Tierra means land. As in, hearts will defend it. Watch. Here is our bone. Give it to me.
Can you hear the music? Is it from here? Jesus Christ. Thank you. I can still hear it, can you?
Show a little respect, Julius. - Julius don't be rude. Newton's second principle of dynamics. You all know it, but delving more into Newtonian mechanics, you need to more than know it.
Everyone could see that he was driving straight into the wall, like Dale Earnhardt at Daytona. And what did you do to stop it? No. No, please. If a crash is coming, accept it.
Earmuffs. Okay, we're there. Turn on your night vision goggles. Let's go, let's go. The gate is locked, I'll have to break it down.
Well, this is very... Yours. The girl you saw; Visions are often more symbolic than literal. I have a book on Bhakti trance interpretations. I'll go through it and see if I've missed anything.
Let's be happy to be back. I missed it. Come on over here. The cops will be pissed that you're giving an interview before you testify. I gave the exclusive right to tell my story to the world before I tell it to anyone else.
You shoot a guard and say "hey"? - Are you fucked up? - Apparently. Where did you get the gun? That fucking Humps brought it in.
"The righteous man rejoices when he sees the punishment. He washes his feet in the blood of the wicked." You certainly have hideous feet. That's the problem with women in prison. Men understand violence, they respect it.
I need to know where the nickname came from. I explained mine. Let me know, then I'll try to get coffee. I was friends with Tracy Loomis. But she went through puberty before me and became popular because a rumor went around that David Rosen put her between the boobs. So I named her after her, because my vagina is a bitch.
It doesn't belong to you or your blood-red king. I can't let you do that. You have no choice. Good technique. I know it well.
You said so yourself the night you captured me. Deliver the guy behind the robbery and my debt will be paid. That was when I thought it was impossible. Well. Be careful who you ask for a star from heaven. Some nut will bring it to you eventually.
I should let them take the money. The money I gave you from the robbery was for college for Cristina. There were other important things at the time. Moving Miguel out of her life. Okay, then since Miguel left town with the money, who is spending it?
Have SWAT plant some stuff in Quince's bedroom. Then they'll bust your brother for smuggling before they even write the papers. - Is that what you want? - I'm looking for revenge. And you thought you'd get it by barging through the door with a caster and no badge?
At least he was leading his battles. So she is here? Loud and clear. The basis for the accusation? You have her.
And especially the son of Woz. I didn't make anything up. And that's exactly what you'll tell Woz when he finds out? I doubt he will be moved by your honesty. While I still have it.
Mom. What will be your first step, Mr. Beaumont? So, you have a strong position, so we will use a negotiating tactic called demonstration. Do we have a strong position? Donor blood has value only to you and only you can get it, which means it's in their interest as much as ours to resolve this quickly.
Whatever. Thanks. Goodbye. Where's my toy box? - They lost it.
I am a private investigator. Chicago. Why does dad need a private investigator? What about the envelope for dad? Have you already sent it to him?
Thank you. How did you find me? I called the pizzeria. I ordered a pizza. The kid who brought it sang everything to me.
Here's your crown, baby. Like a princess. What? Do you want the crown back? Take it back from me.
Yes, the buck stops coming from the chase. I think I'll throw in the closing credits against the backdrop of the chaos. Our fight was good. If I see it, I'll hate it, but it was ok.
Out of the way. I have the tape. Excuse me. Excuse me. I have it!
I know you exiled Kady, and you don't usually grant asylum, especially to witches. This is a special case. Julia and I have a past. Resolve it as you wish, but I point out, the girl will be safer in Brakebills. "How to transfer energy from one being and transform it."
And Bellamy Blake? Come on. Of course Clarke and Bellamy have to be on the list. Good leadership is the key to survival. You don't want a list. Let's tear it up.
Clear? Clear? Fixed. The cover is ready. Who will help me put it on?
- Hemorrhagic stroke or ischemic stroke? - We don't know yet if it's a stroke. Then what should it be? There is no fuel in the tank, but we have a lot of hydrazine in Arcadia. - All it takes is a day and we can have it here.
I joined d League of Women. I wanted to do something that would make me happy. My wedding ring. Where did you get it? When I ran away, I couldn't leave it. I thought you would want to get it back. Unless it raises too many unpleasant memories of how it was taken?
Your father's driver dropped this off. - Thanks. - For you, Bryan, everything. This coffee is terrible. How can you drink it?
Isn't this a literary club? I wrote a book... "Steady at the Helm." Yes. I read it in one sitting.
I know it all didn't work out, and I know you're in trouble because of it. But please don't destroy this city. You will get the commission one way or another. You know I don't give a shit about her. I'll be happy to return it.
And then we had to attach it. I'm not familiar with ratchet mechanism belts. Ee... Water pours into the boat. - No, it was there when I bought it.
- Good idea. - That's not a good idea! How about such an idea? Less so with that one. Let's take a cow, turn the middle into burgers and steaks, and then, instead of throwing away the skin, use it to cover the seats?
Your thoughtlessness and intolerance awakens an angry murderer in me. Did you seriously break your arm? It is decently cracked. - Don't touch it. - How did you break it?
Oh, my goodness! Oh, no! O! there was an unpredictable disaster of a submarine. - I have no idea what could have caused it.
Oh, no! O! there was an unpredictable disaster of a submarine. - I have no idea what could have caused it. - A monster bit her!
Legion! Screw you, prince! What is a legion? There are many demons in it and they all form one strong union. We will break it.
- How can you not know that? - Because I grew up as a slave princess in a harem, while you read comic books and build robot dogs. Right, but wait... Only Ferrans know the location of Ohron. How the hell do you know it?
Wait a minute. What if they created some kind of breach or hole between here and where they are? That's what this anomaly is, the only end of the breach. An interesting theory. If it's true, as long as the breach persists, we might be able to use it to track their position.
- Android Five, how are you doing? - We've made some changes to Blink Drive that should remove the damage caused by Ishida's scientists. How can we be sure? First, we will conduct a full diagnostic combined with a series of simulations. If the instability persists, we should detect it well before the final test.
Oh crap. So much for a roll of the dice. What? It's not my fault. She said the station was abandoned, not destroyed. Probably when Novina had to leave the station, they decided to annihilate it.
- Is that supposed to tell us something? - That's where you'll find the data. - How do you know? Out of the entire galaxy, only Tabor had access to this cache. - He was the one who cleared it.
Wait a minute. What if they created some kind of breach or hole between here and where they are? That's what this anomaly is, the only end of the breach. An interesting theory. If it's true, as long as the breach persists, we might be able to use it to track their position.
He left me a goodbye letter and an apartment. - And a list of contacts? - Yes. The transmission did not come from him. I sent it.
- Yes and no. When her hibernation chamber stopped working, I was able to save her digital consciousness. When you fall into a deep sleep, your consciousness transmits digital data to a base designed to maintain brain activity and avoid cerebral atrophy during long journeys. It is ripped back as part of the awakening process. So instead of uploading this digital consciousness to her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database?
It is ripped back as part of the awakening process. So instead of uploading this digital consciousness to her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database? At first, no. I didn't know how. I kept it on a separate medium.
So instead of uploading this digital consciousness to her dying body, you transferred it to the ship's database? At first, no. I didn't know how. I kept her on a separate medium. It was only recently that I discovered a way to upload her to a computer.
A member of our crew is still there. /Our people are also there, but it was a top-down order. /I can't help it. If you don't disarm the warhead, we will have to disable it ourselves.
- Wait a minute! - Have you tried on the purple one yet? - I don't like purple! - I don't like this jacket. - I love it.
"an interesting substance." "It's, uh, a viscous secretion "that exhibits extraterrestrial properties and has a light-affecting effect." where did Franklin find this substance? Uh, he found it in some colonists in Maryland.
That's all true, Mr. Williams, but your gun has traces of blood.... This is not my gun. And whose is it? Actually, I don't know. I found it.
He hung up. Max, can we just go into this horrible place we call home? This cougar just wore my new blouse. - And here it is! Don't tear off the tag if you'd like to return it.
Slippery but close. All right folks, can you close? I have to make it to the ship, - before it sails to New Orleans. My cousin Tim put a voodoo curse on me. I have to propitiate him to take it off.
That I was able to have a drink with you. I have to go. Great scotch. Sandicot won't get a gambling license. The commission granted it to some Catskills.
How do you know? She left me a note "You lied to me." Oh, fuck. And do you know what it was about? I know, I only lied to her once.
I hope so. Forgive me if you can. Axe asks if you have the Klaxo analysis. I do, but I still have to sign it. Should I tell him that he will get it?
And where is your regiment, general? On the other side of the Hudson in rebel blue? They wonder where their commander has sneaked off to? I know exactly who and what you are Please, here we are describing the war, not fighting it.
So. I assume the lobsters are gone? They haven't left. Wakefield moved quarters to Strong Manor. He put up a palisade. He called it Fort St. George.
Certainly, you can see that they love you. Well, okay, maybe I exaggerated a bit. To work well, you need to get to know your employees from the private side. You emphasized this phrase three times in your book. You left it in the kitchen.
- Are you sure it's him? - Yes. This vision was different. Longer, clearer. Something in Ravi's blue concoction enhanced it. Well.
I came to ask a favor. - Why are you holding this gala at all? - It's a tradition. It has always been held here. We used to organize it together with Constantine.
Strong enough to push back the Rider. This is your area of knowledge. All I know is that we have six hours until sunset. Can you take out the disc and move it to the Vault? I can examine it there.
A story for another day. We don't have much time to prepare. Think J Street is a trap, so if we lure the Horseman into it, we can use the Banneker plate to block his way back. But you said it's enchanted, so how do we open it?
The only thing you care about is what I can do for you. Oh, and you think Bajie's intentions are sincere, huh? He will leave you at the first opportunity, just as he left me... We will not leave without this book,Minerva! So come and get it for yourself! I remember when I was a little girl, you promised to help me decipher the secrets of this book.
Evie Beaumont. I am her father. You can check again, please. How did it go? He wants revenge. And Michelle is the way to get it.
That is, a plot on the life of the president. Death penalty. I want to believe that you had reasons for this, but if you don't tell me what they are, I can't help you. This is your last resort. Accept it.
- I will go to Mrs. Kirkman. - Thank you. In two days we have to get 51 senatorial votes, it won't be easy. The wording of the bill is not perfect. Senator Bowman chose it to drive me into a corner.
I don't know if it's the same in Iowa. But that's not the point. This bill is so general that it could be dangerous. I know - the House will tweak it.
Because it is a good decision. Thank you. I met with the President today to discuss Bill 8180, and we agree that changes to gun ownership are needed and that increased background checks for buyers will make Americans safer. That's why I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote for the bill and pass it to the House, where together we will...
- Nothing is a foregone conclusion. - I did what I could. You opened the door. If the bill passes, it will be to your credit. - The president knows that. - What if they block it?
You don't need to know why I'm looking for him. I met him several times. A scary guy. He spent 16 years in the special forces. He commanded top-secret operations in his unit. In 2000, he inherited a fortune from his father. He invested it in Browning Reed.
I was hopeless. But experience counts. I agree. Music has shaped my whole life. Leo loves it, too.
He came with an orchestra from a school in New Orleans named after his father. He told me that the school would lose funding for music lessons. Are you familiar with the funding of such programs? I remember that law. We had to add a sunset clause for the conservatives to accept it.
I met students from New Orleans who are taking music lessons subsidized by the National Endowment for the Arts. Unfortunately, the funding will soon end. Arts education is a topic that will be addressed with the new budget. They can't wait that long. If Congress does not reauthorize the grant, they will lose it in a month.
- I have to earn your trust. - Not just mine. The whole of NATO. Of course. But I would like to start with France. We started this initiative together, and I need you to finalize it.
I'm waiting to hear from my source. The one from Sandstorm? Apparently I haven't heard from him since Jane showed up. Yes, but before that it displayed an encrypted message to me. I check it every day.
After inserting the stent, we did research. The arrhythmia was caused by a septal defect. There is a very small hole between the chambers of the heart. Some people opt for drug treatment, but I recommend surgery. I will explain everything to you. Although it is a more serious operation, I have done it many times.
I'll raise it to 17,000 a year. - That's not enough. - That's as much as 10%. I pay you the most anyway. Don't go overboard. And finish the hovel so I can sell it.
Lights. Anything...? Nothing. Ron, was it that bad? When Olivia disappeared, and Kevin decided to finance this play by performing with the girl who wrote it, I said to myself:
Upstairs is an annex. There we have yoga, music classes, cooking classes and conscious eating workshops. - And there is a stable. - And where is the gym? - Did I miss it...?
Let's stick to the plan and the guitar. Let's repeat it. The bartender is old and not so smart. Every day at 8:30 pm he gets ready for the end of his shift. He opens the cash register, pulls out the cash for Ray's people to pick up later.
Sometimes they will make good decisions. It's just a meeting with the director. I don't have to get the role. Don't. I want you to get it.
Who is this man? Jane, his briefcase. The same one was in Chad's apartment. Radical genetic therapy fails when the brain rejects the new DNA. It seems impossible to change, but my father discovered a better method, and I developed it to perfection.
- But on the veranda, where the motion sensors are defective, - it is lit all the time. - How do you know this? I pay attention to details. I am not from the police. - He smashed the bust where he saw it.
I don't cringe. We cringe. Our bodies betray the inner truth. Release what limits you. Pain, deficiencies, fear. Replace them with energy, abundance and confidence.
You pretend they don't exist. Guns don't know feelings. Danny should be back by now. His chi may be in worse condition than we thought. But Master Lei Kung will fix it when Danny returns to Kunlun.
Help us through the diamond to solve the mystery of Magadha's treasure. Why is this diamond so special? Jiang Wen, can you explain it in Chinese? With pleasure. Eye of Shiva. Whoever conquers it will conquer the whole world.
A long time ago, someone like you used your abilities to shut them down. - How do you know? - Alexandra said. I was listening. That's how they made sure that only one person could open them.
What are these handcuffs? Police ones. With fur? Some criminals were allergic to metal. We covered them on the outside with a synthetic material.
- I don't know. Is there any evidence? The school newspaper. Graffiti. Laina doesn't like that we painted them over, because it's destroying evidence.
Sir, I know you value the Royal Garden and I am sorry. Thank you, Nabila. Do what you need to do. This is the hidden beauty of plants. They can be uprooted and cut down.
I could wish for world peace. It's such a classic. There's no need to ask for a bigger family since everyone is getting married to each other. I always wanted a younger brother, by the way. Or I could give them away.
I thought they had disappeared. Along with the others. I never even thought to look for them. If only... I took the cross from the chapel and took it to the place Where they died to mark them.
This is a garden that needs weeding, mowing and pruning. Here you will also chop wood. This is bathroom number seven, the only one you are allowed to use. It is equipped, but I regret to inform you that the shampoo does not protect against tears. It can even induce them.
- Maybe you mixed up the order... - I did not forget! - Maybe it switched by accident. - Grandpa, it's a three-pin dial. To rearrange it, the manufacturer's representative must come with a spare key.
Does he miss the hearings? What kind of sadist are you? Girls generally figure it out after six unanswered text messages. Did you play the wiretap recording to Wozniak? Did you give it to him?
' 'Percy. 'I found the ball, ma'am. - Good.'' 'Don't worry about the glass, I'll clean it up.
You should look at this diamond very intensely and think how much time passed before this wonder was formed from a lump of coal. It's probably more than a million years. That's just patience. You can't expect it to be at your beck and call, Aria. If it needs another week or two, give it to him.
Lily, thank you for bringing your mother. It was nice to meet you, young lady. Thank you, Jimmy. Tell your friends about me. Even if they have a will, they need to be updated, which you just did.
What do you have? When my sonic cry hit the avenger, he lost a small part of his goggles. It looks like it's covered with some wires. That's good, it means they were manufactured somewhere. I might be able to track down where he bought them from.
Who does something like this? Repeater. There is a small problem. There were no more bodies. Unless we missed them.
- During the day? - No, he stayed overnight. - Did he have a lot of equipment with him? Short boards and two howling suitcases. - Did he bring them back?
I never trust anyone. Call your boss. Ask for my file from the State Department, Grigory Krukov. If he says no, I'll believe you. If he delivers them, well....
I need to call 17 more local stores for sales records. - Anything new on Gunn's case? - Several prints were missed the first time. Entrance, door, contact and latch. It's as if the burglar held his finger up once he opened it.
No names for now. They claim that you were capricious, that they expected intimidation from you to extract confessions from them. Bullshit. This adds teeth to the cases. There's no way the judge will dismiss them now.
George? Are you feeling bad? This old woman... won't have a party. What are you talking about? Did she have them postponed?
- I don't know, I've never had to prove someone's affiliation with this place. The judge will be here soon, and we can build our case on that. The average score that the people here have is only 1.2 million. At the moment, based on everything you've done on Earth, you have -4,008 points. Not a very good score, but I will do the same good things for every person here until I have so many points that I can throw them in their faces.
The man grasps at such trifles. Send Mark on this one. Jewelers, pawn shops. If Nathan was stealing Laura's things from the farmhouse to sell them.... - Someone must have been buying them.
On the way, we picked up things at the end.... And I don't know, I think the tassel gave Dad a thought. Why didn't you leave them in the cart? So they wouldn't get stolen. And maybe I took them to impress Chyna with a "y".
- You will kill it. - We have to reset manually. - What are you doing? - The heart has stopped. Trying to set it off.
No pants. And no straightened hair. Really, Jesus... I'm talking about you, Stacey. A stick with boobs. Never mind that you stand in front of the mirror for hours and straighten them.
Kanan died. [Tense music] I wouldn't want to leave a fucking gun in the truth - you know that! I told you, Angie is betting on me! It doesn't matter who placed them.
Don't knock it, Tommy. You bet, no? That's the rule if you find a sack of money. Surely it was a sack of something. You're lucky it was me who found it.
It didn't help, fuck. That's for damn sure. Look, Axe, we're different, aren't we? We didn't inherit our highs. We earned them by pushing the bullshit from the beginning, often and very publicly.
I can help you return. When you return, destroy the device. This will break the time loop and solve your problem. There is no other way. But if I can find a way to understand them, maybe I can go back....
And then we'll have a bite of my almost favorite candy of my youth - mints. During the season Psotny Ferry brings here passengers from all over the world thirsty for sunshine.... fresh air.... and smoked mackerel. The ferry sails every 17 minutes to Lavender Lighthouse, from where tourists can walk to Skisla Grotto. They can also bask in the pale purple light of the lighthouse. As long as the weather is warm. In the off-season, Lake Lavender is not often visited, so the carrier has added three words in small print, meaning you can spot them when it's too late.
REPLACEMENT OFF Raven, explain. It's simple. The ring has no power supply. A short time ago, I thought it wasn't a problem because I could turn it on remotely.
Since when have you been able to knock down like this? - My strength continues to increase. - Recklessness apparently too. What did you expect? That I would stab you with this blade and ignite them with my joy?
These are West family companies, used by Garcia to launder money. Yes, but what's an account in the Cayman Islands with a deposit of 2 million and no withdrawals? It's the only one in Garcia's name. Maybe he was nibbling a little for himself. - Can they be seized? - Foreign ones are untouchable.
The last horse enters the gate. 2 million? A lot of change. How do we know they are legitimate? - I can wire them to you directly.
- Bonn. - Maastricht. It is not mine. It belongs to the Spaniards. Tell them to give it to me.
A banana and a vibrator are lying around in a drawer. Banana turns around and says: "Well what are you trembling so much, it will eat me." My old lady looks at herself in the mirror and says: "I wish my boobs were a little bigger." And I say: "Well, take a piece of toilet paper twice a day and rub them well."
I have a lot of questions. That's fine, but you won't fill it out like I did. Are you saying that the Valentine's Day gift was not from Gabi? It was my gift to Elliot, who keeps calling. But I don't answer, because that gift was straight from a heart that I no longer have, because my insensitive husband ripped it from my chest on the most romantic day of the year!
That's still more than we had an hour ago. Can you print pictures of the car? Sure. Show it to the security guard at the construction site. I'll talk to Linden, maybe he'll recognize them.
Yes, there is. Another 50 is in a building on Ventura. It's called The Lisbon. Box 5C. Get them from there by the evening and leave California.
Assist me, Home Security. Next. Sorry, not me. Too many documents are secret. We mark them as top secret because it's easier and hides our backsides, not because they will reveal anything.
It's a toy. These drones offer the highest level of security for important businessmen like you. In fact, they now protect the entire governor's mansion. They take 15 pictures per second. And we control them from a distance of 6.5 kilometers.
To us, God does not give orders, but as with Noah, this project is not just an exercise. In the next few months, we intellectuals, scientists and our writer, as decided by Darius Tanz, will select 160 people to colonize Mars. Counterintelligence has successfully traced the source of the intrusion. They call it a mimic signal. It's a satellite signal that overlaps proprietary data files, then replaces them.
When he asked you to create a story about a detective pointing a gun at you, and you did. I think I need to talk to a lawyer. That's one option. Or you could use the lifebelt thrown to you. Grab it.
Can you rebuild an EM drive from memory? My memory is not a problem. A unique crystal is required for the drive to work. We extracted this crystal from a meteorite that belongs to Darius. The only one of its kind on Earth. This is the most important and unique device in the history of mankind, and no one from Tanz Industries thought to properly verify the person who builds it?
I would like to send a telegram. - Please fill it out. - Thank you. I have letters for you. I need to look for them.
What do you know about my father? - Nothing? - Nothing. I know that's not what you wanted to hear.... But in the casino, in Macau, there are no traces of murder. If there were, we would have to find them.
This is the second night in a row. That's how many we know about. According to the regulations, we can no longer allow it. I would like to stay with him tonight. You have signed, you can take them.
- Two of my constables. - Do you always deal with evidence like this? Rest assured, they are nicely arranged there waiting for you. Here's the voucher. - Did they hand them over to Mathis?
Up. Straight up. - Alex. - What to destroy them!
Reacher. How is my office? I'm just sitting in it. There is a large depression in the desk top. Apparently you made it with someone's head.
Together we collected mines and sold them to partisans. Mines to be valuable. We poor. She very good. She would find mines with a stick, then slowly pull them out, and bury cans in their place.
I don't have a million, are you guys fucked? Fucking miser. You ran off with a million dollars. They weren't mine. I gave them to whoever planned the heist and got a cut.
I don't have time for that anymore. We expected it, didn't we? I guess we did. Then what should I do with this piano now? I bought it especially for you.
- Who. What me, the fortune teller Maciej? - Play with him. - Give me your phone, I'll take pictures. Give me yours. I'll write down my number and send them to me.
- And candles. - My goodness, Joanne! You didn't have to. You'll have less work to do. I put candy in the boxes each, but you can take them out if you want.
Even in marriage I need dignity. So should I rest until the morning? You must rest for a week or two. A back spasm is a warning. It is dangerous to ignore them.
So you can move the curtains. Is that you? Sorry. I wasn't snooping at all. I just found them in a drawer.
We will need a new cabinet to resurrect Japan and help the 3.6 million displaced people. This country has already rebuilt itself once. We will do it again. The countdown has barely stopped. They will resume it when Gojira moves.
There is no furniture and it is not painted. No matter what. I'll bring the key. Like I said, it's a little dirty. I'll take it, Inocencio.
Something dark and urgent. Okay. Super news. The smell of burnt shorts and smelly leg hair is finally gone. I just hope I can get them west before the marathon.
He calls it the Citadel. There is only one key, but he hides it. - Do you know what's inside? - He says mint candy. If I were him, I'd lock it too.
I think I'll give you the sandstone. We would like to pay for it. It was an old school. From the time when this city was founded. They cut it out of the great sandstone in the area.
And with that, I will make sure that whatever Nassau is by Christmas, it will not be English. - Don't. - It's too late. It will end in two ways. Rogers will realize that defeat is inevitable and leave the place, and then I will get it back.
- Yes? Find my money or you'll all go to jail for it. You have my number. How do we want to find something we don't have? We'll knock down the one who has it - Donnie.
I'm glad you enjoyed them. I didn't get my poetry much recognition. Your poems are full of pain.... Pain is always looking for pain. Can I use them for my music?
This time they sent me you. Unfortunately, in order to restore the usual state of affairs, the situation requires.... to make a blood sacrifice. You see, Arnold and I designed every bit of this park. It was our dream. And you thought I would let you take it away from me?
"Will you clean your glasses from the jam?" "He at least has a cobbler, and you're a rummy snowman." "Big girl." - "She lost 40 kilos." - "She'll find them on her ass."
- Louis? Are you listening to me? - You were talking about the things you bought. - Did you buy a car? - Antoine's old car? - Mom bought it.
Father always had a car. Back then, almost no one could afford a car. But he earned it. It was old, ugly and noisy, but his own. On Sunday mornings he scrubbed it with the tenacity of a maniac.
Let's see what you have here. If Jimmy hadn't treated me badly, we wouldn't be here. But I need access to Dreamtime. It doesn't belong to you. Bring it over!
I forgot that... I still have money. It's not badly chopped up. What will you do with the ring and the bill? You'll send it in the mail with a message to send it to Mandy.
The important thing is not to know the world, but to change it. Someone did their homework on the subject: Frantz Fanon. Do you know what else old Frantz said that fully gets to me? "Violence is the re-creation of man." If you don't like the world order, you have to change it.
Someone did their homework on the subject: Frantz Fanon. Do you know what else old Frantz said that fully gets to me? "Violence is the re-creation of man. If you don't like the world order, you have to change it. Change them yourself.
Hey, dad. Hi, sunshine. I think I've improved the recipe. That's great. What happened to the herb from the store? We sold them.
/They told us that Earth was uninhabited, but they were wrong, and we've been fighting for our lives since we landed. /Some of us were heartbroken, but most are still here, looking for other survivors of the Ark, Our leaders believe that in order to survive, we must keep peace with the Earthlings, but peace.... / is an unknown concept here. I found them, John.
- I love her. - You have proven it, Mr. Kirke. Let it go. There are the results of the DNA test of the cross raid. I ran them through the database.
They drive me crazy. Get rid of them. Don't let these feathered creatures ruffle your feathers, my friend. Chickens. You have a great coop yourself, and you keep them in this?
Your mother called. She was talking to Jeremy again. - Do you think I really came back because of you? - Yes. This program is my kingdom. I will get it back.
Two million livres. It took me six months to design this lock, and two blacksmiths took a month to build this door. They are a foot thick. My tools and plans. You have until noon to open them.
I intended to cure her. But I am not sick, Victor. I am remarkably healthy as you know, after all. I have developed a serum, a kind of medicine. I can collect all your anger and rage and take it away forever.
Everyone is here. Really? He's not wrong. The world is falling apart, and so is Star City. It's worse than before. That's because Darhk for the last year, tried to destroy it.
Was it turned on? - When we came in it was turned off. - Off. As you can see, the door was open, but the lock was intact. It seems that the old lady heard the bell and went to open the door. She saw that someone wanted to rob her and tried to lock it, but she couldn't manage.
I'm broke. When the stewardess let it slip how much money she was going to make from this delivery, I.... I thought they were drugs. I was going to sell them. Then he opened them.
You're welcome. This content chair makes up for what the form lacks. It will keep you from straining your groin. Can we not mention my groin for about 5 minutes? Please send it back.
Give me a sari! - Should I give her my sari? And who asked you for your sari? I mean the pink ones you bought for 8 thousand rupees. You ironed them this morning.
Arthur! Prison. - Will you tell us who? - It will take a while yet. I traced them to Granite Hills Penitentiary.
Is it not good? No. It won't be that simple. Someone came in and manually destroyed the file. First I have to recover the data and then decrypt it.
She kept your favorite ring. - It was her idea, not mine. - Bonnaire, do you have the money? - Yes. They are hidden. - Musketeers, take it and get them back.
Sorry. I thought we would meet on neutral ground to discuss our business. - What business? - Events on the social calendar. We need to divide them up and decide who will go to selected balls, gatherings, galas and so on.
Maybe you could... Part of me is glad that I will miss the recital. I've been waiting for this dance since sixth grade, it would be hopeless just to watch. I'm not saying I regret the baby. However, I would rather have it later or earlier, like the rest of my friends.
Better not to ask. So. I'm having kind of a crisis with colors. -Crisis? -Yes, take it easy, you'll get them back.
Hello, are you back from training? Yes, I'm working on the right punch. Good, it's a good play. Yes, I'm fine-tuning it.
And he's not wearing a scarf. I don't see anyone with a scarf. Wait a minute. There is. There's a scarf, too. So, the woman who changed Robyn's life is the one who took it back.
- Deep breath. Again. When they shot me, they cut the Lobos transmitter with rod cutters. They were prepared, and that means, - that we have a big leak. - Transmitters are the norm with important prisoners. - They probably took them just in case.
Is this my car? - Who are you? - Is this my car? - Ted Berner. - Was it stolen?
- Who are you? - Is this my car? - Ted Berner. - Was it stolen? No, it was borrowed by my son, Evan.
I think you destroyed him. And do you know what the worst thing is? There was no reason. The timing of the elections was coincidental. He could have announced them in 12 months, not in six.
Please leave the area or the police will escort you out! THREE MONTHS LATER / I understand you, but I will not allow Mr. Carter's further involvement. I understand that the sarcophagus is exposed to the air and its contents are deteriorating. This is an eternal discovery, and you are turning it inside out.
- Is it a ghost? - It could be a ghost, this one. - With a birthday cake? - With the birthday cake. - I'll eat it.
Treat yourself. This complex was built for rest and study. And I transformed it into a wonderful garden. It is my favorite place in the entire Kingdom. I rejoice in the fact that you were given the opportunity to see it before you decided to leave so hastily.
Nanny always says that the winds here bring bad dreams. - These are some brutal winds. - Here. - Have a drink of water. - Is it time for a beer? Mix it with tomato juice and it's breakfast.
- Yes. What did you see? A bird. A dead bird. Mercury Labs. They are attacking them.
- I'm Keith. I know your name. Listen... We can't remove something just to better sell it to you. Why don't we go all the way right away? Let's take the algorithm, put it in a metal box, hide it in a data center so it doesn't connect to anything, and no one will even know it's there.
- Light. - What do you have? I found a print on your gun. There's a chance it belongs to the shooter. I ran it through the base and nothing.
He could see what code the agent was typing in, and then go back there. Let's have some decent coffee. Was it from this apartment that the air conditioner fell out? It was pushed out. I watched them.
Great discovery after tunnel collapse. The belt? How could the belt get inside the tunnel? My guess is that someone wanted to cover their tracks after the murder. The prints match the guy. He must have left them on the belt when he defended himself.
A perfect face in perfect condition. The forensic doctor only told us that she lost a piece of her thumb in the accident and sustained head injuries, but they didn't give us details. I kept focusing on the thumb. I received emails with photos attached.... This was shortly after the accident. The sender was hidden, I didn't know who sent them, but I opened them.
He wanted us to find it. He was watching us all this time. Steak too fried? I haven't eaten meat for ten years. I gave it up after you took my parents away.
I have some bad news, Ryan. I wasn't even sure if I should tell you or not, but I think it doesn't really matter now. What? We have a problem with the baby. We lost it.
- I know, I lost it. And when it comes up.... You will feel sadness again. And fear. Fear that you will lose it too?
What about the phone from Nolan's apartment? Did you find the phone? We need to see it. Wait for your turn. The phone had a rather complicated encryption, but I managed to break it.
It doesn't make any sense. You have my word. I know you didn't deserve this birthmark, but someone else did. What if I told you that there is a way for me to transfer it to someone who deserves it a little more? Damon is the one who should have it.
- What does it mean? That you don't have to worry. It's bad, right? Yes. When something goes wrong in my work, I check the chain links, find the faulty ones and fix them.
That you don't have to worry. It's bad, right? Yes. When something goes wrong in my work, I check the chain links, find the faulty ones and fix them. If I can't, I remove them.
The chicken is a bit... - Rubbery? - Yes. It's tofu. It's made from soy milk and it's a great source of "rubbery" protein, or at least that's what they say.
Do you see this amplifier? When I was looking for Deiser there, these roots didn't come close. They don't like these amplifiers. And the whole base is surrounded by them! If we get them, we can use them to stop the pajols and clear the ship.
I want to distance myself from all this. In order to get to college, I had to harry for a year and a half. After all these hardships, I want to help others avoid death. I'm in my first year of medicine. To pay for my studies, I'm working three jobs.... - I will pay for them.
- I just came across this. - Johnny? Are you flying yet? You forgot to mention the data transfer that Khlyen sent just before the base was blown up. - They were encrypted. - Find out where they were sent and get me an assignment there.
I think the railroad is solving the cultural divide of our region. People can go to work. Families can get together. When you say ... "our region," sir, do you mean the counties of England? Because it may be that people, for example in Staffordshire, value the quaint assets of their own region and don't necessarily want them to be disfigured by the railroad.
I didn't make the connection until he mentioned the necklace. A few years ago, I played poker with some guys. Fraternity brothers? One of them talked about the necklace. He called it his trophy.
The de la Rosa breathing apparatus. I checked it from all sides. Nothing is blocking it, no mechanical problems.... This is exactly the one de la Rosa used? They call them built-in breathing systems.
- But it's a touchy subject. - She narrowed it down to everything. - What is it about? - It will be your birthday. Why don't you let us celebrate it this year?
Do not come to me again. Thank you, sir. By the way, did you get rid of that inhaler? Here is the victim's inhaler, which disappeared from the scene. Investigator Kang heard everything on the recording. He hid it from you for his own safety.
The last few weeks. At first small amounts. A few thousand here or there, but yesterday, after the death of the captain, the entire account was cleared. - One million dollars. - Do you think it was stolen by Tyson Reed?
At first small amounts. A few thousand here or there, but yesterday after the death of the captain, the entire account was cleared. - One million dollars. - Do you think it was stolen by Tyson Reed? - Kayla's pin was used to empty it.
Emma was worried that you might have been looking for him. I was looking for it. Well what? It's not your earring, Norma. It's Emma's mom's earring. - She had it on her ears in the hospital.
On mine I have my own face. Are you okay? You don't look too good today. Ready... Now! Well, now I'll be able to eat them.
Five years? The wine we drink... Nerello... comes from Etna. It's my favorite wine. It was matured at the foot of the volcano, but what makes it so special?
This is my lucky t-shirt. One does not ole' St. Patrick's Day. Forgive me, but I just don't embrace this holiday. It should last one day. Why is it celebrated for ten in this city?
Here you are. - This is not a normal operating procedure. - Do you remember anything from last time? The record shows that I was active before, but the folder does not contain data. - Someone must have deleted them.
Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid. - You changed the lock. - I don't know what about... Password to access the locker. Go back. You changed it.
- You changed the lock. - I don't know what... Password to access the locker. Go back. You changed them. Actually, we changed them several times.
- not in the apartment. - Good. And no handcuffs. Handcuffs are not a choice. But not on the back, let them be on the front so he can cover them with his jacket.
What kind of car did the shooter come here in? - The computer requires you to log in before we look for this one, but the attendant gave our killer a HOLD form for the Department of Motor Vehicles, so whatever car he drove away in has an expired registration. They won't tow your car for that. But that's not a good reason to drive around with a big bag of guns. Maybe that's why he left them.
- The building is clean, commander. - Roger. Severide, have you found the source of the leak? Not yet, Commander. I have them.
But not lunatics or murderers. I have known you Serbs since I was a child. At my dad's visitation in prison, you militiamen stripped me and my mother naked. They called you hens and bastards. Your giggles and taunts ring in my ears and I hear them every time I meet you.
Pin man. I started to remove the pins, but I had a critical case, I handed it to the nurse. Why didn't you consult the injury? The wounds are shallow. I close them with surgical glue.
Yes, it's strange, but Marissa Kagan was killed in Bristol, Connecticut, and Phoebe Elliot was killed in the Bronx. Do you really think that two different police departments in two different states, including the one we work in, would simply scatter DNA samples if they wanted to close a case? That's right, Phoebe was killed in the Bronx. Marcus said the shooter's car was abandoned in Bridgeport, and that's also strange, right? Someone steals a car in Connecticut to commit a murder in New York, only to drive it back to Connecticut.
It's like in school when they force you to hit yourself. If I could get into the relay in Long Beach, I could.... I could hack their server, and find a way to disrupt the hackers' signal. Then I'll tell the authorities in the other three cities how to do it, then we'll destroy the signal at the same time, regaining control of the ships. Toby, I left my car in Tahoe, and Paige's car is under her house, so we need to borrow yours. Ok, but I just washed it, so be careful.
They were the ones fighting the fire in the morning. This is camera footage from the extension of the bottling plant. There was no fire nearby, but... Do we know who it is? There's usually a name at the bottom of the suit, but it's obscured by a bag that the stolen disks can easily fit into.
We're out of here, and for me that's it, as far as this property is concerned. Do you understand? Yes, I'm just saying that it could be transformed into something new. Into your place. Get rid of the old ghosts and make it yours.
But you can't. It's hard to look back on the difficulties of life. I am a transsexual, I understand that. When I see pictures from before my transition, I see how unhappy I was. I wanted to erase the first 16 years of my life, but you can't get rid of the pain and sadness if you lock them away.
Forensics secured traces of blood that could have come from the perpetrator. But it turned out to be your blood. -Correct? -Yes. We secured DNA from the stamp and envelope sent by Adelita. We compared them with yours.
It didn't pan out. I'll let you know when I find Symon. A lot will change here. We will bring order to the city. We will clean it up.
Special Agent MacLaren of the FBI. Sorry to bother you. "MacLaren?" How can I help you? Well, sometimes our computer spits out results and we have to check them.
Man, how do you shut it down? Can you hear me? - Let go of the door. - What? They don't seem to know how to open it.
You just can't hear us. - What the fuck are you talking about? - Through military implants. The mass system? They put them in your head and during the fight you see us in a different form.
Better than being stuck in a phone booth with a panicking gorilla. - Not true. - That car wanted to kill me. - It wanted to hurt me. - That's why I like them.
Surely you have children. - Well, sure. - Why are you sleeping in the car? I'm tired all the time. I call them Mommy's Bar.
Lower your weapons. Logan? Hello, Jamie. - Translation: bluea, mulder, Caroo, kokotzz, Yuriko, mleczii, SheWolf, Karmy - Correction: bluea The best thing you can do for Mitch and Jamie is to work with us to prepare a cure. Even if Mitch's protocols work, we still don't know how to separate them.
How. Metallo is no longer just flesh and blood. Cadmus has implanted an endoskeleton in him. I should have traces of alloy after I hit him. I can examine them in the Fortress of Solitude.
Actually, I found this photo in the Hawthorn house. - When. - It's the same belt as the one the ZSD used to murder David Morales. They found it in a bag of clothes the family had given to the poor. Gunther took them there.
We announce the best initiative in years: we are launching the New York Youth Symphony Orchestra! For the time being, the current orchestra desperately needs your help. So please... All children who want to learn to play instruments can come to us or we will come to them! This wonderful, distant vision can become a reality with your support. If any child doesn't have an instrument, and most don't, we'll provide them with one for free!
I was fishing around when the man offered me drugs. I floated him, of course. The guy in the cell got the hera from your fishing basket. No, wait, did you find drugs in my basket? No, because you kicked them into the river.
What the hell is she doing? - Done. - What do you mean done? What did you do? I told Agent Albee that there is new data on the flash drive. She will deliver them along with the others.
I will try to. Mr. Mayor. Secretary Eun, please show. They are still wet in the crotch. Dry them better.
Hey, how about this? Dalton is not on the lists because of the bill, right? Recently the NFL changed the rule for scoring an extra point.... Yes, too many kickers were achieving them, so they moved the line back to 15 yards.
Patience is not a virtue of city contractors. Wasn't Mr. Binks the seventh contractor you vetted? Yes, and he made the short list, based on a stingy budget. But I don't think he fully appreciates the intricacies of my project, Julia. He certainly doesn't need to appreciate them, just build them.
It won't work. The box may be old, but it's still military hardware. Can you show me it up close? You're looking at a cylindrical lock. The best locks in the '60s, before they became padlocks for cyclists, and thieves learned how to open them with a pen.
These rats want nothing but bloodshed. They are vile, merciless monsters. I welcome you all. Here I have some welcome flowers for you. They gave me a whole set of plant food, but I left it in the car, so if they wither then you'll just have to throw them away.
You're crazy if you think I'll spend even a moment longer in this underwater coffin than I have to. I know that your heart is full of hatred, eager for revenge. This harpoon was enchanted to help me find souls like yours. And then what? Do you fill them with something else?
Just from the data that goes out. You have a virus on the server that effectively removes the software that counts and segregates each vote cast. Cholibka. Someone is sucking information out of that server. First of all, whoever ran that virus to get it can change it to whatever they want and load it back into the system.
When Snow White broke the mirror, it gave me food for thought. Maybe we can't hurt the Queen, but we can trap her. In the mirror? In the world behind the mirror. In any case, I can enchant it to be a trap.
9000! This is motorcycle territory. But still, the best part is the way it takes corners. Because it has 4 torsion wheels, and because the engine sits just above the rear axle, the grip is amazing. I've pushed all the hero's buttons, meaning I've turned off all the electronic assistance systems, and let's see if I can unstick it.
Our system. It has been hacked. It's impossible. We have more firewalls than the NSA in Utah. Every morning I check them.
I'm going to go victim personal effects all the way to Abby. Yes, I want to take them myself, but she still thinks I'm sick, despite the fact that I've had dry toast down for 24 hours. Can we miss something? victim necklace. I didn't notice it when I removed them, but.... there is no writing on the back.
It's a good thing. It turns out that America's favorite vice presidential candidate and a mercenary wanted by the CIA are friends. You probably don't see the case. If Catalan took part in the mission on November fourteenth, the CIA has documents on him. Did you get them?
Who: It was Nikki. Why would you think that? I knew as soon as I saw the photo. She took it in a vineyard, in Ojai about a year ago.
Little Weller is a star, but this cake is worth any money. Patterson. It's just a small party. I understand. Allie wanted to throw it.
He must wait for the owner to leave. This is his chance. A real treasure. The scarlet heart. He has acquired it.
And, as you're left, a term shouldn't be done. Then you would "terminate." Did you buy them? ! You look like you're paying child support in Florida. I had the perfect gift for Nick, and he bought them for himself.
I, for one, continue to think that you are coarse, standoffish and that you are completely unsuitable for a mature, long-term relationship. I'm glad we agree. What's going on, Frankie? We got the DNA results from the confession letter. They were traced to an ex-con named Harold Redding.
Like us, they needed company. I think they were bored. We watched Con Air - a flight of convicts. One of the prisoners.... hid a piece of wire in his hand, then pulled it out. He put it in a small hole.... in the handcuffs and opened them.
30 million. I told them to lick my balls. I don't take handouts. Did you leave them 30 million? I exchanged them for shares in a movie.
- Yeah, yeah. - Anyway, discharge at noon. What's that supposed to be? He sent you to check up on me? At the hotel, they didn't know what to do with the dang piano. So I thought you would want it.
At the hotel, they didn't know what to do with the shabby piano. So I thought you would want it. - I don't want his piano. - This one? It took six hours to get it out of the hotel, and I don't know anyone else in New Jersey.
We are almost there! Run! We are on the spot. It's Omotomachi! If you destroy sich body or head they will regenerate quickly. You can kill them by only destroying their necks.
Now, Tanya, Lika, some part of this story you do not know.... What did I say to you? I'm going to stick a gun in her fucking cunt! Put it back in! You'll keep it in your mouth, won't you?
Is that you, Mr. Wallington? Samantha, are you back? Sam? I said in the evening I would make breakfast. - Go back to bed. - But I feel like making them, Franklin.
Impossible. In that one in the corner. I didn't know it was a desk. It's not mine. It belonged to John. He left it in Baker Street when he left after his marriage.
Did you use Hickman? De Chepe. Second-rate researcher, but excellent at mazes. They were supposed to be impassable. How did you break them?
A nation, like a person, is something deeper, something more lasting, something greater than the sum of all its members. And it is this something that is most important for its future. - It is yours. - What? Keep it.
I'm sorry. Why don't I buy you a coffee and we can talk about it? His pain was so real. It's hard to believe he was faking it. Maybe he found some pleasure in it. He grew up without experiencing real emotions, so he started faking them and saw that he had talent.
Will you hook up to my Etsy account? Okay, what's your login? J, don't worry. The video is public, but I have a private account. No one knows who uploaded it or who is on it.
A few days ago. Unfortunately, I can't provide any other information. What is the meaning of this? Why did you do it? - It was empty, so I closed it.
Are you making friends? Do you think I don't know that this house hates me? That it doesn't try it every time? /Trying to warn people? /I made a wish, so he has to make it come true....
Me: Michael discovered Mother by accident, when the orchard was overrun by a terrible gangrene. Only one tree survived. It absorbed the fungus instead of letting it destroy it. Later Michael discovered an interesting effect of the fruit. Dead men who ate them could not have children.
No one asked you for your opinion. Budhan! Where do you have my luggage? -In this room downstairs. Then carry it to the floor.
Then you'll get 10 years in prison. Do you know Moon from Mirae Motors? Was he their customer manager? Two years ago, he wanted to give me documents about the bribe fund. But Jang and Oh sent a hunting dog to intercept them before they reached me.
Remember Il-seok Moon? Former customer manager at Mirae Motors. Two years ago he wanted to give me documents about the bribe fund. Documents from Mirae Motors. But they were seized by some snitch.
GIVE back to CEZAR what belongs to CEZAR Goodbye. What's this? Mr. Chairman, from now on I will clean up your shit! - You clean it up and eat it!
By. What is this? Mr. Chairman, from now on I will clean up your shit! - You will clean them up and eat them! - You will eat them!
I won't die of anything. I've got Klaus' blood at my place across the river, along with the blood you're all going to eat. We just have to get there. You once asked what I was fighting for. I answered that for this city, for our home, but if we feed here, we will lose it.
Why are you looking at me? How do I know? I can't see them. She lost her keys. - She has them in her purse.
Marudheera! The palace washerwoman wants to meet you secretly. I saw this leaf in your bedspread. I've been eating these leaves forever. Do you know what they are used for?
Great, the charm has been removed. - Don't you have to smash it? - I'll break it in the morning for scrambled eggs. Will you feed someone my problems? What if I eat them again?
I look forward to every moment we're allowed to spend together, and when you're out, I look forward to every day." Vince... I am happy and honored to become Lorna Muccio. As for me, you are very ... macho. I can't write as nicely as you, so I will read a poem. In life I have known only sorrow and pain I have no strength to bear them again.
Daddy. Should I drive you home? No. What is the result? We should have them at the hotel.
It can be done. What kind of wine is it? It is not on the menu. I have it in the apartment. If you like it, I'll be happy to taste it.
Sack of gold. I do not think you understood what hate your family in this part of the world. A beautiful bag full. And I think I did what I swore possible to get it. But he will not live for long if you do not respect them.
Excuse me. An allowance? The family gives you an allowance? No, no, it's my money. I get it from Sandpiper Crossing.
I could hear her in the stands cheering on her chosen one. Except it wasn't me. I had never felt such pain. I didn't know what to do. So I gave it to Oscar.
When I think about it... Lord Pallas was behaving strangely. One day, he was talking to me about his olive tree. What did he say? That it was diseased and he had to cut it down.
I wanted to restore control of the military.... Do you think I am ignorant? The policy of "Glorious Harmony".... You ruined my life's work in one day. On the throne, you don't make decisions, you weigh them and look for the guilty.
Good shot! This place is like out of a dream, Sal. When the rays of light reflect on it, it sparkles with colors, like a rainbow. It is... We have to get it before someone overtakes us.
Everyone will benefit nicely from the new structures. How nicely? - Tell Fisk... - We don't say his name. Tell Fisk that if he wants a kilo of meat, he has to come here and cut it himself.
I'm a police officer. Good. Good. Good. I'll get them back.
Cancel the company's listing. Or what? If you do that, I'll dig the dead bodies out of your closet and bury Empire along with everyone who's a part of it. And I think I'll change the name of the place. I'll call it U Cookie.
This morning I wrote a check for this amount plus your start-up bonus. - Do you want to help the Nation? - No. Never. But it's your money. Do what you want with them. But if I were in your position, I would rebuild a community center and set up a studio in it, naming it after myself to protect my output.
Since when do you think I'm a retard? It would be better if you sent me cash every month. That way I know what I can count on. Now count on it. It's a good amount of money, take it.
Is it for me? Yes. - That probably means I'm going back to rehab. - As soon as I start this car. - Where did you get them from?
Look! They removed them. Give the key. Give it! They replaced them.
Give the key. Give it! They switched them. What are you talking about? You knew I was here, you changed them!
Listen, I... I'm sorry to even ask, but those passports and phone that Michael said he saw at your place in the safe, did he make it all up? No, not a bit. I keep cash there, and I needed an international phone when I traveled to find Luisa. And I heard Michael snooping around, so I removed them.
We weaned Maddie from pacifiers, so we planted them in the ground and grew lollipops. I don't think you know anything about gardening. You don't seem to know anything about children. Why doesn't your bike have a saddle? I traded it for a book about penguins.
- You look shitty. - Look at the mirror yourself first. Did the remains from the Night Room belong to a man? Yes. Jennifer said it was the source of the virus. - We destroyed them.
Well, you know, the gift is a frame. I thought the weird pictures they put in it, which is spooky. Well, because who are these smiling people we don't know? So, I don't know myself. I...just replaced them, but....
Barry's mother's body was found here, the knife next to it, the blood splattered on the wall belonged to Nora. Joe, I think... I think too much time has passed and everything has changed. Except for this mirror. Sherry must have bought it at a garage sale.
Sleep. Relay that the trial is still going on. And you must know something else. Claire Ripley showed me a photo of her wearing Pippa's pendant. Can you get it?
Oh my God! - Oh my God. Somehow it looks good on you. - Is he going to be okay? - Well, he has a slight concussion, a dislocated shoulder, and we had to sedate him to set it.
Take good care of him, boy. I will. Do you need a ride? Good. I found them.
I punched in the coordinates and will see the satellite view. What is the tattoo about? It's the hexagram "I Ching." It means: "The power is in the little things." My father used to draw them for me and remind me to be brave.
Then why do it? We'll find out by going back to the first beast. We'll use the scent of one of the victims - and see where the virus came from. - Is DNA enough, - to identify the victim? - We will obtain it from my blood.
Of course. He said he wanted to drive around a bit. - Did that seem strange to you? - No. I'm a morning bird, but Jason had such indefatigable energy. He was incredibly happy with his lifestyle. The harder he worked for it, the more he appreciated it.
Yes, on a massive scale. It has the same magnesium jaw. This explains the presence of formic acid in the rock substrate. It spits out the acid to soften the rocks and then chews them up.
Jess asked to collect Tom's things. She can't do it alone. Do you still have the keys to her house? We should return them. I don't know where Nat keeps them, I'll look for them.
The wall may be gone, but I sense the remnants of Ingrid's magic here. Leaving this city was never easy. Ingrid didn't change anything. She wanted to stay here alone. She wanted to turn Storybrooke into her ice castle, and apparently she wanted to protect it too.
The American Dream. Everyone is chasing to make dreams come true. Some realize them.
- Major Hewlett. What is it about? Free me. Or maybe free your tongue. One more lie, and I'll x-ray the case. Whatever nets you weave, I will cut them.
We can only survive! I know a man powerful enough to tip the scales in our favor. Vlad. Ottomans stole his armor. You will know the secret of the armor, and the Crusade will know the man who made it.
/We're missing something. Max, do you have a moment? There are discrepancies in the employee access logs. The server automatically saves backups to another drive. Last week's files are corrupted. - Have you recovered them? - Yes.
Dan Tana at 8 p.m. I'll be there. We assume it was a student. - We are reviewing the surveillance videos. - I want to see them.
Quite a specific taste. I wanted to celebrate my happiness with my good friend. I got a call from Northrop. A spot had come up for hull assembly. The same thing I'm doing now, only in this time zone. And did you get it?
Maybe some of you heard me offer my own hard-earned money on the air for the capture of a dangerous fugitive. Or maybe I offered you a generous offer for your property. An offer that makes literally everything possible. Things you never even dared to dream of. But I didn't come here just to make a bunch of money for us, although I intend to do that. And I didn't come here to change the fate of this city. To save it from the ghosts that hide in these streets and valleys.
Wait, there are three million infected in New York? That's how many there will be when we finish testing, refinement and mass production. Leigh, this could be an achievement on par with the polio vaccine. This compound works incredibly fast on these creatures. We can study them more once we get the epidemic under control.
And a bond is already being born. Say I had a crush on him. And did you have a crush? I have your number. I'll send it to you.
You were digging sewers in San Jose for a penny a day, and now you have $125 a month as the head of construction in the biggest venture in American history. I'm just saying that $15 a day means more to these people than it does to this venture. During the gold rush in Sacramento in '49, every ignorant person with a dollar and a dream wanted to make a fortune in gold. The problem with gold is that it's buried in the ground. You want to get it, you have to dig for it.
It would need a detonator to allow the wireless signal to expand through the ground. - What does the detonator look like? - A plastic box. A small one. He could put it anywhere, but he would want it on the line of sight so the signal could easily expand.
- Call a plumber. - Come on, can't you fix it? - Ma, the pipes behind these walls are like a painting by M.C. Escher. Not even Dad could unravel this mess. Well, who do you think first messed them up like this?
Children... He promised them - what did he promise them? - This trip. They had been talking about going to Hawaii ever since they saw it on one of the TV shows.
Is it not so bad? There are no wheels on my cart. There is no damage except for missing parts that can be replaced. They are not replaceable. Everything in this cart except the windshields was original, straight from the factory, just as my father brought it home.
But I love him - without judgment. My wife and I adopted a 4-year-old girl, Micah. I deal with alarms, if you were interested. Give me a contact for you and you'll get emails with offers every week. Everyone here gets them.
I have to... Dr. Oppenheimer. Do you drive, Charlie? I'm a Jew from St. Louis. When a horse won't accept a saddle, you can send it to the glue factory.
- He never denies himself a piece. Oh God, what is that smell? It's definitely not pizza. Clams, a pizza from New Haven. - The last time I ate them was at Yale.
How do we beat him? Since I saw the beamed business card I keep thinking about, - thank you, Cisco. - You're welcome, Caitlin. If he likes radiation so much, let's give it to him.
Someone left this letter on my desk. It is addressed to the Queen of Navarre, wife of Antoni. It's an invitation to a tasting. Written by you. Um... must have been dropped off by a servant after the queen presented it.
It uploaded a virus into this particular file. Basically, it allowed it to live in my computer. This is our recording with Hanna in the park. The last time we were all together. Can I see them?
- Not bad, right? - Beautiful. - Where is it? - Near Waimanalo. It belongs to a friend. We have it for the weekend, so....
It's been a kick of a year. Give me one good reason not to rip your balls off. NEXT TIME - She won't do it, I can see it in her eyes. - Sex is a natural desire. - I keep it under control.
I tried to find the right moment for it, your mother gave me this ring along with her blessing. I recognized... You were the one who created this medicine? Yes. Can I get it?
Can I get them? - Weren't you in the park earlier? - No. - I missed the event. - So many people got them that you probably received them going into this hotel. Nevertheless, I would like to get them from you. For posterity.
In your suffering.... I see love. In mine... hatred. Your pain... Emanates an attracting light. My pain... Only repels them.
Why didn't you look for the flower here yourself? I'm not welcome here so I was supposed to barge in here for you? You didn't barge in anywhere I wouldn't have endangered you I really didn't know someone was going to shoot here and now can you show me where you saw this flower? Maybe I can point it out to you through the window?
The car was sunk empty. Make sure the media doesn't find out about it. Let's conclude. The last call from Sam's cell phone was made on Oct. 2 at 7:12 p.m. The signal indicates that it was made in Pondol.
Let's go! Miko, there's no way out of here! You are surrounded! Here is the light switch. Turn it on.
And they were determined to get money for it, so they followed me home. - With a baseball bat. - With a baseball bat. When I got to the door, my mother opened it, and these two people, um, demanding money, were standing behind me. She had sense enough to look in her wallet and pretend she only had $20, so she gave it to them and.... - And they were satisfied?
It should last a while. Thanks. I have to admit that you came up with that pipe pretty well. We need to get moving. The fire crooked the door, but I think I can fix it.
What kind of Librarian are you? ! One who knows that sometimes you have to give up your powers. This ending will not fill the pages of my book, it will mark a chapter on the stage. I will find another object that will hold my wrath! - Did you burn them?
This ending will not fill the pages of my book, it will mark a chapter on the stage. I will find another object to hold my wrath! - Did you burn it? - Yes. To protect them from Prospero?
According to his emails to the lawyer, someone simply came and offered it to his collection. For safekeeping. Yes, I hacked his mail. - And you're buying it? - Man, it's the Key to Lost Knowledge. If Prospero stole it, he went to a lot of trouble to get rid of it.
There was little to no misfortune. Their photos were colored for the mosaic. Either that, or they colored me in. Come to think of it, the guy made a 21st century portrait of himself. Instead of one portrait absorbing his sins, they are now being absorbed by hundreds of club regulars.
We should probably have a long conversation about child-rearing decisions. It was lost. I'm flying to work. Steve, how did you learn to cook like this? I got the recipe from YouTube, but I made them my own way.
And Swedish radio... What a spice. Did you follow Anna Ekdahl for a long time to take these photos? I got a tip that she was in Copenhagen. I regret that I took them.
Someone you know? It varies. So anyone can show up with an object and expect payment? - In principle, yes. - You ask, where do they get them?
- We have already detained him. You will be in charge of amethyst mining. Why do we need them? They power the dome, like batteries. Thanks to the egg, they were charged, but when they were destroyed, they began to lose energy.
Because I need it. Here. Now I'm your lawyer Kalinda and this dollar symbolizes the contract between lawyer and client. Sure. You falsified the meta-data and Diane presented it in court to free Cary, right?
Both of them lost. Did you see his picture? They sent it to me. I deleted them from my phone. But maybe I saved them somewhere.
It's not a good idea to test Mr. Bishop's authority. Why? Because m people like me who work for him. You know, I recorded data from Mr. Bishop's computer on an external drive and there were bills and records of your employment. But I had no reason to give them to the prosecutor's office.
- We got it. - Send the troops to the sideboard. Fire at level 4! Fire in the warehouse! - Flood them.
/Please leave a message. - Did you find something? - Yes. Most microchips are the size of a grain of rice and each one contains a serial number, but ours seem larger. It looks like A has modified them to track our every move.
They are the most powerful people on earth. They are involved in a global conspiracy. A secret organization spread all over the world, for the past 30 years consisting of leaders of countries and leaders of the private sector, called by some a "clique." The world you live in is the one they want you to live in. They start wars and create chaos. And when it suits them, they end it.
Eddie Reynolds is appealing his sentence for ordering Susan's murder. - On what grounds? - The police withheld evidence. CCTV footage. - Did you conceal it?
If my Trouble can fix it, then you know I have to try, Gloria. Doesn't mean I have to like it. It's very good, Vickie. When I'm done assembling here, the crack in the nucleus should close. Then we'll give it to Vince and finally build a new Barn.
Wheatley, you will prepare to enter the building from the river. Have the ladders on standby at my signal. They'll burn alive in there. There's no way they have any air left, and this hose is too short to get them out. I'll cut off the water supply and we'll divert them to the ladders.
Do not do anything rash that you would regret for eternity, Mary. For he is already lost. I feel the presence of my beloved in him. Nothing is lost if he is still alive. Fire runs through my veins like blood and I will burn them before you can blink.
Some woman wants to see you. You intimidate me and pin the murders on me. Sorry. You are so tough with that gun and badge. Dude, put them down and see what happens.
He didn't want me to take the bus. He drove it the day after, - when that cop was shot. - So he was the one who stole the car? Riley wanted the car as soon as he saw it.
59! I am 59 years old! Wrong PIN. Have you spent a lot already? I'm storing them for someone.
Time is running out. - I need someone to stand guard. - I will take care of it. Let's try to look for the key. If you find it, let me know.
Ready? Tornado! Leroy! Everything is in order. We called them in.
What are you waiting for? Kill her. Stop it perfectly. Now... crush them.
- These records have been lost. Anything better than turning into a zombie rather fits. Don't be so sure. I know the antidote is there. I need someone to bring it.
It is indeed a great day! Eat and rejoice! Later we'll meet on the square and talk. - Did you check? - The wind blew them away, that's how they found us.
Why should I be? It is a beautiful night. The weather is good, and I'm enjoying my cigarette. An error forces the software to adapt, to change into something else. It circumvents them, or goes through them.
- This was our dream, Anna. We have nothing left. There is still my trust fund. - It's your money. - Our... We could invest it in the vineyard, maybe.... try again and hire some help.
Looking for an answer? You'll find it in the registration register. Sorry for the mess. It's mom's stuff. I should have thrown them out a long time ago.
The voice in my head was right. - I don't want to give up the darkness just yet. - What I need to use it one last time. I brought a dagger and a flame. You will get them when you free my family.
- What do I have to use it one last time. I brought a dagger and a flame. You will get them when you free my family. No. You will give them back now, or I will let Merlin go.
Roaming eats up so much money, I think I'll go bankrupt. We discussed how to deprive Savege of its power. - And his magic stick. - The Scepter of Horus. It is protected by some kind of force field.
The Chinese government already controls Internet access quite efficiently. What did they need it for, Gail Sarkisian's research? I know from experience that those who have great power are the same people who want even more of it. Some people doubt whether the Communist Party has taken the most effective direction with its propaganda, and then Weller and Sarkisian appear with a solution. So, the question is: Would China kill to get it?
/Storybrooke, currently - I pressed him as hard as I could. He is at the end of his endurance. - Did you say something? - Go ahead, squash them.
It was Indur who went out, Zero's father, And what is left of Zero's rifle? What will you do? Drawing his old man should have it, I will bring them to him,
Ishaq, 4 kilometers from you to the northeast there is a closed gas station. Go there and wait.... What the hell? The satellite has lost connection. Can we get it back?
So why does time continue to erase itself? Wait! Wait! We can't... we can't fly away Rigby, what's going on? There is another vehicle, and the younger we just go to the high school to fix them just go to the high school to fix them
Silver nitrate. It will warm the wound, making the blood clot. God! It looks like a trace of what was used to cut off the finger. I will examine it in the spectrometer.
I think I know why. The shots are quiet, hard to track, perfect for long distances. We have a forest, the middle of the night. Here it could be about smuggling money. Maybe the killer left it here seeing that it was fake.
Our hacker. He infected the camera loader with malware, and then smuggled it into the station. When he found out what type of body-cam they used, he copied the package, disguised himself as a courier, and dropped off the infected equipment. He was in and out in less than a minute. Then, once they were plugged in, the virus started moving around the network until it found the Commissar's computer and took it over.
Why. When did you learn what goes where in a Lamborghini chassis? I flunked a household class. Would you answer my question? Maybe he knew the person who took it.
The patient's name is Mary Pattinson. - It's P-A-T-T-I-N ... - I can spell her name. Nevertheless, you can't find her file. I'll bring them in a moment.
"Contained" is the key word. You can't prove anything. - The point is that we don't have to. - This graphic also contained notes from official White House meetings. By destroying them, you violated the 1978 Presidential Records Archive Act.
What about the ink inside the diaper? Will it come off? I tested it myself. Let's leave it at that. Things in that I wore them.
- And does she eat them? Does she pick her nose and then.... No, no. Thank God. She wipes them in the sheet.
Listen, Avery, I don't know what to tell you. There's nothing on the laptop about it. The last thing Darko said was "Python's name is in that laptop." I already had one friend who died. Find them and find them now.
We know that the killer broke into Vivian's house. We took prints, the results will be out in a while. Really? Do you have the prints? We also know that the killer is looking for an American and he, or she, has the key to the password Vivian used and is trying to crack it.
But he was still nowhere near Syd's room. What? The snot gushed my watch. Once this flower had color and could bloom. And then death, blind to the beauty of the living, even as intense as this, swept it away, bending it closer to the ground.
He gave me the address, I went out into the street, and there two jumped out at me. One punched me in the head, and the other gushed the case. Why do you carry such a valuable violin with you? A policy requirement. I'm supposed to have them with me at all times.
The implication is that it may have happened before Teresa Halbach was reported missing. The jury heard testimony from a relative of Mr. Avery, his nephew and a neighbor, which amounts to an admission of the crime. There is no way to remove this from the minds of the jury members. It has an enormously prejudicial impact. If there were a remedy for nullifying this trial, and I don't know if there is, it would look like this: the court instructs the jury to take Bobby Dassey's testimony as false and ignore it, because all of his testimony was false in this case.
This is not so... Shut the fuck up! - It's not like that... - Shut up! That's not all! I also think you stole a huge bag of fucking guns and brought them to my house!
- This mural should... - Please... Let's not argue after a meal. It's bad for digestion. And since this "masterpiece," as you call it, will soon turn to dust, here's our last chance to drink as our decadent ancestors did.
As long as you are there, the past and the future will continue to coexist. But when you wake up, what you do will become history. The only history that will be known to us. It's as if the last half-century never existed. This world, this war... The only person who will remember them will be you.
! From where? We don't have that much! - We won't give a shithead that much money! - That would be crazy. We'll let the pervert put it online for everyone to see? !
When I tell people that I don't want to play basketball in my fourth year, no one listens to me. It's like I'm speaking Chinese on another planet! And the coach winds up saying that I won't count in the market if I let go of the seniors. But he doesn't know about the fucking knee. Have you examined them outside the university?
Well, and I'm hungry. We will die of hunger. Not if you like mustard. Why don't you have food? I had, but we ate it all while being high.
- Everything will be fine. - Everything is going to be fine. - Fuck. Come on. - These cameras, this video.... are proof. - I hope someone finds them and uses them to show them to others
Give this. Mr. George Briggs, Mrs. Carter's caretaker, Methodist Church, Hebron, Iowa. Well, inside you will find $300. Then why not give it to me now?
Mr. George Briggs, Mrs. Carter's caretaker, Methodist Church, Hebron, Iowa. Well, inside you will find $300. Then why don't you give them to me now? I'm going to send them by mail.
Inside you'll find $300. Then why don't you give them to me now? I'm going to send them by mail. Why yes? You will pick them up on the spot.
It's not a shopping mall, but the Grand Ray Center. It will bring this sleepy little town into the XXl century. Do you want to demolish my candy store? No. I offer you a fair price for its demolition. What about the tree house, Dad? Don't worry about that, Waldo. We'll dig up the tree with the tree house and replant it in our backyard.
You said my apartment is great. - You are serious. - Yes. What would I do with my nice things? You could sell them, or store them in a warehouse or.... I don't know, I...
No earrings, right? . No. I know it sounds strange, But I have to ask. Is there any conductive metal in your body, Because the magnetic field will forcibly pull them out of your body.
I believe we have a choice in how to tell sad stories. On the one hand, we can pare them down, as they do in movies and romances:
Any answer? No. Which made me even angrier. That he was ignoring me. So I went around the house and knocked on the back door. When I hit it, it opened.
Find someone with documents, I'll wire an extra $50 for the fatique! Thank you! Wait. A colleague will send me the money. I need the help of someone with ID who can collect it for me.
And now an official welcome to the German aristocrat. No, Eggsy. But the ride. In the past, they also had a phone in the heel. How to hide them?
No, they all looked the same. And the other ingredients? I chopped some stalks. Wild celery. I picked them myself that morning by the river.
- I don't have time for that. Plain and simple. If you do not leave the apartment by noon, our lawyers will report it to the police.... I want to say something plain and simple. This is my apartment! It was bought by my father!
This is my apartment! It was bought by my father! He paid for it for 43 years! Gazillions of dollars! And then he left it to me.
Brother! Brother! Gerrant! No. The jewel can take life and give it.
I'm looking for Eduardo Vega. You found him, boy. What do you want? I came across an article from the Wall Street Journal.... About Nikolas Treviño. About how he made 100 million on your research by stealing your drug patent and distributing it in Latin America without paying you a dime.
- Gabriel? And what is the point? Why are you on this plane? Did you buy the tickets yourselves? I work in a real estate office. They sent them to me to look at plots of land.
Because I am so responsible. Later. Seeing. Look for the oxygen! You will find them!
I sense that one of the vans is responsible for recent bank robberies and linked to two murders. Tell me when you find evidence. - McNab! - Yes, boss? Scan the notes from the back of this doll and email them to me.
A bunch of useless idiots! You'll all be out of a job, I tell you. Where's the key, Mrs. Gralton? I don't know. I don't know where I gave it.
Holy shit! Break them down! Damn the door! - Mercy, Mrs. Gralton. - Well, I don't know where I gave them.
You are a guardian. The fairies need you there. Go on! There's no more time for that. How do we catch them now?
But in the Carboniferous era, the atmosphere had twice as much oxygen as today. Insects could be bigger and still get enough oxygen. That's why dragonflies are the size of eagles and centipedes are like alligators. Why was there so much oxygen? It was created by a new kind of life.
- You are repeating yourself. I only suggested that you might be a little afraid. I heard. You don't know what you're talking about. I know that Cain gave you the birthmark for a reason. And instead of rejoicing and treating it like a gift, you're pouting like you lost a stuffed bunny.
Wait a minute. When man is in a hurry, the devil is pleased. Come down to us. There is a piece of coastline in the north. They wanted to buy it for dog money and build their own smuggling port.
Come down to us. There is a piece of coastline in the north. They wanted to buy it for dog money and build their own smuggling port. But I thought: why should I let that happen? I bought them, and the Russkies got screwed.
He is the biggest asshole of us all. Both... Throw them to me. Give me the keys. Please throw them to me.
The dots themselves, irrelevant. Don't get into metaphysics. The jurors hate it. The Greeks were also terrified of beauty. They saw it as anguish, monstrosity, something unattainable.
- Mom changed the locks. - But I guess you can let me in? Mom forbade me. She says we need a break from you. Beth Ann, honey, open the door for me. Open it.
No one can help you, mother. You have to do it yourself. And the only solution Is to go through it. Feel the fear and pain. Let them into you and then let them take over.
He sent threats. As a prophylactic measure, we ordered the NSA to monitor communications with the committee. We did not anticipate a kidnapping. This is a bold play, even for Hector. You adopted a lioness, fed it raw meat, and now you're shocked that it craved fresh blood?
My wife did something terrible today so that we could get to Widener's phone. She did it to protect our daughter. Tell me that we managed to monitor Widener's secure lines. We did. She'll realize it happened and disable them.
You think I don't have anything to sweeten the deal? There is an antidote. You just have to come to me. I'll send you the address by text message. - Why don't you bring them to me?
- Mariana, I miss your old color. - And I don't. - Seriously? - Seriously, I like them blonde. How about going to the salon to change them back to brown....
But I made some mistakes. What mistakes? I took my employer's money. I invested it with a Wall Street man who said I definitely wouldn't lose it. But I lost them.
$1,000 per head. 3,000. $2,000 - It stands. But you'll have to go across the border and collect it yourself.
Show me a spectrum of anything, whether on Earth or from a distant star, and I'll tell you what it's made of. The Fraunhofer lines are the atomic signature of elements in the cosmos. As with every great discovery in the history of science, this opened the way to new and deeper mysteries. And it revealed that there are more mysteries hidden in the light. When Joseph Fraunhofer combined a prism with a telescope and looked at the stars, he brought them much closer to us.
So you finally have a house at your disposal, eh? No more danger, no more need for support. What will happen to the gold? It will stay in storage until Monroe is convicted. Then we'll auction them off.
The job of cow's milk is to turn a 30-pound calf into a 700-pound cow as quickly as possible. Cow's milk is a super growth drink for calves. That's what it is. Everything in this white liquid, hormones, lipids, proteins, sodium, growth factors, IGFs, each has a role and purpose in turning a calf into a great cow or it wouldn't be there. And whether you add it to cereal in liquid form, whip it into yogurt, ferment it into cheese or freeze it into ice cream it continues to be a calf drink.
We are not preparing a tax return. We are preparing to take vows of eternal and lasting love. Even so, the money from your parents will not cover all the costs. What about the box with my dowry? Have you opened it?
- With an iron? - Yes, it's the best pawn on the board. Iron? Oh god, I don't think I know you at all. Nobody expects the iron, they ignore it.
You are a perfectionist, just like me. Take your time. But not too much. - Today is the deadline. - I'll finish them by lunch.
Are we going back already? You would like to, wouldn't you? You know what, we will continue. We'll eventually find some treasure and hand them over to the villagers.
They will not be defeated in an arms race. Only you know how to take care of Florence's enemies. I am looking for an ancient volume called the Book of Leaves. It's a compendium of secret knowledge that people have died defending. Sixtus and his gang have moved mountains to find it.
Shall I ask you why? The sun has risen, I have pipes and a murder case to solve. What about the piano? Do we have any prints or know who might have cut the wires? No, they were cut a long time ago.
I can't believe I just said that. Lunch in 30 minutes. It also has a massage setting. And it's made of foam that conforms to the body. Well, then why do you sell them?
It takes up a whole room. Well, I don't think my bedroom is bigger than that. Maybe it's too big for me, too. It's not too big, it just gets in the way.... intimacy, because of the gap between the beds. That's why we're selling it.
- Thank you. - How do you make it? We use only untreated naturally milled flour in the mill, natural sourdough on yeast and do not bake in a hurry. That gives them crispness, doesn't it? Let's subject them to two long, slow bakes.
What is your plan? Come on, time is money, money is power, power is pizza, pizza is knowledge. - Let's get started. - Okay. So, I have an idea for an abacus on my phone. I call it a "tele abacus"
No, no, I really want to give back everything I owe you. I don't feel comfortable taking this money from you. But it's yours. Accept this check, mom. Don't be ridiculous, keep it.
Did I know? Did he show it to you? He said he couldn't tell me because it's written in the code of magicians. There is a certain level of trust between dance partners. We have to have it.
We will start as soon as you are ready. I have Stanley's will with me, with which I would like to acquaint you. Due to the flowery phrases, however, I will skip some points. Don't worry. We have certainly heard them before.
It was different on his father's side. Dad was a crazy kid when he was growing up in the 1960s, drifting through life. Then, I heard, he was walking on the beach once and found a piece of wood washed up on the shore. And he saw something in it. So he took it home and stared at it until he carved a figure of Jesus out of it.
- That's what he didn't see. - The assassin must have followed him. Or they met here. Why didn't the killer leave the body here? Why did he move it all the way to Manhattan, to the victim's apartment?
- The lawyer testifies. - ... access to luggage ... During the entire flight ... Sustained. Is it true that you planted drugs in my client's luggage - and wanted to pick them up.... - Objection!
Right? In the meantime, let's take care of the funeral home documents. It shouldn't hurt, right? In small steps. When I see her, I'll tell her to sign them, and we'll see what happens.
/Help me get this harness off. What you saw was a pre-recorded prank concocted by Madison. When you watched it, she was already dead. The killer used it as an alibi so he could say he was at the other end of town when the murder happened. He was also watching it with a friend.
There was a rumor that Luther begat several drafts of the document. Imagine how much a copy would be worth. So you forge 95 Theses? And then what? I'll pretend to be someone who inherited them and has no idea how much they're worth.
Forever, right? Yes. What is the code? - The numbers, Charles. - I wrote them down. Ink... I can't read it.
Well. Tell them yourself. Right now we need to get to the surface. And now we are going. - We found them.
Take. - You said it was a toy. - Wish you could see your face. - How many did we get? - Keep them.
Check to see if there has been recent contact between Ian Little and Sue Walsh. I'm scanning the call list now. Not too many repeating numbers. Ok. There are dozens of calls to and from this number, I'll compare them with the numbers from Sue Walsh's home.
How many times do I have to tell you that! It's a shark! If one were to compare a whale to a snake.... A shark would be a worm! Why are you so small! It's fear that makes them bigger in our eyes.
Damn the chicken! Damn the chicken! It's on the bed. Run away! Get out of here! Sherlock said he would send them to the zoo.
He doesn't understand English. Vous etes une petite fille tres courageuse. I feel another shrapnel, Sergeant. That's what a shrapnel is. I know some who took them out 10 years after southern Africa.
Then try harder. There's your office, too! On a good note. Very friendly. Dennis liked them too.... Until he got over it.
- What number? - 147. - 147? - At the Best Traveler hotel. /I knocked on the door. /He opened it almost immediately.
Yes, but I hate European stations where there are these automatic ones for credit cards. They don't work. They never work. The next ones that don't work, especially in France, are the ones where you put euro banknotes in narrow slots. They don't. You put them in, and it flies. "Nnnngh!
Typical of Sebastian. Certainly the files were removed from here. They were practically destroyed. It's like a bomb went off inside. There's a fragment of the path left, but I need the full IP and target device to track them down.
Reamer. There you are little bastard. Okay... What do I do next Dr. Lin? You assess the condition of the intestine. If it's alive, you separate it from the belt and cut out the hernia.
Why? I have a document here from DS. It's for me. Take a look. People leave unsecured secret files here for someone to take back to the archives.
For this ballot box? Did they go to you and not to me? There is a certain recording. Indispensable proof. I took it to Peter Florrick.
Please leave Will Gardner alone, or I will sue you for harassment. Let Mr. Gardner understand that I do not forgive. - What? - He obtained the video of the ballot box. He tried to show it to the governor-elect.
It was then determined that Mrs. Mother had not paid taxes for the past seven years. After settling legal, tax and state costs, the balance was $1,500.42. Most of this went to pay for the warehouse where, at your request, her personal belongings were deposited. It was a good thing that you showed up. The rent was paid only until the end of the month. In 60 days we would put it up for auction.
He promised to keep me. Do you think he is a man of honor? He is his brother's man of honor. Here is the proof. So how can I hand it over to Martha?
Do you recall? Yes. This is the box? Yes. We found it in Joe's bedroom.
You can see for yourself. Sorry, I didn't know it was on. No, you came at the perfect time. I added lights to the alarm. I was just about to test them.
Come on. This is not the way back. Where are we going? There is an entrance to a hidden tunnel. I found it playing here as a child.
I am so sorry. That was 25 years ago, take your hand away. How protective of his younger, sexy little sister. Interesting. Even a strong man, held long enough in front of a piece of cake, will eat it.
- The doctor will examine you before we let you go. - Thank you. "Ms. Amber Johnson, an intern at a local pharmacy. She stole significant amounts of percocet, oxycodone and vicodin, - and sold them to students."
Captain! Order them to remain at their posts. - The fire cannot reach the Tower. - Yes, sir. If the pumps don't reach that far, we'll have to shred them.
I am so sorry. That was 25 years ago, take your hand away. How protective of his younger, sexy little sister. Interesting. Even a strong man, held long enough in front of a piece of cake, will eat it.
/There was an egg inside. - God. What is it? - Melanie, leave it! - What are you doing? - Put it down. /I took it.
Dr. Isles. Yes, Susie? None of the instruments are working properly, and the spectroscope is completely dead. i don't even have a reading from the barometer. Did you check them before we left the lab?
No one bothered to pick it up. Yours for two shillings. Fair question. Good boy. - Hey, what's in there? Someone brings them down from Colombia and then doesn't pick them up. There were two.
Everybody knows that. I have a list here. - Animals? - Diseases. Even if we catch a fraction of it, my herd won't know what attacked them.
Lars Pierson. His number was found in Danny's jacket. I'll lock you up next time. - I'm pregnant. - We have to keep them.
It's not getting to me yet. He also knows exactly where the mini-dome was. From where? Twenty-five years ago, with three of her friends in the same place, she found a meteorite with an egg in it. She said she wanted to protect it. The others got aggressive.
What and where is dad? In Philadelphia. They found your car and impounded it. He went there with Melissa to pick them up.
These here are my root logs from 19:00 Last night until 07:00 this morning .... What I did and the jump where I did it from. Well, I'm sure a world-class engineer sees no problem faking something like this in his sleep. Well, then of course I don't know what is the root of the log. Every action ever performed on any device are recorded on a single permanent digital footprint. You can not change it delete it Describe deletes it, or even touch it.
We were. The only good thing is that I killed her, because that would have been a huge mistake. Cindy was carrying your child. She was carrying a "fetus." I told her to remove it. She refused.
Why am I even here? Because I'm connected to some egg? No one even knows where it is. I do know. I threw it into the lake just before I found you.
- I've had enough of your accusations. Who knows your story? You appeared out of the blue on the day the dome fell. Shouldn't you say something? You knew about the egg since 1988, when you found it with Melanie, Lyle and Pauline.
Charlotte, this is my brother. Hey. What? Oh, em... my mousse, leftovers. You can have them back.
They think Joan wanted revenge on me, and Gorman and Jeffries were unlucky. - That's exactly what happened. - Bullshit. I noticed the broken jar. I closed the office and cleaned it up before anyone could notice.
Guess who bought the maiden Life-in-dissolution car? That he did what? Apparently, when you're responsible and an adult, you don't get anything. Apparently, the fifth wheel on the cart needs to be greased. And buy a car to fix it.
Face the car. Are you really going to sit there? I thought it was obvious. OK, I'm not a monster. I can unplug them.
We will find out what mistakes we made on Arun. Why organize another mining expedition when we have something much more valuable in our possession? We spent billions to locate the source of the substance and encountered an alien entity in the same place? This can't be a coincidence. There are many more reasons to protect it.
Money doesn't know where it comes from. And they wouldn't give a damn if they knew. One generation. That's enough in this country, if you play the game right. You have the soul of a gambler. Gambling implies risk, and I eliminate it.
I'll give it a go. I'm sorry, man. You did everything you could. I thought the captain was dead. His brain is dead, but he's pressing to make his heart work, so we'll be able to transplant it into Nick.
No one opened the door. Well, it's hard for a mummy to run to the door. And what about the inheritance? Fran's mother had less than $90,000 when she died. She gave it to her stepfather.
- Liar. You work for the guy who imprisoned us for an egg. What are you doing here? They sent me to report on the egg. He has been monitoring them for a long time.
I'll teach you fly fishing. Are you all right? Fuck off, Linda. The vending machine swallowed my two bucks. I dropped them in, pressed the button and nothing.
- It's not a social visit. Okay, I take that back. Wexler is getting rid of a huge stake in Gillis Industries and you have to creatively buy it for Sanders. If I'm not mistaken, Logan Sanders is prohibited from buying any more shares. Therefore, you will create a fund for us to buy them for him.
Where is the video? - I get it, but... - But what? Now they want $2 million. I saw them.
The following memories have been erased. Please focus on the message. Here is the Karabraxos bank - the safest bank in the galaxy. A fortress for the super-rich. If you have the funds to buy a star system, here you can store them.
You will always be our citizen. If only it were true. - As if the gates of hell had opened. - That warmth emanating from the house. - When was the last time you felt them?
My granddaughter is prettier, even when she dresses up! We will invite your parents. Let them regret leaving us. They will have to give you a wedding gift. I'll put them in here.
We will invite your parents. Let them regret leaving us. They will have to give you a wedding gift. I'll put them in here. Keep them in a safe place at your leisure.
But no. People who work for free. What. You and Russel bought things for Ray's restaurant without looking at the terms in the contract. He said he would prefer to sign them this afternoon.
I want it on paper. I can't believe it even a little - he's not worried about his dad's inheritance. - Please, can we stop talking about it? You know he's going to throw it down the drain.
You know, because you're going on tour, I thought you needed them and.... Did you really sign that contract? Yes. I won't take it. No, I want you to take them.
I'm just trying to connect the dots here. Well... I guess you and your dots have to ask Juice. I'm trying to solve the murder of your daughter-in-law here. The mother of your grandchildren. Save your sanctimonious nonsense for some idiot to gulp down.
While changing, explain to me what is going on here? Today in the dining room, they gave me tempeh. - What the hell is that? - Soybean cake. If you marinate it well it tastes like.... foot.
But you have many mirrors. I have many... Hundreds of them. But none are that important. For what I'm planning, your former home will be perfect. The person who imprisoned you here imbued them with dark magic.
- Is that why you wanted to meet? No, I... Can I sit down? - Please. - Thanks. Yesterday you asked me about returning to the hospital and I thought to myself that if there is a position, I would like it.
What contributed to their capture. Did you learn anything from the autopsy of the heart? Unfortunately, nothing, there was no DNA or prints of the killer on the package, neither on the heart. I can only say that it was expertly excised, three to five days ago. And by the vital organ's reaction, it seems. was still alive when it was removed.
While you guys are figuring it out, I'll go online and make an appointment with her. I came to find out about the piano. Dad, did you forget? No, I left a message with your caretaker. I have to move it by tomorrow.
/Three years ago, Matt boarded a plane. /Without any luggage. /And he should have 18.5 million. If so, they must be on the island. And what do you want to find them?
Because then you will never know the truth about your father, you know that? And you won't make it easy for me if I act too openly. Tom has really messed up. I don't know what else I can do. I can't help the fact that your friend left here with the serum, or that he was so stupid as to try it out.
Are you aware of the link between your city cards and your ATM cards? Yes or no? Think "direct debits." This is the key concept of everything we are talking about today. It's called a network of links. Take one set of data and link it to another set.
So he died from strangulation. Strangled with his hands. One can see injury with the shape of a finger. I collected the killer's DNA epithelium from his neck. I have already sent it to Henry.
When you add water to the flour. You get a dough. From the dough we make bread, doughnuts, pasta and all the other hooey-free foods that people love. So, if we clean the dough of all starch by removing wheat, water, starch we get pure gluten. Not "biobased" but a pure protein blend. - So eat them.
I spent years staring into that mirror, but in the reflection I saw only pain, just like the Nordic king. You are going to cast this spell. A spell of shattered vision. I would need a lifetime to accumulate enough power to cast the spell on the entire kingdom. Fortunately, I only have to cast it on you.
So it seems that Tomas is not just one that the customer was cheated. Well, if these guys knew who he was, maybe someone else did too. (Katya) You are wasting my time Your load of drugs is fake You will never keep them.
I was asked this question. Guys, Building "H" is located nearby. Follow me, follow me, follow me. Okay, Happy, can you get any gas from this tractor. Paige... Find her something to collect them in the
That is, the whole exchange was a sham. He was simply checking to see if we were watching him, and we swallowed the bait. The problem was that it might be too late. The police searched every scrap of the bookstore, and they found not a trace of counterfeit money. Maybe he had already liquidated them or maybe even burned them.
/Wealthy means rich. / Live in a place about which a Persian would say: "a little lot". A pool instead of a ceiling. You have to buy them. I would prefer to see them before buying them.
Enough! I'm in charge here. - What proof do you have? - We have proof that while being ASA, Mr. Agos, suppressed evidence in favor of his client, and protected Mr. Bishop from prosecution. The evidence was two kilos of cocaine, which went missing after Mr. Agos took it from the evidence room.
- I understand. - It doesn't matter what you see. - If you see a siren popping up.... - Mermaids are not real. I won't remind you, - how expensive the lenses are.... - 548 dollars. That's why I'm giving them to you....
It's more than that. Paige... He melted down. I'm sorry. Ok. Get that software we came for. We'll take it to the plane.
The wall may be gone, but I sense the remnants of Ingrid's magic here. Leaving this city was never easy. Ingrid didn't change anything. She wanted to stay here alone. She wanted to turn Storybrooke into her ice castle, and apparently she wanted to protect it too.
Wow, you are quite difficult. I guess you have to be when you took Caba. Stop. So he said, , when you come back to the computer after a while, the suspicious file was deleted. This means that anyone who plant them, programmed Trojan horse to destroy all data viewed by unauthorized persons.
Not for us, we called the police. - We will have an escort. - Great thought. But hurry up. In 2 minutes the gold will melt, I'll shape it into a thrust bearing and we're done.
A passenger with a sword stabbed the driver of the Raj when they stopped. The passenger dumped the driver's body here and then sunk the cab in the river? Yes? Look at the windshield. These fragments look like it blew them out from inside. No.
They're going to get married! They will have a snake! How do you do it? Love potion. I have them all.
Are you sure? That's a bad game. I wonder what JJ would choose as his three wishes? Surely, for starters, he would want to cure cancer. Going to the bathroom. Later, he would probably want lots of money so he could donate to cancer research.
I spent years staring into that mirror, but in the reflection I saw only pain, just like the Nordic king. You are going to cast this spell. A spell of shattered vision. I would need a lifetime to accumulate enough power to cast the spell on the entire kingdom. Fortunately, I only have to cast it on you.
Good. Then I'll accept the check. Are you proposing to me? I don't have much cash at the moment. I can't go to Lee because he wants me to stop taking it.
I can't go to Lee because he wants me to stop taking them. That's stupid. He wants you to be thin, right? Stupid. I'll want to put them down eventually, but....
It's silly. He wants you to be thin, doesn't he? Stupid. I'll want to put them down eventually, but.... I am taking them under full control for now.
- See you on Sunday. - Wait, wait. And the car? It's standing by for the fire department. If a fire breaks out, move it. Please, just be careful.
There was a ring is all I know. And the pictures? Were they in the wallet, too? Yes. And you decided to hang them on the refrigerator?
Were they in the wallet, too? Yes. And you decided to hang them on the refrigerator? Listen I don't know anything else. I found them.
Yes, and you decided to hang them on the refrigerator? Listen I don't know anything else. I found them. These pictures are nice, so I hung them.
Your dog shits wherever he goes. It's disgusting. This is not a dog shelter. Either Jonathan or me. Cab , if you don't like it.... you don't have to work here. Is this your natural hair color or do you dye it that way?
No. Never beg anyone for anything. The preservation of honor ... lies in my hands now. The circus is my life. You have taken it from me.
Our circus, will be the best in the world. - The greatest show in the world. - This is not a circus. Anderson, this is the future of the circus. The circus is my life. You guys took it away from me.
We need to save the sick one. If we only take one, it's better the healthy one. What a jerk you are. Take the sick one. Leave them.
I have always wanted to be an architect. And you can see it in the design of the palace. It could be built. Everything I have designed in my life could be built. Looking at the details, you can see very stylized walls with water flowing from them. I designed them knowing exactly how they would be built on the plan.
- I don't need it. You do need it. He likes this car. You have. Please take them.
He likes this car. Here. Please take them. - I don't want to. - Take them.
Ash leaves. Where did you find them? In the park. This is the most beautiful tree in the forest. Dad ... How do you recognize them in winter?
Allow... Rhythm. This word was going through my mind as I listened to their broken whispers at night. I was thinking about the word "rhythm" and whether my mother connects it to Frank.
HEL They said it couldn't be done, Kif, but here we stand, stealing an unlimited supply of helium - from an unsuspecting moon. - Ym... The sun. At night we call it the moon.
Get on with it, the young man is waiting for my advice. Continue. George, let the men take the plane and let them carefully collect every part. I want every piece. Let them take them to the warehouse on Governor Street. - Sir.
I'm thinking. Hey, I can tie it for you. I mean, I don't know if it's Windsor, but it's kind of done on me, to the church. Tie it on me. Then we move it to you.
You know what, maybe Derek is right. Maybe you're the one who doesn't have a good view of the show anymore. I have a perfect view of the show. I can see Derek changing it because he's jealous of me and Karen.
Be glad I don't beat women. Tell me where my diamond is. I swallowed it. I sold your diamond. I swapped it and sold the real one.
I admit we can be mysterious, but you can be so too. I would like to know da Vinci's story in the light of day. We will be different men when all hell breaks loose. And when is it supposed to happen? Hell will break loose when the evils of this world outgrow our belief that we can overcome them.
- There is the kingdom of the Franks. Much bigger, richer and more powerful than England. Athelstan, come up. Come. The man has seen them.
You are family. He will do anything to keep us apart. But since you are a child, he will be willing to trust you. That makes you my secret weapon. You will hand me his schedule, find his food supply and then poison it with your blood.
Definitely Irathienka. Don't stop there. There are creatures in the woods that we don't want to meet. Going in this direction, we will hit a settlement. I saw them on the radar, but I don't know how far away it is.
But I certainly wouldn't throw it out the window. My paycheck doesn't allow me to play Robin Hood. But Jesse is apparently giving it a go. - Oh yeah. - And he certainly has a reasonable explanation. He found one.
Sorry to hear about the takeoff. Seriously. But these creatures... This lost world... This is most likely the last place where these animals live. I just want to protect them.
The company's official spokesman, Mr. Spock, (Leonard Nimoy) The sound is great We've been using it on Enterprise for decades It's about time you introduced it on Earth
No, Mr. Eagles. That items belonging to the victim were found with him, that five people saw him leave the scene in a hurry.... - Which no one saw. - ... And that he is no stranger to violence. And in the end, when given the opportunity, he didn't even try to deny anything. Lusk and his primitives raised a whole collection of hymns about guilt, and the whole world took them up.
The friend had a key. The nanny gave it to him. He was dressed like a cop. He was hiding under the disguise of an individual that no one knew about. Except the nanny who gave it to him.
Your teacher called. Mr. Beattie? Did you plagiarize a paper? It seems you already know the answer. Yeah, he looked it up on the Internet.
Others do, too. Pop-folk is very popular now. But without the support of my woman, why bother? Wait Doesn't that mean you have a job, we want to find an apartment, we want to get married and move on? I had a dream - all my life and you just sunk it.
- Good morning. Good morning. Let me help you. Please. When can we unzip them?
I have a few more keys. Forfeited. You are still $2,800 in arrears. I still have a carton of your stuff.... You can keep them.
Elisabeth? He's just a baby. Maybe he's hungry? He is very hungry. I wonder what else he is eating?
* You stole them... * You stole them... * You stole them... * When I lose my heart, you always catch it.... * I fit you, like the pattern on your sari. * When I lose my heart, you always catch it....
He just stood there and watched. And I killed him. So I'm sitting there, covered in blood. And Frank reaches over ... And picks up a stack of bills. He pulls them out to me.
So I'm sitting there, covered in blood. And Frank reaches out ... And picks up a stack of bills. He pulled them out to me. The blood was on the top bills. And I took them.
I know the law favors mothers, but Tammi is not a mother. She's a surrogate mother. A new haircut? - For a police star, or what? - I just cut it differently than usual.
I can send you the results, just need a phone number. I haven't seen it in a while. It looks like a nice meeting with a girl. No. Admit it, she slipped you her number, writing about the test results. - She sent them to you, too.
You will get to know. I'm going to give you the rest of the day to hand over my money and pills, otherwise bad things can happen to whoever messes with us. Yeah, right. I can add two to two. So maybe, I'll go talk to that hot blonde policewoman, or you can give me my money, and I'll forget about her number. Just get them for me.
Chemical synthesis means it can be done quickly and cheaply. I have contacts here, at a factory in London.... Selfridges' own fragrance. Something exotic and refined. Ellen could lance it.
Selfridges' own fragrance. Something exotic and refined. Ellen could lance it. - Is that a good idea? - We could call them "Spirit of Selfridges."
Shoe manufacturing. I have plans. They are. I'm going to make shoes with flaps at the shoelace holes and a double tongue so that water doesn't fall in. I think such a shoe will last 3 years, and then.... after 3 years, we'll subdivide them.
Alec fell off his chair, trying to save the fucker. Sam also wanted to save everything again and again. Everything. Flies, spiders, shells. He covered them with a cup and slid his drawing block under it.
While George continued to unravel the enigma that was Dahlia, I was privy to the details of Lisa's mysterious date. - Okay, listen to this. - Yes? Every morning she writes a poem. And every sunset, he burns it.
My proportions are changing, and need a new setting. Then will you lend me your dress from Paris, since you're too sexy to fit into it? No. It's the prettiest thing in my closet. You wouldn't be able to squeeze those melons into it anyway without causing a shelf effect. Why don't you let me borrow it?
I've known you since you were little, Jan. Say, Simon. What can I do for you? I would like to give you my insect collection. I can't take it with me.
- Card. Please. Check it out. And you know what... I won't give it to anyone.
Do you have it, doll? Where's the card? Where is the card? Here it is! Damn, it's not here.
Did you write it? Let me see. The damn thing cut me! Where is your card? I don't have it.
I want, I don't need. I don't need anything. If you should know a thing about me, know that I don't need anything, I want. And I want this information. It's a little strange that he can give it only to you.
Our bodies reveal the inner truth. Release what limits you. Pain, deficiencies, fear. Replace them with energy, abundance and confidence. Your roots grow from the force that binds all life together. Let it take control of you.
They will stop you at the airport. - You need to have that wound stitched up. - The airport? We are going home. No. The road to Kunlun is open, and you don't guard it.
Here is the map to it. The doctor brought it back from India. Really? Wait a minute. If you want to look at it, we need to cooperate.
No. Because you still feel something. You talk about darkness and darkness, but you don't want to live in them alone. - You have met death. - And you are afraid of it.
No, I'm even more stuck! Okay, well, take off the bracelet. - Tear it off. - Dee, I'm probing. I can't undermine it.
Wait a minute, Dee. - I have an idea! - What if Sherman can reach the bracelet with his mouth, maybe we can get out. You said you couldn't tear it.
He had until the morning, he can't pay so I'm taking him. I need, a few more days. A few days, was not part of the deal. Come on. When you make a deal, you have to keep it.
We will last maybe 10 seconds! What's the matter Roman, did you forget to put on your winter boots? Do you still love that Lamborghini? Be that as it may, we'll fire it up later. Now I want the boat, to be under water, where no one can find it.
- At least half an hour. I swear, I almost killed one before he shouted "enough." - Why do they want to be beaten? - For strength, supposedly it's like peeing. You gather strength in your belly and have to give it an outlet somehow. Apparently, being beaten by a countess works well.
We would be crazy not to take advantage of it. - This is not part of my plan. - I don't know your plan. I don't know anything. You asked me to put on Melissa's mask, and then you don't want me to use it.
I have powers you won't understand. And I own a destroyed brothel. Because I hate magic, more than you do. Are you sure? I'm glad you banned it.
I'll say it again. The Anglo-Americans have been much more vigilant since the attack. The last show is at the camp in Singhat. From there the crate will be taken safely to the other side of the river. Why not hide it in your ambulance?
This is not about England.... Or its king or even our freedom. When I thought Madi was dead, I looked at the world through your eyes for the first time. A world in which a man had nothing left to lose. I longed to make this loss meaningful. I wanted to give it meaning no matter the price.
- Maybe we'll see each other again. Get out of here as fast as you can. And bend your knees, you'll walk more quietly. I could hear you from a mile away. "And when that happens, when we let freedom sound, when we let it sound from every town and village, from every state and city, we will be able to hasten the arrival of that day when all God's children - black and white,
Here in the middle are pictures of people eating poop! It's not my job to make opinions or judgments. Do you think that when your father asked about this syringe, you could have asked him.... -He wouldn't have asked about it, okay? He wouldn't have needed it.
Until the Medici invented banks. Wealth and pornography drive innovation. Technology has other advantages, too. A safe car, an artificial heart.... Or a short gun. It can be equipped with a fingerprint scanner. So that only the owner can use it.
I know where to get. You achieved glory by killing a mass of fascists and then you just give a leg up. I left when it was over. Glory lasts only a second. I experienced it and then gave a leg up.
Open the fucking door! More than a dozen arrests have been made in connection with the attempted assassination - earlier this month. - What the fuck? According to David Wellington, chief of staff, representatives from all branches of government, including the Department of Defense, State and the Central Intelligence Agency, were arrested. The president is sending a clear message to citizens that our democracy is strong and resilient, and we will do what we can to defend it.
And with it a great flood. And I have to sing to stop it. Do you have to sing? For the past two years I have been recreating the path of singing. You know very well that every community has a part, so I had to learn it piece by piece.
- She said he was worried. But worried about what? Because it seems to me that's not the whole story. The whole story is in your idiotic book. And I still don't know how you convinced those two to hide it from me. They didn't show it to you because they knew you would react that way.
It's probably not like the libraries you're used to. - It is wonderful. - Wonderful. Really? Fantastic. Love it.
Of course not. I haven't heard about it. I'll look into it right away. Someone needs to organize an open forum on campus addressing this issue. The school needs to prove that it cares about all students.
How did they write it? "Excessive use of force." I had anger management problems at the time. It's ancient times. I think Ian had an artificial intelligence that you wanted for your dolls, but he wouldn't give it to you, so you decided to convince him by using force, you ended up bludgeoning him to death.
Based on a lot of evidence, we concluded with Hodgins that the killer is not a lumberjack. So we are not looking for a lumberjack's saw, but an ordinary one that can be bought in a store. Therefore. we test them all. And what is this supposed to give us? Cam, if we can determine the model of the saw used, maybe we can find its owner, among the suspects who are not lumberjacks.
Did I think about killing him? Yes. It was ... a brilliant move. But you made it clear during the election that you didn't want my help. I didn't need it.
Not really. People don't like the truth. The truth is risky. You can't rely on it. Try it out.
She bumped into the barbed wire. Why did you want to speak with your sister face to face? - You read the e-mails. - So it was about the farm. Half of it is hers, she cared about selling it.
Then how do we find him? Again. Have you read "The Art of War?" That's not likely to be on the reading list at art school. You should learn it.
You are supposed to look as young and innocent as possible. Very pretty. It's fortunate that she still has the features of a child. So, besides the whole makeover, what is your strategy? This is the bulk of it.
Since I can no longer see anything, the past only creates new targets. We are not targets. We are the team. We are your strength. You are the one who gives me strength until Chase turns it into weakness.
Their life, my life is better, thanks to you and the decision to become Green Arrow. Whenever you decide to be Green Arrow again. You are right. I believe you are right, but when I take a step forward, I feel as if the past is dragging me down. Perhaps, because you let her.
Someone has been hammering us. - I talked to Adelstein this morning. - Fuck, I forbade you. - He told me about the settlement. - I won't accept it.
Where are you going, kitten? What were you thinking about? About the parents. I have been searching for justice for so long. And now that it has been done....
These are preliminary results, but in the first tests it came out that her blood attacks the cells in her body. It's the opposite of my blood, which causes cell regeneration. Exactly. Can we save her with my blood? I don't think your blood will help save Iris, but I think we just need it to catch Yorkin.
She is a very brave, strong woman. You can see that right away. And she wants to be with him. Although she was very afraid to tell you, although it is very dangerous to be with him, all that mattered was that they are together. When you find that kind of love, you should stick to it.
No, she went so fast because she was unhappy, because I didn't want to have sex with her. I don't believe you. No one refuses such a girl. I also find it hard to believe. As for your package, Burt.... - I don't have it.
- Where are you taking him? - It's nothing like that. Everything will be fine. I found this bag while working. Did you touch it?
To the fireplace. What did he tell you? That I keep the cash here? I haven't seen him for months. Amateurs. It is no longer here.
I don't think so. These are our faces. - And our store. - And my advertising. You can't broadcast it without my permission.
I wish everyone. I really regret that I had to resort to such extreme measures. You can't manage the company back. You need our approval. Consent. And if I don't get it, I'm ready to leave.... After you hear what Dr. Whitehall has to say.
Under the petition to the prime minister. What do you think about it? It was broadcast in Henley four days ago. I can compare the writing. A lot of people have touched it, but maybe the prints can be taken off.
They pay him to sell stuff. Here you go again. Sales will soon increase darling, I promise. Do we have enough for another glass? Depends on how badly you want it.
- You said it could help. - Lance told you about a friend, right? - Victoria Jemmet. He said she was a client. He said she came across an opportunity in real estate, but she can't take advantage of it because she doesn't have the cash.
No... And it won't suit me until it suits you too. Last night I wrote a song. It's called "Girls Who Spill Coffee." Would you like to listen to it?
This version is not me. Bottom line. I understand. It's a new one. But I hope you will at least give it a chance.
I can't find it anywhere. I'm sorry, honey. Do you remember where you last saw her? No. I just hope I didn't leave her at that stupid party.
They have been sent from over the wall to overwhelm our brothel, which is not only embarrassing, but could have serious consequences. We need to find Broussard and recover the hosts' artifact. Nothing in your resume convinces me that you will be useful. I have been working in this district for six months. I know the rebellion inside out, I know its structure.
But I don't want my daughter to suffer. We are alone. You have family here, right? A sister? It wasn't easy with that either. I know from experience that family will always rise to the occasion if you give them a chance.
Where was it? Here it is. Wait. "He knew he should write back or at least call and say they could give someone his place. For some reason, he couldn't pull an envelope out of his back pants pocket and drop it in the mailbox.
- Did I think to kill him? Yes. It was a masterful move. You let me know during the campaign that you didn't want my help. I didn't need it.
You are not welcome here. I expressed jsano. Mr. Skinner, take her out the back way. I offered you an olive branch, Priscilla. One day you'll wonder why you didn't accept it.
Let's drink. How the fuck do you even know what he told them? You don't know that. You don't know what he said. He presented his version and stuck to it.
We'll see, but for now, Quentin, Alice, Penny, and Margo need Battle Magic. Are we going to teach Battle Magic? It used to be compulsory. Until it was banned.
The meeting is not over yet. The monks' philosophy is simple. Take each thing in your hand and ask yourself: does it still give me joy? If yes, you leave it. If not, you thank it for its service
When someone better than you is standing outside, in front of the bars, you stand up, turn around, and have a stare. So much better. Do you know what I want from you? Your attention. I will demand it, every time you stand in front of me.
Real estate agents do not exist without clients. It's as simple as that. God. - It would have been easier with a lid. - I couldn't find it.
Because in one of the books it is written that blood has to do with passing to the other side after death, like slain warriors on the battlefield, or a hunter's prey in its final stage.... human sacrifices on altars.... and sometimes blood is used as currency. Release. What if blood can be used as a form of payment for passage to another world? Blood magic is very dangerous. We could only use it to get to the other side.
No news is better than bad news. Ross was to speak up when he knew something. Be assured that he will keep his word. That's how the Poldarks do things. This altercation between Ross and George, couldn't you end it?
I want to talk about your offer. - You have thought it through. - Yes. - That's good. - Do you want better terms? - I won't accept it.
We get names, we move on to a project, they show up, and we move on to the next one. We never even show up to see how much fun it is there. You probably do, but don't overdo it, my friend. Do your own thing. French vanilla? Plain antimatter is good, why give it a flavor?
With all due respect, my son remembered the evening badly. And Danny took your cell phone and you went to Harbor Grill, pretending to want to make a call.... did your son misremember it too? Danny... told you that he gave me his cell phone? But you didn't use it to make a call. You used it to look at the app your son installed there long ago....
My Sandman gets the best of me. - You came! - Of course. I love your new album. - I listen to it every day.
Illegal? No. So yes. He gave me some pot. You have to try it.
Where is the machine? We don't have it. Didn't it survive the landing? It survived, but I had to make a decision.... Bring the machine back or use it to save them.
From now on you have the same duties towards your husband. If he does anything against my interests, - I want to be informed about it. - Yes, my lord. As for love, if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere.
I will not ask for more than you can afford. And if I don't get your son back, you won't sweat anything. Don't you use the pool often? The pump is broken. I don't see the point of fixing it.
What is the situation? We have good news and bad news. The good news is that the truck with the transmitter is parked next to the tool shed, so we have a chance to turn it off. But the bad news... A heavily armed squad is guarding it.
- Good. Breathe deeply. It may burn a little, but it should pass. You have about an hour of increased strength. Don't waste it.
Do you really have to go now? Yes, I have to take the book to a safe place. Will you keep an eye on my brother? - The gate is almost ready. - I don't need it.
I don't know. You'll have to figure something out. What is the shipment? Apparently important. And don't open it.
In fact, quite similar. Not even a little bit. I have a business card. "Captain Shlam's sailboats. Each boat has its own sail."
They check the monitoring of nearby businesses. Nothing here indicates that he met anyone. Things from the guitar, but no guitar. He took it with him. If he has a guitar, he wouldn't have stored it.
Let it go, Koen said. Is it alive? And it's very much so. Let's see what else Cleverman's blood can do. What we can do to it.
- But we have to deal with it. Every time it is lost. In one month, half of it has been lost. Act. This money is worth nothing if I can't launder it.
I lost my family because of it. We had an agreement. They were able to come back here. And now people are showing up with questions that I don't have answers to. They made a deal with us, they have to keep it.
So shopping, in search of a new service? I joined d League of Women. I wanted to do something that makes me happy. My wedding ring. Where did you get it? When I ran away, I couldn't leave it. I thought you would want to get it back.
What is it for? For protection. 1915 semi-automatic, fully loaded. I'm not comfortable taking up arms. Violence is not the solution. Use it to prevent it.
Yes, but I imagine ... boundaries are often blurred. I can assure you that they are not. Impressive to experience the darkness and not be consumed by it. We don't have too many choices, do we? Either we reject the darkness, or we let it destroy us.
I am not a dictator here. The residents are not my servants. This is a place for free people who ask for help only when they really need it. And that's what I'm asking for. And I need it.
Here's what. You could have just turned her off, Liv. She works here? You murdered her, didn't you? You found out she was recording the sessions and made up to steal her memory card to blackmail the recorded guys.
Bajie,I... I know where the book is. Oh,don't bullshit me. You should have explained it to me earlier. It's in the conservatory. The widow plans to use it to restore our Powers.
It was only her fifth insemination, and now she's probably dead. - What are you talking about? - They probably moved her. To that wonderful facility for B-positives? Listen, morons, we're here because the shearers like our blood and want us to produce more of it.
Paint, of course, non-toxic. I like the yellow. Do you know how many shades of it there are? I got a job offer in Colorado. Higher position, more money, Conor is also applying for a transfer. I know we decided to raise this child together, so if you have something against it, I won't accept it.
Immediately. That what? Did you lose it? I didn't lose it. She was here, and then she disappeared. And did you look for her?
- I would also like to ask questions. - This is not a full trial, - and only a question of a motion to dismiss. - We just received this information. We were supposed to use it during the trial, but we will save the court a lot of time and money if we ask them now.
Diane ran the fund's legal services. Because she was a friend of yours. No. Because we paid her. Is that why you had the "Screwed List" from Uncle Jax's computer? To use it against Diane?
Is it little Liam, - the one from the religious parents? I didn't believe it when I saw the name. How did you get permission? I didn't need it.
He is jealous. Maybe, but as for the magic, he's right. The war is over. You don't need it anymore. I can't reject her, Bae said.
Not crap. Ask yourself: what will a Wizard need in difficult times? Answer: magic. But if it's lacking, it's lacking.
It's amazing. The spear must be composed of some magnetic material that connects itself No, no, no. Stop. Don't touch it. When the Spear is whole, it will try to tempt each of us to use it.
I understand. But I assure you that we will conduct a very thorough investigation. Thank you for your cooperation. I would like to get a recording of your conversation. I did not record it.
The Huggins Awards Committee contacted me. Apparently you won the award and I didn't give you time off to attend the ceremony, which is interesting because you didn't ask me to. I'm sorry. - I used you as an excuse. - Why don't you want to accept it?
He says he's clean, but his money disappears somewhere. He always hits me and Dean for change. If he desperately needs money, some extortion may have gone bad. No. Carter has personal problems, but he and I built this company from nothing, he wouldn't jeopardize it.
I know that they do not work. This arrow is a tool. It will lead you to the person you love the most. The fairy told me about the man with the tattoo. You can use it to find him.
I don't know how or why, but something strongly motivated him. - This. - Great. That's why I want to move him to Math 2. I know it's unusual in the middle of the school year, but now we have his attention. We don't want to lose it.
Could you tell Melcher that the Pied Piper people have come? Are you guys from the Pied Piper? You guys are behind this amazing network? It was amazing before it went down this morning. Two minutes ago I was using it.
I control their minds. Just like you do, many, many times. I don't know what you're talking about. You know you have this power. You have used it all your life.
I don't know what you're talking about. You know you have this power. You've been using it all your life. I always thought I had ... even divine luck. True, you used it instinctively, but now you have me.
No but when I entered... Did you identify yourself as a police officer? Absolutely. Did you show him your badge? I would have shown it but I couldn't find it at the time, but then I found it, so it's fine.
- Don't. This pyramid is 5,000 years old. There is only one problem. One small problem. Yesterday it was not here.
We are modeling the future. Each thread is a chain of days leading to your end. We can detect the disaster that is about to happen. - I? - Prevent it.
Did you write it? She's not bad. Why didn't you ever record it? I don't know, maybe a little bit because of the Spanish. No one has managed to sing it like that before.
Simone, I'm done with him. Okay? I'm done with him. Star, where are you going? I'm going to Hunter, where I left my sweatshirt, and I need it for NextFest.
Well. Didn't I mention that there's a problem? Merry Roger is not in this world. He is where the woman I mentioned is. If you want to collect the winnings, you have to give me the beans to use.
Hey. It took a while, but I found the dress. I saw it in French Vogue and a stylist finally tracked it down. It's by Andre Devereaux, a total pioneer. No one else will be wearing it.
Oh God. Cluck, I'm so sorry. I can't wear the dress you chose. It is beautiful. Great for someone else, but I can't wear it.
No one tells me anything. What are we doing here? What are the tools for? Well, yes. I went to get the Smurf gun. And I would use it.
What you want there. I'll agree. Whatever it is, we'll help you, but you have to.... How do you know what I need? You need help. I can't give it to you, but as your friend....
Last time was a few nights ago. We have a lot of boats here. Will you give some details? A 13-meter Super Sport. - Someone was using it illegally.
Interesting. I feel a bit cut myself. - Do you? - Yes, and yes. What to do here, when such a feeling of cutting arrives? I think then, if you have a card with coupons to cut, you can use it.
So let's get one thing straight. You're the one destroying it, not me. It's snowing. I installed an ice machine. Fortunately, Liam didn't cancel it.
- People? This Apothecary is good. - Do you already have a report? He knew Helen Dahle. In the sense he got to know her. He knew her medical history and used it against her.
How did it go? I was thinking about what you said about why I needed it. To tell you the truth, I still don't know. But I know that this family is the most important thing for me. I don't want to lose it.
Traces of ink. Ink? What kind of ink? From a printer, a pen? There are a hundred classifications. I don't know, Sebastian, but the sample was so small that I preferred only you to touch it.
A conversation filled with deep and far-reaching implications. If not... - The conversation will be very short. - Yes. A great pity. Worse than death is to be removed from the future after having sacrificed so much.
Nothing. The less she knows the better. Kelly Hughes, her mother jumped to the top of the list of organ recipients for heart and lung transplants two days ago. <It may have been encouragement from collaborators. My mother had an infection, but as soon as she got better they moved her up the list.
- He doesn't. - Where's my rain jacket? The jacket? On such a beautiful day? I need it for the presentation. It has super pockets.
On such a beautiful day? I need it for a presentation. It has super pockets. Mom said she would find it. Take it easy, Mateo. I looked for her everywhere. It's not here, but I'll find it and drop it off to you.
She led a lurid life. She took everything for granted. Only whenbination was left to her. Evil may be powerful, but I.... Why simply enjoy defeat when I can use it to my own advantage?
May you cooperate tomorrow. For your own good. Hi, Tom. Ray says. I dropped off a package for you. Try to pick it up before Natalie. I didn't sign for it, but it's in the mailbox.
- Of course. - I never part with it. - This is a good thing. It may be the only hope of this world to defeat the darkness. I will guard it at the cost of my life.
- She used magic. - Young, magic does not exist. True faith is believing in what the eyes can't see. Look into the book. - Touch it.
True faith is believing what the eyes cannot see. Look into the book. - Touch it. - Henry, enough of that. - Touch it!
The point is that Helen knew that the brand meant I was with her. She wasn't alone. It's a coin, Owen said. One that no one or Maxwell Fletcher or Alice Winter will notice. It will remind you that you are not alone, until you need it.
Just like on a camping trip. Please try these peppers. Surprisingly good. - Your friend has a gun. - That's right. But he won't use it if you help me locate the passenger.
You know who else looks different today? Terrance Valentine. The man you put in charge of your crime. You're wrong. The gun, the one you've had all these years.... Your son used it and killed someone yesterday.
He turned around and wanted to leave. So I pulled out my gun. To show him that I wasn't joking. And he said: "Did you bring a gun, bitch? "You'd better be ready to use it."
Do you know how to fix it? Like before? It can't be done. We have to operate and we have to do it now. If the other half falls off, the valve could end up in your brain, or anywhere you'd want it.
- That's good. I need to know what will happen to my hand? - I will lose it. - We don't know yet. Now I'm going to look at it carefully.
No! Waverly! No, Nicole, No, you told the truth, you don't have it.
This third seal. Constance's seal. Is it worth all this? OK... Maybe we could use it to lure the Widows?
Mr. Reyes got into a fight. He ended up in solitary confinement, where he had trouble breathing. A doctor called in gave him medication, but he still died in a few hours. Since there was a fight, there must be an official note. We cannot make it available to you.
I don't know who I love. But you are pretty and funny, and I like the way you pinch your nose when you sneeze. I am very sorry that I hurt your feelings. I appreciate your sincerity. But you didn't appreciate it at Olive Garden.
I also have a message for you. Yes? A major film company is impressed with the sales results and wants to adapt Variable Emotions into a movie. If this comes to fruition, you will gain even more readers. It's a great offer, but.... I can't accept it.
But you ... You are born of God. That's why you can revive birds, heal the sick, restore sight to the blind. That's why you were able to revive Eleazar. He brought you into this world to experience wisdom, like so many other things. Do not reveal your power until your Father in heaven gives you a sign that you can use it.
Some of them certainly served. What does the tsarina want? She hasn't said yet. But it is located in an unmarked Defense Department facility. They use it as a weighing station for sensitive materials entering and leaving the country.
I don't know where they are now. But you know where they were. You have no idea how long it took me to find you. The closest loop was in the California desert. I used it to get to the loop in Tokyo.
David, do you know the average age of a Hilldale resident? No. 82 years old. Have you seen the skin of an 82-year-old? Have you touched it?
Desmond, you can't donate blood two days in a row. - That's good, after I wanted it back. - What's that? - I need my blood back. - We can't just give it back to you.
Who. Oh here you are. I've been looking for you everywhere. O there it is. My book, I looked everywhere for it.
Unlike. Are you a bounty hunter? - Prosecutor. - And where do you carry a gun? A man carries a gun when he wants to use it.
But I know someone who would say otherwise. There is a boy who can tell the whole story. He can even tell what happened next. He knows that the Pole Star shines brightest. He knows that there is magic in this forest. If you know where to look for it.
Pleased to meet you. We came to pick up a book that your husband was kind enough - to store for me. - Yes, the book. It is lying somewhere in the house. When I have the time, I will look for it and send it to you.
One conversation, right? It's Billy. They have him. Take him to the cement plant in Deptford. We've already used it.
I don't know if it's science, but it's certainly not religion. Water is denser than air so when light passes through each droplet, it refracts into individual colors to form a rainbow. In that case, Noah's rainbow was a reflection, not a promise. If we begin to explore the mystery of humanity and discover how it works, will we thereby destroy curiosity? We know that music is made up of notes and chords, quarter notes and rests. But this, after all, does not change the beauty of its sound, or the inspiration of beautiful thoughts.
Unlike those who want to control you, I want to set you free. I know the mutants you are looking for. And I know where to find them. This is my first time in America, and I'm excited about your culture. You are unlikely to see it here.
They beat me. They broke my bones. I protected my face. It's Aryan's face. Nothing could happen to her.
It's titled "A Model's Secret." - It's really sweet. - It's not about you. Just about another model I know. I will listen to it, but I am terribly busy right now.
That was 20 years ago. We are here to help. And I'm black. The Russians are black now. If we fix the well, you can't blow it up.
Movements. Good. They were nice to me. Get your stuff. Where's your jacket? I don't have it.
Can we go in? No one entered the cell. Strange. Did anyone move the camera? No one touched it.
- But you didn't smell it before. You didn't. But now it's gotten colder. The heating season has started. Look for a boiler room that burns peat. And don't forget to put it under surveillance.
There is something else. I am pregnant. I wish I hadn't died. And if my eyes were closed, I could almost touch the edge of nothingness. But I made a promise and I had to keep it.
- I put it out. - On the car window? Who does that? Other guys would put it out on her face. Before that, you knocked on the window, as if you wanted her to leave it. She didn't leave it.
Wars are costly. And without funds, Charles is helpless. All we have to do is make sure his chest remains empty. Let's hope the French finance minister can recognize a bad investment. If a Scottish rebellion can be wrought in a French brothel, perhaps it can be prevented at the French court.
- What did I say that was so? - Be quiet, okay? - We have a lot to do. - What about the boat? There's nothing to keep it if no one will swim.
I will send the car there. - The bottle was found here. - Why the narrowing down? We can rule out the Kattegat. The currents wouldn't have pushed it in that direction.
He is a victim. And Naz is not? If I were still his lawyer, I would at least pretend to think so. Like with the atomic bomb. You don't want to use it, but if others know about it, they'll be quicker to settle.
Are you injured? What's going on there? It's bad. Can I get my gun back? I will need it.
Farley, bring a camera. Luke Cage is in action. You're still banging away like a babe. - Briefcase. - Don't you have it?
I am her mother. I knew something bad was happening. I don't think Anna can wait any longer. I'm sorry. I really want to help, but I've had this job for two weeks, and I need it badly.
So here you are Anjali? Have you found all the balls yet? Yes. Yes. Look, if you were busy looking for the ball you won't find it.
They show this, - what I identified as a glove. - What did you do next? I walked over and looked at it. - Did you touch it?
I suggest carrying it out now. The farmer gave her food every day until she got fat. The hen thought the farmer was a decent man. One morning he came like every day. But he didn't feed her, he killed her.
Not at close range, I would shoot from a distance. If it comes to a fight, I'll give him a gun and we'll shoot each other fair and square, like in the Wild West! This ramp is a hoot! Mem. I don't have the money to fix it.
Is this your card? I'll ask the deck. Is it a challenge or a threat of a terrorist attack? - Give me the damn deck. Pick any card you want. Take a good look at it.
But this judgment seems very unpredictable. The law was followed. If the deal changes, it's hard to say what else will change.... What confidence can be lost and what chaos can be stirred up. I am your friend, and I will help you with whatever challenges await you on your path, but as a friend, I only ask you to think about how treacherous this road can be.... While there is still time to avoid it.
- This is not me! - This is an improved version of you. You are the first one to return from there. You have been given another chance. Don't you want to take it?
Or like a kaleidoscope of human suffering? It's not an image. It's a feeling. It's like the fog on your face on a cold morning. You can't see it, but you can feel its moisture.
Drain. I quit smoking and hate chewing gum. I didn't ask. Speaking of that phone call. Let's listen to it.
A kilometer with a hook behind the forest. A rural atmosphere. Not a bad backyard you have. I appreciate the silence. - I fucking hate it.
But just when I was about to do it... I saw how he was doing it. To someone else. I had never seen such senseless brutality. I was so paralyzed by the horror of the situation that I didn't notice the appearance of the moon. And after I saw a snippet of what human nature is capable of, I didn't want it any more.
- Everyone is repeating it. - They don't. We just need this room for a few minutes.... For research purposes. That's what everyone says. You know what, I've never seen a patient get so much attention especially since it's someone so unworthy of it.
We'll stop by on the way back. When do we quiz the girls by the pool, Harry? She left the dirty dishes. Cell phone. Not surprisingly, we were able to locate her.
What if, in trying to save the world from Savage, you expose him to an even bigger bully? We are not warriors, Captain Hunter. - We don't have an army. - And I'm not asking for one. Give me a single ship and let me change history before Vandal Savage puts an end to it.
I just met another American who cares and is a real cookie. We have a problem. Cece is doing laundry and I can't get into the hallway. She built some kind of dam. - And you can't cross it?
But who to trust here? I thought I could trust you. I won't explain my behavior to you. I was entrusted with the task of protecting the intellectual property in the park. And what was her threat?
"You need a rabid dog, in England it is Anthony Julius". - Nice term. - Someone who in court will not let go. I don't appear in court. I prepare the case, I don't present it.
I don't know if he realized, in agreeing to a trial without a jury, that he would receive a written verdict that would deny him once and for all. Some believe the verdict threatens freedom of speech. I disagree. I am not attacking freedom of speech. On the contrary, I defend it against anyone who offends it.
I leave my phone so my mother doesn't track me. She doesn't trust me! And now the best thing: I attached my cell phone to his collar. Mother will think you are walking around the house. Can't you put it in your pocket?
Then they told us to pick up the same parcels and deliver them to the original addresses. The building directory indicates that apartment 908 is empty. My instructor said that packages have been arriving there for weeks. I think they are all from electronic companies. Maybe the machine is diverting them there, looking for something to help it rebuild.
What did you say? - That the soup... - Say again. Good evening. I didn't want to disturb her, but if she had time, she could teach me.
I'm sorry for that hit. But you must know that I won't let you escape. I won't. Khatun fed me a mystery. I didn't understand it, but I felt inside that mystery, a bomb, a plank.
Why are we always trying to understand? The future is dark. Not bad. Just dark. You can't see it.
- Don't forget that you are lost yourself. - You don't even have a map. - I don't need one. - I know where I am. - You probably wouldn't know how to read it.
The one in the cap was cool. Invite him for a beer. Maybe he'll let you touch a bird. None of them had energy? He didn't feel it.
You see it as a curse, and I see it as a gift. - A gift? - Yes, being under the control of a force that wants to destroy me? Only because you resist it.
A 15-kilometer Arcadia border should be enough. 15-kilometer? Sir, there is a village of Earthlings there. So there is no doubt that it will be an ideal place for retaliation. Clearing it will be our first task.
Hey, give back your jacket. What? Why? Is it needed for the scene? No. Then I can't wear it yet?
I know that your parishes, faithful and temples take up a lot of your time. But I hope you appreciate that the masses of the population look to the movies for knowledge, spiritual uplift and yes, entertainment as well. At Capitol Pictures, as you know, hosts of technicians, actors and top artists work hard to bring the story of Jesus to the screen. It's a great story. Yes, it has been told before, but we flatter ourselves that no one has told it with such flair and sophistication.
I'm not saying that only screenwriters are being used. Look at you, Baird. The label takes care of me. What are you, a child? Herschel is trying to say... Just because the label has the means to produce, why is it allowed to take all the money, our money, obtained through our work, and give us a tiny part?
Good. You've won. Again. We had an agreement. And even though I was under pressure at the time, I will stick to it.
And they weren't there when we secured the house earlier. I gave her a bracelet. I didn't want it to be lost. And where is she, if that's true? I couldn't find her.
Is that exactly the kind of person I am? What do you think? I don't know. This is exactly how you manifest guilt. If you didn't feel it, you wouldn't lose money, you wouldn't punish yourself.
All in all, not much going on here. As loving as ever, Vanessa. She told her story. Yes, ladies. Did the doctor believe her?
For this you will buy a lot of ice. - The map? - A map by Helena Blavatsky, a Russian occultist from the 19th century. She claimed that with it she could track demons. - I don't have it.
We'll do it this way. Howie and Russel were going to give you guys a thrashing, but I'll let you walk away in one piece. You know what the funniest thing is? I didn't even know I had the map. But when I heard you were looking for it, I hid it somewhere you wouldn't find it.
Remember when my mother almost left my dad because he financed your campaign? She hated you so much. But I didn't care, because I saw the future. Our future. We had a future until you started destroying it.
- Do you want to testify? - Yes. Regardless of your emotions, you must answer truthfully. Lying in court is punishable. I know, I am not afraid to tell the truth. I'm afraid that I won't be able to tell it.
It's guilt, not truth. I told you it would hurt. Again. What J.J. is doing with "Star Wars," we are doing with "Everlasting." We are rebuilding the brand by giving it a new quality.
Thanks to the responsibility I will be burdened with. But I am most humbled when I look back. I look ahead and see a chasm. A huge chasm, dividing this country north and south. You will not ignore it.
We can't fight them like we used to. They are just waiting for that. We'll start shooting, and they'll come back here with a whole army. - So if that... - Listen well, the deviant. This mountain belongs to us, but we don't have it for free.
Would you get Daisy back and the three of you could live as a small, twisted family again? - That's the ultimate. - It's madness. I want your help. I need it.
That is, there was a big puzzle. I was trying to figure out how Felic.... We have work to do. HIVE is responsible for the Havenrock explosion. They stole a cyber weapon called the Rubicon, and are now using it to take over nuclear bombs around the world, so we have less than 24 hours to stop them, or the world will experience a continuation of "Wargames."
And I saw him. In the picture in the briefing room. I was sent to him with a gun. Before you ask, it's a different weapon. Illegal, untraceable. I can use it on you.
But it takes time.... And distance. It doesn't. I should wake up every day and feel it, remember every drop of blood I spilled. Do you still have that memory machine? You used it on Strucker's son.
That was the old me, now I'm different. And now I will get a bullet in my head if I don't return the bracelet. If I give it back, I will be involved in a crime. If you keep it, you are guilty of a crime. And let me tell you, my donor is not the only one looking for it.
We talk more now than when you were Christopher Hall. /Where are you? On my way to the Larágan consulate to return their bracelet. /Alice, don't. Agent Dao is looking for it, too.
Does Father speak English? Why didn't Father tell me this before? I was babbling like an idiot for the last childish minutes! "Sister Antonia is hiding the water. She uses it to control the sick and the nuns.
I will take care of it. It's not good. She's bleeding out too fast. Her metabolism is faster to compensate for her superhuman speed. Can you help her?
I'll tell you this... Read the dosage on the package. Yes, they come in different sizes. Take a tablet and hide it in a bowl.
As I closed the store, I immediately bought a cab. - Well, and this is a good example ! - Joke, to yourselves to your heart's content. Moving forward, I put my taxi license up for sale. - You haven't started paying it off yet.
/This mountain belongs to us, but we don't have it for free.
He must wait for his brother to find him. - So he couldn't go far. - And like any male... - Every mammal, a young wolf. - Seeks comfort where he has already experienced it.
Involving oil companies is the only way to win Republican support. Remember when you let me win at beer pong? We were sitting in those chairs and you asked me for advice. It was good advice. You listened to it.
One that this city needs. Ladies and gentlemen, we know that the city needs help. And it needs it now. Not tomorrow or next week or when the corruption of the Wilson Fisk era is gone and the police are back on their feet. We need it now.
How did you survive the six shots fired by Barnes? Is this a normal reaction after saving a life? Checking the individual? I'm looking for answers to things I can't explain. I gave you an answer, but you did not accept it.
Dealer Tommy Campolongo appears there. However, nothing complicated. You two will sit in the detention room, and I will.... It makes sense that he'll have the cash. - But he won't give it back in kind.
Does anything here remind you of an old case, Detective Dumm Denaci and drug addicts. I can't believe the guns are back. - From where? - We haven't located it yet, but we have heroin we found in Tamika's car.
You got out of prison. You recovered the weapon from where you had hidden it. - No. No. - You used it to kill Tamika and her child and hid it in the church to frame Reverend Price.
I hoped it would look like I had taken revenge on Emil for planting a gun in the Reverend Clay Killer's church. And that cell phone. You planted it, too. And why is it important? Because someone used it to call Tamika and Emil, right before they were murdered.
Relax, today no one will erase your memory. I will still make people out of you. I'll tell them to give you another chance, a trial period. They will respect my decision. Just so I don't regret it.
- No, but you can pay me. - Pay? - I'll take your food card. - They wanted it. - I couldn't just give it to them. - Now you can give it to me.
This place should collapse. I agree, but right now we have more important things on our minds. Where is the chest? - Right here. - You need to slow down. We can't lose it!
I wish to take your sister into my bed. I would like her to become my mistress. - Have you asked her to do so, my lord? - I ask your permission first. Of course I grant it, Your Majesty.
When they reveal themselves, you are supposed to be there. Let's get them. Agent Pritchard, in a word. I know some agents look at you crooked for ratting out your partner and boss, but from my point of view, you did a good job. - You took an oath and kept it.
- We will gain time to track the money. Why is Helen mad at me? It's not my fault that she chooses crappy guys. You were not a role model for her. I paid for your master's degree in psychology, don't use it against me now.
You will not remain in misery forever. You must give me enough time to clear your name. I don't know if we will meet again. I want to leave you with one last piece of advice. And listen to it or live in endless danger.
He is trapped there. He needs my help. - This weapon is unlikely to be loaded. - Why do you think so? If it was, you would shoot through that chain. That's what you're looking for. The Connavers implanted a shield for me to guard it.
/The turtle is dead. Make a decision in exchange for your daughter's life. I'll help you steal Flash's speed. 2 YEARS AGO People think tar is only used to patch roofs. Curiosity. It was also used in medicine and as a flavoring for candy and alcohol.
Don't judge me. Didn't the chick just break up with you? Something tells me she did. Hi, Harry. Since you have a view of the whole city thanks to this app, why don't you use it to look for a girlfriend?
I don't know. I mean, it's crazy. I found a woman in a jacket, it wasn't your mother. Xander, this sick person.... Did you touch her?
- You read my book. It took me all night. By the way, it was a great read. They should make a movie of it. I made the mistake of not reading it earlier and I apologize.
You poured a whole wok of boiling oil on the cook on the reality show known as "Scarface Man." That's not what we were supposed to talk about, but survival behind bars. If I were locked up, what would you advise me to do? The ground is power. Who has it and who wants it.
The ground is power. Who has it and who wants it. Once you have it, how do you keep it? What will you extinguish in yourself to stay at the helm? And if you want it, what will you do for it?
We don't need to talk about it. No, this is good. - It will distract you from your brother. - I gave her my advice. She didn't like it.
I've had a run-in with Denton, I don't hide it. - But I wouldn't kill her. - You already said that. I didn't have a gun. If I hadn't given it back, I think someone would have tried to get it back?
It will take some time. I know - Wish her a lot of courage. - Yes yes yes. Because of this Wong Kar Wai. She will need it.
It's like touching a bare wire. I've never felt more energy. A pleasant feeling. Dangerous. You treat magic like a drug because the people who taught you magic act like dealers.
I can't help but wonder if you think the baby should be Juliette's and not mine. I had a chance for a normal life with Juliette. You gave it to me by depriving me of Grimm's power. - That was not my intention at the time. - I know, but still, we had a chance and we didn't take it.
"Total war or none? When I stand in front of the cameras and say that Conway and Brockhart are right and you gave a crap about the ICO, how do you think Dunbar will go? I'll have two Cobb salads, please. - I don't like Cobb salad. - Then you don't have to eat it.
You don't give a damn about me. After what you did, I should hate you. But what will that get us? Check out the Telegraph. This strategy works if you let it.
I expect more from you. You were supposed to tell me what people want. People didn't know they wanted jazz until they heard it for the first time. I can make them like some music. I can't compose it.
I have a friend who will give us a good price if we pay cash. Not bad. Okay, but how do we wash the money? Coke money is dirty. But thanks to the fact that it's in cash, it can't be traced.
Your job is to get out of my way and stick to your assignment. /You weren't a terrorist before, but that's what you're going to become now. /Listen to me carefully. /First thing tomorrow morning, you will receive a certain package to the address of FBI headquarters. /Do not open it until you receive further instructions.
/Raina, get out of there. /I have to report it. /Listen carefully. /Tomorrow morning you will receive a package at the FBI field office. /Do not open it until you receive further instructions.
I? We examined them. The bomb was in the trunk, placed in the spare wheel space. So it was hidden? If you opened the trunk, you wouldn't have noticed it.
You managed to get some much-needed grain for your country, if that comforts you. You know, you were right. I want love in my life. Honestly, who doesn't want it? But I... as a queen... oh, I was lucky to experience it at least once.
I heard that they will release it next Eid. If you want, I can... May my God bless him too. I just got my identity back. I won't give it back.
I will help... But on one condition. What is it? Don't let it go too far. Your bond with Jace can withstand some tension. But promise not to let it break.
Hasaan is yours. - You will have your meeting. - I'll get back to you when I'm ready. We have to give him the package. We need it to clear you.
I just, yy.... Eliza gave me the answer, apparently, and I lost it. "Fillory and Beyond, Book Six." This book was important, and it just disappeared. Were you looking for it?
You know, first I want to make things clear. Richard can forgive, but I, damn it, can't. Look, I'm really sorry that you had a bad relationship with your mother, but not a day goes by that I don't feel terrible about what happened to her. I'm not to blame for her death, okay? My only regret is that I couldn't have prevented it.
Jesus. You use time magic to change what you did. Yes, but only a natural-born time witch could do such a thing. I studied all the sources that are available, and one day I realized that I was looking at it the wrong way. We don't have that much energy, but we don't need to produce it at all, because someone already has it.
Not a bad herb either. Ximena. Wait, you know her? He knows her. Boys, you can't win this war, you can't even start it without knowing who these monsters really are.
This... request. This is one big field trip for you, isn't it? You're a lousy follower. I've been to war! You just teach it.
I heard him get up. I shouldn't let him do that. It's not your fault. This farm has been in Russ' family for generations. If he can't run it....
I escaped through the tunnels. Their outlet is in a cave somewhere in the forest and.... The next thing I remember is that you found me. - Where is this cave? Would you have found it? - Yes. But it is guarded by something ... monstrous.
It doesn't matter if he finds out or not, if he doesn't have his snitch there. - What are you talking about? - If they want me to point someone out, it means I have a gun in my hand. She's still alive. - Did you think I would let it wither?
Yes, we'll see. We'll try to figure them out. But that's not all. There was another path hidden in the song. No attempt was made to mask it.
This cannot wait. I am officially handing you my resignation. Let me guess. Robert Zane has made you an offer. It's true. I don't want to accept it, but I have to.
A little strange, isn't it? A little unusual. Maybe we should put it off. No, we continue with our wedding plans. From now on, working on this issue means we won't let it take over our lives.
Bottom line. Officially... Takes the burden off you, okay? Yes. What's that? You take out a bottle of good wine and then decide not to open it?
Americans died... soldiers - men and women.... Their children in that nursery. We have come to terms with that. I hope you will, too. Did you give Shelby your 9/11 access card? - She used it to steal the witness protection agreement from the file.
- She used it to steal a witness protection agreement from a file. We're sure it had to do with her parents. Our rubber ear overheard her phone conversation with her mother. Yes, but the old witness protection agreement is useless. Unless she's using it to frame them, get them down here before she sends the feds after them.
Great. You said Bobo has two skeletons, and the skull is part of one of them. - He is trying to resurrect them! - Where did you hide it? I can't give it to anyone.
Bella doesn't know it yet, but she got pregnant! And you know what, you remember him? You made a deal. You wanted to avoid it by killing him during a potentially child-bearing affair with your protégée, the Evil Queen's mother, Cora.
So I hope that maybe you can help me with that. Do you want me to work with you? When things get worse, I'll call you. There is work to be done, Zora. I can't do it myself.
- I will disarm Magnetar. - We will destroy Magnetar... And we will save the universe. One more thing. We have to agree. We made the decision together, so if something goes wrong, we must stick to it.
We can go to the border, near the river. People can come from both sides, so it's a little dangerous. - But there is water there. - That's why it's dangerous. Everyone needs it and everyone is heading there.
We will not release the beta. We integrated the network a week ago. The platform is full of bugs. But that's what the beta is for. You give it to people in the real world, they use it, and that's how we find the bug.
I need to talk to Mr. Du Clark immediately. That's not possible. Mr. Du Clark made sure that the event was really private. The gate has a time lock. I couldn't open it even though I wanted to.
Why? Because my business doesn't matter? That's not what I meant. It's just one day. Listen, I have a training session with Alvey, so I can't miss it.
Safely disappear somewhere. I hid the emperor in various places for months, and you still found us. You're fooling yourself if you think these soldiers will be the last ones you encounter. Our protection is your best option. If you want it, you have to earn it.
I have been thinking for a long time, what is your plan for me? You are to be a shepherd for your flock. Nurture them and the church. After all, I have failed. Why did you give me this power if I can't use it to save them?
What is it like to be the most powerful woman in National City? First of all, it's a misnomer. No one calls me the most powerful woman in National City. I believe they call me the most powerful person. Having a platform like mine is worth everything if I can use it to draw attention to people who really make a difference.
This is a meeting to discuss your family, Your Majesty. I felt it would be best if we made recommendations - before engaging you. - Good. Also, I want to discuss my family and what you have done to them.
- Don't. - Do you remember anything? I didn't want to. It was that mask. I couldn't take it off.
Someone stole my likeness. Stole it? Damn. There is no point in substituting a new one, because it will be stolen again. I can't replace it.
No one can see us here. I used the internet from the car to connect to the cameras pointed at the rocket. It was confirmed, 3 astronauts are boarding. If we let this rocket take off, we will kill these people. And if we don't let it take off, we will effectively kill Linda.
That's just the way I am. - You weren't always like that. Even as a coward I craved power. The difference is that now I have it. And I won't give it away.
Rat poison? - Three small steps. - It's a Mexican substance for rodents. After it, a mouse will go only three steps before it dies. You can't buy it in the States.
Even a medium-sized asteroid is an interesting discovery. Maybe it will collide with Earth and destroy known life forms. You have different dreams than I do. - All in all, it's cute. - We can give it a name.
I'm having a good day, too. That is, we are talking about you. Dr. Gallo made me realize that I am a valuable human being and my feelings count. I learned this for free from a poster with a cat. Back to me, I discovered an asteroid and I can give it a name.
- What's up? - You are an asteroid. What should I say now? I'm already saying. Me and Koothrappali discovered the asteroid, and I gave it your name.
And I appreciate it. I really do. And your challenge is...? I want my new "Identity" to be about how a traumatic childhood event can affect people's whole lives and how they deal with it when they grow up. And Buzz's story would be perfect. But he doesn't want to tell it to me.
A funeral parlor worker who can't come to terms with his own mortality? Bai's mask was used to approach and execute three gang members. It was later discarded. Meng's mask suggests an obsession with the Snake Eye boys. Perhaps she intends to use it to commit more murders.
Oh my goodness. But that was great. Yeah, I bet. Listen, I think we shouldn't wait too long. I want another fight and I want it soon.
It's not your fault. No one ever taught you fucking manners. You know what, you should finish that fucking bottle. You're going to need it.
Okay, she didn't see me kill the seal. But we saw. We did it, friends. We cooked the perfect pork. Too bad you can't taste it, because you're all dead.
I'd better keep quiet. India, Carson, this is how bad life choices end. She'll probably be homeless in a year. Is my purse here? I didn't leave it in an Uber, did I?
I'm going to see if this pattern matches any of the players' plugs. So that means you leave little Roland with me. He seems much happier here. So the customer hits a ball that goes into the woods, off the field of play. He goes looking for it and someone hits him with a stick.
And when they kill, it is accompanied by a specific ritual. - Meaning what kind of ritual? - They bury their victim up to his neck in the ground with his face facing northeast toward the river. They cut off the head with a katana and throw it under a bridge. - Why do they do this? - So that the victim's soul is in eternal danger, preventing it from crossing the hereafter.
The end, right? Please don't tell the president. We've been through so much together, don't put a cross on me, I beg you. This job is everything to me. I already lost it once, I can't lose it again, please.
We live in a world that is one of many. The Beast you saw is from one such place. What does Jane have in common with the Beast? Still the same stubborn little Jane Chatwin. Ember gave her the ability to influence time and Jane used it to create a time loop.
I do not cultivate it. Too much time is taken up with preparations for governing. Now, second breakfast. Sir Piers, how do you view the railroad? Happily, sir, I don't see it here.
There is a camp in the mountains for intolerable children. It was also my idea. I set off the alarm. I bribed Lily with drinks. I screwed in a red light bulb in the laundry room to give it a sexy look.
I'm not nuts! It was great. This is exactly how I imagined it. Connie cut off our bubbles. So we took the fish and threw it into the vent.
In this one? What...? That was a good trick. And where is my wedding ring? I guess you'll have to look for it yourself.
You won't believe it until you see it with your own eyes. I'm new to this, my Lord. What do you want me to do? Where is the wig? - Do we really need it?
Sure, and you don't mind it rolling all over the ambulance, right? And why do you seem to care? He's slinking around and making calls, and then.... And if I were a baby, I would have just been a corpse. I don't put it there when the patient is in the ambulance.
The operation ended an hour ago. That's great. Good news. Kelly... call this blockade a "widow maker." If they couldn't find it,
Yes, I know. You keep saying that. Go to sleep. Well, no. - Will you finally turn the page? - I haven't finished it yet.
This is a very appropriate place. Alcohol and maniacs. It's all about us. I know this application is driving you crazy. We don't have to stick to it.
Sweet boy. You are too good for this world. I wanted to make a tough guy out of you, but I couldn't. I couldn't bring myself to take that goodness away from you. I needed it in my life.
I am now infecting you as well. Twlilight, you need to stop looking at this as something bad. It's easy for you to say. Magic has turned you into something beautiful. The last time I wanted to use it, it turned me into a monster.
How do you know about magic? I see things and feel them. Because I also have magic, just like her and the rest of our friends. Gloriosa, Timber was right. Maybe you should stop using magic. Too much can be dangerous if you can't control it.
Yes, okay. Okay, guys, delete the pictures. Or what? Your mother and her fascist thugs will track me down? Fascism is the direct opposite of the representative democracy you're lucky to live in, thanks to people like our mother who defend it every day.
The flight is on time. Go check in. Thank you for all your help. I would say it was nice... Go home. Go to the operation. Don't avoid it.
A pleasant feeling, no? The local air... The long trip wore her out. What's in the bag? She'll like it.
I had to go. I had to get them to safety and then call for help. Did Corporal Allman ever ask for help? - No. - And did you not offer her? I didn't know she needed it.
The realization of this visionary development concept was made possible by the government's agreement to sell the land on which the center will be built for the symbolic sum of one dollar. The long-term benefits to the city and the community are enormous. This project will create hundreds of jobs, and leave a wonderful legacy to members of the local community, without engaging in gambling. If there's anything our state doesn't need more of, it's poker machines. Mr. Boccaro, your center is building the community, not destroying it.
And they say that people don't change. But you say, Mike, that this currency was never given to the Sunnis? No. According to the records, army personnel involved in financial support were ambushed and ordered to burn the cash. And then that cash shows up here, where our victim used it to tip a girl during a striptease.
We can bring him here from Holding and he will personally identify you. Good. So what? I bought a gun. I needed it for protection.
This I left in the hotel room. 10000 British pounds. Too much to flaunt, right? I'm a dude on vacation. Cash is easier to spend and can be used everywhere.
The double homicide looks like a big departure. - Then maybe he's a witness. - Do you have an address? The current one doesn't, but he has a benefit card. He uses it almost exclusively in Dorchester, and that....
For all of us. I know, but I... You asked him for help. And he gave it to you.
I promise we'll talk about it later, but the most important thing is safety, so we have to get you to the surgery. No, no! Cut it off! - We'll talk about it later. - I don't want her!
Please arrest her. She steals blood and affects the outcome of the competition. I am treating Mr. Shathmary by disgusting him with drinking blood. I call it: "Blurred Lines Medicine." When you hear this song for the first time and want to listen to it endlessly.
I know you have looked at the evidence and know that government forces torpedoed my investigation. I have looked at the evidence. I also read everything I could about the body you found in France, the "scout" from the last attack, but I didn't find a cause of death. That's because we couldn't determine it.
No, there were no ghosts either. I suppose we won't find out anymore. You know, I wouldn't have believed it myself, but after Lance died, I saw him, he told me that I had to live on. And that helped me a lot, I wasn't trying to make fun of you or anything like that, I just thought... that if someone is trying to give you a message, you shouldn't miss it.
It is needed immediately. No. There is no use for a surgeon. Only blood can save me. I don't have the heart to take their blood. No, oh Lady, you don't have to take it.
If the facts are not described, I will have to ask myself why. Will you tell us how it went? All in good time, Mr. Shine said. "Despite our best efforts, neither I, nor Inspector Drake, nor Captain Jackson could break down the iron gate that Inspector Reid closed behind him," he said. "He wasn't going to open it, and he matched Mr. Buckley."
Jesus Reid. Horace Buckley, they have everything. Mathilda. No, Mathilda. "He wasn't going to open it and got to Mr. Buckley."
I need my napkin. What. Under your drink is my napkin. Sure. God, don't snatch it.
We believe he is bullying Alison. If you don't go check it out, we will file a complaint against Dr. Rollins and you. Against me? On what grounds? For having knowledge of the situation and ignoring it.
You forget that I am a poor Italian who faced Mrs. Bligh and won. So what? I can beat you too. We shouldn't clash. We both fought for love, and.... we are both ready to defend it.
Chan Gyu, listen to me carefully. You don't work because you want to. You work because you hate it. If you feel like doing something, it's called a hobby. Work is work, so you have to do it, even though you hate it.
We have been working with each other for a long time. I know you and your stupid macho attitude. - Why don't you admit it? - Okay, maybe I was a little scared, but I wasn't taught how to deal with death. I was taught to do what I could to avoid it.
When you first appeared on the scene six years ago, the evidence indicated that there was only one perpetrator. It was an extremely destructive force. Other serial bombers, like Ted Kaczynski, George Metesky, were motivated by unspecified resentment against society, but the Bensonhurst bomber was acting under the influence of something darker. He doesn't seek revenge, he has a great passion to blow things up. But the thing about passion is that it can be passed on, it can be learned.
I'm sorry. I'll let the sheriff know that you can go now. Doctor. Thank you for your kindness. I haven't been getting much of it lately.
For free. We decided not to take the money, so why don't we baptize her and launch her. I'm all for it. I admit that I am bewildered by the name Kamekona chose. MAGNES ON STRING - I didn't choose it.
Handsome guy. You also have a rabbit bracelet. You must like them. Mommy gave it to me. She said I shouldn't take it off.
She was killed at the arrival of the empire. I did not manage to save her. I was as powerless then as I am now. I was unable to secure her future. True power does not belong to those who covet it.
Hey. Where did you get your ring? I don't know. I still had it on my finger this morning. Didn't you leave it in the cabinet?
- Because it doesn't work. - Exactly. It doesn't work, but we have an hour to change it and confuse them. One hour. What if we don't fix it in time?
I did the same thing when I was a child. I would lay out my mother's clothes on her bed to resemble her shape, imagining that she was there. It excited me. When I was a little older, 12, 13 years old whenever I had the opportunity, I acquired women's underwear. I used it to masturbate.
Why? As you said... For protection. Did you use it? No, I didn't have to, thank God. Thank God you didn't have to use it against you.
You need a rope, a rational explanation that you tell yourself. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as you believe in it. As long as it allows you to forgive yourself. Find that rope. Do it, grab it tightly and use it to get out of the darkness.
- I was his wife for a quarter of a century. Yes, but it didn't work out, so don't upset him. I won't. Your speech is an insult! - You haven't heard it yet.
Sweet, what is there to think about? - Do it. - He has a pussy. In a way. Does she have a real pussy, or does she act like a pussy? No, a real pussy, although I shouldn't call it that, because it's out of order.
Mostly by me. That's incredibly generous, but I can't. - Is our money bad? - It's too good. That's why I wouldn't want to jeopardize it.
Damn. An email from Professor Donaldson. - A response to my novel. - Here we go. - She liked it.
Baby steps. Giada's next sandwich is ready! Hi. Excuse me. I'm Giada, and I heard that you created a sandwich named after me, and all of Twitter is buzzing that I have to try it.
It's a trance. You get a huge clitoris from taking testosterone. - I don't get it. Does she have a vagina? - He doesn't call it that.
Because they are lonely. HE SIGHS You don't have to be lonely. Okay, Niska, we'll change the test let's play music for you. I want you to say what you feel when you listen to it.
- Commander. - Sgt. I can't imagine how difficult this must be. I want to extend my sincerest sympathies. But because of your personal ties to this case, neither you nor your team can actively pursue it.
Do you think you could ... finish what you were doing before we started this conversation? The woman at the museum in Bhutan, she discovered that the scroll exists yes? - Yes, that's right. - So why did she call you? She has evidence that it exists somewhere... in a temple in the mountains, but she can't locate it.
You are brilliant! You always need to know where the reserves are. Let go of your past. It's easy to say. Now is the time to let it go.
I am very happy. I have to tell you something. What. I stole this sculpture from someone's studio and tried to sell it through Martin, but Martin took it and gave it to you. Just don't put it in a place of honor when Dad.... When they come to you.
- You are in danger. - And others are not? You know that in an alternate reality it was the destruction of Eos 7 that started the war. And you think the same thing will happen here? We think the Guild smuggled the bomb. Three and Six are looking for it right now.
You were good to me, even when you found out I wasn't human. I don't want you to die. - So deactivate the bomb. - I can't. It's inside me, but I don't control it.
- What does this have to do with her? - It was her husband. Shaver. Please wait a moment. She told me to return the dress. It supposedly brought her bad luck.
It's not your fault what happened to Cricket. You don't control everything, Deb. I should protect her. What happened to her can't be undone. But there are other kids here who will need your help and will need it soon.
Cottage. - What kind of cottage? - Holyoke's cottage. Holyoke water, which we already used once to fight Malfas. We can use it again.
Thank you. I too am a big fan of yours. However, I must admit that I have never used your app. - But your daughters use it? - Yes. They use it and they love it.
We are a dirtier species than the Lankin people are used to. It's so sad when we can't let go. In my world, love is practical, almost businesslike. It means combining what you have with what someone else has. It is this combination that is love, not the will to make it.
I will report it. - Mom! - I will go. Let me go. Kids, reload your weapons. What if you need it?
Can you take it? Thanks. Do you think everyone who listens to this song is infected? No, but it's a very old song. It's strange that someone uses it.
I don't have my jacket anymore. Do you want to know why? This guy is wearing it. It doesn't even fit him! I can't get it back because he doesn't speak English.
What did you throw on my back? Maybe a tarantula, maybe some yarn. I'll be at Milhouse's. What's up, chicken? What a pleasure to pour tea for someone and not have to help them swallow it.
He changed. In AA, they don't hand you a sobriety coin when you show up there on your first day. They give one after you stay sober for a whole year. I don't know how he got it, but it's all a lie. He didn't get it. He's lying to you.
Do you agree with that? I don't know. Maybe he's right. Maybe I don't do the job anymore like I used to, The way I should. Sometimes I see the truth on my own, trying not to look at it, And that's because I don't want to see it.
Dangerous. At first, only one clip was found. The other went missing on the night of the assassination. Robert Lincoln searched the president's belongings himself, but the second pin was nowhere to be found. He searched for it for more than 50 years, sparing no time or money.
- Is that supposed to help me? - No, but it does to me. - Donna! - Well, all right. Since you ask for advice, I'll give it to you.
Tracking down some junkie? Regardless of drug addiction, Maria Gomez has a right to be heard. - Lord forgive me. - I'm not going anywhere! Nowhere until you understand that if you felt sorry for me, you wouldn't be taking this case at all. You are using it to make a name for yourself.
I can see it in their eyes. I should leave only you. Then I would be the one harping instead of playing with it. Art never judges. I envy it.
In this protected building there are servers with data of non-humans. I know how my agency works. Every day at the same time, Elizabeth Albee brings a disk with updated data. I steal the number from her badge. I clone her and give her a false identity.
We haven't finished it yet. I belong to the team. I want to know about everything. - Show me the book. - I don't have it.
Craig Hawthorne, murdered by Wayne... Stop or call the police. Notice the drawn line on the sidewalk. It is exactly 45 meters from Vachs Geological. As long as I don't cross it, I'm not violating the restraining order.
She has her opinions and sticks to them. The question is, will her opinions help us or hurt us? I believe they will help. Her last book I bought, To Lean In (Lean In) by Sheryl Sandberg. - She gave it 5 stars.
- Dad! - I'm back. I brought you a T-shirt with Kermit, who looks like a hip-hop artist. A departure. Don't wear it, it might tear.
Here's something else. I isolated a sample of the virus from Mon-El's blood. Based on the protein code, I'm almost certain the virus is from Krypton. Kryptonian virus? How did Cadmus get it? That's why they needed it.
It doesn't look too good. The price of business. We tried to grow aloe vera for these purposes, but not this climate. However, I noticed the wolfberry. What do you use it for?
Pickup, hot ... doll. Sophie's doll? She's covered in hair so she'll get away here as food. Just get rid of her. Sophie uses it to criticize me, so I turned off her app.
What about the carrot? Ah, yes. Yes, yes... I like the music. I've been listening to it all day.
We exchanged information. He wants to meet. Good. You should meet. It will be good for you to spend some time in the old neighborhood. If you miss it so much, why did we move away?
- Where... - Already! And how am I supposed to get home now? This model citizen John Baker, known as Boogie. He worked for the Valley Star cable TV station, so he got a van and used it with his burglary team.
Already closed. I'll work out the castle! Somewhere around here is some very important location that is only possible to see from this building through frosted glass windows. But even with an inaccurate shot, a bullet can still accurately hit a geographically defined target. The bullet will head for the target it has been assigned.
Your guest must wait. It will not be recorded. Your name will not be on the record. - We have one chance. Don't waste it.
- Medicina? Yes. Good. Show me. - He needs it immediately.
- I did. - Remove it No chance. Using this app, someone is luring and killing people. You should not use it.
Okay, the Agency is still waiting for confirmation of Mr. Crawford's moves. This is serious business, folks. And just for that reason, say hello to your "get out of jail" card. It's a card of support. If you have to expose yourself to the law, with your illegal activities, you can use it to clear your account.
In addition, there was no good news from James. Clarkson! What's the matter? I want the steering wheel back, you idiot! - I don't have it.
I can't. These people will hurt me. We can protect you. What about heroin? I need it.
No, he is right. Except for me and him, whole spheres of your life are unknown. They are known, but perhaps not completely. And this is said by a man who spent a decade as a voluntary witness to the murders. I record history, I don't create it.
- I noticed, maybe Dr. DeLuca.... - No. - Excuse me? This artery is necessary for the patient to live. I won't let her be touched by a trainee who hasn't yet cut out the tonsils.
He always saved me. - Reid, did you have scarlet fever as a boy? - Yes. Me and Caitlin did, too. That means we couldn't catch it again.
- Did he say anything before his death? - He did not cooperate. I understand that. You asked for permission to interrogate him. I granted it.
You will be detained until we verify your words. I understand. Mr. President. You have a serious problem. Although you are not asking for my help, I will give it if you want it.
I can save lives.... But I can't fix the heart. For my husband there is no hope. IF I DON'T GO TO HELL, WHO WILL? Death is the fairest. No one has escaped her.
Reade and Zapata. What are you talking about? They won the auction. Nas used Lynn Burton's money, 20 million, that's only the first half. Marconi will want the rest as soon as they get there. They don't have it, so they'll need decent support.
I know the feeling. I want to spend as much time with you as possible. That's why I started working here and.... I think I made everything worse. I definitely did. But you helped me, to realize that no matter how I care about my work, I don't want to devote my whole life to it.
Oh. Well, there is a similarity. My mother loved {y:i}the Nutcracker. He apparently came from a family of con men. Balthazar's identity was like a Family heirloom passed on to anyone who needed it.
Quiet. They're out there. - Let's assume that we all manage to make it to the end of this video game. How do we destroy the biological weapon without detonating it? You can't just disconnect it.
It simply cannot be disconnected. Biological weapons are alive. All you have to do is raise the temperature enough and you kill what's inside, bacteria or virus. This bunker should have enough resources to run a tanner. The best part is that if we succeed, the terrorists won't know their weapons are burned until they try to use them.
And you like power, don't you? Well... I only like it because it allows me to do good. Really? I think I've used my power.... rather well. For example, I used it to unite all the small, feuding English kingdoms into a single entity, capable of defending itself against anyone who would threaten it or seek to destroy it.
Why did you do something like that? It was before we started dating. Haven't you picked up any girls since the blood moon ball? It's much more embarrassing, - than that thing on your neck. - How can I get rid of it?
That was before we started dating. Haven't you picked up any girls since the blood moon ball? It's much more embarrassing, - than that thing on your neck. - How can I get rid of it? Let her fulfill her task.
This pregnancy already had a fifth wheel. Can't there be six wheels? Are you always throwing accurate remarks? Come and help me assemble the rocker. You can eat your Chinese food. Nobody moved it.
If that's all, I have a flight to catch to Indiana. Have a safe flight. I'll see you there. Will you watch the execution? No, we will prevent it.
Probably because it doesn't exist. There is no proof that the memo was not made up. As it happens, there is proof. Nina kept a copy. Why didn't Nina turn it in for evidence?
Me. The big guy gave it to me a few weeks ago. If I was going to rock with SBK, I had to be armed. I took her to Whitlock. I said I didn't want her. It would be suspicious if I didn't keep her.
Unrealistically. But she would like me to continue. I came because my associates are with your father in his apartment. The gun that killed your mother and Dr. Krieg is registered in his name. The police are looking for it.
A daring and difficult escape, but despite his plans, he was soon captured again. That leaves the last two stories, Balloon of Freedom and Oflag. Both attempts get 10/10 for level of difficulty. Building a secret balloon in such conditions is a remarkable feat. So is organizing an escape from a POW camp and filming it.
Come on, Guv. Leave it at that, Guv. Let it go. Let it go, Guvnor. They were so close to their prey that they could almost taste it.
I'd be happy to have a drink of water." Tom sat with his foot placed on his knee. In Arab culture, it is forbidden to show someone the sole of your shoe. That's not the way to do it. Tom held his leg so that the other man couldn't take it off.
- It has a mathematically perfect perigee. Based on his calculations, it should have passed Earth in the winter of 1981. - Did it pass? - No, it did not pass! Nevertheless, we continue to look out for it every year.
Not for the first time, Ella felt deep regret for these two schemers, who if they were honest would probably be just as ugly. My prince! I will be his queen! Since her stepmother didn't have a fourth dress, Ella concluded that there was no reason why she shouldn't try to sew one herself.
What possessed you to write another one? My wife was dying. We were separated. On her deathbed she asked me to write another book. Knowing that she would not have to read it.
He asked me to describe your character. The first thing I would say is that they should beware of lying, temporary insanity, self-defense, burglary and any other tearful story you tell them. How is the book doing, Mike? How is it selling? You didn't have to finish it, but you did.
Is it good? There is a song. I don't know myself. There is at least one song or part of it, but she didn't know anything about it. - And you didn't listen to it? - I have no idea.
Let it spread. Away from your bodies. Let it fill the whole room. Move this ball of energy to the field outside the window. Once there, let it grow.
- So he won't die? - Not from the poison. Bring some clothes and water. The bullet was left inside. If we don't take it out, he will bleed to death.
Yes in its entirety. It looked like a flagpole. Sometimes I feel that pregnancy completely makes me crazy. Pregnancy is madness. Either you let yourself overcome it, or you can enjoy it.
What is happening to me? Something bad. - What don't you say? ! But please, this job is all I have. I don't want to lose it.
- This is a new kind of war. Very new, since it doesn't exist. What about the Rosenbergs? They stole the atomic bomb. They didn't steal it, you idiot.
Not the ending you expected, I know. But it's still an interesting story, because after all, he was trying. And that's what counts. "Love doesn't sit in the heart to stay there. Love is not love until you give it to someone."
Which summoning spell will we use? In this book is the best one I know. You used this spell to summon Maria Absalom. This is my book. I couldn't destroy it completely.
I will call back as soon as possible. Lynn. Brian here. I wanted to leave a message for my son, Christopher. Don't delete it, please.
If we agree to create this truly crypto-anarchist future, then all of us who are working on it must ask ourselves that as a consequence we are simultaneously condoning the really ugly things that will be a side effect of the information revolution we are participating in. - In August 2013, business was working great. Silk Road had become a thriving, anonymous and unregulated black market. This use of the Internet, has become a great threat to the government, arguably greater than drug sales themselves. - Even I ... member of the FBI, I have no idea where to go to buy crack on the street, where to buy heroin, but I know where to look for it online.
Captain Low. He paid 90 pesos for it. - Why would you... - And why not? There was valuable information here. Should I have let it slip away?
How do you know that there are still fairies here and they will help in the fight when they see him flying? - You have to trust us. - Really? You guys don't trust us. There is a map to their kingdom, and we guard it.
Thanks. You know, I'm finally starting to get better at life, which is good because the runner qualifications start in the spring and I'm ready to sweep. After transplants, it can take months to fully recover and get used to the new immune system.... Not years. If there is anyone willing to help me and give me a second chance, I won't waste it.
Yes, I believe Judy said something about the best coffee in the world. I don't know anything about it. But I will tell you what it is. Hot, strong and good. And in this snow it sure warms your asses. You don't have to praise it Minnie, just make it.
Do you remember? Yes. Then tell me, brother, how much is a man's word worth today? A pannier of gold, perhaps? My oath to you is an oath to Scotland. I have not broken it and never intend to do so.
She was already married. But I have not lain with anyone so far. I want you... He will be the first and only one to have me. No, I took an oath and I'm not going to break it.
I have a cupboard full of potions and medicines. I need peppermint, dearest. - I have something to offer you. - No, I took an oath. - And I will not break it.
/ I know what you're thinking. /"It's impossible. How can it be 4028? How could so much time have escaped us? " What if I told you that this mouse could go into a state that would allow it to survive the entire winter without food, drink, and still live longer because of it?
- Not necessarily. - Pardon? The Navy has not yet taken a position. And it will not. The Navy will do what Parliament tells it to do.
A friend gave it to me for migraines. I still have them. I freeze it because it helps it retain its potency longer. My dad even uses pot rationally. I haven't tried it yet.
They were promised a sunny life, blue skies and countless opportunities. The truth, however, was different. The only consolation is that for a short time they had hope. Joy is no less intense when the moment proves fleeting. And when we can taste it, we know it is a blessing.
No, no, you can handle it. The media is moving so fast, we'll have a new iPhone, or the Chinese will be in Chicago. - Amy, can we talk? - Sure. Doyle uses "Every Breath You Take" for her entrance. He loves the song and has used it at both of his weddings.
Haven't you read the list of necessities? - What's that? The list was for your parents. - My parents don't speak German. So why didn't you read it?
I received larger bouquets. And these come with bows. These don't stand up to comparison. Music. How can it be avoided?
Yes, but I thought I had it backwards. Our vacation from the beast was too good to be true. - Where did you get the cane? - I showed my good will. Surely someone needs it more than me.
You may not know, but animal abuse is a crime. Is that so funny? They can press charges and get you fired! And yet you need the job, Santiago. I need it.
- But yes. This is our primordiality. Then we have undergone evolution. Don't you remember anymore why you fell in love with him? - Give me the mustard! - I use it!
- But yes. This is our primordiality. Then we have undergone evolution. Don't you remember anymore why you fell in love with him? - Give me the mustard! - I use it!
This is a new era, Mr. Vedder said. The hotel just needs to be transported by train or ship and assembled. Do you hear me? This is a good offer. Please do not reject it.
Fuji. Melon roll. Thank you. Is it a real weapon? Why didn't you use it then?
Maybe we should take a deep breath. We have these people in hand. We can find them on the spot. Well, or they'll see the cops running around flying helicopters over their heads and run for cover. No, when you hunt wounded game, you don't start chasing them right away.
What are you doing? I saw it. Detonator. The partially disarmed directional mine you gave me 10 years ago. I'm going to use it to put a hole in that damned door so I can get out of here.
In vain. We sent a sweeper here a few months ago. The raccoons chewed it up. Councilman Dexhart represents this part and ten years ago, when he ran for office, he promised to clean it up. Instead, he came up with several names for it:
It's a dislocation! I invented dislocations myself! And migraines - that's me too! - Give morphine. - We do not give it just like that.
- Fantastic. Here you have an elegant card. A beautiful doll. Here you go. - I don't need it.
What a marvel! What do you have there? Please, how beautiful! Your skin looks soft. Like a peach or a piglet's belly. I dream to touch it and inhale the smell of your hair.
It's about the guy who lived in my apartment before me.... Rudy Walters? Do you have his mailing address? No, fortunately, or I would have had to send him his deposit. Didn't he try to get it back?
She downloaded it from a site for "active parents." That's what they call themselves. They get together and talk about how great they are. I opened it once, but it made me feel bad. Everyone else uses it, which makes them more focused, and the more focused they are, the faster their dreams come true.
And one more thing. I'm tired of being robbed of my joy, it's also a thing of the past. My joy does not flow from my friends. It doesn't depend on my work. I don't even owe it to my husband.
Three themes emerged. Strange, earnest and disgusting. You guys want to stick with it. In marketing, we call it "good Belushi." If I had a magic wand, I would use it to make Greendale never grow up.
He was sweeping the floors, remember? A boy named Michael once stole a card. Could it have been this one? He said he found it. But he didn't give it back.
I looked like a fool, but I did what she wished. I don't think anyone believed me, but I persisted. This skill eventually came in handy for you. And do you even know how she got the card? As I think about it today, she probably stole it or someone gave it to her.
Let him eat another one. He's all grown up. - Thank you, Charlotte. - You're welcome. - The pizza was disgusting. - That's quite a lot of it you ate.
- No, sir. I don't want to work with him. Our first task was to provide protection and create an environment for our team. Overnight, we formed an oil company based in Gujarat. And we gave it 15 years of history.
I'm sorry, sorry. Thank you. He liked soccer, didn't he? Yes. I don't watch it, but it seems that Southampton was recently promoted?
Please open. I suffer from a certain affliction. I can't leave the house, have contact with the outside world. And you could have stolen your neighbor's newspaper. I didn't steal it.
- Thank you. - Super. - Well, cheers. They're not here, so they won't laugh at us. - We have full freedom. - I was thinking about music. I like to listen to it, but nothing good has ever come out of it. - Maybe poetry?
Supplies are becoming larger and more frequent, - and now specialty weapons are being added. Including special packages for converting semi-automatics into automatics. OK, it took a lot of observation, time and hard work, but we have a search warrant for Kozik's store and arrest warrants for him and his buddies. Today's delivery will be around 10:00 a.m. We're looking out for it and will seize everything the moment it arrives.
I am past my deadline and will not participate in editing the newspaper until November. And I write ten times better than others. Maybe, but you still have to learn how to be a reporter. Because there is still a big story here, Rusty, - and you haven't even noticed it.
Maybe, but you still have to learn how to be a reporter. Because there's still a big story here, Rusty, - and you didn't even notice it. - I noticed the story, Buzz. I just wasn't allowed to tell it.
- What else do you think she lied about? - The electric method of ignition... is G.P. All the fires were started in the same way, in both cities.... container and flare. The madman knows the method. He does not change it.
The past never dies. But it's over between us. From now on we will be strangers to each other. You are a stranger to yourself. The truth is thrown in your face, and you can't see it.
You have the same interest in finding a cure as I do. Help me, and I may be able to help you with what I find out. I will work as fast as I can and you will be able to bury her in a few days. Won't you cut her face? I will protect her with my own life.
I hope you are having as much fun as your wife. Or have you forgotten her existence? A dangerous mistake. Abandoned wives begin to wander. If you want to keep our favor, you should pay attention to her.
I'm glad you caught Jason's murderer. He was a good guy. And a girl. You can show me your gratitude by sharing your earnings with me once you've sold that bottle. What if I don't want to sell it?
Because you're wearing a fucking sweatshirt. - Dad. - No... She needs to hear this. You took advantage of this disease and used it for your cynical reasons.
Hey, Johnny. Shopping in the kitchen. Johnny, will you watch your brother so he doesn't go outside? Hi. Bill, I... The suitcase has snapped. I can't open it.
We will lose the war. You have crossed the line. Mom. Their blood is on your hands and even if we win.... I'm afraid you won't be able to wash it off for a long time.
Prove that they are not. /Didn't they give you any warning? /Did they ever issue you a notice? /What about Peter's adoption? /They won't grant it if you're unemployed.
- Michelle! How good to see you. How are you doing? How's school? You don't have my bracelet. You know what, I had to use it.
- Give a watch. - What to stop! - Jane, cyanide poisoning blocks the respiratory process at the cellular level. Nothing like that happened, and this thing irritates my eyes, as well as the previous four times you used it.
Okay, you can leave. So, why did you leave Evona? She had to face the music once and for all. Eros broke her heart. And instead of coming to terms with it years ago, I helped her close it.
Some favor. Are you all right? I talked to Meatball and he told me about the job offer in Nashville. I didn't need it. I didn't accept it.
This dance was a departure! I love sports. Today you will take my virginity. Good. The crown of the King of the Ball was so tacky that I almost don't wear it anymore.
If McPhee found it, why did he hide it? Why not attribute the glory to himself? You said that he was caught up in illness, that he lost his family. Perhaps McPhee believed that he had angered God by removing the holy relic from its proper place. He could not return it to Hagia Sophia.
When did I ask for a pinch of snuff? - Just a second ago. - Well. Don't bother. I don't need it right now.
- I am not Monica. I didn't cut my wrists over Thanksgiving dinner. - I took a ride. - You kidnapped a child. I took him ... For a ride. For a long one, I admit, and I didn't plan it in advance. However, I did not hurt the child.
I'll catch you later," he said. "You'll get away without paying, it will put a strain on our pocket." Hey. Emery, bring onions. I need it for dinner.
No, no... Loretto... May I call you that? Yes, but my name is Lorraine. Lorraine, I have so much love inside me.... and I don't want to waste it on my husband anymore.
So. Now that you're out of my system, let's have a coffee so we can talk about your big TV debut. Hi. I didn't know what the traditional gifts were for accusing your boyfriend of murder, so I came with a plant. Don't kill it.
Even though you've already been there? Stanton! We have an urgent message for Miss Robson. Will you carry it? I don't have it!
- How did he die? - From a lethal dose of morphine. It makes sense. All wrestlers drink it. He didn't drink it.
From the back of the chair you were sitting on. That was tricky on your part, detective. It's obvious that my prints will be on the syringe. It belongs to me. I use it to inject morphine.
- Can't you bring him back more? - Not with the sealed slots. So we need to find the cache that William had here. William had a cache here? Mara looked for it, but without success.
- "Trouble?" I don't remember the name, but I remember my mother coming home with someone else's jewelry. Dad said that this power is hereditary. - What if I have it? - Pray that you don't have it.
I don't remember the name, but I remember my mother coming home with someone else's jewelry. Dad said that this power is hereditary. - What if I have it? - Pray that you don't have it. I want to use it, Duke.
/Aubry Taylor's Finding. This gun was used to kill Matt Skokie. - Did Carter have the gun with him when he returned? Sure or did he? /Aubry Taylor: That's the gun. /Aubry Taylor: But it wasn't Carter who used it.
- You want confrontation. - We want a fair inspection. - What do we want? - Justice! - When do we want it?
- Yes. Now come quickly. I'm thirsty. Give me some water. Didn't I give it to you on the Gardu motorcycle?
I don't want to spoil it between us. - You want to keep the job, right? - No. Not if you want it. Are you saying you want it if I don't want it? No, I don't want it if.... Let's do it like this... On the count of three we say whether we want it or not, okay?
Her ex is back in town. He is a bouncer. But if she sees me wearing a mask, she'll take me seriously. Have you been snooping in my apartment? I need her.
Soldiers who came to my camp in Okinawa. The ones I killed. They came to surrender. I didn't realize this until it was too late. I buried the flag so no one would see it.
Minos will never take his eyes off us. I know a way. How? During the evening ceremony. I plan to use it to escape.
- Five. - It seems longer. We've been through a lot, and I would argue that we've worked together wonderfully. Isn't that right, honey? If you're talking about the bedroom, then yes. Thank God this body is made for sex, because that's all he cares about.
In Paris into a library. In Italy into a café. It's as if the target is trying to make its design look completely random. But such is not the case. He's all about the victims.
Johann Dippel. He hated surgeons as much as I did. He tried to comprehend life, and so I studied under him. Births, pregnancies, generations. When I put an end to this unfortunate girl's child, I was collecting material for my work. The substance that brought you back from the grave came from her fetus and thousands like it.
/Previously in "Sleepy Hollow." Because of my work, my wife left me. And then my little one was hit by a car. Who is this divine plan supposed to serve? Me or him?
Was it the first room? The first room was there, 6 by 6, you know. Wow! Wait. I want to take a look at it.
Tessa, is that you? It's dark in here. I'm not in the mood for light. I was on a date with Ryan. It was my idea, but I didn't like it, and he liked it a lot. He was annoyed because I didn't feel the way he did.
It looks appetizing. Don't forget to add the eye of newt. Because it's green? Here's a funny story. When we started dating Tom, he wanted a red cake for his birthday. I only had green food coloring, but he liked it. So it became a tradition that we've kept up for twenty-five years.
And he wanted to smoke with us. DRINK THE SMOKE NOW When we went out for walks with him, Nim was one of us, when we smoked a joint, he smoked with us, in a circle, we gave to him, he passed on.
Maybe the president knows something we don't. For example, how to win elections. Earlier you made a valid point. Can you inform the prime minister that I am trying to contact him? This country has become too attached to what it thinks it deserves.
In fact, it doesn't really matter what I do to this pile of sand, if I mix it up and spin it around, it still won't change its shape or structure. So, in the language of entropy, this pile of sand has high entropy, because there are very many ways in which I can change its components, but it still won't change. Now let me create some order in the universe. Zooming in, there are just as many grains of sand as there are in this sand castle in a pile of sand. But now, basically whatever I do to him, it will destroy him, and remove the beautiful order of this structure.
Arm your heart with patience, the same patience I learned to survive. Apparently he wears a mask because syphilis made him a monster. - Have you seen him? Apparently, he once pierced ten people with a sword and then lifted them up. That's him, pay up. This is a letter to Caesar Borgia, I'll give it only to him.
Everything better be right! - Here you go. - Check? Did you agree to the fucking check? Have you looked at it, Richard?
Cool, right? I think your husband is here. What, go and buy him a drink. What kind of drink? A Coke on the rocks? Then ask Louise and Madeline to buy you one and then bring it to him.
Whoa! Hey, you can't do that. Last time I checked, we still had a document called the Constitution. The devil doesn't follow any legal cock-a-hoop. To him complain.
I couldn't. -It's not a problem. That you don't mind, man. Well... it's a bit unexpected. It's Dennis's house, so if he's okay with it.... then I guess I don't either.
/The one I want is missing. Any problem Mr. Shepps? /McGath was furious when I took command of his supply tug, If the SeaQuest was out there somewhere, a slow long-haul tug was my best chance of finding it. /Besides, things were heading in such a direction that I had to be worth the money. /The Macronesian Alliance, formally New Australia... / built this fighter and thousands more like it.
Let's go! We have to go back for the doctor, he is bleeding heavily! I know I will love this country. How beautiful these mountains are. Do you think he will like it too?
Look at us. We're like living out of a horror movie! Earthy complexion, bitterness.... loneliness... And they gush with humor.... I prefer our daughter to this weird kid. - In fact, she is not our daughter!
Which makes all maps "maps that no one can read." Well, if you can't read it, then you don't need it or me. Let me start again. Show me the map. I can't. She doesn't exist yet.
We need to fire up another one. There are two more left. I dropped one. Take the flashlight. Where is it?
Thank you. This is the best camping spot in the area and no one knows about it. - Then how did you know? - I just know certain things. I commune with nature, and it shows me the right way.
Once a closed door meant something. Forgive me. Since we've known each other, I haven't seen you like this. Your position provides you with power. But it is both a blessing and a curse.
This camera does not require wires. It transmits this image via satellite. This morning I set up this camera. I attached it to a tree, close to the sands, without any permission. In fact, no one knows that it is there.
Bland. I died and then came to life. I should be able to cast a damn spell. You don't summon magic. It is she who comes to you.
Tracking all Israelis. A technical glitch. Therefore? There is a traveling circus in Russia. One of the attractions is a squirrel running in a reel. The squirrel thinks she's the one spinning it, but if she stops running, her feet get caught in the wires and she breaks her paws.
Excuse me! - What is it? - Where is your list? - What - You had a list of members at the entrance. - Where is it?
No, no. No one will tell Ali anything about it. Did you see the book with your own eyes? Yes, Emily and Hanna called for me when they found it. Where is she now?
We seized the opportunity. And our creative output was unveiled. Are you ready for the next level? Yes! All thanks to synergy, as it provides us with low-hanging fruit.
But the same blood flows in your veins. Angelic blood. Please, show me what you can do. Don't be shy. We are still learning how it works.
It will establish its own mines, colonize the Belt and transform the Solar System. My drive was to enable us to break away from the Earth's leash. To build Mars on our own account. That's what's both beautiful and terrifying about technology. It changes everything.
You are a good and pious man, Judge Hathorne. I am. Surely love is where we find it. And we have found it. Or it is she who found us.
You think it's part of you, but it doesn't have to be that way. Do you know why you were so easily defeated? - You don't. - Your rage blinds you. You want to control her, but she controls you. Since that night.
Actually, he is something of a medium. He told me where to find you. That work term I told you about? You help me with it. You put a gimbal on the text. And it reveals a secret message.
The worst possible place to bring a desiccant. Yes exactly, the worst. I mean, here it is.... here theoretically.... magic flows in the walls. Do you see? Okay uh, she's not theoretically in the walls.
Boy, look at the road. Sure. Anything else, Cass? Benjamin is always very careful. A long time ago he found a very strongly pious vessel in Madrid, her faith, she.... she gave him everything - her trust, her body.
Max, listen to me. Hey, hey. Did I have to do that? This deal was not with her. She was with the demon.
Alright, if you're so smart, how do we get out of here? The only way out is a hand console. Can that even work? Oh yes. But unfortunately it is outside the bunker, where we can't get to it.
What an unstable guy. He was not fit to be a caregiver. He was a wonderful, caring man. We will prove that this viper is harmless. How do you want to prove it if you don't know where it is?
I have to ask... When you got there and realized it was beyond you, why didn't you just go home? We were too ashamed of failure. Especially when people started laughing at us, like when we tried to build a school out of clay blocks. We put up one wall, and it immediately collapsed.
I'm on my way. I'm on my way out. But I need that bag. Otherwise I will die. Where is it?
As I understand it, you are fighting a kind of crusade? I wouldn't call it that way. It is more like working for a divine cause. You are traveling around the country collecting signatures for a petition. - That's right. - What does it concern?
- How much trouble are you in? - I'll find out in the evening. Where are you going to go? I surrendered to this disease when I noticed the first symptoms. I knew it would kill me. Or I would kill myself before she finished me off.
I know, but how do you expect me to react? I can't do it now. Oh my god. I remember when you couldn't sleep without that doll. - She was yours, and then you cut her hair and gave her to me.
Don't you think you could wait a bit? No. Why don't you wait? And you will listen? One of the most wonderful things about this world is that when you get a chance, it won't come when you want it, and it will never happen again!
It would be wonderful. It would be great. Yes? Yes, I love that song. It's just that she is Juliette, I don't know if I can sing it.
Hello, Brad. Our son. He is killing his beautiful spirit. With all the cruelty. When I heard this song, I felt that she must be mine.
Brown hair and eyes. Slim. Remember the mysterious woman from the subway platform? Broussard's accomplice who helped him kill the host. I know who she is.
It has a not inconsiderable influence on many spheres of life. So I will have to judge my neighbors. Of course. Here's the knot. Be aware that if you reject this position.... it will be offered to someone else....
Ok. in that case I will send you the details. Until later. gentlemen, I've only been in the game one day, and I already have a place on the court to watch the Warriors. But you don't like basketball. Sitting in the house with you scrawny guys with Hendricks, who is getting improbably smaller by the day, and Jared cockney knows who may have dampened my conventional masculinity but yet it's always there somewhere.
He is the most important man in Hydra. You don't understand, Aida. Madame Hydra has let all the forces go, no army can defend him. Does it have anything to do with the machine he was working on? She will kill everyone Fitz cares about.
Maybe I will experience it now? And please, destroy this body. It was constructed to kill. The head you cut off from me controls several more machines like this one. And you don't know where she is.
Exactly. I don't want my partner to wait. Of course. I wanted to give you something. This is a thank you for your honesty. It was invaluable.
I'm going to war with Krakow and Guangdong, and I have to stand firm. I want to crush this huckster. This glass... Is not a barrier. It's an asset. She makes you good.
My salary is very good. Yes, officially. Everything is written down, as it should be. But you have to go to a higher level. Each of us has cash stashed away. Sometimes it is the one that decides.
I can't leave him. That sounds like a broken promise. I thought he stabbed you or worse. Klaus had a moment of mercy. But she won't last long.
You hide in the body of a vampire because you are not that strong at all. You were always determined. That's what I liked most about you. And I know very well that you liked my power. She is still here.
The bullet went right through. Nothing serious. - How did it happen? - Calmly. We need to wash our hands of this. Immediately, before they tie us to it. The blood can't be washed off. She leaves stains. That's why we have to move forward.
A tremendous force. Which wears a human face. Listening. Be careful. She... carries a... human... face.
I smell blood. Lots of blood. You let it out, didn't you? No. She did. It's when it bites you, does it....
- It's kind of sad. - No. Not necessarily. It's just like with the soul. No one can be sure that it exists.
Are you at home? Here you are. Captain Morgan? And we were supposed to switch to water. She would not give me the necessary courage.
I've heard it all. Why are these rakes so calming? I began to understand the concept of momentum. Which my book does not have. Everyone likes it.
He will be fine. How did he take it, Elizabeth? So did I--it's annoying. For me, too. If they manage to create some super wheat, think what would happen if it fell into Our hands.
I'm a little hungry. Thanks for asking. Where's your wedding ring? It fell... off my finger in the water. I had to choose, her or me....
- I think he will divorce me. Why do you think that? I think he has a woman in Paris. And I know he has had them before, but.... this time is different. Do you know who she is?
I can handle it, just like I gave with you. I broke your curse that you gave Regina. The one that started it all. Here's the thing, Miss Swan. The dark curse. She, and all the darkness you were dealing with, were the product of one twisted soul.... The Black Fairy.
The purpose of business is to generate profits, clearly? So if the company gained an extra 10 million, it would be okay if, say, one person lost out on it? Theoretically. According to your work, companies are supposed to risk human lives to make profits. I question the validity of this theory, and you claim that it is legitimate.
None of us can do it without the right codes. I hadn't thought of that. And another problem, I'm afraid. I learned that Thrawn is close to locating your base. - I need you to tell me where it is.
People who disagreed with and were troubled by this extraordinary secrecy experienced tragic consequences. He spoke of. being liquidated. I asked: "What do you mean?" He replied: "Yes, you will be liquidated." If you tell anyone who is not in this room about this project, this bullet has your name on it and it will reach you.
A real lost century. Great progress was made in the 1920s, when Nikola Tesla developed power generation technologies that could power the Earth by drawing free energy from the so-called "empty space" around us. The so-called "empty space" is not empty at all. In fact, it is full of energy. Comparatively speaking, it is not, for example, a calm lake, but more like foam at the foot of a waterfall.
I realized that we need to think and act differently than before. It's not about who lives in the White House, it's about who owns it. The presidency is not the highest level for a politician? There is no real power here. She is elsewhere.
You were the one who made my wish come true. But it didn't work. The Evil Queen took the song away from us. No one can do that. She is still inside you.
I hope they look good, because I feel terrible. We are here on business. One drink. Only from the top shelf. Never drink to the end. Are you going to wear the dress, or should she wear you?
Sam Farage had surgery today. He is recovering. I saw three people die. I ended up with the fire department. I know that if there is a way back from where you are now it leads through this place.
If the president wants qualified candidates for his new intelligence agency, we need to run a good selection. Remember how you risked your lives to plunge the president? The country has changed and so have we. /Roarke's presidency has barely begun, and he has already recorded a huge success. /New Mexico became the 34th state to petition Congress for a Constitutional Convention, which means it will come to pass.
Cameron. Hey, did you come here to support me or to make me feel not so brave? To keep you interested, you have to win the match. - Why? - We have a suspicion that Jake encoded the message, and it's hidden in the last level of War Zone, but we can only get to it for the next 45 minutes, then we straighten the satellite.
- Jake needs your help. - So do you need my help? No, Jake. He's waiting for us to finish this game. He left us a message, I think it will lead us to the murderer.
Farraday, 1963 The original publisher is a different company from the one Mr. Keating mentioned, Turnleaf Books. And this book is not just a how-to. In fact, it is considered the bible of magicians.
When you return from hell. As a demon. A peacemaker! I know this weapon. She killed you.
And today, Darius Tanz shows up at my door, doing exactly the same thing. What are the conclusions? There must be something special about this rock. Something worth showing up here after all these years. What if I told you that it means a lot to me?
I think you're starting to forget that. Don't freak out, Eric. It's not funny. You're sick, Holly. You're feeding this disease, and it's eating you up.
Why am I here? Won't you ask what I want? What do you want? Many things. I want my husband to survive this stupid war. But death is part of life and it awaits each of us.
I am a man of progress! The world is moving forward, everyone is equal. Even men and women! This is an appeal to you too, Victoria. Even you, loco, have the right to equality, although you don't know what it is.
Isaacs named the computer the Red Queen. Then, 10 years ago, an epidemic broke out in Raccoon City. The T-virus escaped from the underground laboratory of the Hive, and the American government tried to control the epidemic by detonating a bomb. It destroyed Raccoon City.
I'm not sure if you can see the electrical discharges. From: Wayne, Bruce Rich boys can share. I cracked Luthor's disk and found your photograph. But it doesn't belong to you.
I asked my girlfriend to buy me a book by Warren Farrell, "The Myth of Male Power," as a gift, under Christmas or for my birthday. She did, and it changed my whole life. His premise was that when women are seen as sex objects, men are seen as objects of success. That played into my mind. He wrote a book that questioned our notion of power, who has power and where it is, it questioned the roles of men, but not in the way feminists have always questioned gender roles.
Bixby didn't fit in as well as I did. I wanted to tell him that last night. He was better than them. No one chooses. The farther we run from our own nature, the sooner it catches up with us.
Damn. Tracy! What the fuck was that? ! Hey, man, why do you think the tape was cut like that? You do everything right, all the shitty video editing, and it breaks right away?
Nico, why did you take my phone without asking? It's not allowed! Well, okay. The clitoris is such a funny thing that girls have. Where is it?
At 24 years old. But he didn't seem to follow his family. Your entire family graduated from law school, and Alex chose philosophy at Dartmouth? What do you mean? One of my agents came across a paper written by Alex, it was published, it talks about the corruption in the government, the banking system and their bad influence on the community.
At first it was hard, because I missed my mother. But then I gained in Mohave.... I had an Indian sister and. I'm sorry, but this dress doesn't fit me. But the dress is part of the story, it defines it....
Don't come any closer. It's not likely to be safe. - I think I'm standing on one. - I'm standing on a mine. Usually when you step on a mine, it explodes right away. But we think Korsak stepped on the edge, it slipped out and that's how he saw it.
They called. Did you talk to them? I said I would get back to you when I remembered everything. I was going to call you anyway. I sold the property on South Vermont, and even though it fell to me in the divorce, it occurred to me to cede the profit to you because it was your project.
After all, they know me. They wondered how Nicole's blood wandered into your car. How do I know? It's the work of the police or the Colombians. But she was everywhere.
O.J. Simpson should be acquitted. They let the case down to a man who said he wanted to see all the niggers murdered. This is genocide. This man talks like Adolf Hitler. Since this man can't be trusted and the nation can't be trusted, so why be surprised that at a key moment in this trial, when they asked O.J. to try on a glove, it didn't fit because it wasn't his.
My father used to say that true friends are made on the battlefield. The Boltons were defeated. The war was over. And winter has arrived. According to the maesters, it will be the coldest in a thousand years.
They were exposed to you. They had more to lose than you and fewer resources to protect themselves than you. Until recently, I thought I was like that too, but now.... Now I'm not so sure anymore. It's natural for new people in power to assume that it has no limits.
Bitches want everything for free. - Hi, Starr. - Deirdre. It is necessary to devour. - Don't you have a scarf? - Fuck, where is it?
- Yes. Because being courageous is really hard. You know what gives me courage? My badge. - Really? - Yes. I'll give it to you, and it will give you courage.
When I will see with my eyes. What on earth is that? It's music, stupid. I'll know music when I see it. But what is it doing in the letter?
I understand why you're here and I understand why it's bothering you. But they don't understand. In the interest of ending this as soon as possible, perhaps it would be better if our roles were clearly defined. To avoid unnecessary and embarrassing insinuations. When someone buries a carcass, they expect it to stay underground.
Does anyone have anything to say? If you're not strong enough to do the right thing, I'll do it for you. What the hell is that? - Weight. - Why do you need it?
- He is fine. He dies ... In our house. - I am so sorry. - He asked for a favor. - It will be risky.
And soon news will reach Nassau, whether Rackham and the forts are on their way to Havana. And if not, if we were right and something happened and Hornigold's cavalry didn't stop it in time, then there will be a war with Spain on top of all this. If we were right and something happened to the governor's caravan, I'm afraid something even more disturbing awaits us. What is that? We will be immune to the disease, for it only attacks strangers.
He reportedly had an affair with a woman with whom he is very much in love.... But he hesitated to leave his wife. However, he is so in love with the other person that he has decided to leave Karen And plans to marry this woman. He suffers a lot Because he likes and respects his wife, but he can't live without the other woman. I did not have the courage to ask if she is a movie star!
Don't you feel weak? - Not a bit. There is nothing stronger than unrequited love. It doesn't change anything. She is mine and mine alone.
-Right, Mylene? -Right. Because Mylene Cruz will be the world's first Puerto Rican Pentecostal disco star. You know that beautiful song, "Set Me Free" ? Doesn't it say that the man who claims to have found the light but hates his brother is still in darkness?
It depends on Prairie. I don't tend to push. The thing is, Prairie, sometimes it helps people come to their senses. Storytelling cleanses. I also want to make sure that you are in control of your story and it is good for you.
They always talk about us stealing when they know they were the first to do it. They came to Africa and caught us out like horses. Do you think she really saw one of them here? You three, go get the rest of the waxed paper at the warehouse. Where is she?
Take it. Into the box, pack it up, do whatever the fuck it takes. Let's go, please, immediately. Do you mean this one? Do you know that she costs 2800?
But I assume that's not why we do it, so that it should be easy. We do it compelled to build a safe world for those we love. And also because of the joy of giving a happy and healthy life. I look forward to the next correspondence from you. It means a great deal to me.
And why is that? Because there is still a particle in you that remembers that music can be magical. You are right. I am not able to kill your passion. It will live on until at least the third grade, when you get Mrs. Ortner.
There were your prints on the door. And they weren't there when we secured the house earlier. I gave her the bracelet. I didn't want it to be lost. And where is she, if that's true?
In previous episodes of Penny Dreadful... Do you believe the past can return? She never leaves us.
I would have prayed for him. But I've already lost that. Perhaps that's the crux of everything that keeps me going. I have abandoned my faith. Or it is she who has abandoned me.
It's hard to describe. Can you turn it off? No. Tell me your story. What if it includes murder?
- The map? - A map by Helena Blavatsky, a Russian occultist from the 19th century. She claimed that with it she could track demons. - I don't have it. - But you know where she is.
Now Mr. Hunter can be handed over to the authorities and tried, - which will probably end in execution. - You can't do that! I can and I will. You give me no other choice. I have been looking for your weakness all this time, and it is obvious.
I say this because, despite the problems we face ... We are a tight-knit community. A family. And from this we draw strength. A powerful force. It is not invisible.
That's right. Too late for me to chop off your hand. Because the bracelet is connected to it, right Eve? You are making a mistake. She is not real.
Did you hear any knocking? Or any high-pitched sound? Deny Capcom. Tell them not to disconnect the reverse charge. Tell them not to disconnect the reverse charge. NASA confirms that there is some malfunction in the capsule's heat shields and it may be coming loose.
Memory is dangerous. And the past is very annoying and stressful. Yes, memory can be treacherous. Once you're on the merry-go-round of happiness, with the nostalgic smell all around you, the glowing neon of growing up, all that sentimental cotton candy. But after a while, it takes you somewhere you never wanted to be.
I mean, this is what we signed up for: - to be heroes. - I agree with Jefferson. Yes, of course you both agree, because neither of you understands the pitfalls of changing the timeline. Mixing in the future is indisputably more dangerous than changing the past, because it is constantly changing.
- The light bulb? I invented it. I am Thomas Edison. I invented the light bulb. And what does it do?
- Are you okay? - Sure. I'll see you tonight. I feel like I'm back from hell, but here I am, dragging a piece of metal down the street as if nothing has changed. I once worked with a man who lost his leg in an accident and suffered from phantom pains. His mind had become so accustomed to the fact that the leg was there that it tricked him into thinking it was there, even though it wasn't.
Do you understand? Just don't do it. - I think it was a tragedy. - Really? You can spare your shitty sympathies, I don't care.
Yes, it is definitely not me. She is alive. "Death is a veil, the living call it life." "When they sleep she rises."
Yes, definitely. - That star on your shoulder.... - I deserved it. You will have one too, your whole arm in stars. And what does it mean?
- Good. Look, you said yourself that you don't know all the facts, so maybe you don't need a spell. Maybe you need information, and Margo's discipline is gossip, so.... We have a serious problem. Is it in the box? Professor Sunderland was looking for a book from the Physical Book Collection, but it's missing.
What a tragedy. What will happen to the couch? The couch? With the most expensive one from the store. Did he die on the expensive couch? Does that mean she will be on sale?
Do what you like! I don't care anymore! I used to know soldiers like you. And maybe you used to be a good person. But when you see so much violence, it becomes the only thing you really understand.
No one? Bottom line. If I were a king, I would force you to fight. Not because I was a tyrant who organized fights between children that were strange and unfunny, even with a cobra, but because true love is worth fighting for. It gives purpose to life.
- Nick, we can't wait. Look at his hand. What's going on? I don't know. She is healing.
The calculus really is simple. First, I wanted them to leave here. Before their arrival, everything was going smoothly for me.... But I decided that they caused too much damage, therefore my vengeful side.... Did you know I have one? She wants to punish them.
You have dedicated your whole life to this place. Don't worry, I'll be in the store all the time. Just as a customer. I'll be saying something like, "Hey, can you tell me where the floss is?" Probably not, because I know where it is.
Great, thanks. - What's the usual? - Sure. I love this song. Where is it from?
<So your theory is that someone resurrected a 15th century cult to track down and kill pedophiles. / - This agrees with the pattern. - Not all of it. My partner, Mr. Weston, the man we started down this road with, is many things, but not a pedophile. I have seen his black side, and it has nothing to do with children.
- Jane. - What - where the shotgun? - I don't know. Where is it?
- What - where the shotgun? - I don't know. Where is she? Why do you need it?
It is to take over the leadership position. What will follow after he leaves. - The plan. - Where is he going? What has happened? The message he received... It sounded like it was time to move on. And to find a new leader to replace him.
They are anti-terrorists. The bomb is gone. The rapid response team confirms it. The terrorists seized the bomb. But only high-ranking FBI people knew where it was.
And they told you to back off. - That the DSW is taking care of it. - Yes, how did you know? I worked on another case about a hurricane and a construction company. - And it didn't go before the court either.
Wooden box. Five feet by two by one. It doesn't dawn on me anything. I saw that you got it. Where is it?
- Do you think I'm an idiot? - What are you doing? Listen, I'm from the future, so Deadites are no strangers to me. You can howl when you want, it dangles near my ass. I care about the book and you will tell me where it is. And that's it!
Colonel, maybe before we start you want to talk to Sylvester to catch up a bit? I know it's been a while. Nine years, three months and two days. We have no need to do that. As I said, during the Second World War the Axis countries were looking for an advantage over the Allies, no matter where it would come from.
Will I free myself? Move your foot. I'll step on it instead of you. What are you talking about? You step on her and she doesn't explode?
Put your feet on my footsteps. I won't let you die, don't be afraid. What really happens when you step on such a mine? There's nothing you can do anymore. Unlike in a movie theater, if you step on it, it explodes.
I was embarrassed. Girl, please. How many times have I cried in your bed at 2 a.m. because of school or Nate or whatever? Well, how about I organize a home study night? No one even needs to know it's for you.
That would be an innovation. It's just a killer app. I don't want to predict anything in the next two trillion years. No one will know if I'm wrong. But that's the wonderful thing about the future. We don't know where it is going.
That's what I have Twitter for. Why did McCarthy mention Flynn Carroll? The kidnapping of his wife is an obvious connection. Well, and... he has a scar. - Does he know what it means?
But we are close. Soon we will be one again. Our battles will be over. We just received an urgent message from Bob Brecke, - only it is not from Bob.
What is the bread doing here? Give her a chance. It's the first good thing that happened to her after she lost her money. Not to mention the coffee from the Red Cross. At least listen to her wonderful story. She is not about someone who went through a lot of bad and moved on.
He is dead. He died in my house. His family died in my house, I know that. I can't prove it, but I saw them. and there is this music box and it plays at really strange times.
They said they had to turn it off for a few hours. Motherfuckers. - Where does this pipe go? - They couldn't get out. Warden, where does it go?
A friend dropped her off. I know why you are here. Do what you have to do. - Where is the armored cassette? - What - where is she?
That's right. We killed your friends. And their wives and children. That left you and Grimes. You tell me which one of you took her. Where is she? !
I don't know. I assume he felt I would better understand his troublesome situation. What troublesome situation? Look, Bones, I love you, but such a decision is not yours to make. I know... But doesn't she belong to Parker?
Get out. - Please. - Mr. Jang. After becoming a prosecutor, I developed a daily routine with myself. - Do you know what she looks like?
That's why, sweetie, I don't want people to finish their business. Where's the fun in that? And since I'm trapped here, the rest will be too. Book. Where is she?
Work was the most important thing for you. Yes, but maybe I would have let go if I had to raise a daughter like that. It's easy to tell you that now, because you know who Joy grew up to be. But 30 years ago, would you really have given up your career in favor of diapers, teething and sleepless nights? Hayden had to make a decision, and it may not have been the right one, but don't pretend you don't know why she chose the way she did.
Yes, Gerald, I see. Thank you very much. Gerald, seriously, you have to keep secrets. Give me back my... Where is she?
Your father and I love you and will do everything to keep this family together. And maybe this difficult situation will get easier for us with time. Including Pastor Tim and Alice. What about the tape? I don't know. But if it helps them to know that it lies in some sort of safe, then maybe it's nothing terrible.
- That's why I came to say that I think it's imprudent for Beatrice and Mary to spend time together. Now am I supposed to condemn Mary's friendship with Beatrice? I like Beatrice very much. And their friendship. It makes me happy.
No, the bad cop is made of the 20 grams of meth we found near his body. Meth? Wait a minute. No one here has mentioned drugs. No one will mention it again outside this room until we know with absolute certainty how it connects to the police officer.
I know how difficult it is. My faith was also shaken. But I was wrong. We need magic. She makes the world a better place.
- Mommy says it's educational. A frozen body, was discovered in the crags, melting in Alaska. Wonderful. Now Christine will have nightmares with the ice man. Medical experts have yet to determine who the victim is, but she was found in the same northern part of Alaska where famed billionaire and explorer Henry Charles went missing 15 years ago.
- What. It's such an energy barrier that only lets light and oxygen through. - The best of isolation tools. - Having as many enemies as my wife.... It's not like that. She doesn't protect against outside attacks.
It's such an energy barrier that only allows light and oxygen to pass through. - The best of isolation tools. - Having as many enemies as my wife.... It's not like that. She doesn't protect against outside attacks. She seals things inside. Things like the pathogen from the lab.
Nice to see you. Mottled and more mottled shirts. I'll keep it short. I need to work on a presentation. It is about a chair company, and its working title is:
Finally, a thick layer of mascara. We always apply a lot of mascara. And done. I have a wonderful lipstick. I'll give you, it doesn't suit me.
We are driven by the belief that a better world, or a better version of ourselves, is waiting for us outside the door. I have your confession here, but I wanted to make sure you fully understand the implications. I understand. Not only you will die, but also Mr. Frink and your grandfather, as well as all the factory's employees, and the factory itself will be demolished.
Mr. Coleman, a CT scan of the chest showed a lot of scar tissue from shrapnel wounds. So? It doesn't affect health or heart function. But this scar tissue has created deformities that act like a vocal chamber. It's what amplifies the sound of the heart.
It belonged to your dad, and I think it should be yours. I feel that way. That's nice, Ted, but I was never really attached to her, to be honest. And I know she means a lot to you.
Infections have a terrible habit / of crouching. You feel pretty good, / you think the infection has passed, and then it comes back.... like a bolt from the blue. When your body is still weak / when you've barely recovered....
Previously on The Vampire Diaries.... - I'm Sybil. - We're talking about a living, breathing mermaid. Damon is completely devoted to me. This thing, she was delivered with your crypt dweller.
May I speak with you, agent? Yeah, sure. You can do it. You will do it. Just remember, this power.... She doesn't control you.
- It's a simplification. - Really? I live in the hotel next door. I've seen your residence. Quite a jump from your previous home. - Do you even know who it belonged to?
! Emma, put the gun down. Oh God! Kieran! / - Where is she?
Jim Pine overdosed. Mingan found him. I want Hector to get him. I didn't kill that guinea pig. It was my neighbor's guinea pig and she died. I asked him if I could take it.
Come on. When the officers headed west from the MacArthur causeway, they found a battered man chewing on another man's face. When the officer told him to back off, and he didn't, they started shooting. The new disease affects the brain and is spreading rapidly. It is responsible for a wave of murders across the country.
I just need some water. Your skin is red. Really? Sorry, I'm such an idiot. We have tetracycline, it should handle it.
In a couple of states, they have been accused of providing food with maggots. Corizon Healthcare provides health care in 28 states. They charge multimillion-dollar salaries for doing so. Contractors charge huge bonuses for signing long-term contracts. This creates a disincentive to perform the service properly, because they're going to get paid anyway. One reason why the dialogue about mass incarceration is difficult is that it has been reduced to a profit generator.
And where do you think the book is from? You're just as crass as he is. It wasn't God who wrote it, it was the Devil! You are jealous because you want the book for yourself. I want it to destroy her before she destroys us!
And that hurts, Dr. Bull said. It hurts. I know it hurts. And that's why we're going to prove that it took you 10 years to write this song. And that it came out ... From your soul.
When people become aware of them, they tend to compensate. Have you done one pretend trial and found that the whole world feels that way about female pilots? We did five of them. And it's not a conspiracy. Covert discrimination means you don't know it's occurring.
Why am I the one who has to deal with - with this raptor beast? - Because, despite all my love for birds, they frighten the hell out of me. How will it know where to fly? Reginald was trained to fly with a pulsating collar. He only flies when it pulses, so I will program him an approximate time to get to the garage.
Just like you are doing now. Yes. That's just the way it is. You can't get upset about the past. She has oriented you.
That's out of the question. You know it well. I understand that it is not easy for you, Matheus. After all, she got here on your orders. - Ezequiel... - I don't blame you for César's death, but it must weigh on your conscience.
- What will happen to her? - He will force her to surrender. The union of the demon and the host. They will become one. - Integration. - It will be permanent.
How do we check which one Mac is in? /And I thought my cell was small. /The plan worked. <sort of. /I had a feeling we were going to El Noche's hideout in Mexico, but after all, dead I won't say where it is.
Tell me that Aphrodite will have an involuntary effect on our Bench. Our Bench loves her. See for yourself. Let's leave it to the sextuplets to use all their strength to unite Olympus. But she already has a concretized opinion of our good doctor and it's not so therapeutic.
A nuclear reactor is nothing terrible. Just keep it well cooled and there is no malfunction for a whole year.... No, for 10 to 20 years. Do you understand? Nothing will happen. That's the beauty of nuclear power. It never sleeps.
Find me the nearest taco store. Here's what I found about making taco shells. No, I don't want a taco recipe. Not only does the machine talk to you, you can talk to it. And it supposedly understands you.
- Cool. He will meet with us tomorrow. Just because someone wrote a book.... Since he graduated from the Institute of Technology and worked for the government, it is logical that he wrote a credible book. But that doesn't mean at all that it contains the truth.
- Come on! - Get out. Graveyard soil. There is nothing more powerful when using black magic. What is she good for to Belial?
- Now you are so confident. - It was not to make me immortal. - Kaulder, I came to help. - Chloe, I told you not to do it. Immortality was never yours. She belonged to me.
Chris, you see, this face is not real. Your friend is smart. He has set you up. You watch too many Hollywood movies. When you stand on a landmine, it explodes.
- Calm. It's a sign. We are where we should be. - Give us the Gandhi-talk. - You have so much anger inside you. You have it in your heart chakra and it's fucking toxic.
Dude! Dude! All the batteries are fried. This battery jumped up and almost hit me. - Dude, She hit me.
- Have you written anything yet? - No, this one will be the first. Until now it has remained in the realm of dreams. To help realize others? What will she be about?
- Right. So you've had a difficult time and suddenly you're in the center of what you might call a surreal experience. Tell me about that. How did you feel about it? When you look death straight in the eye and it looks into yours, it's terrifying, even for Brody Walker.
Your mother left because she was sick. You decided she was sick because she was unpredictable. And you were put together and wanted to temper her. And what about her love now? I ask, where is she?
- We are peers, okay? - You have to find Mamie-Claire. - I'm annoyed by this ghost. - The path doesn't oppose you. She is guiding you.
There are many hateful people in the world. They seem to be multiplying at a very fast pace. As a family, all we can do is stick together and stay vigilant. Mouth of Truth. Legend says that if a liar puts his hand inside, it will be bitten off.
I thought love should hurt. I hurt everyone I loved. And I thought that love is greater the greater the suffering someone is able to accept from me. It was when I ended up in prison, an environment devoid of love, when I began to understand what it actually is and what it is not.
I had no choice. I saw and experienced things because I was forced to. Sometimes my son asks me, because it bothers him: "Dad, why this war? Does it have an end?
"What the hell happened to him? "Where is he?" Family is something fun, something unusual. It is something different. She fills you up.
It was a gift. A gift? Wow. Wow. Love is not bad.... But it is not something you build your life around.
Are you kidding me, right? We won't run over her? No, it's a different breed of cow. Is there no other way? Maybe she simply fell here?
Climbing too fast is dangerous. You may not have the right equipment at altitude, and your friends won't help you. Here's to your first professional writing job. I have to admit that I'm excited. So what is it about?
By taking it out in public, I would be breaking the firearms law. And now? Now it's dark. And it's just the two of us. She is like an amulet.
Sir Malcolm will be back tomorrow. So will I. Do you believe that the past can return? Even more. She never leaves us.
It's not too late. Finn wants your blood. He promised to cure me if I give it to him. Do you know where he is? You have to tell me why he needs it.
I love you both. I had a dream last night. You looked so beautiful that I couldn't wake you up. I, who never belonged to anyone, dreamed that I gave you to myself. You are made for this love, and it is made for you.
Why? If you can keep me in your heart ..then why can't I keep this shirt on? You can. Just what do you need it for?
You need to have an honest heart. Your job is to take Munni home. Once you do that, you can tell your father whatever you want. Afridi tries to stand on the line. The ball is in the air again, will it cross the field?
When all other options failed, Bajrangi himself went to find her parents. *In search of you, look* *what happened, oh prophet. * All channels refused to show this story. They say it is meaningless. No one is interested in it.
"Love for a six-year-old mute Pakistani girl who lost her parents in India." "When all other options failed, Bajrangi himself went to find her parents." "All channels refused to show this story. They say it is meaningless." "No one is interested in it."
You benefit, it is not a permitted use. The number of fonts is limited. Does Mr. Hamlin own them all? No, but we have been using a certain font for 12 years. And it, combined with the graphic with the triangle and the blue Hamlindigo identifies our brand.
Laptops, BlackBerrys, PalmPilots, watches. If it buzzes when licked, please leave it. Why? My brother Chuck has a certain sensitivity. It has a medical name.
She came to me. I don't feel very good about it. Even if they let me join the Warblers, I will fight for every sound I make. You will fight this battle everywhere. But here at least it will be fair.
At least half a million. I don't have that kind of money. Your label for a legal liability policy. No, I can't ask you for it. That's what she is for.
No, not everything. That's why I'm writing about Zinberg. Yes. A positive story about medicine. And if it happens to show a Jew who is not a peasant from the Lower East Side ghetto, all the better.
- Yes. Do the police know? - They are the ones who found the child. - The baby? This girl gave me custody of the child and I completely screwed up. I left and she went missing.
The only reason why he answered at all is that he mistakenly thinks you are carrying the Lexicon. Do I have your word that you will not leave the palace tomorrow? Tomorrow? I have arranged a meeting with him on the next full moon. She will in two days.
He kidnapped my sister's child. It's all about custody. No, forgive me, my friend. Kidnapped? You make up a story, it will survive, it will sustain interest.
He was my husband, I loved him, but I couldn't say goodbye to him. But now you have done it. I don't believe it's even possible. Death doesn't allow people to say goodbye. She just... cuts holes in our lives. In our future.
You can see that there is only one buttery muffin. Yes. That's right. And it's already mine. It just so happens that it's for me, because I don't know if you can see, but I'm for two.
I mean her world has just turned upside down and I know it's not your fault. But here's what I thought, maybe together it would be easier for you to get through this. I'm terribly uncomfortable and I have to somehow figure out how to sell my unborn child to pay for Wade's weakness for muffins.... I'm really looking forward to writing my own review. Really? And what will it be about?
No, I just want you to help me practice the job interview. Okay. What is the job? It's a position as an executive trainer for a really big restaurant operating company. It comes with a high salary, health insurance, and a pension plan.
Sometimes I feel like I'm just doing it. What's that supposed to mean? You chose me for a reason. Everything we went through what we sacrificed.... It was love. And she is still there.
What did that mean? You chose me for a reason. Everything we went through what we sacrificed.... it was love. And she is still there. She will not pass.
And you are telling us this only now? What? I was angry. She took my dress! And let's not forget that she is still out there somewhere.
Why aren't they calling us? Why does everyone support this emergency law? If you approve it, I will veto it, but there is no basis to turn this into a cockfight. You know that we have the votes to dismiss your vito. Without your signature, it will still go into effect in 10 days.
I refused. Salazar said he would reveal the truth about me in a week anyway. He said that if I come forward myself, he will confirm that it was my idea. He says we should present a positive story about a Hispanic in the department. The only problem with this positive story is that it will destroy my life.
There are two paths, one trodden, the other not yet. Where you step with your next step will determine the path forward for all of us. We know how kings have passed to solve this problem, but You are different, Lord. You are the king of our future. The question remains, what will it be?
Do what you need to do. Baptize it ... Amen. Behold how life wars with death. Rejoice in this moment. It is given by God.

What is your attitude to small legal problems unrelated to this case? - Free. - We are not pursuing you, Mr. Jones. I know people employed by Stark. They claim he is working on a certain formula. Over a molecular nitroamine. Theoretically, it could cause a shock that would result in an implosion.
/ This is true. That's why we offered / Mrs. Cardenas and her neighbors a considerable sum / as relocation assistance. /Good people should not be absorbed by this city. /I mourn the death of this woman. /It should not have happened.
One missile exploded 50 meters from the school. Your people killed more than a dozen Palestinians in attacks. - Should we not react? - The violence must stop. Otherwise, the peace mission will crumble, and it is the hope for lasting peace in the region.
The virus is not finished with us yet. It will mutate again and again until it consumes even the immune. There is only one way out. And you are the key to it. I will send you to stop the plague before it breaks out.
I was inspired by an article, about therapy through conscious dreams. Think they can be used to help people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder Trauma and stress? Yes and yes. In theory, it will allow people to enter their dreams objectively and face their fears.
Joking? - A follow-up. - Such an underrated one. - Oh no. - Where is she?
More hogwash? And when you went to Rome, the site disappeared. I suspect that this is not a coincidence. Why are you looking for this site? Because some people believe it has great power.

So his answer I need today. The royal seal. Are you convinced that the authentic one? / Monsieur de Francy, was torn from the royal treasury minister's balance sheet book.

Do you want the address? I'm sorry, but I don't know how to get your power back. This is not a tunnel to Powers Landing. The power can't just disappear, Harley. So where the fuck does it disappear to?
No, no, no, no, it's not a bomb, Janice. We really need this. It gives the Powers a reason to stay on duty. It's a bomb, Christian said. And she doesn't discriminate.
He certainly found a way to do it. What happened? This book. There are all the stories in it. She started it all.
Step by step. Now, Lucretia said you have a page, from the Book of Leaves. Yes. Where is it?
Because this party was supposed to help you forget about him. It didn't. The purpose of this party was to have fun, which is what I have, to cut loose, which I think I'm doing a pretty good job of cutting. And to have a good time with friends, which is exactly who Kevin is. Okaj, I like your dress, but it doesn't say much "friends"
It certainly didn't move here by itself. There are some footprints here but they immediately disappear. They disappear. The blood on this rock can't be more than a day old, right? Where did it come from?
- Too bad we can't stay here. Why? You'd better not do that. I assume he found the book. What is it actually about?
/Does God exist? Well, it's actually not really relevant. I think about God in the same way I think about love. If you believe that God exists, then he exists because your faith and actions bring his presence into the world, and the same is true of true love. If you believe in its power and walk through life with respect for its holiness, it will always be there to serve you.

What is there to talk about? The truck pounced on the sign, I bypassed it and off we went. From a big cloud a little rain. It was a truck! Where did it come from?
This one, I will not forget about it. I will take care of it. Ms. Sekratarz, owns more than 100 houses, each built to his specifications. She has a fleet of yaht issued in a special edition. When he feels like eating pizza, it is flown to him from Rome.

It came out funny. You're a laughing stock, laughing stock. What fun! Gina! I know that astronomy overwhelms with science, but I have a colleague who will make it more interesting.
- In the middle of July you took a blanket to the game. - The 18th of the month is no longer the middle. You think I'm a wimp, but that's not true. I'm tough, strong and I love cold water. She is not cold. She is icy cold. Like the Kokytos, the frozen river of hell.
Show up. Show up wherever you are. Quick! Read that stupid book of yours. I'm looking for. And she's not stupid, okay?
Yes, we hold them in our hands. The current doesn't pull the boat out to sea? No, it doesn't pull. And at Cape Horn? The current pulls back a little, but she is still going forward.
Denise's mom knows you're still scared. You need another story. No, this Japanese scary story is called "The Red Coat." It is about a ghost that lurks in women's bathrooms.
Quick! Catherine. Francis... he is dying. I had a vision. A prophecy, she will come true.
I want to stop the horseman and his ally from killing you. Listen, I know you've seen things you can't explain. General Washington trusted you. He said that this revolution is not just a war for the future of this country. It will decide the fate of every man, woman and child.
The girl? when we were at his place last time. Oh my god. who we met some time ago at the station? who she is.
Have you seen them? - I can't say that I saw them. - Can't or won't you say? Where did you get this canteen? It's Maclnnisa's. Then what is she doing here and where is mine?
I wonder what's in store for us this time? The conundrum only deepened when we were given idiotic OHS-style clothes. But soon the curtain fell. Most of the steel used to build modern China comes from this precipitous hole in the ground. And today it will be our racetrack.
We needed to stand out, to turn the hobby into something more. We ended up stating: "We'll call it a personal computer." Experts say that we are not standing at the threshold of a computer revolution. It is already underway.

Thanks to all of you for coming. I really respect your time. So, what do you think of the book? Of Mice and Men, is a classic novel by American Nobel laureate John Steinbeck. It was published in 1937 to wide critical acclaim.
Well I'm going. -You're coming or not? ! I'm going. Let me finish my special tea. Where is she?

And what type is your Carsen, well tell me? It's here! It should be here. The temple should be here. - Where is she?
They were just left... kidnapped. I hope you learn a lesson, and keep your curiosity in check, young lady. Colonel, if she hadn't been tinkering with magic, she would have lacked the imagination to come up with the equations she used with the gas pedal. So it's also our fault. The library only hides magic and tells people it doesn't exist, even though people like Lucy could come to us for answers - and for training.
An allusion to drugs! Seriously, what am I doing here? Didn't anyone tell you? They send a limousine, and I get into it. And she takes me somewhere.
- Chaders! - That's disgusting. Okay, now this... Certainly inappropriate. All right, we took out the can too. Certainly, but they will ask how she got there.
I think I know what I wanted to say to myself. Someone. Not the whole city, but save someone. Come with me. I know where I got this face from, and I know why I need it.
-I can replace him, he distracted me. -He is a friend. Okay, I got it. Level 9, government laboratory. It requires document incineration because the cut paper can be put back together. In other words, we'll enter through the incinerator because it has no security.
You know, as far as I'm concerned, when I start to feel that I'm approaching the limit, I start drooling, deep in my mouth. Have you ever had that happen? And then my veins start itching uncontrollably, and hunger consumes me. Every sound, every smell. The world around me disintegrates and all I can hear is the pulsing of someone else's blood and all I can feel is that it belongs to me.
Criminal Minds 10x21 Mr. Scratch subtitles: lestat835 "Your memory is a monster. It has a will of its own. You think you are its master, but it is yours."
All right, everyone! Gather around! Come on over here. Because Phil, the hero at the moment, has a little surprise for all of us. It involves getting the energy here to a dead end, but I'll tell you all about it.
You chose a terrible moment to break your vow of chastity. - Did you at least go to confession? - I don't feel any remorse. I love him. Can love be bad? She doesn't, but hypocrisy is bad.
He will be better off with Alak. - No. - The son's place is with his father. We have each other, just as we did when we came to this planet, and just as we survived and prospered then. Don't lose faith. I made you a promise then and it still applies.
I am working closely with our quantum computer. Only I don't have a cassette player. Now you have one. Before we start I want to say something. In this lab we face death all the time, but when it strikes someone close to us, it can leave us with many questions.
Already. What did you do, Emilio? What I had to do to protect you and this family. Did you find the book? Where is it?
Fiddleford, get yourself right. These words make no sense. This machine is dangerous. You will bring the end of the world with it. Destroy it before it destroys us all!
- Jason is innocent. - Not for you to decide, but for the gods and their representatives. The priests will pass judgment. I do not refuse vengeance. But it must reach those guilty of this crime.
Did the son of a bitch show us a facsimile? Why did he do that? Now we have to get off the wagon. Do you know what he did? He sent bad karma into the world, and it's now coming back to get him.
It's funny how old the story is. You wanted blood, I wanted bunker. Well, but... since none of us will die.... You have some nerve, coming here. What's not? Since there is a future, I wondered what it holds for me. What kind of person I will be.
The thing is, love is tricky. You can't look for it. Then how do I find it? You won't find her. She will find you.
It's time for you. Immediately! Your book is more important than me? Nothing is more important than you. But she has contributed to great misery in this world.
Hey Sleepyhead. Wake up. Where did you send that truck? Where is it going?
That is, we can start. Where is Can Osgood? You answer me, Clara. Truth or consequences, lie and you will die. Where is she?
...bombing. The UN says it's a full-scale humanitarian crisis as in neighboring Abbudin, government forces launched a campaign to reclaim the city of Ma'an from the Caliphate. The enemy has suffered significant losses, and President Al Fayeed, who is in the midst of mourning, said, "Today we have begun a struggle for freedom, the end of which my grandson will not see, "but it is for all the children and grandchildren of Abbudin."
Prime Minister Cho, it is an honor for me to be here with you, although I would like to meet under more favorable circumstances. I am just returning from a meeting with the world's top scientists. They are all dead. The virus, it got them all. I managed to get a sample, however, it is not in the vial.
Do you think I didn't think about it? I have to live with it for the rest of my life. Do you want to know the craziest thing about it all? That night changed me. She changed me, Jules.
That's why you pushed William away. No, it was his cry that pointed them to our hiding place. - It was because of him that they died. - Is that so? The war was the best thing that happened to you. It's what made you what you were destined to become.
Noma, you will fall. You won't. I can fly. You can't! It's because of the darkness. She is deceiving you.
This was supposed to be the final event, but no, you changed sides and started a war, but I was the one to blame. All the angels sided with me, but you, my brother. You left me when I needed you the most. You divided our family. No, she was already divided.... By another ... Who chose humanity, long before I did.
Why wood? Is it even possible to get it wet? - Oh boy! - His real hand. - Okay, she just moved.
You were late. I think you meant to say thank you. Thank you, Mr. McNally, for violating the privacy of a US citizen. Nice beard. Thanks, I would have told you why I needed it, but I would have had to kill you later.
"Badge." Now it's just "Badge"? The screenwriters are terribly nervous, tense all the time, they're crazy, they don't hate each other, they keep calling after whole days and nights, they want to read you their writings on the phone. But she never mentioned threats of violence. - Can we see your wife's old client list? - Do you know where she is?
They think I don't deserve better treatment. You are still a man. And the woman who has earned my respect believes in you. Merci. This rose was given to me by someone dear to me. She reminds me of the road not taken.
Piper called me. He said he got my number. He asked if I wanted to make a few hundred bucks by helping him move some stuff. To where? Some to the warehouse and the rest to his boat. - Where is she?
- This one originated in Sumer. - Is it somehow related to the prophecy? The one according to which we will destroy the world? I don't know if I buy this slip of the tongue. /It may be a misleading message, but what does it have to do with unleashing evil in Sleepy Hollow?
We always have our guy inside. And sometimes even a woman. Conversations in bed are always more interesting than what people gossip in front of everyone. We have to admit that you successfully hid your second nature from her. And that's all we were interested in. So. How do you like her?
Dean will advise something. - God help us. - I wouldn't count on it. It's okay now. - Where is she?
Wait. Does this bottle say, "default alternate"? No. No. It says, "Damon's good stuff.
Walter trusts him and we don't have much choice. You take the drugs, we get you out of here, we rescue the judges - easy. I'm not convinced about the part about saving the judges. I remembered the instruction, but it lacked the legend. It is the key to the cipher pattern.
Now I am free. You will never again stop me from getting what I want. However you made a deal with Gold so you could get revenge - it's not worth it. Darkness is using you. It doesn't care what you want, but what it wants.
You could use a dentist. Hands. I won't ask again. Where is the gun? Where is she?
I want all suspects in that area to be questioned, regardless of their criminal records. Commissioner. So? The good news... The reporter was wearing a bulletproof vest. She leveled two shots.

I need help, Dr. Hudson. I'll take the black one without sugar. This is the man on the table, Leanne. You... are you ready to speak yet? The cold infusion theory is what she created as a temporary suspension of animation through hypothermia buying the patient, in theory, the hours it will take for surgery to repair the artery.
After everything we've been through and seen.... We won't let... A pressure point, a soft tissue.... A disease, an antidote to greatness. You think you'll be better off without people who rely on you, but you're wrong, because you'll undoubtedly need them, making you weak and vulnerable. Family does not make you complete, it destroys you.
I didn't give a gift to the lovely bride and groom. Probably most of you know that I was in rehab, so I didn't have much time to shop. Instead, I thought I'd sing a song to commemorate this beautiful evening. It's an old song, but I tell you, amazing. No one really knows what it's about, but for me, it's about family.
These have been tough days for Sergeant Colborn. But... any pain ... any burden he carries.... pales in comparison to what the state of Wisconsin and the people who work for it have done to Steven Avery and his family. And now Steven Avery needs Jerry Buting and Dean Strang, and all those who believe in him. We believe in him. We are willing to do the hard things to advance his cause, and he has said repeatedly, since November 2005, that someone must have planted his blood if she is in that car.
Blood and guts. And that weird alien will come out and bite your head off! Stop it! Pregnancy is a sacred thing! She can hear you!
- Jay, let's go! First up, Robby and Tess! Why didn't you delete the video before you gave out those iPads? I had great playlists, they were the gift, not the iPad. When I update the library, it syncs with their iPads.

People have to deal with their own damn problems. because paying you to listen to me is no solution then what is? I have to deal with it myself. Thank you. Zoe, you can't run away from the past. because sooner or later it will catch up with you.
That's why I'll ask again... Who among you did it? What if it's none of us? What if she is the one acting as a catalyst? A guide? She needs to go to the hospital. - Try to control your hysteria Kristina, she's beside herself....
Many people believed that something was living in these woods. I didn't want to sow panic without being sure, but that something attacked my house today. A few weeks ago, some 140 kilometers from here, logging began. We believe that it is due to her that the beast is looking for a new home. The animals have escaped, and she is looking for food.
- Say with whom! It's about time. Okay, you've won. I will give you the money. - Where is it?
He said it is the place where everything goes towards life, and everything goes towards death. A place of wonder. A place of fear. My father said that everyone has her own wilderness. She lives within ourselves.

We drink the wine. Then he leans over to me and starts pouring wine on my head. I look down and see that I'm a baby and he's bathing me. The water was kind of weird, too. I put my hand in it, and it was covered in blood.

Because religion is like... It's like a virus of the mind, Which parents passed on to their children, Slowly creeps into our lives When we're weak Or sick or helpless. So religion is like a disease? Yes. Yes, it infects everything.

The fishing rod doesn't work. - Ask your grandfather. - No. - Yes. - Grandpa, I don't know if she works.
All human governments have caused suffering. None has succeeded in eradicating war, crime, injustice or disease. God is here and will soon put an end to our suffering. Some may consider death an injustice. But Jehovah tells us that it is not unjust.
Court lawyers never take appeals. That's what we have an appellate section full of haunted wise men sitting in academic quackery for. I know this case. No one manages to fathom this case to such an extent. She is loaded, you know that.
And why waste your talent, on drunk drivers or disputed speeding fines. What you did, you did out of passion. We need more of that here, not less. Tracey will forward the case to you. Make sure she gets to court.
So what are we looking for? Tetrahedron. A three-sided pyramid, this is the symbol of the hieroglyphs of the star Sirius. You can see it! That's what it is!
What's the matter, boy? Did the wolf eat your tongue? I don't know if I'm more surprised to be alive or to see a clergyman with a gun. I don't agree with Mr. Darwin on many issues, but to some extent I believe in the idea of survival of the fittest. You don't negotiate with nature. You either defeat it, or it defeats you.
I don't want to make an outing with a friend out of it. Good. But you have to do it like a schedule. Once a week, otherwise it will happen. You hold the transformation until she takes over.

Unfortunately Ryan, there are times in life when only violence will keep you safe. This is not that moment. Let me do my job, Javier. Don't start this war. It has already started.
Sometimes the sky is so blue and its reflection in the sea is so blinding that you can't look, and other times black snowmen roll over the ocean and you feel as if you are in the heart of the storm. Nature is what I fear most. When it sends the weather to exact its revenge, we all get hit. Soon the weather will prepare a real show. Strangely enough, the more I write about the weather, the more it deteriorates, the more interesting it becomes, and the better it adapts to the story I have arranged for it.
Miranda is still on tour, a great pity for our germinating relationship is in Paris .... Okay,but I didn't mean Miranda. I mean a certain dinner party. At your house. Being forced to chat idly at a dinner party that you can't leave because it's held in your own home is the truest definition of hell.
- Why not? - The suspect was from Manchester. - But the weapon was not found. No. So you can't say where it was from.
No. So you can't claim that he had a gun, right, Mr. Brannigan? Why are you smiling? Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but this is what common sense tells me. No one else had access to that drawer and no one knew it was there.
But with one big difference. On Titan, the seas and rains are made of methane and ethane. On Earth, these compounds are in the form of gas. On frigid Titan, they are liquid. Titan has a lot of water, but it is heavily frozen.

It is something much bigger. This flower is the seal of a woman who works for the cardinal. It's time to pay for your crimes, "Milady." How many times have you cleaned that gun today? Respect your gun and it will respect you.

If he ever sat for a portrait, it no longer exists. He was once described by an acquaintance as "a short little man, with a black complexion and fat." Michell imagined a star so large and massive that nothing, not even light, could escape its gravitational grasp. Can you find the dark gwaizard? You can't see it with your eyes, not directly, but it can leave a kind of trace on the cosmic coast.

Let me... Well. When someone insults me, especially someone I care about, it's a big deal to me, okay? I'm working on my pride. She makes me see differently and I just have to reject her.

You took care of this painting until you were sure it was painted by someone famous. Well, no, but now when I look at it I only see a fake. Beauty is beauty. My fakes give pleasure to many people around the world. /"The only real question one asks of art, no matter if it's in the Louvre or on the wall of a newcomer at the University of California, is: "Did it move you?"
That would explain the awful shoes. What are you guys doing here? Carmen called. She told us about the secret lesbian drawer. Where is it?
Olivia, you shouldn't be upset in your condition. To be divested by them - that's one thing. But I won't let you do that. Very well. But you must promise to accept the doctor's decision, whatever it may be.
I know this is going to sound ridiculous, but looking at fossil studies and knowing what I know about this infection, it's impossible to conclude that it didn't also kill the dinosaurs.
- You overslept a bit. - You are not going to school today. How about a trip? A vacation? I have a new case and she's in Maine and it might take me some time, so I thought we'd go together.
His team would have spent months digging up every scrap of dirt on Andrew Nichols they could find. They would have used it before if they had. And if they hadn't uncovered Andrew's drug abuse before, that is. That means the story didn't come from Leo. Then who did it come from?
However, I will forever want to keep the memory of this meeting with you. I will lose them, I know that. Maybe already tomorrow.

Your son. You know? For whom I was busting my guts just to save him. Go to hell. When you needed this unit, it helped you.
You will hire me again, Kate, unless you want to explain to the press that the district attorney's personal assistant was the brilliant idea behind today's hostage holding. Hello again. I must say I'm impressed. I'd rather think that you wouldn't go as far as blackmail. Someone recently told me that once you let the darkness in, it will never leave you.
You have proven your worth to this family. No one would dare to raise a hand against you. I'm not worried about my body. What puzzles me is the bond between us. And how she will survive this.

I am totally committed to him and the future we are building! I am his partner. I know if he vomits... - It doesn't matter anymore. - ... From nerves, from illness, or because he ate cilantro, which he loves, but it harms him....
A real tear squeezer. And brilliantly told. Are they still waiting for you in Transylvania before sunrise? The vaccine that Dr. Scott developed is now the most valuable commodity in the world. Every day its value increases. Those who are still healthy are desperately seeking it. And she belongs to me!
I understand the seriousness of the situation in Chicago, but I thought there would be verification. So did I, especially in relation to lawyers. His decision was not influenced by Chicago. Why didn't he tell us personally? It is final.
That's right, Lieutenant. Ms. Jones, I speak these words on behalf of the entire firehouse. We are proud to welcome a female firefighter to our doorstep. I will see to it that you are treated with the dignity and respect you deserve. Thank you, commandant. And in return, you will treat the job with the dignity and respect it deserves.
Yes, I know. That's why none of them are here. They're waiting in my apartment, ready to jump out when we get back there. But if you thought this thing could finally happen between us, why did you stop? One day we'll have our own love story, and it won't start that way.
Bastard! Mr. Killol. What happened? No, not that one. What record? - What is it? Where is she? What? Where is the plate?
If you can't trust your superior, I won't trust you. I definitely won't believe it either. Burn it down. - That will be the end of the violence. - She just started it all.
- A hole in the skull of a sick person drills. I have many tools to open a human head. Trepan does it so gently and thoroughly that instead of killing, he heals. Pagans believe that this method releases evil spirits. I believe that it allows to reduce the pressure on the brain.
I have no friends. You are all I have. I think that's the problem. I just know that when we are together, there is something.... with your power.... She not only strengthens mine, but affects everything.
What are you doing? Pamela! - This was the plan, all along, that I must die for all our sins But I will return as a princess of peace; as a messiah. Well, I've seen your future, messiah, and it's not very bright.
You have to tell me. Is he blackmailing you? It's not like that. It's not because of him that I need the money. You have to tell me why you need it.
I know, I'm sorry. Don't apologize. I checked the route our missing weapon took. - So where is it?
Do you want me to count it for you? But he's funny. Where is the rest of the document? There is no rest. Where is she?
- Stupid ... - It's fine. The pain is worse? Okay, it looks like you're losing blood flow to your intestines. I'm afraid your hernia is incarcerated, which means it's the hernia that's cutting off the blood supply and infection can set in.
Remember your own words. We must have faith. - What are we looking for? - Hellfire Club had a stone tablet. I know it has some significance, but the photo did not come out successfully.
My nickname doesn't mean I have to prove it all the time. Whatever you set up for yourself, it's not an easy choice. I do not easily make this decision. But I see no other option to press Darryl Crowe. Once you fire that bullet, it won't go back into the chamber.
Okay, that's enough, look at this. It happened the other night. I picked it up. I tried to get rid of it and now Claire has a bruise in exactly the same place on her arm. This is not a voodoo doll. I know it's not. I picked up that doll at night and threw it in the trash and the next morning, she was back.
There is something I have to tell you. Uuuuu, happy Fourth! We are building a weapon. It is unlike any weapon the world has ever seen. It takes energy from a chain reaction of accelerated neutrons.
Obviously because his Aston Martin is too big. Good grief! Look at this! In the event of a nuclear war, they could fit 14 submarines and three thousand people here. She is under the mountain!
- Stop it, and your mom. She's hot. - Hi, Mathilde. - Who is she?
In that case, fine. I couldn't help but notice that this school is located in.... It's not for me to judge, but.... I'll say it, Marge. She is in Hell!
- Right. - Hi, Frankie. - Good morning, Dr. Avery. Are you named after that great Harper Avery award? Actually, she is named after me, after my family.
That you would survive. Begin. Corporate interests in this city have completely destroyed democracy. Voters voted for me to end corruption. It extends from the boards of directors to the police station.
I can show you. You are making the wrong combination. No, if you want the machine to stand out from the rest, you have to stop talking about it and you have to start talking about the people who made it. They harped on it. The future is coming, whether we like it or not, but it is not said that it will involve us.
- I won't say anything. D-4, Skevur. Two empty packages. That means a second bomb. Where is it?
It's just a beautiful sight. It is. But don't look at it. Look here. You've been thinking about this job in theory. Focus on what it really means.
Sit down, Boyd. In any particular place? It'll be fine there. So you'd like to explain how your buddy the sheriff managed to confiscate half of our supply? Since it wasn't in my possession, it's probably better to ask Darryl Crowe Jr. about it.
I suspect they want to secretly influence water prices. Everything has fallen apart, including the MFA guards. Besides, there was also an explosion at the Yamanote dam. On the dam? I don't know how it's related, but it belongs to this foreign company, and its crew includes retired Treasury employees.
I want to bring a cyber future to third world countries. Would you be willing to help me do that? You should be able to use your powers freely, not work under a bunch of puppeteers. The war is over. you know that. Unfortunately, but it is still going on.
My daring escape and run to freedom.... It's all true. - I swear. / - Good. We'll have to go through all your online correspondence with this Zealot. OK, sure, but she won't help you track him down.
The letter isn't enough to sink the Graysons, but Pascal has a piece of the puzzle I'm missing. - Aiden. - TWM's Trevor Warren Mathis. Pascal said of my father. /As children, we flinch at the sight of blood, not yet realizing that it signifies family, loyalty, and that it is the essence of life.
/Ca... Sa... hear... ...me? Callen, Sam, can you hear me? - What's going on? - Sam and Callen are in the boat. - Where is she?
Wow... And do you know what you want help with this hole? Here's a tip: She's always in the same place!
At first I was devastated. But then I thought: "You know what, so be it." "There are plenty of fish in the sea. I'll leave." So I jumped into this little boat, tried to row, and suddenly, she capsized and started sinking.
When was the last time any of you saw him? The training ended at 8 pm, we all left. The coach stayed to poz and swim, as usual. I think Coach Gabby was still here, too. - Despite the unspecified answer, it seems to have some meaning.
What am I talking about? Where is the money? I don't know. Such money didn't just disappear! Where is it?
Did you expect someone else? You have a nice hairstyle. Did you see my red bag? Molly? Why do you need it?
The photo was taken at 9:44 p.m. Now, if we enlarge it.... The person sitting at table 17 is not Jackie. - She looks just like her. - Who is she?
Restrain your imagination. Tell them about the pipe. I was working. I have this movement called a double helix. I jumped on the pipe, and it broke in my hands.
Two times. The weapons are clean. There is no confirmation of sale, no entry in the database. It's as if she doesn't exist. The federal government is concerned that it looks like it doesn't exist.
Frankie, what have you got? We checked all the paychecks again very carefully and found something strange. Fran's gardener, Joe Martin, got a raise. Six months after her death. According to the bank, it was entered from her IP address using her password.
You feel the way I felt that night in the cave. That what, you go straight to the crack.... Open. And she wants you back.
It's just paint. - What happened? - An evil spirit borrowed your body. And I think it was to send me a message. - What does it mean?
Have you heard of force majeure? Extraordinary circumstances that exempt both parties from the contract. You know what this dome is like force majeure. But she will put us off to a better place.
What are you talking about? You made a huge mistake by opposing me. Didn't I ever mention that the dome saved me from dying on the gallows? She saved me. She chose me to do what she wants.
Not at this point. Mom, you're always a cop. Go talk to her, she'll break fast. There's no way she's going to look you in the eye and tell you that Carter stole that jewelry. Taylor, the problem is that Carter knows where she is, or at least what happened to her.
Hey, is everything okay? Last night my printer turned on by itself. I couldn't turn it off. I pressed the switch. But she kept printing.
I know you girls don't like her. - Yes. - No. I never tried her, but I tested her in the lab, - and she improves you chemically.
And what also happens is that this fat in the liver gets sent into the bloodstream as triglycerides, which can lead to obesity and clogged veins and heart disease. When we eat a lot of sugar and other carbohydrates such as bread and pasta, we produce a lot of glucose. A hormone called insulin is triggered, and it's like a key that helps open the door for each cell to be able to absorb all the glucose, removing it from the bloodstream and burning it as energy. The more glucose in the blood, the more insulin we produce. But the key thing for us is that when insulin itself is in the blood dealing with all that glucose, it tells our fat cells to stay fat.
Few know how to wield it. - You were right. - Get out. I don't want that infernal hand anymore. She is taking possession of me.
See him? Not a day goes by that I don't miss him. There is an indestructible bond between mother and child. No matter who wants to break it or why - she can't. She will last.
Well, now I'm the one who doesn't want to talk about it. This bonus thing has given me something to think about. Stop. You're not good at this. That... or my bonus is bigger because I earned more and she reflects that....
What, you don't think it's cute? On another note, Jose. "On another note, Jose." I improvised this question . I mean, she was in the script, but I gave her the good old BoJack charm.
It's a little windy out there. About. - Honey, what are you looking for? I can't find this message. - Oh, who is it from?
But that means Perez was shot when J-me was 9 years old and living in Boise, Idaho. Were the details about the cross ever revealed? No, ma'am. So either J-me was psychic, or.... Either someone told him the story and he didn't know what it meant.
People like Narcisse, protected by the Church and the Crown. Your father built power by giving the nobles what they wanted. If he were here, he would have had these people exterminated. What do you expect him to do, risk losing the funding of the shalchta on which he depends? Well, maybe it's time for a change, returning power to who it belongs to, along with you, our ruler.
But it was never the right time. But it's okay. I don't regret anything. But, Steve, the one thing I never gave up.... is love. And she doesn't seem to have given up on me either, because here he is.
- There are no files... - The files exist. Receipts, paint samples, eyewitness data, testimony from the junkyard where your Mercedes was destroyed. And it will all end up in the Times if you don't vote today to defeat the proposal to repeal the gun law. So, before you go ahead to do what you say is your job, ask yourself what it's really worth.
That's a good thing. Because there's only one way I can communicate with Clara. Your dad? With such a sense of the moment - for sure. If you bring up a topic close to golf with him, I will do a certain thing and it will not be good.
Everyone needs a second chance Everyone works on the weekend This song is not about the weekend at work. Excuse me? I love this song, but it's not about working on the weekend.
I've just been joined in the studio by four local guys who are preparing to do the most epic party ever. - To the truth, guys? - Yes, it will take place this weekend. You know, we just want to give the community a good time. The event is also in the name of a good cause, because it will honor a young boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson.
You get cash from the "hope committee" every time you use that word. Admit it. I'm serious. It's easy for you to say... You are a heroine. Whenever you need help she magically appears, just like with Henry's book.
When I left she was not there. Suddenly she appeared. Magically? That's a sign. You can understand it however you want, but for me she shows you the possibilities.... Hope.
Do you really think I can let go of reincarnation trouble? Maybe we can use it on Mara, get Audrey back. Thank you. There is no word here about separated personalities or creating new bodies. Maybe I used the right curse, only she.... mutated.
This is you, tricking me into accusing him of murder so that you could get permission for an autopsy. And how else was I supposed to get it, David? By politely asking for it? That bullet won't help him, Liv. She will seal his fate.
Will you forgive them for their religion? Don't ask me how I will rule today. Protestant revolts in England and Scotland, Catholic rulers lose their thrones. I am in no hurry to bring this struggle to France. Your Grace, she is already here.
I just want distance between us. You were wrong. I am not alone. I have David. Even after he found out about Emily. You waited for a disaster, but it didn't happen.
You were never able to live them alone. And before you knew it there was kind of a scene, wasn't there? You could go and fucking see how many bands? It was like a reality. It didn't exist five years before that.
He certainly found a way to do it. What happened? This book. There are all the stories in it. She started it all.
I lied before because I didn't want to have Narsisse's death on my hands. Now you probably see what he is capable of. The only way to save Maria's life and my marriage is to get rid of Narcisse. This envelope contains a cipher, which is all I need to imprison him for treason. If it is found in his house by the royal guard, he will be executed.
Before you arrived, he noted that most of the drawers were chosen for convenience. These are the first drawers you come across when entering an alley, and they are easy to reach. This drawer - just the opposite. Only one map was removed. It was the only one that was loot for the thief.
I mean someone close to me. If something happens, who should I call? You are terribly annoying. Divorced, without children. Get married with a job, she will always be with you.
While Hammond pissed off the local couriers, I pushed forward in good old fashion. Right on Northdella, past that big statue.... Yes, I know where I am now. I know more than navigation! In fact, everyone knows more than McLaren's navigation, because she knows.... literally nothing.
It's got a 3-liter turbocharged 6-cylinder, and I'm sorry, but turbocharging is for weaklings. I know it's good for emissions, polar bears, etc., but it has to have a delay. There has to be a pause between pressing the gas and starting to accelerate. There has to be. You don't feel it, but it has to be there.
However... No, he has... No, you broke it down before you even started James. This trailer is behaving terribly. Why does she...?
You get cash from the "hope committee" every time you use that word. Admit it. I'm serious. It's easy for you to say... You are a heroine. Whenever you need help she magically appears, just like with Henry's book.
When I left she was not there. Suddenly she appeared. Magically? That's a sign. You can understand it however you want, but for me she shows you the possibilities.... Hope.
What does this issue have to do with elections ? New Yorkers have already elected drunks, Italian criminals, fags, Jews and blacks to the mayor's chair. But they will never elect a guy whose wife fucks another behind his back. This wimp, Jack Valliant, May be too soft To use this story if it reaches his desk.
The same goes for the Croats and the Nazis during World War II. The truth is that we can go back 1,000 years and it still won't be clear where the conflict really started. But we all know how it ends. Do you think you are the only one who lost something during this war? It destroyed me.
I think we all saw what we needed to see. - Billy. - Mr. Crowder! Billy! You may have started this game, but you're not the one who's going to say when it ends.
Be a man for once and dissect this lowlife creature. I won't. I'm not like you, okay? I don't want to conquer planets and kill creatures, or wear a lame cape. She's not lame, she's lamÃ®.
"fighting an incurable plague"? Well... everyone has to answer that question for themselves. So... If anyone wants to leave, they have my blessing. The rest will fight death together with me.... Until we defeat it. or it defeats us.
Never mind. Give me the card back. You know what, I think I'll give it back to the entitled person. But she is my mother's, yo.
Oh, Canon, ymm... I wonder if it's too much trouble.... Last night I showed the major.... photo of my nephew, Raymond.... and I think the major may have mistakenly hid it with his own. Could you ask if it is among his belongings.... could you? You won't miss it... Raymond keeps a big fish on it.... marlin, I think that's what it's called....
It is legendary. The Church tried to destroy it even before the time of Constantine. For Friedman, this raised its value. So we'll steal your book.... and give it back to you for a lot of money. The thing is, she has already been stolen.
Thor said you signed a big contract. I wonder how much they'll pay you in prison. Goodbye, Nike, Gatorade, bye bye, "Dancing with the Stars." I'll buy a fucking machine! What does she do?
This sample is from Pompeii and costs $90,000 , so please be careful. Sorry, you collect... Garbage. Since 79 AD. Historical chronicles describe events that people wanted to remember, but trash shows us the past as it actually was.
I'm just trying to make things better, ok? I tell you that I love you unconditionally, I tell you that you are beautiful, I tell you that your ass looks great even if you are 80 years old. I try to make you smile. I've endured a great deal of all this, but if you think I'm some kind of dog that will keep coming back and coming back, you're sorely mistaken. On the other hand, if you want real love, here it is.
And he died. Pakhi, you are such a parrot to me. If something happens to you... Do you know that finally Manikpur has electricity? Really? And how long will she stay there?
I don't give a shit what it's based on. He's not going to outlaw the Chamber. Don't forget that you work for me, Frank, not for him. If he wants something on the rostrum, he needs to talk to me. I know you put a lot of pride in your manhood, Bob, and it's impressive, but whatever it is, Linda can still put a stop to it.
Good. That's good. I know what you're thinking. If I'm so afraid of returning, why didn't I find her earlier. I was going to find her. She does exist.
Crucify him! Go away, Satan. I worship the Lord my God and serve him alone! /Jesus resisted Satan's temptation / and prepared to begin his mission. /But it will be without / John the Baptist.
- The Lord brought us here from Egypt. - True! He promised us this land. True! And soon, it will be ours.
You scared me. I said it's not a memoir. I heard about this book. She is obscene. - No, she is sincere.
Say what you know ! - I will not play your game ! - My game? You started this game. I will say when it ends.
Is it Luther? I would like to make a reservation for two. My father and future best friend. I'm not a fan of nature. She is free and overrated.
Throw off your clothes and wear mine. Never take off that hat, my friend. Bucephalus will never know I'm gone. He will surely love you as much as he loves me. I give up my soul, she wants to go home.
But this party is not because of today's victory! That already belongs to the past. This party is because of our future. The point is do you want to see the future? So here it is.
She doesn't care about you! She's a cheater! She didn't care about you until she fucking needed you! This is my cell phone. Where is she?
I will come to you when I start looking for him. Maybe his flight has been delayed. Please come in. Hi Aditya. Have you forgotten my proposal or do you think it is invalid?
I thought mental control would be much more effective in analyzing his personality. Mental control fails because its methods are too obvious. You've tried too hard, Frederick. If it is forceful, the patient will give in only temporarily. As soon as the patient is exposed to the manipulation method, it becomes much less effective.
Just because you killed my father doesn't mean you will replace him. Abigail, we lived through a traumatic event and it affected you the most, but we lived through it together. - You want to write about all of us. - I don't need your approval. Nor approval, but I count it would be important.
Sex addiction is very different from, say, drug or alcohol abuse, because you don't actually need those things. These addictions can be completely removed by removing the drugs or alcohol. Not that it's easy. But the difference when it comes to sex addiction is that everyone has sexuality and it is an integral part of our personality. If anyone were able to imagine excluding sexuality, then one would be left with a severely reduced person, because.... because sexuality also includes tenderness, contact, solidarity with other people.... and without this at some level it is difficult to imagine anyone living. So are you saying that no one is able to get rid of their sexuality, even if it destroys everything around them?
Do you think that if two men traversed a train in search of women, anyone would raise their eyebrows in surprise or wonder if the man led a life like yours? Your story about Mr. H. would be eminently banal if you were a man and your prey was a woman. When a man abandons his children because of lust, we accept it with a shrug of the shoulders, but you, as a woman, had to take on a burden of guilt, a burden that will never ease. Your abortion was legal, but above all it was a self-inflicted punishment.
Didn't we already go through this at Christmas? Exactly, and is it true that you and Sam got married? Is it true? Shut up, Tina. I call this comet Tubbington-Bopp, and it's heading straight for Lima.
Take out your phones, now! Ryder, relax. Dude. I know it's annoying, but.... Now no one will confess, for fear of being killed. I confessed everything to this person, and he just wants to know who she is.
-Lighten up again, eh? Please.... Don't do anything to us, please! My sister? ! She is the only one who cares about me. She is the one who brings me novels.
Why would I kill your husband? Because he robbed you. Yes. And I want my property back. I don't know where it is.
Why didn't you tell me? Because you don't like to talk about God. Because you can't explain it, and you hate it. Do you believe in God? I... I see God in science. Because it explains everything?
We were able to catch him. And you gave up. No. That's right, you did. This whole option with Tammi -- she fucks with your head. She interferes with your ability to do your job.
Today's. Look, Rebecca wanted me to spy on you, and your dad asked me to spy on her. I'm doing all this for you, Mads. I lost my card from the hospital somewhere. Do you know where it is?
Spencer... I know you don't want a friend right now, but that doesn't mean your friends don't need you. I still don't understand why you guys are so concerned about this outfit. One girl was wearing it on the train. We had a bit of a fight, and I want to know who she was.
My father is a Lutheran. Irish and Norwegian. No, he is no longer alive. He was cremated. Pastor, I'm not saying that the message has not been conveyed to Mr. Chaough, I'm just stressing the urgency of the situation.
Hello? Norma? Hello? Today I want you to think about poetry. On what does it mean?
The organs are not in the right place. This one, no kidding. Okay, listen... I know you really wanted this operation. But it is not safe for you.
/ - Know what's in your hearts. This is our reunion, Rat / Let not fear, / the past or the opinions of strangers shake you. /Find your own truth. /It will lead you to the things you love.
I had a really good departure when I passed my high school diploma. I'm sure you'll keep that to yourself. Outwardly, my life was a mess. And I hurt a lot of people. Then Franky taught me this trick and it mostly works, so I don't become mean.
I understand. I understand how important this flower shop is to you. It's not about the flower shop. That's what I meant. It's about what it symbolizes.
- Sure. Why don't we watch something? - You read my mind. - Bottom line. /Unfortunately, there was a surgical complication with the donor liver and it is no longer usable.
Remove the bad. Leave the good. And the necessity of writing.... Do we consider it a bad thing or a good thing? Most likely to disappear with the pathological change. Fortunately, it is not located near the elocution area.
- There. - Where? I hate rats. - Where? - Where is he?
Quick! Down with Vortigern! - You learned to use the sword. - I had no control over him. He was the one in control of me, I don't even remember what happened.
I'm in. I want to rob this bank. Well, it could be this bank, too. Where do we start? We contacted a buddy of my former son-in-law. And how is he going to help us?
/- Lisa? - I'm fine. I'm in a cave. The shark almost got me. / Where is he now?
It was the damn beer everywhere. It wasn't Jeff's fault. The "stop" sign was already on the ground. The police probably thought Jeff had mowed it down. But he was already lying there.
It is with him that you can lead a life, if you forget about pride for a moment. Don't make my mistake. Accept the contract. That voice in your head... I think I know what he sounds like, because I know Eleanor wanted the same thing.
You have to believe me. That night at the marina, where did you hide it? Where did you hide the wire? Inside is my daughter. Harlee, where was he?
Harlee, where was he? This is not the time or place. God! Tell me. Where was he?
This can prove to be very dangerous. It is dangerous to let you kill with impunity. - Let it go. - Where is the key? - Where is it?
This is my writing. "It's true, H.G., don't go crazy." "Believe it. I wrote it, but... This symbol, what does it mean?
I found proof that Zack did not kill the lobbyist. I won't ask when you found the time, for this search, what have you got? I looked at the lobbyist's ribs. I was with Dr. Brennan when she analyzed them, she didn't find anything. In one of the stab wounds, I found the killer's microbiology signature and it doesn't match Zack.
I will take care of it. The strap is as important as the watch. It's a lesson not to skimp. I'll find it right away. Where the hell is he?
Where is the Sword of Souls? I have no idea. Our interrogation techniques have been improved since you were one of us. You can torture me all you want. I don't know where it is.
You wanted me to not know that you didn't want me. No... You are right, I... I didn't want children. But if there's one thing my travels aboard the Waverider have taught me, it's that time doesn't always provide us with what we want. But that... he is very crafty in giving us what we need.
We would have had time to find a cure. Jim didn't have to kill him. The cure? This virus is not a disease. He is the antidote.
But through pain, you can't become what you need to become. Who you have to become for Gotham. If your feelings and emotions are strong enough, their consequences can follow you to the real world. I don't know what you want from me. For hundreds of years we have tried to end the cycle of crime and violence that has tainted Gotham, but it keeps coming back.
He is a total fraud. He's not even a scientist. He wouldn't even memorize the PIN number for the card. Too many digits. Only four. What is he still doing here?
I will help you understand what you have become. You had a powerful, traumatic awakening, just as I did. My true self, revealed when I died. Along with hell and eternal suffering. I belong to my psychic dimension as much as it belongs to me.
This is another Dean cell phone, so you probably know what to do. Dean, call me. We have a problem. Hello, Mary. Your print doesn't open this room because he's not for you.
It began. I'm connected to the FAA network. Control centers in SeaTac, Vancouver, Anchorage.... No sign of the plane. Nothing. He can't just disappear.
Since his tragic death, Howard has been searching for the Holy Grail of the digital age.... the quantum computer. A quantum computer is a pipe dream. No, it's not a pipe dream. It does exist.
You are Blossom, from head to toe. And something else before you go to the ball. Grandma's ring. It's not in my box. It's not in Polly's either. Where is it?
Thank you. - You saved my life. - That was my goal. I know I had a gun. Where is it?
A very lucky hit. It was terrible. A person is not able to get used to human screaming. I am terribly sorry. But he ... Will regain his sight, right?
It's not out of sadness, but out of happiness. Look at this garden. How beautiful! There will be enough space for the little ones to run around. Well, big it is.
Comparing this to previous situations, this time is somehow different. Maybe someone new is behind it. Is it a simulation of the vaccine? This time the infected show different characteristics. I'm trying to hound the artificial virus, because it seems to be the cause of the infection.
I talked to them about ideas for a music video. Yes, with this music video people will do marketing for you, right? They will tweet about it. They'll post about it on Facebook. But it has to stand out. It has to get people moving.
I haven't heard from you. So I'm checking. How are things going? I'm sitting in the car by my old house. And he looks exactly the same.
Does Renard know about the symbols? Apparently, Diana drew them when she was with him. - What else does he know? - He knows about the tunnel. He just doesn't know where it is.
In short, we have to destroy the destructor or we are done. Still, something bothers me about that destructor's anklet. It was all cracked, as if it was made up of many parts, and none of these texts are talking about anything like that. Something also bothers me. If it is as powerful as it should be and belonged to all those people it supposedly belonged to....
Ask any cop. Sometimes... a shiver runs down your spine and you have to pay attention to it. But I've never loved anyone the way I loved Gus. And the idea of never seeing him again makes my stomach hurt and.... That's why, when you identify your instinct, you should try to figure out where it came from in the first place and see if you can explain yourself better to Gus.
Someone wants that $300,000 worth of grass. Any news from Wes? No, but there is good news. According to the manufacturer, the GPS tag we found only sends a live signal. So even if he doesn't remember where he is, if you track the tag online, you can find his location.
I swear. Kyle... - Where are you going? - Nothing here for us. This... woman said Sidney has a partner. She bankruptly knows who he is.
Ride! No! - No! - Image. Where is he?
- Charming. - Do you mind if we sit down? Let's sit here. I appreciate your rescue, - but it was not necessary.
- Why? What is in those capsules? - I misunderstood it. Very, very badly. The colonist ship is not on its way, it is already here.
No, probably reigns / Night of purification. Congratulations, Ore. You got me. Mommy didn't reveal the secret plan? What did it sound like, comrade?
I need to get back to my son. I didn't want to leave my son today either. But I left him bleeding in the hospital. Do you know why? Because until you kill the monster, it will keep coming back.
What's this crap from Space Invaders? And yet, no. Again, full power on the Not-Simple. Electricity is not for motors. He's for lights and chairs.
If this is a real Alfa Romeo, then there must be.... something wrong with it. Think about it. Someone who is good to his mother and punctual and sober and well-dressed is an Audi, and no one wants such a friend. If you want to establish a relationship with a car if you want to develop a strong relationship it must have human qualities.
You killed them all, and now they will kill you. I didn't know about Praimfaya. You can tell them that. I didn't want to hurt anyone. The sword doesn't care about your intentions. He only cuts.
"This is the winter of our discontent." Washington's people are camped at Valley Forge where they are trying to overcome bad feelings and fear. I was called to the camp because the general believed that a force of evil was behind the unrest. The British had unleashed a monster that fed on raw human despair. It worked by capturing a single soldier and then imprisoning his soul.
Stephanie Borden. How can I help you? - I need a Danish whisk. - Excuse me? I stopped by the Gray Manor and found an interesting recipe, but it calls for a Danish whisk and Cassie said you might have one.
this problem, if not addressed, will tear this new union apart. Good day, Mr. Crane. It was surprisingly pleasant. Have a safe return. So, if this ward was built by Bannekers and he was able to stop the Horseman, what else did he have in his arsenal?
Or something worse. Then Syd appeared. She woke me up. The creature understood that it could no longer hide. And he...
Dreyfuss will not rest until he gets what he wants. Until he uses it. What will happen then? You know. You must know. When you light this artifact, he will summon the Horseman of War.
Roman soldiers don't run, and we did. What? They are underground, near the river. There is a fish sign at the entrance. Is that him?
Someone who lives by the laws of darkness, pride and idolatry. Kingsley. Father. I was thinking about the ninth paragraph and how it relates to you. It directs leaders to meet the needs of the church.
There are four nights left for your seven. - Phil won't. - He will. He didn't know Mom was dying, but he already knows. When you need a miracle, he happens.
So when I'm not home, thank yourself. Hey, people! I'm buying a car! It has great features including smart 4-wheel drive and a trunk that opens with your foot. That is, you keep your foot in the back and it does what it wants.
You have five minutes before we take him into custody. Use them. /Listen, this is for real. /There's a cab in Lower Manhattan with liquid sarin inside. /It is in a bag.
In response to Project Blue Book, an academic committee called the Robertson Panel was established in 1953. Consisting of some of the most respected physicists and astronomers at the time, the Robertson Panel was appointed to provide a fair and independent scientific analysis of UFO acts. The document says in black and white that the people on this panel are accountable to and work with the CIA. And these are highly regarded scientists in an academic setting. It says clearly that when there is some strong evidence, we have to assemble something, release some kind of balloons and film it so that it can be "unmasked."
I don't like this tea party. Mitchell and Haley always come back giddy and have their secrets, and I feel excluded. Once I tried to start my own tradition of uncle and niece.... I am not questioning the methodology of the gas pedal mass spectrometer. I'm just pointing out that it's not the only one with the power to separate rare isotopes from excess neighboring mass.
So we can remove it without setting off the bomb? Yes, but there is one problem. /The canister is lead. /It protects you for now. It is the only thing that protects you from radiation.
You know what, I'll eat them on your behalf. You can eat the bacon baby. I have a new plan to lower your cholesterol. If it includes eating pork, you have my attention.
I met our new neighbors. One of them, a husband. His name is Dean. Guess what? He offered to repair our fence and he will be the one to cover the cost.
Okay, tomorrow, two sets, Breezewoods Country Club. It's where Otto and I went on our third date, and he gave me this huge diamond. Yes. Yes, but when we found out that it was obtained with blood, because in order to get it, someone had to cut off the fingers of little children, he got rid of it, and sent the money to Africa to build an orphanage.
- DO HOUSES FLY? - WE LEARNED. We think of a flying bird as something that has no purpose. But for the bird, that's what the purpose is. He is looking for something.
We think of a flying bird as something that has no purpose. But for the bird, that's exactly what the goal is. He is looking for something. He's not just flying, hanging in the air. No, he is flying somewhere.
Woman? Scalpel! Inside the trans movement there are people with fascist tendencies. How do you perceive this fascism? How does it manifest itself?
Don't thank me. I want you to have the wedding of your dreams. It's going to take a while to get there, because you were right. I want to enjoy it, find the time. We'll set a date with Mike, but it won't be close.
Today kids prefer to play basketball or soccer. As long as they don't end up in the ring. You can't play boxing. It's not a game. It's a test of how many times you can hit someone before he hits you.
Losing a president is like losing a father, and you were a mother to all of us. And this is a very good story. The whole country watched the funeral. From beginning to end. Several decades from now, people will remember. Its dignity and majesty, they will remember you. It serves a specific purpose.
- Who is teaching him? - Me. How to be tough. Seriously? I have a question. The sign of Mara Salvatrucha, where does it come from?
I was at a concert... and on the other side of the stage was this.... two-legged rabbit. I don't know what role I play there. Listen to me. Listen. When I was moving.... He moved the same way. He imitated me.
"A world where wishes are granted." "Each of us must know that the amazing stream of love, is in every heart." "Can there be such a star, somewhere beyond the vast blue sky?" "On the vast assessment that is the sky, I traveled in the boat that is the moon." "If you are looking for a beautiful world, it is right here."
National? Mmm. No, no, no... Planetary security. It's a fragment of a radioactive xenomineral. We suspected that it might biointeract, so we took the sample to AMRIID Station, where the corpse of a Kryptonian descendant is stored.
You, too, apparently, Mr. Bouchard said. Please tell us: - what is he doing? - What are you guys doing? I gave you an indicator, and he disappeared.
We have to stop them! You can't let them push you around like this. BFG, and where did my blanket go? I thought you had it. Where should he be.... maybe in the cape?
Coming. - Would you like a glass of wine? - Please. I didn't recognize the car. Whose is it?
How? Please ask for directions. There is a main switch, at the base of the Tower. The main switch, describe it what should I look for? What does it look like? Where is it located?
What to serve, my friend? Drinks for free. What do you want? Chet. Amelia's movie. Where is he?
What am I doing here? Because you and your buddy Dr. Stockman found something of mine. A teleportation device. Thanks to the teleport, I was supposed to escape from prison. He can do much more.
On the night of Naz's arrest, he lost a lot. Freedom so he could return to his family, to school to the night job that helps pay for it. However, he did not lose something that no one can take away from anyone. The constitutionally guaranteed right to an attorney so he can be fairly and neutrally judged by you, his fellow citizens, and the right to be presumed innocent beyond a reasonable doubt. We often hear this term. But what does it actually mean?
The pigs are fattening... and the fattening pigs.... go to slaughter. That goes for you. You know what, you always have a plan ready, bitch. What is it?
Share any information. The last "expert advice" nullified attempts to draw any conclusions. HAZAMA, BIOLOGIST - I have created a simple profile. It shows three configurations.
I want to be the solution to a problem. Do you know what it is? A tomato. First... There was a seed. If you take care of the garden, it will take care of you.
But through pain, you can't become what you need to become. Who you have to become for Gotham. If your feelings and emotions are strong enough, their consequences can follow you to the real world. I don't know what you want from me. For hundreds of years we have tried to end the cycle of crime and violence that has tainted Gotham, but it keeps coming back.
- Exactly. Jay, did you find anything else related to Project Volt? Will you stop connecting dots that don't exist? Carrie, I found a list of professors and scientists associated with the project, so yes. I just think that we should consider the possibility that someone has relaunched this program and it has started to work operationally, and you might be connected to that somehow.
Gentlemen! - Am I speaking in a foreign language? - What is a chicken squat in a pie? When a man sits down in a pie. He sits down into it.... And shakes it. You may know it as Hellmann's mayonnaise, but he does the crying squat, so there are tears involved.
She would probably do everything in her power, including walking out into the middle of the road in front of the carriage to run it over, hoping to slow it down even momentarily. It fascinates me how you stubbornly expect the least likely outcome, just because you prefer it. You expect the world to be the way you want it to be, despite all the evidence and experience proving otherwise. I was hoping for a different outcome. But I assure you it will not be the one you hope for, because even to stand in our way, she would have to know which one.
It's not bad but a bit nostalgic. Leonard says that such is life: not only are we supposed to curse its meaninglessness.... but also glorify it, because it makes no sense. This is too hard for me, but my mother always puts it down to. "Live each day as if it were your last.
The cornea gets burned, it can't stand such intensity of light. And you temporarily lose your vision. In theory, the pain is psychological. There are no pain receptors in the cornea. This particular model was created by the Department of Security to torture prisoners after 9/11. Unfortunately, it was withdrawn when a few of the fuckers went blind for good.
You know what I love about the ocean? I love it when it has you in its grip. I understand it. He swallows you whole. He's big, you're tiny.
I slept badly and had the best time ever. These conversations we have... I don't know if they help or hurt more. Wouldn't you rather be able to forget sometimes? This pain... It's the only thing I have left of him.
They may have caught the murderer. This is... excellent news. Did you notice anything unusual? Yes, some freak photographed a dead bird. - What is its name?
She was capable of terrible things, but she decided to be good. At least since she found you. I saw her death 12,483 times seconds before it happened. I couldn't save her, but I tried all the time. You can't fathom my grief because you can't experience it like I did, but it's real.
You are fine. But when you talk, you don't listen. Do you hear the wind? Yes. He will lead us to them.
I fell. You just listen to the wrong voice. I used to call it the prisoner's dilemma. No, you didn't call it that. That's what he calls it.
No more of this circularity. Are you wondering if I'm still on the banner? I'm over it now. I am the master of my fate. My secret? This little instrument. I blow, as in a balloon.... And it squeaks when it's time for a refill.
Carl Emerson, I have a message for your leader. I will not stop until my people are free. If you do not let them go, I will irradiate level 5. We all experience pain. Sometimes it is physical.
What happened. I messed up the reading. Fatally. And I know the reason is not in the numbers. He is here.
The £50 that the place earns. Are you suggesting it was a robbery? I don't believe anything without evidence. Sister Fabian kept everything here. Unfortunately, she had the only key and I have no idea where it is.
- He is a mathematical genius. A participant in competitions. - But the reactor is not working. - That's right. We had 200 cassettes in the reactor, but now it is empty.
Well, at 17 at the station. You can take the hotel car. Have you seen my hat? - The hat? - Where did it go?
You are the most important. I have 800 years to find the balance. Now we have to help Mason. I need my sword. It was forged with a unique power.
So it's a coincidence that this disk was lost just that day When I told you? Apparently. Hanna, the police haven't kicked down the door yet. The only person who suspects that I have this disk is you. Just tell me where He is.
- Probably from under one of the stacks. Help me find it. I need to call Mallory back. I can't remember her number. Where is he?
/No, it's impossible! Come up, boy. You're a sweet boy. Will you carry this letter through the door throw it on the desk and run out? Who is it for?
There was a boy... His father bought him a falcon for his sixth birthday. Are you really telling me a story now? Please, just listen. His father told him to tame the bird. To make it obedient.
- Hi. - I can pilot with my feet. - Hi. - Okay, for now. So I'm 100% sure the toe won't float, but I'm looking at the water so he doesn't freak out, and he's there.
The outer door is closed. Everything is in order. We will be fine. We'll be fine. You hear the quietest splash of water and suddenly he appears.
This is the job of the eldest son. Hospitals give the body to the family to wash and prepare it for cremation. This is it. We thought the festival was upsetting him. No, he was an opportunity for him.
"Transfer was made" "November 2014" Time, is really something cruel. He can heal anything. And no matter if it's good or bad memories, he will blow them into dust, leaving us with fuzzy scars.
Yes, yes. The previous fall, your tailor sewed you a suit made of such material. Do you remember him? Yes, I remember it. Where is he?
Both keys must be turned at the same time, or the alarm will sound. That's why the thief couldn't open the lock with a pick without setting off the alarm. So our boy opened the lock with a pick, huh? He had to. I am the only one who owns a key, and it never leaves my pocket.
- Me: You are the one watching your husband read a book. I put a camera up to see what he's capable of. There are cameras in all the rooms? Because sometimes I sit down while I'm cleaning the TV remote, and it accidentally turns on.
Yes, I understand. Does she still have natural hair? She straightened it. She used a straightener for a while and.... And then she had... such a treatment. What was it called?
Look at the fan. Pick a point and concentrate on it, see if you can melt it. I was hit by a bird when I was flying. No, you hit him. No, he hit me.
This drawing, the coat of arms, indicate that you were in some castle in Fillory. - Kill me. - Built by dwarves. Okay, let's not go into such details. The point is that it is full of .... many improbably magical things.
Natalya should never have known what I was. I thought love was enough. This secret... He doesn't protect us. He is killing us.
On Broadway, fashion weeek, his trial. My father got me first places at the awards from the inability to love. Somehow I'll survive it, but I'm just saying that, because if we went to those Tastes of Bushwick, we'd be closer to the field. I love this festival. And it hangs on me.
Yes, it is ours. And it's top secret. It's a giant rodent, a rat on steroids. He allows us to take remote control of any network system.
- Including ZIP? - Yes. - There must be a connection. - It is not an uncommon measure. But it has only occurred in you in such a dose.
Do you know where your family is? What kind of injuries did she have? She had deep cut wounds, inflicted with metal or glass. As a precaution, we gave her tetanus remedies. This painting, what does it mean?
If Camila hadn't paid off some traffic cops.... - What will she do with Batman? - That's a matter between them. Between you and me, I have a plan for the future. It does not include the bullet intended for you.
- Typical daddy dodge. "Can we buy a pony?" "Let me think about it." And how about that pony? Somehow I haven't seen him. Where is he?
- It's Baal. - It's Baal. Christ... We need the Kandarian dagger. - Where is it?
Christ... We need the Kandarian dagger. - Where is it? - Such one confiscated it. - Tell us where he is.
Have we all read the latest agreement? - Actually, I don't think so... - So can we move on to the vote? I'm sorry, I have a problem with paragraph 2 of section 14. It states that Maleant has exclusive rights to Pied Piper equipment for five years.
Should I spell it out for you? It can't not be Pablo. - To be clear? - To be clear, the Necronomicon is the only way to banish Baal back to the hereafter. E-e, I have a plan for Baal and it doesn't involve recycling Pablo into a silly book.
The pain of losing you.... I miss him. I return to him. I relive him... Again and again. But he's the only thing holding me back.
But I assure you that all you will find is a nation that wants to develop and become part of the first world. Feeding this nation would be a good start. Mr. President, Western allies are only curious about the electric flare that was recently captured over your desert. An overload led to an electrical arc in one solar turbine. It burned the building that stands there.
I am in a dream. I don't know when the dream began or whose dream it was.
I could have guessed that you wouldn't allow it. After all, this is your little kingdom. For a short while yet. I said that the labyrinth is not meant for you. He is for them.
Some people see only ugliness in this world. I prefer to see beauty. But this is an illusion. We are trapped. We live in this garden, delighting in its beauty, not knowing that it has an order, a definite purpose.
And now it's time to say goodbye, old friend. Good luck to you. Do you know where you are? I am in a dream. I don't know when this dream started or whose dream it was.
Jaha's backpack. What about him? It activates the A.I. I'm sure that if we destroy it, we'll destroy her too. I know where he is.
Merrick has a detonator. He demands that you come here or he will use it. - I still don't understand anything. - I need to make sure you don't fix what you did to the ship! He must fall!
Francisco Luis Vargas... Would you please step back from the screen...? I will literally murder you. The governor's education plan... Is a misfire. /It will result in more harm than good.
/ Die... in the ass.... the swarthy cow. - What - what a brute. We almost walked in on him. - Where did he even come from?
We use surgical instruments during embalming. I left a scalpel unsecured and injured myself. To me it looks like a knife wound. You know, one of the men in the pavilion you killed, Ray Mui, was carrying a spring knife when he died. He left a mark like that.
What are you doing in my crypt? Briefly - something with fangs wanted to kill us. And you are hiding instead of fighting? I saw this monster in my dream. - In the end he... - He killed me, so....
You see, these guys are like their product. They never sleep. So Dunning had no way to check the computer. So you can't confirm its contents without storming the castle. If you invade the castle and it's empty, you've wasted a year's work.
I know it sounds silly, but think for yourself. It really seems to me that it could be a great success. After all, hundreds of people have dogs, and I'm sure they wonder what they think of them. Yes, maybe, but they don't wonder what her dog is thinking about. Or what she thinks he is thinking.
By. Where did we end up? We admired the diamond.... Matelio, where is the diamond? Matelio, where is it?
Where did we end up? We admired the diamond... Matelio, where is the diamond? Matelio, where is it? Where is it?
But it's all about the chip. For him, Rose kidnapped Mateo. Elena kidnapped Luisa so that Rose would give it to her. But Rose didn't have it because Nadine didn't give it to her. - So where is it?
Did Henry tell you about the Baskerville fund? He didn't mention anything. Do you know each other? In this fund Charles placed most of his money, from the estate of Hugo Baskerville, a railroad baron. It passes, untouched, to the oldest surviving heir.
It will only get worse if you do not meet my demands. The number of corpses will increase dramatically. The Red Devil next to Green Malice will be him like a harpy. Hester, he murdered the disgusting boy Number Five. - Tell us who he is.
- How did you find me in Dallas? - It is not difficult to trace you. We have not received your vaccination card. This is required by the board of education. Yours does not exist. I researched your diploma and it was issued by what you might call a kierat.
The bullet extracted from the victim matches the weapon used to kill James Lam. That is, Lam's competitors killed them both. If we believe Sang Min, then yes. The victim was killed before we got Sang Min out of prison, so he may be telling the truth. Unfortunately, we are unable to determine the exact time of death, however, it occurred within the last 72 hours.
Seriously, step back. give a glimpse of this handsome new acquisition of the Beyond. We need to pass a message to friends at the top. You removed the phone that allowed it. Where is he?
As well as pleasure. Taste. They make noble beverages that go far to relieve the pain of embodiment. I would like more than one to fight on my side, but an army can only have one leader. Otherwise, as in the case of the two-headed snake, it can sink its fangs into itself.
How did this happen? Where did the DEA get you? Where's the microphone? I want to make sure they can hear me. Where is it?
We should be one hundred percent sure before we tell her that the guy she likes is a common bastard who wants to buy everyone out of the camp. Will you help us, Rarity? I'd love to help, but I have to finish sewing this poncho if it's going to participate in the fashion show. At the rate you guys are doing it, I don't know if we'll ever finish the catwalk. The catwalk is our gift to the camp and it will be completed.
Why did you come here? What happened to Owen's sister? You are a friend of Owen Hunt. I thought he told you himself. He said you put her in a helicopter and it crashed.
They need to know if Afterlife works in real world conditions. So the Army, they just grab whoever they want. They claim he has transformed, and who is going to argue with that? Everyone infected has a chip, right? He contains a supply of Zombrex for a year, up to three.
- You see, he likes yours. - It's not a fluke. - No, not true! - True! - Liam, he is beautiful.
- Declared as a potential life.... It was ruled my property. I knew. It had to be this way. He is not alive.
If it's not Storybrooke or the Enchanted Forest, then what? Wherever we are, I prefer not to stay here. Can you use your wand and take us to Storybrooke? - Not really. - So we're stuck in this world. - Wherever it is.
- It means a lot to me. - Of course. So, what now? Rachel needs training, so I will carry it out for her. I don't know how long it will last and what it entails.
And this is your house, yes? Yes. 1547 Oakmont. Did you give permission to this drone to fly past it? Definitely no. And how often does he do that?
You told the Doctor not to shoot down the drone, so he safely grounded it and returned it. Was the drone returned to Ms. Hamm in one piece? Yes, but... Then why are you bothering me? He returned the drone, it was not damaged.
I made it with my own hands from a rabbit I hunted. - You hunted a rabbit? - Didn't you? I never cooked stew for anyone except Jean. He was homemade, but she just didn't accept it.
You are the one in charge. I shouldn't tell you what to do. Erin, don't worry about it. Everyone is just trying to do their job. As for this house, do you think it exists?
What is it? A premonition? In my dreams I see a man. I feel as if I am looking into his life. Who is he?
We wouldn't have done it ourselves and it was a wise idea to buy SwapMeet. Yes, I may not love Doug and Craig, but I respect your decision to leave them in the company. As I told Donna, I would have paid them off. That's the cost of doing business. /But it's nice that you decided to make it work. /I appreciate the phone call, but it wasn't necessary.
There were hundreds of us until the Court saw our strength. They offered us a partnership and betrayed us. Many fled to Ukraine, but a few of us stayed, hoping to find a way to get revenge. - And we did find one. - The key. - What does it open?
Ellie, you saw what they did to your friend. Well, yes, but... Why did they kill Nick? And why did they kidnap me? Good questions. Why do you need that watch? And what does it have to do with her?
You are right, Onoda-kakka, but every power is accompanied by subversive activities. And in Manchuria, and here. May I bring up the subject of movies again? You didn't understand. We are considered weak. If a nation has a reputation for being weak, then it is weak.
- This may seem unrealistic.... - But long-term outright brilliant. Unfortunately, it's no absolute proof, but it's better than avoiding criticism altogether. Therein may lie the missing link. When you deliver your manuscript, he can bring us absolute proof.
I'm sure she murdered Milly Davis. Remember what I said about the key novel? Readers recognize the truth underneath the fiction. And reputations can be ruined. When you deliver your manuscript, he can bring us absolute proof.
Shucks, we have to reschedule. Gaby and Fiona have taken mushrooms and Kennedy wants me to take care of them. But we have to study. We have a lot of studying today. Do I make the sound, or does it come out of the speakers?
Something to guide us home when we feel lost. If we're lucky, someone tells us how to proceed. If not, we have to figure it out ourselves. Pablo's enemies developed their own way. And it was perfidious.
You can't be serious. Do you want me to explain it using easier words? This research will lead us to a cure. When will you finally understand that there is no cure? You have already found your cure once and it failed.
Do you know how the neutralizer works to poison only animals? It seems he was working on an alternative neutralizer. How alternative? This neutralizer will not make the gas harmless to humans. He will make it harmless to animals.
Aristotle was a disciple of Plato. He argued that your character is a matter of chance because it results from your actions, which are under your control.
So that means... That it's not because of the stone? Or that it's not just a stone. That's right. So... What is it?
- What's up? I left Poppy behind. - Who is Poppy? - My turtle. Do you mean to say that it belonged to your host/host?
Shadows believe they are a mistake of evolution. Like... A glimpse into the never-wanted dark side of the universe. That's why they were sent here, into our shadows, to be forgotten. Quite an annoyance to them. Noted. It's to remind them that if they don't defeat the universe, it will destroy them.
The asshole stole it from me and gave it to another woman. I met them now at Blind Tiger and took it back. You stole it from his wife's neck. I didn't steal it. He is mine.
But apparently we were not given. Yes. Maybe you could renovate my summer house in the Hamptons? I appreciate the idea but I don't do residential buildings. He is not residential, I treat him as a home office.
Maybe it's something good. They'll do the research and we'll find out everything. I'll bring coffee. - This hospital... - He was the closest.
I was wrong. My mistake. And that Broadway movie. Ten of us helped him, and you still didn't shoot it. Just because you improve the script doesn't mean it's good.
"Every war is a deception. In the midst of chaos lies an opportunity." So remove the virus from my tablet and restore all the votes. The Chinese, on your tablet only uploaded an image of it to confuse your administration. In fact, it is running from one of their computers.
I would be in the same position if a store asked us to start selling, you know, hashish or "day after" pills. We sell "day after" pills. What? I don't want to sell rice anymore. He has no taste.
Sorry, I overheard you. I work for the government; maybe we can help. My son can track Daniel's tablet. He doesn't have a location function;
It would be fun. - And then to a movie or dinner. - Baby steps. I noticed you're a little tense, so I bought you an ergonomic chair. I think you will find that it gives satisfying support.
Well, that's hard to do. Now take a pill. I don't like methylprednisolone. I get cranky after it. Toby says it keeps the inflammation at the level of your L4.
I'm not likely to go crazy. Mr. Dalal's story has been confirmed? Yes, but that's not why I'm calling. I found a motive for the attack on the guard group. Or rather, he found me.
No, you interfered badly. - I'm sorry, Jake, this is a bad omen. I'm not going to take your side in the fight against the universe. He is hundreds of years old.
- lose weight. - This negativity interferes with my concentration. Of course we have a solution. We have a weight loss sensor. He tells her when she has eaten enough, yes?
With the changing winds, the cargo went off course. This is, first of all. Second, the rate of descent is slow, giving the enemy time to shoot down the payload. Therefore, the British came up with the idea of attaching rockets to the payload. It would then fall at a limiting speed, and at the last moment fire off the rockets, ensuring a soft landing.
Shame is the only thing that followed. Shame... And painful realization. I don't know if Draal should be a Troll Hunter and I don't care. All I know is that I am not one. Despite your doubts about your choice by Amulet, he is now bound to you.
Me: I want to stop him. The spirit? The ghost? He is not a ghost.

Handmade. Art! It belonged to my great-grandmother. It's from 1890, and I'd like to take it apart, and throw everything on the floor. No offense to your great-grandmother, but when I see a clock like this, I want to know what it looks like on the inside.
Once upon a time there was a girl named Ella. She looked at the world not always as it really was, but as it could be - with a little magic.
I think she can fix it, David. Wait, what? I hacked your signal and every time you turn it on, I can see it there. And it started to flicker and the percentages went down, David.
- Yes. I don't understand. The operating system controls the computer. The OS in a sense is it. Then how did it work?
The right computer... Easy to use and not prickly, One that adorns the desk like an elegant lamp. The right computer will become a bicycle for the mind. Do you like it? I was given away. But what if it goes not only into the right hands, But to everyone?
We will. Villas ... Look at the moon. - What is there? - He is red.
There, there! Yeah, I've heard that too. It's like a weird clicking sound or something. Yeah, check over there. - I don't know where it's coming from.

Most only feel sorry for the children. To us they brought a nice little girl sympathetically. I work there in the hospital. She drew a funny picture. I will show it. Where is he?
And if it is not a crime, why are we even talking about it? Because it is for the suggestion to the jurors that such an allegation exists, even unproven, and denigrates him. - They need a portrait of such a person that they can present to the jury as having no chance of being cleared. In this way, they poison the atmosphere so that the jury does not focus on the charges, but on this atmosphere created by the government, which is an attempt to appeal to emotion and divert attention. In this way, if the evidence is weak, the credit does not go to the accused, who is entitled to it according to the presumption of innocence, but the government gets it, because there are such terrible things lurking around, which admittedly have nothing to do with the case,
Well, yes. Why don't you use one of these tools. You have some. I thought the volcano was in a dormant state. He was, but now he's not.
Not bad. Peter O'Toole. Very skinny, but smug. - This is a statue of Mary Tyler Moore. - Yes, that's him.
I would have been more credible as a husband. You were the one who snagged the costume when you played Downton Abbey. They gave it to me. And no one will believe you're straight anyway. Just the fact that you're standing on that carpet makes it gay.

- Jester! Just when I thought I was going to be hanged, yes. Thanks for that. You had to give the letter to Molloy to write for you. - What is he talking about?
We have to stop it. People could die. The whole hospital shuts down. We designed the malware in such a way that the only way to end it is to control the kill switch. - Where is it?
"...Did I think I was going to die?" As much as possible YES. And this is what you need to know, because it will happen to you too. This is the cosmos. He is not cooperating.
Please listen carefully. Bring him to the grove. But be careful, he will not go there willingly. He has tasted human pleasures. And what about Will? The only way out is to bring the changeling, but please don't let him know anything. He can sense intentions.
I did not desire such an outcome. Lord Rear Admiral Kensington. I don't have to explain to you his desire to achieve the greatest possible resonance from this proceeding. He will put on a show here. And once he starts, I will not be able to control its course.

And you must never use the devil's speech thoughtlessly. Do not let this language become a daily occurrence for you, because soon he will glorify himself with it through you.
They claim that machines from the '70s did not have this option. Yet some models had it. This can be seen in Bush documents released by the White House. Like this one from 1968. Some analysts outside CBS recognized New Times Roman, a typeface unavailable in the '70s. But the owner of the company distributing the typeface claims it has been around since 1931.

With me, you have a chance to defeat her. Without me, she will take your daughter and make her a slave. She will suffer as I suffered, never knowing her mother and father, because Dahlia will turn you to dust. Are you done yet? If there is to be an alliance between us, it will be on my terms....
/We can hold on to the past / or accept / the inevitability of change.... / allow / a better future to come. /Such an uncertain future may require / equally uncertain alliances. /A new day is coming, whether we like it or not. /The question is / will you control it? /Or will he / control you?

But like most criminals, you made the mistake of using a disposable to write a message to Zoey's father. The serial number from that phone led us straight to you. You can't prove any of what you say.

He pushed out the healthy tissue, removed the brain matter from his path to find space for himself. How to remove it without destroying the brain around it, how to kill the baby without killing the mother? I look at these scans, and the tumor looks at me, tempting me to try to remove it. This tumor is bold and brazen. This tumor thinks he's in charge.
Jason, not now. Lying. There is no secret, clear? Terry, do we have a secret? He is a secret even to me.

I understand that she has been through a lot, but she needs to prepare for "Face the Nation." I'll try to find time for that this afternoon. And it's not that we're exaggerating.

We had expended so much energy on this whole pursuit, and now it was over.

You can put down the knife. What's your name? Paul. And I'm not putting the knife down until you heal my brother and we go out the door. Okay, I'm just saying you don't need it.
Yes, we are trying to find out what ails your wife. She's having a muscle-wasting seizure. Okay, what does that mean? If it spreads to her brain, it may eventually give up and start shutting down.
Let's say in 20 minutes? That will require full commitment. 10? Yes. 10 I lost your engagement ring today. I tried it on, and it fell off my finger.
There is law and order here. It's hell. So what law and order are you talking about? That's the system here. It is the one that entered our childhood and put guns in our hands.
In the second from the bottom. Bottom. You are very beautiful. Now your test is back. He is negative.
It's a smart home. Is it as smart as a squid? - Squid? - Because it can sweep itself into a hole. He works in such a way that....
- Absolutely, baby. I never saw the point in funerals. Nice people gather in the church, and the priest tells a lot of nonsense about what a good person you were.w No, take me to the recycling. The purple garbage can, isn't it for plastic and dead grandparents?
This is a nation based on genocide and built on the backs of slaves. Shifting borders. They call it American imperialism. Obama did not create this movement. He created it.
- He has ... The ability to see at night. - They have a night vision system? This tiger has night vision goggles? He does not have night vision goggles. He just has natural night ... -Listen, just stay clear,
He is approaching. Go, go, go, friend! Go, go, buddy! Be careful, be careful! He is coming at you!
I've been reading a bit about common pregnancy problems after 40, and found this drug. But I didn't find much about it. It's called Cruvenae.... Cruvenae-tenuestrin. There was not much about it because it is still in the testing phase.
They work in conjunction with this. Here. That is, "What is above is the same as what is below." It is considered that this phrase is the key to all magic. It means that. what is inside me is also outside.
I would have gone, but I didn't know Sofi. This is just an exception to the rule. A mistake, it must be an ordinary mistake. A statistically impossible element. If I drop the phone a thousand times a million times and one time it doesn't fall to the ground, just once, it will float in the air, that's an error worth looking at more closely.
Don't you have a TV? Then what do you do after work? Uh, you know, last night for example, I, uh.... made Jules this necklace. He's, uh, made from the grains of sand that you were standing on when I first saw you.
I spent a couple of hours in the hospital wing. The prisoner in the bed next to me got hot water in his face. Yes... And they sprinkled it with sugar. Why sugar? He burns the skin after the face dries. It's a trademark of the Monk family.
We never went again, which meant that we never, in fact, spoke again. You understand, our common language, gone. So, I don't ... don't understand. I... you know, I don't think I want to know how things stand in it. But I do understand soccer, and what it means.
Jeb. Thank you. Your honor, I am very sorry. Your honor, when the district sold this land to my client, the financial benefits of this project were known. It will bring millions of dollars in profit to a city on the verge of bankruptcy.
It wouldn't surprise me if the killer was from the States. Did this guy stalk Ahneesah before he killed her? Anonymous gifts, notes, phone calls. Ahneesah reported it, but the Windsor police didn't do much. She didn't know who he was and the guy hadn't broken any laws.
- I'm a terrible company. So am I. I didn't come to chat. - Where's your ring? - Huh? Oh, he ... Is in the safety deposit box.
But I am. But I assure you that I am not only a doctor. - Can this cipher be broken? - Probably, in the end, yes. However, it is extraordinarily complex.
Rotten Spit - there is a place where it is possible to land. And how will they find out that she is there? Transmitter. There is definitely a transmitter on her. Then find it! Job - give the backpack! There is a compass there. He will respond!
I said... I'm not quite sure, Crowe. It's a bit awkward. Everyone thinks that I have the power to invent new facts when old ones become dangerous. That if they share their trouble with me, it will disappear.
If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be here today. But if I met her today, we wouldn't be able to walk the streets together without hurting either of us. These are the realities of your world. The integration program is not perfect. But it has shown me that there are more people here similar to the aforementioned girl than to the Red Hawks.
We call it "negligible proximity." Yeah, well, the rest of the world calls it stalking. What you see here are aerial surveillance shots of Bawri Tan, a naval outpost or what's left of it. It was attacked by a suicide bomber at eight in the morning, local time. The charge killed twelve sailors and wounded another forty-five, making it the bloodiest attack on U.S. forces since the Bagram air base hit two years ago.
Wait. All the pawns have the same color. This would make it hard to play chess. This chess set does not hide a bomb. He is the bomb.
We couldn't see where you were! We couldn't wait. Not after all he went through! You know I loved that ring. In that case, where the hell is he?
I was confused. But I didn't have time to be confused, because I was at the bottom of my list, and I had to hurry if I wanted to fix my life. It's almost 7:00, aren't you going to eat? I can't, I have to finish my essay, and make sure it captures my brand.
Excuse me? Kurt said something to you that made you laugh. Listen. Your problem is not in me. He is in your husband.
How long have you owned the workshop? For four generations. It's amazing. It's not just a playground for the rich. He is for all of us.
The girl on the right is Samantha Royce. A student at the University of Arizona. The one on the left is Mackenzie Bradshaw, daughter of Tom Bradshaw, Arizona's senior senator and chairman of the foreign relations committee. This is about the Geo-9 satellite, which is being sold to Mexico? The Mexican government hopes it will help protect its borders if the committee votes in favor.
Will you stop with the cups and blankets? That's how they comfort victims in the movies. I hereby forbid the use of coins on campus. You really think it will help... Your three cents is coinage, and it's banned.
But I am. But I assure you that I am not only a doctor. - Can this cipher be broken? - Probably, in the end, yes. However, it is extraordinarily complex.
- I think it might have been the kitchen. - Really? It's probably a hearth. Strange. I have no proof that my ancestor visited this castle, but it was within his range of influence, so.... it's possible that he strolled through these halls.
She took all our children. No, you guys don't beat girls, so I knocked her out. I want to thank the whole community for trusting me. I may manage this bank, but it is not mine.
Each time, someone different. Jolene Parker? I already said I don't know the names. My husband hides a key in the house. What is it for?
Something very strange happened today. I followed her to the cafe and I'm not quite sure what I saw, but I think she had some kind of soreness. due to pregnancy. That's what it looked like, but it's about what happened next. She reached for the coffee and I swear, she didn't touch the cup and he moved away from her hand.
But you always have, my sovereign. Focus. I have to get to that train. - Welcome to the club. - Where is he?
- I have no idea. - You are hiding. I assure you I'm not lying. My brother trapped me in a jar as soon as we put you on the train. I don't know where he is.
Close the door. - Where are the Elders? - I notified them about an important matter in the Sector so that we could explain everything to each other without unnecessary distractions. You wanted to tell them about what you saw on the flight recorder, right? Where is it?
Let them go, I'll bring it to you. I have a better idea. You will lead me to him. Now. This is where I hid the flight recorder. So... where is it?
Yes, I'm Detective Williams from Five-O. I have to ask you, do you have any rifle on board? We do. We use it to hunt sharks. What is the problem? Please show me where it is.
Kilogram was also destroyed. Impossible! The container is crushed and the bell shattered. And the kilogram itself? He...
Since neither of us knows what you really mean, I think your attempts to create new clones should burn out. - I want the key to your cipher. - I worked on it for 20 years. - It is rather good. - Where is it?
I think you need killer pins. Yes. I got these GPS records for the Benjamin case. It turns out Erica didn't have her phone. And you'll be curious to know where he was.
It still wouldn't have worked out. Of course it would have worked out. It's impossible. Some things can't be undone. As much as you would like to silence the bell, it will still ring.
These traces are 260 million years old. So would you like to know the age of the Earth? Figure out how long it takes to embed each layer and then, instead of counting "genealogical lists," add all the layers. Simple, right? But there's one problem, we know from observing this process because it's still going on in oceans and lakes around the world, that sediments can settle at different rates.
Lead is neurotoxic. Before you transport your tetraethyl lead from the factory.... and you add it to gasoline.... it is treated as a chemical weapon. There is a reason for that. Where do you think all that lead goes after it leaves the tailpipe? Think about what it can do to us and our children.
From now on, we will go with the flow already. translation: Necromanthe consultation: cat84 What timing. I have a small problem. Would you like to know what it concerns?
I was struck by a few facts about Walt Yeager. What are they? Single, owner of a thriving business. He owns a house on the south bank of the city. So why would a man like him get into robbery?
It's one of those buildings with drawers on the walls where they keep people's ashes. I'll need a court order for those ashes. I want to find that ring. I can get you a warrant. But it may not be from the court.
I don't think you're the best judge in this regard. No, no, the point is that I.... need a little help. I'm a little lost. I... I can't find my car. What does it look like?
Let me help you. When I was in Vietnam, they told me who the enemy was, and I believed them. But when I returned home, do you know what I saw? What? I saw the real enemy.... and it is right in front of us.
Tell me more. It all made me dong. I guess you meant dazed? No,I meant dong. You hit the gong, it makes a "dong" sound and then you realize something.
Apparently, you want to talk. Take a seat, Simone. We have a letter for you. A letter signed by the chief of Strathclyde Police. It says that we know that you are living with Malcolm John Webster.
Just... so much chaos, you know? But... You found it. No. No, he was given to me.
Droids and grammar, I could write a book about it, except that.... you're practically not a droid anymore. There's more of the human in you than the machine. So tell me... what do you think of the view? It is beautiful.
War hero. Not enough shots fired at you overseas? I have a necklace. Let it go. So? Where is it?
- Obvious. - Stop, you've seen it for yourself. Scott reads only one page of the reconnaissance report before handing it over. So we will get Abe's letter and put it in such a report. It will then flow directly into Swift's hands.
Check your mail. Did you send this from my account? You are to stop using it. Where did it come from? I posted a picture of the symbol on Reddit asking what it means.
Hannah! - There's a spider in there. - It can't be that bad. - Wait until you see it. - Where is he? Wait until you see.
Is it possible for a while? What a varied day. The return of Francis, news of the Queen's death.... and this. News from the Vatican. If this letter confirms Sebastian's legitimacy he should take away any reservations you have about the bastard on your side, instead of the king who will one day be Bash.
/It takes over you. /The frenzy. /You try to let go. / I prayed for it. /But it consumes you.
When Pam found me in France I felt the same as you-- nihilistic, prepared to die. Wanting to die. This virus is not just destroying your body.... It's not because of the virus, Eric. No one talks about it, but it attacks.... It attacks your soul.
I am you. Rapunzel, it's not the witch. It's you. You said it appeared after you took the Night Root. You thought it didn't work, but it did.
They hide somewhere in the night depths. They work hard for their livelihoods, but each a little shiver wants, they will pay anything to roll the dice this one last time. Someone will win, someone will lose. Someone was born to play the blues. And this movie doesn't end, it keeps going, and going, and going, and going.
I don't believe it! I know he was depressed about the whole sewage thing. You don't have to thank me. It's just a small thing to brighten his day. My day isn't brightened, he's blinded!
- Right. How's the diary? Listen, don't be angry, but I stopped keeping it. It's your diary. It was helpful when I was struggling with all this, but I don't anymore.... So... neither did he.
- Human blood is salty and sweet. I know from experience if you cut off a woman's breast, it looks like a coconut milk filter. Full of holes. There was a woman communist. She lived with her brother but he was not a communist.
/Hello, pastor. / Or rather, Kingston? /This is such an intimate moment that we should address each other as "you. /Before you know it, I will make good use of the time spent with your son. /I will give him a lecture on the nature of true faith. /It will not be directed only to him, but also to you, / your sheep / and the whole world.
They all... They are those who refused to leave their homes.... ..so their houses were burned down.... ..and they died in them.... ..it was people like me who raised their voices and were silenced. And no one did anything? And what were they supposed to do? This cancer is plaguing not only this region. He has spread all over the country.
Each ring is recognizable by a pebble. So are those who wear them. Klaus thinks you own a white oak peg. But we don't have it. It doesn't matter because if they think you have it that means they don't know where it is.
Nice. What else do you have? You're wasting your time, Voldemort. I'm as much a part of this Warehouse as you are, - and he won't let you kill me.
If I died, he would be delivered home. He would not have died with me in the ground. Everyone wants his farewell to reach home. That's why I kept him. I promised myself that I would deliver him to you. Where is he?
- It is! - What: No, if you dim my brilliance in any way we will have a problem. Allison, you are in charge of choosing the theme of the ball, it has to be perfect and magical and look expensive, but cost nothing. Do you have any ideas?
I knew you would make the right decision. What is it? A very special necklace. Every witch in the congregation wears one. Guard it like an eye in your head, because, in many ways, it now constitutes your life.
Have you ever seen it? No. All I know is that he was very worried about him. He wanted to give him to someone who understood him. Where else could he be?
Where else can it be? I don't know. I don't even know what we're looking for. He didn't go all this way without him so he must be somewhere here. While he was talking about it, he tried to get up from the bed, as if he was trying to show where he was.
/And what on earth was he doing here, in this remote area? He wouldn't be the first to show up here looking for easy money, Mr. Stokes said. /The loot from the theft was never recovered. Somewhere here a million-dollar treasure is just waiting to be discovered. According to local accounts he is still here somewhere.
- We had to let Vulcan go free. What? ! What happened? His lawyers claim that he is not the one in the photo. And since there are no cars registered to Vulcan, we can't prove it's him.
It is a choice. You are what you choose Choice gives you who you are. Do you know what you have chosen? Then hold on to that choice because it is your salvation.
- Jewel. - Jewel? Bring me the jewel. God's jewel. Where is it?
Well, you know, I put your photo in my bed on Instagram, but.... I won't say anything to her. It's just one night. We're not a couple. Besides, she's probably calling to talk about her sex life, not to ask about mine. JT, the gem that keeps Vincent from transforming, where is he?
I will not succeed without your help. I need money and resources. The money is already in your account. Here you have a hard drive with all the Simmons research. Coulson's and Skye's blood analysis, all the data on the drug. If there is a key to understanding this, it is here.
Spoiler alert. We're not likely to find any. I think we found one. Garrett and Cybertek have worked together for years. - If it is in Garrett's system....
This fragment of animal bone that Finn gave me is a piece of narwhal tusk. What is the narwhal tusk fragment doing in the remains? That's what I can't explain. And to complicate the matter I did a test with radioactive carbon. He is at least 1,000 years old.
So where are we making a mistake? Cheryl didn't kill Harry. Yes, it looks that way, but I'm not giving up. I know that the real killer is somewhere in that log of club members who were there on the day of the murder. We have that document here, but it won't help us.
Have you learned anything about this adoption agency? Not much. When Putin made it illegal for Americans to adopt Russian children, Angels of Kirov kind of disappeared. I still can't get to the phone either, but it turns out that in fact.... It turns out that in reality it does not belong to the victim.
- We thought it was Josh. - But that's impossible, because Josh wouldn't talk about his father using his last name. - He would refer to him as "dad." - Exactly. If the dead type is not Josh, why does John say it's him?
And the grease fire during the Fourth of July parade? I drove into the car wash, extinguished the fire and made it in time for the overture Year 1812. From your words, it seems to be a death trap. No, I say that this car is indestructible. After the apocalypse, only he, my mother and the cockroaches will survive in this world.
You are a cultural anthropologist. What is it? Wilt Chamberlain's Jersey number. Yes, this symbol was found at the crime scene today. - He means something. - Bottom line.
- No, well that's $1,800, I won't buy this car. This car is part of your life. Only to you does it have any meaning.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to welcome the esteemed board members and members of our renowned department. Tonight we have the honor of presenting the museum's newest acquisition. An extremely rare specimen. And although it cost no small amount, we believe this new exhibit will attract thousands of visitors from all over the world.
No one is hiding anything. That's just the way we are. And you carry your shame inside you. You have tightly locked it inside you. And it eats you up. It feeds on you like a parasite until there is nothing left but rot.
- That you don't have to pay me for anything. - No, I have to. According to my sponsor, I have to be responsible. Don't interfere with my program, okay? He is working.
When Dad retired, he resold it, but the guy only had it for a few weeks. Please tell me you remember his name. I don't. But I remember that he was smug, and I remember that I gave up a great number. What was he like...?
It was clear that something was weighing heavily on his heart, and he needed my help to free himself. - That's how I understand my job, detective. - Isn't that what confession is for? Well, I am a proponent of ritual. But he doesn't always give people what they want.
No. He was trained to hide his emotions. He's like a closed book. And I'm pretty sure he never mentioned Iraq. PTSD, paranoia. After all, you know that people like him can't control themselves all the time.
You attended medical school in Guam. Before that, you worked as a mortician, and you wear a 300+ year old pocket watch. So, Henry Morgan, what is your story? I won't bore you with the details, but this watch, is a gift. Legend has it that it belonged to a doctor sailing from Africa.
The moon is not falling apart. The moon is hatching! The moon is an egg. Does he... Has he always ... Was he an egg?
What kind of soldier would I be if I died with a bullet in my magazine? 50 seconds. Somebody shut him up! I didn't even flinch. Where is he?
But there must be some other way. There is always a way. It depends on how many ways you can handle. There is a spyware program that I used to use. He could make a gap in Arcadia's security, give me remote access.
Wait here. Do you have a basement where you could hide? We don't have a basement. - We can hide in the church. - Where is it?
He carries this suitcase to access the bank's system remotely. I was counting on you to say that. What about Natasha's key? It's an encrypted flash drive with a code. You put it in your laptop, it loads a program that gives us access to all the bank's data.
- I know you will find it useful. - May I take a peek, officer? Why did you bring him here? - He had a register. - Where is he?
Fatigue, dizziness and shortness of breath. This is nitrate poisoning. A few milligrams can be toxic, come on in this case fatal. So which one of these clowns should I beat up for trying to kill me? When you stop taking nitrate, it will naturally leave your body.
Sure, connect me with the councilman. Okay, keep me posted. Hello, Councilman... Do we have anything about that writing on the wall? We put it into the translator.... and it means roughly:
Bring it on! Wake up! Where is the moon? He's gone! I became a guard and he died! .
Then there are super-fans that are part of the series family. And then there are psychic super-fans who end up hiding in your closet. Yes. That's why the container is in my name.... So that the psychic super-fans don't smell that it belongs to Jon.
I know this from autopsy. But the stories that drive us sometimes also blind us. They lead us into a darkness where I can beat up a good person just for fun. The people who love me pull me off the edge. Once you touch that darkness, it never goes away.
I suppose you made it? I will do whatever I have to do to get my sister back. I can see that you care a lot about her. I'm sorry about her necklace. Where is it?
Governor, the helplessness that you feel Will prompt you to behave irrationally. So I ask you to resist the temptation to do something stupid. As it stands in my way. You will let me do my job I checked the avg scanner, but it did not indicate anything. if we can find the signature in the digital code it will tell us who sent this virus.
But let's see what happens when I simply squeeze the juice from these four. Here you go, here are four apples. That's sugar straight from four apples in one glass. Wait, one apple is about 4 teaspoons of sugar, so here we have 16 teaspoons of sugar in this one glass. You see, nature has equipped us with the perfect little set, and it has all the nutrients, the fiber that tells us when we're full, and the right amount of sugar included.
I ate a very sweet chicken the previous evening. It's safe to say that my body is feeling a little sluggish and waiting for another sugar shot. They called it great: "UpGo" with this I will start my day today. With banana flavor and ee.... about 4 to 5 teaspoons of sugar. It was obvious that sugar was affecting me physically, but the real surprise was the effect it had on my moods.
Society has changed. 200 years ago, there was not a single society in the world where, on holidays, the menu and beverage list was based on sugar. Today, it's synonymous with any celebration. But more significantly, it is one of the easiest ways to show love. I think the reason sugar has become so ingrained is that it evokes love.
When we feel bad, what do we do? We eat some sugar, "Oh, I'm better already." If there is not enough sweetness in our lives, there is not enough love.... "Oh, I'll have a piece of chocolate." Since sugar has such complex connections to our hearts, minds and bodies, I suspect it has a much broader cultural framework than we previously thought.
- Am I a bad person? - Meaning - Take the money. Take the check - No. He is not free
Central America, then. - Perhaps more precisely? - No. Do you remember the extra gene I found in the virus? All this time I've been wondering where it came from.
- I'm Lauren. - It's nice to meet you. How can I help you? Well, I had a cough for a few weeks. I thought it was a cold and would pass on its own, but it reached a critical point.
This carpet costs $120 for 100 meters. And how much do you lose per day on the tables? Well. To avoid the cost of new camera wiring, such pressure pads, put under the carpet will be connected to the Brownian program I wrote. It is based on the principle that people by nature walk random paths.
That's great. Then what's the problem? We ran a standard file search on Chauvenet and came across this. I recognize this address. If you replace the number 13 in the file name with the word "thirteen", - it becomes an anagram.
You know I'm a butcher, right? I need to talk to you. Duke will be here soon. I'm looking for Lorelei's notebook. Do you know where it is?
I want him to ask a girl to dance, she agreed, and I do not want his heart.... Okay, we're going to the disco, ladies handsome! Can you moan quieter, please? God, I have a breakdown, Axl, I have a strong breakdown. I was riding a coffee pony, and he took me to the depths of hell.
When it's all over. With pleasure. May hates coffee. See? It looks like... a little disease. - A virus. - A virus, yes, and it goes through.... through the entire electronic system.
We know that HYDRA is looking for evidence that this is alien writing. This is not good. No, it isn't. And that's not the worst of it all. Future analysis of the image he is indeed 500 years old.
This is crazy! I found a trace of "Zarzew" in its connections. It's a virus. He must have kept the virus inactive thanks to his neurochips. Its infiltration was unexpectedly fast. It combines the memories of past resentment against objects that have been implanted with false memories.
You know I'm a butcher, right? I need to talk to you. Duke will be here soon. I'm looking for Lorelei's notebook. Do you know where it is?
It will be two years already? How time flies. We will listen for a long time.... A sound other than your voice, how happy it makes me. Where did he come from, Damon?
Say you have the key. I left it in the ignition, and now it's gone. - Say you have the fucking key! - I don't have the key. - Where is it?
So if, for example, I wanted to know the content of your e-mails, or, for example, your wife's phone calls, or something similar, All I need is to use a so-called selector. Anything in the communication chain that would allow me to identify you as an individual fairly accurately. I'm thinking of things like email address, IP numbers, phone numbers, payment cards, and even passwords that only you and no one else use. I can enter this into the system and it will not only search the existing database, according to the pattern:
You want me to see you as a psychopath, but I don't buy it. You have a mission. You have to find the ether that William hid. - Someone finally initiated you. - What is it used for?
- pow-wow. - You said it! Detective Peralta, you reportedly found some new evidence in the case yesterday. I obtained the plunging evidence. It was hidden in an old window pane in the defendant's apartment.
Oh no. The program hacked your laptop. The delete sequence is not working. It is resisting. What was it doing?
By cutting them? They are in danger. I lived there. - I know. - What they need my help. You don't believe in the spirit world, but it exists.
Until I got a hint from a helper. Heart. If you need my help in getting it then know that I will only help you leave this carcass. But you will help me, you will help me. You see, this spell will finally separate me from the dagger, and it will no longer have power over me.
Who sent you? What do you know? Nobody sent me. It sent me. This object, it sent me.
The obvious issue. What about the artifact? We need to find it. Whoever stole it is long gone. Someone must know where it is.
Think I can borrow the object Lucky car of the king? No. Not unless you have something he wants. The speed of the router is ten times what it was. It will never break down, and as of now it is free.
Before he was arrested, Rex dropped the software into a woman's shopping bag. and contacted me just before I was picked up. What did you do? I hacked into the data of that store, what's its name?
Do you have it? It's right here. It's pebbles from the mine. - What - where is he?
/It started out as a simple joke.... / and ended in murder. /They thought they had succeeded in burying the past.... / but this Halloween, they will find out / that evil breeds evil! Let me introduce you to our killer, Jack Knife. Released in 1984, it was described by critics as a copy of John Carpenter's "Halloween" film. However, in recent years, it has rightfully become an object of adoration....
I'm the same guy. I protect nature. And, as you pointed out, I'm a businessman. I understand the law of supply and demand. As long as there is a market, and there will always be a market, there will be people willing to meet the demand.
Let's arrest the bastard. He's ready for it. And frankly, you won't have to put up with his lawyer. Why? Who is he?
Well, Gwen, I am glad to say that it is clear that you are not involved in any criminal activity. Be polite. Eat safely. Put the fake phones in her room. She will show you where he is.
He always had a cigarette in his mouth, a cowboy hat, you know? And he would take off his hat, he would do that, turn around, and then ride off into the desert for a while. We dragged a horse inside the Rancho once. We thought it would be fun. And he just started dropping his load all over the floor.
Liv. Have fun with your missus. Well. Where is the last piece? Where is he?
He told me that during his imprisonment there, he shared a cell with a man who was a great dream explainer. /A man who could predict the future. Could it be that he was talking about you? I've been plagued by the same dream for months. You tell me what it means and I will spare your life.
I have something better. By measuring the ash burn all the way through, we can determine whether the jet was accelerating or decelerating, so to speak. I? Pointer to pointer, the burn concentration dropped to 20%. - Wait, so he was slowing down? - Fast.
