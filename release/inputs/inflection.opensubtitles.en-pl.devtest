It's a delay. That's all.<eos> Just to get through this.<eos> I'm tired of being the one fighting for us, Lise.<eos> If this isn't something that you want, you need to say so.<eos> It is.<eos> I ran the numbers twice.<eos> The money Cardinal used to buy chips is straight from the bank.<eos> It doesn't come from Corbett.<eos> He's laundering his own money?<eos> Clean money?

Some kinda, I don't know, philosophical objection.<eos> We'll need his address.<eos> Yeah. Sure. Give me a sec.<eos> Look, I'm gonna post someone here.<eos> If Eric happens to come before the officer arrives, I want you not to tell him we were here.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> You just step away and call me.<eos> All right. I'll get a patrol here.<eos> Call Flower, see what CPIC has on Fraser.<eos> What?
No. He must have another space.<eos> Get a BOLO out.<eos> Hello? Is the basement clean?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You flushed the drains?<eos> You did everything I said?<eos> Yeah. I did.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> What's wrong? You need to get Keith out of your house.<eos> What?
That's Katie Pine.<eos> One labelled "January".<eos> Todd Curry.<eos> Nothing for this month.<eos> No Keith.<eos> He hasn't finished with him yet.<eos> And they're all close-ups.<eos> Could be taken anywhere. Yeah, but where does he process them?<eos> He needs space, power, water. Not some hole in the ground.<eos> What?
I think she just left.<eos> You can probably still catch her.<eos> Ah. I'll give her a call.<eos> You must be proud of her.<eos> She's done really well here.<eos> Yeah. I'm-I'm a lucky guy.<eos> I'll catch up with her tonight. - Okay.<eos> - Yeah. - Good to see ya. - Yeah.<eos> No, no, it's-it's in the freezer, like a Thanksgiving turkey.<eos> What on earth for?
Anything on Edie Soames?<eos> DB was her grandmother.<eos> The BOLO's gone out and roadblocks are in place.<eos> I should get back to the office.<eos> I have very clear instructions from Dyson, you're to go home.<eos> John, we'll find her.<eos> Go home.<eos> Pour yourself a drink.<eos> Save some glory for the rest of us.<eos> What?
It worked once.<eos> Maybe because he wanted it to.<eos> Maybe.<eos> It could kill you, James.<eos> Or do you even care anymore?<eos> The hell's that supposed to mean?<eos> You're different now... unwilling to face the hard choices in front of you.<eos> Hey, you have no idea the choices I've had to make.<eos> There it is.<eos> What?
-That means subways, that means buses...<eos> -It's fine, I know him.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - What? This is my stop.<eos> -Well, you look well. -Well, I can't complain.<eos> Can't complain, except...<eos> Well, I'm sure you heard about Tim.<eos> Corbet? No.<eos> -Beth didn't call?<eos> Oh, man.
Tim went out on the Arkansas River.<eos> He's been missing for two days now.<eos> I thought for sure the president would have heard.<eos> I mean, I can't imagine how Frank's gonna take this.<eos> Oh, my goodness! Beth and the kids must be so distraught. Sure.<eos> But Frank and Tim's relationship was special.<eos> It's great to see you, Claire.<eos> Would you ask Frank to give me a call?<eos> -Mrs. Underwood?<eos> -Uh, just one moment.
...right here. And I'm thinking... "Wait, do I tell him?<eos> Do--"<eos> Uh, I gotta take this.<eos> Hey.<eos> Your testimony can't be private.<eos> -I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> -Just wanted to let you know.<eos> What's a "flash blood warning"?<eos> It's coming up on everybody's phones.<eos> Thanks for the drinks.
I wasn't his type?<eos> Never.<eos> And that's what hurt the most.<eos> Well there mustâve been something he liked.<eos> I can't decide, you see, how much you knew.<eos> About who, and what, he was.<eos> I'm learning.<eos> Let me help you then.<eos> Ask me a question.<eos> Any question.
Speak to him yourself.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I wanted to see if you knew of the apartment.<eos> Can I talk to you at the police station, Mrs. Clios?<eos> Shall I send a car?<eos> No, I'll follow him.<eos> Here's a list of potential new clients.<eos> Our investors are spooked.<eos> We need to show some money coming in.<eos> For example?
Once you're paid off?<eos> Why would you say something like that?<eos> Do you want me to leave?<eos> I don't know what I want.<eos> But I do know that people leave me when I like them.<eos> There should be a word for it, Madame.<eos> A word for what, Patrice?<eos> For the unblemished portion of wall upon which a picture. Once rested...<eos> So you noticed?<eos> Some time ago.
No, of course not.<eos> We would have seen.<eos> There are infra-red alarms set every night.<eos> Also, each of the works in the Gallery has its individual sound sensor.<eos> How far back do these go?<eos> The seven steps, five months since the new system was installed.<eos> Who is that?<eos> What's he doing?<eos> I imagine he needed access to the room.<eos> Which room?
An unreasonable banker.<eos> I assume we would be gentle with him?<eos> I wouldn't tell you how to do your job.<eos> You really have come a long way, Jakob.<eos> You owe me, Robert. Hey!<eos> What a nice surprise.<eos> You owe me for the Tiepolo cartoon, for covering your ass, for covering your forgery.<eos> Hey, alright, look, I'm not gonna argue with you.<eos> You owe me, Robert, and you have the fucking temerity to act like I'm other people?<eos> What, George?
Now, I know you've seen a lot of crazy over the years... but I've never seen you scared.<eos> All right, you gonna tell me what we're up against here?<eos> The past.<eos> Your past, my past.<eos> Eight years ago, you were running this city with an iron fist.<eos> Well, you had a lot of witches terrified at every single turn.<eos> I was protecting Davina...<eos> Yeah, well, I had something to protect, too.<eos> And I wanted to take you down, Marcel.<eos> For my wife.

- Thank you.<eos> Now look, the only gratitude I need from any of you is seeing you leave the city.<eos> Go see your daddy.<eos> What is this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mom?<eos> Can you hear that?<eos> It's... whispers.<eos> Saying a name.<eos> Over and over.
But... the thing they idolized... the Hollow... it must have wanted us there.<eos> It wanted to come into our world by anchoring itself to one of us.<eos> So that makes me wonder... did we end it?<eos> Or is it just getting started?<eos> You think it's gonna come after me?<eos> Marcel, I'm-a tell you, man.<eos> I wonder if it hasn't already got to you.<eos> What did you see when you was in the circle?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Not a thing.
I'm no expert, but I'm guessing you're going through some kind of psychological break right now.<eos> You've been through hell.<eos> So your mind took you somewhere peaceful,<eos> Honestly, I'm flattered you thought of me.<eos> Figured your happy place would be somewhere with Elijah.<eos> So... if I'm unconscious, then I need to wake up.<eos> I know.<eos> I know. I'm on your side.<eos> We'll get you back in the fight, before the Hollow finishes whatever she started.<eos> Hey, buddy.
I know.<eos> I know. I'm on your side.<eos> We'll get you back in the fight, before the Hollow finishes whatever she started.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Are my mom and dad back?<eos> Not quite.<eos> Hey, you know what I used to do, when I was bored at your age?<eos> Magic.<eos> I'm not supposed to do magic with strangers.<eos> What?
It's very important, and I'll be right back.<eos> I imagine right now you're rather cross with me.<eos> You should know I have my reasons.<eos> Rebekah suggested I hear them.<eos> I'd rather rip out your vocal chords.<eos> Hey, sorry, we're closed.<eos> Well, maybe you can make an exception.<eos> Davina? I don't know how long I have, but I had to see you to thank you.<eos> Wh-What do you mean? Thank me?<eos> For what?
The Hollow brought her back, and now they're linked.<eos> I just need a bloody second to set her free.<eos> Lovesick imbecile.<eos> The Hollow preys upon your weakness.<eos> She raised Davina to get you to betray your family, and you, pathetic as you are, leapt at the chance.<eos> Our family owes Davina that much.<eos> I owe nothing to her.<eos> Nor to you.<eos> You saw it:<eos> the violence, the rage.
I don't like to sleep when things are happening.<eos> You woke Elijah. Yes.<eos> And he's very excited to see you.<eos> In the morning, hmm?<eos> There's nothing to worry about anymore, okay?<eos> You didn't punish Kol.<eos> Well... he's family.<eos> And we protect family.<eos> Like you and mom are my protectors, right?<eos> Always and forever.
And he's very excited to see you.<eos> In the morning, hmm?<eos> There's nothing to worry about anymore, okay?<eos> You didn't punish Kol.<eos> Well... he's family.<eos> And we protect family.<eos> Like you and mom are my protectors, right?<eos> Always and forever.<eos> Tomorrow, I'm going to show you everything I love about New Orleans.<eos> The music, the dancing, the art.
Lying there, dead.<eos> Your blood on my hands and I... couldn't save you. Hey.<eos> You got me. Exhausted, but still alive.<eos> Right in front of you.<eos> I just kept thinking about all the things I didn't tell you.<eos> Everything that I feel for you.<eos> What is it you feel about me, Freya Mikaelson?<eos> Then I'll get to the point.<eos> I know that the deal was for my family to leave town once our enemy was defeated, but... there may be opportunities lost if we stick to those terms.<eos> Opportunities. What opportunities, exactly?
Elijah?<eos> Things between us are complicated.<eos> Well, that's a word often used to describe my brother.<eos> But his feelings for you are quite simple.<eos> He adores you, Hayley.<eos> I know that.<eos> And I know the sacrifices he's made for me, for this family.<eos> He's saved us all at various times.<eos> I saw things, Rebekah, in his mind.<eos> Not just memories.
I've killed you once, Elijah.<eos> I won't hesitate to do so again.<eos> Inadu.<eos> Show yourself.<eos> What's the matter...<eos> The big, bad Hollow too scared to face me?<eos> I hide from no one.<eos> Especially not some would-be king of New Orleans.<eos> That is vicious.<eos> Even for you.
I should never have brought her back here.<eos> A thousand years ago, we three made an eternal vow.<eos> To protect each other, always and forever.<eos> Freya, that vow now includes you.<eos> As it includes my daughter.<eos> She is my heart and soul.<eos> Right now she's out there, alone in the darkness, fighting.<eos> We can't give up.<eos> So I'm begging you...<eos> All of you...
All right, I want Sofya back.<eos> A reasonable request.<eos> After all, this body will soon be of no use to me.<eos> What do you have to offer in return?<eos> I got this from the Mikaelsons.<eos> And I'm willing to give it to you as an offering, in exchange for my friend.<eos> Then you have a deal.<eos> And you're a wise king.<eos> Perhaps when this is over, I will let you live.<eos> How much longer?
Mom?<eos> Can you hear them, too?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Tell me what you heard.<eos> Voices.<eos> They said that we're connected to this.<eos> You and me.<eos> If this fossil has been whispering lies, I'll gladly throw it in the river.<eos> No. Not the bone.
You want to defeat the Hollow.<eos> So do I.<eos> So do the Ancestors.<eos> But first you need to know what you're up against.<eos> It begins a thousand years before the city was founded.<eos> Two rival tribes decided to combine their power.<eos> They thought that by uniting in peace, they would enter a new age of harmony.<eos> A marriage was arranged.<eos> Two powerful witches joined together to create a unified coven.<eos> Ceccan ulanigv. A ceremonial wedding.
Good thing we brought the German sports car.<eos> Says the man in the $5,000 suit.<eos> Nine... if we're counting.<eos> I'm not a barbarian.<eos> All right, look, your expert better pay off.<eos> Otherwise, we're wasting time that we don't have.<eos> See, that's so very hurtful, Marcellus, and here I thought we were having a marvelous galactic adventure together.<eos> You think you're real cute, don't you?<eos> Yeah, the only reason that you invited me on on this little road trip is so you could play bodyguard.<eos> - Baby-sitter.
Yeah. I don't think so.<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> You have one of the bones already.<eos> The smart play would be to keep them divided, yet still in the hands of an ally you trust.<eos> So I guess you're just gonna have to trust me,<eos> I don't have to trust anyone.<eos> Careful, Elijah.<eos> Your true colors are starting to show.<eos> Yeah. You may talk a big game, but when it comes down to it, you'll always be a poster boy for violence first.<eos> Always and forever.
I'll be seeing you around.<eos> Those for me?<eos> After what you did today, your dad compelled the entire Magnolia candy shop.<eos> Dad seemed sad.<eos> I think that he wanted to be the one doing the helping today.<eos> But we both agreed on one thing:<eos> you were very, very brave.<eos> I just thought about what you would do.<eos> It's like you always say: if we stick together, nothing can hurt us.<eos> Always and forever.
I'm a fuckin' artist with this shit.<eos> I did my toes, too.<eos> See that?<eos> Cheetah.<eos> You know...<eos> Yes. Good.<eos> - Great.<eos> So how much you paying me?<eos> - Twenty dollars a day.<eos> What? Uh-uh.
I think Boo's giving tree actually does more takin' away than giving.<eos> - How so?<eos> - The tree's a sign of goodness.<eos> But when it gets filled with cement, the tree symbolizes what's been taken from Scout, her innocence.<eos> Plus, she's got that dumb name.<eos> Okay, permission slips, people!<eos> I need them before we get on the bus tomorrow.<eos> Uh, Janae, I'd like to speak with you.<eos> Ooh. Watson getting called out.<eos> Yeah, right. For what?
Okay, so what I'm doing now is contour and highlight.<eos> When I wasn't in prison, I would do this with a MAC Pro Palette and a ♪19 fan brush.<eos> But in here, I use three spices that you can find in any kitchen.<eos> - Okay. - Cinnamon... cumin... and Sazón Goya.<eos> Yes, your face will smell like your abuela's pork.<eos> But listen, you gotta make sacrifices if you wanna look DIY fly like me.<eos> First... contour.<eos> Where's the cheese?<eos> Fuck.<eos> What cheese?
Stratman, use the bucket. You're gonna get us all killed.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I can't.<eos> I mean, I can't when there's other people around me.<eos> Since I was a kid.<eos> I need total and utter privacy.<eos> Please! Please let me out!<eos> God. Hey, does anyone here know the brown note?<eos> Is that that jazz club in Harlem?<eos> What?
After they seen my cheetah toes, everybody been fightin' over me.<eos> - You see? I told you you'd kill it. - Yeah.<eos> You called it.<eos> How about you?<eos> Same shit, same day?<eos> Yeah. Something like that.<eos> You all right, girl?<eos> You sound funny.<eos> Listen, I gotta tell you something.<eos> What?
How old?<eos> Donuts the guard.<eos> Do we capture him?<eos> We don't got the gun.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I've eaten rabbits bigger than him.<eos> For real.<eos> There was this weird chemical in the runoff water that ran near our farm.<eos> My guinea pig got too big to pick up.<eos> On three?
Ours and Poussey's.<eos> And you're gonna let some fuckin' white woman, like, karaoke our song.<eos> That's fucked.<eos> I got this.<eos> You get to keep the laptops?<eos> No, we keep them during the year and then we return them so that they can update or replace them over the summer.<eos> Oh, so what did you think of class?<eos> I'm sorry we spent so much time on citations. Erik thinks we need to know MLA, APA and Chicago Manual.<eos> One of these is my brother's.<eos> For chess.
Come on!<eos> Cher's awesome.<eos> And you do like beans.<eos> Who gives a shit what some Internet troll says?<eos> It's stupid.<eos> I'm gonna put it on airplane mode.<eos> "Hashtag, show your tits, Maritz."<eos> Like, where do they come up with this?<eos> Shut the fuck up, Stratman.<eos> What?
Have you seen your file?<eos> Piscatella, he's a... monster.<eos> He should never have been working here in the first place, and that's my fault.<eos> But you do not have to become the monster he's making you out to be.<eos> I've seen you with the other inmates.<eos> They look up to you.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Okay, enough.<eos> You have to tell me what's going on.<eos> What?
Why there is an army of lemmings dressed like you, moving out here.<eos> - You sound insane.<eos> - I am not insane!<eos> You're gaslighting me right now.<eos> And technically... do you know that's emotional abuse?<eos> Do you know how I know that's emotional abuse?<eos> I read it in an online quiz once, called "Are You Being Emotionally Abused?"<eos> Okay, I may have shared some... some things in my history with a few inmates and it resonated.<eos> - They think I stand for something.<eos> - What things from your history?
Very mature. Where're you...<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I am going to the guest room.<eos> I'm from Fresno, California, 46 years old, Puerto Rican,<eos> - doing 11 years for armed robbery...<eos> - Who's Rosalita Pontz?<eos> I'm from North Philly, 5'9", 285 pounds.<eos> I got no identifying marks, and...<eos> Who's Jodi Winkler?<eos> What?
Which is weird, because I hate belts.<eos> They give me camel toe.<eos> Intake is your best bet out, okay?<eos> But be really careful in the hallways.<eos> Here, take it.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> - What the fuck!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Shit.
Just go.<eos> Hurry.<eos> - Ooh... fuck.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Fucker!<eos> - Are you gonna die?<eos> You are so gonna pay for this.<eos> - Get her!<eos> - Bitch!<eos> What?
Before you get too comfortable up there on your cross, and have your pity party, let me just... let me just jog your memory for a minute.<eos> There was an innocent man who was murdered.<eos> Gary.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> He... he only did good things in this world.<eos> Gary was a father.<eos> He had two grown sons.<eos> I never met them, but I... I know he loved them.<eos> And... he was thrown off his balcony.<eos> For what?
I... I help turn around struggling businesses.<eos> You intend to make money off of businesses that aren't making any?<eos> In a roundabout way.<eos> Best get some ice on that lip.<eos> There are a lot of innovative ideas in self storage.<eos> You park your boat or put your shit in a shed, lock it up and walk away. What am I missing?<eos> Well, a lot of clichés are clichés for good reason, and one of them is, "You need money to make money,"<eos> Um, and I could be that money.<eos> You would get to hold on to 100% ownership.<eos> In return for what?
Stuff like that.<eos> I would get to recoup 100% on my investment. I'd get two-and-a-half percent of... - you know, the net profits.<eos> Sir, you are delinquent on... on your property taxes... and you got those tenants that are suing you. I think there's three of them, yeah?<eos> Maybe this could work for both of us.<eos> Plus, I'll tell you what...<eos> I bet it would feel a lot better if I wasn't just an investor, and I was also a client.<eos> I... I'm looking for storage space myself.<eos> So, um, if that's a unit right there, I will take that big one, and I will deal with whatever's on the inside of it for... how about 75 bucks a month?<eos> What do you say?<eos> - Hundred.
Well, I think that any business could benefit from a set of fresh eyes, and my research tells me that you have the only, um...<eos> - Titty bar.<eos> - ...titty bar, sure, in the lake area, and yet you still...<eos> you still seem to struggle, and I'm wondering what you could do with an immediate loan and an updated business plan.<eos> I think that, uh, a higher-caliber dancer would definitely translate into a higher-paying customer.<eos> Is there any reason you can't have beautiful women on your payroll? I don't think so.<eos> Beautiful girls won't work here.<eos> I won't let 'em.<eos> Plain Janes with a work ethic? That's my sweet spot right there.<eos> Or freak bait.
I'm selling the place under the condition that I be allowed to live here until I die.<eos> I have a hot plate and a fridge I can move downstairs.<eos> Any luck, we can go weeks without seeing each other.<eos> Well, there it is.<eos> I understand it's an unusual condition, and I've priced the property to reflect that.<eos> - How many kids do you have?<eos> - Two.<eos> Girl and a boy.<eos> How old's the girl?<eos> Fifteen.
Eighteen months.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Here, put this on.<eos> This isn't your boat, is it?<eos> The house?<eos> College? Any of it?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Snug enough?<eos> For what?
- The fuck you are!<eos> Relax! Relax.<eos> Just tell me one thing, okay?<eos> What do you think you're gonna do with all of that cash?<eos> Can't just stick it in that hole behind a urinal in whatever the hell place this is, okay?<eos> And you can't put it in a bank.<eos> These guys file cash transaction reports to the IRS for any deposits over $10,000.<eos> So forget about the bank.<eos> Can't go shopping for some fancy truck or something.<eos> Not with cash.
- Why?<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> The only question you guys need to be asking is are you murderers?<eos> You steal that money, you're gonna have to kill me.<eos> 'Cause there's another man who works for Mr. Navarro, a very serious man... and he's gonna come to town. He's gonna ask me where that money is. And if I'm still alive,<eos> At which point he's gonna find someone with your last name and start removing their skin until he locates the rest of you.<eos> So you decide, right now, once and for all, are you killers?<eos> You know, a case could be made that... the disappearance of Mr. Byrde and the redistribution of this money... constitutes a good thing.<eos> He's aiding and abetting the sale of drugs.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Oh, boy.
- We're taking a hundred grand.<eos> - Mr. Navarro will take it back.<eos> - Fifty, then.<eos> - He'll take that, too.<eos> - Thirty.<eos> - Nope.<eos> We're taking $20,000.<eos> Get 20...<eos> That's a mistake.<eos> ...for our trouble and dashed expectations.
It's simple.<eos> You take the kids today and you live off the credit cards<eos> - until the insurance pays out.<eos> - You're not thinking straight.<eos> Then you take that money and you start over.<eos> You just need more time.<eos> No, I don't, Wendy.<eos> This was a dodge. This was a lie.<eos> No one can wash $8 million down here.<eos> Not in three months.
- until the insurance pays out.<eos> - You're not thinking straight.<eos> Then you take that money and you start over.<eos> You just need more time.<eos> No, I don't, Wendy.<eos> This was a dodge. This was a lie.<eos> No one can wash $8 million down here.<eos> Not in three months.<eos> And when Del gets his $8 million back, he'll be whole... and if he knows that I'm dead, I don't think that he... I mean, he's got no reason to, uh...<eos> To what?
It would depend.<eos> Now, this client... say he's maybe had recent financial problems or demonstrated unusual behavior, like quitting his job suddenly.<eos> Or... if maybe he had a spouse who'd been unfaithful.<eos> That's all ammunition the insurance company would use to try and not pay out.<eos> Yeah, yeah, so... would you put it at, like, 50%?<eos> Bob?<eos> Is it less than 50?<eos> I can't give you numbers.<eos> Mr. Byrde?<eos> Thanks so much for your help.

And your nights with lust!<eos> I also want to thank you, all of you, for welcoming me back into your grace.<eos> These past few months have been the happiest I can remember in a very long time.<eos> You saved me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hear, hear.<eos> We didn't save you...<eos> The gods did.<eos> To the gods!<eos> To the gods!
I also want to thank you, all of you, for welcoming me back into your grace.<eos> These past few months have been the happiest I can remember in a very long time.<eos> You saved me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hear, hear.<eos> We didn't save you...<eos> The gods did.<eos> To the gods!<eos> To the gods!<eos> To the gods!
- All right!<eos> Hey, you did all right back there.<eos> In fact, I tell you what.<eos> We're a pretty good team, like thunder and lightning, hammer and nails.<eos> More like ball and chain.<eos> I'm sorry, is that Clipper humor?<eos> Very droll.<eos> Maybe you should stick to punching people.<eos> Do you ever stop talking?<eos> - What?
Rub him well with garlic, roast it over heather wood...<eos> That is lip-smacking heaven.<eos> Look at that, come on.<eos> Oh, I think this one is pregnant. Delicious.<eos> Tate ran away.<eos> Do you think they'll find him?<eos> They always do.<eos> So?<eos> What's it like?<eos> What?
Henry.<eos> Yes, that's a fine choice.<eos> After my father.<eos> Your father was an honorable man.<eos> Well, it's too bad he'll never get to meet his grandson.<eos> I'm sure the boy will live up to his name.<eos> I'll find a way to bring Henry sunlight.<eos> You have my word.<eos> Why don't you try hitting it harder?<eos> What?
If she's anywhere, she's in the Badlands.<eos> Ah, then you're in luck. 'Cause I'm going that way myself.<eos> Seriously. Got a bit of unfinished business there.<eos> What kind of business?<eos> What, so you get to be all mysterious and silent and I've got to give you my personal soliloquy?<eos> Nah.<eos> Just get back to your rat. I don't need your help.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You got any idea where you are?<eos> Huh?
A hundred years ago, it was the custom for every Baron's child to be baptized in blood.<eos> But we've lost our way since then. Forgotten the traditions that first forged the Badlands out of chaos.<eos> Why, I myself neglected this hallowed rite when my own son was born.<eos> And he repaid my omission with a lifetime of failure and betrayals.<eos> Tonight, fate has offered me a second chance. An opportunity to set things right.<eos> Tonight, we bless the Badlands' newest heir.<eos> Isn't he a beautiful child?<eos> Yes, Baron.<eos> And his mother, too?<eos> Hmm?
Tonight, we bless the Badlands' newest heir.<eos> Isn't he a beautiful child?<eos> Yes, Baron.<eos> And his mother, too?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Now, don't be shy. I saw you watching her as she suckled the child.<eos> Seems you can't keep your eyes to yourself, hmm?<eos> You should know, this woman saved my life.<eos> That means she saved yours, too.<eos> All of you!
Jesus.<eos> Twentyone years?<eos> What'd you get me?<eos> Better be good.<eos> I got you a bigscreen TV.<eos> So you can watch soap operas.<eos> Yeah. That's nice.<eos> What did you get me?<eos> I got you nothing.<eos> What?
Raymond?<eos> What the fuck, Terry?<eos> I fucked up.<eos> I went somewhere I shouldn't have gone.<eos> A whorehouse.<eos> I'm in the jail in Pahrump.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll pick you up in about an hour.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Terry.
- Terry. Tell me her name.<eos> London.<eos> My God.<eos> All right.<eos> You guys wait here.<eos> Where the fuck are you going?<eos> I'm going in there.<eos> You're gonna talk to a hooker in a brothel?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - On our anniversary?
Do you enjoy SM, London?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> We're gonna take the dominatrix package.<eos> Great choice.<eos> Yeah, we're pretty excited about it, aren't we, Rex?<eos> Sure.<eos> Wait here.<eos> I got to get ready.<eos> You're on fuckin' fire.<eos> Cute outfit.
Put it on.<eos> Cheers.<eos> May the sun shine warm upon your face.<eos> May the rain fall soft upon the fields.<eos> And until we meet again...<eos> May God hold you in the palm of his hand.<eos> Sláinte.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Natalie James is here.<eos> Why?
She's just gonna get some things. We'll be gone in a couple minutes.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> Who the fuck is he?<eos> We can talk about this downstairs, come on.<eos> What are you, the prom date? Ha.<eos> You're fucking my wife?<eos> Don't talk to him.<eos> Will you please just be decent...<eos> - Hey, shut up, bitch.<eos> - For one fucking minute!
You're leaving me for the security guard? Why?<eos> What, do you have an unusually large dick?<eos> You know what, Ray?<eos> Let's forget the things.<eos> I'll get new things with all the money I'll have after I fire my piece of shit manager.<eos> Give me my fucking dog!<eos> - Give me my dog!<eos> - Let the dog go.<eos> Over my dead body you take our dog.<eos> Our dog?
We should've texted first or something.<eos> What's that?<eos> That is a robot.<eos> That is not a disappointing robot.<eos> Technically, this isn't a robot at all.<eos> The tiny little things, those are the robots, this is the interface with them.<eos> Does it speak?<eos> Will we understand it?<eos> Well, depends upon what aspect of your language have survived over so many thousands of years.<eos> Emoji.
See, this is the point.<eos> You don't call the helpline because you ARE the helpline.<eos> Don't sentimentalise me.<eos> I don't just fly around helping people out.<eos> What are you doing right now?<eos> I happened to be passing by, so I'm mucking in.<eos> You've never passed by in your life.<eos> You couldn't even leave me serving chips, so I'm not going to leave you.<eos> Look at the wall.<eos> - The wall?
Like, how are you allowed to blow something up and not get into trouble?<eos> I mean, blow something up, get into trouble, that is a standard sequence.<eos> 'What do you mean, "allowed"?<eos> '<eos> It's a moral imperative.<eos> This is a murder machine.<eos> Beautiful, though, I mean, the whole place.<eos> You should be able to see a staircase...<eos> All traps are beautiful, that's how they work.<eos> - Up or down?

Doesn't anyone notice the tardis?<eos> Your species hardly notices anything.<eos> So, what are the rules?<eos> - Rules?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Travelling to the past, There's got to be rules.<eos> If I step on a butterfly, it could send ripples through time that mean I'm not even born in the first place<eos> - and I could just disappear.<eos> - Definitely. - That's what happened to Pete.<eos> - Pete?
Someone pays you to promote the fair?<eos> To get people onto the ice?<eos> Who? Who pays you?<eos> Kitty?<eos> Where's Spider?<eos> Spider is...<eos> He...<eos> Who's hungry?<eos> I'm hungry!<eos> Food!
What have you got up your sleeve?<eos> My God!<eos> Have you been holding out on me?<eos> Do you have, like, magical, alien powers?<eos> What, was that an impolite question?<eos> Why do we need diving suits on top of the ice?<eos> If we're lucky, the lights will come and take us under.<eos> Whatever they are, they're clever.<eos> When they went after the boy, they waited until he was away from the crowds, by himself.<eos> What?
Does Lord Sutcliffe know we're here?<eos> !<eos> Does Lord Sutcliffe know we're here?<eos> Lord Sutcliffe insisted we come.<eos> That Lord Sutcliffe, yes.<eos> There's no arguing with Sutcliffe when he puts his foot down.<eos> - You'd better show us around.<eos> - Follow me, sir.<eos> Take it inside!<eos> Same as the last batch.
- Because the creature is an alien.<eos> It certainly appears to be producing fuel suitable for interstellar travel.<eos> Either way, Bill... - I need you to leave the talking to me.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because you have a temper.<eos> OK, I lost it a tiny bit...<eos> You're about to meet a man, alien or otherwise, for whom human beings are raw material.<eos> Who grinds up children for profit.<eos> What we are here for is one thing.<eos> Information.
The accident of birth that puts you inside the big, fancy house?<eos> I help move this country forward.<eos> I move this empire forward.<eos> Human progress isn't measured by industry... it's measured by the value you place on a life.<eos> An unimportant life.<eos> A life without privilege.<eos> The boy who died on the river, that boy's value is your value.<eos> That's what defines an age.<eos> That's... what defines a species.<eos> What a beautiful speech.
This place is great!<eos> The rooms are huge!<eos> Can I move in tonight?<eos> My halls are kicking me out.<eos> Yes. Yes, of course.<eos> So, you'll sign the contract?<eos> Yes!<eos> Of course.<eos> Bill?<eos> What?
No!<eos> Unless we've regenerated or had a big lunch. "Regenerated"?<eos> The questions, the questions, the questions...!<eos> Just remember "Time Lords".<eos> That's enough for now.<eos> Here we are!<eos> I'll use the tardis. Take it all to your room.<eos> Firstly, I don't know which one my room is, and, secondly, that's weird and I want to make a good impression.<eos> It's cool, I'll just, um... get everything out of the tardis and then you can go.<eos> Thanks for the lift, though!
It's cool, I'll just, um... get everything out of the tardis and then you can go.<eos> Thanks for the lift, though!<eos> Bye!<eos> That's your house?<eos> Sharing.<eos> Yeah. Six of us.<eos> Renting.<eos> I thought you were students?<eos> Yeah, I was like, "What's the catch?" but, actually, it's fine, just a bit draughty.<eos> "Draughty"?
How exciting is this? !<eos> Wow! Doctor!<eos> Legend!<eos> He's my grandad.<eos> Aw! Come on!<eos> Father, at least.<eos> Please!<eos> All right, grandfather.<eos> You really can go now, though.<eos> Thanks for the help.
Doctor...?<eos> Yeah, he's my... grandfather.<eos> You're assisting with the relocation?<eos> That's right, yeah.<eos> It's a heartbreaking experience, to leave one's charge behind.<eos> All alone in the big, wide world.<eos> Indeed. Yes.<eos> You got children?<eos> I...<eos> Yes, a daughter.
Yes, I see.<eos> Go on. No central heating?<eos> The power sockets are wrong.<eos> A landline.<eos> Some new furniture.<eos> There's no mobile reception.<eos> And some curtains.<eos> Carpets?<eos> Have you got a cat?<eos> A cat?
In the meantime, sleep well.<eos> I take it back.<eos> You're fine.<eos> HE'S weird.<eos> The washing machine!<eos> That's weird.<eos> He's not there.<eos> That's it!<eos> That's the noise I heard.<eos> Fascinating...
And Florence.<eos> Felicity.<eos> Yeah, why? Well, we're going to chill. Yeah?<eos> Yeah, OK. Yes. Put some tunes on.<eos> Yes?<eos> Yes! All right.<eos> See?<eos> I'm good at making friends.<eos> Give me your phone.<eos> But why?
A gaseous creature.<eos> Or microscopic!<eos> Did you see it move through the wood?<eos> Interacting at a cellular level.<eos> This must be alien!<eos> Got to be alien!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> On your holidays?<eos> Harry - get a matchbox.<eos> A matchbox?
Maybe I could help?<eos> I'm a doctor!<eos> Are you ok?<eos> I haven't had visitors in such a long time.<eos> My name is Eliza.<eos> I'm Bill.<eos> This is Shireen.<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm pleased to meet you.<eos> What?
She's restoring them!<eos> I thought you were gone.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Me? !<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> What about the others?<eos> Come on!<eos> We need to get out!<eos> Now!<eos> Wrong way!
I thought you were gone.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Me? !<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> What about the others?<eos> Come on!<eos> We need to get out!<eos> Now!<eos> Wrong way!<eos> Wrong way! Wrong way!
I just want to have a look at this.<eos> Our friend inside's been a little restive lately...<eos> I can sort that out.<eos> No, it's all right, I don't mind...<eos> Right.<eos> Goodnight, sir.<eos> See you in the morning.<eos> A piano?<eos> You've put a piano in there?<eos> Why?
Truth being that rules don't apply to you?<eos> I love Mozart and Bach.<eos> I love the Swiss Alps and the Baltic Sea.<eos> Why can't I love you and Elsa?<eos> For a man who is an expert on the universe, you don't know the first thing about people, do you?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Forgive me, Betty.<eos> Perhaps... triangular geometry is not as simple as I'd like it to be.<eos> Professor Einstein's office.<eos> Yeah, one moment, please.
That you see yourself as one of them, and not as one of us.<eos> One of us?<eos> You talk like a Zionist.<eos> No, I'm a realist.<eos> And I'm a German patriot, a proud war veteran, and a devout Christian.<eos> Really, Fritz?<eos> You're proud of your military service?<eos> You may have changed your religion, but don't think for a second you can change your heritage.<eos> Is that how you really see me?<eos> As some sort of fraud?
I have no idea.<eos> Let me show you.<eos> Come.<eos> Ah...<eos> Come on!<eos> Come!<eos> Imagine I'm a light beam traveling to Earth.<eos> Now catch me!<eos> How fast must we go?<eos> About 300,000 kilometers a second.
Germany Heil!<eos> Elsa.<eos> Elsa.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's time.<eos> Um... um...<eos> I'll, um...<eos> I'll call Princeton.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
Sam Brandt...<eos> Street Scoop...<eos> Out hunting.<eos> She knows you're lugging the stock and you're facing your first down quarter because of it.<eos> She wants you to be a talking head on her show.<eos> Shit!<eos> Can you spike it?<eos> No, but if you say you'll go on, you can buy yourself the last three days of the month.<eos> All right, I'll do it.<eos> Thanks for the heads up.
The way I see it, we need a quick fix in a non-quick-fix market.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> I was talking to Victor.<eos> Why were you talking to Victor?<eos> You know why.<eos> She have to be here?<eos> Sure as shit.<eos> Changes what I can pitch.<eos> By design.
Now I'll buy up both of you.<eos> You just say the word.<eos> You'd be risking half your net worth for the one play?<eos> That's insane.<eos> I am dug the fuck in.<eos> No third-world nation hinged on a dying industry and a propped-up currency is gonna ride me out of my position.<eos> I will drive them into the goddamn ground.<eos> Without Birch.<eos> Without either of you.<eos> Wow. The intensity.
I see that.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm gonna carpet-bomb you guys with so much fucking food, you'll be reeling.<eos> Thanks, David.<eos> Don't thank me.<eos> Just be there for us when Fugu goes public.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I know when someone's working me.<eos> What's your play here?<eos> The bond.
Yeah.<eos> Will you ask me about my bracelet?<eos> Fun way in.<eos> We're pleased to welcome Bobby Axelrod, the principal and founder of Axe Capital.<eos> Bobby, it's a pleasure to have you here.<eos> It's a pleasure to be here, Sam.<eos> Before we get started, I have to ask...<eos> You're wearing a very unique bracelet.<eos> What's the significance?<eos> Oh, this?
Dieppe. You.<eos> Standing on top of that tank on fire.<eos> Not you. The best part of that was the view.<eos> Seeing that jeep at the far end of the field carrying you back.<eos> And you... You get to relive those moments, you get to... See them, to smell them.<eos> It's as real.<eos> As the present, every time. So,<eos> When you were a little boy, You could spend a whole day inside... The memory of the first time you tasted ice cream?<eos> I still can.<eos> Any first taste.
Don't move.<eos> Hands in the air.<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> Did we do something wrong? There.<eos> Go there!<eos> Come on!<eos> Turn around. Turn. Turn!<eos> On the ground!
Previously on x company... Jacques rigaud,<eos> We will execute these prisoners. One by one until you step forward.<eos> We have friends.<eos> We can keep you safe. Do you understand?<eos> Your son klaus.<eos> I can have him transferred.<eos> Be kind to him. I will.<eos> I meant what I said before, son.<eos> So did i.<eos> Krystina.
How do we explain french citizens travelling.<eos> Through germany into poland?<eos> I'll reach out to my friend.<eos> At the ministry of transport. What about rigaud?<eos> What about france?<eos> Are we gonna just turn our back on them?<eos> Rigaud is going to need time to rally and organize.<eos> Yeah, it'll be even harder when france is fully occupied.<eos> That is time we do not have. I cannot leave an asset to slip away.<eos> What if...
He didn't even ask me as... As if I didn't even matter.<eos> Sabine.<eos> Maybe it's for the best.<eos> This city, this apartment, There are so many painful memories.<eos> Maybe poland can be a new beginning.<eos> And we get away from them.<eos> Herr brigadefuhrer.<eos> I'm sorry for troubling you but I know. You would want to hear this.<eos> Jacques rigaud is in paris.<eos> Rigaud?
Of course.<eos> You will be held responsible for this.<eos> The prisoner fled under your watch. However, You will receive full credit for the prevention.<eos> From any punishment.<eos> Are you with me? In return, I will bring you to poland.<eos> You will continue. To learn from me.<eos> You will rise faster than you ever thought. Is that satisfactory?<eos> Yes. Yes, herr brigadefuhrer.<eos> I think this is actually gonna to work.<eos> What?
I am.<eos> Believe me.<eos> I do.<eos> I don't feel for you the way I felt for rene.<eos> Here's a bit of good news.<eos> I've found the perfect way to unburden us from some. Of sinclair's freshly delivered francs. Hang on.<eos> How old are you? Really, grandpa?<eos> Like I haven't heard that one before.<eos> How about a toast?<eos> To absent friends.
Good.<eos> Keep it going.<eos> You don't want me to have to get on a plane.<eos> Please don't send me away." "I was made for you.<eos> Can't you see that?" "I can't."<eos> "I can't take everything you gave me and..."<eos> "Share it with someone else." "It's yours.<eos> It can only be yours."<eos> It's that movie. What movie?<eos> "The Opposite of Jessica."
"The Opposite of Jessica."<eos> - What? Who?<eos> - Charlotte Banks?<eos> We probably watched that movie 100 times, and now I'm gonna be reading with her on Monday.<eos> Yeah, she's doing this limited series for Hulu and they had to fire one of the actresses, and her producing partner saw me in the play - and called Leslie.<eos> - Megan, that's amazing.<eos> My God, I get to meet Charlotte Banks.<eos> Fantastic!<eos> I know.<eos> Boy.
Sam, I promise you, whatever your story is, it does more damage buried inside you than if you share it with us.<eos> Three years ago, this week... my father killed my family.<eos> Came back from work, he shot my mother, my sister... and then he shot himself.<eos> The only reason he didn't kill me is that I...<eos> I went to a friend's house that day to get high.<eos> Best decision you ever made.<eos> I've done nothing with my life.<eos> I've done nothing... to justify it.<eos> And do you think about killing yourself?<eos> All the time.
We're sorry about your friend, love.<eos> Is there someone who can come and sit with you?<eos> Did he jump?<eos> We don't know.<eos> It's what everyone's saying.<eos> Ah, there'll be a lot of rumours.<eos> My advice would be to turn that thing off.<eos> Why, do you think he might have jumped?<eos> The last couple of weeks he's been off with me.<eos> In what way?
The last couple of weeks he's been off with me.<eos> In what way?<eos> Distant.<eos> Not the Jamie I know.<eos> And that's what people call him, is it?<eos> Jamie?<eos> I mean, it's important we get that right.<eos> When did you last see Jamie?<eos> Go on.<eos> What?
- they don't exist.<eos> - What do you mean, they don't exist?<eos> He's gone to a lot of trouble to cover his birth identity.<eos> A lot of trouble.<eos> - His real parents must be somewhere.<eos> - Well, let's find them, Kenny.<eos> So what does this tell us, hm?<eos> He was secretive.<eos> He was leading a double life.<eos> What?
There are a lot of public-school types in our halls, but he had my back.<eos> He just got on with everyone.<eos> That's why this doesn't make sense.<eos> Was there anyone else in his life?<eos> Did he have a girlfriend?<eos> In the first year, yeah.<eos> Karen, an American girl.<eos> Went back.<eos> No-one since?<eos> - Not in three years?
- Why is he here?<eos> - Because he lied to my sergeant.<eos> - He was near our crime scene, said he wasn't.<eos> - He didn't lie.<eos> He wanted to avoid questions because he had to be elsewhere.<eos> - Simple as that.<eos> - Why not just say that then?<eos> Perhaps he's never spoken to a police officer before.<eos> And...<eos> What?
I'd seen him around.<eos> Well, did you know him or didn't you?<eos> I didn't know him.<eos> Yesterday evening, what was the route of your practice run?<eos> A loop from the changing rooms, through the woodland path, back to the Priory.<eos> What time did you leave?<eos> Quarter to seven.<eos> What time did you get back?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> About quarter past.
He even showed his sympathy for the victim.<eos> - Ah, he always does that.<eos> - Aye, he does.<eos> Ah, maybe he means it.<eos> So what's his wife like?<eos> She died when the kids were young.<eos> He brought them up on his own.<eos> - Mark...<eos> Dug anything up on the deceased?<eos> - A full financial profile.
Was there any aggro between them?<eos> Not that I noticed.<eos> Now, this bloke the lad was with, is he a regular?<eos> Nah, he's not a regular.<eos> He pops in every now and then for a tea-timer.<eos> - Have you got a name?<eos> - No.<eos> But I know where he works.<eos> Er, Lexi and Jo on the back wall.<eos> On the back wall!
Some miners were trapped underground.<eos> Three days, wasn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Jamie traced me.<eos> He was looking for stories, anecdotes.<eos> Did he talk about himself at all?<eos> Not much.<eos> I tend to go on a bit when I'm talking about my dad.<eos> He didn't mention anything that was troubling him, you know, in passing?<eos> Anything?
I mean, not to the extent that Jamie did.<eos> That's not the norm, I'd say.<eos> So what was his motive, do you reckon?<eos> Embarrassment?<eos> Ambition?<eos> Maybe he felt like his background was holding him back.<eos> His dad's not telling us everything, I know that much.<eos> What did you study at uni?<eos> Oh, isn't that obvious, pet?<eos> Nutrition.
Good work!<eos> Can you make that bigger?<eos> Rewind it.<eos> - There.<eos> - That's Ian Holland.<eos> Kenny!<eos> Did you find anything on Ian Holland?<eos> Only just his DBS.<eos> His name does ping up on the database, but nothing criminal.<eos> What?
You see that on his neck?<eos> Eczema.<eos> Terrible, it was.<eos> But you know what?<eos> He never complained.<eos> Not once.<eos> He just got on with it.<eos> Even this age, he was twice the man I was.<eos> I just feel rage.<eos> All the time.
And Jamie was murdered between five to seven and ten past.<eos> I'm sure there were a lot of guests at the party who don't show up in random photos taken between those times.<eos> Mm.<eos> Did you see your son while you were up there?<eos> He was running nearby.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> What, even though you only go to the place occasionally?<eos> Trying to fool me into covering for my son is a low blow, Vera.<eos> Well, even if you had, I wouldn't have thought anything by it.<eos> Perfectly natural.
- Why would he beat up Jamie, then his dad?<eos> - Why do you think, love?<eos> - Revenge?<eos> - Revenge.<eos> If you thought Derek Stoddart was responsible for your son's death, you should have come to us.<eos> Did Jamie tell you it was his dad who was the hit-and-run driver?<eos> Eventually.<eos> 'I want to honour Allenby and what they went through'?<eos> He got what he deserved.<eos> A violent death?
They're not just related.<eos> They're both non-executives of a Jersey-based company.<eos> - What sort of company?<eos> - Property.<eos> Tyneford Estates.<eos> - Tyneford?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They purchased the science block to develop it into luxury student accommodation.<eos> Did they indeed?<eos> - How much for?
- Is that Jennifer?<eos> - Who's in charge?<eos> - Come on...<eos> I'm in charge, love.<eos> DCI Stanhope.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> This is the guy that turned up in my room.<eos> - When?<eos> - Before my op.<eos> Monday.
Oh, I have motive and now I've got your boy<eos> - confirming you were up here with our victim.<eos> - He didn't actually see me come up here.<eos> You haven't got a single eyewitness.<eos> You know I'm going to pin this on you, Alan.<eos> I'll turn your life, your house, your whole world upside down.<eos> Your son's been lying for you.<eos> You can't leave him like that, Alan, knowing you killed the lad he loved.<eos> You need to tell the truth, Alan.<eos> Not to me.
Allegation of fraud.<eos> He'll wriggle out of that.<eos> It was the attack on his family he couldn't stomach.<eos> - Can you finish up here, love?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> 400-metre champion?<eos> Aye.<eos> You'd better believe it!<eos> Hurdles!
- Hey.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Hurt Locker.<eos> What is it with you and that place?<eos> I don't get it. Obviously.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Alright. Good.<eos> Goin' to Circuit Works.<eos> Why?
Live forever, huh? I guess it'd be cool.<eos> You don't have to worry, 'cause nothin' hurts you, you know? There's nothin' to be afraid of.<eos> Yeah, well, things still hurt.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> You got all your fingers chopped off. A coupla these bad boys later, and they're back.<eos> Yeah, well, alright. Yeah, that's a point, to be sure. That's a bonus, alright?<eos> But there's trade-offs, like...<eos> I used to love the beach.<eos> When I was a boy, me Ma used to take us to the beach in the summer.<eos> Me and me brother.

I-I thought you were my ex.<eos> Come... Come on in.<eos> God...<eos> I don't know why I'm praying when I know you're not there, but... if this is your plan for me, and you can hear me,<eos> I gave up a piece of my soul to find you.<eos> Don't let it be for nothin'. Please.<eos> Custer Jesse. Please come to the Dork Docs.<eos> Any luck?<eos> Sorry, man. We've got nothin'.<eos> What?
And that's when it happened.<eos> He smiled. For the first time.<eos> A simple act of kindness had changed his life, and... that beautiful smile was my missing puzzle piece.<eos> The smile of an indigent half-wit?<eos> That was your puzzle piece?<eos> You understand they smile all the time, right?<eos> Your father is the Governor of Louisiana, yes?<eos> Has he ever been to Angola?<eos> The country or the prison?<eos> Either.
B.R.A.D.'s in transit, sir.<eos> And the other thing?<eos> Hoover is researching professionals as we speak.<eos> Good.<eos> I was thinking, you might prefer multiple prostitutes.<eos> Yes, that's fine.<eos> Good. No-means-yes in multiples.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> _<eos> Cats?
How do we find it?<eos> Sidney can't be doing this all on his own.<eos> Last time he had the Ogdens.<eos> He's using people who have already turned.<eos> That could be anyone.<eos> What are you gonna do, run around touching everyone in town?<eos> We know one.<eos> Maybe if you'd been a little smarter, you could've got the job done right the first time, huh?<eos> How's your threats now? Huh?<eos> And your deeds?

Huh?<eos> And your deeds?<eos> Or your songs?
And counting.<eos> Our victim... stab wounds in the back, tongue cut out.<eos> Now, normally, that would point to Santeria and Wiccan rites.<eos> And, normally, I would send photos of her wounds and tattoos, see what we can get.<eos> But... then there's this.<eos> Whatever this is.<eos> What you are seeing is known as a "Glamour";<eos> a method of mystical camouflage used since the persecutions in Salem.<eos> As in the Salem witch trials?<eos> The very same.
Stranger things have happened.<eos> But no.<eos> I see no signs of necromancy.<eos> Right, 'cause that's a word people use.<eos> As long as the weirdness ends here, I'm fine with it.<eos> I'm afraid the weirdness has only just begun.<eos> I know this woman.<eos> - I'm sorry, what?<eos> - As you are aware, my expertise are not only supernatural but historical, particularly in regards to Sleepy Hollow, where I believe this woman visited.<eos> A very long time ago.
I'm following the police investigation.<eos> They don't have much yet.<eos> Sam's gone for groceries.<eos> Where's my tea?<eos> No, not Sam.<eos> It's me.<eos> It's Chad... your son.<eos> Mom, you know me.<eos> Chad, you've come to see me.<eos> Just for a few minutes.
Control. Who lives, who dies.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Hey, I know a lot of surgeons.<eos> At least you're honest about it.<eos> Most are too egotistical to truly see themselves.<eos> The only reason our brains tell us we're flawed is so that we find a way to be better.<eos> Besides... there's nothing wrong with the occasional evil thought.<eos> Somewhere you have to be?<eos> More like a deadline I've promised to keep.<eos> Well... thanks for the drink.
Come with me.<eos> So what are we dealing with, here?<eos> How exactly do these searches go in an undercover situation?<eos> Well, Hunter usually has one of those guns that look for radio waves.<eos> All right, all right, all right, so, what I'm thinking is:<eos> If we transmit in bursts, say every seven minutes, they're gonna have a hard time picking it up.<eos> Wait, so are you saying that we're only gonna be in contact with Brandt every seven minutes?<eos> It's based on a system I developed for our spy satellites.<eos> Basically, the less something transmits, the harder it is to find.<eos> Too risky.
- I mean, they'll find that.<eos> - We're talking seven minutes of video in a three-second transfer.<eos> It's like running the Chicago River through a garden hose.<eos> Pete, when a woman tells you size matters, it's best to stop arguing.<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> What if the wire is the clothes?<eos> This is made of Reeves Industries smart fabric.<eos> Each thread is actually a tiny wire.<eos> What if we make this into a jacket?<eos> - A jacket?
That last part.<eos> Hear that rumble?<eos> That's the El.<eos> There can't be that many tracks in that neighborhood.<eos> Okay, I'm enlarging the map.<eos> Murphy, he's-he's near the El.<eos> They've got Brandt in a car, the camera's totally blocked so we can't see anything.<eos> But we can hear.<eos> How long ago did they pass it?<eos> About three minutes.
All right.<eos> We stopped traffic northbound on Sixth.<eos> Looking for... that.<eos> Got it.<eos> We'll set up at the end of Eighth and we'll work down.<eos> Cobb?<eos> Yeah.<eos> 1312 in pursuit.<eos> What about Brandt?<eos> Any update?
Gideon?<eos> We're trying to track down Officer Brandt.<eos> Unfortunately, the same thing that made his surveillance equipment hard for the bad guys to find is making it hard for us to find him.<eos> We are working the problem and I promise you we won't stop until Brandt is safe.<eos> If you're the praying kind, now's the time to put in a good word for your fellow officer.<eos> While you're at it, pray for a better G.S.M. localization protocol.<eos> Gideon.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Do you?<eos> What?
Okay, okay, just stop, please, please.<eos> Now, Tico, I'm getting real tired of this.<eos> It was him.<eos> He told me. He's lying.<eos> - What did he tell you?<eos> - He's lying.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Tico, what did he tell you?<eos> Places.<eos> Places. What-What places?
Gideon, we could use a little help here.<eos> He's in the next room to your right, Murphy, hurry.<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> Be smart, Hunter.<eos> I'm no use to you dead.<eos> You keep me alive, you got leverage.<eos> I think you watch too many movies.<eos> Police!<eos> Drop your weapon!<eos> On the floor!
Plus, you need someone in your corner for the boxing, you know.<eos> The... The boxing match, yeah.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> You're here about a girl.<eos> She's coming over.<eos> Tell her I'm... I'm cool.<eos> Madden's... cool.<eos> Um... okay.<eos> I believe I owe you a free drink.<eos> Only a month later. Perfect timing.
- Okay, we'll skip that one. - Mm.<eos> You meet a Troll on a bridge.<eos> What do you use to defeat him.<eos> A sword, a stone, a revolver... or your mind?<eos> Okay. My mind.<eos> A potion gives you animal quality.<eos> Which do you take?<eos> The speed of a hare, the strength of an ape, the agility of a cat, or... The good nature of a dog?<eos> Agility of a cat, of course.<eos> Wow! Only three questions... special.
And this is a way of introducing you to the public, without the press clamoring for a story.<eos> Because they've already.<eos> Cinderella.<eos> They won't look past that.<eos> So it's a stunt?<eos> No, it's a story that we don't have to hide from.<eos> Look, I know it's a lot, but we can deal with the press stuff later.<eos> Right now, I just want to be with you.<eos> Here.<eos> Like this.
You should put a note about the texture in the suggestion box.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Who stacks plates on top of glasses?<eos> I guess I shouldn't be complaining about the tubes.<eos> You know, it's probably better to be on white noise than teen-angst brain while I'm tracking Natalie.<eos> And I think I can find her.<eos> If I can just figure out who all of her old clients were and where they live.<eos> There's actually one person who might have that information.<eos> Blaine.<eos> No, no, no, no.
Dumb face.<eos> Any idea what he was carrying?<eos> - Trash.<eos> - What makes you say "trash"?<eos> It was in a trash bag.<eos> Take him to the precinct. Sober him up.<eos> Have him talk to a sketch artist.<eos> Let's check out this alley.<eos> Damn.<eos> What in god's name?
The only dumpster in the alley, and it had to be outside a seafood place.<eos> Look, peeking out from the fish heads and the lobster shells.<eos> - Is that...<eos> - A trash bag.<eos> You could have one of the uniformed guys do it.<eos> I hated the detectives who did that when I was in uniform.<eos> You're a good man, clive babineaux.<eos> - That better be tartar sauce. - Ew.<eos> What is it?<eos> Bloody shoes.
I'm sorry.<eos> I haven't been a good friend.<eos> I've wanted to be, but...<eos> Look, intellectually... I know you didn't do anything wrong.<eos> We weren't together when you and Blaine had your...<eos> You didn't know who he was.<eos> So it's my stupid macho problem.<eos> It's just...<eos> Any time my brain isn't otherwise occupied, these little movies begin playing in there, yeah?<eos> What kind of movies?
Please.<eos> Who's Devon?<eos> Uncurl the toes, please.<eos> Twelve.<eos> Open wide.<eos> So Mitch went to jail, and you and Topher struck it rich.<eos> What then? I couldn't understand why I wasn't happy, so I spent my money.<eos> Hoping things, material possessions, hallucinogenics, would bring me peace.<eos> They didn't. So after you spent all your money, Topher got you into all this?<eos> The other way around.
You have been snippy with me.<eos> Yeah, well, she said she'd been watching you two parked here all night.<eos> - We're on a stakeout.<eos> - All right.<eos> She watched all night?<eos> You really seemed to be giving her a good tongue-lashing.<eos> You understand my confusion.<eos> Cookie?<eos> We're looking for a homeless man who says he sleeps in this alley.<eos> Three nights ago...
Just get on with it.<eos> Ghost pepper, 500 times spicier than straight jalapeño.<eos> A human bites into that, the whole block'll know.<eos> Sold.<eos> Lots of weird-ass peppers.<eos> We can do tasting flights and...<eos> This our new muscle?<eos> I wouldn't say ours.<eos> The club will offer brains of one's choosing.<eos> For a price.
When there's a revolution, who do you think it is that gets guillotined first?<eos> - The one percent. - Marie-Antoinette.<eos> - The one percent. - That's right.<eos> And I intend to keep this one-percent neck.<eos> I had it contoured last January after Colicchio told me that it had more rings than a Swiss roll.<eos> But I told him he looked like a manscaped scrotum, which is less poetic, but extremely apt.<eos> [sighs]<eos> You're scared.<eos> That's a new shade from you.<eos> - "Darker than a Band-Aid."
- I feel weird.<eos> - Does your mouth taste like metal? Wolfsbane, such a useful flower.<eos> The Greeks used it to poison their arrows.<eos> Two thousand years later, the Germans used it to poison their bullets. We should really go to medical.<eos> The fun thing about wolfsbane is, it works from the outside in.<eos> Most people feel a little tingle in the fingertips first, as the smallest nerves are paralyzed.<eos> Then, it makes its way, ever so slowly, to your heart, closing around it like an icy fist.<eos> Something to look forward to.<eos> - Shit, I feel the finger thing.<eos> - Me, too.
Put one on his eye lid.<eos> - Like, to lift it.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> [both laughing]<eos> - [Flaca and Maritza sigh] [in Spanish] This ain't over.<eos> When we're done with you, your outside's gonna match your insides.<eos> [Flaca chuckles] [in English] Hey.<eos> What are you?<eos> A priest or something?<eos> - Please, I... - Daya!
There's no guards to watch you cry.<eos> I'm not gonna cry in front of Mommy.<eos> That makes her upset.<eos> - And we can't make Mommy upset.<eos> - Hey. - Then we have a problem.<eos> - Hey, are you okay? - We don't...<eos> - No?<eos> I am having some of the bad feelings.<eos> Like... like when you're at the swim party and all the kids are playing Marco Polo, but you have the menstruation in your yellow bathing suit.<eos> Those kinds.
A Burmese python named Krueger.<eos> Technically, it was Cal's, but Krueger liked me best.<eos> - Did you ever talk to it?<eos> - Mmm-hmm. When I was feeding him.<eos> Epic conversations. Mostly about the merits of frozen versus fresh mice and why Mike Powell never loved me back.<eos> You cold-blooded for sure.<eos> Nobody asked you, Hufflepuff.<eos> White girl hitting you with some mad expelliarmus!<eos> Yo, T, we got a problem.<eos> Yo, what now?
Vinnie, I got somethin' to tell you.<eos> Hon... Hon...<eos> Vinnie! Vinnie?<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> Call him back.<eos> You forgot about the Burger King.<eos> That smells good.<eos> Smell that. That's what I'm talkin' about right there.<eos> Mmm. I miss coffee.<eos> Thanks for the coffee.
Now, we done told you, Suzanne.<eos> You in Bitchfield now, right?<eos> Different name, different visitation schedule.<eos> But almost everything else is the same.<eos> - Mmm. I see. - Mmm.<eos> So it's like prison within a prison.<eos> Double prison.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And I'm the trap queen.<eos> Now... First order of bidniss.
Gum?<eos> Look what I have.<eos> Come on.<eos> There you go.<eos> Take a cold shower, Vause.<eos> She's with me.<eos> - Shall we, Amelia?<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> What?
That's my girl.<eos> Get up there.<eos> Um, I can't.<eos> It's... it's too many people.<eos> You got this.<eos> Go. Go.<eos> Hey, Litchfield, how y'all doin'?<eos> Uh, it's good to be back here.<eos> Uh, I'm gonna do some impressions for y'all today.<eos> Holy ravioli.
Are you there?"<eos> See?<eos> Simple, clean.<eos> I still feel it's missing something.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We're out.<eos> I waited 20 fucking minutes!<eos> What happened to the cold brew? It was right here.<eos> I don't know. Ask your partner.<eos> Oh, hell no.
I know you ain't calling me a thief.<eos> - I sure as hell didn't take it.<eos> - Never trust a white bitch.<eos> Who you callin' a bitch, spic?<eos> Who you calling a spic, cracker?<eos> - They ain't got no coffee!<eos> - What?<eos> Who was that?<eos> Nobody.<eos> What?
Who you calling a spic, cracker?<eos> - They ain't got no coffee!<eos> - What?<eos> Who was that?<eos> Nobody.<eos> What?<eos> Lourdes, I can't hear you.<eos> Stop crying.<eos> What hospital is he in?<eos> What?
Probably just drying out some corpse he drowned on Law Order.<eos> - You're an asshole. - Come on, Claire.<eos> This is bullshit.<eos> Later, nerds.<eos> So, uh... you flirting with Paolo?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> Puerto Rican guys are too loud and they always late and shit.<eos> You're always late.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Why?
The needles are for sticking under fingernails, not into veins.<eos> Although, maybe we should shoot him up with something.<eos> What is that stuff they use in the movies to make the spies weak and talky?<eos> Breasts.<eos> Look, why don't you guys come in here and then we can strategize.<eos> There's no time.<eos> Uh... quickly. We'll sagetize very, very quickly.<eos> - So fast.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Oh, for God's sake...
We taking our hostages back.<eos> No. No, wait.<eos> We didn't even get to play Left Foot Art yet.<eos> Ladies, ladies...<eos> If you keep 'em here till Suzanne gets tired, that's half a Twix, and another half if you put her crazy ass to bed by 8:00.<eos> I thought you said you didn't have any more candy.<eos> You don't break the glass unless it's an emergency.<eos> You wanna know why I said yes when the governor asked me to do this?<eos> Because I read this list and I thought this is clear and forward thinking and has the potential to effect change.<eos> Real change.
'Cept for that doughy one that smelled like weed.<eos> But you liked that, didn't you?<eos> - Well, I would never...<eos> - Oh, please!<eos> Don't act like you ain't busy giving up that wrinkled piece of ass every chance you got.<eos> Bitches saw him leaving your room.<eos> - Ms. Diaz, please...<eos> - Yeah, that's right. Her room.<eos> As in, with a door and Chesterfield cookies and people hand-plucking her leg hairs and shit.<eos> What?
Against Judy King.<eos> Can you give us any more details about the incident?<eos> Well, I don't remember the name of the inmate who shot him.<eos> Well, you might know her, Ms. Diaz.<eos> That Spanish girl that doesn't speak Spanish? - Oh, shit.<eos> - You know, one with the puffy lips.<eos> This CO who was shot, CO Humphrey...<eos> All right. That's just easy math.<eos> It's only a matter of time before they come in here to get her.<eos> Then what?
What kind of porn you like?<eos> What?<eos> Doesn't look good for you, man.<eos> Aw, look at you. Oh...<eos> I bet your meat's all tender and juicy like them baby cows in Japan that drink beer and get massaged and shit.<eos> Hey, you don't want my meat.<eos> I never get massages.<eos> Ain't your meat I'm after.<eos> I want that bone you pop when you're scared.<eos> What?
I bet your meat's all tender and juicy like them baby cows in Japan that drink beer and get massaged and shit.<eos> Hey, you don't want my meat.<eos> I never get massages.<eos> Ain't your meat I'm after.<eos> I want that bone you pop when you're scared.<eos> What?<eos> I ain't scary enough for you?<eos> Uh, no, you're terrifying.<eos> Uh, really.<eos> Your teeth, especially.
Whatever.<eos> There isn't a single thing you don't ruin, is there?<eos> It ain't about the fish.<eos> What is it?<eos> You can tell me.<eos> Claire won't talk to me.<eos> Paolo's too embarrassed to even look at me.<eos> And I had to pretend I got detention during lunch 'cause I didn't have no one to sit with.<eos> That's it?<eos> Shit.
I'm not. Uh, nobody's ever really alone, Red.<eos> We got a lifetime of regrets to keep us company.<eos> - How was your day?<eos> - Fantastic.<eos> I discovered a whole new muscle in my back I hadn't pulled yet.<eos> You?<eos> Well, I soldered six more spindles than yesterday.<eos> -Oh... Ah. -So much job satisfaction.<eos> -Punching out early again, Galina?<eos> -One minute early.
When you think of him, what do you feel?<eos> Sleepy.<eos> He's Relanium made flesh.<eos> Hey. Look what I bought.<eos> Levi's.<eos> -Nadezhda! Where did you get those?<eos> -A boy from the university.<eos> He said they make the ass of the wearer look like the Charlie's Angels.<eos> -Where can you even wear them?<eos> -A party.
Thanks.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> -We dance.<eos> -It's too slow for the Barynya.<eos> You make it up, dummy. The Westerners use their hips, like Elvis Presley.<eos> You're supposed to look like you're having sex without touching.<eos> Like this?<eos> You look like you hurt yourself.<eos> -That guy is staring at us.<eos> -Not at us. At you.
-No, but--<eos> But he said he was coming in?<eos> Actually, he said he wasn't.<eos> But it's a trick, a smoke screen.<eos> And I'm not the only one he's targeting. He's making all the people I care about disappear, one by one.<eos> He's aiming for the heart or for the mind.<eos> A mind-heart combo.<eos> I think there's a pattern, see?<eos> Norma, missing.<eos> -Oh, boy.
Fuck.<eos> First you can't wait to get me in jeans. Now you want me out.<eos> Mmm! I should add more bleach.<eos> Suddenly everyone wants them faded, like Robert Plant.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - Two cabbages and a soup bone.<eos> We don't have any!<eos> Go away, we're in love.<eos> Have you seen Kostya?<eos> -Not since Saturday.
That's where Kostya was selling.<eos> Maybe it's too conspicuous.<eos> Students pay more.<eos> And they are the future for freedom.<eos> At least at the garden I can hide in a bush.<eos> Here.<eos> Liquid courage.<eos> Go forth and sell liberty and justice for all.<eos> ♪ Come sing with us ♪<eos> Oh, hell, no!
How do you know if you're going crazy?<eos> Usually you don't, because when you've really lost it, you're sure you're the only sane one and everyone else has gone crazy.<eos> Like, my mom knew for sure Kris Kristofferson was in love with her, and... and the police were crazy for pulling her off his security wall.<eos> Do you have my cookbook?<eos> Sorry, um, I...<eos> I mean, I like to look at the pictures. It feels like I'm eating.<eos> Is that sad?<eos> -That's what cookbooks are for. -Hmm.<eos> Son of a pig fucker.<eos> Such a pretty language.
-Nice boxers.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> They must've been a gift from someone with very expensive taste.<eos> Expensive taste and a soul made of old fingernail clippings.<eos> Mmm... 'kay. If memory serves, we were talking about reinstating the GED program.<eos> The issue being the presence of an existing education initiative.<eos> They called it education so they don't have to pay the inmates.<eos> When I brought it to MCC, it was an education program.<eos> They turned it into a chain gang.<eos> Aw, fascinating.
Should we trip her?<eos> Nah. Let it play out.<eos> -What will be will be.<eos> Fuck!<eos> I'm really off of my game today.<eos> I ain't buyin' the whole Counterfeit Cunt story.<eos> Don't smell right to me.<eos> Hands are too clean for a forger.<eos> She'd be inky. Or maybe she's just such a good forger, she went ahead and forged herself.<eos> What?
And... and it used to, before, you could... you could find somebody to talk to if you wanted, you know? Or... or cookie's up their sleeve, and...<eos> Now it's, "Fuck you, inmate.<eos> I'mma fuckin' ruin your life just because I can."<eos> It's like human niceness has just gone renegade, and I don't think it's coming back anytime soon.<eos> -I'm sorry.<eos> -Yeah, me too.<eos> 'Cause the sad truth of it is, is that everybody in here is gonna be way worse than how they were when they started.<eos> You are absolutely right.<eos> Hey... maybe... maybe we can help each other get out of here, you know?<eos> The fence?
Ladies!<eos> Hey, I'm over here.<eos> Oh, thank you, ladies.<eos> Hi. Hey, yeah, great to see you.<eos> Uh, so listen, we need your help, because Leanne's finger was very rudely shot off by your colleague with the gun.<eos> That's the... Humps?<eos> -Donuts.<eos> -Ah! Angie!<eos> God!<eos> Oh, shit.
Don't you think that we have all already suffered enough in service of your revenge scheme, Red?<eos> Did he do that to you?<eos> I think you need to go lie down.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - You are not fine. No one here is fine.<eos> You don't look so good either, Red.<eos> Yeah, Red, that terrifying clown look?<eos> Doesn't really work on anybody.<eos> - You have something to restrain him?<eos> - Something?
How many times has this woman been there for you, huh?<eos> Even if it's just an extra fucking cup of Jell-O.<eos> And, yes, she is withholding, and not the archetypical mother you spent your whole life wishing you had.<eos> Regardless, we ain't gonna get through this shit alone.<eos> See, that much I know.<eos> Why don't you go upstairs and get some Tylenol or something, okay?<eos> And I will deal with this.<eos> - I'm fine...<eos> - Go.<eos> On my count.
She maybe got good potential.<eos> We got ourselves an intern.<eos> What's up now?<eos> You feel them adorefins?<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Did you sleep?<eos> - No.<eos> I'll go get us some coffee.<eos> I broke the vase.<eos> What?
Hey, girl, what happened to your face?<eos> - Your friend, the feral one? - Ah. She's mad at me.<eos> She thinks I stole you or something. Is that what's going on here, Miss Von Barlow?<eos> Are you trying to steal me away?<eos> - What happened to your suit?<eos> Victim of the riot.<eos> I really liked that suit.<eos> Yeah, well, you should see me in suspenders.<eos> Come here.<eos> - Oh! - What?
Have you been rolling around in a pile of horse shit since I've been away?<eos> I had to hide in the Poo to escape a Mexican mongoloid!<eos> Wow, I don't even know which part of that is the most offensive.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> How about I get you a nice hot shower?<eos> Oh, my God, that would be so nice.<eos> Well, I happen to know a place.<eos> I need Suzanne Warren's medication.<eos> All of 'em.
I'm just not typically "gay" gay.<eos> Aw, are you gonna pass me a note and ask me if I like you now?<eos> God. I love it when you're a bitch.<eos> It's just so... me. Mmm.<eos> That's what relationships are, right? - Hmm?<eos> - Well, it's just finding someone who... Reflects those parts of yourself that you want everyone else to see.<eos> It's narcissism, but in a prettier package.<eos> Well, then I guess I want everyone to see that I'm a hot piece of ass with a big set of brass balls and a mouth to back them up.<eos> I've never felt so seen.<eos> - Fresh towel?
You know your schedule, right?<eos> Pill line, 10:00 and 4:00. 10:00 and 4:00.<eos> That's right.<eos> And guess what time it is right now?<eos> - 10:00?<eos> So get your butt down here and take your meds before the COs gives you a shot.<eos> - Listen, what the hell are you doing?<eos> - I'm getting her calmed down.<eos> - With what, exactly?<eos> - Uh, lithium.
Will these make me good?<eos> Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> You wanna lie down?<eos> Take a little nap?<eos> Watch yourself.<eos> You know, my baby sister used to ask me to sing to her.<eos> You want me to sing?<eos> Do you know "Take Me Out To The Ball Game"?<eos> The baseball song?
Disturbing images out of Litchfield Penitentiary today.<eos> A video has surfaced of a male corrections officer, who can be seen brutally assaulting a female inmate.<eos> Families and supporters are claiming that this is a clear example of the abuses the inmates have been subjected to since Litchfield became a private prison... abuses which have fueled this three-day standoff...<eos> You know how much splash back I'm getting from this shit?<eos> My ass is soaked, Nita.<eos> How much longer?
And this place will never be what it was because of what you did for her.<eos> In her name!<eos> If you say no to this now, it will all be for nothing.<eos> Not to mention, you are gonna piss off a lot of people.<eos> The women in here... and the guys out here.<eos> And their weaponry is a hell of a lot more punishing than anything a CO wears on his belt.<eos> What you see out there... is a shit ton of people who are also angry at you.<eos> We got the public on our side and hostages!<eos> What you got?<eos> A remarkable... unprecedented offer on the table.
- She means trolls.<eos> - Right, of course.<eos> - Yes. He's a big goblin-troll.<eos> And the others like him in the webiverse could still find a way to defend him and vilify us.<eos> And we can't let that happen.<eos> We must stay on top.<eos> Red, I think it is time for you to sit down and just chill the fuck out!<eos> Can we all chill the fuck out?<eos> - Refresh the feed, Gina.<eos> - Oh, for fuck's sake...
But I see you now.<eos> And you deserve more than the bare minimum needed to survive.<eos> Yeah. We deserve more.<eos> In fact... I think that I, personally, deserve about $5000 more.<eos> You know... to keep your little secret?<eos> That's extortion.<eos> I'm sorry. Do you think I was in here because I made an honest living?<eos> Fine.<eos> Glad that's settled.<eos> What?
Oh, my God!<eos> Nicky, what kind of a life is that for a baby?<eos> - Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> - Stop. Breathe.<eos> It'll be fine, okay?<eos> Look, babies don't know shit.<eos> They're babies.<eos> Come here.<eos> We will let your families know you've been safely released.<eos> - Mine, too?
Jefferson?<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> This was all me.<eos> I risked my ass like Moses, leading these people to freedom.<eos> Yeah. She cut a hole in the fence.<eos> Are you saying the hostages weren't released as a result of negotiations?<eos> Negotiations?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I did it for the deal.<eos> What deal?
I am so sorry if anyone from MCC led you to believe that they have a say in inmate sentencing...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Uh-uh. No. Fuck that.<eos> No.<eos> You see...<eos> I ruined a lot of things for a lot of good people in there, and I didn't do this shit for nothing.<eos> Uh, oh, okay. Don't get me wrong. We are extremely grateful for what you've done.<eos> I just want to go home.<eos> You know, I ain't never put my baby girl to sleep before?<eos> Not even once.
And the likelihood that ever changes is something I'd bet my life on.<eos> I'd take that bet.<eos> I told you they ain't coming back.<eos> Look, they just... they sweating us out is all.<eos> What happened to Kramer vs. Kramer?<eos> - They'll be right back.<eos> - Back? From where?<eos> We got everything,<eos> - but then she kicked them out...<eos> - Almost everything.
I'm not interested in giving you whatever it is you think you need so you can atone.<eos> See, I don't care whether you're able to heal yourself from this.<eos> 'Cause what you done... you're gonna have to live with for the rest of your life.<eos> That's your punishment.<eos> And you know what?<eos> It's still a hell of a lot better than what my baby girl got.<eos> May you never have a day's peace.<eos> Never.<eos> This isn't the right charger.<eos> What?
They forget your boxers, too.<eos> In and out?<eos> Five minutes, tops.<eos> Don't touch the hair.<eos> You think if I touch that thing, it'll actually move an inch?<eos> It's a fucking helmet.<eos> We have a situation.<eos> Miss Jefferson did not release the hostages.<eos> An inmate helped them escape.<eos> What?
No.<eos> Give me the pack. No.<eos> No. Let go.<eos> Give that back.<eos> Don't.<eos> Please. That's not tech.<eos> That's the spirit of the commanders. Please.<eos> Ilian, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> - Yaah!
Once a cockroach, always a cockroach, huh?<eos> Seriously, raven, not now. Oh...<eos> We only wasted one dose.<eos> Cadogan learned how to survive from his father.<eos> They hunted in these woods.<eos> This is it.<eos> Well, if anyone's entitled to a lucky break, we are.<eos> You hear that?<eos> No insects.<eos> What?
-Right.<eos> -So, I got a call from Barney Leonard.<eos> You pushed too hard, Doug.<eos> But look, we'll have four years to take care of Matthews, and we will.<eos> But what if there was another way?<eos> I don't think anybody, if they're honest with themselves, can say they truly trust President Underwood.<eos> - Why should they?<eos> With so many threats to our country, now it's more important than ever to elect four years of misguided priorities, backing the GOP into soliciting private and special interests.<eos> You know what?<eos> What?
-Oh, I don't trust the polls.<eos> With few exceptions, I don't trust anyone or anything.<eos> We won't know for sure until the vote's begun.<eos> But turnout for their side is sure to be down.<eos> We almost had Conway today.<eos> And we did some damage.<eos> And maybe we don't know what he's hiding, but the public knows there's something out there.<eos> He hums in his sleep sometimes.<eos> Hums?<eos> Like what?
I want you to reach out to Sally Ann back in Gaffney and get me the turnout so far.<eos> I can get you the numbers for the state.<eos> No, I don't want that. I want the Gaffney turnout.<eos> State numbers come in, you give them to us as they come.<eos> Anything out of the ordinary, you let us know. Other than that, we're done.<eos> Oh, and, Doug?<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> -You'll know where to find us.<eos> You're worried about the crowd we just saw.<eos> Not the size. Their enthusiasm.
There's something wrong with the numbers in the precincts that we're getting from this morning.<eos> They don't match up.<eos> It's never happened before in South Carolina.<eos> -Well, you have nothing to say about that?<eos> -Oh, I'm sure the numbers are wrong.<eos> Oh, you don't believe that for a second.<eos> I can't win with you.<eos> No matter what I say.<eos> How many times did you walk me home?<eos> What?
- Leave it with me, Minister.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Mclntyre.<eos> I'll organize someone to help you pack up your desk.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Already?<eos> Did you catch the bird?<eos> Sort out another way.<eos> I want him found.<eos> I've got something that belongs to you.<eos> What?
A house.<eos> Jimmy owned a house in the city?<eos> You know he worked for me sometimes.<eos> It's yours now.<eos> Aren't you in need of a home? And a job?<eos> I have enough money to do what I like.<eos> Forgive me. My mistake.<eos> But as Jimmy's heir...<eos> Isn't Koen Jimmy's heir?<eos> At least for the moment.
Facial recognition, 100%.<eos> We need him found now.<eos> - I'll find him.<eos> - And do it quietly.<eos> Don't draw the CA's or the public's attention to what he is.<eos> Latani was with us.<eos> We were busted out.<eos> - Latani escaped.<eos> - She's still alive?<eos> Djukara?
- Disappointingly so.<eos> - On the contrary.<eos> Normal cells can be destroyed.<eos> Try cancer.<eos> This isn't possible.<eos> Neither is a man who can't be killed, but such is the world we live in.<eos> The cancer's gone.<eos> Try smallpox.<eos> Come on, show me the blast.<eos> Good. And again.
Shit, he's here.<eos> Go hide, quick. Hide.<eos> Jesus, I come in peace.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I brought food like I said I would.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Proceed.<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Classified, Everick.<eos> Any effect on the blood?
- Harry, let her go!<eos> - It is alive?<eos> - Very much so.<eos> You destroyed us...<eos> Jesus, I come in peace.<eos> Here you see a Hairy male before treatment.<eos> I believe the results speak for themselves.<eos> Look like you've seen a ghost.<eos> Hairy!<eos> Hands on your head!
Doesn't feel like it.<eos> Don't have accuracy when I use the blue blast thing.<eos> It's not a weapon.<eos> It works like a weapon.<eos> It's a power not to be messed with, boy.<eos> Anyone who's caught in its blast can no longer move on from this life.<eos> So, what, they become immortal?<eos> Opposite.<eos> They lose their essence.<eos> Their soul?
And where you're from.<eos> Think of Latani.<eos> I need to be able to look for her on the streets openly, without fear.<eos> - It won't always be like this.<eos> - I want to find my daughter.<eos> This is the only way.<eos> Please.<eos> You shut this down, then what?<eos> I go back to being hunted on the streets.<eos> On the ground!
Don't.<eos> Did he hurt you?<eos> Where is Latani?<eos> She wasn't processed.<eos> What do you mean she wasn't processed?<eos> I don't know, OK?<eos> I'm trying to find out.<eos> You were scared of her.<eos> She should have been scared of you.<eos> What?
Did they hurt you?<eos> The baby?<eos> This is... incredible.<eos> Well, there's... nothing like this anywhere else on the planet.<eos> But we should get you home, darling.<eos> You look exhausted.<eos> I'll organise the doctor for you.<eos> - Jarrod... - A full checkup.<eos> I'm not staying.<eos> - What?
No, not my baby!<eos> - No!<eos> - It will be alright. Shh, shh, shh.<eos> - Jarrod, no.<eos> Please, please don't.<eos> - No. When you wake up it will all be over and you'll wonder what all the fuss was about.<eos> What have you done?<eos> No.<eos> - Do you want to find your mother?<eos> - My mother?
She's... in the mix.<eos> You bring me in a lot. And you never cast me.<eos> If there's something I need to change, I wanna change it.<eos> Every director says, "Bring me someone I don't know.<eos> Someone I haven't seen.<eos> I want a girl who's real."<eos> So, I bring you in so they can see that they don't actually want the thing they think they want.<eos> Look...<eos> I do cast some experimental projects on the side, if you are open to that kind of thing.<eos> - What kind of thing?
They're looking for unconventional women, whatever the hell that means, and I thought of you.<eos> I'll have my girl follow up with the details.<eos> It's not porn.<eos> If you ever accost me in the bathroom again... you'll be blacklisted from every casting call in Los Angeles.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Have they started the audition?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've actually never done one of these before.<eos> Are you SAG?<eos> What? I...
- I didn't get any sides.<eos> This is how this is gonna go, all right?<eos> No more talking. Just sit there... and look at me and smile.<eos> Okay?<eos> Tell us what the hell we're doing here.<eos> - Hi, Cherry.<eos> - Hey, baby.<eos> - How you doing, baby?<eos> - Good. This another one of your trashy vampire movies?<eos> What?
Hair pulling?<eos> - You don't like wrestling?<eos> - Well, I don't really know wrestling.<eos> You don't think wrestling is acting?<eos> It's not, is it? It's...<eos> It's more like a sport with costumes?<eos> Or...<eos> Sorry, are you... Are you hiring actors to play wrestlers, or are we the wrestlers?<eos> Yes.<eos> Which one?
- For my family.<eos> - What the fuck is this?<eos> Just do the move.<eos> We are. We are. We're just motivating it with backstory.<eos> There is a law...<eos> There is a law, and you broke it.<eos> And now, you will pay the ultimate price.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> That's it. Number 30, number 22, thank you.<eos> What?
- Listen, Patsy...<eos> You listen.<eos> Don't think because you're Vic Hill's boy, I won't come down on you.<eos> Money's owed, and money will be paid.<eos> You got until the weekend... or I take a finger... and the florist's.<eos> I've always fancied having me own concession.<eos> Keep working!<eos> Hands up, all the time!<eos> And a... yeah!<eos> One-two, one-two!
One, two, three, four...<eos> - Billy, stand up!<eos> Six.<eos> Seven. Bill! Get your ass up!<eos> - Eight!<eos> - Eight!<eos> Nine!<eos> No.<eos> Chepe Vago is the winner by TKO!<eos> Ah! Oh, son!
I understand the law, counselor.<eos> I also understand that the blood found on the door, which detectives cited as justification for probable cause, had no direct connection to Mr. Bianchi.<eos> In fact, they lacked any evidence indentifying the defendant as a suspect before they searched him.<eos> - Your Honor...<eos> - Ah!<eos> Which makes the weapon they found during their search inadmissible.<eos> Defense's motion to suppress granted.<eos> What piece comes next?<eos> Daddy?<eos> Hm?
Textbook.<eos> The guy bought us a sandwich.<eos> Which textbook are you reading that teaches sandwich entrapment?<eos> You gonna eat that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm destroying the evidence.<eos> Espada, meet Tess at the motor pool.<eos> I need you to drop off a sled.<eos> You sure? 'Cause Loman's gonna wanna keep me here on the case of mysterious sandwich entrapment.<eos> What?
- IA?<eos> - Don't worry, this guy's a dial tone.<eos> I gotta stop making decisions.<eos> I'm on a bad streak.<eos> Technically, deciding not to make decisions... is making a decision.<eos> Yeah, thanks, Socrates.<eos> Meanwhile, I'm running up credit card debt, and I can't pay my bills.<eos> Throw in a white picket fence, you've got the American dream.<eos> Seriously... I might be tempted to...<eos> To what?
Are you feeling okay?<eos> You know, my brother's a chiropractor.<eos> If I make a call, he could probably squeeze you in.<eos> And do I pretend that I know you?<eos> Almost every accusation of neglect by your ex-wife can be explained by dedication to your job, which doesn't usually garner much sympathy.<eos> But this is the FBI.<eos> Patriotism, service to country...<eos> Exactly, work those words, service and sacrifice, into every answer you can.<eos> You think we got a shot at joint custody here?<eos> What?
Well, he wouldn't exactly fit in a place like this, would he?<eos> Yeah, he just thinks that he should keep his distance.<eos> You know?<eos> That's why he refused your favor.<eos> Favors are like handshakes, it's hard to keep track of them all.<eos> I was in court today.<eos> Glad that went your way.<eos> It's good to see you, Harlee.<eos> I gotta get back to the grip and grin, but grab some food on your way out.<eos> Huh?
Yeah, you got nothing to worry about.<eos> Yeah, I'm aware it's a hurricane, but you don't have to evacuate.<eos> You're five miles from the flood zone.<eos> Ma?<eos> Ma?<eos> Well, look who's all cozy and warm.<eos> Captains, good to see you.<eos> 64th hasn't been the same without you.<eos> Yeah, fewer dirty jokes?<eos> By half.
I'm doing just fine without you today.<eos> Uh-huh? And with that last trick, ladies and gentlemen, we end our entertainment for this evening.<eos> Last call.<eos> Uh, I need to cut back on our bar nights.<eos> Cristina just took up the cello, and a good one's gonna set me back a grand.<eos> You know, Cristina's... she's a bright light.<eos> You'd move heaven and earth for that girl.<eos> And hell, too, if she asked.<eos> You know what?<eos> What?
Did Con Ed flag us, too?<eos> Ah, no.<eos> Linda?<eos> Hey...<eos> I'm sorry about earlier.<eos> Those credit card companies are a pain in the ass.<eos> I did get an apology from the bastards, so... we can consider that a... a minor victory.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Hey... wha...<eos> What?
Linda?<eos> Hey...<eos> I'm sorry about earlier.<eos> Those credit card companies are a pain in the ass.<eos> I did get an apology from the bastards, so... we can consider that a... a minor victory.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Hey... wha...<eos> What?<eos> Was Donnie the first one?<eos> What?
I was looking for control!<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> What did you uncover, Detective?<eos> You know, you're the profiler.<eos> What's your expert opinion based on the evidence?<eos> Obsession.<eos> You've changed the game, Harlee.<eos> Nothing is off limits now.<eos> Harlee, you know what my problem with her imitation of you is?<eos> Cuts into your bank account?
If the money isn't deposited in a week, they'll send those incriminating photos to the Feds.<eos> Miguel, I'm gonna give you the money I promised you, and you're gonna disappear.<eos> You paid him to go away?<eos> Some weeks ago, you violently pulled one of my associates, Detective Donald Pomp, out of a deposition.<eos> - Is there a question?<eos> - He's been missing for over three weeks.<eos> Donnie's dead.<eos> Loman killed him in self-defense.<eos> I've never risked what we have.<eos> Not for anything.
- Is there a question?<eos> - He's been missing for over three weeks.<eos> Donnie's dead.<eos> Loman killed him in self-defense.<eos> I've never risked what we have.<eos> Not for anything.<eos> You know that, and you know how I feel about you.<eos> That's Donnie.<eos> The first one.<eos> What?
On a scale of one to somebody died, how bad is it?<eos> A strong eight.<eos> And rising.<eos> We have a new guest.<eos> Tom Verco.<eos> IA bloodhound who brought down half the 42 precinct on that payola scam.<eos> He's here sniffing around about Donnie.<eos> And you guys are just sitting here while Loman gets in the ring with him?<eos> I tried to chaperone.<eos> Invitation only.
I love you, all right?<eos> Just go make beautiful music.<eos> The city really needs it today.<eos> Morning, Detective.<eos> How many more bodies can your conscience carry?<eos> Because I've hit max.<eos> Don't mistake me for a priest, Harlee.<eos> And you're a free woman now.<eos> Just don't get into any trouble.<eos> What?
Now you're going to read me the manual after last night?<eos> What happened last night?<eos> Did you have a nightmare?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was caught in a twisted vengeance quest.<eos> I had to make sure Wozniak got the message and started to take me seriously.<eos> So this isn't about your dead partner?<eos> Is there even a dead partner?<eos> Found in a car. Shot in the head, and the heart, with his tongue cut out.<eos> Because of Julia Ayres.
That... Cristina, it would be my pleasure.<eos> Tox screen confirms Fentanyl and they were able to stabilize her.<eos> She's unconscious, but we got an ID off of her swim team photo.<eos> Straight A student.<eos> Her parents there yet?<eos> On a train back from an overnight in Connecticut.<eos> It took some convincing for them to believe that we had the right girl.<eos> Deep down, they knew.<eos> Stay there until they show.<eos> What for?
Your role is to stop leaving dead bodies in your wake, keep your eyes open, and to get coffee.<eos> Inconclusive?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I think it means not conclusive.<eos> Only you're conclusively on drugs.<eos> Can I remind you that I was shot, Espada?<eos> Thank God for lab error.<eos> Who's side are you on anyways?<eos> Would you rather I got suspended?<eos> So what now?
What, no hello?<eos> We missed you, Terry.<eos> Figured we'd come by, shoot a few racks.<eos> I'd tell you to put your hips into it, but that seems to come natural.<eos> We hear you're into current events, Terry.<eos> Pouring money into city politics like you're a Rockefeller.<eos> I'm a sucker for worthy causes.<eos> How much small book does it take to cover<eos> - that tricked out Acura?<eos> - What Acura?

200, Oxy.<eos> I need a smile.<eos> Done.<eos> I'm not running a drive thru.<eos> You gotta step out to get served.<eos> You know, guys usually open the door for me.<eos> I'm setting expectations so you never say I don't treat you like I used to.<eos> That's charming.<eos> Slip the cash in that cup.<eos> Up against the car.

You know, you were lucky it was me that found it.<eos> Harlee, you don't need me to explain to you how my world works.<eos> You're smart.<eos> It's not so different from yours.<eos> But we're a little bit more selective who we let in the tent.<eos> You mean like dealers, pimps, and bookies?<eos> Remember, I used to run the door of that tent.<eos> Then you remember that the only reason we do it is to keep our backyard safe.<eos> So here's to the greater good.<eos> To the greater good.
Is there something going on between the two of you that I need to care about?<eos> No cameras, no witnesses.<eos> Got to work pretty hard to find that kind of privacy.<eos> Kind of thing that would require a plan.<eos> Well, probably someone familiar with her routine.<eos> Followed her, waited for the right opportunity.<eos> Shooter goes through that much trouble, kills her with a single shot, and then leaves a shell casing behind?<eos> Opened like a pro, closed like an amateur.<eos> It's Caroline.<eos> Huh?

Be a fall guy if you want, Loman, but don't make it so damn easy.<eos> Come on, give it up.<eos> Whoa, whoa.<eos> Easy.<eos> It responds to kindness.<eos> It responds to nothing.<eos> Hey, listen.<eos> Did you log in that cash from the forgery mill?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for your help.
I'm asking if it was suicide.<eos> No, it was a murder.<eos> One bullet to the head, execution style.<eos> - Tess.<eos> - Who would do that?<eos> Random psychopaths aren't roaming around executing women in the park at 7:00 in the morning.<eos> Did Caroline have any enemies?<eos> Is this a police interview?<eos> When was the last time you saw her?<eos> Last night.
Smart.<eos> She taught you well.<eos> You probably don't remember me.<eos> I think last time I saw you, you were five or six.<eos> I was your mom's training officer.<eos> My name's Caddie.<eos> You don't look like a cop.<eos> I'm retired.<eos> Do you want to leave a message for her?<eos> Delivery, actually.
It doesn't look promising.<eos> - So look harder.<eos> - We will.<eos> But you know the odds, right?<eos> I mean, I'm sure there's a stack of open, unsolved files on your desk right now.<eos> This is the woman I was gonna marry.<eos> She's not a file.<eos> None of them are.<eos> In your job, you ever have an instinct, follow a gut feeling?<eos> - All the time.
Well, ask what you want about Donnie Pomp, and let's get this over with.<eos> The DEA money that was stolen in the armored truck heist just showed up at the scene of a bust.<eos> Apparently Donnie Pomp is out there spending our hard-earned, stolen cash.<eos> Lying to the FBI is a felony.<eos> You told Espada that Donnie's the one who put it back into circulation.<eos> You and I both know that's impossible.<eos> I was your mom's training officer.<eos> My name's Caddie.<eos> Do you want to leave a message for her?<eos> Delivery, actually.
My name's Caddie.<eos> Do you want to leave a message for her?<eos> Delivery, actually.<eos> You've changed the game, Harlee.<eos> Nothing is off-limits now.<eos> You don't have to stay for this.<eos> A young woman took a single GSW to the head.<eos> The victim was engaged to James Nava.<eos> When was the last time you saw her?<eos> Last night.
Caroline was killed with my gun.<eos> When I find the guy that did this to you, I'm not gonna call the cops.<eos> Now, that clip of yours holds what?<eos> Nine, minus the one.<eos> That leaves a lot more bullets.<eos> What is obsession?<eos> I mean, what is obsession?<eos> Infatuation?<eos> Lust?<eos> Delusion?
Yeah, I turned her down.<eos> I pushed her out the door, where some monster put a gun to her head...<eos> Look, I didn't come here... to accuse you of anything.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> Do you know who this guy might be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Could be Ethan...<eos> I guess, this... this guy she started seeing from her firm.<eos> I thought it was for show.<eos> What?
James Nava, her ex... one of those square-jaw suits, probably has whips under his bed.<eos> Why don't we leave the profiling to the pros?<eos> Caroline never got over that guy.<eos> Said he was banging some hot skank from work.<eos> Congrats, Ethan.<eos> You're not as useless as you look.<eos> And that douchebag ex... he's the kind of guy that walks a woman home.<eos> And there's nothing under his bed... except handcuffs... occasionally.<eos> You'll tell someone if it starts talking to you, right?<eos> What?
Looks awfully friendly.<eos> And where I come from, friends don't force people to steal for them.<eos> Woz may not always, you know, fill in the blanks, but he's always looking out for us.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Maybe he was looking for a payday he didn't have to split six ways.<eos> All right... our lieutenant may be a lot of things, but he wouldn't cheat us.<eos> I trust him, and you should, too.<eos> Hey, Detective Tufo, congratulations.<eos> Why don't you take off that IA badge, and let's head to the parking lot for a little conversation?<eos> What?
More like a magician, considering how hard he's making it to find your gun.<eos> Well, he must have it on him wherever he is.<eos> C 725 Spring.<eos> 22 Willoughby number one...<eos> that's Nava's address.<eos> Well, that makes sense, considering that he followed Caroline from there.<eos> 350 Jay.<eos> 100 Centre.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What?
Maybe I already do, man.<eos> Espada, what the hell are you doing?<eos> - Painting.<eos> - You painted over the yellow.<eos> You wanted this yellow?<eos> What did Stahl ask in return for this intel on Bianchi's venture here?<eos> Julia and a thank you card.<eos> Do I have to sign it?<eos> Where's this mob front?<eos> Two houses down.
I killed him in Wozniak's house, but he tried to kill me first.<eos> I used a knife.<eos> I know.<eos> You know?<eos> Wozniak told you.<eos> And he told me it was self-defense.<eos> There was no setup, Loman.<eos> We all have to carry our own sins... or bury them.<eos> Hey, Rossi's in the van to central booking.<eos> What?
I am going to be a great dad some day because of you, and that's a hell of a gift.<eos> So... you got a gift too?<eos> You're... you want to transfer?<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't want to transfer.<eos> I have lost track of what it means to wear that.<eos> And I need some time away.<eos> Okay.<eos> So much for stronger together.<eos> One sec.
I stood up for you, Wallace.<eos> I owed the man.<eos> He kept me safe on the inside.<eos> Protection ain't free.<eos> Marcus... leave it be.<eos> I got an off-the-books situation.<eos> You turned in your badge.<eos> Everything's off-the-books with you.<eos> We're carrying heavy in the a.m.<eos> - On who?
He's in Italy.<eos> He said he needed to lay low for a while.<eos> The old country?<eos> That's what you're gonna go with?<eos> It's the truth.<eos> Whatever you want, I'll do it.<eos> Please. Please... no, please.<eos> You're lucky I like dogs.<eos> Get on the ground!<eos> Down on the ground!

He's in no condition to help anyone,<eos> - including himself.<eos> - Drop the weapon!<eos> NYPD.<eos> I'd listen to him, sweetheart.<eos> You got the AK, Karen.<eos> Just smoke 'em.<eos> - Guns down now!<eos> - Police.<eos> - On the floor!
There's no visitors here.<eos> Not until he's three hots and a cot at Metro.<eos> This is what happens when you don't play ball with me.<eos> The rest of your team gets to pay for your arrogance.<eos> He doesn't know anything about Julia.<eos> You're drilling a dry hole, but I'm sure you're used to that by now.<eos> I'm not even looking for anything from him.<eos> I'm collecting on your debt.<eos> So at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow, Detective Carlos Espada of the 64th precinct is going to be arraigned in U.S. District Court, and after that, it's out of both our hands, so you should start looking at group rates<eos> - on a really good lawyer.
You still learning the ropes?<eos> You know, some days I feel like I'll never get a full grasp.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You okay if I record this?<eos> Why not?<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't want this to be a puff piece.<eos> I'd love some texture.<eos> Interesting cases, unusual stories.<eos> Warts and all.
The FBI way.<eos> We're not gonna mention your name.<eos> But Stahl's getting more cutthroat by the hour.<eos> You need to help us stop him.<eos> Molly, if we don't stand up to him, nobody else will.<eos> You ever approach me again, I'll call Gail Baker directly.<eos> We pull the transport over.<eos> We say that we're U.S. marshals, and that we made a mistake.<eos> And then we just pull Espada out, and... and then we just take him.<eos> What?
Immediately.<eos> Then your father did something I'll never forget.<eos> He took off running, ran after your horse.<eos> By the time it circled back around, he was holding the reigns.<eos> He caught it for me?<eos> You know, in that moment, it all seemed possible.<eos> The life I wanted for you, for us.<eos> You made a pretty great life for us, Mom.<eos> You know, even with everything that he's put me through, sometimes I wish I could just say thank you.<eos> For that, and for this beautiful girl.
Promise me, Harlee.<eos> I need to hear you say it.<eos> Well, done, guys.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Loman.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Where we at?<eos> - Nothing yet.<eos> Wozniak got a call from Harlee, took off, gave no specifics.<eos> - Tufo?
That's right.<eos> I don't like the horses anyway.<eos> Your move.<eos> Is your name Adrian?<eos> It is.<eos> My name's Matt.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> You weren't supposed to look in this bag here, were you?<eos> But you did, didn't you?<eos> Yeah?
Come on in, come on in.<eos> Can we just talk outside?<eos> No, no, no, come on.<eos> Come on, we'll do it now.<eos> Sit down. I'll get you a drink.<eos> Boy, it's been a while since you've been here with everybody.<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> She's out to dinner with her friends, avoiding the riffraff.<eos> Here.<eos> Cheers.
I'm sorry.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come sit down.<eos> Where's Woz?<eos> Nurse says your boy's a fighter.<eos> It's gonna be a few hours til we know the extent of the damage, but he's stable.<eos> Why don't you go sit with the crew?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Loman.<eos> Thanks for that cover.
I just... got hard to hear that it was all part of a big plan.<eos> So what do you believe in?<eos> I believe in you.<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Of course.<eos> You doubt that?<eos> No.<eos> I saw you at the school today.<eos> I was... just had to drop off some paperwork.<eos> For the loan.
Detective Santos?<eos> What?<eos> Anybody who would want to do you or Lieutenant Wozniak harm?<eos> It's a big city.<eos> What, are you planning to move a body tonight?<eos> I was supposed to pick up a load of fertilizer for the Brooklyn Community Garden tomorrow.<eos> No good deed, right?<eos> - Detective Santos.<eos> - Captain.<eos> - Any news?
Gail, you're his supervisor.<eos> You have anything to say on his behalf?<eos> No. I don't.<eos> Sir...<eos> I have sacrificed everything.<eos> My marriage, my health, to serve this bureau.<eos> It is all that I have.<eos> Please don't take it away.<eos> I recommend an indefinite suspension.<eos> Effective immediately.
I'm sorry!<eos> This is nice, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, I mean, you're making it kind of weird.<eos> Am I making it weird?<eos> Little bit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cristina, your mom tells me you play the cello.<eos> Of course she did.<eos> I think she opens with that.<eos> What?
Am I making it weird?<eos> Little bit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cristina, your mom tells me you play the cello.<eos> Of course she did.<eos> I think she opens with that.<eos> What?<eos> I'm proud.<eos> Hey, if I'm not here to chaperone, will you two behave?<eos> What?
- No!<eos> - Where is he?<eos> Too bad I don't have a son to step in front of it for me.<eos> Woz!<eos> All right.<eos> - Your turn.<eos> - No...<eos> One bullet, five empty cylinders.<eos> No... no...<eos> - Woz...
Wants to meet at my place tonight."<eos> You spelled "requires" wrong.<eos> Oh, I'm trying to make it authentic.<eos> She strikes me as a bad speller.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Scratch 3-1-7-9.<eos> What was that?<eos> 3-1-7-9?<eos> Woz are you even... what?<eos> What?
You're not gonna like what you find!<eos> Will you accept a collect call from Riker's Island Correctional Facility?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Hi, Mama.<eos> Miguel, how are you, mijo?<eos> I miss you, Mama.<eos> I miss you, Mama.<eos> I miss you.<eos> When are you coming?<eos> Soon, next weekend.
We got his blackmail.<eos> And I bet he's run out of politicians to hide behind.<eos> Bianchi's gonna get what he deserves.<eos> He deserves a bullet.<eos> Why make it quick when he can face a lifetime locked up as a cop shooter?<eos> Closure.<eos> I have to confess, I wasn't sure you guys were gonna bring him in alive.<eos> I wouldn't have cried if he gave us a reason not to.<eos> - Solid case.<eos> - So far.
Ready or not, here I come!<eos> Cristina?<eos> Where are you?<eos> No, not behind the curtain.<eos> What was that?<eos> I think I heard something.<eos> No.<eos> You can't fool me.<eos> I know that you're hiding in the closet!<eos> What?
Not guilty.<eos> Mister Gomez?<eos> Given the brutal nature of this double homicide and that Mr. Bianchi as recently as two days ago deceived customs officials into believing he left the country, the people request that the defendant remain detained without bail.<eos> Mr. Kirschner?<eos> Your Honor, the guilt or innocence of my client...<eos> I thought Judge Gibson drew the case?<eos> Gibson had some sort of bizarre fender bender at lunch.<eos> They replaced him with Lowry.<eos> For the arraignment?<eos> The entire case now.
What girlfriend?<eos> My conflict of interest.<eos> She's one of the cops Bianchi went after.<eos> I told my boss about us.<eos> High profile nature of this case, he needed to know.<eos> Officially.<eos> Let me take you to lunch.<eos> You hungry?<eos> I could eat.<eos> Oops.

Nothing?<eos> Only thing I can give you is a motive.<eos> Quince.<eos> Where'd you find this?<eos> Someone put it in his hand.<eos> Guess they wanted to make sure you got the message.<eos> Quince is coming after you.<eos> It's a personal dispute, just not with me.<eos> Tell Wozniak he has a war coming his way.<eos> - Hey.
Do you remember an article you wrote about a year ago, hacker culture in Brooklyn?<eos> You read that?<eos> I read everything that ever had your name on it.<eos> There's a cache data on this, but it's encrypted.<eos> Are you in touch with any of those guys?<eos> Maybe they could help you open it, without seeing what the content is?<eos> What's on them?<eos> It's recordings that the Mob uses to blackmail people.<eos> And there might be some names you recognize.<eos> Yours?
For now.<eos> Bad guy that I was worried about got into a... fatal accident.<eos> What happened?<eos> Call it justice.<eos> The main thing is we get to have our lives back.<eos> Well, good, because that ferry ride to Jersey makes me so seasick.<eos> I would rather supervise a night of truffle fries with you and James.<eos> I can deliver on the fries.<eos> I don't know about the rest.<eos> What?
No, he didn't have to.<eos> He thinks I'm somebody I'm not.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Mom, you have to give him a chance.<eos> Show him the real you.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> You got my invitation.<eos> I did, Quince.<eos> Came to pay my respects to the dead.<eos> A little early for that.
Came at me again, I pushed him back.<eos> So much violence.<eos> His head hit on the sink.<eos> Then what happened?<eos> I went to get help.<eos> III tried saving him.<eos> Taking notes on how to be a detective?<eos> I was defending myself.<eos> Are you currently in a relationship with Detective Harlee Santos?<eos> What?
His other two stash houses are cleaned out.<eos> They're following the carrier here.<eos> - Are they close?<eos> - Couple streets away.<eos> And Wallace is sure the runner's gonna come this way?<eos> As soon as the house spots police, yeah.<eos> Smart system.<eos> Unless some detectives are waiting to take your entire supply.<eos> Yo, pipe down up there, Woz.<eos> What?
Smart system.<eos> Unless some detectives are waiting to take your entire supply.<eos> Yo, pipe down up there, Woz.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, yo, you lost?<eos> Actually, yeah, maybe you could help.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Is this address right?<eos> Police.<eos> On the ground.
You're right about that.<eos> The rest is just a scare tactic.<eos> Good luck, Detective.<eos> Rough collar?<eos> The runner resisted.<eos> Resisted what?<eos> Running into your fist?<eos> No, that he was unsuccessful.<eos> What's going on with Julia?<eos> What?
If anybody comes to you and asks you about what happened... I have nothing to tell them.<eos> I never even saw the person who did this.<eos> Now you have.<eos> This is my son.<eos> If anyone asks you about who did this to you... I need a denial.<eos> This wasn't the guy.<eos> Looks nothing like him.<eos> Then I guess our hour's up.<eos> Hell of a day.<eos> Hell of a night.
I wasn't sure how to say what I need to say.<eos> Well, you're in good company.<eos> I spent half the day trying to figure that out.<eos> So Quince won't be getting much sleep tonight?<eos> No.<eos> No, but the...<eos> The streets of Brooklyn will get some rest.<eos> Look away for one minute, and everything changes.<eos> Open your eyes, and you see something for the first time.<eos> Like her.

Yes, Ms. Hallam... everything.<eos> We flew her parents in from Wisconsin, see if we could shake her up, but she stayed dumb.<eos> She doesn't even want a lawyer.<eos> So, what can I do?<eos> Well, little Miss Walker here made one statement...<eos> "On Friday morning, 9:00 a.m., the world will hear what I've got to say""<eos> Look, we know she's part of this.<eos> I can't get anything out of her.<eos> I thought you could take a shot.<eos> In 124 minutes or less.
I'm not sure.<eos> You play it cool, but... I feel like there are some emotional issues there.<eos> It's crazy how much background the FBI can pull on the drop of a dime.<eos> The problem sometimes is knowing what to look for.<eos> - Needle in a haystack.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Ooh.<eos> I just pricked my finger.<eos> Good morning. I'm calling from the Grove Clinic to follow up on your trial.<eos> Yeah, what about it?
I'll tell you what it means.<eos> It means they want us to pay.<eos> One minute left.<eos> Young Cody Hallam has ball at the feet.<eos> He passes to Amy.<eos> Saved by Mama Hallam!<eos> Go.<eos> There we go.<eos> Here we go.<eos> What?
Young Cody Hallam has ball at the feet.<eos> He passes to Amy.<eos> Saved by Mama Hallam!<eos> Go.<eos> There we go.<eos> Here we go.<eos> What?<eos> Oh!<eos> But Cody Hallam scores!<eos> What?
All right.<eos> There.<eos> - Better?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I love you.<eos> What about you, hmm?<eos> Zar.<eos> Maxine Carlson.<eos> Says it's urgent.<eos> One second.
What's the difference?<eos> If they demanded a ransom, they could be prosecuted.<eos> They want us to make them an offer.<eos> Or they won't hand it over.<eos> How is it not still a ransom?<eos> Under the law?<eos> They can claim they just asked for a reward.<eos> Clever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> More like evil.
Um, can... can I speak with you for a minute?<eos> Sure.<eos> We can't afford to pay you.<eos> I hope the hospital told you that.<eos> Please don't worry, Mrs. Lewis.<eos> People think we're rich, but Jaquan was a seventh-round draft pick.<eos> We never even got the signing bonus.<eos> I'm still working two jobs.<eos> My fee has been taken care of.<eos> By who?
Mrs. Lewis, this Zara Hallam, my chief investigator,<eos> Oliver Yates, our psychological profiler, and Maxine Carlson, my second.<eos> Thank you, all of you, for being here.<eos> Um, w-what happens next?<eos> Well, first we require what we call "proof of life"<eos> to confirm that what's being ransomed exists.<eos> Oh, that... that blood sample matched Jaquan's.<eos> Dr. Rowe said so.<eos> Yeah, we have some, uh, questions about that.<eos> Like what?
Ever since then, my mother's been working two, sometimes three jobs to make ends meet.<eos> I spent every day after school hitting balls.<eos> I knew I had skill.<eos> I knew that if I could make it I could... provide for her like she provided for me.<eos> Now if you take that away from me, I have nothing.<eos> Oh, you know that's not true.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> In this game, it ain't over.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey, Jaquan.
Props for keeping up.<eos> I'm sorry, Miss, but Jaquan doesn't have anything near $6 million.<eos> There's something else on her mind.<eos> She's afraid.<eos> It's $6 million or nothing.<eos> Jaquan's mother wants him to start chemo, and if that happens then you get nothing.<eos> You asked me here to tell me that?<eos> Well, to be honest, I use any excuse to come to this restaurant.<eos> I also need a cheek swab.<eos> What for?
Well, to be honest, I use any excuse to come to this restaurant.<eos> I also need a cheek swab.<eos> What for?<eos> To confirm you're the donor.<eos> You've got the blood sample.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'll be in touch.<eos> You want us to follow her?<eos> No.<eos> Too risky.
I know how it is.<eos> Divorce?<eos> No.<eos> No, my dad died when I was 11.<eos> It must have felt like your whole world ended.<eos> After my grandma died, he, um...<eos> He gave me this necklace for protection.<eos> Said it would keep me safe always.<eos> You got kids?<eos> A boy and a girl.
The woman at the restaurant...<eos> You said she looked familiar.<eos> Yeah, I could swear I saw her someplace.<eos> Find out where.<eos> Got news for you.<eos> Analysis from that blood sample that we took from Kim at the restaurant.<eos> And?<eos> Confirmed she's a match.<eos> Really?<eos> What?
A pool?<eos> You got your left arm broken stealing water rations.<eos> I broke my arm para-sailing on Lake Union.<eos> This is... I don't know what this is.<eos> But I'm not taking the fall for Roger's murder.<eos> You killed him. You did it for Elena.<eos> I told you I don't know her.<eos> You have loved her since you were kids.<eos> I love my wife.<eos> Your wife. Laura.
What the hell was that about?<eos> I have no clue.<eos> So where does Hendrick go when he's not at home or work?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't even know where I've been in the past two days.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I may not know where I've been, but the GPS does.<eos> Work.<eos> Home.<eos> What about that?
- Yes, it is.<eos> They just want information, not a war.<eos> And we get expelled like Chad and his wife?<eos> Then we're expelled.<eos> Do you really want to risk our lives over your career?<eos> Over my practice? I don't.<eos> Practice?<eos> Just give him what he wants.<eos> Your ring.<eos> What?
What?<eos> All patched up?<eos> Good.<eos> I'm gonna ask one more time.<eos> What do you know - about Everclear? - Ben.<eos> - Where is your ring? - Ben.<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> You're gonna tell me what I want or I'm gonna blow her brains against the wall.<eos> Ben, please.<eos> Three...
I can tell. I haven't seen you around.<eos> Nice meeting you, Ben.<eos> Anastasia.<eos> You don't look like an Anastasia.<eos> You don't look like a Ben.<eos> Let me guess. Celebrating your promotion?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Charlie?<eos> Be a doll, champagne.<eos> To your success.
"There's gotta be a statute of limitations about this shit."<eos> You're damn right there does.<eos> Fuck me.<eos> There you go.<eos> Good mornin'.<eos> Hey.<eos> The, uh, gas tanks are filled.<eos> - That's a waste.<eos> - Why's that?<eos> Simple economics.
And I'd say I have leadership qualities, as well, but not to the point where I'd undermine the boss, or suck the air out of the room.<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Could you start this weekend?<eos> Uh, could you excuse me for a moment, please?<eos> On three, pop shove, right now.<eos> You just got hit by a girl!<eos> - Did I just see what I think I saw?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Good shot.
- Is Three fighting, too?<eos> Nah, he's fine. He's basically passed out.<eos> What you reading?<eos> You love that guy, huh?<eos> Yeah, except this one's non-fiction.<eos> It's about when he had to write the movie for Moby-Dick for some hot-shit director.<eos> Got no fucking rest.<eos> Almost killed him.<eos> You know what I read?<eos> My phone.
It's about when he had to write the movie for Moby-Dick for some hot-shit director.<eos> Got no fucking rest.<eos> Almost killed him.<eos> You know what I read?<eos> My phone.<eos> Texts.<eos> That's fucking it.<eos> - Hey, I was thinking.<eos> Maybe, uh... after you, like, invest some of that money or whatever, I could maybe... borrow some to go someplace?<eos> Like a vacation?

So, please, pledge with me now to save these animals.<eos> Just a small act of kindness can help save a life.<eos> For just $18 a month, we'll send the...<eos> They are eager to join her on the hunt, but still far too young.<eos> They would only endanger themselves and give away her presence.<eos> As prey migrate away from the drying plains so, too, must the lioness venture beyond her familiar territory... into the territory...<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> What is it?<eos> Fuck.<eos> Nothing.
- Oh, my God.<eos> You said "disappeared." What makes you think he was murdered?<eos> How'd Bruce take it when you dissolved the partnership?<eos> Uh, he didn't take it well, like I told you.<eos> So... that's why you emptied your bank accounts and left Chicago?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I have a business opportunity here.<eos> What are you implying?<eos> I think the two of you should know that Bruce was working with us... as an informant against them.<eos> What?
I accosted a kid at a store over fucking pistachio ice cream.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - No, it's not okay.<eos> It's not okay at all.<eos> And I... I'm not gonna be a victim over everything that happens.<eos> Especially since I'm responsible for most of it.<eos> Sorry, what'd you say?<eos> What the hell are they doing so near our house?<eos> That's probably because Charlotte punched the older kid in the face.<eos> - What?
Another one-two-three inning for the young...<eos> - Hi.<eos> I'm Sarah McLachlan, and I'm here to tell you about an innocent animal who's suffering and needs your help.<eos> You can help rescue her, help her get medicine, shelter...<eos> Let's get some fresh air and figure out how to wash more money.<eos> Something fucking stronger, all right?<eos> Smoke and mirrors?<eos> Come on, dickhead. Come on.<eos> Do I steal?<eos> Huh?
Okay. Money Laundering 101.<eos> Say you come across a suitcase with five million bucks in it.<eos> What would you buy?<eos> A yacht?<eos> A mansion?
It's as legitimate as anybody else's.<eos> Hi.<eos> What? You don't recognize me without my tits in your face?<eos> How's it going, Raven?<eos> Actually, my name's Margaret.<eos> - You got that pay stub? - Yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Are they all like this?<eos> With no company name? Just a number?<eos> - What about the safe?
- That's never gonna happen.<eos> If you get arrested, they can freeze everything.<eos> That's not gonna happen, either.<eos> What if I, uh... What if we... did something with the money?<eos> Maybe real estate?<eos> - Real estate.<eos> - As an investment.<eos> Wendy, I'm trying to save our fucking lives here, not help your new career.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> What?
Let's go to my office.<eos> Nice.<eos> Like a... like a serial killer's lair.<eos> - I have a job for you.<eos> - I thought I already had a job.<eos> There's a safe in Bobby Dean's office.<eos> I need what's inside.<eos> You're asking me to rob a strip club?<eos> I am.<eos> Why?
You're how old?<eos> Nineteen.<eos> - What year were you born?<eos> - 1998.<eos> Stripping might be every girl's dream, but it might not be for every girl.<eos> Read me?<eos> Turn around.<eos> Pull your pants up.<eos> Up higher.<eos> Up more, up your ass.
Go on.<eos> Close the door.<eos> Well, it ain't gonna suck itself, sweetheart.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I guess you're right.<eos> Stripping isn't for everyone.<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Hello?<eos> - I need two grand.<eos> What?
I don't think we need to go there, all right?<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Why not? Because he's a sweet, gentle little boy.<eos> - He makes his mother Mother's Day cards out of construction paper.<eos> I know he's a sweet boy, but he's a... He can be a bit strange at times, can he not?<eos> You can admit that, right?<eos> Every once in a while?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What?
Especially if...<eos> If what?<eos> What if it's genetic?<eos> - It's not that.<eos> - No, you know my brother's history.<eos> Wendy, there's no way it's that.<eos> This is a... a normal kid that is having some sort of adolescent death fixation.<eos> That's... that's normal.<eos> Yeah, but what if he's that... you know, that strange, beautiful kid who... one day goes and shoots up a high school?<eos> What then?
Just summers, from Chicago.<eos> But my mom hated it, though.<eos> You got boats? - Mm.<eos> Uh, not anymore.<eos> I'm more of a fly fisherman now.<eos> - You know any anglers around here?<eos> - There's a few. Not many.<eos> Well, if you know someone, I'd be willing to pay them to show me spots where the water really moves, so...<eos> How much you talking?<eos> Uh... hundred bucks?
I know. We just wanna talk to you about what's going on, you know.<eos> Everyone's running in every different direction. It's, uh, you know...<eos> There's a lot... there's a lot going on.<eos> And, uh... things can... It can be...<eos> - Strange.<eos> - Yep.<eos> And, um... it's a big adjustment, especially when you go to a town where you don't know anybody except your own family.<eos> It can be lonely.<eos> Jonah, did you kill those animals?<eos> What?
All units proceed with caution.<eos> Turn the music off!<eos> Get off the stage! Ma'am, get off the stage!<eos> Shots fired?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Who the hell said shots fired?<eos> There were no goddamn shots fired.<eos> I wanna see a fucking warrant.<eos> Where the fuck are you going?<eos> What?
- Just go.<eos> Five minutes. Wait for me.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> I mean, did you even have a fucking plan?<eos> A stethoscope or a bobby pin at least? Jesus Christ.<eos> What the fuck did you trick me into?<eos> 25% of some worthless shit?<eos> Can you just shine the light down here, please?<eos> If I get popped for this, I'll be sent away for years.<eos> For what?
I know that a lot of you have been through a lot, and... and I appreciate your patience.<eos> I... I won't take much of your time.<eos> I just wanted to simply introduce myself.<eos> My name is... is Marty Byrde and, as of now, I'm the proud owner of this gentlemen's club.<eos> Uh, I'm not gonna stand up here and disparage your former boss.<eos> You all know that this club was breaking laws.<eos> Uh, the one thing that I... that I wanna say, I wanna make crystal clear is that, you know, you all have rights.<eos> You have the right to self-esteem. - That's right. - The right to self-respect.<eos> I'm just... I'm happy to say that, uh, things are changing around here.<eos> All for the better.
It's part of it.<eos> Could you explain all of it?<eos> Okay.<eos> Money Laundering 101.<eos> Let's start with this.<eos> Let's say you come across a suitcase with five million bucks in it.<eos> What would you buy?<eos> A sports car?<eos> A yacht?<eos> A mansion?
- Highland Park.<eos> - Naperville.<eos> Ah, the Naper-thrill.<eos> Nice.<eos> I'm Zach.<eos> Charlotte.<eos> You gotta...<eos> See, here, that goes in there...<eos> So you live here? Now?<eos> Uh, only for the summer.
Man tits.<eos> Okay. Well, obviously, I didn't kill anyone.<eos> I know. If you're a killer, then I'm fucking Snow White.<eos> - And I don't see any dwarfs around.<eos> - Right.<eos> So, listen, Ruth, um, I need you to, um, take care of things around here for a little while.<eos> Can you do that? Run stuff?<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Just through the holiday weekend.
Although, I've seen my share of bare bodies bloated beyond recognition... tourists turned to Swiss cheese by propeller blades...<eos> They usually ascribe it to ignorance.<eos> But... I guess you can't discount the... possibility of something more sinister at work.<eos> Is that why you have all these guns?<eos> If that's what you wanna say.<eos> My parents don't really like guns.<eos> Why the hell did they move here if they don't like guns?<eos> You know, a kid can't pass middle school health class until he had his hunter's safety badge.<eos> It was for work.<eos> What kinda work?
I watched Sheriff Nix fish it out right in front of him.<eos> All of which means he's more afraid of his Boss than he is of us.<eos> Only question is, does he have reason to be?<eos> Ash!<eos> Now, you know what you need to do for us now, don't you?<eos> About Mr. Byrde.<eos> Yes, Ma'am.<eos> - Best get to it, then.<eos> - Yes, Ma'am.<eos> Another nest?
- ♪ Thy power throughout ♪ - Ash is here to help with the boat.<eos> - ♪ The universe displayed... ♪<eos> As long as we distribute on the water... the Cops can't touch us.<eos> They've been trying to tame this place 200 years, and when they couldn't, they figured they'd try and flood us out.<eos> ♪ My savior, God, to thee ♪<eos> But man cannot tame what God wishes to be wild.<eos> I have some wonderful news.<eos> Soon, our faith community... is gonna have a home. - Yeah!<eos> - Praise Jesus!<eos> - Yeah. A real home!
All right, hand me that patch kit.<eos> It's not you, you know.<eos> - What?<eos> - That girl...<eos> She just doesn't know who she is yet.<eos> I mean, without the church, we're back to the Blue Cat and the club, and I just...<eos> I don't know if those two can handle the rest of it, you know?<eos> You'll make it work.<eos> Yeah, what if I can't?<eos> What then?
- Come in here.<eos> - I gotta get back to the club.<eos> It'll... just take a minute. Come on.<eos> Yeah, just... just wait right here.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Sit.<eos> Is this a boy?<eos> Is it someone at home?<eos> It's gonna sting.<eos> - One more.
Yeah, just... just wait right here.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Sit.<eos> Is this a boy?<eos> Is it someone at home?<eos> It's gonna sting.<eos> - One more.<eos> I tripped.<eos> I tripped once.<eos> Very long time ago.
She'll turn, too.<eos> He'll make her.<eos> He's fucked.<eos> - Protocol calls for backup.<eos> - Oh, fuck protocol.<eos> - You can't fuck protocol, Roy.<eos> - Look, we only got to this point 'cause me and him have developed goodwill.<eos> So let's not bring in a gaggle of feds and fuck it all up.<eos> I'm not saying a gaggle.<eos> Just me.
And that drug dealer has to feed his family. They're innocent.<eos> They can't starve, can they?<eos> - Jonah, how about we just...<eos> - They need a house and clothes.<eos> And the family needs a car.<eos> There's even this theory that says drug money was the only thing that prevented the collapse of the global economy in 2008.<eos> You know, when real estate went bust.<eos> Because drug money was the only cash available to prop up big banks.<eos> Not to mention the 350 million narco-dollars that paid for bridges and roads and health care... probably even education.<eos> Maybe even part of this school.
- How's Grace?<eos> - She's good.<eos> She's getting close.<eos> - That's good to hear.<eos> What is it you said you do for a living?<eos> Well, we got bees, flowers... livestock.<eos> That's our piglet on a spit.<eos> - Just working farm.<eos> - And I make soap.<eos> - Flowers.
- She's good.<eos> She's getting close.<eos> - That's good to hear.<eos> What is it you said you do for a living?<eos> Well, we got bees, flowers... livestock.<eos> That's our piglet on a spit.<eos> - Just working farm.<eos> - And I make soap.<eos> - Flowers.<eos> What kind of flowers?
"Caters to the high-end spin fisherman who won't settle for anything but the best."<eos> We'll have Pflueger open face reels. Simms lug sole waders.<eos> Brass and nickel bodies and blades.<eos> Turn it over.<eos> "Co-founders Robert Powell and Russ Langmore."<eos> Your name should come first, you know.<eos> Alphabetical order.<eos> This whole thing was your idea.<eos> - Anyway, you wanted to talk.<eos> What?
You think I wanted to see that even once, Wendy?<eos> If you knew, why didn't you confront me?<eos> And what would I say? Anything!<eos> Anything at all.<eos> Instead of pushing all of those emotions down, distancing yourself - from anything you feel. - Hang on...<eos> Do not change the subject to me 'cause we're talking about you.<eos> - We're talking about that.<eos> - You have walled me out!<eos> - Wendy, we're talking about you...<eos> - But Bruce?
- Whatever, whatever.<eos> - I see it.<eos> You're all right.<eos> I need more time to warm up.<eos> All right, Del.<eos> Right down the middle.<eos> - Have to account for the wind.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Damn. Hell of a shot, Del.<eos> - Beautiful.
You know, I had to reschedule one day, last minute. They pitched a fit.<eos> And I did a damn good job for them, too.<eos> - What... so you were fired?<eos> - It was mutual.<eos> This is the second time this month that you left a job.<eos> Oh, come on, please. My ankle's been bothering me.<eos> - Hi, Barb.<eos> - Oh, hi, sweetie.<eos> - Hey. - Sorry I'm late.<eos> Oh, what?
Well, she just lost another job.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> No, but you were obviously thinking something.<eos> - Are you irritated?<eos> - No.<eos> But what were you thinking?<eos> Well, she's just, you know...<eos> Her eyes, it looks like she might be on something.<eos> - Like what?
You tell those families everything happens for a reason.<eos> No, sometimes people make decisions, shit happens, and we gotta act accordingly.<eos> Or you can... crawl in a hole and die, you know?<eos> Well, it was a shitty thing for me to say and...<eos> I'm sorry, bud.<eos> Honey?<eos> Wendy?<eos> Jonah?<eos> Guys, anybody home?<eos> - Hey, guys. Hi.
- Hang on.<eos> Oh, my God. She's out of her mind.<eos> Ma?<eos> Okay, don't put any weight on it.<eos> - I'm gonna call the ER, okay?<eos> - I'm okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Give me your arm. All right.<eos> Ready?<eos> One, two...
To clean your money.<eos> You will be able to earn enough to afford your great-great-grandkids' tuition.<eos> You know how it works.<eos> You think your life is going one way, and... then you look over here and it's different.<eos> Like that, in the blink of an eye, it changes.<eos> - Grab what you can while you can.<eos> - I, just, uh...<eos> You know...<eos> What?<eos> The risks?
Besides, he... he wouldn't have any reason to deal with your accounts at all.<eos> So add loyalty to friends as a personal ethic, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is it me or do you sound like someone who wants the gig?<eos> No. That's just the way my brain works. Just playing out the scenario.<eos> In another world... possibly.<eos> But in this world, the... the one that's reality... Wendy would never go for it.<eos> And I can respect that.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Cheers.
- I know you're tough, Ma.<eos> Everyone in this world knows you're tough.<eos> You don't have to prove anything here.<eos> I said no. I don't want them.<eos> Look, there's no prizes for suffering.<eos> You just feel shitty.<eos> And I hate seeing you like this.<eos> Please... until you feel better, please...<eos> For me.<eos> - Just this once.
- I felt like I should.<eos> get a move on.<eos> He just sits there.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Is he dangerous?<eos> no.<eos> He's not dangerous. He's a colleague.<eos> Why don't you wave to him?<eos> Buddy?<eos> nothing.
but why do you have it?<eos> I'm an FBI agent.<eos> And I have you on conspiracy to commit murder.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Class B felony in Missouri is five to 15 years...<eos> Fuck you talking about?<eos> I don't want you to serve that.<eos> I've got a way you don't have to.<eos> I need Martin Byrde.<eos> What?
though.<eos> - And why is that?<eos> My engineers would have to figure out how to suspend the painting in a way that won't topple the corpse.<eos> Probably a ceiling mount.<eos> yeah.<eos> That'll do it.<eos> I also worked up a rough estimate of the other items we spoke about on the phone.<eos> The full buffet.<eos> Did you decide on a head count?<eos> - Between 100 and 150.
And it seems to me... you're trying to solve that problem by upselling and overcharging a man in grief... who is my friend.<eos> So... what if I had an alternate solution?<eos> There's no hit man out front.<eos> I transferred the last of the eight.<eos> - We're done?<eos> - For now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We did it.<eos> I want one of those.<eos> Cheers.
Boyd?<eos> - Thought you wanted food.<eos> - They can go alone.<eos> take my truck.<eos> Keys are in it.<eos> Boyd.<eos> - Where the fuck we going?<eos> - Shut up and get over here.<eos> I'm killing him tomorrow.<eos> What?
You know that.<eos> Can you take your call outside?<eos> - It's exactly how she went after Marty.<eos> - The game's on.<eos> fuck your game.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Rob.<eos> calm down.<eos> - Pick her up.<eos> - On what?
Get in. Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.<eos> You have any idea why I have a preacher down at my station holding a baby he's convinced that you cut straight out of his wife's womb?<eos> I got no clue.<eos> I... barely know the man.<eos> Sure as hell ain't got no quarrel with him.<eos> - Who found the body?<eos> - Oh, we haven't found one yet.<eos> Well, where's the crime scene?<eos> We don't have one.<eos> Witnesses?
Now, there's gonna be men coming here, they're gonna be looking for answers I can't give.<eos> They made a deal with us, and they're gonna honor it.<eos> And if they don't, then you're in partnership with us now.<eos> And we know how to look after our own.<eos> Right now, you go home, relax, maybe get yourself a frozen custard.<eos> Me and Darlene will clean up this mess.<eos> Turn the vehicle off, drop the keys on the ground.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Open the door. Exit the car slowly. Hands up.<eos> On the ground.
Belle, I wanna tell you something.<eos> I have never been as happy as I am right now.<eos> You're gonna make me cry.<eos> Keep going.<eos> What is it?<eos> I've never felt more alive... ♪ If you have half a brain ♪<eos> I've never felt this free... to be who I am.<eos> And it's because of you.<eos> Uh, honey, have you seen my, uh...?<eos> What?
- No, no, no.<eos> Say you understand.<eos> - I...<eos> - I understand.<eos> - Good.<eos> When you get to the house, my guy will be there, okay?<eos> Okay. He'll need to know everything. Every detail.<eos> He'll tell you what to do, what you need to say.<eos> Any questions he asks, you tell him the truth.<eos> The whole truth, son.
- do you work for, puto? - I just drive.<eos> I don't know shit.<eos> Who... the...<eos> - fuck?<eos> - Mr. Gilbert.<eos> Who the fuck is Mr. Gilbert?<eos> He's Roy Gilbert.<eos> You don't fuck with this guy.<eos> I wanna fuck Roy Gilbert.<eos> And you.
You're just doing your job.<eos> You know, I'm gonna let you go, man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You'll be okay.<eos> As long as you do exactly what I tell you.<eos> I'm here to help you help yourself.<eos> You're gotta take the first step, okay?<eos> Come on inside.<eos> Where are you headed?<eos> North.
So... you talk?<eos> Yeah. Well, it was more like an argument.<eos> I was trying to get him to stop doing what he was about to do.<eos> - So, it was heated?<eos> - You touch your face and all?<eos> - What?<eos> Your face, did you touch it at all during the argument?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Probably.<eos> Why?
- I grabbed the thing.<eos> - The what? From where?<eos> The... On the table, the fucking dolphin statue.<eos> And then, um...<eos> I swear, I just was trying to make him stop, you know?<eos> I just wanted to get him to st...<eos> So, you hit him?<eos> I hit him.<eos> From behind?<eos> In the head?
- The what? From where?<eos> The... On the table, the fucking dolphin statue.<eos> And then, um...<eos> I swear, I just was trying to make him stop, you know?<eos> I just wanted to get him to st...<eos> So, you hit him?<eos> I hit him.<eos> From behind?<eos> In the head?<eos> Just once.
So, you hit him?<eos> I hit him.<eos> From behind?<eos> In the head?<eos> Just once.<eos> And then?<eos> And then he went down onto the ground.<eos> And then you hit him again?<eos> - Yeah, I guess.<eos> - Three more times?
Okay, and then?<eos> I-I-I can't remember.<eos> Try.<eos> I was freaking out.<eos> So, did you sit down at all?<eos> No, I don't know.<eos> I can't... I don't think so.<eos> Okay. Well, you must've done something.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> What?
- He's already on Marco's phone.<eos> All right.<eos> Now tell me what happened.<eos> So, I come in... and, uh, then I see him. - Who?<eos> - Eric O'Bannon.<eos> And, uh... he's standing over the body.<eos> Standing here like this.<eos> And then I come in and he runs off.<eos> Yeah, it's not enough, though.<eos> So, what else?
And by the way, Kevin, this is all your choice, you know?<eos> If you weren't here, I can try to make that work, but if you were here... I could turn you into a hero.<eos> Right? You tried to save Marco's life.<eos> Great.<eos> I mean, we got Marco's gun here.<eos> - we got you standing there.<eos> And then Eric sees you entering the house, he raises the gun.<eos> Yeah, maybe...<eos> Oh, yeah. That's good, yeah.<eos> What?
That'll sell it, man.<eos> Prove there was another person in the room.<eos> How does him picking up the gun prove he's here?<eos> Because he shot you.<eos> And then you call 911, and you report it.<eos> No fucking way.<eos> Stand still and let's finish this.<eos> We're gonna wait here till my brother gets here.<eos> Listen, do not fucking shoot me.<eos> My gas.
Stand still and let's finish this.<eos> We're gonna wait here till my brother gets here.<eos> Listen, do not fucking shoot me.<eos> My gas.<eos> Jesus fucking Christ.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> - My gas.<eos> - What?<eos> You got gas?<eos> My gas.
Okay, we're ready to go. Let's go!<eos> Go, get in, get in!<eos> All right, first song to come on, it's an omen.<eos> Oh, no. I do not believe in radio voodoo.<eos> ♪ And if we threw it all away ♪ - Oh.<eos> - ♪ Things can only get better ♪<eos> - Oh, shit. It's a sign.<eos> - Turn it up! - Yeah!<eos> ♪ Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh Whoa whoa whoa-oh-oh ♪<eos> Holy shit.
Okay, this is real.<eos> There are cameras.<eos> Does anyone else feel the need - to pee and puke?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How are we gonna fill all these seats?<eos> What do you think, huh?<eos> Me and Florian and the bellhops have been working on it all morning.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Are you ready to rumble?<eos> Check.
- and be entertaining.<eos> - You're a quitter.<eos> I'm a quitter?<eos> And it looks like She-Wolf wins the match.<eos> Can we get this guy some coffee?<eos> And now a quick word from our sponsor.<eos> - Who here wants to save, save, save?<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Are we gonna stay for the second half? Wanna get some dinner?<eos> No. What?
Honey, what's your name?<eos> My name... My name is Liberty Belle.<eos> And I'm just a small-town girl, trying to do the right thing, the thing any American girl would do in the face of evil, and no matter how...<eos> I'm so overwhelmed.<eos> Thank you all!<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a beautiful moment on a beautiful day.<eos> There's your crown, sweetheart.<eos> Like a princess.<eos> What?
I don't know how it happened, but here we are, folks.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Welfare Queen is tonight's Queen of the Ring.<eos> The crown is hers.<eos> That's our show, folks.<eos> That's all we got.<eos> Total pandemonium here at the Hayworth.<eos> Who will battle Welfare Queen<eos> - for next week's crown? - What the fuck?<eos> What?
You wanna grab a drink?<eos> No.<eos> We're not there.<eos> They needed that tape 20 minutes ago.<eos> Hold your horses.<eos> Almost done.<eos> Glen probably canceled us already, ordered ten more hours of Dr. Gene Scott ranting about fucking UFOs.<eos> Here's the jump.<eos> And... done.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.
I got the tape!<eos> Sorry! Sorry!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I got it! I got it.<eos> Finally.<eos> - Are we sure this is the right channel?<eos> - Yes. - Yes.<eos> - or your money back...<eos> - Are people gonna like it?<eos> - The free beauty guide...
This is not Alice. This is not Alice.<eos> Just keep telling yourself that.<eos> You have got to stop.<eos> Fine.<eos> Let me out of this trap, and I'm gone.<eos> Okay, look, Alice...<eos> Evil Thing Inside of Me That Used to Be Alice...<eos> I have to say the words to open the trap.<eos> Of my own volition.<eos> Out loud.
$1 million?<eos> In gold.<eos> Paper money is for drug dealers and idiots.<eos> Look, Goldie will tell you I'm good for it.<eos> Can you just do it now and we'll pay you later?<eos> Bars.<eos> Two big bars.<eos> Maybe 60 pounds.<eos> That's all.<eos> What?
That poor girl is fucked.<eos> And you are suggesting?<eos> Let her stay.<eos> I know that you expelled Kady and that you are not generally keen on granting asylum, especially to hedges.<eos> Yes, well, this is a special case.<eos> Julia and I have a past.<eos> Handle it however you want, but for the record, that girl will be safer at Brakebills. Mm.<eos> "How to transfer the energy from one being" "and transform it."<eos> Hey, what... what are you two doing here?<eos> What?
The victim of a fucking rape by a trickster god.<eos> Look, I got to do this, okay?<eos> I owe her.<eos> So?<eos> You gonna ask the traveler you just fucked the shit out of to help?<eos> I mean, no, I didn't really feel like I had the right.<eos> That's noble.<eos> But ask.<eos> Not gonna lie, I always wanted to rob a bank.<eos> To our little thievery corporation.
Let's see.<eos> "The Quarterback"?<eos> Goes back 15 seconds. Get it?<eos> Quarter of a minute?<eos> Yeah, Richard did like his dad jokes.<eos> Anyway, I thought it could be useful, but at this rate, I won't actually get it to work for weeks.<eos> And I guess I'd be weighed down lugging it anyway.<eos> It's got a pretty small radius of influence.<eos> Julia, you can't come.<eos> What?
The sigil I just touched 'cause someone messed up the buoyancy math.<eos> Oh, that is not good.<eos> Eliot, what's going on?<eos> How do I put this?<eos> Penny fucked up.<eos> No, it's your stupid device.<eos> I'm stuck now.<eos> Penny's incepting my... never mind.<eos> Just trust me, we have to get him out of that vault now.<eos> Or, say, sometime in the previous ten minutes.
I've always been good at math.<eos> You okay? - Oh, shit. Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right. Princess rescued.<eos> Let's collect our reward and go.<eos> Yes!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Q, stop! Oh!<eos> Shit!<eos> Oh, no.
Do I want to know how you managed to do this without waking me up?<eos> Probably not, but the effects are harmless, I promise, kind of.<eos> All right. We've had our fun.<eos> Let's get back to work.<eos> What's with the "We're all gonna die" face?<eos> I mean... I know what you mean.<eos> Bellamy should be back by now.<eos> Hunting parties go radio-silent.<eos> It's nothing new.<eos> What else?
You've made it clear you're planning to die, planning to leave me alone.<eos> Which is my choice, not Clarke's.<eos> She put herself on this list, by the way.<eos> You still think it's all good?<eos> Look. I'm sure she has a reason.<eos> Clarke's deciding who's worth saving.<eos> That... that is just great.<eos> Guess what, Monty.<eos> You're not.<eos> What?
I hope you're right.<eos> There she is!<eos> Faster, Helios!<eos> This way, we'll cut her off!<eos> Stop her!<eos> It's over, Octavia.<eos> Don't fight it.<eos> Roan wants you alive. Come quietly.<eos> That'll happen.<eos> One in the leg.
If my name is drawn.<eos> We'll do a lottery.<eos> You can't force people to put themselves in danger.<eos> Well it's dangerous if we just sit here and wait.<eos> You have a better suggestion?<eos> Or you prefer to run out to one of the cars and take your chances out there. Anyone?<eos> Then that's the way it's going to be.<eos> Where am I going?<eos> Another mile.<eos> Then a... Then a right on Beacher.
Long duration space missions.<eos> Criminals were put into hypersleep and given Nightblood to protect against solar radiation.<eos> Nice of her to share that with our ancestors on the Ark.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The Nightblood protein chains are broken.<eos> How did she get them to bind to the blood cells?<eos> I thought you hated molecular biology.<eos> She's seizing.<eos> - Ok. - Grab her neck. Ok.<eos> Ok. Ok. On her side, on her side.
Lotti!<eos> I lost my teddy bear.<eos> Can I give you a hug instead, darling?<eos> Your boss send you to keep an eye on me?<eos> No, two eyes.<eos> And he ain't my boss.<eos> You always do what Albert says?<eos> When I fancy the job.<eos> I'll get my share of that gold.<eos> One way or another.
Diamonds.<eos> A fistful.<eos> Now you in or you out?<eos> - I'm in. - Splendid.<eos> For 15 grand.<eos> - You guarantee delivery?<eos> - Guaranteed.<eos> Van, driver, out the back.<eos> Piss off.<eos> Left.
Hi, darlin'.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Mrs. Reid not like the wreath?<eos> No, no, she liked it, all right.<eos> You missing' me, then?<eos> Do you know there's gold on the street, Vic?<eos> Armored truck heist.<eos> Well, I um...<eos> I did hear a rumor. Just... got me thinking, it brought up some feelings.<eos> What kind of feelings?
Don't shoot!<eos> Allez encule!<eos> Bad dream! Bad dream!<eos> Where is my Schmeckel?<eos> And where is my diamonds?<eos> Schmeckel!<eos> Go after them!<eos> They shot the tires out!<eos> They got the pouch!<eos> - What pouch?
I didn't do my job?<eos> I didn't do my job?<eos> I don't remember a part of this job where I shoved those Mollys down your throat!<eos> You need to be a little bit more decisive if you're gonna prosper in this line of work...<eos> Albert.<eos> There you go. See?<eos> You are coming with me to Saul Gold, and that is final!<eos> To the airport, or we'll bleed you out like a chazzer.<eos> It's a pig.<eos> Thanks for the good times, Bubba.
My God.<eos> My God!<eos> Where did you get these?<eos> If I told you, I'd have to kill you.<eos> What do you want me to do with them?<eos> Sell them, and get me back my watch.<eos> Gold's at a premium right now, I should be able to get you an excellent valuation.<eos> - Yeah, one small hitch.<eos> They're stolen.<eos> Most likely more than once.
Yeah, we do.<eos> It's ours.<eos> I'll get them to share that gold, one way or another.<eos> - So, what's going on?<eos> - Saul Gold's going on.<eos> He's called a job on.<eos> You pick up my clients, the Heimels, from the airport.<eos> What else are we transporting other than the Heimels, Mr. Gold?<eos> Diamonds.<eos> A fistful.
What? For an analog impresario in the digital age?<eos> No, I've long been supplanted by the hacker whiz kid.<eos> Effing new school guys.<eos> I have an expertise that nobody seems to have the patience for.<eos> Yeah, but it turns out I may have a job... for your specialist expertise, Norman.<eos> Steady as he goes.<eos> I've only got 20 quid on me.<eos> I don't want your pocket change.<eos> Tell me... where are your slippers, boy?<eos> Slippers?
- Goat milk bar.<eos> - Screen printing business.<eos> The virtual reality app.<eos> The bike shop!<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Where's the bag?<eos> What bag?<eos> What do I look like?<eos> Well, you're 5'10-ish, dark, cropped hair.<eos> Hazelnut eyes.
Bingo.<eos> Give us a minute, would you, Charlie? Who is that lump, Al?<eos> You don't wanna know.<eos> Patsy.<eos> So what's it gonna be, Albert?<eos> The bolt cutters or a happy ending?<eos> Here you are.<eos> It's all accounted for.<eos> Every last bean.<eos> Skin of your teeth, son.
How did that turncoat get onto us?<eos> I have absolutely no idea.<eos> That one... might... might just be on me.<eos> The video.<eos> My bloody slippers.<eos> Slippers?<eos> Make some sense, Charlie.<eos> Fink cornered me the other day.<eos> Spouting some nonsense about seeing my slippers on the heist video.<eos> What?
Give him praise.<eos> Give him adoration.<eos> So it appears you have inherited your father's spirit for adventure.<eos> Something like that, Father John.<eos> Life's either a great adventure or nothing at all, my son.<eos> I have a parish project I'd like to discuss with you.<eos> Give whatever you can give.<eos> Reach in your pocket and...<eos> Are you looking for redemption, mate?<eos> Redemption?
Life's either a great adventure or nothing at all, my son.<eos> I have a parish project I'd like to discuss with you.<eos> Give whatever you can give.<eos> Reach in your pocket and...<eos> Are you looking for redemption, mate?<eos> Redemption?<eos> Before lunch?<eos> Your path begins here, brother.<eos> With Father John.<eos> For a tenner.
The price is 10 million pounds sterling.<eos> Blah blah, I like it!<eos> I'll buy it.<eos> Well, you won't be disappointed, sir...<eos> Sheikh Ze...<eos> Zash...<eos> Zee... 4:00pm tomorrow, we'll be in touch about the location, and your men can pick up the bath.<eos> Thank you so much, Sheikh Zeshan.<eos> Throw another log on for me, love.<eos> Nice day at the beach, darling?
All of it. He wants all of it!<eos> A ten-million-pound gold wedding gift.<eos> I mean, money is just no object to this guy.<eos> So all the gold gone in one fell swoop? Ten million quid?<eos> Simple as that?<eos> Well, there is one small catch.<eos> - What catch?<eos> We have to smelt it first. Smelt it?<eos> Into what?<eos> - A bathtub.
Won't it melt?<eos> That's the whole idea, darlin'.<eos> Lost wax casting.<eos> It's in the name.<eos> Come on, girls!<eos> Time is a 'wasting!<eos> Ready to pour?<eos> Ready so.<eos> Alchemists and metallurgists have been in our family for generations.<eos> Millennia.
With all due respect, Sheikh, this is an exquisite piece.<eos> As my assistant here plainly pointed out, this is a 24-karat bath.<eos> A collector's item.<eos> Handmade by the finest artisans.<eos> Well, there are other... people interested.<eos> I'll take it, I'll take it.<eos> If you could transfer the agreed funds...<eos> - Ring it up.<eos> - Yes, 2-5-3-6-7-1...<eos> - Zero.
Up to your old tricks again, Bob?<eos> Oi, be careful with my things!<eos> Come on!<eos> - Find anything? - Nothing here, sir.<eos> All right, well, check in there.<eos> - Done, checked, it's...<eos> - Check again.<eos> Sir!<eos> I found something.<eos> For Christ sakes!
There is no time, space or motion in the matter of the heart!<eos> But not that you would know that, Billy, 'cause yours is carved out of solid oak.<eos> You're damn straight.<eos> Ain't nothing in those fairy tales for me, mate.<eos> You couldn't leave this one alone, could you?<eos> - Me?<eos> - What chance would I have anyway?<eos> When Albert Hill rode into town on his stallion...<eos> With his spurs jangling and his six shooter glistening in the high sun.<eos> Just this one time!
Sir, the very man who hijacked the gold bullion in the first place is now walking the pavement at the precise moment that same gold bullion has staged its comeback tour.<eos> Interesting timing, I'll say you that.<eos> Interesting timing.<eos> It's Vic Bloody Hill.<eos> The gold has been on the streets for seven days.<eos> And you have how many leads, exactly?<eos> We don't have a solid lead as of yet, sir, but...<eos> Then I suggest... You focus your attention on finding and locating Hill.<eos> He may be more effective at locating the gold than your entire unit, Dwyer.<eos> And Dwyer?
The very best that friends can be.<eos> And if we ever disagree...<eos> Well, piss off and here's to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, it's in the most difficult times that we learn who our true friends are.<eos> Whether we've known each other for ten days... or ten years.<eos> There's one absolute truth.<eos> Despite all of us feeling this excruciatingly painful shit shock of the last 48 hours.<eos> There's nowhere I'd rather be then right here, drinking this really, really nice wine at Cousin Monty's... with all of you.<eos> To friends.

I will not have my family estranged for another 15 years, Norman.<eos> So where is he?<eos> He's not here yet.<eos> Strike that!<eos> He's not too subtle, your mate.<eos> That's my wallet!<eos> Welcome to London.<eos> I am so sorry, Nas.<eos> Sorry?<eos> For what?
So, how long is this shit gonna take to stitch up, Jimmy?<eos> Um... two days, sir.<eos> Two hours, you said?<eos> Two hours, sir.<eos> You're making more friends, I see, Bob.<eos> You're a curious one, Charlie.<eos> Born into a family of note.<eos> With all the opportunities that blue blood coursing through your veins offers a young man.<eos> Yet you... you choose to knock about with a gangster's kid.<eos> And an orphan.
I spent an uncomfortable week as a guest...<eos> I don't have time for wartime reminiscences, old man.<eos> I'm Vic Hill.<eos> I'm sure you've heard of me.<eos> Who?<eos> Vic Hill?<eos> Yes... Vic Hill.<eos> No, doesn't ring a bell.<eos> Tell me where the boy is at, or the joke is over.<eos> Capisce?
Your X-Factor moment as a cadet.<eos> Alas, "please" isn't amongst the magic words I'm after.<eos> Bastards.<eos> I don't believe that's the magic word, either.<eos> The problem with these old 78s is they're made of shellac.<eos> They shatter like glass.<eos> I drove him back from the country estate yesterday!<eos> He was more than a little under the influence.<eos> Blathering on about a... A golden bathtub!<eos> Complete gibberish!
Rich yank fella in my camp.<eos> Thought I'd seen it all.<eos> So you'll be wanting your gold, yank?<eos> Or... do you want to buy a caravan?<eos> Do I look like I'm here to buy a caravan?<eos> Fresh out the oven.<eos> Horseshoes?<eos> Lucky horseshoes.<eos> It's one way to try and cancel a curse.<eos> What curse?
What the hell have you gone and done?<eos> I think I should be asking you the very same question.<eos> My old lady suppin' a glass of wine with my old mate.<eos> Very fucking cozy.<eos> Only Vic Hill could think two friends having a meal together needs more explaining than a bloody jailbreak.<eos> Well, the imagination doesn't too many fences to leap before it runs wild, if you know what I mean.<eos> Just take a breath, Vic.<eos> Lily was arrested last night, and we thought it best that she didn't go back home alone.<eos> Arrested?<eos> For what?
A whiff to sniff out my pile.<eos> You're chasing shadows, Vic.<eos> - Hate 'Em?<eos> - Vic?<eos> Fancy a stroll?<eos> Nothing like an afternoon walk to give one clarity.<eos> What do you say, Norman?<eos> That's a quality job we did on that.<eos> See, this is not a question about quality, Uncle Dean.<eos> Yeah, more a question of portability.
Chloe, fill her in. You be nice.<eos> I'm gonna go have a look for him.<eos> There are only a couple places that he could be.<eos> So tell me, Chloe...<eos> What exactly is your racket?<eos> Well, I... I'm not sure what my racket is, Mrs. Hill.<eos> I've just been helping Albert with some connections to help move... The... consignment.<eos> You're too pretty for a fence.<eos> I don't see myself as a fence.<eos> More of a facilitator.
Despite the hollowness of you."<eos> I think a hot bath and a change of clothes for you.<eos> I can't have a bath, my dear friend.<eos> The gold tub is gone.<eos> Long gone.<eos> Gold tub, Master Charles?<eos> It's presently being re-smelted into a giant, gold, gleaming bust of Albert Hill by Uncle Dean and his clan of gypsy artisans.<eos> What on earth are you talking about?<eos> Shh. I speak secrets.<eos> To London, Staff.
Marriage promise was struck when we were still kiddies.<eos> Ask you this, love.<eos> Why do you think he risked it all that morning?<eos> You must have wondered.<eos> All he had to do was leave your ma alone for five minutes, meet me at the altar, he'd still be alive.<eos> That's it, baby.<eos> Drunk, stubborn.<eos> How should I know?<eos> He sent me this.<eos> The night before...
Let me know your travel arrangements and we'll work out all the details.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Yes!<eos> What are you all excited about?<eos> Nas Stone is coming to London tomorrow morning.<eos> Is he really?<eos> And we're happy about this why?<eos> He wants the rest of the gold, Albert.<eos> Like all of the rest of it.
Yeah, course it fuckin' is.<eos> Are you in the nest?<eos> Give me a minute, will you... Butch?<eos> How much longer are these bloody Corsicans gonna keep me waiting on this exchange point?<eos> They're most likely navigating their way into the docks... sir.<eos> The question is, which docks, Dwyer?<eos> And is this to your liking... sir?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you, Dwyer.<eos> Into position then, lads.
Rack 'em up.<eos> Double or quits here.<eos> All right, stop whining.<eos> You rack 'em up, I'm gonna grab a beer.<eos> You're a very bad boy, sir.<eos> Is that all you've got, Dwyer?<eos> Put your back into it, for Christ's sake.<eos> I'll shit you, Johnson.<eos> Prosecco?<eos> What a tosser.
Oxygen deprivation.<eos> You need time to gather your thoughts.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Your nails.<eos> You said it was a diving accident.<eos> I believe you, John... but they don't.<eos> - John.<eos> - Nope. I don't need to be here.<eos> - John? - Nope.<eos> What signs?
Mom.<eos> Mom!<eos> Good morning, John.<eos> Do you remember me from last night?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Look up.<eos> Follow the light.<eos> I had a female doctor.<eos> When?<eos> And right.
Yeah.<eos> Mom's waiting in there for you.<eos> Everyone's in there waiting for you.<eos> - They need your help.<eos> - Why do you say that?<eos> What happened?<eos> Go on inside and you'll find out.<eos> Are you coming with me?<eos> I gotta work.<eos> Work?
Everyone's in there waiting for you.<eos> - They need your help.<eos> - Why do you say that?<eos> What happened?<eos> Go on inside and you'll find out.<eos> Are you coming with me?<eos> I gotta work.<eos> Work?<eos> Yeah. - What work are you capable of?<eos> - "Work" work.
Come here.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Your secret's safe with me, okay? I won't tell anybody what you told me.<eos> I didn't tell you anything.<eos> I put all the files you wanted on your desk.<eos> Maybe... Friday?<eos> Yeah. Pick me up at six.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> You.<eos> What?
She texted me.<eos> Me too.<eos> She said she's not coming home.<eos> As long as you're here.<eos> Where is she staying?<eos> I didn't ask.<eos> She's at a motel.<eos> I think you're right.<eos> I think that maybe we should meet.<eos> For what?
Yeah, I remember.<eos> You gave me my first cigarette.<eos> Yeah. I'll meet you there.<eos> We can watch the sunrise together.<eos> The sunrise.<eos> That sounds great.<eos> When's it gonna end?<eos> When's it gonna end, John?<eos> When's it gonna end?<eos> What?
Like family should be.<eos> Unconditionally.<eos> Why didn't they stay together?<eos> They never were together like that.<eos> How did they meet?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I never asked.<eos> Do you have any good memories of my dad?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> - Like what?
- Eric's wake?<eos> I've been here dealing with Sally.<eos> What about Mom?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Is there something wrong with you?<eos> She's in the hospital.<eos> Take a deep breath.<eos> You're going to have to handle some difficult issues.<eos> We have your mother's DNR here.<eos> What?
That's the problem.<eos> Mrs. Rayburn had a new health proxy notarized a few days ago.<eos> There's some question about his age.<eos> I'll take care of that.<eos> Mom.<eos> It's me, John.<eos> I don't know what happened, but everything's gonna be all right.<eos> We're gonna get through this.<eos> No.<eos> What?
Tell me that.<eos> What do you think I needed to hear?<eos> What did I want you to tell me?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, but for me.<eos> For me, not for you.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> - I need some help in here!<eos> Lunch is ready.<eos> What?
We all were.<eos> Good thing Mike saw what was happening.<eos> John, you really don't remember him saving you?<eos> - Mom, the doctor said that...<eos> - You're right.<eos> They said rest and your memory will come back slowly.<eos> So we just won't force it.<eos> Nolan stopped by while you were napping.<eos> How long was I asleep?<eos> Maybe an hour.
And she's on the run with your girl.<eos> We believe they're in the States.<eos> Where's she hiding?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm just a pilot. Last chance.<eos> Where's Camila's safe house?<eos> I flew Camila out here once on business.<eos> I might know a place.<eos> How many have we lost?<eos> All of 'em.
Yeah. King George.<eos> I've heard his name.<eos> So you know he works on the Texas coast, making smuggling runs to and from South America.<eos> Guero kept track of all the kilos he was flying for him.<eos> Look at this.<eos> You need a new route to bring in product.<eos> Maybe he can help you.<eos> One name?<eos> That's all you're offering.<eos> And my loyalty.
- Yes, King George?<eos> The guy George wants is called Rolando Rios.<eos> He's a threetime violent felon.<eos> Those tats on his neck are from the gnarliest gang in Houston.<eos> Southwest Raza.<eos> Yeah, a guy this hard won't go down easy.<eos> No one does.<eos> How would you know?<eos> I've been kidnapped.<eos> How about you?
I mean, are you?<eos> How do you feel?<eos> How do I feel?<eos> I feel light.<eos> Like a million pound weight's off my chest.<eos> Come.<eos> So what'd you get?<eos> Anything that skins foxes?<eos> - Well...<eos> So back in the day,
- Believe me.<eos> My hands won't cast.<eos> He's the only one that can help me, if I finish fetching his goddamn grocery list so we can get started, so.<eos> - Ah. I can put a rush on this book.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - If you're sure that's what you really want.<eos> - Well, I really want magic, so, yeah.<eos> - But to pay for it with servitude to a lying drunkard...<eos> - what's the alternative?<eos> - Us.
My hands won't cast.<eos> He's the only one that can help me, if I finish fetching his goddamn grocery list so we can get started, so.<eos> - Ah.

They don't want me.<eos> They want the high king.<eos> I'm faking it, El.<eos> So if you could just please, please, wake up.<eos> - I set it to August 20, 1976.<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> - What, what do you see?<eos> - Uh, just people waiting.<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> - What?
I'm faking it, El.<eos> So if you could just please, please, wake up.<eos> - I set it to August 20, 1976.<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> - What, what do you see?<eos> - Uh, just people waiting.<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> - What?<eos> - A nurse with a baby.<eos> Uh. What?
- I set it to August 20, 1976.<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> - What, what do you see?<eos> - Uh, just people waiting.<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> - What?<eos> - A nurse with a baby.<eos> Uh. What?<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> - What?
God.<eos> - I understand.<eos> Do you want to know the truth?<eos> You are a failure.<eos> So stop using me to try to fix that.<eos> Uh-oh, look at the time.<eos> - Uh... wait... no.<eos> - Word as bond, kid.<eos> - What are we drinking to?<eos> - Dead ends.
- I understand.<eos> Do you want to know the truth?<eos> You are a failure.<eos> So stop using me to try to fix that.<eos> Uh-oh, look at the time.<eos> - Uh... wait... no.<eos> - Word as bond, kid.<eos> - What are we drinking to?<eos> - Dead ends.<eos> - What?
Wait, uh, no, no, just, uh, just wait here for a second.<eos> You portaled us to Ireland?<eos> To do what?<eos> - Where are we going? - Home.<eos> It's done.<eos> We already did it.<eos> - Did what?<eos> Alice, what did you do?<eos> Uh, oh, uh, sir, where did we just come from?<eos> - About three streets that way. - Great.
- Because like it or not, we're the closest thing you have to friends.<eos> Yeah, glass jaw.<eos> Not a surprise.<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> Incept him.<eos> - I'll give it to you, you're practical.<eos> - Get out of here!<eos> - Right now!<eos> - Alice is in there!<eos> - What?
I wanted to wait until our security issue was dealt with.<eos> You found the leak, then?<eos> I questioned the jews.<eos> They were uncommunicative.<eos> But I'm confident the problem has been dealt with.<eos> I had them executed yesterday afternoon.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We won't be short-staffed for long.<eos> Plenty of good german workers arrive soon.<eos> And just in time.
And still, "whatever it takes"?<eos> He sacrificed them to save us.<eos> It wasn't about us; It was about the mission!<eos> This time, david and peter had to die.<eos> What's to say next time it won't be one of us?<eos> This is the job.<eos> This is what we signed up for... no, not like that!<eos> Not to go out without even a fighting chance!<eos> How did faber even reach. Sinclair to set it up without us knowing?<eos> By radio.
Not to go out without even a fighting chance!<eos> How did faber even reach. Sinclair to set it up without us knowing?<eos> By radio.<eos> They have their own code.<eos> Sinclair asked me before he left.<eos> To pass messages.<eos> Jesus!<eos> And you didn't tell us?<eos> I had no idea what they were planning.<eos> Because of a code?
You're sure that's what they're talking about in there?<eos> Then what's with Devore wearing a padded bra today?<eos> What the hell is up with you?<eos> The thing you should know right off the top, Cheryl was a huge gossip.<eos> - Ah... - There it is.<eos> Just the worst, God rest her soul.<eos> An absolute nightmare.<eos> If she wasn't such a tremendous salesperson, we would have let her go long ago.<eos> But those big ears and loose lips of hers caused all kinds of trouble.<eos> Such as?
Holly! What are you doing?<eos> Get away from my daughter!<eos> Whoa, relax.<eos> I was just giving her change for the machine.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> Never disappear like that. Never talk to strangers.<eos> What's so goddamn funny?<eos> I don't know, kid.<eos> She doesn't really look like a killer to me.<eos> What?
What were you thinking?<eos> Never disappear like that. Never talk to strangers.<eos> What's so goddamn funny?<eos> I don't know, kid.<eos> She doesn't really look like a killer to me.<eos> What?<eos> She keeps going around telling stories like that, and someone might just believe her.<eos> What did you say to him?<eos> Holly, what did you say?<eos> The truth.
Crazy rumors aren't going to help anybody with anything.<eos> Is it crazy?<eos> We've heard things.<eos> That's right. Yeah.<eos> That's right. People getting sick, violent.<eos> Some folks just upped and disappearin' and nobody doin' anything.<eos> The cops, not doin' anything about it.<eos> That's right!<eos> Tell us the truth.<eos> The truth?
So, I want everyone to take a deep breath.<eos> And I want you to go on home and say a prayer... for our sister who has gone on home much too early.<eos> All right.<eos> Motherfuckers.<eos> It's a shitty time for the department to be a man down.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> What's this?<eos> My "honey-do" list?<eos> Suspects.<eos> What?
You just said you were short staffed.<eos> Let me help.<eos> Well, now, there must be a dozen names here, Rosie.<eos> If it happens within families, we should consider the people next closest.<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> Joe's worked the Austin farm for 20 years.<eos> Then, Lindsey Bartlett chaired the Easter Fair with Kat Ogden, and they were thick as thieves.<eos> But...<eos> Byron, we agreed this has to be stopped.<eos> Like this?
That and some killer barbecue.<eos> Hope you'll join us for lunch?<eos> What will it cost me?<eos> I have to sit through the snake handling after?<eos> Dinner and a show.<eos> We're not selling time-shares.<eos> You need to work on your sales pitch a little.<eos> No pitch.<eos> You came here.<eos> Twice.
You always did ask a lot of questions.<eos> My curious boy.<eos> I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry that I brought that thing to you... and that I tore it out... after it was too late.<eos> No.<eos> That was a choice I made.<eos> I coulda let that thing take me.<eos> Just a few days of pain and surrender... because I wanted to stay me.<eos> For you.<eos> It's too bad you don't have more of that fight in you.<eos> What?
He's fine.<eos> And while he's getting better, I can help you.<eos> I can do what my dad does.<eos> What is wrong with this place?<eos> Shoulda had him stitched up and out of here hours ago.<eos> It may be more serious than that.<eos> It's this hick town.<eos> If we were in Charleston, in a real hospital, we'd be home by now.<eos> I'm glad you and Kyle are a "we" again.<eos> What?
Stop it.<eos> Well, can you feel your hands around her neck?<eos> Stop.<eos> Was it you?<eos> I was sick!<eos> Well, then, go back to the fucking nuthouse where you belong!<eos> Something gets inside of people and poisons their minds.<eos> Makes them do terrible things.<eos> If you stand here and tell me the devil killed my husband... He killed mine!<eos> What?
Eliot's cursed. No, no.<eos> Not just Eliot. Alice and Quentin too.<eos> Listen, whatever you do, do not sit on your throne, okay? Fine.<eos> Whatevs.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> You gonna help me pick these? What's this?<eos> An antidote?<eos> Exactly.<eos> For the poison.<eos> For the... what?
Not just Eliot. Alice and Quentin too.<eos> Listen, whatever you do, do not sit on your throne, okay? Fine.<eos> Whatevs.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> You gonna help me pick these? What's this?<eos> An antidote?<eos> Exactly.<eos> For the poison.<eos> For the... what?<eos> For the poison.
Good news... I think there's a way out.<eos> Does it involve your beheading?<eos> 'Cause that's the ending I'm voting for right now.<eos> I second that.<eos> My ass still hurts.<eos> Enough!<eos> Listen.<eos> I can't stop the curse, so the plan is we're gonna let it run its course.<eos> By killing you.<eos> All of you.
What's the rush?<eos> Ha! I won, bitches.<eos> I'm High motherfucking Queen.<eos> Get the other needles.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Hey! Stay back.<eos> Margo, we don't have time for this.<eos> We got to revive 'em now.<eos> What's best in life, Penny?<eos> What?
I can't do it without The Beast.<eos> It's not my problem.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Duck!<eos> - Shit...<eos> - What the hell?<eos> The chain was the only thing keeping my hand from fucking...<eos> - Put it back on.<eos> - I can't! It's a ritual, and I don't have any...<eos> Oh, no.
I'm leaving.<eos> I'm going. I just had one or two things to do.<eos> Mainly number two.<eos> I have befouled the Wellspring.<eos> Pardon me?<eos> I have left my divine elimination in the font of all magic.<eos> And it's a stinker.<eos> I really hope you weren't planning to drink from it.<eos> - It's hardly potable.<eos> - You... what?
Why don't you and Alice come join me?<eos> You're weaker.<eos> And you're down six fingers.<eos> More than enough to kill you both.<eos> Hard to cast when you're sliced in two.<eos> Quentin!<eos> You're a tough piece of meat, aren't you?<eos> No matter.<eos> I guess we're gonna die.<eos> To our pretty corpses.
Boyd's been rigging Treasury bids.<eos> I'll get you whatever I can.<eos> Whatever it takes, I'm in.<eos> I've seeded over 125 companies.<eos> I don't do it to make money.<eos> If money comes with that, and it always has, that's fine.<eos> But it's not the driver.<eos> I do it for the same reason that Edison created telephonic communication,<eos> Oppenheimer harnessed nuclear fission, and DJ Kool Herc set up two turntables and a microphone on Sedgewick Avenue in the Bronx... to move at great velocity towards a better future.<eos> And this?
We have a conference room set aside.<eos> I appreciate that, but since she has no prior relationship with me...<eos> Build rapport however you want, okay?<eos> Just, keep in mind, we're not giving her the keys to a school bus here.<eos> This is a $1.2 billion vessel.<eos> And your legacy.<eos> I get all that.<eos> You need to know that she's psychologically bulletproof.<eos> There she is.<eos> Right on time.
Your father's driver dropped this off for you.<eos> - Thanks, man.<eos> - For you, Bryan, anything.<eos> That coffee is terrible.<eos> How do you drink it?<eos> I close my eyes and think of England.<eos> When you close your eyes, I want you to think of me.<eos> Coming after you.<eos> Like my own personal Anton Chigurh?<eos> No.
It's not going to save Chuck's job.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Don't throw away a promising career over a selective and misguided sense of loyalty.<eos> Your boss is going down, so why not finish Chuck off yourself and earn some Justice points with the deathblow?<eos> So, we're finally gonna have the talk?<eos> Well, you've been reaching out to me for five years.<eos> This isn't how I like to do it.<eos> You prefer the house?<eos> It's more intimate.<eos> For a seduction?
You're gonna do great things.<eos> Whatever you heard in that meeting made you squeamish.<eos> You know what Rhoades is, Bryan.<eos> You know he should be out of a job.<eos> And I know you made that call.<eos> You rang, boss?<eos> I need you to reach out to Boyd and set up a meeting.<eos> Just the two of you?<eos> This is what the warrant was setting up.<eos> Second wave.
Let's finish this.<eos> Will you draft the Giving Oath letter?<eos> - What do you want in there?<eos> - The usual stuff...<eos> - good for people, communities.<eos> - Got it.<eos> And when it's done, you give it to Bill to read to the world.<eos> Gates or Clinton?<eos> Either.<eos> Both.
I don't think she passed the test.<eos> Either way, she's the right girl.<eos> Mercy Squad?<eos> Yeah, that's what it's called, but I need it to stay all the way quiet.<eos> Hey, no, no, no, no.<eos> You're family.<eos> To pay the girl.<eos> Okay.<eos> Anything for Dean's little sister.<eos> To Dean.
Thank you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's hit the Gorilla truck.<eos> No, I'm not gonna watch you eat a number five.<eos> Onions and... Unh-unh.<eos> Stay here and have some hand salad.<eos> Please.<eos> Do me this favor.<eos> Do you think they really have the inside track with Albany<eos> - on a gaming license?
Right.<eos> Right.<eos> Legally, we call these mental or emotional damages.<eos> So... are you saying Chuck hurt you mentally, or are you saying he hurt you emotionally?<eos> I'd like to take a break.<eos> You don't want to announce to the whole Street that Chuck hurt your feelings?<eos> He got into your head, threw you off your game?<eos> Turn the camera off.<eos> We're taking a break.<eos> What?
I will have updates for you on Tennessee as I get them.<eos> Is everyone clear?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm told everything just went wrong.<eos> - The FBI had the bomb guys there... - But, Mitch for crying out loud!<eos> ... injuries didn't go beyond scrapes and bruises.<eos> Oh, I don't know about that, Shawna.<eos> Twelve people were taken to the hospital.<eos> Look, is there any status on Green's ETA?<eos> - Secretary Stewart and I...
Terrorist chatter.<eos> Related to Tennessee?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Well, I'm gonna need more than your word on that.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, but the intelligence is classified, Governor.<eos> Then read me in.<eos> 'Cause I'm not doing this without seeing tangible proof with my own eyes.<eos> You can tell Francis.<eos> The other thing is, with Ohio turnout so low, people could accuse you of engaging in voter suppression.<eos> What?
Underwood conceded already.<eos> Do not trot out your secretary of state.<eos> Voting cannot resume.<eos> Now, if you have any doubt, you swallow it right now.<eos> I'm worried about the party. What this could do to the party.<eos> Roger, this is so much bigger than the party.<eos> I feel like I'm risking my entire career here.<eos> You are.<eos> And if you don't do what I'm telling you, it's over for sure.<eos> What?
And if you don't do what I'm telling you, it's over for sure.<eos> What?<eos> How many hours is it gonna take him to spit out the fucking words in public? Hey, screw this.<eos> Screw protocol.<eos> I'm heading down there. - No, you're not.<eos> - It's already tomorrow, Mark.<eos> I mean, this is insane.<eos> - I want to make my speech!<eos> - Ohio is still in play.<eos> What?
So the late switch seems... odd.<eos> Our process always seems odd to outsiders.<eos> That's where the whole sausage-making thing comes from.<eos> But let me reassure you, there was nothing out of the ordinary about it.<eos> The committee chose the location that would bring the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people.<eos> That turned out to be Kingsford. Yeah, no, you said.<eos> What I was looking for is a specific reason that decision was made.<eos> You want specifics.<eos> Details into our process.<eos> Inner workings and so forth.
Absolutely.<eos> He doesn't make any of his own decisions.<eos> He's got a string hanging right out of his back.<eos> And it's the Governor who's pulling it.<eos> I'll see what I can find out.<eos> I didn't sleep last night.<eos> Your numbers have been strong, even in a tough market.<eos> Yeah, they have been.<eos> So what was it kept you up?<eos> Russian hackers.
I taught elementary school for 30 years, always contributing to my pension.<eos> That was my nest egg for retirement.<eos> Then that nest egg got invested.<eos> But the town it was invested in mismanaged its finances.<eos> And now they don't want to pay what they owe, and my retirement is threatened.<eos> A spot like this will kick off our Astroturf campaign to make it look like the area's getting a bailout and not a death sentence.<eos> Commercials like this one, but specific to Sandicot, sell the idea that our investors, teachers from the Midwest, hardworking, responsible people from all over, they are the ones who suffer if Sandicot is allowed to default.<eos> Make it clear that we are the ones willing to negotiate. It's the town that's being difficult.<eos> Of course. Sandicot is being uncooperative. We'll say all that.<eos> Any questions?
Come on, it's tradition.<eos> This place has a special character, doesn't it?<eos> You can almost feel all the history in this room, all the deals that've been made.<eos> It's where Senator Vandeveer brought me when she told me I was being appointed U.S. Attorney.<eos> And it's where I always thought I would take you when you'd earned the promotion to Head of Crim.<eos> Mutton's an interesting euphemism, isn't it?<eos> Well, nobody ever says "sheep."<eos> But who wants to eat something so adorable, right?<eos> So it's a mutton chop.<eos> Definitely less objectionable.
If you go on the hard shoulder to overtake, the emergency lane, that's also one point but only a 90 euro fine.<eos> There's your answer.<eos> That's what you do!<eos> No, no.<eos> No, because... Aha.<eos> You may think that.<eos> But if you fit your car with blue lights, flashing blue lights, basically, you turn you car into a police car, you get...<eos> I've got the point fines here.<eos> 20 euro fine and no points at all!<eos> What?
The RS Q3.<eos> Which is a dismal car.<eos> BMW have the X4, I think that's called.<eos> Don't want one of those, either.<eos> Mercedes have this horrible monster.<eos> They're all just rubbish.<eos> And let me guess.<eos> You have a solution.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Oh, God.
The 1.5-litre diesel is no match for the 3.9-litre V8 MGD.<eos> Come on, Pride of Britain!<eos> Yes! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.<eos> Ah... ah... ah. Oh, God.<eos> The brakes don't work.<eos> With the performance box ticked,<eos> I continued my testing.<eos> In many ways, the MGD puts me in mind of an Audi R8 Spyder.<eos> I mean, OK, in the Audi, the dials would work.<eos> And the switches.
Beautiful, stylish Mercedes Benz coachwork.<eos> - Very unusual, unique...<eos> - Unusual?<eos> Here for sale this afternoon.<eos> Start me if you will on this at... ã425.<eos> At ã425...<eos> Any advance at 400?<eos> ã500. 550 anywhere?<eos> - Somebody's bid?<eos> - 600 here.
- Very unusual, unique...<eos> - Unusual?<eos> Here for sale this afternoon.<eos> Start me if you will on this at... ã425.<eos> At ã425...<eos> Any advance at 400?<eos> ã500. 550 anywhere?<eos> - Somebody's bid?<eos> - 600 here.<eos> 650. 650. 700 now.
2.000 if you wish.<eos> It's 2.000 and five.<eos> Two, five.<eos> 3.000 now.<eos> It's 3.000 here.<eos> Three, five anywhere?<eos> Three, one.<eos> At 3.100.<eos> ã3.200.<eos> At ã3.500.
It was rubbish.<eos> Hold on.<eos> - You were bidding on your own car.<eos> Well, a bit.<eos> I just wanted to get the ball rolling.<eos> But even then it didn't work because you only sold it for four grand.<eos> It cost you 14.000 to make so you cost our production company ã10.000.<eos> No, no, not true.<eos> - I put a reserve on it.<eos> - What reserve?
- Where is she?<eos> - I've got no idea.<eos> Um...<eos> Oh. Oh, no...<eos> It's hard to see through the smog, but yes, that is...<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - What's happened here is...<eos> Nena... yes, she's been carried away by 99...<eos> - ...red balloons.<eos> - Oh, no.
Chase!<eos> Maybe this dog's broken?<eos> Meanwhile, back in London,<eos> James was charging his phone from a contraption he'd fitted to the revolving door.<eos> And even Jeremy had decided to get in on the action.<eos> This school sports day, in my mind, is a power station.<eos> All we have to do is fit the children with harnesses and I could have this charged up in no time at all.<eos> Here we go!<eos> Straightaway we can see that charge is being produced.<eos> Not much, but some.
"Got to rush, lads.<eos> I'm late for a poetry reading."<eos> That's truck number three...<eos> Bernie Sanders, everybody.<eos> Anyway, the thing is, they worked out they could pull more heavy things if they fiddled with the ECU on the diesel engines, because that would generate more power, and, as a by-product, more smoke, cos that's why it's called coal rolling.<eos> And now, various kids have started to do it out on the highway.<eos> What they do is go out on the street and then do it when they overtake a Toyota Prius.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Here we go.<eos> For God's sake!
But it's nice to know that it would still work if you did.<eos> And this does.<eos> Boy, this does.<eos> I've always said you can't be a true petrolhead until you've owned an Alfa Romeo.<eos> And the trouble is, I've always known there's no Alfa Romeo a true petrolhead would actually want to buy.<eos> There is now, though.<eos> There is now.<eos> And so I decided to do something I've never done with any car I've ever filmed in my entire life.<eos> I decided, when the test was over, to go to the nearest Alfa Romeo dealer... and buy one.<eos> What?
There he is.<eos> And even he will enjoy this magnificent machine,<eos> I'm sure of that.<eos> And he's off with a glorious bark and a pop from that sensational V6.<eos> It's wet!<eos> OK.<eos> Alfa Romeo Julie Quad Bike something or another.<eos> I can't say it, can't pronounce it.<eos> I don't really like driving it.<eos> For God's sake!
Stop saying things, Hammond.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> This is just a BMW for people who like fancy coffee.<eos> No, it's a BMW for people with taste and discernment.<eos> No, it's a BMW for idiots.<eos> Hammond, be quiet!<eos> Look at the way it's dealing with Old Lady's House.<eos> Almost no problems at all.<eos> Now he can really turn it up for the sprint to Substation.<eos> Such power!
There's no point arguing anyway.<eos> He's got the Alfa Romeo thing out of his system, which is good, because it's time now for us to enjoy a gentle stroll along the sunlit sidewalks of Conversation Street.<eos> - That's a good one.<eos> - I like that one.<eos> It is.<eos> Right, now...<eos> OK.<eos> And we start with this.<eos> It's the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio.<eos> - For God's sake!
Hammond, you work...<eos> you work in the media!<eos> The only thing you have to put in the back of a vehicle are invitations to gala lunches.<eos> - Well...<eos> - That's all you ever do.<eos> The problem, actually, in Britain with a pickup truck... I'm sorry to admit this... Is that if you pulled up at a set of traffic lights and you had your cement mixer and your chainsaw in the back, they would be stolen immediately.<eos> Anything left in the open in Britain, it's like nuts at a party, you just help yourself.<eos> So why doesn't that happen here?<eos> Who's got a pickup truck here?<eos> - Holy cow!
"in, what, 30-40 years, to doing this, whatever this brown..." Look at...<eos> How have they done that?<eos> !<eos> And it's the same as Chevrolet.<eos> There was an Impala in there, 1960.<eos> Look at that!<eos> That is exciting not moving!<eos> That's a Chevy Impala from the '60s.<eos> Let's have a look at one from today.<eos> For God's sake!
How do they even have the nerve to call that an Impala?<eos> Because it isn't one.<eos> I was looking at a Corvette, a '70s Corvette.<eos> That's the C3 model, if you're a Corvette nerd.<eos> This was a car that was driven by all of the astronauts.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - And Dirk Diggler.<eos> Yep.<eos> So it's a car for porn stars and astronauts.<eos> - What a strapline!
- OK.<eos> Think of the cars that have come out recently that we've driven that have been developed so that they would go fast around the Nürburgring.<eos> You can't deny it, it's a terrible car.<eos> Nissan GT-R, the Track Edition, that is a terrible car.<eos> Even SEAT... The SEAT Leon Cupra 280, that's got a hatchback record for going around the Nürburgring, and it's rubbish!<eos> The Nürburgring ruins cars.<eos> I'm developing an app for the smart phone called Bomb The Nürburgring where you guide a Dornier 17 over it and blow it up.<eos> What are you doing on this programme?<eos> Talking sense!<eos> Good question.
So in just a few years' time, the BBC will be able to make a wildlife documentary just in this wheel arch.<eos> Anyway, we've got the cars.<eos> I've got a crane.<eos> All we need now is a boat, which is a job we gave to Jeremy.<eos> That's his responsibility.<eos> He'll have overdone it, won't he?<eos> Well, he'll have made a statement of some sort, so...<eos> Freight ship.<eos> Full-on freight ship.<eos> Or a tanker.
If you attach us to the crane, it won't sink, will it?<eos> We're tied on.<eos> James, can you just take the slack?<eos> Sadly, James misunderstood this simple instruction.<eos> The whole thing has collapsed at the back!<eos> Dear God!<eos> Wait! Stop!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Whoa!<eos> What?
- There he is.<eos> - The man himself.<eos> What a legend!<eos> I can't...<eos> I've always wanted to meet him.<eos> I'm thrilled.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That is a legend.<eos> Proper...<eos> - Hello.
- The man himself.<eos> What a legend!<eos> I can't...<eos> I've always wanted to meet him.<eos> I'm thrilled.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That is a legend.<eos> Proper...<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello.
I'm fine.<eos> I don't like it!<eos> Move!<eos> Hammond, tie both of them to this and give me a thumbs up.<eos> If James gets those onto the road, all the way back up to the harbour, build another raft, get them loaded on... bring them back, it's gonna take days.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Don't stand near the back.<eos> The brakes don't work.<eos> Yeah!<eos> - Well, now what?
Relax!<eos> Am I the same species as that?<eos> No.<eos> Jeremy, don't sink it before we get there!<eos> Mother of God!<eos> Have you seen that?<eos> - What?<eos> - Guys, look!<eos> - My God!<eos> - Holy cow!
Wouldn't a chicken-skin seat look like a giant scrotum?<eos> Yes, and that's your fault for not eating meat.<eos> So now let's move on, shall we?<eos> I've got something.<eos> Back in the 1920s, ok, a Scottish company made a car which they said was for women.<eos> Got a picture of it here.<eos> It's called the Galloway.<eos> What about that car makes it for women?<eos> Well, they said it had a smaller-than-usual steering wheel<eos> - and a more reliable engine.
And then we hit the track.<eos> The roots of this car, they were planted during the 1957 German grand prix.<eos> Fangio, at the wheel of his Maserati 250f, overcame a 48-second deficit in 22 laps to win the race.<eos> He smashed the lap record ten times.<eos> You don't lose a pedigree like that.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Feel the tail kick out a little bit.<eos> Or the front go.<eos> There's the back.<eos> On the front.
He's rowing it the wrong way round.<eos> The great thing is, everyone, the great thing is...<eos> That loch ness is a peaceful, inland lake with no hazards at all.<eos> We may finally get a guest to the studio.<eos> Yeah, that would be great.<eos> Get him in unharmed.<eos> - Come on, sir hoy!<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Come on, you can do it!<eos> - Oh, my...
Hammond, is that you with yellow lights coming up here?<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> - That's a bit of bad luck.<eos> You're going to have to reverse up there, aren't you?<eos> I can't back up because it's preposterously narrow and I can't swivel my head round to look behind me.<eos> So now what?<eos> Well, I'm going the right way down the one-way street, so I have right of way.<eos> Urgh!<eos> Sorry, Hammond, you'll have to direct me a bit.<eos> - Right a bit.
No!<eos> At all costs, I am winning this.<eos> This is typical.<eos> Typical of Italian cars.<eos> They wait until you really need them, and then they go wrong.<eos> "Oh, darling, darling, I'm in labour!<eos> Quickly!"<eos> "Yes, I'm on my way in my Maserati."<eos> Right.<eos> Up here.
Got a picture of a bit of it here.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Huge success.<eos> Loads of big spenders came with their Lamborghinis, and their Ferraris and their Porsches.<eos> Hotels were full, restaurants were packed.<eos> Local economy booming.<eos> So how long do you think it was before the local newspaper carried a headline containing the following words:<eos> "police" and "crackdown"?<eos> Ten days.<eos> - Two days.

And I like it!<eos> Look at that.<eos> The steering's not brilliant at low speeds, but when you've got the arse hanging out like that... it's fantastic!<eos> Yes!<eos> Time for another zesty drink.<eos> Oh, damn it!<eos> - In 300 yards...<eos> - I know where I am!<eos> Next right. Then right turn.<eos> Oh, for God's sake!
Look.<eos> - What is it?<eos> It's a waterproof, go-anywhere bracelet that you use to lock... and unlock it, and start the engine, so you don't need to carry keys in your pocket.<eos> That...<eos> - That's actually quite a good idea.<eos> - I know, it's brilliant.<eos> - How do you charge it up?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Maybe it's like one of those watches.<eos> - Oh, hello.
So, Wank, Kissing, Petting, , Wedding.<eos> Yes.<eos> It'll be a journey through life without leaving Central Europe.<eos> Yeah, it will.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Very excited, we set off on what the Germans call the Romantic Road.<eos> So, we are leaving the town of Wank.<eos> What's that?<eos> "Thank you for..."<eos> What?
Who dares go the fastest?<eos> Right, if we're going to play that game, I might even join in.<eos> Bang on.<eos> Go on, James.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> - There you go, 187, top speed.<eos> - Really?<eos> The thing is, you were behind me when you started and you still are behind me.<eos> - I did 190.<eos> - Oh, for God's sake!
In order to put a stop to this nonsense,<eos> I made us pull in at the next service station.<eos> Right, small cameras.<eos> We fix these to the dash where they can see the speedo, and then there's no cheating.<eos> Why have you got a dog?<eos> I shall show you.<eos> Follow me.<eos> If you want a pet, you can have something expensive, like an iguana with a silver necklace.<eos> Or you can have something cheap, like an ant.<eos> - What ant?

I just had a wee.<eos> Right, let's predict what he's saying in there.<eos> He'll say the traction control won't be turned off properly.<eos> Cos you can't turn the traction control off completely.<eos> He'll say, "I need power and there isn't any!"<eos> Come on!<eos> Where's the power?<eos> Give me power!<eos> Give me power!<eos> Now, this one...
Whereas the Range Rover was designed as an off-road car, and then given some ability to work on the road.<eos> It's only a subtle difference, but it means I don't have to follow the beaten track.<eos> I can take shortcuts.<eos> It's such a clever car, it really is.<eos> This car senses what sort of terrain it's driving over, and then engages or disengages the differentials accordingly.<eos> You could not come up here in the Bentley or the Jaguar.<eos> - It's quiet.<eos> I can't hear it.<eos> - What's he in at the moment?<eos> A pair of pants?
Ahh!<eos> - No!<eos> - Hey, mom.<eos> Mom?<eos> Mom?<eos> Mom, oh my god, mom!<eos> - Thanks for coming.<eos> They're frying me in the morning, so my time is short.<eos> - What is it you need from me at this late hour?<eos> Salvation?
This is father benna.<eos> - This is him.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Why are you church folks always trying to solicit people?<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> This has to do with your- whatever it is, I'm not interested.<eos> - Who was that?<eos> - Some religious nut trying to solicit money or something.<eos> - And you don't believe in charity?<eos> - Yeah, mine.
- Your dad hasn't been hassling you again, has he?<eos> - No.<eos> He's somewhere.<eos> Maybe outside.<eos> - Well, okay.<eos> Sounds like you're eating lunch?<eos> - A snack, that's all.<eos> Talk to ya later.<eos> - Where do you think you're going?<eos> - For a walk.
- It's only my daughter and I who live here.<eos> My wife is gone.<eos> - Anything at all out of the ordinary?<eos> - What business is it of yours?<eos> - So, there have been issues?<eos> - My daughter acts a little weird sometimes, but it's just kid stuff, though.<eos> - Interesting.<eos> Recently?<eos> - In the last few days.<eos> Why?
Why?<eos> - Does the name Charles humes ring a bell?<eos> - Yeah, he did some work on the floors.<eos> Bad luck about his murdering his wife and daughters.<eos> Seemed perfectly normal to me.<eos> - Most people are until they become possessed.<eos> - Possessed?<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> - Charles worked on the original amityville house.<eos> - So what?
- Charles did work on your floors.<eos> He took lumber from the amityville house and used it on your renovations.<eos> - So?<eos> Good lumber is hard to find.<eos> - Have you ever heard of evil transference?<eos> Let's go inside.<eos> We'll discuss it in more detail.<eos> Did you have a party recently?<eos> - Yeah, me, myself and I.<eos> - Thanks for the coffee.
Can I come by later?<eos> - No.<eos> - Don't, don't you want to see me?<eos> - It's not that.<eos> My father has a friend here visiting.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Why don't I sneak out and meet you?<eos> - Okay, yeah, yeah.<eos> What's the time and place?<eos> - In an hour.
- I'll take that.<eos> What are we gonna use to fight against this evil?<eos> - Our wits, our strength, our faith and our courage.<eos> - Running low on all those ingredients.<eos> - When the time comes, you'll find all of them.<eos> You have to, for your daughter's sake, and yours.<eos> Let's get something to eat and then we'll bless the inside of the house.<eos> - Come on.<eos> What's taking so long?<eos> What? - Ah! - Jesus!

We could... Fish parts out of this guy's guts...<eos> Don't do it, rookie.<eos> Try to piece this system back together again.<eos> Just get the power back on.<eos> And a mop, maybe.<eos> - What is your stupid Basic doing with Niko?<eos> Uh, looking for Clara, your missing friend, unlike you, you shitty bitch.<eos> You're going to ruin everything.<eos> I can't keep protecting you.<eos> What?
I don't accept those terms.<eos> Uh, science doesn't really work like that.<eos> Make it.<eos> Figure out an override and get us home.<eos> What about the mission?<eos> We were sent to restart the commstack.<eos> Missions adapt.<eos> Here's a new one: survive.<eos> Input prints and genetic scan. Processed through all available RAC databases.<eos> And... boomshakalaka.
You weren't supposed to come back.<eos> Sorry to screw up your evil plan.<eos> I'm rude like that.<eos> Tell her.<eos> Tell her.<eos> When you first came here, as Clara, I told you everything and you freaked out.<eos> You started causing trouble. And so Niko told me that I had to make you disappear.<eos> So you did, just not the way that she meant.<eos> Why don't I remember?<eos> Jammer.
I was gonna send for you once I found a place for us, but we can go now.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.<eos> Just take back what you did to me.<eos> I don't know how.<eos> Oh, don't fake cry for me.<eos> What's happening?<eos> She's not crying.<eos> Clara?<eos> Clara? Clara, wake up.<eos> Shit.
Zeph! Stand down!<eos> What the hells are you doing?<eos> I'm doing my job and completing the real mission by restarting the commstack, sir!<eos> You're talking crazy. You're gonna get us both killed!<eos> That's not what the science says!<eos> Science says we're all infected with something!<eos> It's messing with your head!<eos> Maybe.<eos> - Decontamination in...<eos> Too late now, Zephyr.
Repo's on its way, Niko.<eos> You better move.<eos> We're family.<eos> We're supposed to protect each other.<eos> From you.<eos> Thanks for seeing me.<eos> How did you know it was a sim?<eos> Whoever designed it's obviously a gadget-head.<eos> They were so busy whacking off to the tech details, they overlooked the bio cues.<eos> Such as?
Well, we've been busy, hunting Hullen, trying to figure out who abandoned these Black Root ships.<eos> Oh, yeah, and Banyon, new head bitch in charge.<eos> We're gonna have to get you past her.<eos> Well, I've been a busy boy too.<eos> Brought the rest of the plasma map.<eos> Johnny, it's everywhere.<eos> How the hells are we gonna fight them?<eos> One step at a time.<eos> Like always.<eos> To Aneela.
She said, "You first." Bitch.<eos> Headbutt?<eos> Be a man, guy.<eos> Move!<eos> This better be worth the chaffing!<eos> Can't keep the door open. Relocks in five.<eos> Hurry, Pree! You're not gonna make it.<eos> Bury me in one piece!<eos> Well, that was a bit anticlimactic.<eos> One?
Okay, Sweet Janet... she deals out of the Parallax tunnels, all right?<eos> You don't just go down there without serious backup.<eos> We got backup.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - So handsy!<eos> What do you mean, Clara was here?<eos> - When?<eos> - Last I heard from her, she was heading here to find you.<eos> Me?<eos> Why?
Look, if you know where Clara is or if you need help...<eos> You'd be the last person I'd ask.<eos> If you find her, tell her I'm sorry.<eos> Whoa, nelly! That bitch knows something.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa! You and your several personality disorders just take a seat.<eos> I got this.<eos> Sorry. Excuse me.<eos> You dropped your mod, Owl.<eos> - We got a basic in the house!<eos> - Basic?
Actually, that's a pretty fair question.<eos> Oh, she's got us there.<eos> - That one keeps me up at night.<eos> How are you so calm?<eos> I get arrested a lot.<eos> Just don't tell them anything, and keep your mouth shut.<eos> I'm not very good at that.<eos> Yeah, I kinda counted on it.<eos> You remind me of him, a bit, you know?<eos> My other partner.
So who did Havigan say this guy is?<eos> Just a hackmod who knows where we can find Clara.<eos> And tell me again why I'm the bait.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Don't go too far. I'm gonna lose eyes on you.<eos> Okay, I think I see him.<eos> Right around the corner to your right, there's a Jumper with a red hat.<eos> What the hells?<eos> He's taking off.<eos> Why's he running?<eos> What?
Why is someone trying to kill you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Ask no-face.<eos> He's not a No-Face.<eos> He's a Two-Face.<eos> Plasma?<eos> What the hells is he?<eos> Ollie?<eos> Ollie!<eos> Shit.
Happened exactly when the plasma died.<eos> Elegantly done.<eos> Lucky for us, I'm paranoid as balls.<eos> We can't open 'em yet, but scans say nobody's home.<eos> Cloaked Hullen ships?<eos> - How many are there?<eos> - Just hiding.<eos> - Not hiding.<eos> Waiting.<eos> What for?
All helps keep my mind off...<eos> The fact that we're gonna burn our dead?<eos> Honor our dead.<eos> Are you drunk?<eos> I'm trying.<eos> It's not working.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'm super good.<eos> They died because of the Hullen, Dutch.<eos> Not you.
Melek Seyah Rinn, Head of Land Rinn.<eos> - Look, we may need 'em.<eos> - Since when?<eos> Since you don't turn a gaggle of bounty hunters into an army by saying please.<eos> We need training, weapons, artillery...<eos> Zia Seyah Tracius, Head of Land Tracius.<eos> So unless we get the Company as a patron, this war will be over before it starts.<eos> Well, then Johnny to the rescue.<eos> Got an ace in that hole.<eos> Her.
Louella Seyah Simms, Head of Land Simms.<eos> Ace in the hole.<eos> Care to be more specific?<eos> That's Pawter's sister.<eos> We're practically... we're family.<eos> She can help us get the Nine families on board to fund the fight.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Looks like you're gonna be doing final salute.<eos> What?
You need to get this elevator moving, Johnny.<eos> Well, it's gonna be tough.<eos> Because of the sun's radiation, they kept the tech basic.<eos> Analog would be cute if it wasn't so useless.<eos> You don't know analog?<eos> You know how to fire a musket?<eos> Just do what you can, but do it fast.<eos> We've got a killer in here.<eos> Melek's dead?<eos> What?
Okay, new plan.<eos> Uh, I'm gonna work on the elevator, and you're work on figuring out which one of the Nine<eos> - would want Melek dead.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let me show you how to use this.<eos> I think I know how a stylus works.<eos> It's also a taser.<eos> You better show me.<eos> - What's all this?<eos> - Self-protection.
Now talk.<eos> What were you and Melek arguing about?<eos> She came to me for Tolerance.<eos> If you could skip the cryptic shit, Alvis, I'd really appreciate it.<eos> It's like asking a judge for leniency before punishment.<eos> But I don't believe you can buy your way out of penance.<eos> She wanted to buy her own Tolerance?<eos> Yeah, it wasn't just for her.<eos> It was for the Nine.<eos> For what?
John, are you making any progress with your investigation?<eos> Copper wire.<eos> Who uses this anymore?<eos> I need lasers. Maybe nanotubes.<eos> Maybe...<eos> I've detected a low-level signal distortion that's causing the elevator's tether to vibrate, triggering the emergency braking system.<eos> So maybe we should find the source of the distortion.<eos> And by "we," I take it you mean "me"?<eos> See that? Pretty soon we'll be finishing each other's...<eos> Work orders.
One of us is hunting the Nine.<eos> First a stomach gash.<eos> Now a walking geyser of blood?<eos> She's not walking anymore.<eos> Well, that's probably for the best.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> The day's young.<eos> Well, it sounds internal.<eos> It's probably biological.<eos> - For example?
The Hullen have existed for thousands of years and across species.<eos> Did you really think the power structure ended with Aneela?<eos> You see, Aneela's abilities with the green are unlike anyone else's.<eos> It's the reason we've been so patient with her.<eos> Then the RACs exploded.<eos> Bit of a last straw, that.<eos> But thanks to Aneela's recent scientific breakthrough, we may not need her anymore.<eos> And that's where you come in.<eos> Take her to treatment.<eos> What treatment?
Maybe it's something they ate.<eos> The Nine don't do anything together, let alone break bread.<eos> The seeds.<eos> From the ceremony.<eos> They both ate the seeds.<eos> But...<eos> We all ate the seeds.<eos> Luce, I'm gonna need you to put a pin in the distortion search and run this moth-bot through the RAC's weapons database.<eos> There are no matches in the RAC weapons database.<eos> What?
There's something about Jaqobis that fights the green, breaks through.<eos> - It's finally what I needed to...<eos> - Aneela?<eos> Commander?<eos> Please, go on.<eos> Tell me more.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Was that in the green?<eos> Echoes.<eos> Old memories.
Make it a bottle.<eos> Dutch.<eos> Finally.<eos> Uh, now's not a good time, Zeph.<eos> Yeah, well, it's about to be because I just figured out what Khlyen was protecting in the Remnant.<eos> You did?<eos> Brains.<eos> Mircoslices of neocortex.<eos> It's where memories are stored.<eos> What?
Fancy calls them "cleansed."<eos> Almost sounds nice.<eos> You know what we need?<eos> A good, old-fashioned, balls-out Warrant adventure.<eos> Kick the dust off the booties, nothing weird, nothing mysterious, just...<eos> Or...<eos> So these just showed up out of nowhere?<eos> They've cloaked on Arkyn for decades.<eos> So why did they bring this one to Leith?<eos> Good question.
Did you get controls back?<eos> Sure, sure, almost.<eos> So we are gonna die.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna die.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Uh, oh, my God.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Why did you stay on the ship?<eos> Because you don't like me or trust me to stay alone?<eos> What?
What's happening?<eos> Where are the Undying?<eos> - Johnny?<eos> - I don't know what it is.<eos> It's some sort of power surge, but I'm coming to get you now.<eos> Khlyen is not coming back, is he?<eos> No, that's what I keep telling you.<eos> No one is.<eos> You've got to tell them<eos> - the truth. - The truth?
Wow, that was way more rewarding that livestock.<eos> I know starting over is scary, but the monks I'm taking you to are good people.<eos> Are you crying?<eos> - Are you...<eos> Zeph? - No, no, no, it's fine.<eos> It's just like you said.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Well, that's just a cargo hold, I mean...<eos> But I know what you mean.<eos> What?
You accept drinks from out-of-townies?<eos> I always accept drinks from the little people.<eos> Thanks.<eos> No sides, no bribes.<eos> The Warrant is all.<eos> Name's Flik.<eos> You've been locked and served.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Whoa, like hells I am!<eos> For what?
I may have kinda run with them for a bit.<eos> But people get so shady when you say you're ex-Ferran.<eos> Won't the old gang be a bit pissed that you've given up their secret base?<eos> Family forgives... right?<eos> I hope Pree didn't grow his hair out for nothing.<eos> It's all about making an entrance.<eos> Blond?<eos> Did not see that coming.<eos> The man is a cave of wonders.<eos> Flare shot.
Aneela?<eos> What did Daddy do to you?<eos> You're the same.<eos> You're exactly the same.<eos> Tell her I'll see her soon.<eos> Turin's confirmed it.<eos> The warrant's off.<eos> Praise the trees.<eos> What's the ETA on Sleeping Beauty?<eos> Any minute.
Some were made to take orders.<eos> Some were born to give them.<eos> - We're coming for you.<eos> - We can't win this war on skirmishes.<eos> We need bigger targets.<eos> We need an army.<eos> Welcome to the revolution.<eos> It's some kind of genetic bomb.<eos> You could wipe out an entire bloodline with this.<eos> Oops.
- Let them finish.<eos> - Why?<eos> We have guns. They have no pants.<eos> Professional etiquette.<eos> Cardiff's a ranking officer.<eos> From a different sector.<eos> Barely counts.<eos> My ears need a shower.<eos> Oh, my God, incoming!<eos> Hard left, hard left!
We're not leaving until we find her.<eos> Who is the mole?<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> How the green connects us?<eos> No fear.<eos> They're all coming back to us, you know.<eos> - The cleansed.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You traded virtual immortality for what?<eos> A pension?
Johnny, you with me?<eos> Johnny, what's 6 times 12?<eos> Ask me questions you actually know the answer to.<eos> Who's the first person you slept with?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> D'Av, I can't remember.<eos> Surely, whatever you're hiding can't be worth a lobotomy.<eos> Depends on who's getting it.<eos> D'Av, let's all just keep it in our pants till Dutch gets her ass here, okay?<eos> Such faith.
I mean, is this what you're fighting for, boys?<eos> So these shining examples of the human spirit can survive?<eos> That's the deal.<eos> Humans get to choose.<eos> McAvoy chose wrong.<eos> And that's why you'll never defeat us.<eos> Our soldiers lack morality... biologically incapable of betraying one another.<eos> That sounds a lot like slavery to me.<eos> Yeah, well... what empire is built without slaves?<eos> The good kind.
It's an upgrade.<eos> Makes your speech and mannerisms more human.<eos> We're not leaving you behind.<eos> These people need direction. Leadership.<eos> Without stasis, the disease ran its course.<eos> You're saying Sarah is alive - as a computer program.<eos> - Welcome back.<eos> Mercenaries. Bounty hunters. Assassins.<eos> Take back what's mine and take out the crew of the "Raza."<eos> Three.
- Anything?<eos> I don't see any... Signs of neural issues.<eos> Blood pressure is normal.<eos> Cholesterol is...<eos> Slightly ele...<eos> Vated.<eos> See, I've been here before.<eos> You're having a case of déjà vu.<eos> Mm, except that in this case, it's déjà do.<eos> Over and over and over again.
I have a notoriously high center of gravity.<eos> It's true.<eos> He does. No, that's not it.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Wait.<eos> You two are the only ones onboard with a memory of your past.<eos> Okay. I'm gonna need you to tell me something about yourself.<eos> Something that no one else could possibly know.<eos> - Why?
To find Solara and get her to reboot me!<eos> Hey.<eos> Check behind your night stand.<eos> It's not a faulty relay switch.<eos> It's an accel...<eos> It's an acceleration translator... ometer.<eos> - What?<eos> - Shit.<eos> Hey.<eos> Behind the night stand.
- No.<eos> I'm not talking to Sarah or whatever that thing is in the ship's computer.<eos> Her digital consciousness.<eos> And it's very much her.<eos> The revelation that she's still alive has clearly affected... No. No.<eos> She is not alive.<eos> That isn't her.<eos> I'm not talking to some computer program.<eos> As you wish.<eos> What?
I'm sorry.<eos> I can't.<eos> Marcus, wait.<eos> Please.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> The name's Ash.<eos> Emperor Ishida sends his regards.<eos> Breakfast in bed.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Mess.
I almost shot you.<eos> I could have sworn he went that way.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> Maybe I'm just seeing things.<eos> If anyone needs me, which I doubt, I'll be in my quarters.<eos> Look out!<eos> Crews quarters! We need help!<eos> The Blink Drive! Where is it?<eos> What's a Blink Drive?<eos> Crap.
From Tabor's closet and, before that, the lab of Dr. Alfonso Rezov.<eos> He was a friend of a cousin of a client, some sort of scientist, who needed help funding his various tech ventures, so Tabor...<eos> The guy owed Tabor money so he took a bunch of his stuff as collateral.<eos> I was getting there.<eos> What do you know about the device?<eos> We took it from his lab while he was out so... not much.<eos> Oh, careful. Careful.<eos> So one of you brainy types studies this thing and fixes the time loop.<eos> What about the guy who apparently walks through walls?<eos> Walks through walls?
But I can help you get back.<eos> Destroy this device when you return.<eos> That will sever the time loop, solve your problem.<eos> There's no other way.<eos> But, if I can find a way to understand it, perhaps I can undo some of the things...<eos> There's no point in debate.<eos> You'll destroy the device.<eos> Where are the rest of the crew?<eos> Gone.<eos> A long time ago.
Oh, what's there?<eos> Our creator.<eos> What are we looking at?<eos> An extraordinarily complex cipher.<eos> It would take a highly advanced mind to even recognize it, and approximately 87,560 computational hours to decode.<eos> Ten years...<eos> - Give or take.<eos> - And yet... there are counter-logical aspects to the puzzle that would be best served by a more intuitive approach.<eos> So someone with both android logic and emotional reasoning could solve it faster?<eos> In a little less than a month.
- Mm. You realize the irony of you pitching me this?<eos> Yes, I do, I do, but I'm pitching it to you anyway, because even I can see that this is a great opportunity for you.<eos> I could actually exist out of this virtual environment?<eos> You could come visit me in my room, for a change.<eos> No matter what, you will always be the woman I love.<eos> Arrian?<eos> My name is Chase.<eos> I assist Dr. Shaw.<eos> I'm sorry, you remind me of someone I knew.<eos> - Someone?
Yes, I do, I do, but I'm pitching it to you anyway, because even I can see that this is a great opportunity for you.<eos> I could actually exist out of this virtual environment?<eos> You could come visit me in my room, for a change.<eos> No matter what, you will always be the woman I love.<eos> Arrian?<eos> My name is Chase.<eos> I assist Dr. Shaw.<eos> I'm sorry, you remind me of someone I knew.<eos> - Someone?<eos> - An android...
I'm sorry this wasn't the ending you wanted.<eos> We already had our ending.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's time to go.<eos> "Raza," get ready to jump.<eos> We've docked.<eos> Get us out of here.<eos> Forget about the hot chocolate.<eos> Bottoms up.
We've docked.<eos> Get us out of here.<eos> Forget about the hot chocolate.<eos> Bottoms up.<eos> Bit of an acquired taste.<eos> I have these ingrained notions in my head from...<eos> I guess from who I used to be, ways of thinking that generate assumptions about people and... well, androids.<eos> - This sounds like an apology.<eos> - That's because it is.<eos> What for?
She'll no longer be a threat to you or anyone else.<eos> And Hiro?<eos> He'll no longer be a threat either.<eos> Your step-brother was too easily influenced but, at heart, a good man.<eos> His death is unfortunate.<eos> His death was regrettable but, ultimately, necessary.<eos> I still have enemies within the court, but they've lost their direct claim to the throne.<eos> They're disorganized and without purpose.<eos> It's only a matter of time before I uproot them.<eos> And then what?
Unfortunately, Five, I'm afraid that's unlikely.<eos> The successive volleys from the Ferrous Corp destroyer have taken their toll.<eos> I estimate total shield failure in less than 20 minutes.<eos> Hey, I thought I'd lost you there.<eos> I have an idea, but I will need your help to set up a neural link with the Ferrous Corp shuttle that's currently docked with the ship.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're dead.<eos> I am.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
Come on, come on.<eos> The destroyer is hailing the shuttle.<eos> Ignore them.<eos> They're threatening to open fire.<eos> - Is it close enough yet?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Red Team One, I repeat, this is your final warning.<eos> Requesting ident code.<eos> They're opening fire.<eos> How much closer?
- Lieutenant John Anders,<eos> Galactic Authority, Serious Crimes Division.<eos> I came down in an escape pod after the destruction of EOS-7.<eos> We heard weapons fire.<eos> Yeah, yeah, facility's security drone was still active.<eos> I had to take it out.<eos> Are you alone?<eos> Yeah, yeah, it's just me.<eos> I'm sorry we didn't have more time to get to know each other.<eos> Me too.
We don't need the Blink Drive to make a difference here.<eos> It's not our fight, man.<eos> If Ferrous Corp takes out the other corps, you can be damn sure they'll eventually make it our fight.<eos> I made a casserole using some of the fresh vegetables we picked up on Corvus-8.<eos> We'll have allies out there...<eos> Rebels, the outer colonies, anyone who's ever been wronged by the corporations.<eos> Mm, this is really good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The secret ingredient is basil.<eos> Mm. And love.

And love.<eos> But mostly basil.<eos> Hey, sorry I'm late.<eos> - Nice apron.
Wait a minute.<eos> What if when they went through, they created a kind of rip or tear between here and wherever they went?<eos> That's what the anomaly is, just one end of the tear.<eos> An interesting theory.<eos> If it's true, then as long as the tear persists, we may be able to use it to trace where they went.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I'm on my way back up.<eos> Five, come in.<eos> Shit.<eos> Not again.
I know.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> It's gonna get worse, isn't it?<eos> The fugue states you've been experiencing will most likely increase in duration and frequency until they become permanent.<eos> Is there anything we can do?<eos> That's it.<eos> Okay. System's online.<eos> Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> - Only one problem.<eos> - What?
- Only one problem.<eos> - What?<eos> I've got no coordinates to feed into the nav system.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> Just put in anything.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wait, hold on.<eos> What is that?<eos> Some sort of radioactive pulse.
- Did you explain this to her?<eos> - I did.<eos> Before she lost consciousness.<eos> She said if it was the only way, we had to take the chance.<eos> Going somewhere?<eos> My friends are getting on a shuttle.<eos> I'm going with them.<eos> Where to?<eos> Off this rock.<eos> Das...
What are you talking about?<eos> I wasn't trying to rat your friends out.<eos> I was trying to get information on your family.<eos> I know what happened.<eos> My parents were killed in an accident.<eos> No, they didn't tell you everything.<eos> They didn't tell you that you have a sister.<eos> - What?<eos> - She was adopted when you were still a baby.<eos> A wealthy family. Influential.
Seems fine.<eos> I found something.<eos> This is a magnified image of the nearest star, approximately half a lightyear away.<eos> Mass and spectrographic analysis show it to be an exact match for Pollux.<eos> - We were just in the Pollux system.<eos> - That's correct.<eos> So we just traveled half a lightyear?<eos> That still doesn't explain why the stars are out of position.<eos> Maybe it does.<eos> Standby.
We better get these out of sight.<eos> Thanks, kid.<eos> It's like moving into a museum.<eos> Did people actually live like this?<eos> - What the hell is that?<eos> - Someone's at the door.<eos> I think it's the neighbors.<eos> Does everyone remember their assigned names?<eos> Yeah. Yes.<eos> What?
Can we just get started, please? Come on.<eos> Baseline readings.<eos> We got to cover more ground.<eos> How about starting with the inside of that chocolate shop?<eos> - Come on. - Hi.<eos> - What's she doing?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I'm telling you guys. She's a spy.<eos> They're all spies.<eos> For who, the Russians?
Look! We should report this to Sheriff Vargas.<eos> The Sheriff's not gonna believe us.<eos> Then we need proof.<eos> You are just so cute.<eos> Your hot chocolate's getting cold.<eos> No, we are not getting a dog.<eos> It would be great for crew morale.<eos> We could screw up the timeline.<eos> What if the dog that we bring back is instrumental in finding a cure for Sokolsky Syndrome or something?<eos> What?
This is the happiest I've seen you in a long time.<eos> I've missed this side of you.<eos> Yeah, well, it's been a rough month. Yeah.<eos> You know, you may think you call the shots, but we all do.<eos> We all have a say in where we go, what we do.<eos> It's not all on you.<eos> Never has been.<eos> We're the crew of the Raza.<eos> We carry each other.<eos> What?
That's no problem.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Better white than red?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Who was that?<eos> Professor Brophey.<eos> Teaches physics at Harding High.<eos> - Supposedly quite the genius.<eos> - Is he always that jumpy?<eos> A little, yeah.
But we need to make sure.<eos> I'll go back to the "Marauder," link with the ship, and run a facial recognition program through the G.A. database.<eos> In the meantime, you see if you can find out more about him.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> - Who are they spying on?<eos> - It's not who. It's what.<eos> - Okay, what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's obviously something top secret.<eos> Like?
- All right.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> Two. Three. Are you there?<eos> Two. Three. The professor's on the move.<eos> Pirates, monsters, or magic?<eos> Magic.<eos> "Dungeon Siege III" it is.<eos> Hey, do you know anything about that Professor Brophey?<eos> Not much.<eos> Why?
Magic.<eos> "Dungeon Siege III" it is.<eos> Hey, do you know anything about that Professor Brophey?<eos> Not much.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm looking for a physics tutor.<eos> I hear he's pretty smart.<eos> Ethan's brother had him last semester.<eos> - Heard he was weird.<eos> - Weird how?
How did you find me?<eos> We ran a planetary scan and picked up the Blink Drive subspace signal emanating from this location.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> How did you find me in this time?<eos> - It was an accident.<eos> - An accident?<eos> Yes, we ran a diagnostic and something happened.<eos> There was a flash, and the next thing we knew, we had traveled 600 years into the past.<eos> The recall worked.<eos> What recall?
It's okay.<eos> They helped me.<eos> You're leaving, aren't you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Take me with you.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> You've got a life here, a family.<eos> I want to see the future.<eos> You will.<eos> Your own.
But I think I love you.<eos> Jake... you're in love with the idea of being in love with me, and plus, I'm five years older than you.<eos> My uncle Bill, he's dating a girl 25 years younger than him.<eos> Good for your uncle Bill, but... but this is different.<eos> Someday you'll find that special someone.<eos> Who knows, maybe that someone is already closer than you think?<eos> Ew, no.<eos> She's my cousin.<eos> Well, maybe not her. But... but someone.<eos> For sure.
Goodbye.<eos> So we make it back?<eos> We returned to our own time.<eos> The Drive is working flawlessly. Good.<eos> Now let's disconnect it.<eos> - Really? - After all that?<eos> We can't trust Brophey to not try the recall again.<eos> From now on, we only use it as a last resort.<eos> And what about the timeline?<eos> Any changes?
Do you expect us to believe that?<eos> One of your buddies just got killed.<eos> Any one of you could be next.<eos> And having a known murderer hold us at gunpoint is supposed to make us feel better?<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> Not recently.<eos> Come in.<eos> Hey... you find anything?<eos> Nothing useful on the surveillance cameras.<eos> - What about the weapon?
I think sometimes it's just easy to forget how good we have it here.<eos> Much worse places to be.<eos> So we just got word.<eos> 12 independent colonies just applied for joint membership to the League of Autonomous Worlds.<eos> What about Ishida?<eos> Less than an hour after the announcement, he launched a massive attack against Pyr, pretty much ending all hope for a ceasefire.<eos> Well. Like I said.<eos> Much worse places to me.<eos> Here, here.<eos> Fries?
- I think he wants...<eos> - Ah! You're here.<eos> Perfect.<eos> I need to borrow your subspace transmitter.<eos> - Well, I heard on the news that hostilities were spreading to the Cassiar sector.<eos> So? So Tabor has a safe house on Cassiar 4.<eos> Is there anything of value in this house?<eos> There might be one or...<eos> One or two items. So is it Tabor you're worried about or his stuff?<eos> What?
- It'll... - Be a walk in the park?<eos> More of a light jog.<eos> Need you to keep an eye on him.<eos> Make sure he doesn't screw up, or try to work some sort of side angle.<eos> You really think he'd try to double-cross us?<eos> He learned from Tabor, didn't he?<eos> I should be coming with you.<eos> You'd just be waiting in the docking bay.<eos> - There's no point.<eos> - As a precaution.
Are there any Ferrous ships in the vicinity? No.<eos> It's still clear.<eos> But that could change.<eos> All right.<eos> We're going in after them.<eos> - I have another idea.<eos> - I'm listening.<eos> I just need to hack into the station's date node.<eos> And unpack those heels I picked up from Safira-10.<eos> Hi, cutie.
Thank you.<eos> Um? - Ellis.<eos> - Ellis.<eos> Allow me to escort you to your safety deposit unit.<eos> Well, aren't you just the sweetest thing I ever did see.<eos> So I don't see a ring.<eos> Can I assume that you're...<eos> Free and happy.<eos> So not looking to get tied down?<eos> Oh, why?
Wait a minute.<eos> What if when they went through, they created a kind of rip or tear between here and wherever they went?<eos> That's what the anomaly is, just one end of the tear.<eos> An interesting theory.<eos> If it's true, then as long as the tear persists, we may be able to use it to trace where they went.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I'm on my way back up.<eos> Five, come in.<eos> Shit.<eos> Not again.
I have persistently warned everyone of the dangers involved.<eos> II know. It's not your fault.<eos> It's gonna get worse, isn't it?<eos> The fugue states you've been experiencing will most likely increase in duration and frequency until they become permanent.<eos> Is there anything we can do?<eos> That's it.<eos> Okay. System's online.<eos> Let's get the hell outta here.<eos> Only one problem.<eos> What?
Let's get the hell outta here.<eos> Only one problem.<eos> What?<eos> I've got no coordinates to feed into the nav system.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> Just put in anything.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yeah. Wait, hold on.<eos> What is that?<eos> Some sort of radioactive pulse.
And without a clean neural imprint to work from, they'll be inaccessible for the rest of her life.<eos> Did you explain this to her?<eos> I did.<eos> Before she lost consciousness.<eos> She said if it was the only way, we had to take the chance.<eos> Goin' somewhere?<eos> My friends are getting on a shuttle.<eos> I'm going with them.<eos> Where to? Off this rock.<eos> Aw, Das... Das...
Maybe not.<eos> But you at least deserve to know the truth.<eos> What're you talking about? I wasn't tryin' to rat your friends out.<eos> I was trying to get information on your family.<eos> I know what happened.<eos> My parents were killed iin an accident.<eos> No, they didn't tell you everything.<eos> They didn't tell you that you have a sister.<eos> What? She was adopted when you were still a baby.<eos> A wealthy family.
Open up a comm line to the other vessel.<eos> Cepheus-5, this is the "Raza."<eos> You're welcome.<eos> We received word that Ferrous Corp had started launching strikes on rival assets in the outer colonies.<eos> Figured it was just a matter of time before they set their sights on us.<eos> Well, fortunately for you, we were in the area when they did.<eos> And to what do we owe your timely intervention, Raza?<eos> Luck.<eos> We're actually here to pick up a friend.<eos> - A friend?
- Introductions are in order.<eos> This is my bodyguard, Solara Shockley. What?<eos> Bodyguard?<eos> What's a little twerp like you need a bodyguard for?<eos> Little twerps in this line of work need them most of all.<eos> Okay, here's the deal.<eos> These workers are fed up with their terrible working conditions. Uh-huh.<eos> Traugott has all but abandoned this facility and the guards stationed here, because they're too busy with the war, so I've convinced the workers to take advantage of the situation,<eos> - and proclaim their independence.<eos> - Why?
Why don't we give you two some time?<eos> I am not signing on for this.<eos> I'm not saying we commit, but let's not take anything off the table just yet.<eos> We're not going down this road.<eos> But this is exactly what we've been talking about, helping people in situations like this.<eos> No, this is what you've been talking about.<eos> I never said I'd be willing to get involved in a territorial dispute that has nothing to do with us.<eos> I've been talking, but you seem to be listening.<eos> This is an opportunity to... to help, - to do the right thing.<eos> - And then what?
- In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.<eos> Show you can govern fairly, and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the G.A. or The League of Autonomous Worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.<eos> But someone...<eos> Someone has to pay for this.<eos> And they will, but not with their lives.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now it's a matter of convincing the rest of my people.<eos> What?
I wanna help you save your friend.<eos> Plus, I have to show this guy up, so...<eos> Where the hell are all the guards?<eos> I don't like this.<eos> You guys take this hallway.<eos> No resistance.<eos> Nothing on this end.<eos> You guys in position?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Count of three.
- Space me?<eos> - Mm-hmm. I don't know, but I'm one of them now.<eos> I'm not so sure that's a good thing.<eos> From what I hear, they're not exactly...<eos> Not exactly what?<eos> According to Tabor, they're great earners, but kind of volatile. Yeah.<eos> How long has Tabor been their handler?<eos> Awhile.<eos> He repped the original crew.<eos> - Original crew?
No one else is dying today.<eos> Put your weapons down.<eos> It's over.<eos> Yeah, damn right it's over.<eos> Get down on your knees with the rest of 'em.<eos> - No.<eos> - What was that?<eos> He said no.<eos> Drop your weapons.<eos> - And then what?
Well, I'm not the only one responsible for that particular attack.<eos> But I don't deny it, because those civilians weren't so innocent.<eos> They're complicit in a system that supports inequality and favors corporate rights over the rights of the workers.<eos> And yes...<eos> I've shed blood, and I have no regrets, because I fight for the weak, the defenseless, the downtrodden.<eos> I fight for the oppressed.<eos> And I will fight for you.<eos> You don't belong here.<eos> I was invited.<eos> - By who?

I like this.<eos> It's got kind of an "all hail our glorious leader" sort of vibe to it.<eos> Android, any progress establishing a neural link?<eos> Not yet.<eos> As I stated earlier, connection is theoretically possible, but such a function was not part of this ship's original design.<eos> What's with the no-can-do attitude?<eos> That wasn't pessimism, simply a statement of fact, like, "We stole a ship," "We're flying through space," or, "I could detach your head with minimal effort."<eos> - Okay. - Minimal... - Yeah.<eos> - Effort. I got it.<eos> Testy robot.
Put it away.<eos> This way, grunts.<eos> Truffault said you'd have information about the drop.<eos> Here you go.<eos> This planet is in Traugott territory.<eos> That a problem?<eos> Not for us.<eos> No information about the cargo we're hauling for you?<eos> The less you know, the better.<eos> Careful, you clumsy idiots!
I didn't think you had it in you.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> Wait, how did you get this transmission channel?<eos> Truffault called me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Stealing an Ishida cruiser?<eos> Heisting a shipment of cutting-edge missiles?<eos> Ah, we saw an opportunity, so we took it.<eos> And it never occurred to you to give your representation a heads-up?<eos> - Not really, no.
- What's not to like?<eos> They get the missiles. We get the money.<eos> - You vouch for this buyer?<eos> - Oh, completely.<eos> Then I want you there for the exchange.<eos> Well, that's... unusual.<eos> Either you show up, or the deal is off.<eos> Fine. I'll be there.<eos> Happy?<eos> - Ambivalent.
- Ambivalent.<eos> - Great.<eos> I'll send the coordinates once I've made the arrangements.<eos> Ooh, well, that went better than expected.<eos> Yeah, congratulations.<eos> You're a terrific liar.<eos> Hey, I was taking a chance they would even know me.<eos> I already told you, in the alternate universe, the crew of the "Raza" never lost their memories.<eos> I know, but I was kinda thinking the alternate me might be something different.<eos> Like what?
My Portia would be beating the crap out of me right now for information.<eos> That was more of an observation than a suggestion.<eos> Who else came over with you on the "Marauder"?<eos> Do I need to remind you that they used you and abandoned you?<eos> Okay. They used you and abandoned you.<eos> You're alone.<eos> - Everyone. - What's that?<eos> We all hitched a ride when your "Raza" made the jump back to this reality:<eos> me, Portia, Boone, Tash, The Android.<eos> - What about Corso?
There was no performance.<eos> Oh, I recall that opening overture.<eos> You never had a chance to experience the crescendo, baby.<eos> That's because I was disappointed in your pianissimo.<eos> Okay, I think we've exhausted the musical euphemisms.<eos> Can we go back to threatening each other's lives?<eos> - Gladly.<eos> It would appear she's waiting for something.<eos> Yeah?<eos> This.
Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> This is beautiful.<eos> I created it.<eos> How?<eos> Well, when this all started, everything around me was like a... blank canvas.<eos> Hmm. But Five uploaded a program that... allows me to manipulate my environment, build things.<eos> She wanted me to make this my home.<eos> That kid, huh?<eos> First an empty room, and... now this.
What is this place?<eos> It's a Ferrous Corp ship.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> I thought you died on that planet.<eos> Welcome back, Six.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You okay?<eos> Hit me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What?
We're out of cream.<eos> You know, when we first remembered our pasts, I thought we were beyond redemption.<eos> But I'm starting to realize it's the rest of the universe that's screwed up.<eos> Took you long enough.<eos> I envy you and your ability to not...<eos> Care?<eos> I was going to say "let it get to you."<eos> Yeah. How's Sarah?<eos> When I'm with her, she seems really happy, you know?<eos> Maybe a little too happy.
We've been detected.<eos> Transmitting override command.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Command delivered.<eos> Did it work?<eos> Yes.<eos> The satellite network has been disabled.<eos> All right, let's gear up.<eos> Excuse the intrusion.<eos> What?
- Understood.<eos> - You think that's a good idea?<eos> Whoa, whoa. Easy.<eos> All right, carefully place your weapons on the floor, put your hands behind your heads,<eos> - and step back.<eos> - Yeah, that's not gonna happen.<eos> - I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> - Look... we're cooperating like we said we would.<eos> We're not handing over our weapons.<eos> Damn straight.
She's one of them, a simulant.<eos> I have proof.<eos> Dr. Aaron, report.<eos> Dr. Aaron?<eos> Sergeant Morse?<eos> Sergeant, report.<eos> This is Sergeant Morse.<eos> We got two of the prisoners.<eos> Boone?<eos> And Varrick, yes, ma'am.
They're all around us!<eos> Come in?<eos> Do you read me? Anybody?<eos> "Raza," this is the "Marauder."<eos> Any word from Two?<eos> Has the Mikkei shuttle launched? Negative.<eos> We're cut off from the shuttle.<eos> There's no way out.<eos> We need to get to the station's reactor.<eos> - Why?
Another panic attack?<eos> Well, there's nothing to do but sit around being scared.<eos> That's why we gotta distract 'em.<eos> Let's see what we got here.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> Who's up for poker?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Here. Take this one.<eos> What?
No, she didn't say shit to me.<eos> Why the hell did I trust her?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - I need to find another working car. - I'll come.<eos> No! Just...<eos> Just...<eos> I'll be back. Just stay here.<eos> Come on!<eos> Show me.<eos> One sec!
I'm coming!<eos> Help!<eos> Jay, please hurry!<eos> Are you okay? Yeah.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> How did you know I was in there?<eos> Did you do this?<eos> Did you lock me in there so you could play hero?<eos> What?
And you don't have to be any longer.<eos> You can stop running.<eos> There's no one waiting for you.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Someone's waiting.<eos> Stop it!<eos> A minute and a half already.<eos> It's working.<eos> It's working.<eos> What?
There's no one waiting for you.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Someone's waiting.<eos> Stop it!<eos> A minute and a half already.<eos> It's working.<eos> It's working.<eos> What?<eos> Who?<eos> What?
You're wrong.<eos> Someone's waiting.<eos> Stop it!<eos> A minute and a half already.<eos> It's working.<eos> It's working.<eos> What?<eos> Who?<eos> What?<eos> What?
Here's the thing, Eve.<eos> Kind of fed up with you trying to decide what I can and cannot do.<eos> And I just don't believe you're gonna shoot me over where I crash.<eos> If I see you touching her... I will put a bullet in whatever body part you touch her with.<eos> Understood?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nathalie!<eos> What happened?<eos> The boy, Link, he attacked me.<eos> What? Here.
Cargo One, where the hell are you?<eos> Over here!<eos> We both know who did this.<eos> Trikru.<eos> Where the hell are the others? They took the truck to go to Polis.<eos> That means at least one of yours is still alive.<eos> How much longer do we let them protect that son of a bitch?<eos> This ship was supposed to keep us alive.<eos> Now we're all gonna die.<eos> And what?
So, Anne, why don't you start screaming.<eos> We will see if we can hear you.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Help, help!<eos> My husband is pushing me through the glass!<eos> Larry, you're killing me!<eos> All righty, Anne, why don't you scream something else?<eos> Oh, my bad.<eos> And be one with the sidewalk.<eos> And crab walk into toe jab.
Where'd you get those pants?<eos> And did you get my skate wrench?<eos> Hey, Josh. What happened with you and my dad?<eos> He's really upset.<eos> I didn't know he was capable of showing emotion.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Have you ever seen your dad cry?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> About Margaret?<eos> No, "Les Mis."
She knew all too well the risks of engaging in battle.<eos> And I would die a thousand deaths if it meant she would live but one more hour.<eos> But in the end she made a choice.<eos> And what of me, Father?<eos> Was I a soldier, too?<eos> Do you recognize this box?<eos> I spent 200 years in it.<eos> Eating dirt.<eos> Breathing in my own filth.<eos> Because of you.
I'm not surprised.<eos> Great. Well, now, all we need now is a delivery device to concentrate and direct the fire.<eos> Fortunately the specs listed in this text match an artifact that I've been able to track to the Smithsonian storage. We can get it.<eos> W-Wait, you have access to the Smithsonian storage units?<eos> - W...<eos> - Well, if by access you mean do we have a way to sneak in and take stuff without people knowing?<eos> Then, yeah, we got access.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Look, we... always put everything back.<eos> Mostly everything.

Crane?<eos> Crane?<eos> Crane, wake up.<eos> - He's still alive.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> We just killed the thing that had him captive.<eos> U-Unless he's already too far gone inside his own mind.<eos> Too far gone, what does that mean?<eos> It means he's still trapped inside the illusion.<eos> So, what?
Why is he sad?<eos> He thinks that he's alone.<eos> But the funny thing is, he's wrong.<eos> He's got lots of friends.<eos> But he feels like he's let them down.<eos> Even you, Mom.<eos> But he hasn't.<eos> He gives people something they all need.<eos> What's that, baby?<eos> Hope.

I didn't know.<eos> Trust is such a delicate thing, veil, so easily clouded by love, or hate.<eos> I was wondering, um...<eos> All this training. What, what is it that your men are preparing for?<eos> Let's just say we all pay for our sins, eventually.<eos> Except for those of us who are still pure, ain't that right, Henry?<eos> Well, this will take a little while to develop.<eos> I'll bring you the results. I'll wait here this time, if you don't mind.<eos> Your mother saved my life.<eos> Twice.
Or what, Ava?<eos> What, will I be cleansed, too?<eos> They'll catch you.<eos> Not if you come with me.<eos> Master is a liar.<eos> She's just afraid of us.<eos> You should come with me.<eos> I can't.<eos> You mean you won't.<eos> What?
He's a psychopathic narcissist.<eos> Something was created in his image.<eos> His ego... must seek it out.<eos> That hurts.<eos> You should have won the fight.<eos> He had a knife.<eos> He didn't play fair.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> This treatment is more effective on a fresh wound.<eos> What treatment?
What happened to their mom?<eos> Troy's mom.<eos> Jake's was my first wife.<eos> I was married twice before I gave up the sacred institution.<eos> Did she die?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Before.<eos> My father was a drunk, like her.<eos> The booze kill him?<eos> In a way, yeah.
Nick... please.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Newton stabbed his own eye to understand the nature of light. I just...<eos> I need to know. I need to know why we spoil.<eos> I think we can be friends now.<eos> You should be sleeping.<eos> How's your wound?<eos> Better.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?
You need to use these hearings to tell them everything.<eos> Tell them yourself.<eos> Atone for your sins.<eos> Will you speak on my behalf?<eos> - Sadavir... - Sorry. I shouldn't have even said that.<eos> It would be a dumb move for you, obviously.<eos> There's no need to taint yourself with my folly.<eos> You'll get through this.<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> One way or another.

Show me the whole God damn system.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, where are we exactly?<eos> All right.<eos> Now, show me the orbital paths of all the Jovian moons.<eos> That's a lot.<eos> Okay. Time lapse times ten.<eos> Plot a gravity assist trajectory down to Ganymede.<eos> No engine.<eos> Just thrusters.
The connectors between the docks are collapsed.<eos> How we gonna find another ship?<eos> We're getting on...<eos> We're shutting the doors until this crowd calms down!<eos> Big guy!<eos> These doors are going to stay closed until you get them under control.<eos> - People are getting scared.<eos> Which means they'll start getting ugly. Hey.<eos> Yep.<eos> Another hot day at Pimlico.
That's how you never see me comin', sister.<eos> I'm running ops here. - Understood? - Not my first rodeo.<eos> Oh, "cowgirl," consider yourself a diplomatic observer on this rodeo.<eos> You served.<eos> Sigint, back in the day.<eos> Ah. Military intelligence.<eos> Filing reports and hiding behind a desk, huh?<eos> Forward observer.<eos> I spent plenty of time in the dirt.<eos> My aides.
No, his name's Andre.<eos> A'ight?<eos> He's a good kid.<eos> Made all A's last year.<eos> Never been in any kind of trouble with the police.<eos> When I saw that gun under Andre's bed, you know, it scared the hell out of me, and believe me, when he comes home from school, I'm gon' get to the bottom of this.<eos> Is my uncle in some kind of trouble?<eos> That depends on how this goes.<eos> He found your gun.<eos> What gun?
I want a conviction as much as anybody.<eos> Don't you think we need to disclose that we found the murder weapon?<eos> You just told Jefferies it's not exculpatory.<eos> If you were defense counsel, wouldn't you want to know about this?<eos> Landmark case of State v. Jagger.<eos> You can't always get what you want.<eos> Law's not rock 'n' roll.<eos> We play by the rules, and we err on the side of<eos> - do unto others.<eos> - Gospel.
Drop me off on Ashland.<eos> I don't wanna be rolling' up on my block with PD.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> You're getting door-to-door service.<eos> You heard your lawyer.<eos> Get inside, stay inside.<eos> Yeah. All right.<eos> We'll be back to pick you up Friday morning.<eos> - Yo, Stack, what up, man?<eos> - Hey, yo, what up?
And when he left here, he was wearing Andre's clothes.<eos> Why didn't you tell this to our investigators?<eos> All right, look. You have to understand. Keo is my sister's only child.<eos> All right? Family.<eos> But between you and me, kid's been in some trouble before.<eos> Where do we find Keo?<eos> This is Drexel Posse territory.<eos> It's the kid in the white tank top.<eos> The Chief Keef wannabe.<eos> Yo, Keo! What?
Andre won't have Keo threatening him anymore.<eos> Aren't you tired of all this?<eos> Damn right, I am.<eos> Then help us get justice.<eos> I've tried to do the right thing this whole time.<eos> I turned in the gun like I was supposed to.<eos> I told you the truth about Keo when you asked me.<eos> I dropped what I was doing, and came over here tonight.<eos> But if Drexel Posse finds out I was anywhere near a courtroom, or a Grand Jury, what do you expect is going to happen to me and Andre?<eos> What?

If there was any other option...<eos> He's a human being, not a pawn in a chess game.<eos> I won't be a party to this.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> Kerry.<eos> Kerry!<eos> - Please.<eos> - How could you do this to me?<eos> - To you?<eos> - Yes, to me.
Your client's gonna walk.<eos> I'm deceiving a client, participating in a sham trial.<eos> Wait.<eos> We know who killed Lara Haley now, and the only way we're gonna get this guy is if we all take a little risk.<eos> When I started here, they had me doing research in Appeals.<eos> Stone was prosecuting Victor Cathridge.<eos> The guy who murdered three women on the L.<eos> One day during the trial, I walked into the courtroom to drop off a brief.<eos> Stone was cross-examining a witness, and while I was waiting there, I saw Cathridge was fidgeting with something under the defense table.<eos> - Oh, no.
Morning, Keo.<eos> I'd like to call your attention to the afternoon of July 11th.<eos> Were you in the Englewood neighborhood that day?<eos> - Could be.<eos> - Specifically at the home of your cousin, a boy named Andre Williams?<eos> Andre said I was there?<eos> Just answer the question.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> But you do remember changing into some of Andre's clothes around that time, right?<eos> What kind of clothes?
Okay.<eos> After what he's been through, it's what he deserves.<eos> Yes. Honest and natural.<eos> Thank you.<eos> There she is.<eos> It's where Dad gave me my first sip of whisky.<eos> Kept a bottle there ever since.<eos> He always joked that we only kept Scotland in the kingdom for their scotch.<eos> Cheers.<eos> For Dad.
It's nothing. Just a girl.<eos> If you say so.<eos> Let's take a walk tonight. Just us.<eos> You can't. You're supposed to be dead.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And I've only got 12 more hours to be dead.<eos> Meet me after dark.<eos> Let's do it for Dad.<eos> For Dad.<eos> HELP!
With my watch's homing beacon damaged,<eos> I knew that I couldn't waste that flare on anything but an absolute certainty.<eos> But I leapt at the first opportunity I had to be rescued.<eos> And when I saw that blessed fishing boat turn around... well, I could almost taste that cold pint of London Pride on my lips.<eos> Now, I assume you have some questions.<eos> Mr. Crenshaw.<eos> In the last however many months, did you...<eos> Ten months, three weeks, four days. Right.<eos> In the last ten months, three weeks and four days, did you ever lose hope?<eos> Good question.
Using flames to grill meat, and all eating together.<eos> It's something our ancestors might have done.<eos> I wonder if we have that in our DNA.<eos> Cooking the meat you caught on an open fire, all eating together.<eos> It's along the same lines.<eos> Using fire to cook meat is perhaps something only humans do.<eos> That may well be the beginning of the human race.<eos> That's something special.<eos> I've never really thought of it before, but talking about it now, that's what I think.<eos> [in English] Hard work, huh?
Get it in the legs, in the legs!<eos> Keep those tongs away from me!<eos> [man speaking in Mongolian] Because you all gather, sit down and enjoy the boodog together, the meat tastes better.<eos> The main pleasure of the meal comes from eating it and sharing it together as a whole family, because you laugh, and smile, and talk.<eos> That's the pleasure of sharing it with your family.<eos> I am very proud that I am Mongolian.<eos> Our ancestors said that we have ties to the sky.<eos> So I am really proud that I am a Mongolian.<eos> If there is such a thing as being reborn, I'd like to be born as a Mongolian again.<eos> [indistinct chatter] [in Swedish] Like this.
[woman speaking in English] And it's one way to strengthen ourselves, and an opportunity to come home and have family sessions, learning.<eos> And letting our children, our offspring know their history, and part of our culture.<eos> How many fellas does it take to tie down a trailer?<eos> [man speaking in Maori] There's craploads of work needed to put on a successful hāngi.<eos> So many logistical things that are part of a successful hāngi.<eos> From collecting the firewood, to fetching the stones, to getting the iron baskets, to getting and preparing the food.<eos> There's craploads of work!<eos> It's the hole for the hāngi.<eos> [in English] I know!<eos> Okay, one more bit.
From collecting the firewood, to fetching the stones, to getting the iron baskets, to getting and preparing the food.<eos> There's craploads of work!<eos> It's the hole for the hāngi.<eos> [in English] I know!<eos> Okay, one more bit.<eos> Sweet! Okay, hop out.<eos> [both] Not yet, not yet!<eos> Not that one. Gotta put the big one on first.<eos> [man speaking in Maori] When you lay your wood out, the bigger logs must be placed on the outside, while the smaller logs are placed on the inside.<eos> Just like that.
Okay, so, everyone wash their hands, not just for cacas, but also for wee-wees.<eos> And if you need help wiping, well, just come see me, okay?<eos> Obviously, that part is just for the children.<eos> I was gonna say, "Wee-wees too?"<eos> Who washes their hand after a wee-wee?<eos> Can we take Marcus off of produce, please?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Glenn, I don't want to tell you how to parent, but one of your kids is drawing on the back of Mateo's head.<eos> What?
I don't know what that means.<eos> Yeah, we were too afraid to ask.<eos> But, um, but, yeah, that... that, uh, Kristen, she... she seems... she seems cool.<eos> "it wouldn't even be weird if I asked her out" kind of cool.<eos> I don't know, I mean, she is the boss' daughter.<eos> Yeah, I know, I... that's... uh, that's... that's... I know that. I just sort of kind of felt like we had a connection, you know?<eos> Yeah, but you're always<eos> It's one of the many, many annoying things about you.<eos> So it's not that you're super jealous and in love with me and want me all to yourself?<eos> First of all, ew.
All right. I'll catch you later, brother.<eos> Not brother brother...<eos> you know what I meant.<eos> This is a disaster.<eos> Why didn't you just say no?<eos> I can't be the bad guy.<eos> The last time I meddled in Kristen's love life, she didn't talk to me for a week.<eos> Can you talk to her?<eos> Come on, you are so good at being the bad guy.<eos> What?
Like, um, he talks way too much about cheese.<eos> And you don't want that.<eos> The last guy I dated stole all my jewelry.<eos> Uh, well, it's not... it's not just cheese.<eos> He's got other stuff.<eos> Like... like... he... like he has this list of French films that he says he's gonna watch, and he never will.<eos> You know, honestly, I mean, none of that seems that bad to me.<eos> Great. Cool.<eos> Well, I just... I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of the... the cheese and the... the films.<eos> And the meth.
And you guys aren't friends anymore?<eos> Oh, honey...<eos> Let me tell you a story about a man named Jeff and why you shouldn't date white guys.<eos> I'm supposed to be in Pharmacy, but I need to switch.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, with my raging drug addiction, I probably shouldn't be near cough syrup.<eos> Okay, um, let me start by saying I did not want to get involved.<eos> Really?<eos> Because you got involved.<eos> In a real weird way.
Are we talking about the same Amy?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry, I gotta get these squirrels.<eos> I got so many squirrels, Jonah.<eos> Okay. Thank you.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> I know what I did.<eos> Okay, everybody is saying something different, so none of us are gonna leave here until we figure out what the hell is going on.<eos> Dad, did you tell Amy to stop me from going out with Jonah?<eos> What?
Uh, ten, 11, 12...<eos> Here's Bobbie Sue.<eos> - Hey. - I definitely didn't lose her.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Has everyone got their stuff? Okay. All right.<eos> So is Jerusha a big "Lord of the Rings" fan?<eos> Uh, no, this is "Willow."<eos> What's "Lord of the Rings"?<eos> Okay, guys, on three.<eos> One...
You know, just in case you wind up joining the family.<eos> Um, sure.<eos> Seems wildly premature, but why not?<eos> Wow, good thing you already look like an elf.<eos> So Jonah and Glenn's daughter, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What, what are you laughing at?<eos> Don't tell her.<eos> Okay, guys, on three, say "Jerusha."<eos> One.
Caroline, we don't have a good connection, and not just because we're dueling Scorpios.<eos> Peek-a-boo!<eos> - I see you! - [laughing]<eos> Oleg.<eos> All right, now do it with Barbara.<eos> Han, we had all of our belongings thrown out of a private plane.<eos> HAN: Caroline, you're cutting out.<eos> All I heard was "private plane." Brag much?<eos> No, we need to get to Texas, so can you please put $500 in my PayPal account?<eos> What?
Are you selling pony rides with Chestnut?<eos> Yes, but you got to wait in line with the other kids.<eos> No, you don't, buddy.<eos> Up you go, champ.<eos> Get your hands off me!<eos> I don't want my picture taken!<eos> Right now.<eos> The girls asked me to make sure you're feeding him, and here you are pimping him out like... this isn't my wheelhouse.<eos> Famous pimps, anyone?<eos> What?
Would there happen to be a 7 Eleven Merlot?<eos> Max, wine in our room sounds so much better.<eos> We can relax and focus on each other for once.<eos> Mm, great.<eos> What's the room number?<eos> Oh.<eos> I think she means oh-six.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> That room is still an active crime scene.<eos> [clears throat]
I didn't wanna strip my clothes off and try to drive the boat.<eos> It was that voodoo curse.<eos> Damn you, Tim!<eos> Look, dude, if you're really a mentalist, you'll know that I need to get to Texas to see my boyfriend. [grunts]<eos> I can tell that you're telling the truth.<eos> Please, there has got to be a way we can work something out.<eos> We'll do anything.<eos> Well, she will.<eos> I'll do over the shirt stuff.<eos> Your shirt.
[gasps] Thank you.<eos> Your catfish tower's on its way.<eos> It takes two to carry the cocktail sauce lagoon.<eos> Everything on double-zero.<eos> Which has to be the Yelp rating of this boat.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Could I get a white wine spritzer?<eos> Oh, come on, Vera.<eos> We share a locker.<eos> Oh, double-zero.
I'll get out here.<eos> When you get back to your country house tonight, go out back and take a sauna.<eos> Get focused.<eos> That's an order.<eos> You know, I usually get a full-on Woodrow Wilson going when I'm billing a client for hundreds of lawyer hours a week.<eos> But, every hour I spend with you, I'm aware little by little, you're getting wiped out, and that's even though I'm underbilling you.<eos> And then I sign the slips for all the associates putting in time on your cases, and I wind up feeling a little sick.<eos> Just keep doing what you're doing.<eos> I'll figure it out.<eos> How about the house?
Special-interest groups'll pile on, environmentalistas.<eos> That flame'll burn quick, and then I'll bleed the guy out.<eos> He'll take my price.<eos> They always do.<eos> Two years at the outside.<eos> Look, I'd be willing to pop up there, see what I can...<eos> Have at it.<eos> Maybe you'll turn him.<eos> I'm gonna go check on the grill.<eos> Two years?
I think it helps stabilize them.<eos> And it means a lot to me, too.<eos> Good.<eos> How ya doing?<eos> Very well. Quite well.<eos> You sure?<eos> Busy, but, otherwise, I'm crackerjack.<eos> And I'm about to bust open a bottle of rosé to prove it.<eos> Care to join me?<eos> The Wolffer?
Eva would be thrilled to have a smaller portion.<eos> Shit.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Yes, who's there?<eos> Alligator.<eos> Alligator who?<eos> Alligator the shark. He has a beard growing.<eos> What? !
Can you spare a minute?<eos> I have been hearing rumblings about a little town upstate, and I wondered what you could confirm for me.<eos> You know my ear's always to the rail.<eos> What do you know about Sandicot?<eos> The gaming license?<eos> That's what I heard.<eos> If you're looking to buy, you have to do it quickly.<eos> They're announcing soon, and there's sure to be a bounce.<eos> You'll keep this between us?<eos> What a question.
And for that, you throw in the fucking Indian Four.<eos> And would you be able to decide on the facts, regardless of your personal beliefs? Yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Potential juror number two...<eos> Actually, Your Honor, I have a couple of supplemental questions.<eos> Okay. But let's keep it moving.<eos> Understood.<eos> Do you have any idea how much wealth in this country is controlled by the top 20 percent?<eos> A shit ton.
He came to me with information that made it clear he was still involved.<eos> He made it clear that I was to try to get the same information... but to do so in a way that...<eos> Yes, General.<eos> But...<eos> I-I understand. Yes. Yes, ma'am.<eos> No. No.<eos> Um, of course.<eos> As you wish.<eos> You can go.<eos> What?
In this case, I imagine it's both.<eos> There's another reason people like each other. They see something they're lacking, and they want to be near it.<eos> Is that what's between the two of you?<eos> I've noticed a... connection.<eos> Everyone always just assumes we were fucking.<eos> I didn't.<eos> No.<eos> We met at a similar moment, when we were both trying to figure out who we were going to be.<eos> - And did you?<eos> - What?
How?<eos> Just buy him something.<eos> Look, I'm just saying. How many major banks have had their CEOs sent to fucking jail? Jail!<eos> It's a small list, isn't it?<eos> Spartan-Ives is tainted. A lot of shops don't want them walking through the door.<eos> I get the anti-them.<eos> What's the pro-you?<eos> Industry leaders, like Axe Capital, need to get away from the gilded cage. - That's why we host...<eos> - How much will you undercut. Spartan-Ives over the next two years?<eos> Ten percent.
Capital idea.<eos> You don't want to get in on this?<eos> No lap dances. I made a pledge.<eos> To Deb?<eos> You're exclusive?<eos> She's not. I am.<eos> I like your mustache.<eos> I have a mustache?<eos> You ever see guys in here from SoulCycle?<eos> All the time.
You got to jump primes now.<eos> Enjoy your white truffle drink.<eos> You're wasting the world's most perfect fungus.<eos> - Try it.<eos> - Pass.<eos> You know what it takes to find a truffle?<eos> A hog, a dog, whatever keenly scented, carefully trained animal gets the assignment, spends a lifetime traipsing through the dark, sniffing out the slightest aroma.<eos> And only then the digging begins.<eos> And what do you think they're digging through?<eos> Shit.
So I guess you have a choice. This can be the way the people of New York finally learn your name for forcing your son straight in the name of the Lord.<eos> "Healing touch" should play great in the five boroughs.<eos> Or you can step aside and explain that you have looked at the future, and where we're going, "We need Rhoades."<eos> You think this is how this is gonna go?<eos> I will see you in the primaries, Chuck.<eos> Looking forward to it.<eos> A Hell in a Cell poster?<eos> Autographed by Taker and Mankind? !<eos> - Ben, did you get me this?<eos> - What?
What was Stan Stasiak and his heart punch?<eos> Actually, I got it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's got a "Brokeback" sort of charm.<eos> "I just can't quit you."<eos> Yeah, I know where that is.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> That was Foley.<eos> Just invited me to his house.<eos> For the party?
You got me VR goggles?<eos> What, am I turning 13?<eos> If you were, Uncle Wagsy would be getting you laid by the most beautiful call girl in the state.<eos> But you're a big man having a big birthday, so the gift matches. And you're not there yet.<eos> It's called The Arque, the foremost luxury bunker for end times.<eos> A hedge against humanity.<eos> Stocks of non-perishable food, water purification equipment, seed banks,<eos> DNA cold storage, medical supplies, and surgical equipment.<eos> Everything you need, jefe, even weapons.<eos> - For what?
God, I wish I had the stones to skip it. I hate these things.<eos> You love parties.<eos> Well, I recently took the Myers-Briggs personality test, and it turns out I'm an introvert.<eos> I'm not sure that test is rock-solid.<eos> I thought I like parties, but I don't. On a deeper level, it disturbs my equilibrium.<eos> Is that why you woke up the day after the Christmas party in a yellow snow drift behind the strip joint?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Bearing of a Roman Centurion?<eos> Or slices through rough seas - like a Man-O-War?<eos> - What?
And secrecy, you know?<eos> No VR sales tours.<eos> And we'd also have to make room for my family,<eos> Matty and Mary and Ned and Connie and Lu and Mo, Sean.<eos> Yeah, I'm not sure about that, Lar.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Well, we wouldn't leave them just to die.<eos> We'd buy two Arques, ours in the Canadian Rockies, and one for your family in...<eos> Jersey.<eos> - So generous.
I'm not liquid enough to pull the trigger.<eos> I find that hard to fathom.<eos> My cash on hand happens to be tied up in an few real estate deals right now, and it's not the right time to sell.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Kingsford?<eos> I think it's best we not discuss that.<eos> With your position, that would be unethical.<eos> But there is a solution.<eos> The chunk of cash I need is on a statement with your name on it.<eos> - The blind trust.
- Welcome. Thank you.<eos> You know, we never really had you over to the house enough.<eos> And I appreciate the personal follow-up.<eos> Chuck was, um... quite surprised to hear from you.<eos> Well, I'm glad you came.<eos> Bobby will really value you being here.<eos> I couldn't tell when I spoke to him at work.<eos> I thought you weren't really talking at work.<eos> I'm sure it must be hard for you to not have access to him, but we think it's best for everyone.<eos> Clear boundaries this time.
And I don't know what kind of cookies you like, so there's a variety.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We've long suspected criminal activity at Axe Capital.<eos> I'm aware.<eos> And part of our work is to research the personnel of the company and to find within it a sympathetic partner.<eos> Because your background tells me you're an intelligent... a good person, so I'm just gonna come out and ask.<eos> Yes.<eos> Is there anything you see at Axe Capital that offends your sense of fairness, of right and wrong?<eos> What are you asking about?<eos> Fairness or right and wrong?
That's too much to steal.<eos> And too much to burn.<eos> No, it ain't.<eos> Did you say Monday?<eos> Well, I go... camp, get lads, come back...<eos> No, it would be Tuesday.<eos> Can you delay the shipment?<eos> - What, can I?<eos> - No, he can't.<eos> No, for one day.
And too much to burn.<eos> No, it ain't.<eos> Did you say Monday?<eos> Well, I go... camp, get lads, come back...<eos> No, it would be Tuesday.<eos> Can you delay the shipment?<eos> - What, can I?<eos> - No, he can't.<eos> No, for one day.<eos> For half a day even.
And they're all due for export to the city.<eos> According to Culper, who is now verified secure, the boat arrives Monday.<eos> I reckon with 40 or 50 men, we could demolish the stockpile and the fortress.<eos> But you require my permission, unlike your last raid in Setauket.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Why 50? Why not more?<eos> Well, Culper... they said they ain't got no cannon at the fort, sir, only muskets.<eos> Sir, do you think that we should not risk this action or do you not trust me to lead it?<eos> How did you wait before showing me this letter from General Arnold?<eos> One day, sir.
Well, pray then, won't you join us?<eos> That is, if you don't find talk of snakes and spies too distasteful.<eos> Mr. Mulligan comes in two or three times a week to have a drink or to have something printed in the "Gazette."<eos> He is a loyal customer.<eos> Loyal, yes.<eos> But to whom?<eos> I had heard some gossip of some Whiggish leanings before the war.<eos> - And?<eos> - It was just that.<eos> Gossip.
This is General Arnold's house, but he ain't home and we all hired up.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> You don't know Abigail or the boy, Cicero?<eos> Who's asking?<eos> Mountain Joe?<eos> King George.<eos> You want your gal back, you gotta cross the river to the rebel side.<eos> They sent her with a pass to help clean up her boss for the rope.<eos> Took the boy with her.<eos> A pass?
Apologize?<eos> Well, yes, for my behavior last night.<eos> I thought it improper to correct someone paying me such a gracious compliment, so I excused myself quickly, which was even more improper,<eos> - so I...<eos> - Not at all.<eos> I wasn't offended, and if I gave offense, I surely wasn't aware.<eos> This is what I came to realize.<eos> Though I am curious as to the correction you speak of.<eos> If only to avoid such impropriety in the future.<eos> Just this.
You did it before.<eos> And you're still in bed with Cooke!<eos> I am gouging Cooke.<eos> I'm charging him three times the going rate so his officers can eat ham this winter, and I'm doing it for you.<eos> This is the deed to Whitehall, which I have now signed over to you.<eos> If you want this to be worth anything at the end of this...<eos> I told you, I don't care about your money.<eos> No?<eos> What do you care about?<eos> Our family. Our country.
I told you, I don't care about your money.<eos> No?<eos> What do you care about?<eos> Our family. Our country.<eos> - And this town.<eos> - This town.<eos> Yes, and I'm sick of seeing it bled dry<eos> - by these leeches!<eos> - If you burn that hay before the farmers are paid for it, they will bleed and starve!<eos> No, no, no.
I know you've been hard at work.<eos> This is Freddy Morgan.<eos> You remember meeting him at Kennedy House?<eos> I know it's late, but I expected you earlier, and, well, Freddy has something very important to tell you about someone.<eos> He's read your mention in the "Gazette."<eos> And...<eos> Well, Freddy?<eos> General, sir, I'm a coiffeur, or a friseur... hairdresser if you like.<eos> And I have plied this trade both in Philadelphia and now in New York, where I took on a client by the name of Philomena Cheer.<eos> An actress.
Perhaps your father wants some, he's hardly eaten.<eos> - Not feeling well. - What about dessert?<eos> - I baked a custard pie.<eos> - You have to try that.<eos> It's her specialty, you have to.<eos> Custard and brandy.<eos> Warms you right up, and heaven knows<eos> - it's cold outside.<eos> - It's frigid.<eos> Well, maybe just one spoon.
- You have to try that.<eos> It's her specialty, you have to.<eos> Custard and brandy.<eos> Warms you right up, and heaven knows<eos> - it's cold outside.<eos> - It's frigid.<eos> Well, maybe just one spoon.<eos> Judge, there's some gentlemen here to see you.<eos> Who is...<eos> Heaven blast!
Caleb!<eos> Charge! Charge!<eos> Give us quarter!<eos> Quarter!<eos> Sit down.<eos> Washington and glory!<eos> Washington and glory!<eos> Washington and glory!<eos> Sergeant, take your men and clear the house.<eos> Yes, sir.
Washington and glory!<eos> Washington and glory!<eos> Washington and glory!<eos> Sergeant, take your men and clear the house.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Pioneers, demolish the enemy's works.<eos> And the rest of you, burn the hay.<eos> All of it.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What?
They mention a lady named 355.<eos> Perhaps that's Philomena Cheer.<eos> It's all guesswork.<eos> Informants, tipsters, cheats.<eos> "Tallmadge."<eos> These are Tallmadge's dogs.<eos> "723 man in New York.<eos> 722 man on Long Island.<eos> 725 whaleboat courier."<eos> Whaleboat.
- I'm not gonna make you.<eos> - You promise?<eos> - Yeah, I promise.<eos> You will come with me?<eos> I need to piss.<eos> Hold it.<eos> We stand still, they may pass.<eos> I can take them all in 10 seconds.<eos> You shoot, more come.<eos> Then what?
You like him?<eos> Like, yeah.<eos> I'm not in love.<eos> Been in love. This isn't it.<eos> It can creep up on you.<eos> Jake's important to us.<eos> And I like him.<eos> In that order?<eos> Does there have to be an order?<eos> Oh, God damn.
It's all part of a grand plan...<eos> One that's been taking place before the dead walked.<eos> Do you know what "apocalypse" means?<eos> The end of the world.<eos> No.<eos> It means the great unveiling. When i started collecting relics to save them, I kept seeing a theme, in petroglyphs,<eos> Prophecies of what we're going through right now--<eos> Dawn of a new age When the land will be shed of the impure.<eos> Impure, like the ottos.<eos> Like me.
Worked the kitchen at black hat.<eos> Good, that'll help.<eos> So, am i a prisoner here? We're all prisoners somewhere.<eos> You know, there's no walls at walker's place.<eos> He says it's 'cause you can't sneak up on an indian.<eos> Oh, well, they've been lucky.<eos> Madison, alicia was never in trouble.<eos> She got a taste of freedom, and now it's gone.<eos> For the both of us.<eos> Because of me.
Your family's welcome to hole up here - if it ever comes to it.<eos> - When it comes to it.<eos> Want a drink? Come on, drink with me.<eos> I wanna thank you for standing by my boys and by Troy, and for trying to stop what's coming.<eos> That's good.<eos> Told Jake I couldn't come to an agreement with Walker.<eos> That was a lie.<eos> There is one way to secure the peace.<eos> He probably wants my scalp, huh?<eos> What?
Nature took Romanov, because he ordered Link.<eos> Every time, She spared me.<eos> Now think about that before you question me again.<eos> I miss it.<eos> Are you going out there again?<eos> Soon... when I know what it wants me to do.<eos> You probably shouldn't touch me.<eos> Your mom will shoot off my hand.<eos> And even if it's burned, I kind of like it.<eos> Any news on the western front?
What?<eos> Raising a baby alone.<eos> My mother was not...<eos> She wasn't around... so I know how it is to be raised by a dad who...<eos> It's the last thing that I wanted for Jay.<eos> But that's what he got.<eos> I had no idea what I was doing.<eos> I don't know how to... talk about things or teach someone how to be, you know... a person.<eos> And I messed up... and I raised a boy who...<eos> What?
Of course.<eos> We need... I need iodine.<eos> There should be some up there, top shelf.<eos> - Maybe just some bandaids.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I'm not taking any chances with this.<eos> Let me see it.<eos> Hey, don't worry.<eos> DDo you promise?<eos> What?
Do I promise what?<eos> That I'll always be a part of your family, no matter what?<eos> I promise.<eos> Even if I did something stupid?<eos> Adrian, don't worry.<eos> I'm not gonna leave you, okay?<eos> All right. Let's see if they have anything else.<eos> Why do you have...<eos> I just didn't want to be alone.<eos> What?
You need to tell me where he is.<eos> He's dead!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> My dad killed him.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> He shot him in the... in the face.<eos> I tried.<eos> What do we do?<eos> We go to the mall.<eos> Why?
Ania!<eos> Mama!<eos> Where are you taking her?<eos> Go!<eos> Mama!<eos> There could be more children inside.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So close!<eos> The next one is yours.<eos> Again!
I'd arrange your travel and accommodation, of course.<eos> If you would consider it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That would be lovely.<eos> Herr brigadefuhrer!<eos> There could still be snipers.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Where are the other men?<eos> Retreating. Please, herr brigadefuhrer.<eos> For your own safety.
Tell me.<eos> Just tell neil I got invited to a gala in berlin.<eos> And voigt will be there.<eos> We've got a chance to get this done. We're leaving tomorrow.<eos> What the hell do you want?<eos> How do you do it?<eos> Get out. How do you do it?<eos> How do you live with yourself?<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> What?
Where am I supposed to get oranges or whatever?<eos> The Partnership Freedom Bars are a poor substitute, but they have vitamin C.<eos> You need the nutrients.<eos> In the meantime... multivitamins to start you off.<eos> Powdered vitamin C. Mix with water.<eos> I will.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Miller.<eos> That's it?<eos> Vitamin C?<eos> Luckily for your wife, yes.
A guy like me... a provider with food, gas, and ammo to spare... and Nicole chooses a dude with a neck tattoo on instead? I...<eos> Food, gas, and ammo, you say?<eos> Damn straight.<eos> Power and sewer.<eos> A nice, soft bed.<eos> Roman?<eos> How, uh... how far is this little nest of yours, man? Where is it?<eos> - Not far.<eos> - Huh!<eos> What?
Bien.<eos> No worries.<eos> I've got a stunning visual on your beer.<eos> - So now what?<eos> - Hm.<eos> Well, now we sit and wait.<eos> Wait, he's calling.<eos> Someone just slipped a phone into my pocket.<eos> I may have to go off-line for a while.<eos> What?
Missions in Afghanistan and French Guiana.<eos> Where his military career came to an abrupt end, since then he's been an army of one.<eos> Specializing in slave retrievals.<eos> Slave retrievals?<eos> Rescuing women abducted for trafficking.<eos> There are a handful of guys who make a living like this.<eos> Since 2013, he's been wanted by Interpol for questioning about a shooting in an Austrian brothel.<eos> The girl he was trying to rescue was executed by her kidnappers.<eos> You don't think Mia was trafficked?<eos> What?
Where are we going?<eos> Well, I am not going anywhere, but I'm handing you over to some people.<eos> What people?<eos> Oh, I got you a leaving present.<eos> All the songs you recorded here.<eos> So you can be a pop star like Britney Spears.<eos> Julia, leave the suitcase and join us for a moment, please.<eos> Mia, I want you to kiss Julia goodbye.<eos> Come on, it's just a kiss.<eos> On both cheeks.
Oh, you came here to help me?<eos> Yes, you need to move. Right now.<eos> Jean-Luc, listen, we gotta go now.<eos> They're coming for her.<eos> - And you want me to run?<eos> - I want you to live.<eos> You think you're better than me, but you're not.<eos> We both make a leaving saving people.<eos> I know you're trying to do the right thing, in your own way.<eos> Down!
I think, to him, this is some kind of, I don't know, opportunity to settle the score.<eos> It's... out of the question.<eos> I don't think you should make that decision that quickly.<eos> Listen, it's always this way.<eos> Engineers make the impossible possible.<eos> Lawyers try to stop them with paperwork.<eos> If I was afraid of lawyers, I wouldn't have a $120 billion company.<eos> Is that an APB call?<eos> Yeah, but I'm not on shift, so I don't...<eos> No.
You want some more? !<eos> No, I think that'll do just fine.<eos> Get up then!<eos> Cpd!<eos> Freeze! My god, thank god you're here.<eos> I thought he was gonna kill me. Come on, man. I ain't gonna...<eos> Man, hands up! Hands up!<eos> All right!<eos> Calm down, man. The bitch be all right.<eos> On the counter.
Maybe two?<eos> You know, my dad said something to me when I was a kid that always stuck with me.<eos> He said, "Gideon, you got to know when you're beat."<eos> Sorry, I should have clarified, I hated my dad, and I made it my business to never, ever know when I'm beat.<eos> Look, we have every armored car company in the city on alert, and in the meantime, we have a crime scene.<eos> We have an hour.<eos> God knows I love a challenge.<eos> What do you expect us to do in an hour?<eos> Getting stuff back from forensics lab takes at least a week.<eos> A week?
They're gonna kill the guards!<eos> No, there's too many of them.<eos> And they have a bomb.<eos> They killed Linc!<eos> I'm not gonna let them drop anyone else.<eos> Are those things bulletproof?<eos> So far.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah. Where the hell's my backup?<eos> Two minutes out!
Speaking of which, um... I wanted to talk to you about that transfer that your ex-husband gave you.<eos> What about it?<eos> What happened today wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for... All this.<eos> You almost died today.<eos> And I'm thinking... I'm thinking, maybe it would be better if you did move to another district. Gideon...<eos> You know, I don't know a lot of cops, but, you're the best one I've ever met.<eos> And by contrast, your ex is an enormously unpleasant dick.<eos> But he's at least right about one thing.<eos> You're a really great mom and...<eos> And what?
That's a matter of perspective.<eos> Look, we both know that this is as much about the fact that your ex-wife works here than it is about anything that I'm doing.<eos> My marriage has nothing to do with this.<eos> This is about your blatant disregard for the law.<eos> And, Mr. Reeves, I'll see you at the mayor's office on Thursday.<eos> We'll determine which of those cases will be dismissed.<eos> I suggest you come prepared.<eos> You've stepped in it now.<eos> I just...<eos> My...
I just don't know how it all went so wrong.<eos> Well... that's exactly what we're gonna try to figure out.<eos> Let me just get this straight.<eos> You want to take on a shot-in-the-dark drug case for a vigilante now?<eos> Well, there might be more positive ways of put...<eos> Yeah, that sounds about right.<eos> Look, we found some evidence from Mr. Ruiz.<eos> Not a lot, but he did find the major points of sale for Hi-town.<eos> I mean, it's a start.<eos> A start?
Can you just shut up?<eos> All right, right there.<eos> That car...<eos> That's the buyer.<eos> How can you tell?<eos> 'Cause she's not driving five miles an hour just to take in the beautiful scenery.<eos> Okay, that guy...<eos> He's the lookout.<eos> He watches out for the cops.<eos> And that one right there...
So now who do you arrest?<eos> The banker for taking cash from a guy at a car?<eos> Or the little kid with $30 worth of drugs?<eos> Well, there has to be more drugs.<eos> Sure, under a rock somewhere in this lot.<eos> Even if you do manage an arrest, good luck getting any of these guys to talk.<eos> Those guys aren't afraid of jail.<eos> They're planning on it.<eos> There has to be some connection to the higher-ups,<eos> - some way...
You know, actually, there's one thing.<eos> He used to feed the homeless down under the "L" at, Douglas Park, three times a week.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, do you think that's something?<eos> Do I think it's something?<eos> Yes, I think it's something.<eos> There are drug addicts in Douglas Park, to whom he might be selling drugs.<eos> Have you ever just, like, watched a cop show on TV?<eos> Anything?
Like it or not... And believe me, I don't... if Scott needs a stronger case, it's up to us to give it to him.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> I just, I can't believe it.<eos> He had the drugs.<eos> Well, and he knew how to work the system, you know?<eos> Use our rules against us.<eos> I'm afraid that... the law is not engineered to catch guys like Marcos Cruz.<eos> So this is all for nothing.<eos> Hey, we're not giving up.<eos> But for now...
Well, and he knew how to work the system, you know?<eos> Use our rules against us.<eos> I'm afraid that... the law is not engineered to catch guys like Marcos Cruz.<eos> So this is all for nothing.<eos> Hey, we're not giving up.<eos> But for now...<eos> You did what you could.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> What?
I'm a physician.<eos> I was indicted in 1995 for stealing medicine.<eos> There it is. See, Reyes?<eos> The guy's been dealing.<eos> No, it's not what you think.<eos> It was expired AIDS medication.<eos> The hospital was just gonna throw it away, so I broke in and gave them to the patients.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> It's insulin.<eos> And sandwiches.
I'm just trying to help people.<eos> Hey, bud, come here.<eos> Mom wants another hug.<eos> - Mwah! You have any more homework?<eos> - A little.<eos> All right, well, why don't you go back, and I want you to work until you got none.<eos> Okay.<eos> That smile doesn't fool me.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.
That smile doesn't fool me.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's just a long day.<eos> It's Scott, okay?<eos> I feel like... I feel like he's using his position to get back at me.<eos> Get back at you how?<eos> By investigating the 13th for misconduct.<eos> Look, I know it's his job, I just feel like, I don't know, he's making it personal.<eos> Qué idiota.
I watch a lot of Murder, She Wrote and Wheel of Fortune, TV in general.<eos> Are you done?<eos> 'Cause some of us like to work.<eos> - We starting?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna take a piss first.<eos> So, why don't you guys stretch it out?<eos> Get ready.<eos> Honey, you still doing blow?<eos> What?
Cherry's gonna be training you today.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - That's right. Come on.<eos> Cherry is a bona fide badass on the outside.<eos> On the inside she's like a marshmallow, like a Mallomar.<eos> And who doesn't like Mallomars, right, baby?<eos> Why you look so surprised?<eos> Listen...<eos> When I get back I want to see some moves.<eos> Some slamma jammas, some whammos.
On the inside she's like a marshmallow, like a Mallomar.<eos> And who doesn't like Mallomars, right, baby?<eos> Why you look so surprised?<eos> Listen...<eos> When I get back I want to see some moves.<eos> Some slamma jammas, some whammos.<eos> You know, anything that makes it look like we might just pull this thing off.<eos> If you need help, ask the big one.<eos> - I don't know anything about wrestling.<eos> - Not you. The other one.
Got on a plane for Vegas, two weeks later, I woke up, felt a lot better about myself.<eos> Thank you, that's great advice.<eos> I'll just, uh... leave my baby on a stranger's doorstep and get blackout drunk.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Did I break something on your set?<eos> Debbie, I've been casting this thing for weeks.<eos> I mean, just raking the gutter because who gives a shit? - Then you come outta nowhere, just burst in like some Greek goddess of rage, and I saw it.<eos> I saw it, Debbie.<eos> Like a vision before a seizure.<eos> The whole show.
Fuck her.<eos> I cut her the first day of callbacks.<eos> - Can we get four burgers, - One with cheese.<eos> - Four fries... - Five.<eos> Extra ketchup and mustard on the side and two Diet Pepsis and one Pepsi regular, and that's it.<eos> Ooh. And a milkshake!<eos> Oh, and get this girl a milkshake.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - We're in training, so we have to bulk up.<eos> Twenty even.
Kick, it's like a punch with your leg.<eos> Can I do the lockup instead, where I hug her?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No.<eos> Kick.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Give words to the pain.<eos> Oh, my God, it hurts!<eos> Fuck! Am I having a miscarriage?<eos> Ah! Oh, no!
Affirmative.<eos> All right.<eos> Time's a wastin'. There's hostages in there who aren't gonna rescue themselves.<eos> Chug 'em if you've got 'em, boys.<eos> We've gotta take that rooftop.<eos> Cover me.<eos> If we make it out of here, I'm transferring to accounting.<eos> See you on the rooftop.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Rooftop secure.
Positive.<eos> This vision was different.<eos> Longer. Cleaner.<eos> Something about Ravi's blue juice made it extra potent.<eos> Good. That's what we need.<eos> Let's pay Baracus a visit on the campaign trail tomorrow and get him to talk.<eos> How'd we do?<eos> Otis is dead.<eos> But a dozen Qumarian separatists won't be kidnapping any more American citizens.<eos> Souvenir?
Yeah, but I don't recognize any of them.<eos> They're all just rando dudes.<eos> - Rando dudes into kinky-ass...<eos> - When we get back to the station, get together with Jimmy.<eos> Well, we need to get those rando dudes sketched before you forget them.<eos> Or, if we're lucky, the case ends here.<eos> Ah, Detective.<eos> Ms. Moore. To what do I owe this pleasure?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Down on all fours.
- Yeah.<eos> Suspect number six.<eos> Dimple chin, high cheekbones, barbells in each of his nipples.<eos> This is kind of a "from the neck up" situation.<eos> Draw the nipples, Jimmy.<eos> Elevating my blood sugar levels might help me work faster.<eos> I brought my lunch.<eos> - Two bites.<eos> - It's soup.<eos> Then two swallows.
Rheumatoid arthritis ain't gonna stop no sweet lady from getting her swerve on.<eos> How much will a U-boat set me back?<eos> Twenty will get you a ticket to ride, my friend.<eos> - Can I hook you up?<eos> - Nah. Just professional curiosity.<eos> - Your stuff any good?<eos> - Negatory. Quality Utopium is a relic of a bygone era.<eos> Mr. Boss took out the crew slinging Lucky U.<eos> Not all of them.<eos> What?
I'm good, slick.<eos> The grand opening was a success.<eos> What do these fools keep saying?<eos> It's Bengali for "cheers."<eos> We're serving tiger brains?<eos> No... The brains are from a hospital in Bangladesh.<eos> If only my old corner boy buddies could see me now.<eos> A round of drinks on me!<eos> Don E., your humble proprietor.<eos> Cheers!
Eric, you have no idea what's going on in there.<eos> So I'm gonna go find out.<eos> I need you to get back and run point.<eos> Me?<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> Get to the boat.<eos> Wait there.<eos> I'll get a situation report.<eos> Everybody on the ground!<eos> On the ground... now!
So I'm gonna go find out.<eos> I need you to get back and run point.<eos> Me?<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> Get to the boat.<eos> Wait there.<eos> I'll get a situation report.<eos> Everybody on the ground!<eos> On the ground... now!<eos> - On the ground now!
I'm not leaving you.<eos> Get to the boat.<eos> Wait there.<eos> I'll get a situation report.<eos> Everybody on the ground!<eos> On the ground... now!<eos> - On the ground now!<eos> - Get down!<eos> Go on, by the window!<eos> Down on the ground, right now!
She's willing to see if Beaumont can set up a negotiation, but it's got to be fast.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Thank you, Commander.<eos> We've ID'd some of the hostage takers.<eos> Seems they're activists, suggesting an environmental motive.<eos> Send everything you've got to my people, and we'll run it through our CPIC database.<eos> How long ago did Eric send you that text?<eos> 1 hour, 58 minutes ago.<eos> T-minus two minutes.<eos> Protocol.
Did he just hang up on us?<eos> Someone hung up for him.<eos> ...damn traffic en route to the airport is impossible.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> "Traffic en route is impossible."<eos> Okay, first port of call is establish decision maker.<eos> He's saying negotiating with the leader is gonna be impossible.<eos> I'm gonna need time to find another way.<eos> "Find another way""<eos> Someone else.
Oliver thinks he's identified the leader.<eos> Lucas Hansen...<eos> not your typical hostage taker.<eos> Impressive GPA.<eos> Graduate degree in poli sci at 22.<eos> Donated half his scholarship to a cancer charity.<eos> Spent two months de-oiling birds after a tanker broke up in Puget Sound.<eos> And if that didn't qualify him for sainthood, he also volunteered at a shelter for runaway youth.<eos> De-oiling birds?<eos> What a monster.
I'm not thirsty.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> What happened in there?<eos> They searched me, emptied my pockets. Took a photograph.<eos> Photograph?<eos> Close-up of my face...<eos> some kind of special camera.<eos> Special how?<eos> Get back to your seats.<eos> Hostage-taking 101.
What's important now is that the police know, and you have to deal with that.<eos> I can tell you what to say.<eos> What are you gonna do if the police storm the island?<eos> Start executing old people.<eos> Old people.<eos> Right.<eos> Now, you know that I will do anything to avert loss of life.<eos> If that means convincing the cops to back the hell off, then that's what I'll do.<eos> He's calling!<eos> Contact.
He takes it out on you.<eos> He still blames me for kicking his dad out.<eos> I think he feels like he doesn't fit in anywhere.<eos> Come with me.<eos> If you reveal any of the following classified information, you'll be subject to criminal prosecution.<eos> Understood.<eos> The NEC's HQ in Ottawa has been under lockdown since last month, when a trace amount of a viral sample went missing.<eos> Tell me more about this archive at the NEC.<eos> What are the samples stored in?<eos> Titanium containers...
Hey, this thing could go any second.<eos> He won't trigger it until he's unlocked that virus.<eos> - Can you defuse it?<eos> - We're gonna try.<eos> All right people, listen up.<eos> We're going in hot.<eos> You, get BDU here right now.<eos> You two, come with me.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Roger that.
They would die for me.<eos> Will you let your team die because of you?<eos> As much as I love my guys, it's hardly a tough choice if it means saving the lives of hundreds of thousands.<eos> Is this what you signed up for?<eos> Killing every person you know and love so he can go down in history as the man who changed the world?<eos> Hmm?<eos> I'm not bluffing.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Oh, I know you will.<eos> Two more minutes.
- And do you believe her?<eos> - No. But she's been in D.C. longer than he has.<eos> At some point she'll take care of herself.<eos> Well, did you tell her I have no interest in discussing the Declaration of War Committee with him?<eos> I expressed our desire for a civil and productive meeting with the Congressman.<eos> Well, find him. If he wants to hide from me, he can do it to my face.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Oh, and, Doug.<eos> How many protestors are out there today?<eos> More than yesterday.
- Right.<eos> - No, it's true.<eos> I mean, if one or two of these really stubborn members of Congress decides they're going to hold this up, it could be months.<eos> Look, that's what I'm saying.<eos> The road to 26 votes is not an easy one.<eos> All right.<eos> Strange days indeed, Mika.<eos> So are these the start to short stories?<eos> They're nothing yet. Fragments.<eos> Pieces.
You know what? I do have some things to do.<eos> Some people I need to check in with. So...<eos> Tom.<eos> Yes?<eos> You ready, Mrs. Underwood?<eos> I'll have a car waiting for you.<eos> So do you want the good news or the bad news first?<eos> Always the bad.<eos> The president's approvals are down to 19%.<eos> And the good?
But there's already enough evidence out there to take the president down.<eos> And now, with this election, he'll be accountable for even more.<eos> - I'm certain of it.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> I don't care about Underwood.<eos> I want you to talk to Doug Stamper.<eos> I want you to find out what happened to my...<eos> Whatever, forget it.<eos> Hold on.<eos> - Thanks for the sandwich.
Uh, it was back in '64 or '65.<eos> A congressman was ducking him... and he came back to his office to find the president sitting in his chair... waiting for him.<eos> The president expects to see you within the hour.<eos> Miss Fazio can give you the specifics.<eos> - He was wearing his cowboy hat.<eos> - What?<eos> President Johnson.<eos> You left out the best part of the story.<eos> We closed the place down last night.<eos> Thanks for the invite.
My sister-in-law. She came when you couldn't.<eos> Do you think the dead judge us?<eos> No.<eos> What did he do that you liked the most?<eos> Here... in bed.<eos> Sitting up was the best.<eos> Legs around each other.<eos> He'd run his right hand up the back of my neck into my hair and pull it.<eos> My hair and my head back...<eos> And?
It's so nice in here.<eos> You can hardly hear them.<eos> Oh, trust me, I can hear them.<eos> With New Hampshire, it's what?<eos> Twenty-four. With Maine, 25.<eos> - Twenty-six if we get Wisconsin.<eos> - Where's Tom?<eos> He needed to get some air.<eos> - Wisconsin is being stubborn.<eos> - Then who else?
Come on.<eos> You want a tour of the White House, you could just straight up ask me for one.<eos> - Hammerschmidt.<eos> - Is he making anything of it?<eos> Not yet. But the information about her is on the top of his desk.<eos> Lisa Williams.<eos> Mr. Grayson, you have a call on line three.<eos> Well, I gotta get back to it.<eos> If Tom follows up on her, let me know.<eos> - Thanks for the pass.
A dead Dane, yes.<eos> Therefore, a good Dane.<eos> We are royalty, you and I.<eos> I have done my utmost to serve Alfred but with no reward, no response...<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To wash the blood off my hands and then to bed!<eos> Do you not believe me! ?<eos> Where did you see this corpse?<eos> Mercia.<eos> Beyond Watling Street.
Perhaps that is why Bjorn cannot rest... nor pass.<eos> Please, no. Please.<eos> Please, please...<eos> To raise the dead, Lord, we need to send a messenger across the gulf.<eos> He is guilty? - Twice over.<eos> - Please, I beg you, Lord, please.<eos> I have a wife, I have children, please.<eos> - What did you steal?<eos> - Just a lamb, Lord, for my family.<eos> - And furs.
King of Mercia. King of Saxon and Dane.<eos> King of other Kings.<eos> You. Lord Uhtred.<eos> Bury him.<eos> Lord King? It is done.<eos> What we have just witnessed... do you believe it to be true?<eos> I do.<eos> And me.<eos> It put a shiver through your spine, no doubt.<eos> So, what now?
Let us just enjoy an early morning.<eos> The two of us.<eos> And a hunting party.<eos> Who is it?<eos> It's Aethelred.<eos> The Lord of Mercia.<eos> Uhtred of Bebbanburg! Word has been that you were missing.<eos> Aethelred.<eos> I see you managed to remove your head from the King's arse.<eos> Well, for the moment...
That the ghost is a lie.<eos> If I tell him, he'll talk. And Sigefrid will hear.<eos> They must believe that we believe.<eos> I do enjoy another wedding.<eos> A royal wedding, in particular.<eos> It is a tonic for the soul.<eos> The excitement, the expense...<eos> Aethelwold, I'm still undecided, so do not mention talking corpses.<eos> Nobles have travelled across the sea, from as far as Frankia, solely to see the beautiful Aethelflaed marry this pretty bread-pudding of a boy.<eos> A fair description.
Leofric was a great man.<eos> You are Alfred's bastard son.<eos> No, but I... I wish to join you, lord.<eos> Be by your side as my uncle was.<eos> No, we have no need of a monk.<eos> As a warrior.<eos> Lord, I wish to serve you as a warrior.<eos> Uhtred?<eos> Uhtred, you are wanted.<eos> The King!
He is here, is he not?<eos> I would say that is response enough.<eos> Uhtred, I did not see you at the church, I do hope you were there.<eos> I was there, lady. of course I was.<eos> And may I say how beautiful you are today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My dear, we're discussing a matter of importance.<eos> Yes, I heard, lord.<eos> So, are the Northmen intending to remain in Lunden or are they waiting for a ransom?<eos> Fair question.
In my hand, I have a letter from Alfred of Wessex!<eos> It is the promise of one thousand men!<eos> It is the one thousand men demanded by our lord, Aethelred of Mercia, to fight alongside the great fryd of Mercia to help rid Lunden of the filthy, stinking, pox-ridden, pig's-arse ugly, heathen, Danish bastards!<eos> A toast!<eos> A toast!<eos> To the warriors of Mercia.<eos> Where we go, Alfred and Wessex shall follow.<eos> And we shall rise!<eos> We shall rise!<eos> To Mercia!

Should she be travelling at all to battle?<eos> It was her wish to accompany her husband.<eos> They are newly married, after all.<eos> She will be kept out of harm's way.<eos> Uhtred, has the King written that when the siege of Lunden begins, I am to be first up the ladder?<eos> It is, after all, something you would do.<eos> You accept that I am in charge, of all men.<eos> It's the King's wish.<eos> It is.<eos> Oh, dear...
No Steapa, you're with me.<eos> I am with Uhtred.<eos> The King says.<eos> Very well.<eos> I am with Steapa, behind Steapa.<eos> Your bravery knows no beginning, Aethelwold.<eos> A toast!<eos> To the Mercians who died for Wessex at Ethandun.<eos> And to the men of Wessex who will fight for Mercia at Lunden.<eos> To allies. To allies.
Wake up! Wake Up!<eos> Death Is Coming!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Take up your swords!<eos> Wake Up!<eos> Death Is Coming!<eos> Aethelflaed is to be protected!<eos> With your lives!<eos> For God and for the King!
John would be celebrated by any clan.<eos> Yeah, he's a real catch.<eos> ♪ I need you to show me the way ♪ Oh, my God.<eos> I'm gonna go get cleaned up.<eos> Yeah, let me show you where to go.<eos> Upstairs.<eos> Down the hall.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We're getting out of here.<eos> What?
John!<eos> John!<eos> John!<eos> John!<eos> Get the hell off of her!<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Can you stand?<eos> Wait!<eos> He's mine.<eos> - Whoa, Emori.
Please, just... just wait for the storm to pass.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Peter needs help now, right now!<eos> He can't breathe!<eos> If you go into that storm, 3 people die instead of two.<eos> You're out of options.<eos> It's time to let go.<eos> You said you'd be here. Where the hell are you?<eos> What am I supposed to tell them?<eos> The truth.

Things I can trade.<eos> I scavenge so my family can eat. Please.<eos> That's it.<eos> Find the right angle.<eos> I'll help you out.<eos> I love someone who was beaten and tortured by a man who thought he could control her.<eos> I'm not that man.<eos> You can torture me all you want, and that won't change the fact...<eos> Who's the scared child now, Baylis?<eos> For my brother.

So, in some ways, I guess he gave me my love of art.<eos> I'll always be grateful to him for that.<eos> 20 to 19 at the bank, Blackjack.<eos> The House wins.<eos> He's really going for it.<eos> He wants to bet his Lamborghini.<eos> What do you think we should do?<eos> Will you accept?<eos> Let him do it.<eos> Thanks for the ride.
In his world, up was down, black was white,<eos> and the Bank was merely leveraged.<eos> But in the end, "leveraged" was just a respectable word for debted<eos> and debt is bad.<eos> I'm alive.<eos> Should I be dead?<eos> I want to meet.<eos> Hello, this is Robert.<eos> Please leave a message and I'll get back to you.<eos> What?

I think your father was murdered.<eos> It's a Clios matter.<eos> There's something in there that Constantine didn't want me to see.<eos> I know it.<eos> I need to know if I made the worst mistake of my life.<eos> Your husband had the copy made for some oligarch to put on his yacht.<eos> I see it in you now.<eos> That look.<eos> What look?<eos> Revenge.
Constantine and I would host it together.<eos> The children would be allowed to stay for an hour and then, they'd be taken up to bed.<eos> You's always see them, like little birds... perched in line, at the top of the stairs, peering down.<eos> Adam used to send down Christos to steal canapes.<eos> Who are you thinking of inviting?<eos> Bored people and guilty people.<eos> Then why do you host them?<eos> Because I'm both guilty and bored.<eos> I can think of a few names I'd like to add to the guest list.<eos> Anyone in particular?
This way, please.<eos> Art work that doesn't leave the free port is exempt from all tax and Customs duties.<eos> Art sales conducted within these walls can also be considered tax-free<eos> Due to this, we hold many of the most expensive paintings in the world.<eos> You probably witnessed their sales at New York and London's most prestigious auction houses.<eos> I have probably bid on them.<eos> Yet, here...<eos> The sale merely involves the movement of canvas from one boat to the next.<eos> It is almost comical.<eos> If not a little bit tragic.
Who am I?<eos> Just a helpful friend.<eos> They have frozen my personal account as well as the business account.<eos> How the fuck am I supposed to live?<eos> Well, I can lend you a card.<eos> I don't want mommy's credit card!<eos> I want my fucking life back!<eos> I think, with the way you're acting at the moment, not having access to money might not be such a bad idea.<eos> You come here to lecture me, just...<eos> What?
Yeah, please do... Careful. One of a kind.<eos> I've heard the stories about this blade.<eos> Nearly a thousand lives claimed by its obsidian steel. The man who wielded this sword would never part with it.<eos> How did you get it?<eos> How do you think?<eos> - What do you want for it?<eos> - A shortcut into the Badlands.<eos> Give us that and the sword is yours.<eos> Shortcut?<eos> Your smuggling tunnels.
Takes a... special kind of man to do what you do.<eos> I didn't always want to be in the people business, Sunny.<eos> When I was a kid, all I wanted was to get into the Badlands and become a Baron.<eos> But now, I wouldn't trade places with a Baron for all the opium on the other side of the wall.<eos> Not with all the trouble that's brewing over there.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> One of my shipments went through a couple days ago.<eos> All the Barons are on high alert.<eos> They had some powwow to hash it out but it got crashed. Turned into a bloodbath.<eos> Bloodbath?
Well, let's have a look.<eos> - Tony.<eos> - OK.<eos> The shorts are right.<eos> The hair's right, and the age.<eos> What's that bangle thing on her wrist?<eos> Does it say "Eastbury"?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's the festival she went to.<eos> So, what?
Left at the stables.<eos> - Would you like a GP to look you over, love?<eos> - No, I'm all right!<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I know how difficult it's been since Mia... failed to return home.<eos> And I know you've been asked a hundred times, but... .. I would like to try and start with a clean slate.<eos> Is that all right?<eos> - Now, where this body was found...<eos> - For God's sake.
Do you know who owns that land?<eos> No-one.<eos> It's common ground.<eos> Our boundary's the copse.<eos> And so the pickers work for you?<eos> No.<eos> They work for him over the way.<eos> Rents the land off us.<eos> So, going back six weeks, you last saw your daughter...?<eos> - The Friday morning.
We just want to offer condolences to Mal and Nell, you know?<eos> My guys are offering to lend a hand if they need it.<eos> I'd say now's not a good time. Maybe in a day or two.<eos> That driver.<eos> Is he the fella rents from the parents?<eos> - Must be, yeah.<eos> - If he is, he's doing all right for himself.<eos> His motor!<eos> And while we're looking at people in the area, see if his workers are legit.<eos> What?

Mia Hinkin. 18 years of age.<eos> She lived and worked with mum and dad on a dairy farm just outside of Brindale.<eos> Failed to return home from Eastbury Festival some time after the 2nd of last month.<eos> Now, the body was found five miles from said dairy farm, 40 days after she left the village.<eos> She'd been strangled.<eos> Primary line of inquiry is to establish what time she departed the festival, who she met there, and who, if anyone, she went with.<eos> Now, Hicham, have you got the CCTV from the bus station yet?<eos> We're trawling, but neither us nor Missing Persons found her on any bus coming or going.<eos> And do we know who she was going to see, music-wise?<eos> - Party Crusade.
Nice.<eos> Good.<eos> Excuse me, love.<eos> Looking for Gary Tovey?<eos> I'm Mrs Tovey.<eos> Can I help?<eos> Ah. Just a word with your husband, love.<eos> - He's out.<eos> - When might he be back?<eos> Good question.
I was in the Army.<eos> You Google me, you'll find I was in Helmand until the withdrawal.<eos> Certain people like to take issue with that.<eos> Right.<eos> Bit of a contrast to life round here, though, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's all peace and tranquillity and no mistake.<eos> - Mum!<eos> Mum!<eos> - Right on cue.
We've been stuck in rehearsals all this week.<eos> Do you recognise this lass?<eos> That's Erin.<eos> She's er...<eos> She's our super-fan.<eos> Like, where we go, she goes.<eos> She'll have a couple of those bands.<eos> You should ask her about your missing girl...<eos> Maya?<eos> - Mia.

- Ma'am.<eos> - That's a matter of opinion.<eos> - Erin Michaels.<eos> Moved out of her last known address about a month ago.<eos> We got her on candid camera over there, but we don't pick her up any later.<eos> - So she jumped in the river and swam for it?<eos> - Very funny.<eos> The good news is she left her bag behind when she scarpered.<eos> And look at this.<eos> Just a moment.
So, definitely from here?<eos> How could Missing Persons cock that up?<eos> Her mobile phone was switched off.<eos> Case had gone cold.<eos> Oh, that's all right, then!<eos> And let's say she WAS planning on doing a bunk.<eos> That must have taken some planning.<eos> So, who else was in on it?<eos> Aside from her brother.<eos> - Anything?
- Somehow I doubt that.<eos> Just tell her we're here, love.<eos> Save me saying everything twice.<eos> - You must have known she'd gone missing?<eos> - Yeah, I knew.<eos> - It's nothing to do with me.<eos> - So why'd you scarper the other night?<eos> I had a bit of weed on us.<eos> I panicked.<eos> Yeah, and the rest.
Resented Mia, her whole life in front of her.<eos> So she couldn't let her go.<eos> Do you think that's why she left home without telling you?<eos> If I'd been a better dad... .. maybe she'd still be alive.<eos> I couldn't just sit there, waiting for news... .. with her disapproving silences.<eos> So I used to drive into town after dark.<eos> The place was so full of life.<eos> Sit there, waiting, watching.<eos> Hoping to catch a glimpse of her.<eos> Just a glimpse...
So we're thinking Lorna was in the bar the same night as Mia?<eos> Could have been.<eos> Blonde leaves at closing time, coat on, it's dark.<eos> He goes after her, turns out it's Lorna.<eos> Big mistake.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.<eos> Uniform have reported a disturbance.<eos> Brindale.<eos> In Jack Madden's field.<eos> Now what?
Hey, Kenny.<eos> Get over to The Lion and talk to that landlady.<eos> - See if his alibi checks out.<eos> - Will do.<eos> Tony.<eos> That million-dollar question you asked me.<eos> Might just have worked out the answer.<eos> I measured the enzymes in Mia's muscle tissue.<eos> The breakdown products that presented, they prove that she was dead for at least five weeks.<eos> What?
Now, how did he find that out?<eos> Hm?<eos> Well, it's certainly not from her brother.<eos> - That was his big secret.<eos> - Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.<eos> We got lucky.<eos> Tip off the Missing Persons.<eos> Call came from a phone registered to Gary Tovey.<eos> Well done, George.<eos> - Any news?
- It's good for running.<eos> - Is that what you were doing?<eos> - What else would I be doing?<eos> - We'd like to interview you down the station.<eos> I've got to speak to Claire.<eos> You're talking to me first.<eos> My sergeant will drive.<eos> Give me the keys.<eos> How long were you in Afghanistan?<eos> Two-year tour.
It's OK, we've got you.<eos> We've got you, love.<eos> You're safe now, love.<eos> - You still at it?<eos> - Ah, paperwork. Never stops.<eos> We got the fella who killed her. Thought you'd like to know.<eos> How's the other girl?<eos> Shaken.<eos> But she'll be all right.<eos> - Team effort, then.
I'll have them with a little bit of toast.<eos> - That's lovely.<eos> - Why do you wear that hat?<eos> - Eh?<eos> - Do you wear that all the time, like?<eos> - No.<eos> - Maybe it's about time you got a new one.<eos> - See you.<eos> - Yeah, see you, love.<eos> - Not a peep.
Oh my.<eos> Is this for sale?<eos> It's a meditation stone.<eos> You can take it.<eos> It's one less thing to find a place for.<eos> Then you're welcome.<eos> Oh, so you do live here. I know.<eos> I'm sorry that I came home so late last night.<eos> Did you and Courtney get your history presentation ready?<eos> Yeah. About half of it.
And don't forget to tell me what you want to do for your birthday.<eos> What is this?<eos> That's the Merriwick Wish Book.<eos> - How did it get here?<eos> - Well, that's always a bit of a mystery, but this book has been passed down for hundreds of years to every Merriwick girl when she turns a certain age.<eos> You're supposed to write your deepest wish on one of the pages inside.<eos> So this is full of what people my age wrote?<eos> I can't wait to see what they wished for! Yeah.<eos> Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Just a minute.
Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - So, I woke up this morning and I went through all these birthday wishes before I wrote my own.<eos> - You read all the wishes? - Yeah.<eos> And I want to talk to you about what was on your page.<eos> Surprise!<eos> - What are you guys doing here?<eos> - Excuse me, but we're gonna<eos> - need to borrow your daughter.<eos> - Just for the day.
As one Middleton business owner to another: welcome.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Abigail owns a flower shop.<eos> - I'm meeting a salesperson here.<eos> Every time he comes to my store, all he does is look around and tell me everything he'd do differently.<eos> - Neutral territory; that's smart.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Oh, there he is.<eos> - It was nice to meet you.<eos> - You too.
It's my favourite!<eos> And I happen to know that she followed the recipe exactly.<eos> - Gonna eat? - Let's eat.<eos> - Mmm! Thank you for making everything so special.<eos> Except I didn't make the sauce or the cake.<eos> I know. But you knew how much I'd like each.<eos> I know my daughter a little bit.<eos> - Just a little.<eos> - Yeah. Ooh, I, um, I have something for you.<eos> - On your birthday?
I don't see any handles, locks, levers, buttons, counterweights, nothing.<eos> The secret histories are fairly straightforward on how to get to J Street.<eos> Those who can speak the words may open the way.<eos> I don't see any words, but I do see more glyphs.<eos> Well, that's your jam.<eos> No?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Molly drew this.<eos> She is quite the gifted artist.<eos> And meticulous.
Oh, my God!<eos> Gary is a pussy, okay.<eos> - Keep talking, Freddy.<eos> - Jesus!<eos> Am I the only one who thinks there's something off about this job?<eos> The only thing off is Maddie's focus.<eos> We're right on schedule.<eos> I told you, I'll close him tomorrow night.<eos> - Gary...<eos> - Oh, no.
- or she's dead, or...<eos> - Jenny, it's called research.<eos> That's why God invented Facebook.<eos> This guy... she's pulling in.<eos> Looks like salon day for Mrs. J.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's make a plan.<eos> So, question.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Why banking?
- Who knows?<eos> Maybe I'm running from something.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - Mm.<eos> But seriously, don't you get lonely?<eos> Always meeting people and then...<eos> - moving on?<eos> - Sometimes, but just because something's temporary doesn't mean it's not real.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Anything.
I thought he lived in the Middle East.<eos> Ooh, that's funny.<eos> You're funny.<eos> Okay, Jenny, what do you do for a living?<eos> I manage an art gallery in Tucson.<eos> I pick the artists and curate the shows.<eos> Channing, w-what do you do?<eos> - I'm a two-term state senator.<eos> - Whoa!<eos> - What
You're right.<eos> I like... getting to know you.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> You are getting to know me.<eos> But I'm not getting to know you much at all.<eos> Except for the fact that I know you don't like to talk about yourself.<eos> Ask me anything, baby.<eos> - I'm an open book.<eos> - Favorite color?
- Saffron.<eos> Should have known that.<eos> - Birthday?<eos> - October 25th.<eos> Uh-oh. Scorpio.<eos> And right around the corner.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Last one.<eos> Are you attracted to me?<eos> What?
Should have known that.<eos> - Birthday?<eos> - October 25th.<eos> Uh-oh. Scorpio.<eos> And right around the corner.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Last one.<eos> Are you attracted to me?<eos> What?<eos> What?
Oh, well, that's a relief.<eos> But I'm not sure that I'm gonna be able to just be your friend.<eos> Tell me something... if I wait, just a little bit longer, could you maybe see it happening?<eos> Jesus Christ, man.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> What's... what's happening here?<eos> What?
I'm sorry.<eos> No, I-I'm sorry.<eos> Wait.<eos> Gary, hang on a sec.<eos> Uh...<eos> Gary, wait.<eos> Gary!<eos> God...<eos> God damn it.<eos> Oh, my gosh.
No.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm... I'm listening.<eos> Who wrote that book that is there in your... in your... Shit.<eos> In your... In your stomach there?<eos> Henry Miller.<eos> It's the "Tropic of Cancer."<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, read it.<eos> - Out loud?

A loud. Loud.<eos> Okay.<eos> "When I realize that she is gone,<eos> "perhaps gone forever,<eos> "a great void opens up and I feel that I am falling."<eos> That is dead on, son.<eos> When Maddie goes off, when she... when she goes out into the world, a great void... will open up for me, and for her mother.<eos> Um, excuse me.<eos> Sir?<eos> What?

Good deal.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Just as I'm about to reach in and grab the last glazed donut,<eos> Joanna just knocks me out of the way and takes it!<eos> - You're kidding!<eos> - I know.<eos> And so at first, I think, "Oh, I should let her"...<eos> I mean, she could die by, like, lunchtime.<eos> Right.<eos> - Oh, shit.
I... I can assure you, it... it's really not a big deal.<eos> Maddie, you're not doing your job.<eos> It is a big deal.<eos> That's not right.<eos> I... I think that I'm...<eos> Not even a question.<eos> The Doctor sends me when people aren't doing their jobs, and...<eos> I'm here, aren't I?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - So one more time.
No wonder Maddie never comes home.<eos> Hi. Excuse me.<eos> Hi. Can we order?<eos> Thanks.<eos> So I had a shitty, shitty day.<eos> How about you?<eos> How was your day?<eos> Oh, fine.<eos> You know, I clean the other house and then I clean yours.<eos> Two houses better than three.
You saw the way she was looking at me.<eos> - What was I supposed to do?<eos> - What?<eos> Where, in the... in the bathroom?<eos> - How do you even know?<eos> - You just know, man.<eos> You just know.<eos> And no, not in the bathroom, sicko.<eos> They got this little closet<eos> - for their coats.
Well, you're awfully interested in who I'm screwing and when, but you won't talk about it?<eos> - Can I show you the watch lift?<eos> - Tell me. Tell me.<eos> Cece was what, two years ago?<eos> - Was she the last time?<eos> - I've been laid in two years.<eos> - I have!<eos> - Okay. Sure, if you say so.<eos> You guys need anything else?<eos> Some dessert?
Maybe sometimes, you should protect her from herself.<eos> M.K.!<eos> M.K.!<eos> Mom?<eos> Mom?<eos> Mom?<eos> M.K., it's you.<eos> Mom. Mom, what happened?<eos> Everything you've done, I forgive you.<eos> What?
Go on and have a seat.<eos> Edgar, I don't remember the last time I tasted anything this good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> To good food and new friends.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I just wanted to tell you how much I admired Sunny.<eos> He always inspired me and the other guys.<eos> No one would ever accuse him of saying too much, but when he went into action, it was a beautiful thing to behold.<eos> The grace ofis sword strokes, he made killing look so easy.<eos> Well, to Sunny.

I saw my mom.<eos> I held her in my arms as she died.<eos> I killed her.<eos> I killed her, Ava.<eos> The master says those visions can't always be trusted.<eos> Master's wrong.<eos> I could feel it.<eos> I know what I did.<eos> I requested you come alone with no weapons.<eos> Just like the conclave?
Don't you remember me?<eos> Artemis?<eos> It's all over his chest.<eos> Drive faster.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> Come on. Breathe.<eos> Wait.<eos> They've surrounded the house.<eos> We can still make it to the tunnels.<eos> A for effort.
There's an old door, below the waterfall.<eos> They keep it locked but the latch was pretty rusty when I was here.<eos> Shouldn't be too hard to break.<eos> They still eat every night at 6:00?<eos> Yeah. Like clockwork.<eos> All right.<eos> Should give us 30 minutes.<eos> The dinner siren.<eos> We need to hurry.<eos> What?
How was he gonna do that?<eos> He had this compass.<eos> And I had this book.<eos> When we use them together, it would point us in the direction we had to go.<eos> Book and a compass?<eos> If we make it out of this alive, if...<eos> I am gonna kill you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You had it all, didn't you?<eos> A brief, shiny moment.
If we make it out of this alive, if...<eos> I am gonna kill you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You had it all, didn't you?<eos> A brief, shiny moment.<eos> You had everything I always dreamed of.<eos> Yours will be the story all the little cog girls will tell each other.<eos> She was the one who came from the filth of the fields and... And the greasy stench of the kitchen to the velvety heights of the barony.<eos> Only to be pushed from that pinnacle by her own ambition.<eos> Not by my ambition.
I really hope this works.<eos> I saved your life.<eos> Well, I mean, we saved your life.<eos> He helped.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Just appreciating the day.<eos> Funny how much you take for granted.<eos> Well, you'll have some time to rest on the drive.<eos> Bajie says he has a plan to get us into the wall.<eos> What?
This is the end of the line!<eos> You can get off or you'll be carried out in pieces.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> Your move.<eos> Go fetch.<eos> Surround the bus!<eos> Fire!<eos> Get down!<eos> Bajie: Oh, it's over.<eos> What?
Oh.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry, you sweet... Beautiful, clipper.<eos> Hey. What's that?<eos> Why don't you come and have a closer look?<eos> The beauty and mystery of a female voice. Mother.<eos> I know.<eos> You're angry at me about veil.<eos> Well, it was the only way to form an alliance with Quinn.<eos> Well, but the truth, uh, the truth is i also wanted to punish her.<eos> For what?
Why did you leave chau?<eos> I'm not the only one.<eos> All her cogs are fleeing.<eos> They know she can't win this war. Hmm.<eos> I appreciate your candor but betraying a baron doesn't exactly speak of an honest heart.<eos> I want the truth.<eos> Why did you flee?<eos> Chau is desperate.<eos> She's so low on weapons, she's even trading a boy to the river king in the hope he'll resupply her.<eos> -A boy?
What do you expect to find there?<eos> Peace.<eos> Think of Tilda, think of all the lives we could save.<eos> Don't they deserve peace, too?<eos> Anyway, you're free to do as you wish, all I ask is you consider my proposition before your long journey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> New arrivals, refugees from the other territories. I'm ready.<eos> We should reach Quinn's bunker by sunset.<eos> And when the fight's over and Quinn's dead?<eos> What then?
What firepower?<eos> The fertilizer bombs.<eos> From the smell, it's either that or you're raising livestock in here.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Yeah, the plan is to take out as many buses as we can.<eos> It's the easiest way to take out multiple strigoi.<eos> And multiple people.<eos> There's no guarantee of safety in this world.<eos> I understand that, but... you're pushing your luck with that shit.<eos> What luck?
Let's move it! - Over there!<eos> I've got your stuff.<eos> - Let's get out of here.<eos> - One second.<eos> Okay. We can go now.<eos> Is everything all right in there?<eos> - Miranda?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm bleeding.<eos> Oh, shit.
It's okay. We just... we should just think for a minute.<eos> You need to help me, Miranda.<eos> My next exam is in less than a week.<eos> Okay, follow me. Come on.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Come on. - What is this?<eos> I can't take two.<eos> - There's barely room for one!<eos> - You're only taking one.<eos> - For now.
And we've got Faber on our side.<eos> Schmidt gave me a ticket for the 7:50 train.<eos> - You can arrange it?<eos> - It's the only train to Berlin<eos> - this week; We can't miss it.<eos> - I need papers for that border.<eos> Do you still have a copy of your photo?<eos> I'll try and take care of it at work.<eos> Meet me at the station.<eos> Noon sharp.
Sorry.<eos> It was all so sudden.<eos> I needed to think.<eos> And you never came back?<eos> I got drawn into an urgent meeting.<eos> The kind I can't say no to.<eos> I slept at the office... Didn't want to wake you.<eos> What about her?<eos> We'll arrange for a nanny.<eos> Why?
Have you ever seen fireworks?<eos> Still shy.<eos> It's perfectly normal.<eos> isn't she?<eos> Those eyes remind me of yours at that age.<eos> I knew right away she was the one for you. but the truth is I'm not ready<eos> - to be a mother again.<eos> - Don't be silly.<eos> You're an excellent mother.<eos> What about ice cream?
Members of an underground cell.<eos> so be prepared.<eos> Good.<eos> We're going to Obergruppenfuhrer Schmidt's house where I will deliver a traitor. how you could turn your back on our people?<eos> You promised you'd...<eos> Let you go?<eos> Sell your body to the enemy?<eos> all German too?<eos> They consider themselves patriots.<eos> - Patriots?
- Nice.<eos> - Now Goetschl is telling everyone that he knew it... that Heidi was working with the Resistance all along.<eos> and that's why she got scared<eos> - and tried to flee to Spain.<eos> - So we're not exposed.<eos> For now.<eos> Where's Alfred?<eos> He had some things to wrap up.<eos> OK.<eos> What?
Ryan, watch!<eos> Looking good, Michelle.<eos> Who are you?<eos> _<eos> To our newest state senator.<eos> To us.
You start thinking you're untouchable.<eos> Well, if Michelle was taken against her will, we need a motive.<eos> - Money's a good place to start.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> I'll look into the Hmong angle.<eos> Good.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Is Michelle really in danger, or is Senator Vang just an interfering father?<eos> Well, let's ask Michelle.<eos> Problem?
Okay, what is that?<eos> Can you bring it up?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> SGU?<eos> Special Guerilla Unit...<eos> When the war spread beyond Vietnam, the SGU were Hmong recruited by the CIA.<eos> They fought the communists in neighboring Laos.<eos> This goes way back.<eos> He blames the senator for getting him sent to prison and tortured.<eos> What?
The son pays for the sins of the father.<eos> I'll just... um...<eos> You did a good job, Dad.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I shouldn't have gone all NSA on you. I'm sorry.<eos> And I shouldn't have made it "Take your kid to work" day.<eos> But on the bright side, at least I know you're not missing my flute recitals for nothing.<eos> I don't play the flute, Dad.<eos> I knew that.<eos> On three...
Wait.<eos> It's not safe yet.<eos> What have we done?<eos> I know it took courage to be outside with us today, to stand together now in the face of grave danger and grave tragedy.<eos> On the Ark, rain like this was only a dream.<eos> Now it's a nightmare, because we know it could turn at any second and kill us, just like it did to 18 of our brothers and sisters, who we honor today among them, Erin, Samuel, and Louis.<eos> May we meet again. May we meet again.<eos> Too many funerals, too little time.<eos> Show some respect for the dead.<eos> What for?
It means we are living on borrowed time, all of us.<eos> So if you know that, why are you throwing it away?<eos> I'm not. You are.<eos> What is the point in beating yourself up over all of the... the crappy things you've done? You did them!<eos> And... and don't say you had reasons, because at the end of the day, at the end of the world, nobody gives a damn about your reasons, because they are your reasons.<eos> No matter how much you punish yourself, it's not gonna change anything.<eos> It's not gonna bring anyone back.<eos> The way I see it is we can spend our last days wallowing in our reasons or we can do... we can do whatever the hell we want!<eos> Really mean it this time.<eos> Magic beans.
You sure about this?<eos> I'm pretty sure.<eos> In that case, I recommend a tea.<eos> Teatime.<eos> Dance with me.<eos> I don't dance.<eos> I don't really want to dance.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yes!<eos> Good idea.
I don't really want to dance.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yes!<eos> Good idea.<eos> Let someone else save the world for once.<eos> Yeah.<eos> John, enough.<eos> You can't stop this.<eos> No.<eos> No, Emori.
Good idea.<eos> Let someone else save the world for once.<eos> Yeah.<eos> John, enough.<eos> You can't stop this.<eos> No.<eos> No, Emori.<eos> I'm not letting this happen to you.<eos> You have to.<eos> What?
Thank you.<eos> I'm so, so sorry.<eos> He's alive. That's all that matters.<eos> W-What is it?<eos> I know this isn't the right time, but yesterday, the president asked me to look into a highly classified situation.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Okay. - Did you find anything? - I think so.<eos> Um, there was a call made from the White House to kill the report.<eos> And that call came from Aaron's office.<eos> - What?
Interesting.<eos> I got a job offer, too.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> They want you to chair the department.<eos> No.<eos> It was from the president.<eos> The president of what?<eos> The United States.<eos> He wants me to come on as HUD secretary.<eos> What?
I already told Director Foerstel I don't know where she is.<eos> That's not the problem.<eos> We know where she is.<eos> I'm interested in what she knows about Peter MacLeish.<eos> Anyone can get an I.D. like that.<eos> Why the hell should I open the door for you?<eos> Because if you don't, I'll just kick it in.<eos> Yeah, well, convince me. Tell me why I should let you inside.<eos> Catalan.<eos> - What?
- Wells gave me a message.<eos> She told me to ask you about Catalan.<eos> Convinced now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Many on Wall Street are speculating that tomorrow's markets will experience the steepest nosedive since the Flash Crash of 2010.<eos> Investors are turning to assets... that are seen as safer bets in times of uncertainty.<eos> For...<eos> Aaron Shore.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What?
Investors are turning to assets... that are seen as safer bets in times of uncertainty.<eos> For...<eos> Aaron Shore.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> I need to see the president's schedule for the next 72 hours to know what to cancel and what to surrogate.<eos> This is a list of all the Kirkmans' family and friends.<eos> Please call them so they're not hearing things from the TV.<eos> - I'm also going to need... - Emily... - I'm gonna need a word with you, please.<eos> - One second.
And if the president wants answers, I'll give them to one person...<eos> The president himself.<eos> Clear the floor!<eos> I understand you have some things you want to tell me about Peter MacLeish.<eos> Yes, sir. I do.<eos> MacLeish was hiding in a bomb shelter?<eos> Moments before the explosion, there was a 34-second gap in the broadcast feed.<eos> He knew exactly when to leave his seat.<eos> He was involved from the very beginning.<eos> What a monster.
Damn right you did.<eos> What exactly happened there?<eos> I was attacked on the way to the hearing.<eos> I was on my way to meet Speaker Hookstraten at the Rayburn Building.<eos> Someone T-boned my car, tried to strangle me.<eos> I got away, but he took my file.<eos> Luckily, Agent Ritter was able to secure another copy from the agency.<eos> I feel so stupid.<eos> MacLeish fooled everyone, sir.<eos> Not her.
The son of a bitch is gonna pay.<eos> You can't stop him?<eos> The vice president has the authority to schedule his own press conferences.<eos> Hey, what's this about a MacLeish press conference?<eos> The vice president has the authority to schedule<eos> - his own press... - I understand that, but why now?<eos> You'd have to take that up with MacLeish.<eos> Well, I'd like to, but I have a laundry list of action items from POTUS.<eos> - When did you speak to him?<eos> - About an hour ago.
Yeah, well, you'll be out of here soon enough.<eos> No.<eos> I mean now. I can't just sit here.<eos> Tom, you just got shot.<eos> You are lucky to be alive.<eos> Alex, the people that are behind this are still out there.<eos> There's a traitor in the White House.<eos> I am not gonna find them by just sitting here.<eos> O-Okay, Tom, I need to tell you something.<eos> What?
Tom, you just got shot.<eos> You are lucky to be alive.<eos> Alex, the people that are behind this are still out there.<eos> There's a traitor in the White House.<eos> I am not gonna find them by just sitting here.<eos> O-Okay, Tom, I need to tell you something.<eos> What?<eos> Minutes before you got shot,<eos> Emily found out that it was Aaron who made that call to the Pentagon.<eos> What?
Let me begin.<eos> I understand there's some tension between you and Emily.<eos> She's been looking into my phone records.<eos> At my direction.<eos> I also asked her to keep you out of the loop.<eos> May I ask why?<eos> Of course. You...<eos> You deserve an explanation. You're my Chief of Staff.<eos> The truth is, at the request of the Secret Service, I have had to re-vet my entire inner circle.<eos> Because of the bombing.
Shook a lot of hands, broke a champagne bottle on a destroyer's bow.<eos> It was strictly routine.<eos> Yeah, I love you, too.<eos> _<eos> Hey.<eos> I saw your chalk mark.<eos> What's up?<eos> It's Joyner.<eos> He wants to see you.<eos> Why?
_<eos> Hey.<eos> I saw your chalk mark.<eos> What's up?<eos> It's Joyner.<eos> He wants to see you.<eos> Why?<eos> The FBI came to see him today.<eos> Again?<eos> What about?
- Thank you.<eos> I thought I knew how this town worked, but it doesn't make sense anymore.<eos> You know, every... everyone I thought I could count on, everything... It doesn't matter.<eos> The system wins in the end, right?<eos> I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.<eos> Maybe I'm naive.<eos> Maybe I'm both.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Did I ever tell you about how I got my first job at the White House?<eos> Harvard Lampoon connection.
Put your hands on your head.<eos> - Now.<eos> - Run, Cap!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Target is 200 yards out.<eos> The next one counts.<eos> You're not gonna shoot me.<eos> Put your hands on your head.<eos> You got nothing, Wells.<eos> On your knees.
- Now.<eos> - Run, Cap!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Target is 200 yards out.<eos> The next one counts.<eos> You're not gonna shoot me.<eos> Put your hands on your head.<eos> You got nothing, Wells.<eos> On your knees.<eos> On your knees.
Mr. President, I'm sorry, but I don't know who.<eos> As to why, I wondered that myself.<eos> You're not gonna like this, but the best I can figure is that out of all our cabinet members... you were the least qualified to be president.<eos> So, I don't know what the goal of this conspiracy is.<eos> Is it a regime change?<eos> Maybe it's just anarchy. Whatever their philosophy... they probably felt you were the least likely to present an obstacle.<eos> Get me a one-pager on Africom and let the room know that the White House is monitoring the situation in Naruba.<eos> The president is taking this very seriously.<eos> - Uh, Seth, you got a sec?<eos> - Barely.
Greatest show on Earth.<eos> Democracy... the grand experiment.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Russia vetoed the Security Council vote on Naruba.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I'm sure the Joint Chiefs have already emphasized that Naruba is strategically worthless.<eos> People are so damn poor in that country that it doesn't even register on economic reports.<eos> They did.<eos> So it all comes down to people.<eos> Human lives.
How could we not know that we had American citizens working in the country?<eos> They were AMCIT, sir. American citizens who never registered with an embassy.<eos> We had no way of knowing, Mr. President.<eos> Do we know where they are?<eos> If they've been hurt?<eos> No, only that they're being kept among Kalame's convoy so we can't target him or his men.<eos> Same strategy Hezbollah used when they hijacked TWA 847.<eos> Took all the passengers off the plane, spread them all around Beirut, making a counterattack impossible.<eos> - How long till the UAVs are over Naruba?<eos> - Less than an hour, sir.
I'm relying on you to find out.<eos> I need to focus on governing.<eos> I need to lead this country back from this terrible tragedy.<eos> Are you still up for this?<eos> Mr. President, I haven't even gotten started yet.<eos> Good.<eos> This is a Presidential Finding absolving you from all FBI supervision.<eos> Until further notice, you'll be reporting to me.<eos> Agent Ritter will be your liaison.<eos> - And Agent Foerstel?
You know, I like that new title.<eos> We've come a long way since the Hill mailroom, haven't we?<eos> Oh, indeed we have.<eos> So I heard about your resignation.<eos> What happened?<eos> It was all very amicable, believe me.<eos> Congresswoman, this is my cousin Nadia Espinosa.<eos> - A pleasure.<eos> - The pleasure's mine, ma'am.<eos> Impressive CV for someone your age.
And then we don't talk about it for a while.<eos> This was the President's cause, and if it goes down...<eos> Well, what about the vice presidency?<eos> I have no intention of tying myself to a lame duck.<eos> Look, Aaron... I respect your loyalty to the President.<eos> The vice presidency was a conversation, not a blood oath.<eos> And if Kirkman loses... we're gonna have to do our own damage control.<eos> Hey, we have a flag.<eos> Did you know the First Lady was at Dirksen today?<eos> What?
Don't let them get away!<eos> Oh, forget this.<eos> I thought we said 11:00.<eos> It's almost 2:00. Just testing your resolve.<eos> Three whole hours... is that all the truth is worth to you?<eos> Is that what you're gonna give me, the truth?<eos> Tip I gave you on Hannah Wells paid off, didn't it?<eos> All right, what do you got for me now?<eos> Another piece of the puzzle.<eos> Why not the whole thing?
Youngest House in U.S. history.<eos> And I'm old guard, sir.<eos> They don't see me as their legitimate Speaker.<eos> I got here the same way you did... by surviving.<eos> Well, that's not fair or true.<eos> You were elected. You were a serving Congresswoman.<eos> Besides, if they wanted to replace you, they could have done it a while ago.<eos> They were finding their feet.<eos> And now they have their excuse to replace me.<eos> Because of Senator Bowman.
Would you like me to zoom in? Please.<eos> Lozano never left the building that day.<eos> He waited till the coast was clear.<eos> He left the next day.<eos> So, it's true?<eos> Lozano is alive, sir.<eos> And Agent Wells is absolutely positive? Yes, sir.<eos> The man the FBI killed was a decoy and was willing to sacrifice his life to help Lozano escape.<eos> Sacrifice his life for what?<eos> And why?
Well, you must be searching in the dark if you're talking to me.<eos> Well, we're not reading tea leaves, Mr. Lloyd.<eos> Fact is, Browning Reed keeps coming up in connection to our case.<eos> Browning Reed no longer exists.<eos> Uh, yet they still hold titles to properties and munitions.<eos> Liquidating a billion-dollar business takes time, Agent Foerstel.<eos> It's something that someone on a government salary might have trouble understanding.<eos> If you want to talk again, please feel free to contact my attorney.<eos> Charming.<eos> What?
Look... If you're right, i-if he's the guy behind this, it's gonna be just like MacLeish.<eos> Knowing and proving are two very different things.<eos> And Lloyd is 10 times more dangerous.<eos> He is protected in every way...<eos> Physically, financially, legally.<eos> No one is above the law.<eos> Yes, I get that, but it's gonna be very difficult to catch him with dirty hands.<eos> We're gonna have to work our way through his whole organization.<eos> His organization?<eos> What organization?
So far, no known terror organizations match those initials.<eos> We also found a motion sensor with limited-range transmitter attached to it, so whoever's watching this place is within 20 miles.<eos> Nearest town to you is Driggs, population 600.<eos> Yeah, we're headed there next.<eos> What about the silo?<eos> We'll maintain aerial surveillance, and we'll assemble a team to go in.<eos> Not until I give you my word.<eos> We need to seize this ordinance.<eos> Well, we also need to figure out why this is here. Until then, we can't tip our hand.<eos> Foerstel?
Mr. President. Julia.<eos> Emily, come on in.<eos> Any word from Bowman?<eos> Yes, but unfortunately, not what we want to hear.<eos> He said no to Clemens.<eos> Okay, on to plan B.<eos> Plan B?<eos> Julia, the President and I were speaking earlier about a name we haven't brought up, a name we think Bowman would be hard pressed to say no to.<eos> Who?<eos> You.
Emily, come on in.<eos> Any word from Bowman?<eos> Yes, but unfortunately, not what we want to hear.<eos> He said no to Clemens.<eos> Okay, on to plan B.<eos> Plan B?<eos> Julia, the President and I were speaking earlier about a name we haven't brought up, a name we think Bowman would be hard pressed to say no to.<eos> Who?<eos> You.<eos> What?
We got to get back to that property.<eos> Come in.<eos> Am I interrupting?<eos> No, no, please.<eos> Tom. I need to tell you something.<eos> What is it?<eos> I can't be your ninth judge.<eos> Okay, why not?<eos> The fact is I have earlyonset dementia.<eos> What?
- Aw, come on.<eos> - This is... this is paranoid.<eos> Are you kidding me? Really?<eos> Nice try, Seth. Great.<eos> Just back off.<eos> In what is being called a master political stroke... a shortcut around the expected party battles and culture wars.<eos> The Court's most urgent cases can now be dealt with.<eos> The country will likely have to wait until the next election for a Chief Justice, but in the meantime, President Kirkman has fulfilled his promise to restore the nation's highest court.<eos> To you.<eos> To the Court.
You're interested in Nestor Lozano.<eos> So are we.<eos> Who is this?<eos> A friend.<eos> Yeah, I don't have any friends.<eos> The same friend who sent you that link about Hannah Wells and Speaker Hookstraten.<eos> Okay. You got my attention.<eos> In front of the Roosevelt Island footbridge, one hour.<eos> Whoa, hold on, pal. - Listen...<eos> - One hour.
With Leo and Penny up in Camp David, well, it's nice to have young people in the White House again.<eos> It's great to see you sharing your passion for music with these students.<eos> Oh, well, I can't take credit.<eos> This group is actually part of a national program that funds the arts in public schools.<eos> Oh, that's wonderful.<eos> And, unfortunately, it, um, might all come to an end.<eos> You see, when the funding was approved,<eos> Congress put in a sunset clause, so the grant has to be renewed every five years.<eos> - When's it expire?<eos> - Next month.
Got you covered there.<eos> Good.<eos> One less thing for me to worry about.<eos> The one unknown to me is Aruna Mahajan.<eos> The first British Indian prime minister in U.K. history.<eos> Fiercely independent but was able to forge a coalition and under extremely turbulent conditions.<eos> Well, we have something in common.<eos> True enough.<eos> I can work with that.<eos> What?
Don't lose faith in me.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm always on your side, right?<eos> Okay?<eos> Got it. Thanks.<eos> I think we found 'em. Where?<eos> Port of Baltimore.<eos> They just received a call from an unscheduled freighter looking to unload cargo.<eos> Location works out. When it's estimated to arrive?<eos> Less than an hour.
Madame... I do hope you join us.<eos> Because I believe wherever France goes, NATO will follow.<eos> I hope we can discuss this more fully at the next summit.<eos> I would like nothing more.<eos> We got the son of a bitch.<eos> Where is he?<eos> The West Wing.<eos> Okay, our guy's on the move.<eos> Go straight and take a right.<eos> How much farther?
Where am I going, Chuck?<eos> No, no, no, no. Come on. Come on.<eos> What happened?<eos> Our guy. He cloned his digital fingerprint.<eos> Hey. Poor guy.<eos> Not quite the trip he expected.<eos> Not quite the trip anyone expected.<eos> True enough.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What for?
All clear!<eos> All clear, sir.<eos> - What about this one?<eos> It's welded shut, sir.<eos> Well, blow it.<eos> Yeah, we're set here.<eos> We're all set here.<eos> Let's go! Fire in the hole! Cover!<eos> - Door's open.<eos> On the ground right now!
That wasn't her.<eos> No.<eos> She said things.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, that...<eos> That wasn't her, okay?<eos> That was me.<eos> I said those things.<eos> That...<eos> What?
That was me.<eos> I said those things.<eos> That...<eos> What?<eos> That was you?<eos> Talking through my mother the whole time?<eos> It was the only way to get you to bounce.<eos> Kirsten.<eos> Arrest them all.<eos> What?
I am surprised to see you back on your feet so quickly, Miss Clark.<eos> My sister helped me.<eos> Ah! The sister you're a fool for trusting.<eos> - That sister?<eos> - Where's my team?<eos> Your small, erratic team of warrior-scientist friends are being detained.<eos> - Pending relocation.<eos> - Relocation?<eos> What's that code for?<eos> Execution?
I lent Linus my smart-watch.<eos> He still has it.<eos> This is gonna be harder than I wanted.<eos> That's an NSA facility.<eos> Biometrics, photo ID.<eos> - It's impossible. - Mmm.<eos> Well, that's what people say about hacking into the memories of the dead.<eos> No, that sounds reasonable.<eos> You know how I'm gonna get them out of there?<eos> Through the front door.
Tell Commander Dublin, I say hello.<eos> Will do, sir.<eos> Sorry to bother you.<eos> Sorry for the delay, Commander.<eos> - Director Blair sends his regards.<eos> - That's so Director Blair.<eos> Place your right hand on the scanner, please.<eos> Commander, may I see your credentia one more time?<eos> When was the last time you had this scanner cleaned?<eos> Hmm?
Sidearm. Now.<eos> Blair!<eos> Tell me, or I will shoot her.<eos> Kirsten, don't tell this ass-hat anything.<eos> Blair, take it easy.<eos> I would stop moving, right now, Detective, if I were you.<eos> Mitchell, I know you're upset, but you don't have to do this.<eos> What did you see?<eos> I saw my father kill your son.<eos> What?
My actions... don't officially exist, any more than you do.<eos> We're just blacked out lines in some government report.<eos> How can you work with Keaton after what he did to me?<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> Yeah, he just lectured me about not having a choice<eos> - when he tortured me. - I don't like it, either.<eos> And for the record, I almost snapped his neck when I found out.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?
Is that how you get out?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Fight or flight is a natural instinct, but you can't do either of them in that cell.<eos> Try again.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I can feel that room, but... I ca... I can't.<eos> It's... it's too dark.<eos> Kill the lights.<eos> What you got?<eos> Another coin?
How'd it go with the girl at the bar last night?<eos> The girl at the bar has a name, Zapata.<eos> Does she?<eos> What is the girl at the bar's name, Reade?<eos> Leave me alone, I don't...<eos> Just mind your business, all right?<eos> What do we got?<eos> Roman solved a tattoo.<eos> Well, that's not entirely true.<eos> - Which one?

He knew we were wearing vests, right?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> I hit them in the vest.<eos> Those vests have seams.<eos> What if you got them between the plates, - or if you missed?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> And if I hesitated any longer,<eos> Abel would have shot them in the head right after he shot you and me.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Cheers.
It's military academy.<eos> Don't get too excited.<eos> I'm hardly in it.<eos> You're right here.<eos> I could have gone pro.<eos> It was the District Finals.<eos> Two seconds left in that game.<eos> I wish I could tell you that I made that shot.<eos> Weller...<eos> What?
The cops are here!<eos> Like, not the campus cops, the real cops!<eos> Oh, God... they've entered the building.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Now!<eos> - Just give me a minute.<eos> - We don't have one.<eos> Let's go, guys, come on.<eos> Agh!<eos> Uhh!
Oh, God.<eos> Well, you did it.<eos> Officers, you caught us.<eos> A bunch of dumb college kids just trespassing on campus as dumb college kids are wont to do.<eos> Now, you could take us down to the station, I get that.<eos> Fill out all that boring paperwork, but for what?<eos> I mean, it's a silly misdemeanor.<eos> So why don't we just chalk this up we just being out here...<eos> Agh!<eos> Uhh!

Well, we need to get in that building.<eos> Find out who Riley's conspiring with and when the attack's gonna happen.<eos> Good luck... groups a lot scarier than the F.B.I.<eos> have tried that and failed miserably.<eos> Why go in as F.B.I. when we got two card-carrying members right here?<eos> - That's a good point.<eos> - Me go with Rich?<eos> Uh, no, just give me the death penalty.<eos> Oh, my God, how many times do I have to say I'm sorry?<eos> Once!
You take Tasha.<eos> Which one's Tasha?<eos> That one.<eos> No offense, but I don't think anyone's gonna buy Suzy-Frowns-A-Lot as my plus one.<eos> And, really, there's only one person in the whole F.B.I. that can maybe pass as my date.<eos> Jane's busy.<eos> You're not talking about Jane.<eos> See, this is trust. This is friendship.<eos> Equal footing.<eos> Ahh.
Mmm!<eos> No!<eos> No, Gord Enver is not welcome here.<eos> Phineas Gilmartin!<eos> How dare you come back here after what you did?<eos> - Oh...<eos> - Under no conditions is this man to enter this building.<eos> Phineas, you're not still mad about that?<eos> - Good-bye, Gord.<eos> - Phinny!
He's with me.<eos> - Thad Munson.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You're a sight for sore eyes.<eos> Ah, it's good to see you, pal.<eos> Oh, stop it.<eos> My, who's your friend?<eos> I would like to introduce you to Kurt...<eos> Enver.<eos> My husband.
Phineas is an insurance lobbyist going through a bad divorce.<eos> And Thad's a Wall Street guy known as The Vampire.<eos> Buys struggling companies and sucks out every last penny.<eos> Yeah, he just did it to a pharmaceutical company.<eos> He raised their cancer drug prices by over 1,000%.<eos> This guy definitely needs to be locked up, but probably not for a terrorist attack.<eos> This is where we grew up?<eos> 15 Robin Hood Lane.<eos> According to property records, this is where Shepherd lived when she brought you back from South Africa.<eos> Anything?
Rich!<eos> I don't need the origin story.<eos> Right, nobody likes a prequel.<eos> Zachy boy.<eos> Some people never change.<eos> We're ready for that password.<eos> All right, it should be displayed on that fob.<eos> Damn, front shirt pocket.<eos> Hardest pocket to pick.<eos> Okay, well, what if...
Oh, dear mother of God.<eos> She called you?<eos> They sound like they've been drinking.<eos> I'm gonna kill them.<eos> I'm in a meeting, so I really don't know... Peter, just tell them to stop.<eos> This needs to stop. Seriously.<eos> I would go there myself with a hatchet, - but I'm in the middle of something here. - Okay.<eos> You didn't say anything to mother about us, about our situation, did you?<eos> To Jackie?<eos> No. Why?
Thank you, Miss Becky.<eos> You turd.<eos> I just wanted to see your home away from home.<eos> It's, uh, well-lit.<eos> Jon told me that your shift ends soon.<eos> Did he, now?<eos> Time for a chat afterwards?<eos> The entire state of Georgia?<eos> Apparently that's unconstitutional, so they banish you from every county in the state except one.<eos> Which one?
"Why isn't she happier?"<eos> "She should be happier."<eos> I know it's been... - it's been hard. - Has it, Tawney?<eos> Has it been a hard day?<eos> Baking cookies and planning your life?<eos> With no... no baby now, holding you back?<eos> I think we both need to get some sleep.<eos> With who?<eos> Sleep with who?<eos> Unbelievable.
You've spoken to Peter.<eos> He told me about a dream you both had, apparently.<eos> Little kids, parents, house with pretty windows, and some bad guys looking to do harm.<eos> Hm. First I've ever heard of a dream police.<eos> - So you didn't have this dream?<eos> - I might have.<eos> But when my head hits the pillow, I, uh, I'm dead to the world.<eos> Wake up, don't remember a thing.<eos> Some people have things that keep them awake at night.<eos> Not me.
He didn't deserve that.<eos> No.<eos> But it's not your fault.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> We all get scared sometimes.<eos> It's what you do when you're under pressure that matters.<eos> Now quit your whining and man up.<eos> Are you ready to lay some pain for these Mujis and make it outta here, man?<eos> That's how we honor Li.<eos> Oorah?
No.<eos> But it's not your fault.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> We all get scared sometimes.<eos> It's what you do when you're under pressure that matters.<eos> Now quit your whining and man up.<eos> Are you ready to lay some pain for these Mujis and make it outta here, man?<eos> That's how we honor Li.<eos> Oorah?<eos> Oorah.
- You mean wear a wire?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> After last night, I doubt that would work.<eos> Do you think Wilkerson and Salter talk?<eos> Sure.<eos> Wouldn't surprise me.<eos> Hey, what do you think?<eos> You think we could get a bug on Salter?<eos> Salter?
Tom and Jerry.<eos> I know. I called the hardware store Sam poteet works.<eos> Turns out this is the fourth shift he's missed in the last two months.<eos> So he's making up a story about a kidnapping to avoid getting fired?<eos> That or he's just tripping. Either way, I still got to follow up.<eos> Okay. Well, we got a binder... With mugshots in it that you can borrow.<eos> Well, when this guy sobers up a little,<eos> Ruby, I need you to run a Colorado license plate number.<eos> Okay. And, uh, any word back on malachi's parole hearing yet?<eos> Not yet.
- On my way.<eos> Lyle had to bust out the back of the locker to get down here.<eos> We must be a half a mile in by now. You want to go back, go back.<eos> I don't need your help shooting him.<eos> Look, Junior, I know you loved Angie, but killing someone is no small thing.<eos> You've done that?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Clint Dundee put his hands all over Angie. I hunted him down and shot him in the heart.<eos> I appreciate you looking after me, but Lyle's dying today.<eos> A little jumpy.
-Sorry, sir, whose status?<eos> -Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.<eos> GREG LESTRADE<eos> NARRATOR:<eos> Rupert Graves plays Detective Inspector Lestrade, Sherlock's police contact at New Scotland Yard.<eos> He's a very believable, slightly weary, like, world weary but leading man policeman.<eos> -We've been consulting him - that's what you're telling me?<eos> Not used him on any proper cases though, have we?<eos> -Well, one or two.<eos> -Or twenty or thirty.
It wasn't my idea.<eos> It was mine.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Special farewell meal for your brother.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Excited, nervous, all at the same time.<eos> Mm.<eos> Bet you're going to miss all this.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Bon appetit.
See, we found a brick of C-4 explosive in your ex-husband's apartment.<eos> And now I'm wondering... maybe all the financial burden, maybe he got into debt, - owed the wrong people.<eos> - No. He hated anything hanging over his head.<eos> Why would he bring explosives home?<eos> I don't know. But I'm gonna find out.<eos> Agent Charles Sewell, Lieutenant Burns.<eos> This is my partner, Detective Wells.<eos> Detective Wells, - nice to meet you.<eos> - Carrie.<eos> Likewise.
Robert Singh, you're under arrest for the murders of Marco Lantini and Ataru Yamato.<eos> Hello, Eliot.<eos> The press needs to know if order has been restored to the gastronomic universe.<eos> How's Giuliana?<eos> Okay, considering the circumstances.<eos> Well, she's not going to keep that mob off her for long.<eos> Price of fame.<eos> Speaking of which...<eos> I have a press conference.<eos> Great work out there.
I've only got a five-pound note. Right.<eos> Well, that'll do, thank you.<eos> They think the world owes them a living, don't they?<eos> What?<eos> Here we are again.<eos> Oh, did you post my card?<eos> Yes, I posted your card.<eos> Was there any change from the five-pound note?<eos> Well, if there was, I'd keep it for going out of my way, wouldn't I?<eos> Unbelievable, innit?
But you've got to be able to talk to her.<eos> Noah tol us all about her.<eos> I've known her for eight years, ma'am. I know this woman.<eos> An my only interest is peaceful resolution, not ying, an sleeping in my be tonight.<eos> So, please, let me help you.<eos> Please.<eos> Hey, Rick. You're gonna want to hear this.<eos> Hey, how are we oing over there, Tara?<eos> Pretty amn goo.<eos> How about you?
Actually, water woul be great.<eos> Will o.<eos> Thanks, Sergeant Lamson.<eos> My name's Bob.<eos> You're still a cop.<eos> No.<eos> No, the real ones are all gone.<eos> amn it.<eos> I'm... I'm okay. I'll be okay.<eos> Me, too.
That's a nice earring.<eos> Opal and gold.<eos> Yeah. That's fancy, right?<eos> So I told Samantha Turner no.<eos> So you choose not to be a character witness for your boss?<eos> Well, I told her I can't, that I hardly know the guy anymore.<eos> Well, that's fair enough, right?<eos> Do you think I'm making a mistake?<eos> I think it sounds like you've made a decision.<eos> Erin:
You did good, punk.<eos> Thanks, dad.<eos> Just get back here.<eos> - Bye. So, I've been going through the list of patients that Oren Mallory gave us.<eos> So far, it doesn't look like any of the women have a connection to Dale Grey Wolf.<eos> It's possible it's a distant relative with a different last name.<eos> Could be an Aunt or an Uncle or...<eos> Never mind.<eos> Release him.<eos> What?
Anything else, like, oh, I don't know, they're a thousand?<eos> Sorry.<eos> They were renovating the conference room at the library, so I told the gals we could have book club here.<eos> Speaking of which, how are we doing on the snacks?<eos> Not well, Brick.<eos> Did you not hear my car got stolen?<eos> Look, if you forgot, just say you forgot.<eos> - See you, Frankie.<eos> - Have a good night, Tina.<eos> Thanks, you too.
-Well, you wouldn't know 'em.<eos> Well, you would.<eos> The usual smackheads. Sorry.<eos> They don't like being called smackheads, but they are.<eos> Your Tommy has got nothing to do with my grandson. All right?<eos> -I were only saying. -You need to get that idea right out of your head.<eos> -Right. -Right.<eos> Why don't we draw straws?<eos> Because I'm not doing it, that's why not.<eos> Why not?
[Both laugh]<eos> I'm Peggy.<eos> Donald.<eos> Hi, Donald.<eos> Good to meet you.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Woman:<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Large diet coke, please.<eos> Anything else, Ma'am?
More like that nigga sucks.<eos> - [Laughs] - Hey, man, no, man.<eos> He went triple plastic 'cause the first song was slow and everybody's...<eos> Man, we ain't gonna have nothing popping off if we don't have a sound system.<eos> You talk to your moms?<eos> She feel like the garden over.<eos> She ain't trying to put no more paper in it, man.<eos> We'd have a system if I ain't had to sell mine for child support.<eos> Hey, who'd you sell it to?<eos> Pussy-ass, suburban-ass Greg, man.
Have you been beaten up by any guys like that?<eos> All the time.<eos> But we actually just got our own.<eos> See, Alfred?<eos> I told you a foosball table was a better investment than strippers.<eos> You were right.<eos> Plus, we got to meet that hot cougar lady, Bonnie.<eos> Okay, well, I'm Ben and this is Tucker.<eos> We were just hoping to have some beers and play some foosball.<eos> Oh, sorry, guys.
Mama's here.<eos> Everything's going to be okay.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Toni betrayed me.<eos> I got to get out of here.<eos> What? Wait. Where are you going?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm home, and it feels like I'm on another planet.<eos> - I don't trust anybody.<eos> - No one?
What? No hugs?<eos> He was really looking forward to it.<eos> I've cross-checked the writing from the lab with the new images you've given me.<eos> Mostly the same, but the code breakers haven't found anything ...<eos> That's not why I'm here.<eos> The bulletproof assassin you encountered on the sting? We know who he is.<eos> - You want me to go down there, don't you?<eos> - You're the only one who can.<eos> Is this really what it takes for you and I to get a one-on-one these days?<eos> Why now?
Copy that.<eos> There's an inertial confinement laser barrier down there, Which is cool.<eos> Now this button turns it soundproof.<eos> This button makes it opaque.<eos> Just tell me there isn't an "off" button I can accidentally hit.<eos> You'll be safe.<eos> I promise.<eos> Aren't you a sight for sore eyes.<eos> I told Coulson weeks ago that I was willing to speak to you ... to give you intelligence.<eos> Why now?
- Not that wisely.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Delta-3-6-5-Sierra-Victor...<eos> - Niner.<eos> If it's not in here, there's nothing I can do. Exit to the left, please.<eos> - Gatehouse.<eos> - This is General Talbot.<eos> Why has General Jones and his government escort been delayed at the gate, soldier?<eos> - Wave them through.<eos> - Uh, sir. Sorry, sir.
You know what?<eos> You shut your fat face!<eos> George, Lavon?<eos> Help!<eos> Guys, guys!<eos> Come on, come on, stop!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Look, Big Tom's right.<eos> You-you can't just call dibs on someone.<eos> Well, why not?
Congratulations!<eos> What?<eos> I'm not pregnant!<eos> I have a virus!<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> I saw your test results.<eos> Uh, I promise you I am not.<eos> Henry and I haven't even had sex yet, okay?<eos> What?<eos> Why?
Hmm. I don't know.<eos> I mean, he does seem to moan more when he sits down.<eos> And last week, he increased my allowance so I would tie his shoes.<eos> [Inhales sharply] I beat him for the first time in basketball the other day, and, uh, it felt so good.<eos> But then I beat him two more times, and it didn't feel as good.<eos> Do you think that's weird?<eos> I know you don't pay that much attention to me, but I'm not really a sports person.<eos> [Scoffs] It's not just a sports thing, Brick.<eos> I-I'm not supposed to beat dad at anything.<eos> Why?
Want a cheeseburger?<eos> God, that's good.<eos> So what'd she say?<eos> Who?<eos> Patti.<eos> What'd she say before she killed herself?<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> - I can't help if you don't tell me.<eos> - You've helped me enough, Matt.<eos> Not you. Them.
Fine.<eos> Let's see what Patti says.<eos> Uh, I think she's playing possum.<eos> You playin' possum, gorgeous?<eos> Well, maybe you hit her a little too hard, huh?<eos> Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?<eos> What happened last night?<eos> What?<eos> I need you to tell me everything that... that happened last night.<eos> Why?
When they steal, must they not be whipped?<eos> And when they fail to uphold their promise to God and choose, instead, to take league with the devil, must they not then be judged by their decision?<eos> Thank you, Reverend.<eos> I believe the board is ready to vote.<eos> Captain Alden has been accused of the practice of witchcraft.<eos> The good Reverend has graciously agreed to allow the board to decide whether he should go to trial.<eos> So, those who believe that Captain Alden should be tried as a witch?<eos> Six for trial.<eos> And those who believe that Captain Alden's distinguished character renders such accusations baseless?<eos> Five for dismissal.
Yes, and if not, what then?<eos> Then it may be time to tell her the rest of the story.<eos> I'm afraid that time has already come.<eos> Your story is really quite fantastic.<eos> Mary Sibley attacked by mercy Lewis.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And out of loyalty to Mary, you followed the girl into the woods.<eos> Loyalty to Mary?<eos> - No, sir. Loyalty to you.<eos> - Me?
I rem... I remember pipes.<eos> Oh, I'm sure you do.<eos> [Chuckling] No, man.<eos> No, not... no.<eos> Construction pipes.<eos> Like, he had construction pipes lying on my property.<eos> Did you say something about it to Harcourt?<eos> Uh, no, but I wrote him a note, and I told him I didn't think it was cool, and then I put it on the windshield of his Ferrari.<eos> And I suppose you made a copy.<eos> Sorry, no.
I'm coming.<eos> I'm coming. Hello-oh, Zacky, my...<eos> Sarah and Len will be in in a minute.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, my baby, gorgeous, ever.<eos> - Hi. Hello.<eos> Go, go, go, go, go. Wha... what? Who changed the standing order?<eos> Ali got tofu schmear.<eos> Why'd Ali get tofu schmear?<eos> What about the lox spread?<eos> What about the veggie?
Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now get out.<eos> I just need the supplemental arrest report on Max St. Vincent.<eos> Are you flipping kidding me?<eos> - What?<eos> - Of course you're not.<eos> Lucinda teaches you this when you start working for her, right?<eos> That the rest of us only exist to serve the DA's office?<eos> DA's office?
It's me. Don't worry. It's a new phone.<eos> I know, but I just wanted to tell you we're taking care of it.<eos> They didn't want to at first, but I got them to come around.<eos> We're gonna protect you.<eos> Sam?<eos> I'll be out in a minute.<eos> - Have you eaten yet?<eos> How about that Indian place?<eos> They take forever to deliver, but I'll pick it up if you want to call.<eos> Annie?
Okay.<eos> But tonight, I do you.<eos> Sam?<eos> In here.<eos> What's this all about?<eos> We are celebrating your win, which, let me just say... You predicted. I know.<eos> Here. Sit.<eos> I'm gonna head to the cellar and get us a bottle.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Annie?
Why don't we take a black break and go get some white yogurt?<eos> - Yeah! - Yeah!<eos> Hey, hey! Hold on, hold on. Slow your roll, you two.<eos> From here on out, I'm gonna need you two to describe people using keeping-it-real identifications.<eos> "The assailant was a hispanic male between the ages of 10 and 60".<eos> See?<eos> Now I know who I'm looking for.<eos> Mommy, daddy's scaring me.<eos> Me too, baby.<eos> Me too.
Why can't I?<eos> Excuse me... sidekick?<eos> Hey, it's working for Yogi and Boo Boo. Whoa.<eos> Peter is much more than a sidekick.<eos> Dude, he is obviously talking about you.<eos> Well, he was looking at you.<eos> Was I?<eos> Bye.<eos> What says Swatello?<eos> Swatello...
What do I owe you?<eos> Your money's no good here.<eos> You know that.<eos> OK.<eos> Business is good?<eos> It's great.<eos> We're closing.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
He said he had therapy on Wednesdays.<eos> You know, okay, when we do this raid, if he's in there, he'll be charged with being in an illegal gaming house.<eos> He can serve up to two years.<eos> You're gonna arrest him?<eos> Traci, you're not responsible for this guy.<eos> You're responsible for Leo and yourself.<eos> Okay?<eos> That's it.<eos> And as soon as this raid happens... okay? ... which it will, eventually, he won't have a case against you.<eos> Unbelievable.
Elena Aguilar... In the flesh.<eos> Hi.<eos> I spent the last 20 years waiting for this day.<eos> And I got to say... It was worth it.<eos> You look... great.<eos> You don't look so bad yourself.<eos> Yeah, well, don't say that too loud.<eos> There's a lot of lonely guys in here that would like to date me.<eos> Ah, I missed that sound.<eos> Me too.
If anyone ever tries to tell you different...<eos> -I was thinking.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> Maybe we should tell my granny that you're not off your head on drugs and that you are my dad.<eos> Thing is, you-you know I said I'm in trouble?<eos> And it's not my fault, I didn't start it.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Well, she's a police officer, isn't she?<eos> And, if they know where I am, they'll come and get me and put me in prison.<eos> Why?
-Well, she's a police officer, isn't she?<eos> And, if they know where I am, they'll come and get me and put me in prison.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, I told you I done stuff.<eos> -So you can't tell her anything.<eos> -But if it wasn't your fault...<eos> They'd never believe me. Never.<eos> They... They never do.<eos> So promise me you won't say owt, even to her.<eos> Especially to her.
Not tonight.<eos> I think you've already had plenty.<eos> Are you fucking serious?<eos> I got two cops in there, you know, if you want to go in and talk about it with them.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Come on in. Hey.<eos> You want a drink?<eos> No. I can't stay long.<eos> I just wanted to see how you were doing.<eos> Me?
Can you control YOUR antibodies?<eos> Ross, stay calm, we're going to get you out of this.<eos> Ross, swallow that!<eos> What is it?<eos> Trust me.<eos> Now what?<eos> ROSS!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What's it doing?<eos> The hoovering.
Is THAT what we've learned?<eos> Journey, what the hell's happening?<eos> That thing's set the Daleks on us.<eos> 'and it's locked us out of our defences.'<eos> Journey, you're the Aristotle's only hope.<eos> 'I need you to destroy that Dalek.'<eos> The rebels will be exterminated!<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> Understood, Uncle.<eos> Yeah. Me too.
If anything happens, you will be the first to know.<eos> Hey, Joan. I need you at the INP Awards dinner tonight.<eos> They're giving Senator Pierson a lifetime achievement award.<eos> Annie and Auggie just brought me compelling intel about who may have leaked the Chicago facility.<eos> I need to monitor that Op.<eos> Monitor it from the event.<eos> I need you there.<eos> All due respect... there's a chance more sensitive material's at play.<eos> I get that, but Pierson's considering outsourcing operations for all our domestic facilities.<eos> To whom?
Got it.<eos> Pictures of missing girls keep pouring in, and none of them matches up with Alice.<eos> Here's a promising e-mail.<eos> It's from a youth shelter in Henderson, Nevada.<eos> It's just outside Las Vegas.<eos> The director says she'll talk to us anytime we want.<eos> Vegas is on the way to I.A. From St. Louis.<eos> And let's not forget that Thad-io here attends I.V.U.<eos> She's thinner in the photo you sent me, but I recognized jessie right away.<eos> Jessie?
Oh, look!<eos> We're at the castle!<eos> Oh, let's take a family photo for the Christmas card.<eos> Why are not walking?<eos> ! Excuse me.<eos> Could you take a picture for us?<eos> Just press the silver button.<eos> It sticks a little, so you're gonna have to hold it down.<eos> Okay. We'll do one smiling and then a goofy one.<eos> Why?
Because... because it's our family's money that's being laundered.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Did you really think that a flooring business supported our lifestyle... Your education?<eos> Grow up, Silvie!<eos> Where does the money come from, then?<eos> Drugs, extortion, worse?<eos> !<eos> Look, it's your father's business.<eos> He and the boys provide, and it is not our place to ask questions!<eos> Why? !
Something always gets through.<eos> We're gonna need every National Guard unit in the Northeast.<eos> Eldritch.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Preventing you from making a grave mistake, Maggie.<eos> Where is Mr. Fitzwilliam?<eos> On leave.<eos> This is a colleague of mine, Thomas Eichhorst.<eos> Secretary Pierson, Everett Barnes, with the CDC.<eos> A pleasure.
You know why we're doing this, right? Yeah.<eos> Since the beginning of creation, boys have hunted beside their fathers.<eos> - This is no different.<eos> - This is very different.<eos> We're fighting to protect each other.<eos> And we're gonna get through this.<eos> And we're gonna win.<eos> Remember, he will use whatever advantage he can against us.<eos> Whatever you see, whatever you hear, do not stop until the Master is defeated.<eos> Ready?
If we wake them, we'll have to feed them.<eos> I don't think you'd enjoy that.<eos> An ancient truce has been broken.<eos> An act of war has been declared.<eos> We need a human soldier who can move freely in the daylight, someone who can use the power of the sun to massacre the unclean.<eos> You know what it sounds like to me?<eos> Sounds like you got a vampire turf war going on.<eos> You have proven yourself capable.<eos> Well, why should I help them?<eos> Or you?
I can't wait to see the apartment that gets you.<eos> What's this?<eos> That's a check.<eos> That's a big check.<eos> That's a "put on your cheerleader uniform" check.<eos> I would so whip out my pom-poms right now if Cristela didn't have me in such a bad mood.<eos> You're ruining my life.<eos> So, did Chuck say why he cut the check today?<eos> All he asked was that I tell my lawyer to back off.<eos> Lawyer?
Well, you gotta feed the beast, Miles.<eos> I might have turned a blind eye to the small stuff, but if you think I'm gonna help you get gear in here, you're deluded.<eos> Keep it in your pants, ladies!<eos> Hello!<eos> I'm so fuckin' horny.<eos> Calm down, you fellas.<eos> Anderson.<eos> Catch you after class.<eos> Just Anderson, Jenkins.<eos> Oh, why?
No.<eos> You want one?<eos> What?<eos> Hold on a sec.<eos> I think I'm gonna kick your ass.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Is that a good idea?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Oh, you don't?<eos> Why not?
What a gig.<eos> Yeah, it's fucking miserable. But, you know, I got to have a job.<eos> So I have no choice.<eos> You got a job, dude. You're a fighter. This isn't your job.<eos> My parole officer put me in this, and I'm there all day, so...<eos> What's your parole officer's name? - Dantzler.<eos> - Dantzler.<eos> All right, I'm gonna talk to Dantzler. I'll get you squared away.<eos> In the meantime, do you need anything else?<eos> You okay in here?
Let me just get one more whiff. Don't fight.<eos> - You're an idiot.<eos> - Ugh. See you later.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Feel better.<eos> - Have a great day, Nate.<eos> I'm sorry about last night.<eos> You were wasted.<eos> Haven't seen you like that in a long time.<eos> I think it's just gonna take me a minute to get used to having Ryan here.<eos> Me, too.
(Phone ringing)<eos> - Give me that!<eos> James!<eos> James, hi.<eos> Yeah, how are you?<eos> Well, no, we just got your note.<eos> That's right.<eos> (Scoffing)<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Why?
Balls, yes!<eos> A bestie festie like the old days.<eos> Awesome.<eos> We're regressing to tweens before we go to college.<eos> - I love it.<eos> - Hey, Matty!<eos> Eva's so pretty and walks like she's on a cloud.<eos> More like sailing on a shit storm.<eos> - Jenna.<eos> - Hey, you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.<eos> I'd love to!<eos> Hey, you've been my friend, my support system and my confidant.<eos> There's no one I trust more than you.<eos> You're not just my best man.<eos> You're my best friend.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Not what I was expecting to hear.<eos> You really love that blanket that much?<eos> Yeah. Why?
I'm not lonely.<eos> I know, but what are you going to call him?<eos> What about Brutus?<eos> No, look, be serious now.<eos> It'll need walking, feeding.<eos> I wanted to give you something.<eos> I won't be able to see you as often as I used.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know how hard it will be for me, but...<eos> Darling?
Man who knows own mind.<eos> Few and far between.<eos> Hold on to him!<eos> I think my mother had something similar.<eos> Your mother?<eos> Do you remember that dress she made for you for the Christmas ball?<eos> Red flannelette.<eos> And that boy asked whether you'd liked to dance or be put to bed.<eos> Why do you always have to make me feel so small?<eos> - So sorry.
They'd be dead if it weren't for you, that's a fact.<eos> Bloody hell, Vic!<eos> Next you'll be telling us the boy can walk on water!<eos> - Here he is, our hero.<eos> - Running into burning buildings.<eos> Damsels in distress?<eos> I hope you gave him a thorough telling off, Mrs. Maguire.<eos> Don't worry, she did.<eos> Miss Headingly's been praising you to the heavens.<eos> Me?
I repeat, a Code Black.<eos> I'm escorting Slater to medical.<eos> This is your last chance to tell me something that vaguely resembles the truth. I told you, I didn't see who hit me.<eos> You told Mr Jackson that Slater was sick, which leads me to believe that, at the very least, you knew an attack was imminent.<eos> No, Simmo said she was feeling unwell, so I went to get her from the shower block. Mr Jackson.<eos> Take Smith back to H4. You and I will speak later.<eos> What's going on? Franky is starving me.<eos> She won't let me eat, thanks to you.<eos> Oh, punishment? Yeah.<eos> Oh, sorry.
Right.<eos> Hey, about Sharee, I just...<eos> I feel like if you gave her another shot, she would nail that test.<eos> Why are we talking about this again?<eos> Because I thought it was unresolved.<eos> Nope.<eos> It was quite resolved.<eos> - You just thought if we did this, that I'd change my rules.<eos> No, I just still think that you're being a little hard on her.<eos> Unbelievable.
Can anything be done if you have one?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Can you manage it,<eos> - or, like, try to prevent it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Are they only in your brain or can you get them somewhere else,<eos> - like a blood clot?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> - I haven't seen a doctor.<eos> - Well, why not?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _ _<eos> _<eos> It was just me and my sister Marina against him.<eos> He did that with a barlow knife.<eos> Why?
Sorry to interrupt.<eos> No problem.<eos> We're done here anyway.<eos> Great.<eos> Tox screen came back clean, Ryan.<eos> There are no drugs in your system.<eos> You're under arrest for murder.<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> I was thinking that I didn't know what the hell happened to my husband.<eos> My... ex-husband.
-The city as it is?<eos> As you wish it to be. Hmm.<eos> Extend the boardwalk south to Jackson, raise it above the surge line.<eos> Pave Atlantic Avenue, lay down trolley tracks.<eos> Coloreds stay here, north of Arctic.<eos> I bear them no ill sentiment, but the races were not meant to comingle.<eos> Trains and ferries.<eos> Trains and ferries, this town dies without them.<eos> Get the capital in, but don't spend your own money.<eos> Why?
- Anybody see Mueller?<eos> -Where's Mueller? - Find fucking Mueller.<eos> ELI: (MUFFLED) Nucky.<eos> Nucky.<eos> We did a bad thing.<eos> I'd put my pants on in a hurry if I were you.<eos> Do you have any money?<eos> No.<eos> If you pay him, he lets you go.<eos> But why?
Good day, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> This is Robert Hodge,<eos> United States Attorney for the Southern District, speaking to you here in New York City.<eos> My fellow citizens, we are at war.<eos> Not against a foreign potentate.
Benson.<eos> That's your guv'nor, isn't it?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - He'll be getting a phone call first thing.<eos> - Outstanding work, Keating.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> Mr. Johnson confessed to killing a Mr. Charlie Rush.<eos> - Confessed to who?<eos> - To him.
What is it?<eos> The night with the jazz singer?<eos> The rich one's impending nuptials?<eos> It's Hildegard.<eos> What is it with you and women?<eos> It's a mess, that's what it is.<eos> They fall at your feet!<eos> Even my Cathy thinks you're a catch!<eos> I should tell her.<eos> Who?
McCOMBS: You really think you're Martin Odum?<eos> There is no Martin Odum.<eos> Everything about him is fake.<eos> EVANS: We all got the same thing.<eos> They did something to us over there, man.<eos> SONYA: I know your name.<eos> It's Martin MacDonald Odum.<eos> I am telling you... don't trust anyone!<eos> Trust no one. Trust nothing. Trust no one.<eos> No one. No one.
You have to save him, Topher, please.<eos> - Quick!<eos> Grab the crash cart!<eos> - Wilson!<eos> Outta the way!<eos> Outta the way!<eos> Coming through!<eos> Come on, guys, let's move it.<eos> Let's give the doctors the room to work.<eos> Out!
This whole thing seems a little silly after seeing that poor kid.<eos> Just don't ever lie to me again.<eos> I'll see you back at your place after the surgery.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I'm not pregnant?<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But your tumor is very treatable, and we're pretty sure that's what's been causing your psychotic states.<eos> Doctor De La Cruz, Ms. Palmer's sister's here.<eos> Jessie?
I should have told you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> Are there any others that I should know about?<eos> Like, people we've worked with?<eos> It would -- it would help me if I -- if I knew. No.<eos> Lorelei?<eos> I always thought that maybe something happened with you two.<eos> Lorelei?
Do I pay you for this?<eos> You weren't on the seventh floor.<eos> - Lunch.<eos> - With who?<eos> What, are you moonlighting as a leash now?<eos> I found out where the photos came from.<eos> The guard, on the boat.<eos> He's not the one texting us, though.<eos> He sold the photos.<eos> To who?
- I mean, anything at all.<eos> - We will.<eos> Uh, may I have some water?<eos> I'll get it for you.<eos> You clocking' that?<eos> Tyler was killed on Tom Burke's street walking Tom Burke's dog looking exactly like Tom Burke from behind.<eos> - Mr. Burke?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm sorry, we can't let you go.<eos> - Why?
You're under arrest for the murder of Jerry Patch.<eos> You were right.<eos> I was too close to this one.<eos> I didn't even consider Ruby as a suspect.<eos> Me neither.<eos> But, Laura, you did it.<eos> You closed the case.<eos> You did just what you promised Jerry.<eos> I just wish I felt better about it.<eos> Me too.
This is the Jameson scandal.<eos> Does anyone even consider a politician cheating on his wife a scandal anymore?<eos> - No.<eos> - Where's the water bottles?<eos> - Affair hasn't even been confirmed. - Oh.<eos> Did you run that spin in cheaty husband camp?<eos> Jameson himself was down at 1 Police Plaza this morning, says he didn't do it.<eos> Oh! Guy says he didn't cheat and you believe him.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Me?
So I currently work for the New York City medical examiner's office.<eos> It holds the largest collection of slightly chilled corpses in the world.<eos> If your game is death, you go where the action is.<eos> The Carlyle Endowment is committed to supporting institutions that share our core values.<eos> Wouldn't you agree, mother?<eos> With you, Conrad?<eos> I don't think it's possible.<eos> Of course.<eos> Will anyone be spared your ire tonight?<eos> Your father.
You got your hour with him? I did.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> Your vital signs are very erratic, senorita.<eos> I have a heart condition. Myocarditis.<eos> I-I lost my nitrate medication.<eos> Very well.<eos> I can get you something.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Gracias.<eos> Annie?
It actually worked for a few weeks.<eos> - Then she stopped sending me notes.<eos> - So you went to her house?<eos> Well, not at first, but after four months, I started to think that she was mad at me, that...<eos> that she might sue me for breach of contract.<eos> That's when I went by.<eos> And found a dead woman in her basement.<eos> Did it dawn on you to call someone?<eos> - I did.<eos> - Who?
- She died unexpectedly two weeks later.<eos> - Was there an autopsy?<eos> Since she was a cancer patient and under a doctor's care, there was no autopsy, and her husband had her cremated the next day.<eos> So the stepfather killed the mom, too?<eos> First, he killed Fran, thought he'd get all the money when his wife died.<eos> But then her remission meant she wasn't dying fast enough, so he felt like he didn't have any choice.<eos> Well, I don't know what you were thinking.<eos> If your stitches had opened up, you could have bled to death before Detective Rizzoli had found you.<eos> - But I didn't.<eos> - By the grace of god.
Maybe not, but it'll prove my point.<eos> Which is...?<eos> Which is if she'd taken Boylston Street like I said, she would have been here 10 minutes ago.<eos> She may not have the letter. [sighs]<eos> I went to see the department doctor a week ago.<eos> I was fine then.<eos> I'm finer now.<eos> It's just taking them too long to clear me for duty.<eos> Okay, look, I know how badly you really want to get back to work, but I must admit that it's been really nice having you here, and I'm sad that you're leaving.<eos> Me too.
"The test sample contained a strong concentration of acetone, uric acid, and ammonia."<eos> - Urine?<eos> - Correct.<eos> So the acetone on his pants isn't from starting a fire.<eos> I can't wait to see the look on the D.A.'s face when I show him this ... that our proof that Rick Sullivan didn't kill his family is that he pissed his pants.<eos> Jason Sullivan?<eos> Sergeant Detective Korsak, Boston homicide.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Did something happen to my wife?<eos> My son?
Uh, I talked to a lot of people who didn't like Rick.<eos> Bartenders, owner of the liquor store, a bunch of people he owed money to.<eos> Any of them look good for the arson?<eos> No, they're all regular people ... working stiffs.<eos> None of them would have set fire to his house.<eos> Still, Jane's right.<eos> Somebody had to have a motive to kill Rick and his family.<eos> I'll recanvass, talk to the neighbors.<eos> Ah, maybe time loosened up a few tongues.<eos> Woman: Sorry, detective.
I was unwell, so I came home.<eos> And it happened here.<eos> - What did?<eos> - A mishap.<eos> But it passed quickly.<eos> No need for the doctor.<eos> Are you talking about the baby?<eos> Too soon for that.<eos> Is the baby all right?<eos> Not a baby.
What else do you want?<eos> A kiss on the cheek?<eos> I- - I got to go.<eos> Whoa!<eos> I wouldn't mind a kiss on the cheek.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Mabel, we've got to talk.<eos> Almost losing my journal made me realize that I'm halfway through the summer and still no closer to figuring out the big mysteries of Gravity Falls.<eos> Gideon almost destroyed the town to get his hands on this journal.<eos> But why?
Exactly.<eos> If we see any of these people next time we track Keller, we'll have his handler.<eos> Not a very discrete location for a gathering.<eos> It's because it's just you and me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Where's Woodford?<eos> He's out of town on business.<eos> With the Panthers? What, like he told me?<eos> But before he left, he gave us marching orders.<eos> Us?
Mozzie had a run-in with Eva's fiance.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> I told you two to stay out of it.<eos> He attacked Mozzie after they met.<eos> - He attacked him?<eos> - Mozzie claims he was beaten.<eos> Mozzie also claims the government uses fluoride to control my mind.<eos> You said you would look into the situation.<eos> Transferred to Seattle?<eos> Why...
You're positive about this?<eos> Neal, this is a precision instrument.<eos> You're amazing, Moz.<eos> I mean, none of this would be possible without you.<eos> - And?<eos> And now that the Panthers are down a mole, it's the perfect time...<eos> No, no.<eos> Woodford just killed his most trusted man.<eos> Keller could have stuck that chip on you.<eos> Or you.
Not only can't your client make a tender offer for 60 days, they can't purchase any more stock until then either.<eos> I'm telling you, we need to negotiate with him.<eos> You mean pay him off? Yes, that's exactly what I mean.<eos> Every day this drags on, it's millions out of your pocket.<eos> Well, from where I'm sitting, all I can see is a lawyer trying to distract me from the fact that this whole thing is his fault.<eos> If I didn't break privilege, he might have locked this whole thing up before you knew what hit you.<eos> Fine.<eos> We'll negotiate.<eos> No, I'll negotiate.<eos> No, not without me.
You're still seeking out klaus' redemption As if that were a thing that was even possible.<eos> Elijah seeks it out.<eos> Even my own mother seeks it out, But i do not believe in redemption.<eos> I believe in right and wrong.<eos> I believe in good and evil.<eos> Maybe in some comic book universe...<eos> You don't even see it, but i'm trying to help People like you.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> That is to your peril because when i'm free I will not stop until every single vampire In new orleans has ceased to exist,<eos> Not even you.
- Wow. - Seriously, that was great.<eos> Not the kiss, the read.<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I feel like the girl who took her top off at the dinner party.<eos> Great job.<eos> Oh, I loved it.<eos> And apparently, so did Andrea Askowitz.<eos> I just got word she wants to meet you.<eos> - Me?
Don't kill him!<eos> We must find out who he serves.<eos> How is he?<eos> Poison of the yellow scorpion.<eos> The healers do not know if he will survive the night.<eos> - How many assassins?<eos> - Three.<eos> Where were his knights?<eos> Many fell this evening, Jingim.<eos> Against three assassins?
Do you advise I send warriors in search of a myth when our true and very real enemy lies in Xiangyang?<eos> I suggest you open your eyes to the possibility... as your father would.<eos> How many of our guards were slain?<eos> Can we afford not to search out such a potent adversary?<eos> We can, blind man...<eos> because the Old Man is dead!<eos> Our demons lie south!<eos> With deference, Prince Jingim... that may not be true.<eos> Who allowed you access to this assembly, Latin?<eos> Jingim.
You were killed by the Hashshashin.<eos> You would let me go?<eos> You are a guest in someone else's home.<eos> You should leave when you wish.<eos> Upon our return, your host may be gone and you would be friendless.<eos> Are we not now friends, Byamba?<eos> I cannot save you in Cambulac.<eos> Would you defy the Khan?<eos> No... but this is my home... and if someone were keeping me from it, I would kill to return.<eos> Jingim!
A scholar- warrior of the highest order... a Song dynasty loyalist...<eos> a hero, Sidao.<eos> Because he was poor... a man of the people.<eos> He is not me.<eos> I shepherded this city, this empire through a time of tumult... and that time has not passed.<eos> The Mongols will return.<eos> If they return, they will settle terms of peace... and negotiate those terms with him.<eos> Welcome... to the fortress... Fang Zhen.<eos> Chancellor.<eos> Empress...
I've got an asset who can get definitive proof who did it, which is why I need you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Shoot.<eos> The asset needs $100,000 to get the information.<eos> Your Agency won't give it to you?<eos> The Agency found out about my heart... and transferred me to a desk.<eos> Langley would go ballistic if they knew I was following this down.<eos> Jesus, Walker.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, me too.

That's a wrap.<eos> Whoo! Hey, thanks man.
They could be buried down there.<eos> I don't know what the hell I did with them.<eos> ----<eos> When were you gonna tell me about this?<eos> What?<eos> Prenup?<eos> I figured it was a given, to be honest, and that we would talk about it, but I sure as heck wasn't planning on it tonight...<eos> Not with all these awards to win and us looking so damn gorgeous.<eos> Found your speeches.<eos> Thanks, babe.
It'll be a crash course in father-daughter bonding.<eos> That is a wonderful offer, and I think Emma will definitely go for it.<eos> Well, she would go for it if she would hear it.<eos> I'm afraid the next time I see her, she's gonna throw me in the hot tub.<eos> - Dad? - Hmm?<eos> Leave it to us.<eos> 110 over 70...<eos> Martin, your blood pressure's perfect.<eos> No lollipop?<eos> Oh. - No, sorry.
Wow. Good for you, Ev.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Hank?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Annie's medical records just came through.<eos> No wonder I couldn't find them before.<eos> I know her as Annie Meadows, but these records are under a different last name.<eos> Perhaps her maiden name?<eos> That's not her maiden name.<eos> Annie?
Off to meet thy maker.<eos> Most agree the soul lingers for some time, very close to where the body lies.<eos> It sees and hears and feels keenly what happens.<eos> I'm glad of that...<eos> Glad you'll suffer through what's still about to happen.<eos> How good of you to train these fine animals to lust for your own blood.<eos> It guarantees you the burial you deserve.<eos> The dogs will eat their fill of you and shit your remains out in the crags.<eos> You did it, and soon, the red death will destroy Salem.<eos> No thanks to you.
Wait! I'll do anything you want! I'll do anything.<eos> So you'll prostitute yourself to save your lover?<eos> Come on then, let's see how much of a slut you really are.<eos> No!<eos> Frank!<eos> I'm not who you think I am.<eos> I'm going to cut your ugly, fat face!<eos> You wouldn't dare.<eos> Back to the circus, and no one will ever know.<eos> Thanks to you.
No, thank you, darling.<eos> - Nice to see you, Martine.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I could ask the same thing of you.<eos> The last time we ran into each other, we were both after the same thing, and we stepped on each others' toes a lot.<eos> As I remember it, I helped you get what you wanted in Venezuela.<eos> You got what you wanted too, and don't think I forgot about your hour with Borz.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I am here trying to procure a half dozen Russian combat helicopters for the D.I.A. from a Russian weapons contact of mine.<eos> Why?
Probably not, so help me stop worrying about it.<eos> Will you reach out to some of your military friends, see what you can find?<eos> Sure.<eos> Give me some time. Okay.<eos> What's next?<eos> Take a look at the NCTC's deposition list.<eos> There were a couple of names I wasn't familiar with.<eos> Michael Oates...<eos> He used to work at Justice, I think.<eos> Okay.
A healthy level of fear all employees should have for their boss.<eos> Those people are my family.<eos> They're your employees, and they'll burn you the first chance they get. Oh, God.<eos> Aren't you just exhausted?<eos> I mean, you exhaust me.<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> No, you know, all the years that you've been my lawyer, through divorces and sexual-harassment suits, you have gotten to know all my crazy, but I still know nothing about you.<eos> Until now, of course.<eos> You don't trust people.<eos> Not your employees, your clients.

The important thing is we know who's responsible.<eos> We just need him to make a statement.<eos> Oh, I'll get him to make a statement.<eos> You weak, little bitch.<eos> - Marren.<eos> - Why? - What?<eos> - Don't play dumb with me.<eos> You set me up for this.<eos> I'm loyal to my boss.<eos> - No one else.
Heads.<eos> We go back for the body.<eos> You were right.<eos> I think Sam killed Lila.<eos> Why are you saying that?<eos> He lied... About everything.<eos> Lila was pregnant, and he knew.<eos> He knew.<eos> You tell anyone?<eos> Just you.
I'm relieved to see you recover so quickly.<eos> All thanks to you.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.<eos> Cook me something tasty.<eos> This time, bean paste stew?<eos> Shall I?<eos> What are you doing next weekend?<eos> This week I'm a bit busy.<eos> Can we make it this weekend?<eos> Why?
Hey, I've been calling you forever.<eos> Yeah, I'm... I'm in with Sid.<eos> Sorry. What's up?<eos> So I met Billy's guy who's really a girl, and she's the real deal, Paul.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Means I want to steal her from Billy.<eos> So do it.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> I'm in a downtown flophouse takin' in the local color.<eos> Why?
You'd be callin' the shots.<eos> You'd be a partner, no hired help bullshit.<eos> - Let me think about it.<eos> All right, I'll meet you at 6:00 with the answer.<eos> Pop noxon's.<eos> You need a new spot.<eos> They put Rosemary on their fries.<eos> Why would I go anywhere else?<eos> Take a cab there.<eos> Why?
(sighs) No. Six months, assistant floor manager at Tuxedo World, Albuquerque, 2007.<eos> No way, come on.<eos> View your tuxedo as an investment, that will guide you through formal events for years to come.<eos> Shall I go on?<eos> Woman:<eos> Name? Carrie Wells, Al Burns.<eos> - (sighs) - Right here.<eos> Great. Please fill out a name tag.<eos> You got a pen?<eos> Uh... sorry.
Dave talked me out of it.<eos> He took my face in his hands... and told me what a loving, wonderful man you are.<eos> And that you deserved a second chance.<eos> So... there's your answer to the little... forensic thing.<eos> What's my answer?<eos> That's what I want to know.<eos> She never spoke with Dave about his business dealings or anything else, for that matter.<eos> I guess he was just a shoulder to cry on.<eos> Eliot, I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, me too.
I got a... an hour, a whole hour, just for you.<eos> I cancelled the Grubman thing.<eos> I just made up some bullshit.<eos> So do you want to tell me what's going on?<eos> I don't know... I'm just... I...<eos> It's, like, riddled with anxiety, lately. It's like... It's kind of like...<eos> Anxious exhaustion. I heard this guy call it that on the radio just, like...<eos> I'm overwhelmed all the time.<eos> You're overwhelmed all the time?<eos> H-how?
There-There's no way he's talking about her, right?<eos> Our Melanie?<eos> That was so long ago.<eos> There's something you should know.<eos> Melanie's alive.<eos> She came back from the dead.<eos> I need you to get me into the dome.<eos> You want me to get you to the dome?<eos> I need to get a message to somebody on the inside.<eos> Who?
You need to see this.<eos> I think it's a playground.<eos> Where?<eos> The Obelisk.<eos> Melanie's alive.<eos> Dale?<eos> Oh, my God, it is you.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> I need to get a message to somebody on the inside.<eos> Who?
Let me show you.<eos> Did you find a signal yet?<eos> No.<eos> But this is where you were when the e-mail came through?<eos> Yeah, right about here.<eos> Well, right about here or right here? You have to know exactly, Joe!<eos> Y-Yeah, right here.<eos> But... the signal's gone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah. Me, too.
For a healthy profit.<eos> But we kept a backdoor as a way to be able to use it ourselves.<eos> - That can't be legal. - No, which is why it was a huge risk for us to send that message.<eos> And the one we're about to send.<eos> Oh. He's not here.<eos> Yes, I am, sir.<eos> Well, Hunter May, meet my son, Dale.<eos> How are you?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - Uh, likewise.
I think it's enough to get us through the night.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, baby. Okay.<eos> We made it.<eos> We madeit, baby. Almost there.<eos> Baby, it's time to wake up now.<eos> Come on, come on, come back for me.<eos> I came back for you;<eos> Come back for me now, come on.<eos> Barbie...?
Do I have to answer these questions again? I've been discharged. I'd like to get to class.<eos> Please, Perry.<eos> Detective Davis is here as a favor to me.<eos> We'll be quick.<eos> Guy in the video... Eric Bates... He says you filmed this on your laptop over a year ago when you two were roommates.<eos> No. No.<eos> He's just claiming that because it's the best story he can come up with to save his ass.<eos> He doesn't want to admit that he showed his little sex tape to all his buddies and then they shared it with the Internet.<eos> You lived together freshman year, and then he moved out in the second semester.<eos> Why?
Well, this is going nowhere.<eos> We should talk to his sponsor.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> Let's split up.<eos> I'll talk to the sponsor.<eos> You call Traci, find out where they're at.<eos> All right.<eos> And I'll let them know where we're at, which is, essentially, nowhere.<eos> Detective?
You don't have to, 'cause I never felt guilty for one second.<eos> You deserved everything you got from me.<eos> Do you hear me on that?<eos> I forgive you, pop.<eos> How sweet.<eos> Just get the hell out of here.<eos> Kelly getting second-degree, it just doesn't seem right.<eos> Well, her lawyer's just gonna argue self-defense.<eos> I'm okay with that.<eos> Me, too.
Not anymore.<eos> He quit. He didn't tell you?<eos> I haven't seen him.<eos> Well I'm sure it's only temporary.<eos> From what I know of Barry, when he sets his mind to something...<eos> No one's gonna talk him out of it.<eos> But the next time he suits up...<eos> Fshh! Runs headlong into danger...<eos> He will fail.<eos> Why?
That's a nice way of looking at it.<eos> Yeah for you, not for me.<eos> I went to space.<eos> I'm covered.<eos> You know what?<eos> This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement.<eos> Let's make a pact.<eos> When one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we'll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.<eos> I love that.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
I don't have time to take you to the station, just wanted to talk.<eos> Oh, certainly.<eos> Thanks anyway.<eos> You have been to the federal police.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Sit down.<eos> Still don't understand the magnitude of all this.<eos> Mengele, Eichmann, and others are protected by powerful friends.<eos> We can't trust anyone.<eos> No one.
(clears his throat) you want to see The only upside of a cocaine binge?<eos> (sighs) You promised to call after the hearing.<eos> You shouldn't come here.<eos> It's not safe for you.<eos> (sighs)<eos> It's done.<eos> Want a beer?<eos> No. (sniffles)<eos> Have you told anyone?<eos> Hank?
I'll have you watched day and night.<eos> Redcoats wanted to send a message.<eos> This is what you get when you fight back against the English.<eos> She came back through the stones?<eos> Aye, she did.<eos> They always do.<eos> I need to leave this place.<eos> You need not be scared of me nor anyone else here as long as I'm with ye.<eos> I'm leaving tomorrow, and I'm taking you with me.<eos> But why me?
Here. One piece.<eos> It's the biggest and the smallest, so it's in order.<eos> That works.<eos> Uh, Sylvester, I don't want to hurry your process... 500,000 kilowatts!<eos> All right!<eos> We need exactly 500,000 kilowatts.<eos> Can you handle that?<eos> Come on. Who rigged our whole office this morning?<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Okay, ready?
The bad guys are getting smarter. And I can't train my agents to think like you do.<eos> I have the full resources of the U.S. government.<eos> I need your help, and I think you and your team need a home.<eos> Here.<eos> "Fixed salaries, cars, research lab"".<eos> You saw this coming.<eos> It was your only logical move.<eos> Okay, lips are parted, leaning slightly forward. You have something to tell us.<eos> He offered us jobs.<eos> Me, too?
We're a team, aren't we?<eos> The waitress just left to bring her son home.<eos> You just missed her.<eos> Come in.<eos> I know it's, uh, late. I just wanted to, um, say thank you for your help today.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You came all the way over here to tell me that?<eos> No, I also wanted to offer you a job.<eos> Government-funded problem solvers.<eos> Uh... why?
But guess what.<eos> I quit.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You don't get to quit.<eos> We don't get to quit in this family.<eos> This family is all we have ever had!<eos> Well, then, we got nothin'.<eos> Would you say that to dad?<eos> Dad?
You know what?<eos> - It's not fair, you know.<eos> I'm emotional.<eos> You're cold. You're loved, And I'm hated.<eos> - Louis, if I was so cold, I wouldn't have come here in the first place.<eos> - Pouring us a drink.<eos> - Cahill took the deal.<eos> - All seven cases are officially dead.<eos> Jessica, I'm sorry that I didn't come clean with you before.<eos> - Me too.
No, your-your heart's acting like a pump.<eos> It's starting to work.<eos> Is he gonna make it?<eos> Please. Don't let him die.<eos> He's gonna be okay.<eos> Hey. Where are you?<eos> Sorry, man. I-I got busy.<eos> Well, hurry your ass up.<eos> I'm four bourbons in.<eos> Five in.
I had no intention...<eos> No, it's fine. I get it.<eos> The guy was talking shit about your wife.<eos> I can't believe I hit you.<eos> Seriously, it's the best thing that's happened to me all week.<eos> You think Nighthorse is right?<eos> You think I'm trying to rail road him?<eos> I don't know, and the phone call seemed pretty legit.<eos> What time is it?<eos> Why?
Ohhh. And this one... he catches Nancy off guard, she slips, throws her back out.<eos> Larry thinks a flash mob is gonna get his wife back.<eos> Nope.<eos> This is just another indication that he doesn't listen to Nancy or care about what she wants.<eos> I'm gonna be stuck with him forever.<eos> I feel sick.<eos> Charlie!<eos> Find Larry.<eos> The flash mob is off.<eos> But... but what?
Are they going to be all right?<eos> They're in the TARDIS.<eos> Safest place on the planet.<eos> ~ If this is an invasion...<eos> ~ What?<eos> It's over. They're here.<eos> They've won.<eos> What do they want?<eos> I'm not just going to stand here and let her die!<eos> ~ Who?
(Alarms wail)<eos> I'm not gonna help you commit suicide. Look, the TARDIS can home in on this call, right?<eos> Either you help me or you leave me alone.<eos> Clara...<eos> Clara, no!<eos> There's a lot of switches around the edge.<eos> I'm just going to try pressing them all.<eos> OK.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Yeah.
You hit the curb and turned over.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Anyone hurt?<eos> - Am I broken anywhere?<eos> - No.<eos> Gimme my coat.<eos> - Bro?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I stopped them from taking your blood test at the hospital.<eos> Why?
- I'm good, man.<eos> Hey, thanks for meeting us halfway.<eos> No problem.<eos> What's pressing? Shit.<eos> What isn't?<eos> I hear that.<eos> Shit's getting very complicated, man.<eos> Sorry about your old lady. Thanks.<eos> Sorry about your crew getting hit.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
Well, I didn't give Mike anything.<eos> Do you even want to know why?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> It was because Rachel passed out at school and was in the hospital.<eos> Is she all right?<eos> Do you care?<eos> Don't you make me out to be the villain in this, Harvey.<eos> I am sorry Rachel fainted, but our obligation is to our client, and I'm not undoing that sale.<eos> We can't tonight, anyway.<eos> Why not?
Of course not.<eos> But Rachel, you can't say a word to anyone either.<eos> Go ahead, say what you're gonna say.<eos> You know what I'm gonna say.<eos> Is what he said true?<eos> Logan, I am not colluding with Mike Ross.<eos> Well, if I thought that, I wouldn't even be standing here.<eos> I'm talking about you buying that stock.<eos> - Look, I can't talk about that.<eos> - Why not?
Why are you saying that?<eos> Was he inappropriate with you?<eos> No, not with me.<eos> Maybe he was with hanna.<eos> Mom?<eos> Why did you go there right away?<eos> Um, there was an incident before we came here.<eos> But I guess I just explained it away To myself as pre-wedding jitters.<eos> I'm so sorry, mom.<eos> Yeah. Me, too.
I say if it keeps him from murdering someone we chloroform the little bastard and throw him in the lake.<eos> - I'm in.<eos> - We're not killing or kidnapping him.<eos> Then let's be smarter.<eos> We tell him there's a party and invite him.<eos> - So, you're going to ask out a freshman?<eos> - No, I'm done with teenage boys.<eos> But, if we're playing a trick on someone, we'll have to use the trickster.<eos> Who?<eos> Me?
- We're not killing or kidnapping him.<eos> Then let's be smarter.<eos> We tell him there's a party and invite him.<eos> - So, you're going to ask out a freshman?<eos> - No, I'm done with teenage boys.<eos> But, if we're playing a trick on someone, we'll have to use the trickster.<eos> Who?<eos> Me?<eos> No way.<eos> - Not me.
I feel like I'm surrounded by a bunch of psychotic nutjobs.<eos> You guys are out of your freaking minds.<eos> I don't know how you did that eye thing and I don't care.<eos> I'm walking out the door right now!<eos> If any of you try to stop me, I swear to God, I'm gonna...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Liam?<eos> You don't hear that?<eos> Did you tell someone about this?<eos> My friend Mason.
Sheriff, I know you're in a hurry, but I was out on patrol and I found someone walking from the coast to the High School.<eos> That's gotta be at least 15 miles.<eos> She was pretty determined.<eos> I'm looking for Lydia.<eos> I don't care if he's a foot taller than me.<eos> I think I can take him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> What?<eos> Me?
Yeah, cool.<eos> Hey, no fixing the game.<eos> I want him just as much as you do.<eos> Well, he's all yours.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Ah, damn it.<eos> Ofe, Ofe, Ofe! Now it's okay.<eos> So, how was it?<eos> I like kissing.<eos> Ready?
Come here.<eos> Please tell me you got milk. Mm-hmm.<eos> See, see?<eos> This is how it's done.<eos> Tell him your news.<eos> Okay.<eos> I took a leave of absence from my job today.<eos> You did?<eos> You did.<eos> Why?
Yes, I've done horrible, terrible things.<eos> And so have a lot of people.<eos> And horrible, terrible things are going to keep happening.<eos> Especially when there's a dead pool with your name on it.<eos> But not yours.<eos> True.<eos> But I am not The Benefactor.<eos> I'm just a guy who's out millions of dollars.<eos> A few thousand of which I used trying to help you.<eos> Me?
And all she ever wanted to do was help.<eos> My grandmother created the code for the dead pool.<eos> They think she's the Banshee who put the names out in the first place.<eos> She left me this message in the same code.<eos> But she didn't leave a cipher key, did she?<eos> Careful with that.<eos> I thought you didn't like guns.<eos> Does this have something to do with your eyes?<eos> My eyes, my strength, the healing...<eos> - All of it.
Grandma thought it was adorable.<eos> You okay?<eos> Last night my printer went off by itself.<eos> I couldn't turn it off.<eos> I hit the cancel button.<eos> But it just kept printing.<eos> Printing what?<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> You recognize any of these?<eos> Just my grandmother.
You looked like you were going to throw up back there.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I know.<eos> You know what?<eos> It's not the first morning you've been sick.<eos> And I've been around enough pregnant girls to know the signs. Sh!<eos> I won't tell anyone, don't worry.<eos> - You'd better not. - I just wanna help.<eos> If I can.<eos> Why?
I'm just gonna wreck it all again.<eos> And it's positive. Do we know who it belongs to?<eos> No.<eos> I've organised for testing of all inmates to begin immediately.<eos> To maintain confidentiality I'll run it as a random drug test. That's good.<eos> Excellent initiative.<eos> We need to find the guilty parties, quickly and quietly.<eos> Vera, just-<eos> Let's also keep the nature of these tests from the other officers for now, particularly the male ones.<eos> Of course, Governor.
Rosa. Is that Italian?<eos> Polish.<eos> My father. My mother's family is English/German.<eos> Ah, English, German, Polish.<eos> You're like a world war.<eos> I have some questions.<eos> I just want to know what's going on first.<eos> Right, sorry.<eos> There's a chance that we might be able to get Terry released and retried.<eos> Why?
Let's just bask in the heat.<eos> Come here.<eos> Hey. Can't sleep?<eos> No.<eos> Well, do you want company or you want to be left alone?<eos> No, I don't want to be left alone.<eos> Today was a crazy day, right?<eos> You think she's right about Jared? Yeah, I do.<eos> Especially now.<eos> Why?
Akshay, are you drunk?<eos> Yes, I am drunk.<eos> I am drunk, but it's from my own hard earned money.<eos> Get that.<eos> I don't care about anyone.<eos> Enough of this life of suffering and drinking in secret.<eos> I am an alcoholic.<eos> You want a pose.<eos> Take a pose!<eos> Great.
We have celebrities and NGOs ready to back us.<eos> It's a good thing.<eos> But you're the most important.<eos> You run the health department and the department now owns Corvadt.<eos> If you say no-one gets the vaccine until we all do... so be it.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> That's political suicide.<eos> My career will be over.<eos> How do you think you got your career?<eos> Through talent and ability?
I just saved this girl's life.<eos> You got to keep an eye on this one.<eos> She's a total mess.<eos> The car's making a strange noise.<eos> I'm not a mechanic, and you're late.<eos> I'm close.<eos> Can you order me the, uh... you know, the poached eggs with wasabi oil and shiitake chutney?<eos> No, actually, you know what, just a burger.<eos> Rush, can you just turn down the music?<eos> Why?
- The boss.<eos> - To being the boss.<eos> To being the boss.<eos> You have to get on the bus now, or the driver says she's gonna write you up.<eos> Very funny joke, Lily.<eos> She said they'll dock your paycheck.<eos> You know what?<eos> Those kids need me.<eos> I don't need a bus chaperone, and I've told everyone who will listen.<eos> - So, your mom and your two cats?
We must move further down the line.<eos> We must reach for the stars.<eos> Imagine the greatest journey ever undertaken, a century-long sojourn to a new world completed by the grandchildren of the brave souls who embarked on this adventure.<eos> Our eyes must be focused on the stars if we are to have any hope of surviving this arms race, this space race, indeed, this human race.<eos> Have you seen Lorelei? No, no.<eos> I'm sure she's around somewhere.<eos> (Dr. Enzmann):<eos> Esteemed colleagues, friends, ladies and gentlemen, I give you...<eos> Ascension.<eos> Lorelei! Lorelei?
This is your project too!<eos> I know!<eos> Wes, please, if our partnership means anything to you, do not turn her in.<eos> You need to go home now.<eos> Wes?<eos> I can't talk about this anymore.<eos> Just go home.<eos> Hey, Mr. Z.<eos> Can't let you in.<eos> - Why not?
Sanctioned by the Khan of Khans.<eos> You alerted the Song to our pending attack.<eos> You conspired to lead us into the slaughter.<eos> What need would they of warning?<eos> They knew we were descending at a week's distance.<eos> As to the wall... I am guilty.<eos> I founder in the blood of the thousands who perished for my error.<eos> I have no defense.<eos> But right or wrong, I have done nothing but serve my captor and Khan.<eos> And only him? Yes.
I'm sorry.<eos> I promise I'll find a way to make this right!<eos> Glim!<eos> Gliiimmm!<eos> Where is that girl?<eos> Gliiimmm!<eos> Seriously?<eos> See, harpoons are way more complex than they look.<eos> If you want good results, you gotta handle them with care and attention.<eos> Just like the ladies.
No, it can't be.<eos> I checked her dental records, too, Castle.<eos> It's her.<eos> I wish I could tell you it wasn't.<eos> I take it that the cause of death is blunt-force trauma.<eos> It looks like a massive skull fracture in the parietal region, but she just came in, so I've only done a preliminary exam.<eos> Once I've finished my autopsy, I'll give you a call.<eos> Okay.<eos> Castle, I'm sorry about your friend.<eos> Yeah, me too.
You disappeared and he went after you, as always!<eos> Eva, I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry ain't gonna bring him back.<eos> All right, load 'em up, children!<eos> That my daylight you burnin' here!<eos> And I ain't cooking' up no more.<eos> I'm curious to know if Mr. Bohannon will resume his role as chief engineer now that he's returned.<eos> No, Mr. Delaney is chief engineer now and will be for the foreseeable future.<eos> You don't expect any political pressure from Washington to restore Bohannon to his post?<eos> No, why?
It was never about the trunk.<eos> It was always about you.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> Even if I'm dead, there's no getting rid of me.<eos> Oh, sweetheart.<eos> In one way or another, we all want to escape.<eos> But no one's pulled it off.<eos> Happy Halloween, Harry.<eos> No one's actually done it.<eos> Not yet.
We...can explain.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You two got bored last Christmas.<eos> New Canaan clambake, actually.<eos> We were in line at the buffet, they ran out of steamers, one thing led to another, and, well...<eos> But we didn't kill Stanton.<eos> We may be guilty of cheating, but not murder.<eos> Touch these.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
Quite right.<eos> The lady's sense of propriety puts us all to shame.<eos> The question of the kilt will remain an enigma.<eos> My word, madam.<eos> If I were brave enough, I would commission you a colonel in one of my regiments.<eos> You do know how to order men about.<eos> Aye, she does that.<eos> Well, it's been a delight meeting you, but I am afraid the venison is losing its heat.<eos> I would ask you to join us, but as you can see, no room.<eos> Beastly sorry.
You will not leave this room until I am satisfied that you are as innocent as you claim to be.<eos> Either you can cooperate with me, or I shall be forced to use methods less pleasant than talk.<eos> I've heard about your methods, Captain.<eos> What would you do, lay my back open to the bone?<eos> I understand flogging is something of a sport for you.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> I take it very seriously.<eos> I'm sure you'll be pleased to learn that you've earned quite the reputation at Castle Leoch.<eos> Yes, I'm told that you once administered 100 lashes upon 100 lashes to a poor Highlander boy.<eos> A poor Highlander boy?
Do you understand?<eos> I am the one that kept the tanks out of this Plaza.<eos> I can hold this country together until elections.<eos> Or you can go back to Washington and you can say,<eos> "I had a chance to save this country" "and I didn't take it."<eos> It's up to you.<eos> We didn't just have this conversation.<eos> Until you hear from me, you don't repeat any of what you just said to a soul.<eos> Not your wife, not Khaled's ghost.<eos> Nobody.
What?<eos> That you apologize?<eos> That you were doing your duty?<eos> That you're a better man?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do other people believe you when you say that?<eos> Yes.<eos> So only I know what you really want.<eos> To take everything from me.<eos> From your son.
W-What an idiot!<eos> I want you to stay away from this!<eos> You're scaring me, Michael.<eos> But, please, j-just...<eos> Look, there are things going on. I can't tell you. Just...<eos> don't get involved, please? Okay.<eos> That... might be a bit late.<eos> I managed to get a sample of the vaccine, and I'm running tests on it now.<eos> How the fuck did you get a sample?<eos> Cleverness?
What do you want?<eos> Can I buy you lunch?<eos> Why?<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> I'm not clean.<eos> I don't want to go.<eos> Two times.<eos> What?<eos> That's two times you've come to see me in the last two weeks.<eos> Why?
Marco Ruiz.<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Sí. _
- Uh, wow.<eos> - What do you mean by that?<eos> I mean...<eos> this office is great.<eos> I love tribal art... especially ritual masks of West Africa.<eos> You do?<eos> The idea that when you put one on, you conceptually lose your human identity and become the spirit represented by the mask ...<eos> I mean, it's the definition of cool.<eos> [sighs] You do not know how relieved I am to hear you say that.<eos> - Um, why?
Yeah, that's not my forte.<eos> I got this.<eos> ♪ You're new.<eos> I can tell by your touch.<eos> Bo: How's the pressure?<eos> Craig: You don't need lotion.<eos> My skin is naturally lubricated.<eos> Yes, you are rather slippery.<eos> I am new, but I am here to please you...<eos> And your brothers.
- A client like ray doesn't want choices.<eos> Just tell him you found the perfect piece, and then make sure you do.<eos> - Got it.<eos> This really is the best partnership, isn't it?<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> You're gonna turn into a hallmark card again, aren't you?<eos> - [Laughs] No, I'm just--<eos> I'm just saying we're in this together.<eos> And I like it.<eos> - Me too.
Compelled by a hunger it can't control.<eos> See, insights like that tempt me to say the money used on your education was well spent.<eos> But feed me to my own lion?<eos> Really?<eos> Use your imagination.<eos> You're the snake, Father.<eos> And the only way for you to survive now is to end your hunger.<eos> Check the box.<eos> You need to remove that which you cannot help but pursue and devour...<eos> David Whele.
Damn it.<eos> Oh God! Luke!<eos> Help me secure these doors!<eos> We have to contain this!<eos> Are you sure you didn't go to Catholic school? Uh-uh.<eos> Go away!<eos> This is a very bad time to bother us.<eos> Oh, terrible time.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Zombies?
So this is where you've been?<eos> I'll handle the questions.<eos> You owe me some answers.<eos> I've had 20 years to piece together the conspiracy that destroyed my life.<eos> But I still have one unanswered question.<eos> Did you betray me?<eos> David, the night I lost you, my heart broke and it never mended.<eos> When I found out what Conrad had done, I went straight to the D.A. to testify, but Conrad intercepted me.<eos> For years... He kept me in silence by threatening my children.<eos> Our child.
I want to see it.<eos> And by "it," I mean your speed, in case you thought I was talking about something else,<eos> - which I... which I was not.<eos> - Okay. Okay, you see that building?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Keep your eyes on it.<eos> Whoa. You took a picture of me?<eos> From the top of that building?<eos> Yeah. Don't instagram that.<eos> Unbelievable.
Jadeite...<eos> You have failed twice already.<eos> How are you gonna pay for it?<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> Evils you create are made of clay.<eos> That's why they are so weak.<eos> Queen Beryl, I'm one of the Four Kings of Dark Kingdom.<eos> Please leave it to me. I will efficiently get more energies for our great ruler, and I will get my hands on the "Legendary Silver Crystal."<eos> But Sailor Guardians will surely get in the way again.<eos> Zoisite...
- Big guy's called a meeting.<eos> We're all waiting on you.<eos> We're all waiting...<eos> Knuckleball.<eos> Ma'am, we're really thirsty.<eos> Now you're harassing me.<eos> It's been nearly five hours.<eos> Asshole.<eos> You need a change, my friend.<eos> My friend... my friend...
Don't make their jobs any easier.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> Whatever happened to these power lines happened after the snow monster.<eos> Let's go find whoever did this.<eos> Why... well, just come on in, I guess.<eos> Oh, look at the baby...<eos> Is what I'd say if I could look at the baby.<eos> But I can't.<eos> Why?
Usagi-chan, use the new tiara to reflect the moonlight onto her!<eos> You possessed the princess, shameless villain!<eos> Sailor Moon will punish you in the name of the Moon!<eos> Princess D!<eos> What's going on?<eos> What you attacked was just my shadow.<eos> How careless of you, Nephrite.<eos> Wh-Who are you?<eos> I'm Kunzite, a servant of our Great Ruler.<eos> Zoisite.
- Idiot. - What?<eos> There you are.<eos> I'm sorry, Gretchen.<eos> Your phone keeps going to voice mail.<eos> I left it somewhere.<eos> What's up?<eos> It's Sam.<eos> He did an interview.<eos> Without consulting me? Who with?<eos> A college paper.
And others end far too soon.<eos> Not every friendship is meant to last a lifetime.<eos> What does last forever is the pain when that person is gone.<eos> I was wrong about you, Harrison.<eos> You're still one step ahead.<eos> Impressive for a man without the use of his legs.<eos> I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, Wade.<eos> A girl who can transform ordinary objects into explosives with the touch of her hand.<eos> Today I saw a man who can move faster than the blink of an eye.<eos> Extraordinary.
Give me a minute alone with my nigga.<eos> Hey, look, I hear somebody might be shopping a video of whoever killed 'Lil Homie.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> You know the streets, Don.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> I'll pay whatever they want.<eos> I just want to see whoever hurt my boy get justice.<eos> You and me... we cool?<eos> Sure.<eos> To my mentor... and good friend.
I won't tickle his balls, en.<eos> No finger up the ass.<eos> Oh, thank you for that.<eos> Guys... I don't think you understand.<eos> I need two and a half hours just to crack the safe.<eos> You're gonna get your time.<eos> This is just to get us in there and hide.<eos> But we still need to go in through the roof.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?
This high amount of sugar in juice, and drinks in general, was certainly the biggest surprise of the first week.<eos> Beverage tend to really create a rush, what I kind of call a tsunami effect.<eos> So you basically have this huge wave of sugar that gets to your liver.<eos> And that has a lot of consequence.<eos> It was now day 12 and time for my first weigh-in.<eos> Moment of truth.<eos> 79.3.<eos> Huh?<eos> - I'm about to cry.<eos> - Why?
Why don't you join us?<eos> Bring your family, your crew.<eos> I think maybe I can Convince my guys to roll by.<eos> Get up.<eos> The night tara was Killed, I got a real good look At that guy that was in the<eos> It was him.<eos> You killed my wife.<eos> I missed this, you Know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me, too.
I'm very aware of what Happened to the last person Sitting in this chair.<eos> Right.<eos> I like the idea of Having someone local to consult With.<eos> Is that what I Would be?<eos> A, uh... Consultant?<eos> I believe the Official title is "consulting Investigator."<eos> It comes out of the county task Force budget, so it doesn't chew Into my luxurious perks.<eos> It's part-time pay, but Patterson got you on the county Insurance plan.<eos> Sorry about the cancer.<eos> Me, too.
History of absconding from school and expelled.<eos> But the truth is, you choose your family, particularly around here.<eos> I'd rather he didn't know Cal was...<eos> Fine. We don't mention the drugs.<eos> Eli lied.<eos> He's hiding something.<eos> I will find out for you, sir, if you let me on your team.<eos> He was ours, and someone hurt him.<eos> I'm going to find out who did this to me.<eos> To us.
- Douglas Mahoney.<eos> The school told me Claire left campus two days ago.<eos> The credit card company said she booked a room here, so I flew in from Ohio.<eos> Did your daughter mention why she was coming to New York?<eos> No, she won't return my calls.<eos> Then I get here and find a detective and a police dog.<eos> Um... please tell me she's okay.<eos> Claire was a witness to an act of vandalism this morning.<eos> No one was hurt.<eos> Oh, thank goodness.
I put the most money into the kitchen.<eos> Cooking is a passion.<eos> When you love to entertain...<eos> Good morning.<eos> You should spare no expense.<eos> Master suite, where I like to spend most of my time.<eos> When I have time.<eos> It's a sanctuary.<eos> Oh, and I love this.<eos> Me, too.
She was very pretty.<eos> All right.<eos> How did you get out of traditional medicine?<eos> Uh... my dad screwed me.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Good. 'Cause neither do I.<eos> Oh. Look who snuck in.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning to you.
I defended you.<eos> Everyone told me that you would bring me nothing but danger.<eos> My father, Barry, Eddie...<eos> I didn't listen to them.<eos> I never listened to them.<eos> But now it's time I did.<eos> Don't contact me anymore, okay?<eos> Iris...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Me too.
Listen, leland has a Problem with your love of all Things dark.<eos> If we want this relationship to Move forward, we're gonna have To convince him that he can<eos> And how do I do that? You're a bright white<eos> Boy. Figure it out.<eos> That was teller.<eos> It's coming together. Call your guys.<eos> Jax is gonna need some backup.<eos> And cut nero loose, huh?<eos> I'm sorry it had to go down like This, huh?<eos> Me, too.
To my face.<eos> You looked me in the eye and you said you had nothing to do with what was happening to Lin.<eos> Meanwhile, you stealing his guns, you're hitting his shops.<eos> And that's why all of our girls are getting stuffed into goddamn bags right now!<eos> All of them!<eos> And now he's looking to kill me. Because I vouched for you.<eos> I believed in you.<eos> He's threatened my boy.<eos> This is what he gives me.<eos> My blood.
Okay.<eos> Then, Goodbye.<eos> You're not going back?<eos> I'm going.<eos> They saw us.<eos> What...are you doing?<eos> Kiss.<eos> That I know.<eos> I just went with the flow.<eos> The flow?
Like?<eos> Did you ask lots of questions, as we said?<eos> Straightaway.<eos> "Have you got a husband?"<eos> Well, that was right, wasn't it?<eos> Do you remember, I told you to be careful?<eos> She maybe feel awkward.<eos> She might think you're interested.<eos> -Romantically.<eos> -Why?
Anything for you, Jax.<eos> Guess things went okay here?<eos> Well, we got a pile of dead black guys in the backyard.<eos> What? Was LAPD here?<eos> There's three left if you want one.<eos> I'm good, man.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> We did it.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Good luck to you.
He drew his pistol in public.<eos> Are you sure it's wise to give it back?<eos> He didn't mean to fire it, Murdoch.<eos> He wants them alive.<eos> Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.<eos> Sir, it will be quite the feather in Station House Four's cap.<eos> With all due respect, sir, it's widely accepted that Butch and Sundance fled to Argentina last year.<eos> If Bat says he saw them, well that's good enough for me.<eos> Very well. George, see if you can find some renderings - of Butch and Sundance.<eos> - Yes, sir.
There's no way around it.<eos> I just do.<eos> But I trusted you, and, uh... I learned my lesson.<eos> Um, not... it's not...<eos> look.<eos> It always ends bad.<eos> Old way's best.<eos> So, end of day, not too bad for a first time out, was it?<eos> You did okay.<eos> I...
Illegal.<eos> I have laid all of it out.<eos> You should've told me.<eos> Because I would've told you.<eos> Come on in.<eos> - You know a Nick Marcello?<eos> - Yeah, why?<eos> They just found his body.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hank! So sorry.
You all right?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Quinn and Montez are on their way now.<eos> Good. Let me know when everyone's at the table.<eos> Aye.<eos> Get up.<eos> I'm expanding my business circle.<eos> My new friends want you in the infirmary.<eos> Why?
I'm not.<eos> Look, I told you my, my biggest fear was losing my best friend, and that didn't happen.<eos> So there's no weirdness between you two at all?<eos> It's only weird if we make things weird, and we're not making it weird.<eos> That's weird. Amy, you just handed Karma your heart, and she chopped it up like a spicy tuna roll.<eos> Hey, she's not the enemy.<eos> We both did some pretty messed up things.<eos> She lied about being a lesbian to be popular and sleep with Liam.<eos> What do you have to feel guilty about? There you are.<eos> Oh... Hey...
Oh, my gosh, she was in such a state, and I just feel like, you know, the more Barb is okay with herself when I tell her, then the more...<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here. Come here, come here, come here, come here.<eos> I am gonna tell her, okay?<eos> I am.<eos> I'm gonna make this all happen, okay?<eos> You're just so fast.<eos> You're like a... like a little... Hummingbird.<eos> You know, you're like this little tiny hummingbird with...<eos> Big boobs.
- This is very good. So do you have a pair that, you know, I could wear?<eos> I might stretch them out a little bit, but...<eos> So it's women's studies and gender studies.<eos> - Oh. - I'm so excited.<eos> I just really feel like I finally, like...<eos> I've been, like, so, like, curious and fascinated and obsessed all these years, but didn't know what to do. And now I just feel like there's a direct, you know, path and some structure.<eos> I think it's going to be great.<eos> I think so too.<eos> I think it's wonderful. It's all totally thanks to you, so thank you.<eos> - Really?
That's right. It goes back.<eos> I usually have my hair up, but...<eos> See?<eos> It's not so sexy.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sexier.<eos> - Not so sexy.<eos> Sexy.<eos> Not so sexy.<eos> Sexy.
- So...<eos> Can I just, like, wait for you?<eos> I'm just gonna... look, I'll just wait here.<eos> And then I walked into Dale's house and it was, like, totally different.<eos> I mean, has anything like that ever happened to you?<eos> Yeah. That's how anyone feels after they've boned someone random.<eos> No, listen, it wasn't just like that, wanting to ditch out, it was truly bizarre.<eos> Like I didn't know where I was, like, who I was, how I got there.<eos> Hey, I know why you were there.<eos> - Why?
Where are you?<eos> You guys owe me two grand. Well, I'm good for my half.<eos> Look, it's on me.<eos> I'm sorry you had to come down here. Come on.<eos> I've been friends with the guy 20 years.<eos> I got the standard bail schedule of the State of California memorized.<eos> I'm trouble. What do you want me to say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's a good thing you called.<eos> Why?
Of course not.<eos> You almost died.<eos> I just wanted to make sure you're okay.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> You just wanted to make sure I didn't run out on you again.<eos> Was that the plan?<eos> Listen, Zed... there's no denying that you provide moderate value in the field.<eos> I saved your life.<eos> Well, that's open to debate. The truth is, I work best alone.<eos> Me, too.
Hi, Connie.<eos> I like Connie.<eos> - Hello, beauties.<eos> - Hi. - Hey. - Where you been?<eos> My God, have you guys been at the lake?<eos> You have to go.<eos> It's like bath water.<eos> - It's disgusting.<eos> - We don't do lake.<eos> Oh, why?
And why all so many security?<eos> - We should go and look for Mariana.<eos> - Don't be stupid, Klara.<eos> Klara.<eos> Klara!<eos> Absinthe, banned for nearly a century cause they thought it drove people mad.<eos> You didn't call me here for cocktails, Mr. Landsman.<eos> You're beginning to drive me a little mad, Mr. Martin.<eos> Caused my men a lot of problems.<eos> Your men?
He caught me stealing shoes.<eos> I think he going to hit me. Instead he give me job at school.<eos> Why were you stealing shoes?<eos> Shoes bring money.<eos> I was hungry.<eos> - Where are your parents?<eos> - Dead.<eos> That's why I come Zouaret.<eos> Zac give me home...<eos> Help...
I think he going to hit me. Instead he give me job at school.<eos> Why were you stealing shoes?<eos> Shoes bring money.<eos> I was hungry.<eos> - Where are your parents?<eos> - Dead.<eos> That's why I come Zouaret.<eos> Zac give me home...<eos> Help...<eos> Not just me. All people.
You are sneaky bastard too!<eos> You OK?<eos> I've been better.<eos> Give Cat the medicine.<eos> Good boy!<eos> Ouch.<eos> Wimp!<eos> Are you OK?<eos> He will be.<eos> Thanks to you.
But this is low. Even for you.<eos> Wearing a mask over your head? Killing horses for a living?<eos> No, not for a living.<eos> Maybe for fun.<eos> Christ.<eos> Who are you working for, Sans? No, no.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> All right, I already know. Howard Vorchek.<eos> I'm not talking, except to the cops.<eos> The cops?
Look, I'm not proud of what I did, But the rec center was going under either way.<eos> I was gonna use the money to run for city council.<eos> And when raul found out That you and delgros were in bed together?<eos> Raul went nuts, Said he was gonna tell the whole neighborhood, Blow delgros' construction project all to hell.<eos> And when he broke his hand punching you On the night of the murder...<eos> That was the last time I saw him.<eos> I swear to god.<eos> Who else did you tell, fabian?<eos> Who else knew raul was gonna scuttle that deal?<eos> No one.
The jugs.<eos> - Yeah, the jugs. - Which reminds me.<eos> - I need to order flowers.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - I'll take care of it. - Thank you.<eos> When Olivia walks in, I want to literally sweep her off her feet.<eos> You mean "figuratively." "Literally" would mean she would actually get lifted off the ground.<eos> No, I know what I mean.<eos> Let's go see those jugs of yours.<eos> - Okay. - Amphoras.
Last night I had a dream with Bill in it.<eos> Wait, hold up.<eos> The triangle guy?<eos> He said he'd give me the code of the laptop if I gave him something.<eos> Like I'd actually trust Bill, right?<eos> Don't worry, bro.<eos> Today is the day that the mystery twins are back in action.<eos> I'll help you crack that code.<eos> I just got to hand off my puppet stuff to my production crew.<eos> Production crew?
With magic.<eos> Hans wants to use it against you and then invade Arendelle.<eos> Your majesty, if this is truly his plan, let us take the fight to him.<eos> No.<eos> I will not risk that many lives.<eos> There has to be a way to avoid war.<eos> I know the valley, the cave, the shortcut that they don't.<eos> Let me bring a few soldiers, and I will destroy the urn.<eos> You can bring one.<eos> Me.
- (phone rings)<eos> - Oh, sorry. Based on the preferences you've indicated, the best match for anonymous donor are on the screen.<eos> Okay? The profile contains family medical history, - Education attainment, hobbies, current occupation...<eos> This guy's a little young, don't you think?<eos> and a baby picture of the donor.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - All right.<eos> - I'll leave you to it.<eos> - Okay. - Great meeting you.<eos> - Yeah, you, too.
You're three minutes early...<eos> In Chicago.<eos> You annoyed me into stealing it.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Now you had a target, but you needed a plan.<eos> Fortunately, it walked through the door, handcuffed to Diaz.<eos> This scumbag pickpocket is Dan McCreary.<eos> He can take anything off of anyone.<eos> Anything?<eos> Anyone?
You've got demands; I want to hear them.<eos> But first let the civilians go.<eos> Would you prefer I sent them out alive or dead?<eos> Please be more specific.<eos> One helicopter, one vegetarian takeout meal, one laptop with eight gigabytes of RAM will be delivered on this roof at exactly 53 minutes and 27 seconds from now, or I shoot a hostage.<eos> There is a citywide blackout.<eos> I'm gonna need more time.<eos> Captain, you may delay, but time will not.<eos> Benjamin Franklin.<eos> Very good, detective.
No, not at all, not at all.<eos> 'How did it go with Ziane's son?<eos> ' Not as we would hope.<eos> We have returned to Chalons du Bois without him.<eos> 'I'm sorry to hear that.'<eos> We will try another approach with Ziane.<eos> In the meantime, I was hoping for your help.<eos> 'Anything.'<eos> Ziane was leaking information to that journalist...<eos> Malik.
We've got a cancellation.<eos> This is an excellent room for $250.<eos> Will that be cash or credit?<eos> Uh... do you have an ATM?<eos> How much do you need?<eos> $50.<eos> Yeah, I got it.<eos> There.<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> Me?
If you need anything, Miss Connelly said you should call her personally, and she'll take care of it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have waited for this my whole life.<eos> Can you take a quick pic, so I can text it to Ralph?<eos> Oh, wait... here.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> This bed is sterile.<eos> Let's see what's on the no-pay-per-view.<eos> 'Cause it's comped... get it?<eos> Dude...? !
Win too much too fast, probably got iced out in the poker room.<eos> The one time I need you to come through for me, Toby.<eos> We almost had it.<eos> I could feel that we almost had it.<eos> I've heard your pathetic gambling war stories for...<eos> This wasn't intentional, Walter.<eos> We have a legitimate company, Toby. A chance to grow something. A chance to show...<eos> Show who? Hmm?<eos> Show who?<eos> Cabe?
- What?<eos> No.<eos> - Yeah. She lied to us.<eos> Breaks my heart to say it, but she can't be trusted.<eos> And that's not everything.<eos> - Guys, can we please get started?<eos> - Yeah, unless there's anything urgent to discuss, i just need one more minute with Hank.<eos> So ray- a patient fired me yesterday.<eos> - What? W-wait.<eos> Why?
And yourself.<eos> John, that's not an answer.<eos> That's a public position.<eos> I'm not a fool, Louise, but I am the governor and all that implies.<eos> Can I quote you on that?<eos> No, you cannot.<eos> In fact... I would suggest that until this matter resolves, you keep it out of the newspaper.<eos> Is that a request or a threat?<eos> Public hysteria will not help Miss Cole's cause.<eos> Nor yours.
I need this party to go off without a hitch.<eos> - It's a big deal.<eos> - Maybe just a sip.<eos> - Just have a sip.<eos> - Well... - I didn't know you'd be coming.<eos> - Can we do this later?<eos> - I have to find Gretchen.<eos> - Oh, did that idiot invite her, too?<eos> I'm actually glad you're here.<eos> Why?
Who are you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who do you think you are?<eos> You really think you're Martin Odum?<eos> There is no Martin Odum.<eos> He's a legend.<eos> Everything about him is fake.<eos> Trust no one.<eos> No one!
-How is it to drive farm here?<eos> It's not like it was before.<eos> Hey, girl!<eos> Hope you do not plan to attach here.<eos> - We do not serve alcohol to pregnant women.<eos> - Great fun. Very funny, Johnny.<eos> Thought we agreed to be honest about the things that concerned children.<eos> And then I find out that you are lying to me.<eos> - When should you tell me about your girlfriend?<eos> - What girlfriend?
Better.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I heard you talking to your husband about an expansion deal.<eos> Maybe I can help... facilitate.<eos> Help?<eos> Or make the deal yourself?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> I'll do all the things that I used to do for you.<eos> To you.
You're a parasite. Do you know that?<eos> And you are particularly striking when you're angry.<eos> I think we should go for a drink, Ruth from Missing Persons.<eos> You've got my card.<eos> You stay away.<eos> Why couldn't he tell me?<eos> Oh... I can understand him keeping it from work.<eos> He worked really hard, you know.<eos> I guess no-one wants a "mad" lawyer, do they?<eos> But me...
Stop!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Who are you with?<eos> Is this your child?<eos> You and your children can go.<eos> Search everybody!<eos> Cover your legs.<eos> You're scaring the child.<eos> You look familiar.<eos> TO me, 100.
Here's his guitar, and this is his sack.<eos> They must be somewhere around here.<eos> These are their footprints.<eos> They're in here! Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> They're over here!<eos> Kill him!<eos> Don't let him get away!<eos> Get ready!<eos> Ready!
Past Halloween emotional scarring.<eos> He doesn't like to talk about it.<eos> No.<eos> It's okay, mom.<eos> I'm going to tell Will.<eos> It's 2009.<eos> I'm seven.<eos> It's just another average run of the mill trick-or-treating with my mother.<eos> Oh.<eos> So sorry.
Why? Let's overlay the downed systems on the schematic.<eos> There!<eos> On the beach. That's where the surge started.<eos> Emily, Duke and I got into a fight down there.<eos> Suddenly, a blue light appeared, So bright, it hurt to look at it.<eos> Then nothing.<eos> I don't remember anything until...<eos> Christa woke me up.<eos> She said she saw Lorelei!<eos> Lorelei?
Come on!<eos> I want full power to the ventilation system now.<eos> (ventilation system whirring) All right!<eos> Let's do this!<eos> No!<eos> You can't have her.<eos> - You feel that?<eos> - Gault, help me!<eos> I felt this before on the beach.<eos> Lorelei?
Think of it like you're on a talk show.<eos> You know, actors go on there, and they're always selling themselves and interacting and being funny.<eos> You know what?<eos> Let's... let's practice.<eos> Welcome to "The Heck family talk show."<eos> I'm your host, Frankie Heck.<eos> And I'd like to introduce my first guest, Brick Heck.<eos> So, Brick, what's this I hear about a girl with a high forehead?<eos> She sits next to me in wood shop.<eos> Oh. Wood shop?
Extractions?<eos> Barium and titanium.<eos> It's his ink.<eos> Your skill set is gonna come in handy trading tats for prison hooch in Angola.<eos> All right, look. A guy offered me $500 for a needle and a vial.<eos> What guy?<eos> Cash doesn't come with a name.<eos> Come on, look at me. Look at my teeth. Look at my tongue, look whatever you need.<eos> We'll need you to provide a description of the man to our sketch artist.<eos> Sketch artist?
You know, testifying is an art form.<eos> Not all criminalists are good at it.<eos> But I don't have to tell you that, do I, Sara?<eos> Well, I'll see you guys later. Bring the book.<eos> I'll sign it for all of you.<eos> All right, what is the story with you two?<eos> We were criminalists together back in San Francisco, and then she switched sides.<eos> She became an expert witness for the defense.<eos> Did she, uh, "skewer" you on the stand?<eos> No, no, no.
Morgan got an I.D.-- Jeff Lasky.<eos> 26-year-old out of Phoenix.<eos> I have a warrant for the guy's cell phone.<eos> See if we can triangulate that.<eos> That's just gonna tell us he's still in the hotel, right?<eos> If we tap into his Wi-Fi, we can track him down to within a few feet.<eos> Suspect's name is Jeff Lasky.<eos> He's on the ninth floor, heading east.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Ready?
You don't get extra credit for staying.<eos> I'm not asking for it.<eos> I just want more time with this.<eos> I just want to see it through entry.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> But I'm telling you, it's going to burn up into nothing.<eos> You get a lump of coal for Christmas.<eos> -Okay, a bah humbug to you.<eos> -Unbelievable.
I'm an adult male in my 30s, so, yeah.<eos> Anyway, uh, Lindsay and I wanted to celebrate y'all making it official, so I made a dinner reservation for four at 8 o'clock.<eos> Oh, hey, I almost forgot.<eos> This package came for you.<eos> That was weird.<eos> I guess I should go give him one of my famous Edgar Quintero pep talks.<eos> Wait.<eos> Ha-ha! That's your job now.<eos> What?<eos> Ew. Why?
Oh. Is that bad?<eos> Well, it's not good!<eos> You told me this was the key to your heart, and then I find out you already gave the key to your heart to somebody else!<eos> You know it's not really the key to my heart, right?<eos> But it's supposed to be a symbol of your love.<eos> You know, I was so excited that my boyfriend got a special necklace just for me, and then I find out it's just some thing you give to anybody you date.<eos> Look, it's only 'cause I'm really bad at buying presents.<eos> When I got angel the necklace, she really liked it, so I thought you would, too.<eos> I mean, my mom really likes hers.<eos> Oh, my God! Your mom, too?
Well, obviously I'm very happy that you brokered that deal, but... I'm not very interested in salvaging this relationship.<eos> "There's nothing on this earth more to be prized than a true friendship."<eos> That was Thomas...<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> Henry, you came to me in my darkest hour, and you were my true friend.<eos> Please forgive me for not being yours.<eos> How are your niece and her children?<eos> Komoyo and Esther and Simon... they're doing very well.<eos> Along with many others, thanks to you.<eos> Well, thanks to her.
Hannah, you have to talk to me.<eos> You want to know why... someone would hack my account, and kill Turk at the pool?<eos> Because... I am your best suspect.<eos> I wanted him dead.<eos> Why?<eos> Because of what he...<eos> Because of what he did to me.<eos> He a-attacked me.<eos> Why didn't you report it?<eos> To who?
Doctors said they're gonna be tweaking the protocols.<eos> Think maybe things might turn around.<eos> I'm homeless, but I'm not hopeless.<eos> He can stay with my family.<eos> My parents already said it was okay.<eos> Hannah, what...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I heard about your mom.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
Yeah. - Call the number.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Who is this?<eos> Agent Coulson, I'm glad you got my message.<eos> Raina, as I live and breathe.<eos> It's been a while since we've spoken.<eos> I'm kind of in the middle of a manhunt.<eos> Can we make this quick?<eos> Why?
Sorry.<eos> You know, a disaster of this magnitude is really hard to wrap your mind around, let alone your feelings.<eos> You don't need to worry about me.<eos> What, are you gonna profile me now?<eos> It's hard to turn it off sometimes.<eos> I guess I should just tell you this.<eos> Hotch and Rossi already know.<eos> My sister and brother-in-law died in 9/11.<eos> They were working at the Pentagon.<eos> So sorry.
Or whatever your real name is.<eos> Hanscum's good.<eos> Jody... I said she's good.<eos> Okay. All right. But you're staying back.<eos> We're taking the lead, okay?<eos> If you're gonna swing, swing hard.<eos> With vamps, head's gotta roll.<eos> Got it.<eos> Run!<eos> Well, hi, there, sunflower.
Doesn't have to be.<eos> What about you?<eos> - What about me? - Well, I saw the way you looked at that target the second time around, with all...<eos> laser focus and shit.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Maybe.<eos> He the one that... has you so stuck?<eos> I guess he is.<eos> Look, I had a bad relationship.<eos> Really... bad.
Arsenal.<eos> Arsenal!<eos> Hello, lover.<eos> If you hurt him...<eos> I didn't touch him, boyfriend.<eos> I'm a one-guy woman.<eos> But I am a little disappointed you brought your wing man.<eos> Tonight's not about him.<eos> It's about us.<eos> Together against the world.

Thank you.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Do you have any idea who I am?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> My car wash sells your books.<eos> But, you know what, you are not gonna use this murder to promote yourself.<eos> Am I hurting someone?<eos> Yes, you are-- someone with a sense of decency.<eos> Now, I have to ask you a few questions.<eos> Me?
Bye-bye.<eos> Do you have any idea who I am?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> My car wash sells your books.<eos> But, you know what, you are not gonna use this murder to promote yourself.<eos> Am I hurting someone?<eos> Yes, you are-- someone with a sense of decency.<eos> Now, I have to ask you a few questions.<eos> Me?<eos> Yes, you.
Did, uh... it come back again?<eos> Not mine, no.<eos> But, uh... one of the guys, uh, in the clinical trial-- uh, Ben-- has two little kids, four and a one-and- a-half year old.<eos> Died on Tuesday.<eos> Yeah, yeah... yeah, I-I...<eos> I saw him four weeks ago, and he was doing well, you know, just like me.<eos> Then, out of nowhere, the cancer started spreading and...<eos> He was a good guy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah. Me, too.
You get it, right?<eos> Okay?<eos> And... but-but here's the thing:<eos> I want to use that experience to prevent younger girls, like middle schoolers, from becoming mean girls.<eos> That's a part of what being a teacher, for me, is all about.<eos> Okay. Thank you.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Looks like I'll be teaching at a Catholic high school.<eos> Maybe you don't tell them you're a pregnant virgin.<eos> The Nuns or the high schoolers?
Joe, you heard him, all right?<eos> The man that killed my mom... he's back.<eos> I know.<eos> He's been in town for a few weeks now.<eos> He paid a visit to me at the house.<eos> He took all the evidence from your mom's case.<eos> The files are gone.<eos> Why wouldn't you tell me this sooner?<eos> - I couldn't.<eos> - Why?
I assume this is about last night's break-in?<eos> Well, yes and no.<eos> That's usually how things are with you, aren't they, Harrison?<eos> We believe that whoever broke in was after one of your prototypes.<eos> You'll have to narrow that down.<eos> We have literally hundreds of projects in development.<eos> One containing tachyonic particles.<eos> We've had encouraging success with tachyons, yes, but there's still a significant gap between our prototype and any real-life application.<eos> We were hoping you would lend us your prototype to use as a lure.<eos> "Us"?
I mean, honestly, it sounds even silly suggesting it. Um...<eos> I mean, Eddie's wrong.<eos> I... and if I've seemed weird before, it's just that this year has gone by really fast, and I guess I didn't realize how far along in your relationship you guys were.<eos> That's what I told him.<eos> Well, I guess I should get going.<eos> Bye.<eos> It was you.<eos> You were the one in my house that night.<eos> You killed my mother!<eos> Why?
There!<eos> On the beach.<eos> That's where the surge started.<eos> Emily, Duke and I got into a fight down there.<eos> Suddenly, a blue light appeared, so bright, it hurt to look at it.<eos> Then nothing.<eos> I don't remember anything until...<eos> Christa woke me up.<eos> She said she saw Lorelei!<eos> Lorelei?
Come on!<eos> I want full power to the ventilation system now.<eos> All right!<eos> Let's do this!<eos> No!<eos> You can't have her.<eos> - You feel that?<eos> - Gault, help me!<eos> I felt this before on the beach.<eos> Lorelei?
- How are you?<eos> Hey, wow. Hey, sweetheart.<eos> Hi. Oh, baby, come on now.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> Come to see the big guy before his big day.<eos> Well, thanks, Crosby.<eos> - Hi, daddy.<eos> - Sweetheart.<eos> Hi. You look really good.<eos> - Thanks honey. Okay, okay...
I won't.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Avoidance is what this family does best, anyhow.<eos> Hi.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Ok.<eos> University of Montana student Douglas Clark was found this afternoon next to his car, stabbed at least a dozen times, and the killer left us a calling card.<eos> Oh, that's a distinctive signature.<eos> Have there been similar murders reported in the area?<eos> Thankfully, no.
This is not paintball. It's called splat-ball.<eos> It's low-impact.<eos> It's just for kids. Why was he even there?<eos> They came to pick me up from paintball, and there were some kids from Boyd's school playing.<eos> The lucky ones that didn't get invited to that weenie Spencer's party, okay?<eos> It was just a bunch of kids. They saw Boyd sitting there. They invited him to play.<eos> He made a bunch of friends. That was the idea... to make some friends, right?<eos> Yeah, friends with guns ...that's called a gang.<eos> They even gave me a nickname.<eos> Yeah?
- It's all taken care of.<eos> - When did you do all this?<eos> In the past three hours.<eos> - So, you just assumed that I'd say yes?<eos> - No. I assumed that my charms would be impossible to resist.<eos> - That is a completely different thing.<eos> Eve.<eos> Hello? I'm sorry to bother you so late.<eos> You okay?<eos> Not really.
If you want to tell that woman what I did, fine.<eos> But tell her the whole truth.<eos> Her mother begged me in no uncertain terms to end her suffering naturally.<eos> She would have signed papers to that effect, but her daughter wouldn't allow her to.<eos> Her daughter was too scared to realize that she was keeping her alive and in agony.<eos> I did what my patient and I decided was in her best interest.<eos> You look me in the eye and tell me you wouldn't have done the same thing.<eos> Is she all right, my mother?<eos> I went for dinner and some errands, but when I came...<eos> Jeannie.
"They too were burned, not necessarily so much at the stake as through the stake."<eos> Ah, an artistic rendering.<eos> "Seeing that the tribunals were doing my work for me,<eos> I took a much needed sabbatical on the isle of Crete."<eos> I guess the inquisition made life easier for the Grimms.<eos> Yeah, it seems like the Wesenrein didn't die out with the inquisition.<eos> How did they know Monroe and Rosalee were married?<eos> It's not like they took out an ad.<eos> Well, it looks like somebody at the wedding told somebody who told somebody.<eos> Unbelievable.
We sure as hell can't take it back to the precinct.<eos> Oh, we're not leaving it here.<eos> Well, we'd better take it somewhere before somebody sees it.<eos> Okay, we'll take it to Monroe and Rosalee's.<eos> They can help us figure out what it is.<eos> That guy wasn't lying about the smell.<eos> I'm gonna call Juliette; We're gonna need a big dog crate.<eos> And animal sedatives.<eos> Now, we don't know what this thing is, so be careful.<eos> Ready?
God?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Oh, um... screening room.<eos> I'll take the elevator.<eos> Be right there.<eos> What time is it?<eos> Seven o'clock.<eos> See if we can get a late checkout.<eos> Come on, get up.<eos> Unbelievable.
Nothing.<eos> Uh, um, Jill's okay.<eos> She's sleeping now.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Christy Plunkett, Jill's sponsor, but I'm not sponsible for this.<eos> You're not.<eos> She's done this before, more times than I can count.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Me, too.
I don't know what role he'll have at court, but I want to be a part of my son's life.<eos> Of this child's life, but we will have others.<eos> Mary, my father's indiscretions were blatant, but out of respect for his wife, he gave Bash no title or standing.<eos> It hurt him.<eos> And it hurt me to see it.<eos> The eyes of the world are watching to see if we will...<eos> If I can bear an heir.<eos> Not just for France.<eos> For Scotland.<eos> And for England as well.
So what do you want?<eos> Your assurance that, when this thing with your dad explodes, none of it lands on me.<eos> And why should I do you any favors?<eos> 'Cause I'm trying to separate myself from my family's sins, and I would think that you of all people would understand what it means to be defined by them.<eos> So keep you out of it, that's all you want?<eos> - That's all I want.<eos> - Done.<eos> You won't even cross my mind.<eos> Well, that's wonderful.<eos> Unbelievable.
Can I just pretend that I found my dad and it's whoever lives here?<eos> Trust me.<eos> It's not.<eos> Why not? My mom lived in Mystic Falls for years before she had me.<eos> Somebody had to knock her up.<eos> You ever think about asking her?<eos> Oh. Good idea.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Let's go to the cemetery.<eos> Gotcha. Sorry.
- Hey... Consequently, you don't pay your people enough.<eos> No, you know me. You don't want to do this!<eos> - It is a sad... - You... - fact...<eos> that there is no loyalty among thieves.<eos> The simple offer of a substantial pay raise is all it took to sway these fine men.<eos> So you see?<eos> That's your problem!<eos> Your greatest passion... becomes your greatest! ... weakness!<eos> Love..., Mr. Carbone. Love conquers all.<eos> My friend.
Where's the snitch?<eos> I want to speak to him.<eos> Cobblepot, is it? !<eos> Condemned men are honest men, I find.<eos> What can you tell me before you go?<eos> Don Falcone. It is a great honor, sir.<eos> Indeed, I can tell a secret of great value to you..., if you grant me one last request.<eos> Which is what?<eos> Give the job of killing me to James Gordon.<eos> Why him?
I can't even imagine what he's been through.<eos> Excuse me for a moment?<eos> "Let me out."<eos> What was he in?<eos> A box.<eos> A wooden one, and I'm guessing it wasn't very big.<eos> Makes sense.<eos> Splinters, no physical activity.<eos> What about the puncture wounds?<eos> Nails.
Guys, let's just go.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Let's do some more, guys!<eos> Whoo! Let's go!<eos> Check this out, guys.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Last one!<eos> Let's do this!<eos> Ready?<eos> Ready?
Tell him, Mike.<eos> Brick, you like her, and you want her to like you back, right?<eos> In an ideal world, yes.<eos> Okay, so... you hold the door open for her, you help her out if she's carrying something heavy, and you don't leave in the middle of the date to go trick-or-treating.<eos> I asked her if she wanted to go with me, and she said no.<eos> And that's why you needed to stay home.<eos> Why would I stay home if I wanted to go?<eos> Because as a man, you don't get to do what you want.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
- Sure thing, dad.<eos> - Dad?<eos> You must be this shane he keeps talking about.<eos> Kinda skinny for you, ain't he?<eos> You get him to sign that nda yet?<eos> - Nda?<eos> - Non-disclosure agreement.<eos> You mind signing one real quick?<eos> Hey, family.<eos> Family adjacent.
Do you understand?<eos> Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> Did it work?<eos> He's using a burner phone, so it's impossible to get an exact address.<eos> We got nothing on voice recognition.<eos> Okay, uh, $1.6 million is a very specific number.<eos> Does that mean anything to you guys?<eos> No.<eos> No, not to me.
Listen I'm sorry... but this trip was a mistake.<eos> It's time we go our separate ways.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> I thought you were giving us a chance.<eos> Nope!<eos> Now look, you invested a little time in this, too, so, how about... 20... $24?<eos> That-that sound fair to you?<eos> That sounds fair to me.<eos> Unbelievable.
Anu.<eos> Anu.<eos> AJ...<eos> You killed her...not me.<eos> If you had listened to me... then she wouldn't have died.<eos> Don't worry. Time.<eos> Time heals every wound.<eos> The pain will last only for few days.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Anu.
You'll keep sending your men.. ..and I'll keep slicing them.<eos> How long will we keep doing this?<eos> Until you don't come back and marry Marina.<eos> Okay I'm coming.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> That's international Mafia. We're small players and you want to face the bigger fishes.<eos> Stop packing, you're my best friend.<eos> I won't let you go.<eos> That's why I am taking you along.<eos> Me?
This is my brother.<eos> Jesse, this is Clarence.<eos> You know that he's telling people that he saved your life?<eos> I think he's telling women to, you know, influence their opinion of him.<eos> Oh, well, maybe he lies a lot.<eos> But that one's true.<eos> See, that's the thing.<eos> They just keep talking about diminished lung function.<eos> - And he's sure that it was gas coming out of the truck?<eos> - Why?
Robin, I'm sorry, but if you truly want to save Marian...<eos> You're gonna have to forget about me...<eos> And...<eos> Find a way...<eos> To fall in love with your wife again.<eos> You can show yourself, dearie.<eos> I'm not the one you're hiding from.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> To what do I owe this intrusion?<eos> A warning.
You leave first.<eos> (overlapping chatter continues) Something tells me we came to the right place.<eos> You think?<eos> Oh. Richard sionis.<eos> James gordon.<eos> This is my partner, harvey bullock.<eos> How can I help you detectives?<eos> I don't have much time.<eos> You know this man? Coleman lawson? He might have interviewed for a job.<eos> Sorry, no.
Tell me about where you come from.<eos> Why aren't you trying to get back there?<eos> Don't you have friends and family?<eos> - Of course.<eos> And I will, when I'm finished my work here.<eos> It'll be quite the reunion.<eos> I'm very much looking forward to it.<eos> - And what is it you think you're doing here Besides causing pain, destruction?<eos> - Proving a point.<eos> - To who?

And my friend Melissa got in, too, and her family has an apartment right off campus, so she says I can live with her, and that way you won't have to worry about paying for housing or a meal plan or anything.<eos> Well, you're talking pretty fast there, kiddo.<eos> Something else driving your decision?<eos> No.<eos> Just feels right.<eos> Well, I want you to broaden your horizons-- including geographically-- and we discussed this, we agreed on this.<eos> You went to school in New York, and you did great.<eos> Uh-huh. Honest answer?<eos> Mm-hmm. You didn't happen to overhear Grandpa and I talking the other night after dinner?<eos> No. Why?
How'd you run into Grady in county?<eos> I was dropping supplies off in the laundry.<eos> And I heard arguing.<eos> If you tell the DA about our little talk, I'm gonna kill you ugly...<eos> I swear, I won't tell anyone.<eos> I swear.<eos> Not a word.<eos> That voice. I recognized it immediately.<eos> Don't say a word.<eos> Not to anybody.
When I think about all the fornication I fostered...<eos> I can't believe I flat-ironed my MJB for this.<eos> Excuse me, Mitchell.<eos> I have to check in on my son.<eos> Uh, while you're at it, could you also check in on the son of God?<eos> He's been waiting to hear from you.<eos> - [Up-tempo music plays] - [Groans] Eliza: I've never put a child to bed before.<eos> I'm sure it'll be fine.<eos> Good night, Kevin.<eos> And to you.
Just, uh, no sparks for me anyway.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Well, how do you know for sure?<eos> How about we go inside and see what happens, huh?<eos> I don't... I don't think so.<eos> But it was really great to meet you, and, um, you, uh...<eos> you take care, ok?<eos> Seriously?<eos> This is it?<eos> Yeah. Sorry.
My turn.<eos> What are you afraid of?<eos> Oh, you want to get real?<eos> You got it.<eos> I'm afraid that I'm gonna keep making the same mistakes.<eos> Which ones, Jack?<eos> Your turn, tough girl.<eos> I'm afraid of people really knowing me, and I don't want to have this conversation, and this is as far as it goes.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Sorry, Jack.
You just keep looking. Man:<eos> We're closing in 15.<eos> Oh. Hi. I'm in here.<eos> Annie?<eos> Nice outfit.<eos> Ok, clown. Enough.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Bobby?<eos> Take care, clown.<eos> Annie?
Oh. Hi. I'm in here.<eos> Annie?<eos> Nice outfit.<eos> Ok, clown. Enough.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Bobby?<eos> Take care, clown.<eos> Annie?<eos> Somebody?<eos> Annie!
I'm telling you, Andrea is a mean woman.<eos> Look. I know that I hurt her, but she was just as cruel and vindictive in the divorce.<eos> She ruined me.<eos> And Roberta Flack? Huh?<eos> Who's that?<eos> She's a singer.<eos> I've never heard of her.<eos> "First time ever I saw your face" is the song in question.<eos> She told you about that song.<eos> What song?
You need to let us handle it.<eos> Then handle it.<eos> Put him behind bars.<eos> We need evidence to do that, and we don't have it yet.<eos> He killed my dog.<eos> He attacked me.<eos> Isn't that enough evidence?<eos> There's nothing to link him to those two incidences, but if there is evidence to be found, we will find it, Andrea.<eos> Hey, Jack, got a minute?<eos> No. Sorry.
I understand the significance of the magical clock, but what's that got to do with this book or its author?<eos> Do you know what's under that magical clock tower?<eos> No.<eos> A library.<eos> Hmm. I've always liked that picture.<eos> Emma has your eyes.<eos> She has your smile.<eos> Do you remember when you took it?<eos> How could I forget? That was the party we had at granny's after Emma helped us go up against...<eos> Pan or Anton the giant?
You'll never guess what I just found.<eos> Huck?<eos> Huck, are you okay? What's wrong? She doesn't believe me.<eos> I tried telling her the truth many times.<eos> She doesn't believe me.<eos> She'll never believe me.<eos> And I told her the truth.<eos> I told her the truth.<eos> I told her the truth.<eos> Who?
It's like Cooper's hit-and-run.<eos> The operation continues and grows.<eos> So, I should have known this.<eos> Everything was pointing to Sanderson.<eos> It was too clean.<eos> Durant set Sanderson up as the fall guy.<eos> The DNA that you found, it-it's got to be Durant's.<eos> Even if it is, he's not in the system.<eos> So, why didn't you tell us that your father was Desmond Wilson?<eos> Stepfather.
I mean, I guess there really is a silver lining, even in... murder. Whoa, whoa. Wait a second.<eos> What's this?<eos> No work at home, remember?<eos> This is my research for Christine's schools.<eos> Oh, no, Bones.<eos> After reading Professor McLaughlin's book, I realized that my expectations were as rigid as my approach to finding the right school.<eos> So all the ratings and the... kindergarten language requirements, what, are you just gonna toss those out the door?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm leaving them to you.<eos> Me?
And, uh, don't go wandering.<eos> Did you know we were coming to a convent?<eos> It's one gory detail she left out.<eos> You should have brought Zed.<eos> Don't you bloody start on me.<eos> Uh, excuse me, luv?<eos> You don't happen to know a British girl by the name of Anne Marie Flynn, do you?<eos> Fairly pretty, brunette.<eos> She kind of got this...<eos> Annie?
You'll have your veritable pick after this.<eos> Um, very well done, Grey.<eos> Oh, the board would like to see you to, uh...<eos> Of course.<eos> - Meredith.<eos> - Derek, not now.<eos> Five minutes. Just five minutes.<eos> Derek, I swear to God, I can't do this right now.<eos> I am sorry about the thing I said about your mother.<eos> Why?
Stop. We're not fighting.<eos> The fighting is over.<eos> I am calling a halt to it.<eos> God, Derek, you don't just get to do that, decide when we're moving, decide when a fight is over.<eos> What if I'm not done fighting?<eos> Oh, it's... it's not over. I can guarantee you that.<eos> We'll probably fight tomorrow and the next day, and this is gonna last for a while, but right now we're gonna have a truce.<eos> - A truce?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Why?
I know.<eos> I know. I know!<eos> Graham, trade places with Robbins.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - Dr. Herman, I...<eos> - It's fine.<eos> We've just lost some valuable time.<eos> Let me just explain.<eos> Do you know how many fetal surgeons there are west of the Mississippi river?<eos> Five.
I have to.<eos> Yeah, but if he was just protecting her...<eos> All right, look, look, you just gotta do something.<eos> You got to make sure he's treated fairly back there.<eos> It's the least you can do.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Because I needed to be reminded to be fair.<eos> Find the girl's killer.<eos> 'Cause if you don't, that guy's gonna fry for it.<eos> Why?
Just what I've always wanted.<eos> Another lucky mutt with a get-out-of-jail-free card.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You only brought one other guy?<eos> I think we can handle it, Dillinger.<eos> Catch you guys next time around.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Marshal, a word?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, Detective?
But in the end the only one who can keep you safe is you.<eos> You're not listening.<eos> I'm saying it's over.<eos> The manufacturer found a faulty sensor in Officer Taylor's body camera.<eos> I am listening, but how does that make it over?<eos> The camera malfunctioned.<eos> Taylor didn't turn it off.<eos> It went off.<eos> Not good enough.<eos> Why not?
Well, it's gonna take a while, especially since we can't tell them that we're protecting the real Mara.<eos> So I'm just asking you to sit this one out.<eos> Just give it some time.<eos> Fine.<eos> Well, I'm detective...<eos> I know who you are, Wuornos.<eos> Traitor.<eos> You don't deserve to wear this.<eos> You want to tell me what you're doing here, mister...<eos> Reggie.
- It's like a Marx brothers movie in here.<eos> It doesn't matter, Cary!<eos> He's our client. - We can't favor you over him, - See?<eos> - or him over you. - See?<eos> Tough cookie.<eos> Hi.<eos> No, it's going very well.<eos> Yes. No, I haven't shown that to her yet.<eos> You haven't shown her the opposition research?<eos> Why not?
- And I cannot deal with any more things.<eos> - I got to go.<eos> I will deal with this here.<eos> Lauren will not be an issue in Alicia's campaign, okay?<eos> I'll talk to you, Mr. Governor.<eos> Peter?<eos> Asking how you knew about Zach? Yeah.<eos> You, uh, sure you want to continue, Mrs. Florrick?<eos> - We can stop right here.<eos> - Why?
Are you running?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - I'm still contemplating. - You have till Monday to decide.<eos> If it's any consolation, Mrs. Florrick, uh...<eos> Alicia.<eos> Anyone who's pawed through my underwear drawer should really call me by my first name.<eos> Alicia. I've sat through 18 of these "come to Jesus" moments with candidates, and you've handled it the best.<eos> Great. Thank you.<eos> Nice meeting you, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> You, too, Mr. Elfman.
- No.<eos> Come here. You have to see this.<eos> What?<eos> - Hi, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> - Jennifer. - What's going on?<eos> - I'm just editing Grace's video.<eos> But look.<eos> I have a Google alert on your name, and this popped up.<eos> It's cool, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> - Like Hillary, huh?
Now, that's what I think.<eos> Well, when you put it that way...<eos> Yeah, I mean, I guess in some opinions, - we have been kind of jerks about it.<eos> - I guess.<eos> Yeah. You have.<eos> But if you're interested, there might be something you could do to make it up to them.<eos> Well, Rick, sorry to see you guys go.<eos> Oh, yeah, me, too, but, uh, it couldn't be helped.<eos> Hey, there, cowboy.<eos> Where you off to in such a hurry?
Exactly, but...<eos> But it's like you're vomiting out everything that's wrong with your life.<eos> It's, it's really difficult to describe, but I had a shaman, and I was guided through this journey, and in my journey, I saw everything so clearly.<eos> Latin lover narrator: Full disclosure, I tried it.<eos> Did nothing for me.<eos> What's clear is that you are an addict.<eos> Yes.<eos> Exactly.<eos> But why?<eos> Why?
In any case, she's back.<eos> So I would really like my job back as well.<eos> I'll toe the line.<eos> Fine.<eos> But you'll answer to Lachlan.<eos> Okay, got it.<eos> Hey, Lachlan.<eos> So, I just got an interesting call from your father.<eos> Yeah. I answer to you now.<eos> Petra: Well, to me,
Is that what you want to hear?<eos> Well, it's true.<eos> I should get back to my mother.<eos> Rafael:<eos> It had to have been Petra. She's the only person crazy enough to set me up.<eos> - So crazy.<eos> - You know,<eos> I'm just gonna expedite her settlement.<eos> I don't want to deal with it anymore. I want it to end and I don't want it to get in the way of... us.<eos> What "us"?

But I can get you in.<eos> And if I let you take a team, where will you take them?<eos> How do you intend to find this city?<eos> Well, I'll have to look everywhere really, really hard.<eos> I'm not giving you men and money on the off chance that you'll find this place.<eos> Or if you do, that you'll not take its true power for yourself. Me?<eos> Nah!<eos> No, I'm not management material.<eos> I'll leave that power part to you.<eos> Then why?
Not anymore.<eos> You lie to yourself. You want to know why?<eos> It's simple.<eos> You can't reconcile all the ugly, horrible things you do with the hero you so desperately want to become.<eos> You're out of dirt.<eos> Sorry to see it go down this way. No, no.<eos> No!<eos> No, no. No! - Oh, no!<eos> - Admit it!<eos> Not to me ... to yourself.
Just, uh, keep the pencil behind your ear, and bring the hard hat, um, and the safety goggles.<eos> Long game.<eos> Wonder what's taking, uh, Jess so long.<eos> Well, you know women.<eos> What's women?<eos> Am I right? "What's women?"<eos> I just don't know them like you know them, is my point.<eos> Uh, so, what kind of guys do you like to date?<eos> Me? All kinds.<eos> Yeah. Hunks.
I am well aware of the struggle between artist and management.<eos> Walter!<eos> It's Toby!<eos> He's in trouble!<eos> Happy, keep going, keep going.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!<eos> We have Peyton Temple.<eos> You pull him up, we'll take you to Temple.<eos> He's who you want.<eos> Not us.
Samaritan is making itself known.<eos> Shot spotter ID'd over 20 gunshots in the last two hours, and I don't even want to guess how many of those ended up in a homicide.<eos> Three, according to Lionel.<eos> Samaritan's turning people against each other, revealing their secrets, unlocking doors that were never meant to be opened in the first place.<eos> - Hey, Glasses?<eos> - Yes, Detective?<eos> You hear from my partner, just tell him we were too late.<eos> My WITSEC lady and her husband got killed.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that, Detective.<eos> Yeah, me too.
I should have known this would get out of hand.<eos> Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?<eos> You and Kenny are just as responsible, and the next time you want to shove me, just remember I'm covering your ass.<eos> [ Indistinct chatter ]<eos> Hi, everyone.<eos> For those of you I don't know as well, my name is Roger Donovan, and, uh... just like you, I'm pretty upset about what's going<eos> - on in our neighborhood.<eos> - How are these drones legal?<eos> My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet<eos> - like that.
None of us watched the video.<eos> But if we did, we could handle it.<eos> We see sickening things like that every day.<eos> We understand the humiliation your wife has gone through, Mr. Tucker, but we don't...<eos> I haven't been "humiliated." I've been wronged.<eos> We are here to ask for your help.<eos> Now are you gonna help us or not?<eos> Well, that'd probably be best left to a professional<eos> - hair-removal company.<eos> - Or perhaps a forest ranger.
I walked in, a page got turned.<eos> Sergeant?<eos> All due respect, sir, the chief's at the wheel.<eos> All due respect, Sergeant.<eos> I asked you the question.<eos> Detective Reagan's situation.<eos> And my part in its, um... origins.<eos> That sound right?<eos> I was asking the sergeant, sir, if his management style might've given the men and women under his command reason to suppose that showing results outweighed proper procedure in obtaining those results.<eos> Men and women or one man?
That is a class D felony.<eos> Your word against my word.<eos> Actually, I think Ernesto's word is going to carry the day.<eos> You're bluffing.<eos> They asked me to give you back your swag.<eos> And now you're going to crucify me.<eos> No.<eos> I am going to give you the respect that you wouldn't give my son.<eos> I'm going to give you one last chance to honor the cloth you wear and the title you put before your name.<eos> Why?
Uh, well, DoD was set to install their own security system upon completion of my review. After the holidays.<eos> Right.<eos> - Do you have any idea why the thieves would burn down your server room?<eos> No, I... I have no idea.<eos> I'd love to get in there and find out.<eos> I could patch a recovery program and see whether or not they made off with any of our malware.<eos> I'm sorry, did you say your malware?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thought that you created systems to fight against the malware.<eos> Unbelievable.
He can't get away with this.<eos> Right?<eos> He can.<eos> He relinquished control of the company to a third party,<eos> Keri Hathaway.<eos> Do you know who that is?<eos> The receptionist.<eos> So, bottom line is if your sister signs off on any sort of mediation agreement, this jackass will get all of the assets, and there's not a damn thing anybody can do about it.<eos> All right.<eos> Sorry, man.
All right.<eos> I got to tell you, my buddy's a huge football fan.<eos> He's gonna be pretty jealous when he learns that I met you.<eos> Let's take a picture and rub it in.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah. Man, this is cool.<eos> All right. You ready?<eos> Eric Dickerson.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> Unbelievable.
Thank you so much.<eos> There you are.<eos> Okay, so after four hours on expedia, I think I got this whole thing figured out.<eos> So, the three of us can go to Orlando for the weekend.<eos> Flights, hotels, theme park, food for under $2,000, and my mom said that she would watch aida.<eos> Now, I know that this is a splurge, but you know, I think--<eos> I think we can swing it.<eos> Honey, we can't-- we can't afford that.<eos> We can't...<eos> Why?
Well, it seems, Ace, there's still some freaks up there living in the woods, skinning people and dumping them in the bay.<eos> Poachers... not people, responsible for the decimation of hundreds of wild and endangered species.<eos> Yes. Horrific.<eos> And if that was your endgame, I'd be writing you another sizable contribution to keep up the good work.<eos> But that isn't the endgame, is it, Geoff?<eos> You see, before I got involved with your foundation, I ran a comprehensive background check...<eos> All your business interests, corporations...<eos> Among them, a rather innocuous shell called "Wendigo, LLC."<eos> Everything looked fine.<eos> Shame on me.
You're bleeding.<eos> I'm losing my child.<eos> There's nothing we can do about it now.<eos> No!<eos> No one must know until after the christening.<eos> I have to tell Francis myself and...<eos> I don't want to ruin things for Lola and the baby.<eos> Now is not the time to think of others.<eos> If you consider yourself a friend, you will not say a word.<eos> To anyone.
Well, nobody knows more about running that factory than we do.<eos> When I came back and saw what had become of the place, it broke my heart.<eos> Well, look, I am absolutely sure that between the three of us, we are gonna get Langston furniture back to its former glories.<eos> Jacob, get down from there.<eos> Come on.<eos> - What happened to our car?<eos> - Which one? The green one, with the wood on the side. - Which?<eos> - The station wagon.<eos> Right. They don't make them like that anymore.<eos> Well, why not?
- Whatever happens, you have to know...<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm at peace with this.<eos> And you should be, too.<eos> Because if I go away, it's what was meant to happen.<eos> Nurse? ! Nurse!<eos> - We got your back, Carl.<eos> Oh, God, Ray! Somebody help me!<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right. Thanks.
What's going on?<eos> Are we not having Thanksgiving at home this year?<eos> Sue, take a look around this place.<eos> But we have to stay home.<eos> Thanksgiving's not Thanksgiving without frugal hoosier canned corn, safeway boxed stuffing, and CVS pumpkin pie.<eos> Brick, did you hear this?<eos> Mom and dad say we're having Thanksgiving at a restaurant.<eos> Well, I'm actually okay with that.<eos> Of course, I'll have to run it by Cindy first.<eos> Why?
I figured that's how you always have to do it.<eos> Han, it's the diner.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> Open the door.<eos> I put something behind it that reminds me of each of you.<eos> Mine has Sophie.<eos> Mine has a saxophone.<eos> Mine has a cupcake.<eos> Mine has a chainsaw.<eos> Hey, everybody!
Doc! Doc.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me.<eos> You...<eos> You set me up, you bastard. You set us all up!<eos> No! No, I didn't.<eos> I had no idea this was gonna happen.<eos> I swear.<eos> You have to believe me. No, I don't!<eos> I don't have to believe anything anyone says ever again!<eos> Especially you!
Let me see your contract, Quagmire.<eos> There's got to be a way out of this.<eos> I'm gonna kill him, that's what I'm gonna do.<eos> ClubAmigos.<eos> That's what we're gonna call this place.<eos> Here it is. You've got 72 hours after closing to rescind the purchase. State law.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I got to go tell Brian the deal's off.<eos> Oh, there's a head in the freezer.<eos> Ooh, and sherbert.
Don't make me call the guard in here.<eos> 'You should have hit me harder.'<eos> I hit you as hard as I can.<eos> I just want to see my mum.<eos> Get your stinking gorilla hands off of me!<eos> Aw, Mr Cross... No "Thanks for treating my wounds"?<eos> "Thanks for the daily sponge baths"?<eos> "Thanks for feeding me when I couldn't move my hands"?<eos> Oh, God, that's why it had to be us. Why?<eos> Fuck you!
~ Well, I don't think that's how it goes. ~ No, this prick.<eos> 'Oscar five five in pursuit of a black Mercedes heading 'southbound on the A329...'<eos> I have to admit I was surprised to hear from you.<eos> The last I heard you were in prison in Texas for running drugs.<eos> I can't imagine how you made it all the way here.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> ~ Yeah. ~ Thank you.<eos> It's pretty amazing.<eos> But you can't stay.<eos> Why?
The VX-O5.<eos> It's got "Bob" written on it.<eos> Why did you steal his Thermos?<eos> I thought you'd forgotten it, so I just picked it up.<eos> Tea anyone?<eos> We're running out of time, give me the VX-O5 so we can make it safe.<eos> We want our lives back.<eos> We can't just bring you back to life.<eos> Whoever tried to kill you, before long they'll find out and they'll try again and we can't guarantee we'll stop them.<eos> Why not?
Well, all this excitement fried his circuits.<eos> His cooling system kicked in. Now he's recharging his batteries.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> I want you and Billy to immediately return to HQ.<eos> If things go radically south here, I'll need you to implement the Theta Protocol. - Sir...<eos> - That's an order, Agent Koenig.<eos> Go.<eos> HYDRA's here in a big way. Some abandoned theater. The Ponce de Leon.<eos> Theater Ponce de Leon.<eos> Why over there?
Opal?<eos> No. We have to stop the test.<eos> You give metalbenders a bad name!<eos> Thanks for coming to save us, mom.<eos> Yeah, thanks, chief. I'm sorry for what I said last night.<eos> I was just...<eos> You know. Look, I know I wasn't a great mother, but one way or another, I ended up with two great kids.<eos> Good enough to risk my bony old butt for, anyway.<eos> If you can just find some way not to hate me, maybe that's enough, at least for me.<eos> Me too.
Says the freak who's stalking my sister.<eos> Technically, I'm lying in wait.<eos> Why didn't Bonnie come back?<eos> Why didn't she come back?<eos> Because she wasn't there.<eos> It was just me.<eos> You know I paid her cell bill so I could call her phone and hear her say the same 6 words every day?<eos> Sounds good.<eos> I'll give it a call.<eos> Why?
That is assuming that he feels the same way.<eos> Only now that Charmonique mentioned it,<eos> I didn't really know how Henry felt.<eos> After I revealed myself to him, he didn't really say much.<eos> It seemed like all his energy went into trying not to look at my...<eos> I saw them.<eos> Separately, and then together.<eos> It was basically a full-frontal, co-worker-type situation. So...<eos> - Naturally, I thought of you.<eos> - Me?
For you.<eos> That means I owe you a drink.<eos> Looks like today you're the one that needs cheering up, so...<eos> Let me return the favor.<eos> My new bartender's the best.<eos> Your bartender?<eos> Well, I followed your advice to take what I wanted.<eos> Turns out it was this club.<eos> Well, getting what you want is, uh, easier said than done sometimes.<eos> Why?
You work at the crime lab.<eos> And that is your bank account balance.<eos> And as you can see, you received $30,000 six months ago...<eos> I'm going to go to the police unless you answer my questions.<eos> What questions?<eos> Well, this $30,000 couldn't have come from your salary at the crime lab, so who paid you?<eos> I won the money.<eos> Oh. How?<eos> At a riverboat casino.<eos> Oh. Which one?
We keep trying.<eos> And then meanwhile, he runs away or he's back on the piers?<eos> Meanwhile, he's locked up.<eos> We have him on drug possession and solicitation.<eos> But he's the victim here.<eos> Lindsay, you want him to run away?<eos> You want him to run back to the piers?<eos> No.<eos> Can you think of anyone that he may have confided in?<eos> Maybe your mother?
Well, sir, our good Lord and my boys are all I've really got.<eos> All Edna left me was wonderful memories and some ungraded papers, which I'm still working my way through.<eos> Flanders, are you crying?<eos> Ah, just snowflakes on my mustache.<eos> Listen, could I buy a left-handed, uh... I don't know, eyelash curler?<eos> Sure, but y-your eyelashes are long and luxurious already.<eos> Are you just buying this to be nice?<eos> Uh, maybe.<eos> Oh, Homer, unto us this day, a neighbor is born.<eos> But why?
What'd you sign up for?<eos> Look, I was paid...<eos> Shot came from the roof.<eos> Check him.<eos> Yeah. Brody, cover us.<eos> Go!<eos> There goes our best lead.<eos> I'm gonna cross the street.<eos> You cover me, meet me on the river side, top of the roof.<eos> Ready?
He's a troubled young man.<eos> Wish I could say he's not capable of that kind of violence.<eos> Daniel's disturbed.<eos> His parents tried counseling, prayer, nothing worked.<eos> Disturbed how?<eos> Let's just say that Daniel preferred the company of men.<eos> You all were trying to pray away the gay?<eos> Which is, of course, impossible.<eos> So that's why the Mikorskis disinherited their son and left their money to you.<eos> Not to me, to my church.
You just described my childhood.<eos> And adulthood.<eos> There is a woman back home, Amina.<eos> I am supposed to marry her.<eos> It's an arranged marriage.<eos> It is beyond bad, okay?<eos> Tariq can't call it off.<eos> But, let me guess, you tried.<eos> But somebody wasn't happy about it.<eos> My older brother Kasib.
He tried to kill me.<eos> Olivia: Who ordered you to kill the president's son, Tom?<eos> Your father.<eos> The order didn't come from Ballard.<eos> It came from rowan.<eos> Why did he do it?<eos> He told your friend Harrison that...<eos> He took my child, so I took his.<eos> Why did Tom confess?<eos> Why now?
William, I told the court that she should spend the rest of her days in an asylum.<eos> If she is innocent, - I may well have condemned her.<eos> The trial's half over and you want to start an investigation?<eos> Aren't you two about to get married?<eos> Sir, Station House Number 5 investigated the case, and as we know, they aren't always as thorough as they could be.<eos> Not that they'll enjoy having that pointed out to them.<eos> Who sent the postcard?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - And why send it to you?<eos> Why not the lawyer?
- "Love never ends."<eos> - She's leaving town.<eos> On the 6:32.<eos> We have to stop them!<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Thomas!<eos> Stop right there!<eos> What's going on?<eos> Inspector, Mrs. Mary Thompson and her husband are getting away with murder.<eos> - Whose husband?
- Oh. Oh! - Grohl:<eos> You know what we should do?<eos> We should tag that, uh... at the end of this thing I've been writing.<eos> Fuckin' fooled around with this thing...<eos> It goes... ( playing "Smells Like Teen Spirit" )<eos> Yeah...<eos> No, I don't think that one's gonna work.<eos> B side, B side.<eos> ( strums guitar ) Okay, ready?<eos> - Taylor Hawkins:
I told him that Hannah and I were meant to be together.<eos> Not him and her.<eos> And then things just, uh, got out of hand.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Swear.<eos> Accident or not...<eos> still murder.<eos> Now we know the truth.<eos> How you gonna sleep tonight?<eos> Like a baby.
You really think that's all he is?<eos> I once watched that guy eat a beer can.<eos> True story.<eos> People are complicated.<eos> It's never that simple.<eos> Everybody has layers.<eos> People read "cop," maybe I'll at least get a free cup of coffee.<eos> If they give you free donuts, that means they're making fun of you.<eos> Well, how about if I update my status to say, "Taking a friend out for a beer."<eos> Me? Yes.
And then you snapped Jeremy's neck when Elena said she'd never love you.<eos> On second thought, let's focus on all the charming, heroic things you obliterated from my girl's mind.<eos> God, if I could take it all back, I would.<eos> I know.<eos> And listen. Despite the fact that my long list of dastardly deeds involves killing you,<eos> I'm glad you're alive.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Unh! Although had you actually died a vampire instead of becoming human again, your compulsion would have gone away, and Elena would be mine again.<eos> Hey. Really heartfelt.
- Perfect.<eos> Then send me home, and we can both get back to it.<eos> I mean, look at me.<eos> I'm fit as a fiddle.<eos> Well, that's not what your labs say.<eos> Uh, cholesterol is in the 300s.<eos> Your triglycerides are worse.<eos> Your BP's too high, and your blood sugar is in the pre-diabetic range.<eos> Who are you gonna believe...<eos> Me or science?
- On it. - Graham, move.<eos> Move!<eos> Your mother had a spinal-fluid leak.<eos> I was able to stop it without opening up her skull.<eos> She's still in surgery, and we hope to repair the damage to her right lung.<eos> Your father has some internal bleeding.<eos> We'll know more soon.<eos> Thank you both so much.<eos> I didn't want to do that to her...<eos> That other doctor.
Aminta, please...<eos> I have the right to know the truth.<eos> Baby, you know I love you...<eos> Margaret's dead, okay?<eos> Anyway, Margaret and I discovered monies that were allocated to a series of black operations conducted by a Delta unit codenamed "Duster."<eos> The monies were allocated to operations that never existed and were never sanctioned<eos> So you think a Delta unit robbed the government?<eos> Of over $40 million.<eos> Yesterday, we reported it to our superior.<eos> Doug Ouellet?
It sends a message.<eos> It certainly does.<eos> Marriages have been making alliances for centuries.<eos> It's a custom the people understand.<eos> By bringing Condé into your family, you exemplify acceptance, tolerance, people living together in peace.<eos> I can't.<eos> The nobles will rise against me.<eos> The marriage won't confer any real power on the Protestants, but it would be a balm to them.<eos> Insurance from them rising up against you.<eos> Against us.
Do not lay a hand on her future.<eos> In all our ventures together, I've never seen your husband so happy.<eos> There's a light in his eyes that clearly you put there.<eos> He is a charmer.<eos> What's happening with the school?<eos> Did my funding help it complete?<eos> Hugo, can you update us all?<eos> Hugo's our money man.<eos> He's been on top of some issues<eos> - with the construction.
What made you change your mind?<eos> Well, a first kiss is hard to forget, And it was my fault we had to move.<eos> Your digs are fine.<eos> But dial back the immortal charm, you know?<eos> This is my funeral.<eos> What?<eos> Do you see her?<eos> [ bell tolling ] No, not yet.<eos> At least you can pay your respects to your friend.<eos> To who?

Everybody liked you.<eos> Yeah, the real problem's Prady.<eos> His brand is just as strong.<eos> And he's announcing this week.<eos> Truth is, he'll get a big bump<eos> - from his announcement, so, we have to step on it.<eos> - What he means is, we need an event to coincide with his announcement, so that he doesn't own the day.<eos> We're spitballing ideas. Peter is willing to help, perhaps make an announcement of his own or something.<eos> Did you tell her I started my own firm?<eos> - What? - That lady.
Good. Let's do this.<eos> All right, everybody ready?<eos> Legal advice.<eos> Ah. It's always important to stay legal.<eos> Okay, can we get a level from both of you?<eos> Yes, I'm glad to be here and I want to thank the president and the first lady for having us.<eos> Uh, Alicia.<eos> Five, four, three, two, one!<eos> That's a little loud, but okay.<eos> Ready.
I'm not sleeping with her now.<eos> I was pregnant with Grace.<eos> Were you sleeping with her then?<eos> Alicia, listen to me:<eos> I will do nothing to embarrass you.<eos> These weren't taken by me.<eos> You think I give a crap, enough to follow you?<eos> They were taken by another campaign.<eos> They're gonna use this against me.<eos> And you.
Somebody help me, please!<eos> Sit right here.<eos> There you go. Easy.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay. Now, how far apart are your contractions?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God! I can see.<eos> I can see! I'm not blind!<eos> I'm not...<eos> Oh, my God.
Where do you store that thing?<eos> Inside the Snow Queen?<eos> Uh, let's see if we can enhance the image.<eos> Congratulations, you're pregnant.<eos> Congratulations, you are under arrest.<eos> I am assuming there will be no charge.<eos> I have dedicated my entire career to helping women get pregnant.<eos> Or, by helping them think that they are pregnant.<eos> Doctor, what happens when you dose anybody with HCG?<eos> Even a male jockey?
Fine, I was going out to smoke.<eos> Your lame system-reboot thing didn't work.<eos> You know, I don't like to talk about this, but many years ago, I myself overcame an addiction.<eos> I could not get enough of the ponies.<eos> Go, Razzmataz.<eos> Go, Razzmataz. Go, Razzmataz.<eos> (Sports announcer) It's Bugle Boy, winning by a head.<eos> I lost everything.<eos> What worked for me was replacing my bad addiction with a good addiction...<eos> Exercise.
All right, what's the plan?<eos> This dong is ready to ding.<eos> What?<eos> TAC team one will take the north entrance.<eos> TAC team two will take the east door.<eos> Jake, you stay out here and man the radio.<eos> Oh, sure, whatever you need. On it.<eos> No, I'm just kidding, you're coming in with us.<eos> Jerk.<eos> (Rosa) Ready?
Come!<eos> There's my Dinah!<eos> And my golden boy...<eos> Joseph.<eos> Welcome back, father.<eos> "Golden boy," huh?<eos> Golden boy.<eos> Levi, Simon, help Reuben unload the grain.<eos> Oh! Look!<eos> Oh, Joseph.
I cannot stay long.<eos> How is it that you're here at all?<eos> A dancer in Egypt.<eos> My grandmother...<eos> Rebecca is still alive, and she would have me executed if she ever found me.<eos> You ran away?<eos> As far as I could.<eos> Just like you.<eos> Dinah, I am truly sorry for what your brothers did to you.<eos> And to Joseph.

Oh... I'm out of practice.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> My mother's name was Leah.<eos> One day, when Rachel was fetching water...<eos> You can wait here if you'd like.<eos> I'll get you some wine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Joseph...<eos> Dinah?<eos> Joseph.
- Yeah, but...<eos> Oh, yeah, hey, can you give us some directions?<eos> Our friend Beatrice is trying to take us to Adelaide of the pasture, the good woman of the woods.<eos> - She can help us get home.<eos> - You don't need directions, pilgrim.<eos> - You follow that compass inside your heart.<eos> - Uh...<eos> - No, I think we need directions. - Go save your friend and get yourself home!<eos> - Beatrice!<eos> - Pilgrim!
But you ruined everything, Charlie.<eos> No, you ruined Huck's whole life.<eos> I guess maybe I could un-ruin it.<eos> How?<eos> I have these files on B613, all the stuff we did.<eos> I got orders to steal them from this storage locker, replace them with blanks.<eos> I was supposed to give them all back to command, but I kept a few for myself, you know, as insurance.<eos> You think it'd help?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, baby.
Why don't you stay here with me?<eos> I would, but I'm allergic to coconuts.<eos> Come home soon.<eos> I don't care how many anti-bacterial micro-fungal pro sanitizers you use, you couldn't pay me to play that thing with my mouth.<eos> Yeah, well, lucky for you, you don't know how to play.<eos> Dry cloth?<eos> Do you not feel, like, slightly odd about keeping it?<eos> No, Marlon misused her, and it is my duty as a musician to look after her.<eos> Wet wipes.<eos> - Her?
Goodnight, Sibelius.<eos> Sleep well.<eos> Ciao.<eos> It's about fucking time.<eos> What happened to all our shit?<eos> What shit?<eos> - The desk and the gramophone and the...<eos> - I gave it to Mike.<eos> - Oh. Cool.<eos> Why?
I know you didn't go.<eos> Eliza, you missed out on an incredible opportunity to meet other women in your field, seasoned vets who could've provided valuable insight, one of whom could've served as a future role model for you.<eos> I thought you were my role model.<eos> Me?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Mentor, possibly.<eos> Advisor, certainly.<eos> - Sensei?<eos> - Of sorts.<eos> - Elder.
Alpha bitch...<eos> Corynn McWatters.<eos> Back in the day,<eos> Corynn was smoking hot and insanely popular.<eos> But judging by Lindsay Lohan, Debbie Gibson, and J.T.T., teenage popularity does not age well.<eos> And I was guessing Corynn would be no different.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> She's...<eos> Not exactly what I had in mind.<eos> But why?
How is she?<eos> She's good.<eos> None of her family members came to claim her.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> When I was a kid, my old man and my grandfather used to tell me all their cop stories.<eos> Somewhere around age eight or nine, I just decided I really didn't want to hear them anymore.<eos> I decided I'd rather be the guy out there making my own cop stories.<eos> That's why I became a cop.<eos> Anyway, you asked why I became a cop, and... now you know.<eos> Delightful.

That's what the "Dee" stands for.<eos> Delightful.
The hell are you doing?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm checking out the, uh, gambling site that Brooks was using.<eos> I know. Someone placed a bet on the first football player to tear his ACL next season. It's insane.<eos> Unbelievable, right?<eos> Crazy.<eos> So are we active members yet on the site?<eos> Angela hacked into a member's account and sent me an invitation, vouching for me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me.
What connection does she have to the man who killed Father in a joust?<eos> And why are you hunting a man who Father pardoned himself?<eos> It was an accident.<eos> You think there's more to it.<eos> Stop it.<eos> You don't want to dig into this.<eos> Why not?<eos> Do you think someone hired Montgomery?<eos> Father's madness, his obsession with England, threatened everyone.<eos> Even you.
That'S It.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Seriously?<eos> - That Was Your Third Strike.<eos> - So That Means I-I Can'T Come To Class Anymore?<eos> - Oh, You'Ll Never Set Foot In The School Again.<eos> - Gary...<eos> I Don'T Know How To Thank You.<eos> ¶ ¶<eos> Incredible.
All in all, DeMasi's word against yours is sounding pretty good.<eos> Gonna sit there, or are you gonna help me?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Watson has impressed upon me that I owe you an apology.<eos> You may have noticed I've been keeping you rather busy lately.<eos> Some of the errands were... beneath you.<eos> You were very clear about all of this in London.<eos> You told me that there'd be scut work, every now and again.<eos> I'm aware of the young man at the coffee shop.<eos> Zachary.
His name is Cameron Robbins. I met him at a party.<eos> He said he needed the work, he had a good resume, so I paid him to help me out.<eos> And did you and this ghostwriter get romantic?<eos> We spent a lot of time together, going through old photo albums, e- mails, letters.<eos> We got close, but it was never serious.<eos> It was all business.<eos> What about after the book was finished?<eos> I paid him, and we went our separate ways.<eos> And you never told anyone about the ghostwriter, not even your editor?<eos> No, especially not my editor.
Would you like to hear our specials?<eos> No!<eos> Pizza!<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> You want me to have sex with another man?<eos> Oh, not just any man, Lois.<eos> This is Jesus we're talking about.<eos> He's a savior.<eos> He could even save our marriage.<eos> Why?
You dirty bastard! Look at him!<eos> Seriously!<eos> Dae-yoon, go make us some coffee.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did he jizz on my shirt?<eos> He's still a baby.<eos> I feel so dirty.<eos> First time's always the same.<eos> INSPECT HER GADGET<eos> Director.
He's weird.<eos> He keeps laughing.<eos> Look, he's laughing as he talks.<eos> The killer is one of you, so look uneasy.<eos> Ready, action!<eos> I'm so sorry!<eos> As you were!<eos> Let's go one more time!<eos> -Roll camera?<eos> -Ready!
The last person to take money out of the account in Caracas was an Iranian national.<eos> She signed in as Marie Porter, but her real name is Samila Mahdavi.<eos> She's a known affiliate of VEVAK.<eos> The Iranian Foreign Intelligence Ministry.<eos> So the lead goes overseas.<eos> And straight to the government of Iran.<eos> And there go the peace talks.<eos> It's time for you to hand this off, Bess.<eos> To the people who really should be handling it...<eos> Munsey.
Hey. Check this out.<eos> Huh. Looks like we found our kingpin.<eos> Blue.<eos> The Gary brothers.<eos> Judge Lachlan sends them to prison but you forged the order of incarceration papers and gave them probation instead.<eos> That's how you were able to get the paperwork on our wire tap.<eos> You see what we're up against in this city everyday, and you see the victims firsthand in court.<eos> So tell me how a lifelong civil servant decides to work for the other team, and gets into the heroin game.<eos> You know what else I see firsthand?<eos> Corruption.
Dear Dad, Merry Christmas Eve.<eos> Because we usually end up saying the wrong things when we talk, in lieu of presents this year,<eos> I'm writing a letter.<eos> Even though a blank page and a conversation with you can be equally scary,<eos> I am a published novelist.<eos> I want to tell you about an unusual case<eos> NCIS had last week, a case that reminded me of you because it was about rules.<eos> And, in hindsight, it's helped me realize a few things.<eos> About you.
No, you said no gifts under $100.<eos> Oh, did I?<eos> Gimme.<eos> It's just a little something from your supercool guncles. Okay!<eos> There is a lot of pressure when one is a gay uncle...<eos> Or guncle.<eos> ...giving a gift to a niece as hip and chic as Haley.<eos> In the 10 years that we've been together, we've only missed the mark one time.<eos> Yeah, when Claire told us what to buy, but we learned our lesson -- ignore Claire and trust our gay instincts.<eos> Or "ginstincts." Too much.
Will you stop saying, "we will find a way"?<eos> What way? What...<eos> Where is this way, huh?<eos> Babe, I'm just trying to be positive.<eos> But positivity doesn't put money in the bank account.<eos> What about that $20 check that I got from the utne reader for my poem "everything is super great"?<eos> If we were to have a financial setback tomorrow, what would be your plan?<eos> - We'd find a w...<eos> - Don't say "way."<eos> ...path.
Wowzers!<eos> I do like that, in a slightly Richard Hammondy sort of way.<eos> Is that a Mach One?<eos> It certainly is. Ho-ho-ho-ho!<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Tell me that isn't magnificent... ..<eos> ly boring. It isn't.<eos> I'm glad it's grey, though.<eos> Why?
No, but we're good at building bridges.<eos> We can do that.<eos> No, it's a figure of speech.<eos> It doesn't literally mean build a bridge.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> It says,<eos> "When you arrive in Ushuaia, you must build a football stadium "and host a game of car football against a team from Argentina." Really?<eos> So we're using our cars in car football?<eos> Mine's a bit big.<eos> Against a team, right...
I'd love to buy you a latte.<eos> Sure.<eos> Robert: I don't get it.<eos> There's no white light, no warm glows.<eos> Where are the heralding angels?<eos> You know, I haven't heard one trumpet.<eos> Not one trumpet.<eos> I'm so tired.<eos> I need to sleep, but I can't.<eos> Why?
What are they doing to him?<eos> Among other things, his brain is producing excessive cortisol.<eos> [sighs] No wonder he went crazy.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I'll have to go in and operate and reposition his implants.<eos> Okay, let's go tell him.<eos> Alex, our patient's unconscious.<eos> No...<eos> Dr. MacLeod.<eos> Oh, him.
She's blocking it, just like you are.<eos> See you on top of the mountain, Charlie.<eos> Dana, what you said to me earlier was totally out of line.<eos> It was... it was outrageous.<eos> I was just trying to help you and your daughter.<eos> [sighs] Apology accepted.<eos> Let's move on.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> Come here.<eos> Why?
You don't... you don't... you don't have to do that.<eos> - We got him. - Nick.<eos> - Nick. No.<eos> Now Odin wants to spill blood.<eos> Well, then, okay then.<eos> Okay then?<eos> With me, warriors?<eos> Gloves off, eh?<eos> Santa is sorry.<eos> Unbelievable.
Well, this is a tough one.<eos> Not proud of this.<eos> I set your vintage Corvette on fire.<eos> I never owned a Corvette.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay, I'm gonna have to track that guy down.<eos> Wow! I should have done this years ago.<eos> I feel great.<eos> Like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.<eos> Yeah, good for you.

She's already impressed, isn't she, Derek? Yes.<eos> There's no harm in making an effort, make a girl feel not taken for granted.<eos> Yeah, definitely.<eos> Exactly. Yeah.<eos> Do all the hard work now, snare a decent bird while you still can and then you can relax and let yourself go.<eos> That's what I intend to do.<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> You intend to let yourself go, when you've snagged a decent bird?<eos> That's what I just said, baby.<eos> Unbelievable.
That's right. I'm a matchmaker and my family is...<eos> Do you want to introduce us to someone?<eos> That's not it but the woman I want to introduce you is...<eos> So I said when will you bring a lady to introduce to Yong?<eos> Mother.<eos> We don't know each other well.<eos> Calling me mother is too much.<eos> Mother. Why are you calling me that?<eos> Actually the woman I'm going out with now is here.<eos> Oh my God!
Sir, I need her full name.<eos> – None of us knew her before tonight.<eos> You need to wait here.<eos> She's got no identification on her no, nothing.<eos> Yeah, well she probably didn't wanna make identification easy.<eos> She likes things, you know... difficult.<eos> Uhm... Hospital, not a fan. Good drugs, though.<eos> Late for something?<eos> No I just, have to make sure I'm home to make Matty some breakfast.<eos> - Matty?

Every time, ma'am.<eos> Now where's the real action?<eos> Baby, you don't want to know. I do want to know.<eos> Whatever you say, boss.<eos> Back of the bar.<eos> It's your funeral.<eos> They'll eat you alive back there.<eos> I'm a pretty tough chew. Come on.<eos> Would you kiss it this time?<eos> Hey there, Marcie.
Nancy! Nancy!<eos> And the dealer will take two.<eos> One hand in.<eos> I'll play.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> I fold.<eos> I'm done.<eos> How dumb are you feeling now, boy?<eos> Pretty dumb.
- A sphere.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> A spherical hole.<eos> But who put it there?<eos> Who do we have to thank?<eos> I'm not thanking anybody until we get out of here in one piece, Rom.<eos> Any trick to this, Doyle?<eos> No one knows.<eos> The others made it, right?<eos> At least some of them.
He's a robot.<eos> So you don't have to ask him to do anything.<eos> - Sorry, you broke up a little bit there. It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.<eos> It's our only chance to save people on Earth.<eos> If I can find a way to transmit the quantum data I'll find in there... they might still make it.<eos> Let's just hope there's still someone there to save.<eos> Maximum velocity achieved.<eos> - Main engine ignition in three... two... one.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Ready.

This is the biggest house I've ever seen!<eos> It's the Palace of Versailles, home of Marie Antoinette.<eos> You know, she was mostly famous for one thing.<eos> Cake!<eos> I love cake so much.<eos> Marie Antoinette sure likes cake, Mr. Peabody.<eos> Indeed, she does.<eos> Marie was a woman with a prodigious appetite... for all things covered with frosting.<eos> But her expensive tastes made her the target of much criticism.<eos> - Why?
- Exactly!<eos> - I know.<eos> But what was I supposed to do?<eos> Mr. Peabody died in ancient Troy.<eos> Died?<eos> I have a hard time believing that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> For starters, both Shermans can't stay here.<eos> Why?
But the way we had it, you know?<eos> When it came out of him, it's...<eos> You know?<eos> Really hard.<eos> Come on, let's give these guys some privacy.<eos> - You know, we laugh about it.<eos> - Babe, I can't just...<eos> - Doug, come on. - You know, back in those days? We laugh about all that, but... it was pretty tough business.<eos> - I'm so sorry. - No, what?<eos> About what?
No!<eos> Mitch talks a blue streak about how good you're doing.<eos> Must be nice for y'all to have Christmas together, ain't it?<eos> It is.<eos> - What do I owe you?<eos> - No, come on.<eos> Merry Christmas now, Boyd.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> - Merry Christmas!<eos> - Merry Christmas!
- Get out!<eos> - I'm not getting out.<eos> I'm staying right here. I'm gonna make my confession.<eos> This is a house of God. You're a representative of him.<eos> - I'll do it right here.<eos> - Get up.<eos> Forgive me, father, for I have sinned.<eos> - It's been one day... - Get up. I said let's go!<eos> I'm sorry. Here.<eos> Sorry, father.
Sir, do you know Krrish?<eos> I believe in Krrish.<eos> I believe that... we all have the essence of Krrish In us.<eos> Every person, who uses their abilities to help others... who extends a helping hand selflessly... who stands by those In need... ls, Indeed Krrish.<eos> We all have Krrish In us.<eos> Even I am Krrish.<eos> Krrish told when leaved a pigeon.<eos> He also gave me this symbol.<eos> Even I have one.<eos> Me too.
Who is angry? My sister Meagan.<eos> - Please be quiet!<eos> - Ow him angry.<eos> - Yes, he's always angry. - Why?<eos> Mom says it's because of excessive hormones.<eos> What is it?<eos> I do not know, he's a teenager.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, he will not get angry if his wish.<eos> Why?

You get!<eos> You do not survive.<eos> Hey, let me take a picture, Henry.<eos> Say Cheeze.<eos> Give me 2.<eos> Good.<eos> I can not believe you got Blation Billboard.<eos> Cody, this has to be the best day.<eos> Oh. School teachers exactly like me.<eos> - Thanks to you.
There is an alliance between the Orcs of Moria... and the sorcerer in Dol Guldur.<eos> Are you sure of this?<eos> Packs have been seen... gathering there.<eos> Each day, more and more come.<eos> What do you know of this sorcerer?<eos> The one they call the Necromancer.<eos> I know he is not what he seems.<eos> Fell things are drawn to his power.<eos> Azog pays... homage to him.<eos> Gandalf.
But he would not listen.<eos> You are just like him.<eos> Stay here if you will... and rot.<eos> A hundred years is a mere blink... in the life of an Elf.<eos> I'm patient.<eos> I can wait.<eos> Did he offer you a deal?<eos> He did.<eos> I told him he could go IskhkhakfreAndurukNu!<eos> Him and all his kin!
He is summoning his servants.<eos> Azog the Defiler... is no ordinary hunter.<eos> He is a commander.<eos> A commander of legions.<eos> The Enemy is preparing for war.<eos> It will begin in the East.<eos> His mind is set upon that mountain.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To rejoin the others.<eos> Gandalf.
So romantic.<eos> Good luck in Chicago.<eos> You think just because someone... sends me a rose, I'm just going to fly off to whatever town he's in?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> According to my mother, you're not a lady unless you're married... on or before your 30th birthday, and you're not a woman until you've had at least two kids.<eos> If you Te not a lady and you Te not a woman... you're like my best friend, Gail.<eos> Warm nuts?<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> I got your nuts all messy.<eos> Sorry about that.
For to whatever fate God's will may do me<eos> I love thee, dear I love thee, dear<eos> I love thee now and for eternity<eos> I love thee now and for eternity<eos> You fancy a drink?<eos> Champagne, please.<eos> Back in a flash, Mrs Potts.<eos> Why, thank you very much, Mr Potts.<eos> Did I ever tell you how I fractured Gareth Edwards' clavicle?<eos> - The Gareth Edwards?
You don't know women.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Look, Billy, you don't know women the way I know them.<eos> You haven't shared a full life with anyone.<eos> You don't know what that is.<eos> You can't tell a woman who to love.<eos> Especially Sophie.<eos> You can't do it.<eos> I know what I had with my WIFE, Billy.<eos> Thanks to you.
It's all I've got!<eos> Gary.<eos> You need help, Gary.<eos> I got help.<eos> You know what help was?<eos> Help was a lot of people sitting in a circle talking about how fucking awful things had got.<eos> That is not my idea of a good time.<eos> And this is?<eos> They told me when to go to bed.<eos> Me!
Ron. You walked out on me.<eos> What did you expect me to do?<eos> Ron. This is awkward, I know.<eos> I'm sitting here with your wife.<eos> We make love. I'm this close to shooting a flare gun at your dick.<eos> Oh, Ron!<eos> So what does this Gary do for a living, huh?<eos> Have you done a background check on him?<eos> Gary is actually one of the most successful psychologists in all of Manhattan, Ron.<eos> Really sweet.
Tony Danza's scrotum!<eos> Well, that'll do it for all of us here at GNN.<eos> Thank God for the events, thank me for the news.<eos> I'm Dick Phuc.<eos> We're going to get crushed in ratings.<eos> I really thought we had a chance this time.<eos> What about my "Death From Above" story?<eos> You better ask Ron about that.<eos> We're pulling that story, Brian.<eos> What?
- What do we want?<eos> - Justice!<eos> - When do we want it?<eos> - Now!<eos> - What do we want?<eos> - Justice!

You hear that?<eos> It's the soundtrack of us going insane.<eos> Damn, I wish there was something we could do to help him.<eos> I know what we can do.<eos> The fuckin' stench.<eos> Jonah Hill?<eos> Jonah?<eos> Jonah Hill.<eos> Jonah Hill is no more.<eos> Demon?
Where the fuck did she go?<eos> David.<eos> Take it before she does.<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> David.<eos> Why are you hurting me?<eos> My face hurts.<eos> Why?
- don't you think?<eos> - Oh, you're such a loving man.<eos> Well, maybe I'll adopt you.<eos> I want you to take the money that you're earning... and buy a house here in Las Vegas.<eos> I'll co-sign. But it'll be in your name, so... you'll have some security.<eos> Would you like that?<eos> Lee... are you serious?<eos> I want to be everything to you, Scott.<eos> I want to be father... brother... lover... best friend.<eos> Everything.
No, I know, but we don't have any more cash.<eos> But...<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> So I'll take a check.<eos> Are you proposing to me?<eos> I just don't have a lot of ready cash available, so...<eos> I can't go to Lee, 'cause he doesn't want me taking it anymore.<eos> Well, that's silly.<eos> He wants you to stay skinny, doesn't he?<eos> Silly.
Where are you going?<eos> You know me now.<eos> I'm only good at beginnings.<eos> What, you're dropping out?<eos> Best of luck.<eos> Okay.<eos> My father showed up today with some new woman and in the middle of all the "Allen's a screw-up" monologue, all of a sudden, I realized I don't care.<eos> I've never not cared.<eos> So, I told them it was my idea to steal the boat.<eos> Why?
You should pretty much have it down by now, then.<eos> I had that one pegged.<eos> Didn't I?<eos> I mean, look at him, you can tell he's been married.<eos> I went outside to show Steve the old fort and it's torn down!<eos> That's been gone for years.<eos> I was so sad! What is this now? Our old fort, where we used to play..<eos> Cowboys and Indians.<eos> Daddy said rats were getting in there.<eos> Karen! Shame on you!
Oh God, Barbara!<eos> One thing about mom and dad. You have to tip your cap to anybody who can stay married that long.<eos> Karen. He killed himself.<eos> We don't know that, for sure.<eos> Is there something going on between you and little Charles?<eos> I don't know that I'm comfortable talking about that.<eos> Because, he's our first cousin.<eos> Give me a break. You know you shouldn't consider children.<eos> I can't anyway, I had a hysterectomy last year.<eos> - Why?
Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good morning, sir.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Hey, Louis.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Good. That woman whose son got killed... she's around doing speeches now. What's her name, honey?<eos> Mamie Till.<eos> Mamie...
Blew his wad all over my window!<eos> - He broke the window!<eos> - The, the... From the...<eos> Uh, his jizz is like a shotgun blast!<eos> You know that shiny stuff in his hair? It's not hair gel.<eos> - Lois!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> - Nice to see you! - Nice to be seen!<eos> Oh, my goodness!
High... over the city... our yellow... windows must have contributed their share... of human secrets... to the casual... watcher in the street.<eos> And I was him... too... looking up and wondering.<eos> I was within... and without.<eos> Enchanted and repelled... by the inexhaustible variety of life.<eos> You have got no right... to speak her name.<eos> Daisy, Daisy, Daisy!<eos> - You got no right to speak her name!<eos> - I'll speak her name whenever...<eos> - Oh, my God, you are crazy!<eos> - You whore!
If there's... anything that you want... just ask for it, old sport.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I will... rejoin you later.<eos> I expected him to be...<eos> - Old and fat?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Young men don't just drift coolly out of nowhere... and buy a palace on Long Island.<eos> He told me once... he was an Oxford man.<eos> However, I don't believe it.<eos> Why not?
In some ways, he still is.<eos> - You're of his blood.<eos> - I've seen where he's buried.<eos> In the royal catacombs?<eos> Sounds like you've been having some adventures of your own.<eos> - Am I in trouble?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> I want you to have adventures.<eos> - It'll make you a better queen.<eos> - How?
- But, sir.<eos> - Not now!<eos> You're in charge.<eos> Take care of Felix.<eos> Understood?<eos> Always remember.<eos> Faithfulness will be your shield as a thousand may fall and hide.<eos> But no evil may ever come near you with gold at your side.<eos> Trust no one.<eos> Except each other.
You know the Huntington Boys' Home, right?<eos> Hurting a fuck like you'd be a treat.<eos> Why don't you tell me his name?<eos> He didn't tell me his name.<eos> He came to me for a confession.<eos> He said he'd killed 16 children.<eos> He bragged about it.<eos> I convinced him to come back here.<eos> He said he'd kill more.<eos> Sixteen children?
Well, Kirk, it seems apt to return you to your crew.<eos> After all, no ship should go down without her captain.<eos> He's locking phasers on us, sir!<eos> Let us out of here now!<eos> Shields at 6%!<eos> The torpedoes! How much time, Lieutenant?<eos> Twelve seconds, sir!<eos> Crew of the Enterprise, prepare for imminent proximity detonation.<eos> What's he talking about? What detonation?<eos> The torpedoes.
That's not what I heard.<eos> There she is.<eos> Here's our star, huh? What'd I tell you?<eos> The girl next door. Linda, this is our financier, Anthony Romano.<eos> It's very nice to meet you.<eos> Sweetheart, let me tell you something. If what these guys are saying is true, this is gonna be the best investment of my life.<eos> I can't wait to see your work.<eos> Yeah. Oh, and this is Dolly.<eos> This is Linda's costar and makeup artist.<eos> A pleasure.
And what of this promotion, eh?<eos> A mere formality, I'm sure.<eos> Only champions can rewrite history, yes?<eos> Yes, I've always believed that it's the winning that's important, not the taking part.<eos> Only winners are more attractive to the opposite sex, Bruce, eh?<eos> Like our successful friend here, the tapeworm.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Who do we trust, Bruce?<eos> Why, no one, of course.<eos> Not your friends, not your family, not even yourself, Bruce.

Mama?<eos> You have to let them in.<eos> let them in.<eos> You don't listen.<eos> Did you ever think that maybe joyce was right?<eos> That maybe this isn't a disease, but maybe it's a gift?<eos> - Help us. - Those people in that chamber wanted to be found.<eos> That's what this has all been about.<eos> now they're free.<eos> Because of you.
Okay, well, then we're just gonna have to do it after they're asleep.<eos> Believe me, I hate these dentists.<eos> Want to know Merry Christmas I get from them?<eos> "Oh, Olga, we're going to fix your teeth so they look like teeth of Vanna White from 'Fortune's Wheel."'<eos> Do they ever fix Olga's teeth?<eos> No.<eos> They ski slalom in Hole of Jackson.<eos> Believe me, I hate these fucking dentists, but, yeah...<eos> You must have Russian blood.<eos> - Why?
You brought me here to steal a fucking piano?<eos> How much... how much do you love jail?<eos> No. Do you remember that Sorel job?<eos> It's gonna be easy.<eos> Remember that?<eos> We got the whole safe out.<eos> You are a dumb, dumb fuckhead.<eos> Find your own way home.<eos> I promised her one.<eos> Who?
What is this?<eos> God in Heaven!<eos> What?<eos> Dante?<eos> She is mine.<eos> No!<eos> I have come to take what was promised me... a soul meant for Heaven.<eos> It can't be true.<eos> Dante would never betray me.<eos> Beatrice!
No!<eos> This will not stop me!<eos> Nothing will stop me!<eos> No!<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> God, give me strength!<eos> Come with me, mortal, if you have the courage.<eos> Dante, don't let him take me!<eos> Beatrice!
Dante, don't let him take me!<eos> Beatrice!<eos> You will not keep me from my beloved!<eos> Dante, you lied to me!<eos> I trusted you!<eos> You've got to save me!<eos> Dante!<eos> I'm coming for you!<eos> I won't let him hurt you!<eos> Beatrice!
Have you lost all faith in God, O man?<eos> Has the way been so obscured?<eos> Heavenly Father, if only one soul should be saved, please let it be Beatrice.<eos> Help! Help!<eos> Dante, if you broke your promise to me, I'll be forever damned.<eos> Are you prepared to be judged in this place?<eos> Do you think you are without sin?<eos> Please, don't let him take me!<eos> Beatrice.<eos> Beatrice!
You know me.<eos> I am Ciacco.<eos> Gluttony was my offense, and here I remain mere skin and bones.<eos> Can you help me, free me from this agony?<eos> Please, please.<eos> Your suffering weighs heavy on my heart, spirit.<eos> Virgil, what's happening?<eos> How dare you free the damned?<eos> They deserve torment for wasting their fleeting precious lives.<eos> And Beatrice?
You don't know what you're doing!<eos> I thought I knew many things.<eos> I thought love was real, but it was only an illusion, a fraud.<eos> There is nothing left for me in all of God's crwation.<eos> Yes, my love.<eos> In union, all of Hell's power will be yours.<eos> Beatrice, don't do it!<eos> When you had your way with that girl, you gave me to Lucifer.<eos> It was all because of you.<eos> Beatrice!
Should have listened.<eos> I been...<eos> I been in a lot of wars, but never one like Bosnia.<eos> That war got into my head.<eos> I saw it like a poison.<eos> I just wanted it to stop.<eos> I thought maybe killing a few of the worst ones would make it go away.<eos> So I pulled the trigger.<eos> Just like that I became everything I hated about that damn war.<eos> Everything.
- I read that too.<eos> Crazy.<eos> Awful people.<eos> Really.<eos> Um, this is actually me here.<eos> Oh.<eos> Right.<eos> Um, well, hey, I had a really good time talking to you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me too.
My boyfriend will be worried about, um, what happened to me, so, you know, call me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you very much. Um...<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice meeting you.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> I had a good time talking to you.<eos> Yeah. Me too.
Gets to finish this here bottle.<eos> Come on, you people.<eos> Up to the starting line.<eos> Molly, are you gonna participate in this one?<eos> No, I'm sitting out.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go.<eos> All right. All right. All right.<eos> Come on. Get ready.<eos> On your mark!
Good grief!<eos> Yeah. You wanted to start some shit?<eos> !<eos> You know I got the keys to this house! Yeah?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> This is my house!<eos> Hey!<eos> You want some more?<eos> Huh?<eos> Fuck you!
What are you doing here?<eos> I thought a change of scenery might help.<eos> Change.<eos> Wasn't your last planet completely covered by water?<eos> It's been a week since you've had new information.<eos> Do you know where they are?<eos> If you can't say no, say nothing.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Do you pity them?<eos> The humans?
If our memories are still alive, are we?<eos> You gotta believe some people wouldn't go down without a fight.<eos> Hell, I know I wouldn't go quiet.<eos> And I've never seen fight like in Mel.<eos> What she'd fight for, more than anything, is the people that she loves.<eos> I wonder if a love like that might play on someone's mind.<eos> Heart.<eos> It might get somebody to do something they wouldn't ordinarily do.<eos> Maybe you're here 'cause you do actually care about Jared and the kid.<eos> You.

What?<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> I went to call to the guy who runs the state's forensics lab.<eos> Dad, are you telling me you got your friend to set that fire to the lab?<eos> When the world comes for my son with the knives out, it's my job to stand in the way!<eos> Dad, the evidence you got burnt up could've saved me!<eos> How could you do it?<eos> She was one of the best people I ever knew!<eos> She was my favorite thing about you.<eos> Yeah, me too.
- You got him?<eos> I got him.<eos> Now, take it easy.<eos> Strap in for me.<eos> OK.<eos> May I keep stalking you?<eos> Good-bye, Conor.<eos> Look, just tell me how long...<eos> Look, I'll call you tomorrow, and we'll... talk through the...<eos> logistics.
What do I owe you?<eos> Your money's no good here.<eos> You know that.<eos> OK.<eos> Business is good?<eos> It's great.<eos> We're closing.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
You did a great job.<eos> But we only have 22 spots to fill, so please stand up when I call your name.<eos> First up is Do Knock.<eos> DO KNOCK:<eos> Yes!<eos> Anis.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hey, let me hear my name.<eos> Sniper.<eos> Oorah, yeah!
Take that, bitch! That was-- served by Eric the Enchanter.<eos> What?<eos> You just let her get away.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> She just went off into the woods to die like a wounded animal.<eos> Gimme the book.<eos> Fuck!<eos> God.<eos> This is the "Sigillum Aemeth." Where did you get this book?<eos> Uh, why?
He was lucky to have a long life. Such a caring daughter.<eos> All he cared about was his family.<eos> Surely there's no other reason for being on this Earth.<eos> What would you do if you couldn't have children?<eos> I would pray to God to send them to me.<eos> What if you don't believe in God?<eos> Maybe that's why you can't have children.<eos> Honestly, Ben, you really fucked me here.<eos> My independence of mind is obviously a threat to them. - Them?<eos> - Society.
I tell you a secret.<eos> I'm probably more afraid than you are, right now.<eos> How can that be?<eos> Because I've seen enough blood and death. I know what's coming.<eos> I want you to ask Washington... to get us real time satellite imagery of the area... surrounding Sommerton.<eos> You know, if this sheriff is right... and we've got a hundred federal agents standing around... Los Algodones crossing... with their dicks in their hands, for no reason.<eos> What's the fastest way to get there?<eos> We can charter a jet out of McCarren.<eos> Do it.<eos> Ready?
Promise me you won't tell a living soul?<eos> I won't, i swear it.<eos> Ahh. Okay, one last time.<eos> Try it again.<eos> That is so cool.<eos> I'll let you know when to do it, sugar.<eos> You'll hear me loud and clear.<eos> Just like you always do.<eos> You have no idea how much i just love you to death right now.<eos> Ready?
He's dead.<eos> They're fucking dead!<eos> The gate, the gate needs to open!<eos> Give it time to open!<eos> We got to go.<eos> Fuck the gate!<eos> Buckle up!<eos> What happened?<eos> The car stopped.<eos> Why?
What are you?<eos> Man, it must be nice to sleep.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> I wish I could dream.<eos> But that's not really an option for me.<eos> The dead don't dream.<eos> This is as close as we get.<eos> You sure about this, son?<eos> Welcome, then.<eos> Sorry for your loss.

All right, I think we're safe now.<eos> We should really get going.<eos> As you wish.<eos> Well, I didn't know a guy could scream that high pitched.<eos> - Isn't that weird?<eos> - He is so funny.<eos> Bye, S.T.E.V.E..<eos> You're the best time machine I've ever met.<eos> Goodbye, Jenny.<eos> Oh, Reggie...
- You're The Great Turkey!<eos> Which means Jake was telling the truth the whole time!<eos> Wow, I really am an idiot!<eos> I hate to say I told you so.<eos> Wait, if I am idiot then you're an idiot.<eos> No, no, guys, guys, guys, technically, we're all idiots.<eos> - But we're also all...<eos> - The Great Turkey!<eos> My mind is being literally blown right now!<eos> Mine, too!
More tricks? After everything.<eos> How dare you defy us!<eos> Dare?<eos> How dare you, wicked sisters?<eos> No one defies Oz!<eos> Guards. Destroy him.<eos> Forward!<eos> Guards! Come back here this instant!<eos> You thought you could kill me?<eos> Me?
It's just high school. Who gives a shit.<eos> You should be out there in the real world.<eos> Making it a better place.<eos> - Dave, I can't.<eos> - I know, you promised your dad.<eos> But he's not here anymore.<eos> This is your life. You got to live it.<eos> How am I supposed to face them tomorrow?<eos> I'm so embarrassed.<eos> Why?
I am gonna shit on everything that he loves.<eos> Let's trash this place, guys.<eos> Miranda Swedlow.<eos> Who's that, Sal?<eos> She one of the whores on your team?<eos> Night Bitch.<eos> All snuggled up to Kick-Ass.<eos> Looks like our boy's got a new hot pocket!<eos> Want me to kill his dog?<eos> The dog?
Are you really that stupid?<eos> There's two of you, and a whole army of us.<eos> Do you really have such a hard-on to die?<eos> No, that's why we brought our friends.<eos> What's the matter, Chris?<eos> Shit hit your shorts?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'm gonna wipe my ass with your face.<eos> You're gonna pay for what you did to my dad.<eos> Your dad?
'How can it be that the gods... overlooked this along at some amongst men and those very good men, ... who have had the most... intercourse with the divine.'<eos> please, keep on going.<eos> 'If it is so that we only live a small part of the life that is within us, What happens to the rest?<eos> '<eos> Hello, Dr. Gregorious.<eos> I'm afraid, your book on Persian grammar book hasn't yet arrived.<eos> No, that's not why I came...<eos> Do you know that book?<eos> Indeed, I sold it to someone yesterday.<eos> A woman?
To this day I never found out what secret bound those two together, and what it had to do with Amadeu.<eos> My brother is not here.<eos> I know.<eos> Go away.<eos> I know what happened, had an aneurysm.<eos> It's in the book.<eos> How do you live with that: knowing that at any time a bloodvessel could burst, flooding your brain with blood?<eos> I only found out after, once I discovered his writings.<eos> He never told anyone.<eos> Not even me.
Hey, that's me.<eos> - They say the camera adds 10 pounds.<eos> - What's your excuse for the other 20?<eos> Do me a favor?<eos> Save the verbal jousting for a more important time.<eos> I'm about to lay something huge on you.<eos> I got a company that wants the rematch.<eos> December 15th, Palace Theatre.<eos> - They want to pay each of us 75 grand.<eos> - Each of us?
- You're not training this guy.<eos> - It was my idea.<eos> Don't get mad at him.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - BJ, I'm serious.<eos> What's the point of telling me if you don't want me interacting with him?<eos> Interacting's one thing.<eos> Working with is another.<eos> - Why?
It's okay, Dad.<eos> You can still call me Becky.<eos> It's... it's really nice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Big change.<eos> I know that you are gonna make the most of it.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hi. Thank you.<eos> I gotta go help your mom.<eos> I...
Lock him up, lock up the son.<eos> Don't forget about the son.<eos> The kid gives me the creeps!<eos> Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.<eos> But, on the less crazy side of things,<eos> Gru discovered traces of the serum at Eagle Hair Club!<eos> Hmm, interesting.<eos> Yeah!<eos> And you know who made that happen? Huh?<eos> This guy.
We wish your sister, Fanny, well.<eos> Is it the Haymarket or the Phoenix Theater we've lost her to?<eos> The Haymarket.<eos> She's so sad not to be here.<eos> No, Nelly will give you a wonderful performance.<eos> I have no doubt.<eos> Now, Mrs. Ternan, Maria, you've met everyone on our previous rehearsals.<eos> Miss Ellen, may I introduce our family of actors?<eos> - We have Mr. Lemon.<eos> - Delighted.
- I'm from Wilmington.<eos> We used to come here quite a bit when I was a kid.<eos> Stayed for a few weeks, I loved it.<eos> My Uncle Roger, the guy that I work with at the store...<eos> - ...worked with him for a few weeks out of the summer... then when we got pregnant it just seemed like... it seemed like the right place to stay.<eos> Mighty Josh is crushing my castle!<eos> No!<eos> One, two, three!<eos> Now let's all do Josh's face.<eos> - Ready? - You ready?
OK, yeah, she's 16, but in real life she's, like, 18.<eos> No, in real life she's 16. That's the whole thing.<eos> And her Facebook photos are fucking awesome.<eos> Is that Cancun, where does she...?<eos> You know, there's always this moment right before I see you, where I'm like, "Why haven't I seen Miller in so long? It's ridiculous.<eos> I'm just kidding, man, come on.<eos> What if I said that about your sister? What if I was like, "I wanna fuck Danielle." What would you say?<eos> Dude, honestly, I would love for you to fuck my sister.<eos> - Really? Why?<eos> - Yeah.
She's nice.<eos> She's way too tall.<eos> I'd look like her son.<eos> Man, I'm tired of your excuses.<eos> Tonight's the night.<eos> What night is this?<eos> Tonight's the night I'm gonna get you some action, Ricky.<eos> Get some sweet, sweet action.<eos> I don't know about this, Sutter.<eos> Why?
Her motive is she wants to meet the guy again.<eos> Did I get it right?<eos> Oh, there's no right answer.<eos> Depends on what you're looking for.<eos> Why is that?<eos> You're testing me to see if I think like a sociopath.<eos> Sociopaths sometimes have trouble reading facial expressions.<eos> With the second test, I gave you the answer you were looking for... but, the fact is, that story has a flawed set up.<eos> The more logical outcome would be for the girl to kill her father.<eos> Why?
Call me, if you can't make a session.<eos> I will.<eos> You were right about her, she's smart.<eos> Special kid, lots of problems.<eos> What do you think are the underlying issues?<eos> Depression, bipolar disorder with deep-seeded narcissism.<eos> I'm gonna need her full file to know what memories to target.<eos> Parents don't want full disclosure.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
So you like being a nurse?<eos> I like helping people.<eos> You take your job quite seriously, huh?<eos> Well, if you can't do what you love, then at least make sure you love what you do.<eos> Isn't that what they say?<eos> They do say that, that is absolutely true.<eos> I think you're doing a great job with Anna.<eos> Thank you for your confidence.<eos> Sometimes I don't think I'm gonna be able to help her.<eos> Why?
He's been studying meteorology since pre-school.<eos> Don't let the Dahmer glasses fool you.<eos> These don't have any mesh, so you're going commando.<eos> Watch sitting.<eos> Your junk will fall out.<eos> Found that out the hard way at a birthday party.<eos> And like that you're impressed.<eos> And grossed out.<eos> Bye Lewis.<eos> Bye.
I knew this day would come.<eos> I'm gonna stay here in the booth no one comes to.<eos> Oh. No blood?<eos> They grabbed some cardboard from the snack shack and started going to town.<eos> Mostly B-boying.<eos> Power, Abstract, Blowup, Flavor.<eos> Mad moves though.<eos> Jackhammer, Applejacks, Coin drops, rubber bands, Turtles, 1990s.<eos> Any Jookin'?<eos> Buckin'?
Mom?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Bye, Roddy.<eos> Pop 'n Lock.<eos> Bye, Caitlin.<eos> Take care, Duncan.<eos> We're gonna miss you.<eos> Yes, I'm still here.<eos> Bye.
When they brought me to this country, there was less competition. And still, I didn't make it.<eos> You have nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing. Sensor alert.<eos> Front door.<eos> Please state your name.<eos> Colonel Hyrum Graff, Director of Training, International Fleet. This is my colleague, Major Anderson.<eos> May We?<eos> Why'd you keep kicking him?<eos> You'd already won the fight.<eos> - Did you enjoy it? - No.<eos> Then why?
We don't need you.<eos> Step aside.<eos> Go, Salamander! Go!<eos> Go! Go! Go!<eos> We gotta break them up.<eos> Fly, you lock with me.<eos> Petra rides chariot!<eos> - Got it? - Got it!<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Ready.
Are you scared of me, too?<eos> Mr Horse, are you scared of me?<eos> - He's bitten the bear.<eos> Ouch!<eos> Why did you bite me?<eos> You must be nice to me.<eos> Does Clara like me, too?<eos> Say goodnight to the bear.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> - And to the fox.
Women get fingered every day.<eos> It's not that big of a deal.<eos> You want some?<eos> Yeah, I want some.<eos> I'm such a goof.<eos> All over my shirt.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Did you just double wash? - Yeah.<eos> - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> - What? What?
- Be quiet.<eos> Come back, you coward, both of you!<eos> We're good.<eos> I want some more.<eos> You want some more!<eos> Everybody wants more and more?<eos> Did you guys see that?<eos> Totally rang his bell.<eos> And so the young Pachyrhinosaur frolicked and fritted away his youth.<eos> Why?
- Have fun?<eos> - No.<eos> - You beat my high score?<eos> - Yeah, look.<eos> Yeah, I love you, too, kid.<eos> So that kid from the other night, the one with the shadows.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - He drops a package off at my house filled with photos and lab reports of some crazy experiment from Camden College.<eos> - Well, you better make a copy.<eos> - Why?
We have a problem.<eos> Crackers aren't a problem, just a choice. - Come on. - What?<eos> - Come on!<eos> It's Fungus Bob!<eos> He followed me. I don't know how.<eos> Shit! Come on!<eos> Come on! - It's him?<eos> You're sure? - Sure, I'm sure!<eos> You don't think the two of us could kick his ass?<eos> Not this guy.
Someone has been buying a lot of Burke and Bailey's.<eos> Well, you tell whoever's buying it that our ice cream... may be the best, but it'll still melt in hell.<eos> - I'm calling the police.<eos> - No. No.<eos> Wait. I'll leave here first. Then I'll call 'em.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Hey, Bob.<eos> I guess when I began to out you, word somehow spread... and you became a liability to your partner and he had to kill you.<eos> Sorry about that.
We wanna start by thanking hilly Kristal.<eos> We'd to invite hilly up here.<eos> Hilly is the reason that we're here, that the Ramones are here, that blondie are here.<eos> He kept us alive.<eos> He fed us and he supported us in every way possible.<eos> He told us we needed to expand our sound, and he taught us a lot about ethics, about how to treat people.<eos> I'd like to thank hilly again.<eos> When we were starting out, there really weren't clubs where bands could play their own material, and, uh, poor hilly wanted to have a bluegrass bar on the bowery, and to have some other music as well.<eos> I guess the road didn't go that way. The road took another turn.<eos> And, uh, thanks to-
So, one January,<eos> I go to my friend's pool party in Long Island.<eos> Is that Duke Ellington on your bracelet?<eos> Yeah, as a matter of fact, it is.<eos> He died this year, you know?<eos> I know.<eos> I doubt anyone else here knows or cares about it.<eos> Well, I care about it.<eos> He saved my life many times.<eos> Mine, too.
But you can have the Sherman Suite.<eos> No, no.<eos> Stoddard, please.<eos> To go and get me some congressmen.<eos> My God.<eos> Go get some congressmen taking bribes.<eos> I want to pinch us some congressmen, okay?<eos> You come back to me, I'm proud of you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And Stoddard.
- Yes, he's fine.<eos> Thank goodness.<eos> Nelson, you know how much I love this statue, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You rode a horse three days through. Outer Mongolia in the pouring rain, living off of mare's milk to bring it back.<eos> That's right.<eos> And I've dragged it place to place, across the world, ever since I was 22.<eos> That is nothing, nothing compared to how much I love you!<eos> Please don't scare me like that again.<eos> Why?
It'll make you weak.<eos> - I can't protect you for much longer.<eos> - Dad, please.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wish you hadn't kept Layla a secret from me.<eos> I know.<eos> Your mum tells me how upset you are.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I wish she hadn't died, Dad.<eos> - Me, too.
- I can't protect you for much longer.<eos> - Dad, please.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wish you hadn't kept Layla a secret from me.<eos> I know.<eos> Your mum tells me how upset you are.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I wish she hadn't died, Dad.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> Me, too.
There must be something that you're working toward, right? This.<eos> - What do you mean, this?<eos> This brings me happiness.<eos> You know, and maybe, you know, in a week or maybe a year from now, it won't, but, you know, then I'll just move on to the next thing that does.<eos> - I think we're done, yeah.<eos> It's about time.<eos> You both draw or whatever. I remember when Kyle first -- hey, let's go.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Good luck. - Good luck to you.<eos> Yeesh.
It rolled and it picked up speed.<eos> A lot of rumors were made up and pure fantasies.<eos> The wildest story of all was that I was a CIA agent.<eos> And I was like, I couldn't really believe that anyone would believe such a weird story.<eos> From outside I can understand it must be a conspiracy.<eos> But, I was in the middle of it.<eos> Sorry to say it was not two girls in short skirts sent in from the CIA or whatever.<eos> They were just ordinary, nice girls admiring Julian and WikiLeaks.<eos> You've been very careful not to say anything.<eos> Why?
It normally takes awhile.<eos> I can't say I'm surprised, but I think this is a good thing.<eos> We'll make a date and you can go as me.<eos> - I'll give you more coaching.<eos> - Do you think that's ethical?<eos> Er, don't take this the wrong way, but I think it's unlikely you'll be able to get into an unethical situation on a first date.<eos> "Unethical," that's very sweet.<eos> When you're walking with a woman or standing next to one, you wanna put your hand on their lower back, not the ass... They sometimes get upset about that... but just above it.<eos> It shows you're interested, but you can push them down the stairs at any moment.<eos> - Why?
they say that things will be okay, that it just takes time, and life will go back to normal.<eos> But it's not true, ya know.<eos> Things can't be normal.<eos> They just keep going.<eos> Maybe that's good enough, ya know.<eos> Tyler?<eos> He's in the hospital.<eos> The doctors are doing the best they can.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> Your daughter.
What shall we put this in?<eos> Uh...<eos> I don't...<eos> Do you have big garbage bags or... or suitcases?<eos> Suitcases.<eos> CLERK". Et les valises?<eos> Do you need the suitcases?<eos> No. I don't need them anymore.<eos> So whatever happened to George Hamilton?<eos> Who?
I am the spirit of Delphi... speaker of the prophecies of Phoebus Apollo... slayer of the mighty Python.<eos> Approach, seeker, and ask.<eos> I heard there was a prophecy about me.<eos> Aye.<eos> But before you learn the future, know first the past.<eos> Long ago, before our time... before Olympus and the gods...<eos> Titans ruled the world.<eos> Led by Kronos... a force so evil, he devoured his own children.<eos> But three of his sons escaped.<eos> Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.
Right down to the dudes with power who only care about themselves.<eos> We need to find a bus station.<eos> First we need to get some money.<eos> Hey, there, valued half-blood account holder!<eos> Sign up for our new Aphrodite Express credit card, and you can...<eos> Can I get four venti half-caf no-whip lattes?<eos> And an extra shot of nectar.<eos> Nectar?<eos> If you haven't had, then you haven't lived, buddy.<eos> Hecatonshire.
Or is it that your unpaid bills are overdue?<eos> Enough talk. it's time for action.<eos> It's simple.<eos> You guys?<eos> Way up there, huh?<eos> Awesome.<eos> Let me get my calendar so I can time you.<eos> You got jokes, rookie?<eos> Laugh it up, garden snail.<eos> On your mark...
Thank you, plucky snail.<eos> Because of you, the whole world will be watching this race.<eos> And when the checkered flag drops, they'll be watching me win.<eos> Crawl home, garden snail,<eos> while you still can.<eos> Good afternoon, race fans, and welcome to this year's running of the Indianapolis 500.<eos> Televised in aver 200 countries and aired in 3.7 different languages, this is no longer just a race, this is the day you'll be telling your grandchildren about.<eos> Where were you the day they let a snail race in the Indy 500.7<eos> Okay, time to go.<eos> You ready?
I hear you got in some kind of trouble.<eos> I can handle myself.<eos> So why come here?<eos> I was hurt. There was a doctor.<eos> And now you're better.<eos> So you should go.<eos> You wouldn't like what you find here anyway.<eos> What?<eos> I said, you wouldn't like what you find here, anyway.<eos> Why?
Yeah, well, I thought you might want to take a look at this one right away.<eos> They guy looks like he had all kinds of muscular and skin deformities.<eos> And he was only wearing overalls.<eos> Get the fuck out.<eos> I know, right?<eos> Anyway, it looks like this one in particular might be-<eos> I don't know-a crucial component in all of this.<eos> Wait a minute. You don't think that- - I'm not saying shit, all right'?<eos> All I'm saying is that you might want to drop whatever you're doing and check this one over first.<eos> Awesome.
Ohhh!<eos> I feel so good about this, don't you?<eos> Take the rest of the day off, Lindsey.<eos> Get ready for tonight. Paint your toenails, trim your bush, bleach your asshole, douche, whatever.<eos> Eight hours, remember?<eos> Ohhh.<eos> Don't trim your bush too much now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Adieu, Lindsey, adieu.<eos> Bye.
I don't.<eos> So what'd you find out about Isabel?<eos> She doesn't come for food anymore.<eos> If you see her, give her this.<eos> Tell her she can come to me. Tell her she can be safe.<eos> - Who lives here?<eos> - Me.<eos> - Did you break in?<eos> - I fell. Did you hurt someone?<eos> Only myself.
OK .<eos> You want blueberry pancakes or macaroni and cheese ?<eos> Have breakfast blueberry pancakes .<eos> Eat .<eos> Jenson ...<eos> - What is it ?<eos> - Friend ...<eos> I'm sorry about Denise ,<eos> Really. You can think what you want , but sorry .<eos> Yeah, me too .
We sawflares !<eos> Are they okay?<eos> Our friend is hurt !<eos> - No, look . He's lying<eos> - What?<eos> They are without backpacks. How did you get so fast?<eos> - We're being followed .<eos> -I told you! They caused the explosions !<eos> - Who ?<eos> -The military !
I'm sure Squadron Command will be pleased that the device is operational.<eos> Of course.<eos> we'll send word to Fleet as soon as we reach our reporting point.<eos> Mr. Pavlov?<eos> I agree that Fleet will be pleased.<eos> Mr. Pavlov is one of the most diplomatic political officers in the Navy.<eos> - A contradiction in terms.<eos> - That's what I keep trying to tell him.<eos> I assure you that my intentions are purely that of the State and the party.<eos> thank goodness.
You are here just to make pretty pictures.<eos> Ivan:<eos> Vasja, you're too smart to be in charge.<eos> Let seryosha have his fun.<eos> We can always slit his throat later.<eos> Sasha:<eos> Alexei?<eos> Sasha?<eos> You want him to be in command?<eos> The fucking radio ham?
Alicia, he's being so nice to you.<eos> Gold star, Brink. Yeah, I like that he's being nice now.<eos> I'm always nice.<eos> You want this towel?<eos> Sure.<eos> Here, you can take my hand.<eos> Sara, I'm jumping after you.<eos> No, no, no. Sara, you're not jumping.<eos> We all are.<eos> What, why?
All right?<eos> Tell her I'm on my way.<eos> I need her to listen to me.<eos> Andrea?<eos> Damn it!<eos> I'm talking about hypersensitivity.<eos> About a lifestyle so aseptic... that it's left us without natural defenses.<eos> Marc!<eos> Come on, come on!<eos> Ready?
I left him standing up against the wall with his pants round his ankles looking stunned.<eos> Now, B's message wasn't exactly representational.<eos> She just had to be the tough one.<eos> It was directed at the men.<eos> It was about fucking, and about having the right to be horny.<eos> We masturbated together, that kind of thing.<eos> But it was rebellious.<eos> We weren't allowed to have boyfriends. No fucking the same guy more than once.<eos> You said you were rebellious. What did you rebel against?<eos> Love.
On that point...<eos> I failed.<eos> No doubt about it.<eos> Boys, now is the time to be alert, and ask all the questions your heart's desire.<eos> Because... I hope that you shall never have to encounter such people or be in such a situation ever again.<eos> Well, hmm? You don't have any questions?<eos> No?<eos> Well, I'll start, shall I?<eos> Approximately, how many lives... do you think she has time to destroy in one day?<eos> Five?
Joe!<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> Joe!<eos> Joe!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You should take a break.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Okay, don't worry.<eos> Just clean that up.<eos> Ready?
He had this old cow to balk on him. Couldn't get her to do nothing.<eos> He pushed and pulled and beat on her till she'd wore him out.<eos> Well, he went and borrowed Squire Helton's tractor and went back over there and throwed a rope over the old cow's head and took off on the tractor as hard as he could go.<eos> When it took up the slack, it liked to jerked her head plumb off.<eos> Broke her neck and killed her where she stood.<eos> Ask Floyd if he didn't.<eos> What is all this?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> The hell do you want, you son of a bitch?<eos> Where your clothes at?
You want a bath?<eos> Is warm.<eos> I help you.<eos> - I'm going in the back.<eos> - Hi, girlies!<eos> Glad to see you here.<eos> You look lovely.<eos> Anyway, this is it, and the bar.<eos> Come, I like you to meet the owner.<eos> Rosie? Yeah? Hello.
Now Ladies and gentlemen, we ask you to be very quiet.<eos> For the next trick, even the slightest break of concentration could prove to be fatal.<eos> Now I assure you this is an authentic straight jacket.<eos> - Used on the criminally insane. - Magda. - My mother thinks I belong in it.<eos> - Magda.<eos> - But I'm already strapped into this coffin. - Magda. What?<eos> I want you to secure it, and lock it... after I'm inside, of course.<eos> And then I want you to shoot your weapon at me.<eos> On my signal!<eos> Ready!
She was a hostess.<eos> Oh, she's a keeper, all right.<eos> So... Nicholas, what of our brother Santo, trapped in Castro's wretched jail?<eos> Well, I hear he's good.<eos> Oh. The Beard lets him order in his favorite dishes.<eos> But have you actually seen him?<eos> Mnh... not in months.<eos> So what brings you down to Miami?<eos> Not that it's not an absolute delight to have you here in my town.<eos> Why?
Kahn, do you know what distinguishes a German officer from other armies' officers? Well?<eos> He doesn't question orders, he follows them.<eos> That's precisely why the Wehrmacht is at the Volga and why it will soon reach India.<eos> Don't worry. I doubt you'll have to learn how to ride an elephant.<eos> Unh!<eos> These goddamn lice.<eos> Our men are scratching like monkeys.<eos> The Russians put ash in their soap.<eos> Ash?<eos> In the soap?
Then next day her bags are all packed... and we're telling Violet what's going to happen.<eos> So what did happen?<eos> He choked. He got on the airplane.<eos> Went back to his life.<eos> Turned his phone off and she never heard from him again.<eos> I move into another bedroom.<eos> She's waiting around for a phone call that never comes.<eos> And I turn into a...<eos> I lose my shit a little bit.<eos> So sorry. No.
He got five years, he was out in three months.<eos> It seems he just had a run-in with a prostitute.<eos> She told Anchorage Police the exact same story.<eos> - Why isn't this guy on our list?<eos> - That was 12 years ago.<eos> - If we open it up that much...<eos> - Get everything you can from archive.<eos> See if there are any other past offenses and check all missing persons from the same period.<eos> - Do you know anyone downtown... vice?<eos> - Yeah, one guy.
- Ooh!<eos> - Ooh!<eos> That one-eyed housewife called you out!<eos> When and where, PTA?<eos> What kind of glorked up drag strip is this?<eos> Möbius drag strip, man.<eos> Okay, no cops, no laws, no rules.<eos> Now here are the rules.<eos> Once around both same-sides of the half-twist and back to the starting finish line.<eos> Ready?
No, you're not!<eos> You've got to go on this delivery!<eos> But we've earned these days off.<eos> We're not cattle, we're human beings.<eos> You're human beings?<eos> Good Lord, you can't go on this delivery.<eos> Humans are forbidden on the Planet of the Primates!<eos> Okay, then.<eos> See you in a week!<eos> Buh-bye!
Praise Gilgamesh!<eos> So you started the fire?<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> Bender was thousands of miles away.<eos> I guess a welding torch is no way to catch a rat.<eos> This is coming out of your pay!<eos> Well, I'm back.<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> Looks like the building burned down.<eos> Yeah, thanks to this dope.
Incoming surface-to-air...<eos> Telegram!<eos> Pilot, is your parachute packed and ready?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Good, because I forgot mine.<eos> Mayday!<eos> I... landed the plane safely next to this naturally occurring fireball.<eos> At Disneyland.<eos> Hi, Tinker Bell.<eos> Ready.
If only there were a way to make Fry land softly, this would all be over.<eos> Ooh, I know!<eos> My airbag! Leela!<eos> I'm coming to save the day!<eos> Hang on, Fry!<eos> You're just one death away from being saved!<eos> And then we can be marry me?<eos> Okay, I'm gonna run out there.<eos> Then, you guys form a human bus and crash into me at 40 miles an hour.<eos> Ready?
This isn't about fighting.<eos> It's about killing.<eos> OCTB. That's the Hong Kong police.<eos> Right?<eos> Yes, call me.<eos> Ching-Sha.<eos> What?<eos> The heritage petition was rejected.<eos> Why?<eos> ! Why?
- Blue.<eos> - I use their essence to continue with my wonderful magic show here.<eos> That way I never have to bother you or Smurf Village again.<eos> I don't trust you, and I'm not telling you anything.<eos> Well, perhaps you need a little persuasion, eh?<eos> Naughties, attack!<eos> With pleasure.<eos> Attack!<eos> - No, no, no, not each other.<eos> - Not me!
Would you allow me to wish you a very, very happy birthday?<eos> It seems like only yesterday you were just my little glob of clay and other putrid ingredients.<eos> You remembered my birthday?<eos> Of course I did. We're family.<eos> - What?<eos> - But we're her family.<eos> - Families don't forget things like that.<eos> - Does she think we abandoned her?<eos> Speaking of which, your little blue step-papa never did arrive, now did he?<eos> Step-Papa?
This is clearly on your end.<eos> This is not me.<eos> Or I'll fix it.<eos> Where's the surf shop?<eos> Well, sir, it's in Winter Park, Florida.<eos> Florida?<eos> I'm in Colorado, you know, so...<eos> - Damn it.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Unbelievable.
Not a damn one.<eos> All's I know, if we get where we're traveling... we'll wish we'd died trying.<eos> Survival's not about certain death, it's about keeping your head down.<eos> Days ago, I was with my family... in my home.<eos> Now you tell me all is lost.<eos> "Tell no one who I am." That's the way to survive?<eos> Well, I don't want to survive.<eos> I want to live.<eos> Better off.<eos> Better than us.
I'm going home to New Jersey. I've not slept.<eos> You drive, right'?<eos> Well, as long as you drive and let me sleep, we can do it all the way, man.<eos> So, can I ship out?<eos> No, you cannot.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You're not on the roster.<eos> Okay. Well, can you put me on the roster?<eos> No, I cannot.<eos> - Why?
For all the goddamn broccoli that needs its nitrogen.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I'm not worried about it.<eos> Harmon.<eos> Hey, man. How you doing?<eos> Keeping my nose clean, you know.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> Well, you have a good day, brother.<eos> - You too.
I found them.<eos> Where did you find them?<eos> Downstairs, in the livingroom with all the books that you can read.<eos> So, what's in here, Nathan?<eos> Listen.<eos> I'm not trying to make an enemy here, ok?<eos> It's just... we can't bash the door in now.<eos> Everybody is trying to sleep.<eos> It's been a long night, and I think you should take a couple hours rest.<eos> All of ya.
Any press around, whatever, I don't want another CNN feature about me.<eos> And, Carter, don't fuck it up again, as in Korea and Vietnam, almost in the Second World War.<eos> You remember your father almost lost the whole war.<eos> No, sir.<eos> There won't be any problems.<eos> I assure you.<eos> Everything will go as planned.<eos> Okay, go back to your work, just forget it.<eos> And maybe I just push the red button and blow it all up.<eos> Bye.
General Carter's plans include our deaths, so here we are.<eos> I'm sorry we got you and Claire involved in this, Doug.<eos> Shit. I thought this was gonna be a nice, relaxing trip, but no, those goblin donkey fuckers...<eos> Always gotta mess with an honest man's piece of mind!<eos> Shit!<eos> If we're gonna die together, we might as well die with no hard feelings.<eos> Drink up, my friend.<eos> The amber nectar.<eos> I didn't have any hard feelings.<eos> Friend.
No Witnesses<eos> Hey, there!<eos> Hey, Jake!<eos> No!<eos> My dear vizier...<eos> The Chinese They pay 2 million euros for a tiger.<eos> And a million for a rhino.<eos> What do you think they're paying for a princess?<eos> Give me a reason!<eos> How about two?
You set a very high bar here, Harper.<eos> Look at that guy.<eos> Vibrant, handsome, hair.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> NYU just laid me off.<eos> Jesus Henry Christ.<eos> When it rains, it pours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I haven't told Robyn yet.<eos> Why not?
No, Murch.<eos> I appreciate you all.<eos> "In a world beyond the skies, children live a wonderful existence<eos> "before choosing their parents.<eos> "That's right. Children choose their parents.<eos> "But these aren't ordinary children.<eos> "They're Zodiacs.<eos> "Archer was a fearless Zodiac "who spied a couple in Harlem who for so long wanted a baby.<eos> "But no Zodiac had ever chosen them.<eos> "But why?
I-I can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You should go.<eos> Please.<eos> Go!<eos> Yes, but I don't see why that's needed.<eos> Well, that's what I'm asking.<eos> So, she'll be coming here.<eos> Fine.
It's bubble and peepaw.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Hello?<eos> Okay.<eos> One thing about Zombieland, you can never feel clean enough.<eos> O...kay!<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bubbie.<eos> Right.
I've seen you.<eos> You make it look so easy.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I've seen you with David.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Waiting for a cab.<eos> I'll be back Monday.<eos> It came up last minute.<eos> Call your Coach.<eos> What?
Okay. Where am I putting this?<eos> How does that feel?<eos> Does it feel alright?<eos> Someone please get the next one. 'Cause I am tapped out.<eos> Did they give you one of these reports to fill in?<eos> No.<eos> God!<eos> I hate paperwork.<eos> I'm Nolan, by the way.<eos> Abigail.
But, I need you. You know?<eos> I don't wanna do this without you.<eos> You have me.<eos> You always will.<eos> She is you and me together.<eos> You're not alone, Nolan.<eos> Abigail.<eos> She's listening.<eos> She recognizes your voice.<eos> Abigail...
Haven't decided.<eos> That's not a good look.<eos> 46 million.<eos> Changed their policy three days ago.<eos> Corso set us up.<eos> All right, Sands.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Tell them how it is.<eos> Tell who?<eos> Attorney General and Police Commissioner.
A bit grumpy-<eos> Him, I have a good feeling about.<eos> Crackerjack.<eos> Got any grass?<eos> That depends.<eos> Information is power, my friend.<eos> You see anyone take a photo up there?<eos> Already told.<eos> Already told who?<eos> Another guy.
And then he drowned.<eos> Can you get me access to his computer?<eos> That's a good looking car, man.<eos> I want to give you a hug.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's a favour I want, a request. Yes.<eos> I wouldn't ask if it wasn't absolutely vital.<eos> What?<eos> Don't see johnno.<eos> Why?
rahul this Rahul that...<eos> rahul...<eos> He was always there for me!<eos> My grandpa.<eos> Still RahuI... to go through fifty years of your life without parents... it's not an easy thing!<eos> Yes Meenamma, it is hard, but...<eos> Fifty years?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do I Iook like I'm fifty years old?<eos> Why?
But we pay well.<eos> We have money. It's not a problem.<eos> What is going on here?<eos> Are you on the run?<eos> I understand that it seems odd.<eos> - Well, there comes the old man.<eos> - We are a little lost. And we hope that it is possible.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Gunilla.<eos> - Nice.
Mind your own fucking business! Is it okay for you three to fight with only one?<eos> Heroes?<eos> Apply ice, or tomorrow your head will be swollen like a pig's.<eos> All right.<eos> I'd like to resume my post, to be a cop.<eos> You've always been a policeman.<eos> You're just undercover now. You've been doing well, learning how it works from the inside.<eos> Aren't you used to it?<eos> I'll quit.<eos> Why?
- Was she?<eos> Very nervy.<eos> Didn't like India at all.<eos> Odd girl.<eos> And the other one.<eos> I expect you heard the gossip.<eos> What was the gossip, Julia?<eos> He was writing his memoirs.<eos> She was taking dictation.<eos> - Who?
But I only ask about the boy Desmond.<eos> What was he like?<eos> Remarkable power of recall.<eos> The smallest details of his childhood were easy to surface.<eos> But lacking in self-confidence.<eos> I believe that he had an interest that was almost obsessional.<eos> In... I do not know who.<eos> A woman or an older man?<eos> A French woman, I believe.<eos> Zazie.
And Poirot, he has also a document for you.<eos> This is the deed of covenant for the legacy left to Desmond by his natural mother.<eos> The trust, it is to be administered by Madame Burton-Cox and her solicitor as trustees until...<eos> Until he reaches the age of 25 or until he marries, whichever is the earlier.<eos> So if he marries Celia, he'll come into a fortune.<eos> Oui.<eos> But how does this fit in with Mrs Burton-Cox wanting to know about the deaths of the Ravenscrofts?<eos> She is not concerned with the deaths of the Ravenscrofts, non.<eos> Her sole concern is to prevent the marriage.<eos> Why?
May I ask what happened to your face?<eos> My husband has difficulty controlling his temper.<eos> Sometimes I displease him.<eos> Well, sometimes I displease my loved ones.<eos> They don't hit me in the face when I do it.<eos> Who says I love him?<eos> We all have...regrets, Mr Waring.<eos> Regrets are the most forlorn and useless emotions, Mrs Clayton.<eos> One must insure against them.<eos> Elsie.
Ladies and gentlemen, step back, please.<eos> Monsieur. Monsieur.<eos> I trust the polizei will keep a sense of proportion about my involvement in er...<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes, I can hear you.<eos> C'est Poirot ici.<eos> Oui, Drouet is here and he is well.<eos> Lementeuil, tell to me what you can before the signal it fails.<eos> Oui.<eos> D'accord.
A bird with no tits and no ass?<eos> Dee, let us handle...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got one, I got one.<eos> Go, go, go, go, go, go!<eos> She looks like...<eos> Like a bird.<eos> That was it.<eos> Was that it?<eos> Ah...
I could go with "Winifred."<eos> That's because it's very good.<eos> This isn't Mr. Banks. This isn't... This isn't him.<eos> Uh, yes, that's Mr. Banks.<eos> But he has a set of mustaches.<eos> In the book, he has them.<eos> I told the illustrator I did not like the facial hair, but she chose to ignore me.<eos> Now this time around, this is my film, and I shall have my way.<eos> Mrs. Travers, this is a specific request from Walt.<eos> Why?
I'm calling to, uh... Well, to check up on you.<eos> I understand things didn't go so well today.<eos> Something about Mr. Banks?<eos> They went as well as they've gone on every other day that I've been here. I don't recall any special phone calls from you on any of those other evenings.<eos> Pam, what's this all about?<eos> I mean, really?<eos> I'm wondering what I have to do to make you happy.<eos> Oh. And you're wondering that, too, aren't you?<eos> You know, you've never been to Disneyland, and that's the happiest place on earth.<eos> Tommie!
- Oh, that's my mom.<eos> - Yup.<eos> - Can I take this one?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're gonna have it back in two weeks?<eos> - I guess.<eos> - All right. Perfect.<eos> Thanks, buddy.<eos> - Good playing.<eos> - You too.
That's fine.<eos> Well, fine for him.<eos> That's Mr. Fraser, our resident athlete.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> Electrical explosion.<eos> He was a railway signalman, whatever that is.<eos> Come on.<eos> He's obsessed with time.<eos> Well, being on time.<eos> On time for what?
To the money.<eos> Give me a day.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I really mean it.<eos> What are you hiding from, Patrick?<eos> Watching what?<eos> What do you know, Patrick?<eos> I don't need you to do that, Patrick.<eos> What have you been telling your boyfriend?<eos> Ed?
Thank you.<eos> I really mean it.<eos> What are you hiding from, Patrick?<eos> Watching what?<eos> What do you know, Patrick?<eos> I don't need you to do that, Patrick.<eos> What have you been telling your boyfriend?<eos> Ed?<eos> That fucking peacock on the radio.<eos> Brian?
Debra.<eos> Don't be afraid, child.<eos> No.<eos> Hello, mom, dad.<eos> Any word?<eos> - They've been delayed.<eos> - By the FBI?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm still looking into it. We'll have to be patient.<eos> Patient?
No.<eos> Sometimes it's good to keep your powder dry, Tosh.<eos> It's crowded up there.<eos> Just got the pathologist's report.<eos> You were right.<eos> Foul play.<eos> Tosh, check with the Norwegian Embassy.<eos> See if you can get a record of all the agents that used the Shetland Bus.<eos> And I want the names of all the men that went missing.<eos> Cassie.
Uncle Joseph!<eos> Sandy!<eos> When you found Mima's body, you said the landline was unplugged.<eos> That's right, isn't it?<eos> I think so.<eos> I noticed that when I went to call the hospital. I plugged it back in.<eos> Have you told anyone in the family about this?<eos> No.<eos> Are you sure.<eos> Nobody?

Hello, police!<eos> I'll get the door, then.<eos> Don't say anything, just shut up.<eos> Hello, police! Can you hear me?<eos> Is there anyone there?<eos> Can you open up, please?<eos> Happy now?<eos> Far from it.<eos> What have you done to her?<eos> Her?
A tenner? 20?<eos> I don't have a lot on me right now.<eos> I don't need your small change.<eos> I need to upgrade my transportation.<eos> You can't have my van, you moron.<eos> It's my work.<eos> It's my work, too.<eos> You're nothing but a shitty little drug dealer, who should be at school.<eos> See you on the TV, then.<eos> What TV?
Archie!<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> I won't let them hurt you again.<eos> Greenshaw's not going to get away with it this time, Edwin.<eos> It's no good.<eos> I can't climb down from here.<eos> Do be careful, Mrs Oxley.<eos> Oh, thank goodness!
Yes, I did say that.<eos> I wanted to repay Alfred, somehow.<eos> Look, we have a motive, a packed rucksack, fingerprint evidence and no alibi.<eos> Short of a signed confession, it couldn't really be more conclusive!<eos> Yes, so much so that it could almost have been stage-managed.<eos> A ghastly melodrama, played out for Louisa and Mrs Cresswell up in the dress circle.<eos> Yes, but it isn't a play, Miss Marple.<eos> Miss Greenshaw is dead.<eos> And whoever killed her sedated her first with atropine.<eos> The same as poor Mr Cracken.
Anyhoo, I have a little errand for one of your girls.<eos> I think her name's Elsie.<eos> She has a date with a congressman tonight?<eos> The death toll in the wake of Joker's attack stands at 206 including host Dave Endochrine and Joker's own doctor Bartholomew Wolper.<eos> - How do you fight someone like that?<eos> - Simpler than I've made it.<eos> There's nothing wrong with Joker that I can't fix.<eos> With my hands.<eos> Both Joker and the Batman who himself left dozens of police hospitalized are now fugitives from the law.<eos> Oh, Elsie.
I want you to stop talking.<eos> And I want my wife back.<eos> - And he took her?<eos> - He did.<eos> Whatever you owe him, I can get however much it is to pay him off, no problem.<eos> We'll take care of it right now.<eos> You have to let me go and stop almost killing us.<eos> I would love to let you out of this car.<eos> Unfortunately, I can't do that.<eos> Why the hell not?
Why would he even give her back to you?<eos> If I were him, I'd kill her and I'd probably kill you.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - What?<eos> I'd probably kill me too.<eos> Looks like they've already been here.<eos> If he was already here, why didn't he just take out the power himself?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Stop here.<eos> Why?
Every day, I load a pile of junk,<eos> I walk 20 miles, I unload a pile of junk, and you just stand around like some idiot, taking pictures of me.<eos> And I can't do it anymore!<eos> It's OK.<eos> Dookie! Leave him alone.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> So I think... I was thinking about staying on for a few days.<eos> Why?
Can I have the definition, please?<eos> "A fingerprint."<eos> Dactylogram.<eos> Can I have the origin, please?<eos> From a Greek combination dactylos...<eos> I'm Guy.<eos> And you're Braden, right'?<eos> Braden Aftergood?<eos> I'm not supposed to talk to you.<eos> Why not?
Un-fucking-believable.<eos> - Un-fucking-believable. - Holy shit.<eos> Put your fucking mask on.<eos> What the fuck am I doing?<eos> Fuck shit!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> You shot the fucking dog?<eos> Yeah, thanks for telling me there was a dog, asshole!<eos> - Fuck. - Dick!<eos> Un-fucking-real.
- You were on the phone?<eos> You were on that phone right there?<eos> - You make a call there?<eos> - No no.<eos> I don't know.<eos> My head's all messed up.<eos> Three times in a month is crazy.<eos> Man, what are the odds of that, huh?<eos> Three times. What are the odds that the guy knew exactly where the keys were too, huh?<eos> Unbelievable.
- Excuse me, sir.<eos> - So you got anything else for us,<eos> - Mister...<eos> - Potami.<eos> Potami?<eos> Detective Ransone, any more questions?<eos> No, I think you guys covered everything.<eos> No? Good. So we're done here, right?<eos> Somebody get this kid to a hospital.<eos> - Unbelievable. - Mmm.
I drove my sword into his back.<eos> "Burn them all," he kept saying.<eos> "Burn them all."<eos> I don't think he expected to die.<eos> He... he meant to... burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash.<eos> I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen.<eos> That's where Ned Stark found me.<eos> If this is true... why didn't you tell anyone?<eos> Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?<eos> Stark?
I will punish them with any arms at my disposal.<eos> You do not need to burn the boy.<eos> If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark...<eos> And our King is still no closer to the Iron Throne.<eos> A great gift requires a great sacrifice.<eos> His name is Gendry.<eos> He's a good lad.<eos> A poor lad from Flea Bottom, who happens to be your nephew.<eos> What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?<eos> Everything.
We've gotta cut them loose!<eos> Take my hand!<eos> That's a wonderful pin.<eos> It's more of a brooch, really.<eos> Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so...<eos> I'm very happy about...<eos> Yes.<eos> I am as well.<eos> I feel like I'm in a dream.<eos> Yes, me, too.
Holy shit.<eos> Hey, kiddo.<eos> - What, Dad?<eos> - Should be a stud here.<eos> Oh, what's all this?<eos> Carol's going to be here in 30.<eos> - Go wash up.<eos> - Uh, Dad, you know, urn,<eos> I actually just realized I have a party tonight, so I'm not going to be able to make it for dinner and stuff.<eos> Sorry. Too bad.
Wait, what?<eos> No, no, that was thunder.<eos> Definitely a bad omen.<eos> No, come on, that was thunder.<eos> That's a tree. This is a rock.<eos> Come on, man, it's nature.<eos> It's not an omen. Have some common sense.<eos> - It's not like a raven told us to go away.<eos> Yeah, we're doing this.<eos> Oh, God.
I know you're pissed off.<eos> So when are you leaving?<eos> When are you leaving?<eos> Today's my last day.<eos> Really?<eos> The day before my birthday?<eos> I don't think you understand.<eos> You are the only thing standing between me and...<eos> Oh, hello, baby.<eos> Hello, baby, oh.
Are you all right, sir?<eos> - Shall I call the doctor?<eos> I have... a quite serious health condition.<eos> But nobody here at the plant must know of it.<eos> Nobody.<eos> Friedrich Zeitz, Herr Hoffmeister is expecting me.<eos> My doctor has confined me to the house until further notice.<eos> I can partly run the steelworks by telephone so...<eos> I've decided to give you a new job.<eos> - Me?
You've got it in you.<eos> Now, let's practise your French.<eos> - French is a beautiful language.<eos> - No, it's not. Mother makes me learn it. But I hate it.<eos> Try reading me this fable.<eos> A penny for your thoughts, Fritzi?<eos> Stop calling me that.<eos> If you say so, Fritzi.<eos> Not now.<eos> Why not?
Last call for the flight to Palma de Mallorca.<eos> Last call for the flight to Palma de Mallorca.<eos> Flying Enterprise has terminated contracts with some former clients so that we could focus our attention on new, larger customers.<eos> Why would Flying Enterprise have a credit line in the Private Bank when we do our business with the Trade Bank?<eos> Is this a joke, Simon?<eos> Do we talk prices on seats, or will your travellers skip all the way to Mallorca?<eos> - We wish to...<eos> - No...<eos> If you would excuse us for a minute.<eos> Mogens.
Do we talk prices on seats, or will your travellers skip all the way to Mallorca?<eos> - We wish to...<eos> - No...<eos> If you would excuse us for a minute.<eos> Mogens.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - They're not wearing any clothes.<eos> If they are, we're toast.<eos> Mogens, negotiate a price...<eos> - Mogens.
He took a swing.<eos> - He said paying taxes is immoral.<eos> - I suppose it is.<eos> The Treasurer complained to the Danish Broadcasting Cooperation.<eos> - We won't survice a tax case.<eos> - There is no tax case, Holger.<eos> Everything's in order.<eos> - Says who?<eos> - Mogens.<eos> And besides Mogens?
Did you see me on TV?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Everyone says you're an idiot.<eos> - Not everyone.<eos> Sure.<eos> So what does that mean?<eos> The bigwigs are caught in their own web.<eos> They had a Cabinet meeting.<eos> Do you know what the sole topic was?<eos> Me.
- We're not supposed to...<eos> Leak it!<eos> Lene?<eos> - Simon!<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> A sale on Fernet Branca?<eos> Mogens is hosting an election meeting.<eos> He's guest bartender.<eos> Mogens?

This is where my minions toil to harvest the beans from which we make the sacred brew.<eos> Pick faster. Faster.<eos> Well, it's nice to see that you didn't eat Javier at least.<eos> I actually tried a couple of his fingers, but it was gross.<eos> Really gamy.<eos> Do you see the power that I have over them?<eos> I do, yeah.<eos> I'm willing to give you a taste of it.<eos> I'm offering you a job as my second in command.<eos> Why?
He's just kidding.<eos> Come on, I'll do anything. Dale.<eos> Phil, I'm begging you, brother.<eos> We'll be your slaves.<eos> Yeah, we get it, whatever you fucking want.<eos> Don't have Dale cut my head off, man.<eos> You don't wanna do this. Phil.<eos> Please, man.<eos> This isn't you, man. Things just got weird.<eos> Sorry, dude.
God.<eos> I actually feel a bit sick now.<eos> Just these muffins, I think.<eos> Never trust a blueberry.<eos> Okay, I'll be back in a tick.<eos> You two are such a lovely couple.<eos> Bit weird.<eos> He's cute.<eos> I like him.<eos> Yeah, me too.
The lady that got out of your truck a second ago.<eos> Well, now, look here, buddy, If there'd have been a lady in my truck, I'd hold on tight.<eos> I wouldn't let her go.<eos> No lady in my truck.<eos> Mmm. What's up?<eos> Where's your friend?<eos> He sorta got a letter from his girlfriend.<eos> She dumped him.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Why?
Do you know this?<eos> If you get 3 aces, you get loans in Bangkok.<eos> I'm not playing.<eos> - What happened to you?<eos> I want to go to loo.<eos> - Don't you want to use rest room?<eos> Look there, you'd feel like using it.<eos> Hey you, come here!<eos> Why are you sitting without running away?<eos> Why?
Going back to home.<eos> - Why?<eos> Please listen...<eos> Everyone is happy as they want to be except me!<eos> Can't he ask?<eos> Won't I answer him?<eos> With a long face... just one such man is enough to understand life.<eos> I'll lose Rs.7000!<eos> Elder on has come back, don't know what has happened there?<eos> Why?
What's in it for you?<eos> - Do we have to do this now?<eos> How do I know you won't drop me?<eos> It won't be the first time.<eos> Come on, this is not the right moment.<eos> - It is to me.<eos> How do I know you won't take off when it goes wrong?<eos> You don't.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> And yourself.
Where?<eos> - To Greece.<eos> - French?<eos> - Not.<eos> - Wsiadaj.<eos> - Valerie.<eos> - Ezekiel.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - Who?<eos> Ezekiel.
Find the pick-up zone.<eos> North, you hear me? Yes sir.<eos> I--I got it.<eos> North.<eos> Broadus, my Ducati says I get there first.<eos> Meet me there, the bike's yours.<eos> Okay, where are we? - Should be-- about-- here.<eos> - They like the big boulevards.<eos> - We go this way.<eos> - Why that way?
- Gentlemen... - ... Zombies.<eos> When are we leaving?<eos> Nobody's going anywhere. - Why not?<eos> - Nothing's changed.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Tell him, Max.<eos> - Major Gatling knows only too well.<eos> Didn't he tell you?<eos> His men, they didn't make it.<eos> Oh no, Jude.
I do bacteria, not babies<eos> Zombies everywhere you look, and you're scared of dirty diapers?<eos> They're not zombies.<eos> She didn't tell me.<eos> Maybe she doesn't even wanna have the kid.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Now shut up.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - Out.<eos> - Why?
We don't have an option.<eos> We can't afford the mortgage.<eos> We don't even have enough to apply for a bank loan.<eos> Nobody's going to trust us with such a big loan.<eos> You told me that we should think everything through.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> It's not possible.<eos> Damn!<eos> How much do we need to show for the bank loan?<eos> 500,000.00
See how your business takes off!<eos> Just like you say.<eos> Of course!<eos> I'll become Ambani and we'll make Omi the Chief Minister.<eos> But for now, let's get a rickshaw.<eos> Hello everyone and welcome to a bright and sunny day here at the Ahmedabad cricket ground... to witness this exciting match between...<eos> Raipur Chakla and Sabarmati Sports Club.<eos> Sorry, got caught up.<eos> I just closed the shop.<eos> Omi?
Of his father's links to Ml5.<eos> I wanted to see how they would react.<eos> Yeah, well, now you know.<eos> If you even begin to say, "I told you so." No, Claudia, I...<eos> Because I... All I care about is...<eos> We're not strong enough to fight them, are we?<eos> No.<eos> There's no good way out of this, is there? There's no... There is no right way out of this.<eos> No.<eos> Sorry, Claudia.
- Then believe in yourself.<eos> Well, where do I start my search, then?<eos> With the hanged man, the seat of the soul.<eos> He's already opened the door for you.<eos> And my mother?<eos> She will be for you on the other side.<eos> All you have to do... is enter.<eos> Maestro? Maestro?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Maestro!
Lorenzo was quite taken with your designs.<eos> Well, may I see one of these marvels?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a device for slowing one's rate of descent.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Yeah. And under what circumstances would I possibly have use for this?<eos> Say that you were trapped in a fortress.<eos> - A fortress?<eos> - That had been breached. You could strap yourself into this... and you'd safely float down to freedom.<eos> Oh, thank goodness.
Previously on Smash... No.<eos> We have rehearsal in an hour.<eos> - You haven't told anybody?<eos> - No.
I don't know why we didn't think of it sooner.<eos> I'm sure Jimmy and Karen will have issues, especially now that her part has to be reduced.<eos> She'll live.<eos> Karen's nothing if not a professional.<eos> Seriously.<eos> - Great work.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I'm glad you're happy.<eos> You know who else is gonna love this?<eos> Richard Francis.
But you never did it.<eos> No, we tried to do it a bunch of times back then, but the rights were never available.<eos> When was the last time you checked?<eos> That's the fourth shirt you've tried on.<eos> Yeah, yeah, it's a Broadway opening.<eos> I don't want to look like a jerk.<eos> Since when do you care how you look?<eos> I might talk to Karen tonight.<eos> About what?<eos> About... Everything.
Whoever we get can hold the music.<eos> It's Fringe.<eos> I can help call some people.<eos> Yeah, don't bother.<eos> You've done enough.<eos> - Jimmy.<eos> - And thank you, though, for...<eos> For waiting till six hours before to bail.<eos> That's really classy... oh, and thank your boyfriend too.<eos> - Boyfriend?
Here he is.<eos> That's sweet of you to turn up, Mr. Collins.<eos> Oh, no problem, Mr. Wills.<eos> Okay, Richard Francis is gonna be at our stumble-through at 6:00.<eos> So I want as much of this new material in the run as possible.<eos> Ana, do you want to get over there so we can hear the new songs, please?<eos> Have fun.<eos> Wow. Really?<eos> You liked it that much?<eos> Oh, not just us.
I thought you'd be pleased to see me.<eos> Course I am. And that there were no regrets about last night.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I can assure you, Private Keenan, you're a very good kisser!<eos> Well, in that case, as I'm the recipient of a well-earned half-day leave, would you like to introduce me to the delights of Ravensea?<eos> Trust me, the delights of Ravensea will not fill an afternoon!<eos> But there's a hotel at the top of the hill - The Imperial.<eos> We can meet there.<eos> A hotel?<eos> Why, Nurse Charles...
Yes, I understand.<eos> Four minutes.<eos> One minute.<eos> Then we're free to walk through those gates.<eos> If any of you were real friends, you'd stay behind and keep me company.<eos> If we were mad enough, we might.<eos> Are you interested, Lomax?<eos> We'll tell the girls you'll see them next time!<eos> Tell them they're missing the best part of Two Section.<eos> Two Section!
He just heard his grandfather died.<eos> Fall in, Private Keenan.<eos> Are you ready to lose Keenan's bet for him, Mr Rothman?<eos> I'm looking forward to seeing you grovel, Mr White-Bowne.<eos> And I'm looking forward to seeing Keenan lick my boots clean.<eos> Really? I thought Lomax was the deluded one!<eos> If you're so certain, why not make it more interesting with a bet on the side?<eos> What's wrong? Suddenly not so confident?<eos> Just feel bad about taking money off you, White-Bowne.<eos> Two Section!
You make sure he leaves.<eos> Shame, he shames me, shames me in my house.<eos> And you allow it. Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Why do you allow him to shame me?<eos> I shamed you.<eos> Never would I have this...<eos> He shames me, twice he shames me, and you were... nothing...<eos> I listen, I listen to everything you told me... Why?<eos> Why?
Inform uncle<eos> Once the labourers leave tomorrow, we will start digging in this direction<eos> All this mud can be removed and put here<eos> We have to finish this in three nights<eos> Its the first car l owned Very dear to me<eos> Hope you take good care of her I will.<eos> Moves certainly. - lt's a lovely car. Thank you.<eos> Meet my friend, Varun Srivastava<eos> Mr. Mukherjee<eos> Hi. - Pleasure.
Whoever you are, you're hovering.<eos> Speak, or pour me a drink and don't speak.<eos> Professor, we have an appointment.<eos> Uh... Oh, the government agents.<eos> Uh, it turns out my day is full.<eos> Afraid I'll have to postpone.<eos> Well, you're reasonably hot.<eos> What say you ditch the, uh, forehead here, and interrogate me?<eos> What say you just answer our questions?<eos> Mmm, sexy.
Them coming onto our property, blowing things up, is more than freedom of speech.<eos> I-I'm not saying that's the right way to do it, but that's what they're doin'.<eos> Well, they might find themselves with their backsides covered in buckshot next time.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I don't think he's slept more than a few hours since he got out.<eos> Light's always on in his room, all hours of the night.<eos> sounds like a guilty conscience to me.<eos> Hey, dad, I'll pick up more coffee today.<eos> why?
Hmm. No one's home.<eos> You going to be okay?<eos> Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure they'll be home soon.<eos> I think Carter emailed me something actually.<eos> I'll take this one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Want me to wait?<eos> Uh, no. It's fine.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> - You too.
Look, you don't know me, so I'm gonna let you off the hook this time.<eos> But trust me, in the future you'll be much happier if you always tell me the truth.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, I'll be happier?<eos> You don't think I could make you happy if I wanted to?<eos> So how did you find out my name?<eos> - I asked around.<eos> - You asked around about me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's interesting.<eos> - Why? - Why?
- You're not gonna go buy a mop right now.<eos> - It's embarrassing.<eos> - No, I told you, it's not a mop.<eos> - It's these pads.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> You shouldn't be doing your own housework.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - 'Cause you're a grown man.<eos> You shouldn't be cleaning your own floors.<eos> Why?
The clay down there is extremely dense, which makes it safe for storage.<eos> - For nuclear waste?<eos> - Yeah. I mean, nuclear energy powers about 80% of France, so their land is unique.<eos> Valuable, I bet. How much was the contract?<eos> Um, about 30 million euros.<eos> It also says here that Klaus Pistor is on a committee trying to win that contract.<eos> - You think he had anything to gain? - That's a lot of money.<eos> Especially down there.<eos> - You thinking about his father's death?<eos> Yeah, me too.
- No, he's right.<eos> This is impossible.<eos> - Hey, guys, focus!<eos> Leave to me alone.<eos> Then I figure that to Russell... task be... cover.<eos> Think you can carry it?<eos> Ah... Good.<eos> Win!<eos> Ready?<eos> Ready!
Oh, come on, mate.<eos> Was she a local girl?<eos> Come on, Macca.<eos> Come on, Jay.<eos> This is your first big case.<eos> You'll be surprised how much I can help you out.<eos> We'll see what happens. If I need your help, I'll let you know.<eos> Oh, just off the record.<eos> I mean... mate, off the record, something.<eos> Thanks, Macca.
Did you see them on the way in, did you?<eos> See who, Mr Murray?<eos> The fuckers are everywhere now.<eos> What's everywhere?<eos> Those mongrel wild dogs.<eos> Fuckers come in.<eos> They... they tore him to bits.<eos> Bless his little soul.<eos> I'm sorry about your dog, Mr Murray.<eos> Dog?
I never touched her!<eos> Freya!<eos> I never looked at her.<eos> I never came on to her.<eos> Not in thought, not in deed!<eos> Good God, you really think I would shit on my own doorstep like that?<eos> But you would elsewhere?<eos> Oh... Then why would she claim such a thing, Aiden?<eos> Why would she do that to you?<eos> To us?
Leonard--<eos> Oh, so you have the gall to remain in Florence?<eos> You're either brave or unimaginably stupid.<eos> Uh, it's a bit of both.<eos> You sabotage our efforts.<eos> Why? The guns wouldn't have ended this.<eos> With all your experience in waging war, you decided that, did you?<eos> Fuck!<eos> I can't believe I trusted you.<eos> You, a bastard, a charlatan, a peddler of knickknacks.
Drink some antidote.<eos> That bastard.<eos> - He slipped something in our drinks.<eos> - No.<eos> I did.<eos> There's nothing you won't do to us in your bloody quest.<eos> I... I adulterated the Tuica before we arrived.<eos> That we'd all have to drink it, in order to convince him it was safe.<eos> And now... ..everyone, including the dogs, should be passing out.<eos> Ready?
And how will you tell him?<eos> I'll phone him right now and you can stop worrying.<eos> Let me get past, darling.<eos> I'm going to call him.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Why are you looking at me like that?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You're the target, Norma.<eos> Patricia is obsessed with having you killed.<eos> Me?
No more runaround.<eos> Forget what's happened.<eos> Let's just get this done.<eos> What kind of trouble, Kyle?<eos> No, bro.<eos> All I've ever done is protect you.<eos> I can't change now.<eos> Better you not know.<eos> But I--I need to know I can trust you to...<eos> Uhh.
I told you I'm fine, and we're set.<eos> I'll be heading over to Tommy's to pick up the pizzelle dough, and I've already got the extra ingredient.<eos> You seem totally okay with all this.<eos> You're my brother.<eos> I don't want anything to happen to you.<eos> And the more I think about how he set me up, I can't wait to burn him.<eos> And you haven't heard from Dolen yet?<eos> No.<eos> Wasn't expecting to.<eos> Why?
Or?<eos> He didn't say "or."<eos> It seems your mission has been entirely wasted, Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> You and your men must leave here in the morning.<eos> Unless you want to repudiate King Horik, renounce your allegiance to him.<eos> I see.<eos> Very well.<eos> Good.<eos> War.<eos> Odin...
Well, more of a gentle reminder, maybe.<eos> More heavy-handed than gentle, which surprised me.<eos> It's not really your style, Francis.<eos> But, yes. I got it.<eos> I like that one.<eos> I do, too. But the first one's better.<eos> You think?<eos> Something special tomorrow?<eos> Adam Galloway's coming down from New York.<eos> What for?
I can't interrupt him.<eos> He's the Vice President.<eos> We're not on the edge of Penn's Woods.<eos> We need economic development flowcharts for the Watershed Bill sent over to Terry Womack's office.<eos> Hard copies, 20 of them.<eos> I'll do it right away.<eos> How's everything going with Rachel?<eos> I think she's a little down in the dumps.<eos> She got a waitressing job last week, and then they let her go.<eos> Why?
Should have a preliminary one this afternoon.<eos> You'll let me know?<eos> As soon as I have something solid.<eos> There's one more thing.<eos> About last night...<eos> No need to apologize.<eos> I'm sure you had a very good reason. I do.<eos> I think we should end it.<eos> Not professionally, the other thing.<eos> Why now?
Sean McCray, Chief of Psychiatry here.<eos> You're doing very valuable work, and I hate it, because it means that you're not coming back.<eos> She's not going to be content until some shrink gives her a name for whatever it is that makes me different from her.<eos> I'm keeping your key because somebody is gonna have to come and clean up after you blow your brains out.<eos> Is he in?<eos> It's his wife.<eos> Yes, I'll hold!<eos> Keep it.<eos> It's all yours.<eos> Unbelievable.
So those twenty-seven texts that you didn't answer...<eos> I've been working like a demon trying to find a serum, or an antibody, just something that might... Hey...<eos> - It's okay, babe.<eos> - It's not.<eos> Friends!<eos> Can I have your attention please?<eos> A toast, to my granddaughter.<eos> I'm so very proud of you.<eos> We all are. You've been through so much the last few years, but you've always stayed true to yourself.<eos> To your heart.
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Thought you were out of my league.<eos> Oh, I am.<eos> But still... it's good to know.<eos> I want you to be careful around Odessa.<eos> She's smart.<eos> Not as smart as I am.<eos> Mama?<eos> It's Rosie.<eos> Rosie!
Nora is.<eos> Listen, I know...<eos> I know you didn't hurt Erin on purpose.<eos> Liam got into her head somehow, made her come after you.<eos> Come here. Um...<eos> Josh, do you think that Liam knows about Connor?<eos> No.<eos> The only people who know are you, me and Nora.<eos> And Nora would never say anything, ever.<eos> Why not?
Could you give it back, please?<eos> Who sent this?<eos> Think I actually know?<eos> How long has this been going on?<eos> The last few days.<eos> Is this all of them?<eos> No.<eos> We have to tell somebody. Who?<eos> Usually moms are a good start.<eos> My mom, seriously.
Okay!<eos> This is worrying.<eos> Goku, hide inside my house!<eos> Why?<eos> Hurry!<eos> Even if you say hurry...<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Okay~<eos> Why, why is Lord Bills coming here?<eos> Why?
So we can go into the water and come back and get warm.<eos> Let's go. I'm gonna go in.<eos> Don't.<eos> I'm gonna go in.<eos> Don't!<eos> Why not?<eos> Kate, just don't do this.<eos> Why not?<eos> No, don't go in the water.<eos> Why not?
Not just splitting a cab. Ryan saw it.<eos> Ryan.<eos> Ryan saw it. If you can't trust him, who can you trust, right?<eos> Kind of sucks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here's Dave.<eos> We can find out from the source. I kind of feel, like, bad that I know, because how's she gonna walk in here?<eos> Yeah, totally. That's crazy, man.<eos> I wouldn't put those two together.<eos> No, me neither.
You don't... Care?<eos> You can't drink though.<eos> One glass of red wine is... Fine.<eos> Honestly. How else would french women get pregnant?<eos> Asshole.<eos> Jesus. Hi. So- lifeguard.<eos> Yeah? Can you buy us beer?<eos> Lumpy's brother was supposed to, but circumstances intervened.<eos> No.<eos> Why?
John, I'm just tired.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> Hey. I love you.<eos> I'm sleeping over.<eos> Yes!<eos> I will prepare us cereal.<eos> I'm so jealous of you.<eos> Me?
Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> Hey. I love you.<eos> I'm sleeping over.<eos> Yes!<eos> I will prepare us cereal.<eos> I'm so jealous of you.<eos> Me?<eos> Why?
Mel- no. You know what?<eos> I think that you couldn't let me have my shit together.<eos> 'Cause that was always your thing, and I was the fuckup, so-<eos> - What?<eos> That's not true. That's not true.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - That's not-<eos> - I'm so sorry, Jason.<eos> Jason, really, I am truly sorry.<eos> Why?
We gotta move him, Melissa.<eos> All right, take him.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Find him.<eos> I have to find him.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I have to...<eos> I have to tell him.<eos> Who?
Five billion lives extinguished.<eos> No chance for goodbyes.<eos> A world snuffed out like a candle flame!<eos> All right, all right, Skaldak, you leave me no choice.<eos> I'm a time lord, Skaldak.<eos> I know a bit about sonic technology myself.<eos> A threat?<eos> You threaten me, doctor?<eos> No.<eos> No, not you... All of us.
'll Go with you.<eos> Is a personal matter.<eos> Red Cavanaugh murdered my husband in cold blood.<eos> No more personal matter than that.<eos> Can dance on his grave.<eos> But until finished, out of my way.<eos> Hey, you might be good, but they are .<eos> Network has hired many gunmen since taking the city.<eos> Let us help you.<eos> Who?
They are family.<eos> We have to help them.<eos> God will take care of us.<eos> What about this one, eh?<eos> Leave her alone there!<eos> Let her go!<eos> Leave her alone!<eos> Trust in God!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Lot.
This isn't the end, Azariah.<eos> It's the beginning.<eos> The Jewish people will need help... to survive what is coming.<eos> Over the next 500 years, their tiny nation is attacked again and again.<eos> Then they succumb to the might of Rome.<eos> - Get in line!<eos> - You can't do this.<eos> - Put it here-all of it!<eos> - Roman greed.<eos> Roman law.
You'll really be sorry the day I exact revenge for that slap.<eos> And this slap won't hurt your body.<eos> It'll break your soul.<eos> Kirtibhai, you heard that?<eos> Do you think I'm a fool?<eos> Making this bridge for you lazy people?<eos> Stop taking my things.<eos> Sriram, I'm not coming back with you.<eos> Liar!<eos> Ditcher!
Y ou guys!<eos> This is cheapj ournalism, c ompletely unethical.<eos> We d on 't st o op s o l ow.<eos> What pe ople d o in their pers onal lives, is n one of our c oncern.<eos> Yasmin, this is the Prime Minister, f or G ods sake!<eos> H ow can y ou ask him such questi ons?<eos> Why n ot?<eos> He had said that...

You do your worst.<eos> Well?<eos> Thanks for the gift, Roy.<eos> I'll see you next week, then.<eos> I imagine that's up to Dr. Duncan.<eos> Now, you'd be a fool to let that one go, but I s'pose that means you probably will.<eos> How did you manage that?<eos> It was quite easy, really, once we learned we had shared opinions.<eos> On?<eos> You.
Did you forget something?<eos> If you'll just let me explain, Miss Adams.<eos> God as my witness, I never meant you any harm!<eos> But you did me harm.<eos> I shouldn't have looked.<eos> I know.<eos> But you have so many secrets, and you were under my roof.<eos> Curiosity I forgive.<eos> But telling Jack Duncan what you found was spiteful.<eos> Dr. Duncan?
I won't have to tell him.<eos> If he sees me like this, he'll say, "Beat it."<eos> I'll answer, "Okay.<eos> You sure?"<eos> It's over.<eos> All settled.<eos> I'm sorry. I swear I am.<eos> Students, take to the streets!<eos> No to privatization!<eos> No to job cuts!
- The Chicago concert. They're coming back to the island.<eos> They haven't been here for 20 years. Wendy should be happy about that.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Why should Wendy be happy about it? Last time they were here, she blew the lot of them.<eos> Is that supposed to be a joke? No!<eos> They came here 20 years ago, she went to the concert, and she ended up blowing the band.<eos> - Allegedly.<eos> - It's a rumor.<eos> - Wendy blew Chicago. - Wendy the waitress, who I lived with for three years, that's...<eos> - No, not the whole band.
"Hey," fiber.<eos> You and Jennifer, huh?<eos> What is it to you?<eos> Well, I was just curious.<eos> She's nice girl.<eos> Lovely, lovely girl.<eos> But there's something I need to tell you.<eos> What do you need to tell me?<eos> The city?<eos> The band.
- Oh, yeah. What am I thinking?<eos> My only regret, Rolly, is that you missed the Chicago concert that night.<eos> Best show I've ever seen.<eos> The entire island was there.<eos> - They were great. - Yeah.<eos> All three encores. Everybody had a great time, especially the band.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Jennifer blew them in the parking lot.<eos> - I forgot about that. - Jennifer? The whole band?<eos> - Lee Loughnane, for sure. - Definitely Jimmy Pankow. No.
- I have to go.<eos> - So...<eos> - I left Danny.<eos> And if Mandeep gets a call from Immigration, he knows I'll take half the house in the divorce.<eos> Danny... loves that house.<eos> Do you know what got me?<eos> It wasn't your willingness to humiliate yourself... or all the injuries.<eos> It was that after all that, you would walk away.<eos> There's something in you, some hard, good little kernel of something.<eos> Corn?
Why can't I text you?<eos> Because he looks at my phone.<eos> Why can't we meet at my place?<eos> That's not gonna happen anymore.<eos> So that's who you're with.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Who'd you think you were- So this is the guy that gave you the mercedes And has a private jet and takes you to maui<eos> And lives in the fucking mansion in malibu. Ryan, please.<eos> Last night killed me.<eos> Why?
Equinox.<eos> The gym that I'm a member of.<eos> The one on westwood or the one on sunset?<eos> The one in west hollywood.<eos> Why'd you go to the one in west hollywood?<eos> Because it was closer to where I was meeting gina for lunch.<eos> What time did you go to the gym?<eos> Tell me something, do you find gina attractive? No.<eos> I'd never hire an assistant I find attractive.<eos> Why not?
Sure.<eos> So I had lunch with tara today.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I just-<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I'm a little surprised After what you told me about her last night.<eos> Yeah, I know, but christian asked me to go, so-<eos> - Why?
This is another trick.<eos> I would never lie to a player of Flaming Orc.<eos> You are... a Fellow Traveller?<eos> I have been known to drink a flagon of mead at Gedruff's Tavern.<eos> No, the agents of the Spider-King have many disguises and they riddle most prettily.<eos> Your caution does you credit.<eos> Imagine you're in the citadel.<eos> Before you, the diamond dragon, what do you do?<eos> Why, use the invisibility hex, of course.<eos> What, against the diamond dragon?
- That was my understanding.<eos> Although I don't think McNair's lessons were exactly conventional.<eos> You must take some of the credit, of course, for helping Tom adjust to society.<eos> Tom's been very resourceful in that area.<eos> Sorry, are you saying you haven't taught him anything?<eos> I mean, you're obviously a man of breeding and intelligence, whereas Tom was almost literally raised by wolves.<eos> That's something of a sweeping statement.<eos> And yet you felt no compulsion to pass on any of your...<eos> No, fine. Not really my place.<eos> Unbelievable.
It's just the lack of blood.<eos> Now shut up, I'm trying to concentrate.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> In the Archive, they taught how to get loose in case we ever got captured by one of your lot.<eos> Nearly there.<eos> No, I'm all right.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> Don't tell me you're doing this for real.<eos> - I made a promise to Alex.<eos> And Hal.
What is that? Is that a solar panel?<eos> - Carlton.<eos> - He's here!<eos> He's alive!<eos> Carlton, talk to me.<eos> Tell me you're okay.<eos> Ooh, I don't know. I may have jumped the gun.<eos> - Is that just his torso?<eos> - You are all heartless!<eos> - Oh, hey, guys. - Carlton.
Never.<eos> Woody, that's a Long Island Iced Tea. They're supposed to go together.<eos> That is a party in your liver, man, and everyone is invited.<eos> Except the pancreas.<eos> He doesn't know how to party. He does not know how to party.<eos> Ugh!<eos> How about that Marlowe?<eos> I mean, God, she is baby crazy.<eos> Carlton's not ready for that. Yeah, I think I have a plan. To cog up this mama mania.<eos> Dog.
I just let an appliance salesman inject my face, Shawn.<eos> All right, Waxworks, party's over.<eos> Hit the road.<eos> Somebody feed my cats.<eos> They're locked in the back bathroom.<eos> Marco Polo and Buttons.<eos> - Buttons is allergic to wheat. - You'll get him next time.<eos> Don't look so worried.<eos> I'm worried about those poor cats.<eos> Dude, why?
- Stop talking.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - I said shut up! - [Screams]<eos> That's enough, Bob!<eos> Son of a-- [Grunting]<eos> - You did good, playa.<eos> - Did I?<eos> Well, I'm glad you and Max landed safely.<eos> Did he get the surprise I left in his bag?<eos> Not yet.
- Hello.<eos> My name is Shawn Spencer.<eos> This is my partner, Bill Uvrights.<eos> What was that?<eos> The right to bear arms.<eos> You just shot her in the face.<eos> I wasn't aiming at her, Shawn.<eos> I was shadow-hunting.<eos> We're here to see the boss.<eos> Which boss?
I need you to understand you are on the hook until you make it so that I don't have to lie for you anymore.<eos> It's very simple.<eos> You have to tell the chief.<eos> No, Jules, that's not gonna happen.<eos> That's not gonna happen, because, if I do that, then all of this goes away, all of it.<eos> And with it goes the good.<eos> All the lives that I have saved, the lives that I've improved.<eos> This is--this is what I have, Jules.<eos> This is how I do good.<eos> Not for everyone.
I did.<eos> I wish it ended there... but it doesn't.<eos> Well, guess what. You have nothing to say about it because I'm your boss, and you're nothing but a scared, weak, pathetic peon.<eos> Run along now.<eos> Helen, get in here!<eos> What happened with the San Antonio email?<eos> - I sent it.<eos> - When did you send it?<eos> - This morning.<eos> - To the wrong person!
Seriously though, you kicked the crap out of that guy.<eos> I mean, that was old school, epic, Cobra Kai,<eos> "Do you have a problem with that, Mr. Lawrence?" dojo style.<eos> I, too, was impressed with your investigative work.<eos> Yeah, that was-- was pretty spot on wasn't it?<eos> Yeah. I could have used a little less of this...<eos> But it was spot on.<eos> Duly noted.<eos> Wood-man, talk to me.<eos> Oh, thank goodness.
Gus and I were in the Psych office reviewing old files.<eos> - I'm clearly winning.<eos> - Don't count me out. - Don't count me out.<eos> - I'm fading.<eos> Guy walks in--<eos> I'm fading like a flower.<eos> Very sweaty, breathing heavy, quite disgusting.<eos> I need you to help me find a murderer.<eos> Whose murderer?<eos> Mine.
Rita hasn't been here in almost two years.<eos> Who is this?<eos> You see, Rita was suspect numero one.<eos> And when we found out she had gone home to collect Leo's things, we paid her a surprise visit.<eos> After you contacted the police, right?<eos> - Most definitely.<eos> - You never contacted us.<eos> - I left a message.<eos> - With who?<eos> With Jeff Mormen... son Officer Mormenson.
Up Sugar Mountain.<eos> After this, you can stop coming around, okay? Yeah.<eos> So I'm runnin' Yes, I'm runnin' When you're alone in this world, you learn to find help anywhere, any way you can, including bending the truth about your own dead mama.<eos> Yes, I'm runnin' The trick is to find someone who might just be worse off than you are.<eos> They're the ones who've got nothing to lose.<eos> I haven't seen or heard from Liz in over a year.<eos> Then a letter came in the mail.<eos> She wrote that she missed me, that she was sober and living at a church up on Sugar Mountain.<eos> Needed me to come get her right away.<eos> Why?
- So it's true ?<eos> - What ?<eos> - Stephanie told me , Naomi, too ...<eos> - What ?<eos> - Damn !<eos> I thought it was a joke.<eos> - But what?<eos> That one woman attracted to you for two weeks.<eos> No, no!<eos> Me ?
Where there.<eos> Greatly respect all people.<eos> Thank you .<eos> Please sit down .<eos> - This is your beloved ?<eos> - Who ?<eos> - This gentleman , who is sitting next to it.<eos> - Do not .<eos> Not at all .<eos> And why ?
O. .. her mother.<eos> It has ovarian cancer .<eos> Advanced stage .<eos> I'm coming .<eos> I'm going .<eos> She's dying !<eos> It's a matter of a few days , So you understand yourself ...<eos> Tokyo, scholarship ...<eos> It's not a good time .<eos> sorry.
That's me!<eos> - Go here and do not move.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I do not believe you .<eos> - I know .<eos> Why not pobieg³eœ me ?<eos> This is proof that you have something to complain about.<eos> - I could not run for you .<eos> - Why?
What then?<eos> I have a theory, but is not scientific.<eos> Bring it on, tell us.<eos> First: I believe in you, your fox was deformed.<eos> Here. The point I wanted to show you.<eos> Because we need to take a picture.<eos> It's hard to believe, but as a child, there was snow everywhere.<eos> The glacier extended down yonder.<eos> All gone.<eos> Incredible.
I have a history with Jesse Pinkman, and I think he can be helpful to me on another active investigation.<eos> Look, I'm only asking for a couple minutes here.<eos> You said he wasn't talking?<eos> Let me tell you, that kid hates my guts.<eos> Despises me, okay?<eos> Maybe I can get him cranked up enough that he starts yapping.<eos> Then you guys go in there, get what you need from the little shit-stain, finish him off.<eos> Gives me anything useful while he's with me, I'll share it, 100%.<eos> I could use a smoke break. Yeah.<eos> How about you?
I don't think, uh, Walt's gonna be patting you on the back for that.<eos> But maybe that's the point.<eos> 'Cause, you see, I get that.<eos> My own brother-in-law lying to me for over a year,<eos> using me.<eos> Maybe you understand that feeling.<eos> Help me out here, Jesse... and we can put him away.<eos> I know you want that.<eos> I think you wanna talk.<eos> Not to you.
For three months he kept them.<eos> My wife, who had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done.<eos> I was in hell.<eos> I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family.<eos> Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this.<eos> I can't take this anymore.<eos> I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family.<eos> All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.<eos> Who do you think he's shown this to?<eos> No one.
You bet your ass the cavalry's comin'.<eos> No! No, no.<eos> Jack.<eos> Jack!<eos> No, the DEA doesn't know about this.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Hank.<eos> Nothing can change what just happened, but you can walk out of here alive if you just promise us that you'll... you'll let this go.<eos> Yeah, I thought as much.<eos> Sorry, man.
How?<eos> When?<eos> We were all being held hostage by Meredith.<eos> It wasn't in her locker before first period.<eos> So now we're depending on Meredith to be our alibi?<eos> See you in jail.<eos> I gotta say, Mona's a lot stronger than me.<eos> I would've lost it.<eos> - I feel sorry for her.<eos> - Yeah, me, too.
Leah, call for you on the landline.<eos> The emergency line.<eos> Can you make sure he gets some morphine?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mike?<eos> Hey. I was just checking in.<eos> Babe. How's your day been?<eos> Yeah, it's been busy.<eos> It's good, you know.<eos> How 'bout you?
I cannot understand how people have so little pride, let themselves fall so low.<eos> People have to eat.<eos> Not out of my dustbins, they don't.<eos> Oh, and by the way, Mr Lester... ..the police came round.<eos> Said they wanted to take the sports car that belonged to Miss Taylor.<eos> I said, of course, they could.<eos> I believe they've got it into their heads they need to have a thorough look at it.<eos> Mr Wax is selling the magazine? !<eos> It hasn't happened yet, no.<eos> To this American millionaire?
An accident?<eos> No, not a... Not an accident.<eos> I've got your things, ma'am.<eos> Oh, right. Thank you.<eos> I've been thinking. I should report myself.<eos> We should never have left her alone that night.<eos> We failed her utterly.<eos> And report your partner as well?<eos> You have reported it.<eos> To me.
DS Olson, signing out.<eos> Jimmy!<eos> What were you doing in there?<eos> Delivering a message.<eos> To Detective Superintendent Gibson?<eos> Are you charging McInturff and co?<eos> No comment.<eos> Fine.<eos> But tell your boss from me to stop saying the shooting is drugs-related.<eos> Why?
Did you talk to any of the local residents when you were there?<eos> Discuss Mr Tyler's personal business with them?<eos> Does that seem likely?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You tell me.<eos> I asked for some directions.<eos> Maybe they saw my name tag.<eos> You can bet your life they did. This is Shankill, Paul.<eos> Not some place you can come and go willy-nilly without being noticed.<eos> "Willy-nilly"?
"He that is no longer able to despise himself."<eos> "Behold, I show you the last man.<eos> What is love?"<eos> "What is creation?<eos> What is longing?<eos> What is a star?"<eos> "Thus asks the last man and blinks."<eos> We have your fingerprints on record, Marion.<eos> We're going to need yours, too, sir.<eos> Of course.
Yes, what is going on here?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I might be the hell you're talking to.<eos> I'm from corporate.<eos> Well, you certainly don't look like a guy from cor... oh.<eos> I-I'm sorry, mister, um...?<eos> They call me Mr. Gibbs.<eos> Now, I think you've bothered the customer and this dedicated employee long enough, don't you?<eos> Yes, sir. Yes, sir.<eos> Very sorry, folks.
There is no Gibbs.<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> Come on over.<eos> No.<eos> I'm good right here.<eos> Milo.<eos> Milo.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Reading.<eos> Why?
It says, the last piece of the sword is...<eos> Shh.<eos> Gem.<eos> It's a gem and it's hidden in ax...<eos> in a mountain behind your... Home town. Fantastic.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's super convenient. Good f... f... luck you two.<eos> I hope you find your destiny. Aw, man.<eos> Thanks, Lord Tourettes.
It's all good, man.<eos> Just stop pooping in my bed, okay.<eos> I never pooped in your bed.<eos> I've been pooping in my sleep?<eos> Naw, I'm just messing with you.<eos> I poop in your bed, but I won't anymore.<eos> Papa Sun?<eos> Papa Sun!<eos> Raccoon, that you?<eos> Raccoon.
- She new friend from school?<eos> - A new word I got from class.<eos> "Grace".Yeah, that's a good one.<eos> I think mom had that.<eos> You have a good memory, Maddy.<eos> She did.<eos> The way she dressed, her smile...<eos> Everything about her.<eos> - I miss mom.<eos> - Me too.
Our kids.<eos> Jack, we have a daughter who has serious issues and she needs help.<eos> She needs both of us.<eos> She needs you.<eos> Look, we may be separated, but you're still their father.<eos> And those kids want you out of here.<eos> So do I.<eos> If I take the deal with Conpine, are you willing to give us another try?<eos> You ever talk to Mom?<eos> Mom?
Suri gets there later.<eos> She trusts me.<eos> She's plotting a revolution.<eos> We have to stop her.<eos> Service records deleted.<eos> Most of the base is underground now.<eos> To stop the Chinese from stealing our tech... or infecting it with viruses.<eos> We've had to move the whole R-and-D lab off the grid.<eos> Good evening, gentlemen.<eos> Uh, sorry.
You look great. Gosh!<eos> Why aren't you in Hawaii?<eos> Uh, well, I, um-- I'm fixed. Heh heh.<eos> I'm serious! No. So am I.<eos> I needed to get my head back on straight, and look.<eos> Wait a minute. When did you get back?<eos> Uh, about an hour ago, and I just decided I'd come here straight from the airport.<eos> Why?<eos> Be-because I wanted to see you.<eos> Why?
I'm just- - I'm as emotional as fuck these days.<eos> It's sad when you realize that you failed at everything you've ever tried to do.<eos> You're the only one that ever believed in me.<eos> Why did you?<eos> Because I loved you.<eos> Hey. I know you.<eos> You're my heaven and hell.<eos> It's always just been you and me.<eos> Please stop, OK? Just stop.<eos> Why? Why?
- But that's not the problem anyway, 'cause...<eos> - But for how many years?<eos> - Forever, Henry, forever.<eos> 'Cause the real problem is...<eos> - But I... - Forever! I offered them full tax exemption forever and I threw in your daughter's virginity.<eos> - What the hell are you talkin' about?<eos> - Oh, Henry, Tom is pulling your leg.<eos> Everyone knows Lucy gave that away long ago.<eos> - Look, the tax exemption and his daughter's virginity are irrelevant.<eos> - Why?
Paul.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> Gone crazy out there yet?<eos> What's up?<eos> - That's his best friend.<eos> - Hey, can you do me a favour and record Pakistan vs. England?<eos> And don't tell me the score this time, it defeats the whole purpose.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And secondly, have you seen Helen lately?<eos> - No, why?
Get back to class.<eos> Daniel and Tawney been hanging out a little bit.<eos> When?<eos> When I was out of town, for one.<eos> They met at the church.<eos> She might've hung out with him here- - I don't know.<eos> She hasn't.<eos> How do you know?<eos> What's your point?<eos> My point?
Thanks.<eos> - Is he always like that?<eos> - Yeah, kind of.<eos> Hey, um, don't I know you?<eos> - I doubt it.<eos> - Karen cartwright?<eos> [laughs] I saw you in bombshell.<eos> You were incredible.<eos> I was so sorry to read about what happened.<eos> - Me too.
The effects developing into mortis.<eos> That a service to you?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Well, I'm glad of that at least.<eos> Stop him!<eos> Stop that man! Drake!<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> Let him go!<eos> Let him go.<eos> That man?
And if I know my favorite pint-sized stoner chick, I bet she is running low on weed.<eos> Hank Moody. Long time no see.<eos> He's been working.<eos> Good. Good to hear.<eos> Yeah, well, you had a lot to do with it, lady.<eos> After our weekend in New York, I banged out a draft of that thing I'm doing with Atticus.<eos> - It's what I do. - Yeah.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> I like it.<eos> Others, not so much.
Mmhmm. 'Cause my daughter, she just wrote her first novel, and I was really fucking hard on her.<eos> Oh, you have to be really gentle with those little girls, Hank.<eos> God, my parents, they hit me pretty hard once upon a time.<eos> I'm still smarting. About what?<eos> What happened?<eos> Do you know Big Yellow Taxi?<eos> - No.<eos> - By Joni Mitchell?<eos> No, I don't know any Joni Mitchell songs.<eos> No? None?
Oh, my back. My back. Oh, jeez.<eos> I've never been sodomized in a child's nursery before.<eos> - What fun.<eos> - That's odd.<eos> Oh, hey, you two.<eos> Oh, this is Trudy. This is Marcy and Karen.<eos> This is Trudy, and Trudy was recently widowed.<eos> It's true. I was.<eos> - Yeah, my hubby O.D.'d.<eos> - Oh, sorry.
Um, you're not my type, Zeke.<eos> I can change.<eos> I'm not committed to any of this.<eos> This is all really up for grabs, seriously.<eos> DEB:<eos> Seriously.<eos> I mean, no, you're gonna be hanging with all the film geek girls soon enough.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You're gonna be crawling with your type.<eos> Actually?
I would.<eos> Reformation be damned, Mr Eagles.<eos> This child, we shall make an example of him.<eos> No, my Lord, please!<eos> He is 14 years old and admits nothing of this crime.<eos> Thomas Gower.<eos> Three days hence, you will be taken to the gallows at Newgate, where Mr Berry will deliver you from this life and into the next.<eos> Mrs Manby.<eos> Inspector. I would thank you for your diligence and speed.<eos> You and Mr Lusk, here.
Oh, I got a thing.<eos> Don't get caught, dude.<eos> Anything I should know?<eos> No. No.<eos> Just a major prison break, the countryside's been overrun with fugitives.<eos> I got it.<eos> You show up before dawn with a bag of hamburgers?<eos> They get the toys that way.<eos> Come on, now. Let me in. Hell, no.<eos> Why not?
My poor little girl.<eos> This is Shinjuku station's west exit area.<eos> It's an honour presenting the Shinjuku Spiral Tower to you.<eos> It's a terrible tragedy.<eos> I'll try not to let it affect my work.<eos> But, what will you do?<eos> Swap them?<eos> No; anyway, we haven't got to that point yet.<eos> Raising them both could be a solution.<eos> Both of them?
and a sister, even if it happens this way.<eos> Keita, when you go home,<eos> you mustn't worry about anything.<eos> Ryusei's mother and father also love you very much.<eos> More than you do, daddy?<eos> More than I do.<eos> Hey, how about taking a photo with all of us'?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Ready?
I go to English classes every day and I study a lot.<eos> I must behave when I go the toilet.<eos> I bathe alone, without making any noise.<eos> Or play the play-station for half an hour a day.<eos> I must call you mother and father."<eos> Why?<eos> You are not my father.<eos> You are not my father.<eos> From now on, I'll be your father.<eos> Why?

From now on, I'll be your father.<eos> Why?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, they...<eos> I'll explain it to you.<eos> Your father and mother live there.<eos> Like they always did.<eos> But now you can call us father and mother, all right?<eos> Why?
Well, they...<eos> I'll explain it to you.<eos> Your father and mother live there.<eos> Like they always did.<eos> But now you can call us father and mother, all right?<eos> Why?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You want to explain it to me because it doesn't matter<eos> - One day you'll understand.<eos> - Why?

Why?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You want to explain it to me because it doesn't matter<eos> - One day you'll understand.<eos> - Why?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It doesn't?<eos> Why?<eos> - That's what I'm wondering also.<eos> - Why?
And when did you even...<eos> I kept up with my schoolwork while I was... away, and I memorized the study guide... Last night.<eos> All right.<eos> Andrew, as secretary, you call the vote, right?<eos> Right.<eos> All those in favor of Mona as team Captain.<eos> I had so time to campaign.<eos> And Spencer?<eos> A tie.<eos> Unbelievable.
What's with the suitcase?<eos> I mean, I know we've been kind of been avoiding each other, but you're moving out?<eos> You're right, I have been avoiding you, but that's not why I'm leaving.<eos> Um... my dad is staying at Rebecca's now and wants me to move in with him tomorrow.<eos> Rebecca's... where Jordan lives.<eos> Unfortunately.<eos> You know, if you liked him, you could have just told me.<eos> Well, the thing is, I don't.<eos> And now I'm just really sorry that this whole stupid incident came between us.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
Load!<eos> Ready!<eos> John, are you in there?<eos> It's Katie.<eos> I was just in the neighborhood and I figured I'd swing by and... see how you were enjoying your new house.<eos> John?<eos> Fire!<eos> What the...<eos> Reload!<eos> Ready!
He's smarter than that.<eos> He's not gonna tell her anything.<eos> Well, let's find out.<eos> What do I say?<eos> Is there anything special I need to ask him?<eos> Try to engage him about Joey, speak to his paternal instincts.<eos> Make Joey important to him.<eos> Are you sure you want to do this?<eos> I like your new place.<eos> Me, too.
- Nada, zilch, zip, zero.<eos> How would anyone believe such a horrible thing?<eos> What's so horrible?<eos> I believe it.<eos> Nothing's perfect. Nothing lasts forever.<eos> It's nothing to worry about if you really think about it.<eos> Your father should've assigned the zero theorem project to you.<eos> Well, he's been trying to, for as long as I can remember.<eos> - But I refused to work on Zip-T.<eos> - Why?
Look, this call you're waiting for... it's a figment of your imagination.<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> Not by phone at least. Ask your shrink.<eos> Yo, yo, yo, doc, you there?<eos> Tell him there's no phone call.<eos> I'm authorising you to tell him the truth.<eos> Come on, tell him he's delusional.<eos> It's true, Qohen.<eos> Your phone call's a delusion.<eos> Sorry about that.

Friends I'd had at dinner parties at our apartment came in and I waited on them.<eos> I mean, do you have any idea what that's like?<eos> You know, one minute, you're hosting women and the next, you're measuring their shoe size and fitting them.<eos> Erica Bishop came into the store.<eos> She saw me and was so embarrassed for me she slipped out thinking I didn't see her.<eos> I saw you, Erica!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Hey, you got great taste.<eos> Maybe you could do something in fashion.<eos> Or designing. Yeah?
It has to be the right woman, who's a plus for his career.<eos> And I have the social skills required for his future in politics.<eos> For the next few years, we'll be living in Vienna.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna take a shower.<eos> I'll send for my luggage.<eos> I was pretty angry at some of the things she said, but I kept it on the inside.<eos> I'm tired of her knocking you. You know?<eos> Don't even think about taking that last slice of pizza.<eos> - What?<eos> Why?
What the hell are you doing?<eos> Walker, you stop this.. or I'll make sure she spends the rest of her life in a federal prison.<eos> You have 19 minutes.<eos> You're done.<eos> General.<eos> Your boss took the White House.. and your man inside got the president killed.<eos> Carol, calm down.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Thank God for Gerald Ford.<eos> Why?
So, how is the opera?<eos> I didn't think you were interested.<eos> But, since you have asked, I can tell you that our opera is actually progressing very well.<eos> Our?<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have you composed any of the music?<eos> A little.
My job.<eos> My fiancee.<eos> You know, stuff like that.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait. Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> You-you're a doctor, right?<eos> I thought doctors... they're supposed to help people,<eos> - Aren't they?<eos> - People.
Can you make it a novel?<eos> Okay, so, we have white sugar, and brown sugar, and then Splenda.<eos> And I know you like Equal sometimes, but I don't have it, but it's totally fine because I can go ask my neighbor Vivian if you want it.<eos> No, this is--this is perfect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - What's with all the geisha shit?<eos> - What?<eos> Um, what?<eos> I just want to take care of you because you're my boyfriend and I care about you.<eos> Why? What?
The things I'm telling you...<eos> You don't joke around about.<eos> It could be dangerous.<eos> Dangerous. Mm.<eos> You know, most people...<eos> They get into their warm beds at night.<eos> They have no idea what really goes on out there.<eos> The sheer number of people working to destroy our way of life.<eos> You... you know why I've dedicated my life to stopping them?<eos> Why?
Upstairs is empty!<eos> Nothing here, sir.<eos> Mac?<eos> These goons pulled me right out of bed.<eos> I thought this country was still a democracy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For sucking me back into your mess?<eos> There's no point apologizing if you're going to keep doing it.<eos> I've been wanting to talk to you.<eos> Why?
There's no point apologizing if you're going to keep doing it.<eos> I've been wanting to talk to you.<eos> Why?<eos> Got something else in the freezer you want to show me?<eos> Mr. Cross.<eos> Colonel Henderson Hall.<eos> You're Leeds' boss.<eos> We should've talked a long time ago.<eos> Come on.<eos> Him too.
He was locked up because of you.<eos> He still would be if I hadn't gotten him out.<eos> All right, there are some dots I'm not connecting here.<eos> If you work at Seung, how did you pull a guy from lock-up?<eos> I'm not at Seung.<eos> I took another offer.<eos> I don't like where this is going.<eos> Colonel Hall has asked me to be the civilian director at Project Magnet.<eos> I accepted.<eos> Why?
Jeannie Van Der hooven...<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> To engagement manager. Manager?<eos> That doesn't even mean anything.<eos> What? Wow! Congratulations.<eos> Thank you so much. Well, you know what?<eos> That's enough talk.<eos> Let's get to work moving this company forward.<eos> Look at you, huh?<eos> Jeannie!
What decision?<eos> About the apartment.<eos> We call my dad for the deposit and go for it!<eos> Right, the deposit...<eos> I wanted to talk about that.<eos> After all, the money was set aside for Burkina Faso.<eos> Shouldn't we persuade your father to return it to the Burkinians...<eos> Burkinees?<eos> What do you suggest?<eos> Burkinonians?
No, please. No, no. Please, please!<eos> I'm gonna go and put you on the wireless system.<eos> This is what we use in Vallejo PD.<eos> Can you make sure we get the whole street?<eos> So I can see which cars are parked.<eos> Hey, where are you going?<eos> To school.<eos> - Yeah, I'm gonna drive you.<eos> - I'm taking the bus. No, I will drive you.<eos> Why?
I dunno.<eos> But somebody in Oakland burned me.<eos> And we need to smoke 'em out.<eos> We?<eos> Yeah, I need your password for the database.<eos> IAD suspended me.<eos> Whoa, whoa. Someone in Oakland sold me out.<eos> All right? Now they're trying to take my badge.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Why now?
Gurudev, make him see sense.<eos> Don't be stubborn... forget it.<eos> What are yöu doing?<eos> yöur feet are swollen!<eos> Give it a rest now.<eos> Let me run.<eos> yöu know what this means to me...<eos> O Lord, keep my honour.<eos> On yöur marks.<eos> Set.
Hiring you was the worst mistake I have ever made.<eos> Steve, it doesn't have to be this way.<eos> Okay. That's done.<eos> Boards don't run companies. The people who create the product run the company. He has the nerve to tell me we should have used the 512.<eos> We knew 128 kilobytes wasn't gonna get it done when we built it. Sculley is leaving for China tonight.<eos> He's gonna be there for a week, so we got time.<eos> We just gotta recruit.<eos> Sieve, Sculley's gonna find out.<eos> And then what happens, you know? He's the CEO of the company now.<eos> Well, for now.
We need to go back to who we are, and what we do best, and throw away everything else. Here's how we're gonna do it. We're gonna build a new line of computers for the home, and for the office.<eos> The next generation of Macintosh. And we're gonna kill every other project. Everything.<eos> We're also gonna double down on the advertising budget. Chiat Day will be the only advertising agency we use. Just like back in the old days.<eos> But I will not be able to move forward without the Board's permission to operate under complete autonomy. I'll be made a full voting member of the Board. And lastly...<eos> Now, hold on.<eos> I'm the CEO, and this is... Look, you put me in this position. Apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom, and it's leaking water.<eos> All right, let's put this to a vote.<eos> Those in favor?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Sorry, Gil.
I'm rich.<eos> Great job.<eos> You didn't enjoy it.<eos> I know I'm not very good.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Plus it's so sad being good, you risk becoming deft.<eos> It didn't seem like you cared much.<eos> You're very beautiful, Orietta, very, very, very beautiful.<eos> I take photos, you know.<eos> Of myself.
Couple of reasons, first Liber8.<eos> Kagame accomplished his mission apparently, with Travis captured and Sonya in control, what's next?<eos> Well, it's a multi-layered approach to... How'd you put it?<eos> Revolution against the corporations.<eos> It's gonna take time, you know, to infiltrate the criminal world, the business world, the political world...<eos> What's reason number two?<eos> I need money.<eos> That's really interesting because I happen to have quite a lot of it these days.<eos> Yeah, because of me.<eos> Because of you?
Is it popeye?<eos> No. It's not popeye. But you'd know him.<eos> Now, this guy, who is not popeye, wants something that I have.<eos> Now, I'm happy to give it to him, but I want to be compensated.<eos> It's a transaction.<eos> So transact.<eos> There a hitch?<eos> The guy's the hitch.<eos> He's not famous for being reasonable, and he seems to resent the fact that I've invited him to do this business.<eos> Why?
She laugh?<eos> I was funny, right?<eos> Not as funny as you were tonight.<eos> And I thought I was the comedian.<eos> Try this one...<eos> a guy walks into a bar. By the end of the week, he's a grand richer.<eos> No joke. See ya, toots.<eos> Want some company? Ooh, okay.<eos> Whoa, whoa. Hang on.<eos> Why?
This right here!<eos> With my highest regards!<eos> We should go now.<eos> Just give me a sec. Give me a sec.<eos> I-I-I need a sec. I got to...<eos> I got to take this in.<eos> Did you see? !<eos> Did you see their faces? !<eos> That's the look I'm talking about, when they see the cards laid down on the table!<eos> 'Cause of you.
Deal with this, Spider-Man.<eos> Whoa! Seriously, Nova, you've got to learn to shut...<eos> Up?<eos> The crane's about to fall.<eos> What do I do here?<eos> Shoot them at each other.<eos> - What?<eos> - Point your web shooters at each other.<eos> Claws, please.<eos> Unbelievable.
Meet Wilson at the casino.<eos> Wilson will give you a k.<eos> You are gonna use that key to go to the cage and open box 765.<eos> You are gonna remove the contents of that box.<eos> 300 racks.<eos> Domestic.<eos> I want you to give what's inside that briefcae to Mr. Herrera.<eos> He's the gaming commissioner, which makes him Caesar in this country.<eos> Without him, we can't operate.<eos> My friend.
Your problem is with me, let him go.<eos> Hey, Herrera, if you hadn't acted like an asshole, you wouldn't be on your knees right now.<eos> So don't try to be noble.<eos> Basically, this place is to crocodiles what Goldman Sachs is to pricks with skinny ties.<eos> There's just a fucking ton of them.<eos> Cruise ships come down here, they dump off their edible waste, the crocs have learned to swim downriver and they know to bite whatever jumps in the water.<eos> This shit is chicken fat.<eos> I don't know why, but for some reason these fuckers really like poultry.<eos> All right, go ahead.<eos> All right, ready?
No, I can't trust you.<eos> I did trust you!<eos> I didn't know that he was going to use you.<eos> Stop fucking lying to me!<eos> Ivan is set to pull out of this place in a week.<eos> We're moving to Antigua.<eos> And?<eos> And he's looking to hang things on someone.<eos> A mark.<eos> Me.
- How's it going?<eos> Catching anything?<eos> - No, You're going to trick the fish?<eos> Make them think there's something to eat.<eos> - What have you got the the hook?<eos> - Worms.<eos> - Did you put on the worm yourself?<eos> - Yes, it was wrapping around my fingers.<eos> Does your ears ring?<eos> Mine too.
He was mine!<eos> - What a hell does that have to do it with it?<eos> - Maybe I also wanted to play the bass.<eos> You had decided that he was mine and then you took him!<eos> That's your fault!<eos> - It's your fault too!<eos> - You took him!<eos> - It's all your fault.<eos> Go to hell!<eos> - Thanks, you too!
Yes, doctor.<eos> Hey, Lena.<eos> Robert.<eos> You didn't need to come down.<eos> I just need a suicide eval post-op.<eos> That's not a problem.<eos> And it's "Rob," by the way.<eos> I was "Robby"<eos> until my fourth-grade teacher told me I was too old for the "Y."<eos> Oh. Sorry.
It's not merely to see the unseen, but to bring those visions home,<eos> to share with those we love.<eos> Maybe the goal of parenting is to become obsolete.<eos> I read that book, too.<eos> So, what do you think our next move is?<eos> We know they've been documenting her as "Adeline."<eos> Hopefully, when we get into Aster Corps,<eos> - we'll get some real answers.<eos> - Yeah, but do you trust this guy?<eos> Calvin?
They've got a judgment against you, a lien to garnish your wages on a monthly basis.<eos> How much?<eos> You keep 800 per month.<eos> Right, um... let me speak to my lawyer before you give these guys anything.<eos> Jim, I'm sorry but we're gonna have to let you go.<eos> We cannot have employees that are having financial troubles protecting our money.<eos> You get what I mean?<eos> We're a bonded firm, we'll lose our insurance, we'll lose our clients... we just can't have you working here, not under these conditions.<eos> Think of how it looks, and it's not good.<eos> Severance...
And I'm gonna need your weapon and employee ID too.<eos> Jim... hey man, listen...<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't know!<eos> I can't answer the phone right now, just leave a message.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> Hey Jim what's up, it's Sean.<eos> Look, I didn't know it was gonna happen, all right?<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> I love you bro, please give me a call.<eos> Rosie?
Jim... hey man, listen...<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't know!<eos> I can't answer the phone right now, just leave a message.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> Hey Jim what's up, it's Sean.<eos> Look, I didn't know it was gonna happen, all right?<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> I love you bro, please give me a call.<eos> Rosie?<eos> Rosie?

I love you bro, please give me a call.<eos> Rosie?<eos> Rosie?<eos> Rosie?<eos> Rosie...<eos> Baby...<eos> Baby?<eos> Oh my God, baby...<eos> Oh my God, oh no...<eos> Rosie?
Rosie?<eos> Rosie?<eos> Rosie?<eos> Rosie...<eos> Baby...<eos> Baby?<eos> Oh my God, baby...<eos> Oh my God, oh no...<eos> Rosie?<eos> Rosie... 911...
Rosie?<eos> Rosie?<eos> Rosie...<eos> Baby...<eos> Baby?<eos> Oh my God, baby...<eos> Oh my God, oh no...<eos> Rosie?<eos> Rosie... 911...<eos> Rosie, Rosie...
So you had her killed.<eos> No.<eos> What about Jake Thatcher?<eos> He was my friend.<eos> Tim Parker?<eos> Eleanor's husband?<eos> Your wife?<eos> She lives in San Diego now.<eos> With the man that took her from me.<eos> Cheater.
Why amputate his arm?<eos> Did Freddie write anything about this?<eos> Not that I know of, no.<eos> Abel Gideon didn't kill this man;<eos> the Chesapeake Ripper did.<eos> You said the Chesapeake Ripper would want to kill Gideon for taking credit for his work.<eos> Gideon isn't alone anymore, and the Ripper isn't going to risk exposure, so, no, he's... he's, um...<eos> He's telling us where to catch him.<eos> Actually, he's telling you.<eos> Me?
Half truths.<eos> That a violent patient swallowed his tongue while he was attacking me.<eos> I didn't tell him how or why or who was responsible.<eos> You protect your patient from Jack Crawford, but I can't protect mine. Not anymore.<eos> Even the very best psychiatrists have an inherent limitation to their professional abilities.<eos> You may find that difficult to accept. You're right.<eos> It is.<eos> You have to maintain boundaries, Hannibal.<eos> When the pressures of my personal and professional relationships with Will grow too great, I assure you... I'll find a way to relieve them.<eos> Much better now.
- You must be thirsty.?<eos> Cutler tells me that you declined his hospitality, but you will do me the honour, sir.<eos> You may break me, sir, but I will not break my oath!<eos> Open up and let the Devil in!<eos> Open up and let the Devil in, my boy!<eos> Open up and let the Devil in!<eos> Well, I have no recollection of consuming anything of the remotest son.<eos> A man can hold a great deal inside that he does not comprehend.<eos> I am not familiar with these symbols, though.<eos> Nor I.
I've always wanted to be a warrior.<eos> I see things sometimes.<eos> I hear these whispers, but I don't always know if they're real or not.<eos> I need to do something.<eos> I know.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You just told me-- Roman, maybe this is something you should be discussing with your guidance counselor.<eos> The fuck is that supposed to mean?<eos> ! It means no! I know it's not a word you're used to hearing,<eos> - but no.
What does that mean?<eos> Mira's her life.<eos> I don't mind, it's just how it is.<eos> 'Ee, I'm sure you both are.<eos> Is that what you're like with your kids?<eos> I don't have kids.<eos> Well, when you were growing up, then?<eos> Well, it was er... just me and my dad.<eos> But he was more into his hobbies.<eos> Such as?
I need to know that if the... if the decision goes against you, you won't punish me for it.<eos> You're still worried that I'll spill our old secret?<eos> I would just like your word on it.<eos> I do think you're a good man.<eos> No. I'm not.<eos> But I am a good teacher, and I'll fight for that with any means I have.<eos> And why should I promise you?<eos> Hey, Tom, give me the usual.<eos> Make it on the weak side.<eos> Ready?
And then Donna showed up.<eos> I've seen more of Donna in the last two weeks than I have in the last decade.<eos> We were alone for exactly 65 seconds.<eos> I timed it.<eos> Just imagine what would've happened if we had another 19 seconds.<eos> I can't even... uhh!<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - Sebastian.<eos> - Hey, guys.
I was there with my dad.<eos> We hung out, but nothing happened.<eos> It's because of Carrie?<eos> Apparently, enough happened that she's all snuggled up in your clothes.<eos> I mean, it was cold out.<eos> Were you playing night golf?<eos> We might have been smoking some pot.<eos> Okay.<eos> I didn't want you to know that.<eos> Why?
Whoever the top-flight minds are in the field, offer them... whatever you need to.<eos> Consider any budgetary requirements for this project pre-approved.<eos> Norman... will never agree.<eos> Norman will agree to what's best.<eos> For Letha.<eos> I'll start reviewing candidates immediately.<eos> I, um... I need some fresh air.<eos> Uh, I'll be right outside, darling.<eos> Would you like to see something, glowworm?<eos> Beautiful.
Listen, luv, you've obviously read the book on "Hostage Negotiation 101"...<eos> Can we just skip to the bit where you tell me I'm better than this?<eos> - You are.<eos> - What if I'm not?<eos> Losing your powers was the best thing that could have happened to you.<eos> I feel like I've finally met the real Vex!<eos> He's a true artist.<eos> He's a gentle soul!<eos> And he will not be trifled with.<eos> Not even by her!
He said he was finished with that.<eos> Is he around?<eos> I have some questions I'd like to ask him.<eos> He moved a month back.<eos> Good damn riddance.<eos> Have you ever seen this man?<eos> I don't know, maybe he's one of Dusty's new friends.<eos> New friends?<eos> My son gets clean for the first time in years and then goes off and joins some dumbass religion.<eos> - Religion?
Just what the doctor ordered.<eos> Are you all right, Victor?<eos> Me? I'm fine.<eos> Never better.<eos> So how is your restaurant plan going?<eos> Still got your mysterious investor on board?<eos> Ah, that.<eos> I don't think she was ever serious.<eos> Oh, I am sorry.<eos> Not as sorry as me.
Yeah.<eos> Maggie had never thought much about the future, but maybe she needed to.<eos> It was an uncomfortable realization that being with Walt couldn't be her only goal.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> We need to add a few more mini marshmallows.<eos> There.<eos> Looks just like my mom's.<eos> Mission accomplished.<eos> Sweet potatoes in the oven.<eos> Check.
Okay.<eos> Carrie Bradshaw. Oh. Microphone and everything.<eos> Carrie Bradshaw, when I look at you, I see myself years ago when my power was pure and young.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh. Thank you.<eos> But I was foolish. I sold my power.<eos> I relinquished my vagina.<eos> Learn from my mistakes, Carrie Bradshaw.<eos> Never let a man...<eos> Any man...
No, not anymore.<eos> Maybe we should exchange numbers.<eos> So you can track me down if you need to sue me?<eos> Or so you could ask me out on a date.<eos> Even though My dad wasn't ready to date... he now knew he was ready to move on.<eos> I knocked you on your ass.<eos> That's because you have a really big butt.<eos> Admit defeat.<eos> I'm happy to leave this table but I'm not leaving this diner.<eos> Why?
You're still with him, aren't you?<eos> Okay, Seth, maybe this has gone too far.<eos> I...<eos> I--<eos> I can't believe you slept with someone else.<eos> Why?<eos> You did.<eos> Yeah, but it's different.<eos> Really?<eos> Why?
"With no knowledge comes vulnerability."<eos> What we don't know about the people we love or what we don't know about love, period, can be scary.<eos> But maybe that fear is okay.<eos> What is out there that is unknown can propel us to do more.<eos> (Knock on door) Can we talk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay, you're scaring me a little.<eos> Of course, these days everything seems to be scaring me a little.<eos> (Chuckles) Me, too.
- You sure?<eos> - I'm not afraid to be on my own.<eos> I already told you that.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm really, really sorry.<eos> I know. You told me a hundred times.<eos> Really?<eos> So no one like the title?<eos> No one.
It's not like you told me yours.<eos> Sebastian.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I told you i loved you a week ago.<eos> I kept thinking you were waiting to tell me you loved me because you're such a perfectionist.<eos> That-that's not true.<eos> Then why didn't you say it?<eos> Is it because you don't feel it?<eos> No.<eos> Then why?
Yep.<eos> I reckon if you stood on tiptoe with a telescope, you could see the Hunchback of Notre Dame's arse.<eos> It's, um. Beige.<eos> There's a certain light-brownness about it, yes.<eos> Meg. Meg, don't do this, Meg.<eos> Last time, when we were here before, it was bigger, plus grand, different colour, différente couleur.<eos> So you recommend we should redecorate?<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Merde.<eos> - Sorry, sir.
I'm just curious.<eos> You leave the rehearsal dinner early saying you've got a tummy ache, yet when I get home, you're not there.<eos> I told you, I went to the pharmacy, and when I got home, the bed was empty, and you still haven't told me where you were.<eos> That's right.<eos> I haven't.<eos> I know how hard this has been on you and Sutton.<eos> I never wanted any of this to happen.<eos> Then explain it.<eos> How could you do this to Mom?<eos> And to us?
And this might sound crazy, but I'm doing all of this for you, Mads.<eos> So I can finally be free of her.<eos> Jordan.<eos> You need to be careful.<eos> Rebecca might be more dangerous than even you realize.<eos> I know a lot more than you think.<eos> And not only about Rebecca.<eos> About...<eos> Sutton.<eos> And Emma.
Oh, we pissed him off.<eos> I think she likes you.<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> Sit your bitch-asses down.<eos> Now I am going back to my table.<eos> And the next one of you that gets up out of this booth is gonna be pissing sitting down for the rest of his life.<eos> It's Zack's Diner, just off the interstate...<eos> - Oh, sure, narc on a sister. She...<eos> I mean, he has a knife.<eos> Job!
- Yeah.<eos> What is it?<eos> I need you to stay someplace else for a few days.<eos> What?<eos> - Hey, Dad, can we go?<eos> - Why?<eos> Hold on, sweetheart Just give me a sec, okay?<eos> Gracie, what the hell's going on?<eos> Can you just do it, please?<eos> Why?
There's a queue!<eos> I'm waiting as well!<eos> - I'll be quick.<eos> In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<eos> - Amen.<eos> I humbly confess to Almighty God and to you, Father for all my sins and trespasses back from last Easter.<eos> It's not that I sinned much.<eos> Except I curse.<eos> And what do you curse?<eos> - All.
Anna knows.<eos> Knows.<eos> You've managed to play the country, you can't play me.<eos> You're not a man.<eos> You're not.<eos> I know it.<eos> I'll come back in the morning, before work, to collect the ones you'll pierce by then.<eos> And... not a word!<eos> And espe...<eos> Especially to Rev. Jacob.
What's he so angry about?<eos> His father.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing back here?<eos> I wanted to talk to you about what Spencer said at the cemetery.<eos> You going to tell me she made that up...<eos> Ali being pregnant.<eos> Come on, Emily, that wasn't breaking news to any of you.<eos> It doesn't mean it's true, just because Cece said it.<eos> Cece?
And I would rather do that in my pants than leave you two alone.<eos> Classy girl.<eos> I'm so proud.<eos> It'll take me a sec. I know where the keys are.<eos> What is all this?<eos> Looks like someone's offering me a drink.<eos> Is this some kind of sick joke?<eos> Yeah, or how Wilden returns phone calls.<eos> Who would do all this?<eos> Unbelievable.
I can't.<eos> It disappeared in the accident.<eos> What?<eos> Is Jason okay?<eos> Can we see him?<eos> Uh... yeah, he's over there.<eos> He asked me to get him some more water.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Me too.
He's done it before and he has a bastard son.<eos> He is Warwick's puppet, Elizabeth.<eos> Without him, Edward could never have claimed the throne.<eos> Warwick is the kingmaker.<eos> You can be very sure he will make the queen as well.<eos> You are wrong.<eos> Edward is king!<eos> He does not have to do what Warwick tells him.<eos> You are wrong!<eos> Elizabeth?

Yes, ride off.<eos> So then, Rosie. Sit in motion.<eos> Fucking French.<eos> Come on, Rosie.<eos> Come, come.<eos> What is it?<eos> Come here.<eos> Contact me, darling.<eos> How's it going with you and the maid?<eos> Worst.
I've got somethin' to show ya.<eos> Q-a-9-5-8-8.<eos> Come on.<eos> Q-a-9-5-8-8.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> That truck there.<eos> Get closer!<eos> Q-a-9-5-8-8.<eos> Un-frickin'-believable.
Actually, she runs just fine.<eos> Hey.<eos> Morning, Nash.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Morning. - McNally, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.<eos> Marlo Cruz.<eos> - Didn't get a chance to meet last week.<eos> - Yeah, real pleasure.
What are you doing here?<eos> Back on duty.<eos> Thought you might want a ride?<eos> Unless you like driving in with your dad.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not really supposed to accept rides from strangers.<eos> Gail, come on.<eos> I left you four messages.<eos> I've been sitting in a conference room in mississauga for a week, going over everything from the last six months.<eos> Chief, drug squad, handlers...
It's, uh, branch manager Darren Kudlow.<eos> And medics aren't sure he's gonna make it.<eos> No one can reach his wife.<eos> All right, would you get Collins and Peck to track her down and take her to the hospital, please?<eos> In the meantime, let's go talk to some more witnesses and see if we can get a better description on the shooter, yeah?<eos> - Cynthia Kudlow?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> We're here about your husband Darren.<eos> Why?
Yeah.<eos> I-I'll leave.<eos> Now, Dale!<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine!<eos> But I'm changing my Facebook status to single.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> He's always been really clingy.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Unbelievable.
You know, it was fun, and I've always wondered what it would be like to be with a woman, but, uh, I don't know.<eos> I think for me it was more of a one-time thing.<eos> Look, you don't have to worry.<eos> I'm not going to show up at your house with a U-Haul.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> Well, you could walk out first.<eos> Or we could make it a two-time thing?<eos> Was it good for you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You?
I mean, he kicked butt with all this Valentine's Day stuff and he's like two inches taller than what I am.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I won't.<eos> I love you and that means something to me.<eos> It's not just words.<eos> Well, are you afraid that I'm gonna leave you for someone?<eos> Not as much anymore.<eos> Good.<eos> Because it's me and you against the world.<eos> Especially Ryder.
Tubbington-Bopp, and it is headed straight for Lima.<eos> Wait, so is it an asteroid or a comet?<eos> It's both.<eos> Wouldn't NASA know something about this?<eos> We can't trust NASA.<eos> I mean, last month a meteor exactly like Tubbington-Bopp hit Russia with no warning at all.<eos> Oh, so now it's a meteor. That's right, Artie, And when this meteorite hits, I will not be spending my time in this room preparing for regionals.<eos> I will be spending my last hours making amends with somebody who I need to get right with.<eos> Someone who I love very much.<eos> Lord Tubbington.
And quite frankly, I don't feel safe knowing there's some kid with a gun stuffed in his backpack walking around these halls. No.<eos> Either the kid took the gun home, in which case, they won't be able to bring it back because of the new metal detectors.<eos> Or the kid stashed it somewhere here at school.<eos> Yeah.<eos> In which case, the police are going to find it.<eos> I mean, they are searching every locker, and interviewing every single student.<eos> Every single student?<eos> Then when they find who did it, the kid's going to be expelled.<eos> Well, no student's going to get expelled.<eos> Why not?
The man who has Hood is a gangster named Rabbit.<eos> He and I have a history.<eos> It's me he's here for.<eos> That's why he took Max.<eos> He's got a small army with him and he's not gonna think twice about killing you or me or anyone else who gets in his way.<eos> Well, what were you and the A-Team over here planning to do?<eos> He's going to kill him. He may already have.<eos> Please, we are wasting time right now.<eos> This-- this is crazy.<eos> Sorry, I don't--
Well, either I'll take him with me or else he'll stay here with Ricky.<eos> I'll get an apartment close to school and I'll put John in day care and I'll go to school.<eos> That's going to be really hard.<eos> Yeah, and really expensive.<eos> I mean, who's going to pay for that?<eos> I have a scholarship.<eos> That covers an apartment and day care?<eos> How much money does Ricky make working in that butcher shop?<eos> Not enough. So if you could take care of John, then I'll go talk to my dad and see if he'd be willing to help me out.<eos> Us out.
And you think you are worthy of such considerations?<eos> Of that I do not know, my Lord, but I do know that a country life does not suit me.<eos> Dido the Reverend Davinier has asked me to take his son under my tutelage.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Thank you for your gracious support.<eos> I neither spoke for or against you since neither is my place.<eos> Silence speaks volumes.<eos> Papa's new student.<eos> Mr. Davinier... my cousin, Elizabeth.<eos> A pleasure.
Oh, God, back it in.<eos> Whoa, please!<eos> Hi. Hi.<eos> You're the first chick over forty to give me a boner.<eos> Great.<eos> Want to go get a drink?<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> Maybe. Maybe.<eos> That's the only reason girls hit on me.<eos> Oh, sorry, yeah.
Fuck!<eos> Who the fuck keeps putting lions in the back?<eos> Fourteen dollars.<eos> Fourteen dollars?<eos> Is it magic fucking whiskey?<eos> Do I get a motorcycle with it? Is it served in Jesus's shoe?<eos> Can I sit in your lap?<eos> Obviously.<eos> I like where this is going.<eos> Me, too.
Look at it! Look at it!<eos> Look at it. Giving it to you!<eos> Higher.<eos> My name is Detective Mullins.<eos> You'd better lay your ass down.<eos> I smell bacon. I smell bacon.<eos> Biscuits are done!<eos> Let's do it again!<eos> No! Stop playing this song!<eos> Why?
It was pretty gross.<eos> Why is my jacket in the pot?<eos> Don't worry. I'll get it right back.<eos> Let's see what you got.<eos> Oh, shit. That's great.<eos> Good evening. That's great.<eos> There you go.<eos> I didn't think you'd care that much about your jacket. You didn't care at all when you gave away your car.<eos> Who did I give it to?<eos> To Wayne!
And here shop supplies.<eos> - Office Do?<eos> Were selling cartridges for printers.<eos> I told him that the idea is idiotic, but if you heard me?<eos> You open a Chinese restaurant.<eos> Then the Chinese burned it.<eos> This is dad's funeral.<eos> Poor, tired of it ever forgive him money.<eos> You'll have to do fotorobot.<eos> My father?
Quit the fucking prancing.<eos> If the wind could give me wings I'd leave the darkening earth<eos> I'd soar into the night sky - up among the brightening stars<eos> If I were young, guess what I'd do.<eos> But you're not.<eos> You're just as old as you feel.<eos> Fuck that!<eos> Fuck that!<eos> If it's her, I'm not in.<eos> - Me neither.
It states that you will show me absolute submission<eos> You'll be my slave<eos> You'll renounce your identity completely<eos> Your body, your soul your honor will be mine forever<eos> Sign<eos> Well?<eos> It was supposed to be one year<eos> So you're dictating the terms?<eos> May I read it?<eos> Why?
Now you're preaching to me!<eos> Why sneak around?<eos> If I don't, Dad will kill me.<eos> Why is your father after you?<eos> You're my boyfriend for the day so start acting like one.<eos> No more questions.<eos> I'm returning this.<eos> Keep it.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> - Why not?
Help me!<eos> Only you can help us.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Neither do I!<eos> Can you tell me?<eos> He really needs to make a movie so help him.<eos> That's cool.<eos> - Come back tomorrow.<eos> - No, now!<eos> Why?
I love you very much.<eos> I love you too, Dad.<eos> OK.<eos> Light, camera, action!<eos> One thing.<eos> Is there a script?<eos> Oh, do we need one?<eos> Director.<eos> You have to see how efficient the boys are now.<eos> Ready, fellas?
I love you too, Dad.<eos> OK.<eos> Light, camera, action!<eos> One thing.<eos> Is there a script?<eos> Oh, do we need one?<eos> Director.<eos> You have to see how efficient the boys are now.<eos> Ready, fellas?<eos> Ready?
Try a pan from here.<eos> That's good.<eos> Ready for a grand melee?<eos> Guys in the hall?<eos> Ready when you are!<eos> Lights, ready!<eos> Booms, ready!<eos> Cameras, ready!<eos> Actors, ready!<eos> Ready...
No fucking way!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ready.<eos> Action!<eos> Cut!<eos> The sound's good.<eos> Sasaki, get him!<eos> Sasaki.<eos> Ready.
At sea.<eos> We'll take the "Corina" to Canada and then we'll get a flight... somewhere.<eos> Somewhere?<eos> I can't tell you, Kat.<eos> No one can know...<eos> not dad, not mom.<eos> Not Irwin.<eos> No. No!<eos> He'll try to be useful and do something rash, so especially not Irwin.<eos> Not Irwin.
Must be hard.<eos> Of course, it makes it easy for them to lie to you.<eos> Nearly every man killed in France has had an easy death.<eos> And when there's no body, no-one at home can say it wasn't.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Joe Middleton.<eos> Then he'll know the truth about it.<eos> Trouble is, he's over there.<eos> But he would have told someone when he was at home.<eos> Maybe not his family, but someone.
Well, of course.<eos> What did you think?<eos> She has to surrender.<eos> She has to be taught to make the will of the man her own.<eos> How else do you think she can be cured?<eos> I think you're after power for its own sake.<eos> You're not interested in curing Caro at all.<eos> I'm going to forgive that remark.<eos> Put it down to youth and displaced anger.<eos> What anger?
He said if he did it again, he'd get to the front, hold the inside and run his heart out and over his dead body would anybody come past him.<eos> "That's the brave way to do it," he said.<eos> We were happy.<eos> Will you come and watch?<eos> Welcome to our annual village Rondo.<eos> Now, after much deliberation, I have decided the honour for starting this year's race will go to...<eos> Margaret Boden.<eos> Please come forward, Mrs Boden.<eos> Ready!<eos> Ready.
Right, thanks.<eos> I like that you didn't let up there on the mighty chairman.<eos> You take it.<eos> I don't care for limousines.<eos> Well, neither do I -<eos> I'm just a two-star general, don't get assigned a limousine.<eos> Take the subway.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> You too.
He's going to die in there.<eos> Or worse.<eos> Thanks, Mac.<eos> You really saved my ass.<eos> All of our asses, really.<eos> Well, it was your ass that I did it for.<eos> You might want to rephrase that.<eos> Um... no.<eos> Don't tell Evan about this.<eos> Why?
Burned the house down.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> So, I see you've met Gus.<eos> Gus used to guard a Ming Dynasty Imperial tomb.<eos> So, he comes with the house?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> You see, Pindar hates the place.<eos> I hate it.<eos> And no jacuzzi?<eos> Well, sorry.
We also do malpractice.<eos> I'll take one of your cards.<eos> Good God!<eos> Levator scapulae muscle strain.<eos> That should do it.<eos> I should, uh, actually get going.<eos> What...what about your drink?<eos> Um, I don't usually drink with clients.<eos> So, I'll get my office to invoice you.<eos> Thanks, guys.
What?<eos> No.<eos> Ha.<eos> No, I was just thinking about... stuff.<eos> Let's go get you your sandwich.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shh.<eos> - Shh.<eos> We can't wake up Pete.<eos> - Why?
You guys have been like... really nice.<eos> And I'm not used... to people being nice.<eos> What I am used to is lying... stealing... getting beaten up and not being able to trust another living soul for what feels like 500 years, and I--<eos> I'm just--I'm so-- so damned tired of it.<eos> All I want is for, like, a normal life.<eos> That's the first honest thing you've said to me in three days.<eos> Oh!<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> We're doing this now.<eos> Uhh.
I knew I couldn't trust you.<eos> Thank you, Lars, and thank you, Warehouse 13.<eos> Hey. Okay.<eos> So which would you prefer, Sandy beaches or rocky mountains?<eos> Because I just found two kick-ass youth shelters<eos> - in Miami and--<eos> - Whatever.<eos> The sooner I get away from your partner, the better.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
- This is nice.<eos> - How long has it been?<eos> Ana, my sister...<eos> Twelve.<eos> Twelve years? Twelve years.<eos> Thirteen, I think.<eos> - Thirteen, twelve...<eos> - Flavia? You must be Flavia.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Same here.
No more bets.<eos> - Black on four!<eos> - Four on the black.<eos> It's weird to bet on 11, if my favourite number is 27.<eos> And that's my birthday.<eos> Then we'll bet them all.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Gloria. - Marcela.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - Likewise.
Finally, peace.<eos> Would it be so bad, really? Staying here?<eos> Daddy?<eos> You've got to stop looking for me.<eos> No, don't say that.<eos> You are exactly like me.<eos> I would just keep pushing and pushing and pushing.<eos> And people would tell me to stop, and I wouldn't.<eos> And look at what it did to me.<eos> To your mother.

Thank you.<eos> Now I know all your secrets.<eos> Well, I think I'll take a little walk.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> She likes you.<eos> Oh, I don't know about that.<eos> I can tell.<eos> Doctors say you'll be out in a couple days.<eos> Thanks to you.
Looks like the town's secured. We need to find any stragglers and get them to safety.<eos> Shtako. I zigged when I should've zagged.<eos> How bad is it? Doc Yewll will patch you up good as new.<eos> Tommy.<eos> Doc?<eos> Doc!<eos> Where the hell is she?<eos> Were you in the storm?<eos> - Sukar attacked me.<eos> - Sukar?
And it's odd to say this, but if we're lucky, her type of psychosis is postpartum.<eos> Like baby blues?<eos> No, that's Postpartum Sadness.<eos> Then there's Postpartum Depression.<eos> Hormonal changes, no sleep, no help...<eos> Every day is a living hell.<eos> You say that like you've been through it.<eos> Postpartum Psychosis is totally different.<eos> It's rare, but it could happen to any woman.<eos> Good mothers.
All right, listen up. Listen up.<eos> Top issue of the day -- city's paying its respects to the fine citizen Felix "The Cat" Javier, major-league roller who was shot and killed at the hands of officers from Exposition Division.<eos> Ash and Jones, baby! Ash and Jones!<eos> Thank you, Dudek.<eos> I'm here all week, folks.<eos> And, uh, while most people would assume that the death of a big-time asshole like Felix would be a cause for celebration, we know better.<eos> Since his death, the number of drug-related arrests has actually gone up.<eos> And the little fish are...knocking each other off trying to fill the big fish's void.<eos> And our, uh, response to this -- this paradox... Is to take the fight to them.<eos> So, uh...
Uh, we got a few anonymous tips.<eos> Uh, the first one -- that there's a tweaker who fit the description.<eos> He liked to cop his dope in an alley off of Repetto.<eos> We found him, tried to talk to him, and, well, he bolted.<eos> And the second one was that a dead cop's gun can be found in a dumpster on 4th and Central.<eos> We called our buddy Chuck Munoz.<eos> He works vice over there.<eos> He's got a black-and-white that's holding that down for you guys now.<eos> Yeah, well, the moment those tips came in, you should have let us know.<eos> Well, why?
We need an airship. Get S.W.A.T. rolling.<eos> So, these tanks -- they go on for acres, all right?<eos> We don't want to go in there. We'll wait for airship to get here to get eyes.<eos> But I bet he's on top of one of those things.<eos> Yeah, he's a sitting duck up there.<eos> Yeah, well, not so fast, okay? We're not gonna rush in there.<eos> If he's got Cooper's gun, it's still got 14 rounds in the mag.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure he wasn't suggesting that we climb up there and get picked off one by one.<eos> Yeah, what the hell's wrong with you, man? What's wrong with me?<eos> Yeah, you.
Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where's Archie?<eos> Somewhere.<eos> He said he was coming, so...<eos> What are you doing, you benny?<eos> You trying to get us kicked out?<eos> Here y'are.<eos> Make yourself useful and take a picture of the biggest pythons in sports entertainment.<eos> What, these ones?
'Arrgh!<eos> '<eos> All right, I'm coming!<eos> Archie?<eos> I'm wearing a towelling rainbow.<eos> I look like a tube of toothpaste.<eos> Rae, what happened?<eos> I'm really sorry, Archie.<eos> My mum wouldn't let me come out.<eos> Why?
So rather than just put on a little bit of weight, you thought that you would risk getting knocked up? !<eos> Yeah, do you know, that's exactly what I thought!<eos> Uh...!<eos> You know what, Chloe?<eos> Most pregnant women, well, they put on at least... one, two, three...<eos> Yeah, I get the irony of it, Rae!<eos> Rae, if you want your jeans washing inside out, put them in the basket in... side... out!<eos> So what are you gonna do about it, then?<eos> Are you gonna tell Mr Car...<eos> Stephen?
- What?<eos> I've got a bit of a problem.<eos> Well, what's up?<eos> I've got therapy in an hour.<eos> Skip it.<eos> I can't.<eos> Right, so what are you going to tell them, then?<eos> Oh, bollocks to it, I'm just going to tell them all.<eos> Rae, I've thought about that and I don't think you should.<eos> Well, why not?
It's too expensive.<eos> But I love it.<eos> If everyone is going to be there, I have to look nice.<eos> Right, Rae, when I say no to something, it doesn't mean keep arguing, it means end of discussion!<eos> I think I'm going to be sick.<eos> Oh, don't be so dramatic.<eos> 'You always wonder what it would be like to sit in front of a doctor 'and hear the worst possible news.<eos> 'How you'd cope, how you'd feel.'<eos> Rae, I'm afraid you're going to have to stop drinking alcohol.<eos> Why?
'So what if my mum was starting a new life?<eos> 'So what if Chloe and Finn were lost to me?<eos> 'No matter what happened, I'd always have the rest of the gang.<eos> 'And I'd always have my diary.'<eos> Excuse me, I left a little blue bag in here when I was here this morning.<eos> - Denim bag? - Yeah.<eos> Um, well, can I have it back, please?<eos> It's got, like, really important documents in it.<eos> I gave it to one of your friends as they left.<eos> - Which friend?

He really misses me.<eos> Yep.<eos> Will he ever have sex with me if I wake up?<eos> I can't answer that.<eos> Will he ever kiss me?<eos> I can't answer that either.<eos> Where is everything?<eos> It's gone.<eos> No-one lives here any more.<eos> Why?
We can close that right away.<eos> - We can?<eos> - Read the report.<eos> She committed suicide.<eos> Jumped off the ferry.<eos> End of story.<eos> - Thanks for your input.<eos> - Was it your case?<eos> No. I tried to get it, but they gave it to Børge Bak.<eos> Bak?
Hi, Merete.<eos> - Did you have a nice day? - Yes.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Okay.<eos> Uffe got impatient in the end.<eos> I had to show him the same episode of "Mr. Bean" three times in a row.<eos> - Did he eat?<eos> - Oh yes.<eos> - He's been in a weird mood.<eos> - How?
- Do you think he's here?<eos> She's not alone.<eos> Check over there.<eos> Merete, time's up, so I'm going to let out all the air.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> Your blood vessels will explode.<eos> Your every cell will cry out to die.<eos> But when the tank is empty, it will all be over.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?
She didn't care.<eos> Trick, it is not Kenzi, I am telling you.<eos> You see?<eos> Put her in holding.<eos> Yes... please...<eos> Thank you.<eos> We have to figure out what happened to her...<eos> In the Keg Room.<eos> No!<eos> Not me!
Where is he?<eos> Sebastian went to meet him somewhere, with the scangen.<eos> A crime scene?<eos> I guess so.<eos> How come no one ever tells me anything?<eos> All I know for sure is that there's a dead woman.<eos> And if it's who I think it is, it's not going to be from natural causes.<eos> Who do you think it is?<eos> Someone I know... intimately.<eos> Oh, sorry.
Oh, yeah?<eos> Next time you won't be able to catch me.<eos> (laughing) Oh, sorry. Uh, Leo, this is my partner... I mean, this is my brother, Darius.<eos> - This is my partner, Leo Beckett.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> So, what'd you call me for?<eos> - What's up?<eos> - Have you seen Dad lately?<eos> No. Why?
We are not prepared to fight the meat eaters.<eos> We are not prepared to deal with them.<eos> We kill, we survive from this disease.<eos> I do not blame them.<eos> They are poisonous and crazy.<eos> They saw us coming, they were waiting for us.<eos> We only source of food for them.<eos> We have prepared a bunch of bull, to be taken to the slaughterhouse.<eos> But we're safe.<eos> Thanks to these people.
Can't sleep?<eos> I was just making some tea.<eos> You want some?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Emma, I just wanted to tell you that I appreciate you letting me stay here.<eos> Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's okay.<eos> I feel so responsible for everything that happened with Dan.<eos> Ethan, it was, it was really wrong of me to ask you to not tell him about Ted.<eos> I did what I did because I wanted to help you.<eos> Why?
I know.<eos> She's gone.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Come on Sutton, think!<eos> You spent all that time with Rebecca.<eos> You must know where she is!<eos> Okay, stop.<eos> We should just let her go.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
What do you say?<eos> Yo, Adam.<eos> -Would you pass me the spy cam?<eos> -Where?<eos> In my bag. In the front.<eos> -Sure.<eos> -Thanks, man.<eos> -Here, heads up. -Whoa!<eos> You're a fucking dick, you know that?<eos> Okay, guys'
Then why lie about it?<eos> I don't have time to talk about this!<eos> You're not the only one that's scared, okay?<eos> Please. If there's something I need to know...<eos> I thought Wilden got Ali pregnant and killed her to keep it a secret.<eos> So is it true?<eos> I don't know what's true.<eos> Wilden's sure going out of his way to deny it, and if there's one thing Ali could do, it's tell a good lie.<eos> If you thought he killed her, why not turn him in?<eos> Oh, to who?
You are not taking away any more of them.<eos> Who's looking cray-cray now?<eos> Aah!<eos> Aah!<eos> Stop!<eos> Where is Wilden?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What happened?<eos> Can you call Hanna and Emily?<eos> Why?
It'll be a lot of fun.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's a big help.<eos> If I ratted out "T," "A" was gonna take one of my three.<eos> She's just trying to scare us.<eos> Well, it's working.<eos> You need to stop looking for Toby.<eos> Just let it go.<eos> You're looking for Toby?<eos> Why?
The head should pass through your body in three to five days.<eos> Unless you start vomiting or have severe cramping, it's best just to let the body eliminate this on its own.<eos> I'm gonna have to shit it out.<eos> If it made it down your esophagus, it should travel the rest of the way.<eos> If it doesn't pass in a week, we'll consider surgery.<eos> Pay close attention to your stool.<eos> I don't think I could miss it.<eos> I'm going to have to put you on suicide watch.<eos> What?<eos> Why?
You never ever forgave me for leaving.<eos> Thirteen people were indicted.<eos> You met all of them.<eos> We traveled together.<eos> I know it was you.<eos> No, it wasn't!<eos> And fuck you for thinking it was!<eos> Right, what did they give you?<eos> Time off for every innocent person that you threw under the bus?<eos> Innocent?
God almighty.<eos> Body of Proof 3x01<eos> - Abducted Original air date February 19, 2013<eos> So this, uh, Dr. Megan Hunt...<eos> Are you gonna tell me what's going on between you two?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Then why are you primping?<eos> Primping?<eos> That's right.<eos> Primping.
I already have my experts.<eos> And if you've got it in your pretty little head to go after Ewing Energies in the divorce, you won't be dealing with Christopher. You'll be dealing with me. You're not a part of that company.<eos> No, no, but I'm part of that family.<eos> You're not the first Pam to fox her way into the henhouse.<eos> I'm one-for-one on flushing out pamelas.<eos> And I plan on being two-for-two.<eos> How does it feel to be a poodle?<eos> Listen, I'm looking for this young lady.<eos> Happen to see her?<eos> Hey, amigo.
From London, too.<eos> And sure knows how to handle this big fella. That's for sure.<eos> Yeah, a friesian like this one you just don't see every day.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Yeah, you got it.<eos> I thought Christopher was about to bust in this door any second.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> This is way more than I asked for.<eos> I know.<eos> Why?
It's your lucky day.<eos> I've been doing a lot of back work lately, so I'd like you to meet The Truth's new sidekick...<eos> Justice!<eos> The Truth... and Justice!<eos> What a team.<eos> So, dime-eyes, don't you think it's weird... that Jules didn't take your last name when you guys got married?<eos> I mean, Cobb's not even her maiden name.<eos> It's Bobby's.<eos> That sounds like a fun conversation.<eos> Bye.
You've betrayed everyone.<eos> Aunt Grace and Sophia, mom and dad, all those people trying to get you elected.<eos> Because of some nanny-cam videos?<eos> It's more than that, and you know it.<eos> So you think I'm some kind of monster?<eos> Tell your wife.<eos> If you don't, I will.<eos> Tonight.<eos> Who do you think she's going to believe?<eos> Me?
So, um... why are you wearing Stephanie's jacket? (Gasps)<eos> Oh, I tried to give it back to her, but I couldn't find her.<eos> We have unfinished business.<eos> Later, stupid!<eos> Go!<eos> So... (Tv playing indistinctly)<eos> What did you do for the rest of the night?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just went to James' to watch TV.<eos> Why?
I don't know why you don't believe me.<eos> I told you, I gave it to the mechanic.<eos> - All $600?<eos> - Yeah, all $600. Pretty much.<eos> - I got the receipt somewhere.<eos> - Oh, just wait.<eos> It's okay, buddy. It's okay.<eos> I'll take him.<eos> What's on his face?<eos> Okay, you ready?
I'm just really glad that my baby's home.<eos> Me too. Me too.<eos> I remember when my man came home after three years from Pelican Bay.<eos> The good girls, they always stick by their man.<eos> Always.<eos> So anyways, when you all moving to Sac, B?<eos> In about three weeks, baby.<eos> You know I've had my financial difficulties lately and my position at the clinic is ending and I can't keep this house anymore.<eos> - Sorry to hear that, B.<eos> - Me too.
It's supposed to be a lot better than nice.<eos> Let's try again, bitch.<eos> Is this a test? Yeah, it's a test.<eos> You pay me a compliment in the next five seconds or I cut your knackers off.<eos> Very nice.<eos> OK, OK, you want my opinion?<eos> Er, yeah.<eos> Right, well, it's a banging dress, you look hot.<eos> But I don't think you should buy it.<eos> Why not?
Just a feeling, I guess.<eos> Right.<eos> A feeling.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> No, you won't, actually.<eos> I've decided to move on.<eos> Why?<eos> Sick of wearing heels.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> Yeah, good luck to you, too.
Um... now I don't have to pretend to fucking like it here. Um...<eos> I'm... I'm new to London. CROWD MURMURING<eos> I moved here with my girlfriend, er... Fucking dyke.<eos> Um... yeah, I am, actually.<eos> Um... so, London... no-one actually tells you what it's really like to live here, do they?<eos> Am I the only one who thinks it's vaguely creepy that one man owns all the bikes?<eos> I mean, I'm... I'm riding along and all I can think is, isn't this pretty much like letting Boris finger you?<eos> You're shit!<eos> Do you know what?<eos> Fuck you.
- Did Luca tell you this bullshit?<eos> - You're hurting me.<eos> He's still covering for you.<eos> I raised him like a son and I'll save him from this shit.<eos> Right, with the money his mom left him.<eos> Watch What you say and do.<eos> I know Where you live.<eos> Go home, you little shit.<eos> Go.<eos> Little shit.
He's using group and this girl against me.<eos> Ian deserves a life too.<eos> Inviting Bethany into it was his choice.<eos> You need to accept it.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Jason, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, I am so sorry.<eos> I'm so... She's getting worse.<eos> "She"?
Those. Nothing, really.<eos> A few weeks ago, Charlie's agent fired her, and she blamed me.<eos> She thought I told him she was a no-show after partying all night.<eos> And did you tell him?<eos> Please.<eos> If I got every crazy, coked-up model fired, I'd have no one to take pictures of. Mm.<eos> Speaking of coke, empty your pockets.<eos> What?<eos> Empty your pockets.<eos> Why?
- You work for the institute?<eos> - No.<eos> The hotel.<eos> And they let you smoke here?<eos> No. The manager would kill me.<eos> Well, at least it got you talking.<eos> Are you having a good night?<eos> You look happy.<eos> Uh, I am. I am. I'm having a great night.<eos> - Why?
Something terrible has to happen.<eos> We don't want that in the ad.<eos> Of course there's no doubt this concept itself is merely a jumping off the point.<eos> A picture of a hotel, even yours, is easy to ignore.<eos> This, or some version of this, demands your attention.<eos> Well, you will continue to have our attention.<eos> Make no mistake, we're not afraid of provocative.<eos> So is there any time left for holiday plans for either of you?<eos> - Happy New Year, everyone.<eos> - You as well.
I was in the third week of my confinement, and a storm was coming.<eos> The nor'easter of '64 that brought so much devastation with it, and for me, something else, something far more savage even than nature.<eos> Oliver Thredson was, to all appearances, a kindly figure, fatherly in his manner.<eos> This face he showed the world, this face of sanity and benevolence, that was his real mask.<eos> Underneath lurked the real Oliver Thredson, an unspeakable monster.<eos> I loved you even when you were still in your mother's womb.<eos> I would have given anything to be a real father to you, but she kept us apart.<eos> I had so much love to give you, son.<eos> She stole it from you.<eos> From both of us.
Do those bastards know What they're taking away from us?<eos> What will you call him?<eos> Simbad.<eos> Nice. Unusual.<eos> Shall We fill out the forms?<eos> What's that on yourjaw?<eos> I had my Wisdom tooth pulled.<eos> Nothing serious.<eos> Focus, come on.<eos> Ready?
They Want a background story on Jochem.<eos> Don't Worry.<eos> I'll Write something nice.<eos> What about the truth?<eos> Bullying Cause of Suicide<eos> Now you have to do it yourself.<eos> I'm torn apart by it.<eos> But he earned you 200 euro. Yes.<eos> I'll pay that back.<eos> To Whom?
But I can't dedicate myself to a show that fixates on the most superficial, unimportant aspect of being a human being.<eos> Aren't you dating Ryan now?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Then you should know.<eos> What makes "Body Talk" great isn't Ryan's great body.<eos> He also has an amazing spirit.<eos> I assumed that was what you liked about him.<eos> It is.<eos> The best thing to wash down a big slice of humble pie... East Chatswin tap water.<eos> Oh, thank goodness!
- Mission clock 13:46 and counting.<eos> What was that?<eos> Ten minutes is up, sir.<eos> Sir... we're cutting it awfully close.<eos> Give him another 30 seconds.<eos> I'm getting something on the uplink.<eos> It's a Jpeg.<eos> Put it up on monitor 3.<eos> Who is that?<eos> Cedeño?
I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, you lied.<eos> He lied.<eos> You lied.<eos> Give me a second.<eos> Lucy, Lucy, it's not what you think.<eos> Lucy, stop.<eos> I was protecting my son.<eos> Great, glad that's working for you.<eos> Me-- not so much.
We'll take 'em to the yard.<eos> Now we got four bodies to get rid of.<eos> Grab some duct tape, tarps and shovels.<eos> Federal agents. Drop your weapons!<eos> Deeks, on your 6:00!<eos> Callen, on your 6:00!<eos> Deeks?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Kensi?<eos> Kensi?
Yeah, you better.<eos> Well, I should go.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Bye.<eos> Well, thanks again, I really appreciate it.<eos> Sure.<eos> See you at practice.<eos> I'm dizzy.<eos> Emma, sit down.<eos> Why?
Bummer.<eos> I have a couple of pocket listings if this one doesn't work for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Whatever.<eos> No way you guys are getting a loan anyhow.<eos> Where are you?<eos> My mother's open house.<eos> Why?<eos> Because, Boo, my father finally set the wedding date with Faye Mendelson and my mother is taking it very very well.<eos> Oh, sorry.
I know.<eos> It's been so weird.<eos> - No ballet. - I can't remember the last time there's been no ballet.<eos> I'm actually looking forward to school.<eos> - Me too.<eos> - Even math... what's that craziness all about?<eos> Oh no! I just thought of something.<eos> We're going to have to take gym.<eos> - What?<eos> Why?
Charley?<eos> Amy?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Charley.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, that's disgusting.<eos> You know how many people have probably peed in that pool?<eos> Well, I guess this is goodbye.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened to your friend.<eos> Yeah. Me, too.
How are you gonna embarrass me this time?<eos> - It's not like that.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> What do you want from me, Mr Laszlo?<eos> I'm very busy.<eos> The body from the pier, I may be able to identify it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> If you'd let me see the body...<eos> - Why?
What do I want?<eos> I could have ratted you out to Hernandez a bunch of times. * I had the chance.<eos> Not while you're banging your CI.<eos> Making love. It's called making love.<eos> In what world is that making love?<eos> Mine.<eos> I need to borrow your car just for a couple of hours.<eos> No way, no fucking way.<eos> - You could help me, though.<eos> - Oh, yeah? Why?
I'll work it out.<eos> Soon as I do, I'll be smacking the red off of the Red Skull.<eos> - You mean "we."<eos> - I didn't say "we." I know that look.<eos> It comes right before "it's not you, it's me."<eos> Look, I activated the Avengers protocol because I thought you were gone, Cap.<eos> I didn't croak. {*corr} Wins all around, so back to the grind, right?<eos> Seriously?<eos> You rebooted the Avengers just to break us up again?<eos> - Unbelievable.
Look, I activated the Avengers protocol because I thought you were gone, Cap.<eos> I didn't croak. {*corr} Wins all around, so back to the grind, right?<eos> Seriously?<eos> You rebooted the Avengers just to break us up again?<eos> - Unbelievable.<eos> Mortals... fun but too complicated.<eos> After what we just survived?<eos> Looks that way.<eos> You missed this team, didn't you? Me?<eos> No.
It's hard, getting harder to make money, so I thought...buy a bank.<eos> - A bank?<eos> - A small private bank.<eos> Get everybody else to break their balls chasing the dollar.<eos> They deposit their proceeds with us, we launder it at a reasonable commission.<eos> I buy a vineyard, you get to be CEO.<eos> So...what went wrong?<eos> I've been creaming off our profits for some time.<eos> I didn't tell anyone.<eos> Not your bother, nobody.
Hernandez wanted me to meet him.<eos> Hernandez wanted you...?<eos> Some kind of favor to the Feds.<eos> So why'd you give it to me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Must have been busy or something?<eos> - Yeah, fucking some skank.<eos> - Still busy, ain't it?<eos> Anyway, it was you he needed to talk to.<eos> Why?
- Yeah, fucking some skank.<eos> - Still busy, ain't it?<eos> Anyway, it was you he needed to talk to.<eos> Why?<eos> - Fucked if I can remember.<eos> - Wilson!<eos> He was investigating some money-laundering scam involving shady Chinese dealers or something.<eos> He reached out to Hernandez for some intel<eos> - and she passed him to me.<eos> - Why?
Don't sell me, Mom!<eos> You still don't get it, do you?<eos> Baby brother wasn't sold because he ate drumsticks.<eos> Mom sold him to feed us.<eos> It wasn't my idea. It was your Dad's.<eos> I'm so sorry...<eos> Mrs. Lee!<eos> Mom...<eos> I can't feed a family of eight. I had to sell one to feed the others.<eos> Shame on me. Shame on me.
I said no. Thank you, Master.<eos> Don't be like that.<eos> She's not Mrs. Ip.<eos> Let's eat.<eos> Dig in, everyone.<eos> I have to go back to work, let's eat.<eos> Honey.<eos> Master!<eos> Can we take back the blanket we gave Mrs. Ip?<eos> Why?
- The what?<eos> Whatever you used to poison DA Chambers... where is it?<eos> I didn't use anything, I swear.<eos> I-I just broke his windshield.<eos> Yeah? Then why'd you take a swing at me?<eos> I panicked. I knew you'd think I killed him.<eos> - I didn't!<eos> - You killed him, and then you went after your wife when you found out she was cheating.<eos> Leslie's cheating...<eos> on me?
Or I swear... Don't posture.<eos> You're not gonna do it.<eos> You can't.<eos> I can see it in your eyes.<eos> - You're late.<eos> - You knew I was coming?<eos> Next time you plant a bug on someone, be more subtle about it.<eos> - I wish you'd trusted me though.<eos> - I trusted you.<eos> But them, never.
Previously on The Borgias: Now is the time of reckoning.<eos> The vultures are circling our family. Our Rome.<eos> We must remove him from the chair of St. Peter's and from this world.<eos> - Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord.<eos> -Vengeance will be ours.<eos> - No!<eos> -Catherina Sforza.<eos> If she does not kiss the papal ring we will drag her in chains through the streets of Rome.<eos> You would have me kneel to him?<eos> Bow?
Hannah, we've been over for months.<eos> I have to focus on my family now.<eos> An associate copy editor.<eos> I was hoping for something a little higher on the food chain.<eos> I'm sorry if you're unhappy.<eos> So you're shipping me off to Siberia.<eos> Chicago.<eos> Let's not get hysterical.<eos> I put in time with the company.<eos> With you.
All you need is an account to access it.<eos> Um, thanks, uh...<eos> Maria.<eos> I mean, Gholandria the Wicked.<eos> You sent Sam a phantom text from his ex?<eos> Dick move, sir.<eos> Yeah, not my finest hour.<eos> So he found some normalcy with this chick, and now it's gone...<eos> again.<eos> Thanks to you.
I'm prepared to file a motion to court to keep the embryos frozen indefinitely,<eos> - or to have them destroyed.<eos> - You can't do that!<eos> You just watch me.<eos> Dr Sukaly, I want to let you know that I got my donor's signature giving up his paternal rights.<eos> Adrianna was was so worried this morning when she saw Vanessa, she told me everything.<eos> Stop pretending you don't know she's back.<eos> You were on your way to meet her.<eos> I can't let you do that.<eos> Annie?
You are under a lot of pressure.<eos> Absolutely. I...<eos> I get it.<eos> And I can't have Ade's raggedy ass around me right now.<eos> - Not with the album about to drop.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hey, you just... used to care about her, man.<eos> Okay.<eos> Whose friend do you want to be? Huh?<eos> Hers?
Oh, come on.<eos> You know you want me.<eos> This guy bothering you?<eos> You know, he really can't be trusted around pretty girls.<eos> Anyway, you two are cordially invited to a club opening tonight.<eos> Is this your bar?<eos> No, I... I'm in college.<eos> What would I be doing owning a bar?<eos> Liam's stepfather is a very prominent plastic surgeon.<eos> Stepfather?
- No.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - No, Nolan.<eos> Nolan! No. No!<eos> Nolan. Nolan, get up. Nolan.<eos> Get up, Nolan. Nolan, come on.<eos> [Groans] We have a rule, Nolan.<eos> [Cries] Get up.<eos> I love you.<eos> Sukar?
No, old people are always sticking their wrinkly hands in there.<eos> It's gross. Listen.<eos> I was just with your mother and I realized that an engagement ring is more than just metal and a stone.<eos> I know what I said before, but if you got me one, I wouldn't complain.<eos> Ow! What the hell?<eos> Congratulations!<eos> I'm sorry, I'm gonna need that ring back.<eos> Where's Sabrina?<eos> I can't give her this ring, Frank.<eos> Why n...
You guys here about the job? How'd you guess?<eos> We get our share of drifters.<eos> Ah. Ever worked a farm before? Definitely.<eos> We're quick learners.<eos> Ellie...who we got here?<eos> I'm Dean. This is Sam.<eos> Oh. Carl Granville.<eos> A pleasure. Pleasure. So you're not a Cassity?<eos> Her and her family own the place. I'm just one those, uh -- what you call 'em?<eos> -- trophy husbands.
Oh, I'm working on a plan right now.<eos> This is a disaster.<eos> Our stock is hemorrhaging.<eos> Lyritrol is dead.<eos> I'm getting cash to the stock promoter.<eos> His people will make sure the stock doesn't drop past 30.<eos> How is that legal?<eos> Good question, because we have so many options.<eos> I'm sure the board and wall street will happily forgive us for being asleep at the wheel.<eos> Us?
I know, but... you're my brother.<eos> Okay.<eos> But then why are we so hard on each other?<eos> Because since mom died, we've been three sad, angry little men with no one to show us how to be kind.<eos> You ever think about what life would be like if she hadn't died?<eos> All the time.<eos> Maybe the next drug you develop should be a cure for ALS.<eos> That's a great idea, except for the fact you blew my career up.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Me too.
You have to get something from my place.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's in a small silver tin in my desk.<eos> What's that all about?<eos> - About the house.<eos> Which house?<eos> - Our house in Morocco.<eos> What about it?<eos> - They want to sell it.<eos> Why?
Asshole.<eos> Hakan wants you to have this.<eos> - Thank him from me, but I don't want it.<eos> Take it, he made good money tonight.<eos> Stop by at coffee house Mavi KÃ¶sk.<eos> - Alright, I will when I have a chance.<eos> Two whiskey and colas, please.<eos> Wait here, okay?<eos> Come with me.<eos> - Why?
That makes me very happy.<eos> - Yes, me too.<eos> I think a permanent contract is a real possibility.<eos> Majid, this is John Terpijn.<eos> Do you know that name?<eos> John is the organizer of Max Promo.<eos> This is the kid I told you about.<eos> Majid Zamari.<eos> I saw you fight two weeks ago.<eos> Against that German.
And it's here.<eos> SHE MOANS<eos> That's it, this one isn't wasting any time.<eos> BABY CRIES A little boy.<eos> Oh, Lord, you are having a very, very busy day.<eos> He's beautiful.<eos> Can you take him straight to Dad?<eos> A boy.<eos> He's still breathing.<eos> Oh, thank goodness.
Well, that's exceptionally generous.<eos> And obviously with two beneficiaries, we need to look at ways to raise more money than usual.<eos> We thought perhaps the sisters could have a handicrafts stall and organise a baby show.<eos> A baby show?<eos> Oh, it's the latest thing.<eos> Well, they had one at St Mungo's, and the takings on the gate went through the roof!<eos> They didn't even have a famous judge, which is where I thought we ought to push the boat out.<eos> I don't think we could attract a famous judge.<eos> Nonsense. No-one can resist a wimple.<eos> Or a... or a pretty nurse.
We're counting down the top ten healthy snacks to have after school.<eos> [Man] Frosty.<eos> What's up, man?<eos> How's the family?<eos> We're taking over the station and make it what it once was.<eos> Benefits and everything are pretty much gonna be the same.<eos> You're going to love this.<eos> It's gonna bring back a lot of memories.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Ready?
What are you doing?<eos> Leukaemia.<eos> Last thought I remember thinking was just that it was so... unfair.<eos> I'd been benched before I'd even got to play the game.<eos> – What was your last thought?<eos> – I don't know.<eos> I just remember feeling... relief.<eos> Relief?<eos> Kieren Walker?<eos> Why?
We need to move these.<eos> You didn't need to send in the cavalry.<eos> I would've figured out another way.<eos> And risk everything we've worked for?<eos> I told you your husband would not stop seeking answers.<eos> It wasn't him.<eos> It was the kids and her.<eos> She knows about Flight 71.<eos> Then you know what you must do.<eos> Unbelievable.
- How would they know each other?<eos> Did Officer Banks say that?<eos> Unfortunately we haven't been able to locate Officer Banks.<eos> We found the wife and the radiator where you said he was handcuffed but by the time we reached the crime scene he was gone.<eos> Any thoughts, any ideas where he might be?<eos> No, I-<eos> - No, I don't know where Officer Banks could be.<eos> Think there's a chance he might show up here?<eos> Here?<eos> Why?
Let me see those hands.<eos> Come on, everyone.<eos> You guys sing!<eos> Am I better when I'm naked?<eos> I Iike being free.<eos> I recorded "What Makes You beautiful" in my boxers.<eos> Who gets to go on the O2 stage in their dressing gown?<eos> Not many so 'm gonna live that dream boys.<eos> And 'm gonna go out there and rock me little socks off.<eos> Thanks, everyone!
If I had been more open with you about the suicide note, you wouldn't be questioning it now.<eos> All I want to know is the truth.<eos> Megan Hunt.<eos> What do you got?<eos> I got a female victim, mid-20s.<eos> Cleaning lady found her an hour ago. It's a mess inside.<eos> Clear struggle.<eos> The attack was brutal.<eos> You haven't heard from Tommy, have you?<eos> No, why?
The facts are not on Tommy's side.<eos> The fact is, he saved both our lives.<eos> You have to help him.<eos> I know I owe it to him...<eos> You owe it to yourself.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Take a guess.<eos> Adam.<eos> The fight with the bouncer in the nightclub... I need you to meet me there now.<eos> Why?
Oh, we can't afford those on a government budget.<eos> You can take a seat, though, if you like.<eos> Great, I get to tell my shooting story for the hundredth time.<eos> No, you don't have to do that. This is a trauma debriefing. It's not a psych evaluation.<eos> Everything you say here is confidential and off the record.<eos> I'm not taking notes, I'm not reporting back to the department.<eos> Right, so why is it mandatory then?<eos> It's a preventative service.<eos> Preventing what?<eos> Post-traumatic stress disorder.
- Uh, at ease, soldier.<eos> Still making no headway with Bobby?<eos> Nothing. I'm two weeks under with him, and all he wants to do is get under me.<eos> Ugh. Wait, is that what the birth control pills are for?<eos> I'm not taking them.<eos> Well, your agency doesn't expect you to, um...<eos> I'm not gonna screw him.<eos> The pills are for Bobby. You give a guy a couple of these, and his soldier's at ease.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.
Well, it turns out I was.<eos> The doctors told me I was schizophrenic.<eos> They told me that the voices weren't real, that none of you... were real.<eos> Your doctors were wrong.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But look, you said it started six months ago, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know how, but somehow I think you were hearing my friends while we were stuck in this, um, place.<eos> The barn?
Not even a little.<eos> Damn, I hope he doesn't try something.<eos> The last time I tried to call the cops, it took them, like, 45 minutes to get here.<eos> Looks like you'll have to handle it on your own.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Oh, my God, he wants me to go over there.<eos> - Can I get some quarters?<eos> - Really?<eos> For the jukebox.<eos> Unbelievable.
But that was years ago. Well, you raised some very valid questions back then, on how to splice species, and how to reverse it.<eos> Well, it wasn't as breakthrough as I thought.<eos> It was a dead end.<eos> See, I don't think it was. In fact, I'll go on further and say that I have evidence that a cross-species creature exists.<eos> All right, I'm on the edge of something groundbreaking. But this isn't exactly my area of expertise.<eos> I could do with the help of a biochemist... and I was hoping that it'd be the man who published a paper on it.<eos> You really want out of that morgue.<eos> I just don't want someone that I care about to end up in it.<eos> You... think this thing's a threat to her?<eos> Or... him?
Now you're welcome to stay as long as you like.<eos> We got food, fresh clothing, hot water.<eos> Normally we'd provide you with weapons and a car for your journey, but we need all we have.<eos> Looks like you're battening down the hatches.<eos> Were you guys attacked?<eos> Yeah, but not by biters. Some dangerous people out there. They came at us a few days ago.<eos> Anyone hurt?<eos> There were several fatalities.<eos> - Ben:<eos> Damn.
I'm good.<eos> You don't have to be.<eos> There you go.<eos> Right. Welcome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Gotta move quick.<eos> He's pinned in with them.<eos> I got the far ones.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks.
I thought it was done. You didn't ask him already?<eos> Ask me what?<eos> When I got the place, there was that frame and some parts and equipment.<eos> Whoever lived here built them.<eos> It's a lot of parts for one bike.<eos> Whenever I came across any parts out there, I brought them back.<eos> I didn't know what I'd need.<eos> I always thought I'd learn how to do it, but I get the feeling you already know what to do with it.<eos> And the thing is, you're going to need a bike.<eos> Why?
This place must have been no fun at all.<eos> We need your help.<eos> Do you even know why you do the things you do?<eos> The choices you make?<eos> If we give the Governor Michonne,<eos> Woodbury stands down.<eos> I don't like it, but it's what needs to be done.<eos> We need to make it quiet. We need your help with that.<eos> You ain't told any of the others, huh?<eos> Just Hershel, Daryl and you.
Thanks, uh, for meeting me.<eos> I just, uh, wasn't sure I could go out and eat alone tonight.<eos> Eh, that's what pals are for.<eos> Probably would have grabbed some takeout myself.<eos> - That's a beautiful shirt.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hey, hold up a sec, will you?<eos> I like to get that stuff out of the way right up front.<eos> Or... maybe you're not ready to let things go with your wife.<eos> Ex-wife.
Yeah, so he's unlike me then.<eos> He's a shrink.<eos> Are you trying to hurt me?<eos> Hey, Gavin.<eos> Uh, you got a sec?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's up?<eos> Uh, this morning, um, Maggie was helping me do a-a harvest on that bone donor.<eos> - You know? - Yeah.<eos> Uh, why?
You know?<eos> Lilly, I want to help you.<eos> But without your medical files, my hands are tied.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I'm trusting you.<eos> I know.<eos> Dr. Reid.<eos> Good news.<eos> Really?<eos> Thanks to you.
Lilly, I want to help you.<eos> But without your medical files, my hands are tied.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I'm trusting you.<eos> I know.<eos> Dr. Reid.<eos> Good news.<eos> Really?<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> Me?
You got to help me find her.<eos> [ sighs ] I really need you to help me find her.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> What if the woman that you loved was lying in a ditch somewhere, you know, because of something you did?<eos> Hey.<eos> Charlie, w-what are you doing out here?<eos> Um, our MVC patient from this morning,<eos> - did anyone else come in with her?<eos> - Just the medics. Any other MVC trauma come in, like a woman named Jackie, perhaps?<eos> No. Why?
I can't even begin to understand what you're going through.<eos> But the option is there if you want it.<eos> I appreciate it, Kate.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's get back to work.<eos> We're just a few blocks from the health food place.<eos> Let's see if anybody around there recognizes the face from the picture Leaf just gave us.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Look, do you know the guy or not?<eos> Sorry, man.
My mother has told me, that it is difficult, to keep a pussy really clean.<eos> A pussy gets sick a lot easier than a penis.<eos> That is why hygiene in the bathroom has the top priority.<eos> Helen, are you ready?<eos> If everything is fresh again?<eos> Almost.<eos> Come on<eos> Jump.<eos> Trust no one.<eos> Not even your parents.
I don' t care too much about order.<eos> I know.<eos> - So, there you go.<eos> - Robin, I'm afraid.<eos> Yes, I'm scared too.<eos> I'm scared for you.<eos> We need to start now, because you lost a lot of blood.<eos> You may think that you're still aware of everything, but this is in reality only a fraction of of what is going on.<eos> Here we have all had a bit of bad luck.<eos> Especially you.
Were you aware she was an undercover officer?<eos> No, I was not.<eos> When did you become aware she was undercover?<eos> A few hours ago, on the news.<eos> At no point did you suspect Jackie Hays might have been law enforcement?<eos> No.<eos> I've met undercover cops in the docks before.<eos> You can smell them a mile away.<eos> Jackie was unlike any undercover cop I've met before.<eos> Why?
Can I give you a hug?<eos> Uh, I just wanted you to know how sorry I am.<eos> I'm kind of sick about the whole thing.<eos> I was trying to think of the last time I talked to Roman before this and... I think I was a bitch to him.<eos> I'm sure that's not true.<eos> Uh, anyway I made him this.<eos> If you wouldn't mind bringing it to him...<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I really...
- Why didn't you? - My horse stopped.<eos> He sensed your spirit.<eos> When I got close, I felt your breath. I knew he was right.<eos> Smart horse.<eos> Smarter than me.<eos> Here was a woman who had faced death... and wasn't afraid.<eos> That's why I brought you here.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> The debt is paid.<eos> Fire!
I was in my cups.<eos> I... I've been known to wax metaphoric.<eos> Who is this?<eos> That's a long story.<eos> Tell it to me.<eos> Well... when Jake and Troy were young boys, the local Indian tribe decided that the ranch belonged to them.<eos> Sacred land or some sort of bullshit.<eos> Wasn't bullshit to them, huh?<eos> They sold the land to my family, got a square deal, but none of that stopped them young bucks from making trouble.<eos> Young bucks.

I know it's hard to understand.<eos> It's impossible to understand!<eos> You're just like them.<eos> You're worse!<eos> - You're heartless!<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - You don't have feelings! - Alicia...<eos> No wonder Dad was so depressed!<eos> He was living with a goddamn corpse!<eos> Enough!
Haven't had champagne in a long time."<eos> Chekhov.<eos> Oh. His final words.<eos> "Either this wallpaper goes, or I do."<eos> - Wilde. - Yes!<eos> "Born in a hotel room and God damn it... died in a hotel room."<eos> O'Neill!<eos> Yes.<eos> "Last words are for fools who have not said enough."<eos> Marx.
Anyone who endangers the group is thrown out!<eos> Fuck all of you!<eos> I want to be someone you can believe in.<eos> I'm gonna do rapid detox.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Do you know what a trial by ordeal is?<eos> We walk into the mist.<eos> Whoever dies, we will provide an answer for the people here.<eos> They will know who to follow.<eos> Help!
You never loved me.<eos> That is true.<eos> And if I can love, I guess that means there's something wrong with you, not me.<eos> A dad is supposed to love his son!<eos> A man is supposed to love women.<eos> I guess we're both messed up.<eos> At least we don't have to lie to each other anymore.<eos> The time has come to leave.<eos> I know now what it wants me to do.<eos> What?
He just went to get water.<eos> It's been like a halfhour.<eos> He's probably just using the bathroom or something.<eos> I think I'm gonna go walk around for a sec, see if I can find him.<eos> Why don't you wait for your mom?<eos> It's okay. I'll be back.<eos> Alex, what are you doing here?<eos> I'm looking for Jay.<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> No, not since last night.
Thank you.<eos> May She bless you.<eos> Where are they?<eos> They want to stay.<eos> They're ashamed.<eos> It really is a beautiful place.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Yes.<eos> Every act of destruction is an act of creation.<eos> Help!

The first was to destroy as many refineries in poland...<eos> Look at me! No, no, no!<eos> Please don't!<eos> I'm hosting a party at my country home.<eos> I would be very pleased if you could come as well.<eos> I wouldn't miss it.<eos> Operation marigold isn't about a refinery.<eos> It's about him. Professor harald voigt.<eos> He is working on a formula to increase the production.<eos> Of synthetic oil.
The soldiers then come in to clean out the rest.<eos> We need a battle plan.<eos> The nazis are cleaning out a village tomorrow.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Government health check today.<eos> Come inside, children!<eos> Time to come inside.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Meet me here after, okay?<eos> And no dawdling.

The rest learned fast.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Ammunition.<eos> Could've done with this in france.<eos> I don't think they work with stick guns. This war won't be won on the battlefield.<eos> It'll be won in the streets.<eos> And there's no point waiting for the russians.<eos> The only thing they're ever on time for.<eos> Is a free drink.<eos> A german or a russian?
Obergruppenfuhrer schmidt told me. That all the single men are asked. To bring a female companion.<eos> Purely platonic, of course.<eos> Someone who embodies the highest feminine values of the reich.<eos> What an opportunity for you.<eos> Well, it's not official yet.<eos> But I've already picked out a dress.<eos> Heidi!<eos> Hello!<eos> Berta.<eos> Derica.
Out! Get out!<eos> No!<eos> Out!<eos> Please don't hurt her! Don't hurt her!<eos> Rd?<eos> Rd means they're. To be sent away to do farm work for the incoming settlers.<eos> Kowalski.<eos> Mark that one kl.<eos> That's concentration camp.<eos> Edsel!
I work with brigadefuhrer faber.<eos> Whoa! You've come a long way from klv camp.<eos> How about you?<eos> We're hoping.<eos> To get into the ss.<eos> Boys. When you evict them, Make sure they leave their belongings behind.<eos> We don't want the settlers arriving to empty homes.<eos> Yes, herr polizeifuhrer.<eos> Move! Come on!<eos> Help!

Why, mein Master, have you taken his form?<eos> A necessary ruse.
Thanks to the cooperation that is at the heart of the Partnership, everyone's needs are being met, jobs are plentiful, shelter is guaranteed, and sustenance is provided.<eos> And at our Freedom Centers, teams of caring and committed medical professionals are ready and eager to serve you.<eos> Just keep your blood donations up to date and comprehensive health care will be yours at absolutely no cost.<eos> Thanks to the effects of nuclear winter, which filters out harmful UV rays, our strigoi counterparts no longer have to confine themselves to the darkness.<eos> - Thank you. - This new equilibrium means that we are now able to join hands and work together to create a new and more<eos> - just society for us all.<eos> - I know it's gonna be difficult to say goodbye to my family, but being B-positive, I know that I'm making a vital contribution to The Partnership to ensure that everyone can live healthy, productive lives.<eos> So the sacrifice is more than worth it.<eos> We have leadership and order and the promise of a great future.<eos> The Partnership, toward a better future for us all.
You have pretty eyes.<eos> I know what you're thinking, pal.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> You're gonna take us back to your camp.<eos> And then we're gonna kill you and take your woman, and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.<eos> You got one thing right, when you were just talking there... Yeah?<eos> She does have really pretty eyes. Yeah.<eos> What the hell is that thing? !<eos> Think of me as a demon.<eos> From the Good Book.
- No.<eos> - And what about your diet?<eos> Same as everyone, I guess.<eos> Oh, except for those Partnership Freedom Bars.<eos> I can't get them down.<eos> I don't know. I just... The taste, I don't like it.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> You have scorbutus, also known as scurvy.<eos> Your dietary intake of vitamin C is too low.<eos> Vitamin C?
I'm more of a big picture guy.<eos> Look at this picture.<eos> This picture's huge.<eos> You know, I am no stranger to adversity.<eos> My dad owned a flower shop, and when it was struggling, I...<eos> I'm dying to hear the end of that story, but... Ooh, look, it's... my assistant's, uh, motioning to me.<eos> What is it?<eos> Jackie, did you need something? - No.<eos> - What do you want from me?<eos> Nothing.
You are the worst.<eos> Uh, you said there's a phone call for me?<eos> Bruce Wayne is on the phone for you.<eos> Bruce Wayne?<eos> My cuz-bro.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Come on.<eos> Time to meet your team.<eos> I can't believe I'm actually working for Bruce Wayne.<eos> Dot dot dot's cousin.
It's a bus pass.<eos> It's a much safer alternative to the train.<eos> A little Charm City insider tip.<eos> You guys, thank you.<eos> I didn't chip in.<eos> I would not expect that.<eos> To the RD team.<eos> - To Emily.<eos> - To Emily.<eos> This just in:
You guys, thank you.<eos> I didn't chip in.<eos> I would not expect that.<eos> To the RD team.<eos> - To Emily.<eos> - To Emily.<eos> This just in:<eos> Gotham City police report the Joker has been apprehended.<eos> Batman used a new device that tracked him by his smell.<eos> And now for a correction...
- Of course.<eos> If you think it would help.<eos> It could.<eos> There is no way a person could hide in this thing.<eos> Well, so much for being rolled out.<eos> Does this train go back to Entrevaux, after?<eos> No, Monsieur, this is the last train on this line.<eos> So where does it go after Menton?<eos> Menton.<eos> Into a garage till morning.
- Oui.<eos> Yes.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Oh, show me those cute little booties of yours.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah, beautiful.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, call the number on the sheet and if you get through the first round, you get 1000 euros for a screen test.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good bye.
- So could you. - Uh-ha.<eos> So our no-gun policy that's still non negotiable?<eos> Listen, I'll defend myself if I have to.<eos> You should wait here.<eos> I need you to stay sharp and alive.<eos> Eric Beaumont.<eos> Monte tes mains; plus haut.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Well, I am not going anywhere, but I'm handing you over to some people.<eos> What people?
Listen, it's always this way.<eos> Engineers make the impossible possible.<eos> Lawyers try to stop them with paperwork.<eos> If I was afraid of lawyers, I wouldn't have a $120 billion company.<eos> Is that an APB call?<eos> Yeah, but I'm not on shift, so I don't...<eos> No.<eos> My god.<eos> I'm sorry. I have to go.<eos> Murph. Murph! Hey!
We can't arrest someone based on math. Why not?<eos> Statistically speaking, eyewitness testimony is less than 60% reliable most of the time and people get arrested based on that.<eos> My numbers are way better.<eos> Did you know that 75.6% of statistics are made up on the spot.<eos> Only 23% of people are actually aware of that.<eos> It's not police business if someone's likely to do something.<eos> Okay, fine. Forget I said anything.<eos> You want to go down for this alone? Who said anyone's going down?<eos> You and your friends ran from the cops.<eos> From the scene of a murder.
Please.<eos> Gideon, as your chief counsel, I need to remind you you're talking about a $5 million piece of equipment.<eos> Yes, I'm aware of that. Thank you, my friend.<eos> If you recall, I'm the guy that wrote the $5 million check.<eos> Come to think of it, I should have charged it for the miles.<eos> This is a chair designed for a shuttle cockpit.<eos> How does putting it in a police station make it... See these?<eos> These are biometric feedback sensors.<eos> They take ECG, EEG, and EDA readings to measure stress levels.<eos> In pilots, not criminals!
I had stuff to take care of.<eos> What... what happened to...<eos> It's not police business. Don't worry about it.<eos> Hey, so apparently there's an armored vehicle heist about to happen in the next five to ten minutes.<eos> You want to focus on that, or on my busted lip?<eos> See what you can do with these.<eos> They're cell phone triggers for the bomb they're using to blow the armored truck.<eos> And when they turn those on, we need to triangulate a position as quickly as possible.<eos> I am on it.<eos> Murph.
This is a copy of Reggie's work I.D.<eos> It's the only photo we have.<eos> He mostly kept to himself.<eos> We were really surprised he didn't come in today.<eos> I don't think he's ever missed a day of work.<eos> Well, we think he might have fled.<eos> Do you know where he might be?<eos> Not really.<eos> I think he's from Texas.<eos> Somewhere down south.
Listen, it's no secret that we've had our bumps, but at this point, I'm just glad to have a partner at City Hall.<eos> Does this mean that those rumors of legal issues at the 13th are untrue?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> No, no, no, we're-we're satisfied that the 13th district is on firm legal ground in this case.<eos> And we also appreciate that fact that they have followed our lead in fighting the scourge of drugs in this city.<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> You won.<eos> I wasn't trying to win, Scott.<eos> I was just doing my job.<eos> For him?

But we did. 1978.<eos> It was me, her, and her husband.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> You need to pee? Pee.<eos> - Don't bring shit up like that, man.<eos> - What?<eos> History is a beautiful thing.<eos> I haven't talked to you since the...<eos> You know, the...<eos> The whole...

Rooftop secure.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> You okay, man?<eos> Yeah, just a flesh wound.<eos> Thirty-five flesh wounds.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _
Punish me.<eos> Punish me hard.<eos> Ah! I'll rub it until it's shiny!<eos> I'll rub it until it's shiny!<eos> - What?<eos> - I didn't say anything.<eos> That's right, you didn't.<eos> So you know, you just stared blankly at me for, like, 20 seconds.<eos> Shut up.<eos> And no noodles.
I may have visited her establishment once or twice for an investigative piece.<eos> Do you remember where you were the night of her murder?<eos> Same place I am every time you've accused me of murder.<eos> On the air.<eos> Were you aware she recorded her sessions?<eos> Am I wrong to find that unethical?<eos> The people of Seattle rely on me as a symbol of wisdom and integrity.<eos> This stuff didn't matter when I was doing the weather, but now I am their anchor, man.<eos> You have to find those tapes.<eos> For the good of our fair city.
Tell your grandma Imma swing by to roll her a few spliffs.<eos> Rheumatoid arthritis ain't gonna stop no sweet lady from getting her swerve on.<eos> How much will a U-boat set me back?<eos> Twenty will get you a ticket to ride, my friend.<eos> - Can I hook you up?<eos> - Nah. Just professional curiosity.<eos> - Your stuff any good?<eos> - Negatory. Quality Utopium is a relic of a bygone era.<eos> Mr. Boss took out the crew slinging Lucky U.<eos> Not all of them.
- You can't stroll faster.<eos> It's no longer strolling, it's striding.<eos> - People.<eos> - Smile.<eos> Zucchini.<eos> Fiddlesticks.<eos> Mollycoddle.<eos> What are you doing? I'm hoping one of these is my safe word.<eos> Less talking, more smiling.<eos> No teeth.
And give me a new name.<eos> One that's less silly.<eos> Gern Blanston.<eos> Why not.<eos> Tell me about the first time we kissed.<eos> That's one memory I don't want to lose.<eos> It was more of a heavy make-out session actually.<eos> You'd come over to "study."<eos> Remember what you were wearing? I don't.<eos> Pajamas.
Bad news, people.<eos> Bar's closed.<eos> Come on.<eos> Heads down!<eos> _<eos> Get down!<eos> _<eos> _<eos> How fast can this thing go?<eos> Inside.
I need to contact my team.<eos> But you just gave up your phone.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> What do they want?<eos> Commander Corman?<eos> This is Zara Hallam, investigator, and Oliver Yates, psychological profiler.<eos> Beaumont's team.<eos> Glad you're here.<eos> Have you had any contact with the hostage takers?<eos> None.
Get up!<eos> What are they doing?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna see what I can find out.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I'm not thirsty.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> What happened in there?<eos> They searched me, emptied my pockets. Took a photograph.<eos> Photograph?<eos> Close-up of my face...
Let's move!<eos> Lucas.<eos> Clever man.<eos> That phone call... you ratted us out.<eos> You can't expect to lock down 100 people without someone getting the word out.<eos> What's important now is that the police know, and you have to deal with that.<eos> I can tell you what to say.<eos> What are you gonna do if the police storm the island?<eos> Start executing old people.<eos> Old people.
Okay, intonation rise and fall was clear enough.<eos> Keywords... "breaking in, spread terror."<eos> "Wind up killing""<eos> "Spread."<eos> This conference is about infectious diseases.<eos> Infections spread.<eos> He's saying they're gonna use a disease as a weapon.<eos> Okay, what about "breaking in"?<eos> Uh, something stolen from the NEC?<eos> From the lab?
Cameron used his mother's access to get them credentialed into the conference.<eos> So they could have a mole on the inside.<eos> Eric will figure this out.<eos> More than likely.<eos> He'll use it.<eos> I'm gonna tell Commander Corman.<eos> Oliver.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sit.<eos> No blinking.
Now there's a welcome sight, my wife and my boy.<eos> Ooh. I think we might be feeding him too much.<eos> Don't forget your daughter, she is here too.<eos> - It went well?<eos> - It did, not a scratch.<eos> You have a visitor.<eos> He has been here all night.<eos> Aethelwold.<eos> How much of my ale have you drunk?<eos> Not a cup.
Refreshment.<eos> Thank you, Gisela.<eos> I... - I trust you are well.<eos> - I am, Lord. And better for your visit.<eos> The ale is freshly brewed.<eos> Excellent.<eos> - You are content in Wessex, I hope?<eos> - I am, Lord.<eos> I am well, my family are well and there's peace, this is all I ask.<eos> And what of you?
I pray my own wife might say the same.<eos> I imagine she does Odda, as she so rarely sees you.<eos> Lord King.<eos> Lord Odda. Steapa, my friend.<eos> Uhtred, you do not deserve such a charming wife.<eos> I can only agree, Lord.<eos> I was not expecting you, there has been no message.<eos> I am hearing you've hanged a man?<eos> I hanged many men just lately.<eos> Raiders, Danes.
- You deal in sorcery now?<eos> - It is my fate, or so I'm told.<eos> You have my word that I will make my appointment in Mercia and then I shall return to Frankia.<eos> Sigefrid is in Frankia?<eos> He is, but not for much longer, my brother is... restless.<eos> We have grown strong in the years since Northumbria.<eos> We have a fleet now, 19 ships.<eos> Which you will sail to where?<eos> We have no firm plan, other than to listen to Bjorn.<eos> The dead man.
Lundene is how far up river?<eos> Half a day, with the tide.<eos> We take it at the earliest.<eos> And Uhtred.<eos> As we planned.<eos> Are you looking forward to the wedding, Father?<eos> I am. I am, Father Beocca.<eos> I enjoy a wedding as much as the next drunkard.<eos> How is your own lady, Father, the Dane?<eos> Thyra?
She is a pleasant woman.<eos> There is no finer sight than that of a naked woman, arms outstretched.<eos> Almost there. Lord?<eos> - Lord?<eos> - Beocca, come in.<eos> - Father Pyrlig.<eos> - Good day, Lord. I read of nothing but skirmishes and raids.<eos> What kind of a place must Daneland be?<eos> - Sinful, Lord.<eos> - Without question.
- Upon completion of a task.<eos> You will fetch Clapa, you will go to the stables and wait for me.<eos> Ensure the horses are watered and fed, but ready.<eos> - Yes, Lord.<eos> - Go.<eos> Thank you, Lord.<eos> We will name our first son Uhtred, Lord.<eos> - No, you will not!<eos> - No, I will not.<eos> Thyra.
It was selfish of me to ask, to even mention the word... but...<eos> I fear you have become someone I cannot live without.<eos> You fear?<eos> Life without you...<eos> Fear no more.<eos> I am here... always.<eos> - Supper?<eos> - Praise Him.<eos> This is it.<eos> Skald's Hall.
You are expected and welcome.<eos> Go and take a piss.<eos> Who is he?<eos> A thief, Lord.<eos> I serve Erik... Sigefrid's brother.<eos> He sends you good wishes.<eos> Erik is not here?<eos> He is not. And if I had my way, I would not be here.<eos> My men... are afraid.<eos> Of ghosts?
I do not like him and he doesn't like me.<eos> From the moment that we met.<eos> You are a threat, lord.<eos> And he is the same.<eos> Our hope lies in Daneland.<eos> With luck, the unrest will grow.<eos> Peace is not in their nature.<eos> You wish for war, Aldhelm?<eos> As a Mercian, lord, what I wish is for Aethelred to be crowned King of Mercia.<eos> And then, of Wessex.
Yes.<eos> So, I get to kill him after all.<eos> If we wish, there is a way to raise the greatest army these shores have ever seen.<eos> It can be done.<eos> The Temes River would be dark with ships, Danes and Northmen.<eos> All we need to be is clever... and patient.<eos> Patient?<eos> Oh, there will still be blood to spill, Brother.<eos> But this way, we can be Kings of it all.<eos> No Guthrun.
It is Sigefrid's game.<eos> I do not understand how it kills a man...<eos> Slowly, lord.<eos> It's a cruel death.<eos> That's what the priest there said.<eos> The priest is right.<eos> The priest looks like a pale bag of bones and dough.<eos> You should let him fight.<eos> The Romans used this square forjust that purpose.<eos> Combat.
The more men that we have, the greater the chance of success.<eos> Regardless of how many die?<eos> It'll be men climbing ladders, it can only succeed with numbers and with death.<eos> I will not lose men for the sake of too little thought.<eos> There must be a clear plan.<eos> Then let us hear this clear plan.<eos> We attack one gate with a substantial army, allowing smaller groups to enter through a second gate, a third gate, even.<eos> Attacking from land?<eos> Yes, from land.<eos> Not the river?
You all know what needs to be done!<eos> We cannot fail!<eos> Go!<eos> We cannot fail!<eos> It's open.<eos> Do you see a guard? None.<eos> I see a trap.<eos> Yes, of course, if it is a trap, we should walk towards it.<eos> Hey! Shush your mouth.<eos> Hey!

Fire! I see fire up there!<eos> Stand ready!<eos> It's a signal!<eos> It's a signal, no doubt, lord.<eos> They will come.<eos> It's a signal that can be seen from a mile or more.<eos> Aethelred! Aethelred!<eos> Move! Move!<eos> Aethelred! The camp!<eos> Thyra...!
Peter doesn't look so good.<eos> He's been through worse, we'll get through this, too.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Copy that, Bellamy.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Bellamy, go to the private channel.<eos> No more lectures.<eos> Bellamy, stop.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> No unnecessary risks.
Hey, hey, hey, slow down, slow down.<eos> Emori, look at me.<eos> Look at me. Breathe.<eos> Tell me everything.<eos> Murphy?<eos> Murphy, is that you?<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Look, we need to talk.<eos> Quiet.
No! No!<eos> You did more damage than you took.<eos> Not enough.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Don't tell me you've never killed for revenge.<eos> Well, then, I guess you're better than me, because I'm going to.<eos> But first I'm gonna make him suffer for what he did to me and my brother.<eos> I'm gonna cut him for every time he cut me.<eos> I'm gonna make him beg the way I begged.<eos> Emori.
You can't save someone who doesn't want to be saved.<eos> Your mother would be proud of the man you've become.<eos> I know I am.<eos> You floated my mother.<eos> Who you want to be doesn't always win.<eos> Storm's over.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You have somewhere to go now?<eos> I'm going home.<eos> Back to my stupid sheep.
I don't have time for this.<eos> I want to help.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> We need to work together.<eos> I barely know you.<eos> I think your father was murdered.<eos> I need to find out why.<eos> Murdered?<eos> I just need to get into the safe room.<eos> Unbelievable!
How much is he in for?<eos> $ 420,000 You sure about that?<eos> We could call his mother.<eos> No.<eos> Let him go for broke.<eos> You're good at this, you know.<eos> You should have kids.<eos> Can you stay with me until I fall asleep?<eos> Sure.<eos> Sweet dreams.
There's also this: bank statements.<eos> I never knew about those bank accounts.<eos> There must be thousands of transactions here.<eos> All for tiny amounts from the Cayman Islands, Lichtenstein, the Bahamas...<eos> There's a pattern here...<eos> Look, the payments build up over months until the total reaches several million and then, the entire amount is transferred out of the bank.<eos> See, balance drops to zero.<eos> A few months later, an even larger amount is transferred back in<eos> And these transactions go to and from...<eos> John Brandeis?
Well, there's one man you could ask:<eos> John Brandeis.<eos> This is a surprise.<eos> I'm here to see Ada.<eos> Do I need an appointment?<eos> Of course not!<eos> Where is she?<eos> Playing with the gardener and that awful girl who's always following her around.<eos> Would you like a drink?<eos> A juice?
I've come to ask you a favor.<eos> Why even bother hosting a gala?<eos> Tradition.<eos> They always used to have it here.<eos> Constantine and I would host it together.<eos> The children would be allowed to stay for an hour and then, they'd be taken up to bed.<eos> You's always see them, like little birds... perched in line, at the top of the stairs, peering down.<eos> Adam used to send down Christos to steal canapes.<eos> Who are you thinking of inviting?<eos> Bored people and guilty people.

Look, you're welcome to join us if you're at a loose end.<eos> You don't have to pity me, Adam.<eos> I didn't think I was.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to be rude.<eos> It's just that I've been feeling more and more like a widow these days and not much else.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> You know, you learn so much more about people after they're dead than when they were alive.<eos> I'll let you get back to...<eos> Natasha.
Do you have a picture of her?<eos> You don't need one.<eos> Just take a good look at me.<eos> She's my twin.<eos> Hello? It's me.<eos> Why don't you put that thing down.<eos> If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.<eos> You were meant to give me more time.<eos> These things happen.<eos> Not to me.
I will put it back together.<eos> Make sure that you do.<eos> Elena's worth more than you.<eos> Alright.<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> Insurance.<eos> Just a little tracker, you know... it would be terrible if me and you were to lose each other.<eos> It's like Fort Knox in here.<eos> But it's far more secure.<eos> Mrs. Clios...
That's why I'm here.<eos> In light of what's happened,<eos> The Clios collection is coveted. Yes, it is.<eos> And expensive!<eos> And even for these vulgarians, 400 million is not a steal<eos> Let's not be too stuck on the collection as a whole.<eos> Will Georgina not be upset?<eos> No.<eos> No, she and I would accept offers on single items, be reasonable.<eos> Reasonable?
They scavenge and trade it for food.<eos> Then, Nos smuggles it in tunnels into the Badlands on the black market.<eos> You wanna see Veil?<eos> You wanna get home?<eos> You wanna see your baby? Huh?<eos> Then, this is our ticket in.<eos> Unless you wanna walk a few hundred more miles, find a way over the mountains?<eos> Please say no.<eos> How well do you know this guy?<eos> Nos? Oh.
Oh, uh...<eos> You can tell her I'm okay.<eos> I just need to get some rest.<eos> You're not like the other men.<eos> They get angry if she's late.<eos> Yeah, um,<eos> I already have someone.<eos> Is that the reason you want to get back to the Badlands?<eos> I heard you talking earlier.<eos> Yeah, for her and, uh, our baby.

Changed?<eos> Changed how?<eos> After you saved my life, you forced me to see that despite the things you've done, you're not the man you were.<eos> Don't ruin what we have by doing something you'll regret.<eos> She's lying to you.<eos> She'll say anything to keep you from the truth.<eos> If you let that boy live, he will betray you just like I did.<eos> Like Sunny did. Like your wives.<eos> Henry is a gift. A new beginning. A second chance.<eos> For all of us.
Likewise DNA.<eos> Do we know what she was wearing when she left home?<eos> Shorts and a vest top.<eos> Right.<eos> It was that weekend, wasn't it?<eos> Sweltering.<eos> I weeded the path.<eos> It's all grown back now, this weather.<eos> - Why is this worse?<eos> - Because of the publicity.
And I know you've been asked a hundred times, but... .. I would like to try and start with a clean slate.<eos> Is that all right?<eos> - Now, where this body was found...<eos> - For God's sake.<eos> Stop treating us like we're stupid!<eos> Stop covering your back!<eos> I know it's her.<eos> I can just tell.<eos> Do you know who owns that land?<eos> No-one.
And while we're looking at people in the area, see if his workers are legit.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Hey, Kenny.<eos> You're a life-saver.<eos> Ha.<eos> What do you want me to do with Uniform?<eos> Uniform?<eos> House to house.
Home wasn't great.<eos> They treated her like a skivvy.<eos> When you say "they"...<eos> What, do you mean her parents?<eos> - You know her mam's ill?<eos> - Mm.<eos> That meant she had to do more than her fair share.<eos> Can you think of anyone, anyone at all, who might have wanted to harm her?<eos> You know them pickers?<eos> Off Jack Madden's farm?
She lived and worked with mum and dad on a dairy farm just outside of Brindale.<eos> Failed to return home from Eastbury Festival some time after the 2nd of last month.<eos> Now, the body was found five miles from said dairy farm, 40 days after she left the village.<eos> She'd been strangled.<eos> Primary line of inquiry is to establish what time she departed the festival, who she met there, and who, if anyone, she went with.<eos> Now, Hicham, have you got the CCTV from the bus station yet?<eos> We're trawling, but neither us nor Missing Persons found her on any bus coming or going.<eos> And do we know who she was going to see, music-wise?<eos> - Party Crusade.<eos> - Who?
Will you pass on my condolences?<eos> Aye, course I will.<eos> Thanks, George.<eos> I did make her a top priority, even though she was an adult.<eos> I did throw the kitchen sink at it.<eos> So, according to your statement, you were on duty at the festival and you treated Mia.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She said she'd taken a couple of pills.<eos> - What sort of pills?
Is it my fault?<eos> Mm...<eos> She was murdered, love.<eos> I didn't... realise.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> If I'd known, I would have...<eos> Would have what?<eos> It's probably nothing.<eos> I just didn't say this with the other policeman.<eos> What?
- No.<eos> This guy was older.<eos> I think I've seen him on the Missing Mia feed.<eos> Have you?<eos> Well, let's have a look.<eos> Stop.<eos> Maybe that guy, maybe.<eos> How sure are you -- on a scale of one to ten?<eos> Seven.<eos> Well, thanks, Meryl.
Is it about this body?<eos> - Was it Mia?<eos> - Yes, it was.<eos> So you both knew Mia, then?<eos> Yeah, absolutely. Erm...<eos> I mean... she'd been coming here since...<eos> Well, forever, really.<eos> She'd been a Saturday girl.<eos> So she was working for you just prior to her disappearance?<eos> On and off.
So, why did you think she'd returned to the area?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was desperate.<eos> So, were you still together, you and Mia?<eos> - Does it matter?<eos> - Aye, it does.<eos> Because I need to be clear on her significant relationships.<eos> And will you stop doing that while I'm talking to you?<eos> In my head, we were still together, yeah.<eos> And in hers?
- Yes, ma'am. All sorted.<eos> Thanks, mate.<eos> I'm gonna check the bar.<eos> Have you seen this lass by any chance?<eos> - Her down the front!<eos> - I can't hear you!<eos> Her down the front.<eos> She's in one of Mia's photos!<eos> Hey!<eos> Out of my way!
We had no clue.<eos> We've been stuck in rehearsals all this week.<eos> Do you recognise this lass?<eos> That's Erin.<eos> She's er...<eos> She's our super-fan.<eos> Like, where we go, she goes.<eos> She'll have a couple of those bands.<eos> You should ask her about your missing girl...<eos> Maya?
- And I don't think you saw Mia.<eos> - She was there.<eos> I know she was.<eos> If this had gone to court, lying under oath, that is a serious offence.<eos> You'd be looking at a seven-year stretch.<eos> - Prison?<eos> - Obstructing a murder inquiry!<eos> - I didn't know she was dead!<eos> - Why did you do it?<eos> For a pay-out?
A tip-off!<eos> Someone saw a blonde girl wearing a red scarf the evening Mia Hinkin went missing.<eos> Now, we know a scarf or something similar was used as the murder weapon and I'd lay money that the fibres found will match that scarf.<eos> - So, who called this in?<eos> - Anonymous.<eos> Saw her down the Brindale road.<eos> - She could have hitched a lift from anyone.<eos> - No. I think she knew her assailant.<eos> - What makes you so sure?<eos> - Because of those texts to the brother.
She's saying she's gonna miss me.<eos> She says we should run away together.<eos> I've no idea where any of this is coming from, so I pull the car over... just to talk, mind.<eos> - And er...<eos> - What, she makes a move on you?<eos> I swear, I didn't see it coming.<eos> Ah, well, how would you, love?<eos> It's all in her head.<eos> So I says, "Look, Mia, I'm taking you home."<eos> Mm-hm.
Slammed the door, walked away.<eos> - And you just let her go?<eos> - Yeah, I just let her go.<eos> Hm.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just... drove off... and left her... alone... on the road.<eos> I think you killed her.<eos> I swear on my kids' lives... I didn't kill her.<eos> Gary Tovey's swabs.
Message one.'<eos> 'Yeah, this is Erin, Mia's mate.<eos> You said to call you if I remembered anything.<eos> That fella that came into the bar, the one that was pestering Mia.<eos> I think I've just seen him.'<eos> Please!<eos> Somebody!<eos> Oh, come on, wake up!<eos> We've got her leaving the station on CCTV.<eos> Nothing after that.
Tells you she loves him.<eos> So you offer her a friendly shoulder to cry on.<eos> I didn't see her that night.<eos> Cos you were the only one who ever helped her, weren't you, love?<eos> Hm?<eos> The flat in town, keeping it between you.<eos> The money and whatever else.<eos> Cos you thought you were on a promise.<eos> Well, you got that wrong, didn't you? It was Gary she wanted.<eos> No comment.
Hm?<eos> The flat in town, keeping it between you.<eos> The money and whatever else.<eos> Cos you thought you were on a promise.<eos> Well, you got that wrong, didn't you? It was Gary she wanted.<eos> No comment.<eos> She was never gonna settle for a fella like you, was she, love?<eos> Hm?<eos> - That why you killed her?<eos> - No comment.
Well, I wanted to get an early start on this recipe, and I thought that I could toss everything together quickly, but I just found this second card stuck to the first one with the final instruction:<eos> "Stir all day."<eos> There must be a very good reason for doing that.<eos> Well, these recipes are so interesting and so unique, I feel like I need to follow them exactly.<eos> Well, then you're going to need a spoon. Oh.<eos> It's not over there. I moved it.<eos> I needed to rearrange the space so it worked more efficient.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Sure. Oh!<eos> Happy Birthday!
I look forward to getting to know both of you.<eos> - Thanks. You too.<eos> Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you more.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Well, I always take extra effort for the people I like the best. - Stephanie.<eos> - Grace, - I didn't know you were home.<eos> - For a while, yeah.
When are you gonna tell Diana about Molly?<eos> Agent Thomas has endured considerable hardship with her daughter...<eos> The road is not gonna get any smoother.<eos> I have a feeling you're going to tell me to pull off the Band-Aid.<eos> Sooner rather than later.<eos> You have a pretty neck, Mom.<eos> Coming from a young Modigliani, I take that as a high compliment.<eos> That's a... that's a really nice one.<eos> Can I see what you've been up to?<eos> Wow.
Yeah, I don't know who "they" are, but, according to Sun Tzu, you should never fight an uphill battle.<eos> He had seven wives.<eos> And this is where the Horseman turned tail?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You said 30 paces west from your last location?<eos> Precisely.<eos> Okay, we're right below you, and we've got something strange on our end.<eos> There's something bolted to the underside of the manhole cover, and it's sitting dead center in a ring of protective magical glyphs.<eos> That are carved into the tunnel walls.<eos> Yeah, from different ancient cultures.
This thing that went after the president, the red coat, that's not a fashion statement, is it?<eos> The Horseman and I have been sworn enemies since our first meeting on the battlefield in 1781.<eos> Events transpired that saw him and me slumber for... a little over 200 years.<eos> Until a malevolent demon raised him as one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.<eos> 'Twas our great misfortune to face him many times.<eos> "Our?" You and who?<eos> My partner, and Miss Jenny's sister, Lieutenant Grace Abigail Mills.<eos> 'Twas our duty as the two Witnesses to... You were witnesses?<eos> You just said the Four Horsemen.<eos> So, like, the two Biblical Witnesses?
An apostle of the square, level and plumb, are we?<eos> I am a Freemason, yes.<eos> This city.<eos> This does not exist, does it?<eos> Not yet.<eos> No.<eos> But it will.<eos> A metropolis dedicated to the noble and true, with liberty and justice for all men, regardless of their race, color or creed, incorporating the sublime aspects of Persian and Aramaic architecture,<eos> Mayan and Egyptian,<eos> Sumerian.
So, Banneker went and worked with the founders after all?<eos> Story for another day.<eos> We do not have long to prepare.<eos> You're thinking J Street.<eos> It is a cul-de-sac, so if we lure the Horseman in, we can use Banneker's disc to block his way out.<eos> But you said that it's enchanted, so how do we open it?<eos> There-There might be some reference in the secret histories.<eos> Very good.<eos> With me.<eos> Wow.
Agent Thomas...<eos> The Horseman... has a head.<eos> Tell the others to open the way.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'll bring him to you.<eos> The doorway.<eos> Open it now!<eos> Let's hope this works.<eos> Hoy.<eos> Duir.
This is truly a milestone in the war against evil.<eos> None of this changes the fact that you kept crucial information from me.<eos> About who you are, where you're from, when you're from, and about my daughter.<eos> And that you think there is a world in which I'm gonna let you take her anywhere near any of this.<eos> I assure you upon my honor, every one of us will be with you for every step of this journey, and Molly's safety is absolute paramount.<eos> Yeah. Which is why none of you are coming anywhere near her.<eos> I understand this is difficult to take in...<eos> Stop.<eos> This ends here and now.<eos> No more supernatural creatures.

You ready for the best lunch of your life?<eos> So it's fourth down and 17, right.<eos> A minute left on the clock.<eos> No time-outs left.<eos> - And you're down a field goal?<eos> - Oh, no, sweetheart.<eos> We're down five.<eos> We have to get in the end zone.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - No kidding.
Ah, I suppose she is.<eos> But is her head in the game?<eos> She said she's not messing around with this guy at the cafe but, Heller should have been closed by now.<eos> It's the easiest mark we've ever had.<eos> Maybe he's more complicated than he seems.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What do we really know about Gary Heller?<eos> Just what we have in the Doctor's file.<eos> I got into his computer, but so far nothing much has turned up.<eos> What about you?
Say it, both of you.<eos> - Okay, we promise.<eos> - Promise.<eos> With feta on top. We'll take the phone back.<eos> - Now can we go?<eos> - I'm driving.<eos> Shotgun.<eos> Have a good meeting.<eos> I'm sorry again a...<eos> Shit.
I think just the check. Thank you.<eos> By the way, the service here was incredible.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, my God, he's like a boner with a body.<eos> Now, that's funny.<eos> Oh, my God, she opened it.<eos> - Is it working?<eos> - What's happening?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Seattle.
Of course.<eos> Can we do this without her vote?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> I've taken the temperature of the room.<eos> It's, uh, chilly.<eos> Broadmore's gonna back Ryder 'cause Ryder's made him promises.<eos> Hassan and Rojas think Ryder has overstepped, but they won't vote with us unless we get a majority, so you need Chau.<eos> I've been told to report that all the refugees have been confined to their quarters until The Widow returns.<eos> Odessa, I hardly recognized you.<eos> Doll to butterfly.
Are you the healer?<eos> Depends what ails you, and what you have to trade.<eos> She told us to come here. Said you were a friend.<eos> Bring her inside. Right away.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> Didn't I tell you?<eos> Didn't I tell you?<eos> Look how big and bright...<eos> She's close.<eos> Right here on the other side.
I sat on my bed that night with the knife, waiting to plunge it into my heart the moment I heard him knock.<eos> I waited.<eos> And I waited...<eos> But the knock never came.<eos> The next morning, the widow asked me to forgive her for not killing him sooner.<eos> That was the kindest thing that anyone had ever done for me.<eos> That was the first time I said "I love you" to anyone and meant it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll stay.<eos> But not for the widow.
Tell me, how did you find my bunker?<eos> With due respect, you're not as clever as you think.<eos> You never were.<eos> You tracked me down all by yourself, did you?<eos> You're not bad for an old cripple.<eos> Maybe if you'd listened to me once in a while, you wouldn't be living like a roach in a hole.<eos> I'd keep a very close eye on this one if I was you.<eos> Now... what do you want?<eos> Same as you do.<eos> The other barons dead.
Well, Waldo did not find me himself.<eos> I promise, no harm will come to either of them.<eos> You just... You just give me what's mine, and I'll agree to your confederacy.<eos> I can't give you veil. I can't.<eos> Well, that's disappointing.<eos> I'll give you a little more time to reconsider.<eos> But, baby, don't wait too long.<eos> I'd hate for you to watch your precious butterflies get their wings clipped when the other barons come.<eos> And come they will.<eos> Bye for now.
Is there anything I can get you?<eos> I have everything I ever wanted right here.<eos> Sunny.<eos> Hey. Any change?<eos> No. He said some stuff.<eos> I think I heard the name Henry and then nothing.<eos> He looks bad, bajie.<eos> Shame I couldn't get something stronger.<eos> I mean, for me.<eos> Obviously, not him.
Plus, girls like fighters.<eos> Is there a girl you're trying to impress?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Is she pretty?<eos> Her name's Artemis.<eos> I met her when I was playing in the woods.<eos> Sorry, kiddo.<eos> You all right? How about this?<eos> I'll race you to the pens.<eos> Ready?
The third choice, you do not want to find out about.<eos> Do you still wanna know why I left?<eos> I killed my mother.<eos> Same way flea killed those nomads and cogs.<eos> All this time I've been looking for her so that we could find our way back to azra.<eos> But then in the mirror chamber I learned the truth.<eos> Sunny's the only other person who's cared about me, bajie.<eos> I can't lose him.<eos> And I, I can't save him either.<eos> Not without your help.
It's what you do, Quinn.<eos> An escort of my men will take her to the border, and then she's on her own.<eos> Let her suffer the misery she has given to others.<eos> Hey.<eos> Be nimble, yeah?<eos> In, out.<eos> All right. The scrolls are over here.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> I'll look for the scrolls. I need you to look for a leather satchel about so big.<eos> A satchel?
It's a pity you rejected the chance for me to teach you.<eos> Have any ideas?<eos> Cut the novices.<eos> They'll attack the abbots.<eos> M.K. Let's go!<eos> - Come on.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm taking Henry away from here.<eos> Away from you.
It's not like we can just stroll through a legitimate checkpoint, is it?<eos> We'll be caught, branded like animals and chained together for the rest of our natural lives.<eos> And I'm sorry but...<eos> I don't want to be chained to you again.<eos> I... I don't want to be.<eos> You can trust them?<eos> Well...<eos> No, not really.<eos> I mean, they're smugglers but our coin is good.<eos> Unbelievable.
We'll be caught, branded like animals and chained together for the rest of our natural lives.<eos> And I'm sorry but...<eos> I don't want to be chained to you again.<eos> I...

Don't worry about bajie.<eos> I gave him the key to his freedom.<eos> He's probably long gone by now.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> You're a vision.<eos> Lydia: Today, under the blessing of the gods, we are here to join these two souls in sacred union.<eos> Will you present your palms for the joining of blood lines?<eos> Lydia: Your hand.<eos> May your bloodlines be fruitful and bound together till death.<eos> Till death.
No one's safe.<eos> Sunny, if you kill me, you'll never find your family.<eos> I know where veil is... And your boy, Henry. Tell me where.<eos> I'll tell you everything that chau can't.<eos> But not if I'm dead.<eos> Enough.<eos> Finish her.<eos> I'm a woman of my word.<eos> Look, we both want the same thing.<eos> Quinn dead.
Ooh.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Adorable.<eos> Very impressive, little Flea. Have you quite finished?<eos> Very nice. We good?<eos> Hmm? Huh. Well, well, well.<eos> You are full of surprises.<eos> Huh. Where did you get this book?<eos> You can trust me.<eos> Father.
You've been there before.<eos> Last time I faced Quinn, I didn't have an army.<eos> Yeah, The Widow, and her Clippers.<eos> Just don't you forget your training, keep an eye on your flank.<eos> Something you wanna tell me?<eos> Why, whatever do you mean?<eos> I'm not blind.<eos> Just because The Widow and I want the same thing, doesn't mean I trust her one bit.<eos> Where are you off to now?<eos> The Armory.
Wait, The Widow is Flea?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You trained The Widow?<eos> Uh, yeah. Listen, with that book in her possession, no one's safe.<eos> Well, she doesn't know how to read it.<eos> Besides, with the compass back at the Monastery, the book doesn't do us any good.<eos> Hmm. Yeah, um, about that...<eos> The compass could be closer than you think.<eos> You've had that this whole time?<eos> Yeah, sorry.
You were right, I shouldn't have provoked him.<eos> We just have to keep our heads down a little longer.<eos> That's not gonna work anymore.<eos> Quinn has rigged this entire place to explode.<eos> He will kill every last one of us before he'll let anyone take that child.<eos> We can't wait for Sunny any longer, we're gonna have to find our own way out of here. I searched the woods from here to the river,<eos> I couldn't find Sunny.<eos> Could not, or would not?<eos> I don't know what you mean, Mother.<eos> "Baron."
What kind of person do you think I am?<eos> I don't know anymore.<eos> Power's changed you. Now you're... willing to sacrifice innocent lives for your own interests.<eos> I'd choose your next words very carefully.<eos> You're no better than any other Baron.<eos> Swindling people with declarations of goodwill, only to stab them in the back.<eos> What did I do to deserve such contempt?<eos> - I gave you the world. - Bullshit.<eos> You've got everyone fooled.<eos> Minerva.
At least I still have the book. It doesn't seem you can say the same - for your $323 million.<eos> - Yeah, well, nuclear war wasn't good for the economy.<eos> - No one wanted my gold certificates.<eos> - Or your paintings or all your other material trappings.<eos> Even greed has its limits. - What about your book?<eos> - The Lumen continues to be of vital importance.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> Hey, I believe you, Professor.<eos> When the time comes, we're gonna need people like you.<eos> Experienced fighters.
In the absence of antibiotics, we just have to wait and see.<eos> What's with the firepower?<eos> You have a bigger target or what?<eos> What firepower?<eos> The fertilizer bombs.<eos> From the smell, it's either that or you're raising livestock in here.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Yeah, the plan is to take out as many buses as we can.<eos> It's the easiest way to take out multiple strigoi.<eos> And multiple people.
Yeah, I do, actually.<eos> They're putting their own misguided sense of righteousness above the well-being of all of humanity.<eos> If, instead, they would follow, I don't know, my example, maybe put all that energy into actually helping one another, then it wouldn't be such a nightmare, would it?<eos> No, it, uh... it actually would be pretty great, right?<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> You gonna help me, Miranda?<eos> No. Thank you.<eos> Guess I'm not as civic-minded as you are.<eos> Quite the misanthrope, actually.<eos> Misanthrope?
You gonna help me, Miranda?<eos> No. Thank you.<eos> Guess I'm not as civic-minded as you are.<eos> Quite the misanthrope, actually.<eos> Misanthrope?<eos> All right. I guess that's your call.<eos> Well, I hope you end up on the right side of things, Miranda.<eos> Because the sad thing is, these delusional people? They don't exactly thrive in the new world.<eos> Anyways, you know where to find me.<eos> Still no fever.
I can't do it! I'm sorry! I can't breathe in there.<eos> Hey. Hey, it's okay, it's okay. Yes, you can.<eos> You just need to stay calm and breathe slowly, okay?<eos> No, you go.<eos> I'm not leaving you here while you're in trouble.<eos> Okay, seriously, I need to leave!<eos> This is your last chance!<eos> Go on.<eos> - Help me!<eos> - Shit.
Why?<eos> She isn't staying.<eos> I won't have that child in my house.<eos> You have to send her away.<eos> I would.<eos> But the fact is we can't defy your father.<eos> Not now.<eos> We're supposed to just keep her? I can't afford to antagonize him.<eos> You won't for once stand up for yourself?<eos> Or for me?
Or for me?<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> You always do what you're told no matter what it does to your family.<eos> Bread and jam.<eos> It's raspberry.<eos> It's good.<eos> Lucasz. just like Janowski would have wanted. focused.<eos> I hope that doesn't mean what I'm afraid it does?<eos> We're going to Berlin.<eos> Berlin?
What about ice cream?<eos> You ever had ice cream?<eos> Papa. It's just too soon.<eos> You can't dwell on unfortunate events Sabine.<eos> You have to move on.<eos> Not every woman is this lucky to have a child with such excellent. Germanic traits.<eos> take her back.<eos> - How does she have no family? or a little boy;<eos> To where she came from.<eos> To her family.
Does Franz Faber know you are a spy?<eos> - What is your real just stop!<eos> Please stop.<eos> I'll talk.<eos> This is just my first assignment.<eos> I was sent to Paris to develop trust with Faber through his wife.<eos> So she's not a real friend?<eos> I made friends with her to get closer to him.<eos> But neither of them knows this. it wasn't business.<eos> not for him.
But you don't have the video?<eos> The police said it was self-erasing.<eos> But they took the senator's phone to try and recover it.<eos> So, only you saw it?<eos> Yes.<eos> She was eating ice cream.<eos> Her boyfriend was playing video games.<eos> I did not trust that boy the second I saw him.<eos> What flavor?<eos> Ice cream.
Fair enough, but, uh, do us a favor...<eos> No more threatening videos, okay, Ryan?<eos> We already told the police there was no video.<eos> Burgers?<eos> Really, Michelle, after all that ice cream?<eos> 'Course, that was several hours ago.<eos> How do you know that I had ice cream?<eos> How, indeed, if there was no video?<eos> Who are you calling?<eos> The senator.
- Let go, please!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Ryan!<eos> - Get in there!<eos> Get in!<eos> Ryan!<eos> Help!<eos> Please!<eos> Help!<eos> Help!
Here's what I've got so far.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - What is that?<eos> A list of people who have a grudge against our dear senator.<eos> Popular guy.<eos> Politics is a blood sport.<eos> There's still some names I'm working on.<eos> He fell out with a couple of property developers, and I'm trying to track down his ex-fiancée.<eos> What happened there?<eos> Sorry.
Above my pay grade.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Check out the ex-fiancée.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's gonna take some time to go through all these.<eos> Time Michelle may not have.<eos> We need them to come to us.<eos> How?<eos> Throw them some shade.<eos> Help!
Thank you.<eos> - Check out the ex-fiancée.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's gonna take some time to go through all these.<eos> Time Michelle may not have.<eos> We need them to come to us.<eos> How?<eos> Throw them some shade.<eos> Help!<eos> Help!
I assume that's your goal here, unless I'm missing something.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Action.<eos> As I take up my new position as senator of this great state, I feel it's important to clear the air with those in my past who I have wronged.<eos> If I have offended or harmed you in any way, let this statement heal the rift between us.<eos> This is Olina, my mother.<eos> I'm Nalanie, Ryan's cousin.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Nothing.
So, how did she die in Laos when she never left the United States?<eos> See?<eos> Beautiful.<eos> My God.<eos> You look just like her.<eos> My name is Sawm.<eos> I knew your mother.<eos> These are from her to me.<eos> They'll help you understand.<eos> My mother?
Abby, take a look at this.<eos> Of course.<eos> What is it?<eos> Sodium polyethanol sulfonate. It's an additive used to prevent clotting.<eos> Looks like the radiation broke it down and caused a chain reaction.<eos> What happens if we remove it?<eos> We could save everyone.<eos> You could?<eos> So you're saying this can still work.<eos> Not without testing.
Wait.<eos> Baylis was Sangedakru.<eos> He was.<eos> He was also a thief.<eos> He probably stole those stones.<eos> A thief who didn't bear the mark of Sangedakru.<eos> That wasn't Baylis, was it?<eos> Come on, Clarke. That's crazy. Of course...<eos> Who did we just kill?<eos> - Hey, Emori...
Baylis was Sangedakru.<eos> He was.<eos> He was also a thief.<eos> He probably stole those stones.<eos> A thief who didn't bear the mark of Sangedakru.<eos> That wasn't Baylis, was it?<eos> Come on, Clarke. That's crazy. Of course...<eos> Who did we just kill?<eos> - Hey, Emori...<eos> - Emori, no!
Were you able to find out about the key card?<eos> It gives you access to room 7 on the 8th floor of the PLC Building.<eos> Proximity to the Capitol, direct line of sight to the platform.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Vice President.<eos> They're gonna kill Kirkman.<eos> Gun!<eos> Alex, you've been hit.<eos> That's not my blood.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Help!
Speaker Hookstraten to see you, sir.<eos> What can I do for you, Kimble?<eos> You can tell me what the hell's going on in your mind.<eos> You know if you open those markets tomorrow, it'll be a disaster.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> And in case you've forgotten, you're addressing the office of the acting president.<eos> You know, Peter, when you first arrived in Congress, I thought you were... well... ordinary.<eos> Another first-termer just happy to be there, a man whose achievements had far outstripped even his own imagination.<eos> But I realize now that I'd underestimated you;<eos> your drive, your ambition.
So does every law firm in New York. No.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Interesting.<eos> I got a job offer, too.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> They want you to chair the department.<eos> No.<eos> It was from the president.<eos> The president of what?<eos> The United States.
Yeah, well, convince me. Tell me why I should let you inside.<eos> Catalan.<eos> - What?<eos> - Wells gave me a message.<eos> She told me to ask you about Catalan.<eos> Convinced now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Many on Wall Street are speculating that tomorrow's markets will experience the steepest nosedive since the Flash Crash of 2010.<eos> Investors are turning to assets... that are seen as safer bets in times of uncertainty.<eos> For...
She might.<eos> Nothing can touch us.<eos> I told you that.<eos> And if she's a problem, we remove her, too.<eos> So, how much longer are they saying it's gonna be?<eos> They're not, but they say he's doing fine.<eos> But, hopefully, they're gonna be finished up soon.<eos> Is Penny asleep?<eos> Only took about two books and half a movie, but I got her down.<eos> Which movie?
How can you be so sure?<eos> The eight surviving members of MacLeish's army unit have all been lying for a decade.<eos> There's got to be a weak link in here somewhere, someone with personal problems, drugs, booze, something.<eos> So what are you thinking?<eos> We find that person - and break him, but carefully.<eos> We can't afford to tip MacLeish off.<eos> We need to rattle his cage, not shatter it.<eos> Right.<eos> No!<eos> Help!
No!<eos> Hey. I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you. - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Are you okay, Daddy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just, uh... I had a bad dream.<eos> What do you got there?<eos> I drew it for you.<eos> For me?
I saw your chalk mark.<eos> What's up?<eos> It's Joyner.<eos> He wants to see you.<eos> Why?<eos> The FBI came to see him today.<eos> Again?<eos> What about?<eos> Said it was a routine follow-up, something to do with a helicopter manifest on the Kunar mission.<eos> Helicopter manifest?
He wants to see you.<eos> Why?<eos> The FBI came to see him today.<eos> Again?<eos> What about?<eos> Said it was a routine follow-up, something to do with a helicopter manifest on the Kunar mission.<eos> Helicopter manifest?<eos> Yeah. It sounds like bureaucratic busywork to me.<eos> Well, it sounds like the end of it then.<eos> Yeah, except for Joyner.
I served near there in the Peace Corps,<eos> Twenty-five... more than 25 years ago.<eos> They were some of the kindest people I've ever known.<eos> The brief said families are racing to the borders, trying to escape.<eos> I can't even imagine.<eos> Reach out to State. We need to do something.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Mr. Langdon.<eos> Where do you want me to start?<eos> How about the beginning?
So, I don't know what the goal of this conspiracy is.<eos> Is it a regime change?<eos> Maybe it's just anarchy. Whatever their philosophy... they probably felt you were the least likely to present an obstacle.<eos> Get me a one-pager on Africom and let the room know that the White House is monitoring the situation in Naruba.<eos> The president is taking this very seriously.<eos> - Uh, Seth, you got a sec?<eos> - Barely.<eos> What's up?<eos> I got a friend that told me a strange story.<eos> - What kind of friend?
She's an analyst at this government office park out in Alexandria.<eos> She says Aaron Shore was escorted into the facility by FBI agents.<eos> Your friend's yanking your chain.<eos> He's on leave... personal time.<eos> - Oh, yeah? What's that about?<eos> - I just told you.<eos> Thanks for stopping by.<eos> I find out otherwise, Seth, this is gonna be a story.<eos> - And I'm gonna say you denied it. - Knock yourself out.<eos> Despite my urgings and those of the U.N. ambassador,
What about the timeline of her relationship with Langdon...<eos> Retracing their steps?<eos> Been there, done that, twice.<eos> Chuck, what about fingerprints?<eos> Yeah, that would be great if we had them.<eos> Can you pull fingerprints off a photo?<eos> The resolution isn't exactly ready for prime time.<eos> It's okay, just see what you can do.<eos> - Amazing.<eos> - Here all week.
We got too much riding on this, the both of us.<eos> Hannah, I said I'm fine.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> I'm taking you home. What?<eos> Jason, get in the car.<eos> I'll walk.<eos> Reschedule that meeting.<eos> Aaron?<eos> Madam Speaker.
Okay, do we have anyone who can propose amendments?<eos> Because this bill has loopholes you could fly a plane through.<eos> Mr. President, we're just trying to figure out how to handle this development with Bowman. I just read the bill.<eos> I can see why it didn't get out of committee.<eos> The problem is, if you don't support the bill, you'll be branded a hypocrite who used the town hall for political purposes when you're really soft on guns.<eos> But if you do support it, you're opening yourself up to all sorts of criticism because of its flawed wording.<eos> Son of a bitch is trying to back us into a corner.<eos> Get ready for a fight.<eos> How long you been following me?<eos> Since the explosion.
I'm not very good at the Washington game yet.<eos> To be fair, you've never really been in the game.<eos> And as for that bill, well, the wording is piss-poor, but it's got the right guts.<eos> And more importantly, it's the bill you've got.<eos> Forget about how you got here, Tom.<eos> It's just like generals throughout history. You don't always get to choose your terrain.<eos> The only thing that matters now... is fighting the war that's in front of you.<eos> And it ain't a mistake if you win.<eos> Then we better get those 51 votes.<eos> Cream?

If we want to get any of those things done in this Congress, we need a united Republican front.<eos> You're not helping with this stunt.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> This is bigger than background checks.<eos> And I'm not interested in a united front if it means compromising my values.<eos> Now, I may be new to the Hill, but so is everybody else.<eos> You're the last of the old guard around here, Madam Speaker.<eos> So, uh... So get on board... or step aside.<eos> Thanks for the coffee.<eos> Ma'am.
- Uh, no.<eos> Uh... today is about people, not politics, and I am here to listen.<eos> Okay, if everybody has what they need, Jake here can escort you out.<eos> We'll let the First Lady get started. Thank you, everybody.<eos> Thank you, Seth.<eos> You don't have an office anymore, either?<eos> I do, but that would require getting you White House clearance, and that would require a lot of explanation.<eos> Feel like going on a road trip?<eos> Where are we heading?<eos> North Dakota.
Look, Leslie, I'm not interested in playing this out publicly.<eos> I just need you to tell me which Republicans would be open to a sit-down?<eos> The murder rate in particular cities in this country is unacceptable to President Kirkman...<eos> Senator, I understand and appreciate your position, but 84% of the country wants tougher background checks.<eos> Now, the American people have spoken, and it's our job to listen.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I'm very sorry to hear you say that, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Goodbye.
I'm working my first Congressional vote as chief of staff to the President of the United States.<eos> That bottle is long gone, Aaron.<eos> Speaking of the vote... Here you go.<eos> I know you're gonna need a few Republicans, and I know you're facing an uphill climb.<eos> That's not exactly a secret.<eos> What if we could help?<eos> Hookstraten?<eos> She's a Republican...<eos> - and she is Speaker.<eos> - Of the House.
- 12 years old... - Yeah.<eos> Without a specific law targeting gun trafficking, we're not giving law enforcement a fighting chance to stop the flood of weapons coming into cities like Chicago.<eos> You are preaching to the choir, Mrs. Kirkman.<eos> You know, I championed this effort in Massachusetts, and I would be glad to lead the charge here, if and when we have the momentum.<eos> Of course.<eos> And in the meantime, let me say... I am glad to have a sisterin-arms - in the White House.<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> And thank you so much for your support with this vote.<eos> I hope we'll all be celebrating tomorrow.<eos> Goodbye.
The plate's from a White House pool of vehicles.<eos> You're sure?<eos> That's what it says.<eos> I need to get a name. Hundreds of people work there. Any one of them could have accessed it.<eos> Hey, I paid you to get a name.<eos> You paid me to run a plate.<eos> Wh... I should at least get a discount!<eos> White House.<eos> - Hey. Hey, hey!<eos> Big win today!
What does that mean?<eos> Just a couple more. Thank you.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Gentlemen, I want to thank you for your service.<eos> And I promise, we will look at the numbers for those body cameras as soon as possible.<eos> Thank you, Mr. President.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Sir, Speaker Hookstraten.<eos> Great. Madam Speaker.
If you want to talk again, please feel free to contact my attorney.<eos> Charming.<eos> What?<eos> "We have failed our ancestors by allowing America to become a broken system of oppression.<eos> It is our job to take back America from the corrupt leaders who seek to take our land and money."<eos> Everything he's saying... It's all there.<eos> Go home.<eos> It's late.<eos> Hey, did you put eyes on Lloyd?<eos> Yes, 24/7.
- Hey.<eos> - Hear a storm's coming. - Really?<eos> Yeah, we, um... we haven't watched the weather report in a while.<eos> So what brings you to Driggs?<eos> We're just, um... just heading up the mountain.<eos> - You take care now.<eos> - Okay, you, too.<eos> Well, if that was a test, I think we just failed that one.<eos> Well, we're marked now.<eos> New York plates.
Whoa. Wait a minute.<eos> I got you.<eos> I'm sorry, but my meeting with the Secretary of Energy ran over.<eos> I hope you haven't been waiting too long.<eos> There are worse places to wait.<eos> Does it go away?<eos> Does what go away?<eos> Being here... The awe of it all.<eos> No.<eos> Not for me.
Got that right.<eos> Mr. President. Julia.<eos> Emily, come on in.<eos> Any word from Bowman?<eos> Yes, but unfortunately, not what we want to hear.<eos> He said no to Clemens.<eos> Okay, on to plan B.<eos> Plan B?<eos> Julia, the President and I were speaking earlier about a name we haven't brought up, a name we think Bowman would be hard pressed to say no to.<eos> Who?
They also have armed lookouts posted.<eos> The sat survey's showing 10 to 12 vehicles parked in a cleared area.<eos> It's almost like they're waiting for something.<eos> Those license plates come back?<eos> Yeah, they're all bogus or stolen.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> And we don't have ears on any of these people.<eos> We have no idea who they are.<eos> Yeah, they don't seem to be in anything electronic.<eos> No cellphones, no radio chatter.
You're kidding.<eos> And we don't have ears on any of these people.<eos> We have no idea who they are.<eos> Yeah, they don't seem to be in anything electronic.<eos> No cellphones, no radio chatter.<eos> No, they're very old-school when it comes to infrastructure.<eos> Signs and... And countersigns...<eos> Very analogue when they want to be.<eos> We're going to have to observe them up close and personal.<eos> No unnecessary risks, Hannah.
So, here's something I didn't know when I came to the White House. George Washington ran America's first spy ring during the Revolutionary War.<eos> His agents relayed British troop movements.<eos> And they didn't even have cellphones.<eos> He doesn't look very happy.<eos> Well, you probably wouldn't want to smile either if you had wooden teeth.<eos> - Mr. President! - It's the President!<eos> I heard that we had some very special guests here in the White House today.<eos> Including President Richmond's son.<eos> Tyler, really good to see you again.<eos> Same here, Mr. President.
Thanks.<eos> Congressman Saldua's here.<eos> Congressman, welcome to the White House.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> It's an honor.<eos> I was hoping I might get an invitation soon, uh, though I am a bit wary about coming in today, given the circumstances.<eos> I'm not here to meddle in any ongoing investigations, and I am very sorry that we haven't had the chance to meet yet.<eos> I'm still trying to find my way around here, as I'm sure you are.<eos> Every day, Mr. President.
- The ramifications... - Look, I love music as much as anyone.<eos> But a lot of folks think we should throw everything we've got into science, technology, engineering, math.<eos> We used to lead the world in those areas.<eos> Now, we're barely in the middle of the pack.<eos> I don't think our children should be forced to choose between art or science.<eos> I'm happy to debate this, Mr. President, when we put together the next budget.<eos> This is the year of our reckoning.<eos> The rest of the world is catching up to what we've known...<eos> That for far too long, government has tried to hijack our identities, control our lives, and brainwash our children.<eos> But no longer.
You can believe him there, Jozef.<eos> We can all believe him. Obviously, I am hoping for your support at tomorrow's summit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> France looks forward to your proposal.<eos> I appreciate that, Madame.<eos> This isn't on the White House tour.<eos> Access to Agent Wells' office is extremely restricted.<eos> Where is Hannah?<eos> Any chance we can recover those deleted Browning Reed files?<eos> Not without a time machine.
Whitaker.<eos> Are you watching Abe Leonard on television?<eos> No, but I read his story.<eos> It's all working.<eos> Everyone's focused on the FBI, not us.<eos> Well, that's great, but where did he get this stuff about Lozano?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He did that on his own.<eos> Well, he's treading on dangerous ground.<eos> Not really.
Of course he's telling the truth.<eos> If the president stands by his intelligence, why is he looking into the allegations? Sure.<eos> So, I've tried to be perfectly clear.<eos> You want answers. The president wants answers. Which is why he is looking into the allegations, okay?<eos> And he'll make a statement to the public at the appropriate time, but right now he is focused on the first NATO summit, which is what I would love to answer questions about.<eos> This is Foerstel.<eos> Special Agent Foerstel, this is Chief Petty Officer Lucy Fernandez, U.S. Coast Guard, Indian River, Delaware.<eos> We received a mayday call from Hannah Wells last night.<eos> You found her?<eos> Not exactly, sir.
So I heard.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Moss told you?<eos> He may have sent me a photo.<eos> We are no longer friends.<eos> Fernandez?<eos> Agent Foerstel. Nice to meet you.<eos> Status update.<eos> We've covered this entire area.<eos> So far, nothing.
At least he didn't screw with my memory of her.<eos> I will explain it when we're outta here.<eos> All right, so what's the plan?<eos> Something that doesn't involve us getting shot on the way out?<eos> No, I worked up a security clearance, told the guards I'm taking charge of you.<eos> It's a prisoner transfer from Detention Block AA-23.<eos> - Mmm! That's my girl!<eos> - Blade Runner?<eos> - Star Wars.<eos> - Darn.
- You could go back to research.<eos> - What?<eos> ! And give up show business?<eos> Nah.<eos> Maybe if I play nice, and don't piss anyone off for a while,<eos> Blair will let me back in the Stitch lab, but...<eos> Why would you even want to?<eos> Because that's where you'll be.<eos> Okay, you need to keep Stitching.<eos> - Not without you.
My colleagues are being reassigned.<eos> I don't want that to happen.<eos> Anything else?<eos> I want Maggie Baptiste to run the Stitchers Program.<eos> I never want to see Mitchell Blair again.<eos> Is that it?<eos> No. I'm looking for someone.<eos> And I know you know where she is.<eos> Who are you looking for?<eos> My mother.
Long story short, the same people wired<eos> $250,000 to a woman in Baychester last week.<eos> Arlene Turner.<eos> Single, no criminal record. Not so much as a library fine.<eos> How does a woman like that get tied up with someone like Stepulov?<eos> She's homegrown. She can blend in.<eos> And the Dabbur Zann has been increasing their recruitment of Americans.<eos> Let's bring her in for a chat.<eos> How do you know Anton Stepulov?<eos> Who?
Last time I saw him, he kept talking about how his death would have so much meaning.<eos> Did you ask him what he meant?<eos> He was on a morphine drip, saying all kinds of things.<eos> You said he died in the hospital.<eos> - Did you see the body? - No.<eos> I wa...<eos> The hospital called and told me that he had passed.<eos> By the time I had gotten there, he had already been taken to the morgue.<eos> You think she's telling the truth?<eos> Partly.
Well, that's good, I mean, if we keep going that way...<eos> I strongly advise against it.<eos> For every memory that he recovers,<eos> Roman relearns his trauma.<eos> That's a real risk for retriggering his psychopathic tendencies.<eos> What are you telling us to do?<eos> Isolate him, in a facility that can care for him properly.<eos> - Like a mental hospital?<eos> For how long?<eos> For the rest of his life.
Which is a popular board game in South Africa.<eos> Roman helped decode the tattoo by using his muscle memory.<eos> I still had to write a program to...<eos> All right, where'd it lead us?<eos> Well, that's where it gets interesting.<eos> These are ATF surveillance photos.<eos> That's Roman.<eos> Who's that woman?<eos> Kat Jarrett, inner circle with the Viper Kings.<eos> The biker gang?
No.<eos> This was an experience you had.<eos> Try to visualize all the details.<eos> The night air, the smell of exhaust, the revving of the engines...<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> You've outdone yourself, Kat.<eos> Watch out for those potholes.<eos> That stuff will kill ya. Do I need to count this?<eos> Shepherd doesn't burn bridges if she doesn't have to.<eos> Always a pleasure, Roman.
Same way that I treated you when I found out who you were.<eos> Dr. Sun is wrong.<eos> He's my brother, Kurt. He's not going to hurt me.<eos> And he is capable of love.<eos> He was in a relationship with Kat, and he loved her.<eos> Or he was playing her to get what he needed.<eos> The same way you played Jeffrey Kantor.<eos> Shepherd trained both of you to manipulate people.<eos> Don't let him manipulate you.<eos> You ready?
You feel ready to me.<eos> Shepherd looked me right in the eye.<eos> Just before...<eos> There was nothing you could do.<eos> That's the problem!<eos> I mean, Shepherd goes where she wants.<eos> Does what she wants.<eos> Kills who she wants!<eos> There's nothing that we can ever do.<eos> Well, not entirely.
See if any of them trigger anything that leads us to Shepherd.<eos> Hey, sorry to interrupt.<eos> There's something you need to see.<eos> What are you doing back here already?<eos> I'm okay...<eos> I saw a doctor, and she said there's nothing physically wrong with me.<eos> All the more reason to get checked out psychologically.<eos> An okay person doesn't collapse at work.<eos> I had to come in today.<eos> For a tattoo.
I'm not sure yet, but I'm pretty sure it involves lithium.<eos> In order for this equation to work, its market price had to pass an all-time high.<eos> What's so special about lithium?<eos> It's the main component in all modern high-capacity batteries.<eos> Everything from smart phones to electric cars.<eos> Lithium powers the things that power everything.<eos> It's quickly becoming the new oil.<eos> But what about the tattoo itself?<eos> It's the seal for a secret society at Jameson College called Daedalus.<eos> The smart guy from Greek mythology.
Fortune 500 CEOs, a couple of senators.<eos> Even a former chairman of the Federal Reserve.<eos> No...<eos> And Gord Enver.<eos> Yeah, I thought you might like that one.<eos> Why does that sound familiar to me?<eos> Please tell me we don't need to bring him in.<eos> We need a member who will talk.<eos> And no one likes talking more than Rich.<eos> What the hell?
I been dating Nikki.<eos> - Freddy's girlfriend?<eos> - Ex-girlfriend.<eos> Oh, the ex-girlfriend of the killer you helped skip town?<eos> Do you have any idea how messed up that is?<eos> No, thought never crossed my mind, Zapata.<eos> Reade, Tasha,<eos> Rich and I are headed upstairs.<eos> - You got eyes on the guards?<eos> - Only the ones in front.
- And Rich went missing.<eos> - He ran, again.<eos> - Start tracking him.<eos> I found this on Oren.<eos> What's it for?<eos> I don't know, but I recognize the letters.<eos> Riley School of Alternative Energy.<eos> The school has a hazardous materials containment system.<eos> Right here on campus.<eos> - How hazardous?
Goodweather is out there somewhere.<eos> My legion is searching for them.<eos> As well as rounding up every nuclear weapon.<eos> You two are blowing up buses and you don't know they use them to transport human prisoners?<eos> If we waited for the perfect, polite moment to revolt, it would never happen.<eos> Those big Partnership buildings, I saw them pumping tankerfuls of blood into the pipes.<eos> If you could put something poisonous into that blood, you could take out thousands of strigoi and they wouldn't know what hit them. Ok.<eos> Let's do that.<eos> NEAR COUNTY ROAD 2, NORTH DAKOTA<eos> Damn.
And it's still day to day.<eos> How's it coming?<eos> - All right, so now we just hijack one of those tankers, roll up, and pump it into one of their nest houses, right? Just like they do.<eos> Yeah, that's not gonna work.<eos> I've seen how they do it.<eos> Security's too tight.<eos> They see a new driver, they'll nail us.<eos> Ok, so... you got a better idea?<eos> Well, you're right that we still need to get to a tanker. But we need them to deliver it.<eos> 284TH STRATEGIC MISSILE SQUADRON, LAUNCH SITE 1-12 NORTH DAKOTA

- I doubt it.<eos> Its eyes are filled with blood.<eos> I'd call this a win.<eos> You wished to see me, my Lord?<eos> There has been an incident in Philadelphia.<eos> Over 2,000 of our brethren were poisoned.<eos> How?<eos> Tainted blood from one of our trucks reached several nests.<eos> The Jew did this.<eos> Or one of his cohorts.
Previously on The Strain...<eos> You find it a bit of an insult that you're being asked to be a baby vessel?<eos> I want you to work for me, be my special liaison between myself and the ward.<eos> So you want me to be the mouthpiece<eos> - for your bullshit?
You know what?<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> This is the safest room in the whole goddamn city for humans.<eos> Do I ask anything in return?<eos> No.<eos> All I want... all I need is, I don't know, just a couple of minutes where we just pretend that...<eos> Mr. Desai.<eos> Mr. Eichhorst.<eos> You-you know... you know my wife, Selah?<eos> Frau Desai, of course.
She reminds me of my grandma...<eos> Ruth.<eos> She was a cold-blooded bitch, too.<eos> It's a pretty name, though.<eos> Ruth.<eos> Don't know.<eos> It's a bit "Old Testament" for me.<eos> What about Olive?<eos> Do you like that name?<eos> For a cartoon character, sure.
I'll show you my gratitude, OK?<eos> Take five minutes.<eos> Oh, you read that one?<eos> Hey.<eos> I never said four weeks.<eos> - You did too.<eos> - I said, "Yahoo!"<eos> Same thing.<eos> Why don't you get your boyfriend to put something new on the TV.<eos> "Boyfriend"?
- Come on, have a drink with me.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Eph, after the day I had,<eos> - I think you owe it to me.<eos> - I really can't.<eos> Oh.<eos> Got it.<eos> How long?<eos> Nine months, four days.<eos> Ever since, uh, Illumination Day.
Great, you're an expert on this too.<eos> Enough to know what you're going through right now.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> You're feeling guilty.<eos> Feeling angry.<eos> Mostly at yourself.<eos> Because you spent all that time fighting and you thought maybe you could make a difference, and now you're back at square one.<eos> And you've lost your brother and your team,<eos> and now you're wondering... what was the point<eos> of any of it?
How is she doing up there?<eos> Vitals stable?<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Yes, Doctor.<eos> Now breathe deeply.<eos> Tell me what else you remember.<eos> Bladder blade and Richardson retractor.<eos> I remember the smell.<eos> What did it smell like?<eos> Vegetable soup.
Tell me what else you remember.<eos> Bladder blade and Richardson retractor.<eos> I remember the smell.<eos> What did it smell like?<eos> Vegetable soup.<eos> That was her favourite.<eos> Suction.<eos> And she was always playing music.<eos> What kind of music?<eos> Bob Dylan.
It's a ten percent raise.<eos> You're already my highest-paid foreman.<eos> And finish this hellhole so I can sell it.<eos> Yeah. I'm sorry about the triplets.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, just stay a little bit longer.<eos> No. My time is up.<eos> I'll see you sooner than later.<eos> Blackout.<eos> End of play. And lights up.
I mean, you told me I was cruel. But worse than cruel... inauthentic.<eos> But you were right.<eos> So I went away for a while to try to find some authenticity.<eos> And I did it, okay?<eos> I found it. I did ayahuasca with a shaman in the Salt Flats of Utah.<eos> I howled at the moon with the prairie coyotes of Kansas.<eos> I fished with the lobstermen of Maine.<eos> I mean, you did all that in a month?<eos> But, look, I'm back now, and I am better than ever.<eos> For the play, and for you.
It's a condition.<eos> And you are an idiot if you don't think about repairing it.<eos> Said gently and carefully, to the man who has a heart condition that can surgically be treated.<eos> God...<eos> A mistake to start a family?<eos> This is such a bad idea.<eos> - Uh, but we'll figure everything out.<eos> - Hello. - Hi.<eos> What can I get you?<eos> Uh, Caesar salad, no dressing, no anchovies.
Oh.<eos> Your mom liked her. Well, you should check it out.<eos> Maybe see if a friend wants to join you for a flick.<eos> There anybody out there you might like to... take to a movie? A friend?<eos> My son is about as subtle as an elephant with gas.<eos> Why don't you tell me some more about this, uh, Ordinary People movie?<eos> Well... it was really moving to see Mary play such a complicated mother...<eos> Tony, Carl, this is my best friend, Jack.<eos> Today's his birthday.<eos> - Oh, happy birthday, man. - Happy birthday!
I also know you get claustrophobic when you're stuck in a place for too long, so I just wanted to come over here and ease your mind, tell you that any second now, the train's gonna start moving, okay?<eos> How's Kate?<eos> Um, good. Good.<eos> Great, actually.<eos> She's great. She's engaged.<eos> - Oh, wow. I know. Great guy, too.<eos> I really like him.<eos> - That's amazing.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, it's good for her.<eos> What about Randall and Rebecca?
Um, good. Good.<eos> Great, actually.<eos> She's great. She's engaged.<eos> - Oh, wow. I know. Great guy, too.<eos> I really like him.<eos> - That's amazing.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, it's good for her.<eos> What about Randall and Rebecca?<eos> Good, you know...<eos> - And Miguel?
Wait, am I insane for wanting to bail?<eos> I-I just don't think it's the right time for surgery.<eos> But...<eos> Damn.<eos> I was excited to lose some serious weight, and quick.<eos> Kate... have you ever considered an immersive weight loss experience?<eos> A fat camp?<eos> There is a incredible facility upstate, in the Adirondacks.<eos> It's a month-long program.<eos> No distractions, no temptations.
It's not that kind of camp.<eos> Are you sure that you're okay with me doing this?<eos> I know this isn't the best timing for us.<eos> Of course I am okay with it.<eos> Kate, we have the rest of our lives to spend together.<eos> Or at least the rest of mine, I had a heart attack at 40, - so I'm going first, obvi.<eos> Look, this is an incredible opportunity, and I want you to do it for yourself.<eos> And Dr. Singh doesn't want me travelling for at least another two weeks so I will just get to know the Big Apple a little bit.<eos> Do you know anyone in the city?<eos> Not a soul.
Oh, you're welcome, fiancée.<eos> - Let's stop doing that.<eos> - Okay, yeah, it was enough.<eos> - Yeah, that was disgusting.<eos> Hey, sorry I'm late.<eos> Family's a little nuts right now.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yeah, yeah, come in, come in.<eos> Randall, do you know Sanjay Jahiri?<eos> Only by reputation.
And I know she would love to meet you.<eos> Dad.<eos> Kate!<eos> How did I not recognize you?<eos> Why didn't somebody tell me that is was Kate?<eos> She looks like Madonna!<eos> Wow. You look so great.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> Sophie's here!<eos> Hey, Kate. Happy birthday.
But it makes me want to Vogue.<eos> But I-I don't know how to Vogue.<eos> Can you show me?<eos> Come on, help your dad out.<eos> Show me how to Vogue.<eos> I-I know you can teach me how to Vogue.<eos> Okay. - Okay, how do I do it?<eos> - Make L's with your hands.<eos> - Like this?<eos> - Oh, this side. - Both, both sides.

Let's see.<eos> Oh, I could take a nap, now!<eos> Did I scare you a little bit there, son?<eos> Man, chill out!<eos> Do you happen to know if you have six fingers on your right hand?<eos> Do you have six fingers on your right hand?<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Waiting!<eos> Okay. No peeking.<eos> Happy birthday, Daddy!
The band booked a five-state tour.<eos> And I think I want to go.<eos> The oncologist estimates he's only got a few more months.<eos> Should we start digging his grave now or should we wait until there's an actual body?<eos> Eight years ago, I was pregnant for the first time, and Randall was vying for partner at his firm and he made sure I didn't lift a finger.<eos> Problem is, he stopped sleeping.<eos> Then one morning, I was in the bathroom, and he called out to me.<eos> He was confused because he couldn't see anything.<eos> He had worked himself into a nervous breakdown.<eos> Happy Valentine's Day. Happy Valentine's Day.
Well, that didn't take long.<eos> You know, uh, for a minute there, you actually convinced me that I was like you.<eos> That deep down, I was just damaged goods.<eos> And then I realized, that's ridiculous.<eos> Do I have issues?<eos> Yes.<eos> But deep down, I'm awesome.<eos> And until you can figure out why you are such a jackass, you're gonna wander this camp miserable and alone till the day that you die.<eos> Probably saying something snarky underneath your breath.<eos> To a horse.
But deep down, I'm awesome.<eos> And until you can figure out why you are such a jackass, you're gonna wander this camp miserable and alone till the day that you die.<eos> Probably saying something snarky underneath your breath.<eos> To a horse.<eos> You ever wonder why I get away with saying whatever the hell I want all day?<eos> It's 'cause my parents, they own this godforsaken place.<eos> Yeah. You're done here.<eos> So, Kevin Pearson, tell me a little bit about yourself.<eos> How did you get started in this business?<eos> Uh, well. Modeling, actually.
- It's fine.<eos> Hey, we'll figure it out.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Okay. I'm gonna go pack a bag.<eos> I'm gonna call the service to send over a nurse for the day.<eos> - I don't need a nurse! - Yes, you do!<eos> End of discussion.<eos> Tess, go get dressed.<eos> - But Ann...<eos> - Also end of discussion.
You're not the only one who can, uh, plan an awkward surprise visit.<eos> - Not funny?<eos> Look, I was a jerk yesterday.<eos> Yeah, you kind of were.<eos> W-well, I'm sorry. I am.<eos> It's just that, you know, between the classes and the therapy,<eos> I've been in this bubble, and you when you showed up it just threw me.<eos> And I'm not making an excuse, it's just what happened.<eos> Oh, I was kicked out.<eos> - Of the camp?
We're, we're talking about getting married this summer and there's still so much that we don't know about each other.<eos> Well, all right, well... if you want know anything, just ask me.<eos> Really?<eos> Let's just, like... you know, dig deep.<eos> Toby and Kate, the deep dive.<eos> Okay. The deep dive.<eos> All right, I'd like that.<eos> Um... But can we do this deep dive at, like, a men's clothing store?<eos> Because now that I know you're not gonna leave me for the Jared Leto of fat camp, I need to get some clothes for your brother's opening tonight.<eos> - Jared Leto? - Yeah.
He thinks he walks on water now because he's having sex with Sophie.<eos> What?<eos> You're having sex?<eos> I disown you. You are de-twinned.<eos> - Kevin... - Hold on.<eos> - No, no, we should have a...<eos> Guys, did you know about this?<eos> Honestly, I just assumed.<eos> I got to work on my paper.<eos> Bye.
- Yeah. - Yeah, she's pretty. - Yeah.<eos> Why don't you send her a drink?<eos> - That's a good idea.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Uh, I'd like to buy that brunette over there her next drink. Oh, and can you tell her it's from Miguel?<eos> No, no, tell her it's from Big M.<eos> No, no, no, tell her it's from Miguel.<eos> - Are we in that much sync?<eos> Good evening.<eos> Happy Valentine's Day, everyone.
It's for the crowd.<eos> I-I think I'm gonna go over there... - unless you need me. Do you need me?<eos> - No, go.<eos> Kevin.<eos> Hi. Hey, Miguel.<eos> Is, uh, my mom around by chance?<eos> No, no, she's out shopping.<eos> Do you want to come in?<eos> So, you're excited?<eos> Excited about tonight?
Listen to me.<eos> The only thing anyone expects you to do is to plan a service.<eos> You already did that.<eos> Like I said, show up for the service, be with your family, think of him dearly, and...<eos> You're gonna want to read this.<eos> Hi. Uh, it's Kevin Pearson calling.<eos> I was calling to see if Brandon Novak was getting my voicemails, because I've left quite a few of 'em, and he...<eos> She hung up on me.<eos> What, that theater critic's assistant? Well, not that theater critic.<eos> The theater critic.

Kitchen, please.<eos> How could you be late today, of all days?<eos> - Is Ben here yet? - No.<eos> Then I guess I'm not late.<eos> Well, you said you'd be home at 5:30.<eos> No, I said I would knock off at 5:30.<eos> I called your office and you didn't.<eos> So, you're checking up on me now?<eos> This is just passive-aggressive, Jack.<eos> - Okay, the kids. - Yeah.
He did.<eos> I'm not the guy to tell you how to handle your feelings.<eos> But I've learned that you got to let 'em out.<eos> You got to share them with the people that love you. I know.<eos> Do you?<eos> 'Cause there's a really sweet, really big guy in my living room right now who might think otherwise.<eos> I know.<eos> Where's the family tonight?<eos> Kids are with their friends and wife is out of town.<eos> In Cleveland.
Go back to sleep.<eos> You take care of him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Take good care of you, too.<eos> I'll send you a postcard.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> All right, don't drive too fast, okay?<eos> We gonna do this old school, sir.<eos> Jersey to Memphis...

It's all right. I asked you a question.<eos> - Where's my wife?<eos> - I don't know. She was... she was just in the dressing room.<eos> - I'm going to go find her.<eos> - No, no, no, no. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, Jack.<eos> - Don't touch me. - Jack, buddy, buddy...<eos> - Don't touch me. - Okay, you're drunk.<eos> - Don't touch me. All right?<eos> All right? This is... this is a big night for us.<eos> Oh, "for us"?
We deserve to catch a break.<eos> Um... Jack and Darryl, friends of Alex.<eos> Hey, Alex.<eos> You boys want a drink?<eos> - Oh, um, I'll have a beer.<eos> - Two club sodas.<eos> Welcome, gentlemen.<eos> Game's five-card draw.<eos> Ten dollar ante.<eos> No limits.
Oh. How about I talk to them. Hmm?<eos> I'll tell them... You seem better to me.<eos> How is it?<eos> Sorry.

Detective Murphy, CPD.<eos> Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?<eos> ... The immigrants come in...<eos> Stop!<eos> Gideon, move!<eos> Damn it!<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's just my ankle.<eos> We lost him.<eos> Well... not entirely.
I'm coming.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> Fire department's a ways out, at least another eight, ten minutes.<eos> I'll be there in two, tops.<eos> What the hell's a drone gonna do?<eos> This is not an ordinary drone.<eos> This is the TK421.<eos> This one uses a concussive charge to extinguish flames.<eos> You're gonna blow up the fire?<eos> Murph.
Thanks, brother.<eos> You talk to him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry I was such a jerk.<eos> Listen, I know he's your buddy, and...<eos> Yeah, but you're my partner.<eos> Next time I'll listen.<eos> Needs more sugar.<eos> In light of Johnson's arrest, the gang conflict that has plagued the 13th district is rumored to be nearing a truce.<eos> Leaders from both sides...
Esteemed surgeon by day, killer by night.<eos> How do you know so much about me?<eos> I know things about you that you don't even know about yourself.<eos> Like the fact that you have a son.<eos> I can assure you I do not have a son.<eos> Henry Ayers...<eos> Born to Pauline Ayers, a nurse you met in 1891 in Paris.<eos> Do you remember her?<eos> I want to conduct some tests.<eos> Nothing too invasive.
I want you to start thinking of me as a friend.<eos> With a little extra.<eos> You know, there's a crazy killer on every corner today, Brooke.<eos> Why me?<eos> Because there's only one Jack the Ripper.<eos> Were you able to find out anything about the coordinates from Chad's apartment?<eos> Yes and no.<eos> The longitude and latitude takes us here to a residential area of Glen Cove, Long Island.<eos> These next numbers appear to be a date...<eos> September 15, 1980.
Vanessa.<eos> Yes. We're at her parents' house.<eos> What does Chad have to do with Vanessa's family?<eos> Why would he want to come here? Well, the man wanted me dead, and Vanessa and her parents are my descendants.<eos> Maybe they were his targets, too.<eos> In 1980?<eos> We'll have a look around, see what we find.<eos> Wait.<eos> Let's make you a yuppie.<eos> A yuppie?
I'll be right back. Who's that man?<eos> Jane, that satchel.<eos> It was in Chad's apartment.<eos> Radical gene therapy fails when the brain rejects the new DNA.<eos> It doesn't want to change, but my father discovered a better method, and I've perfected it.<eos> And once this new DNA is inside the brain, you can manipulate the chemistry in the brain to control how people think?<eos> You're catching on.<eos> Do you want to study me or change me?<eos> Don't you want to change?<eos> Not in the least.
Don't you look lovely.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, you know me.<eos> I hate to miss a party.<eos> You want the time machine.<eos> You know me so well.<eos> But as I'm sure you're aware, it's behind lock and key.<eos> So, tell me, Jane.<eos> How many people do I have to hurt to get into that room?<eos> None.
So, tell me, Jane.<eos> How many people do I have to hurt to get into that room?<eos> None.<eos> Because I have the key right here.<eos> Marvelous.<eos> It's John!<eos> He's here!<eos> We have a breach.<eos> Somebody help!<eos> Help!

Mortua est quam mortuum.<eos> I'm sure they just wanted to keep the meeting small.<eos> Howard is the funniest man I've ever met.<eos> I learned more in that one meeting than in eight years of high school.<eos> Great. - Wow!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> It's like a clown car.<eos> Oh, my God, Josh.<eos> I finally feel like my dad has a shot.<eos> - No offense.
- No offense.<eos> You're great.<eos> - No.<eos> But Howard...<eos> I will not be intimidated by your boss.<eos> You may think you have a leg up on me, but trust me, I decide when my legs are up and for whom they are up.<eos> I believe in the justice system and I know that Mr. Henderson is looking forward to putting this behind him and getting on with his life.<eos> No, no further questions.<eos> I will take one more question.<eos> No comment.
Howard, we have the evidence.<eos> We have four viable suspects.<eos> Jeremiah Davis employs 60% of the people in this town.<eos> And Josie?<eos> A woman of such small stature could never possibly inflict such wounds.<eos> And Rutger Hiss?<eos> Pinning anything on a cop is extremely risky.<eos> What about the cable guy, Roger Bentman?<eos> He was at the house right before Margaret died.<eos> No motive, no prints.

I think I saved it.<eos> Damn, that's catchy.<eos> All right. Let's get to it.<eos> Would the defendant like to enter a plea?<eos> I guess so.<eos> Larry, you need to trust me on this.<eos> Don't do it, Larry.<eos> I need this, you [bleep]<eos> I plead... not guilty!<eos> By reason of...
Any sexual assault?<eos> None.<eos> Home invasion victims are often blitz attacked. But not here.<eos> No defensive wounds, no blunt-force trauma.<eos> Then the unsubs likely used the gun to control them.<eos> Ligature marks on the wrists, not overly abrasive.<eos> What was used?<eos> Household items.<eos> Janelle Klecker, a man's tie.<eos> Probably her husband's.
Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Please!<eos> Now we can go.<eos> We gotta split.<eos> All 3 of us.<eos> And go where?<eos> I don't know. Who cares?<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> Without Zeke?
She's been like a sister to us.<eos> Did you see her face?<eos> She liked it.<eos> No mayo, right, Kay?<eos> Something wrong?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Ok.<eos> Victims are Claire and Joe Vendl, with two adult children.<eos> Neither live at home.<eos> And no pets.
Expelled from each one of them, I presume? Uh-huh.<eos> But each time she got expelled, she would consistently get admitted into a new school because her parents would make a hefty financial contribution to the new school.<eos> What are they like?<eos> They're maddeningly, maddeningly normal.<eos> And according all things Michelle and Paul Adams, they're loving, indulgent parents.<eos> She has a younger sister Kendra, who works at the family's real estate firm.<eos> Oh, sweet Christmas.<eos> Ok, the dad just recently updated his Facebook family picture.<eos> It's him, his wife, and the daughter Kendra.<eos> No sign of Bethany, not even a shoutout.
- Xylda said I should hide here.<eos> - Gypsy Xylda?<eos> - You know my grandma?<eos> Olivia, you seem angry.<eos> I can take some of that from you.<eos> - What are you exactly?<eos> - Vampires run red for it.<eos> Supernatural evil is being drawn here.<eos> The more that evil takes hold, the more the veil frays.<eos> - Damn.

Lem always had good taste in women.<eos> Well, you guys all have a lot of catching up to do.<eos> I feel a migraine coming on.<eos> You don't have a migraine, do you?<eos> You guys have fun.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> When they're gone.<eos> See you in the morning. Wait, I won't.<eos> Olivia.<eos> What?
Most of that time, Zach was by my side.<eos> Well... look who's here.<eos> I had to make an example out of Abraham.<eos> You cost me, boy.<eos> Now I own you.<eos> My God! Dinner's not over.<eos> Feel better?<eos> Yeah. Much better.<eos> All vampires are killers.<eos> - Except for Lem?
The veil that Midnight sits upon...<eos> It's fraying... and evil is being drawn here.<eos> You've felt it, haven't you?<eos> Last time I turned, the hunger was insatiable.<eos> - So what do we do about this?<eos> - There's no we.<eos> Chuy and I may not be here much longer.<eos> And after we're gone, someone needs to know the truth, 'cause there will come a time when Midnighters are gonna have to make a choice...<eos> To leave or to fight.<eos> A pencil?
Poor Henry.<eos> At least we're safe.<eos> My house is inhospitable to the dead.<eos> It's why I never invite Lem for dinner.<eos> Hey, we need to be ready.<eos> Go on offense.<eos> There's a lot of vampires.<eos> We need more than crossbows and stakes.<eos> We need... targeted weapons.<eos> What, like supernatural weapons?
For old times' sake.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Right.<eos> To old friends.<eos> - I'll miss you, Zach.<eos> - I'll miss you.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> Zach's reminding Lem who he is.<eos> Blood's thicker than water.<eos> Yeah, safe travels.
Good.<eos> I'll be waiting. Mhm.<eos> The other night... It never happened.<eos> Heidi saw us.<eos> What does she know?<eos> Her body won't be found.<eos> I told you. We keep you clean.<eos> I have your word that you'll deliver voigt?<eos> As long as sinclair. Holds up his end of our agreement.<eos> What agreement?
I see.<eos> They'd like to have a moment of your time. So you can fill in a few details.<eos> Surely, this can wait until after the gala tonight.<eos> This won't take long.<eos> I'm sure it's just a formality.<eos> So it comes down to faber keeping his word? Delivering voigt?<eos> Yeah. He says he will.<eos> As long as we keep him clean.<eos> As long as you keep your side of the bargain.<eos> What bargain?
No, wait, sorry.<eos> That's the main hall.<eos> This one.<eos> You're sure?<eos> Positive. When is the delivery staff expected?<eos> A little over an hour.<eos> Does that leave you.<eos> Enough time for...?<eos> Ample. Because I can't have anyone walking in and seeing.<eos> Unaccredited individuals.
Are you going after himmler?<eos> They'll come straight to me.<eos> They'll come knocking at my door.<eos> And I tell you, I'll break, I'll tell them everything.<eos> I'm not a hero!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You need to leave now!<eos> Even if you report us, you won't be spared.<eos> You've helped us in the past; You're already.<eos> Guilty of treason.
Well, we have to wait for the coroner, but clearly her genitalia and reproductive organs have been mutilated.<eos> Her vocal chords, too.<eos> She looks to be about late 40s, early 50s.<eos> That tracks. I mean, all of his victims are right around his age.<eos> And he buried her, too.<eos> So if he sticks to his pattern, he'll most likely go after another woman soon.<eos> He usually kills in twos, right?<eos> So nothing's changed.<eos> His M.O.'s exactly the same.<eos> Well, not exactly.
No. Jody has always been sweet.<eos> Had her mood changed recently?<eos> Yes, she was happy lately.<eos> Lately?<eos> Was she not usually happy?<eos> Well, Jody's not the outgoing type.<eos> She never had very many friends.<eos> She never got married.<eos> A few months ago she met someone.<eos> Who?

Hello, ladies.<eos> Welcome to the party.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You guys are here.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> That is a real Lichtenstein.<eos> Couch made by Picasso.<eos> That one I... I made up.<eos> The bowls are made of crystal.<eos> Real crystal, not like my mom's glass,
Do you see any baggies?<eos> - No, there's gotta be a... - Ahem.<eos> Hey!<eos> What?<eos> No, we're not molesting your robot.<eos> - What?<eos> - It kissed me, I didn't kiss it.<eos> I got something even better for you to fondle.<eos> - Who likes glittery things?<eos> - Holy shit.
I am raising a baby with someone I can't even talk to.<eos> And if I leave him, where do I live?<eos> Do I live here with you?<eos> Why am I feeling guilty about leaving that asshole?<eos> And he's...<eos> What's the word?<eos> Stupid.<eos> He is so stupid.<eos> Flor... when you cheat on your wife... don't admit everything to her.<eos> Lie.
Stupid.<eos> He is so stupid.<eos> Flor... when you cheat on your wife... don't admit everything to her.<eos> Lie.<eos> Lie to her, Flor.<eos> Flor, I'm gonna sit down on the floor.<eos> I feel like I'm losing my mind every 20 minutes.<eos> Twenty minutes is... about as long as I can possibly pretend that everything's okay.<eos> And I don't have anybody to talk to about it.<eos> Except you.
- "I am woman, hear me roar," right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was exhilarating being in a hotel room with this guy for 48 hours.<eos> - Separate rooms, for the record.<eos> - Point is we escaped to a private villa, we did a ton of blow, and we figured out everything.<eos> Not everything, but a lot.<eos> We're moving all of you into a hotel.<eos> Oh!<eos> - What? - In Palm Springs?
Look, we learned a valuable lesson over the weekend.<eos> Cloistering yourself up like some 17th-century monk makes you way more fucking productive and helps you focus.<eos> - Like Olympic Village?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Or rehab.<eos> Probably more like rehab.<eos> Rehab is expensive, dude.<eos> No, no, no. It's free. I forgot to mention that.<eos> Yeah. So we're talking free housing, free cable, free commute, 'cause it's close to here... free pool!<eos> - But in, like, Van Nuys.

Is this required or can we live at home and commute?<eos> Yeah, some of us have lives, husbands.<eos> Sorry, no exceptions.<eos> Oh. Except Debbie, because she's the star, and she has a baby.<eos> - Bullshit!
Yeah, with Meemaw and Ron.<eos> - Keith Bang.<eos> - Where's the beef?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - We've been wondering, sir, exactly where you've been putting your beef.<eos> - Got blood alcohol levels?<eos> - Phil's checking them.<eos> - Hellmann's Mayonnaise.<eos> Can you take a survey? - A survey?<eos> - Yes, yes.

You have AIDS... in your butt.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I was just in my really good friends Dawn and Stacey's room, and suddenly, out of nowhere, I started bleeding right out of my butt.<eos> And the only way I could get it to stop was by shoving both of their toothbrushes into my anus!<eos> Get a life, you fucking hags!<eos> How does everyone know my fucking real name?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - My hair. - For who?<eos> For me.
I can't order more pizza, I'm out of cash until next Friday.<eos> Good thing he wrote his number on the box.<eos> Do you think he actually wants me to call him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - More! More! More!<eos> Ruth.<eos> Up here.<eos> You wanna take a field trip?<eos> Guess all that extra work paid off, huh?<eos> - For her, anyway.
I'm Carmen, Tom and Kurt's little sister.<eos> Oh, right. Sure.<eos> We just wanted to come back and tell you how amazing that was.<eos> - Um, these are my friends. Melanie...<eos> - Melrose.<eos> Melrose. Hi, it's a pleasure.<eos> - And Debbie.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You're Laura Morgan.<eos> - From Paradise Cove. - Oh, yeah.
She's a big girl, and good personality.<eos> I need to learn more about being Russian, and you're the only Russian I know.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> And I have to be going.<eos> - Can I come with you?<eos> - It's a family function.<eos> Families love me.<eos> Look.<eos> I really wanna be an authentic representation, not some cartoon Russian villain.<eos> Out of respect for your culture.
You've had a very rough day. So, picture me in a little cap and glasses, okay, pretending to be a man.<eos> - Who is this girl, huh? - Ahem.<eos> Can't fight me if you can't catch me!<eos> Infidel!<eos> Nope.<eos> Come on, you... You rabid dog.<eos> You mangy mutt.<eos> You wanna bite me?<eos> You wanna bite me?<eos> Help!
Oh, my God!<eos> Not this again.<eos> Please.<eos> Babies are boring.<eos> I mean, they don't party, they haven't traveled, they have no sense of irony.<eos> And you love this shit.<eos> You love being a temperamental star.<eos> I know you do.<eos> If you were at home with that kid, your life would become just anger and resentment.<eos> No work, no husband.
- What? !<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'mma call every match for you.<eos> I only have one, and it's a tag-team match.<eos> I don't get my own fight.<eos> So, so, so?<eos> You will shine, no matter how many people are in that ring, okay?<eos> Just, you know, add a little extra something-something.<eos> - A little something?<eos> - Yeah, like a little...
I gotta figure out a couple of things.<eos> And now the moment you've been waiting for.<eos> The final match of the night.<eos> You're gonna be great.<eos> Introducing...<eos> Liberty Belle.<eos> Stop it.<eos> USA! USA! USA!<eos> I'd like to call on the power of my three favorite Americans:<eos> Ronald Reagan, Larry Bird and Jesus Christ himself.
And now the moment you've been waiting for.<eos> The final match of the night.<eos> You're gonna be great.<eos> Introducing...<eos> Liberty Belle.<eos> Stop it.<eos> USA! USA! USA!<eos> I'd like to call on the power of my three favorite Americans:<eos> Ronald Reagan, Larry Bird and Jesus Christ himself.<eos> And straight from Moscow.
You've lost, Zoya.<eos> Americans will never give up their freedom!<eos> Capitalist pig!<eos> I will neuter all your pet dogs and fill your swimming pools with borscht!<eos> One last time.<eos> Defect or die.<eos> Prepare yourself for mutually-assured destruction!<eos> All right, ladies...<eos> I want a good clean fight, all right?<eos> No dirty business, no funny business.

Come on!<eos> Get back in there!<eos> Classic American!<eos> You run away. Bye-bye.<eos> This is insane.<eos> It's fucking insane.<eos> It's not insane.<eos> It's a job.<eos> I mean, you won't even talk to me.<eos> But Ruth?
- Well, do what you gotta do, but... yeah, probably.<eos> Okay, this is bullshit, Sam.<eos> We've all worked really hard.<eos> I don't even talk to my dad anymore. That's how bad I wanna do this.<eos> Do you guys know how many plays I've done with no budget, where we've had to build every prop, every piece of scenery?<eos> I did a version of Peter Pan where we couldn't afford a flying rig, so two stage hands carried me around for three hours.<eos> - How much do we need? - Yeah.<eos> $9,000.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - Shit.
For the fig juice.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, I'll be right back.<eos> I'm just gonna go get a soda.<eos> So, that's the guy?<eos> In the Beemer right there?<eos> Yep.<eos> Not what I expected.<eos> You were expecting what?<eos> Sean Penn?
Okay.<eos> Um, I'll be right back.<eos> I'm just gonna go get a soda.<eos> So, that's the guy?<eos> In the Beemer right there?<eos> Yep.<eos> Not what I expected.<eos> You were expecting what?<eos> Sean Penn?<eos> No, just someone less like a giant Cabbage Patch Kid.
Bash said to look conservative.<eos> We didn't have a lot of options.<eos> Hey, Gary.<eos> What a turnout tonight, huh?<eos> I'm sorry, Sebastian, you're on the list plus one, not 20.<eos> No, no, no. These are the... the girls. The former drug addicts?<eos> - From WAD?<eos> - What? WAD?<eos> Uh, WAD.<eos> Wrestlers Against Drugs.
Thanks?<eos> - Can I talk to you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Just join my, uh... my pity party.<eos> I'd like to toast my mother for organizing all this.<eos> Ah. Before I bring her up here, I'd like to bring up some other powerful, equally admirable women.<eos> Women who have struggled with drug addiction.<eos> Women who have found that showing up at a gym every day to learn how to wrestle has kept them sober.<eos> These are the women of WAD.<eos> Wrestlers Against Drugs.
Killian?<eos> Don't worry, Princess.<eos> I'm here to rescue you.<eos> After I kill whoever the blazes this is.<eos> Lonely here, isn't it?<eos> If you're here to talk me off my path, you can't.<eos> This is my fate.<eos> Well, fate's a tricky business.<eos> It still requires work.<eos> And planning.
Frankly, I suppose I'm addicted to it, but I don't want it for my son.<eos> I protected him, even knowing what he wanted to do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It can be easy to rationalize doing the wrong thing, can't it?<eos> Indeed it can.<eos> Is it too late for us to help him?<eos> You must have some plan, some trick.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But if there is anything we can do to help him, perhaps that's something we should do together.<eos> Not just for us, but for everyone.
No one knows me, no one trusts me.<eos> My record says that I'm in for theft or worse.<eos> So who's gonna listen to me when I'm yelling that there's been some horrible mix-up?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Nobody listens.<eos> I never get my hair done. My teeth go bad.<eos> I die in here.<eos> That can't happen, right?<eos> Just don't lose your badge!<eos> Badges.
Here we are.<eos> Uh, w-what's K-10?<eos> K-10 is for especially dangerous inmates, murderers, validated gang members.<eos> Which is she?<eos> That's confidential.<eos> She's a minor.<eos> It means she can't circulate freely with other inmates... for their safety.<eos> What about our safety? - She behaves for me.<eos> - We're fine.<eos> Rochester.
You'll live.<eos> You're gonna be like that?<eos> I am.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Kristen, we're gonna take a look at your baby. How's that sound?<eos> Inmate, away from the door.<eos> Hi, Kristen. Good to see you.<eos> We can get you access to supplies.<eos> Backup in Cell 7!<eos> Inmate!
Okay, then.<eos> Kristen, we're gonna take a look at your baby. How's that sound?<eos> Inmate, away from the door.<eos> Hi, Kristen. Good to see you.<eos> We can get you access to supplies.<eos> Backup in Cell 7!<eos> Inmate!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Hey!<eos> No excessive force!
But... can't right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're all set.<eos> Okay, Mama, you ready to take a look at this baby?<eos> Does she always talk like that?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Like what?<eos> Like unicorns and rainbows are about to shoot out of your ass.<eos> Okay. - All right, let's... - Hey, hey, hey!<eos> No sudden moves!
Such a bitch.<eos> All right, Wilson, continue with the cephalic version?<eos> Yes. Absolutely.<eos> Thank you Dr. Robbins.<eos> "Thank you, Dr. Robbins."<eos> You have to kiss her ass, huh?<eos> Hey! Are you a doctor?<eos> I need help.<eos> Yes, you!<eos> Help!
Do you want to know what I'm gonna name her?<eos> Sure.<eos> Ellie.<eos> Ellie? I love that.<eos> If you tell anyone I said all that crap, I'll kill you.<eos> Hey, I just ID'd an abscess without packing it or using antibiotics.<eos> Oh, good. You're treating my patients at random.<eos> I know this place looks like a shanty town to you, but we do actually keep records here, charts.<eos> Hey, you know what you don't keep?<eos> Basic gauze!
A dozen women need sanitary napkins.<eos> Good news... I got 35 for the whole week.<eos> So who gets and who doesn't?<eos> I see.<eos> Seriously... make a decision, Chief.<eos> I understand.<eos> I get it. I don't allocate my resources.<eos> The state does. And when the state decides between cutting the school budgets or the prisons, guess which one they pick.<eos> So then I get to pick.<eos> From this.
DCFS's job is to protect these kids.<eos> After everything Louie's been put through we're just... baby.<eos> Tina...<eos> We need your help, okay?<eos> The whole thing seems pretty shady.<eos> What kind of person waits three years to contact his child?<eos> We'll reach out to him right away.<eos> Try to get to the bottom of this.<eos> In the meantime, let's keep our heads.<eos> For Louie's sake.
- doesn't work...<eos> - Hey, I'm a firefighter.<eos> I help people every day.<eos> Some make it, some don't.<eos> I'm just saying, a little anonymity can be nice right now.<eos> Besides, she needs bone marrow... Not a new friend.<eos> What is this?<eos> One man's trash is another man's treasure.<eos> No, you are not bringing some dumpster-picked thing<eos> - into my firehouse.
I don't want to hear it!<eos> This is a workplace.<eos> We do a serious job here.<eos> And you guys are acting like a bunch of idiots!<eos> Somebody fix that damn door!<eos> Sorry, Lieutenant.<eos> Hey, Lieutenant, you wait a sec?<eos> Listen, on behalf of those knuckleheads back in that room, I apologize.<eos> I might've overreacted a little.<eos> Any particular reason?
- Yeah.<eos> - Hey. - Where is he?<eos> No sign of him.<eos> I've been trying to get ahold of him all day and he hasn't gotten back to me.<eos> - God, this is bad.<eos> - All right.<eos> Hey. Looks like a hit and run?<eos> I ran the tag.<eos> Mustang belongs to a Kelly...<eos> Severide.

You're back in your body, in the moment.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Not like this.<eos> In rows.<eos> There we are.<eos> And then take a deep breath.<eos> Now try to see it from the outside. Find some distance.<eos> Okay.<eos> Stand still.<eos> Yeah. - Hey, no cheating.
Stand still.<eos> Yeah. - Hey, no cheating.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> - You're right here.<eos> - That's your mother?<eos> Not there.<eos> - Well, I've grown a lot. - Yeah.<eos> We live in the country.<eos> Upstate, there's no...<eos> light pollution.
It helps.<eos> First time is always the worst in memory work.<eos> Your girlfriend threw up.<eos> She's in with Melanie doing talk work.<eos> That's the deal... you do memory work with me, you got to do talk work with Dr. Bird, figure out what it all means.<eos> Melanie thinks you're the key.<eos> What?<eos> The key to what?<eos> Winning the war.<eos> And other things.
Then he was never good with facts and, like, dates and stuff.<eos> Used to... snap his fingers at me when he forgot my name... which is funny, 'cause I remember everything.<eos> What do you mean "everything"?<eos> Like, I remember my birth...<eos> before, even, the womb.<eos> You know how loud the heartbeat is?<eos> Imagine you could remember being inside your mother's body, warm and blind, and then just this intense pressure, and suddenly...<eos> Light.<eos> Tell me about the book.<eos> What book?
Onion.<eos> No, "onion."<eos> - Santa.<eos> - Are you talking to me?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Alaska.<eos> No, you don't play like this. Shh!<eos> I talk to myself sometimes, too.<eos> Well, not myself.
No, "onion."<eos> - Santa.<eos> - Are you talking to me?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Alaska.<eos> No, you don't play like this. Shh!<eos> I talk to myself sometimes, too.<eos> Well, not myself.<eos> The... the voices.
Maybe... you and Philly...<eos> I know she's nice, though... you know?<eos> I think she... she gets you.<eos> No, that's... that's... that's dumb.<eos> - I'm... That's not gonna... - Well...<eos> Why can't you have what... what everyone else has... a nice home, a family?<eos> Because I'm sick.<eos> The point of a stove being what?<eos> Like its function?<eos> To me.
Last time, you used the word "vapor."<eos> I looked it up. There's a new drug...<eos> No. I don't.<eos> The pills... the prescription.<eos> I'm clean.<eos> 10 or 11.<eos> You said the visions started.<eos> What do you remember most about those years?<eos> Andromeda...<eos> Cassiopeia...
So she reached into her purse, removed a cloth, and washed my face.<eos> And... it was a miracle.<eos> To be touched when... you feel so untouchable.<eos> It was the first time in my life I wanted to live.<eos> And now, thanks to you... I just might.<eos> I know you don't believe what Gloria's saying, that this is all part of God's plan.<eos> But I see in you the same light that I see in her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Help!
So I want to make it clear that I never considered this a competition.<eos> I love Robbie and he'll make a wonderful king one day, but that day is not today.<eos> I am the leader of this nation.<eos> And when my dear, departed brother Simon... ..was taken from us, even Queen Helena supported my reign over her own son's.<eos> She knows it's true.<eos> 'It's all my fault.'<eos> I helped Cyrus change the course of history and not for the better.<eos> What were you looking for when you made that pact?<eos> What did you need from him?<eos> Control.
Which is completely out of your hands.<eos> Go.<eos> Hm. Go!<eos> Psst! For God's sake!<eos> Inappropriate!<eos> I need your help.<eos> It seems you're running out of lives, Mr. Whiskers.<eos> I gave some confidential information to a reporter.<eos> About what?<eos> Robert's plane crash.
I know the way out.<eos> Tell Sara Alice I said goodbye.<eos> I'm gonna miss her.<eos> Before I speak, I think... It's only fair to give my siblings to voice their support or concerns.<eos> So I humbly defer to my brother,<eos> His Royal Highness Prince Liam, whose opinion matters to me immensely, as it should to you too.<eos> Prince Liam, as your brother has suggested, would you like to share with us your perspective on these proceedings?<eos> Cyrus?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Nothing.
I don't do them much these days, I just keep them around in case of emergency, or if guests pop in, obviously.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> No. I've got a shipment coming in from Morocco soon.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Oh, do you?<eos> So, I want to talk to you about my latest project.<eos> My family owns quite a bit of coastal real estate all over the world.<eos> Most of these properties are empty and a bit faded, so I plan to restyle and rebrand them as boutique hotels.<eos> Like the Chateau Marmont's way cooler little brother.<eos> - Ooh, or little sister.

Jasper? If those bells chime at midnight, you're back in the game.<eos> I promised myself I wouldn't covet things.<eos> If I survived, if I was rescued, I would be thankful for everything that I have and have had.<eos> The truth is... my time away made me a better person.<eos> When you're surrounded by silence for the first time in your life, you learn to appreciate the life you once had, the people that you may have once taken for granted.<eos> So I consider my time on the island a blessing, not a tragedy.<eos> My only wish is that I had found my way home before my father was killed.<eos> But let's not dwell on the past.<eos> Let's use this opportunity to focus on the goodness that is England.<eos> Glorious, noble England.
These D3 patsies aren't gonna know what hit 'em, but we have to go now and we have to move fast.<eos> Just promise me we'll come back here when we have her.<eos> Mon frre, I love it here.<eos> All these shinny happy people.<eos> Time to go.<eos> It's a facility in the woods, so we have to go in on the ground.<eos> By which I mean, we definitely should not go in on the ground.<eos> That'd be dumb.<eos> He's gone.<eos> - Who?
He's gone.<eos> - Who?<eos> - David.<eos> He...<eos> I heard voices, looked for him everywhere.<eos> He's not here.<eos> Think he went to D3. Shit.<eos> Wake everyone.<eos> We're going?<eos> To Division Three? Now?
And living inside David for... 30 years.<eos> Thank God.<eos> We were just... are you okay?<eos> Not like this.<eos> It knows.<eos> Come on, boy.<eos> What is it?<eos> He's home.<eos> He went home. David.<eos> Summerland?
My boy.<eos> My beautiful boy.<eos> David, wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Odd.<eos> Extremely.<eos> He's gonna wake up, right?<eos> There's no medical reason David's unconscious, if that's what he is.<eos> Andromeda.<eos> Cassiopeia.
- What did the stars say?<eos> - What?<eos> Dr. Poole asked David, "What did the stars say?"<eos> And I saw him when we were in his mind, just before the monster came.<eos> I saw him, like a flash.<eos> He had... he was stuffing tape into his mouth, audio tape.<eos> And his hands were...<eos> - Are you saying...<eos> - Glitches.<eos> Omissions.
Doctor.<eos> We didn't have a dog.<eos> If you come with me, you are gonna see things.<eos> You will not feel the same about me.<eos> Cary called.<eos> They found an address for Philly.<eos> Hey, Syd.<eos> Syd!<eos> Cary called, found an address for the girlfriend.<eos> Ex-girlfriend.
Don't worry.<eos> We'll get the facts.<eos> It's just a risk we'll have to take.<eos> A diving suit.<eos> You sure?<eos> It's not just coincidence with David gone.<eos> Maybe he's waking up. Maybe, but don't get your hopes up.<eos> We've been wrong before.<eos> Do you miss her?<eos> Kerry?
I forget the word. What's the word?<eos> I've been here a long time, and things tend to, uh... drift.<eos> Right.<eos> And here is...<eos> See, I would... they gave me a shot, a sedative for the memory work, and when I woke up, I was...<eos> Unless I'm not really awake.<eos> Maybe this is the drug.<eos> Tell me something. Do they still, uh... Is free love still a thing?<eos> Uh, girls in summer dresses with no bra?<eos> Y... not really.
Until what? Osteoporosis?<eos> You really want to grow old in a mental hospital?<eos> surrounded by...<eos> What? The other freaks?<eos> Maybe we should. Maybe we belong here.<eos> she says the grind of it.<eos> And me with my sensitivity... the grounding.<eos> I-I'm good.<eos> I can't stay here.<eos> Not even for me?
Geodon.<eos> We're exercising our minds.<eos> I see that.<eos> Sorry. I didn't sleep well.<eos> Cary: Is it the dream again?<eos> I'm in a room that's not a room...<eos> Full of people I can't see.<eos> like we're already dead.<eos> -Yeah. a lemonade.<eos> Clozapine.
We're connected, kid.<eos> You, David, me.<eos> It's your fault.<eos> When you were in his head, I was in yours.<eos> And I may not be on his frequency right now, but you can hear me just fine, can't you?<eos> Stop.<eos> My mother died a few years back.<eos> Cancer.<eos> She tried all the things.<eos> Chemo, radiation, surgery.
- My wife?<eos> Is she... for some reason I wanna say... Chinese?<eos> - No, she's not Chinese.<eos> - Got it. Japanese?<eos> No, not Asian in any way.<eos> Hm. Good to know.<eos> I've been in here a long time, you see.<eos> Or at least, I think I have.<eos> Hours... or, what's longer than hours?<eos> Years.
I've been in here a long time, you see.<eos> Or at least, I think I have.<eos> Hours... or, what's longer than hours?<eos> Years.<eos> My memory's a bit, um... it's a bit, uh...<eos> Oh, what's the word?<eos> What's the word?<eos> Dishes?<eos> No. Anyhow, I supposed we'd better rescue them, then.<eos> Your friends.
"Roll out the Barrel," that kind of thing.<eos> Nothing serious.<eos> Just fun. Oh, which reminds me.<eos> You know what it is, don't you?<eos> I'm sorry. Having a little trouble keeping up.<eos> - What...<eos> - The monster.<eos> You know what it is.<eos> Or should I say who?<eos> Farouk.
Just fun. Oh, which reminds me.<eos> You know what it is, don't you?<eos> I'm sorry. Having a little trouble keeping up.<eos> - What...<eos> - The monster.<eos> You know what it is.<eos> Or should I say who?<eos> Farouk.<eos> I read David's mind, you see, when they were trapped here.<eos> He and David.
I won. - Give me some sugar."<eos> - Is that... is that supposed to be a-a British accent?<eos> And there's me.<eos> I'm born.<eos> And he... they... somehow, they decided to give me away, right?<eos> I mean, did they know?<eos> Or maybe it wasn't...<eos> Maybe it wasn't about the monster.<eos> Maybe they just didn't want me.<eos> Oh, boohoo.
I'm sure.<eos> Don't imagine you've got any smokes on you.<eos> Of course not.<eos> You're on the way out.<eos> Aren't we all?<eos> Not all destined for the same place.<eos> The knife that Aaron used on Patricia came from her kitchen... but it might as well have been this one here.<eos> Now...<eos> Reverend. This one's tasted blood too, I imagine.<eos> Aaron's?
Fuck off.<eos> And then Christ arrived here, too.<eos> Sent for us... to seek and save the lost.<eos> John... given all you know now... what you've seen... anyone taken to be a messiah... could only have been one of us.<eos> And that night... in front of the crowd... you were right...<eos> I am the Devil... every bit as much as I am God... and every ramshackle deity in between.<eos> Excuse me. Is this the Barnes' place?<eos> That's what the mailbox says.<eos> Is Kyle Barnes here?<eos> Or Reverend Anderson?
And those that do, tell 'em if they're afraid, they can come out here.<eos> That way I can get to 'em quick if something happens.<eos> Such fucking hypocrites.<eos> Man of God, caring for his human flock.<eos> And you, Kyle... trying so hard to stop the Merge.<eos> Look at the people around you.<eos> The vicious, scheming, deplorable monsters born here, raised here.<eos> This man I merged with... he's a blight.<eos> He had an appetite for... taking lives.<eos> Young lives.
Now, I would think, Sydney, more than anybody, would be mindful not to waste time chasing fantasies.<eos> Caldwell saw Helen's work firsthand.<eos> The way she was able to change the beacons.<eos> She almost brought on the Merge.<eos> How?<eos> I'm working on that.<eos> We need to locate that survivor.<eos> I hope you're close.<eos> You know, kids my age don't have a lot of patience.<eos> Tea?
This is how it starts, isn't it?<eos> This ain't that.<eos> Mm. But you called Kyle though.<eos> I was just taking a precaution.<eos> Well, so am I.<eos> Top drawer of the bureau, my silk scarves are in there.<eos> I'm not gonna tie you up.<eos> Byron, you told me yourself, people lose control.<eos> Please, Byron.<eos> For me.
I love you so much. I love you, baby. Come on.<eos> Come on, we gonna... We gonna do this.<eos> Breathe. I am gonna save you.<eos> You didn't have to do this. Rosie.<eos> You didn't have to do it.<eos> Allison! The... Allison?<eos> Allison? Amber?<eos> Girls?<eos> Chief!<eos> Chief.
Yes!<eos> Ah, that's it!<eos> That's the quote!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Okay, it's tape 14.<eos> Take it to Josh.<eos> If I hurry, I can still make my date with Clanton.<eos> We're making s'mores... in a hallowed out Fiat.<eos> Let's welcome Stanza Awardwinning poet<eos> Claudia Ramirez.
That means she had reason to want Margaret out of the picture.<eos> Anne, I don't want to jinx this, but this is rock-solid momentum.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - You've got some nerve pulling that kind of horse[bleep] with me, Counselor.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Turn on the television, you [bleep]<eos> We're going to ask some questions just to establish a baseline.<eos> How tall are you?<eos> 6'8" in skates.<eos> How about not in skates?
The top of the plant is shaped like an open mouth with toothlike spines around the edges.<eos> When a fly attracted to the smell of the flower lands on the Venus flytrap, the mouth of the plant begins to close, trapping the terrified fly who slowly, slowly, slowly... dissolves into nothing.<eos> As Violet, Klaus and Sunny arrived at their brunch with Count Olaf, a few minutes late because Mr. Poe missed the turn... they felt as helpless as a fly as Count Olaf's evil scheme closed around them.<eos> Sadly, they would not learn for a long time that someone was there, desperately trying to help them.<eos> Uh, hello, I'm Larry, your waiter. Welcome to the Anxious Clown Restaurant, where everybody has a good time whether they like it or not.<eos> I can see we have a whole family lunching together, so allow me to recommend the Extra Fun Special Family Appetizer.<eos> It's a bunch of things fried up together and served with a sauce.<eos> Well, that sounds wonderful!<eos> Extra Special Family Fun Appetizer for an extra special family.<eos> Mine.
- It's a clown wig.<eos> - We don't care!<eos> Make sure you don't blow this.<eos> - So if you want to make it out of here...<eos> - Alive.<eos> - With both hands.<eos> - you better do exactly what we say.<eos> You're gonna fix a nice lunch for everybody.<eos> - With no tricks.<eos> - No knockout drugs. - No poison.
while Captain Sham has known her for many years.<eos> Along with her husband, what's-his-name.<eos> Count Olaf is a murderous man who's only interested in your parents' money, while Captain Sham has expressed great interest in raising you children<eos> - without touching a single penny.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - We're allergic to peppermints. - What?<eos> We'll see.<eos> Get me another navel!<eos> So, can we all agree that Captain Sham has none of the hallmarks,<eos> - earmarks or benchmarks of Count Olaf?
So what?<eos> Well, that just means that before long, certain people are going to want to look at it.<eos> And some of those people... will be real estate agents.<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> Aunt Josephine, I really do wish you'd stop saying that.<eos> Hurricane Herman is over, the sailboat is working perfectly and we'll be back to Damocles Dock by morning.<eos> We're as safe as can possibly be expected.<eos> Maybe... maybe you could think back to a time when you were a little more fierce and formidable.<eos> - Where did you find this?<eos> - In the library.
Oh, my poor Ike!<eos> He always loved shredded beef tamales, and they ended up sealing his doom.<eos> I'm sure we'll be all right.<eos> You said that the leeches were usually harmless.<eos> Unless you have recently eaten.<eos> We haven't eaten anything since those peppermints at the Anxious Clown.<eos> That was brunch, and it's almost morning now.<eos> You didn't eat anything recently, did you, Aunt Josephine?<eos> Aunt Josephine?<eos> Banana.
There is nothing else.<eos> We're all alone.<eos> - I think I see something down there!<eos> - If only we brought the spyglass.<eos> These will have to do.<eos> - You did it.<eos> - We did it.<eos> It's a plane.<eos> Klaus, lower the sail.<eos> Help!
You were going to betray me?<eos> - After all the years we spent together?<eos> After all of those picnics by the shore?<eos> After all of those shredded beef tamales I served to your husband?<eos> After all the secrets we had shared?<eos> Yes! I was going to betray you, and these three children gave me the courage to do so.<eos> Ever since their parents were killed, they have been so fierce and formidable, again and again escaping from your clutches.<eos> And what have I done all these years?<eos> Nothing but hide in my house.<eos> Well, enough of that.
As I'm sure you know, one way to demonstrate you don't care about something is to say the word and then repeat the word with the letters S-C-H-M replacing the real first letters.<eos> If you didn't care about truth and justice, for example, you might say "truth, schmuth" or "justice, schmustice."<eos> But as Count Olaf steered the Baudelaire orphans away from the Leeches, their feelings about Aunt Josephine were far more complicated.<eos> She had given them a home, even if it was cold and not hurricane-proof.<eos> She had tried to teach them, even if it wasn't what they wanted to learn.<eos> And like the Baudelaires, she had experienced great loss.<eos> And while that doesn't make a good guardian, it didn't make her a bad person.<eos> For this reason, the Baudelaires did not think, "Josephine, Schmosephine."<eos> They thought... "We hope Aunt Josephine is safe."<eos> Everybody off!
Oh, Georgina... you little minx.<eos> You have lipstick on your teeth.<eos> Yes, it's part of my character.<eos> I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Partner trouble.<eos> But you'd know all about that, Charles.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> She has Charles.<eos> Now, Charles, would you like to look at the screen and tell me what you see?<eos> - Orphans.
I'm sure many doctors have skeletons to study anatomy.<eos> I suppose they could keep them in closets.<eos> But Dr. Orwell's an eye doctor.<eos> Skeletons don't even have eyes.<eos> Look.<eos> - What are those?<eos> - Records.<eos> Any Tito Puente?<eos> Not that type of record, Sunny.<eos> Medical records.
The office is over there.<eos> You can wait on that bench.<eos> You're not coming with us?<eos> Oh, this has already taken up much too long already.<eos> Banking hours.<eos> I do want you children to know... I hope you find comfort here.<eos> Um, this came to the bank for you.<eos> I assume it's junk mail.<eos> I can't imagine that you know anyone in South America, or why the return address is from my secretary.<eos> So long, Baudelaires.
In a world both frightening and unlucky, there are a few comforts.<eos> One of them is making new friends.<eos> Friends can make you feel the world is smaller and safer than it really is, because you know people who have similar experiences.<eos> When you meet people like that, you may find your world feels a little more complete.<eos> Like the missing piece of a puzzle... or two halves of a broken spyglass.<eos> Click.<eos> # You may think that the Baudelaires Ought to prevail #<eos> # And be tucked some place All safe and sound #<eos> # Count Olaf captured And rotting in jail #<eos> # His henchpeople nowhere around #
The Baudelaires are lost and unsupervised!<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> - Without supervision?<eos> - Good God, man, you're right!<eos> We must act now. We must act without delay.<eos> We... need...<eos> We need...<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Oh, my. This is excellent chowder.<eos> Mmm, mmm. Good.
He's just in town, looking for Dr. Georgina Orwell, in the hopes of somehow making things right.<eos> Because life is so short, it is so rare to meet, to find someone who shares one's brilliance, one's charm, one's dubious moral code in a world gone gloriously wrong.<eos> Such people must stick together like comrades, like partners, like...<eos> You've changed your hair. Olaf.<eos> Georgina.<eos> I swore I would never let you darken my door again.<eos> I took a solemn oath that my office would be closed to you forever, even during regular business hours.<eos> You're not still mad about... whatever I did.<eos> You left me to drown.<eos> Water under the bridge.
Lucky Smells Lumbermill.<eos> This is he.<eos> The Baudelaire orphans working here at the mill?<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> They're children.<eos> They're probably somewhere enjoying a hot cup of coffee in front of a roaring fire... wherever they are, which certainly isn't here.<eos> Now, who is this?<eos> Hello?<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - With me?
So how do you send a message to the future?<eos> How does E.T. phone home?<eos> You need a venue.<eos> Huh? You got to make a splash big enough to hit 'em a hundred years from now.<eos> Make 'em laugh.<eos> Whoa. Make 'em cry.<eos> Give 'em what they want.<eos> Just when you've got 'em right in the palm of your hand...<eos> You hit 'em with the goods...<eos> Your message.

Para-box.<eos> This is splinter technology.<eos> This "paradox in a box"... what is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Bad news, though.<eos> It's like a weapon or something.<eos> Once again, Causality's Fool finds herself entangled in our enemy's conspiracy.<eos> Wait, me?<eos> So what are you thinking?<eos> Causality's Fool?
Causality's Fool?<eos> This technology he possesses, coupled with Miss Goines' visions... something is happening of profound importance with the Army of the 12 Monkeys.<eos> So if this asshole is one of her four horsemen, where's the other three?<eos> What is it?<eos> Mr. Hockley is overdue.<eos> Said something about going to the theater.<eos> Where's my son?<eos> The Witness is safe.<eos> Why was I sedated?<eos> Your safety.

I said I wanted to see my son.<eos> This... is your son.<eos> His history... our history.<eos> This place, these things... this is who your son will become.<eos> No, he's a... he's just a child.<eos> The Witness, your son, is a child, a man, a word... our savior.<eos> Present now, yet also in the past.<eos> He's all of this... simultaneously.<eos> He's not here, is he?<eos> The man.
I told you the Witness has been hunting us.<eos> Do not shoot!<eos> Stand down!<eos> This anger... use it.<eos> Help me stop the Witness once and for all.<eos> I know how.<eos> I know how.<eos> I checked the theater district.<eos> Most haven't opened yet.<eos> No sign of Mr. Hockley.
Thank you for your sacrifice.<eos> We leave Paris immediately.<eos> In an instant, it was as if they were never there.<eos> Neither were we.<eos> Their reset of time splintered us back to where we started.<eos> These Guardians are unstoppable.<eos> If they see us coming, they will immediately go back and rewrite their timeline...<eos> And ours.<eos> So what is it they were protecting?<eos> A child.
Again and again.<eos> Your red forest...<eos> No, Athan, it's not salvation.<eos> - It's...<eos> - The death of a thief!<eos> Your words, Mother.<eos> Not mine.<eos> I wanted to be blind.<eos> I didn't want to witness...<eos> But for her...
- Cassie... - Synchronized.<eos> Now.<eos> Clever.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - We have new movement.<eos> - Where?<eos> - London!<eos> I have multiple time signatures.<eos> They found him.<eos> Shit.
James and Cassandra have found their son.<eos> What would you do?<eos> Where would you go?<eos> Somewhere safe.<eos> Somewhere...<eos> The lions are taking their cub back to their den.<eos> There is place sacred to the men like my brother...<eos> Their home.<eos> A house.<eos> Of cedar and pine.
Of cedar and pine.<eos> The origin of the Witness.<eos> The moment itself exists outside causality.<eos> The house is real, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where?<eos> I can give you the location, but for the exact when... I'll need something from you.<eos> Why don't you sit down, make yourself at home?<eos> When are we exactly?<eos> December 26, 1959.
Yes.<eos> Then proceed.<eos> Where are you right now?<eos> When?<eos> Show me.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Make yourself at home.<eos> When is this moment?<eos> When are we exactly?<eos> December 26, 1959.
Right after I undid our lives here.<eos> This would've been your home.<eos> I know when they are.<eos> It's now.<eos> It's here.<eos> The end.<eos> They're coming for me.<eos> For you.<eos> Ready the machine for December 26, 1959.<eos> Roughly 1900 hours.
That isn't someone who's ever been anywhere she didn't want to be.<eos> Is that what you think I'm doing here?<eos> Playing God?<eos> Playing God lacks ambition.<eos> Why play at something when you can simply become it?<eos> It's unnatural.<eos> No one should have strength like this.<eos> This isn't science; it's witchcraft.<eos> Fire alarm.<eos> Olivia's cell.
Athan is the dying man.<eos> Athan is the dying man.<eos> Go get help! Go!<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> I'm here. I'm here.<eos> No one's gonna die.<eos> Not them. Not you.<eos> No dying.<eos> I'm here.<eos> No dying!
That is why you will lose.<eos> This is an international multicast from the American CDC.<eos> Doctors at the Baltimore CDC are working day and night to develop a vaccine.<eos> We won't stop until we have one, but we can't do it alone.<eos> If you're one of the immune, you're vital to our research.<eos> The suit's repair is complete.<eos> I'm going to have to leave you now.<eos> I must return to Titan.<eos> Tonight.<eos> For James and Cassandra.
Alex Parrish, national hero, in the wrong place at the right time two years running.<eos> You're gonna tell me everything.<eos> And you're gonna convince me that you're not a part of it so I can convince the FBI before a Hellfire missile, launched by our own government, strikes a hostage crisis in downtown New York, killing everyone inside, including the hostages.<eos> So... pretend we never met.<eos> Pretend the fact that I didn't like you, then grew to respect you but still... didn't like you, never happened.<eos> You told me this crazy story once before that turned out to be true.<eos> You better be able to do it again.<eos> 10 months ago, I went undercover at the CIA recruitment facility known as The Farm.<eos> - Undercover?<eos> - For the FBI.
Shelby reads, Jane watches television.<eos> You're calling yourself Shelby.<eos> That's not a good sign.<eos> Said by the woman who had her own sister use her name for six months.<eos> Has he told you any more about who he killed?<eos> No, but he said it's for my own good.<eos> That's a good sign.<eos> He wants to protect you from it.<eos> Which means he is starting to develop feelings for me.<eos> For Jane.
Your mark's on the move.<eos> You've been staring.<eos> And so have you.<eos> I just don't know why.<eos> I'll tell you why... if you can keep up with me.<eos> Hi. I was just thinking about you.<eos> Listen, I know I said I couldn't meet you tonight, but the conference I'm attending in Philly might not go as long as I thought.<eos> You want to meet?<eos> Sure.<eos> My place?
$3 million.<eos> Plus interest.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> We had to charge Tommy.<eos> What? For what?<eos> For the murder of the Kincaids.<eos> Nick!<eos> You were holding him to protect him!<eos> When the DA found out, there was too much evidence to...<eos> Eviden... What evidence?
In the meantime, you could take The Hammer with you.<eos> I'm happy to help.<eos> Great. Well, that's settled.<eos> Come along, Daniel.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, I was thinking.<eos> Can you help or something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just lift up on your end.<eos> About the diamonds...
Mediums don't usually stay long in Midnight.<eos> I imagine it's got to be hard on you.<eos> Pawn shop's not my favorite place.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I saw the murder.<eos> A biker killed Aubrey.<eos> Sons of Lucifer?<eos> - You know them?<eos> - I see 'em around.<eos> White power jerks.
You really want to find the killer, you keep looking.<eos> That was pretty badass.<eos> I hope it helps.<eos> I got faith.<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm saying.<eos> Resume the search further downstream.<eos> Humor me.<eos> In case we missed something.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Back from the hospital?
Back from the hospital?<eos> One's still in surgery.<eos> Knee's being rebuilt.<eos> The others are stable.<eos> Good thing they're Nazis, or I'd feel bad.<eos> Think this is funny?<eos> It's not.<eos> You're suspended.<eos> - What?<eos> - Till further notice.
Why the hell is there a tiger?<eos> I think it's the Rev.<eos> What? Is he okay? He'll be fine.<eos> Let's move, now!<eos> You're late.<eos> Moving slowly tonight.<eos> I haven't had breakfast.<eos> No.<eos> I covered the shop all day.<eos> No leeching tonight.
- What's doing this?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> What... what is it doing?<eos> What is it doing?<eos> I can't stop it.<eos> Please help me! Please help me.<eos> I won't let it hurt you.<eos> But...<eos> I need someone a lot more powerful than me.<eos> - Who?
Yeah. Yeah, the house is quiet.<eos> That was...<eos> That was not good.<eos> I need to go home and take a bath.<eos> I wouldn't leave.<eos> The Rev escaped.<eos> What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Did you find him?<eos> No sign.
Well, what?<eos> Well, I think you said that once you weren't bleeding...<eos> Just... just curious.<eos> Is this about pissing off your dad?<eos> I'd say maybe 2% is me rebelling, and the rest is me kind of being into you.<eos> Well, 98%.<eos> I can live with that.<eos> Manfred stands between us and that?<eos> I think so.<eos> Damn.
We found it in the trash.<eos> The baseball signed by Thurman Munson.<eos> - Can I keep it? - No.<eos> Bag it and log it.<eos> That's what I told him, detective.<eos> The roommate's calmed down. She's ready to talk to you.<eos> So Barb, you found the body? Yes.<eos> I was at my boyfriend's last night and when I got back this morning I found her like that.<eos> Had you known her long?<eos> A year.
The roommate's calmed down. She's ready to talk to you.<eos> So Barb, you found the body? Yes.<eos> I was at my boyfriend's last night and when I got back this morning I found her like that.<eos> Had you known her long?<eos> A year.<eos> I met her on craigslist.<eos> I inherited the house from my grandfather and rented out the spare room.<eos> There were no signs of forced entry, she likely knew her killer.<eos> You know her friends?<eos> Boyfriends? No.
Report is somewhere.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You can head out with Clive now.<eos> Oh, before you go, I'm rejiggering the memory enhancer.<eos> I'm emailing you a list of ingredients I need from the medical supply near your apartment.<eos> Could you bring it in tomorrow?<eos> Sure.<eos> I can't find my cell phone.<eos> Ravi, can you be a total stud and call it for me?<eos> From the drawer?
You still know your way around battle of Pegasus.<eos> Nazis are the bad guys, right?<eos> Nachos, gaming.<eos> We talk girls, it'll be like old times. Nazi!<eos> So, Liv?<eos> Yeah. There's still something there, you know?<eos> But I'm human again, so we're back to square one. Or two.<eos> Or I've lost count of the squares.<eos> Nazi!<eos> And stuff with Peyton?
Say you're not mad.<eos> Hey bro, I'm trying to run a club here.<eos> Vibe matters, and this is not a good vibe.<eos> - What can I get you?<eos> - I'm fine. C'mon.<eos> On the house. Anything.<eos> What do you want?<eos> To be human again.<eos> Well, things are tough all over.<eos> Not entirely.
Why?<eos> I'm usually pretty busy back here, so I can't really tell you much about her.<eos> There must be something.<eos> She was annoying, she was always flirting, always playing some sort of angle.<eos> It felt like she was hosting "the Yvonne show." Or something...<eos> Pepper vodka?<eos> Do a shot with me!<eos> It'll loosen you up.<eos> C'mon.<eos> By order of Seattle pd.
- And now you're hiding from police questioning.<eos> That's the big deal.<eos> Okay, yeah, I hid 'cause I thought you'd recognized me, and I didn't want the hassle.<eos> Okay?<eos> Satisfied?<eos> No.<eos> Why'd you slap Yvonne Fallon?<eos> She slept with my husband.<eos> Is this true?<eos> Not exactly.
No.<eos> Why'd you slap Yvonne Fallon?<eos> She slept with my husband.<eos> Is this true?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> And it wasn't a big deal, anyway.<eos> You guys need to rethink what qualifies as a "big deal."<eos> You've already lied to me once.<eos> Let's say we had relations of a, uh...<eos> Sexual nature.
- Men are garbage. - Liv...<eos> Not you, Clive.<eos> You're the best.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> This is Liv, leave me a message.<eos> Liv, it's Ravi.<eos> There's a sample tray at your workstation with just a spleen in it.<eos> Maybe you know who it belongs to. Call me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hard at work.
I... I heard something, that I feel I need to, you know, pass along.<eos> It's about Blaine.<eos> What did you hear?<eos> That Blaine is faking his memory loss as a way to leave his problems behind.<eos> Get a new start.<eos> I wasn't going to say anything, but...<eos> If it's true, then the cure works.<eos> And if the cure works, well, you know what that would mean for Liv.<eos> Where'd you hear this?<eos> A guy, from Blaine's old crew.
So I dropped by the morgue today. I needed some information on a case from Ravi.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Uh, Ravi came at me with this whole elaborate conspiracy theory that you've been faking your memory loss this whole time.<eos> I'm starting to think that guy has a crush on you.<eos> - What's his theory? - I guess, one of your old running buddies was in his ear.<eos> He said you just wanted to keep your business going and win me over.<eos> Absurd, right?<eos> I mean, he knows what happened to major since he took the cure.<eos> You know what this needs?<eos> Pinot.
What happened to, "it didn't matter how we got here"?<eos> I'm a lawyer, Blaine.<eos> I shouldn't be trusted.<eos> Mom!<eos> I should've talked to you about it.<eos> But I was in high school, I was confused, and dad was a wreck.<eos> I felt like I had to pick a side, and it was so much easier to choose the parent who didn't have a new girlfriend.<eos> So, now you have to tell me everything.<eos> I mean, the last I heard, you were engaged to some woman, and she just broke it off.<eos> Liv.
Mrs. Spencer was to bring him over from the asylum for us.<eos> Mrs. Spencer got off the train with that strange snippet, gave her over to my charge.<eos> Said you'd be along for her presently.<eos> Well, that's all I know about it.<eos> I haven't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Well, I'm sure the girl will be only too happy to tell you every little detail of what happened.<eos> She's got a tongue of her own, that's for certain.<eos> Good day to you.
I might've known nobody would really want me.<eos> Oh, for heaven's sake, child, what are you doing on the ground?<eos> Now, you listen here and stand up.<eos> - What do you make of this?<eos> I figure... she's traveled a long way to be disappointed.<eos> Well, she shouldn't be here.<eos> You should never have brought her home.<eos> She's had a shock.<eos> She's not the only one.<eos> Enough of this foolishness.
Haven't I been of help to you?<eos> Please don't leave me here.<eos> You're not kin. I got enough kin.<eos> You're taking her back and that's final.<eos> I'm so sorry!<eos> Nothing's broken.<eos> Oh, you'll never keep me now.<eos> I was never going to keep you.<eos> I'll be back in time for tea.<eos> Anne...
Well, I... I don't know. I...<eos> I didn't say Matthew and I had absolutely decided we wouldn't keep her.<eos> I just came over to find out how the mistake had occurred.<eos> I'd better take her home again and talk it over with my brother.<eos> I ought not to decide on anything without consulting him.<eos> If we make up our minds not to keep her, we'll send her over to you.<eos> Otherwise, you can assume that she'll be staying with us.<eos> Will that suit you, Mrs. Blewett?<eos> - I suppose it'll have to.<eos> Good day.
in place of "yours respectfully" the way ministers do?<eos> Do you suppose it'll make any difference?<eos> - I don't suppose it will.<eos> - As God is my witness, I will do everything in my earthly power to make you want to keep me.<eos> Good night.<eos> God, give me strength to succeed in my quest!<eos> - That will do. - Sorry.<eos> I quite like praying.<eos> Well, it's time to say good night.<eos> Good night.
I can see now<eos> I'm going to have to be very careful what I say after this since the fine feelings of orphans, brought from goodness knows where, have to be considered before anything else.<eos> - Now, now...<eos> - Oh, no, no.<eos> I'm not vexed.<eos> Don't worry yourself.<eos> I feel too sorry for you to have any anger left in my mind.<eos> But if you will take my advice you will have that "talking-to"<eos> with a fair-sized birch switch, and get her on the next train out.<eos> Goodbye, Marilla.
But you're smart enough to find the right words, I'm sure of it.<eos> But why should the apology have to come from me when it was Mrs. Lynde who caused the entire situation?<eos> Well, you know...<eos> I like to think that that one fine day, it won't matter a whit to you what anybody says sideways.<eos> You have a good imagination.<eos> I suppose it would be true enough to say I'm sorry.<eos> I am sorry I upset Miss Marilla. And you.<eos> So go and smooth things over, can't you?<eos> Very well. I'll attempt it.<eos> For you.
I mean it.<eos> Go get it.<eos> - Hold her down. - Please... don't!<eos> Don't!<eos> Stop talking.<eos> Guess what, Princess Cordelia. We're sick of you and your stupid stories! - Stupid stories!<eos> - Liar!<eos> This little mousey made too much noise. - Squeak squeak squeak...<eos> But then it got caught in a trap.<eos> So now... no more squeaking.
Guess what, Princess Cordelia. We're sick of you and your stupid stories! - Stupid stories!<eos> - Liar!<eos> This little mousey made too much noise. - Squeak squeak squeak...<eos> But then it got caught in a trap.<eos> So now... no more squeaking.<eos> So shut your face from now on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Speak only when spoken to.<eos> No startling speeches. Anne?
I told you that brooch meant a great deal to me.<eos> No, b-b-but I made it up! None of that was real!<eos> I didn't take your brooch!<eos> I don't know where it is!<eos> Please, Miss Cuthbert, you have to believe me!<eos> I don't have to do anything.<eos> Please, Miss Cuthbert...<eos> I can't trust one word out of your mouth.<eos> - Please...<eos> - Enough.
People are shooting guns and running.<eos> It's chaos.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Looking for you.<eos> You got out of the camps?<eos> They just released me.<eos> And you came here?<eos> I tried to go home, but the Occupation took over our house.<eos> There was an attack...<eos> What attack?
Your mom. She's part of the Resistance.<eos> What?<eos> The Occupation came to arrest her, and your dad took everybody to hide.<eos> Why are you holding a knife? I just...<eos> I heard gunshots, and...<eos> There's some kind of attack happening.<eos> I think we need to get out of here.<eos> You have a car, right?<eos> We're safer in the house.<eos> Hey, little guy.
I must admit to a certain fondness for Los Angeles.<eos> I always loved visiting... before.<eos> I share the sentiment.<eos> I've lived here for a long time.<eos> You must understand that I've come to Los Angeles only to gather information.<eos> Others will be reaching the conclusions.<eos> Of course.<eos> I just wanted to be sure that you had all the information.<eos> On what subject?<eos> Proxy Michael Alcala.
A kid you had a few chance encounters with had you down as his "in case of emergency?"<eos> Apparently.<eos> You're a detective, Clive.<eos> This look like a chance encounter?<eos> Maybe you should take a seat.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _
What's that about?<eos> The Max Rager cans stuffed in his pocket...<eos> Tuttle worked for Fillmore-Graves, the company that bought out Max Rager.<eos> Why does a private military contractor buy out an energy drink company?<eos> There's not a lot of brainstormers in the group, huh?<eos> - Where's the kid?<eos> - Over here.<eos> "Wally Reid. 11 years old."<eos> That's a lot of broken bones for a kid that age.<eos> Any recent signs of abuse?
So, you maintained a relationship with Anna while her husband was in jail?<eos> If by that you mean if I helped her out occasionally...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Helped her out, how?<eos> Hey, neighbor cop.<eos> I'm so sorry to bother you but my shift starts in 20 minutes and my sitter just canceled and I know this is a lot to ask, but is there any chance you can fill in for me at the diner?<eos> Joking!<eos> But maybe Wally can hang out at your place tonight? See what I did there?<eos> Does the place you work have pie?<eos> All kinds.
Because Ravi is a pretty cool guy.<eos> Thanks, Dad Brain.<eos> You find anything on those old Chuck Burd shows?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Well, get back to work.<eos> There's a crisp five dollar bill in it for you if you do. Oh!<eos> The smoke detector batteries probably need a change.<eos> On it.<eos> - Guess what I just found out?<eos> - What?
Therein lies the last exchange between the two adolescents.<eos> Take heed of Winslow's final text.<eos> You ever been to Perversion?<eos> It's on 9th.<eos> - I think you'd really...<eos> - Got it.<eos> "You, expletive, expletive."<eos> "I can't believe you told your dad."<eos> "If he goes to the, expletive, police..." "You're, expletive, dead."<eos> Winslow.
And from the recordings we have of the Chuck Burd show, it sure sounds like you believed you had a zombie problem.<eos> Where were you that night, Mr. Huntsman?<eos> Okay? I won't be your patsy.<eos> First, I was in Portland at my sister's wedding. Second, I'm not the only one who knew<eos> I had brain eaters living next door.<eos> And who else might've known?<eos> See?<eos> What am I looking at?<eos> Message board.<eos> - For whom?
Everyone on this message board, a few hundred people, knew I had brain eaters living next door.<eos> I'd love to see some photos from your sister's wedding.<eos> You got any of those?<eos> Anyone who visited this message board had access to Caleb and Anna's address.<eos> And the neighbor?<eos> His alibi checks out.<eos> "If you know where other zombies live, post it here."<eos> They're hunting us.<eos> Twenty-one months and 21 days.<eos> - Until what?

NO!<eos> The guns arrived in Pruszko on yesterday's train.<eos> These are the names of six of our fighters in German custody.<eos> I will trade Fritz for them.<eos> Unless all six prisoners are there, we'll execute him.<eos> I'm offering you a job.<eos> I'd like you as my associate.<eos> You can start at the office at 9 am sharp.<eos> We did land a prize.<eos> A Brigadefuhrer.
I have to send a message.<eos> May I?<eos> Before our radio was damaged, I was the operator.<eos> My brother Eli taught me.<eos> He was in the Army.<eos> If you show me the key, I can work on the encryption.<eos> If it's a one-time code, you're not giving any secrets away.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll let him know.<eos> Polizeifuhrer?
- He's strong, Sabine.<eos> He'll find a way to come home.<eos> Maybe you should make sure everything is ready for him.<eos> Don't you have any friends out there that could help Franz?<eos> They were supposed to arrive by train yesterday, but they didn't.<eos> Of course. You were everywhere in Paris, but now, when we need you? Nowhere to be found.<eos> Untersturmfuhrer Edsel has arranged for someone to take you home, Sabine.<eos> Thank you, Frau Bauer.<eos> It means a great deal to me that you are here.<eos> For Sabine.
I can't seem to find something adequate for Reichmann and Dahl.<eos> There are only cottages left.<eos> I'm sure something appropriate will come up after the next block of evacuations.<eos> - More Jews.<eos> - No, no.<eos> Most of them are already gone.<eos> The locals are being resettled.<eos> Resettled?<eos> There will be ample choices for Dahl and Reichmann when they arrive.<eos> Jana?
I'm going to step out for a moment.<eos> Good day.<eos> I... I heard about the fire.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - It was us.<eos> To get them to stop the train.<eos> We managed to break out, but... we were under fire from the Germans.<eos> And Harry...<eos> The Gestapo's going to show up for the rendezvous at 4:00 PM.<eos> - Without the prisoners?
Yeah.<eos> I've been gone too long.<eos> We never got to finish our conversation from the train.<eos> If you're going to ask about the guns, I've already told...<eos> I'm more interested in what brings you here, Fritz.<eos> Someone of your rank, it must be business.<eos> So what is it?<eos> More evacuations?<eos> I deal in counterintelligence.<eos> Pacification.
Or I will find her and do to her what your people did to mine.<eos> I'll tell you. I'll tell you.<eos> Here.<eos> They don't have the prisoners to trade for you.<eos> They've been killed.<eos> No one here knows.<eos> They think the Germans are going ahead with the exchange.<eos> We'll find a way to set you free.<eos> Could you watch them a moment while I load these welcome gifts<eos> - into the car?
- Yes, Herr Bridgadefuhrer.<eos> - We're going to eradicate those Resistance guerrillas.<eos> - Where do we start?<eos> The forest spans for miles.<eos> No, not the forest.<eos> I know exactly where they will be.<eos> I sent them there.<eos> There are to be no survivors.<eos> Understood, Herr Brigadefuhrer.<eos> Now, Edsel!
One of the biggest assets that we've ever had.<eos> I need to know if I can trust you.<eos> That goes both ways.<eos> Your vaudevillian is in love with aurora.<eos> Where is it you're from?<eos> The moon.

Yeah, I should have known they'd invade there too.<eos> Sharpshooter miri was recently arrested for shooting soldiers.<eos> From a bell tower.
Sharpshooter miri was recently arrested for shooting soldiers.<eos> From a bell tower.<eos> Tell me where she is.<eos> You're gonna break her out on your own?<eos> Get yourself killed?<eos> I'm not gonna let you do that.<eos> I have to see her. I have to.<eos> We didn't get to say goodbye.<eos> Klaus!<eos> Krystina.
I'm not some porcelain doll.<eos> Of course not.<eos> And that's why we need your help.<eos> Franz, he needs your help.<eos> I don't know who franz is.<eos> Please, just come with me.<eos> I'm done taking orders.<eos> From you, from franz.<eos> And you can tell him I won't come to his party either!<eos> What party?
We... Must grieve.<eos> So, For the sake of all the souls watching us right now, Watching.<eos> And love, and do what is right. Because the future...<eos> I have something to say.<eos> I want to make a toast. To my husband.<eos> Franz, I never thought you'd become the man you are today.<eos> I hope we can all find a way to live by your words.<eos> To the future!<eos> Citizens of caillefaux, I expect.<eos> Your full attention.

I don't know. Uh, six months?<eos> - Zara Hallam.<eos> - Um... sorry.<eos> Zara, this is my, um... uh, my friend.<eos> - Reynolds Baker.<eos> - Friend.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, I'll let the two of you, um, catch up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wow.
Eric and his team are amazing.<eos> And I really feel like I'm helping people.<eos> Do you and Mr. Beaumont ever talk about things?<eos> - Your drink.<eos> - Uh...<eos> Yeah, not really.<eos> We're so busy all the time.<eos> You wanted answers, Maxine, about your mother's death.<eos> I got some already.<eos> From who?
I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> Not... Not being funny, but $4 million for paintings like this?<eos> Didn't realize you were a critic, Maxine.<eos> Well, you can share both your opinions with the art-gallery director.<eos> Oh, that'll be room service.<eos> My latte.<eos> Better make it quick.<eos> Oh, nice place.<eos> How's their record for security?<eos> Spotless.
Too easy.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> Okay, CCTV picked up a figure leaving at 2:03 this morning.<eos> One minute after the alarm.<eos> So, someone opened the door for the intruder from the inside, drilled through the lock...<eos> Trying to make it look like a break-in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> Looks like it's Jasper's burrito time.<eos> Help!

Well, for anything that shows us how he's mixed up in this.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Mm. It's true what they say about you, Jasper.<eos> The work you have done for us is the best I have ever seen.<eos> Now we just need you to do the rest of the job, hmm?<eos> The easy part.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> No touching!<eos> No touching!
Well, listen, you don't want to betray her confidence.<eos> I get it. But she told you something.<eos> Was it... Was it about Evie?<eos> Mnh-mnh.<eos> Well, somebody's ill.<eos> Sister, her mother.<eos> I'm gonna go with sister.<eos> Mother.<eos> Thanks, Ollie.<eos> No laptop.

Exactly like that.<eos> Sydney Graves, Isabelle Kalish's fiancé, was also Jasper's teacher.<eos> That's how Isabelle met him.<eos> They're both teachers.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, Isabelle's had many offers.<eos> Isolating the audio profile of Sydney's voice from Eric's button cam alongside the disguised voice from the phone call.<eos> That offer's not enough.<eos> Isolating the word "offer."<eos> Offers.

Is everything okay?<eos> Of course.<eos> Put the briefcase on the bed and then open it.<eos> There's a safe in the wardrobe.<eos> The code is 1961.<eos> The key is to the room where the paintings are.<eos> When the money's in the safe, I'll give you the room number.<eos> This one's legit, too?<eos> "Improvisation" by Niko Korbinian.<eos> 1933.

You stole my grandmother's paintings?<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> Please, would you just... would you just...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> For what it's worth, he's telling the truth, Ms. Kalish.<eos> It isn't that simple.<eos> You see?<eos> He only intended to steal the paintings from the gallery long enough to collect the insurance money.<eos> I did this for you.<eos> And for her.
And for her.<eos> Why?<eos> Do you really need to ask?<eos> We can barely cover our expenses.<eos> And I know that you would never sell those paintings.<eos> You betrayed me, Sydney.<eos> I can't believe you used Jasper for this.<eos> Whose idea was it, Mr. Graves?<eos> Was it yours or Mr. Castel's?<eos> Mr. Castel's.
Kosovan national.<eos> Specializes in the illegal-artifact trade, specifically finding Nazi-looted art to order.<eos> Nazi-looted art?<eos> I-I don't understand.<eos> I suspect the real "Formation in Yellow"<eos> isn't a part of your collection, Ms. Kalish.<eos> It never was.<eos> It's a forgery.<eos> Hiding a much more valuable painting.<eos> The Rubens.
Mr. Beaumont said he was dead.<eos> Where'sEugene?<eos> He's getting rid of the body.<eos> Eric has his phone.<eos> Arnold is dead.<eos> Nathalie?<eos> Gwyneth.<eos> Is Eric here?<eos> No, he's trying to get Jasper back.<eos> Jasper?
He wants us to stop him from going back inside.<eos> Oliver.<eos> Listen, I know you don't like the police, but in a few hours, they're gonna come and take that man away.<eos> Okay.<eos> A few hours.<eos> There is a valuable painting hidden in here.<eos> That's why they want you to remove the forgery.<eos> What is it?<eos> He would like to know what he's uncovering.<eos> A Rubens.
Melanie, we were in the memory cube.<eos> Somehow, he teleported three of us 600 feet through two solid walls.<eos> What are you?<eos> Where did you grow up?<eos> You seem like a city girl.<eos> I was raised on the 31st floor.<eos> - Mother?<eos> - Yeah, I had one of those.<eos> Father?<eos> A couple.
She was famously smart.<eos> She wrote these essays people talked about.<eos> We had these parties. "Salons," she called them.<eos> Artists with mustaches and men with money clips, like big game hunters trying to bring her down.<eos> We kept their heads instead.<eos> We lived in the country.<eos> Read mostly picture books.<eos> That sounds nice.<eos> Trees and meadows.<eos> No crowds.
Could you maybe not break everything this time?<eos> I'm not gonna promise that.<eos> - I'll be right outside, okay?<eos> We want to continue to model your brain waves and take some hormone readings.<eos> This time, I want you to think of something... stressful.<eos> The worse, the better.<eos> Trick or treat!<eos> Come on, King.<eos> One more house, Davey. Then it's time to go home.<eos> No. No treats.
Here in berlin?<eos> Everyone else.<eos> Off to the big party? Left you on your own?<eos> You and your colleagues gave brigadefuhrer faber a good ru.<eos> Just blew up a bridge.<eos> Knocked off a tank or two.<eos> Nothing compared to what you lot get up to.<eos> That's a compliment to your late leader, colonel sinclair.<eos> The resourcefulness... The resilience you had.<eos> Most of you, anyway.
Her name is aurora and she's a spy.<eos> Clever.<eos> She ignited the bullets as a distraction. To get himmler's guards away from voigt. Why?<eos> To kill him.<eos> There was a syringe with a lethal fluid hidden.<eos> In the painting. I came to see who would retrieve it.<eos> She's been deceiving you, me,<eos> Sabine.<eos> So this was all a lie?<eos> From our first conversation?
If you're caught,<eos> You're fair game for torture.<eos> There's no uniform to protect you.<eos> Survival rate in the field is only 50%.<eos> They won't write about you in the papers.<eos> You won't get any parades.<eos> Hello, mags.<eos> The official secrets act means.<eos> You don't talk.<eos> Ever.
You don't hear that?<eos> Emori, get the seizure kit now.<eos> Abby left it in the office.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's... it's ok.<eos> It's ok. I'm fine.<eos> Put that stuff with the gear for the last run.<eos> I'll start on the processors.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No coding, all right?
Becca?<eos> You can tell me that it's none of my business, but why live in a hole in the ground when you have a perfectly good rocket?<eos> Are you tilling the soil or stabbing it?<eos> You know this is dumb, right?<eos> We'll all be dead before anything grows.<eos> The earth survived praimfaya once.<eos> It will again.<eos> We do this for those who come after us.<eos> Let me show you.<eos> Ilian.
After you, Wanheda.<eos> All my enemies in one place.<eos> Who are they?<eos> The war chiefs of the Trikru alliance.<eos> She was supposed to be alone.<eos> What fun would that be?<eos> You murdered our people.<eos> You burned our villages.<eos> Yet you have the nerve to come here in the name of peace.<eos> Not peace.

Tell them...<eos> Tell them I floated myself.<eos> Go.<eos> Survive. Heh.<eos> It's what cockroaches do, right?<eos> Can we please get back to work? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, ok, sorry.<eos> Right. Where were we?<eos> The entire city is the battlefield.<eos> No time limit.

We're back on the Ark.<eos> Killing our own people so that... so that we can live.<eos> Locking them up.<eos> Bellamy's sister is out there.<eos> He would do anything to open that door.<eos> Do you think that's a risk we should take?<eos> No, but unlike you, I hate myself for it.<eos> How we feel about ourselves is irrelevant, Abby.<eos> We all have done things to save our people.<eos> Unconscionable things.
It's time to face the music.<eos> Yes?<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> Of course.<eos> Please come in.<eos> I think we should open the door.<eos> This is about Kane.<eos> No.<eos> If we choose to save our lives over the people outside, what does that make us?<eos> Survivors.
Earth is really beautiful.<eos> How much jobi tea did you drink?<eos> Just the right amount.<eos> What did you do?<eos> You weren't supposed to find out like this, Monty.<eos> Find out what?<eos> What did you do?<eos> - Answer me! - No.<eos> Don't take that off.<eos> Not for me.
What is the hard part, Raven? Assuming we blast off in time,<eos> CO2 scrubbers on a two-person rocket won't support 8 of us.<eos> So we use supplemental oxygen.<eos> Our tanks only hold an hour of air.<eos> Correct.<eos> We'll have one hour to get into orbit, land in the hangar bay, and fire up the life-support system using an oxygen generator built to supply a lighthouse bachelor pad.<eos> You suck at talking people into things. You know that, right?<eos> Anyone here still need to be talked into this?<eos> Good.<eos> How much further to the lighthouse?
Initiating countdown.<eos> Go for launch in T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6,<eos> 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.<eos> May we meet again.<eos> Almost there.<eos> Booster separation in 3, 2, 1.<eos> Separation complete.<eos> Welcome to zero-g, boys and girls.<eos> No. Remember, oxygen is limited.<eos> No floating.
- You need to see this.<eos> Excuse us. Thank you.<eos> - You got something?<eos> - Nothing good.<eos> Whoever ran this place had it wiped down before they ran.<eos> Between that and the fire, they wasn't much left.<eos> We found shavings from some kind of titanium alloy, and this.<eos> It's definitely an integrated circuit timing chip, but I haven't seen one quite like this before.<eos> Timing chip, that's used in--<eos> Everything from traffic lights to railway switches--
- Another day in paradise.<eos> Leo took up the baritone, the Supernovas won the regional championship, and Lionel started dating some college freshman with a nipple ring.<eos> Almost enough to make a woman hope Larry gets early parole.<eos> Mnh, not on your life, sugar.<eos> Let him rot.<eos> The boys are happy, I'm happy.<eos> To what do I owe the pleasure, my love?<eos> I got word that you're looking for the 411 on the New Martyrs Brigade.<eos> - You got something?<eos> - A little chatter.
I got word that you're looking for the 411 on the New Martyrs Brigade.<eos> - You got something?<eos> - A little chatter.<eos> You know I'm always tracking the buzz on who's moving what and where.<eos> - I hear the NMB's America bound.<eos> - How many?<eos> I'm hearing six. Coming in scattershot.<eos> Their papers will be flawless.<eos> Who's running it?<eos> Al-Hambri?
And then, you know, one thing led to another and...<eos> And the next thing you knew, she was using your personal laptop to access classified data.<eos> Well, when you put it like that--<eos> You expect us to believe you knew nothing about this?<eos> Yes, because I didn't.<eos> I love this country.<eos> I take my job very, very seriously.<eos> If I'm guilty of anything, it's-- it--<eos> I have bad taste in women.<eos> A sort of blindness to--
You really should try Ginny's Cheeseburger Chowder.<eos> The ground chuck and spices, the melted cheese.<eos> I highly recommend it for the inaugural balls.<eos> If you think you can maintain your immunity agreement by blackmailing the President-elect for allegedly taking illegal campaign contributions from Alexander Kirk, you're not as smart as everyone says you are.<eos> Marlin, your boss made a campaign promise to me, and I intend to make sure he keeps it.<eos> Tell Robert I'll be in touch.<eos> How was the deposition?<eos> Terrifying.<eos> I'm sure you were great.<eos> In your eyes.
But Samar spoke to him-- said it was nothing.<eos> Yusuf Tillisi isn't a terrorist.<eos> He also isn't Yusuf Tillisi.<eos> His real name is Ezra Mandell, an operative for the Mossad. Samar knows him.<eos> She's worked with him.<eos> Why would she lie about that?<eos> To protect her fellow countrymen.<eos> To prevent you from linking the Mossad to the attack on Arkani's operation.<eos> A Mossad strike team was operating here?<eos> Without permission?
I'm good.<eos> I can't remember a time when I wasn't fighting Israel.<eos> As a boy in Gaza, I threw rocks at soldiers.<eos> As I grew, so did the weapons.<eos> The rocks became guns, the guns became rockets.<eos> For me, life is war.<eos> And that war changed with the creation of the Iron Dome, the most advanced missile defense system in history.<eos> Over 1,200 of our rockets were intercepted.<eos> The NMB realized that the best way to defeat a superior technology is to turn an engineering designer.<eos> James Maddox.
What fun!<eos> - What the hell is he doing here? - Oh, my God.<eos> You're--<eos> Just hoping the jackals and mongers will give you the time and space you need to settle in before they start feasting at your doorstep.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Robert, I know your dance card is full, but we have an appointment that I must insist you keep.<eos> The mustache is an interesting choice, sort of a Grover Cleveland look, I suppose.<eos> Marlin, call security. No, just... give us a moment.<eos> You and I are even.<eos> - Not quite.
Really?<eos> Can we not talk about my mother right now?<eos> Yes, I will have some champagne.<eos> You should not have any champagne.<eos> We are going straight to the hospital.<eos> Uh, club soda?<eos> - Same for me, please, Katie. Thank you.<eos> - Coming right up.<eos> Welcome, welcome. Here are your charts.<eos> Dr. Avery.
I guess what I'm asking is, are you happy?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> No.<eos> Not "of course."<eos> I'm happy.<eos> Are you?<eos> Honestly, yeah. Yeah, I am.<eos> But for me, the whole Avery thing... I just couldn't do it.<eos> If it works for you, great.<eos> For me...
Get out! It's a trap!<eos> Just before detonation.<eos> I should've figured this out sooner.<eos> Don't do this, all right?<eos> You got people out.<eos> 12 agents are dead, Kurt.<eos> None of us saw that coming.<eos> Shepherd... Shepherd never wanted to destroy the power grid.<eos> No, she wanted to destroy the team.<eos> Yeah, but not all of us.
I just... I thought that Shepherd might've...<eos> Where... Where's the rest of the team?<eos> Reade had to have emergency surgery.<eos> He's in recovery now.<eos> Jane, we lost a lot of agents.<eos> No, where's Patterson?<eos> Patterson was here during the attack.<eos> No, where's Patterson right now?<eos> Talked to her a little while ago. She went to go check on Borden.<eos> Borden?
No, where's Patterson?<eos> Patterson was here during the attack.<eos> No, where's Patterson right now?<eos> Talked to her a little while ago. She went to go check on Borden.<eos> Borden?<eos> Borden is a mole for Sandstorm.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He doesn't work for us. He works for Shepherd.<eos> For how long?<eos> From the beginning.
But I need you to trust me.<eos> Can you describe where you're at?<eos> "The best eggs you've ever had."<eos> What do you mean?<eos> That's the slogan for Loui's. It's a diner chain.<eos> Hey, Roman, are you in a diner?<eos> Is there... is there anything else you can see?<eos> There are four diner locations and 18 billboards with that tagline in our search radius.<eos> Or maybe a... A landmark?<eos> 9D 8203 1000.
Why? Why would she do this?<eos> Why would she want to hurt me?<eos> Because she's a terrible person.<eos> And when we were little, she took us from an orphanage, and now she is the leader of terrorist organization.<eos> Did she take your friend?<eos> A man who works with her did.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You can help us get her back.<eos> Please, tell her what you know.<eos> For your own sake, just...
Okay, this guy right here, the one Roman "forked"... he texted Borden and 15 others late last night.<eos> But the message... it just looks like spam.<eos> It's in some kind of code.<eos> I tried running it against Patterson's system, but I got nowhere.<eos> So I'd really love your help.<eos> I'll try my code breaking program.<eos> Knowing Sandstorm, I doubt it'll be a straightforward encryption.<eos> A message of this size could take weeks to crack, and if it needs an outside key, well, be more or less impossible.<eos> Hang on a minute, where was that book found?<eos> Borden's apartment.
It's Murphy.<eos> I-I need Dr. Robbins.<eos> There's a laboring mom on her way.<eos> Um, tell me if you hear anything, okay?<eos> Uh, what?<eos> Oh, you guys haven't heard about Karev?<eos> Hey, um, Wilson.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> Well, uh, about Karev.
Is that the femoral head inside the pelvis?<eos> The pelvis is broken, trapping the baby's head.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Mindy, we're gonna take you for some CT scans.<eos> I want to check for other internal injuries, okay?<eos> I'll meet you there. If she starts to decompensate...<eos> I will head right to the O.R.<eos> What do we got?<eos> Bryan Wallace, 36, conscious status post T-bone MVC,<eos> G.C.S. 15, minor lacs.
- Idiots.<eos> - I think we'll page plastics.<eos> Okay, we're gonna do a C-section right away. Oh, God. Okay.<eos> Wait. Is the baby...<eos> No, but you're bleeding internally, and that's not good for either of you.<eos> So we'll need to repair the bleeding, and then you'll need surgery to repair the hip fractures.<eos> Okay. And I'll... I'll be unconscious the whole time?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> No, but can Bryan be there?<eos> For the baby?
- I'm afraid...<eos> - Of course he can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He cannot be in that room.<eos> He'll just be there for the C, and then he'll go, before we do repairs, just like a regular delivery.<eos> It's not a regular delivery.<eos> Well, it's the only one that they get, and I made this happen.<eos> What?<eos> I told her to put her feet on the dashboard, and I made this so, so much worse for them. Look, please let me make this one thing better.<eos> Just for the birth.
You should go on the website. I have been on the website.<eos> I've been all over the website.<eos> That's why I came here to talk to someone in person.<eos> Can you please help me?<eos> - Please?<eos> - Give me the info.<eos> It's Karev.<eos> - Where's the Social?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> The Social Security Number.
Uh, when can I see her?<eos> Is she...<eos> When will she wake up?<eos> Will she wake up?<eos> We don't know.<eos> We have to see how she responds.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> And the baby?<eos> Dr. Robbins has asked me to tell you... your baby is in surgery.<eos> Surgery?
Anything? Three counties, four jails... nothing.<eos> No one will tell me anything.<eos> Maybe they're still processing him?<eos> You'll find out tomorrow what happened.<eos> Well, I know what happened.<eos> He's gone. That's what happened.<eos> A hero is only human, but that's the point.<eos> If they can do it, so can you.<eos> Did Owen find Amelia?<eos> Amelia?
Everybody wants privacy for themselves.<eos> Do you have any idea how many places I've been looking for you?<eos> What the hell, Alex?<eos> You can't call? You can't text?<eos> What happened?<eos> For other people, not so much.
Yeah.<eos> - For you? - Yeah.<eos> - Why?<eos> - No clue.<eos> DeLuca.<eos> DeLuca, wait!<eos> So, you called a meeting, and they ignored it?<eos> How many attendings didn't show up?<eos> A few?<eos> Five?
What?<eos> What's it say?<eos> That you suspended Grey.<eos> Uh, Dr. Grey got herself suspended.<eos> What about Karev?<eos> What about him?<eos> He's in jail.<eos> You really don't have a line to the rumor mill, do you?<eos> Charges got dropped.<eos> No jail.

Where do you want me?<eos> Left arm. Just missed the brachial artery.<eos> She's losing her leg, huh? Yeah.<eos> Her foot has already developed gangrene.<eos> Wire disrupted the popliteal artery.<eos> Did a number on her abdominal wall, too.<eos> Can I get a 3-0 nylon, please?<eos> Yeah. You should close up the subcu first.<eos> Going with the Minnick method here?<eos> By necessity.
I just... I just think that Dr. Webber is the backbone...<eos> Save it. You're not gonna win a loyalty contest against me.<eos> You support Dr. Webber.<eos> I get it.<eos> That's your business.<eos> But my business is making sure this hospital runs.<eos> And right now, some people are making that very hard.<eos> So, it is tough-decision time, Kepner.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - On?
All good. Um, I do have a surgeon available with one, and I will just assign it to him.<eos> Great. Thanks. Sure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you know where Dr. Webber is?<eos> Did April say anything? Like why she jumped ship?<eos> I haven't seen her. She was home late and out early.<eos> Oh, she's slinking, then.<eos> She knows what she did.<eos> She's slinking. Traitor.<eos> No offense.
now we're losing April... and we don't have the residents.<eos> They love Minnick. And she's about to start phase two of her program.<eos> Phase two?<eos> A resident gets to be the primary surgeon on their own case.<eos> One procedure, pre-op to post-op, start to finish.<eos> Under supervision, right?<eos> Yeah, but the resident does it all.<eos> The attending is there to assist.<eos> The resident?<eos> Start to finish, baby!
One of us needs to talk to my mother about this, and I know what you're gonna say, all right?<eos> And I don't care how it looks ...Jackson, she knows.<eos> Sh... she knew before anyone.<eos> She's not with us.<eos> No, sh... this was my mother's idea?<eos> I thought this was Bailey's... so did I.<eos> But, no, Bailey decided I didn't need... you should stop talking right now.<eos> Dr. Webber.<eos> Oh, need something, Warren?<eos> Well, um... well, you, sir.
Just... Shut your face.<eos> Maggie!<eos> I thought you were with us.<eos> I thought you were with Richard.<eos> And then you go and do this?<eos> I took a job!<eos> It was an opportunity!<eos> It's aiding the enemy!<eos> I'm not saying I agree with what Bailey did... but you are saying that it's not a deal-breaker!<eos> Not for you.
Riggs finishing up the cardio consult at bed 5, but I think it's gonna be...<eos> Make it hurt... They make...<eos> They make it hurt.<eos> Ma'am, can I help you?<eos> No.<eos> No help.<eos> There's no help out there.<eos> They... they come and they go and they crack the whip.<eos> Who's, uh...?<eos> Uh, I-I... No help.
Wait, actual Camp David?<eos> Well, she's gone.<eos> Maybe you can steal her job, too.<eos> You paged me for a temp pacemaker?<eos> Yeah, she needs a permanent one, but can't get consent, so...<eos> Well, you need approval? You got it.<eos> What is she, intoxicated or something?<eos> Jane Doe, no I.D. She's confused and disoriented to the time and place.<eos> Ma'am, can you tell me your name?<eos> No, no names.
Did something happen?<eos> Listen, do you need me to call security, or... I just...<eos> I need him to go away, please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Excuse me, sir, um, you've been asked to leave the premises, so if you can follow me...<eos> I'm not bugging anyone, I'm not hurting anyone.<eos> I have every right to be here.<eos> Sir, do you want me to call security?<eos> - Because I need you to leave.<eos> - Oh! This again!
What's the legal on that?<eos> The mom signed the paperwork. It's past the red line.<eos> It belongs to the kid.<eos> No, it doesn't, not until it's put into him.<eos> - It was about to go in.<eos> - So, there's no formal protocol?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> I mean, this is not a thing that happens.<eos> - This is... - This is a first.<eos> - So, no rule book.
I'm here if you need me.<eos> Well, this looks like the residents pulled it off without a hitch.<eos> You missed a few hitches.<eos> I went and talked to Grey.<eos> She coming back?<eos> No, she is not.<eos> Bailey, you...<eos> You are ridiculous.<eos> You're not just costing Meredith time and money, you're costing yourself and the hospital.<eos> Oh, no, not me.
I know when flap coverage is warranted and when it isn't.<eos> And another bickering family.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Warren, did you say something?<eos> Uh, I said I'm gonna go book an O.R.<eos> - Okay, well, hop to it, then. - Well, hurry up, then.<eos> - Get going, child. - Come on. Let's get this.<eos> Sister Agnes is good to go.<eos> It went great.<eos> In, out, no problem.
- Pupils are sluggish.<eos> I didn't realize you were back.<eos> There's no other obvious injuries. I'm gonna need to see those trauma films.<eos> I just stopped by for, uh, some stuff.<eos> - Stuff?<eos> - Stuff.<eos> I was shopping, odds and ends. I needed floss and realized I had a bunch here.<eos> Then this guy pulled up.<eos> Positive Babinski.<eos> Floss.
Seven. O.R. 7, if it's available.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I got good news... great news.<eos> - So, try not to let it piss you off.<eos> - Just tell me. We got a heart for the Endris baby, a perfect match.<eos> How?<eos> He's not even on the list.<eos> Well, I put him on the list.<eos> Without... Without telling me?<eos> Without the parents' consent?
Here we go. Hi!<eos> Hi.<eos> What's the matter? What's wrong?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> Everything's great, sweetie.<eos> Uh, you know what? I'm gonna let you get some rest, and, um, we'll talk tomorrow.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> See you then.<eos> - Here you go, Ms. Pierce.<eos> Oh, wha... no need for special treatment.
Not to care?<eos> Not to give up so easily?<eos> Not to fall in love?<eos> Not to have children?<eos> Not to tell a lie?<eos> She left me wondering what to do, what not to do.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What?<eos> She left me knowing everything was up to me.<eos> And me alone.
Seriously?<eos> I'm retiring. You're starting. It's fitting.<eos> Now it's your turn to carry it.<eos> Oh, I haven't done anything yet.<eos> I hadn't, either.<eos> This will force you to, okay?<eos> Let's make the most of my two weeks left of mentoring.<eos> Take notes on this deposition.<eos> Afterwards, I'll ask you what you think we should offer as a settlement.<eos> Lucca.

Hello.<eos> I didn't know you joined Reddick and Boseman.<eos> Four months ago. Oh.
There was no other footage before this moment?<eos> Diane, what do you have?<eos> Let's not sandbag here.<eos> Did you know that your video has metadata attached to it?<eos> Even if you try to erase it, the metadata tells us that there is one minute and 20 seconds missing from the head of it.<eos> Objection!<eos> Well?<eos> $4 million.<eos> Why?<eos> The video.
Come on, I'm bad at it.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> You scare me.<eos> Not with Diane.<eos> - She'll know.<eos> - You are robbing the taxpayers!<eos> No, Diane, no, you're implying that this so-called missing video shows something nefarious.<eos> I'm not saying anything other than what the police report states.<eos> Come on, Diane, you know you have to give up something.<eos> $140,000.
Seriously... gun to its head?<eos> How nice to be able to talk in metaphors when people like our clients have a literal gun to their head.<eos> Look, Diane. I understand you want to impress your new client with your toughness, but look at the optics.<eos> You got three cops, three white cops kicking the crap out of this defenseless kid.<eos> Yes, this poor, innocent car thief.<eos> So that's your strategy? Blame the victim?<eos> No, this is our strategy.<eos> Your firm has personally enriched itself to the tune of $180 million with these police brutality cases.<eos> You are robbing the tax dollars coming from the city's most vulnerable<eos> African-American communities...
Please give your name and occupation for the record, sir.<eos> Andrew Theroux. CPD, three years on duty.<eos> Is this you on the video, sir?<eos> Yeah, but that's not the whole thing.<eos> You'll get a chance to explain. What is that?<eos> My uniform.<eos> No, that...<eos> There.<eos> Oh. Uh, my bodycam.<eos> Your IP68.
Ms. Rindell.<eos> I have nothing to do with...<eos> No, I'm Yesha Mancini.<eos> I'm your lawyer.<eos> How old are you?<eos> Does that matter?<eos> It can.<eos> Twenty-five.<eos> And you've been a lawyer for?<eos> Six months.
- Mr. Stack.<eos> - Yes, hi.<eos> How are you, Diane? I'm well.<eos> I, um...<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> Why, didn't you give your name?<eos> Well, I was worried you wouldn't want me as a client.<eos> I wanted to get a chance to argue my case. That's crazy.<eos> Why wouldn't I want you as a client?<eos> Bitcoin.
Don't ask me how I know that.<eos> This code... is identical.<eos> It's been injected into ETB Energy and will cause a Chicago blackout in nine hours.<eos> And why is it on your computer? I don't know.<eos> I encrypt everything.<eos> I run all my net contacts through eight, 10 servers.<eos> Nothing viral ends up on my hard drive. And yet, I woke up this morning, and there it was.<eos> Somebody put this code on my laptop, and wants me to be arrested for cyber terrorism.<eos> How much are your retainers?<eos> Um, for clients?
- He's the hacker?<eos> - We think so.<eos> Why won't he talk to you two?<eos> - I'm black.<eos> - I'm Jewish.<eos> - Dear God.<eos> - Hey, sucks!<eos> We don't want the old way!<eos> This way, this way.<eos> No speech, no hate! No speech, no hate! No speech, no hate!
Guess who the victim is?<eos> There were several speaking engagements canceled.<eos> I'd like you to sue them, too.<eos> You know, I can't sue all of them.<eos> We'll prioritize.<eos> You do realize you made a joke about school shootings?<eos> Yes, but I didn't commit a school shooting, no matter how annoying my gender studies professors were.<eos> There was nothing in those contracts about what I can say and what I can't.<eos> All right, let's move on to the next issue.<eos> My issue.
- I'm sorry, Diane.<eos> Do I have any reserves?<eos> If you sell your apartment.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Well, you can always talk to your new partners, and see if they'll offer you a loan.<eos> We tried to call you at home. - Because?<eos> - We're moving you down the hall.<eos> There's a new partner.<eos> We have to make room.<eos> Diane?
- That's right.<eos> Well, I hope I didn't embarrass myself too much.<eos> Not too much.<eos> Diane Lockhart.<eos> I feel like we acquired our very own Jimmy Butler right here.<eos> - Adrian, how are you?<eos> - Good, good.<eos> A little gift for you.<eos> Spring Arbor Lake Wine, my very own label, 2006.<eos> Mwah.
When Alicia hired me,<eos> I was supposed to be involved in cases and everything, but it's been all moving boxes since she left.<eos> Still want this?<eos> Definitely.<eos> And, where do you want these?<eos> - What are those?<eos> - African masks.<eos> Well, I can see that.<eos> Where are they from?<eos> Your office.
No, excuse me, sir, you'll have your chance.<eos> Um, this is a massive, $12 billion company stealing half my client's pay.<eos> Stealing, really? We have his confession on the record.<eos> No, he was forced to confess.<eos> - He was told if he did not confess...<eos> - He was not told anything.<eos> If he did not confess, then he would be fired.<eos> Frank, how long did this man question you?<eos> - Seven hours.<eos> - Without break.
And she's motivated.<eos> - That Rindell kid? - Yes.<eos> Sure.<eos> Everybody hates her.<eos> Great way to mold a fighter. All right.<eos> There may not even be a job here.<eos> I just want to warn you.<eos> You're here for the assistant position?<eos> Come on in...<eos> Daniela?
Good.<eos> Women are taking over the world, piece by piece.<eos> Um, I'm wondering if you and I could talk sometime, Lucca.<eos> We can talk right now.<eos> Well, I-I just hate doing it here in a public place, but...<eos> So, what's the offer?<eos> Offer?<eos> No, I-I just wanted to know where you got your hair cut.<eos> I just, I love the bangs so much.<eos> A friend of mine.
Diane.<eos> You didn't like any of the applicants?<eos> For the assistant's job?<eos> No, I did. It's just that I know Marissa, and she's on the ball.<eos> She's good.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is our offer.<eos> $500,000 to Frank Gwinn.<eos> No class action.
How was the drive?<eos> Fantastic.<eos> - My radio broke around Tallahassee.<eos> - Aw. But is there a better entertainment source than the billboards of America?<eos> Apparently, syphilis is making a comeback.<eos> Plus, you had me to keep you company.<eos> Lorraine?<eos> Lorraine was my babysitter growing up.<eos> She was also my first crush and also the star of my first, um...<eos> "funny dream."
It was Keifth.<eos> When I first moved here, I was just a young Missouri hayseed.<eos> I-I bought a ticket to the circus one day, and there in the middle of all the action, in an impeccably pressed tuxedo, was Ringmaster Keifth.<eos> I started hanging out at circus bars until we met.<eos> The attraction was immediate.<eos> He was older, always in command of a room, which makes sense because a room is just a permanent tent.<eos> We dated for six months.<eos> He transformed me into the sophisticate that we all know today.<eos> And then, he suddenly disappeared.<eos> No goodbye. No note.
Besides, we don't even know if the concierge is actually Keifth.<eos> I'm gonna forget the velvety baritone that abandoned me in the middle of the night?<eos> And plus, he walks in here, I lose it, I don't want Lily to see that.<eos> Oh, she's not here.<eos> She has that sleepover, and she already leffffth.<eos> Without saying goodbye?<eos> Then it hit me.<eos> It could be therapeutic for Cam to see this ridiculously named circus person who deserted him because that incident could be the very root of his pretty intense abandonment issues... which are not unchallenging.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - To the bathroom.
Maybe it's worth exploring why the idea of your dad remarrying is setting you off like this.<eos> Maybe it's worth exploring why you find so much joy in tearing people down.<eos> In previous generations, they accused people like that of being witches and threw water at them to see if they screamed.<eos> Great.<eos> Aah! Witch.<eos> Ah, Mr. Pritchett I presume.<eos> Hi. Thank you so much for coming.<eos> I'm not sure I caught your name.<eos> - Keifth Banks.<eos> - Yes. At your...
She got Lucca's office. I don't want to lose Lucca.<eos> She needs to feel needed.<eos> See, here's the problem with power.<eos> You got to take it from somebody to give it to somebody else.<eos> Thank you, Sun Tzu.<eos> Barbara.<eos> Be nice to Diane.<eos> Don't rule it over her like that?<eos> Do I question your leadership?<eos> All the time.
It's Andrew Hart.<eos> I thought he went out of business.<eos> He runs a 12-man operation<eos> - on the Gold Coast. - 12 men?<eos> Is he fucking kidding?<eos> We have 80 lawyers here.<eos> It's minority-owned?<eos> Yes. They just moved here from D.C.<eos> So it's about their government connections?<eos> My guess?
Your Honor, this operation cannot happen.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You have three and a half hours to present evidence.<eos> Stop arguing and get me the evidence.<eos> Marissa, it's an emergency.<eos> I need a witness from the Medical Licensing Board right now.<eos> Yeah, where do you want him or her, this witness?<eos> Okay, I'm on it, I'm on it.<eos> W-What do you need?<eos> The investigator.
- Um... don't you mean by that, Dr. Mara...<eos> I think the doctor can speak for himself, Counselor.<eos> How do you know the patient is an ISIS fighter?<eos> Doctor?<eos> I... I may have misspoke.<eos> But you know the patient is an ISIS fighter?<eos> Doctor, answer the question.<eos> I do.<eos> And how do you know the patient is an ISIS fighter?<eos> From the AUSA.
She got you there, Mr. AUSA.<eos> The kimono is opened.<eos> We'll-we'll need a few hours to gather this information.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Dr. Picot's patient will be dead in two hours.<eos> Who is he?<eos> He is Tariq Aboulafia.<eos> Thank you.<eos> A citizen of Syria?<eos> No. The United States.
Yep, your charm is that irresistible.<eos> - You want to know what I think?<eos> - Can't wait.<eos> I think you couldn't wait to see me again, and that's why the burger's already cut in half.<eos> You got me.<eos> This is a bad habit, isn't it?<eos> You teasing me, me grinning and teasing you back?<eos> It's easy.<eos> As opposed to?<eos> The truth?
You got me.<eos> This is a bad habit, isn't it?<eos> You teasing me, me grinning and teasing you back?<eos> It's easy.<eos> As opposed to?<eos> The truth?<eos> This should be interesting.<eos> Go.<eos> Last year, I went to see a, uh, therapist.<eos> Dr. Gilbert.
Let's all take our seats please.<eos> I've read your briefs.<eos> I know there's a lot of passion...<eos> Let me see your phone.<eos> It's... it's not my phone, Your Honor.<eos> It's, uh... it's this watch.<eos> Let me see it.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> It's just a... just a... Hmm.<eos> Oh, sh...
Thank you.<eos> It's a lie.<eos> I'm not being fired.<eos> I just got a new Google alert.<eos> It says that you just bought $350,000 in jewelry.<eos> What? !<eos> What?<eos> ! It's my ex-boyfriend.<eos> He's at it again.<eos> _ Diane.
I don't know where you got this quote, but there's not a single word of it that is accurate.<eos> Really?<eos> And we spoke about my son?<eos> Why would we speak about my son?<eos> I asked you how he was.<eos> My son who died?<eos> You... asked me how he was?<eos> Yes. I didn't know that he had passed.<eos> How long was I in your office?<eos> Six minutes, approximately.
Did you try calling the store?<eos> What about this article about you visiting your father while he was awaiting trial?<eos> What did you guys talk about?<eos> That was a personal visit.<eos> I was there as well as Mr. Rindell's attorney, so...<eos> No, no, not that visit.<eos> I'm talking about the other two visits, when Maia went by herself.<eos> That's more fake news.<eos> - There were no other visits.<eos> - Yesha.
Diane?<eos> Someone is here to see you and he has a present.<eos> Danny, can I call you back?<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Do you want me to stay and take notes?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> She's... chatty.<eos> She is that.<eos> So how are you?<eos> Good.
Yes. I have a quick rebuttal witness.<eos> But it'll be really brief.<eos> I'm Vaughn Yenko. I am a co-executive producer on the show.<eos> Okay, so that means you're like a writer?<eos> But... yeah, mostly.<eos> Mr. Fisk insists that he put his episode online as a political statement.<eos> - Is that true?<eos> - Objection, Your Honor.<eos> Hearsay. I think this is a hearsay exception, Your Honor.<eos> Prior inconsistent statements. Yep.
It's like Immortal Technique rapped:<eos> So, that's what we need to do.<eos> Blow their mofo heads off.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tell me you have someone else in mind.<eos> What?<eos> Do you have another lawyer in mind?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Who?
- The episode he wrote.<eos> No, for the purpose of copyright, we wrote the episode.<eos> The studio and the network, we paid Mr. Fisk for a work for hire.<eos> Okay. Then let's discuss the episode you wrote.<eos> It must've been hard facing that blank page, sir.<eos> - What did Hemingway call it?<eos> - Objection, Your Honor.<eos> I guess I'd call it sarcastic badgering.<eos> Sustained.<eos> Unsarcastically.
- And didn't you order 23 episodes not at the beginning of the year, as you usually do, but after you decided you couldn't air Mr. Fisk's episode?<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> When we realized Mr. Fisk had put the episode online, we knew we needed an additional episode.<eos> Yeah, but this happened before he put the episode online.<eos> Objection.<eos> Counselor is testifying.<eos> Sustained.<eos> Okay, well, here is a memo to the show's writing staff, asking for an additional episode.<eos> Could you read the date there?<eos> November 18, 2016.
Say it again.<eos> I don't have a friend.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> That's your right.<eos> What?<eos> Please don't say you're gonna save me.<eos> No, I'm gonna kiss you.<eos> Then I'm gonna save you.<eos> I had a best friend.<eos> Who?
Not quite as many white faces as at my other law firms.<eos> Um, I have a little gift for you guys.<eos> Here you go.<eos> VoilÃ .<eos> Uh, pass those around both directions.<eos> He misspelled my name.<eos> He's bringing in 86 million a year.<eos> I'll teach him how to spell your name.<eos> Here is what I need.<eos> A term of service.
Have you ever seen a dead body in person?<eos> Yes.<eos> - How many?<eos> - Six.<eos> I've seen 12.<eos> Suicide bomb on a bus.<eos> I got to the scene just afterwards.<eos> It's weird how normal it was.<eos> - Can be.<eos> - Except for the kid.
- Why not?<eos> It's irrelevant.<eos> Really? Your politics are irrelevant to this?<eos> Mr. Boseman, you gave $8,564 to Hillary Clinton.<eos> Diane Lockhart, you gave...<eos> - Where'd you get that?<eos> - Public records.<eos> $18,860 to Hillary.<eos> Barbara Kolstad, you gave $23,000 to, wait, let me check... hmm, want to get this right.<eos> - Hmm. Hillary. - What about me?
I heard he's trying to keep from being kicked offline.<eos> Yeah, this stupid thing.<eos> They're trying to censor him.<eos> Oh, God, I hate that.<eos> - Is he fighting them anyway?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> Tell me how.<eos> How did you get this I.P. address?<eos> Uh, Staples's boyfriend.
You thought I leaked?<eos> You searched my office.<eos> No, we didn't know whether you leaked or...<eos> This is about Trump. This is about politics.<eos> Julius, this is about maintaining the integrity of this firm.<eos> No. I was loyal to you.<eos> I was the most loyal employee you had.<eos> We had to know who was leaking.<eos> And did you investigate Diane?<eos> Or Lucca?
Reddick/Boseman took an $800,000 bribe from a client.<eos> It might be in trouble.<eos> I don't want you to get in trouble.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Colin Morello was just in my office... warning me to stay away from the firm's finances because... we took an $800,000 bribe.<eos> That's what I told my dad.<eos> I know.<eos> Look, I know your first instinct would be to call him,<eos> - but for the firm...
Barbara, what do you think?<eos> About using race?<eos> Well, it is about race.<eos> Adrian Boseman.<eos> I'm an attorney with the firm of Reddick, Boseman Kolstad, the largest African-American firm in the Midwest.<eos> Named by American Lawyer as one of the top ten black firms in the country.<eos> You finished?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mr. Boseman, how long have you practiced law in Chicago?<eos> 35 years.
Hello?<eos> Civil court.<eos> - Taxpayers' money being spent.<eos> - Yes, sorry.<eos> Is it fair to say that... in an effort to gain some competitive advantage, you sought to have Adrian Boseman disbarred?<eos> Is it fair? No, it's not fair.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, is it fair to say that you tried calling. Reddick/Boseman clients to steal them away?<eos> No, that's not fair, either.<eos> - Not even a little bit?
You told me to hire an associate who, in turn, discovered evidence.<eos> No, I didn't. I told you more.<eos> - That's disbarrable.<eos> - Diane.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> We all know we get close to the line sometimes.<eos> Now, we try to stay on the right side of the law.<eos> You want to be a good lawyer, you need to get close to that line and you know that.<eos> This wasn't about being a good lawyer. This was about getting a new job.<eos> Not for you, for the Rindell kid, Diane.
This is my W-2 from last year.<eos> And, here.<eos> There, that number, what is that?<eos> Federal Tax I.D. Number.<eos> It's the same.<eos> Who are you, Rain Man?<eos> You should see me at the blackjack tables.<eos> Who's this W-2 from?<eos> My last job, Lockhart, Deckler...<eos> - Shit.
No, I did not authorize it.<eos> Yes, Senator, I understand you lost money.<eos> I've got the Sun-Times on line one.<eos> Tell them no comment.<eos> And Mike Kresteva's here.<eos> Have him come in and hold my calls.<eos> Yes.<eos> So that's what that does.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> What for?
I imagine Carl has told you about my issue.<eos> Well, I haven't told them yet.<eos> You know, we were discussing other business.<eos> Then I'll come back.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> We're gonna go into the conference room and let my, my partners discuss their work.<eos> And, Diane, will you join us, please?<eos> Certainly.<eos> He's here for two weeks and he's gone.<eos> Patience.
All I know is Paul Johnson, when he was 17 years old, was raped by your client, a certified pastor.<eos> And the Illinois civil statute of limitations for statutory rape is 20 years.<eos> I looked that up.<eos> I also know that you don't want this to go to trial.<eos> Pastor Jeremiah is a pastor.<eos> I mean, that's, like, already two strikes against him.<eos> And the liberals, they're gonna look at him and think he rapes kids.<eos> Hey, why don't you have him wear his collar in court, and then he'd really be fucked.<eos> What do you want, Mr. Kovac?<eos> Money.

Yes, you will.<eos> We won't call it that.<eos> We'll call it a pretrial settlement.<eos> And for our purposes...
I hope you understand.<eos> I know, I know, I know. Why don't you... put your ear to the ground.<eos> Mr. Reddick asked me to see what I could find out about this addict coming after Pastor Jeremiah.<eos> Go ahead and do it. But not too many billable hours.<eos> Understood.<eos> He did ask me about a likely head count for the vote on managing partner.<eos> Is that something you have a problem doing?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I just wanted to see how accurate you wanted me to be in what I report back to him.<eos> There but for the grace of God.
Theroux brought his load in last night.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> Good.<eos> Give us a half-hour with him.<eos> Are you my lawyers?<eos> We hope to be, Mr...<eos> Knutsen. Todd Knutsen.<eos> Look, I didn't do it.<eos> The cop just searched my car. When was this?<eos> Last night, about midnight.
To Hannigan?<eos> You're sure?<eos> This is temporary, Mike.<eos> You pull your money out now, you're out eight mil...<eos> Yes.<eos> My mom, she, she called Jax and he came over to tell Mike Hannigan that if he pulled his money from the Fund, then he would be out something like $8 million.<eos> And the best course was to keep his money in.<eos> And what time did Jax come by?<eos> I was still doing my homework.<eos> So... probably about 4:00 in the afternoon.
Excuse me, you're asking about something that happened nine years ago.<eos> I know.<eos> Look, I'm on your side in this.<eos> I know that memory can be faulty.<eos> I'm just trying to get to the truth.<eos> Maia.<eos> Were you there at the doctor's appointment?<eos> I was.<eos> Maybe I-I saw Jax - and Mr. Hannigan later.<eos> - Or another day, maybe? No.
We weren't interested in his client.<eos> We only asked him to come in for a how-do-you-do meeting.<eos> But this lawyer was so aggressive and so suspicious that we decided to probe further into his client.<eos> And that client is now in prison.<eos> Sweet story.<eos> - Well, it's a true one.<eos> - Are you advising me. Not to represent my client?<eos> Far from it.<eos> I think it would benefit both of us if Maia were to offer all she knows.<eos> Undiluted.

Not to represent my client?<eos> Far from it.<eos> I think it would benefit both of us if Maia were to offer all she knows.<eos> Undiluted.<eos> What do you need, Ms. Starkey?<eos> Well, I'd like to turn to the foundation.<eos> The... the Rindell Foundation.
Okay. Now, did you hear Ms. Lockhart offer any legal advice to your parents?<eos> Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there.<eos> - This is not material covered by the proffer.<eos> - Well, anything. That has to do with the Ponzi scheme is covered by the proffer.<eos> Hearsay conversations which, in fact, may be subject to attorney-client privilege are not...<eos> Actually, my current case is a homicide.<eos> My client is accused of killing a mutual fund manager who worked with Bernie Madoff.<eos> Ooh, really?<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Bernie?
We need to stop right there.<eos> You need to speak in hypotheticals,<eos> Mr. Sweeney.<eos> But... why? We can't put you on the stand knowing you will perjure yourself.<eos> You can only relate something that is true or potentially true.<eos> God, I love the law.<eos> And everybody takes it so seriously.<eos> - Your party?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Chemsex.
I gave over a million dollars to his campaign PAC. Membership has its privileges.<eos> So work your magic and make these charges go away.<eos> I need to look clean. Then get Hess to testify on your behalf.<eos> This drug testimony<eos> - from Theroux hurts you.<eos> - No. Find another way.<eos> Police brutality is your specialty, and I'm a bona fide victim here!<eos> It's not just the black people who get brutalized.<eos> It's people like me...<eos> The misunderstood.
Thank you.<eos> Mr. McGrath?<eos> Nothing further.<eos> The witness is dismissed.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's really not necessary.<eos> It's no big deal. - It's a SEC audit.<eos> - Of course it's a big deal. Come on.<eos> Jax.
That's "just kidding."<eos> It's what the kids say.<eos> I wanted to thank you for you help.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> And I wanted to let you know that no good deed goes unpunished.<eos> About an hour ago, some billionaire was named the next ambassador to Germany.<eos> I lost it.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - I can't believe I wasted. Four months trying to learn German.<eos> Ich.
Okay, then.<eos> I'll let you change.<eos> Regina, what were you thinking?<eos> How could you bring him here?<eos> You weren't there.<eos> He was miserable in his world, and... he wanted a fresh start, and I'm just trying to help him.<eos> But you don't know who he is.<eos> Looking like Robin Hood doesn't make him the same person.<eos> Trust me, I once kissed David's twin.<eos> World of difference.
- to kiss you right now.<eos> - Hang on!<eos> You're forgetting something.<eos> What's that?<eos> My superpower...<eos> I know when you're lying.<eos> What are you hiding from me?<eos> The truth is, um... I'm a bit out of sorts...<eos> - because of Archie.<eos> - Archie?
Not... Not really.<eos> Does the mother know that?<eos> Who even is the mother?<eos> You?<eos> My sister.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Apparently, everything here is complicated.<eos> Did you bring me here just to drop me in the middle of this mess?<eos> I hoped I could be a part of a fresh start.<eos> Your fresh start.

Tell me!<eos> I've come to bring you home.<eos> I don't want to go!<eos> My father wants me to be a knight.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> - James...<eos> - I don't want to kill things.<eos> What if I bring you to my home?<eos> It's green and nice there, and... you'll have a brother to play with and grow up with.<eos> A brother?
What are those?<eos> I found the part of my story I took out of the book.<eos> There's nothing in here I didn't already tell you, but... I figured David might like to have it for himself.<eos> Great. I'll pass them along.<eos> Time to die... drunk.<eos> Captain, he's getting away!<eos> What've we got here, then?<eos> A pale wee man? Surrounded by the king's gold.<eos> The winds of fortune are flying today, lads.<eos> For both of us.
I do enjoy coming in here whenever I get the chance.<eos> - It's just a room full of flowers. - Really?<eos> Is that all you see?<eos> Just tell me what you'd like so I can get started.<eos> Oh, well, I came in here thinking "carnations," but it looks like you might be running low.<eos> Except I ordered a shipment that just arrived.<eos> - I don't see it.<eos> - Look again.<eos> I've got a van full of carnations for... - Me.<eos> Thanks.
I thought you were leaving today.<eos> - We were supposed to.<eos> - Both our flights got canceled and they couldn't rebook until tomorrow morning.<eos> And you decided to share a taxi?<eos> Seemed like a waste to take two.<eos> Do you think we can get our same rooms?<eos> I'll make sure things are exactly the way they were before.<eos> Welcome back to Grey House. Thank you.<eos> - Uh, who are those for?<eos> - Oh. You.
- I'm not much of a tea drinker.<eos> Would you like to become one?<eos> Why not?<eos> That's pretty good.<eos> I brew a fresh pot every morning.<eos> Well, then I'm glad I ended up staying for one more day.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - You see this marble?<eos> - I'm supposed to get it<eos> - from here to there. - Oh.
- I hope you guys are good. - It's too late.<eos> You already hired us.<eos> I think we should have fire drills every day - in history class. - Un-huh?<eos> That way we might never have - to take the test.<eos> - Okay, would you stop worrying?<eos> I was ready for it three days ago and I'll be ready for it when it finally does happen.<eos> Except this time I'll be ready for it too when it happens tomorrow.<eos> - Oh, it's not happening tomorrow.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Um... No reason.
Is this what was taking up all your time when I was trying to get together?<eos> - I've been busy, I know.<eos> - Well, we're together now.<eos> Okay, sit. Sit.<eos> And I will go get your first course.<eos> Everything is perfect.<eos> That was the idea.<eos> The invitation said this is a dinner for two.<eos> - Invitation?<eos> - From who?
- City Hall? ! - Have you been arrested?<eos> - I'm on my way.<eos> - Be right there.<eos> Oh, what a shame you're missing your perfect evening.<eos> Okay, dinner is...<eos> What's going on?<eos> Sam and Cassie had to run.<eos> But we wouldn't want to let that meal and such a romantic setting go to waste.<eos> Table for two?<eos> Champagne?
- They made an excellent choice.<eos> - Except I turned them down.<eos> - What?<eos> - I took the interview because I wanted to find out if there was something better out there for me.<eos> And I realized I kind of like the job I already have.<eos> And then I found a book in your library about Seattle and it just made me realize I didn't want to leave my friends back home.<eos> You're from Seattle?<eos> - Annabel's whole family's from there.<eos> - And now Jim is moving there as well.<eos> - For a job, yeah.
Mm-hmm. I hear it's a lovely place to spend a couple of days.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey. How was your day?<eos> Well, I made it through without having to pick up my kid for breaking into City Hall.<eos> We are raising such delinquents.<eos> I'm glad you came by.<eos> Aside from last night, I feel like I haven't seen you all week.<eos> That's kind of true.<eos> I guess I got so busy trying to plan our perfect date, we could have just cancelled it and spent time together.<eos> - With no plans at all.
Well, if that's what it takes, then you can keep on doing that.<eos> But I'm letting you know that you don't have to.<eos> What if I want to?<eos> I'll never turn down flowers and a string quartet.<eos> When did that clock start working?<eos> Oh, it's been keeping good time for a couple of days.<eos> So, you got any plans tonight?<eos> No.<eos> You?<eos> Nope. None.
As mayor, my word is my bond.<eos> If I say that we're getting trees and swing sets, we're getting trees and swing sets!<eos> Except we have no money to get anything!<eos> - Of course we do.<eos> - No, we don't!<eos> You've been saying "yes" to so many things that the extra expenditure account is nearly empty.<eos> How much money do we have left?<eos> I shouldn't have said "nearly." There's nothing in it at all.<eos> You mean we can't buy anything?<eos> - Not even a new gavel.
Yeah, she had this sense... well, she called it her "flutter"... where she knew when things were going to turn out right or wrong.<eos> I think I'm going to like this movie.<eos> I think you're going to love it.<eos> Is it all right if I see the mayor tomorrow?<eos> There's something that I want to talk to her about.<eos> Is my daughter planning on changing the world?<eos> Just a small part of it.<eos> Well, I hope everything turns out the way you want it to.<eos> I have a feeling it might.<eos> For all of us.
I have a feeling it might.<eos> For all of us.<eos> Well, I guess we should go with candy bars then.<eos> What's standard?<eos> OK, sounds good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Who were you talking to?<eos> I'm doing concessions for opening night at the theatre so just ordering snacks.<eos> - Plain old snacks?<eos> - Movie stuff, yeah.
- It is.<eos> And don't you want him to know how much you love him?<eos> I always want him to know that.<eos> Well, if it were me...<eos> - You know what, never mind.<eos> - What?<eos> I just think anything "plain" is gonna seem like you hardly even tried.<eos> You know, you're kind of right.<eos> I just remember my high school graduation party, all my mother put out was tortilla chips.<eos> No salsa.
- It's supposed to be a great show.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jared.<eos> Hi.<eos> Um, is Mayor Tinsdale in today?<eos> I've been looking all over.<eos> No, she's at home, avoiding people.<eos> I mean, taking some personal time.<eos> Which is fine, you know, since it gives me some time to recycle<eos> - all these city budgets from years ago.
Yeah, I know it's a long shot, but do you happen to - have any light bulbs?<eos> - Ooh. I have candles.<eos> Yeah, I need a light bulb for my popcorn machine.<eos> I've been to three different stores!<eos> I can't find the right size.<eos> - What size do you need?<eos> - Well, uh... I need something that would fit perfectly into something like this.<eos> Same height, same size around...<eos> Oh, sorry, the only thing I have that fits in there is salt.<eos> - For the shaker.
Here you go.<eos> I'm sure she'll say yes.<eos> - Hey, Sam.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Need more candies for Eve? - Actually,<eos> I would like some more for me.<eos> Best lunch I had all week.<eos> Oh, well, I'll get you another box.<eos> - You sell a lot of these?<eos> - Every single day.
Now, first of all, I want to acknowledge Ben Patterson, whose determination and craftsmanship are the reasons all of us are here.<eos> Before we get to the lighting of the marquee, I wanted to make a special announcement.<eos> Many of you have been wondering when we'll be getting the new trees in front of city hall and I'm very pleased to announce that they are fully funded and will be planted next week.<eos> And I just placed an order for a new swing set for the park, which will be arriving very soon, as well, all because of the fortitude of one Middletonian who wishes to remain anonymous.<eos> So, now, everyone! If we can all move out here, please, for a better look.<eos> That's right, fill in. Here we are. Are we ready?<eos> Alright, then.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Three, two, one.<eos> Lights!
let's go to the movies, Middleton!<eos> What's this movie about, anyway?<eos> Oh, I think the title says it all.<eos> Well, I hope you're in the mood for a romantic comedy.<eos> - I actually am.<eos> - And I'm ready for this one to surprise me, for a change.<eos> You're a funny girl, Jenny.<eos> You read "Aesop's Fables"<eos> and you won't accept anything but candy, fruit, and flowers.<eos> And hospitality. Of the right sort.
Either way, one of you is gonna die.<eos> You realize... the cameras are recording all of this.<eos> Either way... one of them is gonna die.<eos> You have another visitor.<eos> I heard you poisoned a cop.<eos> Officer, we're done here.<eos> All right, here it is... Rutger's body-camera footage.<eos> I've cued it up to the good part.<eos> I think you will find it studdedly intriguing.<eos> Six pack.
After some debate, we decided to take a risk and investigate.<eos> So we're looking for Geonosians? No.<eos> You are looking for the team we already sent.<eos> We lost contact with them two cycles ago.<eos> Do you think it was the Empire?<eos> Unknown.<eos> Contact was lost after the team reported an energy source on the planet's surface.<eos> Energy source?<eos> When we went to Geonosis, there was nothing.<eos> No signs of life or power.
I know Saw would do the same for me.<eos> Okay, we'll keep going.<eos> But there's times I hate being right, and I hope this isn't one of 'em.<eos> I don't understand. Where did the rebels go?<eos> It's just a dead end.<eos> Do you have to call it that?<eos> Look!<eos> Are those Geonosians?<eos> Not Geonosians.<eos> Clankers.
We're closing in on the power source. It's just up ahead.<eos> Whatever it is, it's big.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Look.<eos> Oh, I don't believe it.<eos> Spectre-5, what do you see?<eos> Hera, it's a shield generator.<eos> I didn't copy, Spectre-5.<eos> Did you say "shield generator"?<eos> Oh, yeah. Military grade.
You even look a bit like Brando.<eos> Circa the barefoot, stress-eating years.<eos> This is a big move, man.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Now hand it over.<eos> It's not gonna go cheap.<eos> Worth every penny.<eos> It's your funeral.<eos> Still no sign of Lucifer?
I'm totally bugging you.<eos> No, I love that sound.<eos> - Look, Detective, I had some family issues. And I-I went to Vegas to blow off some steam.<eos> One thing led to another, and...<eos> Look, I am sorry, I should've told you that I needed... time off.<eos> This isn't about vacation hours, this isn't about time cards, Lucifer, this...<eos> How could you just...?<eos> I thought we were...<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> Friends?
I thought we were...<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> Friends?<eos> Yes. Friends, that's exactly what we are.<eos> Just friends.<eos> Right. Right.<eos> So it's all sorted then, we'll go back to the way it was.<eos> Great. You know, before...<eos> Yes, I get it!<eos> - Hey.
It's called "acting as if."<eos> Yes. Yes, well done, Candy.<eos> I think I know exactly how to get back on the case.<eos> Oh, gosh, I wish I'd talked to you earlier.<eos> Saved myself a trip.<eos> Have a candy, Candy.<eos> Badnews,Chloe.<eos> Ash's mediator won't talk.<eos> Well, because he's a lawyer.<eos> Yep, not without a warrant.
We need to work together on this.<eos> We're so close now.<eos> Are we, Mom?<eos> Because our return home hinges on Lucifer being able to control his emotions.<eos> You've no faith in me, brother?<eos> Good. Means I get to prove you wrong.<eos> So the three of you plan to use this... Flaming Sword to cut through the Gates of Heaven and go home?<eos> That's the plan, yes.<eos> Do you mean actual gates?<eos> Like big and pearly?
Look at this e-mail.<eos> Why are you being invited to a "grieving gathering" at Starford Academy?<eos> 'Cause Trixie's being considered for admission.<eos> Apparently, she impressed some of the teachers there.<eos> Or they were impressed with Lucifer's bank account.<eos> It's probably the only thing they care about at that pretentious place.<eos> Well, I mean, it is non-traditional, that's for sure.<eos> Wait, are you actually considering it?<eos> I mean, don't you think that with the divorce and the move and everything that Trixie's had enough<eos> - big changes lately?
Never seen you so worried about an outfit, Decker.<eos> Not picking up the first coat off the floor as usual?<eos> Nope.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I am going to a grieving gathering at the school, and, well, you should see the other parents.<eos> They are very fancy.<eos> It's...<eos> You know what?<eos> Never mind. I don't want to make you sick<eos> - with my feelings.
Mom!<eos> That's enough!<eos> I'm not broken.<eos> The sword must be.<eos> Okay, then we'll fix it.<eos> There's plenty of time.<eos> Of course.<eos> You're right, son.<eos> There's plenty of time.<eos> Just not for me.
- Previously on Lucifer...<eos> - Everything I felt for her was smoke and mirrors, courtesy of Dad.<eos> Did you sleep with me to get intel on this case?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> You don't let your girl go into enemy territory alone.<eos> The piece is here.<eos> My last words were a clue. A clue?<eos> A clue to what?
Hello, my son.<eos> Right, yes, I suppose that would be the standard way to greet your children.<eos> Nice touch.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Well, it's what I can do for you that's exciting.<eos> See, I can reveal the truth about the Supreme Being you've chosen to impersonate.<eos> I bet you wanted to be God because. He's benevolent, all-powerful, yada yada. But in actual fact, He's a dick.<eos> Look, if you want to be angry with me, you just go right on ahead.<eos> I can be anything you need me to be.<eos> Right, enough of this idle chit-chat.
I'm good. Why not?<eos> You and I are flowing, Chlo. Same page.<eos> Nope. Different books altogether.<eos> You crack me up, Decker.<eos> My God, Chloe, this song is so good.<eos> People seemed to really like it... in 1995.<eos> My God, and the music video.<eos> What's going on?<eos> So, um, by chance, have you found any evidence pointing to, um...<eos> Santa Claus?
What?<eos> It worked in the movie.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> With Dad here on Earth, I don't need the Flaming Sword or a trip to Heaven to exact my revenge.<eos> Okay, but how is having them fall in love again revenge?<eos> Trust me, Doctor, after a brief re-honeymoon period, they'll start torturing each other like they always do.<eos> Mum and Dad together are their own worst punishment.<eos> It's genius.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Only since the beginning of time.
Yes, I know. Maze has very eccentric tastes.<eos> I would, I would've made something if I had notice.<eos> You know. Any notice.<eos> No, no. I-It's great.<eos> You know, I like trying new things.<eos> - Meeting new people.<eos> - Are you gonna eat that?<eos> N-No. No.<eos> So, um, Maze. Where are you from?<eos> Hell.
There's not much time before we're gone.<eos> What, are you going on a vacation?<eos> I'm not sure I'd call what Lucifer, Mom and I are doing going a vacation, but...<eos> Lucifer didn't tell you.<eos> Tell me what?<eos> I told you never to lie to me again, Amenadiel.<eos> Tell me what?<eos> We're all going back to Heaven.<eos> So tell me, how, how do you have your job and stay sane?<eos> Years of practice, um...
I'm just gonna... Doctor.<eos> For the life of me, I can't even remember why we were fighting.<eos> The flames?<eos> Eternal damnation? The...<eos> Kind of hard to forget.<eos> I am so sorry that you suffered.<eos> Well, I su... suppose I should apologize for trying to destroy your precious toy with floods and with plagues and whatnot.<eos> I guess humanity isn't entirely awful.<eos> They did make vodka.<eos> Roller coasters.
Dad supposedly destroyed the Flaming Sword after the rebellion.<eos> So, are you saying he just broke it into two pieces?<eos> And this.<eos> Yes, which somehow ended up on Earth.<eos> Its power probably awakened when Azrael's blade ended up here, too.<eos> Which is when Mr. Johnson must've stumbled upon it.<eos> But why did he think he was father?<eos> Well, I mean, Azrael's blade inspired death.<eos> Maybe this piece activated the opposite... life.<eos> Healing.
What are you doing here?<eos> Ms. Ruiz there... is my client.<eos> Well, she's a real piece of work.<eos> Trying to make me jealous?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> You seduce me, you betray me, now you're back.<eos> You have to want something, I just can't figure out what.<eos> I do want something, you're right.<eos> And I'll tell you.<eos> Just somewhere private.
The detective and I will go, so thank you so much for your help.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> The invitation is under my name.<eos> I will go.<eos> Perhaps Detective Espinoza should join me.<eos> No. Yes, that's not happening.<eos> - Very well.<eos> I'll go with you... - No, I'll go with Charlotte.<eos> - But, Detective...<eos> - No more argument.
It's absurd.<eos> I won't stand for it.<eos> I am gonna find a way into that party.<eos> Do you always whine like this?<eos> I don't know how she puts up with it.<eos> Where's Dr. Linda?<eos> Suspended.<eos> Because of you.<eos> Because you have been a terrible, selfish friend.<eos> To her.
Well, gladly, once I figure a way back onto the case.<eos> No, Lucifer.<eos> But I suppose they can handle things without me for the time being.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> It'll take two hours to scan the phone.<eos> I'll come to you.<eos> I'll kill some time till it's done.<eos> See you soon.<eos> Hey, man. You looking for your brother?<eos> Or my m... um...
Sure.<eos> But for the greater good of our debauchery here in L.A.<eos> Did you even once think of how this affected her?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> Thought about how she might ruin everything by disemboweling my mum or castrating my brother.<eos> I meant her feelings. - What?<eos> - She thought... you abandoned her.<eos> That you didn't care how that affected her.<eos> But those sort of things never bothered her be... before.<eos> Mazikeen.
Well, my work here is done.<eos> Literally.<eos> So, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to find a very stiff martini.<eos> I'll take care of this.<eos> I promise.<eos> Has something happened?<eos> Yes.<eos> My son robbed and killed Zeke, as you know.<eos> But then he showed me what Zeke was smuggling.<eos> And for whom.
- Then let's make a deal.<eos> I'll give it to you if you get my son's phone from the police.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> You'll find a way.<eos> Otherwise, I'll make sure that what you want... disappears forever.<eos> Birthday reverse.<eos> Nope.<eos> Double 69.<eos> Oddly relieved that's not it.<eos> Ms. Lopez.
A knife.<eos> We already have...<eos> My life is ruined!<eos> I don't want to go to prison.<eos> This is all your fault!<eos> Who knew translating could be so exhausting.<eos> Listen, I think I found something.<eos> God shattered the Flaming Sword into three distinct pieces.<eos> "The Blade of Death."<eos> Azrael's.

Congrats on nabbing Queen Tequila.<eos> Well, Chet's still out there, so this isn't over.<eos> I need what Zeke really smuggled.<eos> My life is ruined!<eos> Hello?<eos> It's Charlotte Richards.<eos> I need a favor.<eos> Would you look at that, Luci?<eos> It really is the final piece.<eos> Unbelievable.
You don't have to speak in code.<eos> I can handle adult stuff.<eos> So what if your mother explodes?<eos> Why should I care?<eos> Because many, many humans could get hurt.<eos> Yeah, and?<eos> Oh, nice try, Maze, but I happen to know there's a few that you care about.<eos> Fine.<eos> But you pay me my standard fee.<eos> No freebies.
Aw, don't worry, buddy.<eos> I am a total klutz myself.<eos> Which is why I always make a backup.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Hope it leads us straight to Chet's killer.<eos> Oh, no, that's from another crime scene.<eos> I got a big steaming pile of nada from the Chet Ruiz crime scene.<eos> Oh, good... ness me, that is awful.<eos> Please tell me you have something.<eos> No, no, nothing.
Yes, but how do you know this parked van's even the same one?<eos> I mean, there's no license plates on this image.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> How many vans have dandelions on the side?<eos> They're not dandelions, they're jellyfish.<eos> What?<eos> Jellyfish?<eos> Right, yes.<eos> Well, I'm simply saying that we should be focusing on more pressing criminal issues.<eos> - Such as?
I thought you were done with that jerk.<eos> I was, till I ran into him at Jamba Juice.<eos> Understand completely.<eos> I mean, what's more intoxicating than a Mango-A-Go-Go?<eos> Alibi sorted.<eos> We'll leave you here with Soupy, and we'll be on our way.<eos> - Come on. - No. Wait, wait.<eos> Hold on. Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Enough with this.
Why are you still hiding things from me after all we've been through?<eos> You know I don't lie, Detective.<eos> But you also don't tell the whole truth.<eos> Does this have to do with what you were upset about this morning, with your family?<eos> Yes, but I can't explain, because you wouldn't understand.<eos> Not if you don't talk to me.<eos> Never mind.<eos> I thought we were past this.<eos> Going backwards, Lucifer, is not good.<eos> For anyone.
Yes. Well, interesting story, actually.<eos> Why don't you tell her, Brother?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This one's all you.<eos> Brother, I insist.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, uh, upon careful consideration, we've decided this whole Flaming Sword plan is a crap idea.<eos> Yes, crap.<eos> Have you ever considered finding, well, I don't know, a-a place of your own?<eos> Yeah. Somewhere away from Dad, maybe?
Thank you, Pamela.<eos> I don't want to know how you did it or what it says about the fate of our country that you were able to, but I wanna thank you for getting the President of the United States to pardon me.<eos> As my grandmother used to say, it's good to have friends in low places.<eos> When Dembe said you had a case, I thought, how quaint.<eos> It's not.<eos> You looked at the photos I sent.<eos> Yes.<eos> Judge Culpepper was above reproach, which means many people would like her dead, but none I could connect to you in any way.<eos> I've looked at every case file from my time at the Mobile Psych Unit, and no suspect's an obvious match.<eos> Any leads off the diorama?
Maggie's mind is... different.<eos> She suffers from what doctors call a constellation of birth defects, the result of fetal rubella.<eos> Heart problems, hearing impairment, any number of developmental issues.<eos> But I feel like she understands more than they think.<eos> Just because she can't talk doesn't mean she has nothing to say.<eos> Maggie's visions, when did they start?<eos> February, two years ago.<eos> She drew me a picture, this terrible image.<eos> A train and a bus crashing.<eos> Bodies everywhere.
Get there.<eos> Interview everyone in the building.<eos> There could be hundreds of people.<eos> - You have a better idea?<eos> - Actually, yeah, I might.<eos> I think I can get us a step closer yet.<eos> I'm still getting interference.<eos> Is this really gonna help?<eos> We, uh, we need to unplug anything that might cause RF interference-- lights, appliances...<eos> Sorry.
I can hear.<eos> He's in there.<eos> Use this.<eos> It's untraceable.<eos> Would you ever do this?<eos> Betray your own boss?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Geoffroy, what are you doing here?<eos> Unfinished business, I'm afraid.<eos> What the hell?
You're Raymond Reddington.<eos> Yes.<eos> And this is my associate Dembe Zuma.<eos> Well, aren't you a tall drink of chocolate milk?<eos> I'd like you to work for me.<eos> Whatever Iniko was paying you, I'll double it.<eos> So you know, we only moonlight.<eos> A day job.<eos> How old-fashioned.<eos> Not really.
I think we know what his next target's gonna be.<eos> Aram, Farnsworth's gonna hit his own company.<eos> Yes, the trade was clear.<eos> Funds will be wired to the Panama account.<eos> Agent Ressler, I think I have something, a way Charnquist may be planning to access the building.<eos> Surveillance imagery shows an engine room on the roof,<eos> - and it is connected to a--<eos> - An elevator.<eos> - How'd you know that?<eos> - Because of the girl.
But as I don't believe in investing in anything I can't control, I declined.<eos> I know you've been concerned about me, about a killer knowing where I live.<eos> I just wanted you to know you've got nothing to worry about anymore.<eos> May I see your new apartment?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Maybe someday.<eos> I've been working on this, so let me know what you think.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Smells pretty good.<eos> All right, bon appétit.
I want this to work.<eos> And wondering whether or not that's possible is totally natural.<eos> But what isn't natural for me, anyway, is talking about that, so... it's my promise, to share this doubt with you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I threw those out this morning, yet here they are.<eos> Good.<eos> This is exactly where they belong.<eos> David...<eos> Lucas, and...<eos> Kaya.
His favorite app on his phone is "contacts."<eos> He's gonna shut this place down, and we're gonna get shipped off to separate precincts.<eos> I don't think our relationship can survive that.<eos> I mean, even if we don't work together, we can still be a couple.<eos> If I don't see you every day, I will forget who you are.<eos> I'm like a goldfish.<eos> Standing in the briefing room... a space that is approximately 50 feet by 40 feet.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> 55 feet by 40 feet.<eos> No, 52 feet by 41 feet.
Gina, you sure you can fit in?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Because of my injury, I can no longer fit in?<eos> No, I meant physically.<eos> I'll have you know, I am physically as strong as I've ever been... stronger even.<eos> I'm Gina Linetti, and I can do anything, okay?<eos> Excuse me, please. Excuse me.<eos> Oh, yeah, this is too crowded.<eos> Shouldn't have wasted my speech on this moment.<eos> To the evidence room.
This'll be fun, right?<eos> Pretending like we have things to be mad at each other about.<eos> Jake's chronic tardiness, his slobbiness, and the fact that he wasted half the morning deciding what sneakers to wear... those are just some of the reasons we're late.<eos> No one cares about your sneakers, Jake.<eos> Yeah, very convincing.<eos> We're just glad you guys made it.<eos> This is Rachel, my girlfriend.<eos> Hi.<eos> So Teddy said you guys had such a blast<eos> - at the stakeout.
Why did Diane want to be buried here?<eos> She's not from here.<eos> It's weird. Maybe so she could be close, so Maggie could do this.<eos> What's "this"?<eos> I mean, what does she get out of it?<eos> Don't ask me.<eos> Why do we have to know what's behind door number 3, even when we're pretty sure it'll be bad for us?<eos> I guess it's better than the way I did grief.<eos> Which time?<eos> The time with the oxy binges.
Not that one.<eos> Let's go to Exam 4...<eos> bigger, more comfortable.<eos> No. You don't have to do that.<eos> Well, if I can't pull strings for my friends, then...<eos> Hon, take the upgrade.<eos> How do you all know each other?<eos> Uh, Owen rebuilt my hand.<eos> He gave me a new leg and saved my hip.<eos> Not my spleen, though.
10-blade.<eos> You watching to see if Pierce melts down?<eos> No.<eos> I'm just interested. It's a very rare surgery.<eos> A tumor inside a fetus?<eos> Inside a womb inside a woman... yeah, it's like a nesting doll.<eos> It's like nesting dolls.<eos> It's fascinating.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Uh, yeah. Same.
Is she freezing? - No. - She can't.<eos> Riggs.<eos> Come on, Maggie.<eos> Move.<eos> Dr. Pierce, do something!<eos> The baby's heart rate's dropping.<eos> Well, go down there and do something.<eos> No.<eos> Just wait.<eos> All right, 0.1 of atropine.
It will. Just untwist it and try again.<eos> You have that needle inserted into his brain... - I told you.<eos> I've got the needle.<eos> - What if you don't? What if I slip and it goes right into his...<eos> Okay, just stop talking and do it.<eos> It's on.<eos> Okay. Good.<eos> Great. Okay. Evacuating again.<eos> Great. Only about 50 more times to go.<eos> Help!
You're so fearless about so many things.<eos> How the hell are you still scared?<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> One of the most unpredictable things about encountering turbulence is its aftermath.<eos> I'm making a choice.<eos> I'm prioritizing my family, my sister.<eos> Look, don't. Don't, please.<eos> Don't pretend this is still about Pierce. It's not.<eos> You're scared.<eos> Of what?
I told him not to page you away from some sick kid.<eos> Veronica's in a lot of pain. It's her back and everywhere.<eos> She can hardly walk.<eos> Hey, you try walking with a bowling ball attached to a body full of cancer.<eos> You're about 35 weeks now, right? 34 weeks, 3 days.<eos> Her husband's more informed than most.<eos> - Not her husband. - Not my husband. Just friends.<eos> - Oh, Jer, could you? - Oh.<eos> Your back pain... how long?<eos> Uh, about a week.
You know, we can always skip out on this if you want.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> This is great press for the hospital.<eos> Brings in more people, more money.<eos> Do you have any idea how much it costs to run this place?<eos> And I'm going to make the time to talk to Maggie today, too.<eos> Just make me the bad guy.<eos> Just tell her it was all me.<eos> No, I don't want to. I don't want to lie.<eos> ...the patients.
Oh, Mary, babe, you poor thing!<eos> Now, now, now. Hopefully it won't come to that.<eos> These things can... They can get better naturally.<eos> You got her hooked up to machines just to stay alive.<eos> That is an IV to keep her hydrated.<eos> Now, what can that be?<eos> I never thought I could fall in love so fast, but I've never felt like this about anyone.<eos> I'm so glad we found each other.<eos> Me too, dumpling.<eos> Every day.
So she's had these since we met?<eos> You... You could have ingested them - from unwashed fruit or...<eos> - Ugh. Just get them out.<eos> - The surgery... it's extremely simple.<eos> Um, DeLuca, let's book an O.R.<eos> - Uh, Dennis? - Hey. You can accompany her to the pre-op room.<eos> Uh... uh... Dennis?<eos> I can't. I, uh... I just have to, uh...<eos> I got to make a phone call and let your mom know that you're okay.<eos> And other people.

Dennis?<eos> I can't. I, uh... I just have to, uh...<eos> I got to make a phone call and let your mom know that you're okay.<eos> And other people.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Work.
Did you get the clot?<eos> Now, you see these clusters?<eos> Those were secondary boluses starting to form.<eos> We removed hundreds of them.<eos> They were breeding like crazy.<eos> Like babies.<eos> I wanted babies with Dennis, but now I'm a worm farm.<eos> Um, we'll monitor you, but I think that you'll be up and at 'em again in a few days.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mary?
So just do yourself a favor.<eos> That's all I'm saying.<eos> Here you go. Friend to friend. Yeah.<eos> Okay. Let's go fix people.<eos> Someone paged me.<eos> That was me.<eos> I need your help. Very urgent.<eos> - Great.<eos> Where we headed?<eos> - My place or yours. Tonight.
- Okay, yeah. - Okay.<eos> Hello?<eos> How's it going in there?<eos> Yeah, um, you know, it just occurred to me, uh, when you do the scan, you might see something weird.<eos> And I don't want you to freak out.<eos> Ah, don't worry about it.<eos> We've seen everything, Holly.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Uh, well, I've got a giant, inoperable heart tumor.<eos> Holy...
He's... He's seizing.<eos> Liam. Liam.<eos> Someone get something for his head! Two of lorazapam!<eos> And draw up a loading dose of Keppra!<eos> On it.<eos> So, you have some bleeding from a spleen laceration.<eos> We'd like to try and do something called a splenic embolization so that we can repair it without doing surgery.<eos> - All right. I'm in.<eos> - Surgery would only slow me down.<eos> Well, as for your heart tumor...
We took him to CT to see what's going on.<eos> Uh, David, Marie, Liam has a very large tumor.<eos> It's called a pituitary adenoma, and he's gonna need brain surgery.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Is that why he's been getting these headaches and why he's been so tired?<eos> When can we take him home?<eos> Well, that depends on how quickly the brain swelling goes down after surgery.<eos> Most patients can be released within...<eos> Uh, no, Liam won't have the surgery.<eos> Or anything else. No more needles, no scans.
Liam's gone? You let his parents take him home?<eos> ! He was my patient!<eos> We can't keep a minor for treatment against his parents' will, especially when that treatment goes against their religious beliefs.<eos> They have a right to those beliefs, and we have to respect that.<eos> Of course!<eos> But maybe... m... W-What if his tumor starts to bleed?<eos> What if he strokes out?<eos> They signed an AMA as soon as he woke up.<eos> Look, the kid took a train all by himself to ask us for help. Actual help.<eos> Not prayers and olive oil on his head.
If God did anything for Liam, God delivered him safely to us because He saw that He made you so weak and so stupid that you were going to kill your child.<eos> You're gonna burn in Hell.<eos> Based on what I saw today, she needs to be suspended...<eos> Well, hold on now...<eos> Well, did she injure the man?<eos> It doesn't matter. Does it matter?<eos> I-I just can't believe this. From Edwards?<eos> You can't?<eos> You yourself said her boyfriend died... a former patient of hers.<eos> No counseling, no support, no time off.
I need to find a guy.<eos> Uh, can you help me out?<eos> Okay, yeah, one second.<eos> The body adapts.<eos> It protects itself.<eos> But it can't close off completely or we're not really living, right?<eos> I reject fuzzy socks tonight.<eos> I need booze. Anyone want to get a drink?<eos> Yes. Please. And also, like, a man.<eos> Like a nice, new, attractive man.
But it can't close off completely or we're not really living, right?<eos> I reject fuzzy socks tonight.<eos> I need booze. Anyone want to get a drink?<eos> Yes. Please. And also, like, a man.<eos> Like a nice, new, attractive man.<eos> I don't want - to fall in love...<eos> - No, I don't want a boyfriend.<eos> You guys in?<eos> - I don't know. - Not tonight.<eos> No doctors.
You should figure it out. Why? Because prince charming's kiss is gonna wake her up?<eos> Prince charming has a grade-three liver lac that could kill him if he moves.<eos> - Cynic!<eos> - Cynic! That's not... whatever.<eos> Amelia. Okay, so this is fun. Owen is giving me the silent treatment now.<eos> No.<eos> Not you, me. I need your help.<eos> What?<eos> I invited him over tonight.<eos> Nathan?
She will land at Madigan.<eos> And then, we'll bring her here.<eos> We... we don't even know if it's her.<eos> Owen, Teddy knows her.<eos> I called Merritt Campbell.<eos> She's the best PTSD expert there is right now.<eos> She'll be here in the morning.<eos> Yeah, well, let's just wait and see how Megan is...<eos> Okay.<eos> For you, too.
Ah. Oh, sorry.<eos> I tho... I thought this was mine.<eos> Um, you going to the airport? You wanna split it?<eos> No, I'll...<eos> I'll let you have this one. I'll get the next one.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Airport, please.<eos> ICU is reserved for, uh, family only, so I'm gonna fudge it.<eos> Just follow my lead, okay?<eos> Brody, Brody, Brody.
We have a multiple-alarm fire on floors five and six, from the service elevators east.<eos> And we are concerned about structural damage on that floor.<eos> We're diverting all incoming traumas.<eos> Patients in immediate or impending danger need to be evacuated first.<eos> Unaffected areas... the E.R., radiology, nursery, daycare... they stay put.<eos> We have to prioritize.<eos> Firefighter Carroll here will be directing you to the most urgent areas.<eos> Yeah, and, uh, the woman with her arm in the air over there is Dr. Kepner.<eos> She is setting up a holding area...?<eos> Outside by Parking Lot 1.
I don't have it. My wife has my wallet.<eos> Our baby's upstairs for observation. Please!<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Y-You got to help me! I've looked everywhere. I went...<eos> I checked the... the cafeteria, the gift shop,<eos> I-I tried looking outside and looking there... What are you looking for?<eos> My daughter.<eos> Erin.<eos> She's missing again.<eos> Help.
We can make it.<eos> So we're stuck?<eos> No, we're not stuck.<eos> We are...<eos> We're gonna sit right here and put this over our heads, and we're gonna be just fine, I promise you. Come on. No.<eos> That's pulling the covers over your head.<eos> My mom said when things get scary, you don't do that.<eos> You turn on the light so the scary goes away.<eos> Listen, your mom is right.<eos> Usually.
I got a lot of ways to... to keep scary out.<eos> Is that my card?<eos> That's... That's my card!<eos> That is my card!<eos> No! Stephanie, don't leave me!<eos> No, it's okay. Don't leave me.<eos> It's okay. I'll be right back.<eos> I'll be right back. Keep your face covered, okay? All right?<eos> Erin, I am gonna be right back.<eos> Fists.

Put this over your face.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Stay here.<eos> Stay here. Don't move. Don't move.<eos> - Okay. Help us!<eos> Help! Help us! Somebody help!<eos> Here!<eos> Help!
Thank you.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Stay here.<eos> Stay here. Don't move. Don't move.<eos> - Okay. Help us!<eos> Help! Help us! Somebody help!<eos> Here!<eos> Help!<eos> Help!
For coffee. Yeah.<eos> What... What about it?<eos> Nathan, they found Megan.<eos> She's alive.<eos> That's not funny.<eos> The Army called Owen this morning.<eos> That's not funny.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Major Hunt.<eos> - Dr. Shepherd.
Father. I'm scared.<eos> It's okay.<eos> So am I.<eos> Priests get scared, too.<eos> I don't know if you know this, but I've known your mother a very long time.<eos> She loved coming here when she was younger.<eos> We all need an escape, and this was hers.<eos> You mean from my Dad.<eos> Maybe she was seeking someone who loved her unconditionally.<eos> You? Creep.

What's that? I told you to get blankets, not toys.<eos> Jay was there.<eos> Did he...<eos> I'm okay.<eos> What did he say to you?<eos> That he wasn't going to hurt me.<eos> You won't have to worry about Jay much longer.<eos> So does this mean there's nothing out there?<eos> Maybe it's 'cause the bodies are cold?<eos> What the hell?
Adrian.<eos> I need you to take these.<eos> If I don't come back, get to the mall.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm so relaxed right now.<eos> We gotta get up before Alex arrives.<eos> I know.<eos> What was that before?<eos> It's called sex.<eos> Jerk.
It's one of the many reasons I love you.<eos> It's my job to protect you.<eos> You know, when we met...<eos> When we met, I was weak.<eos> I'm not anymore.<eos> When we met, you needed me.<eos> I still need you. I just don't need you to save me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> East wing.
Previously on "The Mist"... Every act of destruction is an act of creation.<eos> That is why the Black Spring is here.<eos> If I see you touching her, I will put a bullet in whatever body part you touch her with.<eos> - What can I do?<eos> - Find me a room.<eos> - Hey! You can't do this!<eos> - Watch me.<eos> What do you think they're gonna say when they know you have your own supply?<eos> Help!
The other group, they're blaming you for Shelley's death.<eos> Shelley's dead?<eos> Wait, I don't understand.<eos> - Why would they? - Shh.<eos> They're looking for someone to blame.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> We need to hide until we can figure out a way out of here.<eos> You can't be out in the open.<eos> Trevor!<eos> Help! Help.
What are you doing here?<eos> I didn't think anyone was in here.<eos> Got caught up in all the shit outside.<eos> Hurt my leg.<eos> Figured I could find some supplies.<eos> You okay? Do you need help?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thanks.<eos> My name's Wes.<eos> Jonah.
"Now that Michael Jackson's dead, I can finally listen to all this Jermaine Jackson."<eos> - Ain't nobody say that. - Nobody said that.<eos> - Ain't nobody say that shit. - No one said that.<eos> Ain't nobody say that.<eos> I don't know. That punchline might be a little dated.<eos> - You think we need to update it?<eos> - I think we need to update the punchline.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Start over. - You want to start with what?<eos> - The middle.
I would like to show you a world without the War on Drugs.<eos> [stammering] Might I indulge you?<eos> All right, Nixon, we're in.<eos> So, wait.<eos> How are we gonna get there?<eos> I'm glad you asked.<eos> Like this!<eos> - [distorted voice] That's not so bad.<eos> - No doubt. Hey, man, where are we going first?<eos> Your living room?
So, wait.<eos> How are we gonna get there?<eos> I'm glad you asked.<eos> Like this!<eos> - [distorted voice] That's not so bad.<eos> - No doubt. Hey, man, where are we going first?<eos> Your living room?<eos> No.<eos> To none other than the saddest place in America:<eos> Chicago!
It's my dad.<eos> He just landed at JFK.<eos> Why is he in town?<eos> Clearly not to see his granddaughter. Work?<eos> Who the hell knows.<eos> Do me a favor. Try and keep the peace this time. Yeah, trust me.<eos> There's enough booze in that thing to have us both blackout drunk by halftime.<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> What time are you coming home?<eos> To my own house?
I don't think you're crazy, Meghan.<eos> You're not well, but...<eos> No.<eos> That's what he wants you to believe.<eos> He's got you all fooled.<eos> When I graduated from college, I got this job pumping gas out on the old road.<eos> There was this drive-thru burger place directly across the street.<eos> One night, this guy rolls up to the pumps...<eos> For the sake of the children in the room, I will say he abused the spirits and was away with the fairies.<eos> The fairies.
Oh, come on, Mom. Don't tell her that.<eos> You should join us one day when Kyle's feeling better.<eos> No, she doesn't do dinners.<eos> Attachment issues.<eos> No, you have to do it.<eos> - Jets got crushed.<eos> - How many lawyers does it take?<eos> Go Rangers.<eos> Who's he talking to?<eos> Nicky No Socks.
Now it's hard to hear her, but she just keeps repeating herself.<eos> I'm gonna hang up and have them transfer the call to you.<eos> I'm at 138 Morewood Road in Harriman Village.<eos> Please help me.<eos> My name is Meghan Womak.<eos> - I'm at 138 Morewood Road...<eos> - Meghan?<eos> - In Harriman Village.<eos> - Meghan, can you hear me?<eos> - Meghan?
What... what were you gonna do?<eos> Come on, Jules, don't... don't make me say it.<eos> Were you gonna kill him?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God. - Jules, you don't understand...<eos> Oh, my God, you can't...<eos> I don't have a choice right now, I swear to God, if I did...<eos> You don't? You don't have a choice?<eos> No, I don't have any evidence to arrest him, and nobody... nobody knows who he is except for me.<eos> - Except you? - Except for me.
- Hmm.<eos> So look, man, um... I just want...<eos> Sullivan, your Crown Vic parked in the motor pool?<eos> What's up?<eos> All precincts are accounting for their cars.<eos> What, you didn't hear?<eos> The hospital called the cops on a DUI that came in for a rush surgery last night.<eos> The guy admitted that he T-boned a Crown Vic.<eos> It had those flashing red lights behind the grill.<eos> No kidding.
Mommy said you might not be coming to dinner tonight.<eos> That's right, kiddo.<eos> I, um... I still have some things that I have to s... straighten out.<eos> But hey.<eos> You got to trust me.<eos> This is for your own good.<eos> Okay?<eos> Hey, Queens.<eos> We're gonna have to pick this up another time.<eos> Over and out.
- What about Raimy?<eos> She's the... she... she's never gonna have any idea, okay?<eos> But what if you get caught?<eos> Have you thought about that?<eos> About what it would do to her.<eos> Seeing your face on the news, sent to prison?<eos> That would haunt her for the rest of her life.<eos> You have a choice, and I don't know what it is, but please, just figure something out.<eos> And then when you do, I want you to come home.<eos> To your family.
If you're looking for a fairy to take your anger out on, perhaps you should find your mother.<eos> Well, since the Black Fairy is trapped in another realm, I suppose I'll have to make do with you.<eos> The most important thing right now is finding our son.<eos> I think maybe it's best if I continue to look on my own.<eos> I'm beginning to think we're not gonna find him out here.<eos> Well, why?<eos> Where... Where do you think he is?<eos> His heart is set on fulfilling his destiny.<eos> And he can't do that without the sword.<eos> What sword?
All right, son.<eos> No more magic.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> - Father.<eos> - Gideon.<eos> After your little showdown with the Savior, this is the last place you should be.<eos> Don't worry, Father.<eos> With this, she won't be able to get the best of me again.<eos> Perhaps she won't. But there's still a few things you need to learn from your papa.<eos> Not another step!
Who did this to you?<eos> You can tell me.<eos> The baker's son.<eos> Well, why did he do that?<eos> So... So I'd look like a monster.<eos> Just like me.<eos> I think it's about time I had a word with his father.<eos> No, Papa, you'll only make things worse.<eos> - Rumplestiltskin.<eos> - What?
How does it end?<eos> With the destruction of the Black Fairy and all she stands for.<eos> That's not how it ends.<eos> That's not how it ever ends.<eos> The Black Fairy destroyed your childhood.<eos> Don't let her destroy the rest of your life.<eos> You don't get a say in the matter.<eos> Dark One, who forged this blade?<eos> Whose blood do I need?<eos> The Blue Fairy's.

That's a risk I have to take.<eos> Gideon, please.<eos> And I can't have you getting in my way.<eos> I truly am sorry, Father.<eos> Dark One, I command you...<eos> don't try to stop me.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Don't get your arrows in a twist.<eos> I just had to pick up a few things.<eos> Pet snake?
It's just, what I have to say isn't exactly easy, and I'm not entirely sure how you're gonna react.<eos> Well, maybe I can make it easier and tell you that my answer would be yes.<eos> Yes? I...<eos> What was the question?<eos> I might have found something in your sea chest that I shouldn't have.<eos> Are you mad at me?<eos> No.<eos> How could I ever be mad at you?<eos> It's just you and me.<eos> No walls, no secrets.
- Ethan!<eos> - For the murder of Steven Mason.<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> - You have the right to remain silent...<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Stay back, ma'am.<eos> - Allie, it's fine.<eos> You can't just take him.<eos> - For your own safety, ma'am.
Bribery, extortion.<eos> Who was the developer?<eos> Ethan Ward.<eos> He's my ex-boyfriend.<eos> We were together for five years.<eos> I helped him build his company.<eos> In the six months prior to Detective Mason's death,<eos> Ethan bought up all of the riverfront property.<eos> The owner of that warehouse was the last holdout.<eos> Until the fire.
My boyfriend was being arrested for something that he didn't do.<eos> I have a temper, not a drug problem.<eos> What time did you leave the club?<eos> I don't know. 2:00?<eos> And Mr. Ward left with you?<eos> Mm-hmm. We took a cab.<eos> You can check my credit card to see what time it was.<eos> And then you and Mr. Ward went to...<eos> Sleep.<eos> Well to bed.
Don't move.<eos> Stand down!<eos> Stand down. He's one of ours.<eos> - All clear.<eos> - What the hell is going on?<eos> Thank God you're not dead.<eos> Why would I be dead?<eos> Because we've been made.<eos> - What?<eos> - Not necessarily.
What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna start paying you to keep my secrets.<eos> Margot, darling?<eos> Oh, God, does no one in this family know how to knock?<eos> It's about Fernando.<eos> I am trying to help.<eos> I don't need your help running the Firm, Mother.<eos> If you want to help me, help me with Tessa.<eos> Tessa is not the problem at hand.<eos> Maybe not for you.
It looks bad, yes.<eos> But it will look even worse if you reopen a case based on circumstantial evidence.<eos> Nick, let us find out the truth.<eos> Let us finish what we started seven years ago.<eos> Why the change of heart, Ms. Vaughan?<eos> Did he threaten you?<eos> No.<eos> Not directly.<eos> He hired somebody to follow me around, spy on me...<eos> A private investigator.
Why the change of heart, Ms. Vaughan?<eos> Did he threaten you?<eos> No.<eos> Not directly.<eos> He hired somebody to follow me around, spy on me...<eos> A private investigator.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> To make sure that I don't talk to people that I shouldn't...<eos> Say things that I shouldn't.<eos> Things like?
She only meets with major players.<eos> She won't be meeting with Benjamin Jones.<eos> She'll be meeting with a wealthy gold baron.<eos> Gold baron?<eos> Thomas Nye.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.<eos> AVI already backstopped my cover.<eos> Okay, fine, but a gold baron?<eos> This man just so happens to own a-a very lucrative network of mines in Romania.<eos> - The Congo.

- Cellphones.<eos> - All of them.<eos> Don't leave any behind.<eos> - Hurry.<eos> Go, go, go, go. - All of them.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Here!<eos> Here!<eos> We're gonna do...<eos> Back. Back.

Disrupt service overnight so they can gain entry as I.T. engineers in the morning... they're professionals.<eos> Professionals don't want to be surrounded by the police.<eos> They should have anticipated someone would have activated the alarm.<eos> Well, maybe they did.<eos> Who triggered the alarm?<eos> Angela Rose, one of the private security guards.<eos> What are the hostage takers asking for?<eos> Nothing so far.<eos> Hostage takers with no demands... that's different.<eos> Not so different.
You're allowed to come.<eos> Is this her?<eos> Move that appointment to later this afternoon.<eos> Ms. Bloom, this is Eric Beaumont.<eos> - Beaumont.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Your reputation precedes you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> This is Zara Hallam, formerly NYPD and our chief investigator.<eos> Investigator?
I don't expect we'll pay that much, Ms. Bloom.<eos> Avoiding violence is our top priority, Ms. Bloom.<eos> And saving her company money.<eos> Well, at the moment, the hostage takers haven't asked for anything at all.<eos> So, what do they want?<eos> That's what we need to find out.<eos> Will you excuse us?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He knows what he's doing.<eos> He better.
- Ah.<eos> I was just making sure nobody tries nothing.<eos> These hostages were to make sure the cops don't come in.<eos> Now you've pretty well guaranteed a SWAT team on our backs.<eos> You just set up the insurance.<eos> SWAT looks a little lively for my taste.<eos> - Yeah, we'll find out about that.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> You ask.<eos> Sellars!
Can you ask Ms. Bloom for a list of all the people those safety deposit boxes are rented to?<eos> That's confidential information.<eos> Hey, do you think there's something going on between Eric and the insurance lady?<eos> Nathalie and Eric?<eos> Nah.<eos> I'll give it a shot.<eos> Maxine, can you go with Nathalie, please?<eos> Sure.<eos> You're incorrigible.<eos> Still nothing?
This better work.<eos> How did you come to work for Mr. Beaumont?<eos> It's what I've always dreamed of doing.<eos> Being a negotiator?<eos> Saving people.<eos> Although right now, I'm just trying to keep up.<eos> Eric is every bit as brilliant as they say.<eos> He has his moments.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> Smalltownsville.
Thanks, but no more being the hero, okay?<eos> You gotta get out of here.<eos> Bill, we're both gonna make it out of here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hey, Angie.<eos> It's Eric.<eos> Hi, yeah.<eos> I'm gonna need some more of your help.<eos> You think you're up to that?<eos> What kind of help?
What?<eos> ...May 2008, he shot a 17-year-old kid in the Bronx.<eos> Grimes claimed he was armed, but the kid's family said he never even touched a gun.<eos> - Were charges filed?<eos> - No.<eos> The whole case was dismissed after an internal investigation, but the stink from it ruined his career.<eos> On it.<eos> - What's the connection?<eos> - Well, maybe nothing. But if Officer Grimes is looking for something more than money, maybe this is it.<eos> What?

Yeah, poison ivy, mosquitoes, got to love it.<eos> Oh, come on, you live for this as much as I do.<eos> Dreyfuss is alive and Jobe is in the wind.<eos> Is there any indication what they have planned?<eos> I have a powerful need to make sure the entire world changes for the better.<eos> Hello, there, old friend.<eos> Please have a seat.<eos> I have really been looking forward to showing you what I've done with the place.<eos> Is this really what you wanted, Dreyfuss?<eos> The death of democracy?
The death of democracy?<eos> Only a washed-up Founding Father could... (chuckles) ...possibly mourn the loss of something so criminally ineffectual.<eos> You take this off for one minute and I will show you mourning.<eos> Once a patriot, always a patriot.<eos> Do you know what I've come to learn over the years, Mr. Crane?<eos> People... by and large, people are herd animals.<eos> When it comes right down to it, most people, they really don't want to bear the burden of governing themselves.<eos> Deep down, most people are violently opposed to the effort it takes to think for themselves.<eos> Do you know what all of the willingly helpless, bleating sheep really want, more than anything else?<eos> A shepherd.

Okay.<eos> (girl yells) We love you!<eos> There you go.<eos> Well, great.<eos> Mom, what is happening to him?<eos> WOMAN: Someone help him!<eos> MAN: Somebody call 911!<eos> WOMAN: He needs a doctor!<eos> - (sizzling) - No pictures!<eos> - No pictures!
He kept insisting.<eos> I just... I-I wanted him to shut up, so I hit play.<eos> And now...<eos> Whatever this Fire Flu is, Jake I'm infected.<eos> I fear the worst, Agent Thomas.<eos> If this video truly has gone viral, thousands of lives could hang in the balance.<eos> Well, not even the government can shut down the Internet.<eos> I have heard great orators of yore make hay from more dire situations than this, Agent Thomas.<eos> Sometimes all the people need are some words of leadership.<eos> People of Washington!
DIANA: Crane!<eos> Watch out!<eos> Crane, where are you?<eos> Agent Thomas!<eos> 'Tis time to summon that lightning!<eos> Come.<eos> (echoing): You must burn for me.<eos> - You must join...<eos> - Jake.<eos> ...the eternal flame.
It's actually where I sent Quentin.<eos> Where's Quentin?<eos> So we finally get to the cashier and guess what.<eos> - Hmm? - I left my wallet in the car.<eos> - Oh, man.<eos> - Talk about bad timing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, does Donut House, does that taste like donuts?<eos> I just use that thing for soup.<eos> Soup?
My father was not the best...<eos> Wine, Your Majesty.<eos> Bad dad.<eos> So I suppose I don't exactly have the proper, uh, uh... template to--<eos> Ahh! Quiet!<eos> You are not welcome here, child of Earth.<eos> Eliot!<eos> Wait.<eos> This is not over, child of Earth.<eos> Dungeon.
- Ship 'em back to Loria?<eos> - Actually, Your Highness, he's not from Loria.<eos> He's a native Fillorian.<eos> My own people are trying to kill me?<eos> Hmm. So French.<eos> They're commoners.<eos> Not to worry. Oh, whoa, whoa. I'm worried.<eos> I urge a public execution, today.<eos> Might I suggest strangulation?<eos> For the symbolism.
Okay.<eos> - You can go ahead.<eos> - Yeah, thanks.<eos> I'll be right here.<eos> No geese!<eos> Phew. You finish table.<eos> Good work.<eos> Yeah, so can we get to this?<eos> Enough "Karate Kid" bullshit.<eos> Not bullshit.
I hope this isn't too personal, but...<eos> Is that a human pulse I'm feeling or are you just happy to see me?<eos> What?<eos> I don't...<eos> Vivian, your chopper is ready.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The problem is, when you do so well in qumar and you fail back home, people notice.<eos> I was out there during the debriefing wondering how did our new star soldier let that zombie-murdering hick escape.<eos> Everything was happening so fast.<eos> Not too fast for a zombie.
So, who's hungry for some barbecue?<eos> No. We've got it. Don't...<eos> Don't trouble yourself.<eos> Check it out!<eos> We got regulars.<eos> We're the kinda place where... yeah.<eos> Actually, I don't know their names.<eos> I think it's like private corporal something, i guess.<eos> Those men are military?<eos> Private military.
- We pranked Rudy a bajillion times.<eos> And you're asking us to remember one specific time.<eos> It was in a hotel room.<eos> Rudy was sobbing and screaming at Finn, asking him why he has to have everything.<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> We weren't able to find any footage of the prank online.<eos> We were hoping you could fill us in.<eos> What did Finn do to Rudy?<eos> Put super lice in his underwear?<eos> Beehive in his car?
Next time you let me bring a cattle prod.<eos> We'll get answers. Hey.<eos> I only have a second to talk.<eos> I lied to the guys and said i had to yak up last night's purple drink. -So, talk.<eos> -That prank on Rudy that you asked about?<eos> We never used the footage.<eos> But our editor sent us a link to the cut.<eos> Thing you gotta know going in, Rudy's never had much luck with the girls.<eos> Oh,mygod!<eos> -Whatthehell!
What has it been like, eight, nine years?<eos> - Oh, I got to get this. - Whoa.<eos> No, I can't... okay.<eos> Uh, Liz, look. Um, this is my sister, Mackenzie.<eos> - Oh, this is the sister.<eos> - Yes.<eos> The sister?<eos> What are you? You're the...<eos> - Neighbor.<eos> - The neighbor?
Sabrina, look, it's your Aunt Mackenzie.<eos> Aunt Mackenzie.<eos> I haven't seen you since you were young.<eos> Sabrina's going to Yale next year.<eos> I got into Yale, that doesn't mean I'm going.<eos> - Well, you sh... - That's probably a good call.<eos> Cute.<eos> Remind me, what do you do again?<eos> You know how it goes.<eos> Just kind of in between things.
...checks the runner at first.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> - Watch the shoes.<eos> - Oh, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, hang on. - That's my sister.<eos> Poodle!<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - Yeah, I don't know.<eos> Listen. I need you to watch the kids tonight.<eos> - Your kids?
What's the matter with her?<eos> I think she's dead.<eos> She's not dead, I can see her breathing.<eos> Oh, hey. You guys are home.<eos> Cool.<eos> What's everybody thinking for dinner?<eos> We just ate breakfast.<eos> You were like this when we came home from school yesterday.<eos> Huh? Well, where's Alba?<eos> Help!
You, uh, feeling like having some ice cream?<eos> I can't. My mom says I'm allergic.<eos> Yeah, well, I got news for you, pal.<eos> Your mom is just projecting her own eating disorders onto you.<eos> What's projecting?<eos> Great question.<eos> Projecting, that's, like, when something's wrong with you, but you think something's - wrong with somebody else. - Hey.<eos> Fire! - What?<eos> What? - Fire!<eos> Help!
- Where are the brakes on this?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - I'm just the delivery guy.<eos> - What?<eos> No, where you going?<eos> Don't leave!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Sabrina, help!<eos> 'Sup.<eos> Help!
Okay, Sully, this is it, let's do it.<eos> You got it. Just, uh, give me ten minutes and we'll light this place up.<eos> yeah, Light it up.<eos> but did you not just hear me?<eos> I said this is it, it's showtime.<eos> Oh, I heard you, but I got to bang out my pre-show ritual first.<eos> Where's your green room?<eos> Oh, no, man, this is a home, so we-we don't have a green room, but you should do whatever you need to do.<eos> Well, what other kind of rooms do you have?<eos> For you?
So, let's get on with the clown show.<eos> Oh, we would love to, but you eighty-sixed the clown.<eos> Remember when she made us get rid of that fun clown, who was gonna do fun clown stuff?<eos> I remember.<eos> Yeah. We did that because we were waiting for that big surprise that you promised.<eos> Are you gonna break your promise?<eos> No. ‭We don't break promises.<eos> No, I would never break a promise, okay?<eos> It's just... it's just gonna take a little bit longer, that's all.<eos> Ms. Mickey?
Get out of here!<eos> Yeah, you're lucky we don't call the cops on your junkie ass.<eos> I'm no junkie.<eos> I'm a diabetic.<eos> I live on birthday cake and high fructose corn syrup.<eos> Geez.<eos> What about the needle and balloons?<eos> Insulin and sugar pills.<eos> The spoon?<eos> Cake.
Try using less milk chocolate next time.<eos> The frosting is supposed to be a vehicle for the cake, not the star of the show.<eos> Take the cake and get out of here.<eos> Well, that party was a disaster, but at least Ben seems to be having fun.<eos> Hey, Ben, I think you missed one.<eos> Who's it from?<eos> I don't know, we're gonna have to read the card.<eos> What? !<eos> A postcard from Iraq?<eos> Iraq.
You're a young man.<eos> This is just beginning.<eos> All right?<eos> And to tell you the truth, I miss the days girls were blasting me in the junk.<eos> Are you the father?<eos> I am today.<eos> Well, his scans look okay.<eos> Hopefully the pain and swelling will subside in the next few days, but if not, that could mean something more serious, maybe even infertility.<eos> What does... what does that mean?<eos> - Well, his...
What?<eos> Fixed your gibbons problem. Really?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> All you have to do is tell him who sent you That picture, he's gonna cancel the honor board And save you the public humiliation.<eos> How is this good news?<eos> Then everyone's gonna call me a traitor like you.<eos> Chip, take the deal.<eos> Come over here, man.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Later, traitor.
I mean, geno pinero Just kind of smoked me in the nuts with a pine cone.<eos> Oh, with a dong like that, you'd think he'd be happier.<eos> Yeah. Don't worry, we'll take care of it, okay?<eos> I'm thinking monkey business?<eos> Done.<eos> What's "monkey business?"<eos> Just step back.<eos> He's got to find it.<eos> Get off me!<eos> Hey, hey, hey! What the hell, man?
Brendan carthas.<eos> You want to ask him About snitching?<eos> Oopsie, too bad.<eos> You can't. Do you want to know why?<eos> 'cause he's dead.<eos> Okay, can we please get to the point?<eos> Oh, i'm just getting warmed up.<eos> Now, i don't know If chip's silence is right or wrong, But this is bigger than us.<eos> This is about two words...<eos> Mon-ey. Wall street.
- Aw, come on. - Yeah.<eos> Oh, direct line right to the bloodstream.<eos> - Smart. - Yeah.<eos> - Shame on both of you.<eos> - Hey. Hey, shame on you for shaming all over us for trying to fix a problem.<eos> Either be part of the solution or get the hell out.<eos> What's it gonna be?<eos> Just the guy I wanted to s...<eos> What you looking for?<eos> Answers.
Well, anyways... I just wanted to say sorry about the whole bike thing.<eos> Don't worry, I'll tell Omicron it was an accident.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> I hope he sees it that way.<eos> The point is... I thought the two of us can, you know, just chill and watch a movie.<eos> I can't.<eos> I got to be in the woods.<eos> What's the hammer for?<eos> To bash stuff.<eos> What kind of stuff?
Show 'em.<eos> We're still working on that.<eos> This guy saved my life.<eos> He taught me how to love again. Oh.<eos> I'd do anything to repay him.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Anything?<eos> Well, uh, this is a mighty nice sacrifice you're making for our family, Mr. Omicron.<eos> I'm doing it for Ben.<eos> Not you.
The pemberton brand seems to be fugitives and pool poopers.<eos> Hey, pop these by the first tee for me.<eos> Thanks, chief.<eos> What...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Chip. Show some restraint.<eos> I am.<eos> Dad usually gives him 50.<eos> Well, maybe consider a new financial role model Besides dad.<eos> What the hell?
Listen, i know you're a busy girl and i'm a busy guy, So i'll just get right down to business.<eos> Boom. What is this?<eos> That's $168.<eos> And what am i supposed to do with it?<eos> I don't care. Put a down payment on a chihuahua.<eos> It's a bribe.<eos> Take it.<eos> That's better.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> No. None whatsoever.
No toys by the pool.<eos> Okay. Want to play marco polo?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> And then... The coup de grÃ¢ce.<eos> The most precise and intricate part of our plan.<eos> between the heat, The smell, and the crying,<eos> Oliver's left with only one option.<eos> Really?<eos> This now?<eos> Ugh.
I swear, look!<eos> It's chocolate!<eos> No, no, no, no, no, nope.<eos> Please, not again!<eos> Hell no!<eos> Hot sauce!<eos> It burns the eyes and the face.<eos> See?<eos> My-my eyes!<eos> Hot sau...
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...<eos> JENNY: He's lost his connection to our world.<eos> He needs an anchor.<eos> - Mom?<eos> - You know the man you drew,<eos> Mr. Crane?
He was talking to me.<eos> Yeah, I knew that.<eos> WOMAN: Mr. Dreyfuss is just wrapping up a presentation for our Young Entrepreneurs Program.<eos> It's so inspiring how much he gives back.<eos> DREYFUSS: It's... ah, n... w...<eos> Ansel, Ansel, I'm telling you,<eos> Th-the pull-down on page two, it just... it keeps crashing, it keeps... (sighs) Will you please put the...<eos> c-camera down for one second and help me out, help me out.<eos> - Right here.<eos> Help.
Ah.<eos> That's right.<eos> A jest. Bit of mischief.<eos> And now you're collecting powerful artifacts to perpetrate more evil...<eos> Oh, yes, now, that, that... that does sound like me, yes.<eos> Leveraging assets.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Innocent lives be damned.<eos> No.<eos> No. No, no, not-not innocent.
- What are you collecting?<eos> - I... really don't<eos> - have time for this. - What does Ansel want?<eos> I don't know what he...<eos> - (phone rings) - I don't know what he wan...<eos> Yes?<eos> We're ready, sir.<eos> Okay, good. Listen-listen to me.<eos> No matter what you have to do, make sure he doesn't get out.<eos> - Yes, sir.
I just don't know how.<eos> What kind of mother does that make me?<eos> Agent Thomas, you are an excellent detective and an intrepid soldier, but most of all... you are a superior parent.<eos> I have no doubt when the time comes to tell Molly, you will find the words.<eos> Your misgivings are quite unfounded, for you are governed by one law:<eos> truth.<eos> And with you by her side, Molly shall never know fear... nor apprehension.<eos> Quite the pep talk.<eos> Ever thought of coaching youth soccer?<eos> Oof.
Crane!<eos> When the door re-opened, Crane was just... gone.<eos> The fact that the last Talisman piece disappeared along with him makes a case for the culprit.<eos> Yeah, your friend and mine, Malcolm Dreyfuss.<eos> No, we were ahead for a minute.<eos> Looks like we just lost our lead.<eos> Hey, not for lack of trying.<eos> You did good.<eos> - Both of you.<eos> - Damn straight.
Tell me, what sort of an eternal life would that be with that stain on your conscience?<eos> So, innocent people lose their lives because you're too thick to read the small print in your deal with the devil.<eos> I... I had faith I would find a loophole.<eos> And I did.<eos> And I am more than grateful to acknowledge that I owe all of it to you.<eos> That's right.<eos> See, for years I'd spent billions on-on cryogenics, nanomedicine, regenerative therapy and on and on and on.<eos> Then one day, one of my feelers at the FBI tells me he got wind of a 250-year-old man.<eos> I mean, holy sh... ut the front door.<eos> Wowza.
There.<eos> Go.<eos> Dreyfuss.<eos> Dreyfuss, it's over!<eos> Are they dead?<eos> The Stone drained the life out of them.<eos> Jobe said Dreyfuss is only safe in his proximity.<eos> Good thing I got him in my back pocket then.<eos> Do it.<eos> No sign of Dreyfuss.

She is still rummaging through rubble in Sleepy Hollow.<eos> But Miss Jenny knows as well as I that evil tends to flare up just when you think it's been extinguished.<eos> There you are, demon.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What you doing?<eos> No way... nothing.<eos> Oh, in here?<eos> I was looking for a coat.<eos> Not this coat.<eos> A misplaced coat.
Man into monster.<eos> 'Tis possible he fell victim to a consequence of the artifact's power.<eos> Which means...<eos> Malcolm Dreyfuss is the monster we seek.<eos> We must determine exactly what form Dreyfuss has taken.<eos> Now, the regular intervals between attacks would suggest some kind of feeding pattern.<eos> There were slash marks in the edge of the chest cavity.<eos> That's consistent with claws of some kind.<eos> Which would suggest the beast we seek is of the Lycan variety.<eos> Akin to a demonic wolf.
These should suffice in vanquishing the beast.<eos> How did this thing even find Molly?<eos> I may have an answer.<eos> I found this in Molly's room.<eos> Here.<eos> Occult symbols.<eos> Some Hermetic, some shamanistic.<eos> What?<eos> Why would she draw those?<eos> Research.
Turns out our agency has a pedigree.<eos> We are the occupational descendants of real heroes.<eos> From here on out, I'm just gonna be honest, promise.<eos> Something's coming.<eos> Not something, Miss Jenny.<eos> - Another vision?<eos> - It was spectacular.<eos> I'm destined to become the best thing that has ever happened to America.<eos> Is this really what you wanted, Dreyfuss?<eos> The death of democracy?
It could have been a-a bad dream.<eos> Got an idea.<eos> I've been talking to the others about showing you something, but... maybe now's the time.<eos> Showing me something?<eos> What?<eos> Welcome to the Vault.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Uh, the most amazing library ever.<eos> An archive of the incredible.<eos> A repository of the impossible.
Master Wells and Miss Alex will return shortly with our repast.<eos> Cool.<eos> Pizza?<eos> Something a little more delectable than Neapolitan flatbread.<eos> Well, look at that.<eos> You know this was actually worn by Davy Crockett.<eos> True.<eos> Now, legend would have you believe that this was fashioned from common raccoon.<eos> But between you and me, this is actually Wendigo pelt.<eos> Wendi what?
True.<eos> Now, legend would have you believe that this was fashioned from common raccoon.<eos> But between you and me, this is actually Wendigo pelt.<eos> Wendi what?<eos> Wendigo.<eos> It's a shape-shifting beast of Shawnee and Algonquian legend.<eos> Monsters.<eos> Monsters.<eos> Where do they come from?<eos> Purgatory.
Centuries of knowledge.<eos> "The last line of defense against all threats deemed otherworldly."<eos> But the downside of being a secret organization is that people forget about you.<eos> Maybe we did our job too well.<eos> Kept the monsters at bay, which meant people forgot to be afraid.<eos> They forgot.<eos> But I'll never forget... about the sacrifices we made, the blood spilled, about Michael my friend.<eos> That's why I had to leave the Vault.<eos> To get away from the demons.<eos> And the memories.
No, I've been really careful.<eos> Really careful.<eos> I...<eos> It's all right, it's all right.<eos> I believe you.<eos> Here, let's set aside how Mr. Stitch came into being, and together we will focus on where he's going next, yes?<eos> Why do you think Mr. Stitch went after Mr. David?<eos> Well, Mr. Stitch is not evil.<eos> He wouldn't hurt someone for no reason.<eos> And especially not Mr. David.
Meaning?<eos> That reading the symbols isn't gonna open the doors.<eos> It'll just allow you to access a servo that controls these barriers.<eos> Where's the servo located?<eos> In a utility duct, behind the west wall.<eos> There's an entry point from inside the Vault.<eos> And there's one other problem...<eos> Was Claudia Russell a Lilliputian?<eos> ! Is there any way to widen the opening?<eos> Not without heavier tools.
It's like you're famished for it.<eos> You are gonna do so well in this position.<eos> I can sign an NDA if you'd like to tell me more.<eos> Not at all necessary, my dear.<eos> Jobe!<eos> Please.<eos> Our friend Helen is interested in the position we are offering.<eos> No!<eos> Hello.<eos> Ichabod!
'Cause people with too much in common, they never work out.<eos> But didn't you say the exact opposite when I was crushing on Jenny mills, though?<eos> There she is.<eos> That's Ashley.<eos> So, what...<eos> Bluetooth scanner. Patent pending.<eos> Not exactly legal yet.<eos> But I can use a remote link to clone Ashley's SIM card.<eos> That way, if and when Dreyfuss calls, we can piggyback and use cell tower triangulation to locate him.<eos> But, not too close, Romeo.
Over here.<eos> I believe we have found the source of our demonic infestation.<eos> But how does it work?<eos> See if there's any information in the book I got from Donnie.<eos> I'm gonna do a sweep, make sure this demon isn't lurking around.<eos> If we dial in on the correct configuration, we should be able to call the creature back here.<eos> These are shang characters.<eos> That one there...<eos> Means "return to."<eos> And then, on the other side,
They were beset by British troops, and the farmstead they had taken shelter in was set on fire.<eos> Forcing a retreat, but not the mission's failure.<eos> Was there a part of the war you weren't a part of?<eos> The Treaty of Paris.<eos> And most of the naval engagements.<eos> My sea legs are a trifle shaky.<eos> This mission... what were you sent to courier?<eos> A wooden box.<eos> The contents of which were privy only to my companion, none other than Benjamin Banneker.<eos> Ben Banneker?
Banneker's hidden treasure.<eos> The Totem of War.<eos> It's ours.<eos> Where ever she is, she is formidible.<eos> To get the better of Miss Jenny is remarkable, but to then dispatch - of the demon Jobe...<eos> - Pretty solid proof she and Dreyfuss are not on the same team.<eos> And yet she bears his mark.<eos> Unless... there is a remnant of Arma Mutata still in existence... and she's a part of it.<eos> I recognize her face from somewhere.<eos> Probably a watch list.

And then he killed you.<eos> I know it didn't really happen, but it felt like it did.<eos> It was so real, Alex.<eos> It felt so real.<eos> You were really brave, Jake.<eos> When Jobe looked at me, he kind of, like... looked inside.<eos> And he said that thing about... how I felt about you.<eos> We're best friends.<eos> Best friends.<eos> About that.
So... what do you think he would say to you right now?<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> No!<eos> Agent Thom...<eos> No. Oh, my God.<eos> Well, I did not see that coming.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> The blood.<eos> The fear.
Hey, if I can't be here to ease your mind, then what good am I, right?<eos> Hello? Anybody here?<eos> You're dead.<eos> You're supposed to be dead.<eos> Molly.<eos> Don't... don't call me that.<eos> Oh, no. He changed your name.<eos> Oh, you mustn't let him.<eos> Don't let him... don't let him take your history.<eos> - Your family, your...
- (gunshot) - Mom!<eos> (gasps) I did it.<eos> I saved you.<eos> (exhales) - Agent Thom...<eos> - No.<eos> - DIANA: Oh, my God. - (Crane gasping)<eos> Well, I did not see that coming.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> The blood.<eos> The fear.
Oh, no, Malcolm cornered the market on all spellbooks, and if such a thing existed, it would've been in his collection.<eos> I've never seen, never heard of such a ritual.<eos> No, you wouldn't have found it.<eos> Crane kept all of Katrina's possessions back at their old place in Sleepy Hollow.<eos> Oh, how did I know that we were gonna get dragged back there<eos> - one way or another? - LARA: Wait, you're gonna believe the man who was a jar of goo five minutes ago?<eos> JAKE: Okay, we're about to raise the barriers.<eos> Stand back!<eos> Unless anyone has any better ideas than the jar of goo?<eos> ♪ LARA: A Masonic cell?
The most dangerous magical items in our possession.<eos> This is still fresh.<eos> We have a chance of catching up to whoever did this if we act fast.<eos> Yeah, it would help if we knew what was taken.<eos> Well, knowing our track record, I'm guessing it's something that'll give your nightmares nightmares.<eos> I can figure out what it is, but it's gonna take time and Crane.<eos> Divide and conquer.<eos> You guys work on this,<eos> I'll get the spellbook. You said it was in a cabin?<eos> Yeah, Corbin's cabin.
That's what the undead usually do:<eos> try to finish their unfinished business.<eos> Okay.<eos> Greek fire rounds.<eos> All of the pop of the unquenchable mystical flame, but in projectile form.<eos> These should take out the Hessians.<eos> And so, what's the catch?<eos> These are all we've got.<eos> Make every shot count.<eos> Right, so, no pressure at all.
!<eos> Dreyfuss' immortality poses a problem.<eos> You cannot help us, not directly, but you can direct us to someone, or something, that can.<eos> You two Witnesses.<eos> Via ad Infernum!<eos> My master will show you the torments you deserve!<eos> That Latin... an insult, I assume?<eos> "Go to Hell."<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> "Via ad Infernum,"
Flamma..."<eos> "Itchabob" Crane.<eos> I'm here to install your new modem.<eos> It's Ichabod.<eos> And I thought we scheduled for Thursday next?<eos> Oops. Got our wires crossed.<eos> But I'm here now.<eos> So let's get that Mbps rate blazing.<eos> When I'm through you'll be able to play your video games, watch your porn, and video chat your grandma<eos> - without any lag.
What?<eos> Okay, I've, uh, fought magical creatures, demons, and monsters, but...<eos> I've never defaced government property.<eos> I think that's pay dirt.<eos> Or we just tore up the Vault for nothing.<eos> Strange time to remodel.<eos> You made it back.<eos> Jobe was trying to help us, sent us to the right place.<eos> Mm-hmm. So... you met the man downstairs<eos> Yeah, the Father of Lies.

I'm sure she felt the same way.<eos> It's just... complicated.<eos> Molly.<eos> You're free.<eos> When you grow up, you can choose to fight evil... or not.<eos> And the Witness mantle?<eos> I don't have it anymore.<eos> But you bore it with bravery and aplomb well beyond your years.<eos> Miss Molly is not the only one free.<eos> Without the Witness mantle, you...
I have learnt a very important lesson over the years.<eos> One that is reflected in the heart's blood of this nation.<eos> Work hard, stay true, surround yourself with people you love and respect, and there's nothing you cannot achieve.<eos> So this?<eos> I'll fix this.<eos> No.<eos> We will fix this together.<eos> I have no doubt.<eos> Now, is that the siren call of duty I hear? Cheap.<eos> Siren.
I keep asking, but I guess the guy's got something better to do with his time.<eos> Better than come over our house for dinner?<eos> Yeah. I've got better things to do, and I still eat here.<eos> This is what you do.<eos> Tell Riggs I haven't seen him in a while, and I'm asking him over for dinner.<eos> I'm not easily offended, but the guy's getting pricklier.<eos> So you say.<eos> Every morning.

Enjoy.<eos> All right.<eos> Scorsese gave you this address?<eos> Yeah. And yes, he may have field-tested one too many supplements when he gave it to me.<eos> Smile, Rog.<eos> Hello.<eos> LAPD.<eos> We're here to speak to an "Owlsy..."<eos> Why are you having so much trouble with that?<eos> "Owsy."
Damn.<eos> I'm very thrilled to meet you guys.<eos> So excited to get started.<eos> Detective Cho is a true student of the Koreatown community.<eos> With all due respect, Captain, I just feel that bringing a third person into the...<eos> I-I agree with Riggs.<eos> It's... I-I mean, even two people is often one too many.<eos> Well, not so much with that.<eos> - That's a little dig, but...<eos> - No offense.
Thank you, Cho.<eos> Appreciate you noticing.<eos> I'm with this guy all day long.<eos> Not once has he ever complimented me on one of my hats.<eos> What's up?<eos> Look at that.<eos> Did you just put that on?<eos> I got a contact at a club on Western, Road to Sung's.<eos> The place is known for two things:<eos> Ginseng chicken soup and its clientele.
You hurt?<eos> Not bad, I don't think.<eos> All right, well...<eos> EMTs should be here shortly.<eos> They can take a look at you.<eos> You know I got to take you in, right?<eos> You won't.<eos> Well... unless you got enough of that magic sleeping powder to roofie all of us, you're wrong.<eos> Nope.<eos> Just enough for me.
I appreciate that, but I shouldn't have pushed.<eos> I was out of line.<eos> No, you weren't.<eos> Look, Trish, at some point, I'm gonna need a little push.<eos> Roger!<eos> Your partner's here.<eos> Cho?<eos> Is it Ch...<eos> - Is that you?<eos> - Wow.
- Yeah, man.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Welcome to Manhattan, 1965.<eos> - I have been dropped off behind enemy lines and cities all over the world.<eos> Never been dropped off in the future.<eos> - Now you have to disappear, start a whole new life.<eos> The spear of destiny must be protected at all costs.<eos> - Roger that, sir.<eos> - I know this mission won't be easy, commander Heywood.<eos> - For me or for bettie?
CIA?<eos> - He was a fighter pilot before he was recruited by the jsa.<eos> - In the sixties, the fledgling national aeronautics and space administration used to call upon test pilots to apply to be astronauts.<eos> - Exactly, what could be more patriotic, more adventurous than exploring space?<eos> - Nice, Gideon, pull up anything you can.<eos> Press clippings, newspaper articles, re: NASA circa 1965.<eos> -Certainly,captain.<eos> - Wait, wait, stop, stop. - Right there.<eos> I'd recognize that Heywood jawline anywhere.<eos> - April 13th, 1970.
The mission is textbook.<eos> - Didn't an oxygen tank explode and the moon landing get aborted?<eos> - No, everything is going great up there.<eos> Unless...<eos> - Unless... History's changed.<eos> - Houston, we are about to enter the dark side of the moon.<eos> Loss of signal in 30 seconds.<eos> -Rogerthat,"odyssey."<eos> Seeyouin 28 minutes.<eos> Happysailing.

- we have to intercept "Apollo 13" before it lands on the moon.<eos> - Where's commander Heywood?<eos> He and I need to have a little chat.<eos> - He's introducing the rest of the team to the flight director.<eos> - Interesting.<eos> Why? - Because we need somebody monitoring on the ground.<eos> - These are flight controllers?<eos> - Yes.<eos> They're with the, uh,<eos> British space program.
I'mafraidthejumpship hasbeencriticallyimpaired.<eos> Oh,dear.<eos> Ourlandinggearhas ...<eos> - we're clear.<eos> - waverider crew, we are now the proud owners of the last fragment of the spear of destiny.<eos> -Copy.<eos> - Copy.<eos> That's all I get is a "copy"?<eos> Guys, I'm standing on the freakin' moon!<eos> - Yeah, about that.
You're an outcast.<eos> A misfit.<eos> - Let's assume.<eos> - Sounds to me like you're a legend.<eos> - I'm sorry, Nathaniel.<eos> This was my fault.<eos> If I hadn't of told Henry that he shouldn't return home- he would've still thrown himself off of the ship to save us.<eos> That's just who he was.<eos> - Maybe destiny has plans for all of us.<eos> Not just me.

Now, this scholar had this far-fetched theory about Sir Gawain, that the knight returned from the Crusades not with the Holy Grail, but with something far more valuable.<eos> - The blood of Christ.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Now, the paper went on to theorize that Gawain had a vial of this precious substance on him up to his death and was buried with it somewhere in the North of France.<eos> Just somewhere in the North of France?<eos> That's a big area.<eos> I know, but if anyone, and I mean anyone, knows where to start looking, it's this guy.<eos> "The Burden of the Purest Heart:<eos> Sir Gawain's Secret Treasure," written by...<eos> - John Ronald Reuel Tolkien.
You.<eos> I knew you weren't volunteers.<eos> Your accent alone was horrendous.<eos> I'll have you know I played Bert in my middle school production of "Mary Poppins," thank you.<eos> Who are you, then?<eos> German?<eos> Ottoman?<eos> And where on God's Earth have you brought me?<eos> Somewhere the less talked about, the better,<eos> - for your sake.
It's my mother.<eos> Her voice, at least.<eos> She's begging me to help our people.<eos> To keep our family and our legacy safe.<eos> She wants me to change my destiny.<eos> Maybe the spear can do that for her.<eos> The chance to rewrite reality.<eos> Who wouldn't be tempted?<eos> What do you hear?<eos> My parents.
That's not true.<eos> There was a choice, and you made the wrong one, and now the Spear of Destiny, the most powerful weapon in all of history, is in the hands of not one, but four psychopaths.<eos> - Don't forget Mr. Rory.<eos> - That's right.<eos> We trusted him, and he screwed us over.<eos> Did we trust him?<eos> I mean, admit it, we never really did, and he picked up on it.<eos> Yeah, apparently Mr. Rory's not entirely stupid.<eos> We lied to him.<eos> Not Mick, Tolkien.
My name is Eobard Thawne.<eos> With the help of Damien Darhk,<eos> Malcolm Merlyn,
Mr. Snart.<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> We didn't realize it was you.<eos> Carry on.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> No roasting pigs?<eos> No need.<eos> We're home free, buddy.<eos> It's good to be the king.<eos> No getaway, no chase?
It is like old times, only better.<eos> Central City is ours.<eos> No more Flash.<eos> Except another speedster's calling the shots.<eos> You leave Thawne to me.<eos> I always have a plan. You know this.<eos> Well, fill me in.<eos> When the time is right.<eos> Yes, we're partners, except when you refuse to tell me what's going on.<eos> You son of a...
The very first thing I did in this reality was acquire my magic.<eos> I'm gonna miss you, Ms. Lance.<eos> Having you around to attend to my every whim was too enticing to pass up.<eos> Plus, it's so hard to find good help these days.<eos> Really?<eos> Now's the time for a bad guy monologue?<eos> You should've killed me when you had the chance.<eos> No better time than the present.<eos> Amaya, the honor is yours.<eos> Good-bye.
Dude, how do you even know what Aramaic sounds like?<eos> "Passion of the Christ". Good movie.<eos> Mick, would you be able to recognize the incantation?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey. If they figure out this incantation and we get our hands on the Spear, I want you to use it.<eos> I should have listened to you back in World War I.<eos> If we had used the Spear when we had the chance...<eos> I might have been tempted to use it to change my own future.<eos> Now... we've got nothing to lose.<eos> Marty, Marty, Marty.
Knowing Sara, she's rallied the team by now.<eos> Those idiots aren't whom I'm worried about.<eos> Relax, boys.<eos> Prodigal son has returned.<eos> And he's got some news for us.<eos> Isn't that right, Mick?<eos> Our old friend Eobard has built a device to destroy the Spear.<eos> No wonder Eobard doesn't want us using it before he locks in his own version of reality.<eos> Which I assume means erasing all of us.<eos> And your pals.
Don't insult my intelligence.<eos> Even at your fastest, you're moving in slow motion to me.<eos> Except they're not alone.<eos> I say we go down fighting.<eos> You kill one of us, we kill all of you.<eos> For Amaya.<eos> Don't.<eos> Even if you survive my men, you'll never survive me, not without powers or weapons.<eos> And the truth is, I don't want to see any more of you dead.<eos> Not out of sentiment, of course.
Yeah, who is also capable of making mistakes.<eos> Isn't that how you were labeled a thief, Lieutenant Kelly?<eos> Or how I spent ten months behind bars after an HPD officer falsely accused me of pointing a gun at him.<eos> The Makapu'u lighthouse occupation.<eos> I can't get that time back, but I can make sure that no other injustice happens to anyone else.<eos> This guy is not even a part of your community.<eos> He's outside of your protection.<eos> He's still Kanaka.<eos> Then where was he during your protests?<eos> Your occupations, your community meetings.
Everyone knows the best way to store important items is to bury them underground.<eos> Yeah, I think I learned that from the family dog.<eos> All right, you mock me, but safes are anything but secure.<eos> Allow me to demonstrate on one that happens to be the exact same model as the one found in Dylan Turner's home.<eos> Okay, I always love a demonstration that starts with a large metal hockey puck. When I started looking into the robberies,<eos> I came across a string of home invasions from all over the Island, all which shared a similar M.O...<eos> Three of the homes had safes, and in each case, the thief was able to open the safe without damaging the lock or leaving any fingerprints.<eos> A tough thing to do, unless... you have access to a neodymium magnet.<eos> Okay, so where do you get one of these, Neo...<eos> Neodymium.
This is Danny Williams, please.<eos> I want you to post two men on every sniper.<eos> I want 'em to feel HPD breathing down their necks.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Lieutenant Kelly.<eos> Commander McGarrett on the line for you.<eos> Hey, Steve.<eos> Yeah, Chin, listen, we need everybody to stand down immediately, all right?<eos> We're currently on the way to question a new suspect, Devon Berris.<eos> Berris?
Jess, I'm not gonna tell you, okay?<eos> Unless you ask me repeatedly, in which case I'll eventually crack.<eos> Damn it. - What's the total?<eos> - Uh.. no.<eos> - What's the total?<eos> - No. - What's the total?<eos> - Not gonna tell you.<eos> What's the total?<eos> $200,000.<eos> Seinfeld.
And I'm gonna start working here right now.<eos> This very second while there are no distractions.<eos> N-no d... no distractions.<eos> It's perfect. Thank you.<eos> Total silence.<eos> It's incredible.<eos> What a sanctuary. Complete silence.<eos> You got it.<eos> I love you. Have fun.<eos> You... No distractions.
We got a rat.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yeah, he got in the Raisin Bran.<eos> Got in the oatmeal.<eos> What is it?<eos> Rat got into the cabinets, Lieutenant.<eos> Maybe if this place wasn't such a dump...<eos> - I don't think...<eos> - Hoover duty in the kitchen and common room.<eos> Top to bottom...
What is it?<eos> Rat got into the cabinets, Lieutenant.<eos> Maybe if this place wasn't such a dump...<eos> - I don't think...<eos> - Hoover duty in the kitchen and common room.<eos> Top to bottom...<eos> every crack and crevice.<eos> Throw out all the outdated food and polish every surface.<eos> I'm not messing around.<eos> On it.
I'm sorry.<eos> Sir, your daughter's really exhausted right now.<eos> This is none of your business.<eos> Okay, Dawson, we should go.<eos> Look, I... I know I messed up, but, Daddy, you have to see this baby.<eos> You have no business raising a child, Darla.<eos> You can barely take care of yourself!<eos> Don't talk to your daughter like that.<eos> She needs your support right now,<eos> - not your judgment.
Copy that.<eos> Fire started in the basement.<eos> - We need a hose line down here, Chief.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Over there, Kidd.<eos> - Fire department!<eos> - Fire department! Call out!<eos> Help!<eos> Help me!<eos> Help!
Come on, come on.<eos> Come on, I need everybody out of there.<eos> Kidd!<eos> Lieutenant, I can't get 'em both!<eos> My God.<eos> Please.<eos> All units, report.<eos> I will kill you, I swear.<eos> I will kill you!<eos> Help!
- Got her?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I got one more inside.<eos> His leg's pinned.<eos> I just need someone to help me.<eos> You see the color of that smoke?<eos> I know I have time, Chief.<eos> I'll go with him.<eos> Okay, one minute.<eos> Not a second longer.
And plus, you know, you saved a little girl.<eos> Fire's knocked down.<eos> It's safe to go back in.<eos> Hey. A guy you're trying to rescue points a gun at you... you tell me right away.<eos> You wouldn't let me go back in, Chief.<eos> You're damn right I wouldn't.<eos> Guys, let's go get him.<eos> Herrmann, grab a body bag.<eos> Severide. Give me a hand.<eos> The hell?
Copy.<eos> Seriously, Mouch?<eos> A Charleston Chew?<eos> Any left?<eos> So we went through the wreckage, splinter by splinter... no body.<eos> We turned the scene over to OFI.<eos> They'll bring in search dogs, look for any traces of him... if you're saying there's still someone inside.<eos> Well, I wasn't hallucinating, so yeah.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> Lieutenant?
Yeah. It belonged to their daughter Crystal.<eos> And the police just assumed it was left from an earlier trip.<eos> Maybe the unsub stole more than pills that night.<eos> He took something he knew he could use later to coerce Helen into swallowing the pills.<eos> Do it, or I will harm your little girl.<eos> And here's exhibit "A" to show I'm not bluffing.<eos> Hey, what say the mean streets of Tampa?<eos> The streets might be mean, but George Findley wasn't.<eos> Everybody I talked to loved the guy.<eos> No drug issues?
Attention and fear.<eos> Unless he's already started stalking his next victim.<eos> Last night was, um...<eos> Great.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Yes.<eos> But...<eos> I couldn't stay.<eos> I needed some space.<eos> Space.
Last night he had dinner at a table on the patio right near us at Rebecca's.<eos> Was he with anyone?<eos> Not then. But around midnight, when I was walking Scruffy, I saw him talking to a guy over by the parking area.<eos> Could you describe that guy?<eos> It's ok.<eos> Take your time.<eos> We would do this dinner date kind of thing where... he would sit at our favorite table at Rebecca's and we would share a meal over the phone.<eos> But we got cut short last night because he was comforting an old friend.<eos> Who was that?<eos> Bill Seavers.
JJ: What's wrong?<eos> Reid is in jail.<eos> Jail?<eos> Prentiss: In Mexico.<eos> What the hell is he doing down there?<eos> I don't know. I didn't talk to him.<eos> The call came in to Cruz from their lead investigator.<eos> What's he being held for?<eos> Drug possession, with intent to distribute.<eos> What type of drugs?
Helpful.<eos> We're having a hard time finding this Dr. Rosa.<eos> You still don't remember her last name or where you met her?<eos> I'm trying.<eos> When my officers chased you, you were racing toward the border.<eos> My guess is you planned on crossing it.<eos> Is that true?<eos> No, I, uh...<eos> Think I was chasing someone.<eos> Who?
He didn't want you to, and there's no way you would have guessed he'd end up in Mexico.<eos> The question is, why did he go down there?<eos> And why does he have narcotics?<eos> Yeah, exactly. That... that...<eos> He wouldn't... he wouldn't do that.<eos> I'm not gonna share any secrets I'm not supposed to, but those drugs were planted on him.<eos> Absolutely. But there's something bigger in play. That's why he crossed the border and kept it a secret.<eos> There's something he didn't want to share with any of you.<eos> Ok, so what would make him risk everything?<eos> His mom.
Hey, Reid.<eos> It's good to see you, brother.<eos> It's me, Luke.<eos> Luke.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Of course.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here, kid.<eos> We need to work out some details with the locals, ok?<eos> Who was your contact down here?<eos> Rosa.
- So, it says you want someone fertile?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> And surprisingly, this happened.<eos> Rogelio, it's me.<eos> Not to date, just to have a baby with.<eos> Think about it.<eos> I'm having a baby!<eos> And Jane's mom was getting some action, too.<eos> See, she was back with Bruce.<eos> Yes, that Bruce.
Anyway, we had just met and I didn't want you to think poorly of me.<eos> Yeah, that yacht has sailed.<eos> What about all the cash and jewelry?<eos> Is that really for our poor relatives in Venezuela?<eos> Mostly, yeah.<eos> I mean, a few are gifts from Arnaud, which I wanted to sell, but he wants back, so fine, I'll give them back.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> I'll give them back!<eos> It should be noted that Jane's next thought was that she needed to tell Rafael!<eos> Right away.
Ugh, fine. Of course.<eos> Which brings us here, now...<eos> Uh, some wine?<eos> Is this safe to drink?<eos> Oh, yeah, I didn't...<eos> He was just making a joke.<eos> Right.<eos> Look, I know the idea of me dating your mom again is a tough pill to swallow.<eos> Yeah, well, there's history there. Right.<eos> Yeah. For my daughter, too.
Well, this bit goes on longer than it should, but it should be noted that Michael wasn't the worst comedian in the world.<eos> This is Jerry Seinfeld as E.T.<eos> Did you ever have a time where your finger just glows for no reason?<eos> The pirate from Captain Phillips as played by SpongeBob, uh, Mateo's favorite.<eos> Look at me!<eos> Look at me! I'm the captain now.<eos> Dame Judi Dench as Scarface.<eos> First you get the money, then... you get the power, then you get the woman. That one went right over Mateo's head.<eos> At least, not to the people who loved him the most.<eos> But on a less comedic note...
- ASA Anna Valdez. You have a prisoner...<eos> Adrian Carrera.
Lots of fingers will be pointing.<eos> Ending in a textbook case of reasonable doubt for any and all of them.<eos> The problem is, we don't have enough evidence to convict any one of them alone.<eos> No, Anna, the problem is saying,<eos> "Sorry, someone screwed the pooch,<eos> - but we don't know who."<eos> - Because of Reverend Fitch?<eos> Not that I have to justify anything to you, but the man has a voice that people listen to.<eos> We'll conduct a thorough grand jury investigation with named targets.<eos> - Which ones?
Hit him harder than you should have?<eos> I mean... This is what we do.<eos> This is payback.<eos> No, it's...<eos> What we did... What we do... We do it for the right reasons.<eos> Keep shooting, huh?<eos> What?<eos> You ever think about the power we have as prosecutors?<eos> I don't like you, you look at me funny, I can drag you in front of a grand jury for something.<eos> Anything.
It's a little late in your career for a crisis of conscience.<eos> Robinette was right in court today.<eos> I had plenty of other targets.<eos> But the people of Cook County indicted only one of 'em.<eos> I just got off the phone with Reverend Fitch.<eos> He feels things aren't going our way.<eos> How much of what I told him was a lie?<eos> It's a coin toss, and I'm out of witnesses.<eos> What about the jailhouse snitch?<eos> Carrera?
I assume you have no problem with that, Mr. Robinette?<eos> The defense has no objection.<eos> One more thing, Your Honor?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Part of what we do as prosecutors is to make decisions that might destroy the lives of innocent people.<eos> We do our best to make those decisions without prejudice or pride.<eos> Sometimes... we get it wrong.<eos> Officer Atwater, on behalf of the State's Attorney's Office and all the people of Cook County, I'm sorry.<eos> I think he'd be proud.<eos> Of both of us.
He's a simple man.<eos> He was raised on a farm.<eos> He just wasn't built for everything he's had to go through with his children.<eos> Children?<eos> Evan was registered as an only child.<eos> We had a...<eos> Evan had a brother.<eos> We didn't know.<eos> I don't think any of us has really been the same since...<eos> Derek.
I wouldn't be who I am if it weren't for you, that's true.<eos> You should know I'm not afraid of you.<eos> Not afraid to go against you, either.<eos> Well, then you're just as foolish as I assumed.<eos> I have nowhere to hang this after all.<eos> Virtual reality therapy.<eos> The military developed it to treat combat survivors suffering from extreme PTSD.<eos> Soldiers are put through VR battle simulations to help speed up therapeutic recovery times.<eos> So you want to take Evan back to the day he broke his leg?<eos> No, not exactly.
It's, um, turning the Gobi Desert into farmland.<eos> Are all these realistic?<eos> Yeah, all of them.<eos> I've just been, too busy working on E.J.<eos> Adam was such a nice guy.<eos> I feel terrible for Adam's wife, Erica, too.<eos> Erica said Adam died because your program malfunctioned.<eos> Yeah, and I've spent every minute since he died scanning E.J., but there's no glitch, no error, nothing.<eos> Wasn't his fault.<eos> His?
Don't touch me.<eos> You're not Sarcoma.<eos> I swear to God I am.<eos> Junk code, two minutes.<eos> Speak.<eos> I followed Carter home, and there's something you got to see.<eos> Um... I'm sending it over to Cable right now.<eos> My God.<eos> He did it, in less than two minutes.<eos> Unbelievable.
What's up, Cable?<eos> You know those 300 pages of code. Sarcoma found on the thumb drive?<eos> I finally figured out what they are: A back door.<eos> A secret opening into E.J.'s code that allows users to hack in and control the vehicle.<eos> It's what was used to kill Adam, and it's in every copy of E.J.<eos> Ginny says she searched every byte of E.J.<eos> It's called a Heisenbug.<eos> It doesn't show up on scans.<eos> Here are three examples of code, written by<eos> Adam, Ginny and Carter.
He thought that I was choosing my work over our friendship.<eos> He was my best friend, and he was right.<eos> Well, Carter's admission that he sabotaged E.J. means your company is not liable.<eos> But it also means that E.J. can be hacked.<eos> You know, our investors will leave us in droves.<eos> Look, if you win, you can find new investors, but if you lose, there's no company left to invest in.<eos> Right, but if I can just patch up that back door, then the problem disappears.<eos> I'm never giving up on E.J.<eos> It's just a machine.<eos> To you.
I didn't take this case to save your tech company.<eos> I took it to help you, to help you move on, and do all the incredible things that you need to do.<eos> And if you don't, your only legacy will be that you were the girl who created the killer self-driving car.<eos> That's why you put Dean on the stand.<eos> To manipulate me.<eos> At least come for the verdict.<eos> Okay, but I won't testify.<eos> Ginny, would you like me to stop for some coffee?<eos> I can't believe I left Carter like that.<eos> So alone.
I'm in the car, too.<eos> It's not working, the door's been laced with malware.<eos> Enter the back door multiple times at once, okay?<eos> Force a shutdown.<eos> I'd be impressed if I wasn't about to die.<eos> 200, 400, 800 entrances in the back door.<eos> Still nothing. 1,600, 3,200, 6,400...<eos> Systems down!<eos> You sure you wouldn't like some coffee?<eos> Maybe a cappuccino?
Committing to someone?<eos> I know it used to, but what about now?<eos> Depends on the person, I guess.<eos> Sounds like things are getting serious between you and Naomi.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Big step, her moving to New York.<eos> Earl Slavitt... Shot and killed an assistant U.S. attorney, a man named Tom Simon.<eos> You want someone to suffer for what happened to your friend.<eos> - Yes. He was murdered.<eos> - Not by me.
After several friends told her they'd heard Carter joking about her being a lousy lay.<eos> And you think that motivated Sophie's accusations?<eos> It's possible.<eos> I mean, look, we're talking about college kids here.<eos> They don't always have a sense of proportion on anything they do or say.<eos> Travis Carter was a complete jerk to women, but we couldn't prove he was a rapist.<eos> Sophie Hausen, on the other hand... her DNA's on the murder weapon.<eos> Tess.<eos> Your friend was downstairs looking for you.<eos> Matty.
And I'm closer to Sophie's height.<eos> All yours.<eos> Travis was shot in the lower abdomen five times.<eos> - Nice grouping.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Holes match up to a shooter of Sophie's height.<eos> Down pillow wasn't conducive to a clean getaway.<eos> Friction from the bullets creates static electricity, causing the feathers to stick to you.<eos> There were none in the hallway.<eos> - None what?
You just told us as much.<eos> And we have strong evidence that whoever killed him got injured trying to get away.<eos> And even stronger evidence that you went to the ER two days after the murder... an infected cut on your hand.<eos> Probably because you avoided treatment the night of the murder.<eos> Look, Travis Carter got what he deserved, but he didn't get it from me.<eos> Then how'd you get the gash on your hand?<eos> I make Shaker furniture as a hobby.<eos> I was turning a chair leg on the lathe, and the chisel broke.<eos> You guys are sure it's not any of the other girls?<eos> Other girls?
Congratulations on terrorizing your entire female student body.<eos> Enjoy your legacy.<eos> We don't usually see you here for this part.<eos> I wanted to make sure Sophie was okay.<eos> Even now, she has a long road ahead.<eos> Well, at least she doesn't have to go it alone.<eos> Maya.<eos> Brave women.<eos> I want in.<eos> On...?

So when you hip your bosses to our numbers and they get visible hard-ons, have them move quickly.<eos> Erlich, you're with me.<eos> - It's "hards-on."<eos> - What?<eos> "Hards-on" not "hard-ons."<eos> It's a syntactical error that I could've remedied if you had just given me the space to speak.<eos> Erlich, seeing you Thursday, right?<eos> You better believe it.<eos> Can't wait for it. For, uh...<eos> For Jian-Yang's pitch.
Yes, well, he is... white hot right now.<eos> And that's why I had him reach out directly, and we can't wait to pitch you the idea that is gonna be pitched to you.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> - You have no idea what it is, do you?<eos> - Not a fucking clue.<eos> Always blue! Always blue! Always blue!<eos> Always blue! Always blue! Always blue!<eos> Always blue! - Hey.<eos> - Always bl...
We were just... chanting.<eos> Why? What, the pitches go well?<eos> They went fine, you could say.<eos> You said they went awesome.<eos> All right, thank you, Big Head.<eos> I mean, I did get us a... few offers.<eos> "We" did receive more than a few offers, as "few" often refers to three.<eos> And today, we're four for four.<eos> Huh. Which... I mean, what does that even mean?<eos> Nothing. Nothing at all.
In spite of that, he has raised a real issue here.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> I'm gonna Uber home.<eos> Mr. Monahan, good luck with this whole work-release situation, but I have more important things to do.<eos> Mr. Chugtai.<eos> It appears that 33 percent of your users are under the age of 13.<eos> It's also apparent that you have no parental permission requirements in place.<eos> You're going to want to sit down for this.<eos> - Are you familiar with COPPA?<eos> - Who?
I do have a colleague at Facebook that has a laser microphone.<eos> You can point it at an office window from a mile away and read the sound vibrations.<eos> I like it.<eos> Hoover, you're the only person I can trust at this goddamn company.<eos> It's good to have a friend.<eos> I understand that, sir.<eos> Gavin, there you are.<eos> I don't want to interrupt your talking with Hoover... and talking and talking about things, but I have some concrete news.<eos> - Regarding?<eos> - Jack Barker.
I purposefully started to wade around in the pool.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> No, I didn't fall in.<eos> I, uh... I am not a spaz.<eos> "Belson will be succeeded by 'Action' Jack Barker. "A veteran tech CEO, Barker commented,<eos> "'We at Hooli pledge to work "with the Federal Trade Commission "to resolve this matter and commit ourselves<eos> "to earning back the public trust.'"<eos> Wow, Dinesh, you really stuck it to him.<eos> Now they're pinning it all on Gavin.<eos> - Holy shit.
Is this how you wanna end up?<eos> No.<eos> He's a cautionary tale.<eos> Nope, not true.<eos> Not a cautionary tale.<eos> Got a lot of work to do. I'll be in the pool.<eos> Not crazy. - I mean, it's like, wow.<eos> - Richard...<eos> Hey, Erlich.<eos> Just FYI.
I'm like the class clown already.<eos> Why is my name on the board?<eos> _<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Laurie, you wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, Monica, sit.<eos> Are you pregnant?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - On?
How am I to trust you?<eos> Alfred put Aethelred in command of his armies...<eos> Tomorrow we ride.<eos> I would like you to travel with me.<eos> To battle?<eos> ..and we were sent to take back the city but found not a soul.<eos> If we wish, there is a way to raise the greatest army these shores have ever seen.<eos> Lord!<eos> It's a signal that can be seen from a mile or more.<eos> Thyra!

The forest!
It's a signal that can be seen from a mile or more.<eos> Thyra!<eos> Death is coming.<eos> The forest! The forest!<eos> It's a trick, I know it.<eos> And I fear terrible consequences.<eos> Destiny is all.<eos> No, no.<eos> Please, God, let this not be true.<eos> Thyra!
It is late.<eos> I was about to sit, contemplate.<eos> As is your habit, Lord. I have been waiting for you.<eos> Lord, I hope you will forgive me for what I'm about to say.<eos> My intentions are for Wessex, for the hope of an England.<eos> You spoke of paying for Aethelflaed's release in one of two ways-with silver, or with blood.<eos> I did.<eos> There is a third way.<eos> Should the ransom be too great, should the likely loss of men be too great, should Wessex wish to emerge with honour, Lord, and greater strength then should she not be encouraged to take her own life?<eos> For the good of the kingdom.
They will want to humiliate us.<eos> In what way?<eos> An insult, a challenge.<eos> Why Because they can.<eos> Haesten.<eos> We're travelling to Beamfleot.<eos> For Alfred?<eos> For Alfred, yes.<eos> I am here to take you on to the fortress, Lord.<eos> You and two others.
We walked them for miles, see they are fed and watered.<eos> Horses and slaves.<eos> You are called Sihtric?<eos> Yes, Lord.<eos> Good evening to you, Lord.<eos> Uhtred says you can be trusted.<eos> So you will take him this letter.<eos> This is a great responsibility.<eos> They will have no peace.<eos> None.
I am a moth to the flame.<eos> Yes, it is becoming a significant amount.<eos> Significant is the word, Lord, in its size and its effect.<eos> - Your father... - The King?<eos> He would have done the same.<eos> Pay such a ransom for his offspring, Lord?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> I was a great disappointment to him... which I regret.<eos> But if you were not such a disappointment, Aethelwold, I may have had you killed.<eos> For the good of Wessex.
It is three nights before the first of the silver will arrive.<eos> We must be ready.<eos> Tomorrow there will be no more ale, no more games, no more fighting over women!<eos> But that is tomorrow.<eos> Tonight... we drink as if there were no tomorrow!<eos> Lady!<eos> Have faith.<eos> It is tonight.<eos> Get the shields!<eos> Rypere!
I want them dead!<eos> Everyone after them!<eos> Go!<eos> Lord, I'm grateful to see you, as are my men.<eos> I've told each one of them we are here on the orders of Alfred.<eos> Lord, as you appear to have marched an army to their door, I doubt the Northmen will believe you are not here to fight.<eos> Why, 0dda?<eos> Why?<eos> For Wessex, Lord.<eos> Only for Wessex.
What are they saying?<eos> They're asking where he's been.<eos> I met an asset in Basel.<eos> Then, I traveled to Badenweiler.<eos> Under what name?<eos> Glen Weller.<eos> Two points.<eos> We need one more.<eos> And after Badenweiler, where did you go.<eos> To Oslo.

You know how Owen says operatives should be able to read a room?<eos> You should probably work on that.<eos> Hey.<eos> This is on him.<eos> Has yours...?<eos> Yours?<eos> No, and no sign of you-know-who back at the Farm yet.<eos> Well, I guess she doesn't have time to train us and teach at the same time.<eos> I'm just glad to finally know who I'm working for.<eos> The real CIA.
_<eos> _<eos> You get him to the rendezvous point.<eos> - I'll meet you there.<eos> - Yeah, all right.<eos> Is this what you wanted?<eos> Not just get yourself killed, but your recruits, too?<eos> How do we even know they're Bundes...<eos> Bundes...<eos> Bundesnachrichtendienst?
It wasn't for money.<eos> We were broke when she died!<eos> She believed in what we were doing, Daniel.<eos> No!<eos> She believed in you.<eos> She trusted you.<eos> She died because of you.<eos> And nothing ever happened to you, did it?<eos> You went home to your little family, and I went home to nothing.<eos> No father. No relatives.

- _ - Oh, my God.<eos> What?<eos> _<eos> You're right. I'm late. How late?<eos> Like... five days late.<eos> Oh, baby!<eos> Jane V could be due soon, all right.<eos> Aren't you on the pill?<eos> Ugh, I skipped when we were camping, - but that was one day.<eos> - Damn.
Is this a... - _ - a plus, or a lightning bolt?<eos> It's nothing. My mom's test was expired.<eos> I'll have to buy one tomorrow.<eos> Kind of a letdown.<eos> So, you'd be excited?<eos> I mean, it's sooner than we thought, but our family already started earlier than we planned.<eos> That's true.<eos> What?<eos> I'm just thinking about a little baby Michael.<eos> Or a little baby Jane.
I mean, they cut my penis.<eos> Oh, my God, they cut my penis!<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> You can't just cut away right in the middle of my...<eos> Calm down, please. I will not calm down!<eos> They never would have done that to Brad Pitt.<eos> And I never would have taken a role in this indie hack movie if I'd known they were going to humiliate me by not showing my penis.<eos> Would you stop saying that? Why should I?<eos> The movie's boring, and slow and it had one thing going for it:<eos> my provocative penis.
Here. You can open your eyes now.<eos> You're doing it?<eos> Brad Pitt started out dressed as a chicken handing out coupons on Hollywood Boulevard.<eos> Who says I can't make a pit stop in reality TV on my way to super stardom?<eos> So we're gonna have to do this for the cameras again.<eos> Okay?<eos> I can't wait...<eos> To actually stop waitressing.<eos> Move on to the next phase, you know?<eos> Publishing.
You thought you were safe before.<eos> Yes, well, I'm bound to be right eventually, aren't I?<eos> Get me some history.<eos> You ok?<eos> Yeah... just a little... freaked, I think.<eos> Try not to breathe so fast.<eos> A single line of instruction was sent to all suits<eos> "Deactivate your organic component".<eos> - Organic component... as in PEOPLE?<eos> - Oooh...
This way!<eos> Move!<eos> 'You look like you're trying to run.<eos> Would you like some help with that?<eos> '<eos> Can you shut your girlfriend up?<eos> Velma!<eos> That was her name!<eos> 'Confirmed.<eos> - No way through.
Breathe out...<eos> Breathe in...<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Breathe out...<eos> - Anybody?<eos> - Tasker!<eos> - Breathe in...<eos> - Hello?<eos> !<eos> - Tasker!
And none of us have more than 3,000 breaths left.<eos> Then stop wasting them.<eos> I need a map of the base and a full rundown on what happened here.<eos> Who the hell put you in charge?<eos> I'm here to save your lives.<eos> But if you don't want me to, just raise your hand.<eos> Abby, get the man a map. All right?<eos> Some of my best friends are bluish.<eos> - Why is Velma the only one that talks?<eos> - "Velma"?
Now we know now why your suit was being repaired.<eos> Bill...<eos> Bill!<eos> You're about to be exposed to the vacuum of space.<eos> Oh, God...!<eos> So, don't hold your breath.<eos> - Or my lungs will explode...<eos> - You were listening.<eos> Suit?<eos> Velma?
You're about to be exposed to the vacuum of space.<eos> Oh, God...!<eos> So, don't hold your breath.<eos> - Or my lungs will explode...<eos> - You were listening.<eos> Suit?<eos> Velma?<eos> - 'Good morning.<eos> How may I assist? '<eos> - Shhh, shh!
Oh, no, they're fine.<eos> What?<eos> Are we safe?<eos> What's stopping them?<eos> This whole area's new.<eos> It's not in their mapping system.<eos> See!<eos> You know, like when your satnav doesn't know a new road?<eos> - So, they can't come here?<eos> - Not without a floor plan.
Oh, don't get all gooey on me.<eos> - It's temporary.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Once we get back to the TARDIS.<eos> - The TARDIS?<eos> I've got stuff in there that'll cure anything.<eos> Failing that, I think I've got some spare eyes somewhere.<eos> They're from a lizard, but I'm sure they'll fit.<eos> So, until then...
You're going to get me in trouble.<eos> Everyone knows there are ghosts in the hill.<eos> Wait! You'll hear it in a minute.<eos> That's ghosts.<eos> If you stay out here listening to ghosts, they will come out of the hill and eat you.<eos> They won't. They will.<eos> And I'll get the blame.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> I can hear it.<eos> Judy!
There is so much that you don't understand about Roman Britain.<eos> - I got an A star.<eos> - "Got an A star."<eos> I've lived in Roman Britain.<eos> Governed. Farmed.<eos> Juggled.<eos> And speaking as a former vestal virgin, second class,<eos> I can assure you... I bet you there's a Roman legion down there.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Second class?
And speaking as a former vestal virgin, second class,<eos> I can assure you... I bet you there's a Roman legion down there.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Second class?<eos> Fine.<eos> You go and check the river.<eos> I'll go and find their last battlefield.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll meet you back here with a Roman soldier.<eos> Yeah, but seriously - second class?
That was the sound of my patience shattering into a billion little pieces.<eos> Now, there are only two things that I need to know.<eos> Where is my friend and what destroyed the Roman army?<eos> I destroyed the Roman army.<eos> Really?<eos> What? You, just on your own?<eos> That's quite a trick.<eos> I am the gatekeeper.<eos> Gatekeeper.<eos> What gate?
No problem.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> You have to eat.<eos> How much food have we got left?<eos> Enough. Really?<eos> Shut up, Cornelius.<eos> Go on, eat it.<eos> It's two days, you haven't had anything.<eos> I've never been lost this long, I need to find him.<eos> Who?

No-one else can do this, not like I can.<eos> We can.<eos> I'm ready. I'll guard the gate with you.<eos> I'll fight by your side.<eos> Awesome!<eos> Brilliant! You'll be a hero for two seconds.<eos> And then the whole solar system will be devoured.<eos> Stop him!<eos> This is my destiny.<eos> My fight. Out of my way.
Advance!<eos> Come on!<eos> What's that?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Too many of them going through at once.<eos> This place is unstable.<eos> We need to get out of here.<eos> Now!<eos> I know you're inclined to bear a grudge, so just remember I know about 10% of your secrets.<eos> The dark secrets.
_<eos> - Hayes, thanks for coming down. - I was hoping for brunch, but an active crime scene is a close second.<eos> Missed you this morning.<eos> Believe me, I'd rather still be in bed with you.<eos> - Remember the Black Orchid Killer?<eos> - Serial killer... yeah.<eos> It was national news.<eos> Terrified the city.<eos> It was like Summer of Sam all over again.<eos> And for a damn good reason.
And I know I'm strange.<eos> I wonder how many boxes the real killer will check... if they catch him.<eos> What's CIU doing here?<eos> This is an NYPD crime scene.<eos> Well, I'm not here officially.<eos> Just checking up on an old friend.<eos> - How you been, Nick?<eos> - Good.<eos> Still breathing, still single.<eos> What about you?
He was a good man.<eos> You must have been surprised when he was arrested.<eos> Oh, more than surprised.<eos> Now I'm not saying that Clark wasn't an odd duck, but he was funny and hardworking.<eos> I liked doing deliveries with him.<eos> Ah, time clock stubs are in the office.<eos> Clark was a real stickler for time.<eos> He never would have let anyone punch in and out for him.<eos> And the clock's accurate?<eos> To the minute.
He got out of his truck, headed straight for her building.<eos> I could see him looking.<eos> I could see him looking in her window.<eos> She was in a ground-floor apartment.<eos> I almost confronted him.<eos> Told him to get away from the window, but I decided better mind my own business.<eos> Didn't want to start a fight.<eos> And you're certain that this is the man you saw?<eos> Yes. Definitely.<eos> No doubt about it.
Joe's a drinker.<eos> My husband's in recovery.<eos> And...<eos> I made a choice for my family.<eos> But Joe never hurt me.<eos> And he didn't hurt those other women.<eos> Detective Cestero, thanks for coming by.<eos> I was surprised to hear from you after yesterday.<eos> We may not agree about Joe Kaplan, but I figure we're both after the same thing.<eos> The truth, yes.
And he didn't hurt those other women.<eos> Detective Cestero, thanks for coming by.<eos> I was surprised to hear from you after yesterday.<eos> We may not agree about Joe Kaplan, but I figure we're both after the same thing.<eos> The truth, yes.<eos> No matter who it points to.<eos> So what's all this?<eos> What's up, man?<eos> Frankie.<eos> Cestero.
73 Newtons is what's required to fracture the human skull.<eos> I just swung 78.<eos> See, bone is stronger than concrete and steel.<eos> So the kind of damage found in B.O.K.'s victims would have been 80 to 100 Newtons.<eos> Medical records show Joe's childhood injury left him unable to raise his right dominant hand above his head.<eos> Looks like the lower angle only generates 50 Newtons.<eos> That's not enough.<eos> Whoever murdered these women hit with more force than Joe was capable of.<eos> So he couldn't have killed Marla.<eos> Or any of the other women.
They must be inside.<eos> He was like that when we got here.<eos> Seems he got in through the back door.<eos> She shot him.<eos> It's okay, May.<eos> He's dead.<eos> You sure?<eos> He will never hurt you again.<eos> May DeFranco killed Don Cutler.<eos> Good for her.
Let him.<eos> He and his people killed our families and friends.<eos> Maybe yours, too.<eos> Maybe, but he's the only one who knows where Syd might be.<eos> How do you know you're not chasing a ghost?<eos> Because I don't see a body, and I don't leave my friends behind.<eos> I'm going to rescue those who are deserving.<eos> If you'd like to show some gratitude, you can join me instead of wasting time on him.<eos> Dr. Rivera, he's bucking the vent.<eos> Dr. Rivera?

Okay?<eos> Do you understand?<eos> There you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Water?
I don't do drugs.<eos> Well, your violent behavior disagrees.<eos> Last thing I remember was eating pizza and doing laundry.<eos> Laundry at midnight?<eos> I keep odd hours 'cause of my work.<eos> I'm a cellist.<eos> Cello is my life.<eos> My neighbor hates it when I practice.<eos> So I play wherever I can.<eos> A cellist.
There's a new regime here at San Antonio Memorial.<eos> And we'd like nothing more than to serve those who have served us.<eos> So if you'll excuse me, I have a surgery to prepare for.<eos> Okay, okay, that's enough.<eos> Let's go.<eos> When we have an update you'll be the first to know.<eos> Until then, out of the E.R.<eos> Let's go. Come.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> No comment.
Well, what does that mean?<eos> Well, you came back to work here without Topher.<eos> So you agreed to Julian's terms, right?<eos> No.<eos> I lied.<eos> What?<eos> I told him what he wanted to hear just so I can get the surgery for Mac.<eos> Scott, I don't know if I could actually work for that man.<eos> I mean, especially after what he did to Topher. I just...<eos> - No offense.
Our spotters just called.<eos> Helicopters took off from a Syrian airbase nearby.<eos> They're coming to double tap us.<eos> Sounds bad.<eos> They know we rescue victims of their bombings, so they send follow up sorties to target us.<eos> When they arrive, I suggest you be elsewhere.<eos> Wait.<eos> So where are you going?<eos> We're taking everyone we can to the base near the border.<eos> What base?
You're gonna do this on the count of three. Okay?<eos> Abby, I can't do this.<eos> - One... two... three!<eos> - I'm not doing this!<eos> - Sofia, you gotta let go!<eos> - I can't!<eos> I can't.<eos> Save me!<eos> Please pull me up!<eos> Help!
- I'm not doing this!<eos> - Sofia, you gotta let go!<eos> - I can't!<eos> I can't.<eos> Save me!<eos> Please pull me up!<eos> Help!<eos> - Sofia, let go or we'll all fall.<eos> - I can't hold on.<eos> Help!
President Shiraz will enter from the east door.<eos> - Which Israel approved?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I will confirm with the prime minister's office.<eos> I do not want to lose this peace deal over who gets the top bunk.<eos> Sorry, I just saw the seating chart.<eos> Is this right?<eos> Yes.<eos> We'll approve the west entrance with<eos> - Prime Minister Aaronson.
It's out of my control.<eos> You have to know that I can't ask Israel to give up its most important deal point without offering them something in exchange.<eos> What do you ask now?<eos> Cut all ties to Hezbollah, political and financial, effective immediately.<eos> That is outrageous.<eos> Hezbollah hasn't taken credit for this attack.<eos> But you've already agreed to end your support for Hezbollah as soon as the agreement is final.<eos> I'm just asking you to say so now.<eos> It's... an... an act of empathy for a country in grief.<eos> For this concession,
Uh, yeah, a bit.<eos> Bible's pretty crazy, man.<eos> Part of Revelation's enduring power is its intense imagery and symbolism.<eos> That's why every age has its own interpretation of it.<eos> Now, there's a strong possibility that this group's understanding of the seven seals will include some reference to the government siege on their compound in Bolivia, so let's start with those verses.<eos> Bring it.<eos> Okay.<eos> The opening of the fourth seal releases what?<eos> Uh... The four horsemen...<eos> Of the Apocalypse.
You can't think the FBI is the only law enforcement agency I have a relationship with.<eos> Elizabeth, none of this changes the fact that the WITSEC list is still in play.<eos> She knows who I am.<eos> Emma knightly can be trusted.<eos> I wouldn't have put you in otherwise.<eos> You wouldn't have put me in if she'd been reporting back to you.<eos> So whether or not she can be trusted remains to be seen.<eos> What's so urgent?<eos> I found our in.<eos> To helldritch?
You've been ages.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We only have two darts.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Hell no.<eos> Get something to restrain him!<eos> Somebody want to tell me what the hell's going on?<eos> Jessica, find something.<eos> I'm looking.<eos> Help!
Is it safe for you to drink and taxiderm?<eos> The wine helps silence the inner critic.<eos> I'm so glad this case is finally over and we can celebrate.<eos> Larry, we still have to mount our defense.<eos> Maybe you should be on trial for killing the mood.<eos> Okay, guys, let's take a look at the murder board.<eos> Murder board!<eos> Murder...<eos> Really?<eos> No chanting?
Yes, I do. Although Summer's the key.<eos> With the reasonable doubt I've established, all she has to do is portray you as the normal, accessible guy that you are.<eos> W-What are you doing?<eos> ! It's not your birthday party.<eos> Where do you keep your candle snuffer?<eos> In the 1800s.<eos> I'm sure the taxidermist has something in the back.<eos> He must entertain.<eos> Larry, your cellphone's ringin'.<eos> What the hell?
They're...<eos> They're from Summer.<eos> What did they say?<eos> They're of the... "I hate you, I never want to see you" variety with some F-bombs sprinkled in liberally.<eos> She's a powerful writer, just like me, but with a stronger grasp of feces-shaped emojis.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It's a little cartoon doodie.<eos> No.<eos> Why would Summer text her that?<eos> Summer and Margaret..
Okay, Summer didn't like Margaret, but luckily she was out of town, so she couldn't have murdered her.<eos> Right. She couldn't have done it.<eos> But she was in town.<eos> She was in town?<eos> Oh, man, I'm glad I'm finding this out now and not on the stand.<eos> When was the last time they fought?<eos> I remember the morning that Margaret died, - they had a tiny fight. - Ugh!<eos> I'd barely even call it a kerfuffle... because Margaret was wearing some of Adelaide's old jewelry that Summer believed belonged to her.<eos> She made a big scene and stormed off to her uncle's.<eos> Her uncle's?
I remember the morning that Margaret died, - they had a tiny fight. - Ugh!<eos> I'd barely even call it a kerfuffle... because Margaret was wearing some of Adelaide's old jewelry that Summer believed belonged to her.<eos> She made a big scene and stormed off to her uncle's.<eos> Her uncle's?<eos> So, you mean Jeremiah?<eos> I certainly don't mean her Uncle Harry.<eos> I haven't spoken to my twin brother in years.<eos> You have a twin brother?<eos> Did that never come up?<eos> - Not even once! - Hmm.
I know how to say it.<eos> She hated Margaret.<eos> But if you're implying she had anything to do with her death you're barking up the wrong tree.<eos> I never said that.<eos> I'm just trying to do my due diligence before I put her on the stand.<eos> Because Summer had an alibi.<eos> I remember she went to a concert that night.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you remember who she saw?<eos> Michael Jackson.
Approximately 13% of my family has been conceived there.<eos> What were you doing at the Jessups'?<eos> You go to the Jessups'?<eos> We should hang.<eos> We should not.<eos> I had a fight with Margaret over Adelaide's jewelry, and I went to the Jessup Farm to blow off some steam.<eos> - It is not a big deal.<eos> - It kind of is!<eos> Do you remember anything else from that evening that might paint you in a bad light?<eos> - Not at all.
That way, I can control the narrative.<eos> It's just a slight change in strategy.<eos> Instead of the doting daughter,<eos> Summer is the troubled kid who never liked Margaret, but who came back just to testify for her dad.<eos> In a lot of ways, it makes our case stronger.<eos> You think that's true?<eos> I'm certainly telling myself that.<eos> Good morning, Counselor.<eos> I'm very excited to see who you're feeding to me on the stand today.<eos> - Bon appétit.
Well, unlike you, I don't need 28 days to make my case.<eos> Speaking of 28 days, how we doing with that?<eos> Two days late, but I'm sure it's due to stress.<eos> Good.<eos> Good, good, good, good, good.<eos> Josh sent me to the Jessup family farm to get more information about Summer's whereabouts the night Margaret died.<eos> She claims not to remember anything, so in order to re-create her experience, I will drink a hallucinogenic tea called ayahuasca.<eos> Users claim it can give you a spiritual awakening, as well as intense diarrhea.<eos> I am not looking forward to a spiritual awakening.<eos> Bottoms up.
Yeah, we did.<eos> Okay, and now I think you're just making fun of me.<eos> So, Mr. Hinkle, you are considered an expert in your field of forensic pathology.<eos> That's right.<eos> I climbed the DNA ladder all the way to the top.<eos> Is it your expert opinion that the DNA found in the semen in Mrs. Henderson's bed did not belong to Mr. Henderson?<eos> That's right.<eos> It belonged to Rutger Hiss.<eos> Belonged... to...<eos> Rutger Hiss.
Uh, okay, so, I have a medical condition...<eos> So you contaminate every room you walk into?<eos> Is it fair to say you've got semen on your hands right now?<eos> Well, it's not fair, uh, but it is true.<eos> Ew. No further questions.<eos> Ohh, boy!<eos> Who needs?<eos> Mr. Segal, your next witness.<eos> O-One moment, Your Honor.<eos> - Any word from Dwayne?
Meghan stayed.<eos> And your step-dad made her life a kind of hell<eos> I can't even imagine, but you can.<eos> You know what he's capable of.<eos> You know he'll kill her.<eos> If you came back to ve her, this is how you do it.<eos> He tried to kill me too.<eos> Meghan saved me.<eos> It was that summer we all went to camp.<eos> Um... Hideaway.
Damn it, Frank.<eos> No box.<eos> Counter okay?<eos> I'd like a booth, please.<eos> Do you feel it yet? The pain?<eos> 'Cause what you did to those women, what you did to my mother... this isn't even close.<eos> They can't help you.<eos> The only way this stops is you tell me where you moved that body.<eos> - Everything okay in here? - Help!<eos> Oh, hey...
King of the world.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What do you know?<eos> Up, scum.<eos> Pretty sure that's the anger controlling you.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _
James Weckler hanged himself in his cell this morning.<eos> _<eos> Clive, sometimes we work so hard solving murders that we forget to pat ourselves on the back.<eos> Wouldn't it be amazing if every time you caught a perp in a lie or found a clue, you got a reward?<eos> This star is for telling a spouse his partner was unfaithful.<eos> This smiley face is for your great bedside manner.<eos> Look.<eos> Piper doesn't know her cars.<eos> DMV says Eleanor owns a black Camry.<eos> Not a Civic.
Mrs. Pennybaker caught me and confiscated it.<eos> Did Lizzy Bealer ever find out that you loved her?<eos> Oh, hell, yeah.<eos> Mrs. Pennybaker read my love note to the class.<eos> That's traumatic.<eos> Well, I'll tell you one thing.<eos> Mrs. Pennybaker cured me of note-passing.<eos> No!<eos> Note passing is a time-honored means of communication between young sweethearts.<eos> Not for this kid.
I'm here most nights.<eos> And how long have you been...<eos> - A year.<eos> - Two months.<eos> - No, we've been together for...<eos> - Dating for longer.<eos> But engaged for two months.<eos> Got it.<eos> Have you set a date?<eos> - June 29th.
When do I get to meet Uncle Rhys?<eos> - How about never?<eos> - That can wait.<eos> So, you met, fell in love, and, for 15 years, you were happy together?<eos> I was. Or thought I was.<eos> Your mother and I wanted different things.<eos> Yes, I wanted to steal from Alice Vaughan.<eos> He wanted to marry her.<eos> So you gave up everything...<eos> The Firm, your whole life together...

Troy, where is she going?<eos> To take down some arms dealers.<eos> Troy, just because you know everything, doesn't mean you have to say everything.<eos> I go outside for 10 seconds.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> According to the file I saw at the Bureau, Justine's husband was on assignment to infiltrate some arms dealers, code-named Argosy.<eos> The operation was highly classified, then terminated two months later.<eos> That was six months ago.<eos> Everyone came home.<eos> Except for Eddie.
So maybe you should tell me what the hell is going on, psycho?<eos> What's going on is you're about to do everything I say.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> 'Cause I've seen all the naked selfies you've been sending to Arabella's boyfriend, Tad.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> Yes. I've seen everything.<eos> So if you want to keep your best friend, you're going to turn around, put on your biggest birthday smile, and tell anyone who asks that I'm your cousin from...<eos> Where am I from again?<eos> - Newport Beach.

What choice do you have?<eos> You have no idea how this feels, do you?<eos> You think I've never been betrayed?<eos> You could not be more wrong.<eos> Her name was Felicity.<eos> And where is she now?<eos> She's gone.<eos> But I know what happened.<eos> I have my answers.<eos> And yet... no closure whatsoever.
You can tell me everything you know about this son of a bitch.<eos> Hey, could you help me break into Heather's apartment?<eos> What?<eos> I called and texted and e-mailed, and she's not responding.<eos> We have to get in there.<eos> I need to get onto her network.<eos> Isn't this how the whole thing started...<eos> By you asking your friend Heather to do something illegal?<eos> Like you don't break into people's houses all the time.<eos> Not for fun.

I'm sending you a photo of us all at the annual murderers' Christmas party.<eos> Willy Grace, okay.<eos> Well, now that I've solved your little murder mystery, I need you to help me with a job this afternoon.<eos> Fine, but first, tell me how to find Willy Grace.<eos> Well you see, now, I'm afraid that will cost you a peen pic.<eos> What am I looking at?<eos> That is a photo of a man named Willy Grace, also known as John A.C. Kennedy, also known as Syd Quilling.<eos> That is the man who killed Heather.<eos> How did you find out?<eos> My source.
Alice.<eos> What a surprise...<eos> The two of you back together.<eos> What's surprising is that people are still willing to do business with you after everything you've done.<eos> Do you recognize this woman?<eos> Heather Reynolds.<eos> These are crime-scene photos, implicating an assassin named Willy Grace, who called you six minutes after he murdered her, according to these phone records.<eos> Bold presentation, but it'll never hold up in a court of law.<eos> What about the court of public opinion?<eos> Your press packet.
We're gonna spread so much dirt on Raymond Taggart to his employees that by the time he returns to this party, he'll be walking into a mutiny.<eos> Of course I was gonna pay you.<eos> Of course your husband will get his stipend.<eos> Of course not, Frank.<eos> I-I wouldn't sleep with your wife.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Seems you're not very popular, Raymond.<eos> Not only are your people cross with you, but most of them have defected.<eos> - Defected?<eos> - To the Kensington Firm.
Making good use of Mother's spell book, like you said we would... to find Snow White.<eos> Regina, please.<eos> Not everyone gets a second chance at love.<eos> Put all this aside and go find that man.<eos> Remember how you said this arrow will lead me to gaze upon the person I love most?<eos> Well, there's a very thin line between love and hate.<eos> There.<eos> That's much better.<eos> Now it will lead me to gaze upon the person I hate most.<eos> Snow White.
And I'm a part of you whether you like it or not.<eos> And now I love myself.<eos> Which means so should you.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> It's just a lamp.<eos> I'm more worried about the things that really matter, like Robin.<eos> Please tell me he's okay.<eos> Yes. He's... he's fine.<eos> I actually kept my word and sent him where he wanted to go.<eos> Home.
If they're doing something to it-- contaminating shipments, we don't know exactly what-- people will starve.<eos> Going after people's food?<eos> I thought there were things they wouldn't do.<eos> Well, they're doing the very best they can to track Morozov.<eos> Something's turned up.<eos> He's making a trip to Illinois, the Land of Lincoln.<eos> - When?<eos> - 29th.<eos> To think they once had a Lincoln.<eos> Now a Reagan.
Maybe they watch him for the first couple of months after they move in.<eos> I still don't like showing up on their reports when we go over there.<eos> - Just a matter of time.<eos> - That's what I told him.<eos> You're not taking that home, right?<eos> I think that's Gruzin-McDickoff or whatever.<eos> Let me see the pictures.<eos> Yeah, Gruzinski.<eos> 8:12.<eos> No kids, right?
♪ Can't disguise ♪<eos> Mr. Pirogov.<eos> We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> We wanted to talk with you about your work with Amtorg.<eos> If you'd be willing to talk with us and help us figure out certain things we need to know, we can offer you help.<eos> You missed the meeting.<eos> Stay away from me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> An order came in from the Centre.<eos> No assassinations without the approval of all departments at the Centre and the local rezidents.
Oh, my God.<eos> Does Kelsey not know?<eos> Not know what?<eos> Okay.<eos> So your real age is like a secret-secret.<eos> Liza, I know you're 40.<eos> Wha... What?<eos> Um, why would you say that?<eos> You know that I went to Dartmouth with...<eos> Marta Beem.
Exactly.<eos> I can't believe she's gone a day and I already miss her.<eos> I know, me too.<eos> Do you think she knows how much I love her?<eos> Of course she does.<eos> But I also think that she knows that having a family is gonna be important to you one day.<eos> What's important to me is her.<eos> You know?<eos> I think she's the one.<eos> The one?
We'll go it together, one-by-one.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No problem.<eos> You're so rare... and generous... and extraordinary.<eos> And you are on a deadline.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> I'm so grateful to Empirical, and especially Diana Trout, for taking a chance on my novel.<eos> And as a special salute, I would like to present Diana with this gift.<eos> "P is for Pigeon" is about the world's last passenger pigeon, but since they're extinct now, I'd love you to enjoy this...<eos> This equally magnificent creature.
- I love you.<eos> You were everything to me.<eos> - And you are everything to me.<eos> - Liza, Liza...<eos> - You have to forgive me.<eos> - Liza!<eos> I didn't care about your teenage daughter, I didn't care about your ex-husband, or having a baby.<eos> I chose you.<eos> But you're a liar.<eos> And a cheater.
Once more, from the top.<eos> Forget about winning the choir competition.<eos> We're screwed.<eos> I was distracted for half the class again.<eos> I'll copy my notes for you later.<eos> Thanks a bunch.<eos> "I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> So I will never apologize-" You call that a reading, Ueno? Forget it.<eos> Screw you too, four-eyes.<eos> Nishimiya.
"Teach me how to say -Sahara Miyoko-"<eos> Ta - ada mi - go.. ko<eos> "sa.." Keep scoring them brownie points.<eos> I love him. He's too cool.<eos> Right?<eos> Oh, he'll be on a TV show next week. Can't miss it for the world.<eos> Aren't her clothes lame as hell?<eos> Don't say that, Nao!<eos> Hirose, take that side.<eos> "Nishimiya..."
I don't understand what you're saying!<eos> "Get Lost, Ishida How long are you gonna stick around?"<eos> She really pisses me off...<eos> Nishimiya transferred out.<eos> That's that. Hey, who was on day duty yesterday?<eos> I didn't get the log.<eos> And who was on flower duty?<eos> "Sign language class"<eos> Hello there, Shoko.<eos> Nishimiya!
Is feeding them fun? Oh, okay.<eos> Nishimiya, you probably shouldn't look inside.<eos> Wait, Nishimiya!<eos> Jumped in...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Did something happen to Ishida!<eos> ? Hey, boy!<eos> Ishida jumped into the river! ? Why!<eos> What was that for?<eos> Nishimiya.
Nishimiya, you probably shouldn't look inside.<eos> Wait, Nishimiya!<eos> Jumped in...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Did something happen to Ishida!<eos> ? Hey, boy!<eos> Ishida jumped into the river! ? Why!<eos> What was that for?<eos> Nishimiya.<eos> Nishimiya!
He really came.<eos> Well, you know...<eos> What exactly were you hoping for?<eos> A-And what about you?<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> I'm only here to meet your friend. No dirty thoughts whatsoever.<eos> Right. Your friend...<eos> Is she here?<eos> We're not exactly friends...<eos> Elaborate.
You're only wearing one?<eos> What are you doing, Ueno?<eos> We're gonna have fun throwing it around. Just like old times.<eos> Sorry, Nishimiya.<eos> No way. You're kidding me, Ishida.<eos> Hang on a sec.<eos> Are you two going out?<eos> Of course not.<eos> We're friends.<eos> Friends?
Wait, wait. Before that..<eos> What's up?<eos> Sis...<eos> You have your hair in a ponytail today.<eos> why?<eos> What a weird face.<eos> Ishida needs to see this.<eos> "Massive outbreak of carp today, Not certain how many people will come feed them.<eos> Be there."<eos> Nishimiya-
Hey, Nishimiya!<eos> Ijida, don'd need do go<eos> Wait.<eos> Do I dalk weerd?<eos> Kinda.<eos> Sorry!<eos> It's fine, really.<eos> I-I need to go buy the bread.<eos> See you.<eos> Nishimiya?
Nishimiya?<eos> For me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can I open it?<eos> What the heck are these?<eos> Thanks.<eos> ...moo.<eos> What?<eos> These?<eos> ...moo.
Thanks.<eos> ...moo.<eos> What?<eos> These?<eos> ...moo.<eos> I lub moo!<eos> Moon?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It is very pretty today.<eos> N-Nishimiya?
No. we are not.<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> Eveything would've been fine and dandy if it wasn't for Nishmiya, right?<eos> We don't know that.<eos> But I do.<eos> If she wasn't around, things wouldn't have gotten awkward between Sahara and I.<eos> And you and Shimada wouldn't have fallen out.<eos> I want to go back to how things were before she came.<eos> The thing with Shimada...
I'll be fine from here.<eos> "To Nishimiya Funeral"<eos> Later.<eos> Hang in there, Yuzuru.<eos> Ishida.<eos> I'm still scared.<eos> "Hey, Nishimiya Would you like to go somewhere tomorrow?"<eos> Awesome!<eos> Let's go check it out.<eos> Nishimiya?
I'm still scared.<eos> "Hey, Nishimiya Would you like to go somewhere tomorrow?"<eos> Awesome!<eos> Let's go check it out.<eos> Nishimiya?<eos> That scared me.<eos> Why are you apologizing?<eos> Of course not!<eos> Say, let's hang out tomorrow too.<eos> Okay, Nishimiya?
Of course not!<eos> Say, let's hang out tomorrow too.<eos> Okay, Nishimiya?<eos> She said I'd end up unhappy if I was with her.<eos> I'm the one who made her miserable.<eos> I wanna see the ocean.<eos> I wanna love people.<eos> Even monsters have hearts...<eos> I don't feel like I can ever fix this.<eos> Hey, Nishimiya!
That reminds me, Ishida.<eos> Could you go get my camera for me?<eos> Pardon me...<eos> Whoa, it's dark.<eos> Nishimiya? I'm coming in.<eos> There it is.<eos> Is it charged?<eos> You can see the fireworks from here?<eos> Oh, she's here.<eos> Nishimiya?
Whoa, it's dark.<eos> Nishimiya? I'm coming in.<eos> There it is.<eos> Is it charged?<eos> You can see the fireworks from here?<eos> Oh, she's here.<eos> Nishimiya?<eos> W-W-Wait a second.<eos> What are you doing, Nishimiya?<eos> Nishimiya?

Why, Nishimiya...?<eos> Nishimiya, grab the ledge!<eos> I beg you, God.<eos> Please give me one last ounce of strength.<eos> I won't run away from things anymore.<eos> From now on,<eos> I'll look at people's face.<eos> From now on, I'll listen to their voices.<eos> From tomorrow, I promise to do things right.<eos> Nishimiya...
I'm not as strong as you.<eos> Even when Ishida does wake up, I won't know how to face him.<eos> I couldn't change<eos> I failed to protect you again!<eos> I'm still the same old coward.<eos> You gan jange from now,<eos> Tahada...<eos> Thank you for coming, Sho.<eos> Jeez, cut that out.<eos> Nishimiya.
Nishimiya.<eos> I found you.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> You know,<eos> This is kinda weird, huh?<eos> I... wanted to die...<eos> Oh.<eos> Tuesday will be over soon.<eos> Later,<eos> Nishimiya.

Id all my fauld!<eos> If only I were gone... I'm so sowwy!<eos> Listen, Nishimiya<eos> I was talking to you before coming here.<eos> It was within a dream.<eos> Looks like I was trying to give up on everything.<eos> But that wasn't right.<eos> I've felt the same way as you forever, but I realized it didn't mean that I deserved to die.<eos> I want to apologize to the others too.<eos> Hey, Nishimiya. I...

Shall we?<eos> Isn't that Ishida?<eos> Who?<eos> The one who was hospitalized?<eos> The jumper?<eos> I've never told you this before, but I don't fit in at school.<eos> I can't look at people's faces.<eos> So I feel much better when I look down.<eos> I can keep looking down?<eos> N-Nishimiya..
So I feel much better when I look down.<eos> I can keep looking down?<eos> N-Nishimiya..<eos> I can walk just fine.<eos> Thanks, Nishimiya.<eos> This is my class.<eos> Ishida?<eos> It's Ishida!<eos> Are you okay now?<eos> Nishimiya...
Then he shows compassion in killing them.<eos> Then, six months later, he smashes in their skulls.<eos> George, no one is gonna believe that you killed anyone, okay?<eos> Now, do yourself a favor, give us a name and then you and I can start talking about a reduced sentence.<eos> George, tell them what you know.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, I can't.<eos> He said if I talked, he would kill Charley.<eos> Who is Charley?<eos> A friend?
We have indisputable physical evidence, Mr. Hemingway.<eos> Was it so wrong wanting to make a little something on the side?<eos> You know, do something for myself for once.<eos> I mean, half those fools, they'd be back in the lifestyle with or without me.<eos> I bet they can't wait to see you on the other side of the bars.<eos> Okay, you can't send me there.<eos> They'll kill me.<eos> I'm sure they'll show you the same kindness that you showed them.<eos> You ready to go home?<eos> Yes, but not with you.
Take it from those murdering sons of German bitches.<eos> That nest of vipers is all that stands between you and your loved ones.<eos> You're the murdering son of a bitch.<eos> Patrick, no.<eos> Did you say something?<eos> Did you?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Repeat it.<eos> Stop.<eos> Not these men... Not today.
Deena?<eos> What happened?<eos> Just had my eyes opened.<eos> Politics and lies, that's all this job is, right?<eos> You know that.<eos> Pumpkin.<eos> Look, why don't we... have lunch?<eos> You can tell me what's on your mind.<eos> I got to take this.<eos> I... rain check.
Melissa, are you there?<eos> I think Melissa went to get a sandwich.<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> - Security's gonna flip.<eos> - You look good, Patrick.<eos> Doing your part, I see, making sure the bombs drop on time.<eos> You need to go.<eos> That's what you said last time.<eos> How did you avoid the draft?<eos> Flat feet?
Yes, but the first three or four months will fly by while you're kindly filling in for me.<eos> - I'll try not to upstage you. - How kind.<eos> I can't promise I won't bring my own character to it.<eos> Well, I never expected anything less.<eos> That's the advantage of having a character to bring.<eos> Too much character, an excess of character.<eos> Now, look at me and tell me you didn't say that without a little bit of envy.<eos> Just remember who you're standing in for when I'm gone.<eos> My characterless sister.<eos> Your Queen.
- Congratulations, Your Majesty.<eos> - Thank you, Winston.<eos> - An unqualified triumph.<eos> - A narrow escape, I say.<eos> It could so easily have gone the other way.<eos> But it didn't, and has put us right back where we belong.<eos> Higher, in fact.<eos> And, before the tour, our great nation was in danger of losing much of its status, our influence, our standing.<eos> - Your courage and conviction prevailed.<eos> - This time, perhaps.
A general, to whom, when asked if you'd like to dance, you replied, "Yes, but not with you."<eos> I believe there was also a débutante you managed to make cry, and the dancers of Sadler's Wells, whom you refused to meet after arriving late for the performance.<eos> You showed individuality. And that made people panic. They don't want individuality.<eos> The last person who showed "character" almost took the ship down.<eos> You are enjoying this.<eos> - Not a bit.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> Admonishing your unruly young sister.<eos> Have you ever thought how it must be for me?<eos> Many times. At great length. Wistfully.
Please note that I'm here, Nick!<eos> I have to go back to work soon!<eos> Wow! Uh...go, Steve!<eos> You're Steve's mom?<eos> Yes?<eos> Your son's a superstar!<eos> What are you doing way over there?<eos> You have to sit with us!<eos> Really?<eos> With the cool parents?
Oh, a big man clubbing a baby seal?<eos> That is not fair.<eos> That's it, Klaus!<eos> This is the moment she realized life wasn't fair.<eos> That's her trigger.<eos> Then we need to recreate it.<eos> That will snap her out of the deep trance.<eos> Let's go.<eos> That Joe Chandler was a cool dude.<eos> Next time...
We're chill.<eos> We stick together.<eos> Honestly, that's why I date them.<eos> - Huh.<eos> ♪ ♪ - Gah! - What are you doing?<eos> Work.<eos> I'm writing a story for the show.<eos> That doesn't sound like work.<eos> Well, you and my mom agree about that, but I don't see either of you figuring out how to get the cop trapped so the kingpin can run off with Luna.<eos> How about a booby trap?
Yeah, and... wildly inappropriate.<eos> I can't believe this is happening.<eos> This is my baby.<eos> He's 13.<eos> It's totally normal.<eos> When I was 13, I used to feel up Barbie dolls.<eos> I was shocked when I found out real women have nipples.<eos> I rode the mechanical horse outside the supermarket well into my teens.<eos> Yeah, when I was 13, I had sex for the first time. - Oh...<eos> - Hmm? - With a couch.
I should probably go.<eos> I'll give you a call later, Mimi.<eos> Feels like we have so much more to talk about now.<eos> Really missed you.<eos> Well, Martin, it was such a surprise to see you this morning.<eos> Oh, have a great day.<eos> Catch you later.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Oh, my God, Mimi, you had sex with Martin, and in my bed?<eos> Also your steam shower.
Judge who?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, man.<eos> We tracked down the cab driver who picked you up from the airport and then took you to the zoo.<eos> We know you killed Eddie.<eos> Eddie is dead?<eos> That wasn't me.<eos> Okay, the judge reached out to me, and, yes, I went to the zoo to see Eddie, but I did not kill him.<eos> So, what did you come up here for, then?<eos> Little friendly chat?<eos> Maybe a frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity?
Where are you going?<eos> I'm going to talk to some of my other contacts, see what else I can find for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> It's the least I could do.<eos> Thomas Karume came to my village, he killed my father, and he took me, at nine, and my brother, at 12, to fight in the Lord's Resistance Army.<eos> It was all in the name of cleansing and purifying the Acholi, my people.<eos> Karume refers to himself as "Hitler" and "King David."<eos> Really, he's just running a cult.<eos> A very violent cult.
Mr. Lyon, have you sold insurance policies<eos> - to the members of the golf club?<eos> - To nearly every member.<eos> Golf has become my passion, but insurance remains my business.<eos> Next year it will finance my trip to St. Louis<eos> - to play in the Olympic Games. - Oh.<eos> And did you sell such a policy to Mr. Benedict?<eos> I'll tell you all you care to know about if you will play a round with me.<eos> No one goes uninsured after eighteen holes with George Lyon.<eos> Murdoch.
It seems the wounds were made by a club with a narrow base and a flattened head.<eos> That would be a putter, no doubt.<eos> So the murder weapon is still missing.<eos> You two seem to be making a fine day of it.<eos> You should join us for a round sometime.<eos> You must be Mrs. Murdoch.<eos> George Lyon.<eos> Dr. Julia Ogden.<eos> I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid I must be getting back to work.<eos> Another time, then.
- I call it my swingarc perfection device.<eos> As you can see, the device helps to guide your backswing.<eos> Now, if you make an error, - (clanking) - the device lets you know.<eos> Whereas if you keep the club between the rails,<eos> - you have a perfect swing.<eos> - It's quite clever, Detective.<eos> I'm not sure the likes of George Lyon can benefit.<eos> My swing is already one of the purest in the game.<eos> - But is it perfect every time?<eos> - Well... perhaps not every time.
I don't see, uh, much you have to be upset about.<eos> You had no right.<eos> I had no right?<eos> You sent her away!<eos> Of course I did.<eos> This is my life to lead.<eos> No, no, it is not.<eos> I gave you life And I will instruct you on what you do with it.<eos> - I wanted to be an artist.<eos> - An artist?
First they tear it down, now you fill it with plague.<eos> What are you trying to tell me, Cosimo?<eos> Trust me, my friend.<eos> Medici brought the sick inside.<eos> He's turned the church into a pesthouse.<eos> And the workers fear they will catch the plague, if they go inside.<eos> Medici!<eos> Medici, come out here!<eos> Where is your master?<eos> With the sick!
And we know he is banker to the Pope.<eos> But I will show he has used his connection to Rome to cover the fact he commits the sin of usury on the side.<eos> He has corrupted the rules of Christ!<eos> To charge interest.<eos> He even charged one convent 50 Florins on a loan for a new hall to provide meals for the poor.<eos> Third!<eos> Tyranny.<eos> Cosimo de' Medici has great wealth.<eos> And with it, has bought power.<eos> Too much power.
Cosimo de' Medici will you be represented by your son?<eos> Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned against heaven and against you<eos> I repent, I repent against all my sins and trespasses.<eos> Forgive me, Father<eos> I repent.<eos> He cannot answer.<eos> In that case, you may speak on behalf of your father.<eos> My father has declared his love for Florence.<eos> You can see he's a patriot.<eos> Not a traitor.
A man of justice?<eos> I may not have long left.<eos> Please, let me see my wife one last time.<eos> - I was told no visitors. - Only to say goodbye.<eos> Please.<eos> What did they give you?<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> - Arrest this man for corruption.<eos> - On what evidence?
The Medici must always prevail.<eos> Everything else. Everything can be sacrificed.<eos> Cosimo believes this family will survive without him, but it won't.<eos> You are not the man he is and you know that.<eos> On second thoughts, Sforza how soon can we move?<eos> Before sundown. If we have to.<eos> Then I will take Albizzi's head.<eos> As the city's new commander I pledge to defend Florence to the death.<eos> Gentlemen, I have just spoken with Francesco Sforza whose army surrounds us.<eos> And with Lorenzo de' Medici.
I'm sorry?<eos> My niece is being forced against her wishes to break her engagement.<eos> I know you told your husband.<eos> I trusted you with my feelings and all the while, you were just feeding information to Venice.<eos> Admit it. You told Cosimo about the engagement.<eos> I've been a fool.<eos> What do you think put your cousin up to such a ploy?<eos> I'm well aware who it was.<eos> The Albizzi?<eos> Not this time.
Come on. You're not the prim little Florentine you pretend to be.<eos> - You're in Venice now.<eos> - Stop it, stop it!<eos> Don't tell me your faithful to that bore of a husband?<eos> Piero is the best man you'll ever meet.<eos> He's a fool. Pining away for Florence.<eos> You do realize my father has no intention of ever letting you back there.<eos> Don't be so naïve.<eos> We will return to Florence.<eos> With or without your help.
What of your duty as my husband?<eos> Order!<eos> Order!<eos> Silence! I said order!<eos> The hour is here.<eos> We must weigh Rinaldo Albizzi with the scales of justice and decide his punishment.<eos> Signor Guadagni.<eos> May I address the chamber?<eos> I have had the honor of spending the last few days with the first true holy man I have ever met.<eos> Pope Eugenio.
You accuse me with evidence far less conclusive.<eos> I was the one who demanded Tancredi surrender this. - Remember?<eos> - So you said.<eos> After you murdered the surgeon who conducted our father's autopsy.<eos> What possible motive could I have?<eos> You didn't need a motive.<eos> All you needed was to be paid.<eos> Who was it, Albizzi?<eos> You know I have been a loyal friend - and servant to you, Cosimo.<eos> - Loyal?
Oh, you think you're friends?<eos> Lorenzo.<eos> You must be Bonnie Bennett.<eos> I'm Alex St. John.<eos> Welcome to the armory.<eos> I'm sorry for Enzo's behavior yesterday.<eos> He wasn't following proper protocol.<eos> I asked him to call you back here.<eos> Might've gotten off on the wrong foot.<eos> The wrong foot?
Because it's that difficult to see him at work every day?<eos> Because...<eos> Because I feel really guilty about calling it off.<eos> But it needed to be called off.<eos> So... there's plenty of other places I can work, Erin.<eos> Yeah, no, I hear you.<eos> But you know that when Platt signs off on that paperwork and takes it to the commander, she's gonna want to know why.<eos> You know how hard it is already to be a female cop.<eos> And this will follow you around.<eos> You. Not him.
Miss Buckley...<eos> Oh, don't give me that bullshit!<eos> If it wasn't you, who the hell was it?<eos> Leaking that to the press has compromised the entire investigation.<eos> Get out!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I just saw the news.<eos> I know what it looks like.<eos> It was always my intention to call the press and control the narrative.<eos> What narrative?
Sir, the KALOF seems to indicate we're looking for a possible accomplice.<eos> It just... doesn't feel right.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah. Well, she left her handbag at the scene.<eos> What kind of crim does that?<eos> It's got everything in it - phone, keys.<eos> Well, what did her colleagues think of her?<eos> Her boyfriend, what did he say?<eos> Well, I haven't spoken to anyone yet.<eos> Anyone?
Dig in, before it goes cold.<eos> Still like playing games, don't you, Bev?<eos> Oh, she speaks.<eos> No doubt with the same forked tongue that sweet-talked my boy.<eos> What do you want?<eos> What I want, Lil, I can't ever have.<eos> You saw to that.<eos> You look a little lost, Chelsea Brigitte. Huh?<eos> Don't you know who it is you've taken up with?<eos> A cold-blooded murderess.

You know what Jackson was like.<eos> Shut your filthy lying mouth. Get on over there!<eos> I'm gonna burn this whole shed down, bury all the bad rubbish.<eos> There'll be no sign you were ever here.<eos> Yeah, 'cause that's what you're good at, Bev, isn't it? Burying the truth.<eos> I never liked you.<eos> I don't know what Jackson ever saw in you.<eos> So... this is for my son.<eos> No, what about your grandson?<eos> Grandson?
Just go!<eos> run!<eos> Shoot the bitch!<eos> No!<eos> Shoot the both of them.<eos> I don't blame you, Luke.<eos> Jackson was your big brother.<eos> Everybody loved him.<eos> No-one knew what he was really like.<eos> Only me. And you.
I did not kill that boy.<eos> We had nothing to do with it.<eos> We need to know about these swords.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause someone buried Brian underground and out off his head.<eos> What?<eos> They cut off his head?<eos> It can't be.<eos> What can't be what?<eos> Inugami.
She lived alone.<eos> This gave her a place to go, to...<eos> to feel useful. But you weren't surprised then?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> No, I wasn't surprised. This was her place.<eos> You know, she and my dad started the shop.<eos> No autopsy was performed?<eos> No.<eos> And no follow-up investigation?<eos> An investigation for what?
We'll just do the usual... flip him, have him make his drop.<eos> We pick up some idiot from the Soviet embassy with diplomatic immunity, and PNG them.<eos> And nothing changes.<eos> Welcome to the division, sir.<eos> Maybe we could shoot him.<eos> Cocoa.<eos> You sleep at all?<eos> Not really.<eos> It's... dangerous, what you and Dad do.<eos> Sometimes. Yeah.
Hey, I'm gonna head out for a couple hours.<eos> Have you seen the antenna switchbox?<eos> I don't know what that is.<eos> It's a small box that we plug TV cables into.<eos> Try the garage?<eos> You're totally making Henry's life right now.<eos> Henry's cool.<eos> Your dad's been really great with him, too.<eos> Yeah, he's good with young kids.<eos> But not teenagers?
We have someone there.<eos> At that place, or... or one of those places.<eos> That's it.<eos> I just saw Burov.<eos> He gave me enough pieces to put something together... probably an agent in place, working on biological weapons.<eos> Now I don't have much yet, but...<eos> I think it's big.<eos> - Anybody else know about this?<eos> - No.<eos> Aderholt.
Oh, my God. I-I'm not dating him.<eos> Well, you want to date him?<eos> What? No. I...<eos> I mean, I don't know.<eos> I... I like him, but...<eos> Henry's really close to Mr. Beeman, and we have no idea what he's saying to him about us.<eos> You don't have to worry about that.<eos> Why not?<eos> You have to be careful with Matthew, Paige.<eos> With... everyone.
Have I told you that lately?<eos> - Oh. - We love you too, honeybee.<eos> But, we've been keeping a secret.<eos> And I think the stress of not living our truth took a toll on your father's heart.<eos> We were gonna wait until you graduated and moved out to tell you, but we've decided we need to live for the now.<eos> I completely agree.<eos> What is it?<eos> Both: We're poly.<eos> Poly...<eos> Who?
We were gonna wait until you graduated and moved out to tell you, but we've decided we need to live for the now.<eos> I completely agree.<eos> What is it?<eos> Both: We're poly.<eos> Poly...<eos> Who?<eos> Oh, polyamorous, sweetheart.<eos> I means we want to date other people.<eos> Both: Together.<eos> Well, currently one person in particular.
Roger that.<eos> That's it, Protector.<eos> Follow me.<eos> What are you up to?<eos> Hera, where's that opening?<eos> Prepare to jump.<eos> Coordinates set.<eos> Thanks, Phoenix Leader.<eos> Get going, Sabine.<eos> Not without you.
Wait, you know about the Inquisitor?<eos> He is my enemy.<eos> All Inquisitors and their masters are my enemies.<eos> Were you a Jedi?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, no.<eos> But I was once a Force-wielder, long ago.<eos> Long, long ago.<eos> Then you're a Sith?<eos> The Sith...
It takes a Master and an apprentice!<eos> Wait, what happened, why are you wearing that?<eos> I'll explain later!<eos> Chopper, get the Phantom ready.<eos> Ezra, help me to the holocron!<eos> Kanan, your eyes...<eos> Let's worry about that later.<eos> We've got to get that holocron out of here.<eos> Where's Ahsoka?<eos> With Vader.
He's going down corridor G6.<eos> We found the rebel droid.<eos> We're tracking him.<eos> Split up and cut him off. You two, with me.<eos> We've got him now.<eos> Hurry. Hurry!<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait! Stop them!<eos> You trapped them. I admit, that was a good plan.<eos> You, captain?
What took you so long?<eos> This rogue astromech has taken me prisoner.<eos> You outdated shell of circuits. You are completely useless!<eos> No, you are the one who is useless.<eos> What did you say, droid? Not this time, you little...<eos> Where are those coordinates?<eos> Uh, sorry, Chopper is, um, unavailable at the moment.<eos> Who is this?<eos> I am Chopper's friend.<eos> Friend?
Yes, afraid.<eos> Hmm, surprised are you?<eos> A challenge lifelong it is, not to bend fear into anger.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Found you the enemy has.<eos> Even now, the servants of the dark side come for your apprentice.<eos> You cannot fight forever.<eos> You're right.<eos> I can't protect Ezra forever.<eos> Not even from himself.
She meant Emily.<eos> No, I-I really didn't.<eos> You're seriously breaking up with me?<eos> Yeah. And you thought right before Valentine's Day was a good time to do it?<eos> You're right-- let's talk again in a few days.<eos> Hey, Claire. Hi. It's-it's Rajesh.<eos> I was-I was wondering if you're free for Valentine's Day?<eos> Sorry, I just got back with my boyfriend.<eos> But I just broke up with my girlfriend.<eos> Right before Valentine's Day?
She's saying that Sally initiated the kiss.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Monte's career is at stake.<eos> This lie could ruin her life.<eos> Privatization is incredibly effective.<eos> We can get so much more done.<eos> Ms. Keene must prove she can find gainful employment.<eos> - I got you a job. - What?<eos> Where?<eos> With Justina.
- No, it's not.<eos> - You are not that special, okay?<eos> Which is why you better make something out of yourself 'cause this gravy train ends when you graduate college.<eos> If you get into college.<eos> I'm gonna make money.<eos> Okay? I negotiated, half the door.<eos> We'll get insurance or whatever.<eos> You want me to make something of myself, well... well how about this, Dad?<eos> How about this opportunity to be like... an entrepreneur?<eos> An entrepreneur?
- Clear!<eos> - Eagle, it's empty.<eos> Guy pulled up stakes.<eos> Nothing but an air mattress.<eos> Copy, Apollo.<eos> So much for leads.<eos> So it was a suicide mission all along.<eos> Mr. President, Saudi GID just gave us everything they have on the terrorist organization Hizb Al-Shahid.<eos> Including a cell phone intercept, with a recording of Disah's voice.<eos> Alleged voice.
But if it is him, we have a target.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> NSA says the signal originated here, at a compound near Sirte.<eos> I took the liberty to deploy drones, just in case we get confirmation.<eos> And I'll reach out to our NATO allies, see if they have anything.<eos> Ephraim, I'm ending the National Response protocols, including the order to shelter in place.<eos> Yes, Mr. President.<eos> - Sir, if that's the case...<eos> - Go. Thank you.<eos> Godspeed.
I tried to explain that to Janice year and years and years ago.<eos> You used your Powers for good.<eos> You wanted to help people.<eos> I don't know about all that.<eos> Matter of fact, I don't know too much about anything nowadays.<eos> Mister SuperShock? I...<eos> I have to go.<eos> I just remembered who I saw you with.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Walker.

New Unity.<eos> "New Unity."<eos> Can't you come up with something a little bit more original?<eos> We didn't mean any disrespect by it, Sir.<eos> We just wanted to honor what the original Unity stood for.<eos> What you stood for.<eos> Well, you know, I'll say one thing.<eos> You got a lot of moxie.<eos> I killed Hitler.<eos> With these two hands.
- We have a few minutes. - Dr. Munsch. What about the Chanels?<eos> Do you have any comment on what became of them?<eos> The Chanels.<eos> For two whole years, I barely thought of them.<eos> But then a Netflix documentary series turned them into a national obsession.<eos> Please state your name for the record.<eos> I am Special Agent Denise Hemphill.<eos> And I take it you're currently an agent with the FBI.<eos> Correction.<eos> Special agent.
Gobbledygook, if you ask me.<eos> Did he have any friends?<eos> Did anyone ever come to the house?<eos> Friends?<eos> Leslie didn't have no friends, except that chubby boy.<eos> You mind if you get me... grab me a glass of water?<eos> Should be some in the boxes.<eos> Oh, yeah, of course.<eos> That's right, you told the cops someone did come, but you didn't see him, right?<eos> Nope, not with these cataracts.
It was the only way to show you that fighting me is a waste of time.<eos> No. No, we'll go again.<eos> I can beat you.<eos> I can beat you.<eos> When will you finally realize that I'm here for a reason?<eos> This is avoidance!<eos> Our fight for that future that you want isn't with me at chess!<eos> It's what you do out there with them.<eos> I want to be here, Elliot.<eos> With you.
Somebody knows what really happened to my uncle.<eos> Where have you been, Wynonna?<eos> - As far from here as I could get.<eos> - Lucky you.<eos> If I could leave Purgatory, I'd never come back.<eos> Why would Wyatt Earp choose to settle in this shithole?<eos> My money's on the deep genepool.<eos> Well, maybe your great-great-grandpappy got a few lucky shots in at the OK Corral and fled before they found out he was a fraud.<eos> Didn't he marry a whore?<eos> - An actress. - Oh, oh, shit!
Seriously, Elliot, it's been forever since that poor cop passed.<eos> It's been 12 seconds.<eos> It's time to move past it.<eos> Future is bright, endless like that horizon out there.<eos> Whatever you're doing with me, I don't care.<eos> Just take me back.<eos> It's not that simple, kiddo.<eos> Someone help me!<eos> I'm a businessman!<eos> A very important businessman.
_<eos> Still not sure I quite understand why you were following my sister.<eos> Well, why are you following your sister?<eos> 'Cause Fillory stopped taking you?<eos> Martin, I know you probably think it's your fault, but it's not.<eos> You want to be here because you don't feel safe at home.<eos> And we want to help.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Christopher Plover is a very powerful Magician now.<eos> Maybe the most.
I'm doing this.<eos> - Eliot--<eos> - Margo.<eos> I am miserable.<eos> My life, it doesn't work.<eos> Nothing's ever fixed that.<eos> Drugs, sex, food, booze.<eos> Not even magic.<eos> But maybe it all led to this, to now, for a reason that's actually finally going to make my life not just about me, and my thoughts, and my feelings.<eos> - Something--
- Eliot--<eos> - Margo.<eos> I am miserable.<eos> My life, it doesn't work.<eos> Nothing's ever fixed that.<eos> Drugs, sex, food, booze.<eos> Not even magic.<eos> But maybe it all led to this, to now, for a reason that's actually finally going to make my life not just about me, and my thoughts, and my feelings.<eos> - Something--<eos> - Bigger.
[Whispering] Fuck!<eos> Okay.<eos> Keith, what the fuck did you do?<eos> I'm sorry! Ow!<eos> [Crying] I'm fuckin' sorry.<eos> Fuck.<eos> How did his mom die?<eos> His dad.<eos> And what did he kill her with?<eos> A hammer.
Okay.<eos> Keith, what the fuck did you do?<eos> I'm sorry! Ow!<eos> [Crying] I'm fuckin' sorry.<eos> Fuck.<eos> How did his mom die?<eos> His dad.<eos> And what did he kill her with?<eos> A hammer.<eos> Exactly... a fucking hammer.
You have a roof over your head?<eos> - Yeah. - Hmm.<eos> He ever hit your mother?<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> He was tough on you.<eos> Yeah. Fuck yeah.<eos> 'Cause you needed it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Absolutely.
What made you want this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something about him sitting on a shelf with a bunch of unknown crackheads didn't feel right.<eos> You know, he was my friend.<eos> What are you gonna do with him?<eos> Maybe I'll just throw him in the ocean, you know?<eos> That seems... ceremonial.<eos> It's definitely deep.<eos> What are we gonna do about this?<eos> About what?
Let me have one of those.<eos> I'm here to see Sonia Kovitzky.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> My daughter plays guitar.<eos> I remember the first time I saw a Styka.<eos> It was a coup de foudre.<eos> The physicality of the paint, the blending of the past with the present.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I understand you have a relationship with an LAPD detective, Sheila Muncie.<eos> Not a good one.
Yes.<eos> It was stupid of me, but yes.<eos> Well, looks like you can afford the fines.<eos> Or I could pay you.<eos> Speak to her on my behalf.<eos> I mean, obviously, I'll make it worth her while too.<eos> You asking me to bribe a cop?<eos> I'm asking you to solve a problem.<eos> That is what you do, isn't it, Mr. Donovan?<eos> Not problems like that.
Of course we do, Larry.<eos> Thank you, Chip.<eos> I would never do anything to hurt the casino's name.<eos> I like that bolo tie.<eos> Get it local?<eos> Where are you from originally, Chip?<eos> I detect an accent.<eos> Back east.<eos> What'd you do back there?<eos> Well... uh, odds and ends.
You never fucking learn, do you, Mick?<eos> This is real.<eos> Back in Primm, inside a casino, there's a gorgeous green horseshoe filled with four million in cash.<eos> No one's even watching it.<eos> Your bus is leaving.<eos> Thank you for your cooperation. You ever think about your sister?<eos> Ever see her face?<eos> Like in a dream?<eos> I don't. She was such a beautiful little girl, that one.<eos> An angel.
Always has been.<eos> There's that cocksucker.<eos> You the mechanic? Yep.<eos> My van broke down a few miles from here.<eos> - Can you give me a tow?<eos> - Heading to Vegas?<eos> Isn't everybody?<eos> $200 sound good?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Cash.
Oh, I need you to accompany me to the event.<eos> I know it's not our usual arrangement but it is a two million dollar painting, and Vlad doesn't exactly fit in at an event like that.<eos> I'll send a car for you at six.<eos> You went in alone and did all this with no accomplices.<eos> I was alone, yes, sir.<eos> As you approached the banquet hall, you shot the guard outside?<eos> Yeah, with my 45.<eos> I see.<eos> Then you went inside through this door here, the front door.<eos> - Yeah. - With the 45.
Just like that. Ding ding ding ding.<eos> The fourth man's bullet wound is a rear-entry.<eos> It came from over here.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> - Ah. His back was to me when I shot him, and then afterwards, he turned as he fell, you know?<eos> Oh, he turned after you shot him and then he fell.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Guy comes out of prison and he goes to meet his friend and this friend says, "So, uh, how was it?"<eos> He says, "The first day they stuck me on the third tier in a cell with Ralphie.<eos> Big black guy.
She sounds lovely.<eos> She can sing, too...<eos> Like a nightingale.<eos> How you get a job in the kitchen?<eos> You want a job in the kitchen?<eos> Put your name on the clipboard back there.<eos> Donovan.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> So we need another number. I'm not getting through to your middle son.<eos> - Ray?
To the fucking DA's office, you cocksucker... for Fiona Miller's murder.<eos> Remember that?<eos> Go fuck yourself.<eos> Tommy Wheeler's not worth that much.<eos> Hey, Nick... just fucking tell us where her body is, huh?<eos> What, you're gonna fucking shoot me?<eos> That's the idea, yeah.<eos> Okay, pal, I am the co-chair of the motherfucking Motion Picture Department at ACA.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Co-chair, huh?
Yes.<eos> I'll take care of this.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, um, this a bad time?<eos> What the fuck do you think?<eos> Look, Hector wanted me to give this to you.<eos> Oh, what, am I his whore now?<eos> I don't know, he just wants you to go away.<eos> Go away?<eos> With this?
There he is.<eos> They do anything to Avi, I'm gonna fucking kill them.<eos> Wait. Shouldn't I go with her?<eos> Just do what I told you to do.<eos> Wait for her signal.<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> These pieces stay.<eos> They don't matter.<eos> Only take the ones that I selected.<eos> Careful with the Strasser, okay?
And you'll return my art?<eos> Tonight with the slips. I need to meet Mr. Campos.<eos> I want to see Avi first.<eos> Give me my art, and you'll get your man.<eos> Hey, Boston, what's up?<eos> - I need a favor.<eos> - Sure, what is it?<eos> 2 million on Whittaker knocking out Campos in the sixth.<eos> Whittaker?<eos> Under seven?
You know what, Mom, I'm-I'm not as hungry as I thought.<eos> In fact, my stomach just turned.<eos> Really?<eos> You don't want anything?<eos> Be more than happy to run a hot bath for you.<eos> No, no, uh, like I said, I just came in here to check on you and...<eos> I should really run... very, very far away.<eos> That girl will never appreciate how much I do for her.<eos> Mol, you out here?<eos> Under the car.
It's my birthday today.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> - I thought...<eos> - No, no... Don't believe what you read online.<eos> Today is my actual birthday.<eos> I never share the real one with anyone.<eos> Some things I like to keep to myself.<eos> Happy birthday then.<eos> Would you like to celebrate with me?<eos> Tonight?
Through a juniper field into a valley of pines.<eos> Come on.<eos> No.<eos> What is it?<eos> The Wicked Witch. Let's go.<eos> Would you prefer I send you chocolates next time?<eos> If you're looking for a thank you, maybe you should write your name on the card next time.<eos> I'm afraid I didn't come to woo you, Zelena.<eos> I came to warn you.<eos> About what?
But just before she did, she gave me Toto.<eos> He's all you have left of her.<eos> He's the only one who understands me.<eos> Don't worry. We're gonna get him back.<eos> You know, I understand what it's like to feel like you don't belong anywhere.<eos> Really, Wolfie?<eos> Your family tried to have you committed?<eos> No, my entire village ran me out of town.<eos> Really?<eos> With torches and pitchforks.
Hades has spent far too long down here to be changed by something as simple as love.<eos> How do we stop Hades from hurting Zelena?<eos> We only have one option.<eos> What's that?<eos> We have to make her forget Hades ever existed.<eos> Just hold on, dear.<eos> Your mother will be back soon.<eos> She already is, and I have exactly what we need.<eos> Who is she?<eos> The cure.
My Zelena...<eos> I meant what I said earlier.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Sorry I never gave you the family you deserved or the love.<eos> I should have been there for you, instead of wasting my life destroying people.<eos> Maybe now you won't have to make the same mistakes I did.<eos> What if it's too late for me?<eos> If being here's taught me anything, it's that it's never too late, especially for family.<eos> You never stop being connected, right up to the end.<eos> And sometimes... even after.
Hey.<eos> Adrian, it's me.<eos> Where the hell are you?<eos> Call me.<eos> Where were you between eleven and one today?<eos> What, that's it? Straight to the point?<eos> You're not gonna offer me anything to drink?<eos> - Would you like a drink, Peter?<eos> - Tea, please.<eos> With milk.
Are you looking for Matthew?<eos> No.<eos> What do you... think of me?<eos> You're er... you're... good for Matthew.<eos> Why?<eos> It's just that we both care about him.<eos> And I just thought it would be good if we were... friends.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I... I thought we were.<eos> Better friends.
So why... why destroy it?<eos> It's just that you talk about him all the time.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> He's my best friend.<eos> And he's going through difficult times.<eos> So are we.<eos> I moved away from everything.<eos> From my daughter... from... my job, everything, to be here with you.<eos> Not to be here with you and...<eos> Henry.
- So he beat the crap out of Danny?<eos> - And that's fine with you?<eos> - I didn't say it was fine.<eos> So, Papa Ray beat him, Uncle Kevin attacked him, and now Mama Ray hits me for telling the truth?<eos> What is it with you people?<eos> This family is so fucked up.<eos> I'd say good morning, but I think I'm probably wrong.<eos> No, it's... I just...<eos> I just got knocked around a little bit, that's all.<eos> By what, an 18-wheeler?
Because I wanted to get away.<eos> I wanted to leave and I wanted to never come back, but I couldn't because of my fucking family.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I fucking hate them.<eos> I'm sorry, Meg.<eos> I know what Aguirre is telling you to do, and I know why.<eos> - I'm just doing my job.<eos> - I know.<eos> But you need to decide who you're loyal to.<eos> Him... or us?
I forgot to ask your name.<eos> Robert Townsend at your service.<eos> Major John André at yours.<eos> So this is what it's like to be a spy skulking around at night.<eos> Actually, it's more about fooling the gullible so one can do one's skulking in the light of day.<eos> Don't push too hard, Woodhull.<eos> Your wife isn't here to protect you.<eos> Nor are your guards here to stop me from dropping another king's man by the side of the road.<eos> You murdered Eastin in cold blood?<eos> Lukewarm.
I'm standing in front of the boutique Miami hotel run by the rakish Rafael Solano and his glamorous ex-wife Petra because this very hotel is now believed to be associated with two major players in the Miami drug trade.<eos> Okay, I get the point.<eos> We're at 40% capacity.<eos> Events are getting cancelled.<eos> Then I'll float us again this month.<eos> It's a bigger problem than that, and you know it.<eos> Look, Jane and Mateo are here, I got to call you back.<eos> What time did he get up - from his nap?<eos> - Uh, 1:30.<eos> 1:30.
I can't believe I just jeopardized my writing career over a hot guy I had some sex dreams about.<eos> I ju-I just... oh, I feel so...<eos> I don't know...<eos> Horny.<eos> I was going to say at a crossroads.<eos> But, yeah, maybe that, too.<eos> I don't know, Mom, this whole no-sex-till-marriage thing is...<eos> I mean...<eos> I could see the finish line.<eos> First with Michael.
You nailed the R, but the "S" s are no good.<eos> You got to try harder next time.<eos> So, um, where are we with that roommate, Jordan Scott?<eos> Right now Jay's running Evan and Jordan through all our databases, but that's it.<eos> Blood, bodies, handcuffs...<eos> What the hell went on over there?<eos> Boss, we find the link between Jordan, Evan, and Dr. Walton, we got our answer.<eos> You get on that.<eos> And, uh, look, I'm sorry again...<eos> Garlic and mozzarelle... for next time.
I'll bet he's camping out there.<eos> All right.<eos> Problem is with you, not the detonator.<eos> I told you, you got to get a J-hook igniter, you want that detcord to blow.<eos> Get down!<eos> Jordan knew we were coming.<eos> The cell phone ping was a plant.<eos> We'd be buried under that rubble if it wasn't for you.<eos> I guess I owe you one.<eos> One?
Joe?<eos> Do you want to have a little play?<eos> Joe? Listen,<eos> I want you to play with Dr Waite for five minutes and then you can have your music back. OK? Come on, good lad.<eos> There we go. Do you want to help me with this, Joe?<eos> He doesn't really like jigsaws. He just finds them too easy.<eos> Joe, look.<eos> Hey, look who this is. Here, look. It's Tigger, isn't it?<eos> Hey, shall we show Dr Waite where Tigger goes?<eos> Just above Winnie the Pooh. Just there. Hey?
He has problems processing emotions. He has problems with his auditory processing. Yeah, you keep saying that.<eos> I don't know what it means. I'm sorry.<eos> It means there's nothing wrong with his hearing but he has trouble making sense of what he hears and prioritising them.<eos> Like I'm prioritising this conversation over the sound of my e-mail alerts. That's not him.<eos> That...<eos> Sorry, but he talks, he sings.<eos> He has a wide vocabulary and he uses that to keep everyone at a social distance.<eos> His singing is another way to keep everyone out.<eos> To protect him from what he finds difficult.<eos> Communication, emotions.
Or beer?<eos> You look like you might be a craft beer sort of a girl.<eos> - Is that a joke? - No.<eos> I was genuinely, we've got some, some...<eos> No, it's me that uses jokes to mask my feelings, remember?<eos> Nothing for me, thank you. I need to go now.<eos> Oh, you're not going to eat with us?<eos> No, but thank you. I've booked dinner at the Red Lion. - I'm seeing an old friend.<eos> - Oh, really.<eos> Who?
They're from my house.<eos> Olan doesn't even know that it got bombed.<eos> Hey, you're a Nova cadet?<eos> I joined Novas when I was about your age.<eos> Best summers of my life.<eos> Dad says Novas are suck-ups.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Sounds like our dads would get along.<eos> They're both giant assho...<eos> Jerks.
John, the data miners have located the Arkyn transmission.<eos> It overloaded the memory core and was re-routed to Classroom A.<eos> That's where the kids were. And Chambers...<eos> She's here.<eos> What do I do? Run, you idiot!<eos> Why didn't Chambers trip the sensors, Johnny?<eos> I don't know! Don't shoot.<eos> I need her alive.<eos> What the hells is she?<eos> Digital ghosting.
Thou art a villain.<eos> - It's going great, right? - (chuckles)<eos> You know, maybe we should just rewrite the show.<eos> What if Juliet just chooses Paris instead?<eos> Yeah, I don't... I don't think Brandon would like that very much... or Shakespeare.<eos> Well, I guess it's good they died then.<eos> I mean. Romeo and Juliet were never gonna make it as a couple.<eos> I don't even think they ever consummated their relationship.<eos> Everybody knows sex is where the real bonding happens.<eos> Like with me and Mat.
Does my niece do anything like that?<eos> Well, her behaviour is certainly erratic, sir, yes. Yes.<eos> No-one wants to believe that the head that wears the crown is anything less than sane, but if needs must, we must not shirk our duty.<eos> No, indeed.<eos> I'm sure the Duchess is concerned for her daughter's welfare.<eos> And I'm worried too... .. for the country.<eos> It may be that... we can come to some sort of... arrangement together.<eos> A regency on the grounds of insanity?<eos> You put it bluntly but...<eos> With the Duchess as Regent?
We are fortunate, Sir, that your father the Emperor can spare you for the opening of a monument to the Duke of Kent.<eos> My father and I are great admirers of British institutions, your Queen in particular.<eos> I never knew my father, but I know he would have been delighted to have his charitable endeavours commemorated by the most generous people of this town.<eos> So it gives me great pleasure to dedicate this to his memory.<eos> Thank you so much, but I believe I can manage.<eos> Freedom for the Newport Chartists!<eos> Freedom for the Chartists!<eos> Lord Alfred, I believe the Queen is leaving.<eos> Will you escort her and the Duchess?<eos> With pleasure.
Lord Melbourne, did you know that my father had a mistress?<eos> Madame St Laurent?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I believe they were quite devoted to each other.<eos> Really?<eos> The Lord Chamberlain.<eos> May I congratulate you, Your Majesty.<eos> I want a small affair with a wedding breakfast afterwards here at the palace.<eos> Royal weddings usually take place in the evening, Ma'am.<eos> In the evening?
Why did you never tell me?<eos> Perhaps it was easier to believe... ..that she did not love us...<eos> ..and we had each other.<eos> And now you have Victoria... ..and she will never leave you.<eos> Do you know how much I envy you?<eos> And how I will miss you?<eos> When you two have finished embracing like a couple of foolish Maedchens, the carriage is outside.<eos> You may be about to marry the richest woman in the world, Albert, but I can't afford to keep my horses waiting.<eos> Uncle Leopold.<eos> Victoria.
Marry and start a family your subjects can be proud of.<eos> When you give your heart, it will be without hesitation, but you cannot give it to me.<eos> I do not see the urgency for her to marry.<eos> 'Tis more important, I think, that she chooses wisely.<eos> You should know that I've sent for my nephew Albert.<eos> Without the Queen's permission?<eos> I don't want a stupid boy like Albert, Mama, or anyone else.<eos> Hallelujah<eos> Victoria.
Albert.<eos> Dash!<eos> Now, stop that.<eos> You're being rude.<eos> You mustn't bark at cousin Albert, even if he does look quite different to the last time we saw him.<eos> I'm sorry if your dog does not recognise me.<eos> I, on the other hand, had no difficulty in recognising you, although now I believe you're playing the piano with... fewer mistakes.<eos> How magnificent you look, Cousin Victoria.<eos> Monarchy clearly agrees with you.<eos> Ernest.
They're as beautiful as ever.<eos> The glasshouses of Brocket Hall are at your service, Ma'am.<eos> Perhaps I could have the pleasure of... .. of seeing you wear them.<eos> May I have the pleasure?<eos> You dance beautifully.<eos> I think, before that, I was afraid.<eos> Afraid?<eos> Of appearing ridiculous.<eos> It's hard sometimes to find the rhythm.<eos> Not with you.
Good morning, Albert.<eos> I do hope you find the park here more to your taste.<eos> There is a word we have in German:<eos> Waldeinsamkeit.<eos> A feeling of being at one with the forest.<eos> I have it here.<eos> Waldeinsamkeit?<eos> Oh, I had completely forgotten I'd arranged to meet Uncle Leopold.<eos> Lord Alfred, would you be kind enough to show me back to the house?<eos> With pleasure.
You must convince Albert to reconsider.<eos> If the Tories fail to condone your Regency... ..I will abdicate.<eos> No, you will not. I will.<eos> You can't abdicate.<eos> You're not the monarch.<eos> You can't abdicate. Then I will merely leave.<eos> Then I will merely kill myself.<eos> Then I will remarry. Ridiculous!<eos> Who will you marry?<eos> Wellington?

Mr Francatelli's bombe surprise.<eos> You invented it. No, you invented it.<eos> We invented it.<eos> It won't wash, Peel.<eos> What won't, Sir Piers?<eos> Licking up to the Queen's husband and giving him a ride on your ruddy infernal machine.<eos> It is not an adult way to solicit power.<eos> The Prince has no power to be solicited.<eos> Oh, you're wrong.<eos> With respect.
So I got some advice and I confided in my hairdresser about the affair.<eos> Wait.<eos> Women actually do that?<eos> And she told me that there was a way to get him back.<eos> I -<eos> - I knew she, uh, dabbled in stuff.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> What kind of stuff are you talking about here?<eos> She calls herself a...<eos> White witch.
Let's just go.<eos> I'd say that went pretty well.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> You think it's a-a good idea to give yourself a fatal curse?<eos> Hold that.<eos> Well, target's off her back, ain't it?<eos> I'm just saying you don't have to do this -- be the guinea pig.<eos> - What?

- How long do you think we have?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's not like this thing is exactly following a pattern.<eos> I don't even know what I'm looking for here.<eos> But we cut out of there pretty quick...<eos> What was that?<eos> ...So maybe that bought us some time.<eos> Um, we think it was something called a shapeshifter, but, uh, it can't be because I pumped the thing full of silver and it didn't even flinch.<eos> What kind of FBI agents are you?<eos> The fake kind.

I understand, Dean.<eos> Is that right?<eos> The longing in your heart --<eos> I feel it, too.<eos> ♪<eos> Well, that's touching...<eos> Considering that you don't have a heart Qareen.<eos> I'm guessing you're not really FBI.<eos> You're what?<eos> A hunter?
Oh! Hold it right there.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> - Cold-blooded murderess.<eos> - Bad wife.<eos> Oh, she'll tell you tales about Jackson, I'm sure.<eos> That he had a short fuse.<eos> She stabbed my son in the throat over his chicken dinner.<eos> So... this is for my son.<eos> But what about your grandson?<eos> Grandson? No!
Meet me back here in 10 minutes, alright?<eos> 10 minutes?<eos> Come over here, grab a T-shirt.<eos> Get a Hawaiian shirt.<eos> Hey, darlin'!<eos> Wanna buy a T-shirt?<eos> No, thanks, darling.<eos> Come on! I've got your size.<eos> Sexy lady?<eos> Red one?

You've been led along by Lola Buckley and now you're in way over your head and you... you're not cut out for this.<eos> Hey? Am I right?<eos> I'm not saying anything else until I speak to a lawyer.<eos> Hey, mate. Did you see my friend?<eos> Traded up. Did you see her?<eos> Sure did.<eos> Want to buy a T-shirt?<eos> Do I have a choice?<eos> Here.<eos> What, just one?
What, just one?<eos> Well?<eos> Oh, she took off.<eos> She took off?<eos> When?<eos> About an hour ago.<eos> Did you give her my message?<eos> I didn't get a chance to.<eos> She took off in a car with some young fellow.<eos> What young fellow?
Why don't I just ask?<eos> No.<eos> I'll meet you back at the car. No.<eos> Chelsea, no!<eos> Ow... Chelsea!<eos> Um, excuse me?<eos> I'm looking for Joshua Levine.<eos> Are you related?<eos> I'm his girlfriend.<eos> Well, his fiancee.
Probably.<eos> I doubt there'll be any, uh, cranberry to go with it, though.<eos> Here y'are.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Hey, we can't keep driving, Lola.<eos> It's too risky.<eos> Well, we can't fly.<eos> What about seaplanes?
Contrary to what you three led me to believe, those women's prisons are nothing like the late-night Skinemax movies, so have fun.<eos> All right, Ms. Ruiz, tell me what you know.<eos> Please. I didn't snitch back in the day.<eos> Why would I start now?<eos> Because nine years ago, this was just a burglary, and now it's a murder.<eos> Murder?<eos> Who died?<eos> An armored truck driver.<eos> Look, Sonia, you help me out, I'll help you out.<eos> With what?
No, no, no! It's fake! It's fake!<eos> Daryl, override.<eos> All copy? This is Mia.<eos> Everett here.<eos> Hoping to get the call sooner.<eos> No way!<eos> Get your stash locations quick and rendezvous on me... Copy that! Copy that!<eos> Copy! I'm on my way.<eos> Hand me the bag.<eos> The other bag.
Some people can't ask for help.<eos> They don't know how. Ah, not me.<eos> I'm good with help. It's one way<eos> Anna and I are different.<eos> One way? Yeah, we're simpatico, cut from the same cloth, kind of in that misunderstood, loner kind of way.<eos> Sorry, loner?<eos> Yeah, I live alone.<eos> You're a member of three different live action role-play groups.<eos> So, I'm down with LARPing. And a Dungeons and Dragons group.<eos> And a Magic:
Where the hell did he go?<eos> Here!<eos> Over here!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm Lieutenant Casey.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Come this way.<eos> - Come to the medics.<eos> - This way.
Come on in.<eos> Hey, Chili.<eos> I don't even know if you're home, but if you are... just know a lot of people care about you.<eos> No bridges are ever burned with us.<eos> We got you... if you want us.<eos> Here you go.<eos> So, uh... how many signatures are we talking about?<eos> Hi.<eos> I need your help.<eos> God.
What's a PP?<eos> - Oh. - Reese should do it.<eos> Yeah!<eos> She's got to learn.<eos> Give it to Reese.<eos> Let's go.<eos> PP.<eos> Pediculosis and phthiriasis.<eos> Lice infestation.<eos> Among other things.
All right, I'm gonna run with the carjack victims.<eos> - See if he grabbed any phones.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> My car broke down and my phone is dead, and I was wondering if there's any chance I could borrow yours to call AAA.<eos> Um, let me guess...<eos> Cardiology?<eos> I'm a surgeon. I'm... I'm usually right.<eos> [laughs] Not this time.
It's been so overwhelming and so much...<eos> You know what helps?<eos> A cocktail.<eos> Listen, I've got a situation.<eos> Do you know any computer nerds that can track someone down on the Internet?<eos> Yeah, I think I can find a few.<eos> Okay!<eos> How exciting is this, Lily?<eos> In no time at all, you're gonna be a bike rider.<eos> - Or a corpse. - Okay...
Ira, I'm a married woman.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Wow. I didn't pick up that energy when I was planking you.<eos> Mm.<eos> Aaah!<eos> Ohh!<eos> Phil! What are you doing home?<eos> I lost my car keys.<eos> Who were you talking to?<eos> - Nobody.
I know people will be disappointed.<eos> No, no, don't feel guilty.<eos> Look, the first step is to say it out loud.<eos> I don't want to be a drummer.<eos> Okay, now say the other thing.<eos> I don't want to be in a band anymore.<eos> I miss home.<eos> I miss my girlfriend. - I'm sorry.<eos> Whoa. What? - I'm sorry.<eos> Your what?
The guy burned down one house.<eos> He's not in jail, so he's got the government's A-okay.<eos> I recently discovered I have some issues with Mom, but I love her.<eos> I don't want her to wake up in a burning house just so you don't have to pay alimony.<eos> I love Mom, too...<eos> usually.<eos> But if this wedding doesn't happen, you know where she's gonna end up in 10 years -- su casa or... my... casa.<eos> Besides, the first wife obviously drove the guy nuts.<eos> How do we know your mother's gonna --<eos> Oh, geez.
I just got an e-mail saying Family Camp was canceled -- not enough sign-ups. - Ehh.<eos> - That's it?<eos> You don't care at all, do you?<eos> You're too busy running around with that girl from last night!<eos> Yeah!<eos> That's right!<eos> I know everything! How could you, Luke?<eos> To be honest, I don't know why I was so upset.<eos> I knew I was supposed to be mad, but I couldn't figure out why, so I just started saying a bunch of stuff.<eos> Under my roof?
A restraining order. That's worse than herpes.<eos> When I find Sam...<eos> I'm gonna kill him.<eos> You can't find Sam.<eos> 'Cause you have a restraining order.<eos> Winston. You have to help me with this.<eos> Sam is the only one who can drop this charge.<eos> But the magic of a restraining order is that you can't talk to him.<eos> And that... that is human drama.<eos> Tasteful, hip...
I need all units!<eos> Send all units!<eos> So this is how I die!<eos> I'm not crazy!<eos> That was great.<eos> Just like I envisioned it.<eos> Connie cut our soda line.<eos> So we take a fish, and we put it in the vents of her restaurant bar.<eos> The whole place is gonna smell like a whale's ass.<eos> Not just any fish either.
Matthew's been dead for over a year.<eos> What, uh, what do you want to talk to my mom for?<eos> Just need to ask her a few questions.<eos> Uh, okay, uh... but now is, um, not a good time.<eos> My-my kids are on their way over.<eos> Later today is fine.<eos> See you then.<eos> All right. Give you a call.<eos> Do you have any idea why the FBI would want to talk to you about Matty?<eos> Matty?
I-I don't know how I could save you this time.<eos> - Even if I wanted to.<eos> - Captain, come on.<eos> You're on a desk until further notice.<eos> _<eos> Welcome to Los Angeles.<eos> Have we arrived late?<eos> I was told we would load the trucks then call for police escort.<eos> You're all Asian.<eos> Chinese, actually!
- The booty is noted.<eos> - Just let me handle this.<eos> Hey!<eos> - Hello. Uh, I'd like to check out some of your, uh, private rooms.<eos> I'm throwing a noodle theme bachelor party...<eos> Carter!<eos> Police, police, move!<eos> Excuse me! Excuse me! Move!<eos> Move! Move!<eos> Kim!
This isn't you, Kim.<eos> This is not who you are. Who am I?<eos> I should have died.<eos> _<eos> No, you are not.<eos> I know my sister.<eos> You are brave, and you are strong.<eos> And you couldn't kill me.<eos> Well, luckily... I can.<eos> Kim!
- Firewall is up.<eos> - Box it in.<eos> - As we speak.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> - What happened?<eos> The rogue signal is putting up a bigger firewall.<eos> The time for secrets is almost over.<eos> Talk to me, Kirsten.<eos> Everything in your life has been a test.<eos> A test?
All right, that's the connection.<eos> Spar's employee record lists his daughter as an emergency contact.<eos> Trying to track her down. Spar has a place on Dauphine.<eos> His daughter could be there.<eos> If Pride and Hamilton are still in the Quarter, it could be where Mike Spar took them.<eos> We're closer.<eos> I'll have SWAT meet me there.<eos> You either lied because you killed her or you're protecting someone.<eos> Oh, y-you're judge and jury now?<eos> Just a cop.
So what did the healer say?<eos> How soon can we get a baby in you?<eos> Oh, well, the truth is, Oleg, the healer said that she wouldn't be able to help me get pregnant.<eos> Oh, Sophie.<eos> Well, the reason that I can't get pregnant is... I'm already pregnant!<eos> Yeah! I'm gonna be a father?<eos> Yes, I'm three months along.<eos> Yeah, no, that's the last time<eos> I'll buy a pregnancy test off a boat. Well, let's bust out the very cheap, non-alcoholic champagne.<eos> Non-alcoholic?
I am actually pioneering a radical new procedure at this hospital.<eos> To increase certain brain functions, and I guess you could say... shut down others.<eos> Certain areas of emotion cause a patient to be irrational.<eos> They can be removed.<eos> One question.<eos> Do you only use the cane as a weapon, or are you hiding a limp under all that bullshit?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Princeton doesn't have a medical school, dickwad.<eos> You're not a doctor, you're a killer.<eos> A revenant.
Officer Haught.<eos> Status?<eos> She's alive.<eos> Barely.<eos> Motorist spotted her on the side of the highway.<eos> - EMS had to resuscitate on site.<eos> - Damn him.<eos> - I'm gonna need access.<eos> - You'll have it.<eos> Two conditions.
He's gonna fix us.<eos> OK, Bethany, we're in serious shit here.<eos> It's OK to feel nervous before a surgery.<eos> This isn't a real hospital.<eos> - Reggie's not a real doctor.<eos> - He cares about me.<eos> You know how long it's been since I could actually say that about a man?<eos> Park your daddy issues, 'cause it's time to haul ass outta here.<eos> If he's not a doctor, he's...<eos> A serial killer.
It was a scared and confused little girl.<eos> - It was an accident.<eos> - I know, I was there.<eos> I know you're not gonna believe this, but I really liked your father.<eos> He wasn't like the other Earp heirs.<eos> He wasn't ambitious like Edwin, or courageous like Josiah, but he had something that they didn't have.<eos> Wits.<eos> When Ward started his little ride, he realized that in order to survive, he was gonna have to make certain alliances.<eos> - With who?<eos> Black Badge?
Wits.<eos> When Ward started his little ride, he realized that in order to survive, he was gonna have to make certain alliances.<eos> - With who?<eos> Black Badge?<eos> - Don't be daft.<eos> He made a pact with the big man himself.<eos> Bobo Del Rey.<eos> No.<eos> My daddy would never make a deal<eos> - with a demon.
So what now?<eos> Wynonna?<eos> You stand by this report?<eos> That your Deputy possibly dispatched the most notorious serial killer in history?<eos> I said possibly.<eos> There's no way to prove it without a body.<eos> How convenient.<eos> Where's my delivery?<eos> Oh yeah. I will be formally withdrawing the report I filed on the alleged target. Henry is nothing but a con artist.<eos> A good one, but...
Come on.<eos> Alright, ladies.<eos> Up the stairs.<eos> Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!<eos> This way!<eos> Now! Come on!<eos> Yiska, stop!<eos> Lou!<eos> What are you?<eos> A devil?
You know, her being here could be dangerous.<eos> Hey, don't worry.<eos> Black Badge doesn't know anything, OK?<eos> Plus I got a buddy down in the forensics lab who did a no-questions-asked... favour.<eos> But you don't believe me.<eos> Only the part about you having a buddy.<eos> If she really is our long-lost sister,<eos> - then...<eos> - Technically, she's the heir.<eos> Or an heir.
Been told I have character.<eos> Carrying a flask of tabasco on your hip is character;<eos> drawing a pistol on a good Samaritan, that's just being a dick.<eos> Do you think you can assist with my vehicle, please? I am stranded.<eos> Try starting her up.<eos> Well see, here's the clinker:<eos> I threw them keys away.<eos> Now, I looked for 'em for a spell, but then I decided tired eyes, they're poor tools, so...<eos> In which direction did you throw 'em?<eos> Just past that marker. Uh-huh.
More like a series of professional arrangements.<eos> He goes whoring.<eos> I ran into him at a strip club in Manhattan once when he was supposed to be hunting elk in Colorado.<eos> He was with this girl, really expensive-looking.<eos> He invited me to sit with him.<eos> We had drinks.<eos> I even walked him back to his hotel.<eos> Do you remember where this was in Manhattan?<eos> It's some fancy place.<eos> Uh, the Undershaw?
If I broke out of prison, the first thing I'd want is sexers and beer.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Be a distraction.<eos> Hey, Gared, this is Pree's place.<eos> But I'll make you a deal.<eos> I'll fight you for it.<eos> You?<eos> Unless you can't take on a Killjoy and want everyone to know about it.<eos> Johnny?<eos> Quick like a bunny.
Yeah, which I'm assuming means...<eos> They messed with them while we were unconscious.<eos> Jelco used us to fish out Tighmon right from the start.<eos> Pree, flush these.<eos> Jelco tracked the shit out of us; we'll shit the track out of him.<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> Because I'm angry.<eos> Now, how do we get out of here?<eos> We need to get over that wall.<eos> Or under it.
Fine.<eos> And... action!<eos> I, uh, just got off the phone with Munson.<eos> He tells me you and Kenny had quite a scene.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Cut!<eos> Cut, cut.<eos> Cindy, do you not get what your intention is?<eos> You just got off the phone with Munson.<eos> Munson!
John, that is completely untrue.<eos> Uh, all I'm doing is trying to come up with a-- a reasonable schedule so you and I can have dinner together a few nights a week.<eos> Like Scott Cullins, whose parents got divorced. Now he has to go Thursdays to his dad's crummy new apartment to eat Chinese food out of the box, because his dad doesn't even have plates.<eos> I will have plates, I can assure you.<eos> You don't even have a real bed.<eos> I'm gonna find an apartment.<eos> I just, uh, I just haven't had the time, you know?<eos> Hey, hey, uh, how-- how are you getting to school?<eos> Let me take you.<eos> In what?
He refuses to see me.<eos> He says his siblings feel the same.<eos> Well, I can't vouch for the baby, but yes, Johnny and Jenny are furious with you.<eos> Well, perhaps they're taking cues from their mother.<eos> Well, I don't know what you've told them.<eos> I know you've poisoned the neighbors against me. - The other parents--<eos> - Are you blaming this on me?<eos> No, I'm not saying-- no.<eos> Another, please.<eos> Two olives.
My father works for the government.<eos> They move him around every few years.<eos> I was born in Singapore, raised in Virginia. Hmm.<eos> And it says that you have an MD in psychiatry.<eos> You didn't pursue an advanced degree?<eos> I was under the impression that a medical degree was advanced.<eos> Well, we're primarily considering applicants with PhDs for this job.<eos> I'm so sorry that Dr. Leveau didn't mention that.<eos> You know, I've always found the more degrees on a psychiatrist's walls, the higher the probability he's either a charlatan or a horse's ass.<eos> Or both.
Nervous?<eos> No, not nervous. I'm- - I'm ready for this.<eos> Uh, I was going to suggest that you take the lead in the exam room.<eos> Walk the Connollys through the basics of sensate.<eos> You may touch, rub, massage, or kiss anywhere on your partner's body, aside from the genitals and breasts.<eos> Did you want to add anything, Dr. Masters?<eos> You might also remove the slippers.<eos> But I-I thought that we agreed that my-- my feet are off-limits.<eos> And through the sensate therapy, we hope to refocus your husband's desire on to more acceptable parts of your body, but if that refocusing leads to his hiding his desire, then that desire becomes something else.<eos> A secret.
- Dale.<eos> - Your long... - Dale. Slender toes.<eos> I mean, that doesn't-- that doesn't feel awful.<eos> Oh, my God, Dale.<eos> Don't.<eos> It's too-- too weird.<eos> Betty said you wanted to see me?<eos> I, uh, I wanted to talk to you about what happened in the lab this afternoon.<eos> With Mr. and Mrs. Connolly?<eos> With you, actually.
Here you are. Well, it would have been impossible not to.<eos> Every time I turn my head, you're on a different magazine cover.<eos> And, I, uh, I did read your book.<eos> Mm. What did you think?<eos> I thought if all the people that bought this book and actually read it, I'm gonna be out of a job.<eos> There I was, out of luck.<eos> He came in about four seconds.<eos> 17-year-old boys not being known for their endurance.<eos> So you didn't achieve orgasm?<eos> Not that first time, no.
To give him a chance.<eos> And you thought that was a good idea because?<eos> Because we're family.<eos> And I'm trying to trust Zelena.<eos> She thinks she can change Hades.<eos> I'm sorry, luv, I missed the part where Zelena changed.<eos> You'd think the ex-pirate with a rum habit would cut my sister some slack.<eos> Well, you'd think that the Evil Queen would be smarter than to send the Wicked Witch<eos> - to romance the most devious man alive.<eos> - Easy, guys.
When Cary suggested that you come back, I wasn't against it, but I was afraid that there might be a few bumps.<eos> Which bumps might those be?<eos> A certain independence and a resistance to oversight.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell me how you would like me to improve.<eos> Lucca isn't your associate.<eos> She is the firm's associate.<eos> I understand.<eos> She caught the Howell case with me, so I thought the associate that caught the case stays with the case.<eos> Sometimes.
Ah.<eos> So he didn't want to tent me, too?<eos> No.<eos> He thinks this will do it.<eos> Great.<eos> Well.<eos> It's a real improvement here.<eos> So, we seem to have a new defense here we're trying, counselor?<eos> Well, not new.<eos> But true.
Really?<eos> !<eos> - When did this happen?<eos> - A citizen journalist.<eos> Mr. Howell is therefore entitled to protect the identity of the person from whom he obtained the Foil and to do as he pleases with the device.<eos> Mr. Howell is not a journalist.<eos> He's a look-at-me with a smartphone.<eos> His tweet about the Foil falls within the definition of journalism.<eos> He shared information in a public forum, information he analyzed...<eos> With five exclamation points?
This so-called debate includes an emoji of a flaming poop.<eos> Well, it's not as though he tweeted a picture of his johnson, Ms. Gades.<eos> There's public interest in the Foil, and his tweets added to the public discourse, uh, flaming poops notwithstanding.<eos> This court therefore considers the defendant... a journalist.<eos> Go free and go crazy, Mr. Howell.<eos> The journalism angle you came up with was a home run.<eos> - Nice job.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Now I need you on something else.<eos> What?
For once in your life, Marion, do the right thing.<eos> You act like you know what this is about.<eos> You got no idea.<eos> - I got a pretty good one.<eos> - Oh, you know?<eos> You know that I got out of the drug game when I had Brianne?<eos> That I was working a double as a cocktail waitress? That I was going to night school?<eos> Studying what, advanced trafficking?<eos> Marion... you're not a student.<eos> Or a waitress.
19 minutes after Gibson was shot.<eos> You have his last known?<eos> The squad and ESU are already on their way.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey, easy, easy!<eos> Come on, let me go.<eos> I didn't even...<eos> So that's our guy? That's him.<eos> They recovered a nine beneath his mattress.<eos> Prints and everything.
Thank you for your help.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> I think so.<eos> Maybe, yeah.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I know much about you.<eos> And you don't... don't know me.<eos> I don't believe in excuses, giving reasons for actions.<eos> The actions themselves are what matters.<eos> Well, sometimes.
I know this is very hard for you, Theo.<eos> But it's also hard for them, you know?<eos> To find the right balance between not enough information and too much.<eos> You know, when you, when you wake up, and you're taken out of the cryogenic pods...<eos> You don't believe this.<eos> You don't believe any of this.<eos> At first, I didn't.<eos> It was very difficult for me to know what to believe.<eos> But you know, over time, I've, I've learned to accept this.<eos> "Over time"?
Besides, I mean, look at this body.<eos> Our victim's wearing a suit.<eos> Looks nice, put together.<eos> Nope. I think you've got a body dump.<eos> Okay, so that's great.<eos> Thank you very much for coming in.<eos> If you don't have anything else about the case, you can...<eos> Oh, no, actually, I-I came to see Agent Aubrey.<eos> He's right here.<eos> Me?
Did you guys, uh, remodel recently?<eos> No. Maybe, like, five years ago.<eos> Why? No reason. I just...<eos> I used to come here a lo... long time ago.<eos> I see you've expanded.<eos> A conference room, second office.<eos> Oh, so business is good.<eos> Frank was outstanding at his job.<eos> Oh. How was he as a boss?<eos> Good enough.
I'm afraid not.<eos> But I do have other information you may find of use.<eos> Go on.<eos> Over the past several weeks here, I have heard whispers about a gentleman Who was...<eos> Uh, a favorite of yours.<eos> Your own nobles and advisors wished him to disappear, And this has caused you great pain.<eos> Proceed with caution, lady Lola.<eos> I will tell you one thing about Mary.<eos> She surrounds herself with people who are invested In her contentment.<eos> True friends.

I'm sorry, but it's you or me.<eos> [ gun clicks ]<eos> Aah!<eos> Simon...<eos> Shooting us is not gonna get that door open.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> The note says only one will survive.<eos> I need to make sure it's me.<eos> Don't go down this path.<eos> Sorry, preacher.
My assumption is that he feels that I can understand his predicament.<eos> Wait, predicament?<eos> Look, Bones, I love you and all, but this decision isn't up to you.<eos> I know... but isn't it up to Parker?<eos> Um, did you find any news out on that strange bacteria?<eos> It's a rare type of streptococcus.<eos> Well, that is not good for a singer.<eos> Yeah, I called the university health center.<eos> Scott and five other Whippersnaps checked themselves in a month ago with an unidentifiable strep-like infection.<eos> Unidentifiable?
I have some work...<eos> Ok...of course...<eos> I mean...<eos> See you then.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sir, coffee<eos> Here you go...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you from Bangalore?<eos> No, Mysore.
Why didn't you pick the call?<eos> Oh that was you?<eos> Why did you not receive the call?<eos> I was in a theatre...<eos> Theatre?<eos> Who was the guy who left now?<eos> Err...what do you want?<eos> Why these questions?<eos> Who is that guy?<eos> Friend...
You keep saying the same thing.<eos> You didn't know Sundar, yet went to meet him.<eos> A few hours later he's hanging from the fan!<eos> Sir, you have to believe me!<eos> I went to his house but...<eos> -Why did you go there? -<eos> Sir, I'm interning at Indian Express.<eos> I'm trying for a permanent reporting job.<eos> I was working on a story, and it led me to Sundar.<eos> What story?
♪ Let the silver voices guide you... ♪<eos> My first thought-- and I mean my first thought-- is "I don't care.<eos> I love her; I want to be with her."<eos> But then... ♪ Ooh ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh... ♪<eos> You know, I realize with something like this, you know...<eos> This isn't like that.<eos> Doesn't count unless you go in with your eyes wide open.<eos> So I wanted to talk through it first, you know?<eos> With a... doctor.<eos> And a friend.
Make her dinner.<eos> That's what I used to do.<eos> Well, maybe that didn't work out so well.<eos> Gear up, McGee.<eos> Got a dead Navy diver on a ship in the Atlantic.<eos> - Helo's waiting.<eos> - Uh, what about us, Gibbs?<eos> It's probably just an accident.<eos> You two stay here.<eos> Happy to!
Why you were called to a civilian ship.<eos> Ever been on board a dive vessel, son?<eos> Uh, you'll be my first, Captain.<eos> Well, I'll be gentle.<eos> State-of-the-art ship designed to facilitate deep-sea saturation divers.<eos> We carry things, we cook for 'em, basically we babysit 'em while they work on the ocean floor.<eos> Work?<eos> Welding an oil pipeline, 622 feet straight down.<eos> You're the doc.<eos> Medical examiner.
Heart attack?<eos> Stroke, maybe?<eos> Brain aneurysm?<eos> I thought you Navy investigators only showed up at crimes.<eos> Well, we're not exactly sure what happened yet.<eos> Senior Chief de la Rosa-- was he acting strangely at all, before this morning?<eos> No way.<eos> The guy was solid as a rock.<eos> And all four of you dive together, yes?<eos> Yeah, two by two.
Actually, that's why I'm here.<eos> You might be able to help with that.<eos> How so?<eos> Your name came up in connection with one of the operatives.<eos> The CIA's been desperate trying to reach her, but they've had no luck.<eos> I think everyone's hoping you might have a direct line.<eos> All right, Brenner. I... I don't know where Doris is, okay?<eos> I'm not talking about your mother, Commander.<eos> I'm talking about Lt. Catherine Rollins.<eos> What?
- Hello.<eos> - Hi there.<eos> Uh, I was trying to call Hotch, but it kept going to voicemail.<eos> He's still at the hospital with JJ.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Ok, I did what man chocolate asked.<eos> I got this list.<eos> There are certain things that should never exist, and one of those is this depressingly long list.<eos> Does anything specific jump out at you?<eos> Aside from the horribleness of it all, no.
Es ist angekommen.<eos> Ja, ich habe eine militareskorte angefordert.<eos> Naturlich, ich werde den egenstand zu ihnen bringen.<eos> Bitte, es ist Mir eine grosse ehre.<eos> The bed is cold.<eos> What is that, mon amour?<eos> This is why I've come here.<eos> And I thought you occupied my country to meet me.<eos> Mm-hmm. You were a bonus, Delphine.<eos> Mm. A treasure.
Captain...<eos> I think you're a soldier that's gone A.W.O.L.<eos> You've hopped a ride home, and this cockeyed story is some loony attempt to keep your cover as a civvie.<eos> That, or you're a spy.<eos> Deciding which? I'll leave that to the court martial.<eos> I need to speak with this man alone.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Captain, there are things, things about this mission that you don't know.<eos> Flash Gordon here will remain under guard until we reach the shore.<eos> Gladly.
My mentor in the men of letters, he taught me the symbol before he died.<eos> World Series, 1944. Go.<eos> Um...<eos> You're from the future.<eos> Tell me, who won?<eos> Um, the, uh, the Rangers.<eos> The Rangers?<eos> He believed it would keep me and the artifact safe on our journey...<eos> Who are the Rangers?<eos> ...from supernatural interference.

I didn't say anything to anyone.<eos> You're starting to mess with too many people.<eos> Okay, that's enough.<eos> Hannah, can you take this gentleman to registration, please?<eos> Dr. Lorenson, you with me... now.<eos> I don't understand how you can be pissed when I'm doing exactly what I should be doing.<eos> We don't make conclusions like that 30 seconds into the exam.<eos> You weren't in the exam. It doesn't matter.<eos> Irrespective of what you found, you led with your feelings.<eos> My feelings?
What are you guys talking about?<eos> That's a lot of fancy words to say we're trying to do everything we can for your dad.<eos> Can we go home tonight?<eos> - Oh, sweetheart...<eos> - I didn't ask you.<eos> Your dad is still very sick, Luke.<eos> Why can't you make him better?<eos> Well, that's what we're trying to do, son.<eos> How's he doing, Jesse?<eos> This one?
I'm not wearing that ridiculous thing.<eos> Wait till you see this boat, Carl.<eos> She's a thing of beauty.<eos> I'm telling you, Vince really knows his stuff.<eos> Yeah, you two have been getting pretty close during this little Sea-do re-do.<eos> You know, we have.<eos> And that's the magic of this boat.<eos> She showed me Vince in a completely different light, and I'm proud to call him my captain.<eos> I'm happy for you.<eos> And for me.
! That was a threat! You're going to threaten me?<eos> Break it up!<eos> Both of you, upstairs.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Oh, I was thinking maybe we could hit the range.<eos> You know I figured I owe you a chance for a double or nothing.<eos> Double or nothing? Last time was a scratch.<eos> Not a chance- - I had you by three on the last sheet.<eos> I can't anyway. I got plans.<eos> Plans with who, your couch?
We both know how you can be. How I can be?<eos> Yeah, you know, Mr. By-The-Book.<eos> Like you wrote the Patrol Guide yourself.<eos> Something wrong with that?<eos> I'm just saying the kid's got good instincts. You shouldn't hold him back.<eos> Are his "good instincts" why you had him placed in my precinct?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> That means you knew he was a liability, Danny. You-You're trying to protect him.<eos> You're damn right I'm trying to protect him.<eos> Yeah, at my expense.
For a baby.<eos> Man, how can I say no to that?<eos> You can't because you're my best friend.<eos> And we're right back where we started.<eos> Ah. Uh, what time did you say you wanted me there on Saturday?<eos> Seriously?<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> I invited Samuel because he's foreign.<eos> Gives me a little international flavor.<eos> 4:00.
Can't even wear my thumb ring.<eos> Get out.<eos> It's just this whole baby thing has got us on edge, you know?<eos> I'm trying to be strong for Molly, but I'm going just as nuts as she is.<eos> Well, you know what I always say.<eos> It'll happen... when it happens.<eos> Really?<eos> Is that when it happens, Carl?<eos> When it happens?<eos> Well, not with that attitude.
Is that when it happens, Carl?<eos> When it happens?<eos> Well, not with that attitude.<eos> Look, you don't know what we're going through.<eos> It's like slow torture waiting for that phone to ring.<eos> All right.<eos> I can see that this is tearing you apart, and I know you don't want to hear this, but... I think you may need to talk to a professional.<eos> Like a therapist?<eos> No, better.<eos> My psychic.
Right in the old... ear.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Good, good, good. Yours?<eos> Good.<eos> Great.<eos> Excellent.<eos> - Did you talk to Jesus today?<eos> - What?<eos> About fixing the front door?<eos> Oh, Jesus.
Voice mail.<eos> There's, um, something else that I've been wanting to talk to you about.<eos> I'll... I'll get it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's here.<eos> - The hospital. - Hmm.<eos> Yeah, it's Dr. Radford.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, I've got five minutes.<eos> Tonight? Sure.
I want to talk about your father.<eos> You know I loved him very much.<eos> With all your heart.<eos> When he died, a part of my heart died with him.<eos> He loved you so much, Mom.<eos> Yeah, it was once in a lifetime.<eos> Which is why I was so surprised when I started to feel the way I felt about your father with someone else.<eos> I saw you and Sam.<eos> Look, as much as I like Sam, I've just never really seen you kiss anyone...<eos> But your father.
I'm bringing a bunch of students with me on this dig, even a few from a Chicago high school for a couple of weeks.<eos> Just a two-week shift.<eos> Just to help carry equipment and assist the diggers.<eos> Just two weeks?<eos> Would it be too late to add another student?<eos> Oh, there's always room for another set of hands.<eos> - So, what does the note say?<eos> - "For luck."<eos> Thank you.<eos> Amazing.
No, it's not.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because I said so.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> You're right.<eos> I am.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Nobody important.
I'm gonna call the regional transportation board as soon as this event is over and fix your problem, Mister...<eos> Jankowski.<eos> Thanks so much, Alderman Becks.<eos> My pleasure, Mr. Jankowski.<eos> Now, how long has this been going on in your neighborhood?<eos> Oh, I'd say seven, eight weeks now.<eos> I am sorry I didn't know about this sooner.<eos> You should've called my office.<eos> I would've taken care of it right away.<eos> Well, those newfangled telephones.
Don't mind a bit.<eos> Not a bit.<eos> Hey. What's up?<eos> I just wanted to come clean.<eos> I've been meaning to say something to you since you got here.<eos> That night is easily the most embarrassing of my career.<eos> I had no idea for the entire length of that training course... that you were married.<eos> Yeah, it's something you might have wanted to check into before you let yourself in my back door with a six pack.<eos> Well, you know, I had a few, and it seemed like<eos> - a good idea at the time.
That's a little unusual.<eos> Can I talk to him?<eos> No, the doctor's in there going over his CT.<eos> Could you text me when you guys release him?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Now where you going?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Look, this guy has got something going on, and we have his prints all over his collar.<eos> Luckily, there's a police officer who owes me a favor.<eos> Not... not like that.
It's the first night of the hormone shots.<eos> Ro wants to be with me...<eos> Whose pants are those?<eos> Jonathan's.<eos> I went to his house to have sex with him, - and instead I burst into tears.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You cried?<eos> - Oh, she definitely cried. - I didn't mean to.<eos> Like, actual tears?
_ _<eos> Or that.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _ _<eos> - I'm sorry, what?<eos> - I'm sorry, what? _<eos> With who?
Anna?<eos> Anna!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Stitchers - 02x07 - Pretty Little Lawyers<eos> Anna Parker. 25.<eos> First year associate.<eos> No history of health issues.<eos> I get that a young woman doesn't just drop dead at work, but why are we on this case?<eos> This law firm's client base includes billion-dollar corporations, U.S. government agencies, as well as entire countries.<eos> Countries?
Kirsten!<eos> The only other associates who used their keycards to access Anna's floor around the time she died was Jen, Randall, Morgan, and Christine.<eos> Yeah, but that doesn't mean that there was nobody else who got up there.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Uh, sorry I'm late, I was just...<eos> Anna's gonna hit her best by date.<eos> We're stitching in five minutes.<eos> What happened?<eos> Kirsten caught me with Liam last night.<eos> Not with-him with him, just with him.
Is Alicia out today?<eos> She had that personal thing.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Well, when she calls in,<eos> - could you forward her to me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What are you doing for lunch today?<eos> Eating.<eos> Would you like to eat together?<eos> - 12:30?
And I talked about my purse business.<eos> - You sell purses?<eos> - No, I make them.<eos> I didn't really end up selling any.<eos> Oh. What did they look like?<eos> The purses?<eos> Really cool.<eos> Kind of macramé with leather straps and things sewn into them.<eos> Wow.<eos> What things?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> He... he said yes?<eos> He's saying yes?<eos> _<eos> What is that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hopefully, he lied for us, like a good agent.<eos> Chief.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You don't decide where we meet.<eos> Today I do.<eos> I'm not eating my lunch in that dump.<eos> What if I said I had intel on the truth-teller Shaw?<eos> Truth-teller?
You complain about bureaucracy more than I do.<eos> This is your chance right now to make a difference.<eos> If they really wanted me, they'd call.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I'd say sleep on it, but you might sleep right through it.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Seriously.<eos> He's right.<eos> About what? All of it.
And it's like you were never even there...<eos> Like everything you did was for nothing.<eos> I can't take a life of that.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> I am in no mood, Will.<eos> I get it.<eos> Natalie, I'm sorry.<eos> It wasn't the vitamin K. I was wrong.<eos> You, wrong?<eos> Amazing.
- Yes.<eos> - Chicago PD.<eos> We need to talk to you about Johnny Zakarian.<eos> We found your birth control pills at his apartment.<eos> Look, in this neighborhood, we don't talk to police.<eos> This is a double murder.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> I'll take some of those.<eos> I was seeing Johnny on and off.<eos> Mostly at night.
Okay, we went to your apartment.<eos> We know what you're hiding.<eos> Question.<eos> Why inmates?<eos> My life's mission is social justice.<eos> And...<eos> I started communicating with inmates who were serving unfair sentences, and I f...<eos> I had so much in common with these men.<eos> I'm also a misfit.<eos> And a prisoner.
That's -- that's by the -- yeah.<eos> You want my what?<eos> Forget what I want.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Money? Women?<eos> Glory?<eos> A big, shiny belt?<eos> Say the word, and it's yours.<eos> Because you're a demon?<eos> Businessman.
There we go. Look at that, huh?<eos> Hey! Well, you know what?<eos> We got to keep that one. That one's gonna be a little memento.<eos> We'll laugh about it some other time.<eos> Guys? She ain't doing so good.<eos> I got it.<eos> - Here.<eos> - Thanks. The one he killed, he's got the key. Good.<eos> W-What were they?<eos> Werewolves.
I say it.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Everyone's gone.<eos> Do you know anything... more uplifting?<eos> Not really, I'm just learning. Oh.<eos> How about this?<eos> How could I dance with another... Ooh When I saw you standing there?<eos> That's catchy.<eos> - You make that up?<eos> Oh, yeah. Just me and my mates,
There are two things you can do for me after I pass.<eos> First, I hope you'll be a friend to Deke.<eos> I hate to think of him all alone.<eos> Of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's... what's the second thing?<eos> You believe me when I tell you I love Deke and he loves me?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Deke and I have spent our lives next to one another.<eos> Not with one another.
We recommend Henry Hastings, third earl of Huntingdon.<eos> A man of royal blood, a devout Protestant, he'd make a fine king.<eos> But, as you've all been pressuring me for weeks, I've made my choice.<eos> This is good news, Your Majesty.<eos> Should I die, the English throne will be passed to my cousin.<eos> Mary, Queen of Scots.<eos> Your... cousin?<eos> - She's a...<eos> - Catholic? A woman?<eos> Yes.
Bonnie, how can I make it up to you?<eos> Walk with me, Luis.<eos> First of all, you really should fire that Dolores.<eos> She's a bit of a pill-popper.<eos> So, do you think we should let him off the hook?<eos> I think he's suffered enough.<eos> Oh, that's so sweet that you want to go easy on him.<eos> Okay, but I want blood.<eos> Just follow my lead.<eos> Lead?

- I was happy.<eos> And then I heard that she was sleeping with my best friend.<eos> And so I showed up here one night and she was sitting in that stool, again, with my best friend kissing her, and I just shot them both dead.<eos> That was back in 1961.<eos> I just got out of- got out of jail today.<eos> - Is that guy really there? - Yeah, he's there.<eos> - Hey, you want a beer? You want a beer?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What's the last one you had since 1961?<eos> ♪♪
So, how's Chiclet?<eos> Chiclet... Is wonderful.<eos> We cannot allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon.<eos> Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists.<eos> It's a nurse.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> I thought you said you wanted to be a doctor when you grew up.<eos> Then what do you want to be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A scientist? No.

Okay.<eos> I choose truth.<eos> What's the worst thing you know about your parents?<eos> Either one.
It's a sweet message finally.<eos> - It's not sweet at all.<eos> - Why? Yes, why?<eos> What is it, Xo?<eos> He used to end his texts to me with "besos" until I made him stop.<eos> You respond to your creepy Twitter stalkers and tell them, "Besos"?<eos> Each and every fan is a gift, Xiomara.<eos> Yeah, but you say the same thing to me.<eos> I don't want to be lumped in with thousands of other stalker fans.<eos> Millions.
Hey, Riley.<eos> Coffee?<eos> Is there something different? Give me a minute, I'll figure it out.<eos> I've decided that it is a brand-new day for Riley Perrin.<eos> That's right, when Riley Perrin takes a punch to the heart, she doesn't just hit the mat like a loser.<eos> Riley Perrin gets up and she starts fresh, starting with her living space.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Riley Perrin loves it. Well, tell Riley Perrin that I came by to bring her some coffee and offer my support while she and Danny work through their issues.<eos> "Issues"?
It's actually really nice to put down roots.<eos> You should try it sometime.<eos> Don't hold your breath.<eos> Christian Brodrick.<eos> Hi.<eos> NCIS.<eos> We'd like to ask you a few questions about your falling out with Secretary Porter.<eos> I wouldn't call it a falling out.<eos> What would you call being relieved of duty and forced into retirement?<eos> Inevitable.

Right, well, tick-tock.<eos> It's almost 2:00.<eos> It feels weird to just stand here and watch.<eos> I'm too type A for this.<eos> So what happened?<eos> Gibbs give you the brush-off?<eos> I get the sense he thinks I'm the enemy.<eos> Well, you're not.<eos> Unless you're one of his ex-wives.<eos> Or a lawyer.
Think she doesn't know what you are?<eos> I'm your fucking mother, so don't be so disrespectful.<eos> What did it say about when they're gonna evict us?<eos> End of the month.<eos> God.<eos> All right, I'll figure it out.<eos> There's something else.<eos> What?<eos> She wants to talk to you.<eos> To me?
Lemon Cremes and the Fudgies with the little stripes.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's called "Heavenly Protection."<eos> I can't fucking believe this.<eos> You can't afford to keep buying this crap.<eos> On TV, they said there were only 43 left, and they knocked the price way down.<eos> Put it on the shelf.<eos> No. We're returning it.<eos> Now, this pill, this one you take twice a day.<eos> Once in the morning and once at night.
It's a non-issue.<eos> Okay, but what about her, then?<eos> Mom, she came here begging us for money.<eos> She's using you.<eos> I appreciate that you're trying to fix things that happened in the past, but it's just not the right way to do it.<eos> Well, it's my way of doing it.<eos> She's not who you think she is.<eos> Who is she?<eos> You don't know what she does or who she associates with.<eos> Who?
Well, someone forgot to tell the writer.<eos> Mmm. You saw it.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Guy sure made you look like you got it out for the Speaker.<eos> No, I was quoted out of context.<eos> Do you still have it?<eos> I want to read it.<eos> Please, Nicky, I'm eating.<eos> Dad, you called Speaker Thomas<eos> "dangerously ignorant."
Never wear bottom liner.<eos> Makes the eye look smaller.<eos> Not with makeup. With getting revenge on Amy.<eos> I've been humiliated in six continents, and all I could come up with is putting a hamster in her locker.<eos> You want to cute her to death?<eos> No, Amy's terrified of rodents.<eos> She calls Mickey Mouse "The Great Satan."<eos> Yeah, I don't think I should be involved in this.<eos> I'm Switzerland... cool, neutral.<eos> Very expensive.
See, this is exactly why I don't want to get involved.<eos> Fights between best friends turn ugly quick.<eos> You two know each other's darkest secrets.<eos> That's true; we do.<eos> Thanks for helping, Shane.<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> I wasn't helping.<eos> I'm Switzerland!<eos> Switzerland.
Remember!<eos> - Yong Soo. - Yeah, Jung.<eos> Are you going somewhere with those guys?<eos> - Where?<eos> - That place "Remember."<eos> Don't they hang out in dangerous places?<eos> They're not so bad once you get to know them.<eos> - Do you want to go too?<eos> - Me?<eos> With you?
How does it feel being the savior of France?<eos> Better than being him.<eos> Leave us.<eos> You might have told me about the three nights in jail before I agreed to your plan.<eos> And you might not have fumbled the pearls, and I wouldn't have had to spend the last three days convincing my privy council to let me pardon you.<eos> And Beatrice Somerset?<eos> Where was she dragged off to last night?<eos> She offered to return my family's lands, and I accepted.<eos> She leaves today with my forgiveness.<eos> Your forgiveness?
What?<eos> But she confessed to lying about your mother.<eos> I-I don't understand.<eos> I never forgave my father for what he did to my mother.<eos> But at the same time, I never forgot his brutal effectiveness as a ruler.<eos> And then I learned things, ways in which he destroyed people's lives that I could never understand or imagine.<eos> Now I know how I must rule.<eos> I must always be seen as Henry's daughter.<eos> But in my heart, I can be something so much different.<eos> Your mother.
- Yeah? - He's walking into the camp with his platoon and they see all these people starving and dying, you know?<eos> And the whole platoon starts crying, only he can't cry.<eos> He's not crying 'cause he's, you know, he's stunned.<eos> He can't get a tear out.<eos> And everybody's, you know, crying their eyes out and the camp prisoners are all just looking at these people crying and he still can't cry.<eos> So he feels, like, self-conscious and guilty, you know?<eos> So he starts trying to think about things, like his mother or his kids, you know?<eos> Still can't cry.<eos> Finally, he thinks of "Bambi. "<eos> - "Bambi"?
- Fuck was that?<eos> Make an effort.<eos> - What?<eos> - Come on, she's a wacko, but she's very nice.<eos> And anyway, she obviously likes you.<eos> And you know, anyway, you're-<eos> - I mean...<eos> - What?<eos> I'm what?<eos> No, what?
- Yes.<eos> Does this mean we can be Facebook friends again? Yes!<eos> I can't believe you unfriended me.<eos> I had to. I stalked your girlfriend.<eos> - As for what happened next...<eos> - That was not my girlfriend. We work together. Your mom is crazy.<eos> What about you?<eos> Did you date anyone?<eos> Kinda. Yeah.<eos> My professor.
But one day they took us somewhere. They took us somewhere.<eos> I'd never hit anyone in my life, so I couldn't do it.<eos> I never imagined it would be that brutal.<eos> The person who gave you the order was Jang Hyun-seok of Far East Construction.<eos> How do you know his name?<eos> Scumbags like you are the ones I hate most.<eos> Parasites who exploit others.<eos> But this time, even if you don't want to I'll definitely get you out of here.<eos> Listen. From now on, you need to face those you fear most.<eos> Gangsters.
That's right.<eos> He's your age, he must've studied with you.<eos> You must know each other.<eos> Not many Koreans at that school.<eos> Right, Kyung-min, The tall thin guy who's good at basketball.<eos> He's not even 170cm.<eos> Sorry, I confused him with another friend. Let me see...<eos> Kyung-min...<eos> Honey, my brother told me you talk like a person from Gyeongsang Province.<eos> Gyeongsang Province?
Byun requested you as a witness.<eos> Jae-wook... he must hate me a lot.<eos> By the way, sir...<eos> Is there anything between you and Jae-wook that I don't know?<eos> What do you mean? What can there be?<eos> It's just mean political maneuvering.<eos> You just make sure I won't have to appear in court.<eos> You can go now.<eos> Such a moron...<eos> Warden Kim!
- You should've come sooner.<eos> - I'm sorry, sir.<eos> - Those pricks...<eos> - Useless bastards...<eos> You should at least tell me the charges!<eos> Don't push me! You crazy son of a bitch!<eos> How dare you terrorize a prosecutor of Korea?<eos> You call me a bastard?<eos> You know who I am?<eos> You son of a bitch!
An Appleby always lights the solstice fire.<eos> Cider brandy. Strong.<eos> So am I.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want with him?<eos> You leave him alone!<eos> You leave my son alone!<eos> - She was a good mistress. - Mm.<eos> She was a good mother... and grandmother.<eos> Grandmother?
Well, if we could convince the railway to bring a branch line<eos> - across our land...<eos> - Then that is what we shall do.<eos> You had a good day, didn't you?<eos> I did, thank you for asking.<eos> You would have been proud of me.<eos> I'm always proud of you.<eos> You promise me you don't miss London? No.<eos> - Come to bed.<eos> - Or your work?
None of your business.<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> I'm not to talk to you no more.<eos> - Now, why's that?<eos> - Cos you're a bastard. - That is enough!<eos> - You're all bastards and liars!<eos> You must forgive him, Mr Appleby. He's not a bad boy.<eos> Has he spoken to you about anything recently? Anything unusual?<eos> - He's been worried, sir, I won't lie to you.<eos> - What about?
I thought we were friends.<eos> I'm not to talk to you no more.<eos> - Now, why's that?<eos> - Cos you're a bastard. - That is enough!<eos> - You're all bastards and liars!<eos> You must forgive him, Mr Appleby. He's not a bad boy.<eos> Has he spoken to you about anything recently? Anything unusual?<eos> - He's been worried, sir, I won't lie to you.<eos> - What about?<eos> The changes.
How are you feeling?<eos> Not so good, your mother says.<eos> Am I still a bastard and a liar?<eos> You said they were pictures in my head.<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> - That was a lie.<eos> I've brought you something.<eos> I was clearing out the cupboard and I found these.<eos> We must have fought the Battle of Balaclava at least a hundred times.<eos> Gabriel and I.
Come and play, Charlie.<eos> Come with us.<eos> Come on, Charlie.<eos> You don't belong with them.<eos> You belong with us.<eos> We're coming for you, Charlie.<eos> - Come on, Charlie.<eos> - Get in, Charlie.<eos> I was the last one to join the gang... so they was always the pushers and I was always the trapper.<eos> The trapper?
Something wrong.<eos> Take care.<eos> Go on.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Wash your woes away.<eos> - Ma'am. I want to check the twine supply for the sheaving.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> There's a woman in the old millpond.<eos> - Under the water.
The old and the new.<eos> Ah, Mrs Hare.<eos> Mr Appleby.<eos> May I speak with Peter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, he's not here this moment, but I expect him presently.<eos> - Please, come in.<eos> Take some tea.<eos> He's a good boy.<eos> Clever.
Are you worried about him?<eos> Oh... yes and no.<eos> You can never be sure what someone is capable of.<eos> - Are you worried about me?<eos> - Yes and no.<eos> I wonder... when you're helping people... looking for what's wrong with them...<eos> What?<eos> .. what else you're looking for.<eos> Aren't your hands full enough with the harvest?<eos> With me?
- What did you do?<eos> The harvest was ruined.<eos> The village seemed damned.<eos> And Clarity frightened me.<eos> The way she looked at me.<eos> And one day, I saw her... give a potion to my mother - to put in my father's food.<eos> - To help them to conceive.<eos> I can see that now.<eos> But as a child, as an only child, I told myself she was a witch.<eos> An evil witch.
I want away from this place.<eos> I have to go, Mr Appleby.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - No, Martha.<eos> You can't stop me.<eos> Then you follow that path out of here back to Shepzoy House and you explain the situation to Mrs Appleby.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I only wanted to help Alice.<eos> She's... .. a flower of the forest.<eos> A secret flower.
No.<eos> When a child experiences trauma, they sometimes disappear inside themselves in order to handle it.<eos> They create other personas who can come out and deal with it better.<eos> I spoke to someone at the end of our session.<eos> It wasn't you.<eos> Well, who... who was it?<eos> Your mother or a version of her you've created.<eos> What did she say?<eos> She wants to protect you.<eos> From what?
It was the best I could do with who I had.<eos> All right, well, we can blame each other later.<eos> Right now we need a search party.<eos> Gather the dwarfs. Go.<eos> - Let's go, Sleepy.<eos> - I told you it was Walter.<eos> I know. I agree.<eos> We need our family back soon.<eos> Soon enough?<eos> Hey, big guy.
Yeah.<eos> When I move my head.<eos> Wait.<eos> Are you thinking meningitis?<eos> Well, with fever, headache, and neck stiffness, it's definitely possible.<eos> Possible or probable?<eos> Because she hasn't shown increased drowsiness or experienced any photophobia.<eos> Are you MDs?<eos> No.<eos> Engineers.
- I'm sorry, Jim.<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> - What changed your mind?<eos> - Downey.<eos> Right, you and Downey, the Dynamic Duo.<eos> Oh, that wasn't fair.<eos> I still don't agree with your call, but I can see why you made it.<eos> Awful day today.<eos> So what happened with this...<eos> with this patient?
Target was Jesse Kemp, 18 years old.<eos> Got shot in the leg, twice in the arm, but he'll make it.<eos> It's a miracle no one walking by got shot.<eos> Shooter dropped 20 rounds at least.<eos> - Is this your beat?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Is Kemp hooked up with the G Park Lords?<eos> - Very much so.<eos> - Where's Kemp now?<eos> Over there with the paramedics.
Ready for infil as soon as Nomad has eyes on target.<eos> All right.<eos> Listen up! We got a high-value target-capture mission.<eos> After beach entry, we silent patrol to the target, penetrate the perimeter defense, and we capture that son of a bitch Wu Ming.<eos> We'll have an immediate Helo EXFIL.<eos> Last time we were in Shanzhai, it got hot fast, so watch your six.<eos> Nathan James, this is Nomad.<eos> Going feet dry six clicks from Shanzhai.<eos> - Sonar.<eos> - Nothing on sub surface.
Cyril Taft, long time.<eos> Oh, too long.<eos> Great to see you, uh, in the flesh, David-- alive and well.<eos> Yeah, well, thanks to these guys.<eos> And, uh, how's your wife, uh, the other Dr. Woods?<eos> Uh, Jeanne, is it?<eos> Yeah, she's great.<eos> Out running errands.<eos> If you can stick around, I know she'd love to see you.<eos> Oh, maybe next time.
Doesn't matter now.<eos> Detonators.<eos> I wonder what he was planning to do with those?<eos> The whole theater to ourselves.<eos> We probably could've fooled around.<eos> Well, we'll consider this a recon mission.<eos> Now we know matinees are, shall we say "roomy," uh, we can plan accordingly for next time.<eos> Ooh, I like the sound of that.<eos> What-- "roomy"?<eos> "Next time."
Okay, "super-awkward" then, which I admit it was.<eos> But now that the case is basically over, maybe we can just move on?<eos> What do you mean, it's over?<eos> Gibbs, how are they?<eos> Taft and his wife, what happened?<eos> They're all right.<eos> What's over?<eos> Well, after you, uh, left for the hospital, we got a call from ATF Agent Kitt.<eos> Shared some information with us.<eos> What information?
Uh, no. I, um... Not yet.<eos> So I imagine you're still using U.S. v. Nunez as precedent?<eos> - Your Honor?<eos> - As to why the bullet testing should be given to the jury.<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> The jury had partial evidence. Now they will have full evidence.<eos> How are we expecting them to decide when they're missing the most essential piece of our case?<eos> The bullet evidence.<eos> They jury must have access to the... what?<eos> ...best available evidence.
What did you do?<eos> I had the baby.<eos> And left him and any belongings I had of his blasphemous father to die in the woods near Dijon.<eos> I have felt nothing since but guilt and remorse.<eos> For leaving the child.<eos> For giving birth to Satan's spawn.<eos> I brought a monster into this world.<eos> What if he still lives?<eos> I assure you, if your child is still alive, he is no monster.<eos> Only a man.
- I can't go.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> You've been so busy trying to build a business, we haven't spent any time together.<eos> - I miss you.<eos> - I know, I'm sorry.<eos> I promised Greer I would do her a favor.<eos> A favor.<eos> For your ex.<eos> Versus Paris with me.<eos> Your lover.
- Oh, come on.<eos> You've been so busy trying to build a business, we haven't spent any time together.<eos> - I miss you.<eos> - I know, I'm sorry.<eos> I promised Greer I would do her a favor.<eos> A favor.<eos> For your ex.<eos> Versus Paris with me.<eos> Your lover.<eos> Your princess lover.
They have no evidence but for a testimony from some servant boy.<eos> They will create evidence.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> I need to take my daughter, and... and... and leave.<eos> With your best horses, we can make it to the Netherlands in a few days time.<eos> If you escape, and then you are caught, it will only solidify the impression of your guilt.<eos> I will talk to the one person who can save your life.<eos> I don't give my heart or give up easily.<eos> We won't end like this.<eos> Not with your death.
- No. Well, you should.<eos> Her father's a friend.<eos> Get her into scrubs and into my OR stat.<eos> Yes, Doctor.<eos> - Excuse me, I'm...<eos> - Are you Millicent?<eos> Yes. Get into Dr. Shane's OR stat!<eos> So, Millicent, your father told me to look out for you.<eos> How is he?<eos> Your father.
Group hug.<eos> This is weird.<eos> Hey, you're quiet back there.<eos> Why'd the Siamese twin move to England?<eos> So the other one could drive.<eos> I like a girl with thick ankles and a little hair on their face.<eos> Um, what is...<eos> - It's the women, yeah.<eos> - Who slept... - Mm-hmm.<eos> - With Callahan?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Callahan?
I'm gonna take everything back to CTOC, see if I can retrieve some data.<eos> Oh, snap.<eos> Well, first things first.<eos> The guy's tongue has been cut out.<eos> Choked to death on his own blood.<eos> Is that a tattoo?<eos> Yeah, it's a... QR code.<eos> Could be a clue from our killer.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> A good father.
Oh, snap.<eos> Well, first things first.<eos> The guy's tongue has been cut out.<eos> Choked to death on his own blood.<eos> Is that a tattoo?<eos> Yeah, it's a... QR code.<eos> Could be a clue from our killer.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> A good father.<eos> A good husband.
It's just BuzzFeed, Kardashians, FriendAgenda over and over again.<eos> Everyone who's watched this video is going to the same sites.<eos> How are we gonna isolate the Flash Squad?<eos> Human behavior is reliable and disloyalty is their greatest fear.<eos> Can't get enough?<eos> Good, 'cause we've got more Flash Squad.<eos> Ah! This is so awesome!<eos> Check back in the a.m. for an exclusive tell-all interview with the group's leader after she's released from police custody.<eos> Riley woke up.<eos> "Leader"?
Yeah.<eos> Oh, that's just Echo.<eos> It's all good.<eos> He's a friend.<eos> Come on, show me what you got!<eos> Oil trail leads to the garage and out the driveway, and the kid's bike is missing.<eos> So we can rule out a kidnapping.<eos> Locals put out a BOLO.<eos> I'm thinking he's got a buyer for this hard drive already.<eos> CTOC?
Uh, sure.<eos> Elijah.<eos> I recovered the private messages between Jake and Wizard from Wizard's laptop.<eos> Jake doesn't know Wizard's dead.<eos> Okay, how's that important?<eos> Because Jake is still communicating with Wizard, or whoever he thinks Wizard is, and he's actually getting messages back.<eos> Echo.<eos> He stole Wizard's phone-- he's pretending to be him.<eos> Yeah, they've set up a meeting time to exchange the hard drive,<eos> 4:00 p.m. Where?
Yeah. So, um, you and Gloria.<eos> Is it serious?<eos> Well, let's hope it's not terminal.<eos> You have a unique way of bridging the player-management divide.<eos> Here you go, sir.<eos> I have a question.<eos> How good could I have been?<eos> If I'd gone a different route? If I'd tried to be a soloist, instead of an orchestra member.<eos> Well, tried wouldn't have come into it. You could have had a wonderful career.<eos> How good?
Yeah, I used to play basketball.<eos> Oh, cool. Me, too.<eos> Hai Lai.<eos> I hope you don't mind me just showing up like this.<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> So we finished our last day of auditions today.<eos> Okay. Anyone good?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah. Really good.<eos> But no-one was as good today as you were yesterday.<eos> Okay, and how about yesterday?
Take off these cuffs, let's see.<eos> Hey, we found them... rest of the crew.<eos> Yo, you might want to hear this.<eos> So the car that Collin Briggs was driving belongs to 61-year-old Jacob Seeley.<eos> He lives in Will County, has a house right outside of Joliet.<eos> And I did a search, figuring the car was stolen, but it wasn't reported, and guess who Jacob Seeley's the father of?<eos> Brendan Seeley.<eos> He did a stretch in Pontiac for a string of strong-armed robberies where he used a hammer.<eos> Guess who his cellmate was?<eos> Collin Briggs.
If I did, I don't remember.<eos> He brought you your meals every day for eight months.<eos> Grafton had a record for drug trafficking.<eos> You were serving time for drug dealing.<eos> Here you are, years later, still buddies.<eos> You two became business partners?<eos> Then what happened?<eos> Something go south with you two?<eos> I'm not a drug dealer.<eos> Just a murderer?
Yep.<eos> That could be our murder weapon. Yeah.<eos> Get it to Sebastian.<eos> I'll go chat with our deejay.<eos> I heard those gunshots, and the line went dead. I just...<eos> I called 911 right away.<eos> You knew Captain Grant?<eos> We served together in Iraq, two tours.<eos> He was your commanding officer?<eos> And my friend.
Something is just... is not right.<eos> We got a maniac with a knife in custody.<eos> My girl Kayla's safe and sound.<eos> I say everything is A-Okay.<eos> Just friends, he says.<eos> So, I forwarded Brandon's prints to Sebastian, guessing they'll match the one he pulled off the murder weapon, and we can close this up.<eos> Until then, have him sit tight.<eos> I got an important dinner date.<eos> Lasalle, you still on good terms with your friend from Naval Intelligence?<eos> Gloria?
Practice, recital, more practice.<eos> Total focus, and never knowing if I'm actually good enough.<eos> You're the best damn musician at that school.<eos> Says my father.<eos> And even if that were the case, what does that even mean?<eos> Am I gonna do this from now until... I die?<eos> Sacrifice all my time in front of a piano?<eos> Time with my friends, my family?<eos> You know, sometimes I wonder what our lives might have been like if you'd been... a car salesman or something?<eos> A wh...? A car salesman!
Don't tell 'em.<eos> Do whatever you want.<eos> Prime Ministers Verma and Khoosat should already be with the president in the Oval Office.<eos> Elizabeth, I saw your interview this morning.<eos> Damn Doomsday Clock.<eos> Pretty sure we covered several actual international crises that I made sound like polite disagreements.<eos> Yeah, but the clock can hurt us.<eos> It's metaphoric.<eos> The timing couldn't be worse.<eos> Of the metaphoric clock?
Her e-mail showed no complicity with terrorists or radical jihad.<eos> If she had known that Hijriyyah was married to the world's most wanted man, she might have been willing to help.<eos> She lived for years under a very oppressive regime.<eos> All she saw was a powerful government agency suddenly targeting a former student.<eos> She was concerned for the girl's safety.<eos> That is profoundly uninteresting to me.<eos> I'm turning this over to Jose now.<eos> Put together a small tactical team to go in there and turn the place upside down for anything that might be of use.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> My pleasure.
Yesha.<eos> Dad...<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad...<eos> I sympathize with Mr. Dargis.<eos> Everyone in this courtroom sympathizes with a father who loses his daughter, but this billboard he put up is intended to maliciously harm my client's business.<eos> No. My client's intent is simply to ensure that those ultimately responsible for his daughter's death are held accountable in the court of public opinion,<eos> - since the Protection<eos> - Here we go. of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act precludes them from being held accountable<eos> - in a court of law.
Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I need a minute of your time.<eos> Sounds serious.<eos> Who were you seeing last night at the Avenue Tavern?<eos> - Who was I seeing?<eos> - Yes.<eos> A woman.
At least they're not starving.<eos> Even slaves don't starve, Henry.<eos> What's your point?<eos> If you have to ask I can't possibly explain it.<eos> Well, this oughta cheer you up.<eos> "City facing growing rat problem."<eos> - Below that.<eos> "Banana split... "<eos> - They split a banana lengthwise...<eos> - "With ice cream.
- Really?<eos> Crabtree!<eos> In my office.<eos> Alright, then.<eos> What have you found out?<eos> Sir, unfortunately, very little.<eos> None of the men there wanted to speak to us.<eos> Even the friendly ones.<eos> Not easy for a man down on his luck to trust anyone, much less a copper.<eos> Ah, Murdoch!
- Is that so hard to believe, Miss James?<eos> - Yes. Well, I suppose you won't be wanting a ride in it, then.<eos> That depends on where you're taking me.<eos> As a matter of fact, we've just found out about a new ice cream concoction that is a hit out in the Beaches.<eos> - We're driving out to give it a try.<eos> - It's called a banana split.<eos> Bananas. How exotic.<eos> It's a combination of ice cream And cut length wise bananas Topped with things such as pineapples and nuts...<eos> And then they drizzle the entire thing<eos> - in a thick chocolate sauce.
Attention, fellows.<eos> Mr. Riley needs six strong men today.<eos> That's seven. I said six.<eos> - I was a lumberjack.<eos> - Any mill work?<eos> I was a sawyer too.<eos> You'll do.<eos> Get in the wagon out front.<eos> - What about me?<eos> - Next time.
- "FP".<eos> What does it mean?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> But it clearly meant something to Mr. Graveman.<eos> Speaking of which, look at this.<eos> Courtesy of Station House Five.<eos> A body seen buried north of Pottery Road<eos> That's close to the Riley sawmill.<eos> Look at the date and time the report was made.<eos> 7:52 PM.
My inquiries are on the young man's behalf.<eos> Is that all right?<eos> It's not like he did anything.<eos> You may be right.<eos> In my experience, the guilty party rarely hires someone to investigate.<eos> But, if you don't mind me asking you, why do you think he's innocent?<eos> For a woman who's husband has been missing for almost a week, you seem rather unconcerned.<eos> That's because I'm not concerned- - I'm angry.<eos> Vince isn't lying in a ditch somewhere, he ran off with some redhead.<eos> Probably a patient or a nurse.
family thing on Lake Ronkonkoma.<eos> I took a long weekend.<eos> Vince and I talked on the phone that day-- work stuff.<eos> He seemed normal.<eos> Julie Monahan, drug rep.<eos> What about her?<eos> Mrs. Bader mentioned something about a redhead to my partner.<eos> Julie makes her rounds here every month or so.<eos> She's flirty.<eos> With all the guys.
You know that's not what I meant.<eos> Odd for her.<eos> Marcus?<eos> Hey, I thought you guys would want to know Vincent Bader's body turned up.<eos> The M.E. is taking a look right now.<eos> The body was found wrapped in tarp and tied with rope.<eos> A couple spotted it off a path in Forest Park.<eos> We think he was killed elsewhere and moved there.<eos> Looks like someone split his head open<eos> - with an ax.
Do it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - Is this James?<eos> - Who's this?<eos> Leon Terris.<eos> Got your number from Beto.<eos> Yeah, Beto's my boy.<eos> What's up?<eos> Beto says you're the dude who set up the meeting with my brothers,<eos> John and Reggie. Yeah.
Maria gave her to me before she left.<eos> She's mine now.<eos> When did she leave?<eos> Where'd she go?<eos> I don't know. I swear to God.<eos> You lied to the cops.<eos> You don't lie to me.<eos> You understand?<eos> She and Angel left with some woman.<eos> Policewoman?
I did.<eos> Once.<eos> I persuaded a full legion of our brothers to follow you and throw God, that ungrateful tyrant, from His celestial throne.<eos> Our fellow fallen still pay the price.<eos> Can you not hear their cries echoing from hell?<eos> Rest assured.<eos> Our brothers will be freed and our tyrant father will weep.<eos> But I would have my mother beside me then.<eos> Beside you?<eos> Or beneath you?
Now that the supervisors have been and gone, we just have to sit here, safeguard the place until the public administrator comes and starts to try to make inventory of all this?<eos> Real-life police work, Eddie. It's not all paperwork and donuts.<eos> You know, we turned over a lot of money yesterday, and there's still no next of kin.<eos> Some of this junk lying around might be worth something.<eos> Bosses just want us to keep an eye on it till things get settled.<eos> Yeah, well, hey, can we open a window, please?<eos> The guy's gone, but that stink is very much still here.<eos> You know,<eos> Harry must have been hiding from something.<eos> Or someone.
Maybe we should talk outside.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Everybody out of the diner.<eos> Let's go. Come on. Come on.<eos> You know, Danny, at my age I'm not going back to prison.<eos> We can do this the hard way if you want. But I think you might've caused enough pain for your family already.<eos> If... if I come with you, quietly... it's on one condition.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I talk to Frank.<eos> Nobody else.

You got a problem, or does the problem have you?<eos> You trying to cover for somebody?<eos> Not at all. Like, maybe you got used to life inside, had it wired pretty good.<eos> You're dead wrong.<eos> I'm not covering for anybody.<eos> Right, and you have no idea who the shooter was in your own restaurant, with your own people around.<eos> Nobody saw nothing.<eos> Where was your boy when this happened?<eos> In the back.<eos> Who with?
I like our lives, honey.<eos> We've only just rediscovered us.<eos> I mean, why would we wanna strap on suicide vests now, you know?<eos> Hello, can anyone hear me?<eos> Hello. My glass is not clinking very well.<eos> Not to embarrass you, Frances, but readers of the "New York Times"'<eos> "Weekend Activities in the Hudson Valley" section might've noticed an item describing this "small jewel box of a gallery focusing on the works of local artists."<eos> And I'm so proud of you, Frances.<eos> And I just think we should raise a glass to Frances and the Hudson River Contemporary gallery.<eos> To Frances!
He's out there.<eos> Who is out there?<eos> The Wolf.<eos> The one who betrayed you.<eos> Ugh! Oh yes...<eos> I feel your rage.<eos> [Groaning] Your hands... around another throat.<eos> [Gasping] Where is he?<eos> He's with her.<eos> The She-wolf...
And this guy Sasha thinks he can just show up and try to unhinge all of that.<eos> So don't let him.<eos> No but at the same time, I never even really knew my parents.<eos> Those memories that I have, I don't even know if they're real, or just... how I want to remember them.<eos> I know how important family is to you.<eos> But I hate to see you get torn up by this.<eos> When my parents died... no one stepped forward for me.<eos> So I closed the door on the idea of ever finding any real blood relatives.<eos> And after many years, I finally found my family.<eos> With you.
But I wanted to be the one to tell you.<eos> You didn't tell me.<eos> What are you trying to do to us here?<eos> I was trying to find a way to bring it to you with a solution.<eos> That's not your place.<eos> We're going to find them... and we're going to turn them back over to the Russians.<eos> You can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> Sasha is my father.<eos> My real father.
Easy.<eos> Couple birth certificates and driver's licences, couple new passports, and hey, while we're at it,<eos> - Yeah, I know, it's... it's a lot.<eos> I know that.<eos> It is a lot.<eos> And it can be done, it just takes time.<eos> They don't have time.<eos> Are you sure Jeremy will go for this?<eos> He's talking to my father.<eos> "My father".
Just Singular being Singular.<eos> Gosh darn it.<eos> He ran away after a while... my brother, not the rat... he didn't get far, obviously, not with nine toes.<eos> Listen, it wasn't a great childhood, and I know that I come on strong, but I guess, if I can scare people with my pranks, then I know I'm not the only one who's scared.<eos> What a cruel, terrible world we live in.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> I'm so, so, so, sorry.<eos> You're stupid, Schmidt.<eos> And you're-you're stupid, too, Cece,<eos> Stupid.
I have no options.<eos> Okay, well... Sleep with both eyes open, you idiot.<eos> It's one eye, you idiot.<eos> - Cut your chance in half, you idiot.<eos> - Idiot. Hey, don't bill me for this.<eos> - Sorry, that was my divorce lawyer.<eos> - What? ! Yeah, it's been a day.<eos> So I got married. Then my wife was shipped overseas.<eos> And I remain married.<eos> What?
Tell me what's going on.<eos> That's definitely the victim.<eos> - Must be the wife.<eos> - It's the girlfriend.<eos> And you know that because?<eos> She's my sister.<eos> You never thought to mention you have a sister?<eos> Please lay off the sister talk for now.<eos> I have to figure out what she's into this time.<eos> This time?
And if your interference jeopardizes a conviction,<eos> God help you, 'cause I won't.<eos> Manny Diaz used to be the fifth man in a BE gang.<eos> Jewelry shops, banks, until he got caught.<eos> And this matters because?<eos> Well, word on the street is he now specializes in hideaway compartments like the one we found in Ian Gendry's van.<eos> He uses a custom auto shop as a front.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> I'm gonna hit the streets with Harris right now.<eos> Harris?
You were here 18 months ago.<eos> Uh, yeah. It's my place.<eos> So?<eos> Do you recognize him?<eos> No, should I?<eos> Uh, I was here about, um...<eos> [Speaks Korean] I was here about a year and a half ago.<eos> Something happened.<eos> You yelled at me. Oh, you're the guy with the watch.<eos> What watch?
It was messy, boarish, lacking the sophistication we expect from any potential member.<eos> - It was her fault.<eos> - It was his fault.<eos> No, it was my fault, thinking that either of you could ever have filled Phillip's shoes.<eos> Mr. Wood, please. Give me another chance.<eos> No, give me another chance.<eos> I will find Phillip's killer.<eos> She won't.<eos> She's been two steps behind me this whole time.<eos> Behind you?
He was killed with a knife shaped exactly like that one.<eos> Hey!<eos> Drop it! Help me!<eos> - Let her go, Jordan. - Stand back!<eos> You got no where to go. Drop the scissors.<eos> Listen, fellas, I'm a writer, so trust me when I say if the villain surrenders, oh, it's just so unsatisfying!<eos> That's why they always go out in style.<eos> Just relax, Jordan.<eos> Don't do anything stupid.<eos> Stupid?
I'm gonna have to keep an eye on you.<eos> Hayley: [Sighs] Okay.<eos> Are you not packed?<eos> I can't do it.<eos> Pack you clothes?<eos> Walk away.<eos> Hayley, I need to know what happened to me.<eos> Okay, there's one last thing.<eos> Just before you left to get your memories erased, you came to me with one final request.<eos> Like what kind of request?
Oh.<eos> I thought you were gonna say a lover.<eos> No.<eos> Only money.<eos> Never been screwed over in love.<eos> Oh, you feel sorry for me now.<eos> Nice robe.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So what's up with your husband?<eos> My husband?
- But that didn't pan out?<eos> - Let's just say I'm not gonna be hanging up my bike shorts anytime soon.<eos> I was very clear with Veronica about what she was getting into.<eos> Look, I'm telling you the truth.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm sorry you got saddled with all of this.<eos> Uh, it's all right.<eos> But this guy seems to be telling the truth.<eos> He's an idiot<eos> - but not necessarily a con man.
He was one of Governor Florrick's top donors, yes?<eos> Yes, that is true.<eos> In fact, wasn't Lloyd Garber the single largest donor to Governor Florrick's presidential campaign?<eos> Yes, he donated money,<eos> - organized fund-raisers.<eos> - And they had conversations you weren't privy to?<eos> Of course.<eos> Donors on that level get a lot of access.<eos> Did Governor Florrick ever mention a falling out or a period of friction?<eos> With Mr. Garber?
We didn't do a source of funds, but there was a rumor that his father was someone who mattered.<eos> Are you going to tell me what this is about?<eos> Is there any chance his father was...?<eos> No, we have to stop talking.<eos> You'll be subpoenaed about what I just asked, and I will be about what you said, so I am ending this.<eos> Oh, hey, I'm heading out.<eos> What's up?<eos> Sorry, I gotta rush off.<eos> I'd love to talk.<eos> How about later tonight?
Or... do I tell Cary and David Lee that she approached me?<eos> Tell Cary.<eos> Really?<eos> Really.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm turning my brain off.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> You want to get a drink?<eos> No, I'm too tired.<eos> Next time.
Of course we can, but I'm not changing my mind.<eos> I am willing to continue working with you on an outpatient basis, as I explain in my letter, but I just need to get home.<eos> You know I have the same goal for you.<eos> We work together, so you can safely reenter your home environment.<eos> My blackouts have actually increased since I've been here.<eos> - Doesn't that say something?<eos> - It does, and I know it's not comfortable, but it's because we're doing the work.<eos> With all due respect, I can't remember any of our work.<eos> I would also like to start medication immediately.<eos> - Norman...
Let's eat.<eos> Welcome home, Norman.<eos> Welcome home to your freezing house.<eos> Thank you, Mother.<eos> Oh, and thank you for everything that you did and went through and put up with to get me the help I needed.<eos> I'd do anything for you. You know that, right?<eos> Um, so did the... sheriff actually have to live here?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Sometimes?
Ah, come on.<eos> It's my family.<eos> How could it be weird?<eos> Do you want... uh, you want me to give you a few minutes to go say hi?<eos> Yeah, that'd be great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Norman.<eos> Look at you. Y-you look wonderful. Sit down.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Oh, uh, better every day.
You're just on edge.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I don't know, Norman.<eos> I-I don't know what's going on.<eos> You know why? Because no one tells me anything.<eos> Things that you do.<eos> Things that affect my life.<eos> I mean, but why talk to me about anything?<eos> I mean, what am I?<eos> Like a doll?
I understand.<eos> And it's freezing. I shouldn't have asked you over.<eos> Yeah. No, we wanted to see you before we left.<eos> - Is the chocolate coming out?<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> I'm gonna have to get it cleaned, but it's still so wet.<eos> Okay, well, let me give you this.<eos> Just drop it off on your way to Seattle.<eos> Yep. Thank you. - You'll come visit us soon?<eos> - Yeah.
That's why I-I'm gonna ask Barton to come back to the clinic.<eos> You know, he's been such a constant in my life.<eos> Like family.<eos> And since our family is no longer what it was, and, uh,<eos> Virginia and I are... are no longer what we were... Might I suggest that you consider dating.<eos> Dating?<eos> Libby.<eos> Why not?<eos> I am.<eos> Who?
Whereas husbands, used to having their laundry pressed, dinners cooked, they floundered without wives.<eos> And yet here you are, eating Chinese food at the office while your wife is...<eos> where is Nancy tonight?<eos> Thank you for reminding me.<eos> Here I'd gone a whole three minutes without thinking of Nancy's "dinner" with her old college "friend," Bruce.<eos> My point is, Bill's relationship that most resembled a true marriage was with me.<eos> I was his work wife.<eos> And since work was always his life...<eos> But now he's remarrying, thanks to you.<eos> My wife.
Uh, three or four, maybe.<eos> Three or four?<eos> You can't be certain of the exact amount?<eos> It may be five.<eos> Actually, yes, I have been sexually with five women.<eos> And the men that you've been with, how many were there?<eos> It's a standard question.<eos> Have you had sexual experiences with men?<eos> Well, the answer is no. Obviously.<eos> Uh, men, no.

- Woops! Sorry.<eos> Fancy but powerless.<eos> Pretty sure only Peacemaker can send revheads back to Hades.<eos> - You don't know that for a fact.<eos> - Wanna bet? Loser buys dinner? No.<eos> You lose, you die.<eos> Besides, - I don't gamble.<eos> - You're sending in - your best agent...<eos> - My only agent.<eos> ...with the wrong gun that....
Better yet, a shot?<eos> Yeah, I did, but he was better.<eos> Better than what?<eos> You two look around the homestead.<eos> See if you see anything unfamiliar, something occult-ish.<eos> Occult...? That is so specifically vague.<eos> You want a safe place to lay your head for you and your sister?<eos> - Keep your eyes open, Earp.<eos> - For trouble?<eos> That too.
Oh, the cavalry.<eos> Just in time.<eos> Got a report of shots fired, hostage situation.<eos> I call the Tac team? It'll take them an hour to get here from the city.<eos> You take your cues from me.<eos> So we just stand around with our thumbs up our asses?<eos> And if that's how you've been trained, feel free.<eos> Hostage taking is about bargaining, right?<eos> We have things they want.<eos> - The combination?
- No.<eos> You two, clear the scene.<eos> - Let's go!<eos> You really think you solved the riddle, a way to break out?<eos> When my daddy wanted to scare us, he'd describe the brutal things that happen to revenants if they try to escape the Triangle.<eos> - Bet he didn't do it justice, which is why we went to all this trouble.<eos> The vessel. Right where she said it'd be.<eos> Woman of her word.<eos> Who?<eos> Your girlfriend?
- I'm sorry, Sister.<eos> No, get out of my way!<eos> Shh, shh.<eos> What have you done to me now, Queen of Bitches?<eos> Only ripped your soul through the wall of silence, cursed you back to life, and trapped you forever in the home of all your tears.<eos> Run as far and as fast as you may, Mary Sibley.<eos> You can never escape Salem.<eos> You are resurrected by the very life force of the primordial tree.<eos> Now you are forever bound to the realm of its roots...<eos> To Salem.
Diagnosed two years ago with relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis.<eos> Increased symptoms recently.<eos> How come you know so much about me and I haven't even met you yet?<eos> Symptoms include persistent tremor in the right hand.<eos> Yeah, this damn thing showed up right as I was landing a 13-city tour.<eos> Uh, only time I had bad timing. I prayed for a long time for this break. - I mean, this is...<eos> - This is big. Yeah, it's huge for me. I mean, I'm the opening act.<eos> The audience won't be there to see me, but But I swear they'll leave knowing my name.<eos> And I have to kick ass, but I can't.<eos> Not with this... wobbly hand.
I'm a virgin. Yes. So what?<eos> It's not something I talk about, okay?<eos> We all have things we don't talk about.<eos> She thinks your husband walks on water.<eos> Cincinnati, Ohio, pediatrics.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who's next? Uh, I'll go.<eos> Uh, Charles Percy, Brookings, South Dakota.<eos> I want to be a trauma surgeon.<eos> Or maybe vascular.
Make the spy sit in the car. - Yes Sir. Hey...<eos> Usman Afridi...<eos> Shahid Afridi's uncle huh?<eos> Do you know who you are arresting?<eos> I am the guest of Lahore's most respected family.<eos> Javed Ahmed...ex-Governor.<eos> Have you heard his name?<eos> So...are you Mr. Senior's...<eos> No, Junior. I am his son's guest.<eos> The special kind.

You gotta pick one of 'em.<eos> Hey, hey! Get these damn handcuffs off me.<eos> - Take 'em off me!<eos> - No. I'm not gonna do that.<eos> Look, there is cold beer in the fridge, but... yeah, you can't reach that.<eos> Uh... and I gotta take your car. Sorry.<eos> Riggs!<eos> If you're not gonna do it, I gotta go.<eos> You're a good man, Roger.<eos> And a good cop.
You okay?<eos> [Claire] That's okay.<eos> It happens all the time.<eos> Grate that.<eos> Sprinkle a bit of sea salt, a touch of cider vinegar, give it a toss, and then a dash of... ghost pepper hot sauce!<eos> Super careful with that.<eos> It's pretty much the spiciest thing on the planet.<eos> [clears throat] So... um, what are we doing?<eos> Getting Seo-yeon back.<eos> With radishes?
In the middle of the night?<eos> We needed more for tomorrow night's campfire and if I didn't take care of it tonight, it would be one more thing Gloriosa would add to her list.<eos> I've got this!<eos> (giggling)<eos> What about you two? Why are you hanging out in the woods in the middle of the night?<eos> Oh, I was sleep walking. Twilight found me and was bringing me back to camp.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Come on, I'll walk you guys back.<eos> I'll protect you from<eos> Gaia Everfree.<eos> Everfree, Everfree!
Twilight, listen to me, you are in charge.<eos> You are a light, darling, a force of good.<eos> Yeah, you can kick the darkness's butt!<eos> We're here for you, Twilight.<eos> And we'll be here, no matter what.<eos> We believe in you.<eos> You are not Midnight Sparkle!<eos> No, I am Twilight Sparkle and the magic I carry inside me is the magic of friendship.<eos> No!<eos> (yelps)
♪ You'll always be, Everfree<eos> (harmonizing chorus) ♪ To be the legend you were meant to be<eos> (harmonizing chorus) ♪ To be the legend you were meant to be<eos> Thank you all so much for coming and for helping us raise enough money to save Camp Everfree!<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> (sigh) If I just asked for help in the first place.<eos> (chuckles) Don't sweat it!<eos> It's kinda what we do.<eos> Not to brag or anything, but it's pretty cool how I saved all those campers from those rubus fruticosus.<eos> Blackberry brambles.
It's just not what I imagined.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> Before he died,<eos> Francis asked me to give this to you the day you left for Scotland.<eos> Thank you, Bash.<eos> I'm not ready to open it just yet.<eos> Please put it in the carriage.<eos> You've been a true friend to me, Bash.<eos> More than a friend.<eos> My family.
He tightens his hands around my throat.<eos> It increases the sensation.<eos> He's not going to harm a queen who ensures his station.<eos> He needs me.<eos> It's fine. I'm fine.<eos> Queen regent.<eos> One of the lieutenants who served General Gaghan is here.<eos> He wants to speak with you at once.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Lieutenant Gambon.
And would require the oversight of a third party NGO to ensure the process preserves the agriculture of the Inhawoji people.<eos> But if we can figure that part out,<eos> Hercutel gets to keep its gold,<eos> Dalton gets to keep his favorite congressman happy, and Hugo can come down from the mountain and go home.<eos> It's like we solved a Rubik's Cube with our feet.<eos> Yeah, well, speaking of which, where is Chile with the rescue mission for Hugo?<eos> It looks like he's really getting up there.<eos> They were planning a rescue this afternoon, but a blizzard started kicking up near the peak, so... they're waiting for conditions to clear.<eos> We got a hit.<eos> From Hijriyyah?
- Hospital policy says you do.<eos> - You need to stop...<eos> - Move, move. Hey, uh-uh.<eos> My partner could've died back there.<eos> You step aside.<eos> This is a hospital.<eos> Our priority is to treat patients, not to make arrests.<eos> As soon as he's out of surgery and awake, he's all yours.<eos> Get me that blood, or you're under arrest.<eos> On what charge?
- Look who's back.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Dr. Rhodes said you were covering for me.<eos> Yes, and thank God you are back.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't pick you up.<eos> If he was driving Uber, he'd get five stars.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Why is everybody standing around?<eos> Back to work, Reese.<eos> Chop chop.
No, it has a password. I'm gonna have Tech get into it.<eos> Anything else?<eos> No, not for now.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What is it?<eos> It looks really old.<eos> It's not Pandora's box, is it?<eos> No, I'm not really sure.<eos> But we've already opened it.<eos> With the keys?
What?<eos> Just let all these people die?<eos> You realize how insane you sound?<eos> Killing us all with smallpox.<eos> You think I'd let you do that?<eos> I'm a son of Wayward Pines.<eos> You're not only a son of Wayward Pines.<eos> What else would I be?<eos> You're mine.<eos> My son.
How can you be against us securing our food?<eos> They'll have the same security, even more than the harvesters did.<eos> They'll return once the first batch of studies are complete.<eos> They're not going far.<eos> I understand your concerns, Megan but we need to do this.<eos> Easy, easy.<eos> You from Wayward Pines?<eos> Where else would I be from?<eos> - You a nomad?<eos> - What? "A nomad"?
His, uh... his name's Jason.<eos> You'd love him.<eos> Where the hell are we?<eos> I woke up in... some pit.<eos> Do they put people in pits?<eos> They do a lot of things.<eos> Where you going?<eos> So, wait, Pilcher sent you out here?<eos> What'd you do to piss him off?<eos> Nothing.
Dr. Yedlin, we need your help.<eos> Can you come with me now?<eos> They're back, aren't they?<eos> We've seen some of them out there, yes.<eos> Why are you sending civilians? Soldiers to fight the Abbies, civilians to fight the fires.<eos> It's not the same thing.<eos> Well, they'll die the same.<eos> Should we just let the crops burn?<eos> If we lose the food, then we're all dead.<eos> What about the explorers?
Yes, no.<eos> Teach her a pattern, a common language, or... understand hers.<eos> Just like that?<eos> Taught my dog to go outside in two days.<eos> She's smarter than that.<eos> Abby Comprehension 101.<eos> Associating images with meaning is the basis of all language.<eos> I suppose if-if the female brain is superior, then...<eos> Communication should be successful.<eos> Maybe even easier than with our own species.
It's mankind gone wrong.<eos> These things stopped being human quite some time ago.<eos> We could go back to sleep.<eos> If you didn't plan for this, maybe we should.<eos> We need to get back to the others.<eos> There's work to be done.<eos> How can we live here?<eos> I had hoped we wouldn't have to encounter them, but they're here;<eos> this is the new reality, so we have to drive them away from here a-and then build a fence.<eos> Over the settlement?
- You okay?<eos> What are you guys doing out here?<eos> ! Get inside!<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> Go back to your homes!<eos> - We're here to help, okay?<eos> - We don't need your help!<eos> - Hey, behind the house.<eos> - Where?<eos> Behind that home.
What are you doing out here?<eos> Go back to your homes!<eos> - We're here to help, okay?<eos> - We don't need your help!<eos> - Hey, behind the house.<eos> - Where?<eos> Behind that home.<eos> Over here, over here, over here!<eos> - Where?<eos> - Behind... behind you!
Go back to your homes!<eos> - We're here to help, okay?<eos> - We don't need your help!<eos> - Hey, behind the house.<eos> - Where?<eos> Behind that home.<eos> Over here, over here, over here!<eos> - Where?<eos> - Behind... behind you!<eos> - Over there behind you! - Over there!
I know it seems strange to some of you.<eos> You were born here.<eos> You've never known anything but Wayward Pines.<eos> But I've spent more time in and out of these pods than any of you.<eos> Even Pilcher.<eos> Asleep, awake, awake, asleep.<eos> And look at me.<eos> I'm not damaged at all, am I?<eos> Do you dream?<eos> Sometimes.
- Enough with the rules, Jason.<eos> No one's pointing a gun to your head and forcing you to do anything.<eos> Sometimes you just have to do what your heart tells you to.<eos> You're right. You do.<eos> I'll finish this up and come back later.<eos> You should go home.<eos> For a little while.<eos> See him.<eos> Say good-bye.<eos> To the town.
- You are her mother.<eos> You would feel it more than anyone.<eos> RINGING TONE<eos> 'Where are you?<eos> ' Why?<eos> I'm just asking, Matthew.<eos> I'm worried about you.<eos> I feel like we don't talk any more.<eos> 'You out with those friends of your friends again?<eos> Those Adler twins...'
One of the "village idiots"... ..as we used to sometimes call them on the base.<eos> And you're saying, this whole time... he was living some kind of double life and I didn't even notice?<eos> Alice says she was moved several times during her...imprisonment.<eos> Did your husband travel much?<eos> We liked it here.<eos> I travelled enough in the Army.<eos> On his own, then?<eos> The German police tell me your husband's a keen bird-watcher.<eos> Does he take many trips? Weekends away?<eos> Some.
Ma'am.<eos> Captains Stone and Reed to see you, ma'am.<eos> Send them in.<eos> Captain Stone, the major will see you now.<eos> Lieutenant Gettrick's been outside the wire four days now.<eos> We need to take some troops and look for him.<eos> He's gone walkabout.<eos> Isn't that what you're all doing?<eos> Going out and banging the locals before going home to your wives and girlfriends?<eos> With respect...
You know how much I wanted another baby.<eos> Maybe if we'd got out of this place...<eos> I wasn't ready to leave.<eos> I don't know if we can come back from this... ..but I want to try.<eos> I'm sorry. But it's too late.<eos> Matthew!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'm just tired. That's all.<eos> Who were you out with last night?<eos> A friend.

But it's too late.<eos> Matthew!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'm just tired. That's all.<eos> Who were you out with last night?<eos> A friend.<eos> Yeah, but which friend?
That is Alice's necklace - with the bird.<eos> I recognise it. Lena Garber? She was reported missing in 2008.<eos> That's me and Mummy, in the basement.<eos> I think we should contin...<eos> Come here.<eos> Have you been a good girl?<eos> I had a nightmare.<eos> Is it because of what you saw?<eos> I had to protect us.<eos> Because of the bad men?
And I blame your mum.<eos> But most of all, I blame me.<eos> Because when Alice walked back into our lives, we weren't ready.<eos> We didn't know... ..what to say or how to look after her.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This'll be on your record.<eos> It'll mess up your career.<eos> Will you buy us a pint?<eos> Let's go for a drink, like we used to.<eos> Tomorrow night, just me and you.
You have to put it behind you, my love.<eos> Focus on getting better.<eos> I spoke to Jorn Lenhart, you know, like you said.<eos> And, er...<eos> Sorry, please.<eos> Well, I... I found something.<eos> This is the girl who came back.<eos> This is my daughter Alice.<eos> And the girl behind them is wearing my daughter's necklace.<eos> Remarkable.
- Where are you taking me?<eos> Trust me, come on.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> - This is great!<eos> - Stick with me, kid.<eos> Could I have a beer and a special?<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> You're adorable.<eos> Who are you here with?<eos> - A friend.
So how does change happen, then?<eos> - Or do you not believe in change, either?<eos> - I believe in art.<eos> I believe in... I don't know.<eos> People creating change. I just don't believe in--<eos> If you say "the system," I'm going to scream.<eos> - The system.<eos> - Oh, you're one of them!<eos> - What? A socialist?<eos> - A poet!
They were tough, calloused.<eos> It wasn't like, investment-banker hand.<eos> This guy's blue-collar.<eos> So, a blue-collar guy with a white-collar watch.<eos> Stolen, and I'd hate to be the guy he took it from.<eos> So on a thief scale from charming pickpocket to mean, scary, stabby, that guy was pretty light on charm.<eos> Do you have any more specifics?<eos> Uh, left handed.<eos> Wore his watch on the right arm.<eos> Other than that, not really.
You're not the only one who gets to be married to his job.<eos> Married?<eos> Slow down.<eos> At best, it's just my girlfriend.<eos> For the first time in ages I woke up and knew exactly what I needed to do.<eos> Wear tighter pants?<eos> I nailed The Seven, Dolls.<eos> I can just get the next seven, and the seven after that, and one day they'll all be dead<eos> - and we can party in Cancun.<eos> - With what?
Yeah, I'm your boss.<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> - We need to be careful, alright?<eos> You're not even a real deputy, Earp, come on.<eos> No. I'm just the one with the big-ass gun who sends the fiends of Hell to their deaths.<eos> Technically, it's not the gun that kills them, it's...<eos> Oh my God!<eos> You stupid government lackey, you left me in there with a bureaucratic sadist and I was alone and scared.<eos> - You're not alone, Earp.<eos> - Or a murderer.
You're crazy.<eos> That's all the bones we have, boys.<eos> And I'm afraid the one with the head wins.<eos> I'm sorry, my love.<eos> You will live in your brother.<eos> One is better than none.<eos> No matter how you bring a child into this world, it sucks the life out of you.<eos> Drek.<eos> Your face...<eos> - Who...
You know, I think you've just been dating too many shitheads.<eos> We're not dating.<eos> I know.<eos> God, Waverly,<eos> I would never ask you to be someone you're not.<eos> Good.<eos> Just don't ask me to be anyone.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Well, maybe just friends.
I rounded on your post-ops, got your labs back, filed the intern applications, and picked up your dry cleaning.<eos> They got the stain out of your purple sweater.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Yeah, so, you were right about the appendicitis.<eos> Mm.<eos> All right, DeLuca, you can go get my surgery transcriptions.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Ohh.<eos> Hey, what's wrong with you?<eos> Me?
She was fun, but a little crazy.<eos> "Hoop earrings," maybe.<eos> She was funny.<eos> Tonight is, um, oh, "artisanal soap."<eos> Remember her?<eos> You said she was ditzy.<eos> Yeah, she was.<eos> But she smelled like lilacs everywhere.<eos> Robbins, how many women are you seeing?<eos> Mm, not that many.
And if I do bleed?<eos> Then I have to take you into the O.R.<eos> And try to stop the bleeding.<eos> But if Dr. Grey's right, the surgery could make you worse.<eos> I should have come in sooner.<eos> Do you want to call David now?<eos> No.<eos> I screwed up again.<eos> Who's David?<eos> Your husband?
Oh, good.<eos> Well, hey, have fun.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Have a good night.<eos> Yes, have fun with, um, who is it again?<eos> Oh, um, artisanal soap.<eos> Um, Robbins, you're...<eos> you're an outstanding surgeon.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> And an extraordinary woman.
Then ask her to dance.<eos> You can't object to that.<eos> Not when she's so pretty.<eos> Come along, Frank.<eos> You haven't asked me about my visit.<eos> I suppose Sir Roger was very demanding, as usual.<eos> Yes, he was.<eos> And yet I am fond of him, in some strange way.<eos> We have been through a good deal together over the years, what with one thing and another.<eos> What things?
- Yeah, yeah, I heard.<eos> I heard. - Did you?<eos> Yeah, that's good, man.<eos> I'm...<eos> - I'm proud of you, man. - Yeah, I...<eos> I'm feeling good.<eos> Good. You look good.<eos> So, you interested in your old job back?<eos> - My old job here?<eos> - Yeah, your old job here, asshole.
Yeah.<eos> Sorry, I'm... I...<eos> I don't usually drink in the middle of the day.<eos> It's just, um...<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Eve.<eos> What?<eos> Is it that man?<eos> Who is he?<eos> My ex.
Body art is the most personal statement you can make.<eos> You're writing on your flesh to tell the world something indelible about yourself.<eos> You don't ask another person what that should be.<eos> This Maori tattoo, a boy from New Zealand.<eos> These bougainvilleas, a cousin I lost too soon.<eos> This stupid goldfish, summer theater camp.<eos> I regret nothing, especially my mistakes.<eos> Your bowler hat?<eos> Something touched you so deeply that you wanted a record of it, so you wrote it on your body.<eos> Not in glitter, but in ink. Permanent ink.
Served in Desert Storm.<eos> Didn't come back right.<eos> He'll tell you all about it.<eos> Ma'am, please, control yourself.<eos> You're distracting my customers.<eos> I'm sorry, but it's not healthy to suppress a post-infectious cough.<eos> Better.<eos> So glad to hear it.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am, what about that kid?<eos> Who?
- Come on!<eos> - What?<eos> - Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> - Kid's a walking disease bag.<eos> No different from the rest of these motherfuckers.<eos> I'm just not all that cool about what's about to happen.<eos> You'll learn.<eos> Don't think about it too much, all right?<eos> We're transport.<eos> Just transport.
You said it yourself we need to go back in.<eos> You're the only one crazy enough to do it.<eos> So when you're done being a little girl... you let me know.<eos> Hey, I don't have a lot of time to explain, you're in a lot of danger right now.<eos> - You should come with me.<eos> - Yeah, I'm going home, buddy.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You're Chase Carter.<eos> I know what you saw.<eos> Afterlife.
Drop it!<eos> - What?<eos> Something you want to say?<eos> - Take it easy, all right?<eos> We're not a threat.<eos> - We're just passing through.<eos> - Not yet, you're not.<eos> - You need to know the password.<eos> - I got you your password right here.<eos> Right between my legs.
- You set me up.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Stop.<eos> Relax.<eos> I'm on your side.<eos> I got a story for you.<eos> Couple of years ago, Army decides to start using Zombrex chips as weapons.<eos> So they build a Black Ops site inside Mission City, so they can test them<eos> - and run the program once it's operational.<eos> - Afterlife?
Stop them.<eos> This is Lyons.<eos> I have a priority strike.<eos> The target codename is Eagleride.<eos> Destroy immediately.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Time to target, 15 minutes.<eos> Now this is going to sting a bit.<eos> When we're done, what's the fastest way to the roof?<eos> Fright elevator.
Oh, come on.<eos> - Help me out.<eos> - Be a hero.<eos> I mean, unless you don't think Caroline cares whether Stefan lives or dies.<eos> Where's your girl tonight?<eos> My girl?<eos> Tall, pretty, likes the drinks with the little pink umbrellas.<eos> Or do you have more than one? Oh.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Just... just one.
[Philip] This is Clarence House dining room to Clarence House kitchen.<eos> Dining room to kitchen.<eos> - [Charles] Dining room to kitchen!<eos> - Yes.<eos> Dining room to kitchen!<eos> Oh, bugger it!<eos> Right, check the circuits and up the amperage of the fuse wire.<eos> Right, I'm off.<eos> - Breakfast with your mother?<eos> - And Margaret.
We removed the left lung, sir.<eos> But the right... has fewer, but still significant, blockages.<eos> So, what's next?<eos> Next?<eos> I argued that His Majesty should be told at the time.<eos> A patient has a right to know the full picture.<eos> The theory was that, if His Majesty felt he'd been cured, he could throw himself into his work without undue stress and, and, and worry.<eos> I have two questions.<eos> Who knows the full picture?<eos> Apart from the surgeons?
Abusing these pills can lead to serious kidney and liver damage.<eos> - I'm not abusing.<eos> - Not to mention depression, mood swings, aggression.<eos> Hey, I just banged up my hip a little bit and I just need something to ease the pain, that's all.<eos> How did you injure it?<eos> Tennis.<eos> Yeah, I got real aggressive on my backhand volley.<eos> Old habit.<eos> Did you come in and see someone about it?<eos> For a tennis injury? No.
As a principal shareholder, it befits me to take a more robust interest.<eos> Let's examine my failings once you've delivered our child.<eos> You have a son.<eos> I never thought I'd see the day.<eos> Wheal Grace.<eos> You're suggesting we go into partnership?<eos> Yes.<eos> The Poldarks and Wheal Grace.<eos> My father would be amazed.<eos> At our new engine?

Mr Trencrom sent word today.<eos> And it isn't like Trencrom to raise false alarm.<eos> But who could it be?<eos> Trencrom say it could be anyone.<eos> Do I look distinguished?<eos> Perhaps you should be aiming for severe.<eos> But is that the best way to help Ted, I wonder?<eos> Mighty fligged out for the mine, Francis!<eos> I'm due in court, Aunt.<eos> On what charge?
Perhaps you should be aiming for severe.<eos> But is that the best way to help Ted, I wonder?<eos> Mighty fligged out for the mine, Francis!<eos> I'm due in court, Aunt.<eos> On what charge?<eos> Carrying out my duties as a magistrate.<eos> Come, Master Jeremy, let's have you scrubbed up.<eos> Ross, I don't think you should go.<eos> Ted is one of my tenants and workers.<eos> And a fellow free trader!
Dr Enys?<eos> Someone far more sensible.<eos> And that concludes my evidence, your worship. only to add that I hope 'ee see fit to send these men to the gallows, for how else may we break our shores of this iniquitous trade?<eos> We thank you for your diligence, Mr Vercoe.<eos> You may stand down.<eos> A straightforward case, I think, in the context of the monstrous events still unfolding in France?<eos> I agree with you, sir.<eos> My concern...<eos> Which I share, is how to balance severity of judgment with the appearance of mercy.<eos> The appearance of mercy?
Uncle Ray is angry with me.<eos> I suspect he wants me safely locked away until my marriage.<eos> Which is...to be when?<eos> Who knows?<eos> At any rate, not Unwin.<eos> He jilted me.<eos> Or was it the other way round?<eos> Tell me, who is Dwight Enys?<eos> Is he the strong, capable man that bestrides the sick room or the hesitant one I see here today?<eos> A man with not the smallest fortune.
The day after Christmas.<eos> Do they serve plum pudding in debtors' prison?<eos> Will you take my coat?<eos> I do not feel the cold.<eos> I think you do.<eos> At any rate, you used to.<eos> At any rate, it's warmer than Trenwith.<eos> I must learn to grow a thicker skin.<eos> Can you?<eos> Sometimes.
Captain Poldark.<eos> Seven months away has given me an appetite for such sights.<eos> And doubtless they for you.<eos> I was most grieved to hear of your cousin's death.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We miss him greatly.<eos> He was your partner in the mine, I believe?<eos> Were you able to continue the venture?<eos> It goes on.<eos> Profitably?
Delighted you can join us.<eos> May I offer you some refreshment?<eos> 'Tis most kind of you, sir, but I fear 'twould not be fitting.<eos> I regret to say, I'm unable to give you the satisfaction.<eos> Most unfortunate.<eos> Of visiting me in prison.<eos> You will have to make do with this.<eos> What is this foolery?<eos> Repayment in full.<eos> With interest.
He has his own family to protect.<eos> Then I must appeal for help elsewhere.<eos> Go in through the kitchen.<eos> I must get to the cache.<eos> How? Through the side door.<eos> I have a key. Make haste.<eos> Where've you been?<eos> Upstairs.<eos> How did you get down?<eos> By the back stairs.
Was he killed or did he do the job hisself?<eos> I'm told they had their eye on a bigger prize.<eos> Where is Cap'n Poldark?<eos> I pity anyone who must depend on such a man.<eos> I wonder she does not remarry.<eos> A husband could offer her more protection.<eos> He could. And he will.<eos> What did he bring?<eos> A proposal.<eos> From Trencrom.
Elizabeth Poldark.<eos> And in so doing, will deal the deadliest blow to my bitterest enemy.<eos> I see I must congratulate you.<eos> I congratulate myself.<eos> It's not given to many to achieve so much... at a single stroke.<eos> Sometimes, I don't know my own strength.<eos> What is it?<eos> Sir Hugh Bodrugan... inviting us to a ball.<eos> Obviously, we'll decline.<eos> Of course.
I was beginning to think that you'd abandoned me for the National Council of Sommeliers.<eos> No, I was spending some time at the other end of the cultural spectrum.<eos> Earlier today, I had a rather fruitful tête-à-tête with one of the victimized poker players:<eos> grown man who goes by the name Jimmer.<eos> Oh, you think that's our guy?<eos> He all but admitted to shooting at Ms. Wen.<eos> But it would appear that he is just a trigger-happy pawn for whoever is attempting to frame her.<eos> If that's the case, we should move on to one of the other players.<eos> Hey, what about that missing lookout?<eos> Ian Walker.
See the black powder?<eos> It yielded two very good fingerprints: a right index and a thumb.<eos> Personally, I hate powdered creamer in my coffee, but the residue on your fingers should help give us a very good match.<eos> Look... I hid the camera that night, but I didn't have anything to do with the robbery.<eos> Keep talking.<eos> Camera was to help me cheat.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> I'm a numbers guy.<eos> But not in a way that translates to being good at cards.<eos> At least not good enough.
I'm a little busy right now;<eos> Mateo Peña just turned over footage from the robbery.<eos> I'm about to get a look at the thieves.<eos> Looks like we're about to get a look down my blouse, too.<eos> You don't like me very much, do you?<eos> You're a client. I don't have to like you.<eos> I just have to help you.<eos> Is that, like, the detective's code or something?<eos> You were with him, too, weren't you?<eos> Mycroft?
You're scaring off the wildlife.<eos> I'm entitled to have sex in my own home, as loud as I want.<eos> Well, why don't I call your husband and see what he thinks about your right to loud sex.<eos> Three weeks a month, I don't hear a peep coming out of this place, not a whimper.<eos> Then your husband, he takes his monthly trip to Tokyo and you suddenly get your sushi on, so do me a favor and keep it down, or I'm gonna be forced to call Japan.<eos> Gutterie.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> I'm telling you, Molly and I didn't fight.<eos> We were friends.<eos> Good friends.

Be myself.<eos> Hey, I even learned to love it a bit.<eos> Is that what it's like for my dad?<eos> Always looking over his shoulder?<eos> You know what?<eos> You don't have to worry about your father.<eos> He takes care of himself.<eos> Takes care of himself.<eos> You mean like I did today?<eos> With that man?
Yeah, of course.<eos> Yeah, it's a good thing.<eos> So what do you really think happened with Deeks this morning?<eos> Kensi told us-- car problems.<eos> I don't know. I smell trouble in paradise.<eos> Why do you seem so happy about it?<eos> Ah, this is a teaching moment.<eos> You know, every relationship, slash friendship goes through a rough patch.<eos> Even... Densi.<eos> Interesting.
But Sam and I are about to pay someone a visit who might. All right.<eos> Got it.<eos> Too good! Too good.<eos> One more time.<eos> Maybe make it a little more interesting.<eos> Put some skin in it. Unbelievable.<eos> He even hustles guys on the tennis court.<eos> Supposed to be a gentlemen's game, Arkady.<eos> I've got this smug trust fund bastard by the balls.<eos> Even with my busted arm.
We both know I'm your best shot at getting to Pena.<eos> So you agree to come with me... and I'll tell you where he will be today at 4:00.<eos> It is free country.<eos> Look who I found outside.<eos> I missed my friends.<eos> You missed being the center of attention.<eos> Sam, make sure Arkady stays here and Anna stays in that room.<eos> Where you going?<eos> For a walk.<eos> With you.
Now all we need to do is find evidence proving the connection.<eos> Well, we might be able to help you with that.<eos> We just ran Jared Zorn's blood work, and surprise, surprise-- he also had elevated blood alcohol levels, just like Babish.<eos> Which made us wonder if someone was trying to make them look like drunks who couldn't notice oncoming vehicles.<eos> Which would be pretty smart considering how often coroners close their books when alcohol rears its head.<eos> Yeah, so we dug a little deeper, and it turns out that both Babish and Zorn were drugged.<eos> Alprazolam-- it's a medication that when combined with alcohol drastically increases intoxication levels.<eos> And as I was digging deeper, I went even further back-- to Edward Lamb's blood work.<eos> He, too, was drugged.<eos> Alprazolam every time.
I mean, why, Brock? Why do bad things happen to good people?<eos> Chanel, I'm a surgeon.<eos> We don't do good or bad. We do "can it be fixed, or can't it?"<eos> I think the only thing that's gonna make you feel better is we find that killer and make sure they don't kill again.<eos> That's what we have to do.<eos> Wow. - I'm, like, totally damp right now.<eos> So do you have any idea who that killer might be?<eos> Well, in my experience, it's usually more than one, with a single brilliant ringleader pulling the strings. Hmm.<eos> You have to be a pretty smart cookie to pull all those strings and get away with it, huh?<eos> Ivy League smart.
It's a totally different Isis.<eos> I'm death.<eos> I thought it would be a good idea to get comfortable being really close to it.<eos> Maybe even find a way to love it.<eos> Well, I got to give you props, Chanel.<eos> Actually turning your skin blue for your costume?<eos> That's a real commitment.<eos> I respect it.<eos> Dean Crunch and Munsch, what you supposed to be...<eos> George Washington? Hamilton.
Did you have Lady Lola watched?<eos> Your spy reading her letters, learning their code, forging a letter from Mary.<eos> Your comprehension of espionage is impressive.<eos> You used Lola so that Mary would be tied to the attempt.<eos> So that even if it failed, it would become personal between Mary and Elizabeth.<eos> They're like two spiders in a jar.<eos> They can't coexist, they can't let the other survive.<eos> Still, sometimes someone needs to give the jar a good shake.<eos> I could tell Mary what you've done.<eos> With what proof?
I'll show you through.<eos> My Lady Arabella Gresham.<eos> This is an honour, Lady Arabella.<eos> You're aware that Mary was this afternoon having tea with Beatrice and Miss Oriel?<eos> I do not believe I've congratulated you on Beatrice's engagement.<eos> You see, I must take you into my confidence, Dr Thorne.<eos> You know very well how I worry about Frank.<eos> You are his mother.<eos> And we have all, with your assistance, contrived to separate him from dear Mary.<eos> With my assistance?
Nothing. Never mind.<eos> Higgins, find Murdoch.<eos> Crabtree, take him to the interview room.<eos> Sir.<eos> Look, I didn't know it was stolen.<eos> She can have her tea set back.<eos> 'Course she can have it back.<eos> I'm not interested in bloody tea sets.<eos> - I want to know what you meant.<eos> - About what?
Crawford's right;<eos> If they get involved in this it's their necks on the line as well.<eos> So what do you want with all this?<eos> I'm only interested in the ones for Station House Number Five.<eos> We're looking for businesses targeted with several arrests followed by a period of inactivity.<eos> The end of arrests would mean the start of making payments.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I'll make a list of the businesses I believe are paying.<eos> And I'll pay them all a visit.<eos> Murdoch.
I hear they don't take kindly to that.<eos> Come here to rub it in, have you?<eos> I'm not here to gloat, Tom.<eos> I don't want to see you destroyed over a momentary... lapse of judgment.<eos> My only lapse of judgment was underestimating you.<eos> Yes, but you did and here we are.<eos> Me standing here and you sitting there.<eos> What is it you want, Davis?<eos> I've come with an offer.<eos> An offer?
- Well, I'm sure you have certain expectations.<eos> - Expectations?<eos> Well, I just wanted you to know I am an honourable man.<eos> I don't want to marry you, George!<eos> Well... no, of course not.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Not ever.<eos> I hardly even know you.<eos> And besides, I'm not that kind of woman.<eos> - What kind?
Would you like a croissant?<eos> They gave me an extra at the coffee place.<eos> - Oh, no, I already ate. - Okay, sure. All good.<eos> Yes. Yeah.<eos> Well, here's me, so...<eos> Don't try too hard. It's impossible to respect.<eos> High fours can smell it a mile off.<eos> Just be you. Authentic gestures, that's the key.<eos> - That's time up, I'll catch you later.<eos> Shit!
He's all like, "Uh...<eos> Port Mary is frickin' miles away." Yadda, yadda, yadda.<eos> He one-stars me. Like, thanks, Dad.<eos> - See you back on there.<eos> Are you guys headed to Tranquillity Con?<eos> - You're into Sea of Tranquillity?<eos> - Totally.<eos> I was all set to go. My friend, who is there already, has my costume, but my car broke down.<eos> Well, there's some space in the RV.<eos> - Hi. - Hey!
He one-stars me. Like, thanks, Dad.<eos> - See you back on there.<eos> Are you guys headed to Tranquillity Con?<eos> - You're into Sea of Tranquillity?<eos> - Totally.<eos> I was all set to go. My friend, who is there already, has my costume, but my car broke down.<eos> Well, there's some space in the RV.<eos> - Hi. - Hey!<eos> - You're a Trank head, huh?<eos> - Sorry?
Go on.<eos> She was probably right.<eos> I mean, fuck the planet, right?<eos> Yes, thank you! Come on.<eos> Let's have a little fun here.<eos> You know, fuck the planet!<eos> Fuck the planet!<eos> Anyway... I...<eos> looked up to Naomi pretty much my entire life, which meant she was looking down on me.<eos> Always with a smile though.
And I see this trombone player.<eos> But he's not like the trombone player.<eos> He's like second in a line of 10 trombone players.<eos> You know how hard that guy had to work?<eos> Like since he was fuckin' five.<eos> You know, so if by the time you're five, you haven't decided you want to be the second trombone player of the New York Philharmonic, you're too late.<eos> Like if that's your goal at eight, you're a loser.<eos> You know, so like who's that guy?<eos> Who's the guy the age of five knows he wants to spend his whole life playing the trombone for the Philharmonic?<eos> - David Finlayson.
He told me the truth.<eos> And he arranged for you to acquire the assets needed to complete your mission.<eos> That's right.<eos> Neurotoxin and an explosive device to cripple the engines.<eos> But you didn't act.<eos> At least not right away.<eos> I was in a difficult position.<eos> After the memory wipe you had no way of knowing that you weren't really one of them.<eos> You had to assume they were your partners,<eos> - your friends.
Nothing. No-one saw or heard anything.<eos> So I don't know what a Royal Commission can do that we can't.<eos> Solve the crime, hopefully. Which we are already doing.<eos> (Laughs)<eos> What?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I know that look.<eos> If you've got something to say...<eos> Firstly, thank you for agreeing to be the Royal Commission's Police Liaison Officer.<eos> Pleasure.
Taste Of Cherry. Iranian film.<eos> What did Todd think?<eos> Said he'd been in traffic jams more interesting.(Chuckles)<eos> I told him that was the point. Realism.<eos> Not that Hollywood ending crap, you know?<eos> You're two years into a film course, yeah?<eos> Yeah, but Mum was my first teacher.<eos> Whenever I go back to Tehran, we'll watch films and check out the cinema museum.<eos> She's a filmmaker?<eos> Gynaecologist.
Then I heard about the shooting last night and I thought,<eos> 'God, they killed him for this money and they still want it and I've got it, and I've just I've just gotta get out of this mess.'<eos> And that's why you contacted me?<eos> OK, two questions.<eos> Who's 'they'?<eos> And where do you think that money came from?<eos> How would I know?<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Ms Gibson, did you ever see Todd with a man called George Healy?<eos> Who?
I want to organise another undercover operation.<eos> On Felix?<eos> But this time, we'll use a woman.<eos> Why makes you think a woman is more likely to get him to do what you want?<eos> Says the man who drove back to work to pick up his wife's pedometer.<eos> She's got you there, mate.<eos> Right, I mean, think about it.<eos> No, no, I am, I am. He does like to help girls in trouble, Neil said that.<eos> And you have experience running this sort of operation, so I was hoping...<eos> Sure, happy to.
Are you aware that Karen Parker and a relative of hers made a recent purchase using that card's details? No.<eos> What did they buy?<eos> We'll come back to that.<eos> But how did they get my details?<eos> When did you first tell Karen you were buying a Ferrari? A what?<eos> Your Ferrari 458.<eos> When did Karen first know you'd bought it?<eos> I drive a Falcon.<eos> So you're denying that you bought a Ferrari 458 on the 25th of January, even though we have RMS records that show that the purchase was made under your name and your address.<eos> Yes.
She texted me.<eos> This is really important.<eos> I know that. But you can't make arbitrary decisions.<eos> We don't know where Richard is in that bar.<eos> Girl in the blue, guy in the blazer.<eos> What date - first or second?<eos> What date? Mm.<eos> Solid eye contact.<eos> Mm. Ooh, their knees touched.<eos> Knees?
Mm. Ooh, their knees touched.<eos> Knees?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's gotta be first. Definitely first date.<eos> OK.<eos> Guy in the aqua shirt,<eos> Girl in the... Don't look now.<eos> No.<eos> Girl in the floral dress. Behind you.<eos> Behind me?
Don't we have cameras in here?<eos> Not infra-red.<eos> With no lights, we'd be looking for a black cat in a coalmine.<eos> Can we fix that today, please? Sure.<eos> I sent you a note about the SEC's opinion of Customs.<eos> Got that, thanks.<eos> Um... how was Roger?<eos> As patriarchal as ever?<eos> He tried to pull you down a peg or two in my eyes.<eos> Successfully?
No coulds.<eos> What will work beyond reasonable doubt?<eos> It's got to be simple.<eos> And hard - in your face. - I think he's got to see him in action, not just hear about him.<eos> Any sign yet?<eos> Hey, what's this?<eos> It's OK. It's for the job.<eos> Is it make-up?<eos> Jesus!<eos> Not this time.
Roger Embry's had it in for me for years.<eos> Never forgiven me for turning down his drunken proposition at uni.<eos> Don't forget he's a mate of the Attorney-General. Hello?<eos> What I want to know is how the SCC found out about that text.<eos> Not from me.<eos> Well, somebody found out about it.<eos> Janet, listen...<eos> Don't you have somewhere to be?<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Strong?
Then he knew this... other guy somehow and the next thing I know he's calling up saying, "Can we do a deal?"<eos> If I printed out 100 or so, he'd buy them off me.<eos> And you said...?<eos> I told him to piss off and grow up.<eos> I wasn't about to become an arms dealer.<eos> I love my country.<eos> OK. And what about the night of Australia Day?<eos> Alright.<eos> Yes... ..I was at home.<eos> With Robbie.
They signed the consent form, they paid the bills.<eos> Legally, this embryo has always had standing as property.<eos> Ash Larsson left her property to Ms King in the event of her death.<eos> As such, this embryo belongs to the respondent.<eos> And what does Ms King intend to do with this embryo?<eos> Your Honour, as it's her property, my client's intentions are irrelevant.<eos> Very well.<eos> The court will take a short adjournment to consider its judgment.<eos> Things are going well then?<eos> With the girlfriend?
Least I can do for a wine connoisseur.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You driving?<eos> Yeah, I was going to. But, well... I'll get a cab.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> So... ..tell me about the coffee business. Mm.<eos> Well, it's not the most exciting profession.<eos> People make it bearable.<eos> Just bearable?
Like when he looks into the light, he sneezes.<eos> Folds his arms left over right.<eos> We can tell that from DNA?<eos> There's a lot we can tell with an 80%-90% likelihood.<eos> But often you have to combine the mutation with environmental factors to know if it's activated - I've only skimmed the headlines.<eos> There are pages here.<eos> It is the whole genome, with over 70 listed mutations.<eos> Which is about average.<eos> Wheredoesthisleavefreewill?<eos> Beyond my brief.
You know, they're not...<eos> They can't eat it with their hands.<eos> Off you go. I just need to...<eos> Owen.<eos> What's happening?<eos> I stayed at Boccaro's house, followed him across town this morning. And?<eos> He's having a champagne breakfast.<eos> Celebrating?<eos> You'll never guess who with.<eos> Our Heather?
Ties to the jurisdiction, 40 years old, no prior convictions, not even a fucking parking fine.<eos> I'll do daily reporting.<eos> Now should I be granted bail?<eos> Where were you during the 90 minutes you weren't at the Commission on the afternoon George died?<eos> Meeting with Patrick Boccaro about his tender for the netball courts.<eos> Well, they claim he's a co-conspirator, so an alibi from him has little value.<eos> But true, nonetheless.<eos> And the night the Royal Commission was robbed by someone using your passcode?<eos> I was with Dale Cardy.<eos> The... the footballer?
Why would she kill Janet's partner?<eos> Her name never came up in the investigation.<eos> What about cases? Janet's old cases?<eos> That's what I mean.<eos> We went through those.<eos> OK, Vickers.<eos> OK, in early 2012, Janet was asked to advise in a claim of alleged historical sexual abuse by a drama teacher.<eos> The victim was a Nathan Vickers. Who's that?<eos> The brother?<eos> Husband.
I'm sorry, but we're fully booked today.<eos> And gosh, we may not have enough in stock for you two.<eos> Lapd.<eos> We'd like to speak to joseph yu.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Um, just wait one minute, and i'll get dr. Yu.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> i wonder if she's being completely truthful.<eos> Mike, would you like to do the honors? Ah.<eos> With pleasure.

Like 30 grand.<eos> All those online purchases made on adrian's credit cards Might be these guys trying to get back in the black.<eos> -That's quite a bit.<eos> -Not really.<eos> We're not really worried about it.<eos> Adrian won three tournaments this year.<eos> All right, so he's down, but we stake a lot of horses, Which reminds me, we got to talk to that guy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know.<eos> And the other one about the --

This is a formal investigation.<eos> Itlookslike my gun.<eos> I usually keep it in the nightstand.<eos> Anyone else know where you kept the weapon, ma'am?<eos> Why would you need to know that?<eos> Well, i hate to tell you this, ms. Harris --<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Call me gloria.<eos> Andyouare again?<eos> Lieutenant.
- Jeff Dellinger, a C-list Edward Snowden.<eos> Shh!<eos> Let's not joke about that, please.<eos> Gentlemen, hello.<eos> I'm Alicia Florrick, this is Lucca Quinn.<eos> We're representing Mr. Dellinger's interests.<eos> There are no interests.<eos> This is purely a jurisdictional issue.<eos> Then you have no interest in Mr. Dellinger?<eos> Purely an interest in your jurisdiction?
Connor Fox is gonna say that Peter ordered someone to lose those bullets, and it's more likely that he leaned on the lead prosecutor than some lab tech.<eos> That I will not say.<eos> Anything else I should know?<eos> Just that people change.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> - Ah, it's just an observation, I...<eos> I think I know people... even well.<eos> You talking about someone in particular?<eos> Does Peter Florrick have any reason to be concerned about you?<eos> Me?

Seriously?<eos> Hello, Diane, Mr. Lee.<eos> Are you with PGT Ballistics?<eos> I am PGT Ballistics.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, the name gives me more gravitas.<eos> - Holly Westfall.<eos> - Hey.<eos> So, you're a competitor of Mr. McVeigh's?<eos> More of a friendly competitor.
There's no telling how many other weapons are in that bag.<eos> Or what he plans to do with them, which is the bigger question.<eos> I mean, is there any sign that he robbed this place<eos> - after he shot up the cameras?<eos> - Uh, no, sir.<eos> It looks like our nutjob just wanted what was in his car.<eos> Okay.<eos> After he unpacked his vehicle, did he just leave it behind?<eos> And if so, how did he get out of here?<eos> - The Uber?
- that Chris accepted...<eos> - That's a showbiz website.<eos> ...the role of Gold Storm and was being repped by CUA, one of the largest talent agencies on earth.<eos> That's how I found out that Chris dumped me and his mother... by reading it online.<eos> CUA... a bunch of crooks.<eos> You're lucky not to be in my industry.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Here it comes.<eos> Actually, I'm a consulting producer on "Badge of Justice."<eos> - Sean: With Jon Worth?
The captain wants to know if Ms. Walker knew about the Very Vanilla.<eos> Could you tell us a little about Chris' diet growing up?<eos> I see that you've read that trash that Larry Bass calls a book about Chris' early career.<eos> Yes.<eos> I watched what he ate.<eos> And he booked every job he went up for because he looked so young.<eos> He was able to play 15 when he was 18.<eos> Do you think that really would have happened if he was a little fatso?<eos> Is that why he was mostly subsisting on vanilla smoothies?<eos> Very Vanilla.
You love to say "I told you so."<eos> - It wasn't me.<eos> - Okay. A little.<eos> Stop, okay?<eos> Just stop.<eos> We know you bought the oxycodone to put in Chris Walker's protein powder.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Oxy?<eos> - In the vanilla powder?<eos> - Very Vanilla.
You're more beautiful than your pictures.<eos> That is very sweet of you.<eos> Would you like to buy me a drink here first, or do you want to go on up to your room?<eos> Are you even old enough to drink?<eos> Almost.<eos> But you would be surprised what I've learned to get away with.<eos> Or maybe I can show you?<eos> You know, I think going up to the room, is an excellent idea.<eos> Great.<eos> After you.
I had a checking account.<eos> Well, um, these ATMs had something else in common, sir.<eos> Both had been serving customers who were robbed at gunpoint by two white men disguised in baseball caps and fake beards.<eos> And, um, well, we were wondering, since you were in the vicinity, if you might have witnessed either of them.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> You think that I'm an idiot?<eos> The statute of limitations ran out on 1986 robberies years ago.<eos> But there is no statute of limitations on murder, asshole.<eos> So where were you February 15, 1986, between the hours of 9:00 P.M. and 12:00 A.M.?<eos> With my girlfriend.
Tell us who his Aryan shot-caller is.<eos> During their investigation, the Pasadena police... They asked for Dr. Bowman's services in order that "through analyzing the methodology and potential motives of these homicides to locate and/or identify a suspect."<eos> Is this an accurate description of the job that you were asked to perform, Dr. Bowman?<eos> In brief, yes. - Huh.<eos> So, before we met at the behest of detectives, you had compiled an imaginary portrait of my... my... My upbringing?<eos> My character?<eos> I speculated on your personality.<eos> By lumping me in with a lot of other people?<eos> Not a lot of other people, Dwight.<eos> A lot of other murderers.
Stop, stop.<eos> Dwight was talking to Dr. Joe with a deputy present in the room.<eos> What deputy?<eos> Did he note his name? Uh... no, ma'am.<eos> Well, if it was deputy Simms, that's a big coincidence.<eos> - Why do you say that?<eos> - We haven't searched his house yet, but we did get through his computer at work and his e-mail account.<eos> Simms was having an affair with another clerk of the court.<eos> What?<eos> Who?
What's a Chanel?<eos> Duh. Us. We're Chanels.<eos> You like money, right? And telling it like it is?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> It's done.<eos> Congratulations. You're a Chanel.<eos> How long would it take you to run a full sprint?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Like if a grown man was chasing you with a big stick that's shaped like a knife but made out of metal?<eos> So, a knife?
I take small planned steps, like an arthritic dog.<eos> Really?<eos> The last listing is a loft downtown.<eos> Bad area.<eos> The ad just says it's "sunsoaked and beige-y."<eos> I don't know. They seem like three nice girls.<eos> And now I am marrying one of those girls and totally freaking out about it.<eos> You know who you need to talk to, right? - Yes.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Winston.
How's our cheerleader?<eos> Well, there's no sign of a bleed.<eos> It looks like a mild concussion.<eos> What if it ends?<eos> Then I'm the woman who dated the pretty boy and it all fell apart.<eos> We done here?<eos> Who will take me seriously then?<eos> I'm... I'm supposed to take you seriously right now?<eos> I'm a very serious person!<eos> Incredible.
Have you, uh, ever been hunting?<eos> Course not.<eos> I'm a pacifist.<eos> Hey, do you know a place that sells game hens?<eos> No.<eos> Seems like a British thing to know.<eos> No big deal.<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> Well, I, uh, I have plans tonight with, uh, with friends.<eos> What friends?
Course not.<eos> I'm a pacifist.<eos> Hey, do you know a place that sells game hens?<eos> No.<eos> Seems like a British thing to know.<eos> No big deal.<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> Well, I, uh, I have plans tonight with, uh, with friends.<eos> What friends?<eos> - Other friends.
Oh, my God.<eos> You two know each other?<eos> We met in college.<eos> How long has it been?<eos> - The parents of this... - Yeah. They were just completely...<eos> So, um... what sort of work do you do? - Botany.<eos> - Oh. Wow.<eos> That's so interesting.<eos> Do you work outdoors all the time?<eos> Sometimes.
Right now, neither one of our feelings matter.<eos> Given that blast of magic, there's only one person not present who's powerful enough for something like that.<eos> Gold. He's got the Olympian crystal, or part of it, anyway.<eos> Some of it must have survived.<eos> I can still feel the aura from it.<eos> Yeah, you're not the only one.<eos> He used it to cast a tethering spell.<eos> Tethering spell?<eos> What was Gold attaching the crystal to?<eos> Storybrooke's magic.
One of Robin's books.<eos> He must have brought it with him from Storybrooke when he came here.<eos> I know because I gave it to him.<eos> It's a collection of this world's legends about Robin Hood.<eos> He used to laugh at everything they got wrong.<eos> What is it?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> It's a letter from Robin to me.<eos> He must have written it when he was trying to make things work with Marian.<eos> Or your sister.
Last time, you wouldn't even talk to us.<eos> That's because the Warden was watching me.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> If you really want to help us, prove it... open those bloody bars.<eos> I can't.<eos> His orderly, Poole, keeps the key with him at all times.<eos> I might be able to get the magic you need... if you'll make a promise to me first.<eos> Tell us. Anything.<eos> When you leave this place, promise you'll take me with you back to your home.<eos> To Storybrooke?
Clinical stubborn...<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Here's what we got.<eos> We know Alice Sands is the sole shareholder of New Brunswick Woodworks.<eos> And now we've tied New Brunswick to several other companies that are doing cross-border business.<eos> What took so long?<eos> Well, Nina was in the middle of working on it when... she went to the wedding.<eos> Did we get the info to the Canadian drug authorities?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And the DEA.
I guess I could be a bit more... empathetic.<eos> - Couldn't we all?<eos> - You're very empathetic.<eos> People have used a lot of words to describe me.<eos> I'm not sure that was ever one of them.<eos> Yeah, well, they don't know you, do they?<eos> But I do sometimes wonder what kind of a doctor I would have been.<eos> - I mean, to live people.<eos> - A great one.<eos> Brilliant even, if somewhat overdressed.
- Hey, Jane!<eos> - No.<eos> All right. I'll catch you later then.<eos> Unless that's Bass, you got a suitcase from Ma.<eos> She told me it was meant to complement my personality.<eos> Mine is covered in leopard spots.<eos> The leopard is incredibly intelligent and astoundingly strong.<eos> They are elusive, secretive, and beautiful.<eos> - I'm sorry you're a turtle.<eos> - Tortoise.
Do you get punched a lot?<eos> Not as much as you'd think.<eos> Okay. I'm ready when you are.<eos> I hate endings.<eos> The truth is I hate beginnings, too.<eos> I like middles, the steady sameness, comfortable forever.<eos> But I guess I've been doing this long enough to know you don't always get to pick when life changes.<eos> So... I know I have no choice but to embrace this, and I'm gonna make it the best version of a next step that I can.<eos> I'm gonna miss you.<eos> All of you.
Hey, look who the cat dragged in.<eos> The fuck you been?<eos> Um, work.<eos> Thanks.<eos> There's leftover chicken.<eos> Franny's sleeping.<eos> Think we should call Bill?<eos> We even have his number?<eos> Who's Bill?<eos> Your Granddad.
Kev went to go see that lawyer you used about suing, but he said it'll take years.<eos> The Alibi is yours, not Svetlana's.<eos> It's not right.<eos> Where's Carl?<eos> Wasn't he coming?<eos> Yeah, I texted him the address.<eos> Isn't she here illegally?<eos> You were never legally married to the bitch, right?<eos> She was already married to her dad.<eos> Yvon.
! - A tongue tearer.<eos> Okay, well, that seems completely necessary.<eos> - Medieval birth control.<eos> - Just don't go out, and then you don't need birth control!<eos> Or you can call Martinez.<eos> No.<eos> - You really think so?<eos> - Definitely.<eos> Okay, I'll call Martinez if you ask Kent out.<eos> - Wha...

Hope.<eos> Wait.<eos> Could we take a tour now? Oh, no.<eos> You're... you're going out to see your friends.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I can go see them later.<eos> Then right now is. Perfect.<eos> Hey, what's you doing in here.<eos> Jane asked to meet her here.<eos> - Me too.
Overdose.<eos> Well, there was a needle mark on the back of his neck, which was the injection site for the same cancer drugs that he was using on his patients.<eos> His heart stopped within seconds of being injected.<eos> Who would have access to those drugs?<eos> I requested an inventory from the hospital, but in the meantime, I'm running tests on another theory.<eos> You're not gonna tell me the theory, are you?<eos> - No, not until the tests are complete. - Oh, Maura!<eos> I've got to go.<eos> I'm having drinks with Samantha.<eos> Samantha?
I might never know why, but, oh, well.<eos> We can't always have the answers to our questions, can we?<eos> I look forward to reading your first novel.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, keep the change.<eos> This storm doesn't let up soon, I'm buying a bigger boat.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Any luck running down the fired employees? Uh, yeah.<eos> They all alibied up.<eos> Uh, what about the contractor?
Well, you made a great sales pitch.<eos> Promised him I wouldn't let you turn into a pumpkin.<eos> Okay, well, have me home before midnight.<eos> [Chuckles] Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Hey. What's going on over there?<eos> Don't know.<eos> She's been at it all morning.<eos> You looking for a new job?<eos> Oh, no, just going over current events.<eos> With a highlighter?
And you used an ultra-flocked swab?<eos> Like I've done a thousand times before.<eos> Kent, are you trying to say that the test was inconclusive?<eos> Mm. - Maybe a little bit too conclusive.<eos> - What does that even mean?<eos> Well, it means that our test didn't return - one DNA profile from our victim's body.<eos> - It returned five.<eos> I ran a sketch of our victim through facial recognition, but it returned 10,000 possible matches.<eos> - Any one could be our guy.<eos> - Or our guys.
Maybe he tossed it when he was running from the scene.<eos> He could have.<eos> How's she doing? Oh.<eos> I don't know. She's been very quiet.<eos> Our victim and Edward have nothing in common.<eos> But starting about a week ago, there's a series of calls between them from their business phones.<eos> Why would a big investment fund go to a small accounting firm with one accountant?<eos> They might not have.<eos> Our victim, Michael Steele, was a forensic accountant...<eos> a whistle-blower.
- We need to check with the FBI firearms database.<eos> - I did.<eos> This specific steel laminate was used by one gunmaker...<eos> Bercotti, between 1911 and 1912.<eos> There are fewer than 40 of these rare shotguns still in existence.<eos> Did you also find out who in Boston might own one? Ah.<eos> That's where I pass the baton.<eos> That'syourjob, Sergeant.<eos> I'm happy to share if you like.<eos> Another time, maybe.
I mean, I just never considered that you being safe would... mean moving 500 miles away.<eos> 343... nautical miles.<eos> It's 7 hours and 7 minutes via route 15.<eos> Well, that's still really far for a cup of coffee.<eos> When is this happening?<eos> There's still a lot of details to work out... my... my background check, things like that.<eos> I haven't told BPD.<eos> I just, you know, wanted you to know.<eos> My daughter, the FBI agent.<eos> I-Instructor.
Sam and I are usually the only ones who go in there.<eos> It upsets most people.<eos> Wait... Are you asking me that because you think I had something to do with this?<eos> I did not hurt my brother.<eos> We said good night, and I went bowling.<eos> That was the last time I saw him.<eos> We'll need you to confirm that.<eos> Of course.<eos> You should talk to that woman he's been seeing.<eos> What woman?
I had anxiety attacks for years afterwards.<eos> Please understand we're not trying to be insensitive, but it is important that we speak to your father.<eos> Dad retired shortly after my mother passed.<eos> We're actually in the process of selling the estate.<eos> He doesn't really see anyone anymore.<eos> Just a few questions.<eos> Dad wouldn't know anything about Walter Sokoloff's death.<eos> They barely knew each other, and that was decades ago.<eos> Even so, we need to speak to him, and we also need to speak to William and to Garrett.<eos> My brothers?
- We didn't find any in the house.<eos> - Maybe the killer took them.<eos> I'll give Mary a call.<eos> Maybe she knows something about it. - Thanks.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Hope you win your vacation.<eos> You failed to mention that Agent Davies was in town.<eos> - It was just dinner.<eos> - And dessert.<eos> Actually, two desserts.

You know, Jane, it's your sarcasm I'm gonna miss most of all.<eos> But actually, you're not far from wrong.<eos> We're performing a vacuum metal deposition test on the dress.<eos> The VMD technology's only been available in the past few years.<eos> VMD has the potential to lift prints from surfaces that were impossible to analyze at the time of the murder.<eos> - Like fabric.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Now, first, we will expose the dress to an aerosol of evaporated gold.<eos> - Real gold?
Donna, where's Harvey?<eos> I need to talk to him.<eos> He's finishing up a negotiation.<eos> - This can't wait. - Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I got up there and they turned me away.<eos> No, that can't be.<eos> I got you on that list. That's not it.<eos> They turned me away because he got into a fight.<eos> - What? With who?
Guns, drugs, delicious potato salad that'll go from lips to hips in five seconds.<eos> You know what?<eos> They have a chapter here in town.<eos> Bet it started with ex-servicemen.<eos> We make a pretty good team.<eos> - We should get t-shirts.<eos> - Don't push it.<eos> You got a sec?<eos> Yeah! Anything for Purgatory's finest.<eos> Other than me of course.
I hope my sisters made it out OK.<eos> - Don't worry, we'll find them.<eos> - No, I'll find them.<eos> You get something that will turn the townspeople from rabid, drugged-up assholes back into regular assholes!<eos> - Get her!<eos> - I'm sorry about this.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Me too.<eos> What? ! AAARGH!<eos> - Antidote?
Doc!<eos> Doc!<eos> Doc!<eos> It's OK, love.<eos> Go on.<eos> Willa.<eos> Respect your elders, bitch!<eos> Wake up and remember who the hell you are!<eos> - You're Willa Earp!<eos> - And the rightful heir!
Did you get the town coordinates?<eos> When we're out of range, tell control to go in hot.<eos> Tomahawks, the whole she-bang.<eos> Boom.<eos> You did aces, Wynonna.<eos> Careful now.<eos> We all know how good<eos> - you are with that thing.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> No revenant.
Here I thought it was Bring a Monk To Work Day.<eos> Is that my shirt?<eos> Is it?<eos> So how did you guys end up down here?<eos> We were emptying the Recu when the Black Rain started so we had no choice.<eos> Called in the evac and we went underground.<eos> Then our batteries ran out.<eos> A few of the crystals still had light.<eos> That's how we stayed safe.<eos> From what?

Yeah, it got in there somehow after the storm.<eos> Must release spores carried by the wind.<eos> Hey, I got Lucy sealed.<eos> But we could be breathing this stuff in right now.<eos> I don't know it'll grow on your lungs.<eos> Probably.<eos> Yeah, well, what about growing in our brains?<eos> Maybe Paolo came down with a bad case of moss-head.<eos> Great. Remind me to send Turin a thank you rock.<eos> - Careful with this, guys.
- Let's move.<eos> - Come on.<eos> The cut on your stomach wasn't deep.<eos> And the antibiotics are taking down the swelling in your hand so that's the upside.<eos> We should have checked you for bites. We never should have left you alone.<eos> I'm okay now, assuming the five of you are real.<eos> Kidding.<eos> What's the downside?<eos> Well, for starters, I don't know what to feed my new pet mossipede.<eos> Monk.
Let me know how this goes down.<eos> And hey, be careful.<eos> Yeah, you bet.<eos> Other women have had guides who were just as experienced but none of them survived the bite, physically, or mentally.<eos> What is it about you, Elena Michaels, that makes you so special?<eos> It is very skilled work.<eos> We Folded a Mutt into our Pack.<eos> He was a counterfeiter.<eos> He made that.<eos> With this.
Deep breaths.<eos> Just gonna take a quick pause.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I know, I know, I know.<eos> Okay, I need you to go out with her again and tell her that is all just too soon and let her down easy. Please?<eos> That would be perfect.<eos> Please?<eos> Okay, I'll do it.<eos> But under one condition.
This attack fits the bill.<eos> Random or not, this is an assassination of two of our own.<eos> The Iraqi police can do as they please.<eos> I want an investigation.<eos> We'll repatriate the bodies, you and your team will handle anything in-field.<eos> Director, there's something else.<eos> The scene was a mess.<eos> Those bullets had to be carrying quite a bit of speed.<eos> Shot from a distance.<eos> And with extreme accuracy.
Got into a little battle with an old toy.<eos> Well, what else is in your storage unit?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I told you, I like details.<eos> Uh, you know, just old stuff.<eos> Agent Bishop here is a cleaning machine.<eos> Yep.<eos> Lightning speed.<eos> Yeah, but don't you want to enjoy it?<eos> The cleaning?
Excuse me?<eos> I told you, I like details.<eos> Uh, you know, just old stuff.<eos> Agent Bishop here is a cleaning machine.<eos> Yep.<eos> Lightning speed.<eos> Yeah, but don't you want to enjoy it?<eos> The cleaning?<eos> No.<eos> The memories.
Well, it's all about family, right?<eos> Gibbs, glad you're here.<eos> I've been dying to tell someone.<eos> What, Abbs?<eos> Well, I contacted MusiCorps to see if there was anything I could do to help, and I started talking to Crouse.<eos> Crouse is in the band, and Crouse is amazing.<eos> He invented all these gadgets so that other wounded warriors can play music instruments, and I am helping him with this one.<eos> Well, what is it?<eos> It's a percussion instrument made out of a guitar, so a soldier that's lost his legs can play a full drum kit.<eos> With his hands.
And then I realized, yes, it is personal to me, and to every single one of us.<eos> Because the principle at the core of the United Nations is that all peoples, regardless of race, color or creed, deserve to live lives of peace, free from the tyranny of sudden violence.<eos> The challenge before us is enormous.<eos> But the struggle begins with words.<eos> That's why I'm here today to ask for your solidarity and your resolve in condemning this organization and everything it stands for.<eos> Shoulder to shoulder, we can bring the sponsors of terror to a swift and lasting justice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Incredible speech ma'am.<eos> Thanks, Matt.<eos> Even with the changes.
Maybe if you got off that iPad and did a little work, things would go faster.<eos> Maybe you just need to wait your turn.<eos> And I'm not a nurse.<eos> Handled like a true pathologist.<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> My Match Day, I threw up six times and passed out, so I'd say you're doing fine.<eos> You did not throw up and pass out.<eos> Wanted to, though.<eos> Was emergency medicine your first choice?<eos> My only choice.
- Country strong.<eos> - He's got jokes. Pretty boy's got jokes.<eos> - These are my uncles.<eos> - Fellas. I'm Billy, this here's my baby brother Bob and that there is Wade.<eos> All right, good.<eos> Billy, Bob, and Wade.<eos> Tell you what, man, this is the best gift from an agent yet. - Oh.<eos> - You doing right by me, Justin.<eos> No, no, not for you.<eos> Careful with that.
Okay, stop it, stop.<eos> You don't have to list them.<eos> Sorry.<eos> The hope is that I will be able to prevent future tragedies... save the lives of agents by putting myself in harm's way in their place.<eos> - To kill?<eos> - No.<eos> I am incapable of that.<eos> I will protect.<eos> I will serve as a decoy target, a safeguard...<eos> - ...a shield.
- I'm in! - Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> Slow your roll!<eos> - Great talk. - Yabba-dabba. - Are we in a...<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> - I'm not pregnant.<eos> - Nope. You are jealous. - Jealous of what?<eos> You heard him!<eos> He lives on nine!<eos> What are we?<eos> Friends, boss/employee,
China gets cold, so why don't you take that with ya?<eos> I love you.<eos> He told me that he loved me. I felt nothing.<eos> I'm glad you came by. I don't think we finished our con...<eos> Josh... it's you.<eos> Stop, stop, stop!<eos> I can't take this, okay?<eos> I quit!<eos> - Josh, I really wanna be your chef.<eos> - Girlfriend.
I love you.<eos> He told me that he loved me. I felt nothing.<eos> I'm glad you came by. I don't think we finished our con...<eos> Josh... it's you.<eos> Stop, stop, stop!<eos> I can't take this, okay?<eos> I quit!<eos> - Josh, I really wanna be your chef.<eos> - Girlfriend.<eos> Chef. Yes.
- Okay, thank you.<eos> Hey, Grant.<eos> Kids' party?<eos> New beginnings.<eos> Remember, we talked about this?<eos> I think it's gonna be great.<eos> No, no, no, I'm not some glorified rent-a-clown with a guitar.<eos> Okay, all right, all right.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> But under one condition.
Hey, Grant.<eos> Kids' party?<eos> New beginnings.<eos> Remember, we talked about this?<eos> I think it's gonna be great.<eos> No, no, no, I'm not some glorified rent-a-clown with a guitar.<eos> Okay, all right, all right.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> But under one condition.<eos> What?
...to protect the injury, to prevent infection, to save the patient from further suffering.<eos> The hard part comes when you have to rip the bandage off because that can hurt like hell.<eos> Hey, how's it going?<eos> Uh, pretty good.<eos> What's up?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Have you talked to April?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Nothing.
Almost done?<eos> Anastomoses look terrific on both sides.<eos> No bleeding or leaks.<eos> Sats look great.<eos> Yeah, nice work.<eos> Well, uh, that does it for me, unless you need me to stay and help... in any way.<eos> I'll close. You can go.<eos> Scalpel.<eos> So, what's wrong with the guy?<eos> - Huh? - Thorpe.
No, please stay!<eos> Something happened to you, and now something has happened to Meredith, and I think that we should all just sit down and talk about it, all right?<eos> Can I use bleach in here?<eos> There's something we use under the sink.<eos> I can show you.<eos> Yeah. We're taking Ashley up to C.T. now.<eos> Torres would like you to join.<eos> I'll be there in a few more minutes.<eos> I almost killed her.<eos> With our sex.
She was having a play date with my daughter, and they were running around, and she tripped.<eos> Landed on a rock.<eos> I brought her right in.<eos> She's okay, right?<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> I am Dr. Blake.<eos> I'm Sofia Sloan-Torres.<eos> I know.<eos> I work with your mom.<eos> Your moms.
Oh, that is... not okay.<eos> That is what I said.<eos> I said, "Get out of here, and you take that thing with you."<eos> How big could it have been?<eos> Okay, can we not?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, wow. Nope, nope.<eos> That's...<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Dr. Torres?
Come on, Bailey.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey. I just wanted to see you.<eos> So... I could apologize, you know, face-to-face.<eos> About the other night, I am sorry.<eos> It...<eos> I was thoughtless.<eos> And I don't know why I I don't have an excuse.<eos> Amelia, Riggs said some things to me, and it just...<eos> And..
What's all that crap?<eos> I'm helping Fiona with the bills over at Patsy's.<eos> Place is in a financial shitstorm.<eos> Yeah, the Alibi, too.<eos> Svetlana's getting things in order, which makes me the house husband.<eos> I keep forgetting about the weird situation you got going on with the two wives.<eos> It's not weird. It's modern.<eos> You're gonna have to draw me a Venn diagram to explain how that works.<eos> What's up with mopey? Ah, boy trouble.<eos> Girl trouble.
But once my parental rights are terminated, you can no longer use the Gallagher family name.<eos> Hallelujah!<eos> I'm just gonna be like Cher and go by Fiona.<eos> Here's your shit.<eos> I'm taking my room back. And I'm padlocking the house.<eos> Aw, you made me toast.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Buh-bye, got to go to work. You can't get rid of me that easily.<eos> Has she talked to anybody about what happened at the wedding?<eos> - Not to me.
Got your penis chopped off.<eos> Now you're a lady.<eos> Not that you were that far off to begin with.<eos> See you around, Bruce Jenner.<eos> Hey, Bruce Jenner was the dude, so fuck you guys.<eos> Thanks for the compliment.<eos> Don't listen to them.<eos> Okay, I think you're manly for what you did.<eos> And when the 72 hours and one second is over, I'm gonna loosen your belt, then take off your pants... - No.<eos> - Then your underwear.
In case you haven't noticed, Sean's not here anymore.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Yeah, that's too bad.<eos> - Game Change, please hold. Phillip.<eos> Tito.<eos> - Senior intern.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Nice to meet you. All right, follow me, I'll show you around.<eos> Uh, you can start by getting coffee for the Three Musketeers.<eos> - Who? - The owners, Phillip.
Justice Horace Gray delivered the plurality opinion.<eos> Show-off.<eos> All right, tomorrow, each of you will get a chance to present a defense that keeps Karim in this country.<eos> Now, I'll pick two of you for first and second chair.<eos> But be careful.<eos> Winning means that you carry the fate of this entire family in your hands.<eos> And you wonder why people think I favor you? Wait.<eos> You aren't at all concerned?<eos> About what?<eos> - The flier.
Sam, what song will you sing?<eos> No, I'm sorry. I'm working, sir.<eos> Do you like Broadway show tunes?<eos> Of course, who doesn't?<eos> Which is your favorite?<eos> Oh, there's so many good ones, it's hard to choose.<eos> Yes, tonight, we will sing them all.<eos> All right.<eos> To our American friends.<eos> Gun bae!
Wait. Wait. Wha... what do you know?<eos> More than you.<eos> If you wish to learn what's been happening to you, you know where to find me.<eos> Pongo! Hey! What are you guys doing here?<eos> Well, I heard you were out looking for new arrivals, and I thought maybe, uh... maybe you want some coffee.<eos> My parents sent you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, they... they're a little worried about you, Emma.<eos> T-They thought it might be easier for you to talk to...<eos> A cricket?
Relax.<eos> I totally got this.<eos> Welcome to Lucky Dragon herbs and remedies.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Surprise safety inspection.<eos> FYI, sir, he's holding out a badge that says Department of Safety and Health and he's got a serious look on his face.<eos> Very serious look.<eos> Okay. But why two inspectors?<eos> Uh, because he is my trainee...<eos> Trainee.
Glass of ice.<eos> You want anything in that glass that I can charge you for?<eos> Just ice.<eos> You're not busy, eh?<eos> You kidding me?<eos> Three people in here at the same time,<eos> - it's a stampede.<eos> - You the owner?<eos> I am the sole proprietor.<eos> One employee, me.
Worked for Rasputin.<eos> Actually, it didn't.<eos> That's true.<eos> I wasn't sure you would come.<eos> The house is empty.<eos> It's just you and me.<eos> You fight to defend your Pack as though they are your family.<eos> They are.<eos> And now, your world has blown open.<eos> Antonovs, and Navikevs.
Everyone's gone home.<eos> I just want you to know that I know for a fact that those STD tests were manipulated in some way.<eos> I mean, there's no way I have sexual Ebola or vaginal Zika.<eos> I doubt if those things are even real.<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> Tests don't lie.<eos> Well, they do if someone named Dr. Dean Jealous Gray Pubes manipulated my blood sample.<eos> Please. All I want is to go to Blood Island with you and rock your sexual world.<eos> I mean, I know you've been with hundreds of girls...<eos> Thousands.
Because I don't want your spirit.<eos> I want your body.<eos> It's not about that.<eos> Then what?<eos> Your husband came home yesterday morning.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What?<eos> Look, whatever he said, whatever he did, it has nothing to do with us.<eos> I just don't like coming in the middle<eos> - of something.
You start.<eos> David Lee is hazing Lucca.<eos> He's got her doing a pointless 50-state survey to complete overnight.<eos> Yeah, he did that to me when I started.<eos> You, too.<eos> Yes, but Lucca was my partner.<eos> And when you convinced me to come back, I convinced her.<eos> Now I have a favor to ask you... Sure.<eos> Don't side with Diane.<eos> With what?
She was a good witness.<eos> The jury believed her.<eos> I know, so how can we undercut her?<eos> I can argue that Peter was being diligent, but that doesn't undercut the crime lab failure.<eos> Could you go after her reputation?<eos> I don't think she has an issue with the Disciplinary Commission.<eos> Go to motive.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - No one else heard Peter reject the search of the crime lab.<eos> Only Geneva.
And she will be the stoic spouse.<eos> And if he doesn't go to prison? She'll divorce him.<eos> And which do you want?<eos> Because here's something you don't seem to understand about yourself.<eos> You may play the game of being this hard-bitten... or is it hard-boiled?<eos> One of the hards.<eos> When you, in fact, have fallen in love.<eos> Tell me it's not true.<eos> And I'll leave you here drinking.<eos> All by your lonesome.
Is that true?<eos> Yes, Counselor, that is true.<eos> It's also true that I micromanaged this case.<eos> Guilty.<eos> But that's what you should want from a state's attorney.<eos> Someone who won't accept excuses for a failure to Mirandize or allow for bad evidence collection.<eos> Someone who loses bullets?<eos> - That was just a mistake.<eos> - You say that you have worked hard every day to make up for the indiscretions of the past... but we have evidence that you were having a longtime affair<eos> - with not only a fellow prosecutor...
But with the other woman... the nasty woman... the sex is...<eos> Well, it's still good, but it's nasty.<eos> Not listening.<eos> The things she does, Abby... the vile, awful things...<eos> the biting... Okay. This is harassment!<eos> It's starting to affect my work.<eos> I'm zoning out all the time. I'm forgetting important details.<eos> How is the Attorney General of the United States supposed to do his job when he's in some weird, dirty sex trance?<eos> You stop seeing her.<eos> - Which her?
It's my pleasure.<eos> So, what does your schedule look like for the rest of the week?<eos> Hey. Just wanted to thank you for clearing the President's schedule.<eos> Oh, it was nothing. What you should really thank me for is convincing him not to do Hollis' accent.<eos> I heard him practicing in the Oval. It was dreadful.<eos> Is this... - Does this belong to...<eos> - Oh, it's David Rosen's.<eos> He stops by, complains about the difficulties of juggling his women.<eos> At first I thought he was trying to make me jealous... I'm sorry.<eos> "Women"?
I get that, but I...<eos> But what?<eos> You've played dirty before?<eos> Poisoned a few arrows?<eos> Of course you have.<eos> But that was always at the expense of someone you loathed.<eos> You were Robin Hood, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.<eos> This would be different. This would be hurting someone you respect, someone who is innocent, someone who has never done anything to harm you.<eos> You'd no longer be Robin Hood, Olivia, you'd be...<eos> You.
Good evening.<eos> And welcome to the first Republican presidential debate.<eos> Before I invite the candidates onto the stage, I'd like to go over some of the ground rules.<eos> Have you seen David?<eos> He needs to be in makeup if he's going out on-stage at the end...<eos> I broke up with David.<eos> You what?<eos> I already told the press that he would be our on-stage.<eos> He was cheating on me. So...<eos> With...?
If I did, I'd have to stuff it in my mouth every ten minutes.<eos> So I can't do that impression.<eos> Okay, he is exaggerating.<eos> I don't eat that much.<eos> So, what's going on?<eos> Are we done here?<eos> What about the case thus far makes you believe the victim may have been murdered?<eos> Finding a body in a landfill, that's, uh... that's pretty suspicious. I mean, sometimes it's murder.<eos> But sometimes it's just a vagrant who had the misfortune of taking shelter in the wrong Dumpster at the wrong time.<eos> No, not this time.
- Thank you.<eos> So, we didn't have any luck cross-referencing the victim's injuries to hospitals, so either he lived out of town or he traveled a lot.<eos> Perhaps we should widen the search geographically.<eos> I mean, his list of injuries is quite extensive.<eos> Fractured foot bones in '04, broken collarbone in '08, broken wrist in 2011.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Is this guy... what, is he six-two, 220, brown hair, athletic?<eos> That's correct.<eos> - I think I know who this is.<eos> - What? No way.
He said he was gonna to confront her, but... after he did, I never heard from him again.<eos> The fractured mandible and the missing mandibular central incisors are documented hockey injuries.<eos> The sharp force trauma on the inferior margin of the C6 was clearly caused by the powerboat propeller.<eos> The contusions on the occipital and parietal bones are from banging against the abutment in the Anacostia.<eos> There's also the comminuted fracture on the occipital.<eos> It appears to have been obscured by the bruising caused by the abutment.<eos> The severity and placement of the blow would have been powerful enough to knock Lang unconscious.<eos> Precisely, but before he was drowned in the cold tub.<eos> If you're not engaged in a childish video game<eos> - with Dr. Hodgins...
Dr. Brennan.<eos> It's an honor to finally meet you.<eos> Oh, I imagine it is.<eos> You're certain that Henry was murdered?<eos> - Without a doubt.<eos> - Which means it was somebody from your expedition.<eos> Anyone have a problem with Henry Charles?<eos> No, there was no friction whatsoever.<eos> Our group was a finely tuned machine comprised of top scientific minds.<eos> With one exception.
So you figured you'd turn the Yawner Party into the Donner Party.<eos> Only, Henry Charles caught you adulterating the bones.<eos> So you killed him before he had a chance to expose you as the fraud you truly are.<eos> Do you have any idea how hard it is to make a name for yourself in archaeology?<eos> So I faked a few details.<eos> - That does not make me a killer.<eos> - Right.<eos> Henry Charles just happened to disappear right after he threatened to expose your scam.<eos> Sometimes you get lucky.<eos> Not this time.
Yeah, sure, but i mean, after all that, That was part of my escape, you know, into old movies.<eos> Most people, they watch those movies, they want the thieves To get away with the heist.<eos> Me, i always, Always rooted for the cop.<eos> You know, or whoever was trying to stop them.<eos> You're like a kid in a candy store with this.<eos> Just remember, we're trying to catch a killer here.<eos> Well, hey, you think of it as going after a killer;<eos> Me, i'm playing to catch a thief.<eos> That's a movie.<eos> Cary grant.
Perfect gentlemen, right, Wearing ski masks, and that didn't strike you As odd when you buzzed them in?<eos> Well, i-i wasn't buzzing them in.<eos> There was an older man, moved quite slowly.<eos> When i released the lock, the thieves came Out of nowhere.<eos> You think the old man was in on it?<eos> No, no, he's a regular.<eos> I think they just waited for the right moment.<eos> What else can you tell us About these, uh, "perfect gentlemen"?<eos> The bigger guy, He spoke with some kind of european accent.<eos> Maybe spanish?
neither did henri.<eos> Were you sleeping with him?<eos> No. So, if you're not sleeping with him, You're not stealing with him,<eos> Then how did all of that money get into your account? I'm afraid i'm not gonna answer that question.<eos> Maybe you wanted to be the next marquise de chaussin, So you got rid of the last one.<eos> I told you.<eos> We weren't having an affair.<eos> She was.<eos> The marquis would never Say anything-- it's against his nature to create a scandal-- But his wife was the one having an affair.<eos> With whom?
Really. And it is all thanks to you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The guy who wrote the check, the guy who just guaranteed we can keep Haven up and running for at least the next five years, he is a friend of yours.<eos> Who?<eos> Morland Holmes.<eos> He... he is a friend of yours, right?<eos> Yeah, that's a good question.<eos> You're the new guy.<eos> And for the new guy, every day here starts the same way.<eos> At least in the winter.
So, I... I gave him my blessing.<eos> So this was written less than a week ago.<eos> Right, well, the first time we met, I told him I had one condition-- that he needed to take steps to protect himself.<eos> So I gave him some money to buy body armor.<eos> After that, I'd send him a little something whenever I could, you know, just to keep him safe.<eos> Look, I... really wanted to tell you guys about this yesterday, but you have to understand, if Sandy finds out that I did this...<eos> You'll lose your job?<eos> Well, more than that.<eos> Working here at Superlative, it's, like, my last connection to this character.<eos> And my grandfather.
How?<eos> Tell me.<eos> What must I do?<eos> Mary Sibley... bring me her blood.<eos> What are you doing in my chambers?<eos> I came to find my Lord, to see what I might do for you.<eos> I have no need of you... for now.<eos> Now feed it to me.<eos> No.<eos> From your lips.
What are you doing in my chambers?<eos> I came to find my Lord, to see what I might do for you.<eos> I have no need of you... for now.<eos> Now feed it to me.<eos> No.<eos> From your lips.<eos> Brother, who is your opponent?<eos> Who else?<eos> Our Father?<eos> Surely not.
Out.<eos> I am here to fulfill the promise of your existence.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> When my father took on a suit of flesh, he required two Marys... one to birth him and one to love him.<eos> But I need only one Mary.<eos> You.<eos> My mother and my bride.<eos> And then we shall rule, not this New World, but all worlds.<eos> You will not be the queen of Salem, but of the universe.<eos> An immortal.
He has plans for me, plans I cannot imagine you would favor.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Firstly, answer my question, and I will tell you what I know.<eos> Do you have a spy within my hive?<eos> Who is it?<eos> That I do not know.<eos> Samael meets with them alone.<eos> And now I have made this small betrayal, it is your turn.<eos> He wants me to be his Queen, a Goddess, which would make him...<eos> God.
I have earned my reward and my vengeance!<eos> Indeed, you have.<eos> And all shall be as we agreed once you arrange this one last matter.<eos> One more?<eos> And then another and another and another.<eos> I've served you because it was to our mutual benefit.<eos> But you make me a pact here now.<eos> I will do one last errand for you, and you will deliver on all your promises to me.<eos> And how shall we seal our pact?<eos> In blood.
You know, send me that raw footage, will you?<eos> I should've come by sooner, but so much has happened since...<eos> I know exactly why you're here, Mellie. So just stop.<eos> Don't insult me by lying to my face.<eos> You want the truth, Andrew?<eos> You didn't choose me.<eos> You chose him. Fitz.<eos> I wanted to be with you. I wanted to start a new life with you.<eos> That's what we both wanted, or at least I thought it was until you said we could be friends.<eos> Friends?
No more talking.<eos> Is he dead?<eos> - You said he wasn't dead.<eos> - He's out. - He should come to in a few minutes.<eos> - Liv. We didn't have a choice. Liz North asked Huck to kill him.<eos> Get away from me! Get away from me!<eos> Get away from me!<eos> Where are we?<eos> A-Are we in the White House?<eos> Under the White House.
Two Christmases we now have had you home with us, Princess<eos> Alice, two Christmases since the river sprites carried you ashore to us.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> I do, Daddy Horace.<eos> They rescued me.<eos> What was it they rescued you from, my princess of the<eos> The fire on the water, Daddy Horace.<eos> Yes, and who did they rescue you from?<eos> Who did he say he was?<eos> My father.
What was it they rescued you from, my princess of the<eos> The fire on the water, Daddy Horace.<eos> Yes, and who did they rescue you from?<eos> Who did he say he was?<eos> My father.<eos> But he was lying.<eos> He was always lying.<eos> Because he did not want me to know who I really was, to know that I was a princess.<eos> And who was he?<eos> The wicked King.
Uh, well, stay calm.<eos> Uh, we're home, we flew in last night.<eos> Oh. Come on. She's gonna want to talk to Luke.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> I'm coming to you from West Virginia.<eos> What are you girls doing today?<eos> Oh, you know, me and Alex just out shopping.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Dad.
Oh. Come on. She's gonna want to talk to Luke.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> I'm coming to you from West Virginia.<eos> What are you girls doing today?<eos> Oh, you know, me and Alex just out shopping.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Dad.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> - Mom. - Mom.
Lydia.<eos> Figured we should get to know each other since we're the only women here.<eos> Oh, there might be more.<eos> We're not the only recruits testing today.<eos> - I'm Alex.<eos> - Alex Parrish.<eos> You're not someone who ever has to introduce herself.<eos> Why do you even have to go through this?<eos> You're a shoo-in. Yeah, well, depends on what "This" entails.<eos> Physical, personality tests, polygraphs, and a psych eval.
Guilty people.<eos> Smart people.<eos> So lay out your entire case to me right now or every attorney I know will drop everything and come help me.<eos> We got a tip from a source.<eos> And it was very convincing.<eos> Antonia Slade.<eos> No, not Slade.<eos> All right, we're recording with Peter Lewis, aka Mr. Scratch.<eos> Do you swear under penalty of perjury that the testimony you are about to give is the truth?<eos> Most certainly.
But I'm different.<eos> Do me just one favor.<eos> Before you make any decision...<eos> Meet my team.<eos> They're the only family I have outside of you and Joy.<eos> I walked away 30 years ago.<eos> I'm not walking away this time.<eos> Please.<eos> Stay.<eos> On one condition.
How are things on your end?<eos> You know, fortunately Jack doesn't remember a lot about Haley's death.<eos> He knows the story, but he was young.<eos> That's a good thing.<eos> That's a very good thing.<eos> But he's not going to forget seeing me at gunpoint.<eos> I just don't want this job to take anything else away from him.<eos> Well, maybe it gives him something, too.<eos> You're his hero.<eos> Not a pretend hero, a real hero.
Forceps won't be needed after all.<eos> Now, I've been researching some logistics.<eos> Most people spend their Christmas Day afternoon watching Billy Smart's Circus and eating Quality Street!<eos> How have we ended up discussing a mission to South Africa?<eos> Because God moves in a mysterious manner, even on major public holidays.<eos> I have work to do here, Shelagh, in Poplar.<eos> Patrick, London is full of locums and that vaccination programme needs a doctor.<eos> Our own son had polio once.<eos> Also, if we cut down our time away by flying instead of sailing...<eos> By flying?
Come on!<eos> That's it!<eos> It's all right.<eos> You clever, brave girl!<eos> You have a daughter.<eos> FRED CHUCKLES See?<eos> I see her! I see her!<eos> You can have your cuddle in a minute, Nurse Buckle.<eos> What do you reckon they're going to do with this?<eos> What, the afterbirth?
Sister Edith has gone down with vomiting and diarrhoea.<eos> Her, too?<eos> And I've quarantined Sister Gertrude, so that she's only working on the affected ward.<eos> I'd say it's going to be all hands to the pump, but under the circumstances that's just a really tactless pun.<eos> We'll have to ration the amount of water that's used on laundry and, with enteric fever going round, that's going to be difficult.<eos> The best thing we could leave behind is something that goes on working after we're gone and that means Hope Clinic, which means Doctor Myra.<eos> I might have found a different diagnosis.<eos> If I'm right, she's in with a chance.<eos> A good chance?<eos> A slim one.
No.<eos> Damn.<eos> Kidnapped?<eos> Tell me about the last time you saw her.<eos> We, uh, got in a fight.<eos> About money.<eos> So she went to work.<eos> - And by work you mean?<eos> - Ruby went on dates, with guys.<eos> - This guy?
He was everything to me.<eos> Now I have nothing.<eos> You, um... you have your life back.<eos> And I think you're a very brave woman.<eos> Sergeant, this inventory thing Platt's got me doing... we seem to be missing a maroon Jeep.<eos> Seized on a narcotics bust?<eos> I know it was rough today.<eos> What you guys did makes us all proud to be part of 21.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> About the baby?
Now I have nothing.<eos> You, um... you have your life back.<eos> And I think you're a very brave woman.<eos> Sergeant, this inventory thing Platt's got me doing... we seem to be missing a maroon Jeep.<eos> Seized on a narcotics bust?<eos> I know it was rough today.<eos> What you guys did makes us all proud to be part of 21.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> About the baby?<eos> About everything.
You'll put that thing to use sooner or later.<eos> (SCOFFS) I may as well cut it off and use it as a spare thumb.<eos> Hey, will you be my boyfriend? Er... (CHUCKLES) Sorry.<eos> Will I...?<eos> I need you to be my boyfriend now.<eos> Oi, you there. Please?<eos> Ah, yes. Yes. Sure.<eos> Are you an animal rights dickhead who's lobbing tomatoes at the area?<eos> Excuse me, Officer.<eos> Tomatoes?
I mean, sorry.<eos> That's what you say when people kiss you?<eos> Thanks or sorry?<eos> Historically, yes.<eos> (BOTH CHUCKLE) You guys bailed us out?<eos> Of course.<eos> You took a beating for us.<eos> Yeah, I mean, we managed to get in a couple of good punches,<eos> I'm just gutted I couldn't do the whole naked protest thing.<eos> Another time, maybe? Yeah.
Are you sure you're a virgin?<eos> Cos you seem to know what you're doing. Sh!<eos> What was that? Oh, nothing.<eos> The flame just went out.<eos> What?<eos> The sacred flame went out. Mm.<eos> Is that going to be a problem?<eos> The flame's gone out! The sacred flame's gone out! The flame's gone out!<eos> What do we do now?<eos> The window. Quickly.
All right. See you at work, I guess.<eos> Yeah, see ya in a few.<eos> Crap.<eos> She gon' come sit with us?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Okay. Well, I just wanted to let y'all know that Trey Willis is getting out on bond today.<eos> Why would you need to tell us that?<eos> I know there's been a lot of talk around town in regards to what Trey did or didn't do.<eos> As far as killing George?<eos> Among other things.
Country Club?<eos> My tailgate?<eos> - The usual suspects?<eos> - Same old Paulie.<eos> Well, uh, um...<eos> Probably a bad idea.<eos> I always try and keep a few of those handy.<eos> Why not?<eos> I could, uh, use a beer, frankly, before going back to Mother's.<eos> - Tonight?
Jenny Paar said he leases a jet.<eos> That's just wrong.<eos> Like a baby Lear or something.<eos> Jenny was my best friend in seventh grade.<eos> Yeah, I remember y'all were tight.<eos> She talk shit about me like we're talking shit about Dustin?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> I won't say your name never comes up in conversation, but everybody's name comes up at some point or another.<eos> Like my brother's.<eos> Sometimes... especially lately.
I don't collect wounded animals, if that's what you mean.<eos> - You like being around danger?<eos> - Are you dangerous?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Mostly to myself, rarely others.<eos> That's useful information.<eos> Look, I don't have myself completely figured out yet, so I... I can't ascribe a clear motive to my every action and desire.<eos> But I can say that I'm not looking for a longtime companion... or a sex partner, for that matter.<eos> - So, you're looking for a platonic fling.<eos> - With a straight man, preferably.
Headless, too, if possible.<eos> It is nice out here.<eos> Just bein'.<eos> What was that?<eos> Might be a deer rutting'.<eos> Little early, but...<eos> You are not gonna shoot a deer, are you?<eos> It's not deer hunting season yet.<eos> Not with guns, anyway.<eos> Hatchets?
I know that, too, Teddy.<eos> It just frightens me, your anger.<eos> I'm not angry, I'm upset!<eos> You don't need a husband.<eos> You need a saint.<eos> Okay, we probably went too far.<eos> They want me to see somebody.<eos> Who does?<eos> The New Canaan Project... people.<eos> What kind of somebody?
What?<eos> I mean, I thought we could...<eos> Negotiate?<eos> Shit, Jeff, I can't match that 'cause I can't sell you another $100 in paper towels, Lucky Charms, and women's stuff.<eos> See, that's their genius, right?<eos> Look, I believe in supporting local merchants.<eos> I don't even want to shop at those big-box stores.<eos> Me neither, and I go to Sam's Club.<eos> I'm as big a hypocrite as you are, Jeff.<eos> Shit, maybe worse.
I don't know details about them, but... but I don't think they were together,<eos> you know, like... like in love with each other.<eos> But I am grateful for my mama, for having me.<eos> For seeing that part all the way through.<eos> And that was her gift to me, I think.<eos> Sometimes...<eos> I get... I get this kind of memory of her.<eos> But more like she was a-a feeling or an experience rather than a... than a full-on person.<eos> Zeke?<eos> Like, sometimes I...
Why don't you keep that plaque?<eos> Don't look like nobody else gonna want it.<eos> Maybe I will.<eos> You're a good girl.<eos> You say your prayers, you'll be all right.<eos> That's what Mr. Zeke used to say to me.<eos> Bye, now.<eos> Bye.<eos> It must be inspiring being here.<eos> Sometimes.
I don't think it's just a mother's slant.<eos> He is... special.<eos> I'm glad you took a chance on him, even if you are going away to have your baby.<eos> Speaking of direct.<eos> Daniel has adopted that approach with me today, so I'm taking his cue.<eos> Do you think he'll make it?<eos> What does that mean, Janet, to you?<eos> Will he ever be happy?<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Sometimes.
You don't have to do this by yourself.<eos> I know the two of you well enough to understand why you came when I said not to.<eos> I've made my decision.<eos> The answer is no.<eos> Jeremy, we understand the risks.<eos> But surely...<eos> If you're arguing with me, Clayton, you don't understand all the risks.<eos> The only way to ensure that there's no blowback is for me to kill Roman alone.<eos> And that's why you two will take care of Roman's hitman.<eos> With pleasure.
I know you're always scared, you're never feeling safe, you're never sure what's around the next corner.<eos> What if all that could be different?<eos> How?<eos> You mentioned Montreal.<eos> I can...<eos> I can help make that happen.<eos> You'd do that?<eos> Yes!<eos> But not if you let me die, standing here chained to...<eos> this damn thing.
Wow, your mouth has been open forever.<eos> Okay, this is crazy.<eos> I'm just gonna stay home.<eos> - No, Cece, you have to go, please.<eos> - It's... it's... - Okay. - I'll be fine.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> I can help with wedding stuff. Just lighten the load a little bit.<eos> Sometimes I think I was bred in a lab to help people.<eos> You know what else they bred in the lab?<eos> Pugs.
I bet this shred scraped off when the two cars collided.<eos> Can you tell me what the bumper sticker says?<eos> Based on a shred that's 3.2 millimeters long?<eos> No.<eos> Ooh, you have something else, don't you?<eos> I do.<eos> And you know that because you saw my spectrophotometer.<eos> Visible light is measured in nanometers.<eos> That's a billionth of a meter; it's very small.<eos> But with this machine, my...
Based on a shred that's 3.2 millimeters long?<eos> No.<eos> Ooh, you have something else, don't you?<eos> I do.<eos> And you know that because you saw my spectrophotometer.<eos> Visible light is measured in nanometers.<eos> That's a billionth of a meter; it's very small.<eos> But with this machine, my...<eos> Spectro...<eos> Spectrophotometer.
Tony I.D.'d the woman from his apartment.<eos> And McGee and I have a theory on who killed our dead impersonator.<eos> Okay, go.<eos> Senator Shawn Kelly.<eos> I hope you have evidence.<eos> Circumstantial, but it's overwhelming.<eos> All right, walk me through it.<eos> Well, the extortion e-mails that Dead Tony sent to Senator Kelly refer to his quote, "military secret""<eos> Kelly was an officer in the Navy?<eos> A lieutenant.
You made a promise, Brooke.<eos> Maddoxes keep their promises.<eos> Do you really want to get into this family's legacy of lying and breaking promises?<eos> I am going to spend the rest of my life apologizing for my mistakes.<eos> I'm trying to make up for them.<eos> Brooke, what could possibly be more important?<eos> Do you really want to know?<eos> I'm going to see my boyfriend...<eos> Jake.<eos> Yeah, that Jake.
The whole thing was too much too fast and you were totally falling for her.<eos> That's why you cheated.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Your mother and I just didn't want to see you make the same mistakes that your sister did.<eos> Listen, I have some papers I'd really like you to take a look at.<eos> My medical situation...<eos> Have you ever gone on a road trip? Just by yourself?<eos> Nope.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Mm-mm. Okay, what about camping?
She's texting back.<eos> It's a dot, dot, dot.<eos> This is riveting.<eos> Don't you just love talking about other people's text messages?<eos> She says to ask... ask Harry.<eos> Mm, competition. Even better.<eos> See?<eos> Someone's been listening.<eos> Not to you.<eos> Oh, please.
Neither one of us want Aria to look foolish, right?<eos> Like she let herself get talked into something that she didn't want.<eos> You mean Aria's character.<eos> Yeah, her character.<eos> I'm here to protect this book.<eos> And that means protecting the authors.<eos> Both of them.<eos> Protecting from what?<eos> A loss of perspective.<eos> Poor judgment.
- Miss Drake.<eos> I saw you in here, and I thought I'd ask about your friend.<eos> About Hanna.<eos> How is she?<eos> Uh, she's, she's alright.<eos> Has she told you any more about what happened to her?<eos> No.<eos> No, not much.<eos> I have to tell you, I don't feel especially good about the other night.<eos> What about it?
So do you make it a habit of inserting yourself into other people's homicides or just ours?<eos> Torching the car would have been a bonehead move.<eos> Why?<eos> It would've gotten rid of blood and fingerprints.<eos> An abandoned car, scorched in the middle of woods tends to raise some eyebrows.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where did you get the windshield fixed?<eos> At a place that won't ask questions and doesn't give answers.<eos> More importantly, what'd you do with Rollins' burner phone?<eos> What burner phone?
Yes, in theory, but we have no idea when she's gonna be back.<eos> Or where she is.<eos> That was Lucas.<eos> He said he's not with Hanna.<eos> They never had plans to meet in New York.<eos> Where the hell is she?<eos> She wanted to turn Noel in last night and we didn't listen to her.<eos> Okay, but if she was gonna go to the police on her own she would've done it already.<eos> Maybe she's with Mona?<eos> Or Caleb.
Nicole Gordon, one of the 15 American aid workers that went missing from the southwestern region of Colombia three years ago, has been found alive..<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> So you thought that you could leave without saying goodbye?<eos> You know I hate goodbyes.<eos> I do.<eos> Is Yvonne in the house?<eos> No, she, um she went to go pick up some more boxes but I thought you were supposed to be on lockdown.<eos> - I'm with a cop.<eos> - Former cop.
Let's not go crazy.<eos> So Angela, what People readers really want to know is what is it like juggling a successful acting career and raising this little girl all on your own?<eos> Oh, well, starring in a show is great, but being a mom is the greatest role I've ever had.<eos> Angela: I can't believe I'm gonna be in People Magazine.<eos> Thank you again for sharing your incredible story.<eos> You are an inspiration to women everywhere who are raising a baby on their own - and starring in a TV show. - (Elevator dings)<eos> Jess: It's a small demographic, I know.<eos> But who says you can't have it all?<eos> Oh, and I hope you get even with that deadbeat dad.<eos> "Deadbeat dad"?
Also, you sleep in a water bed next to a giant air conditioner.<eos> This must be a lot to take in.<eos> Maybe you should go home and take a rest on your water bed and we can talk about this later.<eos> Thank you, Number Three.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> I didn't give him all the results.<eos> According to the testing, not only is Dr. Cassidy Cascade more likely to want to be in the front during spooning, he's also a psychopath.<eos> And his most likely profession... is serial killer.<eos> Wait, so this means that... Cassidy might be...<eos> The Green Meanie.
Why don't you come in?<eos> Oh, I-I'm so sorry. I've just... Been in every fabric store in a 50-mile radius, and...<eos> Maybe you can tell me where someone might've gotten that?<eos> Follow me.<eos> Aah! Midnight green velvet pleather.<eos> Very exotic.<eos> So you've seen that fabric before?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I've made several interesting costumes with this fabric big, scary ones.<eos> With a green mask and horns.
Yes.<eos> I will try.<eos> Sir, my crew has had a couple run-ins with these pirates.<eos> In fact, two of my sailors were gravely wounded during a swarm attack.<eos> You don't need to remind me what they're capable of.<eos> We don't always get to choose our allies.<eos> So we're willing to do anything?<eos> Get in bed with anyone?<eos> Like I said, we're gonna finish the job.<eos> With all due respect, sir...
Keep your hands up!<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> I see.<eos> This was never about your guilt or innocence.<eos> You forced our hand here, Captain.<eos> There was a moment today... where I actually had my doubts.<eos> Thank you for removing those for me.<eos> When the chips fall, if I'm proven wrong, I'll face justice from a higher power than you.<eos> Cooper, Green, please remove the officers and sequester them in Helo Bay 2.<eos> Gladly.
Er, one or two hours?<eos> All right.<eos> Love you.<eos> Shit!<eos> Marcella Backland.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> You're meeting up with Peter Cullen, aren't you?<eos> Why are you interested in Peter?<eos> His name's come up as part of an investigation.<eos> What investigation?
- Never.<eos> No.<eos> But it says here that she followed you into the backyard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And then she yelled at me to stop.<eos> And when I turned around, she knocked me down.<eos> Then she stole my phone and wallet.<eos> Right.<eos> How far away was she when she... when she yelled?<eos> Right behind me.
Are you out of your mind?<eos> Did you tell your neighbour?<eos> I thought if I told you I'd lose custody, that you'd take her away.<eos> Well, we'll have to find her before we can do that, won't we?<eos> Eyewitness saw a man in a dark hoodie carrying a little girl through the estate.<eos> DS Backland.<eos> I've got the footage outside the flat.<eos> - Oh, my God, May.<eos> - What's he doing with her?<eos> And the other angle...
Andrew Barnes was murdered.<eos> He was against the original plan.<eos> Murdered?<eos> If it went through now it might raise unnecessary questions with the public.<eos> - Sure, I'll send the new plans along.<eos> - Good.<eos> - How did Jason react to the news?<eos> - Henry, just do it.<eos> You don't think he had anything to do with it, do you?<eos> With what?

The victim was having an affair with your husband.<eos> Giving someone everything, only to find out someone else can do it better.<eos> They just throw you away.<eos> Come on, Juliet.<eos> I moved the body.<eos> I didn't...<eos> Morning.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I'm your friend.<eos> Your best friend.
Marcella Backland broke into my office and stole it actually.<eos> Yes, I got Matthew a job at DTG.<eos> Therefore it's very useful for me to know when he's away.<eos> Where is Matthew?<eos> You thought France, if I remember correctly.<eos> Let's take a break.<eos> Marcella, you really messed up.<eos> Everything is ruined.<eos> He's going to get bail.<eos> Bail?
I'm genuinely very sorry about that.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I think you killed all of them easily.<eos> It's not easy.<eos> The first one, Carol Fincher, I... I almost couldn't do it.<eos> It's all about crossing that line.<eos> Well, you know.<eos> We found Matthew. And released Yann.<eos> We got him, Marcella.<eos> Mm, but at what cost?
Um, there's something I've been wanting to tell you.<eos> Oh, great, well, you know, I'd like to start if you don't mind.<eos> - No, I'll go first.<eos> - That's fine. You were such a lifesaver to me through the whole Phil nightmare.<eos> I don't know how I would've gotten through that without you.<eos> Oh, well, you know, look, okay, well, here... here's the thing.<eos> - No, there's something else.<eos> I put Gordon away.<eos> I don't need him anymore. 'Cause you, Todd, you're my new dummy.<eos> Your new... the new du... your new dummy?
Does my frankness shock you?<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> I love you, Grandmother.<eos> It's a changing world, my darling.<eos> Let's see how many changes I can accommodate.<eos> Perhaps suggest that to Father.<eos> - Bye!<eos> - Publish or perish!<eos> How do you feel about it?<eos> The book.

You are a lady, a member of Australia's squattocracy.<eos> I have a contract here for a different work entirely, to be written about your world by someone who's lived in it.<eos> There's a signing fee and guaranteed publication.<eos> You could be the next Henry Handel Richardson.<eos> It's a generous offer.<eos> But, of course, if you wish to seek advice...<eos> You're not interested in what I've written.<eos> Your talent, yes. Your subject matter, no.<eos> You must remember it wasn't that long ago we were fighting the dagos.<eos> Dagos.
Truth?<eos> We'd all buckle under the weight of that.<eos> Me most of all.<eos> You want the truth?<eos> James isn't Georgie's father.<eos> But you said...<eos> I didn't give birth to him.<eos> After my first attack, I interfered, to try to force my values, my increasingly outmoded values, on you all.<eos> My motive was love. The outcome was unfortunate.<eos> So this time, I...

The outcome was unfortunate.<eos> So this time, I...<eos> I want to use my reprieve to see you all happy... happily yourselves.<eos> I like this new grandmother.<eos> I do too, rather.<eos> And what about you?<eos> Mr. Goddard?
Mankind is his creation.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> It's not like he invented the Prius, which actually works.<eos> I don't have to tell you people what a mess mankind is.<eos> The Salem Witch Trials Third Reich Twin Towers.<eos> And, sure, every once in a while, He'll send down a little plague to straighten them out, but it's nothing permanent.<eos> Humanity brought us Hiroshima and got a redo.<eos> I merely questioned His priorities, and I got the boot.<eos> He said you're evil.<eos> Incarnate. E-Evil incarnate.
Same address that I lived at on February 17, 1985, and January 27, 1985, and May 1, 1985, and every other date that you've asked me about.<eos> Could you please repeat the address?<eos> 2824 DePue Drive, Richardson, Texas.<eos> And did Mr. MacMillan visit you at your residence at 2824 DePue Drive on July 30, 1985?<eos> Yes.<eos> And how did he know that you lived at said address?<eos> Because he had been there before.<eos> And why had he been there before?<eos> Because we were business partners.<eos> And friends?

She has to lie there taking it, wondering what the hell she did to have your stinking breath in her face.<eos> Or, wait, maybe I was wrong.<eos> Maybe the big boss isn't the one taking it.<eos> Hey, Jesus Christ, Joe. We had the son of a bitch locked and you had to-- Had to what?<eos> We sell security software to the government. Hey, wait. Come on, hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey. It was great hanging out with you last night.<eos> Mm-hmm. ( keyboard clacking ) - Can I just--<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> Sure.
Yeah, um, my... My dad works there, too.<eos> - He's a detective.<eos> - Yeah, I see him sometimes. I don't really know him, but I, you know, - see him in passing.<eos> Um, well, thanks again.<eos> I guess you're my hero today.<eos> Glad I could be there for you.<eos> You know what? Uh, would you wanna get a coffee?<eos> I mean, I know you're having a coffee right now.<eos> I meant, like, you know, at a different time.<eos> With me.
While you sit around and hide like a lost, lonely little boy, letting someone else risk their life to protect the city, our common enemy is coming for us both.<eos> What common enemy is that?<eos> Time.<eos> It's already screwing with you and everyone you love.<eos> And pretty soon, it's gonna take me right down along with you.<eos> Wow. You know, you've got some nerve.<eos> I'll give you that.<eos> Warning me about messing with other people's lives.<eos> You... you know the whole reason I did this is because of what you did to my life.<eos> To my family.

Um, uh, CSI. You know, so I just, uh...<eos> Put it together.<eos> So what I don't know is how you got your speed.<eos> Oh, okay, so before I went on the straight and narrow, I used to drive illegal cars. - Uh-huh.<eos> - I was messing around with a new nitro formula to get my engine revving faster.<eos> Then one night, I'm racing in a thunder storm, my car get struck by lightning.<eos> And it must have mixed with the formula because... boom!<eos> I was in a coma for nine months.<eos> Then when I woke up, I was the fastest man alive.<eos> The Flash.
I can tell from the "I don't believe you" looks on your faces that you don't believe me.<eos> We believe you're a speedster, but you're gonna have to explain that part about Flashpoint again.<eos> All right, look.<eos> This is as simple as I can put it.<eos> I'm gonna use this glass, Mr. Ramon. - Okay?<eos> - What?<eos> Imagine that this line is time, okay?<eos> I went back in time, stopped the Reverse Flash from killing my mom.<eos> In doing so, I created an alternate timeline, a whole new existence where you're Kid Flash...<eos> - The Flash.
That's just bad advice. 'Cause I'm the answer man.<eos> I am the answer to all your prayers.<eos> All you need to do is ask me, Barry.<eos> We need to go back in time. To that night.<eos> To do what?<eos> You know what I need you to do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I want to hear you say it.<eos> I need you to kill my mother.<eos> With pleasure.
- Atomic.<eos> - About to be placed aboard a Nazis submarine.<eos> This is no time for subtlety.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Let's make sure we all follow the plan.<eos> Let's just get this done.<eos> Step away from the lady and the bomb!<eos> Final warning!<eos> Schnell!<eos> Toten sie!
You see, my partner wants to move on to other things.<eos> But your partner isn't here, is he?<eos> According to who?<eos> Hello, Eobard.<eos> Mr. Darhk.<eos> Ah, how'd it go with Einstein?<eos> Good, until someone gives the Confederate Army machine guns or breaks Mozart's fingers, or...<eos> One aberration at a time.<eos> Hey, remember that thing that I said before about you being a...<eos> Billionaire Boy Scout?
Ha! I mean, I made it all.<eos> I was a carpenter once.<eos> Met Adaline when my family built her family's summer home.<eos> No offense, but I didn't think the Qreshi princesses married down.<eos> Her family threatened to disown her when they found out, but she won that fight, like she always does.<eos> And when she decided to kick Pawter out, you just what?<eos> Let her win that too?<eos> When you love two people equally, you have to make a choice.<eos> You choose the one that makes you a better man.<eos> Better?
I got to get this shield down now.<eos> How are you even here?<eos> The plasma acts as a conduit between connected minds, among other things.<eos> Dutch, I'm reading massive trauma to D'Avin's lower left abdomen.<eos> You're hurt.<eos> No, Jaqobis is hurt.<eos> I need to send a message to my partner to switch us back before certain... people catch up to him... me.<eos> It's confusing.<eos> D'Avin can take care of himself.<eos> Not against the Black Root.
Bad dream.<eos> Another one?<eos> You're the one who thought talking about Khlyen's plasma was a good bedtime story.<eos> Now I can't switch my brain off.<eos> This isn't all on you.<eos> Why put so much pressure on yourself, like you're the only one who can solve it?<eos> Because somewhere deep and scary, I know that I am.<eos> I got to go.<eos> You're a free man.<eos> WESTERLEY
Maybe we'll do this old-school, real lo-fi.<eos> Knock yourself out. I'll just heal.<eos> Handy habit, that.<eos> But it's the green that keeps you smooth and scar-free, and thanks to D'Av, you're running a little low these days.<eos> How long has it been since you felt pain?<eos> Like, really, really felt it?<eos> Why did Khlyen have you watch D'Avin?<eos> - To protect him.<eos> - From what?<eos> From you.
She is a weapon meant to be used against us.<eos> And once we get what we can out of her, we're getting rid of her.<eos> What is that supposed to mean? - What do you think?<eos> - No, you say it.<eos> You want to go back to being Yala?<eos> Red Boxes and assassinations?<eos> You're better than that.<eos> We're not murderers.<eos> - We are at war.<eos> - With who?
Like you.<eos> I'm on that list because Khlyen put me there.<eos> You're on that list because Khlyen broke you in the cradle.<eos> It's not fair, you know?<eos> They didn't ask; they just took me and did this.<eos> I'm not anybody's puppet.<eos> On that, we agree.<eos> I'm not dying on this ship.<eos> What if I could help you identify all the Sixes, everywhere?<eos> One condition.
Johnny is not on Qresh.<eos> Lucy... where's Johnny?<eos> ♪ I'll always be a Westerlyn ♪ [device beeps]<eos> ♪ I'll always be ♪<eos> ♪ A Westerlyn ♪ [cheers and applause] [laughter]<eos> From up there, I flew.<eos> Like a bird.<eos> Flying.<eos> It was wonderful.<eos> So wonderful.
It hurts.<eos> What do you want?<eos> We could use a ride.<eos> It's the least you could do.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> Okay, a little backstory because it's only fair...<eos> My friend here, Enzo, and I are the unwilling employees...<eos> Not really employees.<eos> Yeah, more like slaves, serfs, lackeys.

Now.<eos> Geez.<eos> What the hell did Zane get himself mixed up with?<eos> There's only one way to know.<eos> We got to find this mystery man.<eos> Yo, L.T., have you seen Ryan?<eos> I think he's in the box.<eos> Ãlodie, thank you very much for taking time to Skype with me.<eos> I just... I wanted to share with you my vision of the play.<eos> Your vision?
So no soft-shoe?<eos> No.<eos> No soft-shoe.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - It happens.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, other than pissing off a homicidal drug lord, how did you enjoy our surprise date night?<eos> Are you saying you planned my abduction by a fugitive cartel leader?<eos> Yeah, complete with the daring rescue and everything.
I don't think date night counts when it's a candlelit dinner with the butcher of Guadalajara.<eos> Well, I'll... I'll plan something else.<eos> Something else?<eos> You didn't have a plan!<eos> Do you realize how pressure-filled this is, always trying to top each other?<eos> That's half the fun of it.<eos> Our rivalry is what fuels the passionate fire...<eos> - Rivalry. - What?<eos> Rivalry.<eos> Between two brothers.
A rivalry would explain why Zane was working with both brothers, but how... how do we prove it?<eos> I just need to find one piece of evidence to see that I'm on the right track.<eos> And that could be it.<eos> All right, my Spanish is a little rusty, but my handy translator says...<eos> Hector Zamacona's been sleeping with his brother's wife.<eos> They have been shacking up ever since El Oso went on the run.<eos> So Zane might have been caught in a rivalry between the brothers, and that's what got him killed.<eos> Hector wants more than just El Oso's wife.<eos> According to the D.E.A., all of his, uh, "legitimate" businesses... They're suspected fronts for money laundering.<eos> So with big brother on the run,
Am I foolish to think that she would...<eos> No.<eos> You're not foolish.<eos> I know you have more important things to think about.<eos> I just thought I'd give you some potential good news.<eos> How could you be so stupid?<eos> Haitham, I'm telling you, it's gonna be okay.<eos> He's not gonna give us any trouble.<eos> We have an understanding.<eos> Maybe with you, but not with me.
Then that's the plan.<eos> On this tragic day, with you and God as my witness, I announce my candidacy for president of Abuddin.<eos> It is a dangerous time for our country.<eos> There is a risk we give in to anger, fall prey to our old animosities, resort to violence.<eos> But it's an opportunity.<eos> An opportunity to reclaim our lost heritage, to follow the example, our prophet Muhammad, salla llahu wa-sallam, who taught that extremism and violence has no place in Islam.<eos> My vision is of an authentic Islam, one that remembers that tolerance is fundamental to our faith.<eos> Because...<eos> Islam is salaam.<eos> Peace.
Then take responsibility for stopping them.<eos> I cannot support closing places of worship.<eos> If all they were doing was praying, we wouldn't be having this conversation.<eos> But that's not the reality.<eos> They are terrorist cells.<eos> You have no evidence of that.<eos> You're implying anywhere people gather to pray is a breeding ground for terror.<eos> No, I am not.<eos> You can pray freely in the Central Mosque.<eos> Under your watchful eye.
Bad day?<eos> I'm Jamal's wife.<eos> Apparently, that's a crime I can never be pardoned for.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> To some people, I will always be the American, the Western infidel.<eos> Doesn't matter what the truth is.<eos> Do you remember what it was like?<eos> What?<eos> Before Jamal became...<eos> Jamal.
Success is about readiness matched with opportunity.<eos> Just be ready when your time comes.<eos> I know this isn't what you wanted.<eos> I haven't lost yet.<eos> Come to dinner tonight.<eos> We can talk it through.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have a meeting.<eos> With whom?<eos> General Cogswell.
Find a good one for us.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Here.<eos> Andthatchanged the entire course Of the Middle East, right up to the Arab Spring.<eos> For your critiques, I want you to take One of the countries of the Arab Spring And write about the election process.<eos> and please... Don't go over three pages.<eos> Economy, People.<eos> Professor El-Amin?<eos> I just wanted to ask you What's going on with your blog?<eos> My blog?
Isn't there any limit To what you'll do to get what you want?<eos> No, this was your doing...<eos> Not mine, Not William's.<eos> He killed someone for no reason.<eos> Even if he was a blackmailer, I had paid him off.<eos> You need to pull yourself together.<eos> Everything is about to change for us, For all of us.<eos> I'm not going to put that at risk because of some Mistake you made.<eos> This stays between us.<eos> Between us.
And we have to help him find his way back.<eos> And if you did, and if the election were held tomorrow, I would vote for Fauzi Nidal, not for you.<eos> I want you to have that chance.<eos> I am not making civil war against Bassam Al Fayeed.<eos> Who said anything about war?<eos> I'm talking about pressure, political pressure.<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> He's beyond reasoning now.<eos> That's why I'm talking to the Americans.<eos> The Americans?
We believe it's Ghani Al-Yazbek.<eos> Daliyah?<eos> Is she the one who tipped him off?<eos> How could she have known?<eos> That's what we're trying to figure out.<eos> I've listened to you.<eos> I've heard you repent for your sins.<eos> I've seen your pain and heartache when you talk about loved ones lost.<eos> And I've wept with you over your suffering.<eos> Our suffering.
Out of context, it's not as funny.<eos> I was rolling my eyes when I said it.<eos> Thank you for stabbing me in the back.<eos> You weren't the only one.<eos> Our victim took his right between his T4 and T5 vertebrae.<eos> Severed his spinal cord.<eos> Died instantly.<eos> I'm guessing from his outfit, he wasn't an employee?<eos> Most likely some kind of thief.<eos> Pretty good one at that.
I think maybe it was because I was having trouble undoing her corset.<eos> In my defense, it was, like, crazy-complicated, and... and... and I was...<eos> I was... I was very nervous.<eos> So after you logged on to your computer is when Karla left you?<eos> Yes. And as far as I know, the office was completely empty when I left.<eos> Did you actually see Karla leave the building?<eos> N-No.<eos> So it's possible she hid and then waited until you left?<eos> Hey, Ryan, Ned here wants to revise his statement.<eos> Awesome.
Fantastic.<eos> So I have unwittingly plunged my hometown back into the 16th century.<eos> Oh, that might not be all that bad.<eos> I mean, Hamlet was written in the 16th century.<eos> I'm not helping.<eos> Kate, do they know about my involvement yet?<eos> They traced the money to your account, and there is a warrant out for your arrest.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hayley, uh, is this Karla?<eos> Oh, yes, with our old friend Ned.
Which part?<eos> Classic analogies?<eos> Or that I don't ask permission to do what needs to be done?<eos> What if Bleeding Heart Bonnie doesn't want to take out the next one?<eos> Well, this sounds like the beginning of an accusation.<eos> In case you forgot, sparing Beau would've been a huge deal breaker.<eos> Well, it's a good thing you took care of him, then.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> I take care of things.<eos> And people.
Well, Damon, you're the authority on being hated, so why don't you tell me how to deal with the situation.<eos> Still mad, huh?<eos> I'm not mad, I'm just tired.<eos> Who's next on my hit list?<eos> Bloodsucker from the Age of Enlightenment.<eos> Ended up in a MMA fighter.<eos> Dropping bodies all through the Palmetto State.<eos> Doesn't sound very enlightened.<eos> That's why I'm partnering you up with Donovan.<eos> Matt?
Uh, so long as you don't fight my mucking around in your subconscious.<eos> Meaning we could have gone anywhere?<eos> "Anywhere" means Paris, by the way.<eos> So why are we walking around in my old high school?<eos> I might ask you the same question.<eos> I guess I'm trying to find something to hold onto.<eos> A time before vampires were a part of my life.<eos> Take those stoners.<eos> Chad Carpenter used to annoy me after practice every day, but he was a jerk.<eos> Not a vampire.
Violeta, you little ass, what did daddy tell you?<eos> Lujo Zelenika from the Stuttgart mission sends his warmest regards!<eos> There's no need to shout, he can hear you.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Bernstein Rosenthal Pharm International.<eos> Those bloody Jews own everything.<eos> Father Lujo has told me that you and minister Rukavina's grandfather were in Bleiburg together.<eos> In 1945, when the English betrayed us and sold us out to the partisans, my dad pulled Rukavina out of the line of prisoners at Dravograd.<eos> Rukavina swam across the river and escaped to Austria, but dad couldn't swim so he returned to Zagreb and hid in the Dominican monastery until 1951.<eos> Incredible.
She was a big woman.<eos> This one is beautiful.<eos> I even have a purse to go with it...<eos> May I?<eos> Please do.<eos> What is this?<eos> Nothing that would concern you.<eos> You know what I don't understand...<eos> How can you be what you are ...?<eos> A professor ...

To see professor Kralj.<eos> You don't say.<eos> To kick him around a bit more? It wasn't ...<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> Sure it wasn't, it was my grandma from Gospic.<eos> Don't lie, you little cunt, We have you on file.<eos> This isn't your first time.<eos> We've arrested you before. I happened to be in the club when the police came and arrested Bobanovic and his gang.<eos> And what were you doing in the club?<eos> Dancing.
Thank you.<eos> You're welcome, it's nothing.<eos> Don't worry about your F anymore.<eos> I'm giving you a D this semester.<eos> Is a C out of my reach?<eos> No, thank you, a D is enough.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Yes.<eos> How did you tell your folks that you're a ...?<eos> What?
The social worker called. And?<eos> And ... we have been granted the right to adopt.<eos> We're meeting the child next Tuesday.<eos> We'll be mom and dad.<eos> Shit, man!<eos> What's happening?<eos> And deliver us from evil. Amen.<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace.<eos> I'm sorry ... and you are?<eos> The neighbors.
Your mom says you're covered with bruises.<eos> You say it's because of football, but I believe you're lying.<eos> What's it to you?<eos> - The fact that you're lying?<eos> I'm not.<eos> - No, ok.<eos> Let's put it this way... I don't give a shit about you lying to your mother, ok?<eos> I used to bullshit my mother so much that her head would spin.<eos> I understand that! But, between me and you... what's going on?<eos> Acke...
I used to bullshit my mother so much that her head would spin.<eos> I understand that! But, between me and you... what's going on?<eos> Acke...<eos> I'm one of them.<eos> CF... what is it for?<eos> - "Cage fighters".<eos> What is it about?<eos> Fights? - Sorta.<eos> Where do you meet to fight? Where?<eos> Acke!
Is this it?<eos> - It's a copy.<eos> Listen to it. - And the original?<eos> In some place... and they expect me back before July 1st.<eos> If I'm not, it will go straight to the police.<eos> Still married to Bertil?<eos> - What is it that you want?<eos> Money?<eos> No, revenge.<eos> On who?
I think her name was Hansson. Check that out, Bosse.<eos> I knew you'd do anything, but murder...?<eos> - - No one can link it to us.<eos> We do know! - - We know nothing!<eos> Why are you so upset? -<eos> - An innocent was murdered!<eos> Shit! Is that Tom Stilton?<eos> That was just to be expected.<eos> From who?<eos> - - From Stilton.
That it was him who ratted.<eos> We're getting to Mal Pais.<eos> You know where to go exactly?<eos> Stop here.<eos> Hi, kids.<eos> - - Hi.<eos> What's your name?<eos> - - Leons. -<eos> - And yours? -<eos> - Lucia.
You caught them good job.<eos> I'm going for a walk to Santa Teresa.<eos> -<eos> I need some air.<eos> Gin tonic, please. Light on the tonic.<eos> -<eos> Are you here to surf?<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, where do you come from?<eos> Marseille.
We can't take her to the hospital.<eos> That's the first place they'll check.<eos> He got out!<eos> The loft.<eos> I'll bring the car up.<eos> Get monroe and rosalee.<eos> Black claw will try to kill them tonight.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> What with you?<eos> No eve.
Well, I wouldn't exactly say --<eos> This is some kind of punishment, isn't it? For my sins.<eos> A limbo where I get to spend eternity in a crappy bar with a hack writer.<eos> Sorry, Chuckles, not just any hack writer -- a Prophet of the Lord.<eos> Give me a break.<eos> Tell me at least the beer is real in here.<eos> ♪ I'm picking up good vibrations ♪ You really think I'm a hack?<eos> I have trudged through your complete oeuvre -- published and unpublished.<eos> Of the metric ton of books I've read in my lifetime, "Supernatural" didn't even crack the top 10... thousand.<eos> Respectfully.
I remember the first time I saw you.<eos> All the angels were terrified, but I wasn't.<eos> The feeling of your light was... was just beyond measure.<eos> And then the unthinkable.<eos> You picked me to help you with your tablets.<eos> You were just the closest angel to the door when I walked into the room.<eos> There's nothing special about you, Metatron.<eos> Not then... not now.<eos> I've been called many things -- absentee father, wrathful monster.<eos> But coward...
Well, I was a terrible writer.<eos> A worse god.<eos> It's good I got something going for me.<eos> Yeah, you know, I have to say, I didn't see the whole evil-turn thing coming. Mm-hmm.<eos> Why did you try to be me?<eos> That was just a sad, pathetic cry for attention.<eos> Whose attention were you trying to get?<eos> Yours.<eos> You are light... and beauty.<eos> Creation. Wrath.

Turn back the clock for us... before the world inevitably goes bye-bye.<eos> You're scared.<eos> Aye.<eos> I came face-to-face with the Darkness.<eos> The apocalypse bell's been rung a few times in our day, but when I looked inside her, I saw it.<eos> Not just the end of the world, Heaven and Hell -- the end of magic.<eos> Greek antiquity... or no deal.<eos> Middle Ages.<eos> I know, not the best time to be a witch.<eos> Or a black woman.
No. You don't dare talk about her.<eos> She's wonderful, kind, American success story.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Let me give you some motherly advice, dear.<eos> Don't expect anything from her.<eos> Trust me, she's plotting to get rid of you already.<eos> Because she only cares about herself.<eos> But, see, you're wrong, Mother.<eos> I re about Anezka, which is why she'll be staying in Miami.<eos> With me.
With me.<eos> And you'll be staying in prison. Alone.<eos> Come on, Anezka.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thanking you, beautiful sister. Thanking you.<eos> _<eos> Better than the first one? _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> - Boobies aside, though...
Did you see where the asswipe tossed the piece?<eos> - What?<eos> - Can't find it.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yes. How is Sean?<eos> He lost a lot of blood.<eos> Marine Unit is en route to find the gun.<eos> You hit him twice from 40 yards away in low light?<eos> Nice job.<eos> Kim.
He's a Chicago Scholar.<eos> He's on the Honor Roll.<eos> There's no way he could've done this.<eos> My son didn't do this!<eos> He didn't do this.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm all over the news.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Kim...
someone's son.<eos> Not an attempted cop killer.<eos> What is it?<eos> I think we got motive.<eos> Location of the incident is five miles away from Ellis' house.<eos> If he liked walking by the river or lake so much, why would he come here?<eos> The south branch is less than four blocks from his house.<eos> Ellis had a wallet the night he was shot which was inventoried.<eos> Inside there was a CTA pass which he didn't use the night of the shooting, so we couldn't build a time line of where he was<eos> - prior to the incident.
You've killed them.<eos> See?<eos> They're not undead.<eos> Only changed.<eos> Their minds gone.<eos> - Your mind is gone.<eos> - I don't wish to kill you,<eos> I need you.<eos> You could make my hunters with such great<eos> results.
Previously on "Faking It"...<eos> I'll let you crash on my couch.<eos> My attempts at flirting can come off as being a dick.<eos> You like me?<eos> You're saving yourself for Felix.<eos> We can't have a thing.<eos> Not until New Year's Eve.
"I took your advice, Sofia."<eos> "By the time you read this, I'll be on the plane with Josh, and we'll be one of those annoying couples who can't stop making out."<eos> - "Thank you. "I would have never done this without you pushing me.<eos> "I love you, I love you, I love you."<eos> I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!<eos> ...his therapist!
May I check you in?<eos> Wait.<eos> Couples only?<eos> As in no singles allowed?<eos> Yup.<eos> So, which one of you is the couple?<eos> - We are.<eos> - We are!<eos> Oh my God, you're a thrupple!<eos> A whupple?
You know, if I found out you were faking it just to get the free nights, I'd have to charge you.<eos> Wait one second, mister!<eos> How dare you question the moral integrity of this thrupple!<eos> Yeah!<eos> We're the real deal.<eos> That's right, honey.<eos> We're a pudding parfait.<eos> Oh, good. So you don't mind proving it by kissing in the kissing booth.<eos> - Not at all.<eos> - Our Pleasure.
She should be able to walk in about a week or so.<eos> I need you to give her the antibiotics three times a day when you change the dressing.<eos> You remember how?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, I am like a doctor now.<eos> Whoa, pump the brakes there, Omed.<eos> Just... Take care of her.<eos> She needs you now more than ever.<eos> As-salamu alayki, Sharbat.<eos> Wa'alikum asalaam.
Now if you have any way of reaching Antonio...<eos> I'll try his cell.<eos> Ambulance 61, fire 5960 North Jefferson.<eos> I got his voicemail.<eos> Right.<eos> Will you just tell him to call Sylvie Brett, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Truck, give me a primary search.<eos> - Hermann, Mouch, Kidd.<eos> With me.
Why rush into things?<eos> Mouch, I don't see a damn thing wrong with your eye.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll just put some ice on it.<eos> Should heal up fine.<eos> Hey. Listen to this.<eos> That Wine Bar was renovated by Gallo Construction, who happens to be bidding on a big city contract which happens to be one of the first measures I'm voting on.<eos> Small world, Chicago.<eos> What I'm saying is, I can stop them from landing that contract.<eos> With your one vote?
No, we're... we're fine.<eos> Good.<eos> Got a call from my lawyer.<eos> He's getting the divorce papers ready to send, so...<eos> Not like it's big news.<eos> Right.<eos> Nothing else.<eos> Stan, you got your son back, you got your house, your stuff...<eos> You still dating Tori?<eos> Off and on.

Let's see what else we have.<eos> Turns out they were on her.<eos> Stan just told me they were in the middle of a disaster at work.<eos> I'd been worried I pulled her for nothing.<eos> Well, you were right.<eos> She had to get out.<eos> She'll be okay.<eos> She was a nice woman.<eos> She was straight-ahead, uncomplicated.<eos> Simple.
Hey, Todd, got a sec, hon?<eos> Uh, we want to talk to you about something.<eos> Yeah, we talked, and we think we want to give this whole thing a go.<eos> Ha, ha, very funny.<eos> Friggin' Abbott and Costello, here.<eos> No. No, seriously.<eos> We're in.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> O-okay, n-now, just t-to be clear, we're talking about this, y... right?<eos> But not this. Just this.

This is about selling yourself as caring, passionate, electable.<eos> There is no peace for the victim when the wrong person is incarcerated.<eos> If a mistake has been made, we must correct it, no matter what embarrassment may arise.<eos> By going back into old cases?<eos> That's guaranteed to piss off every cop, prosecutor, and judge, while you hide behind...<eos> The leader of this unit needs a tenacious and brilliant legal mind...<eos> I heard your university board has you on probation.<eos> Something about sleeping with a student.<eos> ...an unwavering commitment to the truth.<eos> Students.
I cannot do it.<eos> Why is this even a crime?<eos> Anytime you want to say something, that'd be great.<eos> I'm sorry, but you're stuck.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Wallace has you for the next three years.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - But I love you.<eos> - You're a lousy brother.<eos> - The worst.
Name is Sandra Billingsley.<eos> A guard at Prickwillow Prison in England.<eos> Sounds like a Dickens novel.<eos> Love the British.<eos> Doesn't explain why she's living in a sea container.<eos> These might.<eos> These are prison jumpsuits.<eos> Are we looking at the bad end of a prison escape?<eos> We are a family business.<eos> Uh, an American business.
Where?<eos> No idea.<eos> He had me at gunpoint.<eos> He used my keycard to steal Intel.<eos> McGee, why the hell didn't my duress password shut down the system immediately?<eos> It's a delayed alarm, Director.<eos> Why?<eos> If it had shut down immediately, he might just have shot you.<eos> What did he get away with?<eos> A single file.
I did a search of the deleted images from his Snipcam and found one particular selfie that is illuminating.<eos> Objection. This image was not disclosed to us pre-trial, thereby violating rule 573. -Rule 573.<eos> The defendant's Snipcam cache was always in the discovery, Your Honor.<eos> Perhaps Ms. Keating just didn't search hard enough.<eos> If it requires a computer expert to decipher discovery, I move for a continuance.<eos> We can't delay this case again because the defendant has a penchant for changing lawyers.<eos> Let me remind the A.D.A. that this type of bad faith data dumping is prohibited under United States v. Warshak.<eos> -United States v. Warshak.<eos> -Stop. - Let me see the evidence before making a decision.<eos> Approach.
So, who are you bribing?<eos> A juror?<eos> Or are you just gonna buy another hooker?<eos> No, I told you I don't buy sex.<eos> Then what are you doing with the money?<eos> It's for my last lawyer.<eos> You want to fire me?<eos> Go for it.<eos> He's blackmailing me.<eos> For what?
You talked about me to those freshmen? They're my girls, okay?<eos> And I think that your whole, uh, "we're too different" crap is actually a cover for the fact that you know that we're the same.<eos> - How are we the same?<eos> - Uh, a lot of ways.<eos> For example, you like having sex with me, and so do I.<eos> - You're ridiculous.<eos> - I know you, Michaela.<eos> The real you, okay?<eos> I know you came here to be Michelle or Hillary or RBG, and I came here to be my dad, right?<eos> The better version.
You got a visitor.<eos> - Who the hell are you? - Dr. Keating.<eos> Sit.<eos> Your Aunt Bev knows my sister Hannah from high school.<eos> She was saying how worried your family is, that nobody's heard from you.<eos> You don't want them to visit?<eos> I'm in solitary.<eos> Yeah, but that was before. You haven't spoken to your parents in what a few months?<eos> Okay, look, I've worked with a lot of people in your similar situation.<eos> Sociopaths?
Have some drinks, get a room, slide my key card in her slot.<eos> Here.<eos> I told Thomas to meet you at that wine and cheese bar tomorrow at 7:30.<eos> Who's Thomas?<eos> No one.<eos> Just a stupid Internet date. It's not important.<eos> - Did you talk to him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It went well.<eos> - Who?
Here.<eos> I told Thomas to meet you at that wine and cheese bar tomorrow at 7:30.<eos> Who's Thomas?<eos> No one.<eos> Just a stupid Internet date. It's not important.<eos> - Did you talk to him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It went well.<eos> - Who?<eos> Wes?
What are you talking about?<eos> I just have to tell the police what I've been saying this whole time...<eos> I went to New York on my own. Frank was never there.<eos> It's smart.<eos> It protects Frank, too.<eos> You think I want to protect Frank?<eos> - Don't you?<eos> - No. You knew where he was, and you didn't tell me.<eos> Who am I here with right now, Wes?<eos> - You, not Frank.
And, of course, we will cut to that press conference as soon as it starts.<eos> Asher!<eos> Asher, please open the door!<eos> I thought you were dead. What?<eos> I'm just drunk.<eos> Annalise's house burned down.<eos> Someone's dead.<eos> - What? - Where's Connor?<eos> - You were with him, right?<eos> - And Laurel.
Wait, soil as in, like...<eos> You're obsessed with gay sex.<eos> No, I just find it interesting.<eos> Also, can we take a moment to enjoy the fact that I get to cross gay wedding off my bucket list again?<eos> - It was just sex.<eos> Relax.<eos> - It wasn't just sex.<eos> It was sex with a boy that broke your heart.<eos> Thank God I know how to separate sex from feelings.<eos> Even with Oliver?
I've got the cancer.<eos> - Okay, I'm lying. - I know.<eos> Micky, I left your daddy.<eos> So, if it's all right with you, I might need a place to stay for just a few weeks.<eos> Connor, you want some?<eos> Can we please talk?<eos> Not here.<eos> I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to protect you. Exactly.<eos> You have to stop that.<eos> What?
What you did was so unprofessional!<eos> That wasn't a fight, Alex?<eos> Okay, just tell me you're not gonna fine me again.<eos> Actually, no, Alex.<eos> I'm not gonna fine you this time.<eos> I've thought of something much worse for you.<eos> Bring it on.<eos> An hour-long session for you both, together, with Dr. Hackett.<eos> I would rather donate my entire salary.<eos> For the year.
You had me at type A.<eos> I'm guessing you're thinking that a behavioral analyst should be sitting in a lab somewhere, not working a case in New York City.<eos> Well, you said that, not me.<eos> Well, I've worked a dozen serial killer cases in my career.<eos> Must be tough to do when you're sitting behind a desk.<eos> And I've solved a few.<eos> How about you?<eos> Well, the only one that matters... is this one.<eos> Patrick Farrelly got into a gunfight on July 2, 1974 with a James McGee.<eos> Head of the Westies?
You probably shouldn't have volunteered to look into it for him.<eos> Thanks for rubbing it in. I'm just saying.<eos> What am I supposed to say?<eos> That your mother's been lying to you your entire life and your father's a gangster?<eos> No, you don't. You wait for him to go back to Ireland and then you send him an e-mail.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> If your father was a gangster, would you want to find out by e-mail?<eos> My father was a gangster and I found out when I was 13.<eos> Your father's a gangster?<eos> Well, a bookie.
The only thing you may do is share with me, right now, anything else you haven't shared.<eos> DCPI Moore, are you gonna do your job here, and ask your boss to back off?<eos> Not if I want to keep my job.<eos> I tell you what, let me make it easy on you, let's just cancel the joint investigation, how's that?<eos> That's not your call.<eos> Well, you didn't want to do it in the first place, so it's a wash, right?<eos> You can't just do that.<eos> Oh, sure I can.<eos> Just call it professional courtesy.<eos> Just between us men.
Well, that's different.<eos> I mean, you and Mycroft, you had each other growing up.<eos> I mean, for better or for worse.<eos> But she is a missing... piece.<eos> And she's not the only one.<eos> Your father.<eos> I mean, I always thought that he left us because he was sick.<eos> He wasn't capable of being part of a family.<eos> But he was capable.<eos> Just not with us.
But her killer drove a car full of evidence all the way to Bridgeport.<eos> And the only reason to do that was to make sure that that car was processed at the Connecticut forensics lab-- your lab-- where you could implicate whoever you wanted.<eos> Phoebe's brother was the lowest hanging fruit.<eos> You said yourself good police work usually reveals the killer.<eos> In this case, you have means and motive.<eos> And unless you can provide us with an alibi, you also have opportunity.<eos> I was home alone that night.<eos> But I can prove I didn't kill her.<eos> Recheck the DNA evidence from the stolen car in your own lab.<eos> Or a private lab.
Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> This is just one more outlet.<eos> But I got to say, it's my favorite.<eos> Feeling a lot better.<eos> Almost ready to get back to work.<eos> Good. We miss you.<eos> Oh, Sherlock is sorry that he couldn't make it.<eos> Uh, this girl that he's been seeing, it's her birthday.<eos> "Seeing"?<eos> Like, a girlfriend?
Yes. That's because they're plastered up and down the block where Butch and Jared were slain.<eos> Okay, but bands slap those things all over the place.<eos> Some do; others have it done for them.<eos> So they thought the two locations were well-chosen.<eos> Other than the bus passing every hour or so, they were devoid of surveillance cameras.<eos> They seemed like good locations to stage a fake murder and have an illicit drop.<eos> Question is, who scouted those places?<eos> Now, when we visited Butch's girlfriend, Roxanne, did you notice the shirt she was wearing?<eos> It's that one, isn't it?<eos> "Thunderclap 8."
The guy said he'd been assured that the condo would only have one occupant.<eos> And when I asked him how much money Mr. Taft had sent, he said 25 grand.<eos> Exactly half of what you told me Butch got for saying he would kill the developer.<eos> I was telling you the truth last night.<eos> Butch never said anything about his stupid blackmail plan.<eos> He kept it from me.<eos> Now I know why.<eos> He was gonna go be "Myron Taft"<eos> in Tahiti.<eos> Myron Taft?
They're targeting the James.<eos> Prepare to engage all incoming tracks.<eos> I need targeting solutions on that second destroyer.<eos> Negative, sir, we do not hold radar. Sir, the second Chinese Destroyer's gone.<eos> It's the same in every language.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Gallery's clear.<eos> Corridor clear.<eos> _<eos> On me!
The greater the lie, the more people will believe it.<eos> We are strong people, and we have survived worse than this.<eos> And those who still love life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness have come together and formulated a plan to move forward.<eos> So in the absence of any working federal government, and deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, your regional leaders, Price, Castillo, Wilson, and Croft hereby call for the immediate suspension of the government of the United States.<eos> Each region will be able to govern itself and focus on reconstruction until such time as a central authority can be safely reestablished. Yeah.<eos> In other words, never.<eos> By the time you hear these words, control of the Armed Forces will have been split among the regional leaders, and I would like to assure you... that the military turnover has been peaceful, thanks to an unprecedented collaboration between the nation's highest-ranking generals and your four regional leaders. Aah!<eos> All enlisted men and women are to report to regional military offices immediately to become part... Of one of four localized armies under the command...<eos> Captain, I can't get the generals on the line...<eos> Any of them.
About the contamination.<eos> I think the cops mentioned the brick first with all the boys.<eos> I'll check.<eos> You were awake this whole time?<eos> Those stories that I slept through law school...<eos> I just listen better with my eyes closed.<eos> Okay, maybe 15% of the time, I was asleep, 20 tops.<eos> The first confession, call came in from the hospital.<eos> According to the detective notes, the officer called in after speaking with the surgeon, who said the victim's skull was smashed in<eos> - with, apparently, a brick.
It was a Mardi Gras theme night.<eos> Beads being tossed around, hurricanes.<eos> We ended up having sex in the bathroom.<eos> It got a little wild.<eos> - Like, how wild?<eos> - Kind of rough.<eos> I smashed my phone screen.<eos> She broke her watch.<eos> That happened with you?<eos> Before the attack?
Yeah, but I had already spoken to Vishwa, we'll<eos> Falak, where is that ***** Minal, I want her to apologise.<eos> Rajvir, please...<eos> Please don't talk like that.<eos> Look...don't lecture me on morality.<eos> Get that ***** on the line, now!<eos> Don't you get it ...<eos> I don't have a problem with you.<eos> But I do!<eos> With you, with your language... with your filthy mind.
You mean the north-east. Leave.<eos> Viru, stay.<eos> Grow up!<eos> Stop hanging around with these kids!<eos> Does a Minal Arora stay here'? - Yes. Second floor!<eos> We're from Surajkund Police Station. Yes?<eos> So has our FIR been filed?<eos> - Which one of you is Minal?<eos> Me! Follow me<eos> - Why?
So there's no question of him paying for it.<eos> So he didn't pay you?<eos> Did he force you?<eos> No. he didn't force me. He didn't pay me.<eos> We liked each other.<eos> We did it because we wanted to.<eos> Right.<eos> After that, your close acquaintances which also includes Vishwa, testified before the police that you have had other relationships.<eos> Did you have 'sexual relations' with all of them?<eos> Some of them
- - Now?<eos> Yea, now would be good.<eos> Good evening, sir.<eos> And who are you?<eos> -<eos> - Abbas el Fassi, I come from Sweden.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> What do you want?<eos> - - Just to talk to you. -<eos> - To me?
Yea, now would be good.<eos> Good evening, sir.<eos> And who are you?<eos> -<eos> - Abbas el Fassi, I come from Sweden.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> What do you want?<eos> - - Just to talk to you. -<eos> - To me?<eos> About what?
What's this shop called?<eos> -- "Udda Rätt" (*eccentric and perfect).<eos> Just like the Mink, eccentric and damn perfect!<eos> They're cute, but try these. You have to dare. They're a bit more flashy.<eos> Look at these!<eos> Yes, I'd go for these.<eos> What will you wear?<eos> A red dress. -<eos> - Low-cut? -<eos> - Well, enough.
- Mom's friend and his friend.<eos> The one with the hat.<eos> - - Yes.<eos> What did you tell them? -<eos> - About what? I said nothing.<eos> He came to he underground room.<eos> How the fuck did he know about it? -<eos> - I don't know!<eos> I don't like people ratting. Shut up.<eos> Acke!

I got Jackie's DNA.<eos> - - Marianne!<eos> I need your help.<eos> Who are the ones that beat me up?<eos> Is he still in Costa Rica? -<eos> - I don't know...<eos> He got the tape from a local man then he disappeared.<eos> Check Arlanda. Every damn flight.<eos> You cannot lose him again!<eos> Acke!

Why have you always lied about it?<eos> - - I didn't wanna be involved.<eos> There were two Norwegians on that yacht Geir Andreasen and Petter Moen.<eos> Which one had sex with you?<eos> Petter. -<eos> - Petter Moen? I think so...<eos> - - You think so?<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Do you remember who you slept with 25 years ago?<eos> - - Yes, my husband.
Jack. They haven't slept together.<eos> Okay. Thanks.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Well, we should go anyway.<eos> - Thanks for breakfast.<eos> How about that?<eos> What?<eos> She made a friend.<eos> I got to be honest with you, I'm a little confused here.<eos> About what?
So, um, Jack came by the office.<eos> For a session?<eos> More like a date under the guise of a session.<eos> He always loves a grand gesture.<eos> It was... charming.<eos> Sure, it was.<eos> But you know that he can sustain a relationship about as long as he can probably hold a boombox over his head.<eos> Yeah, but everyone remembers the boombox.<eos> He told you his near-plane-crash story?<eos> - Yeah, among other things.
Is that what you're saying?<eos> Because it's actually more racist to think that's racist. Oh.<eos> How do you figure?<eos> It's like how Americans think it's insulting to call Mexicans "Mexican."<eos> As if it's an insult to actually be from Mexico.<eos> It's just their ingrained sense of superiority shabbily masked behind political correctness that really highlights our latent racist views.<eos> Maybe it was just your tone of voice.<eos> Yeah, we should get some drinks.<eos> Hey, can I get a whiskey? Neat.<eos> Double, please.
Now I have good reason.<eos> If they find out what you are... what this is... I know.<eos> I will be destroyed.<eos> You want to find whoever killed One.<eos> So do I.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he was one of us.<eos> All right, we're docked.<eos> Let's go grab a few drinks while the robot does her thing.<eos> Oh, hey, not this time.
Your case isn't about freedom of speech.<eos> My speech put me in the police cross hairs, and once I was there, they didn't look at anyone else.<eos> The forensics team didn't collect your words.<eos> They collected bomb fragments and matched the bomb you blogged instructions on how to build.<eos> And the cops picked you up an hour after the attack with explosives residue on your clothes, so explain that, Professor.<eos> The Counter Terrorism Unit did not frame Rodney Landon.<eos> They're the most prestigious unit in the NYPD.<eos> The best of the best.<eos> Remember when I talked about challenging the cops?<eos> With a totally unfounded allegation?
What if the team's right?<eos> We don't put people in prison because they're dangerous. We put them there because they're guilty.<eos> I could drop Landon's case, move on to the next one.<eos> Could, but you're not going to.<eos> If you prove Landon didn't bomb the mosque, you'll get him released, and then I'll tell CTU to put him under 24-hour surveillance.<eos> They couldn't keep that up forever.<eos> He's smart.<eos> He'll bide his time.<eos> We're lawyers, Hayes, not superheroes.<eos> Or provocateurs.
I never had a mom-<eos> You must be joking.<eos> Why would I do it for the money?<eos> Fine.<eos> We'll just consider each other as dead.<eos> Perhaps during the lost 10 years of my life, I might have reunited with mom, and lived like any ordinary mother and son.<eos> Visiting he! at the hospital from time to time.<eos> Then should I be the son who's forgiven his mother?<eos> Why are you wearing that on your finger?<eos> What about your precious diamond ring?
We're posted up outside Hayes and Jackson Morrison's apartment, and from the looks of it, it's pretty good being the president's kids, especially if you're caught with blow.<eos> "Coke head Hayes Morrison put in charge of DA's flagship unit."<eos> - That's TMZ.<eos> - We've been through worse.<eos> Buzzfeed has me at the top of their list for White House train-wreck relatives.<eos> Dad schtupping that ambassador's wife.<eos> I'm ahead of Billy Carter.<eos> He took a whiz in front of the press corps.<eos> You getting expelled from boarding school for drinking.<eos> Ahead of all the Kennedys with rap sheets.
Why would my older brother get me poison oak as a housewarming gift?<eos> It's not poison oak, Mike!<eos> Why don't you look me in the eyes and say that.<eos> It's not poison oak...<eos> Mike.<eos> Then why don't you go ahead and rub it on your balls for me?<eos> Fine.<eos> You happy now?<eos> Outside the bag.<eos> Under the suit.
That's not the way we work.<eos> We don't take stupid risks, and we're not greedy.<eos> But we're human.<eos> Sometimes one of these rules get's broken.<eos> Now today we have to deal with the consequences of that.<eos> Are you gonna be okay?<eos> Good boy.<eos> And if you're not, you just come to me.<eos> There are no secrets in this family, not from one another.<eos> Especially not from me.
Bring the baby.<eos> I'm working.<eos> Well, call in sick.<eos> Do you need cash?<eos> I can't get my shift covered this late.<eos> Quick like a bunny, Lena!<eos> W-Why don't you leave her with me today?<eos> I know Baz would like it.<eos> She's got a doctor's appointment.<eos> Maybe next time.
It was a one-time thing.<eos> So, what is going on with you?<eos> Does your grandmother know you smoke pot?<eos> What, are you gonna kick me out of school?<eos> No.<eos> You're too smart to be a dropout.<eos> Lighter?<eos> Come on. Give me your lighter.<eos> You surf, right, J?<eos> Sometimes.
- Cath, fix it.<eos> Fix it!<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Bullshit!<eos> Smurf's icing me out.<eos> Why didn't you say something?<eos> 'Cause I'm trying to handle it.<eos> I messed up.<eos> The cop?
Listen, Patrick.<eos> [sighs] I know I've been on your ass, but I'm done.<eos> I got nothing real on you.<eos> I beat on you in an elevator, you scare the hell out of my daughter, and why?<eos> We're both just trying to do right by our families.<eos> ...We are.<eos> So let's just focus on our families and call it a draw.<eos> I mean, sometimes you just got to move on.<eos> Realize your priorities in life.<eos> Sometimes.
- What if she calls there?<eos> - She won't. She wants nothing to do with her anymore.<eos> Is that your problem?<eos> No, but it's making it worse.<eos> So it's Smurf.<eos> Of course it's Smurf.<eos> Ever since Pope got out of prison, I'm on shaky ground with her, okay?<eos> - Oh, God. - No matter what I do... - I bust my ass.<eos> - Please. I run bullshit errands for jobs she wants to run.<eos> Basta! Basta.
Smurf's truck was parked outside my place last night.<eos> I wasn't looking for a lecture then, either.<eos> That was me. I was waiting for you.<eos> Don't let your dish sponges get so filthy, man.<eos> You put those things in the windowsill.<eos> The sun kills more bacteria than any of that chemical shit you can buy.<eos> Smurf send you? Yeah.<eos> Because Baz couldn't get you to come home.<eos> Do you ever feel like leaving, man?<eos> Sometimes, yeah.
He's been working on an idea.<eos> You comin'?<eos> Used to be a house down there.<eos> Emilio and Carmen Ortiz.<eos> Used to work with me back when I was on patrol.<eos> Cops?<eos> Confidential informants.<eos> They had done a string of robberies along the coast and wanted out.<eos> I think they would've been okay after they did a little time, but they made the mistake of getting into business with Janine Cody.<eos> J's grandmother.
Okay. I'll accept your apology.<eos> I got to go to the bathroom.<eos> You went just like this with your whole face, right into the cake, no hands?<eos> Did you have icing all over you face?<eos> Yeah, and in my hair.<eos> Mommy got mad.<eos> I bet she did.<eos> You know, sometimes mommies get so mad they ruin the fun.<eos> She got mad when I played with the siren, too.<eos> The siren?
Josh? Look, I heard them talking.<eos> They were all there.<eos> And why are you concerned about your girlfriend and her father?<eos> I'm not concerned about Nicky, and she's not my girlfriend.<eos> - We broke up.<eos> - Did you overhear something?<eos> Are they... Are they in danger?<eos> Nicky slept with my uncle.<eos> Who?<eos> Pope? No, Craig.
Just... just... helping out.<eos> Where are we piping the water next?<eos> - The back nine. - Good.<eos> Where's that?<eos> Come with us.<eos> We're heading there now.<eos> This is more disorganized than I thought it would be.<eos> Well, we're still working out the kinks.<eos> You might be interested in telling the senator - your concerns.<eos> - The senator?
- What's his name?<eos> - ‭Gary.<eos> He hasn't been in here.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why don't you bring him in here?<eos> No.<eos> I'll go talk to him.<eos> You're a good person, aren't you?<eos> No, just a person.
You've seen me. Once.<eos> I'm alone here. It's... it's not the docks, the noise, the life.<eos> This life here, it is only going until Edmund Reid is reckoned for.<eos> But until then, it is the best life I can make for you.<eos> You have done me a kindness, Gustus, I know it, but he will be reckoned for when?<eos> Reid is hunted and will be found.<eos> But while he puts his snout to the very cobbles of Whitechapel for scent of you and sniffs at who knows what trail beyond, it is best you keep to yourself, is it not?<eos> I shall bring books for you.<eos> You might visit with... with the pup.<eos> The pup?

Is it true, then?<eos> What he said?<eos> I'm not an animal.<eos> It's Gustus, he just... he wants to keep us safe.<eos> I don't see an animal, Nathaniel.<eos> I see a hurt, lonely boy.<eos> I did not come here to judge.<eos> I do not want Caleb to hurt you no more.<eos> And what if we left this place?<eos> Robin as well?
I love her.<eos> As I understand it. The doctor's have passed you fit Inspector.<eos> I'll be a father to you.<eos> Are Westminster police so at night?<eos> The house, entrances, bed chambers of the occupants.<eos> You live quiet, easy.<eos> that my arms will be put to rest.<eos> I do not see an animal inside you.<eos> What if we left this place?<eos> Roman as well.
I understand the separation was quite recent.<eos> I wonder if she'll be as confident of your innocence as you are.<eos> Nathan and I were married for nine years before we separated.<eos> When was that?<eos> Uh, January. Just a few months after he got out of prison.<eos> Before Nathan was arrested he was this funny, sweet guy, but after he went to Great Meadow he was different.<eos> Different how?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> He just wasn't...<eos> himself anymore.
The second round began just a few months after the two of you were released.<eos> Which means either one of you could have been the original bomber.<eos> We know you and Nathan were close in prison.<eos> You shared food, contraband.<eos> Wouldn't be hard to imagine you sharing other things, too.<eos> Secrets about building bombs, for example.<eos> Now, one of you was the bomber before you went to prison.<eos> That man recruited the other, so the real question is did you enlist Nathan or was it the other way around?<eos> Are you the teacher or the student?<eos> The teacher.
You were a suspect in the case.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> HPD accused me of ripping 'em off, and making 'em disappear.<eos> But it was crap.<eos> And they never found no bodies or any of the stuff that went missing.<eos> Yeah, till now.<eos> Yeah, one of the things that went missing was an ivory chess set.<eos> And that right there is one of the pieces.<eos> Somebody!<eos> Help!
The more accurate question is: Who was he?<eos> He was born Tobias Thoma.<eos> Syrian citizen came here with his family.<eos> Joined the Navy to help him get American citizenship.<eos> He was in Naval Intelligence until he defected and became Asakeem.<eos> Now he's a high-value target.<eos> He's the high-value target in Syria.<eos> And he's rumored to be high up in the Jabhat Fatah Al-Sham, formally the Al-Nusra Front.<eos> And he's working to unite the Free Syrian Army with the Anjad Al-Shim<eos> Islamic Union.
So this is where the cool kids hang out.<eos> These are Special Agents Callen and Hanna. You know Mr. Beale.<eos> We wondered where you ran off to.<eos> Can we help you?<eos> Yes, and you can start by telling me what's going on here.<eos> We're in the middle of a very time-sensitive case.<eos> Then you best tell me quickly.<eos> What now?<eos> We need to find that Ferrari.<eos> With pleasure.
The age of secret decoder rings and lipstick radios.<eos> But seriously, did you ever use any of this, or is it just for show?<eos> I'm aware how difficult this must be for you.<eos> But I also know you want what's best for the agency and this unit.<eos> But while you were chasing trench coats and microdots, the real culprits waltzed right past your umbrella gun in a series of ones and zeroes, and set up base camp in your house.<eos> You're just lucky it wasn't worse.<eos> You've served your country well, Henrietta.<eos> You should be proud of that.<eos> But you've earned your rest.<eos> Hetty?
Your dog. ♪ Keep your pain ♪<eos> I don't have a dog.<eos> ♪ Close company now ♪ Is that why you look so sad?<eos> ♪ Close company now... ♪ This is my happy face.<eos> Somehow I doubt that.<eos> I'm Heather.<eos> Well, it's nice to meet you, Heather.<eos> ♪ On a different street ♪ And this is where you tell me your name.<eos> ♪ In a different town... ♪ Something tells me you're not a social butterfly.<eos> More of a moth.
Do they know our guys have Asakeem?<eos> Yes, they know.<eos> Now, if we're able to ping their location using Callen's sat phone, we may be able to send them a drone, provide air support.<eos> We could, if Hetty or I were not persona non grata at this point.<eos> Have any favors left? Oh, I doubt it.<eos> What about you?<eos> No.<eos> Too much bad juju on this one.<eos> I think we're both untouchable.<eos> What about Duggan?
Oh, please.<eos> You could hack in your sleep.<eos> I'm hardly a distraction.<eos> You know, I read this article about this guy in San Pedro, who has the two largest aluminum foil balls in SoCal.<eos> He charges a buck to see them.<eos> Do you know what I admire most about this guy with those giant balls?<eos> You know what attribute really stands out for the giant balls guy, Walter?<eos> I will tell her how I feel when I get the chance, but right now, there are out of control F-130s screaming across L.A., so we have more important things to worry about.<eos> Where have I heard that before?<eos> Admiral.
Got it?<eos> Got it.<eos> Got it.<eos> Tim, Walter's the boss.<eos> We follow his lead.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Truth is, as much as I hate flying, I am excited to get out of this garage.<eos> Between Tim and Walter and Happy and Toby, it's too tense.<eos> I'm getting out of my jimjams.<eos> Admiral.
We bail, the laser could shift and you'd die.<eos> We're staying.<eos> If these are our last moments together,<eos> I propose we die with no secrets between us.<eos> No.<eos> I'll go first.<eos> Sometimes when I'm alone in the garage I sniff your work gloves.<eos> Great, now I can die disgusted.<eos> Guys?<eos> Another time?
Kid, these Bootleggers have taken out a fighter jet, controlled four Navy destroyers, and now they have a sub with nukes on it.<eos> We're talking the balance of the free world here, Sly.<eos> So, pretend to scratch your ear and take your comm out.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> It can't be found on you.<eos> We'll be back to get you after the threat is neutralized.<eos> You're serious?<eos> As a heart attack.<eos> Like the one I'm about to have?<eos> Okay, Skunk.
"Favorite TV Shows."<eos> But can't we just let bygones be bygones?<eos> I mean, really, I've done a lot of work on myself.<eos> I have found inner peace, and I've completely...<eos> completely centered myself through a series of... of therapy sessions that became intensely sexual.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's on your résumé.<eos> Him you can call.<eos> We don't like to work with nemesises.<eos> Nemesi?
Where's Captain Hunter?<eos> I would be happy to play his final message for you all.<eos> Together, you are the best crew, the best team a captain could ever hope for.<eos> Good luck. What do you guys say we get out of 1942?<eos> Not until you answer a few questions.<eos> We're the Justice Society of America.<eos> And you're coming with us.<eos> Oh, my God. You're Commander Steel.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> - Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing, Grey?<eos> I'm looking for any hidden doors.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> Nate and Ray are lost in Feudal Japan.<eos> Let's just fix the ship and go.<eos> Shh, did you hear that, Jefferson?<eos> Move.<eos> - Oh my god.<eos> - Secret hatch.<eos> With a sequencing lock.
And you are surprisingly taller than I thought in real life.<eos> Um... I'm a Colonel in the Union Army.<eos> Colonel Sanders. I'm Colonel Sanders with the 31st Pennsylvania Infantry.<eos> Then why are you not in proper uniform, son?<eos> My uniform's in the wash, sir.<eos> Or you are a Confederate spy.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Look, we're not Confederates. And truth be told, we're not a part of the Union either.<eos> But we are here to tell you that your company is in danger.<eos> In danger?
See, my staff know better than to talk back to me.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> Won't happen again, sir.<eos> Don't you turn your back on me, boy.<eos> There a problem, Mr. Collins?<eos> Just a house boy who don't know his place.<eos> And needs to be taught some manners.<eos> These zombies, they're... They're going to kill all of you.<eos> And I keep asking, what in perdition's flames is a zombie?<eos> This.
Okay, get to the part where we care, Ray.<eos> I think he's gonna use the railroad and the dwarf star to... wait for it.<eos> I don't want to wait for it.<eos> Close Summit Pass.<eos> - Oh, my God, Ray's right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Summit Pass connects East/West via railroad.<eos> Not if Turnbull uses this...<eos> - the magic...<eos> - Dwarf star?
Totally badass.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - No. But I stopped a train.<eos> - I think he's good.<eos> - Whoo! I stopped a train!<eos> That's a mighty fine job you did back there.<eos> Captain.<eos> I'll drink to that.<eos> So now that you have your man, what're you gonna do with him?<eos> Turnbull?
Sara, stay out of the library.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> Look, I know you've been through a lot, but we really need to talk about the aberration that you caused.<eos> Perhaps some other time.<eos> What were you doing in here, anyways?<eos> - Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.<eos> - I speak six languages, why...<eos> Stein's about to kill Sara in the library.<eos> With the rope or the candlestick?
If you look closely, you'll find some discrepancies in his bookkeeping.<eos> You expect me to believe that Al Capone is gonna be taken down by tax evasion?<eos> Sounds screwy.<eos> Actually, it'd make a pretty good movie one day.<eos> You know, if this is the week the Feds get Capone's ledger, why does it take four more years for them to take him down?<eos> Because it's the federal government.<eos> Now that's the Mick Rory I remember, always thinking with his stomach.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Nobody.
Um, hello?<eos> Yes. Hello, Mr. Allen.<eos> I can still see you're there and no, I don't want your help, thank you.<eos> What are you doing here, Julian Albert, meta-human CSI Specialist?<eos> I did tell you the meta-human conference - was only for two days.<eos> - Okay, but this is...<eos> Still our lab... unfortunately.<eos> Yes, County forgot to mention that significant detail before assigning me, but here we are.<eos> Looks like you and I get to be roomies for a little longer than we'd hoped.<eos> Roomies.
Yeah, it's too much.<eos> It's the heart, right?<eos> It's too cheesy?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Is that better?<eos> That's... That's worse?<eos> We'll go back to the heart.<eos> No, Bare. Wait, wait, wait.<eos> It is so beautiful, and you are so sweet, but tonight, I want to be with you.<eos> Barry Allen. Not the Flash.
Barry Allen. Not the Flash.<eos> So...<eos> So no Flash talk.<eos> No speed.<eos> No problem.<eos> All right. Starting now, the Flash is officially off-limits.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> It's a surprise.<eos> Are you planning on donating a kidney sometime in the near future or...?<eos> A kidney?
- What?<eos> That's why we called you.<eos> - Well, can you close it?<eos> - Once again, wouldn't have called if I could.<eos> - Somebody's coming through.<eos> Allen.<eos> Wells.<eos> I need your help.<eos> With what?<eos> - With that.
Well, Scudder is hell-bent on finding Snart, and he's going after anybody that worked with him in the past.<eos> Joe's interviewing one of 'em right now.<eos> Well, all of Snart's known associates are either presumed dead or gone AWOL, except for one.<eos> - That's her.<eos> - Rosalind Dillon.<eos> Says she has the ability to induce crippling vertigo.<eos> - She's, uh... - Top, like a top.<eos> She's the Top.<eos> That's her name.<eos> Top. Amazing.
I caught it. But that's the point.<eos> You need a genius, I guess, to help you in your fight against these awful meta-hominids.<eos> Well, I got to tell you... I got to tell you, to me, that sounds like fun.<eos> So... I'll enclose my curriculum vitae.<eos> You already know we speak the same language. But take a look. Tell me what you think.<eos> Until our next communion.<eos> Oh, where are my manners?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Not bad.<eos> - Not bad at all.
Oh, no. Thank you.<eos> We got another bad meta right where he belongs.<eos> - Yep, all right.<eos> - Hey, Joe.<eos> We have an awful lot of IOUs.<eos> Do you maybe want to grab some dinner tonight?<eos> - Dinner?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I... well, I've got movie night with my kids tonight.<eos> Rain check?
You've been burned, twice... by a man with the same face as me.<eos> I imagine it's hard to trust after something like that.<eos> - You think?<eos> - I do think.<eos> So play... the rest of it.<eos> I've read his journals.<eos> I found nothing that can tell me why Francisco feels the way he does, but I do hope I can change his opinion of Harrison Wells and the two of us can rebuild that friendship.<eos> What a fantastic C-story to weave within the narrative.<eos> What?<eos> What narrative?
I was their firstborn son.<eos> I was supposed to inherit the lot.<eos> But I was the odd duck...<eos> Who would rather go in the garden and collect samples of insects.... Rather than learn how to tie a Windsor knot or which fork to use first at dinner.<eos> Yeah. No, I wanted more.<eos> You know?<eos> I came here to do the one thing that they couldn't stop me from doing.<eos> Becoming a scientist... becoming a great scientist.<eos> And then just as I got to the top of my field, poof, the world changes overnight.<eos> Meta-humans.
Perfect.<eos> So I did have powers?<eos> I was Kid Flash?<eos> In Flashpoint, yes.<eos> I knew that this was happening.<eos> Why didn't you tell me before?<eos> Because...<eos> Because why?<eos> All right, fine, Wally, it, look... in that timeline, you were fighting The Rival.<eos> Edward Clariss?
Keeps me alert.<eos> Then I'm on high alert.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Hello, Wally.<eos> Are you him?<eos> Are you the voice I've been hearing inside my head?<eos> I am Alchemy.<eos> I've been having visions of another life.<eos> Where... where I have speed, where, I'm...<eos> The Flash.
Is this some sort of fashion choice?<eos> 'Cause you're not a meta-human.<eos> - Am I her? - Yeah.<eos> I saw the both of us.<eos> Like, full-on Vibe versus Killer Frost.<eos> The time has come to set you free.<eos> Wally, don't!<eos> You may serve the speed force, Flash, but I rule it.<eos> You are only a man, but I am a god.<eos> Your god.
I don't want to see you out here again!<eos> You again?<eos> How's the leg?<eos> You call yourself a vigilante?<eos> You just let the Halcones' top seller get away.<eos> Now, I thought I said that I didn't want to see you out here again.<eos> You don't listen very well.<eos> You sound like my ex.<eos> Rene Ramirez, you need to decide if you want to be a man in a hockey mask or if you want to be someone else...<eos> Something else.
Found in a body of unknown chemicals.<eos> Based on the lack of epidermis erosion, the chemicals were non-acidic.<eos> Autopsy was commenced at 18:25 with a y-incision.<eos> Why can't I feel anything?<eos> Good night.<eos> I'm headed home.<eos> Oh, uh, give me a sec.<eos> I'll join you. Not home, I mean.<eos> Bow! I'm a happily married man.<eos> Happy.
We never meet in person, only remotely.<eos> Remotely?<eos> How?<eos> A digital dead drop, the Dark Web.<eos> What's the IP address?<eos> What is the IP address?<eos> 108.166.7.161.<eos> If this information is incorrect, your family will suffer.<eos> How does an American become this...<eos> This...
You have no idea.<eos> I'd have a better one if you'd just cut the crap and tell me whatever it is you're not telling me.<eos> What?<eos> ! There's no deception here.<eos> I actually was kind of sort of friends with one of the victims--Gay Eked.<eos> "Kind of sort of"?<eos> Pike wants us in his office.<eos> We'll talk later.<eos> Ok. So we got a problem with your girlfriend.<eos> - Who?
- All of them?<eos> - All of them.<eos> They deserve to know that this has escalated.<eos> Stop calling Susan Williams my girlfriend.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> There he is!<eos> I see him!<eos> Look out!<eos> He's over there!<eos> Right behind you!
Do you guys?<eos> He's saying you're the serial killer.<eos> Harsh, but feeling pretty accurate.<eos> I was trying to help this city.<eos> Prometheus isn't.<eos> You convinced me to not get revenge on Ruvé Darhk for my parents because killing would tarnish the Black Canary's legacy.<eos> How are you anything other than a hypocrite?<eos> First, it would have tarnished her legacy.<eos> Second, you knew that I was a killer when you came on board.<eos> Not a serial killer.
If he was just fired, how could he afford all those wonderful, new toys?<eos> That's nothing.<eos> Got a brand-new Porsche 911 downstairs that he apparently paid cash for, and he just leased a safe-deposit box at a bank down the street.<eos> Well, detectives, I deduce that our victim's sudden influx of cash had something to do with the fact that... He has no head!<eos> Dudes, seriously, give a guy a heads up.<eos> - Make way, Castle! - Oh!<eos> Time of death... between 10:00 p.m. and midnight.<eos> Lars was strapped to that chair with duct tape.<eos> Perimortem bruising indicates that he was tortured before the killer decapitated him with...<eos> Sword!
All right, where were... we?<eos> Where'd she go?<eos> Ms. Cross, your brother appears to have come into a great deal of money upon his return to the country, but we checked his financials, and there's no record where it came from.<eos> Do you have any idea?<eos> None.<eos> I know for a fact he was broke when he left for Turkey.<eos> Did he have any enemies at home or abroad?<eos> No.<eos> He got along with everyone.<eos> Ever his ex-boyfriend, Mark?
Have a lovely day.<eos> Ah, my back.<eos> I'm gonna need that back.<eos> Sure.<eos> Let me just dust it off.<eos> Uh, ah-ah, hands!<eos> Travis, hurry it up!<eos> We've got company!<eos> - Who the hell are you?<eos> - Nobody.
We've got company!<eos> - Who the hell are you?<eos> - Nobody.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> So you're nobody doing nothing?<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> I... would love to chat, but, uh, you are obviously busy in whatever clearly legal endeavor you're engaged in.<eos> - Are you a cop?<eos> - No, no, not a cop.
You can't let everyone in.<eos> Remember that opera singer - I used to date?<eos> - How did you do that? We're suddenly talking about you again.<eos> She told me, when she had to do a sad scene, she couldn't get emotional, because her throat would close up, and she couldn't sing.<eos> If she felt too much, she couldn't do her job.<eos> So you're saying don't feel?<eos> No, I'm saying only feel if it makes you effective.<eos> God... politics.<eos> Are you still in touch with, uh, Wheatus's legislative director?<eos> Gareth?
I shouldn't have said all that.<eos> I mean, I know who you are.<eos> Maybe I was jealous.<eos> - I'm sorry. - It's this town.<eos> I hate this town.<eos> - And I don't, at the same time.<eos> - You know what?<eos> Do you want to come over now? I was just making some tea.<eos> Tea sounds good.<eos> Maybe a rain check. Okay.
Cory's real name<eos> Is han choi. Or we don't know what his actual given name in korea is, But han choi is the name under which<eos> He entered the u.S.<eos> Korea? Entered the u.S.?<eos> Cory grew up in thousand oaks.<eos> He thinks culture is eating kalbi down on western.<eos> I think you have the wrong guy.<eos> What's cory's last name, and what does he do for a living?<eos> Sung. And he's an artist.<eos> What kind of artist?
Copy that, sam.<eos> you guys good?<eos> Yeah, we're good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's a nice little plan. Send him in with the original group of spies.<eos> Anything goes wrong, he's here to clean up.<eos> Get anything more out of his girlfriend?<eos> No, no.<eos> Clementine isn't exactly the most helpful, Or useful, witness.<eos> or perhaps the brightest.
No ties to terrorists or spy groups.<eos> No suspicious financial transactions.<eos> No suspects.<eos> Scratch that. One suspect.<eos> Lieutenant Karen Roberts.<eos> She checked in online, but never boarded her flight to Sydney.<eos> Send Kensi and Deeks to her place. Yup.<eos> Uh, excuse me, Assistant Director?<eos> Out of curiosity what did you want to be when you were five years old?<eos> Six years old.
You promise? Absolutely.<eos> Off the top rope?<eos> Off the top rope.<eos> Forearm shiver?<eos> You okay with that? Yeah.<eos> Now I want to go, because I want to eat aglio e olio. Andiamo.<eos> Aglio e olio!<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> I'm pretty sure you just like saying that out loud. Aglio e olio e olio!<eos> Aglio e olio...
Mr. Peterson?<eos> NCIS. Special Agent Lasalle.<eos> And I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> This is your daughter's house?<eos> The officer who called said Becca died unexpectedly.<eos> That's all.<eos> You here to tell me what happened?<eos> We can't release any details.<eos> I'm just here to ask a few questions for our investigation.<eos> "Investigation"?
I'm trying to protect you, Dwayne.<eos> Believe it or not.<eos> The general is... he's a force of nature.<eos> Yeah, well... consider me warned.<eos> Thank you for coming in, General.<eos> Go ahead and have a seat.<eos> Please.<eos> You told me you hadn't seen Rebecca in years.<eos> But according to the hotel staff, she visited every time you were in town.<eos> And often late at night.
I want to press full charges.<eos> Yeah, you come over here you son of a bitch.<eos> Get your tail out of here...<eos> Mr. Flanders, charges may be pressed, but not against him.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your prints on a suspicious package is what I'm talking about.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Get your damn hands off me.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> On what charge?
Are we supposed to just walk?<eos> - Where are we gonna go to?<eos> - Back to Tent City, baby.<eos> I hate Tent City.<eos> That Santa Claus-lookin' dude is always trying to make me sit on his lap.<eos> No, we are not going to sleep in tents like Indians and hikers.<eos> I'll find a place for us to squat.<eos> Someplace clean and dry, or at least indoors.<eos> I'm the patriarch of this family, and I will provide.<eos> Patriarch?
- You prove it.<eos> One year with an option to buy.<eos> You can't smoke in here.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Hey, kids!<eos> I need you to show Miss Sylvie the door.<eos> You sick bastard.<eos> Using these kids for your own selfish...<eos> I'll be back!<eos> With the police!
We're trapped in a cabin with a maniac.<eos> I'm surprised you would do that.<eos> No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn't, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season.<eos> Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.<eos> What-- he arrested you for that?<eos> No, he didn't do anything.<eos> So I said, "You just saw me jaywalk. Why aren't you doing your job?" You know?<eos> "M-Maybe I should arrest you for-for impersonating a police officer."<eos> And then you got arrested.<eos> Oh, and how.
No, I'm fine.<eos> Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.<eos> Just drop it.<eos> Okay, I think I see what's happening here.<eos> You're jealous of me.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?<eos> It's not what I have, it's how many people I'm having it with.<eos> Come on, Sheldon, we'll watch Game of Thrones over here.<eos> - Gladly.
If my offer is clearly beneficial, he'll have no choice but to accept.<eos> So much of my time is spent behind a desk now.<eos> Wonderful to be able to just... get out into the open and walk.<eos> Don't you feel the same way, stuck in a classroom all day?<eos> I'm not stuck behind a desk. Oh. (LAUGHS)<eos> But I can certainly see why you like doing this.<eos> I love walking.<eos> I used to do it all the time with...<eos> With...?<eos> Friends.
Suggesting we meet at the house was inspired.<eos> Whenever Adam needed to have a difficult conversation with a parishioner, he always did so in their own home.<eos> It's where they felt most secure. Very disarming.<eos> And I've asked for the boy to be out of the house, so I don't have to see him.<eos> I know you want nothing to do with him, but you can't keep calling him "the boy".<eos> Sounds like you have an axe to grind. I do.<eos> With your deceased husband and his deceased lover.<eos> Not with "the boy" who is the one innocent in all of this.<eos> The one innocent, Sarah?<eos> And you, of course.
We got movement.<eos> Either he likes wearing that suit, or he knew something was gonna happen.<eos> Boss, I got a clean shot of the gas tank for a concussion play, but that makes the lawyer collateral.<eos> Other than that, I have zero vulnerabilities.<eos> Stand down.<eos> Steve, we already lost him once.<eos> Now that he has what he wants, he's gonna disappear for good.<eos> Yeah, but what choice do we have as long as he's wearing that suit?<eos> We got to let him go.<eos> Not this time.
Let's go.<eos> What's up, Chin?<eos> Hey, Steve.<eos> Max's prelim on Hamasaki uncovered something very interesting.<eos> This wasn't the first attempt on his life.<eos> Apparently, he suffered a very serious stab wound to the abdomen two months ago.<eos> That explains why he was in protective custody, right? Mm-hmm.<eos> Corrections is sending over the case file.<eos> Let's look into anybody who had contact with him<eos> - inside or outside of that prison.
Because of my own carelessness, an innocent man died.<eos> There hasn't been a day that's gone by that I haven't thought about it.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Got him.<eos> I wanted to tell his family.<eos> I even wrote the e-mail that I was gonna send.<eos> But you never did, did you?<eos> Sorry.<eos> And now the world will see you for what you really are:<eos> a coward and a liar.
Gerard, who is it?<eos> Uh, no one.<eos> Just a friend.<eos> She's leaving.<eos> Well, tell her to come in.<eos> Uh, she's-she's in a rush, Pop. A rush?<eos> Everyone's always in a rush.<eos> I want to meet her.<eos> Uh, may-maybe another time!<eos> Another time?
We're gonna build our own grassroots, from the ground up.<eos> There aren't 100 different ways to get what we want.<eos> There's only one way.<eos> And what's that?<eos> Our way.<eos> We need a grassroots organization we can create and control.<eos> We'll call it... the One Wayers.<eos> Get on it right away.<eos> Get on what?<eos> Astroturfing.
Your general nature's not in dispute.<eos> Anyway, thanks to you, we now know more than we did a day ago about whoever was behind Emil Kurtz's murder.<eos> And by extension, Dr. Naylor's.<eos> It was the same individual Kurtz was feeding information to during your Colombian oil deal.<eos> Given the timing of his murder, they may have become aware that he was compromised, and decided to tie up a loose end.<eos> And now you want to know to whom did I lose the oil deal?<eos> Come.<eos> This is a matter better discussed behind closed doors.<eos> Watson mentioned she found you at the brownstone the other night.<eos> Unannounced.
- Pree...<eos> We're getting you out of here.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> You don't think I'll do this?<eos> He knows you will.<eos> You'll get us past the guards, maybe even out the door.<eos> But how do you get us through the armed mob outside, Pree?<eos> You know I still would, right?<eos> You, me... blaze of glory.<eos> Some other time.
Uh, no.<eos> Ma'am, did you recently have surgery?<eos> I had a tummy tuck.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Oh, my God, you came in here and you saw me like this.<eos> Hey, we're gonna get you to Chicago Med, all right?<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> He okay?<eos> Yeah, you?
You're not using our baby?<eos> I thought you and Zak could take this room.<eos> Ashley can have the couch.<eos> We don't have a lot of room.<eos> You know, if this is too much trouble...<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Do you see Hawk a lot? - What?<eos> Does he come to your house often?<eos> Once in a while.
Jason could've been the top of his field.<eos> He was first of his class at Yale.<eos> He was a great doctor.<eos> Could have been a great doctor.<eos> His widow, Alison, doesn't believe he committed suicide.<eos> That's because she killed him.<eos> She... she got him involved in that crazy cult.<eos> He wouldn't speak to us once he joined. We were, um...<eos> Ignorant Systemites.<eos> Systemites?
Oh, hey, no worries.<eos> I just wanted to come and wish you both well in person and let you know that I am leaving The Movement.<eos> - You're leaving?<eos> - Yeah. You know, just in case you were still looking for someone to talk to over there.<eos> Why?<eos> Is your whole family leaving?<eos> Uh, no. Just... just me.<eos> I've been... struggling with my faith for a while now.<eos> I'm sorry, I should have told you sooner.<eos> No.
Did you find Gabriel Shaw?<eos> No, he found us, but not before he was fatally stabbed.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> Gabriel Shaw's been here at Peakmore for the last 20 years.<eos> What did he do?<eos> He broke into the house of a man named Warren Crowne, tried to kill him and his entire family.<eos> Warren Crowne the philanthropist?<eos> I remember the headlines.<eos> Didn't his attacker say he was some kind of avenging angel?<eos> The archangel Gabriel... The divine messenger.
Any idea how he might've escaped?<eos> Yes, he, uh, he stole a keycard from one of our orderlies.<eos> Uh, we realized he was missing around noon today.<eos> Noon? Why the hell didn't you call the police before?<eos> We should have. I realize that now.<eos> The man came to my office wielding an ax.<eos> Which is why I sent out a group of orderlies looking for Gabriel.<eos> They searched all day and came back empty-handed.<eos> - Except...<eos> - Except what?
- Who's where?<eos> Castle... He's here.<eos> Who?<eos> I saw his eyes.<eos> It was a demon.<eos> Or someone with night-vision goggles.<eos> Beckett, how much proof do you need before you finally accept the fact that your husband has been marked for death!<eos> Okay, if you were marked for death, then the demon would've killed you.<eos> Instead, you were knocked out by a very human attacker who managed to run off with your...<eos> w-whatever dagger.

Guys?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Te expello, daemon vilis, in abyssum profundissimum Tartari!<eos> Oscar. Castle!<eos> Do something.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> He is the beast.<eos> The lawless one.<eos> The son of perdition.<eos> All bad things.
Stay right here, please.<eos> Tommy.<eos> We know it wasn't you who left the baby out in the cold, okay?<eos> It was your son, Max.<eos> - You're doing this...<eos> - No.<eos> To protect him.<eos> Look, I'm a father.<eos> I... I've done what you're doing, but you think that Max will go away for something... a mistake?<eos> A horrible mistake?
Yeah, I mean, I've never told her but...<eos> You've never told her you loved her?<eos> No.<eos> You got to do that. You got to get on that.<eos> Yeah, oh, no, no, I will, I'm just, uh, waiting for the-the perfect time.<eos> Anyway, so quick divorce, marriage to Todd, impregnation, divorce from Todd, re-marriage to me, birth.<eos> Yeah, well, that's-that's really nice of Todd to do that.<eos> - He's a good dude. Yeah.<eos> Um, uh, you know, I-I-I would've asked you, but, you know, Carol... - is a little...<eos> - Oh, yeah, yeah... - uncomfortable with it.
- Yes! - Okay.<eos> Mike, you brought coleslaw, but it's high 70s out, so we got to eat it fast.<eos> Enough with the friggin' side dishes, Carol.<eos> Get to the main course.<eos> Well, I'm pretty hungry for some fried chicken.<eos> Okay, all right, well, let me, uh, let me grab you some fried chicken...<eos> N-n-n-no, watch that hand.<eos> Ow, ow, ow!<eos> Okay, all right, what... I'm not allowed to touch her?<eos> Only with your penis.
I assisted Dr. Alister in your surgery.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can you try something for me?<eos> Can you try wiggling your fingers?<eos> What about your left hand?<eos> Okay, uh...<eos> Your toes?<eos> I can feel that.<eos> I think that deserves a yay.<eos> Yay.
I trust the reunion was a happy one?<eos> Has she been a hostage of Niflheim all this time?<eos> She is a symbol of the peace.<eos> That's all I'm told.<eos> Doesn't sound like it.<eos> Sounds like she's here for something much bigger than that.<eos> Your orders are to protect her.<eos> Not to look, not to listen, not to think.<eos> Understood?<eos> Drautos.
Well, the Niffs just left for the ceremony.<eos> And she wasn't with them.<eos> - A homing beacon?<eos> - Yeah, I'll send the coordinates now.<eos> Can you pinpoint a location for me?<eos> Sure, but it sounds like a wild-goose chase.<eos> Guess you got some free time on your hands, huh?<eos> Guess I do, for better or worse.<eos> Those coordinates are about 20 miles south of Insomnia.<eos> Outside the Wall.
Give me the ring, and our homes will be free again.<eos> The empire has promised it.<eos> I don't see much of a future on the other side of that promise.<eos> Don't be a fool.<eos> Save your friends.<eos> Give your dead sister peace.<eos> What do you fight for if not that?<eos> Hang on.<eos> This could get bumpy.<eos> Drautos.
Then I remembered the Orlando assembly and the skills we learned.<eos> Let's step in my office.<eos> This is great stuff. Keep going.<eos> Graham Simmons.<eos> This your shop?<eos> Yes and no.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> You run Chicago for Horizons.<eos> So what's that make you?<eos> A life coach?

We need the name of every member Darren signed up.<eos> I'm happy to answer questions, but I won't open our books without a subpoena.<eos> I have responsibilities to our members.<eos> Yeah, well, you want to help us.<eos> Someone killed your friends and three of their kids.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Which one are you, Graham?<eos> Victim or victor?<eos> I'm still working to find out.<eos> Work in progress.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.<eos> Yeah. - Copy that.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Guess it's a party now.<eos> He came in through the back door.<eos> Took the pins out.<eos> Guess this ain't his first rodeo.<eos> Took my tablet computer.<eos> So when was the burglary?<eos> Last night.
Uh, for instance, what'd you have for lunch on Tuesday?<eos> Turkey wrap, avocado, hot sauce.<eos> Same thing every day.<eos> Oh, fantastic.<eos> Jay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, okay, then how about the day you graduated from the academy?<eos> 24-ounce porterhouse, creamed spinach, onion rings.<eos> 24 ounces?<eos> With the bone, sure.
- I know, I know.<eos> - I don't know what to say?<eos> !<eos> - Hey?<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> - Wow, I didn't understand any of that.<eos> Oh God, no.<eos> It's bloody complicated.<eos> Don't worry about it, she just got a little bit jealous 'cause she didn't want you, you know, gettin' too close to Maxine.<eos> And to you.
No.<eos> Not here.<eos> How far to yours?<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry, I... I haven't... I haven't been to see you.<eos> You can come closer.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm still here.<eos> I'm still me.<eos> Still beautiful.
If you give me five minutes<eos> - with Proctor... - Absolutely not.<eos> You are to have no further contact with Proctor or her crew under any circumstances.<eos> Hello, Shayne.<eos> Ferguson is still making plans, okay.<eos> She's meeting contacts.<eos> - What contacts?
He'll be a radio DJ in the future.<eos> If it snows on September 26 and 27, someone send in today's story.<eos> To the person who sends in the story,<eos> I will buy drinks.<eos> 32 years is so far away...<eos> Can't you buy drinks today?<eos> Wait...<eos> They don't even call it a phone.<eos> What do they call it then?<eos> Smartphone.
Dear, I'm a psychiatrist.<eos> You don't have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.<eos> Well, I'd actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favorite books and work our way up to my husband's sex organs.<eos> Very well.<eos> What's the last book you read?<eos> Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?<eos> Penny, it's only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person.<eos> So what can I do to make this process easier for you? Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?<eos> And how does it make you feel when I psychoanalyze everything you say?<eos> Uncomfortable.
I'm happy to hold your place till you get back.<eos> You would do that?<eos> Consider it my way of getting more of your money.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?<eos> Oh, I didn't realize you two work together.<eos> Well, we don't exactly.<eos> I'm a microbiologist for the research team.<eos> Oh, what are you currently developing?<eos> Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.
T.C.'s headed out on the chopper.<eos> Is that the mother?<eos> You ask her yet?<eos> I, uh... I wanted to give her some time.<eos> All right. That's drew.<eos> Brianna's first two antigens matched, so I guess we're gonna need to know now.<eos> Is he in any pain, doc?<eos> He can't feel anything, Mrs. Dawson.<eos> I-I'm sorry to have to ask you this, uh, but is your son an organ donor?<eos> A donor?
Neither was I until I decided to do something about it.<eos> I'll make you a deal, all right?<eos> You get straight b's, I'll buy you a bike. Aah!<eos> My legs... They're burning up.<eos> What's happening?<eos> ! It burns! It burns!<eos> I miss you, too, baby.<eos> Oh, you're so dirty.<eos> Oh, say it again.<eos> With the pink panties?
I assumed he was actually looking for you.<eos> Are you fucking him?<eos> No. - No. - Okay.<eos> ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪<eos> Little louder.<eos> ♪ Happy birthday, dear Val... ♪<eos> Um, these people are here for you, so enjoy your cake.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm going home.<eos> To Drew.
Dr. Choi, would you like to weight in?<eos> It's possible Mr. Coleman is right.<eos> I think we should get a chest CT.<eos> What's the brother's name again?<eos> Griffin.<eos> Wait... wait a second.<eos> I already challenged them on the injury.<eos> Now I walk in with a psychiatrist?<eos> So who're you gonna be?<eos> Still me.
It's not some complex psychological issue.<eos> It's a matter of Mr. Coleman learning how to cope with it.<eos> That's a tall order.<eos> I know.<eos> But it's a problem he can see, you know what I mean?<eos> In a way, isn't it easier to deal with things you can see?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, it's not the father?<eos> In my opinion, no.
- that could have made her sick?<eos> - No-she ate what I ate.<eos> - How old is your daughter?<eos> - She's 16.<eos> She on any medications?<eos> Any medical issues we should know about?<eos> I-I don't think so.<eos> I don't know.<eos> When did this start?<eos> Uh, last night.
Back off, Brian. Back off.<eos> Hey, I want a doctor who knows what he's doing.<eos> You want a new doctor, is that it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A good one.<eos> Okay. I'm done.<eos> Noah showed me some selfies he took with Tate's friends.<eos> I want to strangle him.<eos> Noah or Tate?<eos> Noah.
Unless you're certain, it's bio.<eos> Come on, Maggie.<eos> You know the protocol.<eos> I do.<eos> I've also been through this circus about a dozen times.<eos> JCAHO days are about patient care, not about a pair of latex gloves.<eos> Look, I'm already in the doghouse with Goodwin.<eos> If there's any chance of getting out, I want it.<eos> So by the book... by the book.<eos> By the book.

Do what you have to.<eos> Forgive me, Jehovah.<eos> Why don't you come with me outside?<eos> Right, let's hook him up and get to work.<eos> This is the right thing to do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah. That was Julia.<eos> She needs me to relieve her.<eos> I could bring Owen back here a little later.<eos> Maybe later tonight.
It hasn't always been such a bad thing.<eos> Well, I'm not that young.<eos> I'm almost 26.<eos> So you know, I was thinking, if you guys... You know, your friend's still going out to dinner,<eos> I wouldn't be opposed.<eos> Great, you changed your mind.<eos> Yeah, got hungry.<eos> Well, not too hungry I hope.<eos> My friend's a vegan.<eos> A vegan?
We might have even saved the building.<eos> But you got him out.<eos> I shouldn't be making mistakes anymore.<eos> Look, I'm sure Severide reamed you out, right?<eos> - Look. Honestly, that guy operates on his gut 80% of the time.<eos> He wasn't you in there.<eos> He didn't see what you saw, what you felt.<eos> Sometimes it's your call.<eos> Our job is not black and white.<eos> Whoa, whoa, hey.
Yeah, I know.<eos> Except one thing.<eos> What's that?<eos> When I'm married, you break into my house with flowers and champagne, and then I'm solo, and you just keep a nice, safe distance.<eos> So... I was thinking that we could put the first coat of mud, and let it dry...<eos> - Next coat tomorrow?<eos> - And then... yeah, exactly.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Yeah.<eos> You know, assuming I can ever get this sheet up.<eos> Well, between the two of us?
We saved a life today.<eos> What about you?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I was just thinking that as a chief you do a lot of telling people what to do without actually doing very much yourself.<eos> Anything else?<eos> No.<eos> Leave it open.<eos> Deputy District Chief's Office, please.<eos> It's Wallace Boden.<eos> Chief Tiberg?
We have to.<eos> Not standing here like a bunch of boobs we can't.<eos> Let's go, people.<eos> We're right down the hall from each other.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And here we go.<eos> Senators Reynard and Twigg and Mark Hanson, who's the director of Emergency Management.<eos> Copy.<eos> Director Hanson, you owe me a phone call.<eos> And a Glenlivet on the rocks.
Okay, thank you.<eos> We'll be in touch.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - There you are.<eos> Director Hanson heard you were a golfer.<eos> Wants to invite you out to Medinah.<eos> Good. And the 911 system?<eos> You've got his support, but now you've got to convince the appropriations committee.<eos> Okay.<eos> Chief.
You'd take orders from me?<eos> No.<eos> Just add it to my tab.<eos> Reporting live from an incredibly dire situation happening right now in one of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods.<eos> Behind me, a shelter on the verge of destruction.<eos> Its residents about to be homeless yet again.<eos> But while the fate of the shelter is critical, one local hero has decided to take a stand.<eos> - Fucking Frank!<eos> - Fuck you, Frank!<eos> Idiot.
I'd do her, I'd do her, I'd... well, I'd do anything with two legs.<eos> - I ain't fussy.<eos> - Well? Looking good, Hollywood!<eos> - Hey, Pat. I'm being very sincere here:<eos> these are frigging rad.<eos> Thank you, Tandy.<eos> So, uh, these leg designs... walk me through them.<eos> Well, it's just a general breast theme with cobras.<eos> So, it is what it looks like, huh?<eos> Well... amazing.
- Would you like that, Pat?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Think about your jeans.<eos> 'Cause... you know?<eos> That was sweet of you.<eos> Where have you been all day?<eos> All right, Lewis, start talking.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What's the deal with Pat?<eos> Oh, Pat?
What's the deal with Pat?<eos> Oh, Pat?<eos> Pat is just a... fantastic... constant, just... endless source of...<eos> He's very fun.<eos> He doesn't seem fun. No.<eos> He seems like a solid gold nut.<eos> What? Not my Pat, no.<eos> Something's not adding up here.<eos> It's like a bi-corn.<eos> "A bi-corn"?
Okay, these sutures should hold till we get to the hospital.<eos> Brianna's inhalers.<eos> Did you get them?<eos> They were in the car.<eos> We'll radio the ambulance and have them check.<eos> Tell them that she needs them.<eos> She has cystic fibrosis.<eos> Okay, I'll let them know.<eos> She seems like a good kid.<eos> Pretty cool under pressure.
- Don't worry about it.<eos> - Leon. It's, uh, a small legal hiccup.<eos> It's not...<eos> Did I not tell you that this would happen?<eos> Did I not tell you that this would totally blow up in your face?<eos> We'll take care of it. Who?<eos> You and Leon?<eos> Yeah. Me and Leon.<eos> He's a sound tech.<eos> - Composer.
Yeah.<eos> I want to see the fucking lake.<eos> Then let's see the fucking lake.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yes!<eos> This has to stop.<eos> Yes, things have happened, things that I'm sure you both regret, but we have a company to run.<eos> We have a responsibility to our employees and our users and I will not sit back and watch as you two try to wrestle for control...<eos> I've give you $2.5 million for your ownership stake in Snooger.<eos> Cash.
I also love Ciara and she's a born-again now.<eos> Ah, tapping into a whole new market of confused sexuality.<eos> Whatever gets you radio play.<eos> You still listen.<eos> Of course I listen.<eos> Who doesn't listen?<eos> I listen.<eos> I do too.<eos> Hey, when did you guys start fucking behind my back?<eos> Uh, behind your back?
Previously, on "Casual"... When did you guys start fucking behind my back?<eos> - Behind your back?
He did it with your friend Jennifer.<eos> So? What am I supposed to do?<eos> Should I just watch while you let your ex-girlfriend set up fucking shop in your living room?<eos> No.<eos> You're supposed to help me get her out!<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You've done this to me for 30 years, and for some reason, I let you.<eos> 'Cause I thought it was a sibling duty or something.<eos> But not this time.
Because you requested more time and you're not with him...<eos> - I just don't need to feel constantly guilted, okay?<eos> - Stating a fact<eos> - is not judgment.<eos> I want to say something without you getting mad.<eos> Well, the implication that you can't express your opinion without me getting mad is making me mad.<eos> I-I just... don't want to start this whole thing and have you spin out.<eos> Is this you trying to not make me mad?<eos> I think some sort of custody arrangement might be good for us.<eos> With lawyers?
So, why'd you come back?<eos> Extreme financial duress.<eos> That's not important.<eos> What's important is getting you into college, so come on.<eos> Tell me a little something about you.<eos> What do you like?<eos> I told you.<eos> I like helping homeless people and poor people, and...<eos> And blind people, right.<eos> Besides that.
I don't think your wrist is supposed to move like that.<eos> No, it's been like this since I broke it playing football in high school.<eos> Fine, I petted a horse too hard.<eos> If that woman posts her camera phone video that she took with a camera phone camera to the Internet, Figgis could figure out where we are.<eos> This is your fault.<eos> Or maybe it's your fault for stealing my files. You know what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> We have to get that video.<eos> Can we please just press "pause" on this fight and work together?<eos> Yes, on one condition:
(voice echoes) Dinner's almost ready.<eos> Noah, you are welcome to join us if you'd like.<eos> Oh, thank you, but I got to get home.<eos> Okay.<eos> What is this?<eos> Don't ruin your appetite before dinner, please.<eos> - Do you think she knew?<eos> - No, we're cool.<eos> But, man, you never told me your mom was the po-po.<eos> Po-po?
You're so obvious and you're so afraid of anything real that you'd rather blow yourself up than let anyone else in.<eos> Oh, and you have creepy fucking eyebrows.<eos> So we drop our clubs an... and rush over, uh, the pilot looks all right, but, uh, the plane's leaking fuel, so we undo his straps, pull him out.<eos> He's dazed, obviously, but, um, he's talking, and his voice, I recognize it.<eos> Finally, I realize... it's Harrison Ford.<eos> Makes me think of "Ferris Bueller." I've, uh...<eos> I've never seen it.<eos> You've never seen "Ferris Bueller"? Nope.<eos> - Are you Amish?<eos> - British.
Yeah, in case you get buried alive.<eos> That would literally be the most useless thing I could think of in that situation.<eos> What about a can opener?<eos> At least you can try and bust out with a can opener.<eos> Mm, I'd rather have a massager.<eos> Oh, here.<eos> Smile.<eos> Oh, shit, you know what'd be funny?<eos> If you were my social media steward.<eos> - Your what?
Oh, my God, how funny would that be?<eos> - I guess.<eos> - Like, six months after I die, you post a picture of me coming out of a coffin like,<eos> "Guess who's back, bitches?"<eos> And geotag everything from the cemetery, that way it feels authentic.<eos> We should make some Vines in this thing.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Hey, come on.<eos> I'm not gonna be some stupid social media manager.<eos> - Steward.
Well, what happened?<eos> Where's my train, General?<eos> Today is not the day to screw with me.<eos> Shoot him!<eos> He doesn't work for you anymore.<eos> I changed my mind.<eos> Shoot him instead.<eos> I suggest you put down your weapons.<eos> Lieutenant Burk, please arrest Mr. Castillo and prepare him for transport to back to the James.<eos> With pleasure, sir.
And Chris was afraid of his dad, too.<eos> So, could I see a man like Roger Nelms holding his 16-year-old son's feet to the fire till Chris caved and admitted what he had done?<eos> Now that's more likely to me than Chris keeping a lie going under those same conditions.<eos> But now it's just a guess.<eos> Did Foulkes share with you any part of his conversation with Roger Nelms?<eos> He did not.<eos> He said, "Let's just hold off on talking to Chris officially.<eos> Keep him in our back pocket and wait and see if Holden would, um ..."<eos> Cave?<eos> In a word, yes.
I'm mad for you.<eos> You've un-bored me.<eos> You've given me, if not hope, hope for hope.<eos> You've given me strength, courage.<eos> No.<eos> You already had courage.<eos> You wouldn't have made it this far if you didn't.<eos> And I couldn't even imagine, in some way, being a part of that little miracle thing inside your belly.<eos> You could be the weird uncle.<eos> The good, weird Uncle Dan.
I hear you, honey.<eos> Do you?<eos> Because you will always be disappointed if you try to live through me.<eos> And I will be a disappointment to you.<eos> Have you and Daniel been talking to each other?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Is that what you feel when you're around me?<eos> My disappointment in you.<eos> Mm, not always, but... sometimes.
Yep, I just might bring the family car by and get me a set of tires.<eos> Well, you better hurry up.<eos> Tomorrow's the last day.<eos> Dadgum.<eos> Creeps up on you, doesn't it?<eos> It does.<eos> You go easy, now.<eos> You still think he did it, Carl?<eos> Like you used to?<eos> Between me and you and these tires...
A certain Dee Holden.<eos> All I'm saying.<eos> Sometimes I dream I'm in a car.<eos> What kind?<eos> An old Caddy.<eos> I like that.<eos> Who you riding with?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> - Come on, man!<eos> The Kerwin Whitman.
Hello, Daniel.<eos> Hello, Tawney.<eos> I pray for you, Daniel, every day.<eos> Might be working.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Mm, I'm... I'm looking forward to my life, maybe for the first time in my life.<eos> That's good to hear, Tawney.<eos> How about you?<eos> I'm, um...<eos> Cautiously optimistic.
- Yeah. - You headed to AP English?<eos> - Yeah, in a sec. You?<eos> - Yeah, totally.<eos> Hey, so, uh... keep this on the down low, but Emma's throwing this surprise party for Kieran's birthday tonight.<eos> It is super secret, but I think I could swing bringing a guest.<eos> Um... Cool!<eos> You should totally do that.<eos> Okay. Yeah, I will.<eos> He'll pick you up at 6:30.<eos> - So, 7:00?
See, man, this is what happens when you buy condoms in bulk.<eos> You have babies in bulk!<eos> Oh, I can't breathe!<eos> Well, isn't this just perfect?<eos> Sam and I are finally together, and now our next date is gonna be dinner, movie, and an ultrasound.<eos> But what about me, man?<eos> "Oh, hey, Renee, I wasn't sure "what to get you for our one-month anniversary, so I got you a baby!"<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I guess we'll just have to tell them.<eos> No, about my breathing!
Could I please have some water?<eos> Have you, erm remembered more in regard to the other charges?<eos> No.<eos> It will look bad if you stop answering now. Erm... just be careful what you say. So at that point you were left alone with Susan Harper?<eos> Yes.<eos> What happened then?<eos> I suggested that she tried something, erm, a bit more exciting than the sex that she'd had with David.<eos> What?<eos> I'd been experimenting.<eos> With?
Exhibit 132.<eos> I've never seen these before.<eos> - You admit it's you?<eos> - He admits no such thing.<eos> Experimenting like that, with sexual asphyxiation.<eos> Is that the sort of behaviour you involved Susan Harper in?<eos> I advise you not to answer that question.<eos> Yes.<eos> How?<eos> Specifically.
It's in the hallway right now. Yeah, I'll-I'll go... I'll go get the... the bread maker and bring it inside, in one piece, safe and sound.<eos> I love you so much, I got to go.<eos> Bread maker!<eos> This was shipped like this so we are gonna need a new one.<eos> You obviously broke this yourself.<eos> You obviously broke it yourself.<eos> Yup.<eos> No. You crushed it with your mind.<eos> - Okay, you're calling me a witch? - No, no, no,<eos> - A sorceress,
- He's developed another tremor... This time, in his left hand.<eos> Okay.<eos> We did DBS to treat your right-hand tremor.<eos> I'm worried he's developed a new lesion on the other side of his brain.<eos> Okay, Kyle, let's get you changed into a gown. We'll do a full work-up.<eos> DeLuca, let's do an MRI, evoked potentials.<eos> Edwards, a word.<eos> I didn't realize you two were a thing.<eos> Oh, we're not.<eos> Not a... not a thing, thing.
My custody trial is starting soon, and I'm wondering if...<eos> We'll testify in court for you?<eos> Y... You know what?<eos> Just think about it.<eos> - Absolutely, Callie.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> No, 'cause I know that you and Arizona are friends, too,<eos> - and so I'm just...<eos> - Callie, absolutely.<eos> - Dr. Torres?
Infections have a nasty way of sneaking up on you.<eos> You're feeling pretty good, you think the infection's gone, and then it reappears... out of nowhere... when your body's still weak, when you've barely recovered...<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What's all this?<eos> - Sold it.<eos> I'm done with it.<eos> - With the trailer?
- Long engagements... bad idea.<eos> I agree.<eos> Better to go straight to the, uh, marriage part.<eos> It's better.<eos> Would you get married again?<eos> I'd consider it, with the right person.<eos> - You would?<eos> - I'd strongly consider it, yes.<eos> Me too.<eos> - With the right person.
- Who's moving out?<eos> - Amelia, when she marries Owen Hunt and moves into his big, new, kid-friendly house.<eos> No, no.<eos> Okay, hang on.<eos> It was a hypothetical conversation. That is it.<eos> In which you were picking out hypothetical furniture for your hypothetical children's hypothetical playroom. - Wow.<eos> - It... it was nothing.<eos> - Can we drop it, please?<eos> - Why?<eos> Gladly.

I think we do.<eos> Why aren't we doing it?<eos> Why aren't we building our life?<eos> I don't want to waste our time on conversations or some hypothetical lives someday.<eos> I want a real life... and I want it with you.<eos> Are you asking me to marry you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - We're not talking about the fake married.<eos> We're talking about the real married.<eos> Real...

I'm sorry. I, uh...<eos> I must have gotten lost.<eos> Good night.<eos> You don't think you deserve any of the blame for what happened with your mother?<eos> That's between her and Dad.<eos> Then whose fault is it?<eos> Well, I suppose none of this would have happened if Amenadiel had been watching over Hell like he was supposed to.<eos> I thought that was your job.<eos> Well, it was, but when I abdicated, it became his.<eos> Sort of like a game of hot potato.
Hello.<eos> My name is Lucifer Morningstar and I... love drugs.<eos> Love them! Mmm!<eos> Yummy, yummy, yummy.<eos> Can't get enough.<eos> And... I've got lots of money... mmm, that I love spending on drugs. Not even picky.<eos> I'll do any of them.<eos> Mix them together sometimes.<eos> You ever done a he-she? No?<eos> A neon nod?
- His second wife. He grabbed my hair and pulled me to the floor.<eos> I screamed. Fought. Begged for him to stop.<eos> So you didn't rape her?<eos> Oh... Hollis loves him some women. And, boy, do women love them some Hollis.<eos> In all my years, not a one of them fillies ever needed an arm twist to roll in my hay.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> This can't be.<eos> His numbers went up?<eos> Five points in some polls.<eos> How the hell?
Am I right?<eos> So, we got a deal?<eos> We got a deal.<eos> Now see this?<eos> You, I got no problem with.<eos> I've been waiting here an hour. I have meetings. I do run a country.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I went to see Hollis.<eos> - You what?<eos> ! - Behind my back?
Behind me, the splendid Grant Arena.<eos> Named for the famous general, not the man-child that's been soiling his pants at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for the last eight years.<eos> The question for both parties this week...<eos> Who will the two candidates, Frankie Vargas and Mellie Grant, pick to be their respective vice presidents?<eos> Cut.<eos> Let's make this fast.<eos> I know it's hard for you to believe, but I have more important things to do than expunge your speeding tickets.<eos> How would you like to be Frankie Vargas' running mate?<eos> You said make it fast.<eos> Vice President? Vice president.
My take... my take... my take is that he's a soulless, dead-eyed monster who murdered the love of my life in cold blood.<eos> My take is that Jake Ballard is a traitor to the nation I've spent my life loving and serving.<eos> My take is that Jake Ballard is Moloch, Abbedon, Leviathan, a serpent coiled at the feet of his master Satan himself.<eos> What do you think about Jake Ballard for VP?<eos> I think he'd be great.<eos> David.<eos> - I'm busy.<eos> - Doing what?<eos> - I'm working.<eos> - On what?

Of course. I'm happy to be there for all of my students, especially after what happened with Jake.<eos> I know you two had a special relationship.<eos> Yeah, well, this isn't about Jake.<eos> Not entirely, at least.<eos> I just...<eos> Well, I know you're really good at all of this personal psychology stuff, so I thought maybe you could help me out with this.<eos> I... was with another man the night that Jake died.<eos> I was with Mr. Branson.<eos> And I'm just feeling really guilty about it.<eos> Seth Branson?
- What?<eos> - The Russian kid.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Anton!<eos> Anton!<eos> Anton!<eos> Anton: Why?<eos> Where is it?<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> The Tall Man.
Ain't that some shit?<eos> So, here's what's up...<eos> You tell me where your old man at... or you turn into gator food.<eos> It'll makes no difference to me.<eos> I know I'mma get that shit eventually.<eos> When I'm done with you... I'm goin' right on down the line.<eos> Every sorry-ass bitch you care about, right down to the nigga that does your dry cleaning.<eos> You, I'll probably shoot you at the back of the head right there.<eos> Just be done with it.<eos> But your loved ones?
Oh, I don't know.<eos> I'm pretty busy canceling projects for no good reason.<eos> I am so sorry a-about reacting.<eos> I'm not the one you need to apologize to, but thank you.<eos> I'll also apologize to the secretary.<eos> You know, my job is to write things for other people, which... which I love, you know, and I think I'm pretty good at.<eos> I would agree.<eos> But it's like being a songwriter in Nashville.<eos> There's always someone else singing my song.<eos> Sometimes...
I was told that you were dead.<eos> But he did not...<eos> Yes, but I was told this.<eos> I will talk to her, my word on it.<eos> I do not see an animal, Nathaniel.<eos> And what if we left this place?<eos> Robin, as well.
I'm gonna be stuck in this hood forever.<eos> Two arson victims, a 35-year-old heart attack, and a projectile-vomiting three-year-old, and it's not even five o'clock.<eos> How's your stain coming?<eos> Gonna need something stronger than baby wipes.<eos> That kid got you good.<eos> It's not my first time wearing projectile vomit.<eos> Usually there's cheap beer and fists involved.<eos> We're all hittin' up the bar after work.<eos> - You want to come? - No, I'm supposed to meet up with a new friend later.<eos> A new friend?
All right, hide a transfer beta where they won't see it.<eos> Now.<eos> Screw you, Rocky.<eos> Mr. Gallagher, we didn't find any African lineage in your strand.<eos> Wait, rea... Are you sure?<eos> But we did find 33.5% Native American ancestry traceable to the Apache tribe.<eos> You mean I'm an Indian?<eos> And, Mr. Winslow, your DNA test reveals 22% Irish traceable to the Puritans.<eos> What?<eos> As in Pilgrims?
What's it do?<eos> - We'll find a use for it.<eos> Listen to me, Ren.<eos> I'm sorry, but it has to be this way.<eos> She didn't tie your legs back up.<eos> Do you know you're still on Torus payroll?<eos> Torus didn't want word getting out that you disappeared with their most valuable possession.<eos> Whatever the hell that is.<eos> What's that thing run on, anyway?<eos> Love.
You idiots scared the shit out of me.<eos> You're four hours early.<eos> Cuz is dead.<eos> He got electrocuted by some crazy machine in the garage.<eos> Grimm.<eos> -Did you fuck him?<eos> -No.<eos> The plan, remember?<eos> -Get Renton to let his guard down.<eos> -Yeah, but not your guard.
Listen, you might think you're my father, but you're not, okay?<eos> I know that, God damn it.<eos> No, no, I don't think you do.<eos> Oh, wow. Oh, hey. Thought I'd get a jump-start on the day.<eos> Great.<eos> So Los Gatos Cafe?<eos> I'm really jonesing for that eggs Benedict.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know. The kids will be home soon.<eos> Rain check?
So who breaks the bottleneck?<eos> We are going to create a regional network right there.<eos> The past... the past is a bunch of fortresses all closed off from the rest of the world.<eos> We don't have to build a faster computer or dream up the next killer application.<eos> That's what you do in a fortress.<eos> We are going to pave a road between them.<eos> And you're going to ask the board to go deeper in the hole on something that may never turn a dime?<eos> I don't care what the board thinks anymore.<eos> Money is just a side effect.<eos> Glasnost.
Well, I appreciate it. I really need some time away from Cameron.<eos> And I just need one damn hour of peace, okay?<eos> - The girls think this place is... - Oh, my God.<eos> - Donna!<eos> - Babe, I'm so sorry.<eos> - Which one do you want?<eos> - This one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who you talking to?<eos> Just some guys.
I've been dealing with it for about a year.<eos> They... they found very small areas of atrophy.<eos> So technically it's degenerative, but...<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> - So you're dying?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I'm not dying.<eos> I mean, we're all... we're all dying, but, no, it's under control.<eos> I'm taking medication and most days I'm fine.<eos> Other days...
And the FM is way up here on the top.<eos> You follow?<eos> Man, Gordon, I got to be honest.<eos> I didn't know what you were doing in here, but this is pretty rad.<eos> You really think so?<eos> I mean, it's kind of silly.<eos> No, no, I mean it. I think it's cool.<eos> Yeah, well, I wish Donna shared your enthusiasm.<eos> You know, I hope you realize what a rare thing you've done.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - You and Donna.
- Jerret? Fuck that.<eos> Motherfuck that.<eos> And why the hell would I buy myself out of a job?<eos> Because if you're the team's only deep threat, you're gonna see double coverage the entire season.<eos> Double coverage ain't got shit on Alonzo Cooley.<eos> This is true. I agree, but you two work better as a pair.<eos> Look at Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant up in Pittsburg.<eos> That's one.<eos> Hey, they had career years together, though.<eos> - And what about A.B. and Wallace?
Wow, I can't wait to hear this.<eos> Let me guess, you're a human trafficker.<eos> No, no, no, no, you're an assassin.<eos> I lost a lot of money in a very bad deal, okay?<eos> Back when Andre was managing it.<eos> I tried to keep it under wraps, but he's been fucking lording it over me ever since we stole Sizzle.<eos> Okay, so you lost some money.<eos> So what? It happens to everybody.<eos> Joe, it was $6 million.<eos> Oh, my... in one shot?
Yeah, it just came out of left field.<eos> Well, it's unfortunate because we are in the service business and the best guy to service that business is, of course, Spencer Strasmore.<eos> And I'm big enough to not take that personally.<eos> Well, you shouldn't.<eos> It's just that when he goes, your clients are gonna panic and they're either gonna follow him or go elsewhere, and they will take their money with them.<eos> Hence, my offer is what it is.<eos> Hence, my answer is no.<eos> Don't kid yourself, I will sell ASM and I will get what I'm asking for.<eos> Is that the, uh, hot wax to nipples or the 15 mil?<eos> - Both.
Why you hassling me?<eos> I got a job, my own place, doing things right.<eos> Were you in the liquor store on Riverside and Junction yesterday morning?<eos> Nope.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause it's just around the corner from your place.<eos> It's got to be your local spot.<eos> I know it, but I wasn't in it yesterday morning.<eos> Then where was you yesterday morning?<eos> With my parole officer.
Come on, Raintree, tell me the truth:<eos> when you were flying those commercial buses, how many times you fall asleep on the job, huh?<eos> You give a man a hot meal, a comfy chair, an autopilot...<eos> I defy anyone not to take a nap.<eos> Man, I knew it!<eos> Yeah, I like flying, buddy.<eos> That's why I like this. Less sleeping, more piloting.<eos> I don't miss the heavies.<eos> Except maybe the flight attendants.
Take a whole stack of pencils.<eos> That's how strong we are!<eos> That's how strong I am!<eos> This is the type of insanity I have to deal with with the Democrats.<eos> Listen, we have hundreds of e-mails telling us to hold the line.<eos> I want... I want to show you.<eos> Gareth. Do you have the e-mails from the One Wayers?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What?<eos> What?
Oh, hey, I didn't want to...<eos> Just thought I'd leave this with you.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's just information on...<eos> Information on...?<eos> Don't worry about it. I'll get it to you later.<eos> Hey, uh, Laurel, I'm gonna head out, but I'll take care of this.<eos> Good. Thanks.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.
- No, no, uh, before that, you said something about links?<eos> Yes. On the Web site, to bomb-making materials.<eos> It's stuff you can find online now, but it's good to resource it all in one place.<eos> Why do you need links to bomb-making materials?<eos> For the people who don't know how to make them.<eos> It's all legal.<eos> Why do we... need bombs?<eos> To defend our country.<eos> From who?<eos> - "Whom."

Second.<eos> All those in favor of the 15-minute time limit.<eos> - Aye.<eos> - Aye.<eos> Aye.<eos> - Call the question.<eos> - Second.<eos> I did not seek them out; they came to me.<eos> And these folks are patriotic Americans from all over the country who came to Washington to let their voices be heard.<eos> Same with the No Wayers.
The urban corn harvest. Learning Portuguese.<eos> You joined that SoulShred gym and got scary ripped.<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> Okay. All right.<eos> She's a badass, that is what is going on with her.<eos> Woodworking is awesome.<eos> Okay, woodworking is insane.<eos> - It's woodturning, but go on.<eos> - Honey, do you think that any of these hobbies have anything to do with...<eos> With Nick? Nicholas Miller?

Hey, Kumiko.<eos> Can I have a minute of your time?<eos> I enjoyed our special time today.<eos> I haven't taken my pants off in front of a woman in quite some time.<eos> I'm sorry that the pretzel fell out.<eos> That was unexpected.<eos> I honestly don't know how long it was in my underpants, and that was disturbing to me.<eos> Thank you for not overreacting to it.<eos> I'm here to talk about money.<eos> American currency.
Are you smiling or are you farting?<eos> You look hot. - Thanks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You look amazing. Thank you.<eos> How's the job?<eos> Um... you know.<eos> No idea.<eos> It's fun.<eos> Hard.<eos> Confusing. Oh.
I guess, mainly...<eos> I just wanted to meet you.<eos> See if the Rayburns were actually real... or if they were just another lie my dad told me.<eos> You can't just come into people's lives and expect them to embrace you, especially when they know so very little about you.<eos> Look, bro, I haven't talked to my mom in a year.<eos> I don't know where she's living, or if she's living.<eos> A few months ago my dad got in touch with me... started sending me money.<eos> Sending you money where?<eos> Well, I didn't have my own address, so he sent it to his place.<eos> In Miami.
Always.<eos> - You're scaring me, man.<eos> - You don't have to be scared.<eos> Kevin, you just gotta be smart, man.<eos> You just gotta be smart.<eos> That's it.<eos> What if somebody saw us?<eos> - Saw us where?<eos> - Miami.<eos> Danny's apartment.
- You know nothing about me.<eos> - Your best friend, Gina Crawford, works at a Starbucks in Cambridge where you tried to convert her to Islam - between skinny caramel macchiatos.<eos> - You know nothing.<eos> Are there more bombs?<eos> More bombers?<eos> You sent Gina a text right after the bombing that said, "A lot more people are killed every day in Syria and other places.<eos> Innocent people."<eos> Did you see the footage on television?<eos> We found explosive residue from the bombs in your apartment.<eos> On your kitchen table. In your kitchen sink.
Honey, I'm gonna have a smoke.<eos> - Just gonna be right here, okay?<eos> - No, no, come on. Come on, get your foot in.<eos> The roller's outta the hull.<eos> - Came loose from the cover.<eos> - It's gonna ruin the hull. - Come on.<eos> It'll just take me one second, okay? - I'm just gonna run out and fix it.<eos> - They'll shoot you! You're not allowed to be out there!<eos> Sir! I just got a call. Someone thinks they saw someone suspicious hide in a boat down the street.<eos> - In a boat? - A boat.
I just feel bad.<eos> You have a lot weighing you down, don't you?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> You need more support.<eos> Going to EST, not telling Elizabeth?<eos> You need her.<eos> Being dishonest with her is like being dishonest with yourself.<eos> And there's a limit to how much progress you can make if you are not honest about what's going on in your own life.<eos> I'm just gonna borrow your...<eos> Sir?
Because as it turns out, you can suck at a game, but be killing it in business.<eos> Look, Tess, there are a lot of good consultants, but Marty?<eos> Marty's a mad genius.<eos> Look, Green Point's at a critical juncture. But with Marty's guidance, you could end up a billionaire.<eos> Or do you not want to end up a billionaire?<eos> Don't tell him, don't tell him what I was gonna say!<eos> Uh, Jeannie's in the other room feeding the baby.<eos> And we are on our way to Angeles Crest Highway to watch the meteor shower.<eos> Really?<eos> At 11:45, huh?
I see the people I'm responsible to.<eos> I mean, is that the movie of my spirit?<eos> The fucking to-do list?<eos> This guy's not thinking about his to-do list.<eos> Yeah, these two right here?<eos> Definitely not thinking about the job.<eos> Oh, wait, now this crazy motherfucker, yeah, he's probably thinking about the job, but not in the same way that I'm thinking about the job.<eos> All right, I got to close this motherfucker.<eos> So let's do this shit.<eos> Gnome.
We're not going to the armory.<eos> We need our vehicles back at the quarry. All of us drive.<eos> We'll need to round 'em up. We leave, we come back.<eos> But Judith... to the quarry and back, I...<eos> I'll take her.<eos> Keep her safe in my church until you all lead the walkers away.<eos> Can you do this? I'm supposed to.<eos> I have to.<eos> I will.<eos> All right.
Well, you're welcome to join us overseas anytime.<eos> We'd love to have you.<eos> Thanks, but I prefer the comforts of home.<eos> Though, I wouldn't mind swapping jets with you, every once in a while.<eos> [Laughs] Not a chance.<eos> [Laughs] What took you so long?<eos> Says the girl who had a huge head start. Huh?<eos> I think that's a new record for both of us.<eos> [Alert beeps] It's Jack. I think we got a case.<eos> Yeah, Thailand.
Hello, lovely.<eos> We got the basics. Fill us in, Monty.<eos> Okay. Laura and Sarah's parents are on their way in from Ohio.<eos> They confirmed the girls signed up for a volunteer farming organization and left the U.S. right after graduation.<eos> Volunteering on farms is like the millennials' version of backpacking across Europe.<eos> These programs have been around since the 1970s.<eos> Yeah, but they haven't really caught up with the times. There's no background checks for hosts or volunteers.<eos> Not exactly the safest choice.<eos> Their cell phones stopped transmitting signals - 48 hours ago.<eos> - What time?

I will cut your dick off and I will stir my champagne with it.<eos> Skip Galweather offers to buy K and A, and you don't think to tell me that?<eos> You were still working at Davis/Dexter.<eos> Oh, that's beside the point.<eos> That is a huge decision that has implications on the financial well-being of our child. Remember her?<eos> Well, if she's so high up on your list, maybe you wouldn't move her to Venice Beach, right?<eos> - You can always sell your loft... - Further away from her father. - And move closer to us, okay?<eos> - That's a great idea, isn't it?<eos> Hi, I'm not a "I told you so" kind of guy, but you did have a shot to give me and Sarah the baby.<eos> Anyway.
Did someone power wash your windows?<eos> I don't know what you are talking about...<eos> I'm just saying the janitor really went to town in here...<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> There is nothing going on around here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just a little "hangry."<eos> Hey, everyone.
Okay.<eos> I need a stapler.<eos> You stay.<eos> Hey. So here we are.<eos> All right, Nick, I'll sign it.<eos> I don't want to hurt Schmidt, and right now, he's probably just crying his eyes out at the...<eos> I really appreciate you keeping the store open for me late, Maurice.<eos> That denim bar is like his temple.<eos> He legitimately wants us to get married there.<eos> - At a denim bar?
Look, you don't have to sign this thing.<eos> It's stupid.<eos> The last page is just obscene drawings of cartoon princesses.<eos> I saw them; you're very talented.<eos> What they're doing is disgusting, but I think the drawings are nice.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Look, if I'm being honest, yeah, I feel a little jealous.<eos> You know, Schmidt and I used to hang out all the time, and now we don't, and it's weird.<eos> I mean, to be honest, I think I was a little... jealous, too.<eos> - Of me?
Grab a couple cups. Come on.<eos> Let's go! Let's go.<eos> It's going to be hard to settle the issue of what's in this...<eos> Gin or vodka?<eos> I'm sure it's a very subtle mix, so don't jump to any judgments.<eos> I'm sorry I brought up your husband.<eos> I have thin skin.<eos> It's okay.<eos> People in Texas... They're not exactly welcoming to a divorcée.<eos> In Maine neither.
Good night, Daddy.<eos> Don't let the bedbugs bite.<eos> She's growing up real fast.<eos> Miss you.<eos> Hey!<eos> ...head up the stairs.<eos> Check in the bedrooms.<eos> Check in the kid's bedroom.<eos> I don't care.<eos> All right?
This is 23 Kingsbury Green, not Grove.<eos> Look, on the table behind you, there's a utility bill.<eos> It says 23 Kingsbury Green on it.<eos> Look at it.<eos> The utility bill!<eos> Look at it!<eos> I told you, man.<eos> 23 Kingsbury Green.<eos> Please, just don't hurt my daughter.<eos> All right?
- Daddy, don't go!<eos> - I got you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's all over.<eos> - Did they hurt you?<eos> - No.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - I'm sure.<eos> I gotta make a phone call, sweetie.<eos> Okay?
Here you go.<eos> Better all be there.<eos> Go for champagne.<eos> Off you go.<eos> Fucking machine.<eos> You all right, sweetheart?<eos> Not so fast.<eos> Get 'em in.<eos> Get...<eos> All right.
Where are we?<eos> We're just staying at this farmhouse, just for tonight.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> What?<eos> I'm scared.<eos> No.<eos> Hey.<eos> You haven't got to be scared.<eos> I'm here, and I'm not going to let anything happen to you.<eos> Okay?
You can't think like that.<eos> She's dead because of me, Ray.<eos> No, it was Cooper who did that, not you.<eos> That car bomb was meant for me.<eos> I'm the one that should be dead, not her.<eos> You know, when I met Emma, I was so deep into that world that I didn't even recognize myself anymore.<eos> But she was the one thing that reminded me of who I actually am.<eos> Now Carly's the only thing that reminds me of who she was.<eos> If I can't protect her, then what?<eos> You good?

Bullshit.<eos> You don't know where she is.<eos> Impressive.<eos> You know, Detective Quinn was quite talkative until I put a bullet in him.<eos> Old Oak Farm.<eos> That's where little Carly is, isn't it?<eos> You guys from the embassy?<eos> Yes. We'll take it from here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.
Please don't hurt my dad.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm okay, sweetie.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Come here.<eos> I love you.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> Okay?
If you care about anyone, M...<eos> There is a price, Morgan, and you're gonna pay it.<eos> I have, and I can't anymore.<eos> Think we could do it? What?<eos> What they did, Glenn and Maggie?<eos> Just asking if you could do that.<eos> If you're doing something as big as that... if that's living.<eos> Could you?<eos> I could.<eos> Now.
Adam's dead.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> He was killed on the site today.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> An accident?<eos> !<eos> That's what they say.<eos> Does anyone know?<eos> What?
And take Sayyad with you.<eos> Why?<eos> Cos he's a TDC, Derek.<eos> "T" stands for trainee, not something you send him out to buy, all right?<eos> Right, come on.<eos> Get your coat.<eos> The new building known as The Scimitar has been controversial since it was given the go-ahead earlier this year.<eos> 'Police and health and safety officials have closed down the entire project 'following the death of an unnamed construction worker yesterday.'<eos> Where's the foreman?<eos> In the office.
I have a bedsit on the top floor.<eos> You don't drink?<eos> I gave it up.<eos> Booze is what got me into trouble in the first place.<eos> You were a... alcoholic?<eos> Shoplifting in an off-licence, that was the first time I got nicked.<eos> I thought I was your first time?<eos> No, you were the first one who put me inside.<eos> So where have you been all these years?<eos> Back up north.
Well, do they want to be arrested for obstruction?<eos> He wants to be arrested?<eos> He wants to talk.<eos> All right.<eos> He wants a drink first, though.<eos> No, I can't drink.<eos> I've got to keep a clear head.<eos> Cos I'm working. I've got an OP.<eos> When do you start?<eos> Midnight.
You don't have to say that.<eos> I know I don't have to say that.<eos> So many things I wanna tell you.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Hey Abby, I'm late for class. Can I call you back?<eos> Yeah, I just wanted to let you know I'm coming to town.<eos> When?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> What time?
Sorry, I got stuck in traffic.<eos> Is there any way I can make up the test?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> You have ten minutes.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Now I'm paying you to get me proprietary information.<eos> What part of that isn't fucking clear?<eos> Get me some useful information.<eos> Hi.<eos> You alright?
Just stay close.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just stay on channel six.<eos> Don't do anything stupid.<eos> Hey, guys, wait up.<eos> Wait up!<eos> "Which polymers occur naturally?"<eos> Starch and cellulose.<eos> Mmm. "In a molecule of CH4, the hydrogen atoms are spatially oriented<eos> -towards the centers of--"
He can use the Force to move things with his mind, like this.<eos> Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory.<eos> Look, he has a speaker in his mouth so he can roar.<eos> Oh, these are all my science fair trophies.<eos> We got first every year.<eos> Except for last year when we got third.<eos> Mr. Clarke said it was totally political.<eos> You know Will?<eos> Did you see him?<eos> Last night?

Don't make any noise, and don't leave.<eos> If you get hungry, eat Dustin's snacks, okay?<eos> - Michael!<eos> - Coming!<eos> You know those power lines?<eos> -Power lines? -Yeah.<eos> The ones behind my house?<eos> Yes.<eos> Meet us there, after school.<eos> After school?
If you get hungry, eat Dustin's snacks, okay?<eos> - Michael!<eos> - Coming!<eos> You know those power lines?<eos> -Power lines? -Yeah.<eos> The ones behind my house?<eos> Yes.<eos> Meet us there, after school.<eos> After school?<eos> Yeah, 3:15.
- What else is there to do?<eos> What was Will saying?<eos> Like home... but dark?<eos> And empty.<eos> Empty and cold.<eos> Wait, did he say cold?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The stupid radio kept going in and out.<eos> It's like riddles in the dark.<eos> Like home.
Like home... but dark?<eos> And empty.<eos> Empty and cold.<eos> Wait, did he say cold?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The stupid radio kept going in and out.<eos> It's like riddles in the dark.<eos> Like home.<eos> Like his house?<eos> Or maybe like Hawkins.
And empty.<eos> Empty and cold.<eos> Wait, did he say cold?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The stupid radio kept going in and out.<eos> It's like riddles in the dark.<eos> Like home.<eos> Like his house?<eos> Or maybe like Hawkins.<eos> Upside down.

The stupid radio kept going in and out.<eos> It's like riddles in the dark.<eos> Like home.<eos> Like his house?<eos> Or maybe like Hawkins.<eos> Upside down.<eos> -What'd she say?<eos> -Upside down.<eos> - What?<eos> - Upside down.
Do you understand what he's talking about?<eos> - No.<eos> - Guys, come on, think about it.<eos> When El took us to find Will, she took us to his house, right?<eos> Yeah. And he wasn't there.<eos> But what if he was there?<eos> What if we just couldn't see him?<eos> What if he was on the other side?<eos> What if this is Hawkins and... this is where Will is?<eos> The Upside Down.
In real life, dummy.<eos> We can't shadow walk, but... maybe she can.<eos> Do you know how we get there?<eos> To the Upside Down?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Hey, kid.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here tonight.<eos> - On the couch.
I'm just saying. How do we know when we get to the gate?<eos> Uh, I think a portal to another dimension is gonna be pretty obvious.<eos> Do you think she's acting weird?<eos> You're asking if the weirdo is acting weird?<eos> I mean, weirder than normal?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who cares?<eos> How far, Papa?<eos> Farther than we've ever gone before.<eos> -The bath?
Do you think she's acting weird?<eos> You're asking if the weirdo is acting weird?<eos> I mean, weirder than normal?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who cares?<eos> How far, Papa?<eos> Farther than we've ever gone before.<eos> -The bath?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Yes, the bath.
-Shut up!<eos> Jeez.<eos> So this is it, huh?<eos> Princess' castle.<eos> I'll just be a minute.<eos> Look, we gotta go through this again.<eos> -I told you everything that I saw. -Oh, gosh.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> -Upstairs or downstairs?<eos> -Upstairs.
-Yeah, that's the one.<eos> Was, uh, started in the '50s.<eos> By the time Terry got involved, it was supposed to be ramping down, but the drugs just got crazier.<eos> Messed her up good.<eos> This was the CIA that ran this?<eos> You and Terry would've gotten along.<eos> "The Man," with a big capital "M."<eos> They'd pay... you know, a couple hundred bucks to people like my sister, give 'em drugs, psychedelics. LSD, mostly.<eos> And then they'd strip her naked and put her in these isolation tanks.<eos> - Isolation tanks? - Yeah.
You all right?<eos> - What's going on? - Whoa.<eos> - What happened? What happened?<eos> - I don't know. I don't know.<eos> Hey, you all right?<eos> Relax, relax. Honey, honey.<eos> Honey, just breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe.<eos> In and out. Slow, slow, slow.<eos> In and out with me. In...<eos> - You okay? - Yeah.
I'll be right back.<eos> Okay.<eos> He's washing his hands?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> Very good, Mom.<eos> Hey, Mom. Did Will tell you about, uh, the game?<eos> - Oh, yeah. - No.<eos> What game?
They've pulled out one of their teams.<eos> Well, that's something.<eos> If they went public right now, it could be the end of us.<eos> We wouldn't want that.<eos> Precisely.<eos> STEFAN: How are we gonna do this?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I've never done an interrogation.<eos> Um... (CLEARS HIS THROAT) It's easy.<eos> All right?
- They want us to know what happened.<eos> Yes?<eos> This is Bruce Lockwood.<eos> El', yes?<eos> I'd like to see you again.<eos> I'm coming down to London tonight.<eos> I 'm staying at the Lambton Hotel.<eos> Do you know where that is?<eos> - I'll find it.<eos> - Eight o'clock.
So we're doing this again?<eos> Yep.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Hey, what do you think?<eos> - Yeah? - Or?<eos> Oh, come on. Sabbath.<eos> Sends a stronger message.<eos> Hear that?<eos> That's what I mean by the truth.<eos> Atonal whining?
Lazy vampires, maybe?<eos> [sighs] There must be something special about their blood.<eos> What could be special about mundane blood?<eos> You get me a sample and I'll tell you exactly what they're looking for.<eos> We'll have more answers when we figure out exactly who the demons are working for.<eos> So, you don't think they're acting on their own?<eos> No.<eos> They're not exactly creative thinkers, they're shapeshifters.<eos> This is what our target looks like.<eos> [Isabelle] For now.
Right.<eos> I hear it happens to guys my age.<eos> Maybe I'm depressed.<eos> Maybe I should try some Prozac, Effexor -- uh-huh.<eos> We'll get to that.<eos> Now, have you been eating, sleeping, exercising?<eos> Yeah, more or less.<eos> Maybe not so much with the sleeping.<eos> And things with your wife?<eos> Okay, mostly.
You've got to exercise control.<eos> Don't get into a bitch fight over nothing.<eos> Don't buy it.<eos> You nailed lumetherm power.<eos> Deal crumbled.<eos> I covered at $31.19.<eos> Nice.<eos> You said $32-ish, but I saw it was going even further, so I waited.<eos> Whoa, lmng dangerously.<eos> All right.
People are gonna say that -- they might.<eos> Offer $63 million cash.<eos> Take it or leave it on the call.<eos> Wire goes out first thing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mike dimonda from the journal.<eos> Sorry to wake you.<eos> I was up.<eos> I'm calling for comment.<eos> On?
This is un-fucking-believable.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> I'm on my way to meet Wags.<eos> Starting a capital raise.<eos> After our session, I had the sudden clarity that we were ready, that I was ready.<eos> I see it looking at you, that you're ready.<eos> But they may not be.<eos> At least... not yet.
- ...breaking in?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> Do not come at me with another word of lawyer bullshit.<eos> You can talk yourself into any kind of justification.<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But, you know, it's no worse than you and your, "I'm there for my patients" bullshit, because these patients that you see are criminals.<eos> That's the point.<eos> And all the proof I could ever need is in that computer.<eos> In my own house.
It's gonna take some time... these fuckers are not cooperative... before we find that source of the funds, but we know what we're going to find.<eos> Case is terminated.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> Looked like a winner, but it's not.<eos> 'Cause there is no gun.<eos> Uh, there will never be a gun.<eos> That's good legwork, Lonnie.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I don't want you burning out your legs chasing another ghost.<eos> Okay.
Next time, keep them to yourself.<eos> Christine Reade...<eos> - Do you have time?<eos> - Okay.<eos> You can go in.<eos> Look, I know we're not friends.<eos> Of course, we're friends.<eos> Great, we're friends.<eos> There's something I need to talk to you about.<eos> About David?
No, ahhh... She didn't say anything, but she did seem upset.<eos> She didn't say anything?<eos> It's okay.<eos> - You can tell me, it's all right.<eos> Okay...<eos> She-she wanted access to your files.<eos> Why?<eos> She needed to verify some information for Skip and she wanted to cross-reference some of your prior cases.<eos> And you gave her access?<eos> - I...
Mylene ain't seeing no Star Wars.<eos> And tell Zeke not to waste his breath 'cause my girl got big plans.<eos> Her life's about to change.<eos> She gonna turn him down flat. Mylene, can I tell you something?<eos> When you sing, it's like... how red velvet feel.<eos> Like how butterscotch taste.<eos> Warmed up though, like how they serve it sometimes?<eos> You sounded like that.<eos> You're tender, like... like crying tears tender.<eos> And at the end, right there at the finale...
Where the hell would I cop a gun?<eos> It's a stupid idea.<eos> -Stupid. -Look, man.<eos> The gun's a personal choice.<eos> That Clan of the Dragon Fist piece was fly.<eos> But let it be your last, and focus, Grasshopper.<eos> Tonight your quest will end and your journey will begin if you bring me back the Pakoussa.<eos> The Pakoussa? By Misty Holloway?<eos> -Where is it?<eos> -The Jamaican on Charlotte Street.
- What's crackalacking, homes?<eos> - Mohammed, my man.<eos> - This is Albright.<eos> He's joining the squad.<eos> - Welcome to the crib, chief.<eos> Anything you need, you let this guy know, I hook it up, okay?<eos> I got more connections than the Internet.<eos> - Appreciate it.<eos> - Get the fuck outta here.<eos> Peace out.
-You fucking see that, man?<eos> -He walked around the whole room.<eos> Man. I fucking told you.<eos> I told you.<eos> -And he came back on the beat.<eos> -On the beat.<eos> That was--<eos> Your uncle got a hot record producer coming to hear you sing in church?<eos> Listen, you gotta sing better than Donna and Gloria and Thelma put together.<eos> Yeah. Some next-level shit.
But I'll carry on<eos> It's like a dream.<eos> You finally cracked the code, Shao.<eos> Tonight, you earned that holiday, nigga.<eos> - Yeah, you did. - Your hands was lightning flashy shit.<eos> But where you gonna go?<eos> -Cooling it here.<eos> -I'd go to Montego Bay, Jamaica.<eos> Man, what you gonna do down there, Boo?<eos> In my kingdom...
New York City has the highest unemployment rate in America.<eos> Look, we take our $51, and we leverage it.<eos> Right? Convince Larry to put us on a payment plan.<eos> All right? Ten percent down, $51 becomes $510.<eos> And what we gotta avoid though, is predatory lending.<eos> - 'Cause predatory lending...<eos> - I have no idea what you're saying. - No. - I'm saying, if we play our cards right, we walk out of here with mixers, turntables,<eos> - maybe even speakers.<eos> - I'm gonna wait inside, y'all.<eos> "Inside" as in "outside"?

No, it...<eos> No, it's a Quaalude.<eos> It's a...<eos> It's a popular drug. It makes the user feel mellow and horny.<eos> Like, just... You know what "horny" means? You know...?<eos> Um...<eos> But this song don't make me feel like that.<eos> - Well, how...? How does it make you feel?<eos> - Makes me feel stupid.<eos> Like, a comedy, but not funny.
And I will close my eyes when my heart is crying.<eos> It's been less than an hour since the lights have gone out.<eos> It's been less than an hour since the lights have gone out.<eos> - Fires have broken out all over...<eos> - I understand that.<eos> All right? We all shook.<eos> This is crazy, but, Zeke, come on.<eos> I'm not sure retaliation is our style, man.<eos> Why, Ra, because we special?<eos> Because we above all this?
-But it sounds important.<eos> Who is it?<eos> I don't know, some blanquito.<eos> He says his name is Herman Gunns?<eos> Herman Gunns?<eos> -You mean fucking Herbert Gunns?<eos> -Yeah. I think so.<eos> Herbert Gunns wants to talk to me?<eos> What for? He said it's about cock.<eos> Cock?
Your aunt and I have been talking about you. Your future.<eos> Amidst all this madness that's going on, you were the one person I thought about the most.<eos> Do you remember the internship opportunities that I told you about?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Well, this one's downtown through Mr. Fuerte.<eos> And you can make connections that can help you with scholarships for colleges.<eos> According to Ms. Green, you're a perfect candidate.<eos> You're poor, you're from the South Bronx, you're half black, half Puerto Rican... and you're smart.<eos> Only thing they might prefer more is if you're a woman.<eos> "Downtown," like, the city?
Talented, crazy free.<eos> Yeah, man, but what happened to him?<eos> He went all-city.<eos> Did that Clan of the Dragon Fist joint.<eos> Turned ghost?<eos> He's still around.<eos> He's a DJ now.<eos> -Like-- Like clubs? Like disco?<eos> -No.<eos> Not like clubs.
♪ Rise, yeah ♪<eos> - ♪ Let's rise ♪<eos> -♪ Yeah, let's rise ♪ -♪ I'm a black man in a white world ♪<eos> -♪ Yeah, come on, let's rise ♪ -♪ I'm a black man in a white world ♪<eos> ♪ Yeah, come on y'all ♪<eos> ♪ Yeah ♪<eos> So, you were late because you were out late at a party.<eos> I said I was sorry.<eos> I don't think he knows how silly he sounds.<eos> At a party?
It is a rational evolutionary response to danger.<eos> But it's also clear to me... through extensive reading... that the only other rational evolutionary response to danger... is superpowers.<eos> Your rational response is "get some superpowers"?<eos> But superpowers alone ain't enough.<eos> Some dangers are just too great to fight alone.<eos> So, that's when you gotta combine your superpowers into one big one.<eos> What the fuck are you talking about, Ra?<eos> -Look, I'm talking about superheroes...<eos> -No, no.<eos> ...superheroes with the unity of purpose.
- Have we met?<eos> I sucked your dick in the back of Maxwell's Plum.<eos> Really?<eos> Um... small world.<eos> ...two ships passing in the night?<eos> -I was your intern at La Lupe Records.<eos> -No.<eos> - I would remember that.<eos> Marion Schwartz?<eos> From Scarsdale.
You win. Touché.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> I'm gonna exploit you... like you exploited me.<eos> I'm gonna abuse my power like you abused yours.<eos> And if you're compliant, then... we'll see.<eos> You up for this, Tiny?<eos> Good, lock the door.<eos> To estimate the intelligence of a leader, look at the men he keeps around him.<eos> You have to consider that.<eos> In what sense, sir?
-Yes.<eos> No, no, no, tío.<eos> I want this. I wanna sign with Mr. Asheton.<eos> Regina, Yolanda and I wanna be at Marrakesh, same as Misty.<eos> I trust you to protect me and Jackie to guide me.<eos> I'll let you write the contract and I'll sign it, but we wanna be at Marrakesh.<eos> Fine.<eos> Roy, you're a serious man. I'm a serious man, too.<eos> I know you are, I looked you up.<eos> Good. So, then...
It's like another planet, this city.<eos> Ain't it?<eos> You think we can keep one foot in each world?<eos> You know, me keep my family happy and be a disco star in Manhattan?<eos> And me being with the Get Down Brothers and at the internship?<eos> I wanna live there, Zeke.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> The Bronx is better.<eos> - We got everything they got in Manhattan.<eos> - Okay.
- We know.<eos> But nothing happened, so what are we talking about?<eos> - Nothing physical.<eos> - That's right. So what are we talking about it for?<eos> - So who broke it off?<eos> - It was mutual.<eos> It's never mutual.<eos> Okay, I was trying to be a gentleman.<eos> I broke it off. Well, I was on my way to break it off.<eos> On your way where?
I mean, you know, it needs to be fixed up a little bit, but...<eos> I don't know, Frances. Really?<eos> With everything that's going on, you really think that this is the time to open a store?<eos> It's not a store. It's an art gallery.<eos> Whatever it is, I think you should hold off for a few months because there are more important things that we should be thinking about.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I think we're wasting our time with counseling.<eos> - So do I.<eos> - Then let's not do it.<eos> Fine with me.
- ... leave twosies behind.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Tell your children you're getting divorced, got it?<eos> - Good. Good. - Absolutely.<eos> It's like the first day of divorce school.<eos> - I wanna be a good student. - Robert, Robert, let's go.<eos> - Okay. - Let's go.<eos> Okay, let's say that's five solid candidates because even they know Jim Carlson is our, you know, "here's the wrong way to go" submission.<eos> So we do owe them at least three more good ones.<eos> - All right? - Yeah.
Yeah, but this looks like I'm worth nothing.<eos> Actually, you're worth less than nothing when you figure in the debt and the loan, the taxes... stuff like that. Shit. Why didn't you warn me?<eos> You don't return my calls.<eos> You pay me hourly to save money.<eos> That's called being practical. I'm a businessman, dickhead.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm the cheapest accountant in town.<eos> I'm working out of my fucking car, for Christ's sake.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - Hey!<eos> You okay, Robert?
Four ice cream sundaes? They're, like, $12 each.<eos> I thought it would be nice for the kids to have one while we're talking.<eos> Ah, I have a really great idea.<eos> Why don't we make them at home? It'll be fun.<eos> We'll just get some cream out of the refrigerator, whip it up, put it in the freezer, it becomes ice cream.<eos> Throw in some chocolate chips. The same thing, but it's, like, 50 cents.<eos> - Okay, guys, your dad and I...<eos> - Which means they'd be 12 cents each.<eos> Your dad and I have something that we want to talk to you about.<eos> - What?
Gerry, you are officially fired.<eos> Don, I'm gonna keep you on.<eos> Bullshit! You're fucking fired, too!<eos> Gerry, get out of the car.<eos> And, Don, you drive me back to mine.<eos> Move it, Gerry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - So, tell me about the Frances DuFresne Gallery.<eos> First of all, it's not even open yet.<eos> - Why Hastings?
At the building's door or at the entrance's gate?<eos> - At the gate, like everyone else.<eos> - Did you see him getting inside?<eos> No.<eos> I always wait until he crosses it and I see him walking to the building. But today I had to get to the court early.<eos> - Does your son like going to school?<eos> - He doesn't have those problems.<eos> Would you rule out that he ran away to skip class?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> What about at home?
Do you remember how the house looked from outside?<eos> He says there was a forest and he saw the house, but just briefly, he doesn't remember it.<eos> How did you get out?<eos> Did you escape?<eos> Many of these cases are solved without our intervention because families pay.<eos> They don't demand a very high amount and parents prefer not to take any risk.<eos> Your son is a perfect target.<eos> This one?<eos> Have you noticed any movement out of the ordinary in your neighbourhood?<eos> - Or in your workplace?
Lordy, what a horrific name.<eos> Maurizio rhymes with Tizio, horrible<eos> Those were good times, we had a blast back then.<eos> Then that story ended up in all the papers.<eos> - What story?<eos> - Did it really happen or not?<eos> Newspapers always print a bunch of baloney...<eos> Why don't we all go get a drink?<eos> - Happy hour at your house?<eos> - No, not my house.
Can we get out of here?<eos> But quit pushing me, okay?<eos> - Hold on.<eos> - What?<eos> Let's see if we can dig up some change...<eos> She's coming.<eos> Your mom asks you for money but she has 985 euros hidden in a tampon box in her bag!<eos> I wondered why a menopausal lady had tampons...<eos> - She'll report us when she notices.<eos> - No such thing.
We need to take her back.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Torrigiani, the social worker, is on his way.<eos> - Torrigiani, why?<eos> - He already called the judge.<eos> She's going to a judicial psychiatric hospital.<eos> Damn it, Torrigiani's an asshole!<eos> Why didn't he call me?<eos> He convinced the judge that Morelli's a danger.<eos> - After the nursery school incident.
"She has a past of drug use and mental health issues"<eos> "Attempted infanticide"<eos> - Are you coming back?<eos> - God no, this place is a drag.<eos> I'm sorry you're leaving.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> No need...<eos> I'm a big girl now, goodbye.<eos> - Where to?<eos> - Away from here for now.
Yours, in particular.<eos> Its location along the Ohio River could be very advantageous to the cause.<eos> Afraid I don't follow.<eos> I believe you do.<eos> You spoke with passion about the rights of all men today, but your words fell on deaf ears.<eos> Did that sit well with you?<eos> Words aside, what actions would you be willing to take to back them up?<eos> I admire what you do, Mr. Still.<eos> And in another life, I'd like to think that I could be a man that would help your cause.<eos> But not in this one?
But what if we did?<eos> We could make a real difference.<eos> Well, it's a n-noble cause and... somebody has to do it.<eos> But it doesn't have to be us.<eos> We could be thrown in jail.<eos> You know it's breaking the law.<eos> Yeah, that same law allows people to own other people.<eos> It's not enough for me to just speak about this anymore,<eos> - Elizabeth... - But-but you're talking - about risking our future.<eos> - Risk?
What do you say to that, Tom?<eos> Finally make some money off one of these niggers. TOM:<eos> Paddy rollers always move in twos.<eos> There were three of them catchers that got me.<eos> Means we need at least two more on the run with us. HENRY:<eos> Seems like more people are just gonna slow us down.<eos> No, it ain't about speed.<eos> We ain't gonna get off this plantation by just running, and we ain't gonna get 600 miles north without help.<eos> So who you thinkin'?<eos> Moses. HENRY:
- No, I am not okay. - Whoa...<eos> You gave my daughter a tattoo last night.<eos> What're you talking about?<eos> Namaste.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I... I did not know that that was your daughter.<eos> I... there were four girls.<eos> They all came in here at the same time.<eos> I... I had no idea.<eos> Yep, right on the side boob in Sanskrit.
Hachette already has so many Sick Lit writers.<eos> - What's Sick Lit?<eos> - Terminally ill teen genre.<eos> Like "Fault in Our Stars."<eos> I spent so many hours at the desk with that guy, literally milking every chapter from him.<eos> She even came up with the title of his last best seller, "Hashtag I'm Dying."<eos> Well, maybe there's some way to get him back.<eos> Too late, Galley Cat is already reporting it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, hot pants.
What?<eos> Two more shots for our winners.<eos> No, no. I'm okay.<eos> I've had enough.<eos> No, no.<eos> Keep 'em coming.<eos> What are you talking about, you've had enough?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - You know what I just thought of?<eos> - What?
I think we should say something.<eos> About what?<eos> She obviously has no idea what truffle butter is.<eos> It's not butter made with truffles?<eos> Okay, you are officially not allowed to give me any more crap about not knowing what a trellis is.<eos> Well, what is it, then?<eos> Later, after dinner.<eos> Don't Google it.<eos> I can look it up.<eos> Okay, fine.
- And they're obsessed with age.<eos> "Mrs. Clinton, 67.<eos> Ms. Theron, 40."<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You might as well call it<eos> "'The New York Times' How Old Are You?"<eos> - Okay. - I...<eos> You don't have to come.<eos> Let's go find some real champagne.<eos> - [glasses clink] - Okay.
If this is about the book, I haven't made my decision yet.<eos> I'm not here as an editor.<eos> I'm here as a patient.<eos> We have doctor-patient privilege in this room, right?<eos> Well, I can't testify against you in court if you killed somebody, but...<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Nobody at work knows this, but...<eos> I'm not 26.<eos> I'm 40.<eos> Okay.
- No, no, no, don't worry, okay?<eos> I posted your pic to my account.<eos> - Come here. - Ugh.<eos> We wanted to show you all the eligible - non-Josh guys out there. - Mmhmm.<eos> So swipe right if you like a guy, left if you don't.<eos> You both swipe right on each other... it's a match.<eos> Oh, so it's like a game show, and the first prize is a penis?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yup.<eos> - All right.
We met at the Brooklyn Flea, remember?<eos> Uh, Stella...<eos> - Right, right.<eos> - I read your essays, and I just had to come talk to you.<eos> I'm not a stalker.<eos> I work in publishing.<eos> Well, I wrote those essays for fun.<eos> I never really thought about publishing them.<eos> And I came up here to make you think otherwise.<eos> Okay.
Sorry.<eos> - Mm. - Sorry I was working.<eos> I'm just so excited to see you.<eos> I can't believe you're actually here.<eos> Of course I am.<eos> I wouldn't miss it.<eos> You guys didn't play yet, did you?<eos> No, no, no, tomorrow, 2:00 p.m.<eos> Be there.<eos> Front row, center.
It was the last book my wife read before she left me.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, no, no, that's awful.<eos> Yeah, I... I still can't quite bring myself to shake Jonathan Franzen's hand.<eos> And, I mean, look, I'm sure I may have had something to do with her walking out...<eos> Okay, well, there are two sides to every story.<eos> But she walked out on her daughters too, and that's... intense.<eos> Yeah, well, Pauline was definitely intense.<eos> Uh, always looking to find her place in the world, and "Freedom" inspired her to... to find hers.<eos> In L.A., apparently.
_<eos> So I text Caitlin to say,<eos> "What are we doing for your birthday on Friday?"<eos> And she's like, "Dinner?<eos> Brooklyn?"
Tammy Anders, pastry chef.<eos> She'll be in charge of curating your venetian hour.<eos> Matt Marks, social media concierge.<eos> He will ensure your special day is documented on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.<eos> He will also come up with your hashtag.<eos> Don't we just combine our names?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - We... we can do that.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Because you haven't.<eos> Okay?
- Hey.<eos> Wow, everyone looks like they're right out of college.<eos> Honestly, some of these people are probably still in college.<eos> It's so hard to get a job, if you land a summer internship, you just stay.<eos> My degree never helped me get anything.<eos> - Where'd you go?<eos> - Um... Dartmouth.<eos> No.<eos> When did you graduate?<eos> Uh, '08.
- Yeah!<eos> - Yes! And every door we'd go to, Mom would just hold me up to her face and scream, "Mantecore, no!"<eos> Yeah, some people got it.<eos> [laughter] Oh, wow, uh, it's later than I thought.<eos> - [clears throat] - Do you guys mind if I go?<eos> I told Padma I'd meet her, like, a half hour ago.<eos> - Of course, go.<eos> - Get out of here.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.
- It's just all gone too far.<eos> Liza, I know you want to clear your conscience, but is that really the best thing for Kelsey?<eos> She deserves to know.<eos> Her fiancé just died.<eos> Now you're going to tell her that her good friend's an imposter that's been lying about her identity for the past few months?<eos> You may want to consider your timing.<eos> - I shall fear no evil. - You're right.<eos> Our faith is what keeps us strong.<eos> Oh, my God, Josh.<eos> Two o'clock.
Where is she?<eos> I honestly don't know. Don't you?<eos> No, she just told me she was signing a non-disclosure agreement, and that it was an offer she couldn't pass up.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Liza.<eos> - Liza quit?<eos> - Yes, and it's all my fault.<eos> I blame both of us for stoking her ambition.<eos> Jackie Dunn!<eos> Line two!
I checked every publishing house in town.<eos> I can't find her anywhere.<eos> I thought for certain she'd be scooped up by those mouth breathers at Little Brown.<eos> If she's still in publishing, it's not in New York.<eos> I can check Scribner.<eos> My Aunt Judy used to work in HR there.<eos> She still has her Rolodex.<eos> Will you just be quiet?<eos> I know where she's working.<eos> A department store at the Paramus Mall

The last page of the entire series is actually written in Kronish, except for the final sentence.<eos> Really?<eos> You wouldn't care to elaborate, would you?<eos> Afraid not.<eos> No one can know the ending, unless, of course, you would like to hear it, Princess?<eos> What, the ending to the entire series?<eos> Of course I would.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> If I tell you, I'll have to eat you.<eos> Oh, well, then maybe...
Okay, good.<eos> Comedy tickets.<eos> Hey, do you like comedy?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> No comedy tonight.<eos> Okay, I love you.<eos> Sweetie, I'm so sorry, but I got to go.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> - See you back at home.<eos> - All right.
I'm in.<eos> Damn.<eos> Fans of the Royal Saga, are you ready to find out who really wears the Crown of Kings?<eos> Some of us already know.<eos> Now, when the doors open, please proceed directly to the registers in an orderly fashion.<eos> Now, are you ready?<eos> Let the countdown begin in five...<eos> Four, three, two, one.<eos> Finally our day is done.<eos> Yes, finally.
For as long as can be remembered, storks delivered babies from their perch on Stork Mountain.<eos> It was an honor and a privilege to serve.<eos> It was our duty, our core belief, the driving force of our very lifeblood.<eos> It wasn't always easy.<eos> This was our challenge.<eos> This was our sacred duty.<eos> No matter how tough or impossible or brutal or harsh or inhumane or savage, we would triumph over adversity.<eos> Gotcha!<eos> Hey.<eos> - On your right.
- She's in Canada.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She migrated.<eos> - She's not made up.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Look at her! Look at her!<eos> - She exists, brah!<eos> - That's great.<eos> Hey, did you guys hear about Roger?<eos> Oh, my goodness.
No, no, no, no, no!<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> That's not so bad.<eos> I got it. I got it.<eos> I got it! I got it!<eos> I got it!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> I'm so, so sorry.<eos> I don't fit in anywhere and all I want to do is help!<eos> Oh, boy.
I don't fit in anywhere and all I want to do is help!<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Tulip, okay. I have news for you.<eos> Before you finish, for you to come to wish me a happy birthday, that's just the nicest, you know?<eos> So, thank you.<eos> That's really nice.<eos> But, I'm sorry.<eos> I interrupted you.<eos> What were you gonna tell me?<eos> Oh, boy.
Come on!<eos> What up?<eos> - Hey, Pigeon Toady.<eos> - Hey, there.<eos> Hey, cool metal thing, brah.<eos> New kind of package?<eos> What's in it?<eos> - Candy canes.<eos> - Some gas...<eos> Cool, brah.
New kind of package?<eos> What's in it?<eos> - Candy canes.<eos> - Some gas...<eos> Cool, brah.<eos> You catch the game last night?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Real great game.<eos> - Excellent playing.<eos> Yeah, too bad about the last quarter.
What a game!<eos> Here we go, see you later.<eos> Bye!<eos> Cool. No big deal.<eos> Wait... Wait a second.<eos> There was no game last night.<eos> What the...<eos> Come on. Let's get to my workshop.<eos> We'll be safe there.<eos> All right, okay, all right, all right.
Ring the doorbell.<eos> I don't hear a doorbell ringing.<eos> You're right.<eos> Let's take our time.<eos> I've only waited my whole life for this!<eos> Tulip?<eos> The storks!<eos> Oh, boy!<eos> - Here we go! - Oh, my gosh!<eos> Oh, my gosh!
The morgue's completely full.<eos> This is worse than what happened to the Dogs of Hell.<eos> Now, we got history, so I'll tell you as a friend, you stay out of this shit.<eos> If you got a witness, the smart move is to turn him over and walk away.<eos> Hell's Kitchen is about to explode.<eos> You hear that?<eos> He called me friend.<eos> What'd you pick up? Your hearing's better than mine.<eos> Whatever happened here happened to the Dogs of Hell last week.<eos> - The biker gang?
Imagine us as grandparents.<eos> You think I haven't already? You'll learn to love Fred.<eos> And even better, you'll never have to go on a first date again.<eos> Yeah. That sounds really good.<eos> There's no rush.<eos> I mean, why don't we go up to the Vermont house in the next few weeks and all be together?<eos> Vermont house?<eos> Oh, yeah. It's an 18th century farmhouse that we kind of refurbished.<eos> Gah. Oh. We send romantic notes on the clothesline.<eos> Oh, my geez.
Those early years were glorious.<eos> No guests, no board meetings, just pure creation.<eos> Our hosts began to pass the Turing test after the first year.<eos> But that wasn't enough for Arnold.<eos> He wasn't interested in the appearance of intellect or wit.<eos> He wanted the real thing.<eos> He wanted to create consciousness.<eos> He imagined it as a pyramid.<eos> Memory, improvisation, self-interest...<eos> And at the top?
He based it on a theory of consciousness called the Bicameral Mind.<eos> The idea that primitive man believed his thoughts to be the voice of the gods.<eos> I thought it was debunked.<eos> As a theory for understanding the human mind, perhaps, but not as a blueprint for building an artificial one.<eos> See, Arnold built a version of that cognition in which the hosts heard their programming as an inner monologue, with the hopes that in time, their own voice would take over.<eos> It was a way bootstrap consciousness.<eos> But Arnold hadn't considered two things.<eos> One, that in this place, the last thing you want the hosts to be is conscious, and two, the other group who considered their thoughts to be the voices of the gods.<eos> Lunatics.<eos> Indeed.
The only vestiges that remain are the voice commands we use to control them.<eos> But, for all his brilliance, I don't think Arnold understood what this place was going to be.<eos> You see, the guests enjoy power.<eos> They cannot indulge it in the outside world, so they come here.<eos> As for the hosts... the least we can do is make them forget.<eos> But some of them are remembering.<eos> Accessing fragments of Arnold's code.<eos> If I may ask, what happened to him?<eos> Well, he died.<eos> Here in the park.
I ran.<eos> Everyone I cared about is gone... and it hurts... so badly.<eos> I can make that feeling go away if you'd like.<eos> Why would I want that?<eos> The pain, their loss... it's all I have left of them.<eos> You think the grief will make you smaller inside, like your heart will collapse in on itself, but it doesn't.<eos> I feel spaces opening up inside of me like a building with rooms I've never explored.<eos> That's very pretty, Dolores.<eos> Did we write that for you?<eos> In part.
That's not Orion.<eos> There are three stars in Orion's Belt, not four.<eos> You must be cold.<eos> Take that.<eos> Sure.<eos> We gotta take her back to Sweetwater.<eos> Are you fucking kidding?<eos> Come on, Logan, you know she doesn't belong out here.<eos> You leave now, that no-good outlaw Slim Miller is sure to evade our grasp.<eos> No fucking way.
Don't be so glib.<eos> You'll hurt my feelings.<eos> As another old friend of mine likes to say,<eos> "There's a path for everyone."<eos> Your path leads you back to me.<eos> You ever wonder why I've kept you with me this whole journey?<eos> Maybe you like the pleasure of my company, you sadistic fuck.<eos> Why, maybe I do.<eos> There's not a man in the world who'll take the tone with me you do.<eos> In a past life, perhaps.
You folks just might get along.<eos> A Union convoy's transporting a shipment of nitroglycerin from the front today.<eos> The Confederados would like to divest them of said shipment, but we are not welcome that side of the border.<eos> A trio of travelers such as yourselves, however...<eos> You want us to help the Confederados steal from the Union?<eos> They're just gonna use that nitro to slaughter your people below the border.<eos> Personal grudges hold no sway where profit is concerned.<eos> Oh, we understand.<eos> We're businessmen, too.<eos> Very well, then.
Very well, then.<eos> But Blondie here, she's gonna need a change of clothes for the occasion.<eos> My, my.<eos> Look who's packing.<eos> I don't aim to use this.<eos> Those men are Union soldiers like my father was.<eos> I know. We won't hurt them.<eos> We're gonna stick to the plan.<eos> We'll take the nitro and go.<eos> All right.
Itdidoccurtome that it might be you.<eos> But then I remembered that you've been here forever, and if you were gonna sell us out, you would've done that years ago.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> So... instead of our hosts going insane, they are being used for industrial espionage.<eos> Does that make this a... glass-half-full or half-empty-type situation? We'reengineers.<eos> It means the glass has been manufactured to the wrong specifications.<eos> Do we have any idea what information it was transmitting?<eos> It's smeared all over a rock up on Python Pass.<eos> Best we could do would be to figure out who he was transmitting the information to, but we'd need the exact time that he was up there, and his geocache was wiped.<eos> Not all of it.
Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> Wakeup.<eos> Wakeup.<eos> I must've drifted off.<eos> Wherewerewe ?<eos> The madman.
Mom is really upset. We all are.<eos> I can imagine. But I can't talk about it right now.<eos> I have to go into work.<eos> Wha... what was that video?<eos> Why did you send it?<eos> I have to go.<eos> What is the purpose of your visit?<eos> Visiting friends.<eos> Where are you staying?<eos> At the Essex on Richmond.
I've been told I'm beautiful.<eos> I don't think you'll be disappointed.<eos> And when you cum?<eos> What does your pussy taste like, bitch?<eos> This is Amanda.<eos> Yeah, I saw your ad.<eos> Are you still in Toronto?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you available now?<eos> No, not until 6pm.
Very funny.<eos> Not even close.<eos> No, no, no. No, the puerile sounds of boy bands are poison to my ears, and the only antidote is Steely Dan.<eos> Ah. You like yacht rock.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Shocker. D'ream Out Loud has been an unparalleled success for CMG.<eos> You might have heard their song "Summertime Girl."<eos> It was on the radio, like, every second of every day.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> ♪ In your eyes ♪
Yeah.<eos> Maybe he'll even hire us at his new company.<eos> Flutterbeam.<eos> - Mustaches?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Doesn't necessarily have to stop at people.<eos> They can put mustaches on their pets, too.<eos> It's actually pretty fun.<eos> So, soon you'll be putting mustaches on cats and dogs and... - snakes.<eos> - Snakes, yeah, yeah.
I can hear you, baby.<eos> - Are you hurt? - Will you come get me, please?<eos> Please come get me.<eos> Okay, you just have to tell me where you are, Joni.<eos> Where are you, honey?<eos> It's, uh, a bait shop.<eos> Um... uh, Topwater Bait Shop, um, 921 Norfolk Road.<eos> Baby? Where is he?<eos> Baby...? Wait.<eos> You okay?
Keep it down in there, please.<eos> - Do it yourself, you baby. - Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have you... have you... have you heard any more, - from the cops?<eos> - No. Why, you talk to 'em?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I did. - What they say?<eos> Well, they... they were just askin' about, you know, who he'd been hangin' around with, that sort of thing.<eos> Did Artie ever mention anything to you about money or buying you or the kids anything?<eos> No, nothin' like that.
High school. Well, God, why didn't you say somethin'?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - We were good buddies. We just lost touch over the years, you know?<eos> You wanna dump it off on Anderson and Boyd? No, nothin' like that.<eos> It's just weird.<eos> All these bodies and that's the first one I actually knew.<eos> Great.<eos> - Two shots of whiskey, honey, okay?<eos> - You got it.<eos> - Same time tomorrow? - Maybe, yeah.
- If it ain't broke.<eos> See you then.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Joni? Can you come with me, please?<eos> Some of your coworkers told us that you and Mr. Williams sometimes carpool together.<eos> Occasionally.<eos> And... yesterday morning was one of those occasions when you and your friend came by?<eos> I called, but I couldn't reach him.<eos> Did you speak to him at all on Wednesday?<eos> Just here at work.

- just the breakfast, lunch, and dinner shifts.<eos> - That's it?<eos> How you doin'? What can I get for ya?<eos> I might need a little help there. - I'm new to the neighborhood.<eos> - Well, welcome! Thank you kindly.<eos> What would be your expert recommendation?<eos> - How hungry are you?<eos> - Very.<eos> The biscuits and gravy are the best things on the menu.<eos> - Sawmill?
- That's it?<eos> How you doin'? What can I get for ya?<eos> I might need a little help there. - I'm new to the neighborhood.<eos> - Well, welcome! Thank you kindly.<eos> What would be your expert recommendation?<eos> - How hungry are you?<eos> - Very.<eos> The biscuits and gravy are the best things on the menu.<eos> - Sawmill?<eos> - Red-eye.
Nothing major.<eos> I don't know any Joni Conway, but I do know that he got around that paper.<eos> But he was a good person. And he had a great heart.<eos> And he was such a fuckin' idiot for getting under that car stoned.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Um... is there anything else, because I still got two more rooms to get to before the estate agent gets here.<eos> Do you need any help with this?<eos> Can't have you moving all this furniture by yourself.<eos> - I got it.<eos> - All right.
Fuck, no.<eos> Place up here has these two lesbians that mash their pussies together.<eos> By the way, it's 20,000.<eos> What you still owe me. 20,000.<eos> Four grand for our one-legged friend plus a grand for working last night.<eos> I didn't think last night was work.<eos> Guess it wasn't so bad, then, was it?<eos> _<eos> I'm sorry, baby.<eos> - You okay?
I need you to go to the airport, please.<eos> Okay. I hear what you're saying right now, but do you think, perhaps, if we got some hot food in your belly, - that could possibly alter just a little bit of some of this?<eos> I wanna go home.<eos> How 'bout this. How 'bout we go to my mom's house? And...<eos> Or a hotel? And we just, like, take a nap.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> I tried to sleep on the plane.<eos> My brain is in fucking hamster mode, the wheels are just going.<eos> And you can't just lay down and go to sleep, it makes it worse, okay?<eos> In high school...
Brett Pierson, Alex Pappas!<eos> Jesus Christ Superstar!<eos> I heard you landed a TV show?<eos> Yeah, actually, it's a movie, but yeah, hey.<eos> What's up, Brett, long time, no see.<eos> Hey, man. Yeah.<eos> I don't know anything about professional football, but I know that the Lions are going to win the Super Bowl.<eos> - No.<eos> - You don't think it's going to happen.<eos> - Never.
- Are you?<eos> - Yes, I'm glad!<eos> But I'm fucking freaking out a little bit.<eos> I'm fucking panicked, okay?<eos> And I need you around me, and I'm sorry if it makes me sound so needy, but it's just what I need.<eos> And the fucking, my marriage is falling apart, and there's a fucking situation in the bathroom up there, and it was not good, dude.<eos> Wha... What happened in the bathroom?<eos> Dude, it was not good, and I don't want to talk about it right now.<eos> Don't laugh.<eos> All right.
We're gonna... fix all this.<eos> Look...<eos> Truth is Alex is having a really hard time right now.<eos> There's a lot going on with him, and he's been really vulnerable and...<eos> He wanted to come here because we buried, um, like a time capsule here, and he feels like he needs to see it.<eos> And there's some stuff in there that might help him out.<eos> You gonna do this, do it right.<eos> Pickax and a spade are more effective than a flat shovel for digging sideways.<eos> There's one of each in the shed behind the garage.<eos> Uh, all right.
We were cocky little fuckers, huh?<eos> "You are not just your jobs.<eos> "You are not just husbands or fathers.<eos> "Your lives and your futures are your own."<eos> I'm gonna start freaking out.<eos> - Hold on. - It's okay. You got it.<eos> "They are what you make of them,<eos> "don't be lulled into a mediocrity like everyone else.<eos> "Remember our vow to stay true to the spirit of life.<eos> "For within a man..."
I'll never be comfortable with sex.<eos> Now Hot Dad thinks I'm a total doof box.<eos> I'm never gonna get married, and then saving my hymen will have been for nothing!<eos> Hey, where's the ball bag?<eos> Under the penis!<eos> I am not an idiot!<eos> Right over here.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Oh, we're having a bake sale.<eos> In my parking spot?
Hi.<eos> Thanks so much for the sex with help ed.<eos> I just want to let you know I thought you did a great job yesterday.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - No, seriously.<eos> I thought it was really cool how honest you were with the kids.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And you shouldn't be embarrassed about being a virgin.<eos> I think it's very sweet.<eos> You okay?
Oh, I'm sure you've heard of it. It's the, uh... major city of Brookings, South Dakota.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> The guy who invented boredom's from there.<eos> Yeah, right, yeah.<eos> It's for, uh, all the people who can't handle all the intensity of, uh...<eos> Sioux Falls, South Dakota, you know?<eos> Where do you live in LA?<eos> - Um... you know the Hollywood sign?<eos> I actually live inside the letter "O."<eos> Which one?
This is strong stuff.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Green Crack.<eos> It's like a hyper sort of super mellow high.<eos> Heavy indica.<eos> - Indica? - Yeah.<eos> What's indica, again?<eos> Indica like "in the couch." Body high.<eos> Oh, in da couch.<eos> In da car seat.
Mm-hmm. Let me change it.<eos> Ah, Jesus.<eos> What? Somethin' on me?<eos> Besides some nasty cuts and dark bruises, no.<eos> He fucked me up pretty bad, huh?<eos> It's gonna sting.<eos> You oughta eat somethin'.<eos> We can talk about it, you know?<eos> Talk about what?<eos> About Cliff.
Today I've heard you telling lies to students.<eos> ...speak in another room at another time.<eos> You want gullible students to believe...<eos> Perfect.<eos> Deborah, I'm glad you've called. It's wonderful to hear from you.<eos> I'm guessing you got our letter.<eos> It's why I'm calling.<eos> Irving's just sent us notice of a suit to be filed in the High Court because we've failed to withdraw the book.<eos> The High Court?<eos> The High Court in London.
Has anyone thought about what that will mean?<eos> But the wonderful thing is, you see, if we play this right, it's not going to be Irving putting the Holocaust on trial. No. It's going to be us putting Irving on trial.<eos> Laura's right.<eos> Thank you. Laura's very sound on this.<eos> And if we focus on his lies, and, equally important, his motives for lying, there's absolutely no reason we should have to produce eyewitnesses to these horrors.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What do you mean, that the survivors won't appear?<eos> No, no, no. No, we don't want them to.<eos> You don't want their testimony? No.<eos> Under no circumstances.
Went up to the roof, presumably?<eos> Yes, but they popped out, uh, above the roof.<eos> The pillars "popped out"?<eos> The pillars went through a hole in the roof and the earth, which was arranged on top of the roof, and then there was a little, kind of, chimney on top of that.<eos> What was the purpose of that, architecturally speaking?<eos> Because these were hollow pillars and these were the pillars in which the crystals of Zyklon-B were inserted into the gas chamber.<eos> My Lord, you can see the layout.<eos> You can see the pillars with the wire mesh columns next to them.<eos> You have drawn in those wire mesh columns, have you not?<eos> In the sketches and on the computer?
He thinks that... you don't care about his life.<eos> Or him, me, the kids, his job and all.<eos> D'you know what he does? For a living?<eos> Do you know his...<eos> I'm not criticizing...<eos> Really, don't take it as...<eos> - I'm not criticizing.<eos> But... do you know his job?<eos> He makes tools.<eos> In a small shop, not from here.
C'mere!<eos> Shut the door. Antoine will see me.<eos> He'll rag on me, again.<eos> I'm at 3 per day, max, so...<eos> I quit quitting. I felt too dumb.<eos> Hanging in there?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Three words. Same old, right.<eos> Always these... two or three-word answers.<eos> Like on your postcards.
Well, she's got Down's syndrome.<eos> Whatever syndrome, a hell of a big one.<eos> Down, Up, Wide...<eos> She's got it.<eos> Someone could've told her, "Don't call them all Denise."<eos> I don't like it much.<eos> I don't like it... I find it mean, and unseemly.<eos> It's funny, c'mon!<eos> St. Catherine's among us.<eos> - You alright? - Yeah.
What?<eos> Antoine, Antoine!<eos> Yes, Antoine! What?<eos> That's my goddamn name, yeah!<eos> All day long! Fucking pain in the ass!<eos> Fine. I'll work on my timing!<eos> I was about to say it's lovely being together.<eos> Later, maybe.<eos> Excuse me, Catherine.<eos> No worries.
I was young, I can't remember, but there was no drama... tragic stuff, or betrayals, or murders.<eos> Shit like that... So he'd avoid us.<eos> He doesn't care.<eos> He doesn't feel the need for "us".<eos> He wants to be far.<eos> He's almost farther sitting on our couch.<eos> He's the sad one.<eos> He missed all those years, never saw you grow.<eos> And life went on, as it does today, invariably.<eos> Just like in books.
- What's up? You alright?<eos> - Very much interested to see.<eos> OK.<eos> All that work.<eos> It's encapsulated the front part of the ligament.<eos> Here.<eos> - This sector here.<eos> - Here was tender.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - On the bone.
Eight, nine, ten.<eos> Seven. Seven. 24. 25.<eos> Good job.<eos> Everybody knows that I'm the coach and I have the authority.<eos> I don't have to wear it on my face.<eos> We joke a lot.<eos> We try to make the whole thing exciting because he likes fun.<eos> Remember you said you'd do a high jump? Where was it? In Europe or something?<eos> - Ostrava.<eos> - Ostrava?
I pushed you too hard.<eos> Get. Out.<eos> Bless you, my son.<eos> Come to me, you poor sinner.<eos> Accept me.<eos> Mr. Jaspers, you forgot to put pants on again.<eos> How are you feeling, Mr. Thorn?<eos> I'm in a mental hospital.<eos> No, you're in a regular hospital.<eos> Just in a psychiatric wing.
To serve is to honor.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Don't tell me you forgot the school motto.<eos> In the flesh.<eos> How the hell are you, Cray?<eos> I'm fine. And you?<eos> Never better.<eos> It's so funny us running into each other.<eos> The police we're asking me about you today.<eos> About me?
Just stop this craziness.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> I knew you'd come.<eos> Did you like my gift?<eos> We used to cut classes and come here, you know?<eos> No one would know where we were...<eos> You killed Cray.<eos> Why?<eos> He spoke to that detective about you.<eos> About us.
He knew shit about Thorn, so Thorn sent his shrink down here to take him out.<eos> That's... that... That's how he does it.<eos> No fingerprints.<eos> He, uh, threatened my... my family, my son.<eos> He set my car on fire.<eos> He had a dog attack me right here in the station.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, look, we can't trust you out there with a... with a gun and a badge, okay?<eos> I want 'em.<eos> All right.
Let go! - When you arise, you can be reborn!<eos> - Pull me back up now!<eos> No!<eos> - It will fall away!<eos> - Christ promises the Resurrection!<eos> - No, no!<eos> No! You will be saved.<eos> Okay. Okay, come on.<eos> Over here.<eos> Okay.
I screwed up my daughter's first day at soccer and I hand-searched my son's poo for a pen cap and my poor dog has vertigo.<eos> I mean, who knew that that was even a real thing, you guys?<eos> God, I'm drowning at work and my boss is a fucking moron and...<eos> Three hours ago I may or may not have committed a felony hit-and-run.<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I quit.<eos> Hey, what can I get ya?<eos> Oh, Scotch.
He did.<eos> You know, Dr. King got shot, too.<eos> He did, by a bad man.<eos> Like Eugene Linwood?<eos> Yeah, that's right. Just like Eugene Linwood.<eos> My friend, um, his mom is gonna pick me up after school.<eos> Okay, Marcus. Well, uh, I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.<eos> Oh, and I'm sorry your mom died.<eos> Thanks, Marcus.<eos> Bye, Mr. Mac.
Basta, both of you.<eos> He feels bad enough. Yeah, and how do you feel?<eos> Do you even give a shit anymore?<eos> - Fuck you. - Hey! Hey!<eos> It's our sixth fucking bank.<eos> We shouldn't even be in this position. MAN: What the hell's wrong with you?<eos> -Either of you guys carrying?<eos> -Really? - We're standing on the brink, you're gonna do coke?<eos> - I need to focus.<eos> - On what, our impending doom?
My what, sir?<eos> Oh, yes, I've been directed to arrange one by your good friend, the dragon, miss Dix.<eos> A meeting?<eos> Not surprising, knowing miss dix's fondness for hot air and hierarchy.<eos> She is the wife no man ever wanted.<eos> Sir, you need to acquaint yourself with current theories of head trauma and aphemia.<eos> I am well-acquainted, but I see no reason to put a hole in that man's head when what he needs is a kick in the ass back to the nearest battlefield.<eos> Then allow me to do the procedure. I will not.<eos> You are not authorized to do a trephination.<eos> Not on him, and not on a coconut.
"We"?<eos> Who "we"?<eos> You from some fancy house in Philadelphia?<eos> You in school, dressed in fine clothes, never beat, ever sold?<eos> Ain't that right, Mr. diggs?<eos> Now, where I come from... seen things, heard things, done some things.<eos> Ain't no "we," thank you.<eos> And I don't need nothing.<eos> Not from a man named Miller and not from you.<eos> Home so soon?
You know their faces.<eos> Arrest them!<eos> You can't do that!<eos> You again.<eos> You're becoming a nuisance.<eos> Don't touch her.<eos> So this is the husband?<eos> You have married a world of trouble there, Musketeer.<eos> You should keep her on a leash. - On a leash?<eos> - Mmm.
All right, fellas, bring it in. Bring it in. Bring it in.<eos> Once the fight's done, the dispute's over. Agreed?<eos> Agreed?<eos> We agree?<eos> Agreed? Hey, woman.<eos> Hey, who you calling woman?<eos> Be me and you in the ring next.<eos> Let's fight.<eos> I need to talk to you, mate. Later, Jimmy.<eos> After the fight, eh?
So has she got a name yet?<eos> Clients can call her what they like.<eos> My name is Araluen.<eos> We don't use our real names around here.<eos> Good. Introduction's over.<eos> We're all friends now, aren't we, pet?<eos> Scoot. That one. Thank you.<eos> - Pulse is steady.<eos> - BP normal.<eos> So far, so good.
Wait.<eos> - He's here.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> It's the big guy, maliyan.<eos> We need to talk to him first.<eos> Do you think this would be all right?<eos> - I'd say so.<eos> - Okay. It's best you go on your own from here.<eos> They might not talk if I'm there.<eos> All right.
- He's here.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> It's the big guy, maliyan.<eos> We need to talk to him first.<eos> Do you think this would be all right?<eos> - I'd say so.<eos> - Okay. It's best you go on your own from here.<eos> They might not talk if I'm there.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.
I'm here to speak with my son.<eos> Who won't even look at me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Some bad shit's been going down.<eos> Jimmy... he's messed things up.<eos> What are you on about?<eos> Koen.<eos> He needs your help.<eos> Koen's here?<eos> In the Zone?
It's a dangerous place.<eos> It's not your battle.<eos> Someone needs to take a stand.<eos> Those CA animals used capsicum spray on an unarmed man today.<eos> Exactly, a volatile situation.<eos> It's not just you to consider.<eos> Ah, you thinking about your heir?<eos> You are, aren't you?<eos> Our baby is in rudest of rude health.<eos> Okay?
Took a while, mostly nights, but I got it.<eos> Didn't do much good this year.<eos> Got passed over for promotion.<eos> College wasn't what I thought it was gonna be.<eos> I look at Aria, Spencer and even Hanna it all seemed to click for them.<eos> - Not for you?<eos> - No.<eos> I had a hard time.<eos> When my dad died, I just couldn't see a point to it.<eos> To the college?

Oh, thank you, pretty eyes.<eos> Knock knock.<eos> Ezra?<eos> 'Oh, yes, actually'<eos> Jillian, Aria just walked in.<eos> Um, would you like to chat with her too?<eos> Oh, no, that's fine.<eos> I totally understand.<eos> Yes, I will pass along the message.<eos> Okay.
- Go ahead to eat.<eos> - The doctor?<eos> Next time you have questions about the routines let's take it bilaterally, so the boys don't get confused.<eos> Problems with the urination is not unusual for boys of your age.<eos> Can you say "ah"?<eos> Jump on one leg.<eos> Jump on the other leg.<eos> Evidently normal growth except for a clubfoot.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> However, fully functional.
On that day that we did the "Karate Kid" marathon.<eos> Forget the workbooks!<eos> Why don't we move on to social studies?<eos> How many studies do we think are social, hmm?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Yeah, we miss Miss Feldman.<eos> She's right here!<eos> It's me, Miss Feldman!<eos> Nothing about this is weird.<eos> Okay?
Oh, no.<eos> Caroline...<eos> I want you to stop using the System.<eos> If the System works as you say, then, because I willed it, it should happen.<eos> But...<eos> I demand you stop using the System.<eos> But I don't want to stop using the System.<eos> Yes, but I do want you to stop.<eos> Okay!<eos> Okay!
In the last seven years, Have you consulted with a health care professional Regarding an emotional or mental health condition?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Prior to prisons, has the government ever investigated your background Or given you a security clearance?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I was an army regular.<eos> What was your clearance level?<eos> Cat 2, confidential.<eos> How long have you been with prisons?<eos> Two years.<eos> Always technical workshop?
Why you never checked earlier?<eos> I didn't know ah Tiong's not working there anymore.<eos> Did you try other suppliers?<eos> Yeah, I called a few.<eos> But they also don't have three-quarter inch.<eos> I asked you to go down last week.<eos> You go down or not?<eos> Not yet, chief.<eos> I thought it was better to call them first.<eos> What about beach road?

Not yet, chief.<eos> I thought it was better to call them first.<eos> What about beach road?<eos> The fishing shops there?<eos> I don't know those, chief.<eos> I know somewhere.<eos> - Like fishing shops?<eos> - No, chief.<eos> It's like a warehouse, for boatmen.<eos> At Sembawang.
That's a pinion.<eos> We use that to tie the legs.<eos> What if he can't stand up?<eos> We let him sit on the chair.<eos> We put on the hood so they don't see the noose.<eos> But usually they're okay.<eos> By the time they get here, they've accepted their fate.<eos> Ready to go.<eos> I remember this one guy.<eos> In '85 or '86.
That's that.<eos> What's up with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You okay for tomorrow?<eos> I'm okay, chief.<eos> Cigarette?<eos> Put the oil back.<eos> Come, I'll give you a ride home.<eos> Where should I turn?<eos> At this traffic light.
How fucked up are you?<eos> I've written up your charge sheet.<eos> In the morning, I'll send it in for your disciplinary review.<eos> You can get lost now.<eos> Hi, this is Suhaila.<eos> I can't come to the phone right now.<eos> Please leave me a message, and I'll call you back as soon as I can.<eos> Sis.<eos> How's Australia?<eos> You okay?
That was it.<eos> Or stay up here with me.<eos> It will be so much fun.<eos> We'll have mother-daughter slumber parties every night.<eos> Let's go check out that other bedroom.<eos> Jackson, perfect timing.<eos> I baked your favorite... chocolate cake.<eos> Mom, Mom, Mom, if this is another bribe about Kimmy and Ramona moving in, I'm cool.<eos> I can just go hide in my room.<eos> My boy cave.
Well, I learned and so will you.<eos> I love you, Steph.<eos> You, too.<eos> Goodbye, everybody!<eos> Bye!<eos> Uh-oh. Text from Becky...<eos> "Dear Jesse, me and the fat dog are enjoying my lasagna.<eos> Your dinner is in the doghouse where you'll be sleeping."<eos> Actually, it's worth it not to have to eat that lasagna.<eos> Okay, first things first...
And then I forgot my whole speech.<eos> Hola, shalom, howdy-do and welcome to Ramona's World, my vlog exploring the world of Ramona, with your host, Ramona!<eos> Today, I'm babysitting my little buddy Tommy.<eos> Say hi to the Internet, Tommy.<eos> So, if you're thinking about babysitting... first, you'll need a baby.<eos> Second, parents with money.<eos> And third...<eos> Well, I guess that's all you really need.<eos> My cohost is experiencing technical difficulties.<eos> In his pants.
- I'm completely free.<eos> - Great.<eos> I was a little worried when you didn't mention the flowers that I got you.<eos> Those were from you?<eos> Yeah, it was just a little gesture.<eos> A little gesture?<eos> That was nothing. Wait till we go on a real date.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Ooh, I think I just lost a filling.<eos> - Like just this second?
Let's just tell the world we're back together.<eos> We are not back together.<eos> We are secretly contemplating considering mulling over the possibility of maybe getting back together-ish.<eos> If that's how you feel, then, yes, we should keep this a secret from Ramona.<eos> How are we gonna sneak you out of here?<eos> I will simply climb out the window.<eos> -We're on the third floor.<eos> -That's nothing.<eos> One time I escaped from a hotel rooftop in Barcelona wearing nothing but a matador's cap.<eos> And not on my head.
Is this what the kids call the walk of shame?<eos> There's no shame. And no walk.<eos> I took an Uber.<eos> I had the best night last night.<eos> It so happens that your little sister is now a little famous.<eos> Okay, there are no kids in the room.<eos> I guess it's safe to ask "what for"?<eos> Well, since I broke up with Hunter Pence on national TV, singing "Take Me Out to the Ball Game," every single guy in the city wants to take me out for peanuts and crackerjack. And tequila shots.<eos> - Aspirin? - Ugh.<eos> No. Mylanta.
No.<eos> What did I do?<eos> You got the perfect addition to an Indian-themed party.<eos> I did?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> It's in the backyard.<eos> You are going to love this.<eos> Holy cow!<eos> Yes, exactly, it's a sacred cow.<eos> In the kitchen?
- You're watching the kids, right?<eos> - Oh, sure.<eos> In fact, I just had a nice chat with Jackson about how the older sister, I mean brother, shouldn't take advantage of the younger sister, I mean brother.<eos> Oh, I get it. This is about Twister.<eos> For the last time,<eos> I beat you because I out-played you, I out-witted you, I out-Twistered you.<eos> Honestly, I'm that good.<eos> Alright. You. Me.<eos> I've got a date.<eos> High afternoon.
Art's not a spy.<eos> You know what?<eos> Screw this. No, Beth, please. Please don't leave.<eos> I don't have many friends.<eos> Well, then we need each other.<eos> I'll do the legwork, but... go back to these cheek choppers.<eos> Black female, white male.<eos> Where did they kill Basspair86?<eos> An ambulance.<eos> An ambulance?
It's my daughter's.<eos> Please don't mix it up with anything.<eos> I won't. I won't.<eos> Okay.<eos> You repeat after me.<eos> "I promise that I will not gun up until Beth has shown me basic firearms safety."<eos> I promise.<eos> And...<eos> "I promise to put Cosima's tuition and airfare into her account this afternoon."<eos> Yes, fine, fine.
- Bob?<eos> - Yeah. And now I have to stand up in front of an empty map with nothing to say like a goddamn birthday clown.<eos> Bob Andersen? Yeah.<eos> Bob fucking Andersen.<eos> Are we having the same conversation?<eos> Jean?<eos> Hey, Jean! Jean!<eos> Hurry.<eos> - What do you know?<eos> - About what?
- Yeah. And now I have to stand up in front of an empty map with nothing to say like a goddamn birthday clown.<eos> Bob Andersen? Yeah.<eos> Bob fucking Andersen.<eos> Are we having the same conversation?<eos> Jean?<eos> Hey, Jean! Jean!<eos> Hurry.<eos> - What do you know?<eos> - About what?<eos> About what?
Take Mike and Mrs. Nelson.<eos> Something drew them to each other, you know?<eos> But now?<eos> God.<eos> It's like we all have these different versions of ourselves competing to be the real us.<eos> You ever think about stuff like that?<eos> It's your turn.<eos> I don't think I'm very good at this.<eos> Sometimes, I'll be daydreaming at work, and I'll just gaze off and imagine like this big wad of shoelaces, you know?<eos> Like in a box.
We had wanted to show you some film from the scene, but I'm sure that if you...<eos> Kenny, where are you with the projector?<eos> - You'll be able to catch it.<eos> - Keep swimming.<eos> So...<eos> In keeping with the WZRB policy, don't give up on it.<eos> - Presenting the most immediate - keep trying to fix it.<eos> And complete reports of local blood and guts,<eos> TV 30 presents what is believed to be a television first.<eos> In living color...
Richard?<eos> What're you doing in bed with that woman?<eos> I'm his wife.<eos> That's no good here.<eos> Get your pants on, boy.<eos> You get out of that bed.<eos> Get out of that bed!<eos> All right.<eos> Come on.<eos> All right.
It... It was my mistake.<eos> Your Honor, I think...<eos> Fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't come back here again.<eos> You do and you go to prison.<eos> This doesn't happen a second time.<eos> Sidney, Donald, come on down.<eos> Hey!<eos> Okay.
Your Honor, I think...<eos> Fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't come back here again.<eos> You do and you go to prison.<eos> This doesn't happen a second time.<eos> Sidney, Donald, come on down.<eos> Hey!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.
-What have you done?<eos> -We had a math test.<eos> -How did it go?<eos> -I fell asleep.<eos> You didn't fall asleep during the test?<eos> No, I'm only joking.<eos> When are you coming home?<eos> It'll be a little while longer until I'll be home.<eos> People keep asking if I'm worried.<eos> Worried about me? -Yes.
Mum's coming soon.<eos> -Okay. Sleep tight.<eos> 9-8, we've received reliable info of a possible suicide attack.<eos> The hospital is the target and the adjacent market is under threat.<eos> From the roofs we have a view of the market and the roads.<eos> 3-2-Charlie and 3-2-Delta on the hospital roof.<eos> 3-2-Alpha, 3-2-Bravo: Eastern roof. 3-2-Echo, 3-2-Golf:<eos> My position is by the cars with 3-2-Fox and 3-4-Lima.<eos> Notify me when you're in position.<eos> -All good?
-3-Alpha reading you.<eos> 3-2-Echo and 3-2-Golf are in position on the southern roof.<eos> Copy.<eos> -3-Alpha, this is 3-2-Alpha.<eos> -3-Alpha reading you.<eos> 3-2-Alpha and 3-2-Bravo in position on the eastern roof.<eos> Copy.<eos> Man under the eaves.<eos> 9-8, we've spotted a threat.<eos> In the north-eastern part of the market.

He rolled up his sleeves.<eos> No visible detonators or cables.<eos> I wouldn't have seen it that fast.<eos> -Did you like the food yesterday?<eos> -Speaking of dodo?<eos> -Yours or the chef's?<eos> -Mine.<eos> Why are you even here?<eos> You should be running a restaurant.<eos> Two o'clock.
-Yes, you may.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> -What's happening?<eos> Would you like to meet China's Minister of Energy?<eos> -Yes, what should we to talk about?<eos> -Perfect timing, Nora!<eos> -Okay?<eos> You're ruining the agreement of the century.<eos> Where are your seats?<eos> -In the stalls.
Yeah, well...<eos> That's a good question.<eos> -I like the ponytail. -Thanks.<eos> How's the dressage coming along?<eos> -The dressage?<eos> -Of the horses.<eos> I do races, not dressage.<eos> -I'm going to cook rice. -Rice?<eos> I'm taking a shower.<eos> -So, yeah...
I saw Hauser was a white shield on the original taskforce.<eos> Called a buddy of mine in the DA's office, got a writ, got him on an NYPD chopper.<eos> - Not a big deal.<eos> - Nice humble brag.<eos> - Santiani was okay with this?<eos> - Well, I twisted her arm.<eos> The more we know about St. Valentine's, the more chance we have of saving Rachelle.<eos> You can unlock him.<eos> He's an incarcerated prisoner on a writ.<eos> Not on vacation.
I don't know if much happened beyond some bad judgment.<eos> Oh, I'll bring them in, talk to them.<eos> Talk to all your players together.<eos> Avoid any of them feeling singled out. That would be my suggestion.<eos> If there is anything, bring it to my attention.<eos> If there's nothing -- oh, we'll find that out real fast.<eos> Well, then, that's the end of it.<eos> They trust you.<eos> That means a lot more than me going down there and turning it into an inquisition.<eos> Okay?
- Right here.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> - Stand back. Everyone back.<eos> - Okay, this one is me, Tee.<eos> Dr. Alexander to the ambulance bay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - What do we got?<eos> Female, 30s, trauma to her wrists and abdomen from MVA.<eos> - Vitals unstable.<eos> - Okay.
Ichabod Crane.<eos> Who is asking?<eos> Jack Walters.<eos> I'm a federal agent.<eos> I'd like you to come with me.<eos> Some people in D.C. need to have words with you.<eos> Do I have a choice in the matter?<eos> Officially, yes, but...<eos> I suggest you not make things difficult.<eos> Very well.
You know it.<eos> They're fucking sure of it.<eos> Those animals are used to you putting them down now.<eos> Hardly even whimper as it happens.<eos> Our sesh, while fun, is a waste of your time.<eos> And mine.<eos> Go get 'em!<eos> Fuckin' a. Fuckin' a.<eos> You just did it, didn't you?<eos> All right.
Our investors pay us a 3% management fee and 30% of their profits, and you want me to tell them we're buying some fucking apple? And you want me to tell them we're buying some fucking apple?<eos> Sorry, axe.<eos> I-I guess I'm just not seeing the matrix right now.<eos> That's a little unsettling, Donnie...<eos> Since seeing the matrix is your entire fucking job.<eos> It's kind of like if you were a hurdler and instead of jumping over the fucking hurdles...<eos> It's okay, Donnie.<eos> You'll see it again.<eos> Hang in.<eos> Okay, guys?
No, it wasn't.<eos> You don't make them.<eos> And that matters.<eos> But what matters more right now is that Victor is exactly the wrong person to fire that way.<eos> That was spur-of-the-moment.<eos> It was a spur-of-the-moment fuck-up.<eos> His entire psychological makeup sets him up to react very poorly to public humiliation.<eos> The same things that made him a profit center for you will make him a difficult adversary if he's not handled right.<eos> He will stew and obsess and find a way to exact revenge on you. And find a way to exact revenge on you.<eos> Okay.
Somebody wanted to hurt birch, and they wanted us on the ass end.<eos> So they leaked it. So they leaked it.<eos> And I do not like it.<eos> We need the reins back in our hands.<eos> Understood.<eos> You want me to stay on this axe/decker thing?<eos> No.<eos> Set that aside.<eos> Until we know at least as much as this fucking reporter knows, let's keep the brights on Steven birch.<eos> All right.
This doesn't have to be over.<eos> I'm actually relieved we settled.<eos> Comfortable?<eos> For the first time all fucking day.<eos> Well, I have someone coming in here soon, and they might be a little freaked to see their boss...<eos> I just came by to say "thank you" and "sorry"...<eos> Two words I don't say very often. Two words I don't say very often.<eos> So it's handled with Victor?<eos> You nailed it...<eos> On every count.
Perla, we have to find Maggi. Hurry up!<eos> - Have you seen the kids?<eos> - No, I thought they were downstairs<eos> No, I've already checked downstairs<eos> - Have you seen the girls?<eos> - No, I've not seen them<eos> Girls?<eos> Maggi, where are you?<eos> Mum and Dad, look down the street. I'll go up that way - I'll look down there<eos> - Thórhildur!
If there's anything you need, you just talk to him, OK? - OK.<eos> - Have a nice day.<eos> - See you later<eos> - Do you smoke?<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - So, what's for lunch?<eos> - Stew.<eos> Is that all you can cook?<eos> Give me some money and I can see what I can buy in the store.<eos> All right.
Or else?<eos> I didn't touch it<eos> I just took those photos<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know<eos> It's just... There's something fascinating about it<eos> Why did you want photos of the body?<eos> How did you get in?<eos> - I broke a window<eos> - Which window?
I just took those photos<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know<eos> It's just... There's something fascinating about it<eos> Why did you want photos of the body?<eos> How did you get in?<eos> - I broke a window<eos> - Which window?<eos> The one by the entrance<eos> - The main entrance? - Yeah.
You can go back to Hrafn and tell him the answer is still no<eos> The land will not be sold, while I'm alive<eos> What do you think?<eos> Unlikely that he killed anyone Or stole the body<eos> Yeah. But he's still! a suspect<eos> That questioning never happened<eos> We were told not to talk to him<eos> He'll have to stay there until Trausti arrives<eos> Could you find the report about the fire back in '08?<eos> The fish factory fire?
They are, too<eos> Girls... won't it be nice to move to Reykjavík?<eos> Yes<eos> Andri - We finally got Björn Weissmann's file<eos> - The guy from Switzerland?<eos> Does it say he's had a kidney operation?<eos> No, nothing about that here it's obvious our guy had a kidney operation.<eos> I think so it could've been an illegal surgical operation<eos> - OK, just keep looking<eos> - All right then
Maybe we should look for it?<eos> Jóhanna saw you arrest Hjörtur<eos> Do you have something on him?<eos> No. We have other things to discuss with him<eos> How are the girls?<eos> They're fine<eos> Their biggest worry is that they'll have to go to school tomorrow<eos> Well, OK... I just wanted to hear from you<eos> - I'll talk to you later<eos> - Bye - Bye
He just was celebrating moving back home<eos> Moving back home from Spain.<eos> Yes, that's what he said<eos> Could you describe him to a sketch artist?<eos> Well, I... I could try<eos> I'll help you any way I can<eos> Thank you, Friðrik<eos> Let us know if you remember anything else<eos> - You have a sketch artist in mind?<eos> - Ásgeir
I'm convinced Sigurður was involved somehow Whether he was forced into it or not<eos> People sometimes commit suicide because they feel trapped<eos> They have no other way out<eos> Tell me the truth<eos> Geirmundur was killed last Thursday evening<eos> Where was Sigurður then?<eos> He was here with me<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Hrafn called him, late<eos> Sometime after ten.
You wouldn't want someone to turn a blind eye if these were your daughters, would you?<eos> I thought... he was a messenger.<eos> Just a guy who carried the money.<eos> Could you turn off the tape?<eos> I will not say another word if the tape is running.<eos> We have to have it on tape.<eos> He's not an engineer.<eos> Doesn't know a thing about engines.<eos> And he never leaves the boat.<eos> Not even in Denmark.
You knew the engineer on the ferry, the Faroe Islander, didn't you?<eos> Is this some sort of cop game?<eos> You look at me with a stern face while they ask me unanswerable questions<eos> And I'm supposed to what?<eos> Break down and disclose some terrible secret?<eos> - We need your fingerprints<eos> - Oh, why is that?<eos> We need to check everyone that might've been with Sigurður the night Geirmundur was murdered<eos> Where were you that night?<eos> At home, probably
- Oh, why is that?<eos> We need to check everyone that might've been with Sigurður the night Geirmundur was murdered<eos> Where were you that night?<eos> At home, probably<eos> Alone?<eos> I usually am<eos> If we check your phone records, will we see that Hrafn sailed?<eos> Hrafn was my oldest friend, we spoke often<eos> What did you talk about that night?<eos> Geirmundur?
Grab a bite or something? Anything?<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to keep practicing with Dajon, if I want our chemistry to be believable, you know?<eos> We're new partners. Mm-hmm.<eos> So we have to feel each other out.<eos> Right.<eos> Promise after all this is over, everything will be different.<eos> Cool.<eos> All right.<eos> Bye, guys.
Okay.<eos> But I'm watching you.<eos> Okay, guys, let's set it off.<eos> And make sure to hit this hard, okay?<eos> All right, get low.<eos> And five, six, seven, eight.<eos> And one, and two, and three, and four, and five, six, seven, eight.<eos> And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight.<eos> - All right, hit it from the top.<eos> - All right.
Or maybe I'm just scared.<eos> -You're scared?<eos> Want to talk about being scared?<eos> I grew up with a father who didn't speak for two days before a race.<eos> His horses weren't good enough, yet he swore to win anyway.<eos> That vibe he created... That was scary.<eos> Well... The thing is... When I saw that you were scared...<eos> Come on, Rikard!<eos> -Cut the pike monster.<eos> -Here?
One, two, three.<eos> 9-8.<eos> Between fifteen and twenty dead and ten to twelve wounded.<eos> Send QRF and report to our own.<eos> Salaam.<eos> Can you wake Rikard?<eos> Can't we let him sleep?<eos> School's closed today.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.
-What?<eos> -Take a look.<eos> Zamani studied in London, at the School of Oriental and African Studies.<eos> This is his yearbook photo.<eos> Find one mistake in that photo.<eos> Is that Hektor Stolt-Hansen?<eos> They fucking studied together!<eos> It looks like it.<eos> -So you had no idea?<eos> -About the smuggling?
The Ambassador has anchored it politically.<eos> The Mullah is a liberal Taliban member.<eos> Does his views go to the top of the Taliban?<eos> We think so.<eos> What if we can do it?<eos> A meeting between the Taliban and the government is a huge step towards peace in Afghanistan.<eos> Hello.<eos> We're about to eat.<eos> Where should you put your helmet?<eos> -In the hall.
We think so.<eos> What if we can do it?<eos> A meeting between the Taliban and the government is a huge step towards peace in Afghanistan.<eos> Hello.<eos> We're about to eat.<eos> Where should you put your helmet?<eos> -In the hall.<eos> -That's right.<eos> -Where's mum?<eos> -At work.
-I can leave it here.<eos> -No, put it away.<eos> Dad, do you think it would've been better if grandpa wasn't a jockey?<eos> -Why do you ask?<eos> -He has to take a lot of painkillers.<eos> Yes, but grandpa loved to ride, and he was good at it.<eos> It's important to do what you like and are good at.<eos> You shouldn't worry about how it's going to turn out.<eos> -Are you afraid of dying?<eos> -In Afghanistan?
-Hi.<eos> -It's good to see you.<eos> -Working hard?<eos> -I have to, to get back on my feet.<eos> Yes.<eos> -Could you help me with some sit-ups? -Yes, of course.<eos> -Where should I go?<eos> -You can stand over there.<eos> Put your hands there, so I don't topple over.<eos> -Okay? -Yes.
I should've come sooner. I'm sorry.<eos> It's nothing to be scared of, it's just a couple of legs.<eos> Everything else works.<eos> Could you help me up?<eos> I have to make sure I don't fall backwards.<eos> Thank you.<eos> -Should I help you with the pants?<eos> There, you're good to go.<eos> Where you at the Concert Hall?<eos> At the Concert Hall?
-Correct.<eos> -What about Adella?<eos> -She's on assignment.<eos> What kind of assignment?<eos> You're asking me to go on TV as a national cripple, for your sake, and you still can't tell me anything?<eos> She's guarding Wasima Zamani.<eos> Is Wasima Zamani in Norway?<eos> -Why's Adella guarding her?<eos> -Someone tried to kill her.<eos> In Norway?
-That's not what I'm asking.<eos> Think about it.<eos> NRK News has gained access to unique footage from an assignment in Afghanistan.<eos> No visible weapons, but something's going down.<eos> -Any visible weapons? -Negative.<eos> Let's take them out.<eos> Damn, it felt good to kill.<eos> Rasch, you stayed with these men in Afghanistan.<eos> Do you understand their behaviour?<eos> Yes, to a certain extent.
A few dates.<eos> Have you told Iris anything?<eos> Just enough to keep her safe.<eos> There's our cue.<eos> Strange that your work has gotten so quiet.<eos> If homicides are down, Samaritan is preventing murders.<eos> Maybe it's not all bad.<eos> Not all bad is not good enough.<eos> Finch, how did you teach your Machine to be good?<eos> By example.
What's in the case, Brent?<eos> My orders, daily briefings, emails.<eos> Open it.<eos> Afraid I can't do that, not unless you have top-secret clearance.<eos> Consider this my clearance.<eos> Open it.<eos> So we done here?<eos> Takes a while for the Phenobarbital to wear off.<eos> I'm guessing you're not really in strategy development.<eos> At least not for your company.
There are people disappearing all over this town.<eos> Now John's gone too.<eos> I am not gonna let this one lie.<eos> Not this time.<eos> Wonderful. Now we have to save Mr. Reese from Samaritan and Detective Fusco from himself.<eos> John needs our help now.<eos> You have to give us something to work with.<eos> Krupa gave me a hard drive.<eos> Where?<eos> Your apartment?
I don't see any backpack.<eos> Listen, I've waited long enough.<eos> No more roundabout instructions.<eos> Quit being a wimp and talk to me.<eos> Facility with... looked like Washington D.C....<eos> AM 520, WKCP.<eos> He can't stay on our heels forever.<eos> Shaw is out there somewhere.<eos> _<eos> How about over by the fireplace?
This way.<eos> Shaw, wait.<eos> How did Greer know we were gonna capture him?<eos> What?<eos> He knew it.<eos> That's why he created a trap and implanted a USB.<eos> Somebody warned him.<eos> You got something to say? You better nut up and say it.<eos> Did you warn him?<eos> Not a chance in hell.
If we received Ko's number, he's either a victim or a perpetrator, so keep a close watch.<eos> Jeff, how are you were able to get a reservation here?<eos> I've been trying to get one for my boss for months.<eos> Made some new connections.<eos> You always said I should get out of my shell more.<eos> Looks like a lot in your life has changed.<eos> Still the same guy you fell in love with at Jimmie Cone.<eos> Haven't lost your charm.<eos> So who are you working for, again?<eos> A new company.
Is this just another one of your lame arguments to convince me that Samaritan is the good ASI?<eos> This isn't Greer's idea at all.<eos> The simulations are built on your memories.<eos> Don't you recall your mission to South Africa?<eos> You killed a Somali bomb maker in this very prison.<eos> Sneaked into the same cell via the same route, through the wall.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I was never in South Africa.<eos> I was in Germany.<eos> And a lot of other countries, but...
Our Founding Fathers...<eos> Okay, it's showtime.<eos> Where are you, Shaw?<eos> Headed to higher ground.<eos> Gonna get a bird's-eye view.<eos> Sorry, Agent.<eos> I'm gonna have to commandeer your weapon.<eos> Oh, .300 Winchester Magnum bolt action.<eos> Oh, you'll do just fine.<eos> In position.
He sacrificed himself in an attempt to stop me.<eos> From doing what?<eos> Cleaning the slate.<eos> The Machine's triggered a bomb thread.<eos> They're evacuating the building.<eos> If you turn right, when you leave this room, you'll see the south exit at the end of the corridor.<eos> There'll be a car waiting there. Let it drive for you.<eos> You have two minutes.<eos> We're not leaving here without you.<eos> 6:00.
- Don't you remember?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did the monster come back?<eos> - Yeah and attacked Seoul again.<eos> - What?<eos> But not as bad.<eos> You know they're, their appearance, monster and timeplace, but itjust stood there like made a bunch of weird hand gestures.<eos> But it did destroy a few buildings and people got hurt. they get a false story.<eos> - What time did it happened?<eos> - 8.05. - The same...
What?<eos> Well, not the only thing happened.<eos> I'm pretty sure that's me.<eos> Had you ever been in the park at 8 to 5 before?<eos> I can't recall.<eos> I don't think so<eos> You don't think so..<eos> You don't... come on.<eos> Been in the park... that same one? No.<eos> No, different one.
But you never know that you live before the war.<eos> Do you think they see the stars?<eos> -Who?<eos> -The home.<eos> It is the day where now.<eos> Why is it no stars of the day?<eos> Sometimes you have to turn off the lights to see.<eos> A few years earlier<eos> Like when you close your eyes to see their dreams?<eos> Yeah, about that.
It is the day where now.<eos> Why is it no stars of the day?<eos> Sometimes you have to turn off the lights to see.<eos> A few years earlier<eos> Like when you close your eyes to see their dreams?<eos> Yeah, about that.<eos> Laura, when are we going home? Soon.<eos> Come closer.<eos> In the morning we wake up in Paris.<eos> Paris.
I really want to.<eos> Kate? How was it?<eos> It was good.<eos> And.<eos> Yes, it was good.<eos> It is not his brother.<eos> Prepare a room for systrarna Barlow on the guest floor.<eos> Ja, sir.<eos> "They directed their affection needed against any brother in arms" "and slept side by side under the same mantle of the stars shine bright."<eos> "Their constant drifting" ...
Three, two, one.<eos> I'm so glad you two are working things out.<eos> He's so good with her.<eos> Not too bad on the eyes, either.<eos> Yeah, he's a rock star when he's not screwing his clients.<eos> Joke.<eos> Can you take her, honey?<eos> I'm running late.<eos> Come on, we talked about this.<eos> About what?
Two... Olly olly oxen free<eos> honey.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I wet the bed.<eos> Hey, it's ok. It happens to the best of us.<eos> No it doesn't.<eos> Even daddy does when he drinks too much.<eos> Come on. Let's go.<eos> Are you alright? Oh my gosh.<eos> Jane.
How are you?<eos> -Do you have time?<eos> -Sure.<eos> Hello. This is Johanne Riiser.<eos> Could you meet me at the Stop the Presses pub in 45 minutes?<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> -Call me when you're done.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Hey! Hi, horsey!
-He's been briefed.<eos> -Good.<eos> -Do I have to turn myself in?<eos> Keep it short. No backstory from Afghanistan, no knowledge of Sharif.<eos> -I need to call Johanne... -No time.<eos> She's occupied.<eos> -Can he stay here?<eos> -It's a really bad time.<eos> He's detoxifying.<eos> -From what?
Are you okay?<eos> "They say that the time in Heaven<eos> "is compared to the blink of an eye<eos> "for us on this Earth.<eos> "Sometimes I think of Adam running<eos> "through a beautiful field of wild flowers.<eos> "He's so happy, completely caught up in what he's doing.<eos> "But then he looks back<eos> "like he used to do when he ran ahead of me<eos> "in airports or malls or wherever.
You know that.<eos> Leave me alone. No.<eos> I won't leave you alone.<eos> - No?<eos> - No. I know you're angry at me, and that's okay.<eos> I can take it.<eos> But we gotta talk about it because that's what you do in a family.<eos> So I'm gonna come here every day and embarrass you in front of your friends until you talk to me.<eos> So you're gonna stalk me?<eos> Well...
Too much butter will kill you.<eos> The thing I love cannot kill me.<eos> Neither this, nor this and nor this.<eos> So I am come last, huh?<eos> Last but not the least.<eos> Listen"<eos> I want to go to Nanded.<eos> I want you to come with me.<eos> For along drive.<eos> For your RTR?
I did not, but it's in your chart.<eos> You have severe hypothermia and you're in shock.<eos> If you didn't hit feet first, you would have smashed up your insides like hitting concrete.<eos> You got lucky.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Do you have family in the area?<eos> We need to contact them ASAP.<eos> Do you want these...<eos> No, no, no, don't touch. No touching.<eos> Okay.
All seven years, three months, 11 days.<eos> Sorry...<eos> No, no, no, you're okay.<eos> Maybe it would be better if we try to work this backwards.<eos> Let's start with the bridge.<eos> Do you remember how you got there?<eos> I walked, um, for a long time.<eos> Maybe... maybe days from...<eos> I don't know where.<eos> Nowhere.
We have to get started because it's gonna take some time.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Chill.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Strangers on the Train.<eos> You owe me.<eos> They need to be strong and they need to be flexible like you are.<eos> - Why? What for?<eos> - I didn't ask you questions, did I?<eos> No, you were cool.<eos> Midnight, at the abandoned house.
Look, I've got something going tonight, all right?<eos> And with the router, I... I think we're pretty even.<eos> Steve, you punched a kid in the throat.<eos> You didn't tell me that.<eos> Look, I'm at the end of a rope I should've fallen off of a long time ago.<eos> And I need to help someone.<eos> It's a long shot, but you're strong, that's why I chose you.<eos> I chose you, crazy.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Midnight.
I need help.<eos> I need to...<eos> I need help.<eos> I need to cross a border that's hard to define.<eos> Maybe you know what I'm talking about?<eos> Or you don't, but... you feel it.<eos> Because you've felt other borders, like youth and adulthood, maybe.<eos> I can't change your fate... but I can help you meet it.<eos> We begin our journey to the border tonight.<eos> Midnight.
- Mr. Harris?<eos> - Hi, Alfonso.<eos> This is Kevin Harris from the Knightsman Foundation.<eos> It's, uh... it's nice to meet you.<eos> Well, phone meet you.<eos> We're very impressed by you, Alfonso.<eos> Athletics, grades, community involvement.<eos> And your essay about bees.<eos> Phenomenal.<eos> Bees?
We'll make it without you...<eos> By the skin of our teeth, we will.<eos> Well, I can drive down some weekends, and we can go to Carlos' baseball games together.<eos> Baby, you know I can't go to those things in my condition.<eos> If you really feel like you have a condition, you should let me take you to the doctor.<eos> See?<eos> What am I going to do without you worrying about me all the time, huh?<eos> Well, that's what I'm saying.<eos> You know, I'll be close.<eos> Michigan.
You are wide awake.<eos> "Someone will find me."<eos> "Why am I locked in a cage?"<eos> Well... you'll find out soon enough.<eos> Know this: It may be a while before he comes for you.<eos> And as you think about every step that led you here, you'll eventually realize it's no one's fault but your own.<eos> Your thoughts are gonna try to take you down.<eos> Don't let them.<eos> You'll find your freedom.<eos> In sleep.

Uh, more of a shift to wanting to take control of the kind of fuel that I...<eos> Honey, are you okay?<eos> - Burn your mouth?<eos> - No, it's just...<eos> This is so good.<eos> I apologize.<eos> It's so insensitive of me to talk about my... dietary decisions when Prairie...<eos> It's okay.<eos> You wrote the book about the boy?<eos> Jamie.
Why do Russians love beets so much?<eos> Beets survive frost.<eos> Of course.<eos> Something always survives.<eos> When I was a boy, there was a PBS program that I loved.<eos> Hosted by this... this very proper British scientist. And he would go to, uh, some impossible altitude or... some big desert somewhere.<eos> He was always whispering...<eos> "I'm standing here in the remotest part of the world, where nothing should survive."<eos> There was always some creature that was thriving.<eos> No matter how harsh the environment.
Those schmucks will think it's a prank.<eos> No. No, they won't.<eos> I used to work in a call center.<eos> There's actual people there.<eos> I need to tell Mandy I did not run out on the baby.<eos> - No, lunatic!<eos> We need to tell them... - Shh. ...to get the police.<eos> Where? Where are we?<eos> I was out of it. I didn't see.<eos> - Out of it?
Became something else.<eos> I don't know. He just... He never got to hear it.<eos> I just want a fucking cup of coffee... and a cigarette.<eos> Sit on a stoop in the sun... in the mornin' before the city gets loud.<eos> What about you, Homer?<eos> Take my son places I've never been.<eos> See things together for the first time.<eos> Like, uh, the pyramids, or the Northern Lights.<eos> I'd swim.<eos> In a pool or a lake?
You're right.<eos> They die.<eos> There wasn't enough rain. We, um...<eos> We planted them too close together.<eos> Not enough soil.<eos> Yeah, they die.<eos> So we try again.<eos> The second year, there's rain, and we get the spacing right... but these mites come. They eat 'em all up.<eos> Their leaves are like tissue paper. And they can't feel the sun.<eos> But the third year?
Can't carry a tune in a bag.<eos> Still, what do you do with a choir voice?<eos> I mean, career-wise, I mean, we're all about industry here.<eos> Michigan's economy is ranked, what, 13th in the nation now?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> GM, Dow, Whirlpool.<eos> Lot of potential for you there.<eos> Definitely.<eos> But, if I were you, I'd look into politics.<eos> Situation with the demographic now?
Now, come on, Homer.<eos> We're having a nice time, aren't we?<eos> All you have to do is convince her to come up to your room.<eos> Then you can have a nice long sleep with the window open and the ocean breeze blowing through.<eos> I'm gonna call--<eos> Who you gonna call? -The FBI.<eos> -And tell them what, exactly?<eos> That you keep us in a cellar.<eos> Where's that?<eos> A mine.

You told us about being sent away from the person you loved. You told us about the feeling you had... when you realized he wasn't at the Statue of Liberty.<eos> And the feeling of relief when Hap was.<eos> About how, at first, he felt like the father figure you were looking for.<eos> Strong, smart... uncompromised.<eos> And how you followed him into the dark. Into the basement where you would create a new family.<eos> Scott, Rachel, Homer... and even Renata.<eos> And how with that family, you found insight. A way to find the light within the dark.<eos> And... we know we're taking their place.<eos> But, in all of that you never really told us about them.<eos> Them?
No. - Is somebody else here?<eos> - No.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Alfonso. - What?<eos> Alfonso Sosa.<eos> You're one of the boys that she spoke to.<eos> You know her?<eos> Yeah, I know her.<eos> She tell you about the brave Homer?<eos> And... and the mine?
Nope, I ain't going anywhere till I see what that joker was carrying.<eos> Hey, Omaha. Let's go.<eos> It's all I could find.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> I got to touch your arm, okay?<eos> - Oh, you big baby.<eos> - Oh, shut it.<eos> Water.<eos> Hey, you all right?<eos> Huh? You okay?
I wiped your butt when you were little!<eos> What do you think? Look at his nose!<eos> - What's wrong with my nose?<eos> - It's too big!<eos> What's wrong with a big nose? Your's is too small!<eos> A big nostril collects dirt easily.<eos> - Tiny nose can hardly breathe.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> What'd they say?<eos> Noses...

I speak Chinese!<eos> I'll say it clearly this time.<eos> You have two choices.<eos> One, I knock you both out.<eos> Two...<eos> Zhuzi!<eos> Who's on the train?<eos> Put your backs into it!<eos> It won't budge!<eos> Dakui?
What happened to my poem?<eos> Does it look weird to you or is it...?<eos> There's actually a lot of weird instances where the first lady and the president don't even sleep in the same bedroom, which is...<eos> People don't...<eos> Excuse me for one moment.<eos> What the hell?<eos> You cannot just interrupt a class like that.<eos> She needs answers.<eos> Come here.<eos> All right.
You're already like Cher.<eos> I'm gonna choose to take that as a compliment.<eos> This is one of my favorite places.<eos> - It's very intimate.<eos> - Very.<eos> You know, when I was a kid, I, um... I created a very intimate cocktail lounge in my bedroom by putting a bulletin board against the wall and squatting underneath it.<eos> It was called Chez Bird.<eos> I was the headliner.<eos> - Every night.<eos> - Every night.
I was the headliner.<eos> - Every night.<eos> - Every night.<eos> I don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> I'm very nervous right now. I'm sorry.<eos> You have nothing to be nervous about.<eos> Everybody gets nervous.<eos> I get nervous.<eos> - Really?<eos> - In second grade,
I just need to put my leg...<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, no, I'm totally good.<eos> I'm just perfect.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> - No, I like... like that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.
He always leaves out the part about the 1/2 million in cash that went missing.<eos> You're so full of shit.<eos> The story you've been telling all day, I know.<eos> I'll have my things out of the house by tonight.<eos> We know everything their powered clients are doing and going to do.<eos> We know where they are and where they're going.<eos> You ready to change the world?<eos> What are you doing tonight?<eos> I have to go back on patrol.<eos> Okay, sure.
Which wouldn't have happened if we had in place the bill I'm proposing making the use of powers a federal crime punishable by incarceration in a maximum security prison for life.<eos> As we learn more details about the investigation into Retro Girl's death, we will, of course, keep you posted.<eos> How many more Retro Girl tributes are you planning to do, Terry?<eos> The public needs to mourn, Glantz.<eos> No, the public needs to know that shit is about to hit the fan, and the Powers Division isn't going to save them.<eos> Do you have facts, sources to back that up?<eos> - It's stating the obvious.<eos> - Not to me.<eos> You're not exactly the target audience, with all due respect.<eos> All right.
We will reconvene shortly.<eos> You yield to every demand that's made of you.<eos> Are you talking about my laws or your marriage?<eos> Both.<eos> You should have asked.<eos> Marriage should have been my choice.<eos> I said the same thing to my father when I was told to marry Hrothgar.<eos> - You said you loved him.<eos> - I did.<eos> After a time.
It'll be our secret, then.<eos> All brides should smell sweet for their wedding.<eos> But remember... it's our secret.<eos> Sit down.<eos> We'll take what we came for while they're nursing sore heads.<eos> You wanted to talk?<eos> I need a second. To support me.<eos> You're serious?<eos> Call it building bridges.<eos> All right.
For the game.<eos> We need to meet.<eos> Discuss any reasons the marriage shouldn't go ahead.<eos> If we don't fulfil our duties, their union could be void.<eos> - Go away. - The future of the Shieldlands depends upon it.<eos> All right.<eos> Later.<eos> Beowulf!<eos> Let's celebrate.<eos> In the old way!
My name's Clyde.<eos> The man with the lumber is Theo. And this is...<eos> Hollander.<eos> You know each other?<eos> He's a bailiff at the courthouse.<eos> I never would have guessed.<eos> As is the design.<eos> Pardon the ambush, but we have a pressing need for the help y'all have offered.<eos> Can I have some now?<eos> After dinner.
Here, let me do it.<eos> Noah made sure there's one in there for you too.<eos> If you comin' with us.<eos> With Moses, h-how you know when you love him?<eos> Well, you ask him, he'd tell you we fell in love the night we met at a plantation dance.<eos> But it took me a little while longer.<eos> He was always talking about his preaching.<eos> Enough so I'd go see for myself.<eos> Back then, he was all lanky and sweaty.<eos> All over the place.
You really think she seen one of 'em round this way?<eos> You three, go get the rest of the wax paper from the storehouse.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know...<eos> Lie to me again.<eos> I'm sorry, Momma, I didn't mean nothing...<eos> We gonna get to the why, believe you me.<eos> But right now, I got to figure a way to fix your mess.<eos> Do you know where the governor's office is?<eos> Just upstairs on the left.
- "Home"?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I'm calling from a mobile I found.<eos> I didn't know the owner's name, so I checked the contacts<eos> And found one called "Home", so I called you.<eos> - You have my phone?<eos> - Looks that way.<eos> Thank you! That's great.<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> On the terrace at the Garibaldi.
- What's in it for me?<eos> - A telephone!<eos> But it's my telephone!<eos> But I have it.<eos> You're holding it hostage.<eos> I don't know what to say, because...<eos> I have one principle in life.<eos> - Never have dinner with strangers.<eos> - You're perfectly right.<eos> Especially nowadays.
Yes, you are.<eos> They'll be surprised, maybe even annoyed, but it's not a problem, you'll make another appointment.<eos> And I'll take you on an unforgettable experience.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> It'll change your life.<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> It totally changed my life!<eos> What exactly are you talking about?<eos> - Adrenaline.
- Diane!<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Are you OK? Yes.<eos> I hit my head on the ceiling.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I'll get out of here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's better.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - In Liège.
The Liège Opera, really.<eos> The Liège Opera?<eos> - We're working on an extension.<eos> - Gosh.<eos> It's a big project.<eos> It'll be fabulous.<eos> And how are you?<eos> I'm fine, thank you.<eos> We said we'd call each other... but maybe this is bad timing?<eos> Not at all.
I have a million things to do.<eos> I won't bother you any longer.<eos> Hang on.<eos> What are you doing tonight?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My plane is at five pm.<eos> We could meet at nine if you like?<eos> There's a place I'd like to show you.<eos> It's rather... unusual.<eos> On solid ground?
- It shows.<eos> - Tell me a joke. - Excuse me?<eos> Tell me a joke.<eos> It'll loosen up the atmosphere.<eos> I'm terrible at jokes.<eos> I never tell them right.<eos> I always think about the punchline while I'm telling them, and then I forget the story.<eos> Also, I don't get jokes, because...<eos> - You don't get jokes?<eos> - Never.
Have you been separated for long?<eos> Three years.<eos> - My parents broke up... ten years ago.<eos> - Oh, yes? - But it's cool, they get along great.<eos> - Yes. Yes. It's always better when people manage to separate intelligently,<eos> - instead of fighting like morons.<eos> - Yes. That's for sure.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> What about you? Do you get on well with your ex?<eos> Yes.
I mean, that guy can't even hear.<eos> Can he see?<eos> Is he forgetful?<eos> 'Cause short-term memory, that's the first thing that goes.<eos> Well, he cleans up well.<eos> And, uh, I can't believe this.<eos> You know, I was there when you were born.<eos> What this?<eos> That's orange juice.<eos> Bottled?
We... I just said something. I said, "Coming."<eos> Coming!<eos> If this is about the Policeman's Ball, we have tickets already.<eos> Yeah. Is everything all right?<eos> Yes, everything is fine.<eos> I don't understand your implication.<eos> What are you implying?<eos> It's probably the headlight on my car, it's broken, right?<eos> I know this, so you don't have to come out now.<eos> No, not at 4:30 in the morning.
Good night. Good night.<eos> Thanks for the coffee break, and good luck with your daughter, you know.<eos> We adoptive parents, we're always taking a risk, aren't we?<eos> It's a bit of a crap shoot, but, uh, it's well worth it.<eos> You know, I love mine to death.<eos> Yes, as you can see, I do too.<eos> - Yeah, all right. - And now out.<eos> She looks like someone I know.<eos> Oh, yes, well, it'll come to you, I'm sure...<eos> - With my luck.
I'm the guy that had to earn the money for the family.<eos> I originally I wanted to be Chekhov or Salinger is who I really wanted to be, Salinger. But I had to support everybody so I got a job on Madison Avenue writing commercials.<eos> Oh, yeah, so you could sell people products that they don't really want or need with false claims.<eos> No, never false.<eos> Never, never false claims, you know?<eos> Although I did have to use some ingenuity to persuade people to buy a musical toilet seat.<eos> It's a disgraceful way to make money.<eos> Well, you know, it's not robbing a bank like you do.<eos> You know, I... I... I had a... a... a novel, my first novel was on the best seller list.<eos> In what paper, the poultry man's journal?
Robinson Jeffers, he's one of my favorite poets.<eos> Next time you go down to the city, I'm gonna give you a list of books to read.<eos> You can get some for Kay, too. I know she likes to read.<eos> Yeah, that's a great idea.<eos> She has that book club, so... I don't think they really do political stuff though. It's mostly novels.<eos> Fiction is just fairy tales.<eos> Jeez. How did you get radicalized?<eos> Actually it was a guy that I fell in love with at college.<eos> There were actually two guys I fell in love with at Berkeley.<eos> A Jew and a Black.
You hear what she's saying?<eos> That's how they treat people. That's where they go.<eos> They round up all the nice people.<eos> They confiscate, you know, whatever... their navel oranges, and if they say anything, they shoot 'em.<eos> I don't know why I'm discussing this with you. I should just call the police.<eos> Yeah, I'm surprised you haven't, you little fascist.<eos> You even look like the guy in the movies that always plays the sniveling coward.<eos> Oh, it's his haircut.<eos> Wait. Who am I thinkin' of?<eos> Peter Lorre.
I'm not gonna stand here and be judged by this middlebrow dimwit.<eos> Kay, could I talk to you just for a second? Privately.<eos> My wife and I have no secrets between us.<eos> And you... I don't understand.<eos> You're throwing away a whole career.<eos> Sid, I have to ask you a serious question, all right.<eos> Man to man, off the record.<eos> Do you think I could make a living in Cuba?<eos> Where?<eos> In Cuba.
Man to man, off the record.<eos> Do you think I could make a living in Cuba?<eos> Where?<eos> In Cuba.<eos> I... I hope I didn't hear what I heard.<eos> Oh, I'm serious.<eos> Do you think I could make a living in Cuba?<eos> As what?<eos> A leader of a mariachi band?<eos> What about Algeria?
Trainees Wyatt and Chang.<eos> Where's my driver?<eos> You leave your sense of humor in bed?<eos> Shut up and drive.<eos> _<eos> I have no new intelligence on Samar Hashmi or Haifaa Said.<eos> I try, but nothing.<eos> _<eos> Parrish and Perales.<eos> After you.
You have to prove that your suspect is guilty to get the justice that the victim and their family deserve.<eos> The key to building that case is a suspect interview.<eos> These actors are here to play suspects that are very real and very guilty.<eos> You have to work with actors because the criminals they are portraying are free.<eos> Why?<eos> Because the agents on the original cases didn't ask the right questions during their suspect's interview.<eos> So their cases fell apart at trial.<eos> Today in teams, you'll get the chance to conduct suspect interviews and get the conviction that we never got.<eos> If you learn how to do it right, you can avoid our mistakes and get the justice and closure that the victims and their families deserve.<eos> All right?
You still haven't found her.<eos> She's out there somewhere, and you guys are here looking at me. He's right.<eos> This line of questioning is a waste of time.<eos> What?<eos> I don't know what kind of good-cop-bad-cop move you're trying to pull... A murder conviction without a D.B. is almost impossible.<eos> They searched for two years.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You don't just give up looking.<eos> Work on the case in front of you.<eos> Okay?
I got that tech job, and I thought, "Here we go.<eos> I can start again."<eos> But FBI pulled me in.<eos> It wasn't meant to be.<eos> But now out here...<eos> I can finally admit the truth.<eos> There's no such thing as a clean slate.<eos> It just took the blood of 67 people on my hands to teach me that.<eos> Not to mention the 133 before that.<eos> And dozens before that.
Forget control.<eos> This is about justice.<eos> Don't lose sight of that.<eos> We can still get it, Simon... together.<eos> I'm not really dressed for 20-degree weather, and it's even colder where Alex has stopped.<eos> Are you regretting coming along?<eos> No.<eos> It's not like I have a heavy case load.<eos> I might as well be in the basement with Alex.<eos> Yeah, about that...
Ah...<eos> I... I'm surprised. I'm shocked, even, that you like it here.<eos> I gotta tell ya, I have a couple days, and I was planning to just steadily sit in the McDonald's until I felt safe again.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I have tomorrow off.<eos> Let me take you around.<eos> I'm going to make you love Japan.<eos> Wow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, all right.
Hello.<eos> ...and green and really... it's just a wonderful place to grow up.<eos> Okay, well, good peace to you both.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Oh, um... - Thank you.<eos> Okay, no phones, please.<eos> Oh, I wasn't making a call.<eos> I was just gonna send an e-mail.<eos> Okay. It's just that we mentioned this in the e-mails.<eos> In the pamphlet, in the itinerary.
Okay.<eos> Shit.<eos> Really?<eos> Fuck.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Well, thanks for the heads up.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Issue?<eos> That was a courtesy call from an agent friend of mine working with the Eastern District.<eos> Mm. Okay.
Yeah.<eos> - Well, if they have Decker... then they have Axelrod, and we don't.<eos> - We know where this came from.<eos> - It's fucking Spyros.<eos> Yeah, you know, while we're chasing down Birch, that glory hound gets Eastern to look into Decker.<eos> Hold on just a second. Hold on just a second.<eos> - Sir?<eos> Thank you for doing your civic duty.<eos> Feels good, doesn't it?<eos> Okay.
A what?<eos> Stanford.<eos> Oh, the honorary.<eos> Yeah, we made a pretty big gift.<eos> Lara, take a look at chapter ten.<eos> It's a problem.<eos> I'm sure that the kids will have a wonderful time.<eos> Listen, I really do need to run.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Bye.
I could go and try and reason with her.<eos> No, I reasoned with that twat once before.<eos> I have ways to get her attention. I have ways to get her attention.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm in the 8:15 with Steffi.<eos> Um, I don't have you on my list.<eos> I booked online.<eos> There must be some sort of mix up.<eos> Your name didn't make it into the system.<eos> - Okay.
Right.<eos> And much worse than we remembered it?<eos> Precisely. But there were other changes as well, at least from my perspective.<eos> Spearhead, for example.<eos> In my reality, we invaded, confiscated their core, and used it to continue our mission.<eos> That happened. And Dr. Lasky was killed.<eos> What?<eos> I was killed?<eos> Shot to death during the attempt to commandeer Spearhead.<eos> Well, then...
Mr. Cole is no longer part of the mission.<eos> There is no reason to return him.<eos> We will not leave here until James Cole is returned.<eos> You have until dawn.<eos> The Emerson Hotel, Suite 607.<eos> The day he called you and you refused to help.<eos> Why do The Daughters care about the fate of James Cole?<eos> James Cole understands something you all have forgotten.<eos> Our fates are intertwined.<eos> Here and in the past.
- Really?<eos> I thought you were married.<eos> Oh, Nicole.<eos> She's a pain in my butt.<eos> She doesn't understand me.<eos> She doesn't like me.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You know I sleep in the car?<eos> In the driveway.
'Cause we need to employ Roy, okay?<eos> Because if she relies on us, she's gonna die, and she's gonna take us with her.<eos> And I don't feel like going to heaven right now.<eos> You're hired, and we'll see you on Monday. Okay?<eos> It's time to grow up, okay?<eos> You need a real j-o-b, and that spells "job."<eos> You understand?<eos> Hi, I'm Joseph Dunn, vice president of human resources here at Arby's.<eos> You've chosen a great career path.<eos> Welcome to the family.
Why are you wearing that uniform?<eos> Oh, I had to get a day job to pay a gentleman to help my mom take a dump.<eos> - Hmm. - So, uh, that's what that's about.<eos> And, um, you know, I was just driving around, and I wanted to know if you needed a ride or anything.<eos> Um, well...<eos> I have my mom's car, if you want to just, I don't know, take a nice drive or...<eos> Um, well, I have my car here.<eos> It's not a competition.<eos> Just do it, Martha. Just come on.<eos> - Yeah, okay.
Hey, and thanks for the call, Constantine.<eos> You're a good friend.<eos> You never really know what he's doing or why.<eos> I mean, he says he's going to Morocco to check out a seven-star hotel, but then you find out he's really in Hangzhou making a web-portal play.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Pouch needs a minute with you.<eos> Later.<eos> Metallica's playing one North American gig this year.<eos> Tonight.<eos> Quebec.
It opens me up.<eos> I didn't have the board seat when we took the short position.<eos> And I don't have anything to do with the day-to-day at YumTime or their contracts with vendors.<eos> There's no paper that says I do.<eos> So, the only thing you're open to is making some money, which would make a nice change.<eos> Like your wife says, hold the fucking position until I tell you I'm done.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> I guess that meeting's over, huh?<eos> Shotgun!<eos> All right.
Oh, nothing I'm bothering you with.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> When I thought that Cynthia was cheating on me, who'd I turn to?<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> Now, look, dude, I can see it in your face that this isn't some typical speed bump.<eos> Someone's trying to fuck me.<eos> Oh, so it is just like Cynthia.<eos> Yeah, but it's more expensive.<eos> I'm being short squeezed.<eos> Okay.
That's also called progress.<eos> I think I'll stick with the classics.<eos> Elise, we're ready for you.<eos> Yeah, well, here's the problem...<eos> Who gets to decide?<eos> You wouldn't want to miss one.<eos> I'm pretty good at spotting 'em.<eos> Yeah, we'll see.<eos> Hey, let's, um...<eos> Okay.
No, a lot of fucking respect.<eos> Courtesy on Axelrod.<eos> I speak first.<eos> I answer questions first at every presser.<eos> And in the future, if I put you onto a case, you take it ASAP.<eos> Who's the confused dog now?<eos> Tell me about short squeezes.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I want to know.<eos> Specific to Axelrod.
Peace offering.<eos> What are you drinking?<eos> Your best tequila on the rocks, three limes.<eos> On him.<eos> Coming right up.<eos> If it's any consolation, I almost missed Metallica, and I flew in especially for them and my oldest friends.<eos> That's tragic.<eos> Why?<eos> Uh, you don't want to hear about it.<eos> Okay.
This was about me striking at our common enemy, to hurt him where he lives.<eos> I do understand.<eos> You want me to get Axe because he fucked with your side piece and then he beat you.<eos> For both of us!<eos> And I did it because you wouldn't act.<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> It's at $65.<eos> At least let me take a small piece.<eos> Not even a fucking taste.<eos> Okay.
Oh, no, I don't think that...<eos> It's right on the beach.<eos> You can't come to L.A. and not see the ocean. Well, I... the reservation's for two, so...<eos> We'll pull up a chair.<eos> You're coming.<eos> Um, Daniel, I don't mean to intrude.<eos> Uh, no, no.<eos> It'll be fun. Besides, you heard Violet.<eos> If you don't show, she'll throttle me.<eos> All right.

Hello?<eos> Chief Sousa, I'm terribly sorry to interrupt.<eos> - Jarvis?<eos> - Ah, yes. Edwin Jarvis here.<eos> I've received an S.O.S. signal from Miss Carter.<eos> Apparently, she's at the Griffith Observatory, and I fear she may be in some trouble.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> There. Perfect.<eos> Do you have any change?<eos> No, not in this dress.
S-sir.<eos> Welcome to the Arena Club, ladies!<eos> Now don't ever say Howard Stark didn't get completely behind the suffragettes.<eos> You'll find the lounge through here and the pool table on the left.<eos> Anyone gives you any lip, tell them you're with Terry there.<eos> Mr. Stark!<eos> This way to the bar, ladies. No. No, no, no!<eos> You are not allowed in here.<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> Hi, handsome.
I was thinking I'd kill him.<eos> Look, Hunt, you're not our priority.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Tell me about the work you do for Calvin Chadwick and his buddies at the Arena Social Club. Oh.<eos> Is that all?<eos> I need names of members, I need to know what they're up to, and I want to know how Whitney Frost figures into all this.<eos> Club policy says I ain't allowed to socialize with the members or their wives.<eos> You really want to do this the hard way?<eos> Did you get that leg in combat?<eos> Bastogne.
The situation is not ideal, but Miss Carter is very determined.<eos> Oh I-I believe in Peggy, but... so much can go wrong.<eos> I mean, they're... they're going deep behind enemy lines, I mean, basically surrounding themselves so they can get as close as possible to perhaps the most dangerous person alive.<eos> But there will be reinforcements, yes?<eos> Not to my knowledge, no.<eos> Pretty much everything has to go perfectly or else...<eos> I-I'm sure it'll be fine.<eos> Ana!<eos> Do you know where my formal ivory cuff links are?<eos> Top right drawer on the vanity. Ah.
See, that's where your problem lies.<eos> You see this as a curse. I see it as a gift.<eos> - You think this is a gift?<eos> - Yes!<eos> To be at the whim of a force that's trying to destroy me?<eos> Only because you resist it.<eos> If you accept it, then you control it.<eos> Do you hear that? You hear that, don't you?<eos> It's there.<eos> Right now.
Do you hear that? You hear that, don't you?<eos> It's there.<eos> Right now.<eos> And if you listen, it will guide you.<eos> Hello, gorgeous, I got something urgent.<eos> Wait.<eos> Close your eyes. Close your eyes, Dr. Wilkes.<eos> Shut out everything else and just embrace what you hear.<eos> What? What is it?<eos> First things first.
Jason, stop this.<eos> I know how you feel about her. You want her to die for this?<eos> Daniel, don't listen to him.<eos> If I have to choose between her life or mine,<eos> I know what I'm choosing. Don't tell him, Daniel.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Tell me or you will never see her breathe again!<eos> - The SSR. - Daniel, stop!<eos> - Where? ! - No!<eos> Wall safe at the SSR lab.
You're asking me to judge what will happen when something I've never fired miraculously manages to hit something I never knew existed?<eos> I guess this is where we find out.<eos> What about Miss Frost?<eos> She'll have to wait.<eos> We will get her. But first, we need to close the rift before any zero matter gets out.<eos> He doesn't even know if Mr. Stark's gamma cannon will work.<eos> It's my cannon.<eos> You should know you only get one shot.<eos> At what?<eos> At all.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The people that you've gotten involved with are not who they appear to be.<eos> These kinds of movements prey on idealists like you.<eos> You want to make a difference, but they will use you and cast you aside. They will destroy your life without conscience.<eos> You're wondering if you have a choice. You don't.<eos> You work for me now.<eos> ID, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Go ahead, ma'am.<eos> Tomorrow morning at 8:30, please.
- Why the hell not?<eos> - I only had two minutes to build it.<eos> - You said that was enough! Yelling won't make it work, Chief Sousa.<eos> Where'd Agent Carter go?<eos> And what's the target range?<eos> Well, Sousa was a half mile away the rift when he hit it.<eos> Only limitation is it needs a new charge after each use.<eos> That's all right.<eos> I only plan to use it once.<eos> On what?
-Oh, that's... Sol, she doesn't want to talk.<eos> Oh- - OK.<eos> We'll be right there.<eos> No!<eos> We who?<eos> Not me.<eos> Robert's had a heart attack.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Wait, do you think Sol told Robert about, you know, before?<eos> -The candles, the bed sex?
You're very Grace right now.<eos> I mean, there's a lot of Grace going on.<eos> Well, that's better than lurking in the corner.<eos> I mean, somebody's gotta be responsible.<eos> OK, I vote for you.<eos> Go.<eos> Do something.<eos> Be responsible.<eos> -I'm gonna go get us coffee.<eos> -All right.
- I love you, Mama.<eos> - Love you.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Love you, Bud.<eos> What?<eos> It's just I haven't seen you since...<eos> I want to make sure we're...<eos> And on top of everything I can't believe I was so stupid.<eos> That's what you want to process?<eos> Your stupidity?
I need to stop guessing.<eos> I never get it anymore.<eos> It's OK.<eos> Everyone here is family.<eos> Now please, tell me what the test said.<eos> We found some acute blockages in your arteries<eos> -and you're gonna need a bypass.<eos> -A bypass?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Oh, dear.
Grace, I can't even look Robert in the eye.<eos> So look at Sol!<eos> He's the whole reason I don't want to do it.<eos> -I was at his last wedding.<eos> -Yeah. OK. OK.<eos> Think about this.<eos> Maybe, just maybe, by giving this to Robert, you're gonna be making up for some of the wrong you did him.<eos> And maybe... that'll help you get some of your power back.<eos> And it'll help you move forward.<eos> OK.
-No, because you're not gonna die.<eos> And you know why?<eos> Because I am not gonna let you.<eos> You are not getting off the hook that easy, mister.<eos> First, I wasn't allowed to get angry with you 'cause you're gay.<eos> Now I'm not allowed to 'cause you're sick.<eos> And I have 40 years of anger built up.<eos> And it would be really shitty if you died before I get a chance to say everything that I need to say to you.<eos> -OK. OK.<eos> -OK? OK.
That's why they're called jobs.<eos> How's that for cutting a bagel thin, huh?<eos> Pretty good.<eos> What about Arby's? Everyone's happy at Arby's.<eos> Plus, bonus, curly fries.<eos> That's a... That is a good bonus.<eos> Do you love 'em?<eos> I do love 'em.<eos> What do you dip yours in?<eos> Um, ketchup.
Sorry.<eos> Okay, for our first lesson, we'll do a little table top clowning, okay?<eos> Let's do it.<eos> So, you dip your finger in something, you bring it to your nose.<eos> Happens to smell bad.<eos> Get it away from me.<eos> Ah, you accidentally hit your finger and... Mm!<eos> And that's feces at the end of your finger, okay?<eos> All right, give it a try.<eos> All right.
All you need to do is pick them up from school and make sure they get dinner.<eos> You're signing their death warrants - by having him to this.<eos> - Shh! You mean, like, I'd be...<eos> I'd be their dad?<eos> Well, yeah, but more like their uncle.<eos> - Yeah, I could do that.<eos> - Oh, that's great. - Thank you.<eos> - Tell him not to sit on...<eos> When you get here, don't sit on the sofas again.<eos> Okay? Or the loveseat.
She won't have to send them back.<eos> Okay, Vincent... You have to promise me... Not one word.<eos> Not one word. My lips are sealed.<eos> Really?<eos> If there's traffic, there's traffic. Nothing you can do about it.<eos> They'll wait.<eos> They just need a little daylight. It's okay.<eos> No, I can't wait. I have an appointment.<eos> I'll meet you at your place later this afternoon?<eos> Okay.
You in love with her?<eos> Love?<eos> It never crossed my mind, no.<eos> It's just physical.<eos> What are you doing in Paris? I'm... waiting.<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> My... uh... brother died here.<eos> My twin brother, died in Paris.<eos> An accident?
I wasn't... I wasn't considering the jewelery at that point...<eos> I didn't notice.<eos> Unknown: Did you tell the cops about my texts?<eos> Unknown: ANSWER ME.<eos> Unknown: DID YOU TELL THE COPS ABOUT MY TEXTS?<eos> Sorry, if I woke you up.<eos> I was just stress-testing... one of the new security protocols.<eos> Really fucking hard to configure.<eos> So, it's gonna take me a month.<eos> Best case.
Come.<eos> Unknown: Then I'll come.<eos> Unknown: I have spares of your keys.<eos> Unknown: I am in the taxi.<eos> Unknown: I am in front of your building.<eos> Unknown: Come down.<eos> Unknown: Now.<eos> Unknown: I am coming up.<eos> Unknown: I am on the landing.<eos> - You okay?
Our goals will be as they've always been: Fighting for equality,<eos> Fighting against the man, Fighting against corruption.<eos> [pen scraping on paper] Only now, we'll have the means to fight back.<eos> - Yeah, I'm seeing an octopus With a-a little triangle hat, maybe.<eos> - Gee, in case you hadn't noticed, hap,<eos> Your buddy's not here right now. And our appetite for sarcasm isn't quite as bottomless.<eos> - Oh. - Hap. - Hmm?<eos> - You know what makes the world go round: Money and connections.<eos> Howard's put in time all across the u.S.--<eos> Voter outreach, community organizing, lectures.
- He all right. Stopped calling me "faggot."<eos> - Oh. - Then again, he can't talk.<eos> ♪ - Police still have no clues in the brutal murder<eos> - [mumbling lyrics] - There are options.<eos> You can always move to canada.<eos> You can be a conscientious objector.<eos> What you don't want to do is refuse to go.<eos> That's where things get... Difficult.<eos> - What are we talking about?<eos> - Prison.
So, in the meantime, keep your hands off your wife's phone.<eos> Okay, Ryan?<eos> Let's take a break. When we come back, we'll be talking to Lisa, who thinks two beds might be better than one.<eos> Be right back, on Heart Work.<eos> Your next caller is 45. She's from Colorado. She's got two kids.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> - No, I'm good, thanks.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> So, how you doing, Mickey?<eos> - Good, yeah.
The way she looked at him.<eos> He wanted desperately to help her.<eos> And even though she couldn't admit it... she wanted desperately to be saved.<eos> I don't know, it's like they're all mixed up together in my brain... sex, drugs, love, alcohol.<eos> It's hard to figure out where one starts and the other one stops.<eos> I guess they kind of feel the same... don't they?<eos> Love?<eos> Drugs?<eos> Good share, Wes.<eos> All right.
So I was thinking... And?<eos> And I'm Maddie.<eos> You're supposed to say you're an alcoholic.<eos> And I'm Maddie.<eos> So, I was thinking about Springtime Meadows and how it all works here.<eos> - That's great!<eos> - It is.<eos> Anyway, I was thinking how if everyone in the house chipped in so we could hire a service to clean the bathroom once a week.<eos> It would give me lot more time to focus on my recovery and helping the economy by giving someone a job.<eos> Win-win. All right.
Can I see you again?<eos> One telegram from the War Ministry is enough.<eos> Brandt.<eos> What do you know about the Kaiser?<eos> Kaiser Wilhelm II, former Emperor of the Fatherland.<eos> Weak leader.<eos> Poor strategist.<eos> Led us to defeat. Ran away afterwards.<eos> - Exiled in Belgium, sir.<eos> - Holland.
Reichsführer of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, is coming to dinner tomorrow night.<eos> Isn't that marvelous?<eos> I just received a telegram from Berlin.<eos> One can only hope that he has better manners than that oaf, Goering.<eos> It is a pity that his wife is not able to join him, but still...<eos> Oh, we have a million things to do!<eos> He came here a few years back, fat Goering.<eos> You never knew if he was a boy or a girl.<eos> And he came down to lunch in plus fours.<eos> Plus fours!
- Completely.<eos> But I'm a Jewess.<eos> - I'll protect you.<eos> - No! Nobody can.<eos> I will do my duty. Everyone must.<eos> You never stop. You're always there.<eos> Why is he coming, Sigurd? Why?<eos> Not to see my uniforms.<eos> Is it possible?<eos> After all this time?
And Frau Linnenkamp swears it is not the first time.<eos> Your Highness, I am entirely to blame.<eos> That this should come to light on the very day that Herr Himmler is to visit!<eos> God forbid that he should hear of it!<eos> You are dismissed.<eos> Go and pack your effects immediately.<eos> Now, just a moment.<eos> Nobody's going anywhere.<eos> I will speak to the captain and the girl.<eos> In private.
They are decadent people, no fonder of the Jews and Communists than we are.<eos> Now, there I disagree with you.<eos> We face an international conspiracy funded by Jewish capital which has its home in America.<eos> It will have to be defeated sooner or later.<eos> I'm glad to hear you say that. You had 30 years to do something about the Jews. And yet, you just let them get on with it.<eos> We had other priorities.<eos> But you had Jewish friends, didn't you?<eos> I'm sure I read that.<eos> In the last war, the German Jews fought and died for our country<eos> - in their hundreds of thousands.
I must remember that.<eos> You... you won't believe...<eos> I... I just received a message from Britain's Prime Minister.<eos> - The boy, Churchill.<eos> - What?<eos> What message?<eos> Imagine that!<eos> Two offers in one night.<eos> Not bad, huh?<eos> After 20 years.
God damn it, it's hard sometimes.<eos> I... I don't have any power to stop it.<eos> It's good that you're learning this now, Elijah.<eos> There's always gonna be people in your ear.<eos> The key is knowing when to tune it out.<eos> You know that I would never disappoint you on purpose, right?<eos> I know.<eos> So, lighten up, tough guy. It's a party.<eos> I just want to be clear about what our situation is.<eos> What situation?
It's not like you guys were married.<eos> If I did something immoral, I would feel bad.<eos> I... but I don't because we didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I mean, do you feel bad?<eos> Jessa, my sister is missing.<eos> She abandoned her child and appears to be suicidal.<eos> I can't really think about Hannah right now.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why it's so infuriating that she makes it all about her.<eos> Hey, you guys all right?
Obviously, you're a major part of the music.<eos> But for his life, we feel... that it would just be better if you didn't exist for a little while.<eos> Oh, interesting.<eos> Okay, so I think I understand now.<eos> When we're singing and playing and making music, he can talk to me and tell me what I'm doing wrong and pick at me.<eos> That's all cool.<eos> But the minute we stop, I cease to exist.<eos> I become, essentially, a ghost.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Exactly.
Sorry, my friend's just...<eos> Marnie, I gotta go.<eos> Can't do this now.<eos> Okay, okay, Hannah. Just pretend to hang up but leave me on the phone so that I can hear you, and then the first chance you get, tell him you have to pee and then run.<eos> Yes.<eos> You know, I actually have to pee really bad, so wherever you can pull over.<eos> I mean, there's nowhere really to stop around here.<eos> Okay, but I've gotta pee, like, now, so whenever you can pull it over, I will literally pee anywhere.<eos> Right here would actually be great.<eos> - At this exact spot.
You get in my car and you don't trust me?<eos> - I trust you!<eos> - Wow.<eos> I trust you. I trust you.<eos> In fact, you and I trust each other and I am peeing in this bottle because I have to pee, but also to show that you and I do trust each other and we would never do anything to harm one another.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hannah, are you seriously about to pee right now?<eos> Oh, gosh.<eos> Oh, my Lord. Oh, Lord.
- Get that in the teleprompter?<eos> - Yes.<eos> All right, is this another one of your states of the union?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I'm not happy with the way we left things.<eos> I was angry and I felt like you were... embarrassed, even though that's not an emotion you claim to be able to feel.<eos> Well, I'm gonna be embarrassed if I miss this broadcast.<eos> What is it?<eos> Dill, I know you would never admit this to yourself, but don't you want to be with somebody who sees you for you?<eos> - Beyond all of this?
We got to get on the road, because we have a wedding to practice.<eos> Why does it have to be so far away?<eos> Well, because it's beautiful and it's private, and it was your grandmother's favorite place in the whole wide world.<eos> The happy couple will exchange vows, and then the judge will say...<eos> "By the power vested in me,<eos> - blah, blah, blah." - Mm-hmm.<eos> And then I just go ahead and I dip you?<eos> The band will begin the recessional, and the bride and groom will walk back down the aisle.<eos> And then we all head over to the reception... have a nice, stiff drink.<eos> Okay, everybody.
- What?<eos> - Why'd you stop singing?<eos> I forgot the words.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> We're having everyone leave through the front entrance, but we brought your car around back.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Seriously.<eos> When we've got tabloids offering every beggar in town 10k for information, it's best to be careful.<eos> - Better safe than sorry.<eos> - All right.
And we are gonna become a family tomorrow, damn it, and nothing's gonna stop us.<eos> And it looks like wedding bells are ringing today for Rayna Jaymes.<eos> She and her longtime love, Deacon Claybourne, have made no public announcement, but pair are rumored to be holding the event at a property once owned by the bride's mother.<eos> And the pressure may be taking its toll on the couple, after a scuffle with the paparazzi last night outside a restaurant in Nashville.<eos> Dad!<eos> I guess I just poured gasoline on all this.<eos> No, honey, you didn't.<eos> It was already on fire.<eos> I mean, you were just trying to protect us right there.<eos> Okay.
"Shenandoah Girl" might be headed to the stage.<eos> Wow.<eos> What about Luke's tour?<eos> Is she not gonna go back out on the road at all, or...?<eos> Maybe. Maybe.<eos> Hasn't ruled it out yet.<eos> Well, give her my best, all right?<eos> - I will.<eos> - See you around, man.<eos> All right.
Love you.<eos> Oh. The groom's room is down to the right.<eos> Layla.<eos> Hey.<eos> When'd you get back in town?<eos> I don't know if I am officially, but I wasn't gonna miss Rayna's wedding after everything she's done for me.<eos> Oh, well, she's been worried about you.<eos> We both have.<eos> So, how you holding up?<eos> Okay.
Okay.<eos> At least I've stopped blaming myself for not making Jeff leave that night.<eos> 'Cause then it never would have happened.<eos> But it was a freak accident.<eos> I know it wasn't my fault now.<eos> It wasn't anybody's, really.<eos> Well, I know it probably doesn't feel this way right now, but things will get better.<eos> Hi.<eos> Um, I'm looking for Maddie Conrad.<eos> Okay.
Actually, this week, it's been more like machinery maintenance, stuff like that.<eos> But, um, yeah, my grandad's actually pretty hard-core with the whole work-ethic thing.<eos> That's kind of a drag.<eos> I actually kind of like it, having the structure.<eos> Crap, I got to go.<eos> - I'm sorry. - Hey.<eos> Already?<eos> Yeah, it's a long drive home, and my grandad said I have curfew at 11:00.<eos> When am I gonna see you again?<eos> - What about, like, next weekend?
Yeah, it's a long drive home, and my grandad said I have curfew at 11:00.<eos> When am I gonna see you again?<eos> - What about, like, next weekend?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean, later in the day, after my chores, though.<eos> - ♪ Make you my own ♪ - Cool.<eos> Hey, I'll text you when I get back.<eos> All right.<eos> Drive safe.<eos> Bye.
The way your voices sound together, the harmonies... I mean, it's really spectacular.<eos> Well, we just want to say thank you for letting us make the album we wanted to make.<eos> It'll be tough to narrow it down to just one single.<eos> I agree with you, and yet, my money's on the last one.<eos> I know it's not the conventional choice, but it's just so textured and rich and... and... and exciting.<eos> I-I think that's the way to launch the record.<eos> What do you guys think?<eos> Um, whatever you guys think is best. Uh...<eos> Yeah. Uh, w-whatever's best.<eos> All right.
Well, it's too early to talk release date since they're launching Layla's record first.<eos> But we do need to finalize writing credits and licenses... which I better call and confirm.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Are you sure you're all right with this?<eos> With my song being the single?<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> That was the consensus, wasn't it?<eos> Well, because technically it's my song since I wrote it and it's mostly my vocal, and I just don't think it's fair...<eos> Scarlett, it's all about what's best for the band, so it's got to be the song that tells the best story.<eos> Okay?
Um, that's right.<eos> But Colt's only in town for one more day.<eos> Do you think we could reschedule?<eos> Sure. No problem.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> - Bye. Guys, I am so sorry, but I've got to get Maddie home.<eos> I promised her parents.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right.

Yeah.<eos> Guess I-I was afraid to admit that I needed help.<eos> So, you want me to go ahead and make the announcement?<eos> What I want is to do this with you.<eos> But I guess what I need is practice.<eos> You, uh... think your band can get my ass into gear by tonight?<eos> Thank you for meeting with me again.<eos> It's an encouraging sign.<eos> Yeah, well, I wanted to talk music.<eos> Music or... music business?

I should have listened to you, and I didn't, and for that, I'm sorry.<eos> And I should have asked before I gave Riff your slot tonight.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - No, I should've.<eos> You're my partner, Frankie.<eos> I couldn't do this without you.<eos> Hell, I wouldn't want to.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> All right, so, what do you say we put all this behind us, look forward to tonight when we make our place the place to be in Nashville?<eos> All right.
I hate this whole setup.<eos> Layla, I'm not sure why you're acting this way, but I'm gonna speak candidly, okay?<eos> I think you are incredibly talented.<eos> That's why I'm working with you.<eos> But I have been down this road with Juliette in terms of the bad behavior, and I'm not interested in doing that.<eos> So let's find out what you're actually worried about, and we can nip this attitude thing right in the bud.<eos> - Or I can just wrap it up right... - Look, I just... I thought that Avery and I were friends, so I called him earlier, inviting him to the Riff Bell thing at The Beverly tonight, and he just... he already had plans.<eos> And that's a problem?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay.
Maybe he's just a little lost.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> You're still up. Hey.<eos> Honey, I'm so sorry I couldn't get there tonight.<eos> Oh, come on, now.<eos> The girls needed you here.<eos> I'm glad you stayed home.<eos> And there will be plenty of nights at The Beverly.<eos> Especially after tonight's show.
- without a band or a hat.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah, of course, I was in the middle of nowhere and nobody knew who I was, but, uh, it felt pretty good doing it.<eos> As long as it feels good, that's great.<eos> I might be ready to try something like that around town, you know, like a little, uh, acoustic gig here or there.<eos> We're playing the Nashville palace tonight.<eos> You want to sit in for a couple of songs in the middle of the set?<eos> Uh, uh, really?<eos> I mean, management wouldn't have a problem with that?<eos> Yeah, all right.
Yeah.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I've been waiting for an hour, and I need to drive back to Nashville for a job I have tonight.<eos> - How much longer?<eos> - Mr. Barkley?<eos> Nice to see you again.<eos> Dr. Kitley.<eos> Hi. So, uh, is there a visiting area, or does Juliette just want to talk in her room?<eos> Actually... She's in a fairly delicate emotional state at the moment and doesn't feel that now is a safe time to be engaging with you.<eos> Okay.
She was your original tour mate, and people are talking Oscars.<eos> She's bigger than she's ever been.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, at this point, um, maybe she's our best bet.<eos> We're gonna bring a very special guest up on stage tonight to share a few songs.<eos> Please put your hands together for our friend, Mr. Will Lexington!<eos> How you'll doing?<eos> Well, like the Xs, I've been doing a lot of traveling myself.<eos> Where'd you go, sweetheart?<eos> 'Frisco?
Last time I saw that boy, he was teaching Colt how to fry ants with a magnifying glass.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, listen, man, uh...<eos> I'm sorry to hear about all the heat you've been taking lately.<eos> It ain't right what they're saying.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Hey, uh, why don't you come over to the house for a barbecue?<eos> Heidi and the kids, they'd sure love to see you.<eos> I'd really like that.<eos> All right.
I'm sorry to hear about all the heat you've been taking lately.<eos> It ain't right what they're saying.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Hey, uh, why don't you come over to the house for a barbecue?<eos> Heidi and the kids, they'd sure love to see you.<eos> I'd really like that.<eos> All right.<eos> Scarlett's asking about you.<eos> Wants to know how bad the bruising is.<eos> On my nose or my ego?
Look, I-I know Rayna pulled some strings to get me this job.<eos> And I just want you all to know that I'll work my butt off here.<eos> Well, that's all we ask.<eos> And, I mean, the best part is, is now my day job and my dream job are in the same place.<eos> I mean, if I could play the occasional open mike...<eos> Not if you're scheduled to work.<eos> Standard application.<eos> Nothing special.<eos> We'll give you a minute to fill it out.<eos> All right.
Let me show you something I found today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We agreed to background checks on all employees.<eos> Yeah, one that neither of us could pass.<eos> All right, come on now.<eos> I know you got more than one D.U.I. on that record of yours.<eos> And me?<eos> You're a damn disaster on paper.<eos> It's what I'm saying.<eos> All right.
Right now all we can do is just hope and pray that she's okay.<eos> On a brighter note... as you have seen, that Riff Bell show put this place on the map quick.<eos> Seems like everybody wants to play here now, which means this place is gonna be packed again, so I want to make sure everybody's...<eos> Hold on one second, guys.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I just came to grab my dad's sport coat.<eos> I thought I saw it in his office.<eos> Oh, all right.
I'm sure it just slipped his mind.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's Vita.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> Hey, Vita.<eos> It's Rayna... again.<eos> Um... please call me.<eos> Let me know you're okay.<eos> Just reach out to me.<eos> All right. Bye.
And now that I'm home, I was wondering if I could spend more time with her.<eos> I'm sorry, but the answer is no.<eos> Avery, I know that I've caused you so much pain, and I've let you down and I let her down, and I regret it every day.<eos> But I have done so much to overcome my addictions and my postpartum, and I'm so much better.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Look, I'm happy to hear that.<eos> I really am.<eos> But that all took place in a protected environment, and here you are, the first day out.<eos> I can't trust it.<eos> Okay.
Nope.<eos> Then what is it, Frankie?<eos> You know, is it the Vita thing or what?<eos> 'Cause I couldn't help but thinking that some of that stuff you were talking about today in that meeting was directed at me.<eos> Not everything's about you, Deacon.<eos> All right.<eos> So, what time is this opening slot I've been given to play?<eos> You go on at 8:00.<eos> Guess I'll see you at showtime.<eos> All right.
Let's see what we got.<eos> Juliette. Well, you can take it if you want.<eos> I don't want to, but I probably should.<eos> I'll just be a minute.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey.<eos> Thanks for answering.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm, uh, sort of the middle of something.<eos> Okay.
That fear is something I'll never forget.<eos> Yeah, well, Granddad said you were on a VIP convoy.<eos> Exactly... whereas you could be out on the front lines.<eos> You need to understand something, son.<eos> I'm not fighting you 'cause I'm trying to control you.<eos> I-I'm doing it 'cause I'm terrified.<eos> I know you might hate my guts right now, but I love you so much, and I don't want you to get hurt.<eos> I might not know what to expect but I know I found something I believe in.<eos> Just 'cause it's gonna be scary doesn't mean I'm not gonna do it.<eos> All right.
Well, thanks again for being so understanding about all this.<eos> Of course.<eos> And you break a leg tonight.<eos> - So, please just call me back...<eos> - Will you call me if you hear from her?<eos> - ...as soon as you get this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> I really appreciate that.<eos> Okay, bye.
I want to do everything, but I kind of made plans with Autumn.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She called my room and asked me to come to the hotel spa, and I really feel like we got off on the wrong foot, and so I'm trying to make it cool.<eos> Do you mind if I spend a little time alone with her?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, that's... that's fine.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - After the show?
- Oh, really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She called my room and asked me to come to the hotel spa, and I really feel like we got off on the wrong foot, and so I'm trying to make it cool.<eos> Do you mind if I spend a little time alone with her?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, that's... that's fine.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - After the show?<eos> - After the show.

Hi, Avery.<eos> I just heard you were joining the tour.<eos> - Welcome aboard, son.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Yeah, it was kind of last minute, but I'm looking forward to it.<eos> Well, uh, that makes three of us.<eos> Um, you mind if I steal Layla here for a quick second?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Yeah, I'll go plug in.<eos> - Okay.
If I didn't say anything, you wouldn't have known about the show,<eos> - sh... she wouldn't have run away.<eos> - No. No.<eos> Listen to m...<eos> Daphne, hey, hey, all right?<eos> Maddie made her choices, and that is not your responsibility.<eos> You did exactly what you should've done, all right?<eos> What if something bad happens?<eos> It won't.<eos> All right?
Great.<eos> That's real, real helpful.<eos> The only other option is we get the police involved.<eos> Then, why don't we do that?<eos> Because as soon as the police are involved, we got to file a report, and then she's in the system as a runaway.<eos> Well, she is a runaway, Rayna.<eos> But, hon, the minute that she's in the system, suddenly anybody can get ahold of that. I mean, that's public knowledge.<eos> That can be dragged through the tabloids.<eos> - I don't want that for her.<eos> - All right, great.
You guys should hang out one-on-one sometime.<eos> I think you'd like her.<eos> Hey, uh, I just wanted to say thanks for letting me sing on your record.<eos> - I got a good feeling about it. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> All right. I'll see you around.<eos> Uh, do you feel like grabbing a beer or something?<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah, I'd love to.<eos> Well, all right.
Will, I... I'm not gay.<eos> Wait... what?<eos> What about all that nice stuff you said to me and then... and the breakup with Riley?<eos> Riley was my bandmate.<eos> We broke up 'cause we couldn't agree on a sound.<eos> I guess I'm worse at this than I thought.<eos> Listen, my cousin's gay.<eos> If you want, I could,<eos> - you know, give him your... No, I just... think I'll stick to the music for now.<eos> All right.
Well, maybe we could get some shots at the benefit tomorrow?<eos> Well, let's... play it by ear.<eos> You guys done in here?<eos> You have what you need?<eos> - Yeah, we're good.<eos> - Okay, great.<eos> Now, let's... let's head to the kitchen.<eos> Follow me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right.
You guys done in here?<eos> You have what you need?<eos> - Yeah, we're good.<eos> - Okay, great.<eos> Now, let's... let's head to the kitchen.<eos> Follow me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> The kitchen's really the heart of this home, and I've been lucky enough to enjoy a lot of<eos> - great family dinners here.
- She's the daughter of... Deacon's business partner.<eos> Oh. So he brought her into this.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Look, there's no way we could've known that she was gonna be like this.<eos> And, anyway, that's only part of the problem.<eos> Maddie also found out about... that crazy Edgehill deal you made.<eos> How much does she know about it?<eos> Just that there was one<eos> - and that I kept her from taking it.<eos> - Okay.
Ooh, look.<eos> Cadence, look at that.<eos> That is a treasure chest.<eos> What does she think's inside?<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was just on my way to rehearsal, and I thought I'd sneak a "hello"<eos> - with my baby girl.<eos> - No, I mean, what are you doing here...<eos> - on this tour?
Uh, no.<eos> I'll let you know as soon as I do, though.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I have some ideas<eos> - for my album launch party...<eos> - Yeah, and I-I want to hear them...<eos> I do, but... Juliette needs me at rehearsal, so I got to go.<eos> I'll call you as soon as I'm done, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right.
- All right, all right. Scarlett, stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> I did not sleep with Autumn, all right?<eos> - Yeah, she made a play for me.<eos> - Sure.<eos> She invited me to go off with her and hang out with James Taylor.<eos> You love James Taylor.<eos> I know.<eos> But I turned her down.<eos> All right?
- Oh, sweetheart, you don't care about her at all. You care about yourself.<eos> And let me tell you one thing...<eos> Nashville is such a small town.<eos> If you keep going down this road, I guarantee you I will make sure that no one...<eos> from Music Row to Lower Broad... ever works with you again.<eos> You threatening me?<eos> Promising.<eos> So, out of nowhere, Deacon just storms in, starts threatening this drunk guy,<eos> - and pulls me offstage.<eos> - At a club, okay?
- Hey, Mike. Thank you for your help. - Hey, Deacon.<eos> You mind grabbing this stuff for me?<eos> There's some lights here for you.<eos> All right, thank you, guys.<eos> Hey, Paul, I'm gonna take that one, actually.<eos> That's my daughter's.<eos> - Okay. Yeah,<eos> - I appreciate it.<eos> - Daphne's up getting ready.<eos> - Okay.
- Okay. Yeah,<eos> - I appreciate it.<eos> - Daphne's up getting ready.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You got to see Maddie, talk with her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> You think she's gonna come?<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - All right, well,
Um, something's come up.<eos> I think I have a lead on a tour.<eos> But I'll call you later?<eos> Cool.<eos> Let me know how it goes.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> I thought you weren't coming by for cadence until later.<eos> I found her pacifier in the car, And I knew that she would want it, so...<eos> Ah, okay.
¶ yooooooou ¶<eos> ¶ oooh ¶ ¶ I had always been the outlaw, riding into the sun ¶<eos> I'm gonna head out.<eos> ¶ never stopped to think about all the damage done ¶<eos> ¶ no, I'm no calamity jane ¶<eos> ¶ no, I ain't that tough ¶<eos> ¶ I knew love had a price, but I didn't realize how much ¶<eos> Hey, gang.<eos> It's time to travel.<eos> Bucky:
No judge is gonna rule in favor of a 16-year-old runaway.<eos> I can't believe we have to go through all this.<eos> I know.<eos> We're gonna get through it together.<eos> So, nervous?<eos> It was my first acting gig.<eos> I highly doubt I'm gonna get nominated for an Oscar.<eos> You never know.<eos> Hey, did Avery say anything to you last night when he dropped Cadence off?<eos> About the Oscars?

- Um, uh, the lobby.<eos> - Lobby.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let me give you a hand.<eos> - I got you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So, are we gonna talk about what happened?<eos> Was it just the scotch?<eos> No, it wasn't just the scotch.<eos> Finally.
She is trying to steal my life!<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> Is everything okay with Juliette?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She, uh, just called to tell me that she got an Oscar nomination.<eos> Good for her.<eos> Listen...<eos> Last night was great, but, um, I have to go pick up Cadence now.<eos> Okay.
And is this sentiment shared by your ex-husband and Maddie's father, Teddy Conrad?<eos> Yes, it is, and I have an affidavit signed by him stating as much.<eos> We both feel very strongly that Maddie needs to be at home with her family, and we have major concerns about her living situation right now.<eos> This young woman that she's staying with has already exercised very poor judgment in regards to Maddie.<eos> Rayna and Deacon brought me in.<eos> Both of them told me how great I was for their daughter as a songwriting partner and as a role model.<eos> Now as Maddie's friend, I am trying to help her get out from underneath her parents, who are truly trying to keep her down.<eos> I honestly don't feel as though they have her best interests at heart.<eos> There's just no way in the world that Cash can care more about my daughter's future than I do.<eos> And in my opinion,
Your ex-boyfriend and your best friend getting together.<eos> Uh, I mean, not... not really.<eos> - I didn't know about it for a while, so... - Oh.<eos> So they kept it from you.<eos> No, we... we wanted to be sensitive to Scarlett's feelings.<eos> I think it's just a chapter we saw different.<eos> - That's all.<eos> - Time to travel.<eos> Soundcheck awaits.<eos> Okay.
We should probably go get ready for the show.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Really sorry.<eos> I'll see you after.<eos> Yep.<eos> Break a leg out there, you two.<eos> Babe.<eos> Hey, babe, are you coming up?<eos> All right!
Don't do that."<eos> You listened to everything that they said in that court and you went there anyway.<eos> Just once in your life, you could've held back.<eos> I'm sorry, baby.<eos> Yeah, so we changed your settlements like you wanted...<eos> Hey, I'll see you guys in there.<eos> Hey, can I have a minute?<eos> Uh, I-I'll catch up with you later.<eos> I just have one question.<eos> Okay.
- ♪ 'Cause no one cares to warn ya ♪ - Nothing.<eos> - ♪ And the diamonds turn back to coal ♪ - You want to get out of here?<eos> Sure.<eos> A culture war is brewing in country music after superstar Luke Wheeler and conservative pundit Cynthia Davis butted heads on her show earlier today.<eos> That's right.<eos> Davis had accused Wheeler of, quote,<eos> "pushing a homosexual agenda"<eos> after he turned over his slot on "Good Morning America" yesterday to Will Lexington, a gay artist on his record label, and encouraged viewers to call radio stations and demand airplay for him.<eos> While Wheeler appeared on Davis' show, there has been no public comment from Lexington himself.<eos> You okay?
Hey, you know what, son?<eos> I should go.<eos> I got somebody in my office.<eos> I'll call you back, okay?<eos> All right, Dad.<eos> Talk soon.<eos> I've been in media training for two weeks.<eos> I got my talking points.<eos> You want to tell me what we're discussing?<eos> This.
He's dead.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> Pay her whatever she wants.<eos> Just do it.<eos> - Juliette.<eos> - Or you're fired.<eos> Okay.<eos> But just to cover our bases, we'll ask for a public retraction.<eos> "In her grief, Ms. Fordham was desperate to place blame, but has since learned that her brother was solely responsible for his own death."<eos> Okay.
But just to cover our bases, we'll ask for a public retraction.<eos> "In her grief, Ms. Fordham was desperate to place blame, but has since learned that her brother was solely responsible for his own death."<eos> Okay.<eos> So... now you can go to the Oscars and not have to worry about anything but winning.<eos> Wow.<eos> This place is amazing.<eos> Of course it is, though.<eos> It's Vince Pierce's place.<eos> I have to post this.<eos> Okay.
You talking about Rayna?<eos> Hell no.<eos> Actually, I was, uh, talking about my ex-wife.<eos> Okay, I think we've all heard enough.<eos> Can you shut them up, please?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Trey Edwards... producer, "Cynthia Davis Live."<eos> She's agreed to have you on.<eos> Well, all right!
It's just, I want you to know that I'm committed as ever to launching your album.<eos> Only... I can't do it without you.<eos> Okay? I've got some appearances lined up, and I'm gonna need you out there with me.<eos> - Yeah, I understand.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> I'll be back in Nashville in a few hours and, uh, have a radio interview lined up for us later today, so why don't you meet me back at the office and, uh, we can discuss then, okay?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I just wanted to clarify what I meant in L.A. when I said, "I'd love to see where this goes."<eos> Okay.
She woke up screaming twice last night.<eos> Oh. I'm sorry.<eos> You cooking?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, sort of.<eos> Noah is here, and he wanted to cook, so...<eos> Noah...<eos> West is here?<eos> Really?<eos> Wow.
For you, we were thinking "Joy."<eos> Would you stop, please?<eos> Don't listen to him.<eos> Scarlett, this is Jackie Hudson, our esteemed photographer.<eos> - That's right, and I don't need you to tell her what she should feel.<eos> I'm sure you can figure that out on your own.<eos> - Can't you?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Just listen to the music, be honest, and we'll see where that takes us.<eos> All right?

You know the first time I played here, she blew me off?<eos> And then she literally let Markus Keen just steal my spotlight at my Opry debut.<eos> And then she did nothing when Autumn gave my tour spot away to the Exes.<eos> So, I mean, what does it matter how tonight went when my label obviously couldn't care less about me?<eos> Of course Highway 65 cares about you.<eos> I mean, look. Look at this.<eos> Yeah, but I just feel like crying.<eos> It's just, tonight was supposed to be perfect, and Rayna just ruined it.<eos> It's not ruined.<eos> Okay?
Maddie's only been emancipated for a week.<eos> Who's coming?<eos> Not too many, but she managed to get a couple from New York, one from L.A., Warner Bros., I think one or two more.<eos> But what really has me concerned is I think Lennox Hill is coming.<eos> - Lennox Hill?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And from what I hear around town, they are determined to get her.<eos> Will you do me a favor, Bucky?<eos> Will you please call travel and have them have a jet ready for us tomorrow morning?<eos> 8:00 a.m.
I understand if you don't want to get your hands dirty.<eos> How about if you help us clean up the political landscape, you know, in secret?<eos> All tips will be anonymous.<eos> You have my word.<eos> What kind of arrangement are we talking about?<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> I help you. You help me.<eos> I have a D.U.I. I need taken care of.<eos> FBI can handle that, right?<eos> All right.
The test wasn't "Can you turn me?"<eos> It was "Can I turn you?"<eos> I failed, too. What?<eos> Which is even worse than your fellow NATs that came up empty.<eos> Whenever you are approaching someone, they are approaching you, reading you, searching you for a weakness to exploit.<eos> They can use money, sex, ego, the dignity of a cause... whatever it takes, to turn you on their side, because the information that you have in your head is always more valuable than what is in theirs.<eos> Never forget... a bad approach costs us nothing.<eos> A bad agent costs us everything.<eos> You want to tell me what's going on?<eos> - About what?
You can leave in the morning and return to the Academy and resume your training once you've sorted everything out.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.<eos> Get your daughter back.<eos> Hey, have a minute?<eos> No, no, no. Uh, uh, leave the door open.<eos> Um, I found these in the dorm, and I wanted to get them back to Ryan.<eos> I know he's probably still undercover, so I was wondering if you had his home address in Chicago.<eos> Once we left the post there, we left the city for good. Oh.<eos> When was that exactly?<eos> Last fall.
All those years I was trying to find a little bit of peace, and who would have knowed it was right here just down the road? Do I miss Sunnyvale?<eos> (Chuckling) Not on your life, bud.<eos> Not Ricky and fuckery!
Pound a taquito, dawg, and relax.<eos> Take your time.<eos> And get at me when you want to spit, hah? Lucy:<eos> (Laughing) Ricky: I'm sorry, Luce.<eos> I-I just can't right now.<eos> Well, is it the neck brace?<eos> I can take it off.<eos> No, you look hot as fuck. It's just...<eos> I need to talk to you about something.<eos> Okay, what?
I say we get it.<eos> Box it up, patch it up, whatever the fuck you do with that stuff.<eos> Let's go, please, right now!<eos> You mean this one?<eos> You know it's $2,800?<eos> 2,800 fucking dollars?<eos> We just looked at the used one down the street. It was 75 bucks!<eos> It does the same fucking thing!<eos> That one had a big old sex stain on the front of it though, man.<eos> Trinity:
I mean, obviously I can't do that, for fuck's sakes!<eos> Ricky would lose his goddamn mind.<eos> Ricky would be pretty pissed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's fucked.<eos> All right.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I just keep thinking that's a lot of money and that would really help things out with the wedding and...<eos> Are those guys still broken up?<eos> All right, okay.
Sorry, Bubbs.<eos> Here... let me fix that for you.<eos> I guess you really fucked this up, didn't you?<eos> Who are you supposed to be with this on your head, anyway?<eos> Super Bling Cowboy.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Super Bling Cowboy.<eos> I'm like a cowboy, but I'm... gangsta rapper.<eos> You know... hybrid.<eos> All right.
(Cheering) Woman:<eos> Ricky:<eos> (Giggling) What the fuck is going on over at Julian's?<eos> What are you guys doing? Drinking?<eos> Yeah, you know what? Sorry.<eos> I think I should leave you guys alone.<eos> Don't want to be here for this.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> Okay, Rick, we need to have a talk. Uh, but first I want you to drink this.<eos> Oh, thanks, Luce.
That's all right, though.<eos> I'll see if I can play this thing. I'm pretty good on 'er.<eos> All right, so I'm going to start off here with a little track by Willie Nelson.<eos> Excuse me, uh... (Whispering)<eos> (Indistinct whispers)<eos> Okay, apparently, uh, it's only original music allowed in the contest.<eos> I was unaware of that. So I'm going to see what I can...<eos> Oh, excuse me, also, well, we have...<eos> There's, uh, a special on hot chicken and hot turkey sandwiches all afternoon! Whoo!<eos> All right then.
This is amazing!<eos> Hey, Snoop.<eos> That joint, is that just weed in that?<eos> 'Cause my legs are like jello.<eos> How do you function with this stuff?<eos> Lot of practice, baby.<eos> Come on, I'll show you.<eos> Oh, my God, I don't...<eos> We're just getting started, Bubbs.<eos> All right. J-Roc:
A bitch that look like John Denver.<eos> Okay, you clownin', hah?<eos> 'Cause what else would you be doin' up in this mafker righ hurr if it wasn't for me?<eos> Know what I'm sayin'?<eos> Straight up, legend to legend, dawg.<eos> Hey man, who the fuck is this liquid paper- coloured motherfucker?<eos> Snoop, this is J-Roc.<eos> He's also a rapper.<eos> Actin' like you don't know. That's how we doin' thangs?<eos> N'aight then, n'aight.
Then it starts raining horse cocks and I mean, normally I'd pack it in 'cause, you know, it gets dangerous, you could get blasted with lightning.<eos> But he was a trooper.<eos> He wanted to stay out and the next thing you know, he throws out the claw and he gets a fucking 2100 series. Perfect condition.<eos> He's a fucking natural.<eos> This is a perfect day!<eos> Look at the weather, it's perfectly shitty!<eos> It's exactly like I dreamed it!<eos> Come on, load it up! Load it up!<eos> Yeah, load 'er up.<eos> All right!
Says if I don't have $1,000 cash, can't get back in the fucking trailer.<eos> So you'd better find it right the fuck now!<eos> Rick...<eos> Don't fucking "Ricky" me!<eos> You guys promised me! Even you, Bubbles!<eos> And you fucked me! Listen, Rick. Snoop and Doug are up there gambling right now.<eos> They've got wads of cash on the table.<eos> You're going to get your fucking money tonight, man. I promise you.<eos> See, Ricky?<eos> All right.
Seriously?<eos> Seriously. I'm having a great time!<eos> I should be a part of the wedding!<eos> You are a good fucking guy.<eos> Oh, thanks, buddy.<eos> That means a lot.<eos> Not like you two dicks! Okay...<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I don't even know... Oh, you bet.<eos> Okay...
Lighters?<eos> - They're crap. - What?<eos> They run out too quick.<eos> These are the best. What d'you mean, crap?<eos> Bics are shit next to these.<eos> Crickets are the future!<eos> They don't even have these in China yet.<eos> Maimouna, pack up!<eos> Get a move on.<eos> The bell's rung.
I'm being polite!<eos> Stop now.<eos> You're role-playing. It isn't real.<eos> We know it isn't real.<eos> - Sit down. - Sit down, Jisca.<eos> Dounia, you take her place.<eos> Go on.<eos> So...<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Well, already...
- Sit down. - Sit down, Jisca.<eos> Dounia, you take her place.<eos> Go on.<eos> So...<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Well, already...<eos> You've forgotten the first thing.<eos> Unforgivable!<eos> You've forgotten the smile.<eos> The first thing!
One hundred Euros...<eos> One hundred for energy, twenty for Internet...<eos> Your package holidays in Turkey...<eos> Get out of here! Get out!<eos> - When she gets to class... she's like this!<eos> Skint!<eos> I don't wanna beg. I've got my pride!<eos> Get out of my fucking class!<eos> I swear on my mother's life I'll make more cash than you've ever dreamed of!<eos> In your entire life!

Insha'Allah.<eos> He could tell my dad everything.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We're dust in the cosmos. To him, we're microbes.<eos> But when you're God, you have to watch over your children. It's written.<eos> Yeah, but he hasn't acknowledged us.<eos> Yes, he has.<eos> He talks to me all the time.<eos> When?<eos> In my dreams.
No doubt you will think only of the merger.<eos> That unclean melding of two equally diseased institutions.<eos> But the truth cannot be ignored.<eos> For only when we know what ails us can we hope to find the cure.<eos> I will not return.<eos> Do not attempt to contact me again.<eos> Sincerely, Roland E. Pembroke.<eos> Well, Mr. Lockhart... what do you make of that?<eos> Clearly, he's lost his mind.<eos> Our thoughts exactly.
He was weak.<eos> You didn't know him.<eos> And whose fault is that?<eos> So, are you happy here?<eos> Are they taking good care of you?<eos> People come here to die.<eos> Why would I be happy?<eos> I'm getting a promotion.<eos> So, when I get back I'll be able to move you to somewhere better.<eos> Somewhere near the beach or something.
Well enough.<eos> I suppose that's wonderful news.<eos> Isn't that right, Mr. Nair?<eos> Wonderful news.<eos> Mrs. Watkins... time for your treatment.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Lockhart.<eos> Safe travels.<eos> Something in the water?<eos> At the bottom.
I am not a fucking patient!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Had enough of cripples and old people? Try it with me!<eos> That's enough! Mr. Lockhart...<eos> I can see you're extremely upset.<eos> Why don't you come with me to my office... and we can discuss whatever's on your mind.<eos> No.<eos> We're gonna talk about it right here.<eos> In front of everybody.
What changed?<eos> Well, it turns out, we had a common enemy.<eos> What happened to them?<eos> - We won.<eos> - Quiet.<eos> Listen.<eos> War drums.<eos> Azgeda.<eos> You can tell it's Ice Nation from the sound?<eos> No, from them.
I don't want mercy.<eos> I want revenge.<eos> I want you to suffer the same way that I've suffered.<eos> You can kill me, Clarke.<eos> You can never escape what you did.<eos> My pain ends today!<eos> Yours has just begun!<eos> Titus, what are you doing in my room?<eos> You spend so much time talking about peace, I think it's time we made peace with each other, don't you?<eos> All right.
I am very well aware of the rules.<eos> And even though I find them deeply annoying at times, I confess that strong boundaries are one of your best qualities.<eos> - What would you say is the very best?<eos> Business only until four o'clock, Headmaster.<eos> So, before we conclude... an announcement.<eos> One of our fellow sober houses in Los Angeles is in a bit of a bind, and they need to tent for something... termites, I believe... and they need a place to stay for the weekend.<eos> I don't like where this is going.<eos> We are heaving with drunks already, Craig.<eos> Where are we gonna put these people?<eos> On cots in our rooms.
There is no way that we can let them stay here.<eos> Yes, there is, okay?<eos> They've all been cleared of the vermin, and they're each paying $5,000 to be here for two days.<eos> All we have to do is keep the little bedbug issue a secret and that's $25,000... enough to fix our roof.<eos> Is that "charity in our hearts for our fellow addicts," Craig?<eos> It's charity for our addicts, okay?<eos> We need to fix the roof.<eos> - No way. It's disgusting.<eos> - Fine. Fine.<eos> Okay.
My son, has he returned?<eos> That's Slean's horse!<eos> Hey! Get away from there!<eos> Oi!<eos> I hear there will soon be a new widow in town.<eos> It's me you want.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Can we kill him now?<eos> Someone will pay to have him back.<eos> In one piece!
- You were in his guard?<eos> - I was its master.<eos> The Outcasts, where are they headed?<eos> Speak and I'll finish you cleanly.<eos> Hold your tongue and we'll leave you for the trolls.<eos> They'll have finished with those Wisdeth guards by now.<eos> Be along for you soon.<eos> Ramin's Tomb.<eos> We're to hold Scorann there, until tomorrow.<eos> After the Gathering.
Get... get Inge Bérdsson!<eos> Gisle, where is Inge?<eos> Inge!<eos> In Borg, I shared my bed with a woman, Inga of Varteig.<eos> She bore my son, Hékon Hékonsson.<eos> He shall inherit the throne.<eos> Birkebeinerne in Eastern Norway are bringing him north.<eos> Meet them in Qsterdalen with an army!<eos> We have a traitor among us.<eos> Here, in this room.
Do it, Torstein, and get the King's son away from here.<eos> No...<eos> Inn:<eos> ...refuse.<eos> Then you will be next.<eos> We must show no mercy.<eos> You will see what befalls those who betray us!<eos> We shall defend our right.<eos> Baglers!<eos> Attack!
The other day, when you were interviewing those two witnesses.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> I had so much going on, I had Alaric take her home.<eos> But Clary's okay, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She said she was upset about a boy, but my instincts tell me there's more to the story.<eos> I wouldn't worry about that.<eos> You know guys that age, they're idiots.<eos> Just that age?
This isn't our choice to make.<eos> This is Clary's decision.<eos> You can't ask her to do this.<eos> She doesn't know what she's facing. She's not prepared.<eos> If anyone can tell me another way to recover my memories and still get the answers we need,<eos> That settles it.<eos> See?<eos> I told you she's one of us.<eos> Yeah, this place isn't creepy.<eos> Not at all.
It can't be true... what I saw.<eos> Your memory does not lie.<eos> You must accept what has been revealed.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't.<eos> What is it?<eos> What did you see?<eos> My mother lied to me.<eos> She lied all these years about my father.<eos> About your father?
Can I borrow your jacket?<eos> Uh, I don't mean to sound like super-crazy or annoying or anything, but it's just, like, they're really strict here about the dress code, so...<eos> Well, maybe since we fucked earlier, you know... it wouldn't be that big of a deal.<eos> Okay. Makes sense.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, William the Wonder!<eos> Isn't that amazing?<eos> Yeah, but I just feel like there's a trick to it.<eos> Well, yeah...<eos> That's what magic is, you know.<eos> - Mmm. - Tricks.
Well, we both saw some pretty fucked up shit.<eos> At least, I know I did, and I think Danny had the same, maybe worse.<eos> We both came back in one piece, but you know, something like that changes a man.<eos> Lot of vets are really fucked up in the head.<eos> Me, I just learned that life is short and crappy, and you gotta take what you can while you can, you know?<eos> Hence the life of crime.<eos> And your brother?<eos> I guess after all the mayhem and chaos, he just wanted something with structure in his life. A little bit of order.<eos> Did he know?<eos> About you, before today?
I don't give a damn about being a legend as long as we end Savage once and for all.<eos> So how do we find this guy?<eos> And we've arrived.<eos> Gideon, if you wouldn't mind camouflaging us as an alpine meadow, perhaps?<eos> What are you complaining about now?<eos> It's not like we time-jumped.<eos> I hate flying, especially in... whatever this thing is.<eos> Where exactly are we?<eos> - We're still in 1975, right?<eos> - Indeed.
There's cryo-storage in the MedBay.<eos> I promise we'll get our son a proper burial once we have a chance.<eos> It's still so weird to hear you call him that.<eos> But even though it was in a past life, it feels like something's missing.<eos> I know.<eos> What's that?<eos> I found it in his pocket.<eos> I've seen this knife before.<eos> This is the knife that Savage used to kill us.<eos> In our first life.
In Central City, we learned that objects associated with the night of our deaths can also be used to kill Savage.<eos> According to Aldus's notes, the dagger needs to be wielded in conjunction with an incantation inscribed on it.<eos> What does this incantation say?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't read the language.<eos> It's okay. I'll help you remember.<eos> Splendid.<eos> Now, as for the dagger...<eos> - You need someone to steal it.<eos> - Okay, fine.
What? We can't do this without you.<eos> Without any of you.<eos> Now you know we got to do this, or you wouldn't have come down. Now I need to know now Who's in and who's out.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Well, god ain't never said we was gonna be free in heaven.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. Cato, I was just...<eos> Oh, let me guess.<eos> Talkin' about runnin'.<eos> Noah:
They're increasing output to great britain.<eos> They don't have the terrain or the labor advantages we have.<eos> Egypt near invented slavery.<eos> You sound like a yankee.<eos> Easy now, schafer.<eos> Oh, you know as well as I do, tom.<eos> It isn't slavery that makes cotton king. It's management.<eos> That's right. All:<eos> Hear, hear. What are your thoughts, bill?<eos> About what?
More than rumors, noble Sestimus.<eos> I see that you are the same worshipper of Bacchus.<eos> What gaiety.<eos> There is still truth in the adage "What pleasures cannot be found<eos> "in the villa of Sestimus Amydias cannot be found in Rome!"<eos> But seriously, there is talk the Senate will send our legions out again, and this time not on a short march to Gaul.<eos> What truth to these mutterings, Sestimus?<eos> The matter has been taken up in the Senate.<eos> It seems that there is unrest in Palestine.<eos> Palestine?

- Mannix, I won't have it!<eos> - No! No!<eos> For two decades the words "Laurence Laurentz Presents"<eos> have meant something to the public.<eos> It's all right, Natalie.<eos> Okay, Walt, let me know.<eos> What's on your mind, Laurence?<eos> Hobie Doyle cannot act!<eos> Hobart Doyle is one of the biggest movie stars in the world.<eos> On horseback.
- Old?<eos> - Old, stale, rotten and...<eos> I'm talking about today.<eos> What?<eos> A little bird told me that he disappeared from the set today.<eos> Oh, that! No, no.<eos> Yes, he did have to take a break.<eos> Minor injury. High ankle sprain.<eos> What did you think I meant?<eos> No, nothing.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.<eos> How long since your last confession, my son?<eos> It's been, what, 27 hours.<eos> It's really too often, my son.<eos> You're not that bad.<eos> I don't know, Father.<eos> I snuck a cigarette. Or two.<eos> I didn't make it home in time for dinner.<eos> And I, uh, struck a movie star in anger.<eos> All right.
I'm up.<eos> William didn't show.<eos> Did you see any surveillance?<eos> Stan didn't come home again tonight.<eos> When's the alternate?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> 2:00.<eos> I told Paige a little bit about Smolensk.<eos> Do you ever wonder what it looks like now?<eos> Back home?
So I just got home.<eos> Matthew and Paige... I don't think they were just watching football.<eos> What?<eos> I don't know. It was... It was all like...<eos> - You know.<eos> - Oh... - When I came in.<eos> - Right.<eos> Father of the bride, you're paying.<eos> You can use my backyard if you want to.<eos> - Yeah, good.
Very natural.<eos> Should I show him how I can fart with my armpit?<eos> That might be too impressive, Jason.<eos> Let's keep that light under a bushel, okay?<eos> Hey.<eos> I bought you a "reading is a hoot" poster.<eos> Thought you could use it to cover your 50 Cent collage.<eos> Thanks, but I already tricked it out.<eos> All right, guys, let's finish our math homework.<eos> Cool.
Color me impressed.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I am very proud of my staff.<eos> You should be.<eos> Yahoo!<eos> Okay, Jason, your 30 minutes of ceiling time is up.<eos> Miss Feldman, why does Jason get to go up in the ceiling every day?<eos> Because Jason brokered a deal using leverage.<eos> Does anyone know what leverage is?<eos> Okay!
I could probably...<eos> yeah... probably have a little blast.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Let us get these loaded and we'll...<eos> Where do you guys smoke around here? Just over there somewhere?<eos> We've got to do some more rounds, but then it's... it's just behind the library over there..<eos> All right, we'll meet you there in 5, 10 minutes, something like that.<eos> Awesome, guys. Sounds good.<eos> Tell, uh, tell Danny I said hi.<eos> Randy Lahey.
I think your calculations are fucked. Jacob:<eos> (Indistinct)<eos> Julian: What the fuck happened to you guys?<eos> We were hiding in the woods with all the stuff and then there were dogs after us.<eos> Uh, then we got attached by a flock of porcupines.<eos> And we packed and ran.<eos> fuck is all the stuff?<eos> It's cool, man.<eos> I hid it in the lake.<eos> In the lake? Like, underwater?
No, listen. I really need your help on this court case, I really do.<eos> Look who's being all prim and proper now that her hench-whores aren't here backing her up!<eos> Not on your fucking life, Barb!<eos> I'm going to fight you until the bitter end, you heartless bitch!<eos> You can't break me, Barb.<eos> I'm too strong. Oh, oh, you're strong.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> You're strong.<eos> You're strong enough to face everyone when I tell them the truth?<eos> The truth about what?
- You don't have to trust him.<eos> You got to trust me.<eos> I'm gonna get us to freedom.<eos> If we can't find those Indians, we keep following the song.<eos> You know what I think about your damn song?<eos> The same thing I think about your girl.<eos> Hell, the same thing I think about this redneck.<eos> They all useless!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Not in the house.

Wow, look at this crowd.<eos> Jamie, this is amazing.<eos> You must be happy with this, right?<eos> I'm happy with you.<eos> There's so much to get done, you know?<eos> There's a whole list at this club and the two other ones.<eos> And you'll do it.<eos> I have faith in you.<eos> I wish I could stay right here with you, baby, but, I got to get to work.<eos> All good.
The Palace guards know you're coming.<eos> It's a suicide mission.<eos> They have 10 times your number.<eos> They'll wipe you out within 100 paces.<eos> - Just cut their throats.<eos> - This is not what you do.<eos> You've never seen me in war.<eos> You have no idea what I can do.<eos> You cannot win.<eos> Christophe...
On your feet.<eos> Outside.<eos> Make it quick, Captain.<eos> Treville?<eos> As soon as I give the word, the King will organise an emergency council meeting.<eos> It'll be over soon, my friend.<eos> Until then, be strong as you were at Alsace.<eos> Tell the King they're alive.<eos> Put the prisoners in the windows.<eos> Good.
Take against them, and next time it won't be 20 men who rise up, but 200.<eos> Then one thousand.<eos> Very well, the soldiers will not be punished.<eos> Gaston acted out of fear.<eos> It's still a treason.<eos> And he is still my brother.<eos> Surely you're not going to forgive him?<eos> I'm returning to exile? No.<eos> No, you'll be staying here in Paris.<eos> But not here at the palace.
How could they not be?<eos> I didn't talk to one person this whole entire weekend.<eos> Do you get how weird that is?<eos> Because I don't have my phone.<eos> And since my curfew corresponds with the first spin on Wheel of Fortune, it's only a matter of time before everyone realizes that something is up.<eos> This is a nightmare.<eos> The best thing you can do right now is focus on your sobriety.<eos> And make my life even bleaker and less fun than it already is? No, thanks.<eos> Hey, being sober and having fun are not mutually exclusive.<eos> In fact...
She was supposed to meet me right after school, like she should every day.<eos> That is our agreement.<eos> I feel like I've been more than fair with her.<eos> Don't you think I've been more than fair?<eos> Of course I think so. But I'm old and responsible.<eos> You are not old.<eos> We are not old.<eos> Yeah, we are.<eos> We used to go to raves.<eos> In the '90s.
I'm sorry, Rebecca. I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Don't play dumb with me, Maddie.<eos> I think you know exactly what I'm talking about, and I need it back.<eos> Just like I need my thing back? What thing?<eos> Now look who's playing dumb?<eos> I suggest if you want it back, you remember where my thing is!<eos> Oh, my God, Maddie, I cannot even begin...<eos> I don't know what's going on here...<eos> You know what?<eos> All right.
Because sometimes people say they're out the door when they really haven't left yet.<eos> Those people are horrible, horrible liars.<eos> See you soon.<eos> Simpson, not so fast. Hold up one end of this poster.<eos> Now use it to conceal this.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Now, let me just crank up the plumb bob to determine the vertical.<eos> With this mechanical marvel, we'll have this poster level in under three hours.<eos> Ooh, and for a little excitement, how about a plumb bob song?<eos> Uh... All right.
Bart gave me a synopsis.<eos> I... Oh, boy.<eos> Oh, now what?<eos> Eat your carrot and pea medley.<eos> Mom, I'll clean that up for you.<eos> Oh, thank God, some help.<eos> Where's the mop?<eos> In the mop closet.<eos> Where's the bucket?<eos> Under the mop.
It's a chance to do good for us boys in the hood!<eos> Just call us NWA,<eos> "Neighbors With Appetizers."<eos> Wow, wow. I really am the richest man in town.<eos> Not rich in money, but in what really matters:<eos> pity.<eos> And what happened to Marge is a wake up call for us all.<eos> There's no greater crime than half-assed parenting.<eos> Kirk, where's Milhouse? On the leash, baby.<eos> On the leash.
Not now, he ain't.<eos> Now he act like he can't even hear me! No matter how hard I pray.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I can't even pick up my baby girl.<eos> Look at her.<eos> Look at her!<eos> Go on now, I want you to look her in the eyes and tell me what you see.<eos> I see Pearly Mae.<eos> Yeah, she got her mama's strength.<eos> And her daddy's.
What is?<eos> You being here, I'm used to being alone.<eos> -Jesus fucking Christ!<eos> Curro, please, calm down.<eos> -Jesus fucking Christ! -Curro...<eos> -Jesus fucking Christ!<eos> -Stop shouting!<eos> -I will if I fucking feel like it!<eos> -No, you're in my home!<eos> -Your home? -What?
He'll be around.<eos> Got a light?<eos> Here comes the big shot.<eos> Triana, some guys are looking for you.<eos> Fuck me!<eos> Currito!<eos> Fucking hell, Currito!<eos> It's great to see you!<eos> -How you doin'?<eos> -Good, man.
Make yourself at home.<eos> Just don't touch the computer, I'm busy with something.<eos> Juani's sister put me onto one of those jerk-off chat pages and they rob you blind if you don't watch out.<eos> A beer here, another here...<eos> Take a seat here.<eos> Well, to Currito, to his freedom.<eos> It's great to see you.<eos> How you doin?<eos> -Good, good.<eos> -Well, well...
-Who let 'em downstairs?<eos> -I told them they couldn't.<eos> Santi.<eos> Fuck Santi, I'm the boss here.<eos> Where'd you get that sweater?<eos> -From Santi.<eos> -No gifts here, they cost a fortune.<eos> -Where the hell is Santi?<eos> -Downstairs.<eos> Downstairs?
But it's nothing, I'm fine now.<eos> Are you still living in the neighborhood?<eos> No, I've been away.<eos> Where?<eos> Traveling, a lot.<eos> But outside of Spain?<eos> That too.<eos> Where have you been to?<eos> Portugal, France...<eos> France!
No, I've been away.<eos> Where?<eos> Traveling, a lot.<eos> But outside of Spain?<eos> That too.<eos> Where have you been to?<eos> Portugal, France...<eos> France!<eos> Where?<eos> -France. Paris mostly.
Where?<eos> Traveling, a lot.<eos> But outside of Spain?<eos> That too.<eos> Where have you been to?<eos> Portugal, France...<eos> France!<eos> Where?<eos> -France. Paris mostly.<eos> -Paris?
Metallica's playing one North American gig this year.<eos> Tonight.<eos> Québec.
I already said it.<eos> Do it smart, do it so we don't get hurt, but do it.<eos> Once we're out of telecom, we get out of tech.<eos> Look, if the investors hear about this, they are gonna wonder what the fuck is going on.<eos> No, they're not, 'cause you're gonna call 'em and tell 'em.<eos> Tell 'em what?<eos> Tell 'em that we're shutting down.<eos> Give them the heads up.<eos> They can start looking elsewhere.<eos> And next week?
"Dollar" Bill Stearn...<eos> devoted family man.<eos> - Sunday school teacher.<eos> - Volunteer fireman.<eos> Wow, I'm gettin' all weepy-eyed.<eos> Guess we gotta let him go.<eos> - It hasn't even been a week.<eos> - A week we got nothing.<eos> - We do have a theory.<eos> - Finally!
- It's not fully worked out yet.<eos> - But what Dale is referring to is, uh, Bill Stearn bribed the Pepsum researcher for proprietary information on a drug called Vaccarizine.<eos> It's an enzyme they've been testing out in Iowa.<eos> Genetically modifies corn so that cows can actually digest<eos> - without antibiotics and...<eos> - It makes them shit better.<eos> I'm sorry, but does this, uh, farm report wind up anywhere near an arrest warrant?<eos> Well, we think that there is a nexus between Stearn and the guys who ran the test.<eos> We have to just place Stearn in Iowa<eos> - at the right time...
- without antibiotics and...<eos> - It makes them shit better.<eos> I'm sorry, but does this, uh, farm report wind up anywhere near an arrest warrant?<eos> Well, we think that there is a nexus between Stearn and the guys who ran the test.<eos> We have to just place Stearn in Iowa<eos> - at the right time...<eos> - So no.<eos> Don't tell him part of the story until you know the whole story.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - All right.
- Neutral territory?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Then Iowa.<eos> Stearn covered his tracks.<eos> Didn't fly, paid only cash.<eos> Maybe we pay the farmer a visit.<eos> What, with nothing?<eos> No, no. We... we gotta come heavy.<eos> Otherwise, the guy says jack shit or he... he just lawyers up.<eos> All right.
- Hey, babe.<eos> - Uh, hey.<eos> Um... which one of us has, uh, softball duty tonight?<eos> Mm, it's your turn, I thought.<eos> Right, right.<eos> Sorry. So much bullshit I'm dealing with here, I lost track.<eos> How 'bout you?<eos> How are things?<eos> At work?<eos> Yeah, wherever.
Okay, basketball.<eos> You like basketball?<eos> Yeah.<eos> One for you.<eos> Okay, here's 20 for you.<eos> It runs out, we go home.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm gonna be over here at Shoot Out the Star.<eos> Okay? - Okay.<eos> - All right.
About to do something crazy... sneaking into a show at intermission.<eos> Which one?<eos> "On the Town."<eos> I haven't second-acted a musical since college.<eos> Oh, I gotta go.<eos> They're ringing the bell.<eos> Okay, so you're not heading back to, uh, to the office today?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> Okay.
"On the Town."<eos> I haven't second-acted a musical since college.<eos> Oh, I gotta go.<eos> They're ringing the bell.<eos> Okay, so you're not heading back to, uh, to the office today?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll talk to you soon.<eos> Bye.
...that body sushi.<eos> Raw fish off a stripper.<eos> Just remember, be polite.<eos> Keep your weapons holstered.<eos> Got it.<eos> All right, guys, let's go.<eos> You fucking genius.<eos> Where is everybody?<eos> They quit already?<eos> Bathroom, mostly.
- You made a mistake when you trusted a man Who burned his own face off, I think.<eos> But no, there is no drug deal.<eos> There's no drugs. There's just paco talking to me about the easy money<eos> Y'all were gonna find. Easy, my ass.<eos> [chuckles] Thought I was gonna die of old age Waiting for you guys to find it.<eos> - Paco, you're a piece of shit.<eos> - Shh. I do like to hear myself as I'm speaking.<eos> And shit is--it's a little harsh.<eos> I mean, it's more like a scrunched up piece of-- What do they wrap candy in, baby?<eos> - Cellophane, innit?
♪ ♪ if you come to san francisco ♪<eos> - Hap?<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> And you're probably gonna hate me.<eos> After you left, I did something.<eos> Something real, real bad.<eos> I killed cheep.<eos> I drowned him in the sink.<eos> He reminded me of us.<eos> Of you.
Sure as hell beat sitting on our asses 30 clicks to nowhere waiting for our humpbacked friend to defecate the keys to our transport.<eos> Camels don't eat keys.<eos> They do, it did.<eos> And it shit it out.<eos> I shit you not.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> I've never denied it.<eos> Brave new world.<eos> I still can't stop thinking about Maggie having a pup.<eos> In this.
Everyone, this is Gregory.<eos> He keeps the trains running on time around here.<eos> I'm the boss.<eos> Well, I'm Rick. We have a community...<eos> Why don't y'all go get cleaned up, hmm?<eos> We're fine.<eos> Jesus will show you where you can get washed up.<eos> Then come back down here when you're ready.<eos> It's hard to keep this place clean. Yeah.<eos> Sure.
I want to stay out there with her.<eos> Well, this whole thing's a race to the armory.<eos> We need as many people inside as we can get.<eos> She shouldn't be out there alone. She shouldn't be out here in the first place.<eos> Okay.<eos> She's done with the hair?<eos> What've we got?<eos> - That one.<eos> - Yeah, that's it.<eos> All right.
I wish it didn't have to end, not this way, but it's how it has to be.<eos> So I'm going like I always should have.<eos> Don't come after me, please.<eos> I can see you.<eos> Come out.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass on that.<eos> Carol?<eos> You here?<eos> Upstairs.
Sometime in the night.<eos> I never heard her go, but she made a bunch of food, you know.<eos> - She took her pack, one of my coats...<eos> - Did she leave on foot? I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Rick, I took over at 12:00, I was on till 6:00.<eos> I never saw anything.<eos> Front's been quiet since the others left.<eos> What? Who?<eos> Daryl.
Yeah, we're quite happy with the terms.<eos> - Well, it's the smart play.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And even as a kid, you would never get into a fight unless you knew you could win it.<eos> Oh, do you remember that Mintz boy?<eos> He was a head taller than you, probably could've made you eat dirt.<eos> And he left that ball field thinking you were best friends.<eos> Okay, Dad, I gotta go.<eos> And then I made sure he didn't get into Dalton.<eos> Goodbye!
They'll hear about it.<eos> They'll be embarrassed.<eos> Or worse, proud.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> They should damn well be proud.<eos> Their father stood tall for them.<eos> It did feel pretty good.<eos> If I could be that for my kids...<eos> You are... and you will continue to be.<eos> All right, okay.
Thank you, guys.<eos> Take it easy this weekend, T., yeah?<eos> - Yeah, I'll try. - Take your kid<eos> - to the batting cages. - Mm.<eos> Uh, Bryan, hang in for a second.<eos> Let's go over some of the details.<eos> Right.<eos> You have an informant in Axe Capital.<eos> Boss, we should stick to the rules of recusal, the old Chinese Wall, shouldn't we?<eos> Okay.
I did.<eos> And I feel bad that I started a whole thing, but...<eos> Keith told me that we can't have any press right now, that it would fuck his business badly to be near any of this.<eos> His business?<eos> He's my husband.<eos> Not much else I can say.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Maid's leaving at 3:00 today.<eos> Some bullshit about taking her kids to the doctor.<eos> Mm. Bye.
- It's from Mike Dimonda.<eos> Says it landed in his in-box this morning.<eos> An exclusive.<eos> - Well, he's doing us a solid.<eos> - Not so solid.<eos> He knows that charges are being filed.<eos> He's requesting comment, wants to run something right away.<eos> Who filmed that?<eos> Dimonda won't say.<eos> Okay.
And you're leading the pack with it.<eos> Very impressive reporting.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I landed it.<eos> And I'm running it.<eos> I'm not gonna spike it, despite how good the veal chops are here.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> But that's not what we're talking about.<eos> We're talking about a short hold.<eos> A day.
Not the sensitive flower you are today?<eos> Exactly.<eos> I had to work to soften up.<eos> You worked me over.<eos> And being thorny still gets me in trouble.<eos> Yeah, well, I'd be willing for them to go in that direction.<eos> You always said that the desperation is what gave you an edge over the rich kids.<eos> They are the rich kids.<eos> Where are they gonna get their grit?<eos> All right.
- Someday. Yeah. - Hmm.<eos> There's still a romance to the judicial branch that certainly transcends the petty politicking in the executive.<eos> But I-I don't even see how I get there now.<eos> I mean, there's no opening in the offing.<eos> Things change.<eos> Assignments shift. Assignments shift.<eos> Ah. Now we get to the reason for our meeting, don't we?<eos> I was talking about you, but, uh, yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Also about the situation here.
I, alone, determine which attorneys lead investigations in the Southern District, Adam, not Washington.<eos> Absolument.<eos> But... if there's going to be a change, I think we would change it all the way to the Eastern District.<eos> It's cleaner.<eos> It was fun reminiscing.<eos> Enjoy your food.<eos> I'm looping you in.<eos> I'm having one-on-ones today with Butch, Channing, and Donnie.<eos> I'd like you to sit in.<eos> For what purpose?
I expect things are slow there, too.<eos> Would your agency have anything for me? Any work?<eos> You know, some work...<eos> Why?<eos> No, I didn't know.<eos> That's great. So...<eos> So, I'm calling... at the right time...<eos> I get off at the next stop.<eos> And you?<eos> The one after.
Me too.<eos> I'm visiting my mother.<eos> Aren't they awful?<eos> We go far away from them, they manage to drag us back.<eos> Mine's hospitalized.<eos> I had to pick up a rental car.<eos> I can't now. Visiting time will be over.<eos> It's fucking outrageous.<eos> Sorry, I'm on edge, but there's not even an announcement.<eos> You OK?
I had to pick up a rental car.<eos> I can't now. Visiting time will be over.<eos> It's fucking outrageous.<eos> Sorry, I'm on edge, but there's not even an announcement.<eos> You OK?<eos> That's crazy, my mother's hospitalized, too.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Alain!<eos> I'm pleased to see you.<eos> - You OK?
In Paris, I went to the Waou.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - The Waou...<eos> An upmarket gym. It's expensive, but worth it.<eos> - You go really fast.<eos> - Do I?<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Where's whatsit?<eos> Novgorod?<eos> In Russia.
What about the arts center project?<eos> I happened to see the file.<eos> If it goes ahead, the building work will last a year.<eos> Then, it'll be very noisy at night.<eos> I have no idea, but I can call the agency.<eos> Yes, please do.<eos> It's Audrey.<eos> I'm with a client at the Rue Jean Jaurès apartment.<eos> Can you tell me about the arts center project?<eos> Alright.
Hi, did you find him? No.<eos> No, I, uh...<eos> I left pictures at 50 different places along the road.<eos> Nobody's seen him.<eos> I called some hospitals, too, and nothing. Nothing?<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Look, I'm gonna be home in... in a couple hours and, uh, just let... just let me know if... if you hear anything.<eos> Okay, fine, I will.<eos> Bye.
I've been running the motel by myself the last few days, and my son's out of town, and the girl who usually helps me out... well, she needed some time off.<eos> You mean Emma?<eos> Yes, do you know her?<eos> I... spoke with her in the village the last time I was here.<eos> Nice girl.<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> Okay, Ms. Ellis.<eos> Um, I'm going to put you in room five.<eos> The village is about a mile; it's a beautiful walk, and I will be up at the house if you need anything.<eos> All right.
No, I'm in the doghouse for applying to Major Crimes.<eos> She's only got me playing family liaison.<eos> Mr. Kipford?<eos> DCI Stanhope.<eos> I understand you have some information?<eos> Might have.<eos> So when did you last see your neighbour Anne Marie?<eos> - Last Saturday.<eos> - And what time was that?<eos> Some time after 04:15.
DCI Stanhope.<eos> I understand you have some information?<eos> Might have.<eos> So when did you last see your neighbour Anne Marie?<eos> - Last Saturday.<eos> - And what time was that?<eos> Some time after 04:15.<eos> Do you remember anything else?<eos> Some shouting, maybe.<eos> - In the night.
- Did you know?<eos> - How would I know?<eos> I know she only came back into your lives recently.<eos> - So you've nosed into us.<eos> - They have to.<eos> I'm not nosing, love.<eos> It's called --<eos> I don't want you thinking things about her that aren't true, OK?<eos> I just need you to tell me everything that might be useful.<eos> However trivial.
I've got a business to establish.<eos> Can't be telling tales.<eos> Now, what tale is it that you're not telling?<eos> When was Anne Marie last working?<eos> Ages back. She was never my first choice.<eos> Why not?<eos> Look, I don't know the inside track but I noticed a pattern.<eos> When she was on a shift, less people came in.<eos> I got the impression she was disliked.<eos> Impression? How?
Up Alston way.<eos> What, 30 odd miles?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Well, that's that then.<eos> What about Tate?<eos> What was he doing that night?<eos> Home alone, he's says.<eos> But there's no way of verifying.<eos> We can bring him in on suspicion, can't we?<eos> Yeah. On what grounds?
Only we've got your prints all over the door.<eos> And they weren't there when we first cordoned it off.<eos> I gave her a bracelet.<eos> I didn't want it to get lost.<eos> OK, so if that's true, where is it?<eos> I couldn't find it.<eos> When did you last see the victim?<eos> I saw her on Wednesday and Friday.<eos> I took her to a place called Blackhall.<eos> - What, on the coast?
Night Anne Marie Richards died.<eos> Where were you?<eos> You already know this.<eos> I was half way up a fell with my uni buddies.<eos> - Yeah, doing what?<eos> - Training.<eos> - Training on a bike?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> And that's exactly how you got home, isn't it?<eos> On a bike.
Let's go.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Some sicko had a lair in the woods.<eos> They think he had the mayor's kid in there.<eos> People are animals.<eos> So, you remember my car, huh?<eos> Do you still play football?<eos> You used to really good.<eos> What kind of sleeper are you, Hank?<eos> Side, back, tummy?
His name is Frank Hedges.<eos> He's been a CI for two years.<eos> He's in a gang called the Panzer Strike Force, and the leader of the gang is this guy.<eos> Vince Sargent. He's friends with Dallas Wolf.<eos> So, Vince and Dallas Wolf are tight?<eos> Yeah, I told you, Vince calls into Wolf's show every week.<eos> So, Frank brings you into the gang, you hang out, get some credibility, you make these guys like you.<eos> You get close to Vince. Then, you use him to get to know Wolf.<eos> This is my friend Nate I was telling you about.<eos> Hey, everybody.
All right, so what, are we gonna stand around all night - or we gonna get fucking drunk!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> Come on, junior, let's get some fucking beer, motherfucker!<eos> Come on, boy!<eos> Get in there, boy!<eos> Hey, Nate, you know what, man?<eos> Everybody seems to really fucking like you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is my friend, Nate, I was telling you about.<eos> Hey, everybody.
What's "vices"?<eos> Oh, boy, there we go!<eos> I'm sorry about that, that's my ride.<eos> Gerry, Becky, thanks for everything.<eos> Nathan, I don't know what to say.<eos> I owe you, big time.<eos> Why don't you stop by the compound some time.<eos> Oh, I'm not really in Ohio that much, but I'd love to if I ever am.<eos> No, I meant the... the new one.<eos> - Here in Virginia.
Not like, having a sock here means you can't get rid of me.<eos> Socks are not anchors.<eos> Okay, I'm going to see you tomorrow night, at that gig.<eos> Can we just agreed to that, please?<eos> Alright.<eos> Are you still there?<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> You know, one of these nights, you're going to let me s...<eos> I love you too.<eos> Hey, sexy.
Rebecca, please.<eos> I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we are.<eos> You can take the bed.<eos> Or the couch if you want.<eos> No.<eos> This is good.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cool.
As you like.<eos> American Indian?<eos> Chiricahua Apache by birth and right.<eos> Are you familiar with the West?<eos> Only through the newspapers.<eos> It is not what it was.<eos> But then what is, Sir Malcolm?<eos> How do you know me?<eos> I've been following you.<eos> In Africa?
Utterly.<eos> So it will be as if she never walked this earth.<eos> Death ribbon, ma'am?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Death ribbon, ma'am.<eos> For the poet.<eos> The dead poet like.<eos> Penny apiece, honor Mr. Tennyson?<eos> Yes, all right.
Has he said anything about getting any leads on who might be after me this time?<eos> I'm not saying. What?<eos> Listen, I've been thinking that maybe you should let me take lead for a while.<eos> If anything comes up, I will tell you, I promise, but we can't have you blurring around the city all upset.<eos> Just go back to work, be normal.<eos> So, what, you're benching me? Yes.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> And, hopefully, with any luck, JT has already found something.<eos> All right?<eos> All right.
Yes, I am.<eos> And, hopefully, with any luck, JT has already found something.<eos> All right?<eos> All right.<eos> Lead the way.<eos> I can't find anything.<eos> That's why you got to label boxes.<eos> So when you're looking for something, you can find it.<eos> Where's my other shoe?<eos> By the door.
Thank you. Wait.<eos> What-What about DHS?<eos> What about 'em?<eos> Did you erase their files, too?<eos> Please. I mean, I may be a genius, but I'm not a magician.<eos> Their encryptions have encryptions.<eos> Relax.<eos> Uh, I'm sure the Deputy Secretary's gonna double down on protection after this to protect his own ass as much as yours.<eos> Your secret's safe.<eos> Yeah, for now, maybe.
Of course he does.<eos> I told him.<eos> Why the fuck did you...<eos> I-I-I heard from some guys in his office that he was still considering pulling the thing from us.<eos> He was wondering about our ability to close.<eos> So I let it leak that we were closer than anyone knew.<eos> Nice kikashi.<eos> How the fuck do you know what a kikashi...<eos> You don't have to live in Asia to play a little Go.<eos> Okay.
Okay, this we can work with.<eos> The AG wants to be on that podium in the worst way.<eos> We won't let her, but we can use her enthusiasm at the right time.<eos> Here's what I didn't tell 'em...<eos> we just had a breakthrough.<eos> Donnie made a substantial move based on inside information.<eos> Direct ties to Axelrod.<eos> I'm waiting on details.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Finally.
bigger than I could give ya.<eos> You got the ups.<eos> Now you get the downs.<eos> You and me were all but done when I met him.<eos> You know, just making sure lines aren't blurred, that you're not maybe helping the guys be pissed off.<eos> Nah.<eos> No, everything's clear, not blurred.<eos> And I don't need any help.<eos> The whole department's pretty bent, matter of fact.<eos> After all the support?
Now you are found.<eos> Kevin's backpack?<eos> Mm. It's in his room, I think.<eos> What?<eos> Donnie Caan finally used his credit card at Trapper Lodge.<eos> Some shitty restaurant in downtown Cleveland.<eos> Mm-hmm. Did you send in locals?<eos> - [typing on laptop - Gone when they got there, but just a matter of time before we wrap him up now.<eos> Hmm, Trapper Lodge...<eos> Okay.
Then Brody gets hurt and you take his place.<eos> Yeah, what about it?<eos> You said you didn't want to fight for Vega.<eos> Hey, man, I understand.<eos> For a mill, I'd change my principals, too.<eos> What does he know, he's just a kid, right?<eos> A kid who really looks up to you.<eos> Besides, you're the one who said you wouldn't fight for Vega.<eos> Yeah, but, I mean, these are my terms.<eos> Yeah, your terms.
See, that's what I'm talking about.<eos> You see, by sidelining the has-been Brody James, and replacing him with the Internet Ram-Bro... I mean, come on, that puts us back in the black, Jack.<eos> Let's go make some money.<eos> Hugo.<eos> I quit.<eos> You quit?<eos> Now?<eos> Oh, my God, it's you.<eos> The name's JeeJa.<eos> But at the gym...
At a time like this, a family pulls together.<eos> That's what Axe Capital is... a family.<eos> One I'm part of, too.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> We're fine.<eos> Thanks for the casserole.<eos> Want company?<eos> No.<eos> I'd be no good.<eos> All right.
When's the last time you even hung out in the old neighborhood?<eos> What are we supposed to do, Go back to fucking McCrory's and shoot pool with the guys?<eos> And the night takes shape.<eos> So?<eos> We break it down.<eos> Put it in boxes.<eos> Well, this is where we get off, Dale.<eos> This tight little team can handle it.<eos> FBI doesn't do clerical?<eos> Not on this one.
When I was young, I figured if I was truly there for my patients, I could get them to be truly open with me.<eos> I quickly learned that's not the case, but you still hope.<eos> Really?<eos> That's what you were thinking about when you were young?<eos> Fuck.<eos> You chose the right line of work.<eos> I was just thinking about getting rich and getting even.<eos> Have you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mostly.
So you need to figure out what part of your self-image is false.<eos> And then you either need to live up to it or lose it.<eos> Interesting word... "false." Like, uh... when someone knows that they have to tell a lover goodbye.<eos> But they can't quite do it, so instead, they sleep with them one last time.<eos> Then they have their own unspoken goodbye, not letting on that everything's changed until... after the night is over.<eos> I'm not sure that's what we're discussing here.<eos> No, maybe not.<eos> But it came to mind, so I said it.<eos> Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?<eos> In a sense.
Senior's your roof.<eos> - Everyone needs a roof.<eos> - I may need one.<eos> It doesn't mean I have to fucking like it.<eos> Yeah, but if you don't have a roof, you can't be surprised when it starts raining on you.<eos> Well, it's like the man sang,<eos> "it may be the devil or it may be the Lord, but you're gonna have to serve somebody," right?<eos> Hi.<eos> Think about that.<eos> - All right. - Mm-hmm.
So no, I'm not disgusted with you.<eos> For whatever reason, when it comes to you, that's... that's just not on the table.<eos> You know, some of your wires aren't where they should be, either.<eos> I can't argue.<eos> Is that why you've been looking at other shops?<eos> That's what you've been drilling for all night.<eos> Where were you thinking about?<eos> Was it Insight?<eos> Point One Four?<eos> No, Zenobia.
I feel young again.<eos> Wanna go to prom?<eos> I know better than to go with the bad boy.<eos> Do you?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I cry sometimes.<eos> At sentimental things.<eos> Commercials.<eos> And I don't tell you.<eos> Okay.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You're doing good.<eos> I'm not great at projecting authority.<eos> It's nice to talk Spanish, though.<eos> Reminds me of home.<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> Especially Sundays.
We were taught that each is given to fill an evolutionary need at the time.<eos> Are you being serious?<eos> To create equilibrium within the species.<eos> Yin yang and all that.<eos> At least, that's what we were taught.<eos> An actual intelligent design.<eos> Uh, sir, I think you're gonna be pretty...<eos> Stop what you're doing. Come with me.<eos> What do you think of Mr. Campbell?<eos> Lincoln?
Go suck cock, bitch.<eos> David, no.<eos> Yeah, go suck the devil's cock, bitch!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Good one, Dave.<eos> - Fucker loogied all over my window.<eos> - Welcome to LA.<eos> - No shit!<eos> - This city sucks.<eos> All right.
- Welcome to LA.<eos> - No shit!<eos> - This city sucks.<eos> All right.<eos> First ones here.<eos> Only ones here.<eos> Sorry, why are we not at a taping of Two and A Half Men?<eos> Chloe, can you keep his negative energy away from me, please?<eos> And, David, that shitty show's been canceled.<eos> Just like the photos.
Yeah.<eos> Can you get the hell out of the way?<eos> Dick.<eos> Wow, Dave, you're just an asshole magnet.<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> I'm here with you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Dave, do you ever get tired of being wrong?<eos> Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.<eos> All right. Yeah.
- Okay.<eos> Yo.<eos> Dude, don't let them get away.<eos> - I got 'em.<eos> I got 'em. - I think we're in Malibu.<eos> Posh Satanists.<eos> Yeah. They probably have a fuckin' reality show.<eos> This is exciting.<eos> I'm, like, gonna pee.<eos> Okay.
Is that the cumball from the shop?<eos> Yeah, that's cumball, all right.<eos> - He had a knife on him.<eos> - My God, I told you. - We should get closer.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Come on. Come on.<eos> - Let's do it. Let's go.<eos> - All right.<eos> All right.
I'll see you soon.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, no, I... I really appreciate that, Jay.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We just, uh... we just got off to a late start.<eos> Be an extra day. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, no, it's perfect. It's perfect.<eos> All right, cool.
All right, Elise, you made your fucking point! All right, I talked to my cousin.<eos> We can crash at his place in the Palisades.<eos> There's a key under the mat.<eos> - Where's the Palisades?<eos> - The fuck if I know.<eos> I want to leave.<eos> Elise, we don't have a choice right now.<eos> - Says who?<eos> - Says the LAPD.<eos> All right?
Let's just grab our things and go.<eos> Right now.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Come on.<eos> Fine.<eos> - David, I'm gonna be sick.<eos> - Hey, it's okay.<eos> It's not okay, I'm gonna...<eos> David, we need to pull off somewhere.<eos> All right.
Kenny B. This guy was one crazy hombre back in the day.<eos> Do you remember that hotel in Maidstone?<eos> Oh, who can- - Who can-- Who can forget that?<eos> -Did a tour of Medway basin. -Thank you.<eos> And this fella--<eos> Well, they'll have to re-paper that hotel room. - Yeah.<eos> - I love what you're doing these days.<eos> Ken, I really admire your balls. Okay.<eos> The B man.<eos> Alrighty.
Get out of town.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Actually, I might just have a little something for you.<eos> Is it weed killer?<eos> -You left our house to get some weed killer 24 years ago.<eos> I haven't seen you since.<eos> -I see what you're doing.<eos> -The weeds are really out of control now.<eos> I did explain my departure in the letters.<eos> The letters?
This is actually a bloody good idea.<eos> I told you.<eos> Lovely. Seven o'clock, Jammers Club.<eos> Lock up your pussy!<eos> The Wolf Pack is back on the prowl.<eos> -It's a hospital, Jeff.<eos> -Aye? Keep it down a little bit.<eos> Flange ahoy, Richie.<eos> Flange ahoy.<eos> Yes indeed.
Just two boats who crossed once before and are now crossing again on the return charter, looking for that safe harbor, that magical other person, and sometimes that other person can be staring you right in the face<eos> -and you never even realized it.<eos> -Hey, Richie.<eos> - Clive.<eos> -It's good to see you.<eos> -So good to see you.<eos> What are you doing in my garden, man?<eos> What are you doing in the garden?<eos> -Well, I live here. -Yeah.<eos> What? What, in the garden?
You know, when I found her, she was on the scrap heap.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> She was pretty busted up.<eos> One careless owner.<eos> But then I brought her here, fixed her up, gave her all the love, care, and attention she needed and now she goes like a dream.<eos> Take her out for a ride every single day.<eos> And then I fixed up the car.<eos> I was talking about Pat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> -Not the car.
Never seen it before.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought you engineers like to take credit for your work.<eos> Give me your gun.<eos> You planning on using that on me, too?<eos> Will it help you give up any names?<eos> - We would have floated him... but we're not on the Ark.<eos> - Let's put him in lock-up.<eos> - He's a traitor.<eos> - On the Ark...
What's Monty's favorite color?<eos> Green.<eos> It's a joke.<eos> 275 iterations, not it.<eos> Favorite book.<eos> "Catcher in the Rye."<eos> Where do those ducks go, anyway?<eos> Keep trying.<eos> Favorite place.<eos> Down here or up there?
He was my mentor, and now I just helped lock him up.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm not so sure about that.<eos> Monty, being down here, I've learned that if something helps you survive, it's always the right thing.<eos> Pike taught me that, taught all of us.<eos> It's what kept us alive.<eos> You do what it takes.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Good?
Put these on.<eos> The door we were banging on for the last 24 hours is open.<eos> Let's use it.<eos> Clarke:<eos> You killed your commander.<eos> How are you still free?<eos> I'm the only Fleimkepa.<eos> Now please, if you go now, you can slip in with the crowds arriving for tomorrow's conclave.<eos> You heard the man.<eos> All right.
Oks, is your team in position?<eos> Oks.<eos> Octavia, on radio:<eos> Roger that.<eos> We're in position and ready to intercept.<eos> Octavia kom Skaikru.<eos> [Beep]<eos> Sir, you were right.<eos> Octavia Blake is here, and she's not alone.<eos> On their knees.
Take him.<eos> Lift this blockade.<eos> _<eos> No.<eos> Hey, no.<eos> No.<eos> The Grounders are gonna need him alive.<eos> They didn't get justice for Finn.<eos> We won't get away with that again.<eos> In that case...
It... it wasn't long after unity day, right?<eos> Generation one, they didn't know that they were leaving the ground forever.<eos> Some of them lost their minds.<eos> Not listening, ok?<eos> We got to meet the others in six hours.<eos> I need sleep.<eos> Oh, he hates ghost stories.<eos> Well, I want to hear it, so come on, Miller.<eos> Scare me.<eos> All right.
Please.<eos> I've only got one more class to reach them.<eos> Then figure out a way to reach them, because you are all they've got.<eos> All right. Can we just get out of here, seriously?<eos> You got better things to do, Murphy?<eos> Oh, is that an offer, Mclntyre?<eos> You're an epic dick, Murphy.<eos> Everybody take your seats.<eos> I'm sure all of you will be glad to know that we are officially done talking about Earth skills.<eos> Oh, great. In that case...
I trust you've all had a chance to recover, freshen up from that reception.<eos> I got to say, it's nice to finally put a series of faces to all your unpronounceable names.<eos> Uh, okay, well, on behalf of President Ellis, I'd like to thank you all for gathering here.<eos> As I'm sure you're all aware, there have been rumors, reports, and sightings of a new breed of alien living among us.<eos> It's our hope that, by working together, we can come to a consensus about how to deal with them.<eos> We can start by not calling them aliens.<eos> They prefer the term "inhumans."<eos> What kind of a name is that?<eos> Is it meant to intimidate us, mock us?<eos> Not at all.
I'm okay.<eos> Listen, papi, I need you to do something for me, all right?<eos> I want you to go over to Michael's and tell his mom that Sophia's in the SHU.<eos> And she didn't do nothin' wrong.<eos> - Oh, that ain't right.<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> Hey, Doggett.<eos> I'm feeling a lot better.<eos> -How you feelin'?<eos> -I'm okay.
Except that the Thames is tidal.<eos> We have an hour and a half before the water retreats.<eos> I'm not saying I'll live, I'm saying I'm gonna outlive you.<eos> Quite stirring, your pettiness in the face of adversity.<eos> Synced and corrected by peritta<eos> Sister Fabian?<eos> If that's all, Sergeant Gudgett?<eos> Our girls are quite prone to hysteria and the sooner we can put this behind us, the better.<eos> Can't rush these things, Sister Mathilda.<eos> Right then, Winnie.
The furnishings can all be removed if, uh--<eos> No.<eos> I would want the furnishing as they are.<eos> Okay.
The case is closed, it's forgotten.<eos> And now you're here with me.<eos> It's less weird than you think.<eos> You're not the first person I've dealt with who's fucked off with God.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Right, it's time to sew me up.<eos> What?<eos> Just, just, just-- Swab it with the whiskey.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay?
No, no.<eos> Not hungry.<eos> Do you need to go to bed?<eos> Eh, no.<eos> No, got to keep going.<eos> I need that steel.<eos> No surrender.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Um.. um, uh, yeah.<eos> - Okay. - Uh--
Such was your anger from what they had done to you and your family.<eos> Yes.<eos> A woman.<eos> What happened between you and this woman?<eos> In time, we stopped wounding each other.<eos> The anger became something else, equally powerful.<eos> Love.<eos> Of a kind.<eos> Like a daughter?<eos> Of a kind.
What happened to him in the book?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> He was in a number of the books, actually.<eos> Story has it he died of old age somewhere in a forgotten grotto in the South Pacific.<eos> But I don't believe it.<eos> I think he's still out there.<eos> Waiting for you.<eos> I'm glad you came today.<eos> I hope my lecture didn't bore you unduly.<eos> Not at all.
Is anyone there?<eos> If your goal was to scare the crap out of me, mission accomplished!<eos> And as far as I'm concerned... you can have it out with those Shadowhunters.<eos> Especially, the blonde one.<eos> You know, you don't need me.<eos> On the contrary, I do.<eos> Uh, look at all this stuff, these screens.<eos> I mean, can any of this help me find Simon?<eos> Where is he, anyway?<eos> Some kind of crypt in Transylvania?
Is everything all right?<eos> What's going on? I'm sure your parents will explain.<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> Taken together with glass being found in a jar of baby food yesterday, it would suggest that someone's got it in for your business.<eos> Typically in these cases, the motive is extortion.<eos> "Pay so much or we'll ruin your business and your reputation."<eos> Have you received any threats like that?<eos> - When did this start?<eos> - About a month ago.<eos> Always at the same branch.
Right.<eos> Well, there we are. Mystery solved.<eos> Good night, Mrs Richardson.<eos> Would you wait until my husband gets home?<eos> - When will that be?<eos> - Not long. Please.<eos> I just don't really want to be alone, not with everything that's happened.<eos> You can understand that, can't you?<eos> - Any news?<eos> - No. Not yet.
Because I want to change my dress.<eos> You're big enough to do that by yourself.<eos> But the zip sticks.<eos> I'm sure Mr Richardson will be able to assist you when he arrives.<eos> You're not going to help me, are you?<eos> You really are a heel.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - There was someone there.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Outside, by the pool.
Telephone directory.<eos> S to Z.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Must be the other box.<eos> He could be anywhere, sir.<eos> Clean away with the money, and us none the wiser as to the girl.<eos> - It was a good plan.<eos> - Nothing's foolproof.<eos> He's got us beat.<eos> So far.
Hallward's dental records have been located and match those of the cadaver recovered from the fire.<eos> If it wasn't Hallward, who was it on the phone?<eos> And whom do we have here?<eos> WPC 734 Trewlove, sir.<eos> One of the replacement intakes, sir.<eos> Started last week. - Your first posting, is it?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Well, we run a taut ship here at Cowley, though I like to think a happy one also.<eos> All work and...
If you wish to do so, do so formally...<eos> If you want to hurt them, now's the time.<eos> - What do you want to know?<eos> - Darling... - No!<eos> You don't call me that! - Please.<eos> Think of your father.<eos> When did he ever think of me? When did either of you think of me?<eos> "Richardsons - for all the family."<eos> I'll answer your questions.<eos> But not with these people here.
Bird to Zephyr, painting target.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> Copy that, Bird.<eos> Target's lit. We're tracking now.<eos> Okay, it looks like Malick's convoy's heading for this decommissioned power plant about 30 kilometers away.<eos> Dead in the middle of Nowhereville, Siberia.<eos> Yeah, if Malick and his Russian patsy want to build some<eos> Inhuman sanctuary, why not build it someplace nice and sunny?<eos> Same reason they don't put a prison camp in Malibu ...<eos> "Not in my backyard."
I'd take a bullet for any one of you ... not for the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo on the wall, for you.<eos> You were willing to let Andrew die to get revenge.<eos> That's not what S.H.I.E.L.D.'s about.<eos> No, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s all about the mission, not the person next to you.<eos> The person next to you was me.<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D. is about sacrifice, not for you or me but for the greater good.<eos> - Even over the ones you love?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I don't know whether I admire you or feel sad for you or both.<eos> Either way...
We have about 90 seconds.<eos> When Fitz triggers the EMP, you'll go out that door to your left.<eos> - There are two guards ... - Sir, we can't.<eos> Take them out, then head for the ship ...<eos> - A distraction won't work here.<eos> - We can't risk that. It'll expose all of you.<eos> Once you're back, we'll change your identities, move your families, and unfortunately, you'll be done in the field ...<eos> Sir, I think that we've proven we're not built for the lab<eos> - or for office work.<eos> - Or prison.
Male sergeant: Shooters, one minute of slow fire time remaining.<eos> Recruit number 11, you're in the berm.<eos> Settle your ass down.<eos> Female sergeant: Ease up on the fore-end, recruit.<eos> You're not waxing your surfboard.<eos> All right, perfect. Just like that.
That is today's burning question.<eos> Anybody else get sick on the base?<eos> No one yet, But there can be a three-week delay in symptoms.<eos> We need to investigate all potential sources At pendleton.<eos> Quick question: Are we gonna be issued Geiger counters?<eos> No, mr. Deeks, But lead-lined boxer shorts are available.<eos> Granger: If this isn't a work-related exposure, We have to consider terrorist activities.<eos> Let's be certain we're not dealing With pirated radioactive material<eos> Or a dirty bomb in the making.<eos> Callen:
Are any of your friends or family Undergoing cancer treatment at the moment?<eos> Deeks: Does he have Any regular after work hangouts?<eos> He came right home.<eos> We're getting the nursery together.<eos> Kensi: And is the base the only place that he works?<eos> No.<eos> He started moonlighting as a security guard, Like, once a week.<eos> And where is that?<eos> A construction site in carlsbad, To help make ends meet. Lots of bills with a new baby<eos> Deeks: Right.
Oaks.<eos> What do you got?<eos> We need to evacuate all the cops and firefighters.<eos> Have them stage half a mile away.<eos> What about the bomb squad?<eos> Send in one guy in a suit.<eos> Everyone else clears out.<eos> Let's go.<eos> There he is.<eos> Ten o'clock.
Looks like our honeymooners were going stargazing.<eos> That seems to be everywhere. Just look up.<eos> True that, but people from all walks of life come to stargaze at Belize's world-renowned Coral Atolls.<eos> I'll put that on the bucket list.<eos> To get there, they would've had to travel by boat by leaving from Banyan Bay, which means that they would've turned right in a 1/2-mile.<eos> I think I may have found where our couple went offroading.<eos> Our vics were driving a red jeep, right? Yes, sir.<eos> It was a part of their honeymoon package.<eos> Hey! In pursuit!<eos> Of what?
Why this whole Aztec thing?<eos> Why does that speak to him?<eos> Regressing to a culture where men were conquerors has allowed him to find his place in this world.<eos> I want you to meet someone special.<eos> This is Susie.<eos> She will be another mommy.<eos> I reached out to my friends at a webpage called The global missing peoples network.<eos> Denise Brown of Toronto posted about her daughter Trish Brown's mysterious disappearance 3 years ago in Belize, where she met a boy named Colin Jackson on a cruise ship<eos> - and they eloped. - Where were they last seen?<eos> At the San Pedro courthouse.
- What time is it?<eos> - Daytime.<eos> Where's everybody else?<eos> They bailed on us.<eos> Come on.<eos> My old man used to bring us up here.<eos> Said a mean old troll lived in the caves.<eos> Gave me nightmares for weeks.<eos> Summat in there.<eos> In the corner.
There was dirt in the airways, so he was still alive.<eos> - And the second blow...<eos> - That finished him off?<eos> - So, deliberate.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> What about that black plastic?<eos> Anything on that?<eos> Just dirt.<eos> Any blood other than his?<eos> Not in the cave or near it.
According to his bank records, he withdrew £200 from this machine, just after ten, Tuesday morning.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Could he have been in here with someone? Don't know.<eos> What about your mate?<eos> He might know something.<eos> We're usually quiet in here weekdays.<eos> Police.<eos> - All right, mate?<eos> - All right.
No. I... I didn't think.<eos> Well, that lad might have taken a photo of his killer.<eos> - It was Rich's idea.<eos> - Did you know Jamie?<eos> No.<eos> But I saw him a few nights before.<eos> Where'd you see him?<eos> Lovers' Corner.<eos> On Sunday night, me and Rich were up there.<eos> - What time?
No. I don't hang out with fairground girls.<eos> So, when did you last hear from him?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Last summer?<eos> June, I think. Right.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> It was April 12th last year.<eos> You told him that he was an embarrassment and Brendan decided he'd had enough, he was leaving.<eos> I remember.<eos> April, then.
We know Harris had an accomplice the night Brendan died.<eos> Or have we got this all wrong and Harris really is the world's best one-armed grave-digger?<eos> I took Harris to the hospital that night.<eos> That's all.<eos> Didn't see Brendan's body lying around anywhere?<eos> No?<eos> Did Harris tell you anything?<eos> Look, if you don't start talking soon, pet, I'm gonna take your lovely fairground apart piece by piece, and then your house and then your car, until I find something.<eos> And then I'm gonna bring your daughter back in and then your husband, and I won't stop until I can tell Reverend Haleford and Grace Marsh what happened to their lads.<eos> No? All right!
I am writing an article" ..on the dying mill industry. ..and the abandoned ones that are still functioning.<eos> The mill owner, Mr. Hari Prakash.<eos> I want to talk to him.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He hasn't arrived yet.<eos> - Huh?<eos> He hasn't arrived yet.<eos> - I see.<eos> Where's his office?<eos> - First floor.

Kumar.<eos> Munna is a drug-lord of this area.<eos> I owe him a lot of money.<eos> They are after me.<eos> During the time-period you're inquiring about" ..l was in prison for drunk-driving.<eos> You can confirm with the police.<eos> And that black van? Belongs to me.<eos> I used to hire it out. To clients who had to shift furniture, cupboards etc" while shifting houses.<eos> Like movers and packers you know..<eos> Mostly to them.
If you or anyone you know are exhibiting these symptoms, immediately contact emergency medical services.<eos> Officials have been advised that at this time the viral infection poses an immediate danger to the public.<eos> As a precaution, resident should stay indoors, keep all windows, doors and vents closed.<eos> Turn off all air conditioners, ration your...<eos> - Stop, stop the car.<eos> Jason stop the car.<eos> Christ, Jason, stop the fucking car.<eos> They have a child.<eos> - So do we!<eos> Okay?
Shh, mama's here.<eos> I'm so sorry I left you.<eos> I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.<eos> - Y'know, I don't know anything about you other than the fact that you're stubborn.<eos> - I'm not stubborn. - Aha!<eos> Only stubborn people instantly deny being stubborn.<eos> - It's called entrapment. - Maybe.<eos> But now we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you, Ann, whatever the hell your last name is, is stubborn.<eos> - You're good at that.<eos> - What exactly?
We asked you to make them stop barking.<eos> They're dogs.<eos> They bark.<eos> That's what they fucking do!<eos> Yanis!<eos> Shut up!<eos> My babies haven't napped in over a week because of your loud mouth.<eos> Now, what is going on?<eos> These two rug-chomping dykebats called Animal Services on my babies!<eos> All right-- all right!
- Would y--<eos> - Wh-wh-wh-<eos> What're you gonna do with the dogs?<eos> I'ma bring 'em down to the shelter.<eos> Owner has seven days to get permits and provide a clean living area and pay for microchips and vaccinations.<eos> Otherwise, they become candidates for adoption or euthanasia.<eos> You can't kill my dogs, motherfucker.<eos> Hey, get the fuck off me.<eos> Don't make me fucking tase you!<eos> All right-- all right-- all right!
You keep reminding us.<eos> What's with the attitude?<eos> Look, you're on my ass 24/7.<eos> At home, "Did you take your meds?"<eos> At work, "You're late. Pick up the pace."<eos> How about some gratitude for the job I got you?<eos> Gratitude for what?<eos> Sloshing through fry muck all day, having people snap their fingers at me, listening to my bitchy sister boss me around?<eos> If you don't like it, leave. - Fine.<eos> - Fine.

Say they're off buying a sandwich, or in bed with the flu... recuperating under an assumed name at Metro-General...<eos> Sooner or later, he gets to them, too.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> My office is offering you a chance to save yourself.<eos> Whether you take it, is up to you.<eos> And your, uh... legal team.<eos> And the police have no idea who's doing this?<eos> It's an ongoing investigation.<eos> But our intelligence people are close to completing a profile.<eos> A profile?
It's likely he'll be killed if we send him back.<eos> So be it. He tried to slay a dragon and he missed the mark. Now he's gotta face the fire.<eos> Our fear is more killings, more company seizures. That leads to a run on the banks, collapse of the ruble, default on debts.<eos> And we already know he's been back-channeling about a bailout with the IMF.<eos> Well, if you have a proposal to make, then make it quickly.<eos> - I have a speech to prep for. - Yes, sir.<eos> Last year you wore the taupe, so maybe this is too similar?<eos> Come in.<eos> I was able to get Mrs. Hale on the phone.<eos> Oh, great.
My mother's. Two-carat diamonds. For tonight.<eos> There's nothing quite like diamond earrings.<eos> Shall we begin?<eos> Uh, this year, we're handling the arrival a bit differently.<eos> You'll be escorted to the rotunda for a photo op with the leadership before going to the holding room.<eos> I don't need to go to the holding room. You can take me directly to the gallery.<eos> Yes, that's fine. Whatever the First Lady prefers.<eos> And we'll need two separate motorcades after.<eos> I'll be going straight to the airport.<eos> - Two motorcades, then.
- I'll call the speech writers.<eos> No, I wanna do these myself.<eos> And track down Calista.<eos> We have to make room for one more guest.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Ah. What's that?<eos> I'm having it removed.<eos> Well, that's too bad.<eos> I liked it. Hmm, time to move on.<eos> From what?
You've gotten some sun.<eos> Tractor-pulling event yesterday.<eos> I should've worn a hat.<eos> -Are Doris and Celia here?<eos> -They were.<eos> I set up cots for them in the guest room, but when I heard you were coming, I sent them off to a hotel.<eos> I figured you'd want that room for yourself.<eos> That's very thoughtful.<eos> You have an event now.<eos> Limestone College.
Let's notify the press corps.<eos> - About the operation?<eos> - No, to reassure the American people.<eos> - Shall I meet you in there?<eos> - Ten minutes.<eos> The cabinet?<eos> - Still waiting on your decision, sir. - Good.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I want you to land the plane in China.<eos> China, sir?
I got one.<eos> Hurry, fat-ass!<eos> How can idiots say there's no God when a species that evolved from dinosaurs feeds us their unfertilized babies?<eos> Ugh, if I could lay eggs like these, I'd never leave my bedroom.<eos> The farmer!<eos> Homer Simpson, I am going to enjoy finding it in my heart to forgive you for this.<eos> Well, there's no getting past that.<eos> We may not be able to steal Flanders' eggs, but we can steal his idea.<eos> You mean get our own chickens, feed them, love them and eat their eggs?<eos> Check.
And to provide a distraction while we drove away.<eos> Then why are you still here?<eos> Our car wouldn't start.<eos> Mom, doesn't it frighten you that we almost went to Mars out of sheer stubbornness?<eos> That's what a mother-daughter relationship is, sweetie.<eos> A series of near-fatal emotional standoffs.<eos> Okay, but it doesn't have to be that way.<eos> Surely we can learn from this.<eos> One day, we'll figure it out.<eos> On this planet or another.
You knew he wasn't really here.<eos> Yeah, he wasn't moving much.<eos> There was also a lag.<eos> Blake usually interrupts you a lot more.<eos> I also know that wasn't a kill shot.<eos> I saw you with Lash.<eos> Yeah, I just... I...<eos> You did it right.<eos> Offered a dissenting opinion, but when the time came, you did what I asked.<eos> Well, a slightly less lethal version.
And men may sloped and they didn't even invite me to the wedding.<eos> They didn't even tell me.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm double spitting just thinking about it.<eos> Thought I was finished with them, but they're my baby girls.<eos> But, Florence, have you seen our grandchild? Oh...<eos> I get why they call him Tanner.<eos> He's a little dark.<eos> I think he's a little light.<eos> Hey, what time is it in India?<eos> India?
He's at the store and he's not answering.<eos> All right, just take him to the freezer.<eos> He's not hungry.<eos> I know he's not hungry.<eos> It's just that breathing in the cold air really helps him, so just go, go, go, go.<eos> Let's go the freezer, okay?<eos> You're going to be okay.<eos> You're going to be fine.<eos> Yeah, just breathe this in.<eos> Okay, all right.
Well, not very many people have that kind of courage.<eos> But I, for one, am grateful for those that do, you know, those who stand up for what they believe.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> Are you Pastor Dave? I am.<eos> I'm Martin Yip.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> My friend Josh Wheaton said you might be able to answer my questions about God.<eos> Well, that definitely falls within my job description.<eos> How many questions have you got?<eos> So far, 147.
What part of "God, Country and Corps" do you wanna put on that jury?<eos> What was your last paid position?<eos> Artillery Forward Observer, United States Marine Corps.<eos> Peremptory challenge, Your Honor.<eos> Your Honor, we'd like to challenge for cause.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Your Honor, the man's an ordained minister.<eos> The juror is excused.<eos> Objection, Your Honor.<eos> Basis, Mr. Endler?
I'll look to curtail it in the future.<eos> Redirect, Your Honor?<eos> Ms. Kinney, I understand that you attended a service at Ms. Wesley's church a short while ago.<eos> -Is that correct? -Yes, that's correct.<eos> It was an event honoring several students who attend that church for their community service.<eos> And who was it that invited you to that service?<eos> Grace Wesley.<eos> I see.<eos> And where were you when this invitation was extended?<eos> At my office. On school grounds?
Ms. Thawley, are you willing to testify on your own behalf?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> And do you understand that you will have to answer all the questions truthfully, regardless of your feelings, and that failure to do so is punishable by law?<eos> Yes, Your Honor. I'm not afraid of telling the truth.<eos> I'm only afraid of not being able to tell it.<eos> I will allow this witness.<eos> Objection overruled.<eos> Brooke, in class, who first brought up the name Jesus, you or Ms. Wesley?<eos> I did.<eos> As part of a question?
- I got caught short.<eos> The beer, you know.<eos> It comes to us all, pet.<eos> Knocked me for six, I don't mind telling you.<eos> Do you recognise the lass?<eos> Well...she'd been into the pub a few times.<eos> - Local, then?<eos> - Aye. She was staying at the Carswell house.<eos> Big one.<eos> Top of the hill.
Sorry.<eos> Doesn't ring any bells?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> He'd been stabbed, we believe sometime yesterday evening.<eos> And there's us sitting out drinking.<eos> What about the other people you had over?<eos> Might they recognise him?<eos> Well, that lot's mostly old mates from Midlebrowm.<eos> - I migh ask them, but...<eos> - What about on the lane?
You go to the house. Confront Alex.<eos> It gets heated, as we know it can do.<eos> Martin steps in and there's a nasty, unplanned outcome.<eos> I was nowhere near.<eos> And we found blood on your jeans.<eos> Where's that from?<eos> No idea.<eos> Terrific!<eos> Is that all you've got?<eos> - Lizzie.
Martin Neilson gets a job as a charity volunteer.<eos> He finds out that Shirley Hewarth is embezzling funds. And he blackmails her for access to restricted information.<eos> Personal details of other offenders.<eos> She gets him the sack and two weeks later he's dead.<eos> Now, what's so special about these former inmates?<eos> Where did they all serve their time?<eos> All over.<eos> Barlinnie, Strangeways.<eos> Juvenile detention centres?<eos> Farnworth?
She gets him the sack and two weeks later he's dead.<eos> Now, what's so special about these former inmates?<eos> Where did they all serve their time?<eos> All over.<eos> Barlinnie, Strangeways.<eos> Juvenile detention centres?<eos> Farnworth?<eos> They all served time there.<eos> The same Young Offenders as Martin.<eos> Different dates, different years.
A volatile ex-offender with a grudge.<eos> He flew at me.<eos> Totally unprovoked.<eos> I mean, look at you.<eos> You're fit.<eos> You're twice as strong as that man.<eos> You could've overpowered him easily.<eos> But you wanted to silence him.<eos> So you took a knife from your pocket... ..and you stabbed him.<eos> Self-defence.
He'd stayed at my aunt's for a bit.<eos> Then he'd been dossing down here.<eos> They offer you a bed if you need it.<eos> I'll talk to the chaplain.<eos> See what he's got to say.<eos> So... why did neither of you put him up?<eos> He said he didn't want to be a burden.<eos> He was proud, you know.<eos> Where were the pair of you on Saturday night into Sunday morning?<eos> At home.
- I'm sorry. I can't overlook an incident with a weapon.<eos> I promise I'll keep an eye on him.<eos> He's not himself.<eos> He's not slept for 24 hours.<eos> All right. I'll put this down to mitigating circumstances.<eos> Now, get him out of my sight before I change my mind.<eos> Go and wait in the car.<eos> Just leave it, Lee!<eos> - Is he right though?<eos> - What?
He got you that job at the cafe.<eos> One of the girls said he could help.<eos> - That's good of him.<eos> - He knew the manager.<eos> They were looking for staff.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I saw him once in a while in the cafe.<eos> - I tried my best to avoid him.<eos> - Why's that then?<eos> Not in front of my son.
I think our boat's just come in.<eos> Trawler approaching the harbor.<eos> We've got a van on the quay, ma'am.<eos> We can see it.<eos> Hello.<eos> Didn't expect to see you here.<eos> Moonlighting, are we?<eos> I'm just picking up a catch.<eos> Ah, Sr. Quinn. I have here a warrant to search your vessel.<eos> On what grounds?
I didn't even know they were on the boat.<eos> Slipped aboard while your back was turned, did they?<eos> You must have had contacts.<eos> Slick operation.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Human trafficking.<eos> Does that spell it out for you?<eos> Look, I brought in some dodgy fags.<eos> But smuggling people?<eos> Not in a million years.
Smells lovely.<eos> - Down the end.<eos> - Fish and chips.<eos> Making me feel hungry.<eos> You're not allowed to speak to us without me brief.<eos> Hey, it's not you I want.<eos> No, it's Steve.<eos> I need to talk to you again about the night your dad died.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Well, the fight. - In town.
- I didn't kill Tommy. - No?<eos> Even though I felt like it.<eos> He was trying to sell the trawler.<eos> Said he wanted to pay off a debt or something.<eos> He said... He said he was going to keep his share and I could split the rest with the boys.<eos> And you didn't think to mention it?<eos> It never happened.<eos> Why would I tell you about something that never happen.<eos> He was supposed to go to the broker's but he never turned up.<eos> Yeah, all right, all right.

- How?<eos> Caleb already started a narrative about you being bullied on social media.<eos> If this comes up, it'll already be diffused.<eos> You are not a liability, Spencer.<eos> You're my daughter.<eos> I was in class when Mom called the school.<eos> Human anatomy.<eos> Everything we went through in high school...<eos> I thought we were done with disasters.<eos> The next semester...
Resolve. How refreshing.<eos> There are no secrets here.<eos> The Khan knows he's been challenged.<eos> Byamba delivered the message himself, like a good son would.<eos> And returned with the Khan's acceptance of this challenge.<eos> We heard about the heads.<eos> Very Kublai of him.<eos> You're concerned about Nayan's absence from our side this week.<eos> - He is the Khan's uncle.<eos> - Loyal uncle.
And they will find us.<eos> If I die... will you forgive my offenses?<eos> -Stop it.<eos> You're not dying.<eos> -I'm going to.<eos> We're all going to.<eos> When, where, and how, now they are the questions.<eos> - Covered in opium and sweat, maybe.<eos> Good way to go.<eos> But not in a place like this.
Some certain thing.<eos> He rests in the Blue Sky now.<eos> May I ask how you knew my husband?<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I am Bolormaa.<eos> I am Nergüi.<eos> Do you work in the stables? No.<eos> But I pass them frequently.<eos> I didn't know your husband well... but you could tell he was kind.<eos> By his eyes.

You were exceptional.<eos> And suddenly, just like that, you remember having me in your class.<eos> I always remembered.<eos> I just enjoyed taking you down a peg or two.<eos> And why tell me now?<eos> Because I cannot for the life of me reconcile that cocksure student I remember with a man who believes he doesn't have what it takes to save Ms. Saunders' life.<eos> Who did you lose, Raymond?<eos> My fiancée, Anna Loring.<eos> She was killed two years ago in a Starling City siege.<eos> Right in front of me.
I came down for a glass of water.<eos> I'm Leo.<eos> Are you friends with my daddy?<eos> Kind of.<eos> I think my daddy's sleeping.<eos> Can I tell you something, Leo?<eos> It's important.<eos> Don't ever let anyone hurt you.<eos> Ever.<eos> Not here... and especially... not here.
Why don't you go on up to bed?<eos> Go on.<eos> Talk fast, or you take a bullet.<eos> What're you doing in my home?<eos> A favor for you.<eos> Watch it.<eos> Relax.<eos> How the hell did you get...<eos> Two days from now, you try to steal this and you get arrested, and you spend five years<eos> - in Iron Heights.
Sultan Ali Khan... will face 10 wrestlers inside the 50-yard mud pit... and aim to reach the green ﬂag.<eos> Can he break this record?<eos> We are here to see this feat.<eos> If he wins the title... the Wrestling Federation will present Sultan an Escort's tractor<eos> See those women, Varun?<eos> I guess they have sacrificed their daily soaps... to catch a glimpse of Sultan's heroics.<eos> You are the son of the soil<eos> You are the son of the soil Between the realms of heaven and earth<eos> Lingers your magnificent soul<eos> O Sultan
Why?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Not want... I know it's a boy.<eos> I've thought of a name.<eos> With so much violence in the world these days... I thought of calling him Aman, peace.<eos> When he smiles, he'll make everyone smile.<eos> Here, eat.<eos> But what's the doctor say?<eos> When is it due?<eos> Anytime next week.
Well done, Prem.<eos> Tackle him!<eos> Get up!<eos> Well done, Prem.<eos> Pull him!<eos> Get up, Prem.<eos> You are the son of the soil<eos> Between the realms of heaven and earth<eos> Lingers your magnificent soul<eos> O Sultan
Dead person.<eos> Did he cry all night?<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> He's down and out.<eos> He'll get killed in that ring.<eos> I gave up wrestling... but I never gave up fighting.<eos> I am alive.<eos> What do they say in English? Alive and kicking!<eos> OK?<eos> Master.
Good lung capacity?<eos> He's passed out.<eos> He doesn't give up easily.<eos> Get water!<eos> He's ready to die.<eos> Sultan, slip, duck!<eos> You are the son of the soil<eos> Between the realms of heaven and earth<eos> Lingers your magnificent soul<eos> O Sultan
Stay just the way you are<eos> I roamed the world, there is none like you<eos> Sultan, the wrestler known for his unique moves in the ring... is now gaining popularity for something most unusual.<eos> A romantic song sung by him 'Jag Ghoomeya' is breaking the Internet.<eos> His fans have a new name for him, Romeo-Wrestler!<eos> With kindness of fortune and feats of valour<eos> Riding the waves of joy and sorrow<eos> I will keep you with me<eos> I will keep you with me, forever<eos> In the world of my dreams and hopes
- Yes.<eos> - Good.<eos> We've come far then.<eos> What they call in English, the underdog?<eos> Come on!<eos> Last fight.<eos> You are the son of the soil<eos> Between the realms of heaven and earth<eos> Lingers your magnificent soul<eos> O Sultan
Do you favor growing old to one day teach your ugly inbred children your grotesque manners?<eos> Lay hands on him... that'll be your end.<eos> That desert is three days across.<eos> That is, if our horses survive.<eos> - They die, we die.<eos> - That won't happen.<eos> Let me tell you something about life out here.<eos> There is no mercy, anywhere.<eos> Look around... none.<eos> Not in the land and not in me.
You're under arrest for kidnapping and child endangerment.<eos> Okay, what part about, "Let me out before we get here" did you have a hard time understanding?<eos> You don't want to drive to work with the boss in his new, totally unearned, utterly gauche, and offensive British sports car?<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Hey, come on.<eos> We run the mother ship of this network.<eos> I'm saying you got to own it. Stake your flag.<eos> Don't do this again.<eos> Riding to work with the boss.<eos> Only four episodes deep.
I kind of like this bunking together.<eos> If you want me to find somewhere else to work...<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> What is this?<eos> Not nothing.<eos> Holy shit, Rachel.<eos> Where did you find this?<eos> I found that in the camera truck.<eos> In the camera...
You've worked so hard...<eos> MENSA at 16, Phi Beta Kappa for this?<eos> - None of that's changed.<eos> - It's all changed.<eos> Whenever someone Googles you now, the first thing that'll come up is this show.<eos> Daddy, I came on this show to have a wider platform for what we're trying to say.<eos> Then how did you end up here?<eos> I fell in love.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Love after four weeks on a reality show?
We have a runaway bride.<eos> This is live television.<eos> You've got to fix this.<eos> I want your full support moving forward. Anything.<eos> I'm about to lose my job.<eos> We won.<eos> We're gonna be kings this year, Goldie.<eos> Kings! Right? Money, dick, power.<eos> - Love it. - Yes.<eos> In that order.
You rest.<eos> We can talk about all this later, okay?<eos> I'd like that.<eos> So would I.<eos> Rest.<eos> Ladies, hi. How are you?<eos> There you go. You look thirsty.<eos> That's number three, and I feel great.<eos> A drink, huh?<eos> All right.
How is she?<eos> Who?<eos> - Who do you think?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> If you're talking about Rachel, she's fine.<eos> Why wouldn't she be?<eos> You think she can't function without you?<eos> Oh, and you think you're Mr. Inside Track?<eos> She hasn't told you a thing, has she?<eos> About what?
Who?<eos> - Who do you think?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> If you're talking about Rachel, she's fine.<eos> Why wouldn't she be?<eos> You think she can't function without you?<eos> Oh, and you think you're Mr. Inside Track?<eos> She hasn't told you a thing, has she?<eos> About what?<eos> Jeremy!
He has so much pressure and expectation surrounding him all the time.<eos> It's scary.<eos> Yeah. Keep telling yourself that.<eos> Um, I think he's probably just scared of all the STDs that are probably floating around in that pretty little mouth.<eos> I don't have any STDs.<eos> What the hell is she talking about?<eos> She's saying that she...<eos> Yeah, I heard, Dan. Thank you.<eos> Maybe he just doesn't want his cousin's sloppy seconds?<eos> - W-whoa.
Get that camera off! - Cameras off! Come on, now!<eos> - What do you mean "no"?<eos> You and me, we need to have a different kind of conversation right about now.<eos> - Not right now, Daddy.<eos> - You're carrying my baby.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - You're saying it's not mine?<eos> I'm saying that I don't know whose baby it is.<eos> Beth Ann, whose baby could it be? !<eos> Oh, hell, no! No.
We call the cops all the time because... I mean, didn't we call the cops when you were here?<eos> When?<eos> With the football game for Darius?<eos> We called an ambulance.<eos> We called the ambulance.<eos> Right. I mean, same thing. We do it all the time.<eos> There was this other girl... I don't even know the season.<eos> It was like five or six or something.<eos> Some girl's, like, leg got run ov... I don't...<eos> And what about last season?
I didn't think you'd be calling me at this hour with bad news, but I've just heard that Darius is in the palapa with Tiffany, and I think I might be out 60K.<eos> Well, it's not over yet.<eos> And, um, speaking of things that aren't over yet...<eos> Oh, Quinn. I-I mean, what if it's too late?<eos> What if I can't? We can achieve whatever we set our minds to.<eos> We're masters of the universe, gods looking down from Mount Olympus.<eos> The laws of nature simply don't apply.<eos> Thanks for meeting me here.<eos> Yeah. It's late.<eos> Everything okay?
Move it.<eos> Tonight on "Everlasting,"<eos> Darius will make his final choice live on the air.<eos> Okay, now step back, Graham.<eos> This isn't a fricking three-way.<eos> Keep B cam on Tiffany.<eos> I want plenty of snarky eye rolls and that "I just smelled a fart" thing she does with her face.<eos> That. Yes. Perfect.<eos> That's perfect. You're back.<eos> Indeed.
You have no idea.<eos> First I want to say to you, in front of God, in front of everybody, um, I never should've cut you.<eos> It was a huge, huge mistake.<eos> Good for him. Look at that.<eos> Something real is actually happening on "Everlasting."<eos> Hey, Quinn, do you still want me to...<eos> You've always told the truth, Ruby.<eos> That's what I've always loved about you.<eos> So now it's my turn.<eos> - Oh, my God. - Oh, hell, no.
I wasn't gonna say anything until I convinced him to meet with both of us just...<eos> It's okay.<eos> You know, what? It's totally fine.<eos> You could have just pitched him on your own.<eos> It's big deal. - No, no!<eos> - It's fine.<eos> I couldn't. I couldn't.<eos> This... everything we want to do together, all the TV that we want to make... that's... we're a team.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.
Sweetie, we have a few more seconds.<eos> You look amazing.<eos> Here we go. It's not that.<eos> I really have to use the restroom.<eos> She looks distressed. Of mind and body.<eos> We are really about to lose the light.<eos> Can I have that cane back?<eos> - Okay. Yeah, okay.<eos> - Get ready, here we go...<eos> Mostly body.
Dad never believed in Whitehall's Hydra, and we're not gonna start now.<eos> We're staying right here.<eos> They're not asking, Gideon.<eos> Sir? We're home.<eos> You've been holding out on me.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You didn't tell me he was a looker.<eos> I don't know what I expected, but... Tall and handsome were certainly not at the top of the list. Wait.<eos> Who-- who-- who are you talking about?<eos> Our guest.
We're walking towards a common goal.<eos> That's what they tell you when you join a cult, but it's actually not true.<eos> Eventually, you'll get it.<eos> We see such great potential for humanity.<eos> Those who are worthy will inherit a better world.<eos> And those who aren't?<eos> We're nearing Dutch air space.<eos> Looks like we're gonna find out what you and Malick are hiding whether you help us or not.<eos> So, you kept it.<eos> After all these years.
You can't-- you can't just show me Mr. perfect all the time and keep all the ugly parts hidden away.<eos> That's not how this works.<eos> I need the truth, or whatever we are ends now.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know how we've, um, talked about how most Inhumans have this feeling where nothing feels right, just empty?<eos> Yeah, like how I spent my entire life searching for my parents.<eos> It's a classic attempt to fill the void.<eos> Well, I tried to fill it with vodka, but I couldn't control it-- the drinking or my temper.<eos> You've told me this.<eos> Not this.
Finish the formula, and these little games of ours can stop.<eos> - You'll never trick me into giving up my research.<eos> And since you also cannot kill me And destroy any hope of creating a soviet firestorm, I would like a hot shower<eos> And a change of clothes. - And I thought I gave a good speech.<eos> - I'm sorry. Have we met?<eos> - 11 years ago, You bought a nuclear warhead off me in norway.<eos> And then you and your time-traveling friends Tried to kill me.<eos> Just like me, you haven't aged a day.<eos> - I have a good hairdresser.<eos> - [chuckles]
- And I don't got to be firestorm To be a part of this team.<eos> - Look, I am not prepared to risk anyone else.<eos> Ever since-- - carter?<eos> His death wasn't your fault.<eos> But stein's will be.<eos> - All I got to do is touch him,<eos> And we can fly out of there.<eos> - Yeah, once you've scaled a 50-foot fence Topped with razor wire, gotten past eight sharpshooters,<eos> And entered a gulag full of the most dangerous criminals<eos> In the u.S.S.R.
No. Sorry.<eos> Anything more from Mrs. Abbott?<eos> She was asking after an order book, some sort of carbon pad he used for work.<eos> Forensics didn't pick up anything like that, did they?<eos> Not so far as I know.<eos> "Mucky Beth".<eos> "Moaning Becomes Electra".<eos> Good grief!<eos> "Hedda Gobbler".<eos> Only In Oxford.
Have you just moved to the area?<eos> I've been here a while.<eos> Yes, I've been here a while, too.<eos> I'm in a pokey little basement flat right now.<eos> What brought you to Oxford?<eos> I just wanted to travel.<eos> Me and a girlfriend got as far as Oxford. The money ran out.<eos> I got a job.<eos> - Doing what?<eos> - Just factory work.
You've got one hour. Or one of this lot gets it.<eos> Your choice.<eos> Cole? Cole!<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Get 'em locked up downstairs. - On your feet!<eos> - You're the manager, right?<eos> Are there any other ways out of here?<eos> There's a rear entrance.<eos> No, no, no. They'll have that covered.<eos> What about downstairs?
Mrs. Thursday, please try not to worry.<eos> Fred, what did he mean, "With the way things are"?<eos> Mrs. Thursday. Inspector.<eos> There's no story, Miss Frazil. Not today.<eos> I know. I know. I just thought we could have a cup of tea.<eos> There's nothing on the record today, Inspector. I'd just like to help. - Legenda não traduzida -<eos> I wouldn't mind a cup of tea, Fred.<eos> I'll be at the station with Mr. Bright.<eos> I won't be long.<eos> All right?
Here.<eos> For the nerves.<eos> Keep the pack.<eos> Stick 'em behind your notebook, then nobody will know.<eos> Thanks.<eos> A tip my old guv'nor gave me.<eos> Sergeant Vimes.<eos> Cable Street.<eos> No pasaran.<eos> All right?
She had a phone call - last night.<eos> It's just come to me. The caretaker came and got her from class.<eos> - What time was this?<eos> - About half-seven, eight.<eos> Anything on this missing person?<eos> Morse is looking into it, sir.<eos> But I've been thinking...<eos> Sandra Jordan.<eos> Before your time.<eos> June '63.
If you want to be with it, it's got to be lager.<eos> Is that what they swill up at division?<eos> Or down the lodge?<eos> Thought Jakes was bad with that muck.<eos> I know that's how you think I got it.<eos> I didn't mean...<eos> Well, maybe that's part of it.<eos> It's nothing you couldn't do.<eos> Rank's not about brains. It's about playing the game.<eos> Or not, in your case.
It backs onto Wytham and Mrs. Parr's cottage is a stone's throw away.<eos> And given the state of Dr. Moxem's camp...<eos> Beast of Binsey, maybe?<eos> Come on. That was doing the rounds when I was up.<eos> Beast of what was it?<eos> Beast of Binsey, sir.<eos> It's a local legend amongst the County boys.<eos> Sheep savaged, else disappeared.<eos> It's usually on a full moon.<eos> Or a full bladder.
Are there any wild animals at Crevecoeur now?<eos> No.<eos> My parents liked to keep one or two cubs about the place - when we were young.<eos> - What sort of cubs?<eos> Lion, tiger, cheetah.<eos> A panther once.<eos> They were all reintroduced into the wild a long time ago.<eos> What's all this?<eos> There's been some sort of accident.<eos> Up in the woods.
All right, well, let's close it out.<eos> God, grant me... the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change things I can't, and the wisdom to know the difference.<eos> Hey, Dan. We got a problem.<eos> Problem?<eos> With the big order last week. The one you filled.<eos> But I always recheck my orders.<eos> I don't know what happened. I just know it was wrong.<eos> They're sending back the whole order, on us.<eos> Well, y-you could cross-reference that and check whether it was their error or ours.<eos> To what end?
You know how to get in there.<eos> You've stolen from that room before.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That was different.<eos> - No. That was exactly the same.<eos> From the moment Hive popped up on our radar, you suddenly knew where to find this and had your hands on it until our distress call diverted you to Malick's base.<eos> Exactly.<eos> That was before any of this could have been exposed to Hive!<eos> - Was it? - Transia.<eos> The rooftop.
I miss you.<eos> I miss you too.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you worried about his book?<eos> Those are words.<eos> Who cares about the stuff he makes up?<eos> Why don't you ask him for the truth about the night Charlotte was killed?<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Timer.<eos> On my phone.
- It's not gonna happen, Grey.<eos> - Why?<eos> What do you mean, why?<eos> You're the prime suspect in her father's murder.<eos> I need her help to get me out of it.<eos> Time is running out for me.<eos> Like it was running out for poor Freddie.<eos> Either she helps me get out of here or they're gonna catch me.<eos> And I will not keep my mouth shut.<eos> All right?
I nearly lost my life trying to catch Grey last night.<eos> Recklessness won't win you any points.<eos> - D.I. Clayton, if you can't, or won't... find Grey,<eos> Orwell will.<eos> Orwell?<eos> He couldn't find his face in a mirror.<eos> Scrap everything you heard.<eos> I want to keep it tight.<eos> I want you to start here, set a radius and just sweep.<eos> Alright?
You're gonna see Ben.<eos> - He said he needed rest.<eos> - Yeah, that was in front of me.<eos> Go and... tuck him in.<eos> I can't believe I'm getting advice on my personal life from Harry,<eos> "Lose my house in a card game", Clayton.<eos> Right...<eos> I'll see you tomorrow morning at Waterloo then.<eos> Alright.<eos> Just after eight, OK?
Which must be a complete nightmare for a maniac like you.<eos> But who will take my place?<eos> I think it's me that's taking your place.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> No way!<eos> When did he make you SIU on this?<eos> Why?<eos> They want me to know where I stand.<eos> Which is?<eos> On quick sand.
Yes. Exactly.<eos> He's scared, Harry.<eos> I don't know how, but whatever deal he struck, out there, about confessing to all this, it's not working out for him.<eos> What you're gonna do?<eos> Represent him the best way I can.<eos> Oh, Jesus!<eos> Look, I'm not happy with you being involved in this one.<eos> I know!<eos> But I'm a big girl, Harry.<eos> Right, bye then!
Really?<eos> I thought you must have met him.<eos> We're here about Kate Olsen.<eos> She went missing two nights ago.<eos> Really?<eos> You met with her that night.<eos> What did she want to talk to you about?<eos> Kate Olsen was obsessed with my father and his business, to an almost pathological degree!<eos> She wanted to speak to me about the same thing that she always did.<eos> Probability.
And when will he be here?<eos> He should be here just before lunch.<eos> Is there anything you or your daughter don't eat?<eos> I'm a gluten-free lactose-intolerant vegan.<eos> She's 11.<eos> Hum, I've been trying to get a signal since we got here.<eos> Oh, sorry. It's pretty crap round here.<eos> Really?<eos> In Hampstead?<eos> What about out there, in the garden?
The man's origin is not pertinent, Mr. Teague.<eos> You're right about one thing, however.<eos> I shall be closing this dock for investigation.<eos> As for who works and profits, well, that is not my lookout.<eos> Sergeant, see this dockside picked and cleared for evidence.<eos> The murdered man to be untangled, careful like, and conveyed to our deadroom.<eos> You understand? And for yourself?<eos> There's no time.<eos> I've go to drag our surgeon from his pit.<eos> All right.
In two days time, we are told.<eos> Yeah, I can do math, Drake.<eos> And yet you still make no plans to visit.<eos> Visit whom?<eos> Your wife, she who languishes in Newgate these three years, she who'll soon no longer be your wife<eos> - on account of the fact she will be...<eos> - No, Drake. No plans.<eos> No surprises.<eos> Do you understand, Inspector?<eos> This week of all weeks.
Do you deny it?<eos> Would such denial be plausible to you, Inspector?<eos> Why don't you try me?<eos> Each night, they wipe it clean.<eos> It is not permitted, they say.<eos> But what can they do to me that is not already done?<eos> I keep the image of it here, retranscribe each day and continue on.<eos> You once told me the language of the universe was written in numbers.<eos> Now it seems you seek numbers within language,<eos> Hebrew, your language, - your writing system.
You need to weigh the cargo down, Roy, and let your tide help you through.<eos> Nate here knows how.<eos> I showed him. Yeah.<eos> You are going deep, my friend, out into the estuary, the black river mouth,<eos> the belly of the seas beyond.<eos> You're the husband, are you not?<eos> I am, Doctor.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> Have you, er... you found the wherewithal?<eos> Of a kind.
But you got to know the name of the next guy or it doesn't work.<eos> And that guy's got to know the name of the next guy.<eos> See, I'm not asking the world of you.<eos> All I need from you is the name of the man on the other side of that river.<eos> See, and then, I'm gonna have a conversation with him, and we can start this all over again.<eos> Well, look who's back on the hunt.<eos> How's your ma, kid?<eos> Ever since I've been spending time with this gal over in Charleston, it's been itching.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Down there.
I heard them drivers talking... No, I ain't spending no more time on a dead man.<eos> That undertaker told me where the next station is.<eos> He tell you?<eos> Be a real shame you go and and cross that river, only to get caught.<eos> 'Cause you ain't got no place to hide.<eos> I can make it. Tell me, house girl.<eos> I ain't going nowhere without Noah.<eos> What's this plan of yours?<eos> Where's the last place catchers be looking for runaways?<eos> In a big house.
What did you do with the money?<eos> What?<eos> The money you won at the Green Dragon casino the night Freddie Lau died.<eos> The money you won with this woman, Eve, at a fixed roulette table.<eos> Suri,<eos> I didn't win at a fixed table.<eos> You won 70,000 - two consecutive maximums, on 2 spins of the wheel.<eos> I burnt it.<eos> West 13.<eos> On duty.
His mother came in this morning.<eos> Said she'd listed him as a missing person 14 months ago, but we've only just identified him from his dental records.<eos> The building he was found in had been sealed off for the last 6 months.<eos> I think he was moved there recently.<eos> Just in time to be blown up.<eos> The decomposition has actually been interrupted.<eos> I think he was moved from a predominantly clay soil shallow grave.<eos> There are still samples of the soil on and inside his body.<eos> Most of the vital organs have had large chunks removed- the rats probably, but... the left kidney is completely missing.<eos> Completely?
Our forensics team have been pulled out of the demolition site.<eos> What?<eos> Part of the demolition has to go ahead as planned, no further delays.<eos> Winter's just rolled over.<eos> I'm going back there for another look.<eos> You get onto the paper. Find that journalist, Kelly Harrington.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Alright, mate?
We just wanted to say goodnight.<eos> You've been gone for 300 hours.<eos> I know. I work a full-time job now.<eos> You all know that.<eos> I have to be Mommy and Daddy.<eos> I miss your father just as much as anyone.<eos> He's with the angels.<eos> Yes, he's with all the angels.<eos> And he's watching over us.<eos> Every minute, okay?
I'm aware of that. Virginia, still a segregated state.<eos> Regardless of what the federal government says, regardless of what the Supreme Court says, our law is the law.<eos> Your Honor, if I may.<eos> I believe there are special circumstances to be considered.<eos> What would warrant a colored woman attending a white school?<eos> May I approach your bench, sir?<eos> Your Honor... you of all people should understand the importance of being first.<eos> How's that, Mrs. Jackson?<eos> You were the first in your family to serve in the Armed Forces.<eos> U.S. Navy.
Outside of that we risk the capsule's recovery.<eos> We'd like three possible recovery areas.<eos> We can't cover half the damn ocean.<eos> With all due respect, our capsule's being altered daily.<eos> We're orbiting the Earth at what speed now?<eos> Uh... 17,544 miles per hour... at the time the rocket delivers the capsule into low space orbit.<eos> Well, that's one hell of a speeding ticket.<eos> Okay. So we have the vehicle's speed, the launch window... and for argument's sake, the landing zone is the Bahamas.<eos> Should be enough to figure the "Go/No-go"?<eos> Yeah, in theory, sir.
- Huh, that's weird.<eos> Hey, I was actually about to head out to Emma's welcome home party, and I figured maybe I could swing by and we could just caravan over together.<eos> Sounds like a plan.<eos> Is it a bad idea to ask Emma to interview for the podcast tonight?<eos> The welcome home party would make the perfect sound bed.<eos> Noah, that's a horrible idea.<eos> No talking about your podcast or the incident.<eos> Okay, which incident are we not talking about?<eos> All the murder stuff, or what happened to her at school after?<eos> Either. Neither.
You have to.<eos> Change the record in your head.<eos> Play, "He was a bad man.<eos> We did what we had to do and we did it well.<eos> So now it's through."<eos> It's a mantra.<eos> Say it.<eos> "We did what we had to do and we did it well."<eos> You forgot the bad man part.<eos> And the end.
Get the pedo to sign, I'll give you your 50 bucks.<eos> And Oren will go on a date with you.<eos> -I'm not really in--<eos> -Okay!<eos> You are so on.<eos> He will sign and you will give me cash, and I will spend it on a new hemp messenger bag and strawberry lube, because Oren seems like a strawberry kind of guy.<eos> Great, now let's talk one more time about mirroring body language.<eos> I'm just saying, if you bought me a watch, I'd be on the time better.<eos> -There's a clock on the wall.<eos> -Not in my office.
Well, she is to me.<eos> -Mmm. -But not euphemistically.<eos> She's a fan and whenever she sees you, she freaks out.<eos> You've gotta understand.<eos> Institutional racism... traps the most vulnerable people in our society in this cycle of incarceration which, in turn, leads to a cycle of poverty.<eos> It makes someone like you... someone rich and powerful and white, virtually unapproachable.<eos> All right, so now let me get this straight.<eos> Your friend acts like a moron around me because she's black and poor?<eos> -Is that right?<eos> -Basically... yes.
Hey, I'm looking for a firefighter, but I don't know his name.<eos> Regarding?<eos> I was on the Central Ave bridge on Tuesday, he saved my life.<eos> Tuesday, you want the hose pullers.<eos> The what?<eos> Flamers, gay firemen, they're all on one shift.<eos> Really?<eos> Chicago Fire Island.<eos> So when's the next, uh, gay shift?<eos> 7:00 AM tomorrow.
Now, that one's cold.<eos> No.<eos> This one.<eos> ♪ hallelujah ♪<eos> - ♪ yeah ♪ - ♪ this shit legendary ♪ ♪ trip like Jason Terry, pussy pink as Katy Perry ♪ ♪ this shit came from nowhere ♪<eos> Hey, yo, after we get this bike, how about we buy a motherfucking car?<eos> Robes and slippers in the closet.<eos> Toilet's equipped with a heated seat and a bidet.<eos> A bidet, ever use one?<eos> Oh, yeah, my vacation home in the Bahamas.
I'd have to split 'em up.<eos> Debbie and Carl still aren't ready to be on their own, and I got to keep an eye on Ian.<eos> Worst case scenario, I'll just move in with you.<eos> Relax, I was just kidding.<eos> God, you looked like you got stung by a bee.<eos> Oh, I'm just imagining what it would look like, me and you living together.<eos> In a good way, just thinking it through.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> You want anything?<eos> All right.
- Do you have meetings?<eos> - No. The author I'm working with lives around here.<eos> He's against a tight deadline and he's 72.<eos> Isn't that too harsh for an old man?<eos> He gets mad if I don't stop by.<eos> A novelist husband and an editor wife.<eos> Ah, the glamorous life of an urban couple.<eos> Stop.<eos> Rika came the other day and we talked about you.<eos> Me?

Nothing bad.
I would rather kill her than allow my love to die.<eos> Have you considered dying first then?<eos> That wouldn't be right.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> You'll catch a cold.<eos> I knew this would happen.<eos> I'll come home early today.<eos> The storm is a good excuse to leave early.<eos> Shall we go for dinner before the storm?<eos> Okay, 5pm at the station then.
Well, you're young.<eos> You must be frustrated, stuck in the same place for days.<eos> That guy, the one with you, what does he do?<eos> Can you tell me where we should go?<eos> Wait here.<eos> Please go.<eos> Pull over...here.<eos> Were you dreaming?<eos> Yes.<eos> What kind of dream?
Yes?<eos> I don't need you to advise me on my work.<eos> What were you doing with him?<eos> What?<eos> With who?<eos> Sahara.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> We were just talking.<eos> About what?
Are you sure about that?<eos> So this is what's going to happen now.<eos> I'm going to take these plates, I'm going to put them in one bag.<eos> And then I'm going to take your bodies, what's left of them, and I'm going to put them in another.<eos> You'll get no fight from us today.<eos> No, we work for you, now.<eos> We're Pack, all the way.<eos> 100%.<eos> You just tell us what you want us to do.<eos> Good.
I haven't really had time to read what you brought.<eos> Well I think this one is particularly helpful.<eos> Are you giving him tummy time?<eos> You need to promote those neck and core muscles.<eos> We're okay, Nick.<eos> I don't need a book to tell me how to do this.<eos> My postcards.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Figured Bali was okay for now.<eos> For now.
No, the tannery's going to be hard enough on our sense of smell.<eos> Very smart of Escobado positioning himself in a building that reeks of boiled cow hide.<eos> Go and finish your task, Clay.<eos> Well, we can't kill him yet, the information might be false.<eos> I didn't say kill him, I said finish the task.<eos> To keep my Pack safe, they need to fear me.<eos> We need to send a message, it has to be done.<eos> Southpaw sends a message, I mean, he'll never use his right hand again.<eos> Look, if he's lying, I'll kill him when we get back.<eos> Okay, Clayton.
And, you would have met with us in private?<eos> No.<eos> But instead you involve a human who knows everything about us.<eos> Who blackmailed me into this conversation.<eos> My God!<eos> Look at you, it really is you.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Calling my family, they need to know about this,<eos> - about her.
I'm going to need some alone time.<eos> Oh, sure, yeah.<eos> Maybe I'll see you...<eos> Later.<eos> It's a lot of photos.<eos> My uncle's big on family, even the ones he's hit.<eos> His Holiness is expecting us.<eos> Get the hell in here.<eos> It's all over the news.<eos> Every channel.
The abyss, the place where you don't care anymore.<eos> Where all hope dies.<eos> We're done here.<eos> You're off the case.<eos> No!<eos> This isn't over.<eos> You can't dismiss me with some metaphysical BS.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> - I told you.<eos> - Uh-uh.
So, 11:00, Friday night, friend?<eos> Starting Saturday morning, I'll be rich.<eos> Just trying to imagine that, my life, completely changed.<eos> Nothing will be the same...<eos> Not ever again.<eos> She'll never walk again.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Some woman found Ms. Gordon, name of Colleen Miles.<eos> She found the, uh, victim in a state of undress.<eos> Undress?
Our father has come home.<eos> Their God is dead or lost in senile slumber, but not ours.<eos> Our god, their Devil, is alive, awake, and now, finally... he's here.<eos> Why do you not kneel, good mother?<eos> What tribe of witches is so exalted that they will not bend the knee before me?<eos> The Essex witches, my Lord.<eos> It is we Essex who brought you forth to walk the earth again.<eos> 'Twas my mother, Mary... of blessed memory.<eos> Yes, Mary Sibley... the most powerful witch we Essex ever produced.<eos> Indeed.
That will be your only warning.<eos> They built a wall around Eden, too, and it done no good.<eos> Serpent was already inside.<eos> So true.<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> Just worrying about your reputation, sir.<eos> My reputation?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know what a true man of the people you are.<eos> Indeed.
Relying on the sluggish bloodstream to deliver an impure compound?<eos> Little wonder your patient suffered vestigial memories of the trauma you inflicted.<eos> I've developed a superior method... to purify the serum... prolong its effectiveness.<eos> How long?<eos> Permanently.<eos> You will be cured.<eos> We'll see, won't we, old sport?<eos> What's the method?<eos> I'm going to inject an electrified dosage into the prefrontal cortex of your brain.<eos> All right.
No.<eos> That'll be all, Doctor, thank you.<eos> You will have no memory of this.<eos> Not of this treatment, nor of your crimes, nor of your sins, nor of your time in this horrid place.<eos> Every moment that has benighted your life and set you on your dark course...<eos> I will take from you.<eos> You will re-enter this world... an innocent lamb.<eos> After all... it is our memories which make us monsters... is it not?<eos> How'd you lose your arm?<eos> In battle.
Or I will send you to hell myself.<eos> I'm done repenting...<eos> And I belong in hell.<eos> Sir.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Someone's here to see you.<eos> Mr. Talbot.<eos> You're Ethan's father.<eos> That's right.<eos> Then under the joint authority of Her Majesty the Queen of England
Are you familiar with the name Dracula?<eos> There was a medieval warrior clan of sorts, the Dracule.<eos> The line can be traced back to antiquity.<eos> Perhaps further.<eos> Dracula was said to be their founder.<eos> The name means "dragon" in Romanian.<eos> It suits him.<eos> More than you know.<eos> In the 13th century he provoked a war between two great empires.<eos> The Ottomans and the Holy Romans.
I'm being hunted by him.<eos> If Dracula wanted you dead, you would be.<eos> He doesn't want my death.<eos> He wants my submission.<eos> You seem to be a woman who understands why submission to another would be intolerable. That I do.<eos> Even if you have to cheat.<eos> Every chance I get.<eos> Then help me.<eos> We'll cheat him together.<eos> All right.
And I will not leave your side.<eos> Every time I've given my heart, it has led to catastrophe.<eos> Then let catastrophe befall us both.<eos> Vanessa, I love you for who you are, not who the world wants you to be.<eos> You're, of course, all welcome to eat.<eos> A bit of a gamble, wouldn't you say?<eos> Giving your guests knives?<eos> Somehow I prefer my odds.<eos> That's because you don't understand who's sitting at your table.<eos> Back in the desert.
And yet you have kindness still.<eos> You spared me the sin of patricide.<eos> No man should have to murder a member of his own family.<eos> This I know.<eos> I honestly thought I could do it.<eos> End it with my father in blood.<eos> I am, as you know, no stranger to killing.<eos> Or "night work" as Miss Ives once put it.<eos> The night I met you, in fact.<eos> In the opium house.
Thank you.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> I've been thinking, perhaps we might return to our old home.<eos> I spoke to the landlord and it's available, should we want it.<eos> It's awfully far to go from the factory.<eos> You're not going back to the factory.<eos> There'll be jobs for me after the toll this fog has wrought.<eos> At the docks.

We're doing our best, right? Yeah.<eos> And for the record, I would've told you to knock on the door yourself. Aha.<eos> Built to your specifications, Miss Jenny.<eos> Seven foot high, six wide, two deep.<eos> Solid oak, yew pegs.<eos> We just bought that lumber this morning.<eos> Compared to barn raising, this is child's play.<eos> And time is of the essence.<eos> Yeah, according to accounts I dug up from the spiritualist movement of the 1850s, we need to take advantage of a planetary syzygy.<eos> Syzygy.
Now you'll float free for all eternity.<eos> A lost and silent soul.<eos> Unless you give me what I want.<eos> Tick-tock.<eos> Some kind of wild animal. - Up in the tower.<eos> - Okay, we've got it handled.<eos> Go, go.<eos> The creature.<eos> Follow my lead.<eos> There, on the ledge.
That we would make it out together.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> Oh, thank heavens.<eos> That was strange. That was strange.<eos> I was awake but dreaming.<eos> I was here but-but not here.<eos> In the darkness, lost I heard your voice.<eos> I followed it.<eos> We made it.<eos> Indeed. Indeed.
The Oxford boy.<eos> For mercy's sake, Mr. Crane, if I may be blunt, I have no need for a counterpart.<eos> And the last thing I want is to be responsible for some trigger-happy revolutionary or, in your case, a rebellious bookworm.<eos> I'm quite capable, thank you.<eos> And your roster of former partners suggests I'm to be a moderating influence to you, not the other way around.<eos> The mission for tomorrow night requires a Masonic Code.<eos> I'm quite confident that is why you were called.<eos> Meet me outside the Ridotto Theatre tomorrow evening.<eos> 8:00.<eos> Very good.
I was a different person the last time I was here.<eos> That's how you know about this place, right?<eos> 'Cause I told my S.O.?<eos> You used to drive your van up here to sleep.<eos> You don't just have his face.<eos> You have his memories.<eos> - He was fond of you, Grant Ward.<eos> - And I'm glad he's dead.<eos> He is, too.<eos> In a way.
He had no belt on and he was texting!<eos> You made me drive too fast!<eos> You told me before, there's always a sacrifice.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - It's him or us.<eos> If you call the police, we've had it.<eos> Listen to me, please.<eos> Nobody saw anything, nobody knows anything.<eos> Everything's still the same.<eos> Your life, Sonia, your daughter, your career.
Don't worry.<eos> I'll get mine.<eos> It's the starter system.<eos> The engine sensor's probably stuck on "stop".<eos> If the impact didn't damage anything else, you just reconnect the control module and reset it.<eos> The rest looks alright.<eos> If you want, I can tow it to my house and fix it there.<eos> If you prefer, I'll call a tow truck and tell them where to find you.<eos> - How long would it take?<eos> - The tow truck?
I know you contacted her.<eos> The rich want to stay rich, protect themselves and their property.<eos> Wherever there are rich people, there are surveillance cameras.<eos> How'd you get the police to think Daniel Garrido was on the run?<eos> - Where are you calling from?<eos> - A phone booth.<eos> Talking in a place with so much surveillance isn't very smart.<eos> My nerves gave me away, I know.<eos> But don't think I'm stupid enough to contact Laura right after the police tried to link me to her.<eos> When and why then?
You gonna do it or not?<eos> Uh, he's not really talking to me.<eos> You should get someone else.<eos> Literally anyone else.<eos> Just tell him he was right about the tunnels.<eos> Just tell him that, okay?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> When we were down there looking for you and Hayden, we didn't know it yet, but we were a lot closer than we thought.<eos> There's an Operating Theater down there.<eos> Down in the tunnels.
Mason, what am I supposed to do?<eos> Parrish?<eos> How's he going to get through the mountain ash?<eos> He's burning it right out of the walls.<eos> Okay. You gotta try and stay on your feet.<eos> The plan didn't work out too well.<eos> So I'm gonna need your help, okay?<eos> You had a plan?<eos> Yeah. It was good on paper.<eos> Not too much in reality.
Jordan...<eos> Let him go.<eos> Why?<eos> Because as much as we believe Parrish could take on the Beast... neither of us think he's our only hope at stopping it.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> We think there's another.<eos> You.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> The desk, the desk!<eos> Okay, okay.
Is it bad?<eos> - No.<eos> - Very.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> What do you guys usually do when this happens?<eos> Oh, I usually pass out.<eos> And I think I still might do that.<eos> Stiles!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Okay.
But the hunting party leaves at dawn.<eos> Why didn't he warn her?<eos> He told her about everything that they'd seen during the war.<eos> But like I said,<eos> Marie-Jeanne was a skeptic.<eos> You believe it?<eos> I never knew you were so superstitious.<eos> I don't need to believe in something I saw with my own eyes.<eos> And I've been through every inch of these woods and hunted just about every creature under the sun.<eos> But not the moon.
It can't be me.<eos> After we left the bus, I lost you at the game.<eos> Remember?<eos> Where did you go?<eos> I went to...<eos> I was...<eos> All those times you said the Beast showed up? Everything you said about frequencies.<eos> Where were you all those times?<eos> The night at the transmission towers...<eos> The observatory downtown...

They've been doing it for decades.<eos> Actually, probably longer.<eos> How old are these guys?<eos> Who knows.<eos> But wherever they go, he goes, too.<eos> So how do we find him?<eos> Keeping him alive requires a pretty unique set of conditions.<eos> There's got to be a power source.<eos> It has to be underground...<eos> And on a telluric current.
So there's one thing I wanted to mention.<eos> Mm, I heard, Sheriff, that our colleague's son was sold some Moonshine from the Farrell clan.<eos> Did you know that young man was number two in his class?<eos> It is just so, so sad.<eos> Farrell wine, I think they called it.<eos> I can't really discuss that. Oh, no.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I just thought you might wanna know in terms of what it might mean regarding public perception.<eos> - Perception of...<eos> - You.
What? What you laughing about?<eos> I just realized that you probably don't even watch TV.<eos> You don't even know who Katy Perry is.<eos> The only thing I know about her is that she ain't half as pretty as you.<eos> Thanks for walking me home.<eos> Hey, can I take you on a date?<eos> Fa.<eos> What you want?<eos> To talk to you.<eos> 'Bout?

Oh, Iris'll cook.<eos> Dad, we just met the kid. We don't want to kill him.<eos> All right, we do takeout. Chinese. Whatever.<eos> Where are your cuffs, taillights?<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> You know that kid?<eos> Uh, no... no.<eos> You know, it's just what they say. I got one of those faces.<eos> I'll see you guys at dinner.<eos> Uh, okay.
- Okay, interesting.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, I just, you know, I can't get enough of art.<eos> Anyway, there's this event at the Central City Museum tonight.<eos> They're showing this really famous painting that I've always loved.<eos> Actually, I don't know anything about art, but what's the saying?<eos> I know what I like, and I like you, so count me in.<eos> All right, great. I'll see you at 8:00.<eos> - 7:00!<eos> - Or 7:00.

Thank you, Cisco.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> Cool. I'm gonna do this...<eos> I'm gonna tell her.<eos> Don't tell her.<eos> You care for this woman.<eos> Then keep her as far away from this as possible.<eos> And here's why.<eos> If Zoom finds out who you care for, who you love, who you live for, he'll take them from you.<eos> All right.
This is a trap?<eos> I'm slow... not stupid.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I got it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Your pupils are normal. Your heart rate's a little low. But other than that, no concussive symptoms.<eos> I really do feel fine.<eos> What about Turtle?<eos> - No sign of him.<eos> - Or the painting.
Four point nine.<eos> I didn't even know it went that high.<eos> I'm stuck at 2.7.<eos> Hey, look, you work two jobs.<eos> And dying didn't exactly help your GPA.<eos> So, I don't know, all you need is just a little help.<eos> You're doing this for me.<eos> Are you mad?<eos> Furious.<eos> Okay.
Just kidnap her.<eos> Do not kidnap her.<eos> We'll be back tonight after we talk to Stilinski's dad.<eos> Do we really have to do this?<eos> He's our only lead.<eos> Okay. What if the Ghost Riders show up?<eos> Then you'll handle it, Liam.<eos> And look, you're not alone.<eos> You've got Mason and Corey and Hayden.<eos> Okay?
Liam, it's a Ghost Rider.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Headed for the kitchen.<eos> Right there.<eos> Everybody out. Now!<eos> Denise Novak. Found at a campsite, the back of her head cracked open.<eos> The size and bite pattern appear to match.<eos> Seems fair to assume that whoever took a bite out of Denise did the same to Mazzara.<eos> It's odd.<eos> Even for Beacon Hills.
We take everyone into the argent bunker. It's underground.<eos> Everyone would be safe.<eos> They're here.<eos> Where's gwen?<eos> excuse me.<eos> Sorry, where are we?<eos> We're at the train station.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay. Helpful.<eos> Which train station exactly?
We can't get out of here, stiles. Because this place isn't real.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Beacon hills doesn't have a train station.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Little help, please?<eos> Okay.<eos> What the hell?<eos> No, no, no, keep going.<eos> I don't see you comin' up with anything.<eos> stiles. Left shoulder, against the pillar.
When a coyote smells a fresh kill, its senses are overcome.<eos> The blood drives it crazy.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's pretty deep.<eos> I'm trying not to damage...<eos> Here's your bullet back.<eos> You don't have to follow me around everywhere.<eos> I'm just trying to keep you safe.<eos> What? You're gonna sit through all my classes?<eos> And what about after school? What about all night?
Oh, my sweet, sweet son.<eos> I'm dead, all right.<eos> You saw to that.<eos> You died.<eos> I was there.<eos> This doesn't make any sense.<eos> But it's starting to come back to you.<eos> Your spirit is trapped inside the Phoenix Stone.<eos> This really happened, didn't it?<eos> In 1863.
There's a campaign aide in charge of coordinating.<eos> That's probably who you talked to, to schedule.<eos> Yeah. Umm, yes, I did. Yeah.<eos> You know I have to admit I didn't expect you to reach out.<eos> Uh, the town hall was such a success but I guess I just assumed we'd retreat to our own corners.<eos> Umm, well, you know, I really wanted to pick your brain if that's okay.<eos> Uh, this whole daughter- of-the-candidate thing it's so new to me and so...<eos> - Of course.<eos> - You know...<eos> Umm, inside or out?
That she's rebalancing after all the years of neglect.<eos> Wait.<eos> Are you saying that they may let her out?<eos> That's a decision for the court.<eos> Well, I'm not interested in the court.<eos> Charlotte DiLaurentis will walk the streets of Rosewood over my dead body.<eos> I'm calling him back.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where does your dad keep his golf clubs?<eos> In his car.
Save your lies for someone who has time to hear them.<eos> Sabrina, you don't have to do that.<eos> Remember to use as few words as possible when answering his questions.<eos> Yes, no and I don't recall.<eos> That's all that needs to be said.<eos> He's gonna know I'm lying.<eos> It doesn't matter if he can't prove it.<eos> It's okay, you're not in this alone.<eos> Hanna, you're free to go.<eos> At least for now.
Okay, where are you?<eos> You will never guess who just talked to me.<eos> Okay, so I was in line at the bar and some stranger just compliments my shoes and I turn around, it's Claudia Freakin' Greco, Caleb.<eos> And don't pretend like you don't know who she is.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Melissa?<eos> Hello, Hanna.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I live here.<eos> Well, not in this bathroom, but nearby.
No, but at least now I know that Mr. Fitz was more than just your favorite teacher.<eos> Is this why you wanted to stay in Rosewood?<eos> Liam.<eos> Please pick up, pick up.<eos> Please leave a message.<eos> Hey, Liam, it's me again.<eos> Look, I'm so sorry, okay?<eos> Just.... I-I need a chance to explain.<eos> Call me.<eos> Oh, but not after 5:00.
Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> I wanna thank you and the others for staying in town helping with the investigation.<eos> We didn't have much choice.<eos> I know you've all got your own lives, things to do... and staying in Rosewood has got to be a sacrifice.<eos> It certainly is for me.<eos> It's not like we're strangers here.<eos> Hm, no, it's not.<eos> So, what do you think of the old town?<eos> Has it changed much?<eos> In some ways, yes.

- Okay, goodnight.<eos> I should have you that I was gonna talk to Spencer.<eos> I was just afraid that you would try and stop me.<eos> How did it feel, telling her about us?<eos> It helped.<eos> Helped?<eos> It helped me make up my mind about us.<eos> Things are moving very quickly.<eos> I think there's an argument to be made for keeping it the way it is.<eos> For now.
And I was about 20 miles outside of town when... I started to think about all the lies that I've told you.<eos> Everything that I've... talked you into everything that I've talked myself into and it was always for a good cause.<eos> Of course, you thought I would do it.<eos> I made sure of that myself.<eos> So I...<eos> What I'm trying to say is that I... I'm the one that should say sorry.<eos> Well, my parents are getting remarried.<eos> Well, I guess it was worth keeping that secret.<eos> Ezra, where were you?<eos> Albany.

Ezra, where were you?<eos> Albany.<eos> Albany?<eos> The state university there.<eos> Buddy in the English Department and he let me crash.<eos> What's this?<eos> The new book.<eos> The next three chapters.<eos> I would like you to read it before I send it to the publisher.<eos> Alright. Ahem.
- Wait, there's more.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Was it you?<eos> Did you call Charlotte that night from The Two Crows Diner?<eos> Emily, I can't talk about this here.<eos> Get in the car. Get in the car.<eos> I called Charlotte the night she was killed.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I asked her to meet me.<eos> - At the church?
Okay.<eos> Yeah, forget it.<eos> Are you gonna drive the next six hours angry at me?<eos> - Yeah, probably.<eos> - Ezra, don't go like this.<eos> If I don't leave now, I won't make it by nightfall.<eos> - Seriously, don't go like this.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Okay, fine.<eos> - Fine.
Buying him in the gift shop.<eos> Yeah, sometimes things work out.<eos> I really wanna say thank you for last night.<eos> For all the adventures, the museums today even the bull fight.<eos> It was all very...<eos> - Chaotic?<eos> No, it was impromptu.<eos> - Where do you wanna go?<eos> - For dinner?<eos> No, after Madrid.
I'm not playing anything anymore, okay?<eos> No more games.<eos> Then you're gonna be awfully lonely.<eos> Well, so far I kinda like your boss.<eos> Although I can see how she can be a bit daunting.<eos> Jillian has daunt she hasn't even used yet.<eos> What did you guys talk about in the lobby?<eos> That was work related.<eos> She wants me to go through the office, not Liam.<eos> - What else?
I've already started.<eos> I can have it when we need it.<eos> Are you sure you wanna do this?<eos> I wouldn't have thought of it if I wasn't ready to do it.<eos> Look, guys, this isn't a democracy, okay?<eos> We're not taking votes.<eos> This is something that Hanna and I decided to do.<eos> And the only thing that you need to decide is whether or not you're gonna help us.<eos> Nobody here is gonna let you do this by yourself.<eos> Alright.
Oliver, we might have something.<eos> John's brother said Darhk could be found in a place called Stonehaven.<eos> Dig said that lead was a dead end.<eos> That was before we cross referenced the tracker's location and came back with a residential address.<eos> Machin's going after Darhk where he lives.<eos> We're going to roll out.<eos> I thought...you might want to tag along.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> All righty.
So I'll give you a few weeks to spend with yours.<eos> Enjoy your time. What's left of it.<eos> You missed.<eos> On purpose.<eos> I'm disappointed in you.<eos> Are Darhk's wife and daughter in police custody?<eos> They told police they weren't his wife and daughter.<eos> Had fake ID and everything.<eos> Speedy...<eos> You ok?
Hey. Everyone's telling the same story-- guys in black robes fighting each other.<eos> Yeah.<eos> League of Assassins.<eos> They're working on some leadership issues.<eos> Yeah, but how many more people are gonna die before that happens?<eos> Yeah. We're working on it.<eos> You got to work faster.<eos> This is just the beginning. Hey.<eos> I think we need to talk.<eos> About what?
Is that you're gonna be fine.<eos> The cure worked.<eos> No more bloodlust.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go get you into some regular clothes.<eos> Yeah. Um... Oliver, you did it, man.<eos> Thea's fine, and Nyssa and Merlyn didn't have to die.<eos> Ooh, yeah. Not to be the buzzkill, but when are we gonna tell Thea about Malcolm's mmmrrr?<eos> Baby steps.<eos> Right.
The pepper came from the garden.<eos> The garden grows strong even in your absence.<eos> Please try a bite.<eos> Quickly.<eos> We must--<eos> The mountain will be ours by morning.<eos> We must act quickly.<eos> The Usurper will return, and with him, his followers.<eos> Has the Lotus been found?<eos> In Kyushu.
How is it that you always manage to blame yourself for everything?<eos> That's his super power.<eos> Guilt Arrow.<eos> Did our thief steal anything else from Amertek?<eos> A network mapper.<eos> A piece of tech designed to scan all nearby digital infrastructure for potential vulnerabilities.<eos> Do we think it's his last score? We better hope that it is.<eos> Amertek's one of the last viable businesses left in Star City.<eos> Turns out Palmer Tech is one of those viable businesses.<eos> For now, at least.
Are you sure?<eos> Do it.<eos> No, wait.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Take out the tranq, carefully.<eos> Let's hope the Faraday cage Cisco installed in here works.<eos> What?<eos> Basically a shield for everything broadcast and electromagnetic.<eos> Which eye did you see the tech in?<eos> The right one.
Ok.<eos> But it wouldn't have been if this Felicity had come in. You know, the one who wheels in here kicking ass and taking names like you just did.<eos> This is different.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> There's two Felicitys, Felicity.<eos> The one in that boardroom whose wheelchair makes her doubt herself and this Felicity, a brilliant force of nature.<eos> This company needs the second Felicity.<eos> Hey.<eos> Laurel told me.<eos> You ok?
Ok.<eos> It's ok.<eos> Got you, got you, got you.<eos> Well, that went nowhere.<eos> Curtis ever tell you how we met?<eos> He came in with Achilles tendonitis.<eos> He was training to qualify for the Olympics, so all he cared about was results.<eos> Took me weeks just to get him focused on what really mattered.<eos> How handsome his therapist was?<eos> Healing.
He's a big fan.<eos> Oliver likes baseball, too.<eos> Here's hoping that the innate fatherly influence stops there.<eos> Um, does he have any distinguishing features, freckles, birthmarks, anything like that?<eos> Oliver told me that there was someone in his life, someone special, and her name was Felicity.<eos> He wanted to tell you, and I wouldn't let him.<eos> I didn't know who he was now, I didn't know what kind of person he was.<eos> That's going around.<eos> Jut try and remember that I was the one that made him choose between you and knowing his son.<eos> All right.
I'm just... I'm worried about you.<eos> No kidding.<eos> No, dad, seriously, darhk has to know that you're the one that gave up the ghost base of operations.<eos> And I go to work every day surrounded by men and women with guns.<eos> It is all right, sweetheart.<eos> It's all right. Hello.<eos> Lance.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> All right.
Ain't easy when it looks like toilet paper.<eos> Huh!<eos> Boy, you got some balls.<eos> I'm gonna enjoy watching you die.<eos> I... ech...<eos> I didn't want to bother you when you walked in on us at Oliver's campaign office, but I... it's o... it's ok.<eos> No, honey, no, no, it's not.<eos> It's actually not ok.<eos> It's ok.<eos> After your father, after all these years,
Well, that's because you've loved princesses since before you could walk.<eos> Yes.<eos> That and, um...<eos> I've been living vicariously through you.<eos> You and Oliver are one of those couples that everyone believes in.<eos> You don't lie to each other ever, and he's gonna be the best daddy in the whole world when that time comes.<eos> Ahh.<eos> Heh heh.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> In my bones.
Let's go.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> Captain Lance, you're supposed to be not here.<eos> What kind of cop sits on the sidelines when people's lives are at risk, huh?<eos> You stay here.<eos> Oliver:<eos> I count 3 charges but no demo team.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Same here.<eos> No hostiles.
Your honor, the defendant was apprehended at the site of a child abduction.<eos> Because he was being held captive himself.<eos> Your honor, these documents will confirm my client's identity as Kenneth bender, citizen of markovia.<eos> Laurel:<eos> Your honor, this is ridiculous.<eos> The defendant's name is Damien darhk fitzmartin:<eos> According to whom?<eos> You?<eos> Oliver queen?<eos> The media?
Your honor, this is ridiculous.<eos> The defendant's name is Damien darhk fitzmartin:<eos> According to whom?<eos> You?<eos> Oliver queen?<eos> The media?<eos> Heh.<eos> Your honor, there's absolutely no evidence whatsoever to suggest that my client is this Damien darhk, much less prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed these acts that Damien darhk is even accused of.<eos> Your honor, we have evidence, and we will present it at trial.<eos> During which time what?
Even after Mr. queen lost his job as ceo of queen consolidated?<eos> I mean...<eos> How much does he pay you, 10 cents an hour?<eos> Laurel:<eos> Objection.<eos> Relevance?<eos> Sakow: Sustained.<eos> Move faster, Mr. fitzmartin.<eos> Fitzmartin:<eos> Of course, your honor.
I mean...<eos> How much does he pay you, 10 cents an hour?<eos> Laurel:<eos> Objection.<eos> Relevance?<eos> Sakow: Sustained.<eos> Move faster, Mr. fitzmartin.<eos> Fitzmartin:<eos> Of course, your honor.<eos> All right.
-Objection.<eos> -Overruled.<eos> You know, the fact of the matter is,<eos> I've seen your client in his little hidey-hole with his little men.<eos> Ghosts he calls them.<eos> And I've heard him say repeatedly how he wants to destroy this city and that if I didn't help him do it, then he'd kill my daughter.<eos> By saying all these things,<eos> I'm setting a match to my career and maybe my life.<eos> So why would I be doing that if everything I'm saying isn't true?<eos> In position.

Everything ok?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You look perfect.<eos> I'd like to assure you, i won't breathe a word of what goes on here to the press.<eos> Just thrilled to be part of your day.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Can we get this over with?<eos> Can't wait to be married to this guy.<eos> In that case,
In that case,<eos> I know you've written your own vows.<eos> Felicity...<eos> The vows.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ok, um...<eos> Oliver, you have many qualities...<eos> Many astonishing qualities.<eos> And I, for one, cannot wait to move on to the next chapter.<eos> All right.
Lay down, "bee-yotch"!<eos> Heh heh.<eos> Too on the nose?<eos> [Buzzing]<eos> Oh. Ah.<eos> The bee came alive, and, well, things got a little out of hand, but don't worry-- it's dead now.<eos> You did good, Curtis, and I'm--I'm sorry if i made you feel differently.<eos> Thanks, g.A. Heh.<eos> Do you mind if i call you g.A.?<eos> All right.
Welcome to our world.<eos> Hey.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, i should probably just head home.<eos> You know, learning that you're, you know, you and the murderous bees and this coma news, it's just a lot to digest, plus that iv you gave me is starting to wear off.<eos> Well, you are always welcome here, Curtis.<eos> Just keep the property damage to a minimum next time.<eos> Ok.<eos> All right.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Ahem.<eos> Hey.<eos> Nice apology.<eos> Well, I'm just trying to be a beacon of hope and, like you said, save a little bit of the hope for myself.<eos> Taiana.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> All right.<eos> All right.
If you can channel la Luz Del Alma, you will be able to repel Darhk's magic.<eos> Then that is what I'm here to learn.<eos> I wish it were just that easy.<eos> If the darkness inside you outweighs the light, instead of repelling Darhk's magic, you will end up fueling it.<eos> You will only make him more powerful.<eos> Are you getting a signal?<eos> Nope.<eos> That's one of the benefits of being on vacation.<eos> Oh. I just wanted to call my brother.<eos> You ok?
Does that sound crazy?<eos> That--that's crazy.<eos> Only a little, yeah.<eos> I think this is just the last bit of you trying to fight this vacation.<eos> Hey. Let all that go.<eos> Just be happy, ok?<eos> Ok.<eos> I sure am.<eos> - Ok.<eos> - All right.
Sorry we're late.<eos> Oliver's on Lyla and Darhk.<eos> Baby Sara?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You got her?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Ok.<eos> Ok, ok.<eos> All right.
Darhk ripped it out.<eos> Lyla, you need to tell us what Rubicon is.<eos> A ballistic launch override protocol designed to prevent any country, even our own, from firing a nuclear missile.<eos> Something tells me Darhk's plans aren't so benign.<eos> With some work and the right expertise,<eos> Rubicon could be corrupted.<eos> Instead of controlling nukes to prevent them from being launched--<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Darhk would control the world's nuclear stockpile.<eos> To what end?
He was--he was so much more than just... A billionaire playboy.<eos> I loved him.<eos> I loved him in-- in every way you could possibly love someone.<eos> And so did Oliver...<eos> And I'm sure if Oliver could be here today he would say so...<eos> But clearly, it's too painful.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I...<eos> Ok.
Stop being so high-handed.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Mr. Merlyn, do you know what the Khushu idol is?<eos> Khushu is an old Arabic term for humbleness, suffice it to say, something I wouldn't associate with you.<eos> When the earliest homo magi forged these idols, they did so in the image of those whose powers they wished to channel, so attention to detail is essential.<eos> It's missing a piece.<eos> The Ribalvei stone.<eos> They must have hidden it someplace else.<eos> Find it, or Genesis is not what you and your daughter have to fear.<eos> All right.
What about you?<eos> Reiter's still in the catacombs.<eos> If he's found that idol, you won't be able to stop him.<eos> We don't need to stop him.<eos> We need to trap him.<eos> You guys are doing a wonderful job in there.<eos> You know, I have been meaning to redecorate the place myself.<eos> You know, my office received an anonymous tip that contraband intended for your use was smuggled into this prison. - Hmm. - Hmm.<eos> Find anything?<eos> All right.
Some of us change, some of us grow, some of us evolve.<eos> You are stuck, man, stuck in your self-pity and your self-righteousness, and that is why Felicity left you.<eos> My brother is my business.<eos> You have no idea what he's been through, and you sure as hell had no right to judge him.<eos> I'm sure he didn't mean that, Ollie.<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> How'd it go in Iron Heights?<eos> Turned up a few burner cell phones, 6 bags of heroin, and no idol.<eos> Well, we hacked into the security system at the prison, so if anything happens, we'll see it.<eos> Right.
Laurel--is she--<eos> Laurel's in surgery. Um...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've tried calling Lance, too, so...<eos> What happened with Darhk?<eos> He's in the wind along with 50 or so inmates. And Andy.<eos> You warned me, and I didn't listen.<eos> I'll never be able to forgive myself.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Just out of recovery.
Please proceed to the registration building to receive your residence assignments.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> It wasn't easy finding my way down here.<eos> You Ghosts are swell at keeping secrets but less swell resisting torture, so why don't you spare me the trouble and tell me where I can find Damien Darhk?<eos> ♪ Arrow 4x21 ♪ Monument Point Original Air Date on May 11, 2016<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> You're right.<eos> Kuttler's the only one that can stop Rubicon.<eos> That's why Darhk wanted him dead.<eos> You all right?
He can't do anything without the idol.<eos> Come on!<eos> If this is the end of the world, I don't mind going out like this.<eos> Don't you ever stop?<eos> Not when it comes to my daughter, no.<eos> Alex?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> We took out all the explosives.<eos> Alex, oh, God. Oh, God. Are you--<eos> Fine? Ok?
Let's go.<eos> You need to divert that missile.<eos> You are lucky I'm too busy to come up with a witty response to that right now.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop! Unh!<eos> Taiana, are you ok?<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Something's...<eos> Got it!<eos> Mostly.
You're always such a stick in the mud.<eos> Yes!<eos> Let's all take hacking advice from a woman whose only use for her smartphone is as a mirror.<eos> Ho ho! Ha! So funny.<eos> Ha ha! Not.<eos> Felicity may have gotten her brains from you, but she got her creativity from moi.<eos> Matching lipstick to lip liner isn't creativity, and while I may not be father of the year...<eos> Oh, try the past two decades.<eos> I recently took a bullet for our daughter.<eos> Not metaphorically, either.
She's my daughter.<eos> You can lie to her, but can you lie to yourself?<eos> Can you really believe that leaving isn't the best thing for her?<eos> What do you think your parents are talking about?<eos> I'm trying not to think about it.<eos> Maybe they're discussing that thing that Noah said before about not having much of a choice.<eos> That's exactly what I'm trying not to think about.<eos> - Mm-hmm. I helped you save the world.<eos> The least you can do is give me a little gossip.<eos> Ok, fine.
I would've gone with you.<eos> Thought you were with Rosalee.<eos> What's all this for?<eos> You always talkin' about how you want a tattoo like mine.<eos> So I had Ledger help me make up some ink.<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> I've been thinkin' a lot about last names lately.<eos> Why?<eos> You know, on the plantation, I feel like I saw that Macon name everywhere.<eos> On work orders. That iron gate at the bridge.
Where we gonna live.<eos> What we gonna do.<eos> Figure we ought to start with a name.<eos> Henry Hampton.<eos> Noah and Henry Hampton.<eos> You ain't got to cook for us.<eos> I mean, it ain't on you if you don't want to.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> It remind me of home.<eos> The big house?

You got to send that money.<eos> You think so?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I mean, can you imagine if you make a million bucks?<eos> You'll be happier than the guy on his wedding day.<eos> Thanks, everyone.<eos> Good-bye, Mom. Good-bye, Dad.<eos> Good-bye, friends. Good-bye, free time.<eos> Farewell, sex.<eos> So long, golf on TV.
I'm telling you, you wouldn't believe Patty's body.<eos> Just, uh, a tiny waist, firm butt, great rack.<eos> ♪ She's in high school. ♪<eos> I know, and she's in high school.<eos> It's, like, 7:00 a.m., dude. Calm down.<eos> Meg, hey, how's it going?<eos> Uh, hey, Brian. Cool, that's great to hear.<eos> Hey, where's Patty?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Probably at her house?
Why don't you take the extra one?<eos> Wow, thanks, Brian.<eos> Yeah, that's cool, Brian.<eos> Will you buy me a hat at Lids?<eos> No.<eos> You know, Patty, I've got $7.50 left on my Panda Express card if you want to split a three-item combo.<eos> No drink.<eos> Sure!<eos> Well, then, hop on board the Panda Express!<eos> In bed, right?
I'll only refer to you as Bonnie's ex.<eos> You know, like, "Bonnie has an ex, but Brian marks the spot."<eos> Oh, Peter, that's good.<eos> Thanks, babe.<eos> I hope Brian and Bonnie are as happy as us.<eos> To Brian and Bonnie.<eos> Bad news:<eos> the teenage runaways at table four were not big tippers. We just need enough money to get to Taos.<eos> That's like the capital of making and selling your own jewelry.<eos> Okay, enough about the jewelry.
Hey, Quagmire, aren't you gonna get in on this?<eos> I, uh, kind of got my own game going on over here.<eos> All right, I'm off to get more underwear.<eos> We'll meet back here at 2:00. Chris, do you remember your job?<eos> To try and get my shoes sucked into the escalator so we can sue the mall.<eos> That's right, sweetie.<eos> I heard they're paying 50 grand a toe now.<eos> Ah, the train. Now that was the way to travel.<eos> You remember that, Chris?<eos> Not at all.
I wish I could just somehow magically appear there and meet you in person.<eos> Oh, Brian, that would be like a dream.<eos> Okay, I should go.<eos> I have 11,000 people on hold.<eos> Good-bye, Padma.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> Somebody's screaming in the garage.<eos> Why are you still up?<eos> Because I'm in love.<eos> Oh, with that Indian chick?
"Free space"? ! Wow!<eos> What's that about?<eos> ! I call I sit next to Dad!<eos> All right, forget this.<eos> Let's all go home and each do our own individual media things.<eos> Stewie, I don't think this is gonna work.<eos> We're never gonna raise enough money to pay back Padma's father.<eos> Trust me, Brian, there are a billion people here, and almost every one of them has a tapeworm.<eos> Yes, excuse me, I have a tapeworm.<eos> All right, very good.
Huh. Well, I'm not about to make a Batman exit right now, but has that thing always been over there?<eos> Over where?<eos> What are you doing, Peter?<eos> Ah, you looked back too fast.<eos> Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.<eos> Today, we bring you a disturbing case of child pornography.<eos> Local teenage scumbag Chris Griffin, whose name will be omitted here, was caught sending, quote-unquote,<eos> "graphic selfies of his hog"-- not sure where that quote is from-- to another underage student.<eos> Coming up next, teleprompter guy puts the period in a weird.<eos> Place.
What was that last part?<eos> I said, "but if the oak be taken in a manner impure, so the new Bren'in shall not endure."<eos> Shouldn't be no concern to you, if you come by your power proper.<eos> Well, I got no concern.<eos> Let our survival never be questioned.<eos> Let our enemies shrink away.<eos> Let us love our land and our freedom.<eos> Let us only move forward.<eos> I gotta talk to you.<eos> About what?
Safer down here.<eos> Hey there, wife.<eos> Hello.<eos> I know you ain't got no feelings for me, except hate.<eos> No matter.<eos> What I said about you before, in front of the clans, I meant every word.<eos> You are a rare creature, G'winveer.<eos> You got a power inside you.<eos> Fire.<eos> Just like me.
And him and his buddies, they got a whole house full of guns.<eos> What you lookin' for?<eos> Ah, something impressive. Automatic.<eos> Okay, I'll give him a call, get him down here.<eos> Might take a while, though.<eos> Well, I'm in town. Not a problem.<eos> Why don't you come back around 7:00?<eos> The store's closed.<eos> I'll see if I can get him down here.<eos> All right.
Raghav! No, no, no!<eos> The local police can't help you. Sir...<eos> - Go talk to some Minister or someone. Now gm!<eos> We can't take any action against Raghav.<eos> He's the reason we get votes.<eos> But... - Sorry!<eos> I am sorry for whatever happened with your daughter.<eos> But the problem is we don't have any extradition treaty with Thailand.<eos> I mean I can notify the officials. But it's going to take a lot of time.<eos> Rama!
But we must do something.<eos> Someone else is going to do it.<eos> I never listened to anyone in my life.<eos> Rebelled against everything.<eos> But you turned this rebel into a human being.<eos> So I promise you... Everything you taught me... I'll take it further.<eos> I'll never take any wrong step that can taint your name.<eos> I can never repay my teacher's favor. But I will try.<eos> So that one day the whole world will know about this art in India.<eos> And a stubborn teacher.
Brother!<eos> Yong, what the hell are you doing?<eos> Sir, actually his brother isn't answering his phone.<eos> So he's worried. Where's Biju?<eos> - He's on his way, sir.<eos> Medicine time.<eos> Brother...<eos> - Kim, where the hell have you been?<eos> I am in the car.<eos> In the car?
Hey! I know what this is.<eos> Professor Thomas H. Crawford, molecular biologist... during the Second World War, he was one of a small number of American scientists who belonged to something called the War Bureau of Consultants.<eos> The group was charged with investigating the feasibility of a U.S. bio-weapons program.<eos> Looks like Crawford was murdered in his office at Columbia University on the evening of September 1, 1944.<eos> His killers... a man and a woman... were never found.<eos> What does this have to do with the 12 Monkeys or the plague?<eos> I remember there was a time that they were looking for the grave of Thomas Crawford.<eos> I thought about digging him up.<eos> Exhume his remains?<eos> For what purpose?
The first battle may very well have been in 1944.<eos> I'm not a time traveler.<eos> Dr. Railly, I understand this is quite a change in dynamic... but he needs you to guide him through that world.<eos> Katarina... If Mr. Cole fails... we all fail.<eos> Our reports show that Professor Crawford was murdered in his office while a military ceremony was taking place on campus.<eos> The Secretary of War was handing out medals to war heroes.<eos> Well, if the Messengers found a way in, so can we.<eos> - We've done it before.<eos> - This will require a plan.<eos> On the ground.
Some catastrophic event in 1944 disrupted the fabric of space-time, causing temporal anomalies in the here and now.<eos> Anomalies?<eos> Pockets of unstable time.<eos> Deadly.<eos> Expanding.<eos> If we don't find a solution, at this term of acceleration, this will consume the world in a matter of months.<eos> We'll all end up like these men, ravaged by time.<eos> They left the facility this morning, and here they are, aged hundreds of years.<eos> Why here?<eos> Why now, at this time?
What's today's date?<eos> It's Friday, September 1st.<eos> Hold on, buster, where do you think you're going?<eos> It's happening tomorrow.<eos> You have had a serious accident.<eos> The doctor's scheduled surgery to set that bone.<eos> No surgery.<eos> You have to stay in bed.<eos> You'll have plenty of time to recover.<eos> After surgery, okay?
I hate time travel.<eos> Jennifer stayed in New York after I left her there.<eos> She hung around the hotel bar at the the Emerson Flat.<eos> You find her there, she'll take you to the next Primary.<eos> What is she... what are you doing?<eos> Mustering the energy to face Jennifer Goines again.<eos> Oh, come on, she's not that bad.<eos> - She's worse.<eos> - She's horrible, man.<eos> All right, all right.
The Foreman.<eos> What happened to the others?<eos> He got 'em.<eos> Rankin, Otero, he got 'em all.<eos> I barely made it.<eos> They... they came out of nowhere.<eos> Four of my guys, who are stronger, faster, and smarter than you, they got grabbed and you got away?<eos> I got lucky, man.<eos> You made a deal.<eos> No way, man.
The Goines family summer home is a long drive.<eos> We need snacks.<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> Dr. Railly just caught me off guard.<eos> I didn't know she would come for Jennifer.<eos> Did you hear anything else?<eos> Tommy.<eos> They said something about someone named Tommy.<eos> Tommy Crawford.<eos> In 1944.
Jesus, Jennifer, I thought you were on your meds.<eos> I am.<eos> "Word of The Witness."<eos> Well, best before September 2044.<eos> This is it.<eos> Adler said there'd be anomalies.<eos> I don't see anything out here.<eos> Let's check inside.<eos> Let's go.<eos> All right, all clear.
Nope, not sleepy.<eos> You know, as a former CEO of a major biotech company,<eos> I'm used to certain amenities.<eos> This place is old, and it smells.<eos> It smells like old.<eos> Probably haunted.<eos> It's definitely haunted.<eos> You know, some people think that ghosts are just replays.<eos> Traumatic events recorded into their surroundings...<eos> Into time.
Him!<eos> Traveler.<eos> How'd you find us?<eos> Your friend left something at the cafe.<eos> He's with the Primary now?<eos> Yeah, your boss... he's in deep shit.<eos> - The Witness? - Mm-hmm.<eos> If that's true you were wise not to follow him, Traveler.<eos> 1975 is as good a year as any to die, Traveler.<eos> All right, you okay?
A place where time no longer exists.<eos> A place where you can be with the one you love forever.<eos> What could be more important than that?<eos> No.<eos> No, it can't be that way.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> The Red Forest is the only way to beat death.<eos> The Witness wants to be immortal in his timeless forest, but can you imagine destroying time itself, so everything that's left is living and dying in the same moment?<eos> An eternal now?
You shouldn't squint so much.<eos> You'll start looking like Keith Richards.<eos> Yeah, Keith Richards.<eos> Well, I wouldn't have to squint if you'd just scoot over so I could sit in the shade.<eos> Oh, we'd be perfectly willing to scoot over, but then people might think you're in the clique.<eos> Yeah, the clique.<eos> I will never be in your clique.<eos> Cliques encourage exclusivity, and I want to promote acceptance.<eos> Well, how about accepting that your deodorant crystal can't stand up to 80 degrees in alpaca?<eos> Yeah, alpaca.
But you... You're just a boy.<eos> What was it like growing up with him?<eos> When I was a kid, I idolized him.<eos> Hell, I wanted to be him.<eos> But the older I got, the more I realized that I didn't know him at all.<eos> How could I? Bruce Wayne is as much a mask as Batman.<eos> And I think the only thing behind those masks is pain.<eos> A pain he refuses to share with anyone.<eos> So what was it like?<eos> Lonely.
That's for what you did to my father, bitch!<eos> It's over, Mother.<eos> Your grand plan has ended.<eos> How is it I ever loved either of you?<eos> I don't think you ever did.<eos> Beloved, you have no idea.<eos> I have thought of little else for the last 12 years.<eos> But nothing, not my passion, not the death of my father, not even our child could bring you to my side.<eos> I know now, I will never have you in this life.<eos> - But perhaps, in death.
I think I just beat you to it.<eos> Can anyone hear me?<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> Me and the pirates are gonna have a little parlay.<eos> - Do not do this, Rory.<eos> - Too late.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to speak to Captain Valor.<eos> - About what?<eos> - About a timeship.
Once Lieutenant Coburn resigned.<eos> - Why would she do that?<eos> - It seems she believes in you.<eos> Now you must prove to yourself and all of us that you are indeed the man she believes you to be.<eos> I thought we were done for.<eos> Take heart, dear Captain.<eos> This battle is far from over.<eos> Now, who would care to join me in a daring escape?<eos> - Space Ranger.<eos> - Indeed.
This battle is far from over.<eos> Now, who would care to join me in a daring escape?<eos> - Space Ranger.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> Ray, don't go nodding off on me.<eos> No, I wasn't.<eos> I was just resting my eyes for a second.<eos> You've got to stay with me, Ray.<eos> Just stay focused on my voice, and keep talking.<eos> - About what?
Just stay focused on my voice, and keep talking.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Anything.<eos> Like, um, what was your first pet's name?<eos> - Slinky.<eos> - Is that a cat?<eos> Burmese python.<eos> Yeah, I'm allergic to cats and dogs.<eos> Pretty much anything without scales.<eos> Okay, then, enough about pets.
- Why do you answer? You're on vacation.<eos> Why do you call then?<eos> - Just checking how you're doing.<eos> Are you getting some rest?<eos> Cut it out.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The name 'Kiruna'... rings any bell?<eos> north of the Arctic Circle.<eos> Russia or Finland? - Sweden.<eos> And... ?
who cares?<eos> I have a favor to ask you.<eos> What?<eos> - See that burner back there?<eos> No need to take your shoes off.<eos> I'll move it later.<eos> already up?<eos> - It seems so.<eos> What time will people start coming?<eos> - 7pm obviously.
The reindeer herder got lucky.<eos> - How come?<eos> Better stay away from Saivo creatures.<eos> Maybe someone else is also lucky.<eos> Did you say 'abyss'?<eos> - Did I?<eos> Jessika was supposed to be back tomorrow.<eos> Weren't you gonna tell her?<eos> I didn't had the chance... 53YRS OLD MAN KILLED WITH A BEAR SPEAR<eos> ENGLISH SUBTITLES BY BARISHNIKOV@KICKASS
Have you read the papers?<eos> Turn on the computer.<eos> Do they say who the victim is?<eos> see you later.<eos> do you know something about that?<eos> but a friend of mine says the victim's name is Forsberg.<eos> Forsberg? - Jörgen.<eos> Some sort of guide for teenagers.<eos> bye.<eos> - Bye.
Coincidence?<eos> Forsberg was a strange man.<eos> He probably pissed somebody off.<eos> It's got nothing to do with us.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> It's happening.<eos> a colleague.<eos> We need help.<eos> For what?<eos> - Work.
The plants you talk about...<eos> They grow at the feet of the Kebnekaise.<eos> There's someone you should talk to.<eos> driven by a false belief.<eos> meets shamans... Collects plants and ingredients which you don't find in Sápmi.<eos> What's his name?<eos> They call him Bangkok-Jori 'cause he's been incarcerated in Thailand.<eos> He's not trustworthy though.<eos> You know where we can find this Bangkok-Jori?<eos> Facebook.
Doing what? - Infiltrated in the Algerians workers.- - -<eos> There was a strike back then. The government feared some info could go public.- - -<eos> About what?<eos> - About October 17, 1961.- - - 300 Algerians were found dead in the river Seine.- - -<eos> Most had been beaten to death, some were thrown in still alive.- - -<eos> Back then, the papers didn't write about it...- - -<eos> ..but in the late 70's the climate was very much changed.- - -<eos> Carnot was getting rid of inconvenient people.<eos> - When diplomacy failed, he came in.- - -<eos> In South-East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and South America.- - -
- What you mean?<eos> You think it's the miserable drunk Sparen Andersson hanging up there... that's a bear.<eos> right?<eos> yes.<eos> That's a Saami bear ring.<eos> Anders Harnesk here.<eos> Iihtallan.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Iihtallan.<eos> ENGLISH SUBTITLES BY BARISHNIKOV@KICKASS
How I...?<eos> - Made...<eos> No... he has not always been gay.<eos> you know... maybe he has. Maybe he has and he just lied to himself.<eos> He's fucked up anyway.<eos> - At least you have a dad.<eos> I have almost no mom.<eos> Before that he did 4 years at Lule University... right?<eos> - Luleå... ok.<eos> Technical studies.
He doesn't have a regular employment.<eos> He's a technician or a cleaner. What's it about him?<eos> Is it possible to drown inside the mine?<eos> I know there's water-filled mines, like in Dalarna for example...<eos> You only fill a mine with waterNwhen you wanna close it down. -<eos> - How?<eos> By switching off the pumps, the ground water pumps.<eos> Without them, the whole mineNwould fill with water very very fast.<eos> We believe Eddie Geatki started the fireNto get a few people trapped.<eos> But why? -
- How?<eos> By switching off the pumps, the ground water pumps.<eos> Without them, the whole mineNwould fill with water very very fast.<eos> We believe Eddie Geatki started the fireNto get a few people trapped.<eos> But why? -<eos> - We can't tell you yet.<eos> There are 400 kilometers ofNasphalt road down there and more than 10.000 blast passages.<eos> If the pumps that control ground water are switched off, it will take less than two days to fill the whole mine.<eos> So, if you're on the bottom when it happens...<eos> At 1545?
We'll make a... antidote. - Yes.<eos> - Okay, just talk me through it.<eos> What am I looking for?<eos> Come on. Laudanum powder.<eos> What else? Crane, stay with me.<eos> Magnesium sulfate.<eos> What else? Magnesium sulfate.<eos> Okay, good. What else?<eos> Leiurus quinquestriatus. What?<eos> Uh, in the vial.
Just that it's getting a lot of attention and it's going on the block tomorrow night.<eos> - Who's the seller?<eos> - Anonymous. Most likely a relic hunter who stumbled on something that's out of his league and he wants to unload it.<eos> These auctions are set up on the fly.<eos> Fast, in-and-out, no questions asked.<eos> Oh. That's a lot of heavy hitters on the invite list.<eos> Look, $10,000 minimum reserve.<eos> Though I guess that's not a problem for you anymore, unless you spent it all buying another trailer for someone.<eos> Wow, you are not letting that go any time soon, are you?<eos> Not in this lifetime.
"And despite my utmost "ministrations, my brother expired.<eos> "Then a most "disturbing event occurred.<eos> Like a twisted, demonic Lazarus..."<eos> "... Thomas rose again."<eos> "Thomas rose again"?<eos> "There is no end."<eos> That's what it said on the stones.<eos> What if that wasn't about the monster?<eos> What if that was about the victims?<eos> Robbie?
I came to see that there are things missing in my life.<eos> I got friends and family, you know, but I don't have, like... what we had... and because of the way that my life is,<eos> I may never have that... and figuring that out is scary.<eos> And having this conversation... is scary.<eos> So, I'm gonna tell you that I... don't think of us as something in the past tense.<eos> Thank you for telling me the truth. The truth...<eos> For the longest time,<eos> I thought that the truth was dangerous, and it still can be, but... now I'm starting to know that the thing that we think will hurt us may actually save us.<eos> Where'd you put it?<eos> Somewhere safe.
It was forged by the gods themselves to contain their power.<eos> It is the only thing that will stop him.<eos> The Hidden One?<eos> Why would we believe that?<eos> Because if you do not, then we will all be extinguished.<eos> So, your impending demise caused a change of heart.<eos> I speak the truth.<eos> If I were to believe you, there must be another way to stop him. Another way to restore the Box.<eos> It cannot be repaired, but it can be regenerated, only in the place where it was forged.<eos> The Catacombs.
After all the missions, this flag may be my greatest accomplishment.<eos> Betsy, I'm certain you are wrong there.<eos> And even if it were it really is beautiful.<eos> Wow, the Betsy Ross flag.<eos> The original Stars and Stripes.<eos> She told me she was not going on the mission.<eos> Clearly, she did.<eos> Well, she knew you'd just worry.<eos> She must have cared about you a lot.<eos> Indeed.
Yes.<eos> And 'twas best we parted when we did.<eos> She had her path to follow after that mission, and I had mine, but my point is,<eos> Lieutenant, if you care for someone, do not leave anything unsaid.<eos> Crane, this is an American fort, right?<eos> Used by an American army?<eos> Yes.<eos> Used continuously for over 125 years.<eos> But why is there a 42-foot statue of Orpheus on the grounds?<eos> CRANE: These, around the base.
Seems like too often.<eos> So, listen, Danny, I know you have a lot of questions, and I am going to get to all of them-<eos> - I promise-- but first I need to say something.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For the longest time, I told myself that I couldn't let anything happen between us because of this responsibility that comes before anything else, but that was just an excuse.<eos> The funny thing is, I thought that once you knew the truth about the craziness of my world, that I would be relieved.<eos> I thought, I won't have to hide anything from him anymore.<eos> But now you know and... I'm still scared, because it's no longer about the monsters or the supernatural or anything else.<eos> It's just, it's just about, um, you and me.<eos> You and me.
I'll gonna circle back with Crane, see if he has any insights.<eos> I'll loop in Joe and Jenny, and we'll clean up the image, figure out what we're dealing with.<eos> Thanks.<eos> If you come not bearing cruller, Lieutenant, do not bother coming...<eos> Your time has come, mortal.<eos> You and the ones you lead have dared to lay a hand upon my consort.<eos> You have all forgotten your place and for that, you will pay the ultimate price.<eos> Where is the other Witness?<eos> If you tell me I will make your deaths painless.<eos> Very well.
I knew there was something wrong.<eos> He was murdered, wasn't he?<eos> I can't say.<eos> It's that guy with the rings.<eos> Have you arrested him?<eos> Leanne, did you see anybody between the connecting doors at the car deck?<eos> Do you want me to get one of my officers to sit with you for a bit?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'll be fine.<eos> OK.
Go where?<eos> Glasgow. Take a wee break.<eos> You know, we've never had a holiday together.<eos> And what will I do while you're working?<eos> Jesus, woman, if you can't find anything to do in a place like that, there's something wrong with you.<eos> Anyway, I, er... I won't be working all the time.<eos> I've got to get going...<eos> So...<eos> Glasgow?<eos> All right.
It wasn't an accident.<eos> So, I'm just giving you a chance here to tell me whatever it is you know.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> I'm not done here.<eos> I've been through all the CCTV footage from the ferry.<eos> Craig Cooper's alibi checks out.<eos> Doesn't mean he's not involved in some other way.<eos> But look at this, boss.<eos> Door 5B.<eos> Robbie.
Aye.<eos> - Er, stop, please. - Huh?<eos> - Stop.<eos> This is where I'm staying.<eos> All right?<eos> Thanks.<eos> People come to Shetland and they think that... because they're out on a big rock in the middle of the North Sea, they think that this isn't part of real life.<eos> Nothing bad ever happens.<eos> Robbie...<eos> Robbie?
She could be anywhere, and you don't even know the way in.<eos> Last chance to take the money and run.<eos> Do you want some more water?<eos> You're not gonna read that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> That hunter obsessed with the hunt.<eos> He talking about your father?<eos> I've seen my father every day of my life and never even really talked to him.<eos> About anything.
Kyle found her ...in the hideaway.<eos> What? What do you mean?<eos> When?<eos> Two days ago.<eos> He knows we're running a station.<eos> Yes.<eos> He's not gonna tell anyone.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> It all happened so fast that there... there was no time to think.<eos> Not about you or myself.
We're all in this together.<eos> Best way.<eos> Is anyone hurt?<eos> - We're fine, thanks, guv.<eos> - Suspect down, repeat, suspect down.<eos> Stow your weapons.<eos> Victor Charlie Four One, requesting forensic deployment for the scene.<eos> All AFOs and weapons require transporting to base for forensic recovery of evidence and debrief.<eos> You sure you're OK?<eos> Fine.
I what?<eos> You ghosted him.<eos> You disappeared.<eos> And now you're gonna ghost your baby.<eos> Family breakfast, no one bothers to invite the padre.<eos> Typical.<eos> Frank, walk me to school.<eos> Walk you to school? What are you--<eos> You think I'm your father?<eos> All right.
No, I mean, um... yeah, no, it's just... you know, Helene comes over sometimes.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay, the salty dog. I'll clear out when she's here.<eos> You know, and I'm the RA now, and--<eos> I don't know, you know. - I guess I feel like I kind of earned my space or whatever.<eos> But you can totally crash tonight.<eos> Or any night, you know. Just don't move your shit in is all I'm saying.<eos> You smoking now?<eos> Oh, I'll quit soon.<eos> You okay?
Scorann was never meant to die, was he?<eos> Do you think Rheda will care?<eos> If I were you, I'd watch your back.<eos> This has got away from me.<eos> You realise that all Slean has to do is tell Rheda of your deeds and you lose everything.<eos> If Slean wanted to destroy me, he would have done so at the Gathering.<eos> Instead, he pinned the blame on the Varni.<eos> He's a man whose ambition is at war with his conscience.<eos> And that's useful to me.<eos> For now.
Slean, wait!<eos> Do you even understand the meaning of the word 'discretion'?<eos> It's taken weeks for him to come around.<eos> All of it undone.<eos> All of it worthless.<eos> Is it my fault your son finds offence wherever he looks?<eos> A troll!<eos> Attacked me. Tried to kill me.<eos> Where?<eos> In the forest, right on the edge of our claim, by the old workings.
A skinshifter saved his life.<eos> He must have choked on that.<eos> I won't let him harm you.<eos> I won't.<eos> Sister, this is an unexpected pleasure.<eos> It has been too long since you have been home.<eos> I'm not here for pleasure.<eos> I've been hearing things.<eos> About Bregan.<eos> About you.
Mother.<eos> - Have you no shame?<eos> - Slean!<eos> Selling your body and my birthright.<eos> You have no birthright.<eos> You gave it up when you joined your uncle in treason.<eos> Oh, for once in your life, can you please just be honest with yourself?<eos> You never had any intention of stepping aside for me, did you?<eos> I did.<eos> At first.
Michael Maguire's real name was Michael Thompson.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Now, he had his own story, you just got caught up in it.<eos> You were unlucky.<eos> Robbie?<eos> We still don't know who killed Robbie.<eos> But I don't think it was Michael.<eos> Now, when you saw them together on the ferry did it look to you as though they'd met by accident or by arrangement?<eos> Er, I don't know.<eos> OK.
So, it turns out King's Cafe isn't a chippy anymore.<eos> You can't get a special fish supper after work.<eos> I'm not convinced the march of progress in this city is going in the right direction.<eos> All right.<eos> You had any luck tracing Brian McDade?<eos> Nothing from the hospitals, and his family haven't heard from him for days.<eos> I've put flags on his phone, his passport, his numberplates, his bank cards.<eos> Other than that I've got a list of his friends that I'm going to start following up.<eos> Tommy's promised someone to help, but I'll believe it when I see it.<eos> OK.
Passenger, A. Mclntosh.<eos> She was?<eos> - I see.<eos> - No, Tommy,<eos> I've just spoken with Loganair.<eos> She definitely had a ticket, she just didn't get on the flight.<eos> Got a trace on her phone.<eos> The coordinates are saying she's in the East End.<eos> I'll get officers over there right away.<eos> No, no, no, no, down here.

-Clearly I-I know nothing.<eos> Well, I hope that you get to meet him some day.<eos> Sol has the soul of the Buddha, he has the heart of Mother Teresa.<eos> And, oh, those soulful eyes!<eos> How they twinkle when you know he's--<eos> You know, since you love Sol so much, maybe you could take him his underwear.<eos> Oh, Frankie. -Well, I suppose I could.<eos> -No.<eos> We're OK. -Thank you for stopping by, Lucy.<eos> -OK.
I put the syrup inside like a burrito, sometimes it squirts out.<eos> -It's how they eat it in France.<eos> -Honey, that's fantastic!<eos> -Oh, my God, that's news.<eos> What?<eos> -I didn't even know you guys were trying.<eos> -She's pregnant?<eos> Is she pregnant?<eos> -Twins!<eos> Oh! As in two? Oh.
Why would-<eos> - Macklin, come here.<eos> Why on earth would Mommy be scared?<eos> -Because she's sick.<eos> -Mommy's not sick.<eos> But Grandma Jean had us make get-well cards for Mommy because she's sick because there's not enough room in her tummy for two babies.<eos> First of all, homemade cards are great, but only if you put in a lot of effort.<eos> And second, babies don't grow in Mommy's tummy, they grow in a separate part<eos> -that only mommies have.<eos> -Her pocketbook?
I know how to write "hillbillies." 53177187714.<eos> - Say that again, but slower.<eos> - I know what I want.<eos> -Oh. -This ought to be good.<eos> I want six percent of the gross, I want my art on the box, and I want you to take me seriously.<eos> I am trying to, it's kind of a challenge sometimes.<eos> That's my process.<eos> You want my lube?<eos> You get my process.<eos> OK, fine.
- Allie.<eos> - Seriously? He was acquitted for lack of evidence. That does not mean he didn't do it.<eos> He had the motive.<eos> He had the means. He had an airtight alibi.<eos> Witnesses saw him at the opera that night.<eos> That opera is four hours long.<eos> He could have left, killed her, had dinner, and still been back in time to sleep through act three.<eos> But what about their love story?<eos> Between Jeffrey and Edith or between Jeffrey and the $40 million Edith left him in her will?<eos> Between Jeffrey and Rebecca.
I promise you there'll be no Alice Vaughan.<eos> How'd it go with Rebecca and Jeff?<eos> Rebecca really thinks Payton did it.<eos> But you don't believe that?<eos> I think we need to talk to Payton.<eos> And that you need to talk to Gordon.<eos> Which is why I hired a mediator... so we can talk.<eos> His failure to show up means that he has nothing to say.<eos> - Maybe he was stuck in court.<eos> - Or in someone else's vagina. Whoa!
Nothing even remotely adultery-ish.<eos> So... is there any way that you want to talk about what's going on with you and Val?<eos> Uh, it's complicated.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> She'll forgive you.<eos> I did.<eos> For what?<eos> For going after Christopher without us.<eos> So, you knew about me and Christopher?<eos> And about you and Dao.
- Will we be armed?<eos> - No.<eos> There'll be metal detectors at the door.<eos> - Will we have backup of any kind?<eos> - We will have each other.<eos> See, if you two were back with the syndicate, we'd have backup and guns stashed all over the consulate in ceiling tiles and potted plants.<eos> I admit there were advantages to working for the company.<eos> Yeah, well, hard work builds character.<eos> What an American way of putting it.<eos> All right.

The laptop came back online an hour ago.<eos> It's masking its location, but I was able to install a stealth program that's sending snapshots of local wireless activity.<eos> Which means...<eos> I've narrowed the location to a single block in Downey.<eos> - Of course you have.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Doors and windows are all locked.<eos> Do you see anyone inside?<eos> Nope.<eos> In that case...
Baby, just give me two seconds, please.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> I kind of told my girlfriend I'm in Gamblers Anonymous for the last six months, that I've been clean, and she went through my phone this morning, so I...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just... I can't swing it tonight, man.<eos> But if she goes to bed early, and you can't sleep...<eos> You know what, I-I-I got a breakfast meeting early tomorrow anyway, but...<eos> Thanks, though. Appreciate it.<eos> All right.
I can't thank you both enough.<eos> Karen's in jail.<eos> My son's with me.<eos> Hiring you ladies was the best money I ever spent.<eos> What about the money you spent on Dr. Kimbrough, your wife's psychiatrist, in exchange for his testimony against Karen?<eos> And Ashlynn Pastorek, your son's former nanny?<eos> Leo Castro, Joey's school counselor?<eos> Did you know that it's a felony to bribe witnesses?<eos> Up to 15 years in federal prison.<eos> All right, fine.
Or we will forward the evidence of your bribery to the judge.<eos> And that's gonna cost you that much in legal fees to defend yourself in court, that much in wages lost when you end up serving jail time, versus the bargain price of that much to walk out of here and comply with our demands.<eos> So you'll have to decide... what is Joey worth to you?<eos> Wow. This is incredible.<eos> You've completely transformed the place.<eos> Almost looks real.<eos> "Almost"?<eos> It is real.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, in that case...
All good.<eos> Remind me why I agreed to you yapping in my ear all night.<eos> Because this is my show, and I call the shots.<eos> And you've had one too many.<eos> Okay. Positions, please.<eos> Welcome, Mr. Seavers.<eos> $3 million in cash.<eos> We'll secure your money.<eos> In the meantime, your seat and chip stack are waiting for you.<eos> All right.
I'm all-in.<eos> He's got a flush.<eos> Reggie, fold.<eos> Ben, fold.<eos> Rhys, you've got a straight flush.<eos> You can clean him out on this hand.<eos> Ah, the Ringer is out.<eos> Tempting, but...<eos> Rhys, you moron, you've got to call.<eos> All right!
So what did Val's husband do to make her want to divorce him?<eos> I'm not really one to gossip.<eos> He cheated... one time... and then he felt so bad about it that he went and told Val, and she still won't forgive him.<eos> Wait.<eos> He's the victim in this story? - I'm just saying along with the regulatory role of dormant B-cells...<eos> I'm just saying that if you can't love somebody at their worst, then you never really loved them. You're not in a relationship, are you?<eos> I don't know if I believe in them.<eos> Why?<eos> Are you?<eos> In a relationship?
I will call for your bodymen and your car right away.<eos> That won't be necessary, Qasim.<eos> Michael's hired a car.<eos> Using one of my fancy new credit cards.<eos> There's plenty of room, Qasim, if you and your boys want to join us.<eos> It turns out, Michael's also a potential investor in the Runyon Towers.<eos> You're going to view the investment property?<eos> With father gone,<eos> Michael's encouraged me to take a more active role in my family's finances.<eos> Very well.
That was the old me. This is the new me.<eos> And the new me is gonna get shot in the head if you don't give me the bracelet back.<eos> If I give it back, I'm an accessory to a crime.<eos> If you keep it, you'll be found guilty of the crime.<eos> And let me tell you something... my Benefactor isn't the only one looking for it.<eos> Those people shooting at me last night?<eos> If they find out you have it, they'll be shooting at you, too.<eos> Now you're just trying to scare me.<eos> No, I'm trying to terrify you, because you should be terrified, because I'm terrified for you.<eos> All right, fine.
No one will know.<eos> We will figure out who's behind this, and we'll make it stop.<eos> What you're doing is too important.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But if you could just find out who this is, I'll take care of it myself.<eos> Maybe you can take care of a federal agent for me while you're at it.<eos> No, please.<eos> Allow me.<eos> So, where is it?<eos> Someplace safe.
So, what is this bracelet, Rhys?<eos> Why is every crook in town after it?<eos> 'Cause it's worth a bloody fortune.<eos> Well, you already have a fortune.<eos> Several, including mine.<eos> - Now, now.<eos> - Ben's right.<eos> You didn't fly all the way from London for a piece of jewelry.<eos> What's it really?<eos> All right.
I'm here because Mum sent me.<eos> - You are not!<eos> - What?<eos> - It's true.<eos> - Since when do you listen to Mum?<eos> How can you not?<eos> She bangs on and on.<eos> - The woman never shuts up.<eos> - About what?<eos> About you.
- You are not!<eos> - What?<eos> - It's true.<eos> - Since when do you listen to Mum?<eos> How can you not?<eos> She bangs on and on.<eos> - The woman never shuts up.<eos> - About what?<eos> About you.<eos> About us.
It's a little theatrical.<eos> You used to love my theatrics.<eos> Yeah, your theatrics got us into a lot of trouble.<eos> You used to love trouble.<eos> My sister's domesticated you.<eos> She sucked all the fun out of you, like some Earl Grey succubus.<eos> Just because it's not you and me getting wasted every night, with different women every night...<eos> - Sometimes the same woman.<eos> - doesn't mean...<eos> - At the same time.
Ask what?<eos> Who's better?<eos> Brother or sister?<eos> Oh, that's it.<eos> Go on. Get out of here.<eos> Bye.<eos> Safe travels.<eos> Will you visit me now that you're free?<eos> What, in India?<eos> Or Africa or the Middle East.
No, of course not, Rhys.<eos> I know all about you and Alice Vaughan.<eos> I suggest you stay loyal.<eos> You asked me to choose.<eos> I choose you.<eos> You're working with Dao? I am.<eos> As a C.I.... a confidential informant against Rhys Griffiths.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Rhys knows about you. About us.<eos> Mm.
- It is.<eos> Because Virginia said no one uses paper anymore. Wow.<eos> This is almost as nice as the invitation I got to your wedding.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I deserve it.<eos> You deserve much worse.<eos> You two don't have to do this.<eos> If we don't put these people away, they'll come after us again.<eos> They will come after you at the wedding.<eos> Not in front of 200 people.
He's trying to protect himself, okay?<eos> He doesn't want us near his big score.<eos> This isn't his score, it's Sybil's.<eos> And the minute that it's done, she's going to kill him.<eos> - You believe him?<eos> - No, she won't.<eos> And the longer we stand here talking about it, the less time we have to save him and ourselves.<eos> What about Virginia Foster's other properties?<eos> Other than this lot, there's the one in Malibu, the one in Benedict Canyon.<eos> Where in Benedict Canyon?
Now I'm gonna have to be cynical about love all by myself.<eos> You're gonna have to do everything by yourself once your mother gives Jamison the order to kill me.<eos> I'm not gonna let Jamison kill you.<eos> Look, if Morgan can stand up to his mother, I can certainly stand up to mine.<eos> Morgan had you and me helping him.<eos> Yeah, and I've got you.<eos> ♪ My heart was wrapped in clover ♪ And I'm not about to let you go now.<eos> ♪ The night I looked at you ♪ Ohh. They've seen us.<eos> They're gonna ask us to dance, aren't they? Mm-hmm.<eos> Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Goodbye.
I told you, Shawn's not really my type.<eos> So... what's your type?<eos> Apparently it's really mouthy co-workers who are talking when they should probably be kissing me.<eos> Yeah. I-I hate people like that.<eos> Can I talk to you for a sec?<eos> Look, I don't know what's going on between you and Sophie, - but I just...<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Nothing is going on between Sophie and me, Shawn.<eos> I swear.<eos> Good. Okay.
What does Margot think about it?<eos> Rhys is going to offer her New York.<eos> Hopefully she'll take it.<eos> Wow. So, that's what this is.<eos> Rhys leaves, Margot leaves so you can play house with Little Red.<eos> Tell me I'm wrong.<eos> The truth is Alice and Agent Dao decided to go after Rhys.<eos> - She thinks if she can put him away, then I have... Does she want to die?<eos> Which is why I will do whatever it takes to keep him away from her, even if it means rejoining the firm... for now.<eos> For now.
- No.<eos> - I told you...<eos> - Having lunch doesn't make it a thing.<eos> Having dinner makes it a thing.<eos> Or we could just go back to having meaningless sex.<eos> - I'm fine with that.<eos> - Allie.<eos> Agent Dao found Rhys Griffiths.<eos> At the Weatherby Hotel.<eos> At the Weatherby?
I just want it to go away.<eos> That's what they want.<eos> They want to act Like it never happened. It'll get better.<eos> I promise.<eos> But it's not Just gonna go away.<eos> Taylor, my name is nurse wells.<eos> I'm the forensic nurse that's Gonna be working with you today.<eos> So, i want to talk with you About how this process works.<eos> But do you have any questions, Just off the top? No. Okay.<eos> All right.
H.I.V.?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I didn't even...<eos> I didn't even think That could...<eos> Yeah, and of course not.<eos> Why would you think about that?<eos> But in these kinds of Situations, it's recommended. So, if you have a doctor<eos> That you all normally see For things, that's great.<eos> If not, i want to make sure That you get connected With the city clinic For those tests.<eos> All right.
Really?<eos> - And you can?<eos> - I know who I am.<eos> I'm a guy who's about to be disowned when Dad finds out that Jace and Clary are still out doing God knows what.<eos> I think Dad's used to that by now.<eos> This is Jace you're talking about.<eos> He said he'd be an hour.<eos> It's been three.<eos> You don't think he and Clary are...<eos> At a time like this?
It's been three.<eos> You don't think he and Clary are...<eos> At a time like this?<eos> Not possible.<eos> Really?<eos> In here?<eos> - Why not?<eos> - There's got to be a better place.<eos> - No, here's good. - Ow!<eos> All right.
Going up.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Some sort of power surge.<eos> Whole building's fried.<eos> No lights, no camera, no nothing.<eos> Get anything on our killer?<eos> Yeah, you were right.<eos> Huge amounts of demon venom in Vargas' blood.<eos> - It's a shapeshifter.<eos> - All right.
Welcome to the neighborhood.<eos> If she wants a show, we will give her a show.<eos> - Okay. Don't do that!<eos> - I'm going into the house!<eos> Put me down!<eos> That was so weird.<eos> Don't know what her problem was.<eos> Yeah, well, she looks like she has a lot of problems...<eos> None of which are ours.<eos> You Okay?
You folks are from Los Angeles.<eos> You got that air about you.<eos> We left when they started bombing.<eos> Napalm.<eos> It's what they're using up and down the coast.<eos> I've been checking in with some of the other ranger stations.<eos> Is it every city?<eos> As far as I can tell.<eos> Portland, Seattle, Vancouver.<eos> And south?

Three: the Vatican must immediately buy back the papal tiara from the basilica in Washington DC, which my predecessors, who favoured sobriety over tradition, imprudently let go.<eos> And four: Sister Mary will also look after you.<eos> She will oversee all your activities and report directly back to me.<eos> She will be your guardian angel.<eos> I am sixty years old, Holy Father.<eos> I don't need a guardian angel.<eos> Oh, we all need a guardian angel, Voiello.<eos> Especially unscrupulous, ambiguous men.<eos> Then, please, allow me to choose mine myself.<eos> In another life.
God's house! What's it like?<eos> Half of a duplex, with a private swimming pool.<eos> Come on now, tell me people's sins.<eos> Well... have I already told you about Voiello's impure thoughts about the Venus of Willendorf?<eos> Yes, yes, you told me already. What else?<eos> No, nothing...<eos> Cardinal Aguirre did an imitation of you today, Your Holiness.<eos> Everyone laughed.<eos> Did you laugh?<eos> Yes, but to myself.
- What do you see?<eos> - God's plan.<eos> A complex architecture that depends on you, Your Holiness.<eos> Everything is so clear.<eos> Who's in there?<eos> No one. Go see for yourself if you don't believe me.<eos> All of Vatican City is yours, Holy Father, and so is this apartment.<eos> No one loves me, which is why I am prepared for every kind of vileness, from everyone.<eos> Holy Father, I see Christ's reflection in you.<eos> And in Dussolier?
What, Your Holiness?<eos> After all, wouldn't etiquette require that we entertain the Prime Minister, not her assistant?<eos> The Cardinal Secretary of State is entertaining her.<eos> What about the fact that such a sizable group of men have eyes only for a handsome man, and pay no attention to such stunning feminine beauty?<eos> Holy Father, I know exactly how to answer that question.<eos> How?<eos> With the silence.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you should never stick your nose into other people's business.<eos> Especially not in the Vatican.
Lazio is going deep once again...<eos> Watch out for Lulic!<eos> How could we let this happen?<eos> How could we let this happen? How could we let this happen?<eos> Such a key game... wasted like this!<eos> What the hell? ! What kind of Naples' team is this?<eos> How can you possibly play such a crucial game this way?<eos> We let them overtake us like this! We let them overtake us like this!<eos> For the second time!
The piece of the pipe you were missing.<eos> The piece I gave you before I left you.<eos> How did you know I lost it?<eos> From time to time I'd call the orphanage where you were growing up.<eos> And they told me that you always kept a piece of the pipe with you, but that you were missing the other piece.<eos> How did you find that piece?<eos> I had already lost it after you left me at the orphanage.<eos> Because one day, I was in a shop in Venice, and I happened to find the same pipe so I bought it.<eos> And I sent you the piece of it that you had lost.<eos> All right.
If you will allow me, Holy Father, you're not tired.<eos> You're grieving and struggling with guilt over the death of your closest friend, Cardinal Dussolier.<eos> What did you want to talk to me about, Holy Father?<eos> What are we doing wrong?<eos> Oh, it's very simple.<eos> We've failed to follow the eternal, unchanging principle of the carrot and the stick.<eos> The carrot and the stick.<eos> We brought the stick but forgot the carrot.<eos> What do you mean by carrot?<eos> An opening.
Oh, that's cryptic.<eos> Is it anyone I know?<eos> It's a small town.<eos> I want names.<eos> - Are you all right? - Yeah.<eos> Sooner or later I'm gonna break my neck on those stupid stairs.<eos> - Hey, look, more stairs. - Whoa.<eos> Here, wait, wait, let me help you up here.<eos> This is like an Olympic sobriety test.<eos> - You all right?
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.<eos> To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.<eos> I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on "The Flash"...
No! You know what? For once, Batman, you're right.<eos> I'm not your greatest enemy.<eos> Your greatest enemy is you.<eos> - Goodbye, Batman.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Hold on a second. Good for you, boo-boo!<eos> - Everybody, get a bomb. Let's go.<eos> - Bomb, bomb, bomb. Let's bomb it out.<eos> Say goodbye, Gotham City!<eos> - Whoa. - Hi!
What are you talking about?<eos> I'm not a bad guy.<eos> But you're all in black. You have a cape.<eos> And you wear a big, scary mask.<eos> Well, I'm not.<eos> And you kicked me in the face.<eos> Listen, I'm Batman.<eos> Oof! You even sound like a bad guy.<eos> I swear, I am a good guy.<eos> Okay, Mr. Batman.
Listen, you don't have a family.<eos> So what do you know about having a surrogate son?<eos> Batman!<eos> We have to stick together.<eos> Please.<eos> Joker, you mean nothing to me.<eos> No one does.<eos> You're not a traditional bad guy.<eos> But you're not exactly a good guy, either.<eos> - Batman? - Padre?
Run!<eos> Come on, Alfred.<eos> This way. Wait, where's Dick?<eos> The little guy? He's over there.<eos> Initializing Batcave operating system.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> I've gotta save my family!<eos> Just think.<eos> - What would Batman do?<eos> - What?
- What would Batman do?<eos> - What?<eos> I know. Not listen to anyone else.<eos> Be mean to people.<eos> Destroy as much property as possible.<eos> Talk in a really low, gravelly voice.<eos> And go it alone.<eos> Kid, don't do that.<eos> Atomic batteries to power.<eos> Turbines to speed.
- Please.<eos> - Exterminate! Please.<eos> Okay, but I need all the bad guys locked up in here.<eos> I promise.<eos> And I mean all of them.<eos> One of these buttons has to save my friends.<eos> Self-destruct mode activated.<eos> Self what?<eos> - Master Dick!<eos> Dick!
Okay, but I need all the bad guys locked up in here.<eos> I promise.<eos> And I mean all of them.<eos> One of these buttons has to save my friends.<eos> Self-destruct mode activated.<eos> Self what?<eos> - Master Dick!<eos> Dick!<eos> Look who's bat!<eos> Everyone okay?
I promise.<eos> And I mean all of them.<eos> One of these buttons has to save my friends.<eos> Self-destruct mode activated.<eos> Self what?<eos> - Master Dick!<eos> Dick!<eos> Look who's bat!<eos> Everyone okay?<eos> Dick, Alfred, Barbara.
Yeah.<eos> Whoo! I did it!<eos> I don't even know why you bothered coming back.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> What?<eos> The reason I came back was the same reason I left you.<eos> I was afraid of feeling the pain you feel when you lose someone close to you.<eos> Gotham needs us.<eos> So I came back to do this.<eos> Flip.

Because saving this city is too big a job for one person.<eos> Flip, flip.<eos> So, what do you say, Commish?<eos> Will you work with me?<eos> I need your help.<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> I'm very, very proud of you, sir.<eos> But there's still only four of us against Joker's entire army.<eos> That's why I called in some backup.<eos> Flip! Flip! Flip!
These monsters want to destroy Gotham City.<eos> That's right.<eos> We need sick new vehicles.<eos> An arsenal of advanced weaponry.<eos> Costumes that suit our individual personalities.<eos> Rip!<eos> And code names to use on our walkie-talkies.<eos> Call it out!<eos> Your name is Lady Bat.<eos> - Lady Bat? - Bat Lady.

How about a cool costume?<eos> Nice!<eos> That one's called Batgirl.<eos> If you call me Batgirl, can I call you Batboy?<eos> And lastly, a coordinated attack strategy, and a kick-butt theme song!<eos> Robin?

No!<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> This music is filling me with rage.<eos> Let's use it!<eos> All right, team. I'm going to need to know your special powers.<eos> I'm a giant clay person!<eos> - I'm irritating. - I have a sack for a face.<eos> I make unpredictable decisions.<eos> I raise the stakes! I can squirt ketchup!<eos> Nice! Orca.

Robin, get ready.<eos> I'm about to teach you some father-and-son stuff.<eos> First, driving.<eos> - Put your hands at 10 and 2.<eos> - Okay. Now, fly!<eos> Turn left!<eos> Run over these skeletons.<eos> Now drive up the wall!<eos> - Great driving.<eos> - Thanks, Padre.
- Okay. Now, fly!<eos> Turn left!<eos> Run over these skeletons.<eos> Now drive up the wall!<eos> - Great driving.<eos> - Thanks, Padre.<eos> Okay, Robin.<eos> Together, we're gonna punch these guys so hard, words describing the impact are gonna spontaneously materialize out of thin air.<eos> Yeah!<eos> High five!
Now drive up the wall!<eos> - Great driving.<eos> - Thanks, Padre.<eos> Okay, Robin.<eos> Together, we're gonna punch these guys so hard, words describing the impact are gonna spontaneously materialize out of thin air.<eos> Yeah!<eos> High five!<eos> Stop moving around, you Muggles.<eos> All right, team, let's shut him down.<eos> Orca!
- Wingardium Levio... - Me-yoink!<eos> Wingardium Levio... Shut up!<eos> No!<eos> Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy!<eos> Fudgecake!<eos> Whoo! Here we go, Bat Team!<eos> Batman, think fast!<eos> Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy!<eos> Robin, go long.<eos> - Nice grab.
Welcome to the Phantom Zone, bad guy!<eos> Robin, go long.<eos> - Nice grab.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Yes! Here you go, Grandpa.<eos> Hey, Batman!<eos> Get off my padre!<eos> It wasn't useless after all.<eos> End this, Batgirl!<eos> Adiós, shark.
- Build something.<eos> - Together. - Build.<eos> - Together. Together.<eos> We should build something together.<eos> I got it.<eos> You're right, Babs.<eos> We need to stick together.<eos> Literally.<eos> Robin, quick. Give me a boost.<eos> On it, Padre.
Shredded abs.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> - Here we go. You got this, Alfred?<eos> Yes, sir. Abs of steel.<eos> Great!<eos> Now you bend, and I'll grab the other side!<eos> No!<eos> - Batman, what's going on? - Are you okay?<eos> I've got you.<eos> Joker!
Splendid!<eos> We did it, everyone!<eos> Bane is feeling warm and fuzzy.<eos> Padre, where are you going?<eos> I made a promise.<eos> I gotta go back to the Phantom Zone.<eos> Sorry, kid.<eos> Padre, please.<eos> Don't call me Padre.<eos> Okay.
Padre, please.<eos> Don't call me Padre.<eos> Okay.<eos> Call me... Dads.<eos> My two dads are the same dad.<eos> But they're both leaving.<eos> It's gonna be okay, kid.<eos> Sometimes, losing people is part of life. But that doesn't mean you stop letting them in.<eos> Some very wise people taught me that.<eos> My father figure.

Why?<eos> 'Cause someone needs to cut the tension between the two of us immediately.<eos> Okay. I deserved that.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I came back, just like I said I would.<eos> You know, Mr. Batman, when you're a talking brick, working at the Phantom Zone, you see a lot of crazy things.<eos> But I've finally seen a man, in order to make the world a better place, take a look at himself and make a change.<eos> Who?

It's you.<eos> Well, I guess I'll be seeing you on the streets, Batman.<eos> I guess so. Catch you later, Joker.<eos> Let's go, gang.<eos> Wait a minute, we're not just gonna let these criminals go, right?<eos> Ah, come on, Commish. Let's face it.<eos> Those guys are no match for the four of us.<eos> We'll give them a 30-minute head start.<eos> Besides, you can't fight crime on an empty stomach.<eos> Hey, Computer?
Those guys are no match for the four of us.<eos> We'll give them a 30-minute head start.<eos> Besides, you can't fight crime on an empty stomach.<eos> Hey, Computer?<eos> We're home!<eos> What is the password?<eos> Iron Man sucks!<eos> When Dad and me were fighting, I was giving them my best one-liners.<eos> You complete me.<eos> Holy family photo, Batman.

- Told you they were real.<eos> Did you stick wigs onto snakes?<eos> - Maybe. - That is so weird.<eos> Can I play that song I wrote for the end credits?<eos> - That is a hard pass.<eos> - Come on.<eos> No!<eos> Let the kid play whatever music he wants. - No, no, no!<eos> - Please? - No.<eos> Fine. 'Puter.

Hi. uh... guessing June doesn't work here anymore?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> I'm here to see Harold Meachum.<eos> that's not possible.<eos> I'm Danny Rand.<eos> The son of Wendell Rand.<eos> been away a long time.<eos> And you're here to see Harold Meachum?<eos> Yeah.<eos> please. - Okay.
- You're out of here.<eos> Whoa. Whoa! Hold him.<eos> I just want to talk to Harold.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where's Harold?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Ward?
Whoa. Whoa! Hold him.<eos> I just want to talk to Harold.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where's Harold?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Ward?<eos> Joy?

Ward... you need to calm down.<eos> Calm down?<eos> Are you seriously telling me to calm down?<eos> you need to back off.<eos> Keep telling me what to do... yeah?<eos> I didn't mean to... wait.<eos> I don't want to leave!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I...<eos> About time.
He attacked the guards.<eos> Serious?<eos> Blindsided our guards in the lobby.<eos> - I'm calling the police.<eos> - No.<eos> he'll be out again in a few hours. our guards will take it as a personal threat and will respond with whatever means necessary.<eos> I think you know what that means.<eos> don't do this.<eos> You're gonna feel real stupid once all this is cleared up. Come on!<eos> - You okay?
You're gonna feel real stupid once all this is cleared up. Come on!<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Still... 15 years since Danny and his parents died.<eos> This guy just shows up out of nowhere?<eos> What?<eos> You know what's weirder?<eos> He looked like Danny.<eos> Right?<eos> Joy...
- You have to.<eos> - It's the rules.<eos> Dad says rules are for pussies.<eos> Hello!<eos> we're home.<eos> - We're up here.<eos> but here comes Mommy and Daddy to protect you.<eos> And give you lots of hugs and kisses and tell you what a sweet little boy you are.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> - Ward.
It's disgusting.<eos> - Ward.<eos> - Hi.<eos> What happened here?<eos> Danny's been kind of a problem.<eos> Uh... I didn't mean to spook you.<eos> uh...<eos> I don't really spook.<eos> I'm Big Al.<eos> Danny.
What happened here?<eos> Danny's been kind of a problem.<eos> Uh... I didn't mean to spook you.<eos> uh...<eos> I don't really spook.<eos> I'm Big Al.<eos> Danny.<eos> Don't think I've seen you around here before.<eos> uh... been away a while.<eos> huh?
Uh... I didn't mean to spook you.<eos> uh...<eos> I don't really spook.<eos> I'm Big Al.<eos> Danny.<eos> Don't think I've seen you around here before.<eos> uh... been away a while.<eos> huh?<eos> Yeah. Kinda.<eos> Nice iPod.
Look up Danny Rand.<eos> yeah.<eos> There was a kid.<eos> I... I remember this.<eos> The whole family died in a plane crash.<eos> is that the one you're talking about?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anybody else?<eos> Look up Harold Meachum.<eos> another dead guy.
You know him?<eos> Yeah. Sort of.<eos> You know... you can get shoes at the shelter on East 13th.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Just make sure you piss in 'em first.<eos> they carry the bad juju from the previous owner.<eos> Only way to get rid of 'em is with your piss.<eos> that's hard to find around here.<eos> What?<eos> uh...
I've been waiting to talk to you.<eos> It... It really is me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you. which means he's going to be pulling around the corner any second he's also my guard.<eos> hey...<eos> And I will make sure that you're arrested.<eos> And I will see that your case goes to trial and that you are convicted of malicious harassment and sent to jail for the maximum time.<eos> it's... We used to be friends.<eos> It's me.<eos> Daniel Thomas Rand.

Colleen Wing.<eos> speak English or Japanese.<eos> I haven't spoken Mandarin since I was a kid.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was just wondering if... maybe I could get a job with you.<eos> I've already got someone who cleans up.<eos> wait. I meant...<eos> - See ya.<eos> So... the guy is still around.<eos> - What guy?

I meant...<eos> - See ya.<eos> So... the guy is still around.<eos> - What guy?<eos> - The Danny Rand wannabe.
He's playing on our emotions.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause we lost a friend when Danny died. walked into our office all these years later?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Or do you really think the timing is coincidental?<eos> Right when we're about to announce our expansion in China?<eos> Someone walks in who potentially owns 51% of the company.<eos> the perception... is there's a leadership struggle.<eos> - And who gains from this?<eos> - Our competition.
I know.<eos> I thought you might be hungry.<eos> - Thanks. - Yeah.<eos> Chicken parm.<eos> The Italian deli on Bleecker.<eos> They throw 'em out at the end of the night.<eos> Plenty of food if you know where to look.<eos> That's where it all went wrong.<eos> Where all what went wrong?<eos> All mankind.
I'm asking you... nicely... one last time.<eos> Please go.<eos> I apologize for any inconvenience.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're the security guard from Rand.<eos> Why are you...<eos> Go.<eos> Who sent you? Who sent you?<eos> Ward Meachum.<eos> Shannon.
I think it can wait until the morning.<eos> Of course.<eos> Right away.<eos> Dad.<eos> The Chinese yuan is gonna drop.<eos> - It's gonna affect our expansion there.<eos> - I'll take care of it.<eos> like you're taking care of the Danny Rand situation?<eos> How do you even know about that?<eos> Shit.
I expect more of you. That's all.<eos> Is he here all the time now?<eos> How much does he know?<eos> - What does it matter?<eos> - I think you know why it matters.<eos> try to learn from me. to build their lives around.<eos> Pay 'em twice what they're worth.<eos> It builds loyalty.<eos> It's something I learned from Wendell. Sure.<eos> Kyle.
No.<eos> Can we finally talk?<eos> Okay. and I can touch one button and have a guard here.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> So... what makes you think Ward tried to kill you?<eos> sounds preposterous.<eos> Your security guy came after me.<eos> With two other guys.<eos> - With guns.<eos> - Shannon?
You look like Danny Rand.<eos> Danny Rand is dead.<eos> Maybe the truth is somewhere in between.<eos> If you wish to see the truth... then hold no opinions.<eos> It's a Zen saying.<eos> then...<eos> I guess I should call you Danny?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Please.<eos> Danny.
too. Why don't you go first?<eos> It's... it's all kind of crazy.<eos> I don't even know where to start.<eos> why don't you just start at the beginning?<eos> We were in our jet.<eos> Flying over the Himalayas.<eos> Then... things started to... to go bad.<eos> We were flying too low.<eos> uh... um... um... uh...<eos> You...
Why would you...<eos> Looks like he had another one of those episodes.<eos> Better to let him sleep.<eos> Danny.<eos> It's gonna be okay!<eos> Danny!<eos> - Dad!<eos> my God!<eos> stay in your seat.<eos> Heather!
Danny.<eos> It's gonna be okay!<eos> Danny!<eos> - Dad!<eos> my God!<eos> stay in your seat.<eos> Heather!<eos> Danny.<eos> Mom!<eos> Heather!
And I think I know exactly how.<eos> You need to kill yourself.<eos> It's really the only solution for any of us.<eos> I mean, look, I have tried four times, and they keep saving me.<eos> Do it now, while you have a chance.<eos> Just give me the go-ahead, and it's done.<eos> Was that a nod?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Simon... no!
You need to let me out of here.<eos> Well, it's either here or jail.<eos> But I have you for 72 hours, so I think we should make the most of it.<eos> Can... can you at least unstrap me?<eos> Are you gonna behave?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's start with this...<eos> Let's find out what's going on.<eos> First off, what's your name?<eos> Danny Rand.
You must have been cold.<eos> I was cold.<eos> But I could see pieces of the plane scattered over the mountainside. I...<eos> I had to go and check.<eos> I found the cockpit first.<eos> Both pilots were dead.<eos> Then I found the main fuselage.<eos> My dad was inside.<eos> I love you, Danny.<eos> Wendell Rand?
I love you, Danny.<eos> Wendell Rand?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And he was dead, too?<eos> What about your mother?<eos> Was she there, too?<eos> No.<eos> No? Where was she?<eos> Stay in your seat.<eos> Heather...
So what did you do?<eos> I didn't want to leave my dad.<eos> But I was so cold.<eos> I was thirsty, hungry.<eos> I... I had to try.<eos> Try what?<eos> To survive.<eos> I stepped out, but the... the snow was so deep, the wind, I...<eos> I kept on falling, and... suddenly I looked up, and... there were these two men standing above me.<eos> Chodak and Tashi.
This is your passport, isn't it?<eos> That's your picture.<eos> John Anderson of Toronto, Canada.<eos> I've never seen that before.<eos> If you want out of here... you're gonna have to start being honest with me.<eos> We'll talk about this some more.<eos> You might want to sound a little less<eos> - like a...<eos> - You guys are no good!<eos> ...like a fat duck, Darryl.
You might want to sound a little less<eos> - like a...<eos> - You guys are no good!<eos> ...like a fat duck, Darryl.<eos> I could hear those feet slapping on the sidewalk a block away.<eos> Yes, sensei. My shoes are too big.<eos> I could smell your garlic breath before you walked out your door.<eos> Sorry, sensei.<eos> And what the hell was that, Jenny? What are you doing?<eos> Yoga?
I could smell your garlic breath before you walked out your door.<eos> Sorry, sensei.<eos> And what the hell was that, Jenny? What are you doing?<eos> Yoga?<eos> You move about as fast as a pig... swimming in gravy.<eos> I can't.<eos> If I say anything, I'll just end up crying.<eos> This was a fail, guys.<eos> These exercises are about trying to teach you how to perform in the real world, so... do better.<eos> You ready?
And Jimmy was screaming at people in Times Square.<eos> Seventy-two hours later, he's a schizoaffective disorder.<eos> He's been here almost 15 years.<eos> Don't think you'll be any different.<eos> I need to get out of here.<eos> Yeah. Well, we all want out.<eos> That's why they dope us every eight hours until we are just mindless donkeys.<eos> Who you calling donkey?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> My mistake.
Do you have any family you can call?<eos> No.<eos> Friends?<eos> Is there a phone I can use?<eos> I'm not supposed to do this, but what are they going to do?<eos> Put me in the nut house?<eos> - Chikara Dojo.<eos> - Hey...<eos> - It's Danny.<eos> - Who?
No.<eos> Friends?<eos> Is there a phone I can use?<eos> I'm not supposed to do this, but what are they going to do?<eos> Put me in the nut house?<eos> - Chikara Dojo.<eos> - Hey...<eos> - It's Danny.<eos> - Who?<eos> Danny.
No, Colleen... you are the only person who can help me.<eos> Really, I'm sorry.<eos> No, please...<eos> Dad.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> ...suddenly I looked up, and there were these...<eos> You put cameras in there?<eos> It's the 21st century.<eos> We're all connected.<eos> Chodak and Tashi.
I just don't think...<eos> I'll give you some time to think about it.<eos> You'd be doing us a great favor.<eos> Bit of money would really... bring this place up a notch.<eos> Come in.<eos> I was gonna show you this later, but since you're already here...<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a commercial I found from about 15 years ago.<eos> ...understanding that the most important products are the ones that power lives...<eos> - That boy...
Some happier world.<eos> Right after we shot this, we all went to the circus in Madison Square Garden.<eos> I didn't want to do the commercial.<eos> It's how Dad talked me into it.<eos> The circus.<eos> The acrobats were amazing.<eos> And I sat next to my mom.<eos> Joy was on the other side.<eos> We had popcorn.<eos> John Anderson.
And this guy here, he's not asking the right questions.<eos> Sorry...<eos> Oh, you can't help yourself, can you?<eos> You know what my dad used to do?<eos> Whenever I messed up, which... according to my dad was pretty much all the time, he'd... whip me across the back with his belt.<eos> And with each... I'd have to apologize... for forcing him to exert himself.<eos> God, I miss him.<eos> But now... I don't apologize for anything.<eos> Kyle, get the car ready tonight.<eos> - The car?
And with each... I'd have to apologize... for forcing him to exert himself.<eos> God, I miss him.<eos> But now... I don't apologize for anything.<eos> Kyle, get the car ready tonight.<eos> - The car?<eos> - Yeah, the thing with the four wheels.<eos> Yes, sir, it's just... you never leave the penthouse.<eos> Oh, I'm thinking it's time.<eos> Okay, put him on.<eos> Uh, Joy Meachum?
Uh, okay.<eos> Uh, years ago, when you were about ten years old, you did a commercial for Rand?<eos> Yeah. "We are Rand."<eos> Anything else stick out about that day?<eos> They put me in a stupid dress.<eos> It was cold out.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you do anything afterwards?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> The circus.
Yeah. Yeah, it was Danny's idea.<eos> He didn't want to do the commercial, and his parents had to bribe him.<eos> I remember because he wanted to be an acrobat after that.<eos> He was always jumping around.<eos> Okay. Well, uh, thank you.<eos> That's it?<eos> Yeah, it was... it was an odd question.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I'm afraid I can't really say.<eos> Patient confidentiality.
That's it?<eos> Yeah, it was... it was an odd question.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I'm afraid I can't really say.<eos> Patient confidentiality.<eos> Well, now you have me curious.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Wish I could say more.<eos> Hello, Danny.<eos> Harold?
I thought you were dead.<eos> And I thought you were dead, so I guess that's something we have in common.<eos> I didn't die.<eos> No, clearly not.<eos> Uh, I understand you were... taken in by some monks.<eos> What? Order of the, uh, Crane Mother?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How did you know?<eos> Oh, we dead know a lot.<eos> But not everything.
At least I understood my place there.<eos> Oh, and what was your place?<eos> I was a warrior.<eos> Only in the middle of a fight did I fully come alive.<eos> The harder someone hit me, the... the more everything came into focus.<eos> What kind of warrior are you?<eos> Hey, listen to me.<eos> What do you mean you're a warrior?<eos> I became one in a long line... of Immortal Iron Fists.<eos> Living Weapon.
You said it's probably not him.<eos> Yeah. Probably not.<eos> Well, if it is him, he's going about proving it in a really strange way.<eos> Honestly, what other options does he have?<eos> I need to have these messengered somewhere.<eos> Hi.<eos> Me again.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but I was hoping we could make a trade.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What kind of trade?
If you sign these... then... I will leave you this.<eos> - $50,000?<eos> - You could do a lot with that.<eos> This must be very important to you.<eos> It is.<eos> If I sign this, then what do you do?<eos> I just want everyone to be safe.<eos> My sister, you, myself, even the man in question.<eos> With your backing, I can assure that he gets the long-term help that he needs.<eos> Heather!

And to me?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> You must know that.<eos> Otherwise, why would you come here to see me?<eos> I don't know shit.<eos> I'm trying to figure out what's going on.<eos> Every word I have ever told you is the truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. But, really, I can't be involved in this.<eos> Okay.
You must know that.<eos> Otherwise, why would you come here to see me?<eos> I don't know shit.<eos> I'm trying to figure out what's going on.<eos> Every word I have ever told you is the truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. But, really, I can't be involved in this.<eos> Okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> Uh, just one last favor.

That supposed to mean something?<eos> Yes.<eos> When... when we were kids... we would eat them together.<eos> Nobody would know that but Danny.<eos> Joy, I'm sorry, but a bunch of MM's doesn't prove anything.<eos> It does.<eos> This is Danny, Ward.<eos> I have been in denial this whole time, but this is definite proof.<eos> We gotta get him out of that place. We've... we've got to talk to him.<eos> No, Joy.
It does.<eos> This is Danny, Ward.<eos> I have been in denial this whole time, but this is definite proof.<eos> We gotta get him out of that place. We've... we've got to talk to him.<eos> No, Joy.<eos> Not now.<eos> We've already discussed this.<eos> Whoever he is, he is in a safe place right now.<eos> The best thing to do is wait until we get a full report from the doctors there, and then we can consider our next step.<eos> Ward, no...
When you were a kid, where did you go to school?<eos> Um... down the hall to our library.<eos> I was homeschooled. My, uh... my mom taught me.<eos> Any other teachers?<eos> There was, uh, Mrs. Valdez for art.<eos> Mrs. Krol for music.<eos> Mr. Miller, PE.<eos> How does this make sense?<eos> How does what make sense?<eos> Danny...
It only appears on this earthly plane every 15 years... give or take, depending on the celestial tilt.<eos> Is this all a part of you trying to focus your chi?<eos> Yeah.<eos> If I can focus my chi, then I can summon the Iron Fist.<eos> And the Iron Fist is...<eos> The Iron Fist is... It's me.<eos> Can I go now?<eos> Are you Danny Rand, or are you the Iron Fist?<eos> I'm... I'm both.<eos> Danny...
Can I go now?<eos> Are you Danny Rand, or are you the Iron Fist?<eos> I'm... I'm both.<eos> Danny...<eos> I believe you've been through some great trauma.<eos> Your plane crashed.<eos> You lost your parents You barely survived yourself.<eos> And I'm guessing things didn't get better after that.<eos> I believe all that.<eos> But the rest...
I can't.<eos> Not... not until you take me off these drugs.<eos> What I'd like for you to do... is to open yourself to the possibility that there is no Iron Fist.<eos> Just... Danny Rand.<eos> A young man... who suffered an unspeakable tragedy.<eos> We'll talk about this tomorrow.<eos> Looks like more people are beginning to realize this is the real Danny Rand.<eos> I found nothing on Iron Fist.<eos> There's a beer named Iron Fist, a clothing line, but nothing helpful.<eos> A mystery.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.<eos> Looks like more people are beginning to realize this is the real Danny Rand.<eos> I found nothing on Iron Fist.<eos> There's a beer named Iron Fist, a clothing line, but nothing helpful.<eos> A mystery.<eos> As it stands, purchasing this property will provide an inroad to domestic production, which will prove very valuable down the line.<eos> If you take a look at the prospectus...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry, I have to take this.<eos> - What?
Still... he never should have gotten that close.<eos> You mean like this?<eos> and not external strength.<eos> So it's not necessary to use charging momentum.<eos> Which lowers the risk of moving in.<eos> You're working too hard.<eos> Too much external force.<eos> It's internal force you want to master.<eos> And you should master silence.<eos> Leopard Punch.
Like you see on the building.<eos> so...<eos> I'll have all this solved by Friday.<eos> Door included.<eos> Then... Then I can pay you an entire year's rent.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> - Friday?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> whatever.
Then... Then I can pay you an entire year's rent.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> - Friday?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> whatever.<eos> But you sleep in that corner.<eos> And you don't go anywhere near the students.<eos> And... use the bathroom at Starbucks.<eos> Okay.
Why do we care about that crappy pier?<eos> Just... please?<eos> You used to come to my room when we were kids and ask me to do your homework with that same line.<eos> And I passed calculus because of it.<eos> I don't see the problem.<eos> Just send me the goddamned files.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know... this would have been romantic.<eos> you wouldn't have drugged me and sent me to a mental hospital.<eos> Fair enough.
Thank you.<eos> You know... this would have been romantic.<eos> you wouldn't have drugged me and sent me to a mental hospital.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> We're friends.<eos> Can't we start acting like it?<eos> So you came with a peace offering of... oranges and flowers?<eos> it's a Buddhist tradition.<eos> It's meant to remind you of our bond.<eos> Kind of like the MM's.
and he'd take my hand just as I passed the gate.<eos> And then the dream would end.<eos> But his smile...<eos> I must have had that dream a hundred times.<eos> too.<eos> When?<eos> In the hospital.<eos> I... I thought he was a hungry ghost.<eos> The people from where I'm from believe these ghosts... wander because they've been neglected by their family.<eos> Danny... no.
I... I thought he was a hungry ghost.<eos> The people from where I'm from believe these ghosts... wander because they've been neglected by their family.<eos> Danny... no.<eos> I know.<eos> It sounds weird.<eos> The drugs they had me on were intense.<eos> Yeah? Huh.<eos> But it even smelled like him.<eos> right?<eos> Marc Jacobs.
Danny... no.<eos> I know.<eos> It sounds weird.<eos> The drugs they had me on were intense.<eos> Yeah? Huh.<eos> But it even smelled like him.<eos> right?<eos> Marc Jacobs.<eos> You mind if we go inside?<eos> Yeah.
but I got him to go higher.<eos> Just think of all you could do with that.<eos> I have to change my name?<eos> The world already thinks Danny Rand is dead.<eos> Let's just leave it that way.<eos> You can pick a name you love.<eos> You can start all over.<eos> It is gonna be great.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> - Danny...
It is gonna be great.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> - Danny...<eos> - Is this how you treat family?<eos> it is.<eos> the generosity of this offer speaks for itself.<eos> but Ward and I worked for this money.<eos> while you were off doing... whatever you were doing.<eos> So... don't turn your nose up...<eos> Danny...
right?<eos> - No.<eos> Come on. You were an intern in the legal department in my dad's office?<eos> You called his secretary Margaret a hatchet-faced bitch.<eos> I was standing right there.<eos> You gave me five bucks to keep quiet.<eos> Where was my office?<eos> Um... you didn't have one.<eos> They put you in the copy room.<eos> My desk?
other than coming to me.<eos> Danny.<eos> Not millions.<eos> It seems like that's all anyone wants to talk about.<eos> Because it's the only language that they speak.<eos> And it is important that you learn to understand it if you want to win.<eos> They're supposed to be my friends. but I cannot help you make friends.<eos> Okay.<eos> so... what's it gonna cost me?<eos> Nothing.
They're supposed to be my friends. but I cannot help you make friends.<eos> Okay.<eos> so... what's it gonna cost me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> my firm is on permanent retainer for Rand.<eos> Deal?<eos> Deal.<eos> We have a suite set up for occasions like this.<eos> I need you to lay low... and I need you to keep from drawing any attention to yourself.<eos> uh...
Sit this one out.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Too important.<eos> but you cannot be a drag tonight.<eos> We're doing something unusual and I can't have you screwing it up.<eos> Am I that big a problem?<eos> You've got a nice smile.<eos> Use it.<eos> Just as an experiment maybe.<eos> Raj!

Hmm. Man after my own heart.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let me pour this.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Ward?<eos> what's on the agenda?<eos> A night you will never forget.<eos> I like the sound of that.<eos> - There you go. Good. - Yeah.<eos> - Good! Good!

There's... there's an impostor trying to infiltrate the company.<eos> A young man claiming to be Danny Rand.<eos> I needed to see for myself.<eos> And?<eos> It's not going to be a problem.<eos> We have an agreement.<eos> You must honor it to the letter or there will be consequences.<eos> I... I understand.<eos> - Kneel.<eos> - What?

Who put you in charge?<eos> or are you training warriors?<eos> I am trying to provide a safe place for people.<eos> Half the kids out there get beaten on a regular basis by family or bullies.<eos> until now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know you're in a bind.<eos> Having a tough time.<eos> But you can't be here.<eos> Sensei.
We'll get there.<eos> But first things first.<eos> you're gonna like this.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> this is starting to creep me out.<eos> Meet Kevin Kennedy.<eos> On life support following an auto accident for over a year.<eos> He weighed 185 and has O negative blood.<eos> In 30 minutes... Kevin's family will enter this room with a priest who will say last rites before the doctor takes him off life support and he dies.<eos> - Joy...
I know.<eos> But... people have been known to start over... with nothing.<eos> aren't you?<eos> I'm tired... of a lot of things.<eos> I'd miss you.<eos> So you wouldn't come with me?<eos> I love Rand.<eos> If it's not like that for you... that's fine.<eos> You know I back you no matter what.<eos> Right?
doctors' visits...<eos> Didn't you at least have a library card?<eos> Uh... yeah. Sure.<eos> too.<eos> of course. and I don't like that.<eos> Is there anything you didn't tell me?<eos> Something you might have missed?<eos> Maybe.<eos> uh... can you help me?<eos> sure.
Something you might have missed?<eos> Maybe.<eos> uh... can you help me?<eos> sure.<eos> What do you need?<eos> uh... just looking for an X-ray from a visit when I was a kid.<eos> I don't know. Do you have a date?<eos> 2001.<eos> uh... I broke my arm skateboarding.<eos> sure.
uh... just looking for an X-ray from a visit when I was a kid.<eos> I don't know. Do you have a date?<eos> 2001.<eos> uh... I broke my arm skateboarding.<eos> sure.<eos> The X-rays from that period are on that shelf to your right.<eos> too.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'd like to take a look.<eos> Danny. Danny... really.
sure.<eos> The X-rays from that period are on that shelf to your right.<eos> too.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'd like to take a look.<eos> Danny. Danny... really.<eos> Trying to get my head around all this.<eos> This is not the time or the place.<eos> You were like a brother to me.<eos> but still...
honey?<eos> I dare ya.<eos> I like it when you talk dirty.<eos> then.<eos> We got any challengers?<eos> huh?<eos> Anybody wanna take on the little lady?<eos> uh... that's not fair.<eos> I paid my entry fee same as her.<eos> Leon?
I dare ya.<eos> I like it when you talk dirty.<eos> then.<eos> We got any challengers?<eos> huh?<eos> Anybody wanna take on the little lady?<eos> uh... that's not fair.<eos> I paid my entry fee same as her.<eos> Leon?<eos> All right.
Please do.<eos> we have had a change of heart. we have decided to lower our offer to 20 million... and added a restraining order.<eos> The restraining order is a nice touch.<eos> I thought so.<eos> we have had a change of heart as well. and a housing allowance in the amount of one million per year.<eos> but come on.<eos> You can't even prove he's who he says he is.<eos> at worst he's a con man.<eos> Take the offer and be thankful that we don't sue you.<eos> Ward...
I dedicate myself to the service of all beings of K'un-Lun... you're awake.<eos> What is this place?<eos> What happened to me?<eos> I was climbing up... like goddamn Daredevil.<eos> Why'd you follow me?<eos> - You kicked me off the building?<eos> - Of course I did.<eos> It's what you do when you see someone trying to break in.<eos> You are really pushing the limits of karma.<eos> boys.

Your visit...<eos> - it wasn't a hallucination.<eos> - No.<eos> I had to see for myself.<eos> protect Rand.<eos> it's not every day that someone comes back from the dead.<eos> Is it?<eos> But here we are.<eos> So... are we good?<eos> Danny?
- Just like that?<eos> - No.<eos> what they failed to tell me was that I had to die first.<eos> I still remember my last breath.<eos> Scariest shit I've ever experienced.<eos> And three days later... I'm breathing again.<eos> who saved you?<eos> you mentioned these people during your stay at the hospital.<eos> - You called them the Hand.<eos> - The Hand?
while we're at it.<eos> Ward.<eos> Danny.<eos> Where should I start?<eos> What's the Hand doing in Rand?<eos> that's unclear.<eos> I've only... ever met a couple representatives of the... of the Hand.<eos> they show up in my home whenever they want with their demands.<eos> only recently they... where... where was it?<eos> Red Hook.

Be careful.<eos> He's not a replacement for your dad.<eos> The only person Harold cares about is Harold.<eos> watch this.<eos> Boom! - Sensei Wing knocked the shit out of him!<eos> - Right.<eos> You know the rules about cell phones in my dojo.<eos> Line up.<eos> Make seiza.<eos> Darryl.
Um... uh... it's been a long road to get back home.<eos> And that's what Rand is to me.<eos> Home. instilled in me a love and respect for this company that has never faded.<eos> on a jet with my parents.<eos> We never reached our destination. and I became the lone survivor. a much different life to what I had here in New York.<eos> Ultimately... it taught me the value of life... of hard work... of never giving up on the things that matter to me.<eos> And Rand matters.<eos> Mr. Rand?<eos> yes.<eos> New York Bulletin.
- Thank you. - Danny.<eos> That answer was much kinder than we deserved.<eos> Kindness is the eternal law.<eos> have you got time to go through that pier deal you put through?<eos> The pier?<eos> Why?<eos> uh... just trying to get my bearings.<eos> Um... just check with our assistant Megan.<eos> She'll set something up.<eos> Megan.
uh... just trying to get my bearings.<eos> Um... just check with our assistant Megan.<eos> She'll set something up.<eos> Megan.<eos> set up a meeting with Joy.<eos> I'll check her schedule.<eos> We should be able to squeeze you in sometime in the next two or three days.<eos> Three days?<eos> your first appointment of the day is here.<eos> cool.

This is crazy.<eos> Man... what are you doing?<eos> uh... I used to stick stickers under my dad's desk.<eos> They're still there.<eos> Of course you did. what do you say we get to work?<eos> I have never seen a deal come together so fast.<eos> What did you do?<eos> pretty much had to raise the dead.<eos> let's get you signing these before anybody changes their minds.<eos> Okay.
you don't actually hold a position here.<eos> let me...<eos> let me explain.<eos> you hold the most dominant position on the board.<eos> So as much as you don't have a say in the day-to-day business...<eos> - My voice will still be heard.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Do you think we can get access to the Rand business accounts and records?<eos> with your name and your holdings... shouldn't be much you can't access.<eos> Word to the wise?

It's wrong.<eos> We need to sell the drug at cost.<eos> Period. drawing a line in the sand on your first day?<eos> Yes.<eos> This is ridiculous. we'll do it.<eos> We'll go to market at cost.<eos> Thank you.<eos> my schedule cleared up.<eos> Do you wanna go talk about that pier deal?<eos> sure. - Yeah?

This isn't the time to point fingers.<eos> It's the time for solutions.<eos> Can I count on you to handle this reporter?<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> taking care of this will more than make up for that drug pricing screw-up this afternoon.<eos> Joy is keeping Danny busy.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> That's what I like to hear.<eos> son.<eos> Megan!
you double my payday.<eos> you know that?<eos> But I like you.<eos> You ready for the fight of your life?<eos> You better be!<eos> Because the Daughter of the Dragon has returned!<eos> But... she doesn't think the Duke here... is enough of a challenge. she wants a little two-on-one action.<eos> And I got just the guy for her.<eos> you still here?<eos> Jimmy! Jimmy!
I facilitated its purchase.<eos> for chief counsel to... buy things without knowing why?<eos> I don't really need to know the "why.<eos> Ward's leadership has led Rand to success after success and...<eos> Why are you so interested in this?<eos> When I got to the... post-crash... - Mmm-hmm.<eos> I learned of a certain position. and I wanted it.<eos> Your dad always said to set your goals high.<eos> Yeah. said there was no way a xiaoguilao like me could do it.<eos> uh... an outsider.

Sure.
I don't know.<eos> Another guy living in a deluxe apartment?<eos> - You want a drink?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You know how to make a vodka tonic?<eos> yeah.<eos> I think I can handle it.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> light on the tonic.<eos> Danny!
- Yes.<eos> You know how to make a vodka tonic?<eos> yeah.<eos> I think I can handle it.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> light on the tonic.<eos> Danny!<eos> Back to the Golden Sands.<eos> Go!<eos> - You okay? Yeah?

I have an early morning deadline.<eos> don't give the front page to Karen.<eos> I've got a hell of a story for tomorrow.<eos> - What happened to you?<eos> - What happened to you?<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> uh... Can you keep an eye on Joy for me?<eos> Wasn't he stalking you?<eos> - It was a misunderstanding.<eos> - Right.

can I help you?<eos> we're closed.<eos> I need to speak to the head of the Yangshi Gongsi.<eos> I don't want any trouble.<eos> Then you should not come looking for it.<eos> He's the one.<eos> This one bested all of you?<eos> I am Yang Hai-Qing... head of the Yangshi Gongsi.<eos> And you are?<eos> - Danny Rand.

We wanted words with her.<eos> No.<eos> You wanted to kidnap Joy to broker a new deal.<eos> Maybe we should use you to broker a new deal.<eos> Is this why you walk into my place?<eos> I'm here to let you know it's not within your best interests to come near Joy ever again.<eos> Why is Rand so determined to keep the pier all to itself?<eos> another group of people forced us to purchase it.<eos> Who could force a giant business like Rand to do anything?<eos> The Hand.
- We just had a talk.<eos> This talk happen with your fists?<eos> it's... more of a sharing of ideas.<eos> um... we came to an agreement.<eos> What... what are you doing?<eos> Joy?<eos> This ain't my first rodeo?<eos> I can pop it back into place.<eos> Easy. my shifu would make me count to three in Mandarin before he would fix it.<eos> Yee...

Easy. my shifu would make me count to three in Mandarin before he would fix it.<eos> Yee...<eos> Shit!<eos> if this is about fighting for cash...<eos> I'm not judging.<eos> I used to fight in a few illegal fight clubs on my way back from K'un-Lun.<eos> But just so you know... I'm more than willing to pay up on our previous deal.<eos> I still owe you rent for six months.<eos> Answer is the same.<eos> though.
I still owe you rent for six months.<eos> Answer is the same.<eos> though.<eos> let's make a move.<eos> - See you around. - Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So how are we gonna tell Ward?<eos> He finds out men with hatchets attacked his sister?<eos> I thought you said you didn't want the cops involved.<eos> good point.
receive your reward.<eos> I haven't seen her in person since she was a child.<eos> Someone hit my daughter?<eos> My people said she had a run-in with some criminals.<eos> She's lucky she has such a talented bodyguard.<eos> She's fine now.<eos> Could this good and faithful servant ask for one more favor?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Which one of you hit Joy Meachum?<eos> Me.
Is that heroin?<eos> You bring drugs in my office?<eos> I had to find out what we're dealing with.<eos> What makes you think this has anything to do with us?<eos> Hai-Qing Yang.<eos> He's head of the Yang Clan Company.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The Yang Clan Company.<eos> It's a front.<eos> - For what?
When we bought it, we shut them out.<eos> Now, they got pretty angry, but don't worry, I cleared it up.<eos> - Hatchet Men? - Yes.<eos> I asked Hai-Qing what the Hand wanted with the pier, and then they sent me a box.<eos> This was inside.<eos> It's a message.<eos> Do you know how crazy this sounds?<eos> It's not.<eos> Look at the symbol on the bag.<eos> - A snake?
It's not.<eos> Look at the symbol on the bag.<eos> - A snake?<eos> - It's not a snake.<eos> It's the symbol for Shou-Lao the Undying.<eos> The Undying?<eos> From K'un-Lun.<eos> Shou-Lao made me a living weapon.<eos> Okay, now you've lost me.<eos> - The dragon.

Okay.<eos> Let me make this simple.<eos> The Hand is using our company to smuggle synthetic heroin into the city.<eos> We need to stop it.<eos> Harold said so himself.<eos> You were there.<eos> And you've figured all of this out because some Chinese dude left a box at your door?<eos> Yes.<eos> No.<eos> - But Harold...
And you've figured all of this out because some Chinese dude left a box at your door?<eos> Yes.<eos> No.<eos> - But Harold...<eos> - That's between the two of you.<eos> I have real business in the real world to deal with.<eos> Fine.<eos> - I'll leave you to it then.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Megan?
- Could you tell me that?<eos> - No.<eos> Mmm. But if you like, I can call Sarah Galvin in Transport and have her bring that information to you.<eos> I'm on my way down now, anyway.<eos> She's right off the elevator on the fourth floor.<eos> I'll let her know you're coming.<eos> I'm so glad we had this talk.<eos> - Going to lunch.<eos> - Yes, Mr. Meachum.<eos> Me, too.
That's the last thing a control freak wants to hear.<eos> I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Mr. Rand?<eos> Sorry, do I know you?<eos> I read about that drug thing you did in the paper.<eos> You have the power to change things at this company.<eos> That's why I... I wanted to show you this.<eos> My son.<eos> That's his fourth-grade photo.<eos> Class picture day.
My son.<eos> That's his fourth-grade photo.<eos> Class picture day.<eos> He has cancer.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> He got it from the Rand chemical plant near where we live.<eos> It's spewing poison into the air, the ground, all around us.<eos> - I didn't know. I...<eos> - You're different than the others.<eos> Compassionate.
I am so sorry.<eos> We'll make this right.<eos> Okay, switch left.<eos> Okay, push kicks.<eos> Try that again.<eos> Use your hips more.<eos> Better.<eos> Oh, what was that?<eos> Come on, hit me.<eos> Okay. Okay. Okay.
Well, for what it's worth... I've never had a student progress as fast as you have.<eos> Guess I got tired of people doing things for me all the time.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> In that case, we better keep practicing.<eos> You're Danny Rand, right?<eos> I've seen you on the news.<eos> Talk about a riches-to-rags-to-riches story.<eos> Yeah, it's been pretty crazy.<eos> You live in this city long enough, nothing surprises you anymore.<eos> Um... one sec.

You live in this city long enough, nothing surprises you anymore.<eos> Um... one sec.<eos> Hi, Danny.<eos> Need something?<eos> I, uh, just wanted to have a talk with you.<eos> Well, um, it'll have to wait till I'm done.<eos> Oh, but I ordered takeout.<eos> You what?<eos> Sorry. I'm in the middle of a lesson.<eos> - Claire Temple. - Hey.
Well, um, it'll have to wait till I'm done.<eos> Oh, but I ordered takeout.<eos> You what?<eos> Sorry. I'm in the middle of a lesson.<eos> - Claire Temple. - Hey.<eos> How do you know each other?<eos> - Oh, well, um... she... - We... we don't really...<eos> She gave me a couple of bucks when I lived in the park.<eos> I see.<eos> Oh, what the...
She gave me a couple of bucks when I lived in the park.<eos> I see.<eos> Oh, what the...<eos> Excuse me, hi.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> I told you, I ordered takeout.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You cannot just show up here with all of this stuff expecting some...<eos> - Is this a date?<eos> - What?

And that requires candlelight?<eos> This was my dad's favorite place.<eos> It's the only takeout I know.<eos> Smells good.<eos> You know, I'd be thrilled to spend the rest of my session just joining the two of you.<eos> I've never had takeout like this before.<eos> - Oh, the thing is, it's... - A great idea.<eos> It's a really, really good idea.<eos> You're different than the others.<eos> Compassionate.
Thank you.<eos> To the precious Buddha, the unsurpassable teacher.<eos> To the precious dharma, the unsurpassable protection.<eos> To the precious sangha, the unsurpassable guides.<eos> To you three rare and supreme sources of refuge, I offer.<eos> So when you were at that monastery, could you get a burger, or was it all just vegetarian crap?<eos> We only ate vegetables we grew in the monastery.<eos> But sometimes I'd sneak out with my friend Davos.<eos> We'd, uh, go eat some donkey.<eos> Donkey?
The way was closed.<eos> I had to wait for it to open again.<eos> So you said you wanted to talk about something?<eos> Yeah, I, um...<eos> I just... I don't really know where to start.<eos> I would love to stick around and hear more, but I've gotta get going.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> Um, do you mind?<eos> No, take whatever you want.<eos> Cool?

Um, do you mind?<eos> No, take whatever you want.<eos> Cool?<eos> Namaste.<eos> See ya.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> It's Rand.<eos> Some bad people have gotten on the inside.<eos> Criminals.
They'll boycott our products.<eos> If there is one thing that we can all agree on, it's that my brother has never given us a reason to doubt him.<eos> Look at his track record.<eos> Every decision has been impeccable.<eos> I may not always see it at the time, but he has never once failed this company.<eos> If we can trust Ward, we can trust this is a risk worth taking.<eos> Shall we have the vote?<eos> Awesome.<eos> I think I may lose my lunch watching you disgrace my katana with your wuxia bullshit.<eos> All right.
Show me your style.<eos> You're pretty good.<eos> It's just meant to be used the Japanese way.<eos> Check this out.<eos> You're amazing.<eos> Play time's over.<eos> Let's get going. We need your phone to take pics.<eos> - You got it?<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> Everything all right?
My phone was on silent for meditation.<eos> The office has been calling.<eos> Are we doing this or what?<eos> Lead the way.<eos> Daniel Rand's miraculous return to Rand Enterprises is making headlines once again after a video where he apologizes for a corporate scandal puts the fate of the company at stake.<eos> Suck on that, Dad.<eos> A spokesperson for the class action suit claimed that Rand Enterprises callously turned a blind eye when it was brought to their attention that a chemical plant may have been responsible for 15 cases of cancer in a Staten Island neighborhood, endangering the lives of innocent children.<eos> Better put that hood up.<eos> - Does it bother you?<eos> - What?
Scared me.<eos> Yeah, well, the world hasn't exactly been kind to us.<eos> But maybe doing something like this...<eos> Walk where I walk, and they'll never see us.<eos> Come here.<eos> Thanks for doing this.<eos> Don't thank me yet.<eos> It's just nice having someone to count on.<eos> You have the Meachums.<eos> Joy...
If it sounded like I was prying earlier, I apologize.<eos> I'm not good at this stuff.<eos> What stuff?<eos> Talking.<eos> If it helps... I don't even know what I'm doing or saying until it's taken the wrong way, so...<eos> I'm sorry if I misread your intentions with the takeout.<eos> As Lord Tuan says,<eos> "One never really knows one's own true intentions."<eos> Hey, we need to get closer.<eos> All right.

Open 'em up.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Supplies?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Danny.<eos> Look, we're on the right track, okay?<eos> Trust me.<eos> It's just more equipment.<eos> Why would they need guns unless they have something to hide?<eos> All right.

- Is he shot?<eos> - He's been stabbed.<eos> We need to get him to a hospital.<eos> Jump in.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I'm a wanted man in several countries... unless they find me first.<eos> If we don't help him, he's gonna die.<eos> We know a nurse.<eos> I'm sure you're aware of this. That video has gone viral.<eos> Ward?
If we don't help him, he's gonna die.<eos> We know a nurse.<eos> I'm sure you're aware of this. That video has gone viral.<eos> Ward?<eos> - Hey, wake up. - Mmm.<eos> Look at me.<eos> What did you take?<eos> Tell me what you took.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Ward!
I have lessons here, I...<eos> We can move him to your bedroom.<eos> We'll figure something out.<eos> I'll hire security guards.<eos> You can't trust anyone!<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Relax.<eos> - Take me back. Take me back. - Shh.<eos> No, you need to relax.<eos> It's okay, you're safe here.<eos> - Sabina. - Hey, shh...

Sabina is all that matters.<eos> Then I'll find her.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Okay, this is not something a rich kid from the Upper West Side can just "handle," okay?<eos> This is a job that requires someone with special... skills.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Okay, we all have our limitations.<eos> You have to accept yours.<eos> Listen... I know I'm not the best businessman... and I don't think I'll be the CEO my father was.<eos> But this?
They study your every move, looking for what you reveal to them.<eos> In this way, you are your own worst enemy.<eos> The time has come.<eos> The time has come.<eos> And this is why I tolerate no questioning from you... because doubt leads...<eos> To death.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> We'll make this right.<eos> - We're taking care of it.<eos> - What?

I took too many muscle relaxers, and I'm a lightweight.<eos> Look.<eos> It's not a thing.<eos> Promise.<eos> You scared me, okay?<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> Won't happen again.<eos> Oh. I need you to do something for me.<eos> - Shoot.<eos> - Danny.
You scared me, okay?<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> Won't happen again.<eos> Oh. I need you to do something for me.<eos> - Shoot.<eos> - Danny.<eos> This is all about him. He has got to be at that meeting today.<eos> Okay. I got it.<eos> I'll make sure that he's there.<eos> Thanks.
I'll make sure that he's there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Found two more warehouses on the Lower East Side, Mr. Rand.<eos> - Is that everything?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Please, it's Danny.<eos> Megan, could you give us a minute?<eos> Of course, Mr. Meachum.<eos> I'm a little busy, Ward.<eos> Danny...

They kidnapped the guy's daughter.<eos> Jesus, Danny.
You're wasting your time.<eos> What's worse, my time.<eos> There is no heroin, no girl, nothing.<eos> Look, you can stay in the car if you want.<eos> I'm not stopping.<eos> I thought you were staying in the car.<eos> Thought wrong.<eos> This it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Holy shit!
We have to call the police.<eos> We have to call the...<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Rand can't be tied to this.<eos> Danny, we have to get out of here!<eos> Hey! What the hell are you doing?<eos> I fought him.<eos> Because he didn't stop me, they killed him.<eos> What is that?<eos> An invitation.
Danny, we have to get out of here!<eos> Hey! What the hell are you doing?<eos> I fought him.<eos> Because he didn't stop me, they killed him.<eos> What is that?<eos> An invitation.<eos> I'm not going anywhere else.<eos> You weren't invited.<eos> It's for me only.<eos> Danny.
This... this is what you're gonna do?<eos> It's the only way to get Sabina back.<eos> Yeah, not the only way.<eos> There is a little thing called "notifying the police."<eos> Nah, it's too risky.<eos> We can't take that chance.<eos> The duel begins at sundown.<eos> We haven't got much time.<eos> Too risky. Sundown.<eos> Of course.
We can't take that chance.<eos> The duel begins at sundown.<eos> We haven't got much time.<eos> Too risky. Sundown.<eos> Of course.<eos> Danny, what you're talking about is crazy.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> You can't.<eos> This is for me only.<eos> - Danny...
This is not something you just walk into.<eos> This is what I'm supposed to do.<eos> What do you mean, "supposed to do"?<eos> Look...<eos> I'm not just an ordinary fighter, okay?<eos> I'm the Iron Fist.<eos> The hell does that mean?<eos> It means I never lose.<eos> The more you talk... the weirder this gets.<eos> Danny...
Look, this is right.<eos> Why?<eos> Coming back to New York... I thought things were gonna be different.<eos> It hasn't been what I thought.<eos> I have been preparing to defend K'un-Lun my entire life against the Hand.<eos> And now, I find out that they are here?<eos> This is where I'm meant to be.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Megan!
- Did I interrupt something? - No.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Danny's not in his office.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You got him, right?<eos> No, I didn't get him.<eos> You know how he is.<eos> He's caught up in something of his own.<eos> - I should've, but...<eos> - Right.
No, I didn't get him.<eos> You know how he is.<eos> He's caught up in something of his own.<eos> - I should've, but...<eos> - Right.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm tired of hearing that.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> It's not that bad.<eos> Ward, Wayne Olsen.
I understand why you're going. I just don't want you to.<eos> I'm not going to get hurt.<eos> I promise.<eos> I have a vision of total victory and nothing else.<eos> It's the reason I've gotten this far.<eos> Defeat has no place in my mind.<eos> This isn't a tournament.<eos> Or any kind of challenge you're used to.<eos> If you lose... they'll kill you.<eos> Right?
Tell me the legend again.<eos> Why are you so interested in hearing it?<eos> Because it gives me courage.<eos> A child... touched by fire.<eos> Delivered from heaven to be our greatest warrior.<eos> Destined for victory.<eos> And that's me?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> I've mastered everything.<eos> Not everything.
Don't you know?<eos> I've mastered everything.<eos> Not everything.<eos> What else is there?<eos> You have yet to face the most cunning opponent of them all.<eos> The Hand.<eos> No.<eos> Who're you talking to?<eos> It's time.<eos> Sabina.
Sabina.<eos> No, no, no, no, no!<eos> He's really hurting.<eos> Calm, calm, calm, clam.<eos> Breathe.<eos> I need to get that bandage down.<eos> Can you help me?<eos> I need you to stay calm. Shh.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey. Breathe.<eos> - Sabina!
- Hey, hey, hey. Breathe.<eos> - Sabina!<eos> No.<eos> No. I'm not. I'm not.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Just... just stay...<eos> hold on... holding on to him. Okay?<eos> - Just talk to him...<eos> - About what?
- Sabina!<eos> No.<eos> No. I'm not. I'm not.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Just... just stay...<eos> hold on... holding on to him. Okay?<eos> - Just talk to him...<eos> - About what?<eos> Anything.
- Just talk to him...<eos> - About what?<eos> Anything.<eos> Keep him calm.<eos> - Sabina, do you hate me?<eos> - I don't wanna do this.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> He's... he's focused on you.<eos> Just keep calm.<eos> Just... just another minute.
Forgive me.<eos> Is he...<eos> No.<eos> We got to take him in.<eos> The Iron Fist accepts the challenge of the Grand Duel in the name of the holy city of K'un-Lun.<eos> My terms are that, upon my victory, the Hand will relinquish custody of the young woman Sabina... and depart from Rand.<eos> Welcome.<eos> My master agrees to your terms.<eos> Should you lose, but remain alive, you must remove yourself from all of our dealings.<eos> Agreed.
The enemy will try and divide you.<eos> You are a living weapon.<eos> Drive all other thoughts out of your mind except this...<eos> Destroy the Hand.<eos> Yield.<eos> The first battle is won.<eos> What do we do?<eos> I need Pulmonary.<eos> - Of course!<eos> - Claire?
Yield.<eos> The first battle is won.<eos> What do we do?<eos> I need Pulmonary.<eos> - Of course!<eos> - Claire?<eos> Oh, Delicia, thank God.<eos> - I need a line hop. - Done.<eos> What's the trauma?<eos> John Doe.
John Doe.<eos> Collapsing lung.<eos> I improvised a seal, but it's not holding.<eos> Okay. Call upstairs.<eos> We're bringing in an active.<eos> Can we forego on the fingerprints and ID?<eos> You haven't changed.<eos> I'll buy as much time as I can.<eos> Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.<eos> Shit.

Claire.<eos> Heard you were on the floor.<eos> - You heard I was on the floor? - Mmm.<eos> - I've been here 30 seconds. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - Friend of yours?<eos> - Something like that.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Fine, um... put him at the head of the queue.<eos> Gentlemen, get him on a gurney.<eos> Thanks, Shirley.

If you took me for pleasure how would that make you feel?<eos> Terrible?<eos> Or maybe...<eos> - Good.<eos> Aw, you're worried.<eos> Even about a stranger.<eos> There's no need.<eos> What is this?<eos> Singing Spider venom.<eos> Very rare.
Yes, you can.<eos> Just give in.<eos> It's the life you want, and I can give it to you.<eos> You were looking for freedom, and here it is.<eos> Poisoned.<eos> A gift I freely give.<eos> Reject or accept the darkness.<eos> It is your choice.<eos> Both are acceptable.<eos> But your choice...
If you wish to withdraw...<eos> I'm not leaving without the girl.<eos> It's a well-crafted statement, and I'm sure that Danny can deliver it with sincerity.<eos> And it's not untrue.<eos> Uh, he was speaking from his heart...<eos> Yeah, a great quality.<eos> He's just not up to speed on everything that we do here.<eos> We admire his character, but... he didn't have all the data.<eos> Right, Ward?<eos> Ward?

I guess we're done here.<eos> Ward?
Look, I've had a really long day and now this.<eos> So I just need something for the pain, and then I'll be on my way.<eos> If I can just get you to sign in, then...<eos> Look...<eos> Look... What would it take?<eos> - Three or four pills, huh?<eos> - Oh, I see.<eos> What? Do you want the whole thing?<eos> Look, you can leave right now, or I can call security.<eos> Security?

Really?<eos> - Really?<eos> - Ward!<eos> What is going on?<eos> Is this a friend of yours?<eos> He's my brother.<eos> Well... we seem to be having a problem here.<eos> I was feeling a little...<eos> You know, I... I hurt my hand.<eos> Yeah.
Yeah.<eos> It's not like that, Joy.<eos> Let's get you out of here.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I didn't leave here on the best of terms.<eos> Shirley is not one to give up without a fight.<eos> Unless someone forced her to.<eos> Hey, Delicia, um... can you check and see which OR<eos> - my John Doe was checked in to?<eos> - Sure.

- Sure.<eos> That's strange.<eos> What?<eos> He never arrived at an OR.<eos> Thanks.<eos> They have him.<eos> Who has him?<eos> Come on.<eos> - Claire, are you sure about this?<eos> - Yeah, just one more sec, okay?
If you choose to take this up... you will be forever marked...<eos> As one of us.<eos> Are you willing to kill Danny Rand so that the Iron Fist might live?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> When does the real warrior get here?<eos> These childish insults are getting tiring.<eos> It's like you all trained on the same playground.<eos> Would you like to choose a weapon?<eos> I am the weapon.<eos> Really?
With a desire to serve... until death.<eos> Cast away your childish needs.<eos> Bury your mother. Bury your father.<eos> You belong to me and to me alone.<eos> - You must submit, can you do it?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Then tell me who you are!<eos> A child... touched by fire... delivered from heaven to become the greatest warrior, destined for victory.<eos> Guardian of the Gate...<eos> Destroyer of the Hand.
Then tell me who you are!<eos> A child... touched by fire... delivered from heaven to become the greatest warrior, destined for victory.<eos> Guardian of the Gate...<eos> Destroyer of the Hand.<eos> Stop!<eos> Strike him down, the girl dies.<eos> Withdraw from the duel, and she'll be spared.<eos> That's dishonorable.<eos> What do I care for honor?<eos> Your purpose.
Answer my question.<eos> I am Madame Gao.<eos> Do you remember the katsura tree in the center of K'un-Lun Square?<eos> You've been to K'un-Lun.<eos> Its shade stretches on for miles.<eos> And when it blooms, it smells like brown sugar.<eos> I dream of it every night.<eos> So, please, why would you choose to leave heaven?<eos> My reasons are my own.<eos> Like the girl?
I dream of it every night.<eos> So, please, why would you choose to leave heaven?<eos> My reasons are my own.<eos> Like the girl?<eos> I am entertained by how your mind works.<eos> Has life inside the monastery changed so much?<eos> Because you seem so different from those I remember.<eos> They still teach honor.<eos> - And I made a promise.<eos> - Honor.

Shit.<eos> It's, uh... it's Silybum marianum.<eos> Milk thistle.
Shit.<eos> It's, uh... it's Silybum marianum.<eos> Milk thistle.<eos> It's good for the liver.<eos> Why is it that a man who is so obsessed with his own longevity... can be so careless with the people who control his fate?<eos> The Hand is concerned with this rebellious streak you've shown.<eos> You left the confines of your penthouse.<eos> I explained that already. There was someone claiming to be Danny...<eos> Danny Rand.
What?<eos> Hey. That's not something I want to hear right now.<eos> I'm almost done.<eos> I don't think your ribs are broken, but... they're pretty badly bruised.<eos> My whole body feels like a bruise.<eos> Well, any tournament of death you can walk away from...<eos> I still lost.<eos> Sounds like it might have been rigged to begin with.<eos> Madame Gao... she gave me a choice to win, but I couldn't let Sabina die.<eos> Madame Gao.

Just trying to get in your head, undermine your will to fight her.<eos> It's strategy straight out of The Art of War.<eos> Oh, it's Claire.<eos> Sabina's safe.<eos> - Just trying to keep the wound clean. - Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What are these for?<eos> 'Cause I need a drink.<eos> And you're going to join me, because I hate drinking alone.<eos> Glass.
Tell me another one.<eos> Another story.<eos> About K'un-Lun.<eos> Man...<eos> I was there a long time.<eos> They aren't all great memories.<eos> How about how you got that tattoo?<eos> Well... it's not exactly a tattoo.<eos> It's the mark of the Iron Fist.<eos> Danny...
He was my responsibility.<eos> I was supposed to protect him... and now Gao has him again and we might never be able to find him.<eos> I guess we both lost tonight.<eos> You're going to keep trying... aren't you?<eos> To stop... them?<eos> I can't quit now.<eos> I should go.<eos> - You can stay.<eos> - No, I... I gotta... go to the office in the morning, so I should...<eos> Danny...
We never went hunting.<eos> Oh, maybe it was your sister.<eos> Well, guess I'll do it myself, then.<eos> Come on!<eos> God.<eos> You can do this.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> You think I don't know how messed up this is?<eos> I'm not a child.<eos> Danny?
You think I don't know that?<eos> You think I don't know how messed up this is?<eos> I'm not a child.<eos> Danny?<eos> Right here.<eos> How long have you been up?<eos> Not long.<eos> The city is always so quiet this early.<eos> It's nice.<eos> About last night...
Hey, I need you to find all of my dad's old files.<eos> Okay. They're probably in storage.<eos> Which ones do you want?<eos> Um... anything that mentions a woman named Gao.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Um... Just... just get everything of my father's. All of it.<eos> And get them to move it into my office.<eos> It's probably gonna be a lot of files.<eos> Well, I have a pretty big office.<eos> - Danny.
- Who's that?<eos> - Um... Just... just get everything of my father's.

But I also care about this company.<eos> And right now, I seem to be the only one here who is taking this seriously.<eos> I mean, I have no idea where Ward is.<eos> And you don't even show up for the CIR meeting.<eos> And when you do show up to work, your face is beat to shit.<eos> You're the one that wanted into this company, right?<eos> You fought like hell to get it.<eos> Well, now is the time for the hard work to actually start.<eos> I need you to just do what I say at this meeting today, so we can get this situation fixed.<eos> - Danny?
Eat at fancy restaurants with your friends, like Claire Temple and Colleen Wing.<eos> Stop your war.<eos> This city is no place for the Iron Fist.<eos> You're a businessman now... and this is the best offer you are ever going to get.<eos> My father... did you make him an offer too?<eos> Don't forget to water your plant, Danny.<eos> It is your responsibility now.<eos> Yamade wa Buddha, please watch me and guide over my descent.<eos> This is probably gonna hurt.<eos> Ward? Hey.
- Yes, ma'am.<eos> Demand is higher than we anticipated.<eos> As long as supply can keep up with orders, we should be reaching our sales goal within the next three months.<eos> Quantity is not an issue.<eos> The chemist is almost ready to give up his formula.<eos> And once he does that, we can begin mass production.<eos> There are still holdouts.<eos> Like Hai-Qing Yang.<eos> The Hatchet Men won't be a problem much longer.<eos> - Anything else?
You're gonna leave my building.<eos> You're gonna run, and you're never coming back.<eos> They'll find me.<eos> That's why you're gonna give me your password.<eos> So I can find them first.<eos> Your form's getting a little sloppy, Colleen.<eos> Bakuto.<eos> I didn't know you were coming.<eos> I was just warming up.<eos> Obviously.
Are you trying to make me jealous?<eos> You will always come first for me.<eos> You need to be cautious.<eos> He's begun to attract a lot of attention.<eos> Comes a great deal of danger.<eos> Mmm, I am aware.<eos> Believe me.<eos> For now, keep doing as you are.<eos> I'll be in touch.<eos> Danny.
- Those are the files you asked for.<eos> Where's everything else?<eos> All of my father's things?<eos> That's all I could find in storage.<eos> It's been 15 years.<eos> There was probably more, but things get moved around, and then, eventually, they get lost.<eos> And forgotten.<eos> Do you think this is a good company?<eos> To work?<eos> Sure.
- The idiotic dream of a child.<eos> Karen Page at The Bulletin seemed to like it. What?<eos> You already went to the press?<eos> She seems to think it's gonna make front page tomorrow.<eos> Listen.<eos> I know this isn't what you wanted. Any of you.<eos> But if you look deep down at the better part of yourselves... you'll know we're doing the right thing.<eos> Look, I'm sorry to cut this short, but there's somewhere else I really need to be.<eos> Oh, uh, and the assistants need their dental plan back, so we should probably get on that, too.<eos> Shit.
I'll give you that.<eos> But the Hand is legion.<eos> Why attack now?<eos> Why do you think you can even the odds against our enemies?<eos> Because I have heard Madame Gao's plans for you.<eos> And if you do nothing, you'll all be dead by the end of the week.<eos> You don't know me... but the Hand does.<eos> And they fear me.<eos> With you and your men by our side... they'll fear you, too.<eos> Lawrence.
Lawrence.<eos> I was just reading some of the press on the closure.<eos> Danny might actually be onto...<eos> What's going on?<eos> The board just held an emergency meeting.<eos> About what?<eos> About how you, your brother, and Danny will no longer be on the board... or any part of this company ever again.<eos> You've been ousted from Rand.<eos> Oh, no...<eos> Radovan.

We're gonna get you out of here.<eos> Where's Madame Gao?<eos> You must forgive me.<eos> I told her.<eos> I told her how to make the heroin.<eos> Where did she go?<eos> Radovan, please.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Anzhou...<eos> Radovan.

I told her.<eos> I told her how to make the heroin.<eos> Where did she go?<eos> Radovan, please.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Anzhou...<eos> Radovan.<eos> Oh, Danny.<eos> Danny, I think he...<eos> Danny?
You know what to do.<eos> Hey, it's Danny.<eos> You need to leave your mom's place right now.<eos> Gao may be sending people to hurt you.<eos> Call me or Colleen as soon as you get this.<eos> Harold?
I can't keep running.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> For Louisa.<eos> For myself.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> I'm gonna track her down.<eos> I'm gonna take her by surprise.<eos> I'm gonna grab her.<eos> Grab her?<eos> And then what?
For what I achieved.<eos> I earned my position.<eos> I'm not gonna just walk away.<eos> Not without a fight.<eos> Joy, this isn't a fight we can win.<eos> Well, that may not be true.<eos> If... if I can put together a solid strategy, will you at least consider it?<eos> Okay.<eos> But only if you give serious thought to accepting the settlement.<eos> Deal.

Okay.<eos> But only if you give serious thought to accepting the settlement.<eos> Deal.<eos> Blackalicious, BDP,<eos> Big Pun?<eos> Old school.<eos> I've had it since I was ten.<eos> You must've been a pretty gangsta ten-year-old.<eos> So what's going on with you and Miss Thang?<eos> Colleen?
So what's going on with you and Miss Thang?<eos> Colleen?<eos> What about her?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> That good, huh?<eos> A gentleman never kisses and tells.<eos> You don't have to say anything.<eos> It's written all over your face.<eos> "Danny Rand got some."<eos> What about you?
Killing... is wrong, no matter who pulls the trigger or why.<eos> I wonder if you'd feel the same way if someone killed your mother and father.<eos> An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.<eos> It's an easy opinion to have... when you're not the Iron Fist.<eos> I think Gandhi might disagree with you.<eos> Okay, I'm not special... but I've seen enough people die to understand the value of a life.<eos> What about all the lives that Gao destroys?<eos> Turbulence is scary, but it's not dangerous.<eos> In fact, it's...<eos> - totally normal, actually...

Something hit me in the head.<eos> My mom, she... she came to see if I was okay.<eos> Then the roof was gone.<eos> Then, my mom... she was gone.<eos> My dad, he told me he loved me, and then... then everything went white.<eos> What happened next?<eos> Mom! Mom!<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Stay in your seat.<eos> Heather!
We got you, Danny.<eos> Dad!<eos> I love you, Danny!<eos> How did you feel when you saw the monks?<eos> I felt safe.<eos> Good. Just focus on that feeling.<eos> You're as safe now as you were with them then.<eos> Just keep breathing.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> Ward.
I don't want to cause trouble for anyone.<eos> I just want a moment of your time.<eos> I don't know what there is to discuss.<eos> Joy and I are at an impasse.<eos> I'm ready to sign, but she wants to fight.<eos> And I don't think we'll be able to reach an agreement either way.<eos> So I'm here to ask that my severance be independent of Joy's.<eos> I see.<eos> I know that a lot of effort went into drafting the initial agreement, so I would be willing to accept a significant... decrease... to make it worth your while.<eos> Interesting.
I didn't know what had happened to her.<eos> It wasn't until years later that I realized she was sick.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Afterwards, my dad sent me to live with my grandfather in Japan, but... I always felt kinda...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Abandoned.<eos> It doesn't matter how much anyone else cares for you.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> Part of me is sorry you understand that.<eos> And the rest?
I'm not talking about a legal loophole.<eos> What else is there?<eos> Oh, you're not thinking of using Danny, are you?<eos> Exploiting his corporate crusader image?<eos> Exposing the board for wanting to oust us because we wanted to stop poisoning people?<eos> I'm sorry, but that is a profoundly stupid idea.<eos> You can't keep him in line.<eos> Every time he opens his mouth, he digs you deeper into the hole.<eos> What's this?<eos> The way back.
I don't know what to say.<eos> I can't believe you'd even consider doing something like this.<eos> I'm not the one who painted us into this corner.<eos> I'm just trying to find a way out.<eos> Are you suggesting that I'm somehow responsible for this shitty scheme?<eos> I've known for a while that you... indulged in the extra back pill.<eos> You always seemed to have it under control.<eos> But I wanted the file in case it ever caused problems at Rand.<eos> And this wasn't a problem for you until it was a problem for Rand?<eos> Jesus, Joy.
Well then, I guess I'll just tell you something I've been keeping from you.<eos> Something else, you mean?<eos> You're the person I most admire.<eos> Come on.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I don't know anyone as brilliant or as fearless.<eos> You come up with these crazy ideas.<eos> And you stand your ground, even when the entire board tries to fight you on it.<eos> And then you prove them wrong every single time.<eos> Joy...
I'm not the person you think I am.<eos> Everything that you admire about me, that's not me.<eos> That's all lies. I...<eos> I'm done with lies.<eos> You deserve to know.<eos> Know what?<eos> Everything.<eos> She's keeping those people enslaved.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> The beggar.
We have to do something.<eos> The beggar.<eos> He said they leave for their evening meal around now, right?<eos> As soon as the building's empty, we'll sneak in and we'll burn it to the ground. Wait.<eos> Sorry. You really think it's a good idea to torch the one place we know Gao might show up?<eos> Well, what better way to smoke 'em out than with a fire?<eos> Okay, they're leaving.<eos> Maybe I should hang back and keep watch while y'all are inside.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> You ready?
You do?<eos> When I'm in the fight club, I'm beating the shit out of people...<eos> I'm completely out of control.<eos> I have no idea what I'm doing.<eos> And this from someone who has always been in complete control.<eos> So what happened?<eos> I met you.<eos> What? So it's my fault?<eos> Everything's your fault.<eos> "Hey, Claire.
So what happened?<eos> I met you.<eos> What? So it's my fault?<eos> Everything's your fault.<eos> "Hey, Claire.<eos> How was your trip to China?"<eos> We committed arson, and then... got killed by an evil ninja cult.<eos> It was great.<eos> What'd you do this weekend?"<eos> Shit!
You okay?<eos> I've almost been killed three times this week.<eos> So no, Colleen, I'd say I'm pretty friggin' far from okay.<eos> I mean, are you hurt?<eos> No.<eos> But you are.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Where's Danny?<eos> He went after Gao.<eos> - Alone?
No.<eos> But you are.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Where's Danny?<eos> He went after Gao.<eos> - Alone?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> At least that's what he said.<eos> Hey... buddy.
But you are.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Where's Danny?<eos> He went after Gao.<eos> - Alone?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> At least that's what he said.<eos> Hey... buddy.<eos> Asshole.
What's wrong?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I can't... I can't be here.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Talk to me, Ward.<eos> Please.<eos> You're scaring the shit out of me.<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> Is this where your drug dealer lives?<eos> Ward?
I brought you here to ask you for money, but you're making me feel like an asshole, so forget about it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I didn't know you needed money until literally two seconds ago.<eos> It's not just now.<eos> It's all that bullshit about looking up to me.<eos> It's not bullshit.<eos> You put me up on a pedestal.<eos> Now that I've fallen off, you look at me with all that goddamn pity.<eos> Ow. Stop. Stop it!<eos> Ward!
I'm afraid I can't allow you to do that just yet, Mr. Rand.<eos> Kill the women.<eos> I just want you guys to know... I wish I'd never come to China with you.<eos> Seems fair.<eos> They poisoned their weapons.<eos> It was her.<eos> Gao used the same poison on the pilots.<eos> That's why my plane crashed.<eos> She killed my parents.<eos> Danny...
Why should we be enemies?<eos> And don't let the enemy bait you into a trap.<eos> Let's just take her in.<eos> I'm not turning her over to the police until I find out what I want to know.<eos> The police?<eos> Do you truly believe that's where I will end up?<eos> Tell me about my father and the Hand.<eos> Why are you asking about events that happened 15 years ago when you have more pressing concerns?<eos> Tell me what I want to know.<eos> Or what?

It won't change the way you feel about him.<eos> You know she was responsible for your parents' death. Isn't that enough?<eos> Nothing she says will make you feel better about that.<eos> Let's just be done with this.<eos> So now you're ganging up on me?<eos> We're not. We're with you.<eos> We just... we just don't want you doing something that can't be undone.<eos> right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So? Sodium pentothal.
I'm talking to you.<eos> These kids are playing here.<eos> Is that your son?<eos> so?<eos> I have a son.<eos> and?<eos> I don't know what's going on.<eos> but... and Dad bought it the week before he died.<eos> Why didn't you tell me about this? or I'll find out on my own.<eos> Your choice.

I knew I'd find you here.<eos> There's a... there's a lot going on right now.<eos> no kidding.<eos> we got ousted.<eos> We lost Rand.<eos> - What?
You've been stripped of everything but your shares.<eos> We can't even enter the building anymore.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Maybe you should ask yourself that.<eos> Everything fell apart once you showed up.<eos> This is my fault?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mostly.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I...
Do you know anything about that building?<eos> No.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Why are you lying to me?<eos> Just stay away.<eos> okay?<eos> I'll call you tomorrow. We'll get this all worked out.<eos> I got to go.<eos> He played knick-knack on my thumb.<eos> With a knick-knack paddy...
I got to go.<eos> He played knick-knack on my thumb.<eos> With a knick-knack paddy...<eos> Give a dog a bone.<eos> This old man came...<eos> Smells good.<eos> It's a... what...<eos> what is that? You've never seen pretzels and hot dogs before?<eos> Smells... smells so good.<eos> Hey! Whoa!
What difference would it make?<eos> You will not untie me.<eos> You're right.<eos> I was just trying to be polite.<eos> I won't make that mistake again.<eos> Regret hovers around everything you do.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> You often find yourself fraternizing with people with gifts.<eos> Danny Rand.
He has greater problems to deal with.<eos> it would have already happened.<eos> and pain.<eos> Sometimes the strongest thing you can do is leave.<eos> Danny would understand that.<eos> I'm not abandoning Danny.<eos> Not even to save your mother?<eos> How do you know my men aren't at her door right now?<eos> - I swear to God...<eos> - Claire?
Danny would understand that.<eos> I'm not abandoning Danny.<eos> Not even to save your mother?<eos> How do you know my men aren't at her door right now?<eos> - I swear to God...<eos> - Claire?<eos> Why don't you take a break?<eos> Ms. Wing.<eos> You don't look well.<eos> Mr. Rand?

Of course.<eos> What's... what's this for?<eos> - I... - Never mind.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> isn't it?<eos> I'm not above shoving a sweaty sock in your mouth to shut you up.<eos> I know the burden you carry.<eos> A woman in this world.<eos> You are consistently underestimated.<eos> Last... warning.
Ms. Wing.<eos> You know what they'll do when they arrive.<eos> before it is too late.<eos> Stop talking.<eos> Do you know what he will do when he finds out the truth?<eos> Danny Rand belongs to someone else.<eos> He will never be yours.<eos> Your path leads in a different direction.<eos> Honor the warrior your grandfather created.<eos> Claire!
Stop talking.<eos> Do you know what he will do when he finds out the truth?<eos> Danny Rand belongs to someone else.<eos> He will never be yours.<eos> Your path leads in a different direction.<eos> Honor the warrior your grandfather created.<eos> Claire!<eos> You're sick.<eos> Come on.<eos> Rand.

Yes.<eos> Ward's birthday. Yeah.<eos> Wendell.<eos> Wendell Rand.<eos> uh...<eos> This is my son's office.<eos> Ward.<eos> Frank Robbins?<eos> Who the hell is Frank Robbins?<eos> Joy.
What would you do?<eos> - I'd eat ice cream for breakfast.<eos> sir.<eos> sir.<eos> That wasn't a compliment.<eos> Orders around the front.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I will bust your head wide open.<eos> or I'll find out on my own.<eos> - Your choice.
sir.<eos> sir.<eos> That wasn't a compliment.<eos> Orders around the front.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I will bust your head wide open.<eos> or I'll find out on my own.<eos> - Your choice.<eos> Hello?<eos> Kyle?
I never meant it.<eos> forgive me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> don't you?<eos> I don't know that.<eos> and I love you.<eos> and I came back again.<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> Colleen?
He was more than willing to partner up.<eos> What?<eos> And when your father found out...<eos> Well...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - That's it.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> Maybe it did.<eos> She might not have the answers you're looking for.<eos> Danny.

Her time has come.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> okay?<eos> Grab my phone.<eos> It's under "sensei.<eos> What? Why?<eos> He can help.<eos> she draws closer to her death.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Voice mail.
Ignore her.<eos> Claire?<eos> Yep.<eos> Danny Rand.<eos> Your friends are going to die because of you.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Your eyes will get adjusted to the dark.<eos> What was that?<eos> Camera.
Yep.<eos> Danny Rand.<eos> Your friends are going to die because of you.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Your eyes will get adjusted to the dark.<eos> What was that?<eos> Camera.<eos> They're getting the lay of the land.<eos> Shit!
Danny Rand.<eos> Your friends are going to die because of you.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Your eyes will get adjusted to the dark.<eos> What was that?<eos> Camera.<eos> They're getting the lay of the land.<eos> Shit!<eos> - Danny!
I'm sorry.<eos> I'll give you sorry.<eos> what's that?<eos> It's just... it's just ice cream.<eos> shut up and die.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I've been where you're going.<eos> It's not so bad.<eos> It's just... nothingness.<eos> Kyle?
Jesus!<eos> what did I do?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Ward Meachum?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> please.<eos> What is going on?<eos> please.<eos> This your car?<eos> I...
Then what do you suggest we do?<eos> You just let me out of here.<eos> I will take you to him.<eos> End of story.<eos> that's a risky proposition for a dual diagnosis patient.<eos> Dual diagnosis? - so we have to proceed very... - I'm not an addict.<eos> The heroin that the cops found in your car tells a different story.<eos> As does your father's very public death from cancer.<eos> where would you like to begin?<eos> Daddy?
where would you like to begin?<eos> Daddy?<eos> Joy.<eos> I missed you so much.<eos> How are you still alive?<eos> You were in a casket.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so sorry you saw me like that.<eos> You've grown up so much.<eos> What...
Daddy?<eos> Joy.<eos> I missed you so much.<eos> How are you still alive?<eos> You were in a casket.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so sorry you saw me like that.<eos> You've grown up so much.<eos> What...<eos> Joy.
How are you still alive?<eos> You were in a casket.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so sorry you saw me like that.<eos> You've grown up so much.<eos> What...<eos> Joy.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Dad?<eos> My Joy.
It's okay.<eos> Dad?<eos> My Joy.<eos> She is a fighter.<eos> But once the poison reaches her brain...<eos> There has to be something else we can do.<eos> Danny.<eos> you die.<eos> it's me.<eos> - Sensei?
My Joy.<eos> She is a fighter.<eos> But once the poison reaches her brain...<eos> There has to be something else we can do.<eos> Danny.<eos> you die.<eos> it's me.<eos> - Sensei?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Colleen?
I've taken care of Madame Gao's mercenaries.<eos> How do we know this isn't another trap?<eos> Look out your window.<eos> Now... open the door.<eos> You have no business here.<eos> Leave!<eos> You should have called me sooner.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name is Bakuto.<eos> Sensei.
Now... open your fist.<eos> Now... place your hand over the poison.<eos> Focus on it.<eos> Do you sense the poison?<eos> Yes.<eos> And do you sense her life force?<eos> They should feel different.<eos> Yes.<eos> Use your chi to burn the poison away.<eos> Danny!
They should feel different.<eos> Yes.<eos> Use your chi to burn the poison away.<eos> Danny!<eos> it worked!<eos> You're safe.<eos> there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Danny!
I'm fine.<eos> Danny!<eos> The frog in the well never understands the sea.<eos> Where are you taking him?<eos> what's going on?<eos> We're helping him.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> you're not allowed.<eos> Claire.
What happened?<eos> You healed me, Danny.<eos> Saved my life.<eos> It's a lot... having to keep a secret like this.<eos> And I... I understand now why Ward's... why he is the way he is.<eos> Yeah, I think we might be losing him, Joy.<eos> You put him in a terrible position, Dad.<eos> Lying to everyone. Standing right next to me while I cried over you, knowing he could do something about it, he could make it better.<eos> No, he couldn't make it better.<eos> Hey, Joy.
You were like parchment.<eos> I was afraid they might break you.<eos> And sometimes... sometimes I'd wake up... and I'd see you there, asleep in the chair... and you'd be looking just like you were when you were kids.<eos> So peaceful.<eos> And in that darkness, I'd pray.<eos> I would plead to the universe that if I... if I ever had a second chance, I'd do anything.<eos> I would do anything, I'd pay any price, to keep you away.<eos> Keep you away from that pain and that heartache.<eos> I wanted to protect you from suffering, because you'd endured so much already.<eos> Joy...
Keep you away from that pain and that heartache.<eos> I wanted to protect you from suffering, because you'd endured so much already.<eos> Joy...<eos> Joy, I... I love you.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for, you know, I'm sorry for all of... all of this.<eos> I'm just glad the universe listened.<eos> What was it like?<eos> What?<eos> Death?
Death?<eos> It was like when I was a kid... coming home from school through the snow, and... and then I'd be standing on the porch, freezing, and on the other side was comfort.<eos> But this time... This time when I tried the handle, the door wouldn't open.<eos> And I could hear you.<eos> I could hear you and Ward on the other side, and...<eos> I... I wanted to be on the other side so much.<eos> But the harder I tried... the further I'd just... I'd drift away and... it would become colder... and colder.<eos> And, uh, and I was here.<eos> Restored.<eos> Joy...
Where is he?<eos> - I'm worried about him.<eos> - Ward has a problem, Joy.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Yeah, Dad, I know.<eos> I know he has a problem.<eos> I've talked to him about it, and it hasn't helped.<eos> Oh, well, you know, addicts can be... they can be unpredictable.<eos> But we've gotta do everything we can to help him.<eos> Everything.
People will ask you questions, and you're... you're gonna wanna answer honestly and truthfully.<eos> Yeah, under oath.<eos> Mmm-hmm. Probably.<eos> Hopefully, it won't come to that.<eos> Look, I know that secrets... secrets and lies have... they've taken a toll on our family.<eos> They've almost ruined us, but... I want a future free from all of that.<eos> For you, for me... for all of us.<eos> This is where I came when I first returned from my grandfather's in Japan.<eos> What is this?<eos> A monastery?
Yeah, under oath.<eos> Mmm-hmm. Probably.<eos> Hopefully, it won't come to that.<eos> Look, I know that secrets... secrets and lies have... they've taken a toll on our family.<eos> They've almost ruined us, but... I want a future free from all of that.<eos> For you, for me... for all of us.<eos> This is where I came when I first returned from my grandfather's in Japan.<eos> What is this?<eos> A monastery?<eos> A school?
This is where I came when I first returned from my grandfather's in Japan.<eos> What is this?<eos> A monastery?<eos> A school?<eos> Uh, a bit of both.<eos> A safe place for people who need a home.<eos> They took me in, helped me get settled.<eos> Who's "they"?<eos> Bakuto and his group.<eos> Your sensei?
What is this?<eos> A monastery?<eos> A school?<eos> Uh, a bit of both.<eos> A safe place for people who need a home.<eos> They took me in, helped me get settled.<eos> Who's "they"?<eos> Bakuto and his group.<eos> Your sensei?<eos> Our sensei.
I'm not.<eos> But you are.<eos> Our bodies always give away our inner truth.<eos> Release whatever's binding you.<eos> Pain, lack, fear... and replace it with energy, abundance, trust.<eos> You are rooted... tied to the force that binds all life.<eos> Let it course through you.<eos> Let it replace everything that is broken.<eos> Now... how do you feel?<eos> Hungry.
Pain, lack, fear... and replace it with energy, abundance, trust.<eos> You are rooted... tied to the force that binds all life.<eos> Let it course through you.<eos> Let it replace everything that is broken.<eos> Now... how do you feel?<eos> Hungry.<eos> I can fix that, too.<eos> Colleen, can you go ahead and let the kitchen know that we're on our way?<eos> There's something I'd like to show Danny first.<eos> Yeah. Sure.
But why keep all of this a secret?<eos> There's a difference between "secret" and "secure."<eos> You see, we take in people from all walks of life who need safety.<eos> They need that because their lives were complicated... even dangerous, sometimes.<eos> Because of that, we try and keep a low profile.<eos> We give them a safe haven... and much more.<eos> What's that?<eos> Well, each person needs a purpose, something to believe in, a place to belong, a community that can help you become all that you can be.<eos> So it's a cult?<eos> Yes, just, uh, just like the Girl Scouts.

I need to know where she's gone.<eos> I've placed her in confinement until we can be sure that turning her over to the police will get us the right results.<eos> Her power is far-reaching.<eos> We can't take any chances.<eos> This place... it seems familiar.<eos> It should.<eos> The same atmosphere that shaped you in the monastery is present here.<eos> We're seeking to build character, discipline, educate young people in the same way.<eos> Did Colleen tell you everything about me?<eos> Not everything.
Participate only in things they feel comfortable with.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> A change is coming, Danny.<eos> Something significant.<eos> And I wanna be ready.<eos> I want my family and friends to be ready.<eos> When I heard about what you did with the pricing of the drugs at Rand, I knew we had similar values.<eos> The world we live in now is run by corporations, not governments.<eos> Oligarchies of the rich and powerful.
Inside?<eos> You know you don't fit in at Rand.<eos> I've read the news.<eos> You can use help there as well.<eos> I can provide that.<eos> But your destiny... is here.<eos> Doing something only you can do.<eos> - He's not picking up.<eos> - Oh, let it ring.<eos> Hey, Joy.

Doing something only you can do.<eos> - He's not picking up.<eos> - Oh, let it ring.<eos> Hey, Joy.<eos> Danny?<eos> Uh, I've been meaning to call.<eos> What's up?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Well, Danny, I have someone here who wants to speak with you.<eos> Danny.
- He's not picking up.<eos> - Oh, let it ring.<eos> Hey, Joy.<eos> Danny?<eos> Uh, I've been meaning to call.<eos> What's up?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Well, Danny, I have someone here who wants to speak with you.<eos> Danny.<eos> Harold?
Danny.<eos> Harold?<eos> You're alive.<eos> Oh, why wouldn't I be?<eos> Uh, I came to the penthouse.<eos> There was... there was blood everywhere.<eos> I thought Gao...<eos> - Oh, not a chance.<eos> Hey, listen...<eos> - And Joy?
She knows?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it's all right. I told her everything.<eos> Hey, we're, uh, working on a plan to get Rand back, and, uh, you're a big part of that.<eos> Look, I'll get there as soon as I can.<eos> Hey, no excuses.<eos> This is important, Danny.<eos> I haven't been very reliable, I know.<eos> But you'll be glad to hear that Gao is finally out of the way.<eos> - What?
I can't confirm that.<eos> I'm trying to find out if she's been sent to jail or something else.<eos> But I've been assured by Bakuto that she's out of commission.<eos> Oh, and who exactly is this, uh, Bakuto?<eos> He's a friend.<eos> I think.<eos> Hey, Danny, just be careful, all right?<eos> And, uh, get here as soon as you can.<eos> - Oh, he did it.<eos> - What?
I need to be.<eos> I don't like keeping things from him.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> Then... he's not right for you.<eos> It's complicated...<eos> I know.<eos> But it's for the best.<eos> He may be hurt in the beginning, but if he feels about you the way you feel about him... he'll make the right choice.<eos> Danny!

Can you come and go as you please?<eos> Kind of.<eos> We have free time.<eos> We all live in the dorms here.<eos> But there's a curfew.<eos> You ever try and sneak out?<eos> - Security's too tight.<eos> - And nobody really wants to.<eos> Are there any areas off-limits?<eos> Yeah, a few.
Then you ran towards slavery as fast as you could.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> Really?<eos> Now you're baiting me with insults?<eos> I am treating you with respect by being who I truly am.<eos> Not everyone around you does the same.<eos> That's not true!<eos> They are stealing your ability to trust.<eos> That is how they crush you.<eos> Who?

Manipulating as always.<eos> Working an angle.<eos> Trying to get me to question everything.<eos> Even you.<eos> In what way?<eos> She implied that this was the Hand.<eos> Bakuto.<eos> There was a ceremonial knife in his office.<eos> I recognized it because men from the Hand used one like it.<eos> Colleen?
There was a ceremonial knife in his office.<eos> I recognized it because men from the Hand used one like it.<eos> Colleen?<eos> I wanted to tell you from the beginning.<eos> No.<eos> - Please, just listen.<eos> - No. Listen to me. Give me a chance to explain...<eos> Explain what?<eos> The Hand are murderers and killers!<eos> Gao!
That's not true.<eos> I didn't...<eos> Did Bakuto give you that money the first time we met in the park?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Was it okay with him when I stayed around at the dojo?<eos> - This isn't some conspiracy, Danny.<eos> - Then explain it to me.<eos> Make it make sense.<eos> Because right now, all I'm hearing are lies<eos> - and evasion...
- Then explain it to me.<eos> Make it make sense.<eos> Because right now, all I'm hearing are lies<eos> - and evasion...<eos> - I already met you!<eos> I already felt the way I feel.<eos> And was that before or after you knew about the Fist?<eos> Before.<eos> And was it his idea that you sleep with me?<eos> Danny...
A way out.<eos> A return to public life for you.<eos> Go on.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Look, Singleton, we have to be extra cautious at this time.<eos> This is disappointing.<eos> I was hoping you wouldn't take the bait and dig further.<eos> Even sneaking down to kill Gao would have been better than this.<eos> More lies.<eos> Simply a test.

You are the worst Iron Fist ever.<eos> Davos?

- I'm calling security.<eos> - Oh, this is exhausting.<eos> You know, you don't think I had them turned off for routine maintenance?<eos> Come on, Lawrence.<eos> Now, I think we can, uh... we can both agree that our children and their lives are the most important thing, right?<eos> - I guess. - Yeah?<eos> Have you thought at all about what your, uh, fall from grace might do to them?<eos> How they might be bullied, pursued by the media, shamed on all fronts?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> And Michael.
Manic depression, barely treated.<eos> Oh, I know. I know.<eos> I know what it's like to have a troubled son.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - See?<eos> We share so much, you and I.<eos> That's why I thought it was, um, important to come and offer you an easy solution.<eos> Which is?<eos> You're gonna kill yourself.<eos> Right.
How much longer until the, uh, system reboots?<eos> Two minutes, thirty.<eos> Well, make sure you get the fingerprints and the gunpowder residue right.<eos> I guess you better hurry.<eos> Lei Kung sent me to bring you home.<eos> Who the hell are these people?<eos> It's the Hand.<eos> What?<eos> Then we'll kill as many as we can on our way out.<eos> Backup, two-man teams!
It's the Hand.<eos> What?<eos> Then we'll kill as many as we can on our way out.<eos> Backup, two-man teams!<eos> Move it!<eos> - Over here!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Sensei, what's going on?<eos> - It's Danny.<eos> - What?
- What?<eos> Find him!<eos> Come on! Come on!<eos> Let's go! Move!<eos> Okay, we make it to the gate, you summon the Fist,<eos> - knock it down. We're out. - Right.<eos> We're gonna be seen, though.<eos> I can hold them off for a bit, but we have to go quickly.<eos> Stealing apples from Master Q'uon was harder.<eos> Ready?

- Let's do it.<eos> - Darryl.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - Get outta the way.<eos> This isn't your fight!<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - The gate!<eos> No, no, no, forget him! Forget him.<eos> - To the gate.<eos> - Darryl.
The Fist! You have to use the Fist. Knock down the gate.<eos> - Hold it!<eos> - Danny, now!<eos> We're out of time.<eos> Block that area.<eos> Your anger, your hatred, your confusion... it's destroyed your chi.<eos> The Fist won't work.<eos> You cannot access it.<eos> This wasn't the plan.<eos> - Eric.

Unless... you see fit to reinstate the visionaries that led Rand to historic profits.<eos> Right the ship.<eos> Show Wall Street and the world that stability is being restored.<eos> Now, there will be whispers about the why of Wilkins' death, but Rand should quiet those fears with a show of strength.<eos> The Meachums will set things right.<eos> Now the truth is... you need us.<eos> I move that we... reinstate the Meachums... and Mr. Rand.<eos> I second the motion.<eos> All those in favor...<eos> Aye.
It gave me this sense of comfort.<eos> I thought it was just... my imagination, uh, the wishful thinking of... of a daughter who missed her dad.<eos> Now I know it was something else.<eos> You were there... watching... manipulating, conspiring.<eos> No, Joy, it's not like that.<eos> But it is.<eos> And you know it.<eos> You remember the promise you made?<eos> No more lies.<eos> Complete honesty.
Danny.<eos> - Davos?
It's very useful.<eos> I saw some equipment in Bakuto's office.<eos> I think he can track cell phones.<eos> I left mine back at the compound.<eos> Another reason to leave this city as quickly as possible.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> Not yet. Danny, the path will not remain open forever.<eos> If we miss it, it will be years before we can return.<eos> They killed my parents, Davos!<eos> - What?

Danny, the path will not remain open forever.<eos> If we miss it, it will be years before we can return.<eos> They killed my parents, Davos!<eos> - What?<eos> - The Hand.
Please, Davos.<eos> I need your help.<eos> And once we do this, we go back?<eos> Once the Hand is done... there'll be nothing left for me here.<eos> Now, I need to get this wound taken care of.<eos> I know someone who can help.<eos> Someone I trust.<eos> That woman who helped you escape the compound, who is she?<eos> No one important.<eos> Colleen?
I can save Danny, too.<eos> He doesn't understand the good we're doing.<eos> - I can make him see.<eos> - The time for understanding is over.<eos> He sees you as one of us and that is all he will ever see.<eos> The Iron Fist must be controlled.<eos> The Hand needs him.<eos> When you find him, you will tell me where he is.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hey.

We need your help.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Come on.<eos> There's something in there.<eos> - Try not to move.<eos> Got it.<eos> - Can you stitch me up?<eos> - You're losing too much blood.<eos> - What about healing yourself?<eos> - What?
I, um... I can't.<eos> Not right now.<eos> Okay, uh... hand.<eos> Hold tightly here.<eos> You might not like this.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - What is that?<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I'm sure you're gonna bleed to death if I don't do this.<eos> Shit!
Not right now.<eos> Okay, uh... hand.<eos> Hold tightly here.<eos> You might not like this.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - What is that?<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I'm sure you're gonna bleed to death if I don't do this.<eos> Shit!<eos> Just a few more.
Can you check the perimeter?<eos> In case we're being followed.<eos> Uh, I've...<eos> I've already checked.<eos> Twice. - Just do it again.<eos> - I'm... I'm not going to leave you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We need to make sure we're safe.<eos> The Hand have been here before.<eos> God damn!
Uh, I've...<eos> I've already checked.<eos> Twice. - Just do it again.<eos> - I'm... I'm not going to leave you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We need to make sure we're safe.<eos> The Hand have been here before.<eos> God damn!<eos> Colleen is in the Hand?<eos> - No way.
Colleen is a teacher. She helps kids get off the streets.<eos> Yeah, by sending them straight to the Hand.<eos> She was trying to do the same thing to me.<eos> There's got to be more going on here.<eos> You said it was like a cult compound?<eos> I mean, maybe she's been brainwashed.<eos> She lied.<eos> She's been lying to me from the beginning.<eos> Everything she said. - Just... just using me!<eos> - Danny...
The way you two feel about each other? That's real.<eos> Are we done?<eos> I don't think there's any internal bleeding.<eos> But that wound could easily get infected.<eos> You need antibiotics.<eos> - You have any?<eos> - No. Too many aggro would-be crime fighters keep showing up hurt and cleaning out my supplies.<eos> Here.<eos> It's clean.<eos> Or cleaner.
It's clean.<eos> Or cleaner.<eos> A friend of mine left it here.<eos> Is your friend okay?<eos> Probably doing better than you are.<eos> Anything else you need?<eos> I just need to restore my chi.<eos> Well, you're on your own with that.<eos> Hey, you look like you need a...<eos> A refill.
Well, it started moving to a collection of offshore holdings based in South America.<eos> That's Bakuto.<eos> Bakuto, that's what he wants.<eos> He's stealing every cent in Gao's piggy bank.<eos> No.<eos> These are Rand accounts.<eos> - It's our bank.<eos> - This is it.<eos> This is the silver bullet I've been looking for, Joy!<eos> - Joy. - Mmm.
He always does.<eos> Where's Danny?<eos> He went up to your roof for his meditations.<eos> He needs to restore his chi so he can summon the Iron Fist for our battle with the Hand.<eos> He told me to watch over you.<eos> Yeah, I bet he did.<eos> Well, as long as you're watching, are you hungry?<eos> I ordered pizza.<eos> What passes for food in this world is poison for both the body and soul.<eos> Okay.

Healing through chi.<eos> Reiki is thought of as a pseudoscience, but there are stories of it healing tumors and curing disease.<eos> So, maybe it's more real than I thought.<eos> You know, chi is the breath of life.<eos> It's what powers the Iron Fist.<eos> Where does that come from? The Fist?<eos> It's a force that lives in the heart of Shou-Lao until a warrior from the monastery can claim it.<eos> What, or, uh, who is Shou-Lao?<eos> A dragon.<eos> Okay.
So do you have to kill it?<eos> Shou-Lao is undying.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> The Iron Fist?<eos> No.<eos> There's only one.<eos> I trained for it, same as Danny.<eos> But ultimately, Lei Kung and the elder monks decided it was Danny who should enter the cave.<eos> Hmm. He was the first... outsider to be chosen.<eos> Why him?
What did you think was gonna happen?<eos> Right.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Wait.<eos> Look, I don't wanna attack you just because my feelings are hurt.<eos> I just spent the last hour defending you to Danny.<eos> I told him that I thought you were a good person, no matter what.<eos> So if I let you in... what are you gonna tell him?<eos> See anything?<eos> Rocks.

So if I let you in... what are you gonna tell him?<eos> See anything?<eos> Rocks.<eos> Clouds.<eos> Same as yesterday.<eos> Guarding the pass.<eos> You know what the whole rest of your life is gonna be.<eos> - Guarding the pass.<eos> - Guarding K'un-Lun.<eos> Danny?
But you can do a lot more than destroy, Danny.<eos> Look, I don't know why you left K'un-Lun... but whatever it is that you're looking for, you're not going to find it back there.<eos> You had a traumatic experience as a kid.<eos> And I think that all that rage and anger that you've been burying since you were ten years old is still there.<eos> And if you are not careful... if you do not figure out a way to deal with it... then destroying is going to be all that you are good for.<eos> Thank you, Claire... for everything.<eos> Look, I... I just need one last thing.<eos> Name it.<eos> Can I borrow your car?<eos> - Yeah.

I could get in trouble.<eos> Am I your sensei or not?<eos> No, of course.<eos> Whatever you need.<eos> The Hand always comes first.<eos> It's good to have you back, Danny.<eos> He told me everything.<eos> We were just trying to protect you.<eos> By lying to me?<eos> Oh, Joy.
He told me everything.<eos> We were just trying to protect you.<eos> By lying to me?<eos> Oh, Joy.<eos> He was just respecting my wishes.<eos> He was trying to keep you safe.<eos> - Well, look what that got us.<eos> - Oh, that was in the past.<eos> Now we're ready to take the fight to the Hand.<eos> As a family.
You're talking about murder.<eos> We cut off the head and the snake will die.<eos> Hey. Did you get it?<eos> - It's right here.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I did my job.<eos> That's how the Hand functions.<eos> Everyone does their job.<eos> Your job was to tell Bakuto if you found Danny.<eos> Brian, Mary.
That's how the Hand functions.<eos> Everyone does their job.<eos> Your job was to tell Bakuto if you found Danny.<eos> Brian, Mary.<eos> You guys been keeping up with your training?<eos> - You need to come with us.<eos> - Bakuto wants to talk to you.<eos> Tell him to meet me at my dojo.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Sensei.
You've let Danny infect you with doubt about our cause.<eos> And there's no cure for that.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Bakuto?<eos> After all that we've been through, at least we can take some comfort knowing that in your final moments... you'll still be giving to the Hand.<eos> Wait.<eos> What do you mean, "giving to the Hand"?<eos> Bakuto!<eos> After everything you have taught us... how could you betray the Hand?<eos> Nothing?
Wait.<eos> What do you mean, "giving to the Hand"?<eos> Bakuto!<eos> After everything you have taught us... how could you betray the Hand?<eos> Nothing?<eos> You're not gonna give me one of your little sanctimonious speeches about the code, teamwork and all that?<eos> What was it you used to say, sensei?<eos> A single arrow is easily broken.<eos> Because right now, you look pretty broken to me.<eos> Shit!
Yeah.<eos> And all we saw was your dad doing his private meditations.<eos> - In the nude.<eos> - Yeah, I know, okay? I remember.<eos> Do you ever think that maybe the Thunderer was wrong?<eos> About certain things?<eos> Everyone meditates in their own private way.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> Sometimes I get these... these flashes.<eos> Anger.
Hello there.<eos> A little help here?<eos> No. No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> - I'm so hungry.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no.<eos> - First you, then Joy.<eos> - No, not Joy! Not Joy!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no.<eos> - First you, then Joy.<eos> - No, not Joy! Not Joy!<eos> - Everything all right?<eos> - Your heart rate's high.<eos> I don't like being strapped down.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Nurse Hill.<eos> What's your first name?<eos> - Stacy. - Stacy.
I'm here to help.<eos> There you go.<eos> You've been poisoned by Madame Gao's synthetic heroin.<eos> - You know her?<eos> Who are you?<eos> - My name is Bakuto.<eos> Think of this drug as a shortcut past your withdrawal symptoms.<eos> - Are you with the hospital? - No, no...<eos> I'm with the Hand.<eos> Oh, shit.
I can make sure he never comes back.<eos> From the dead, I mean.<eos> It's a gift that we've given to a very chosen few.<eos> We can see that we made a mistake in giving it to Harold.<eos> You know this, too.<eos> This has a cost, right?<eos> We are living in a new age where governments aren't the true controllers of man's destinies.<eos> It's corporations like Rand Enterprises that govern the world.<eos> - So you wanna run Rand like Gao. - No.<eos> No, not like Gao.

You know, this place has confused you.<eos> It's no wonder you can't summon the Iron Fist.<eos> You know, last week, if you would have told me that I'd be here, working with my daughter, I wouldn't have believed it.<eos> Reunion would be a hell of a lot better if we weren't taking down drug dealers.<eos> Oh, well, we take our blessings where we can find 'em.<eos> You used to say that to me when I'd sit with you during your chemo treatments.<eos> Yeah, I remember.<eos> Yeah, you'd... sit and talk to me about school and... your latest drama with your friends, and...<eos> Oh, you sang that one song over and over.<eos> - "Crazy in Love"?
- "Crazy in Love"?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I know it wasn't easy being there by my side during those treatments.<eos> I wouldn't have missed it for the world.<eos> I mean, those moments...<eos> - I felt like I had you all to myself.<eos> - Well, it meant a lot.<eos> Well, here we are with a second chance.<eos> Promise me when this is all over, we can make up for lost time. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - You, me, Danny, Ward.

I need to talk with Joy alone.<eos> Well, anything you have to say to Joy, you can say to me.<eos> Hey, it's okay.<eos> Just give us a sec.<eos> So how are you?<eos> Give the hospital a call.<eos> Find out how he's been released.<eos> Yeah, much better.<eos> I was hoping we could head out and catch up.<eos> Uh, yeah, definitely.

I'm helping Dad free us from the Hand.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> - What?
- You're the one that seems off.<eos> That's because whoever this is, isn't... He isn't our dad, okay?<eos> This... this thing crawling around in our dad's skin, he is violent, dangerous... He's killed two men, that I know of.<eos> I have no doubt that he killed Wilkins.<eos> - Have you seen Kyle around lately?<eos> - Who's Kyle?<eos> It pains me to say this, Joy. It's clear that Ward still needs help.<eos> Doesn't matter. Let's just go.<eos> - Let's just go now.<eos> - Kevin.
Why does everything have to be so goddamn hard?<eos> - Let her go.<eos> - Oh, you've lost it, son.<eos> I don't care what you think.<eos> Joy's coming with me.<eos> Okay. Yeah. I'll come with you.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> - Just put the gun away.<eos> - I will put the gun away when we are on the elevator and away from here.<eos> Deal?
- Let her go.<eos> - Oh, you've lost it, son.<eos> I don't care what you think.<eos> Joy's coming with me.<eos> Okay. Yeah. I'll come with you.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> - Just put the gun away.<eos> - I will put the gun away when we are on the elevator and away from here.<eos> Deal?<eos> Deal.
- You're not killing my father!<eos> - Hey, lady! Hey!<eos> You're testing the limits of my patience.<eos> Stay still, Joy.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Everything'll be okay.<eos> Don't do this in front of Joy.<eos> I will get you anything you want.<eos> Name it.<eos> - Your phone.

Hello, Danny.<eos> Bakuto?<eos> I'm sorry it's come to this, but you've left me with few options.<eos> Bakuto, you can't.<eos> You should take this as a compliment.<eos> It shows how much you mean to me.<eos> No!<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> No.<eos> Joy.
Unlike you and me.<eos> All the questionable shit we've done in the name of Rand...<eos> Hey, hey, hey. That's not true, Joy.<eos> This is all very touching, but time is up.<eos> This blade has cut down kings, emperors, lords and tyrants.<eos> If you would have told me I might use it on a businessman?<eos> Well, I wouldn't wanna desecrate the integrity of your blade.<eos> You're not gonna want to move, Harold.<eos> I don't wanna have to swing twice.<eos> Any last words?

I don't wanna have to swing twice.<eos> Any last words?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ward...<eos> I invested my life into you, to raise you to be a great man.<eos> You've been the biggest disappointment of my life.<eos> Joy, I apologize for choosing Ward over you.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> Never trust him again.<eos> Joy.
Joy.<eos> I love you.<eos> Dad!<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Stop, please.<eos> Stop!<eos> Oh, cutting it close there.<eos> Cover him.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Oh, my little girl.
Stop, please.<eos> Stop!<eos> Oh, cutting it close there.<eos> Cover him.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Oh, my little girl.<eos> Hey, it's okay, Joy.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Don't move.<eos> - Danny...
On the bright side, now you know how to get rid of your father for good.<eos> You set this up?<eos> - I'm sorry, Danny.<eos> - Time to go.<eos> - Don't let them take him. - Hey.<eos> We can't let them take him.<eos> Danny's making a noble sacrifice for us.<eos> - No.<eos> It's not okay. - Shh. Shh.<eos> - Danny!
I should have recognized you were too weak to be Hand.<eos> Deep in your soul, you know that you are nothing more than a teacher of children at a dojo that I gave you.<eos> He's trying to draw you out.<eos> I know.<eos> But he's mine.<eos> You've learned well.<eos> But you're only as strong as your weapon.<eos> What matters is how you use your weapon.<eos> He's her sensei. This is her fight.<eos> Colleen...
Don't talk to her like that.<eos> K'un-Lun would have been better off if Chodak and Tashi had never found you.<eos> You'd choose this putrid hellhole over the people who raised you?<eos> Get up!<eos> This has nothing to do with K'un-Lun.<eos> This is because I left you.<eos> Yield.<eos> I kicked your ass back in K'un-Lun and I kicked your ass here!<eos> Yield!<eos> Danny!
Others before me may have felt it was their destiny... but I am Danny Rand.<eos> And I'm the Iron Fist.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wish you could understand.<eos> I never will.<eos> All I know, the way to K'un-Lun is open... and there's no one guarding the pass.<eos> There will be consequences for this, brother.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'll work through it.<eos> Holy shit.
- What about Danny?<eos> - Oh, he's served his purpose.<eos> Whether he kills Bakuto... or Bakuto kills him.<eos> Harold, it's Danny.<eos> Hey, I'm relieved to hear your voice.<eos> - What happened with Bakuto?<eos> - We've taken care of him.<eos> - Oh, so you cut off the head of the snake?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And Joy?
With my children.<eos> All thanks to you.<eos> - You're like family to me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Talk later.<eos> When Bakuto put the cuffs on me, I... I had no idea if the Fist was gonna work or not.<eos> - Does this mean you're better?<eos> - Let's not go overboard.<eos> Guess it just means I don't want to be someone's Sack Man.<eos> - What?

It's different.<eos> I feel the same.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> How does Ward even know where you are?<eos> - No.<eos> - What is he talking about?<eos> Looks like Gao's men.<eos> Or Bakuto's.<eos> Danny!
Come on.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> How does Ward even know where you are?<eos> - No.<eos> - What is he talking about?<eos> Looks like Gao's men.<eos> Or Bakuto's.<eos> Danny!<eos> What are they doing here?<eos> Danny Rand!
Things have changed.<eos> I want to help him.<eos> Danny made a poor decision when he attacked the DEA agents.<eos> His life is in danger.<eos> I haven't had any contact with him.<eos> Good morning.<eos> May I help you?<eos> Good morning.<eos> perhaps you could tell me who would want to set him up in this way?<eos> Ward.

I see you've aged reasonably well.<eos> Dad.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> You have been faking your death for all these years?<eos> That is fraud on the highest level.<eos> Would you mind excusing us?<eos> I need to speak with my son.<eos> Is this wise? Stepping out in public?<eos> Ward. The time is now.<eos> Combination the same?
Dad!<eos> Ward.<eos> and you've always lost.<eos> this is your last chance to come on board.<eos> it's just me and Joy running this company.<eos> And not Danny?<eos> Danny?<eos> Danny is just a drug-smuggling fugitive from the law.<eos> I think we both know that's not true.<eos> Either way...
I need to get in touch with Hogarth. Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But maybe we shouldn't contact her directly.<eos> We don't know where the DEA's eyes are.<eos> We need a messenger.<eos> I was asked to give you something.<eos> A client needs you.<eos> $5 will get you exactly two seconds of my time.<eos> take it.<eos> J-Money.
You really think that's a good idea?<eos> of course not.<eos> You're a billionaire facing federal drug charges.<eos> You might as well have the words "Flight Risk" stamped on your forehead.<eos> and you will end up in a jail cell for 6 to 12 months minimum before this even goes to trial.<eos> our criminal justice system sucks.<eos> did you find out what evidence the DEA has against Danny?<eos> who are you?<eos> Colleen Wing. wonderful.<eos> Another fugitive from the law.
- He didn't fake it.<eos> He really died. starting with that.<eos> I could... I could get it analyzed.<eos> Maybe prove that the documents were forged.<eos> I gave it to Harold. Back when I was stupid enough to think we were on the same side.<eos> Is there anything else we can do?<eos> you have three options. and never look back.<eos> Or you can turn yourself in and we can try to fight this in court.<eos> the best I can do is beg for a plea deal.<eos> And the third option?
Silent is the last thing it should be.<eos> You think it's deserted?<eos> we took out their leader.<eos> Maybe they ran.<eos> Only one way to find out.<eos> Where would they go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's so much I don't know.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Gao?
And now that child has grown up.<eos> isn't it?<eos> Much easier to burn it in the flames of anger.<eos> You think you're so clever... with these little mind games.<eos> isn't it?<eos> Your thirst for vengeance.<eos> You wanted someone to pay for the death of your mother and father.<eos> I didn't even know it was murder until after I left. but you were smart enough to know that airplanes don't drop from the sky for no reason.<eos> We're wasting our time here.<eos> Danny.
Because you know I didn't kill your parents.<eos> Why would I have gone to such trouble to hide it with a plane crash?<eos> It was someone much more treacherous than I. as I thought it would draw too much unwanted attention.<eos> She is playing mind games.<eos> She's trying to get you on her side.<eos> The side of truth and honesty.<eos> Who else would kill my parents?<eos> Stop thinking like a child.<eos> Who would benefit most from the death of the Rand family?<eos> - No one.

You were in the plane as well.<eos> Harold was diagnosed with cancer.<eos> three years to live.<eos> and he leapt at it.<eos> He set up our heroin operation in China.<eos> I still remember the moment when he came to me and asked for poison.<eos> He seemed very enthused by the idea.<eos> You will only gain the strength of a real Iron Fist after you have killed Harold. You must rid yourself of this anger.<eos> Danny Rand. and it will lead you to fulfill your destiny as the true Iron Fist.<eos> The other door...

just listen.<eos> okay? but Bakuto?<eos> I really wanted to kill Bakuto. otherwise I'd spend the rest of my life wondering if I killed a man for the wrong reasons.<eos> I think that if you kill Harold out of your own vengeance... it'll corrupt your chi.<eos> You'll never be the Iron Fist you're meant to be.<eos> Which is why I have to kill Harold for you. What?<eos> Jesus!<eos> Is there a version of this where we don't kill someone? - The tablet.<eos> How do we get the tablet?<eos> - Ward.
of course he's acting a little off. Who wouldn't?<eos> A little off?<eos> I watched him go at two dead men with a claw hammer.<eos> I can tell you where he made me dump the bodies.<eos> Ward.<eos> I feel like I can't even... I can't even trust a word you say.<eos> you've been lying to me... all these years.<eos> That was Dad's decision.<eos> But you went along with it.<eos> What about the drug abuse?
I seriously doubt that.<eos> You think your being on the run for one day can compare to my lifetime of abuse?<eos> He killed my parents.<eos> He caused my plane to crash.<eos> How?<eos> How do you know this?<eos> Gao told me.<eos> Jesus.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Danny?
uh... the... the truth is I didn't show you everything.<eos> but I... I didn't wanna upset you.<eos> I know how much Danny means to you.<eos> So I... withheld certain documents.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry if that was the wrong decision.<eos> Okay.<eos> Show them to me now.<eos> I can't.<eos> I gave everything to the DEA.<eos> - Bullshit.

He's... just like he did with Ward.<eos> He won't stop until he destroys our family.<eos> I will not let that lying piece of shit take what is rightfully mine.<eos> Then look me in the eye... and tell me you didn't do it.<eos> That's insane.<eos> I swear on my life I didn't do that.<eos> sweetheart...<eos> Don't...<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Joy.
Then look me in the eye... and tell me you didn't do it.<eos> That's insane.<eos> I swear on my life I didn't do that.<eos> sweetheart...<eos> Don't...<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Joy.<eos> don't let him beat us.<eos> You're stronger than that.<eos> Joy!
That's insane.<eos> I swear on my life I didn't do that.<eos> sweetheart...<eos> Don't...<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Joy.<eos> don't let him beat us.<eos> You're stronger than that.<eos> Joy!<eos> Joy.
Joy!<eos> Joy.<eos> everyone knows what they're doing?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You're gonna need this.<eos> How much is this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> As much as Hogarth would give me.<eos> Sure.
the plan stays the same.<eos> We can't just leave Ward up there.<eos> The plan was to go up if it's clear. guys with guns is the opposite of clear.<eos> let's call the police.<eos> We can't wait for the police.<eos> Harold is dangerous.<eos> Let's not pretend that you care about Ward when we know what this is really about for you.<eos> I'm going in there.<eos> Let's just think about this.<eos> Danny!

Let's just think about this.<eos> Danny!<eos> - Damn it.<eos> - He's gonna get himself killed.<eos> - I can't let him do this alone.<eos> - Colleen!<eos> we stick to the plan. - Just get...<eos> Just get the tablet!<eos> Tell me you're not gonna try to kill Harold!<eos> shit.
we stick to the plan. - Just get...<eos> Just get the tablet!<eos> Tell me you're not gonna try to kill Harold!<eos> shit.<eos> How much for your cart?<eos> - Only thing I'm selling is peanuts.<eos> - This enough?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Shit!
Get out of here!<eos> Shit!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Go get her.<eos> I'll go around the back.<eos> ma'am.<eos> Stop!<eos> You looking for me?<eos> Guns.<eos> Shit.
Just got a call from our guards downstairs.<eos> Danny Rand is here.<eos> he's not bulletproof.<eos> Let's get ready for him.<eos> no.<eos> This way!<eos> There he is!<eos> and I'll hit you again.<eos> I hope like hell you know what you're doing.<eos> Colleen!
he's not bulletproof.<eos> Let's get ready for him.<eos> no.<eos> This way!<eos> There he is!<eos> and I'll hit you again.<eos> I hope like hell you know what you're doing.<eos> Colleen!<eos> we're okay.<eos> Danny!
There he is!<eos> and I'll hit you again.<eos> I hope like hell you know what you're doing.<eos> Colleen!<eos> we're okay.<eos> Danny!<eos> Hey. I got it.<eos> - They're on the roof.<eos> - He is gonna get himself killed.<eos> Danny.
vengeance is the only thing I'm interested in.<eos> I won't stop... until you've paid the price.<eos> Come on. you're just another screwed up little kid... who won't go where I go.<eos> I can go there.<eos> It's my choice!<eos> but you won't. That's why you're gonna die.<eos> Better that than to live like you.<eos> Hated by those who should love you no matter what.<eos> - Ward.<eos> Joy.
Better that than to live like you.<eos> Hated by those who should love you no matter what.<eos> - Ward.<eos> Joy.<eos> - Stop!<eos> Harold!<eos> It's time to face it!<eos> You will only gain the strength of a real Iron Fist after you have killed Harold.<eos> You must rid yourself of this anger.<eos> Joy!
Harold!<eos> It's time to face it!<eos> You will only gain the strength of a real Iron Fist after you have killed Harold.<eos> You must rid yourself of this anger.<eos> Joy!<eos> - No!<eos> - Mom!<eos> No!<eos> Danny.<eos> Oh. Danny boy.
No. No.<eos> finish me off.<eos> I've been here before.<eos> Come out of the darkness so I can see you.<eos> The battle is won.<eos> yeah?<eos> Harold.<eos> I've wasted too many years hating whatever it is you are.<eos> You're going to prison. it's gonna be nowhere near as nice as the one you spent the last 13 years in.<eos> Danny!
Ward.<eos> I was told I'd find you here.<eos> We could have met you at the office.<eos> you know me...<eos> I always enjoy a good cremation.<eos> I just...<eos> I just got off the phone with the agent in charge of the New York DEA.<eos> In light of the fact that you were set up and are going to be making a very generous contribution including the assault against their officers.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - Now what?
In light of the fact that you were set up and are going to be making a very generous contribution including the assault against their officers.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - Now what?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> Up to you.<eos> You... you are a free man.<eos> You should come back to Rand.<eos> the way our fathers should have.<eos> I'm not really a good businessman.<eos> Yeah.
You should come back to Rand.<eos> the way our fathers should have.<eos> I'm not really a good businessman.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna miss Dad.<eos> Who will I blame for my... my weaknesses... my unhappiness?<eos> I understand.<eos> I've spent my whole life feeling like my parents were watching over me.<eos> I really didn't realize there was going to be so much emotional honesty.<eos> uh...

I... I need to explain to Lei Kung why I left.<eos> It was wrong for me to leave the way that I did.<eos> I also need to complete my training.<eos> There's still so much I don't know about being an Iron Fist.<eos> look...<eos> I'm saying this as a friend... but you two share a lot in common.<eos> that's... not a good thing.<eos> Your first instinct to a problem is to respond with violence.<eos> I guess what I'm saying here is... you're both pretty effed up and need some serious psychological help.<eos> All right.
You are more popular than these artifacts.<eos> Replica... just replicas.<eos> Pigments on the Terracotta warriors are mostly natural minerals.<eos> Red is cinnabar and green is malachite. Blue is azurite and purple is barium copper silicate.<eos> This reagent can accurately show the mineral's compositions and color and will not damage the Terracotta warrior.<eos> Come over here.<eos> This is the result of our latest research.<eos> You will find color restoration much easier.<eos> - Hello, director.<eos> - Hello, everyone.
What's up?<eos> Tell me. I just love your no-nonsense style.<eos> Let's go... to your studio.<eos> To my studio?<eos> Why to my studio?<eos> Let me tell you.<eos> From the Palace Museum Research Institute of Rajasthan, India, a lady PhD has come...<eos> Lady PhD from India?<eos> ...obviously to come after your color restoration technique.<eos> Jack.
I'm good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm Zhu Xiaoguang, Professor Chen's TA.<eos> You're Zhu Xiaoguang?<eos> Your thesis is absolutely brilliant.<eos> You've seen my thesis?<eos> We published it together.<eos> My name is Nuomin.<eos> Welcome to China.<eos> Hi, Nuomin.
I'm going to run along.<eos> Director! By the way,<eos> Ashmita, Jack's guest room here is very comfortable.<eos> Director!<eos> This thing... throw it away.<eos> I'll get you a new one.<eos> See you.<eos> Bye bye.<eos> Goodbye, Director.<eos> Nice guy.
Nice guy.<eos> Let me show you to your room?<eos> Sure!<eos> These holes are caused by worms or they stand for lakes?<eos> We will find out in a minute.<eos> She seems to have known we possess this technology.<eos> And now, put your right leg up over your head...<eos> It's too hard for me.<eos> Xiaoguang, move over.<eos> Your turn.

First time.<eos> Xiaoguang, look.<eos> Is he always so energetic?<eos> First time.<eos> - Did you see that? - First time!<eos> Awesome!<eos> We need to find this chap first. He is the son of my good friend.<eos> My friend spent his life searching for the Magadha Treasures and had been for over 20 years.<eos> His son might have inherited those crucial findings after he died.<eos> Jones.

- Let me guess.<eos> You must be Dr. Ashmita's assistant?<eos> Teaching assistant.<eos> May I have the pleasure of knowing your name?<eos> I'm Kyra.<eos> It's a very pretty name.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look at you. You face is turning red.<eos> Professor...<eos> My assistant.
Let's get her in the water.<eos> Okay.<eos> Professor. Here are images of the underground river sent back by Jones' robofish.<eos> Stop!<eos> Look.<eos> There's a space above the surface.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Can you find its location?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uncle Jack.
Under the blue flag is the subterranean space I discovered.<eos> About 1 km away from the outlet of Twin Dragon River's underground water.<eos> If Bhima really came out from there, he must have been under the freezing water at least 7 minutes.<eos> It's impossible without diving gear.<eos> No. It's the Fetal Breath-Holding technique in yoga.<eos> Don't forget, before we were born, we all spent 9 months in our mothers' bellies.<eos> It's not that human beings can't survive under water, it's just that we've forgotten our ability to do so.<eos> World champion free divers can hold their breath for more than 8 minutes.<eos> They all practice yoga.<eos> Hi, Jack!
Thanks.<eos> - It smells really good. - Thank you.<eos> Hey, can you hear it?<eos> The alpha wolf is calling his mates.<eos> Where?<eos> Don't move.<eos> Right behind you.<eos> I see them. Two over there.<eos> The rest are behind the glacier.<eos> Jones.
I am going too.<eos> Remember...<eos> Wait up! We must be meaner than them.<eos> Where are they going?<eos> They are looking for wolves.<eos> We are on their turf now.<eos> Wolves' turf!<eos> We are here to kick ass!<eos> Kick ass!<eos> Kid...
Powerful grip!<eos> Impressive!<eos> Come!<eos> "When lower body moves, the upper leads."<eos> Also, "When upper and lower bodies move, waist moves forward."<eos> "When waist moves, the upper and lower bodies conform."<eos> "Let your body and the environment be one."<eos> "Strike with accuracy."<eos> "Move with swiftness."<eos> You kid!
Scare them away!<eos> Go! They are at my butt, hurry!<eos> Your meaty thigh alone can feed the whole pack of wolves for 3 years!<eos> Ashmita's in China and it looks like they found the location.<eos> So, the men are keeping a very close eye on them.<eos> By the grace of God, we'll finally get that which is rightfully ours.<eos> And the honor of our ancestors will be restored once and for all!<eos> Higher!<eos> That's unbelievable.<eos> Amazing.

Watch out.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Watch your head.<eos> It's beautiful down here.<eos> Bring the equipment down.<eos> Yes, copy that. Right away.<eos> Found the vanished Magadha treasures for the Tang Dynasty in AD 647.<eos> The location is about 30 meters under the ice surface, inside a huge ice cave.<eos> Another tremendous discovery of yours.
What do you see?<eos> The bodies are still intact because they are frozen.<eos> Are you scared?<eos> I am here.<eos> Nothing to be afraid of.<eos> It's real gold.<eos> This is Magadha gold coin.<eos> Kyra, what's that piece of ice you're trying to kill?<eos> It's just Bhima's... headrest.<eos> His headrest?
In here, I'm the government.<eos> Bring all the treasure up.<eos> Tie them up and let them freeze to death.<eos> Yes, boss.<eos> Go! Go! Go!<eos> Put the gun away!<eos> He's just a professor.<eos> Go! Go!<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> Nothing.
Go! Go! Go!<eos> Put the gun away!<eos> He's just a professor.<eos> Go! Go!<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Check her out. - OK.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> - Go! Go! Go!<eos> Jones!
Professor, we will freeze to death.<eos> Xiaoguang, there's a knife next to you.<eos> Grab it with your teeth. Toss it to me.<eos> Are... are you sure?<eos> Archaeologists often deal with human remains.<eos> What's to fear?<eos> He's been dead for 1,300 years.<eos> I am considering finding a new job.<eos> No need!<eos> Yoga.
Yoga.<eos> Can you do it?<eos> Of course!<eos> My arm... Don't do it.<eos> Yes. Let the breath move up the spine, from the perineum to the Third Eye.<eos> Let your lungs fill with air, but focus on the Third Eye.<eos> Now release the breath.<eos> Let it flow back down the spine.<eos> Feel the spine guide the body.<eos> Inhale Exhale.

Thank you.<eos> Bye.<eos> Professor, so many high ranking officials sent you get-well-soon greetings, ah?<eos> That's not what matters.<eos> What matters is we have fulfilled Wang Xuance's wish.<eos> Found the soldiers who went through the ordeal with him.<eos> They are nameless fighters, but they are all witnesses to history.<eos> Professor!<eos> Look!<eos> What?
Professor!<eos> Look!<eos> What?<eos> Diamond of Magadha is to be auctioned in Dubai next week.<eos> Ashmita forwarded that to me.<eos> Professor, she left you a message.<eos> Jack, It's not just a diamond.<eos> It's the key that unlock the Magadha treasures.<eos> We must get it back.<eos> Ashmita.
You see? There's a whip.<eos> Hey pal, I'm not here for vacation. I know.<eos> Tomorrow, you must win the bid for the diamond for me.<eos> Go! Don't worry.<eos> Everything is set. Guarantee to get it.<eos> It is speeding up!<eos> Your camel is foaming at the mouth and moving up.<eos> My camel is catching up!<eos> Faster!<eos> Red! Red!
Faster!<eos> Red! Red!<eos> It's overtaking!<eos> Go! Faster!<eos> I finally won!<eos> Fantastic! I finally won!<eos> Xiaoguang, where are you?<eos> By the pool.<eos> I don't see him here.<eos> What about you?
I finally won!<eos> Fantastic! I finally won!<eos> Xiaoguang, where are you?<eos> By the pool.<eos> I don't see him here.<eos> What about you?<eos> I found Jones.<eos> Come over quickly.<eos> Right away.<eos> This big?
Why are you blushing again?<eos> 90 million dollars, lady in the corner.<eos> Thank you very much. - Raise it.<eos> We are already to 100 million dollars to the young lady in white.<eos> One hundred and ten right here in the corner.<eos> 110 million dollars! Do I hear 120?<eos> 120 million dollars? - Again.<eos> - We've got 110 right now.<eos> 120 million dollars! Thank you very much!<eos> Just a second.
120 million dollars? - Again.<eos> - We've got 110 right now.<eos> 120 million dollars! Thank you very much!<eos> Just a second.<eos> What?<eos> Hope nobody bids again.<eos> I don't think so, already too high.<eos> 130 million dollars!<eos> It's the Prince, dad.<eos> The Prince?
We don't have enough money in the account.<eos> I don't care!<eos> I want the diamond!<eos> No more bidding.<eos> 150 million dollars! Gentlemen in the corner.<eos> 150 million dollars.<eos> Dad, 150 now!<eos> We don't bid anymore.<eos> Consider it a favor to me.<eos> What favor?
You said you only wanted to fulfill your dad's wish and nothing else?<eos> You archaeologists, don't you want an item from the past to see the light again, so people can treasure and preserve it?<eos> The present buyer will surely treasure it because he paid a huge price for it.<eos> Stop finding excuses.<eos> If we don't bring the diamond back, because of you, professor will have to take the blame for stealing cultural relics.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Perhaps we will find the secret behind the diamond.<eos> Now you say "perhaps." That won't do.<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> None of your business!

To get back the diamond for your dad.<eos> OK!<eos> Take it easy brother. Peace be upon you.<eos> Don't get mad! No matter what!<eos> I got it.<eos> Good job!<eos> Patrol 511, road block has been setup at the intersection bridge.<eos> Shit!<eos> Professor!<eos> A big Tibetan Mastiff!
I got it.<eos> Good job!<eos> Patrol 511, road block has been setup at the intersection bridge.<eos> Shit!<eos> Professor!<eos> A big Tibetan Mastiff!<eos> Lion!<eos> - Is it a lion?<eos> - It's a lion!<eos> Nice kitty.

Is that you?<eos> Yes, that's very much me.<eos> But the one I met in China...<eos> I know who you're talking about!<eos> Class, dismissed!<eos> Thank you, Madam.<eos> Please come, come with me. This way, please.<eos> In order to find you, she had to pretend to be me.<eos> Truthfully, she is the 68th generation descendant of Princess Gitanjali of Magadha.<eos> Princess?
Eye of Shiva, whoever possesses it shall possess the entire world.<eos> After Shiva was reincarnated, her Third Eye remained in the mortal world.<eos> Legend has it that it is the key to Magadha imperial treasures.<eos> A thousand years ago, Arunasva mutinied and usurped the throne.<eos> What he was really after was the imperial treasures.<eos> This diamond was most vital to him.<eos> Who's that guy in the ice cave and Dubai?<eos> Why does he want the diamond too?<eos> That's Randall.<eos> The last descendant of Arunasva.
Every year during the festival of the Sun God, the "Path of the Light" is revealed.<eos> I'm sure if we could find the pathway, it will lead us to the treasure.<eos> The festival is tomorrow.<eos> Vedic designers made temples according to astronomical principles.<eos> There's a book about this.<eos> We can start from there.<eos> "Vastu Shastra".<eos> The oldest book ever written about architectural design.<eos> And I know where to find it.<eos> Strange.

Ashmita and professor have found some clue and want us to meet them here.<eos> This is the most popular local bazaar with traditional performing artists.<eos> That dude will surely get a sore throat.<eos> I know about this one.<eos> That is the... Indian rope trick.<eos> You seem to know quite a lot.<eos> This is a traditional trick handed down from ancient India.<eos> When Wang Xuance served as an envoy to the western regions, his memoir "A Journey to Central India" also mentioned it.<eos> How did he do that?<eos> Indian magic.
Bravo!<eos> He will climb up the rope?<eos> Come with me and you won't get hurt.<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Help!<eos> Stay away from Rope Trick.<eos> Help!<eos> Go.<eos> Snakes!
Help!<eos> Stay away from Rope Trick.<eos> Help!<eos> Go.<eos> Snakes!<eos> I hate snakes!<eos> Got you!<eos> Hack!<eos> - Jack! - Professor!<eos> Jack!

Oh, god.<eos> Okay, then tell me about your brothers and sisters at arms.<eos> That's a negative, too, bro.<eos> I don't want any military secrets, just stories.<eos> Eat a dick.<eos> I will shoot Matthews if you don't talk.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> - Yes?<eos> He is your second loss.<eos> First Dean, now Matthews.
- Yes?<eos> He is your second loss.<eos> First Dean, now Matthews.<eos> How the fuck do you know about Dean?<eos> - Keep talking.<eos> - No, fuck you.<eos> You carry his scope around.<eos> What was it your sergeant said?<eos> "A dead man's scope"?<eos> Oh, you...
"A dead man's scope"?<eos> Oh, you...<eos> Just tell me something, Isaac.<eos> Tell me about your comrades.<eos> Or I will shoot Matthews' face off.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> Uh, we, uh... we play ball.<eos> - I beg your pardon?<eos> Uh... yeah, no, me, uh...
Oh, you...<eos> Just tell me something, Isaac.<eos> Tell me about your comrades.<eos> Or I will shoot Matthews' face off.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> Uh, we, uh... we play ball.<eos> - I beg your pardon?<eos> Uh... yeah, no, me, uh...<eos> Me and the squad, we, uh...
Go on.<eos> Go on?<eos> What about sergeant Matthews?<eos> Did he get baked?<eos> Did Dean?<eos> I ain't talking about fucking Dean with you, you dirty fucking hajji.<eos> If I were you, I would start talking, Isaac.<eos> Tell me about Dean.<eos> What's the obsession, huh?<eos> What the fuck?
No, you fucking don't!<eos> You don't know shit.<eos> You're dehydrated... I know that.<eos> That's why I aimed at your water bottle.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> You fucking was trying to hit me.<eos> No.<eos> The water bottle.<eos> Nobody's that fucking accurate.<eos> And your antenna.

The water bottle.<eos> Nobody's that fucking accurate.<eos> And your antenna.<eos> No fucking way.<eos> And your knee.<eos> I know the Popliteal vein in your leg carries enough blood that, no matter what kind of bandaging you have, you will still be sitting in a puddle of plasma.<eos> You're feeling fatigued, lightheaded.<eos> - And you will bleed out before nightfall. - what the fuck is going on with this shit?<eos> You fucker.<eos> You psychotic motherfucker.

No, I'm hiding in the shadow of fucking death.<eos> I'm in the fucking shadow of death.<eos> That's got...<eos> That's got to be a 20 mag.<eos> Eight guys.<eos> It's got to be 20 mag.<eos> One in Matthews, three in me.<eos> That 76...<eos> That 7.62x51 NATO round is U.S. issued?<eos> Hey, motherfucker.
One in Matthews, three in me.<eos> That 76...<eos> That 7.62x51 NATO round is U.S. issued?<eos> Hey, motherfucker.<eos> You want to talk?<eos> Come on, man.<eos> What's up?<eos> You want to know the weapon I'm using.<eos> M24?<eos> Mark 11?
I know you're using a mark 11.<eos> No, you believe that's what I'm using.<eos> But you don't know anything for certain.<eos> Y-you don't know shit.<eos> Is that how you say it?<eos> - "You don't know shit"?<eos> Say that again.<eos> I can't hear you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You...
You are the one who has come to another man's country.<eos> - Camouflaged yourself in his land, in his soil.<eos> No fucking way.<eos> From where I'm sitting, you look very much like the terrorist.<eos> You're in the fucking trash?<eos> No fucking way.<eos> Unless he's a pro.<eos> You're him.<eos> You're Juba.<eos> The ghost.
No fucking way.<eos> Unless he's a pro.<eos> You're him.<eos> You're Juba.<eos> The ghost.<eos> A hundred men out there call themselves Juba.<eos> I'm just a man.<eos> 35 U.S. casualties, angel of death.<eos> That's why they never find you.<eos> Damn.
I'm just a man.<eos> 35 U.S. casualties, angel of death.<eos> That's why they never find you.<eos> Damn.<eos> You must've been days in that fucking shit heap.<eos> So, we trained you, obviously.<eos> Learn how to shoot, trajectory, zeroing the rifle, no reloads between shots.<eos> Learned all that shit and then betrayed us?<eos> Depends on the angle you look at it from.<eos> Only one angle.
Tell me you're my enemy... Fine, I'll respect that.<eos> We kill, we kill.<eos> But say you're my friend and shoot me in the back, the only angle I see is a fucking snake.<eos> But if this friend shoots you in the back and you survive, is it okay to shoot him back?<eos> I want you to tell me something, Isaac.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Why are you still here, Isaac?<eos> How many tours have you done now?<eos> Why do you keep coming back?<eos> Ooh.
You've got to...<eos> How the fuck did I get here?<eos> Is that why?<eos> Be honest with me, Isaac.<eos> Is it because of Dean?<eos> - Just tell me...<eos> How... did you know...<eos> How'd you know that name?<eos> Tell me one thing about him.<eos> Just one thing.
Just one thing.<eos> We were from around about the same area.<eos> His cousins...<eos> Went to the same school as me.<eos> My dad knows his...<eos> Seen his kid.<eos> Held him.<eos> More than Dean's ever done.<eos> Clem works by the fucking stop n' shop.<eos> Clem?
Clem?<eos> Clementine, his wife.<eos> No fucking way.<eos> I can't...<eos> I c...<eos> I can't go back to that.<eos> Fucking day in, day out shit.<eos> And them looking at me.<eos> And they would.<eos> They...
Fuck it, I might just shoot myself.<eos> All right, you asshole, where are you?<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, you stupid motherfucker.<eos> Bite on this, you fucking hajji bitch.<eos> Come on, show me something.<eos> Send it, bitch.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Oh, fuck, aah.<eos> Oh, shit.
Come on, show me something.<eos> Send it, bitch.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Oh, fuck, aah.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> That was foolish, Isaac.<eos> I could've shot you.<eos> I could've easily shot you.<eos> Ize.
Oh, fuck!<eos> That was foolish, Isaac.<eos> I could've shot you.<eos> I could've easily shot you.<eos> Ize.<eos> I just want to have a conversation with you, Isaac.<eos> Why are you trying to get yourself killed?<eos> Isaac, are you there?<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Isaac.

What's wrong with your fucking radio, man?<eos> What is that?<eos> You must've studied his work.<eos> He's an American great.<eos> Writing is really...<eos> What is it?<eos> Not doing a fucking thing.<eos> Did you know that he was an orphan?<eos> He tried to be a soldier, but didn't get very...<eos> Shane.

He trained us.<eos> Trained us to survive.<eos> And won't he be disappointed?<eos> You didn't win shit.<eos> You hear me, motherfucker?<eos> - You didn't win shit.<eos> From a place you will not see...<eos> Comes a sound you will not hear.<eos> Just a flash of fucking light.<eos> Boom.

- My bills aren't a problem.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Have you at least started answering the phone?<eos> Only you could turn that big personal victory into a defeat.<eos> - You know what your problem is?<eos> - Sentences that start like that.<eos> You're not comfortable with what you've become.<eos> - Jessica, you are now a full-blown super...<eos> - Do not say the H-word.<eos> - Jess, I...
And I appreciate that.<eos> - Is there whiskey in this?<eos> - Oh, yeah, that's mine.<eos> Looks like all of your paper-pushing worked.<eos> Uncuff the superstar.<eos> Get him out of my sight.<eos> My bad.<eos> These belong to you.<eos> Mr. Lucas?<eos> Mr. Cage?

We all did some impressive book-cracking.<eos> Plus, you made it through a prison stint without throwing a single punch.<eos> I'm sure that was hard for a person with your...<eos> - I know.<eos> - Reputation.<eos> - Is, uh... Claire coming?<eos> - It's lawyers only in here.<eos> Well, if you'll excuse me, I have a bus to catch.<eos> Of course.<eos> Uh, just one last thing.
Would be quote... quote, unquote, "good for the community."<eos> Mr. Berkowitz, in your professional...<eos> What the hell are you doing? 'Sup, man?<eos> I'll bust your goddamn head!<eos> - Oh, yeah? Let's go, then.<eos> - What's up?<eos> - You wanna try something?<eos> - Come at me.<eos> Let's go!<eos> NYPD!
NYPD!<eos> Break it up!<eos> That's enough.<eos> - You, up on the sidewalk.<eos> - Yes, sir, officer.<eos> Mr. Berkowitz... In your professional opinion, was it good for Aaron James?<eos> Our sympathies go out to the family.<eos> The whole thing... It's very unfortunate.<eos> Were you aware the products used in your new station were hazardous to children?<eos> - Objection!
You gotta take it back.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Murdock.<eos> Thank you, Ms. Page.<eos> It's okay. You can be proud of yourself.<eos> A little. I won't tell anyone.<eos> You, uh, here for a statement?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Hey, you maybe wanna go... do that over a bite or...<eos> Oh, uh... Sure, yeah.
- Mr. Murdock...<eos> - Mr. Murdock, sir...<eos> Yes...<eos> You abandoned them.<eos> Because of you, the Hand has won.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> After they raised you... after they gave you everything you are... you let them die.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> - Danny.

They're free.<eos> - Money is not an issue.<eos> Something is wrong and I know it.<eos> John's like clockwork.<eos> He's an architect.<eos> He goes to work every morning at eight.<eos> He comes back home every night at 6:30.<eos> - But lately, he's...<eos> - He's been different?<eos> Secretive?
- And it's not like him.<eos> Because he's cheating on you, okay?<eos> Nothing to be ashamed about.<eos> It happens all the time.<eos> - You don't know him like I do.<eos> - I don't need to.<eos> But you came to me and I'm giving you my professional opinion.<eos> You need a divorce lawyer.<eos> Thank you for your time, Ms. Jones.<eos> Yeah, thanks so much.

Jessica Jones, do yourself a favor and don't look for John Raymond.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Should we get that coffee?<eos> Waiting on you was a heck of a gamble.<eos> For all I knew, you could've sucked at this.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - Well, I hope I was worth it.<eos> You got potential.<eos> - "Potential"? Yeah? - Mm-hmm.

Yeah? - Mm-hmm.<eos> There were some really rough days inside.<eos> But your letters...
Look, right now, the only thing you need to worry about is you.<eos> Look, if you're talking about getting a job, I have every intention of doing just that.<eos> Doing what?<eos> How does being Harlem's hero allow you to live an actual life?<eos> I'll find a way.<eos> Right now, just... I just wanna help people.<eos> I wanna do that, too.<eos> But call me selfish... I wanna see you take care of yourself.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Hey. - Hey.
- Actually, I was, uh...<eos> - It won't take long, I promise.<eos> Number two in the window.<eos> Great story last week.<eos> The, uh... thing with the school board scandal.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, Ellison's pretty much given me free reign.<eos> It feels like what I'm meant to be doing or...<eos> I don't know if that makes any sense.<eos> Yeah. Of course.
Thank you.<eos> Yeah, Ellison's pretty much given me free reign.<eos> It feels like what I'm meant to be doing or...<eos> I don't know if that makes any sense.<eos> Yeah. Of course.<eos> It looks like you're doing what you always wanted to.<eos> Yeah, it's been a transition from the Nelson and Murdock days, from the partnership but, uh...<eos> No, the pro bono work does make me happy.<eos> - That's great. That's really...<eos> - Coffee?
No, the pro bono work does make me happy.<eos> - That's great. That's really...<eos> - Coffee?<eos> - Yes, thank you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Sugar's on the left. Cream's here on the right.<eos> - Cream on the right.<eos> Thank you. - Yes. You're welcome.<eos> - Sorry, it got...<eos> - Yeah.
The NYPD is prevailing.<eos> I report on it every day, and crime rate's down.<eos> I really think that Daredevil may have made the city a safer place.<eos> He might have.<eos> But right now, the city's better off without him.<eos> Well, it's better off with Matt Murdock.<eos> Speaking of which, Mr. Murdock... I would like to take your statement on today's miraculous Aaron James verdict.<eos> Hit me.<eos> Hey. - No.<eos> - What?
You took a case.<eos> I can tell.<eos> - You've got that glow about you.<eos> - I did not take a case...<eos> - yet.<eos> - Who is that?<eos> - Don't read over my shoulder.<eos> - Okay.<eos> It's an architect, huh?<eos> - Another cheater?
But then I got a call.<eos> Someone used a voice scrambler and told me not to take the case.<eos> Bet you loved that, didn't you?<eos> Graduated MIT.<eos> Designed two skyscrapers in Dubai and four in Manhattan.<eos> He is squeaky clean.<eos> You think she's right?<eos> Maybe. Maybe he's tired of being the good guy.<eos> Maybe he's on a bender. Maybe he's knee-deep in some intern.<eos> - Gross.

Maybe he's knee-deep in some intern.<eos> - Gross.<eos> - Very.<eos> So, what are your leads?<eos> I'm not looking for leads, Malcolm, because I haven't take the case.<eos> Yeah, right.
Down payment in cash.<eos> What's the connection between them?<eos> Run their names, you talk to people...<eos> No guns, no drugs, just a new job, off the books.<eos> Doing what?<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> You ready for the real sad part?<eos> You remember Candace?<eos> This close to testifying against Mariah?<eos> Murder still unsolved?
If we speed the process, it will not be quiet.<eos> I'm aware.<eos> I will inform the others.<eos> Good.<eos> Send my regards when you do.<eos> And, uh... finish feeding the birds, will you?<eos> They're starving today.<eos> You guys know where I can find Cole?<eos> What's it to you?<eos> Uh, one floor up.

Do you think your brother's death could somehow be related to hers?<eos> No. I don't think...<eos> No, what happened to Sean was, um... was more like an accident.<eos> - You sure about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I heard he got a new job.<eos> I ain't know nothing about that.<eos> I mean, we didn't talk about everything.<eos> That was his business.<eos> Of course.
No. I don't think...<eos> No, what happened to Sean was, um... was more like an accident.<eos> - You sure about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I heard he got a new job.<eos> I ain't know nothing about that.<eos> I mean, we didn't talk about everything.<eos> That was his business.<eos> Of course.<eos> What about you?
Yo, man, I ain't your son!<eos> I told you, I don't know a damn thing.<eos> Whatever you're doing, you're gonna get yourself hurt.<eos> Think about your mom.<eos> What she's already been through.<eos> I think you should go.<eos> The only way to help me is to make me bulletproof, too.<eos> It's too late for heroes.<eos> Hero's your word.<eos> Not mine.
Not mine.<eos> - I want my money.<eos> I'm gonna get it. You got till the end of the day, or I'm coming back here to bust some shit up!<eos> Hey, John Raymond, it's Jessica Jones.<eos> I'm, uh... returning your call.<eos> You remember the one where you tried to scare me?<eos> The guy downstairs said you were here.<eos> Dude, I don't care what weird shit you're into, but we gotta talk.<eos> All right, well, you're gonna pay for this.<eos> Holy shit.
What's happening?<eos> All units, we got a 10-66.<eos> Requesting backup immediately.<eos> - I can't open my door!<eos> - Take what you can. Hey!<eos> What the hell do you kids think you're doing?<eos> - Shit!
Come on. Run!<eos> Don't you run from me... you looter sons of bitches!<eos> There they go!<eos> Get the other gun!<eos> Guys, hurry!<eos> They're coming!<eos> Hurry, this way!<eos> Come on!<eos> Please, stop. We'll leave...<eos> Oh, shit!
Hey, Jess.<eos> It's me calling you for the third or fourth or 19th time.<eos> I hear your neighborhood was hit pretty hard, so call me so I know you're okay.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Excuse me. I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm running late for work.<eos> - Can I sneak through?<eos> - You can try.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Holy shit.
What do I tell my kids?<eos> After everything we've been through, we can't help but think it's the incident or terrorism.<eos> True, but there's nothing to worry about.<eos> The mayor's office confirmed this morning, it was a 4.6 magnitude earthquake.<eos> A shallow one, actually, centered in Hell's Kitchen.<eos> I'm told seismologists are looking at a fault line on the Hudson to see if it could be the source of the problem.<eos> Jane from Brooklyn, you're on Trish Talk.<eos> What did you feel last night?<eos> Not an earthquake, that's for sure.<eos> Right.
I want your thoughts next.<eos> Trish Talk, stay tuned.<eos> Thanks for listening.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> The interview with the school superintendent, boss says it's going on now.<eos> - Did you cut off my call?<eos> - They called from upstairs.<eos> Said we gotta lay off the earthquake stuff.<eos> I don't know why, but from the tone they used, it was not a conversation.<eos> Detective Knight.
No records downstairs.<eos> Place like this, company motto is "No questions asked."<eos> The FBI showed up just after we did.<eos> And Homeland Security's on the way.<eos> So whatever this is, we got orders to keep it away from the press.<eos> - What is this?<eos> We got a body?<eos> - Worse.<eos> Looks like you were right.<eos> Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.<eos> I told you these assholes were transporting explosives.<eos> We sure it's them?<eos> Uh, at the very least, I think it's connected.<eos> Maybe the fireworks are theirs, and maybe somebody stole them from 'em.<eos> I just sign the overtime.<eos> This shit's for you to figure out.<eos> - Well, who called this in?<eos> - Oh, now that's where it gets funny.<eos> Jessica Jones.
So the guy who rented this room...<eos> I already told you, I didn't see him.<eos> He was gone before I got here.<eos> Now I have been here four hours.<eos> Can I go now, dipshit?<eos> You're done when we're done.<eos> You got a mouth.<eos> You noticed.<eos> Ms. Jones, you can go for now.<eos> Stupid son of a bitch.
You got a mouth.<eos> You noticed.<eos> Ms. Jones, you can go for now.<eos> Stupid son of a bitch.<eos> Can you believe this chick?<eos> Did she just take...<eos> Looks like we're good.<eos> I don't see any damage.<eos> And thank God. No one told me I'd need earthquake insurance in New York.<eos> Danny?

It's my fight.<eos> Yeah. You keep saying that, but whoever he was, he was trained.<eos> And he was also willing to die.<eos> He might not have died if I hadn't left my post in K'un-Lun.<eos> - I know that you are angry...<eos> - This isn't about anger.<eos> It's about fault.<eos> All I'm saying is you're not the only person the Hand has ever hurt.<eos> It was his fight, too.<eos> And mine.
And what if he didn't?<eos> Then we keep looking.<eos> What if it's a trap?<eos> Then we fight our way out of it.<eos> Danny, what?<eos> You and I, we... We haven't had the greatest luck trusting other people.<eos> Yeah... but do you trust me?<eos> Of course.<eos> God damn it. God damn it.<eos> Foggy.

Foggy.<eos> Hey, Foggy.<eos> Just keep it clean.<eos> Not a lot of people have insurance here.<eos> Yeah? At least nobody died.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> You know, most people get out of jail and they, uh... pop a beer.<eos> Maybe I will go get a drink.<eos> I was thinking about going by Elmore's tonight.<eos> - Elmore's?
- Elmore's?<eos> - Yeah, the bar on Douglass.<eos> Oh, I know it.<eos> Has a reputation for a certain kind of crowd.<eos> That's kinda what I was hoping.<eos> Are you hunting criminals?<eos> 'Cause I thought you said you were gonna take it easy on that for a while.<eos> Look, someone's hiring young men in Harlem to do their dirty work.<eos> Misty said the NYPD doesn't know what these young men are doing, but the body count's growing, so...<eos> Okay.
It was a direct response.<eos> All Brahms wanted was to prove that he could do it, too.<eos> He was petty like that.<eos> Your insight on music history, it never ceases to amaze me.<eos> Oh, it's nothing.<eos> It's just stuff I picked up along the way.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> Of course.<eos> - There's been a complication.<eos> - What kind?
Like, they're changing their name, shell company stuff.<eos> Yet, I have no idea what it is they actually do.<eos> Oh, so what do you need from me?<eos> The oldest record dates back to 1820, but as crazy as this sounds, I need to go back further than that.<eos> Oh, well, you... you wanna go to the historical branch uptown.<eos> And you'll need an appointment.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Actually, you don't.<eos> Jessica, we need to talk.<eos> Hogarth.
Stop worrying about me.<eos> This only looks like plastic, but I'm telling you it's solid gold.<eos> Earthquake has everyone going crazy.<eos> Nobody's paying attention to the little things, like what is or isn't in their wallets.<eos> - Welcome back, big man. - We need to talk.<eos> - This is how you talk?<eos> - I want answers, Turk.<eos> How I get 'em is up to you.<eos> Cage, what part of this shit looks like it's up to me?<eos> Mariah and Shades...
White suit, Panama hat, alligator shoes.<eos> - Where can I find him?<eos> - I've only seen him a couple times.<eos> Try around 151st and Amsterdam.<eos> If this isn't the truth, I'll be back.<eos> And you won't like me then.<eos> I don't like you now.<eos> Hello?<eos> Is it weird that I wanna live here?<eos> Danny.
I don't like you now.<eos> Hello?<eos> Is it weird that I wanna live here?<eos> Danny.<eos> Danny, this is a Tsukamoto.<eos> Just like the one you showed me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you don't sharpen these.<eos> Unless you plan on using them.<eos> Danny...
Unless you plan on using them.<eos> Danny...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It hasn't been long.<eos> He's still warm.<eos> Someone was dragged out of here.<eos> This must have been the Hand.<eos> Then who are these people?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Danny?
What is it?<eos> It's K'un-Lun.<eos> - Misty, it's Luke.<eos> - Hey. I think I found something.<eos> You should get a warrant and get down here.<eos> - Am I making arrests?<eos> - Think so.<eos> It's about those kids.<eos> I may have found a lead.<eos> Luke?
You should get a warrant and get down here.<eos> - Am I making arrests?<eos> - Think so.<eos> It's about those kids.<eos> I may have found a lead.<eos> Luke?<eos> Where are you?<eos> I need an address.<eos> - Never mind.<eos> - What?
It's about those kids.<eos> I may have found a lead.<eos> Luke?<eos> Where are you?<eos> I need an address.<eos> - Never mind.<eos> - What?<eos> - I gotta take care of someone first.<eos> - No.<eos> Luke...
How's your case load?<eos> I need you to keep an eye on something.<eos> - Happy to.<eos> - But it's gotta be off the record.<eos> Okay.<eos> Someone who used to work here, a freelancer...<eos> She has a tendency to go rogue.<eos> Her name is Jessica Jones.<eos> Now you and I never had this conversation, but the second she gets herself into trouble, priority one is keeping that trouble very far away from us.<eos> Okay.
Her name is Jessica Jones.<eos> Now you and I never had this conversation, but the second she gets herself into trouble, priority one is keeping that trouble very far away from us.<eos> Okay.<eos> So... Sorry, uh, just to be clear... this is all just in case? She's not in trouble now?<eos> I wish.<eos> With Jessica, it's just a matter of time.<eos> Hey.<eos> Jess, where have you been?<eos> - Sorry, I had a long day.<eos> - Me, too.
Who's they?<eos> Who do you think is after you?<eos> I can't tell you. I...<eos> This... this is not me.<eos> I'm a good man.<eos> Make sure you tell her that.<eos> Okay, with any luck, you're gonna tell her that yourself.<eos> Now your family is worried.<eos> They just wanted to know what happened.<eos> And the cops...
And the cops...<eos> They just wanna know why you started stockpiling explosives.<eos> What?<eos> There's nowhere to go.<eos> They'll find me.<eos> They'll... they'll hurt me.<eos> To be honest, if you hurt my friend, I'm gonna hurt you worse.<eos> I was just trying to stop them.<eos> - They're gonna take down the city.<eos> - Who?
- Who are you?<eos> - You all right? - What are you doing?<eos> In between gigs, huh?<eos> - You back for more?<eos> - Oh... we've not even started.<eos> What are you made of?<eos> Just remember, you started this.<eos> Stay down.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Danny!
You know who I am, I know who you are, so let's skip the wartime banter.<eos> Time is not something I can afford to waste.<eos> Not for your benefit but for mine, I'm taking the blinds off.<eos> Try not to bite, old friend.<eos> It's undignified.<eos> Alexandra.<eos> Stick.<eos> We have so much to talk about.<eos> - Are these necessary?<eos> - Standard protocol.
It's undignified.<eos> Alexandra.<eos> Stick.<eos> We have so much to talk about.<eos> - Are these necessary?<eos> - Standard protocol.<eos> Nothing personal.<eos> John Raymond, the body we found in your office slash apartment.<eos> Malcolm Ducasse, your friend being interrogated down the hall.<eos> And Jessica...

Thank you, Kadir.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Please tell your wife she makes it even better than they did in Constantinople.<eos> I think you mean Istanbul, ma'am.<eos> Constantinople, this is its ancient name.<eos> Of course.<eos> The Black Sky.
This is your home now.<eos> We are your family.<eos> I have waited so long to meet you.<eos> Easy.<eos> Easy, my child. Easy.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You'll need your strength.<eos> Language will come back to you.<eos> So will your instincts.<eos> But everything else...
I have waited so long to meet you.<eos> Easy.<eos> Easy, my child. Easy.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You'll need your strength.<eos> Language will come back to you.<eos> So will your instincts.<eos> But everything else...<eos> I'm afraid it wasn't worth keeping anyway.<eos> You...
Easy.<eos> Easy, my child. Easy.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You'll need your strength.<eos> Language will come back to you.<eos> So will your instincts.<eos> But everything else...<eos> I'm afraid it wasn't worth keeping anyway.<eos> You...<eos> You...
But now that we've been brought together... that's not something we need to worry about.<eos> Who?<eos> Who?<eos> My child... you... are everything.<eos> You are everything.<eos> It doesn't matter what you choose.<eos> You are the Black Sky.<eos> In the end, you are the weapon.<eos> Wakizashi.<eos> Good choice.
Not anymore.<eos> Shame.<eos> I grew to like that part.<eos> Danny Rand has been running around off the grid for months.<eos> He thinks he's a one-man army.<eos> He's a real handful.<eos> I've seen better.<eos> Still, you'll spend the rest of your days looking over your shoulder.<eos> And from what I hear... those days are numbered.<eos> Now...
He's a real handful.<eos> I've seen better.<eos> Still, you'll spend the rest of your days looking over your shoulder.<eos> And from what I hear... those days are numbered.<eos> Now...<eos> - that's the Alexandra I know.<eos> - Pay attention.<eos> You make a new friend? No, Stick.<eos> I took one of yours.<eos> - Elektra.
He's a weapon. You're a monster.<eos> What else?<eos> After a lifetime of serving K'un-Lun... you don't even know what he is.<eos> No.<eos> But I know what I am.<eos> You asked for it... Elektra.<eos> You'll die here tonight, old man.<eos> - Finally.<eos> - Don't you bet on it.<eos> Son of a bitch.
- so in the meantime... - Don't leave town.<eos> Yeah, I know the drill.<eos> Ms. Jones, can...<eos> Look, there's no easy way to say this.<eos> I read your file.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> What you can do.<eos> I know what happened with Kilgrave, so if...<eos> - This has nothing to do with that. - Okay, great.<eos> Then...
- This has nothing to do with that. - Okay, great.<eos> Then...<eos> Look, I'm... I'm just saying, legally, if there's anything, this will stay between us if... this was...<eos> There's anything not, uh, ordinary about this case.<eos> What part of "I know the drill" did you not understand?<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Great.<eos> Then I guess you're free to go.<eos> Malcolm?
He wanted to get away.<eos> Doesn't make sense.<eos> I came to you... for answers.<eos> Well, the NYPD is on the case, but between us, I would like to keep investigating.<eos> - You mean without the police?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know how much I can afford.<eos> - Don't worry about that right now.<eos> Now, is there anything you haven't told me?<eos> Drugs?
- Hi, sweetie.<eos> How are you? - Hi, Mom.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'm sure we'll find out soon.<eos> Why don't we lay you down, and you can let me fix you supper.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> Um... tell your mom I let myself out.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, I'm returning a call from Ms. Anna Asher.<eos> - What?
I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> Um... tell your mom I let myself out.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, I'm returning a call from Ms. Anna Asher.<eos> - What?<eos> - This is Duncan and Dotter Design.<eos> Oh, right, this is her.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Um, can you come in this afternoon?<eos> - Sure.

Sorry.<eos> - Um, can you come in this afternoon?<eos> - Sure.<eos> 211 10th Avenue, suite 305. - 305.<eos> Got it.<eos> - Thank you, Ms. Asher.<eos> You can fight.<eos> You can take a punch.<eos> Claire said they did experiments on you.<eos> Long story.
You can take a punch.<eos> Claire said they did experiments on you.<eos> Long story.<eos> What kind?<eos> Was it voluntary?<eos> They made me this way.<eos> That's all you need to know.<eos> What did you mean, "chi"?<eos> It's a... It's an energy force.<eos> - Okay.
It's going better than I thought it would.<eos> I know how it sounds, but it's true. You gotta admit, that dragon shit, from the outside... - does sound pretty crazy.<eos> You really think they can help each other out?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Once they're done with the pissing contest who knows?<eos> Claire says you're a good guy.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> She says you've done a lot for Harlem.<eos> Yeah, I just... just wanna help.<eos> Me, too.
And I know privilege when I see it.<eos> You may think you earned your strength, but you had power the day you were born.<eos> Before the dragons.<eos> Before the chi.<eos> You have the ability to change the world without getting anybody hurt.<eos> These people won't be stopped that way.<eos> You're taking the war to the ones at the bottom, is that it?<eos> If I were in your shoes, I'd think twice about using that thing on people who are trying to feed their families.<eos> This isn't gonna work out, it's obvious.<eos> Good luck, man.
- Uh, Paris, Miami...<eos> - Phnom Penh, Cambodia.<eos> I'm cross-referencing short-term holdings through those cities.<eos> Two hundred exist in the overlap.<eos> Three of them shut down last year.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Not much, except that they were shut down on the same day.<eos> Before they closed, they all made deposits into one place here in New York.<eos> I just need a name.<eos> Midland Circle Financial.
After hours.<eos> No.<eos> There's another way to attack.<eos> And I gotta do this alone.<eos> - Gorgeous, isn't it? - Mmm.<eos> Like all of our projects, it was built with sustainability in mind.<eos> - Yeah, I am super into that.<eos> - I'm glad, Ms. Asher.<eos> Now, why don't you tell me what you envisioned for your company's...<eos> - Communal workspace. - Ah.
- Yeah, I am super into that.<eos> - I'm glad, Ms. Asher.<eos> Now, why don't you tell me what you envisioned for your company's...<eos> - Communal workspace. - Ah.<eos> Um, I mean, we're gonna need a juice bar.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Uh, standing desks.<eos> You know those bouncy balls that people sit on that some people find annoying?<eos> I think it should be modern and high-tech, but also so simple.<eos> A pragmatic utopia.
- I'm sorry?<eos> - Anything from this year?<eos> - Not that I've done.<eos> How about any other architect in your firm?<eos> Just because it's really important for our brand that we're not only on the cutting edge, but we are the cutting edge.<eos> Yes, but... can you keep a secret?<eos> I am the face of discretion.<eos> I can show you our most recent work.<eos> A building in Hell's Kitchen, designed by my colleague John Raymond.<eos> - Midland Circle.
You can't admit when you done something right.<eos> Uh, Cole wanted me to bring these to you.<eos> They're lotto tickets.<eos> He said he wanted you to know he was thinking about you.<eos> There is goodness in that boy.<eos> You know, he'd been bringin' me these since he was eight years old?<eos> At first, I didn't know how he was paying for them.<eos> And then I realized he was using his lunch money.<eos> He said it was worth it... to keep the dream alive.<eos> How 'bout some cookies?
How 'bout some cookies?<eos> Chocolate chip.<eos> Did he tell you I keep them?<eos> There's a... a box in there, but it's too high up for me.<eos> Cole's always the one who does it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yes, this is she.<eos> What do you mean, some kind of accident?<eos> They say he was in his cell when it happened.<eos> My... my baby. My baby...

You're the Hand.<eos> And I'm gonna make sure...<eos> Mr. Rand.<eos> I appreciate your candor. And your passion.<eos> And I must say, considering what I've heard about you, you seem much more disciplined than I anticipated.<eos> - And who are you?<eos> - I'm in charge.<eos> But, please, go on.<eos> You were telling us what you were going to do.<eos> - Murdock!
I am the Immortal Iron Fist, weapon of K'un-Lun.<eos> - And I'm fulfilling my destiny.<eos> - K'un-Lun.<eos> How is it these days?<eos> You're gonna lose everything.<eos> Just like I did.<eos> You haven't lost everything, Mr. Rand.<eos> Not yet.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Gunshot.
- How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.<eos> This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.<eos> I need that.<eos> I've crossed paths with Iron Fists before, but this is different, because this time...<eos> I won't kill you.<eos> No use using her for protection.<eos> They will rip right through her to get to you.<eos> Come on!<eos> - You?

- Jessica?<eos> - Luke.<eos> - How you been?<eos> - Long story.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> - Who's he?<eos> - Longer story. Who's he?<eos> Wait.<eos> There's someone else coming.<eos> Something else.
- Long story.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> - Who's he?<eos> - Longer story. Who's he?<eos> Wait.<eos> There's someone else coming.<eos> Something else.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Oh, shit.
Wait.<eos> There's someone else coming.<eos> Something else.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Bad news.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> Elektra?
I still hear neon.<eos> Who hears neon?<eos> My blind-but-maybe-not lawyer. You're what?<eos> What do you mean he's blind?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I thought he was sent to spy on me, and now I'm not so sure.<eos> - You think he's on our side?<eos> - Our side of what?<eos> - Who's Karate Kid?<eos> - Danny Rand.

- These people, they're dangerous.<eos> - So am I.<eos> Now, somebody tell me what I need to know about the Hand, so I can be on my way.<eos> What is that?<eos> Um, as, uh... as part of the deal, he made me order four of everything.<eos> We're not here to eat.<eos> - Uh, are those pork?<eos> - No, they're shrimp.<eos> This guy's got pork.<eos> - Ah, great!
- Immortality.<eos> They want power and influence at every level across the world.<eos> And I think they want me.<eos> - For your money?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm the Immortal Iron Fist.<eos> Come again?<eos> Sworn protector of K'un-Lun.<eos> What are you on?<eos> Lithium?
I'm the Immortal Iron Fist.<eos> Come again?<eos> Sworn protector of K'un-Lun.<eos> What are you on?<eos> Lithium?<eos> So, who was the woman with the swords?<eos> Look, I'm not sure, but I fought her in Cambodia.<eos> Yeah, and she showed up at my doorstep.<eos> She's the one that came after your client?<eos> Yeah. Why?
I'm not threatening you. I'm just stating the obvious.<eos> They saw you fight.<eos> How you're hiding your face.<eos> They're two seconds away from figuring it out themselves.<eos> - What do you want from me?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> And I want zero to do with this ancient organization.<eos> I just want to crack my case.<eos> And judging by the way you sprung into action, I think you want the same thing.<eos> Your call, Murdock.
And judging by the way you sprung into action, I think you want the same thing.<eos> Your call, Murdock.<eos> My name is Matthew.<eos> I'd erase all the marks of your past, if I could.<eos> Your life is new.<eos> But sadly, your body is not.<eos> This is how I died?<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> All that matters now is how you live.<eos> The Black Sky.
- It's not.<eos> What I'm saying is, going at them head on, that'll get you killed.<eos> Only if we do it alone.<eos> No.<eos> Look, these people took everything from me.<eos> I'm gonna take them down, one way or another.<eos> I wanted to help one kid. One family.<eos> I'm the first to admit when I'm in over my head, and this is way past my threshold.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Bulletproof.

How obvious does it have to be?<eos> This... - This cannot be an accident.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I know you mean well, but we're not whatever you think we are.<eos> All right?<eos> We're four very different people, and while we might all have been trying to do some good, we need to be rational about how we proceed.<eos> Oh, you gotta be kidding me.<eos> This... is one shitty excuse for a hideout.<eos> Stick.<eos> Matty.

We will.<eos> Then we're not close enough.<eos> The problem with your leadership has always been your inability to get your hands dirty.<eos> In all our time together, I have never asked for your advice.<eos> And why would you?<eos> Now that you have the Black Sky by your side.<eos> The Iron Fist was not alone.<eos> Was the Chaste not extinguished?<eos> He seems to have found some allies.<eos> Three of them.

That's what families do, isn't it?<eos> And what of your Black Sky?<eos> The thing you spent our final resources on.<eos> More powerful than you could ever imagine.<eos> Does this mean our faithful leader herself will also join the fight?<eos> As always, I do what's necessary.<eos> Then, as we used to say...<eos> "Together, we serve life itself."<eos> "Together, we serve life itself."<eos> Black Sky.
How come no one told me?<eos> There are things I don't know.<eos> Why are you here, Stick?<eos> Because this one, the Immortal Iron Fist, living weapon and protector of the ancient city,<eos> is still a thundering dumbass. Shit like that... will get you killed.<eos> I tried to call Colleen.<eos> I told her where I was.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Safer than we are.<eos> Small mistakes.

Shit like that... will get you killed.<eos> I tried to call Colleen.<eos> I told her where I was.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Safer than we are.<eos> Small mistakes.<eos> Personal ties.
- This is between me and him.<eos> - Hey, we are all in danger.<eos> I don't know you very well, Mr. Cage, you seem like a good guy, so trust me when I tell you that with this old man, nothing is sacred.<eos> Kid, it's not just one of us this time.<eos> It's the whole goddamn city we're talking about.<eos> We're talking about their lives, Stick. We're talking about the lives of their loved ones.<eos> - Wait, um, what?<eos> - Those tremors that shook up the place, they're nothing compared to what comes next.<eos> The Hand's done it before.<eos> Pompeii, Chernobyl.
Events the history books like to call catastrophes, just cover-ups.<eos> 'Cause New York is next.<eos> And the only thing keeping Manhattan from crumbling to a pile of dust... is the four of you.<eos> All right, I am done with this tin-foil-hat shit.<eos> - Whoa, where are you going?<eos> - I tried to hang in, guys.<eos> I really did.<eos> But whatever this guy's selling, I ain't buying.<eos> Sit down and shut up.<eos> - Jessica.

I really did.<eos> But whatever this guy's selling, I ain't buying.<eos> Sit down and shut up.<eos> - Jessica.<eos> - It's not gonna work.<eos> I know parts of this sound crazy.<eos> Parts of it?<eos> Throw out all this mystical, ancient conspiracy stuff, and you're still left with one hard fact.<eos> People are gonna get hurt.<eos> - Not you.
That's a concept you might want to try on sometime.<eos> Give me a break.<eos> Hey, these abilities that you have such contempt for... they might do some good right now.<eos> This war, or whatever it is, this is not my problem.<eos> I want answers, too.<eos> And I'll play along with all this crazy stuff if it helps me to find them.<eos> I don't know what it is that makes you care so much about other people, but that's not me.<eos> It was good to see you.<eos> Let me know when they fit you for a costume.<eos> Jessica.
You know what? We are not talking about this, all right?<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> But I think you two have got a lot to learn from each other.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - I'm done taking lessons, Stick.<eos> Lessons ain't done with you.<eos> This isn't her fight.<eos> Sooner or later, it's gonna be everybody's fight.<eos> Not if I can help it.<eos> Me neither.
This isn't her fight.<eos> Sooner or later, it's gonna be everybody's fight.<eos> Not if I can help it.<eos> Me neither.<eos> All right. Let's just get this over with.<eos> Seems like now is the time for you to tell us everything we need to know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yes, there's been a change of plans.<eos> I have other business tonight.<eos> All right.
Thank you.<eos> Yes, there's been a change of plans.<eos> I have other business tonight.<eos> All right.<eos> Delete.<eos> That's the same person.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Nobody knows when it started.<eos> Centuries ago.<eos> Millennia.
And so, like Lucifer from heaven, the five were banished from K'un-Lun forever.<eos> They became the five fingers of the Hand.<eos> I came face-to-face with a woman at Midland Circle.<eos> She said she was the Hand.<eos> She's had a lot of names throughout the years.<eos> In my lifetime, Alexandra.<eos> And she's led them since the beginning.<eos> When they dispersed, they all went back to their mother countries, each finger ruling over its own domain.<eos> Growing in power and influence.<eos> Madame Gao?
- You calm down, Luke.<eos> You don't get second chances with these people, all right?<eos> If you're not careful, the next thing you know, you're dead.<eos> Or worse, you're holding the people you love the most in the world and... You get the privilege of watching them die.<eos> All right, maybe this city is at stake.<eos> Maybe this fight is important. I get that.<eos> I'm just saying, imagine knowing for the rest of your life, you only made it worse by getting involved. Jesus.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What time is it?<eos> Late. Or early.
I'm just saying, imagine knowing for the rest of your life, you only made it worse by getting involved. Jesus.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What time is it?<eos> Late. Or early.<eos> Depending on your life choices.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> How you holding up?<eos> Fine.<eos> I mean... as well as we can be.<eos> And your daughter?
How you holding up?<eos> Fine.<eos> I mean... as well as we can be.<eos> And your daughter?<eos> She's asleep.<eos> - Are you drunk?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean... it doesn't matter.<eos> - You wanna come inside?<eos> - No, I just...
I just wanted to say, you might be right.<eos> So whatever your husband got into, it just keeps getting weirder and weirder.<eos> - What do you know?<eos> - I can't say, but I'm gonna work on getting you guys some protection.<eos> - Like, around-the-clock surveillance.<eos> Please don't ask.<eos> - No, I just mean...<eos> I thought you already did that.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - The car.
We fix this thing together.<eos> Then that path comes to an end.<eos> Last one?<eos> I'm glad you found others.<eos> Don't act like this is normal.<eos> Don't act like I don't know what's really going on with you.<eos> You crossed paths with her, too?<eos> With who?<eos> Don't bullshit me.<eos> Elektra.
- I don't know.<eos> I can't... I can't tell.<eos> Well, I'll be goddamned.<eos> This wouldn't be my first choice, but I am a sucker for fortune cookies.<eos> You know, I thought it would be a good idea if we all talked this over... like adults.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You surprised me, Stick.<eos> You've become so resourceful in your old age.<eos> What have you become in yours?<eos> Determined.
They will disappoint you.<eos> They haven't yet.<eos> They will not make you stronger.<eos> And if I might give you some advice, the more connections you have, the easier it will be to break you.<eos> What do you want to do with him?<eos> Well, I can't disclose that.<eos> But I'll tell you what I'm willing to do for him.<eos> I'll assemble all the resources my organization has to offer.<eos> You remember the last time all the fingers of the Hand came together, don't you, Stick?<eos> - A goddamn culling.
- She's annoying.<eos> - Tell me about it.<eos> Where's Alexandra?<eos> Get down!<eos> Dude, get off me.<eos> Now it's a goddamn party.<eos> - Who are these people?<eos> - They want Danny.<eos> We want him alive.<eos> Oh, shit.
- Where's Matt?<eos> What's he thinking?<eos> - He's not.<eos> Stay with me!<eos> This is not who you are.<eos> I know you.<eos> You died.<eos> I held you in my arms.<eos> I buried you, Elektra!<eos> Elektra.
- He's not.<eos> Stay with me!<eos> This is not who you are.<eos> I know you.<eos> You died.<eos> I held you in my arms.<eos> I buried you, Elektra!<eos> Elektra.<eos> That's your name.<eos> Elektra.
I buried you, Elektra!<eos> Elektra.<eos> That's your name.<eos> Elektra.<eos> What have they done to you?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I can help you, Elektra!<eos> They say you can't be broken.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Luke!
- More comin'.<eos> - Not for long.<eos> Hey! Let's go.<eos> Get over here, guys!<eos> Smells like shit.<eos> It's our only way out.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> And where's the Black Sky?<eos> That's a question for our leader.<eos> Danny!
It's our only way out.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> And where's the Black Sky?<eos> That's a question for our leader.<eos> Danny!<eos> - Man, am I glad to see you.<eos> - Where've you been?<eos> I'll explain everything, but first...<eos> we have company.<eos> Company? Hey!
we have company.<eos> Company? Hey!<eos> Whoa!<eos> I said I'd bring him back.<eos> What happened?<eos> The Hand attacked us.<eos> They took Luke.<eos> How do you know they didn't follow you here?<eos> We're clear.<eos> - What?
- What?<eos> - No place we land will stay safe for long.<eos> - We can't keep running forever.<eos> - I'm not running, period.<eos> My company owns a building not far from here.<eos> We don't need another hideout. We just need for this to be over.<eos> - You're oversimplifying it.<eos> - Oh, am I?<eos> Or am I the only one of us who isn't in this for a cheap thrill?<eos> - Jessica.

Just like he did in Midland Circle.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> Luke?
I'm grateful for you.<eos> You had no choice in returning from death.<eos> I realize that.<eos> But I hope you understand that this is the life you were chosen to lead, as a weapon against our enemies.<eos> If you do not fulfill that role... you're of no use to the Hand.<eos> Or to me.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I have news.<eos> Sowande has been taken.<eos> By whom?
The same way the unbreakable one let that boy die in a jail cell.<eos> Afraid and alone.<eos> The same way the woman couldn't save the architect.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Have I gotten in your head the same way he did long ago?<eos> What about the ones you still love?<eos> What will become of them once you are gone?<eos> - Who else must die because of you?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> The nurse.

Then why are you listening to him?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why are you listening to any of them, Danny?<eos> When I said that we should find others, I did not mean...<eos> This is not their fight, it's ours, and keeping them around is a liability.<eos> You haven't really seen what they can do.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> Quick.<eos> Hello, Colleen.<eos> Sensei.
She's an old friend.<eos> We are far from friends.<eos> I wouldn't say that.<eos> When you're done with that, I'd like to talk.<eos> There's nothing left to talk about.<eos> It feels as if fate has brought us back together, doesn't it?<eos> What do you want with Danny?<eos> They sent me for him, yes.<eos> But I came for you.<eos> Bullshit.
That's all I'm asking.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, well, don't.<eos> I'm not doing this for you.<eos> It's just... self-preservation at this point.<eos> You deserve better, Karen.<eos> So do you.<eos> - Misty.<eos> - Luke.
Then I don't know how I can help you.<eos> You got a chair?<eos> What the hell?<eos> We've got more coming.<eos> Please.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was wondering when I'd see you again.<eos> Me, too.
We've got more coming.<eos> Please.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was wondering when I'd see you again.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Guess it won't be today.<eos> That army you used to fight alongside...<eos> The Chaste.
And what about this city?<eos> The place you can't live without.<eos> The place that made you what you really are.<eos> - Where are you going? - Don't...<eos> You don't get to tell me who I am, all right?<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> I guess what I'm saying is I see a future for Trish Talk that dives into some more investigative reporting.<eos> This tremor stuff, for example, I don't know if you guys know,<eos> - but a lot of our listeners are having a...<eos> - Trish.

Jess?<eos> - I need her for a minute.<eos> - What?<eos> - Come on, we gotta go.<eos> Meeting's over.<eos> - Excuse me for one second.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - No.<eos> You know that case I took? The architect? The C-4?<eos> Me?
You know that case I took? The architect? The C-4?<eos> Me?<eos> It doesn't matter. I can't just leave those people.<eos> They are safer far away from us.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I know it's annoying, but I gotta get you to a safe place fast. Shit.<eos> Stairwell.<eos> Go.<eos> Jesus! When I said I thought you should get back to work, I didn't mean you should go...<eos> Jess! Jess!
Trust me.<eos> I know it's annoying, but I gotta get you to a safe place fast. Shit.<eos> Stairwell.<eos> Go.<eos> Jesus! When I said I thought you should get back to work, I didn't mean you should go...<eos> Jess! Jess!<eos> That hurt so much.<eos> No way.<eos> The scarf looked better.<eos> - Nice ears.
- Yeah.<eos> And some guy attacked us.<eos> I think it's connected to the tremors.<eos> - I mean, it has to be, right?<eos> Yeah, um, maybe.<eos> Do you want one?<eos> - Uh, I'm... I'm okay.<eos> - Smart.<eos> Who's she?<eos> Reporter.
- I mean, it has to be, right?<eos> Yeah, um, maybe.<eos> Do you want one?<eos> - Uh, I'm... I'm okay.<eos> - Smart.<eos> Who's she?<eos> Reporter.<eos> Think she's here to write a story?<eos> Doesn't look like it.<eos> You, too?
I'm glad to see you.<eos> Gotta be honest, I'm glad to have a break from depositions.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What's the story?<eos> Matt didn't tell you?<eos> Matt doesn't tell me anything.<eos> It's happening again.<eos> I know.<eos> I tried to steer him away.<eos> Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.<eos> - What's the story?<eos> Matt didn't tell you?<eos> Matt doesn't tell me anything.<eos> It's happening again.<eos> I know.<eos> I tried to steer him away.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> And it still wasn't enough.<eos> Funny.
It was passed down...<eos> - It's weird.<eos> Look, I don't need to be here.<eos> I can defend myself.<eos> You came in here pretty bloody.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> What can you tell me about these people that you're fighting?<eos> Nothing.
Then she will be destroyed.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> Hey, stop.<eos> You can't undo this.<eos> Admit it.<eos> - Elektra's still in there.<eos> You failed.<eos> - You're the one who failed.<eos> Elektra died on a rooftop in your arms because you couldn't protect her.<eos> Shit.
Sowande is gone.<eos> - He will return.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> For the first time, death is a possibility.<eos> Even if he doesn't, we will survive.<eos> Except the Black Sky... almost killed me.<eos> Then there would be three.<eos> Perhaps this is what we needed.<eos> A reminder that everyone in this room is expendable.<eos> Everyone.
If Alexandra gets a hold of you, the war's lost.<eos> I can't allow that.<eos> Listen, Stick, maybe we should just... uh, let him lay low, or just...<eos> Maybe we should just hide him.<eos> We're running out of time!<eos> They're hunting our friends, our families, and they're not gonna stop there.<eos> You heard what he said.<eos> This ends with New York in ruins.<eos> They want me on the sidelines 'cause I'm the only one who can destroy them.<eos> Jess?

You heard what he said.<eos> This ends with New York in ruins.<eos> They want me on the sidelines 'cause I'm the only one who can destroy them.<eos> Jess?<eos> How do you suggest we hide him?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll go back to doing this without you if I have to.<eos> I've already lost one city.<eos> I'm not losing another.<eos> Me neither.
You're not exactly an open book yourself, Jessica.<eos> - What is that supposed to mean?<eos> - Well, no one's digging into your past.<eos> My past is none of your goddamn business, and it's not actively trying to kill us.<eos> - Clock is ticking.<eos> - So if we need more answers, going back to Midland Circle is the only play.<eos> We barely made it out last time, and they're gonna be waiting for us.<eos> - Yeah, she's right.<eos> - So how do we find whatever he opens?<eos> The architect?
- Yeah, she's right.<eos> - So how do we find whatever he opens?<eos> The architect?<eos> My client's husband.<eos> The one your girlfriend tried to kill.<eos> He designed the place.<eos> What, you think he knows how Danny ties into this?<eos> It's worth a shot.<eos> Well, I guess you two better get going.<eos> What about you?
I hope that's a joke.<eos> Sorry about the mess.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You should see my place.<eos> What, do you work from home?<eos> I used to have a partner.<eos> We had an office.<eos> And?<eos> Now we don't.<eos> You ready?
He was desperate.<eos> He started stockpiling explosives.<eos> And you think his target was Midland Circle?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Actually, I think this is it.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Ninety-nine percent.<eos> Ninety-two percent.<eos> But that's still a lot.<eos> - Lexi, right?
About what happened.<eos> You said so yourself. He got mixed up with the mob or something.<eos> - Wasn't the mob.<eos> - Sorry. Who are you?<eos> - He's a lawyer.<eos> - A what?<eos> Lexi, my name is Matthew Murdock.<eos> We think there's more to your dad's story.<eos> If you could just answer a couple of questions, it'd be a tremendous help.<eos> Okay.
In all the time we've known each other, I've never seen you like this.<eos> Your position is one of great power.<eos> But it is a burden as much as a blessing.<eos> Which is why I've convinced the others to follow your lead.<eos> You and I have always understood each other.<eos> Under a single condition.<eos> We will seek out and capture the Iron Fist ourselves without the Black Sky.<eos> It's not like you to show such a lack of faith.<eos> And it's not like you, Alexandra, to show such...<eos> Weakness?
You were right.<eos> I'll be right here when you're done.<eos> You've got me tied up like a prisoner.<eos> Not "like." You're definitely a prisoner.<eos> It's not a good look.<eos> Where's Matt?<eos> Where's Jessica?<eos> They're digging up info on Midland Circle.<eos> We think that's where it all started.<eos> "We"?
Where's Matt?<eos> Where's Jessica?<eos> They're digging up info on Midland Circle.<eos> We think that's where it all started.<eos> "We"?<eos> As in the rest of you who worked against me?<eos> Look. If you'd listened instead of fighting us, you would've been around for the conversation. And I think you would've agreed.<eos> Midland Circle's suspect.<eos> Especially now that we found the hole.<eos> What hole?
"We"?<eos> As in the rest of you who worked against me?<eos> Look. If you'd listened instead of fighting us, you would've been around for the conversation. And I think you would've agreed.<eos> Midland Circle's suspect.<eos> Especially now that we found the hole.<eos> What hole?<eos> Murdock thinks there's something weird about Midland Circle.<eos> And they got you on guard duty.<eos> Nah, that depends on you.<eos> Big mistake.
Nah, that depends on you.<eos> Big mistake.<eos> Don't you see what's happening?<eos> You've got me tied up like I'm the enemy, and they're out there trying to kill the people we care about.<eos> - Misty's keeping everyone safe.<eos> - For now.<eos> But I care about a lot more people than we can fit in a police station.<eos> And I know you do, too.<eos> This city is at stake.<eos> Me and you...
Neither is fighting three people that happen to be on your side.<eos> The moment I can refocus my chi, I'm getting out of this chair.<eos> I'll be waiting.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Meditating.<eos> I think.<eos> He said something about crane pose and centering his animal.<eos> Then I tuned him out.<eos> Anima.<eos> - What?
I'll be waiting.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Meditating.<eos> I think.<eos> He said something about crane pose and centering his animal.<eos> Then I tuned him out.<eos> Anima.<eos> - What?<eos> - He's centering his anima.<eos> Mmm, sure.
He said something about crane pose and centering his animal.<eos> Then I tuned him out.<eos> Anima.<eos> - What?<eos> - He's centering his anima.<eos> Mmm, sure.<eos> Uh, I'm not into that mystic stuff.<eos> It's not "mystic stuff."<eos> It's just a different way of viewing the world.<eos> - Quite different.
You need to make sure that doesn't happen.<eos> You are the Black Sky.<eos> And when this is over, you and I, the two of us...<eos> Will serve life.<eos> Always.<eos> Your heart rate is slowing down.<eos> Breathing.<eos> That's how good chi is born... and bad chi is expelled from the body.<eos> It's a little more complicated than that.<eos> Not by much.
Not like he used to.<eos> He didn't do anything like he used to.<eos> I missed him.<eos> Long before my mom came to you.<eos> Long before he died.<eos> - Do you play?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - The piano.<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> You?
- Dude, what are you doing?<eos> - Just... Do you mind?<eos> - Oh, it's straight ahead.<eos> - Here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, I wasn't very good, but...<eos> - Come on, we should go.<eos> - Just give me a second here.<eos> - You hear that? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> D-sharp.
The hammer's ruffling something before it hits the string here. Here.<eos> Whoa, what are those?<eos> Looks like the plans to the building your dad was working on.<eos> In the piano?<eos> He didn't want them to get into the wrong hands.<eos> And yours... the right ones?<eos> Lexi, I promise, whatever your dad was doing, we're on your side now.<eos> But we're gonna need a minute here, okay?<eos> He was gonna blow it up for sure.<eos> - Oh, shit.

Ten years.<eos> That was a lot of fun, being blind on the inside.<eos> Then I met these people who taught me how to fight for real.<eos> Taught me how the world works for real.<eos> When I got out, I had purpose.<eos> These people, these the ones you call the Chaste?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Closest I ever had to family.<eos> Aside from Matty.<eos> And Elektra.
Ask for guidance.<eos> Forgiveness.<eos> That kinda thing.<eos> So the architect discovers a structure underneath his building. And whatever it is, it's bad enough that he dies trying to blow it up.<eos> Right, he wanted to destroy it. But he didn't want to blow it up.<eos> I think he wanted to collapse it down.<eos> Are you sure the structure in the hole is man-made?<eos> Could it be some sort of bedrock?<eos> Thirty stories deep, in a perfect dome?<eos> All right.

Eh, little of this, little of that.<eos> Kid was right.<eos> This is war.<eos> And they need him to win it.<eos> We assumed we only had two choices.<eos> Run or fight.<eos> Well...<eos> I found a third option.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> Luke! Luke!
I would imagine it's beautiful.<eos> Stick... you need to listen to me.<eos> I wish there was another way, kid.<eos> But there are things in this world far worse than me.<eos> Stick!<eos> - You can't have him, girl.<eos> - You no longer get to tell me what to do.<eos> Elektra!<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> - Matthew.
I'm still waiting for my apology.<eos> I assume you've spoken to Gao.<eos> I have.<eos> Regardless of what has come before, we were meant to fight this war together.<eos> Of course.<eos> Which is why... I wanted your last meal to be a good one.<eos> You came alone... to face me?<eos> Foolish.<eos> But then you always were... a lone wolf.<eos> An interesting metaphor.
Of course.<eos> Which is why... I wanted your last meal to be a good one.<eos> You came alone... to face me?<eos> Foolish.<eos> But then you always were... a lone wolf.<eos> An interesting metaphor.<eos> But if you knew me at all... you'd know...<eos> I hunt the wolf.<eos> If you knew me at all, you'd know I always win.<eos> In the boardroom...
You're alone.<eos> Wanna tell me why?<eos> He's not ready.<eos> The Chaste needs Matt Murdock.<eos> I've tried... but I couldn't convince him.<eos> Bullshit.
Ah, forget Murdock.<eos> The Hand's moving fast.<eos> Something's coming. We gotta move faster.<eos> Maybe there's another way to win this war you talk about... without so much death?<eos> Like it or not, Ellie, more death is coming.<eos> And you and me gotta get out of its way.<eos> We gotta stop meeting like this.<eos> - I don't remember anything.<eos> - Well, let me refresh your memory.<eos> Two bodies, unidentified.
- Looks like it.<eos> Listen, I need you to realize we are on the same side.<eos> Now, I held up my end of the bargain.<eos> I protected your friends.<eos> It's about damn time you dealt me in.<eos> There's a weird shadow organization.<eos> I've been tracking them.<eos> Not very well.<eos> How many were there?<eos> Just one.
What kind of person knocks out you and Luke Cage?<eos> I'm not sure you'd believe me even if I told you.<eos> Try me.<eos> - Whoa, Matt.<eos> Hold on.<eos> - Foggy? Where are we?<eos> Harlem precinct. Private office.<eos> And if we're painting the whole picture, you look like shit.<eos> - They took your shirt for blood samples.<eos> - Right.
- Right.<eos> Claire gave you a quick look.<eos> Nothing's broken.<eos> But the cops have a lot of questions.<eos> - I wasn't wearing the suit.<eos> - I know.<eos> There is a God after all.<eos> Oh, God, I need to go.<eos> He's in danger.<eos> - Who?
Claire gave you a quick look.<eos> Nothing's broken.<eos> But the cops have a lot of questions.<eos> - I wasn't wearing the suit.<eos> - I know.<eos> There is a God after all.<eos> Oh, God, I need to go.<eos> He's in danger.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Danny Rand.
With them?<eos> I did everything I could to avoid people with abilities.<eos> Quit my job.<eos> Moved my ass uptown.<eos> - And how'd that work out?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> Is sidekick a good look on me?<eos> They are fighting a good fight.<eos> You're doing it, too.<eos> Not like them.

You're doing it, too.<eos> Not like them.<eos> And even Jessica.<eos> There are people who run from the fire, and there are people who run into it.<eos> Dumb people.<eos> Okay, you said I was the foundation, right?<eos> Look in the mirror.<eos> Even before you met Luke, you weren't the type who could just... stand by and watch.<eos> Were you?<eos> Claire?
It is now.<eos> Black Sky or not, there are three of us and one of you.<eos> Is that a challenge?<eos> We will do what is needed to preserve our organization.<eos> This is not our first coup.<eos> It is your first without the substance.<eos> Is that a gamble you're willing to take?<eos> The Hand is a global organization.<eos> For years, Alexandra fostered relationships with everything from crime lords to corporate partners.<eos> Corporate partners?
How do we explain her death to them?<eos> There's no need for explanations.<eos> What?<eos> These relationships grant us invisibility in our operations.<eos> Our back-room accords.<eos> Our political affiliations.<eos> This gives us power.<eos> This isn't power.<eos> Living underground.<eos> In hiding.
In hiding.<eos> You know nothing of power.<eos> You didn't exist until Alexandra gave you life.<eos> Didn't I?<eos> It's not what you did, it's how you did it.<eos> The Hand has survived this long because we, above all else, have been astute.<eos> Well, this may come as a bit of a shock, but I don't care about the Hand.<eos> I care about the substance.<eos> Because from now on, nothing will stand in my way.<eos> Not even death.
They call themselves the Hand.<eos> They're real.<eos> They're murderers.<eos> And they took Danny Rand.<eos> - But what do they want with him?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> They've been after him for a while now.<eos> Who knows what they'll do next.<eos> Look, when criminals feel like they're winning, they get sloppy. This could be good for us.<eos> No, not these criminals.

This could be good for us.<eos> No, not these criminals.<eos> They don't get sloppy. They just get more dangerous.<eos> It has to be us.<eos> We can take care of this.<eos> "We"?
I can't.<eos> Well, that's it.<eos> Okay. Someone call DA Tower.<eos> I'm tired of doing this the hard way.<eos> These people don't tell us what to do.<eos> We are the law here.<eos> Or has New York gone completely insane?<eos> Captain, before you make any calls, I'd like to sidebar with my clients.<eos> Oh, you can do that... after I book them for obstruction.<eos> And you.
Captain, before you make any calls, I'd like to sidebar with my clients.<eos> Oh, you can do that... after I book them for obstruction.<eos> And you.<eos> Just a word. In private.<eos> I would like to explain to them how best to cooperate in building your case.<eos> Well, I hope they like what you have to say.<eos> Otherwise, and I warn you, I'm putting you in a room with two super-powered people.<eos> Last I heard, they still have legal rights.<eos> - You know what, son...<eos> - Captain...
Okay. So long as we're on the same page.<eos> Here's my official legal advice.<eos> You need to get something out of those three.<eos> Luke and Jessica think they're protecting us.<eos> And the lawyer, God knows what his play is.<eos> I don't care. This is the kinda case that makes or breaks a career.<eos> And I'm not talking about mine.<eos> Now, you track down and stop this organization, whoever they are, and brass will be knocking each other over trying to shake your hand.<eos> But you don't break this case, they'll remember that, too.<eos> Shit!
I also had masters.<eos> But I'm free now.<eos> And you can be as well.<eos> I want three units scouring a ten-block radius.<eos> They can't be far.<eos> And, Detective...<eos> I thought Luke was smarter than this. I thought...<eos> If you want a chance to save yourself here, you need to reconsider how well you know these vigilantes. That clear?<eos> Find them.<eos> Shit.
Find them.<eos> Shit.<eos> They got an APB out on us.<eos> They think you guys kidnapped me. Great.<eos> We're still 20 blocks away.<eos> We need to stay off the streets.<eos> Should we take a cab?<eos> - They kept my wallet.<eos> - Yeah, me, too.<eos> Shit.

I'm just trying to help.<eos> Harlem can't afford to lose him.<eos> You know, on his first day out of lockup, you took him on a walk... and told him that he was capable of turning this city around.<eos> Of saving somebody.<eos> That's exactly what he's trying to do right now.<eos> It may not be convenient for you or the NYPD.<eos> It's really not convenient for me.<eos> But we're damn lucky he's the kind of man that doesn't let anything stand in his way.<eos> Wait a minute, where's the chick with the sword?<eos> Oh, shit.

- So how do we get in?<eos> - Back entrance.<eos> Parking garage.<eos> I came looking for Danny a couple days ago.<eos> That's how I got in.<eos> A couple days?<eos> God, that feels like three weeks ago.<eos> Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> There it is again.<eos> All right.
A couple days?<eos> God, that feels like three weeks ago.<eos> Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> There it is again.<eos> All right.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - We're not alone.<eos> MJ deep cut.<eos> - How many?<eos> - Three.
Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> There it is again.<eos> All right.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - We're not alone.<eos> MJ deep cut.<eos> - How many?<eos> - Three.<eos> Armed.<eos> - Just three?
- Unfortunately.<eos> We're here for Danny Rand.<eos> The Iron Fist belongs to us.<eos> Well, we're not leaving here without him.<eos> Then I guess you're not leaving.<eos> We don't have to fight.<eos> Fighting is all the Hand knows.<eos> I'm not the Hand.<eos> We've been used.<eos> Both of us.
Both of us.<eos> We've been raised to fight someone else's war.<eos> But you and I, we're the same.<eos> All we want to decide is our own futures.<eos> You sound like your master, Alexandra.<eos> But neither of you know what I want.<eos> Alexandra's dead.<eos> I killed her.<eos> That's what I wanted.<eos> And you?
They gone, Matt?<eos> Yeah, for now.<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> I'm here to save Danny and make sure no one gets hurt ever again.<eos> - How does that answer my question?<eos> - We have to go.<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> She's right.<eos> Hold it.<eos> - Claire?
So I need you to answer this fast.<eos> How long you want me to stall 'em?<eos> That can't be good. Nope.<eos> Hey. Yeah, it's Karen.<eos> Yeah, our lights, too.<eos> Keep moving.<eos> Cops coming.<eos> - You have no idea.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Shit.
Freeze!<eos> Shit.<eos> - Hold your fire.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Knight, where have you been?<eos> I had a feeling they were here, Captain, so I came down.<eos> - Well, are they?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But by the time I got here, lights went out, they were gone.<eos> Hey, Cap!
- Hold your fire.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> Knight, where have you been?<eos> I had a feeling they were here, Captain, so I came down.<eos> - Well, are they?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But by the time I got here, lights went out, they were gone.<eos> Hey, Cap!<eos> We got movement in the stairwell.<eos> Shit.
There's a structure underground.<eos> He's gotta be there.<eos> - How do we get to it?<eos> - Figuring that out.<eos> Hey, I don't like it here. Not at all.<eos> Too late.<eos> There's an elevator this way.<eos> - Think he's down there?<eos> - Let's find out.<eos> Just one more thing.
The Hand will keep coming after us.<eos> This is our chance to shut 'em down for good.<eos> They will come back. Again and again.<eos> But these could end them forever.<eos> I get that you have a history with these people.<eos> So do you.<eos> So does she.<eos> And so did that kid from Harlem.<eos> Detonating a bomb here won't fix what happened to him.<eos> Okay?
...we all know what the Hand is capable of.<eos> We've all been affected.<eos> But they keep coming back.<eos> And when they do, it's not just crime, it's horror movie... murdery shit.<eos> If we don't do this, it's gonna get worse.<eos> Take down the building or the Hand takes down New York.<eos> This is not how I fix things.<eos> These people have come after our friends.<eos> They're showing no signs of stopping.<eos> Jess!
They're showing no signs of stopping.<eos> Jess!<eos> You know that I've wanted nothing to do with this from the beginning.<eos> The architect's brains are still in my apartment.<eos> I haven't changed my clothes.<eos> Let's just get this shit over with.<eos> We'll all sleep easier once they're gone.<eos> We can all just... get on with our lives.<eos> If we do this... no one but those... Hand monsters gets hurt.<eos> Okay?

- I can fight.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> I'm saying, as your friend, if I'm going to do this, I need your help a lot more than they do.<eos> - Promise me that you won't fail him again.<eos> - I'll make it right.<eos> I owe him that much.<eos> I'll be back, Claire.<eos> I promise.<eos> As far as we can tell, the building itself is on some type of hi-tech lockdown.<eos> Bulletproof glass, the works.
The C-4 is missing.<eos> The stuff from the motel?<eos> - All of it.<eos> - Well, who did it?<eos> Surveillance was down, so they don't know who.<eos> Well, I'll give you three guesses.<eos> - Captain, we don't know what happened...<eos> - Bullshit. You're pissed 'cause you vouched for 'em.<eos> The question now is what are they gonna do with it?<eos> - Oh, shit!

- Get bomb squad now! - Copy that.<eos> Evacuate everything in a two-block radius.<eos> And get ESU here.<eos> - We got a door to breach.<eos> - Yes, sir. I'll let you know when the teams are assembled.<eos> Okay, Knight.<eos> If you still work here by then.<eos> We're getting more support!<eos> Get those people out! Get those people out!<eos> Holy shit.
They took hostages.<eos> Watched someone die.<eos> I'm glad you're okay.<eos> Are any of us okay?<eos> Well, that could be good.<eos> At my radio station, I tried to float... that the earthquake was a cover-up for something else.<eos> Really?<eos> What happened?<eos> - I was shut down.<eos> - By who?

Your boss?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Shit.<eos> If what Jessica says is true... this Hand organization is powerful.<eos> They could've quashed the story.<eos> Yeah, well, it probably means you're right.<eos> But, I know that we can get to the truth. We just have to...<eos> Have to be willing to play close to the fire, right?<eos> Jessica is the fire.<eos> What about that guy?

- Matt.<eos> - Yeah, what's his deal?<eos> Um... he's a good friend.<eos> It's...<eos> He's, um...<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Jessica's a good friend, too.<eos> I mean, not in the traditional sense.<eos> You can't rely on her to... move a couch or plan a party, but... when it comes to the real stuff... the stuff that'll last forever...<eos> Uh, ladies?

Just make sure to clear the block, okay?<eos> - There's a lot of this stuff in here.<eos> - Wait a minute. You know about this?<eos> Claire, whatever it is you're planning, it ends in either jail or a cemetery.<eos> Please.<eos> You guys are in way over your heads. All of you.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> What's that sound?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Claire!

She made you hold her hand as you crossed the street.<eos> You pulled away from her as though you didn't need her.<eos> Tell me... what would you give to hold that hand again?<eos> And here you are, alone.<eos> Trying to fulfill some prophecy.<eos> All to numb your pain.<eos> You can't get into my head anymore.<eos> Now tell me... what are your plans with New York?<eos> Its time has come... to fall.<eos> The elevator.
The elevator.<eos> It's descending.<eos> Wait!<eos> He could be useful.<eos> Perhaps you have found your family.<eos> Ten stories left.<eos> Give or take.<eos> Anyone waiting for us?<eos> Yeah, about 30 of 'em.<eos> All of 'em armed.

So how are we gonna handle it?<eos> I got an idea.<eos> But you're not gonna like it.<eos> Don't shoot.<eos> Look, I don't give a shit what you guys are doing... down here in your secret cave thing.<eos> I just came to talk.<eos> You started this.<eos> Ever since you burst into my office, my life has become one big kung fu party.<eos> I don't wanna fight you.<eos> Alone.
Alone.<eos> Let's go, Ironclad.<eos> It's Iron Fist.<eos> I know.<eos> Do not bother wearing yourself out.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I know your limits.<eos> There's no damage that you can do to me that can't be undone.<eos> Especially because the Iron Fist has already given us the ultimate gift.<eos> Life without end.
I'm not.<eos> I know your limits.<eos> There's no damage that you can do to me that can't be undone.<eos> Especially because the Iron Fist has already given us the ultimate gift.<eos> Life without end.<eos> I'll give you one last chance to experience it with me.<eos> To be who you were meant to be.<eos> I don't need you anymore.<eos> Asshole!<eos> Colleen!
- Just like old times.<eos> Asshole, I will put you down.<eos> You disappoint me.<eos> As a child, all you ever wanted was to belong to something.<eos> That's why I saved you, Colleen.<eos> Raised you.<eos> Because that same desire was once in me.<eos> Is this your family now?<eos> Well... let me remind you who you really are by taking that away.<eos> Colleen!

If I truly mean nothing to you, if there's truly no light inside of you, why not just do it?<eos> Because the game is fun.<eos> No.<eos> It's 'cause you still feel.<eos> For all your talk of embracing the darkness, I don't think you want to be alone in it.<eos> - I've seen death.<eos> - And you're afraid of it.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Because you'll be by my side, where you belong.<eos> Colleen?

Danny!<eos> - What happened?<eos> - She's bleeding out.<eos> Bakuto set off the detonator.<eos> This building is about to explode.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Wait.<eos> We have to go back.<eos> - Why?<eos> - What?
- What?<eos> - Matt knew.<eos> - Well, we can't leave him down there.<eos> - Hold it right there!<eos> There are bombs in this building!<eos> We gotta go!<eos> Hands in the air!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't let this happen.<eos> 10-33. 10-33.
