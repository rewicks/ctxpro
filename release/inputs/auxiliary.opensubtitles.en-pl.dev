- What is that?<eos> - Never mind.<eos> It was argued convincingly that your medical expertise is still required.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> -It wasn't me.<eos> The council vote was nearly unanimous.<eos> Apparently, Jake's message woke their better angels, as well.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> We need to talk about those flares. No.<eos> We don't.
He hates when I'm late.<eos> I'm not sharing the tip.<eos> You running out on me, or was I supposed to come back here for a little quickie?<eos> I swear to God, if you show your face here again, I'll report you, and that won't look too good for the lawsuit.<eos> Hey, I know you don't hate me.<eos> You're blushing just looking at me.<eos> I mean, you're ready.<eos> All I got to do is look at you.<eos> We had something.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Didn't you get the text?<eos> You were supposed to send it.<eos> You look so cute.<eos> Come in!<eos> Stop!<eos> I miss you.<eos> I'm here.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You don't listen to me.<eos> Yes, I do.
And you?<eos> Yes and no.<eos> I'm frustrated we don't have her.<eos> But thrilled by her strength.<eos> She's everything we hoped she would be.<eos> It's easy enough to suppress this footage, coordinate a cover story, get out in front of it.<eos> But we still have a leak.<eos> And that angers me.<eos> I abhor being lied to.<eos> Who doesn't?
No?<eos> You went from protecting the president to riding in blind with a malfunctioning robot?<eos> Robots don't say ""<eos> You're not a murderer.<eos> I saw what I saw.<eos> I'm on that tape.<eos> It is a very sophisticated frame job.<eos> We both know it.<eos> Do we?<eos> Yes, we do.
Leave while I'm ahead?<eos> You got it.<eos> Clear them sinuses, playboy!<eos> Someone's got the sniffles.<eos> Tell your mama you love 'er.<eos> Step up your vitamin "C" game, bro!<eos> So they recall me after all I've done for them.<eos> Ridiculous.<eos> - But Dexhart now has another sex scandal.<eos> - Of course he does.
I got the same feeling.<eos> So what's it gonna be?<eos> You just stirred up the hornet's nest.<eos> You wanted in.<eos> Now you're in.<eos> The defense calls Ingrid Curtwell, the victim's daughter.<eos> I have some difficult questions to ask, Ingrid.<eos> Did your father ever strike you?<eos> Look, I know that this is hard, Ingrid.<eos> I do.
- Well, we all heard about your accident.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> That was no accident.<eos> No, I just cooked up the rest of the cabbage that my maggots didn't want.<eos> Well, you're loyal to your friends.<eos> Glad to see you here.<eos> Are you surprised as well?<eos> Judge Woodhull, is this your son I've heard so much about?<eos> Major Rogers, I don't believe I mentioned my son.<eos> You didn't.
I've just completed my mission... the recruitment of a young, talented agent willing to apply said talents in service to the crown... for the aim of ending this reckless war.<eos> Tell me... have you ever been to New Jersey?<eos> I saw your signal to meet.<eos> What is happening around here?<eos> First, your father and Major Rogers tell me<eos> I'm to report to the church in the morning, and then I go, and Rogers and his Indian are riding out of town.<eos> Well, he won't be back. Not for a while.<eos> And now there's a rumor around that the company drummer killed Captain Joyce.<eos> - How does that make sense?<eos> - It doesn't.
The problem is, Mr. Stephanides didn't have ownership standing to transfer the property because the bank held a lien on the bar.<eos> Meaning?<eos> The bank owns Molly's.<eos> This is a receipt from the diner I was eating at when Brian Hayes was killed.<eos> The waitress is named Tonya.<eos> She'll vouch.<eos> I had to try and protect lisa.<eos> I'd have never made it back from Iraq if I didn't have her to come home to.<eos> I get it, Clarke.<eos> I do.
Visiting hours ended.<eos> I just need five minutes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Five.<eos> - All right.<eos> Hey, Jeremy.<eos> I forgot your name.<eos> Do you remember the bet we made?<eos> I do.
And he's looking over here.<eos> - Ouch! - See?<eos> He's over it already.<eos> I'm just gonna let it go.<eos> Okay, but if you don't confront him right now, you are not allowed to obsess to me later about what went wrong, because you have a window right this minute to find out from the source.<eos> Like, what do you have to lose?<eos> Okay, what's up with you?<eos> - Hey, I didn't see you.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Yeah, you did.
And you know what?<eos> There's really only one way to deal with it.<eos> Kill him?<eos> You should all meet him, officially, for dinner tomorrow night.<eos> Are tops optional?<eos> I had my shirt on!<eos> April, hey.<eos> You got a sec?<eos> Hey, Mallory.<eos> How you doing?
Yeah, well, I realize that, Sara.<eos> Which is why I've been looking out for April, trying to make her feel safe.<eos> It's all I've been able to think about.<eos> So don't talk to me about family loyalty, okay?<eos> Especially since you're the one who's held a grudge against me for years.<eos> You wouldn't even let me come to my own brother's funeral.<eos> You know why I did that.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't want to dwell on the past anymore.<eos> I don't.
I'm not fine with that.<eos> None of us are.<eos> But I don't think that pushing her too hard is the right thing to do either.<eos> Honey, she's scared out of her mind right now.<eos> So am I.<eos> I know.<eos> Mom, what if...<eos> We won't lose her.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - No, I don't.
Like worse than I've ever felt about a guy.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> All I know is I can't deal with you hating me.<eos> Brenna.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> It's just hard when you're into girls and you have no idea if they're into girls.<eos> But you hurt my feelings because...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I felt like we had a thing.<eos> I did too.
- I'm Martine.<eos> - I'm Sara.<eos> Martine's my favorite nurse.<eos> Ah, you say that to all the nurses.<eos> I definitely do not say that to Lailani.<eos> Just checking in before you go to sleep.<eos> Oh, and don't panic if you hear an alarm in the middle of the night.<eos> We have your bed set to alert us if you get up.<eos> Every time I get up?<eos> Yes, and sometimes when you don't.
- and one who's just like... - Hey.<eos> I have two perfect daughters.<eos> - When were you gonna tell me?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I didn't even know if you and I were getting back together.<eos> Why do you think I came back here?<eos> I wanted to be here for you, like as your boyfriend.<eos> Since we were only on a break because of distance, I thought you wanted that too.<eos> I did.<eos> I still do.
Just make sure it's done before my cotillion.<eos> Mother spent a fortune on my dress, if she hasn't already told you.<eos> I'll tell your mother that you refused the hysterectomy.<eos> No, I didn't say that.<eos> Will you do it?<eos> I mean, maybe it will help.<eos> Rose...<eos> If you're trying to protect your mother...<eos> My mother doesn't need protection.<eos> I do.
All my sales reports are there.<eos> I sold over $40 worth of products this week.<eos> It's almost double what I did the week before.<eos> Hmm. Be still my heart.<eos> I did all of that without using your sales script, by the way.<eos> No wonder your numbers stink.<eos> I don't... I don't feel comfortable reading from a script that deliberately makes women feel bad about themselves.<eos> And yet women who feel great about themselves don't buy diet products, which leaves us with a... conundrum.<eos> Listen, if you really want to get good at this...<eos> - Oh, I don't. - Oh.
True or not, I'm simply wondering if it's worth our consideration.<eos> Dr. Masters' office.<eos> Yes, Mrs. Kenworthy.<eos> Oh, that's fine.<eos> We can...<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Kenworthy just canceled her appointment.<eos> When does she want to reschedule?<eos> She doesn't.
After the dust-up yesterday,<eos> I thought it would be best if we kept our patients away from each other, unless you're going for stitches next time, Doctor.<eos> I don't think this is the right solution.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Obstetrics.<eos> Uh, Mrs. Johnson, it seems someone's trying to track you down.<eos> Hello?<eos> Lillian, what happened?<eos> They must have told you on the phone.<eos> They didn't.
Maybe some medical student will discover a cure for ovarian cancer by using mine.<eos> There'd be a nice symmetry to that, don't you think?<eos> By taking this, you're promising me you'll see to it, that my wishes are carried out.<eos> Will you take it?<eos> There you go.<eos> Good night, mrs. masters. Oh.<eos> Um, good night, coral.<eos> My auntie is waiting for me.<eos> No doubt miss hogue told you I would prefer she not go ahead with this story.<eos> She did.
I couldn't hurt her like that.<eos> And I couldn't hurt you.<eos> So whatever secrets you may have, they're safe.<eos> They've been safe for a long time.<eos> I don't judge you.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> What you do, what you don't do, it's not my place to judge my own son.<eos> My place is to love you.<eos> Just that.<eos> And I do.
Well, it didn't. It happened to me.<eos> And I'm sorry that I wasn't emoting enough, but...<eos> Were there tears when it happened?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> A 12-year-old girl-- she cries when she's being penetrated for the first time.<eos> Were you that 12-year-old girl?<eos> Yes, I told you.<eos> Then why not say "I"?<eos> "I cried."<eos> Well, I did.
Uh, when I was very young, yes.<eos> Without difficulty?<eos> Dr. Masters means physical difficulty.<eos> We understand that there was a difficult emotional component.<eos> Uh, when-- when he first put it inside me, it-- it hurt, and there was a little blood.<eos> And after the first time?<eos> Uh, the-- the pain was lessened.<eos> But then once I realized that the circumstances were inappropriate--<eos> Does he know who I was with?<eos> He does.
And I think we should have Dr Masters field this one.<eos> Well, masturbation, for one.<eos> Can't say "masturbation".<eos> Auto-manipulation, then. Mmm-mmm.<eos> I think we want to leave out anything that suggests solo behaviour.<eos> So, Ulysses is a dildo? What did you think?<eos> Our female subjects were having intercourse with a Greek leader in the Trojan War?<eos> CBS doesn't like dildos.<eos> CBS doesn't have to use a dildo.<eos> But Dr Masters and Mrs Johnson's participants did. Do.
Last time I tried to explain the work of my matter I got my hat handed lo me, literally.<eos> And if their methods aren't exactly what ours might be, well, then, we push back when we can, but we allow them enough latitude to do the job we brought them in to do.<eos> So, the end justifies the means.<eos> I know you, Dr Masters, as well as I think anyone can.<eos> That doesn't sound like something you really believe.<eos> It's easy to be idealistic when your life's work isn't at stake.<eos> Isn't that exactly the time to be idealistic?<eos> To hold on to your principles? Be true to yourself?<eos> I don't need a lecture from you, Lester.<eos> Maybe you do.
Maybe we should continue into actual sex.<eos> Let me initiate first. And you just feel -- feel... feel me.<eos> Feel your body.<eos> It's interesting if you look at the progression.<eos> Seven nights of nonsexual touching, multiple erections.<eos> With a few unmitigated disasters.<eos> But still.<eos> And then followed by seven nights of sexual touching.<eos> Again with multiple erections if you don't count --<eos> I don't.
You okay to continue?<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Hey-hey, it's okay, it's okay.<eos> You're safe in here, Kira. This truck is made of titanium.<eos> They can't track you in here.<eos> I'd be dead if it weren't for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Kira, you must know something about Anton.<eos> That's why they tried to kill you.<eos> I don't.
I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> More than anything.<eos> Dr. Sanders told me what happened with you and Kate Renner.<eos> Kate Renner?<eos> How could she know about...<eos> It was decades ago.<eos> Burton Delaney.<eos> - Mary, you couldn't possibly believe...<eos> - Oh, but I do.
Bruno.<eos> Yeah, you two take Ms. Devoe back to CT for that scan.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Griff told me. Are you OK?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why? What did he say?<eos> - He said someone kicked you.<eos> - I'm fine. - Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah. You didn't need to check up on me.<eos> Of course I did.
- What is it with you?<eos> You're being so irresponsible!<eos> And now you're scared<eos> - to take a stupid blood test!<eos> - It's not the test, OK?<eos> I'm not afraid of the stupid test.<eos> It's... it's what happens after.<eos> What if I am sick?<eos> - If you're sick, then you're sick. - Then what?<eos> What do I do then?
It just happened so fast.<eos> - I was scared.<eos> I called Mel.<eos> - I get it.<eos> She's family.<eos> - Brian.<eos> - It's OK.<eos> I just... I would love if you would... I'm looking forward to you thinking of me that way too.<eos> That's all.<eos> I do!
See if her and Griff are still together.<eos> - If he's lying.<eos> - What does it matter?<eos> Why do I care if I believe what he says to me?<eos> - Are you two together?<eos> - No.<eos> So, what's to believe or not?<eos> Why do you care, Zoe?<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
So, technically, Hitler was the Hitler of music.<eos> I don't understand. I thought you closed the name.<eos> Well, I guess it's still a little ajar, I don't know.<eos> Who am I, Herb Cohen?<eos> - I don't know who that is.<eos> - Neither do I. That's a...<eos> That's a Jared thing.<eos> Hey! Make sure to clean off all the gunk off the front bumper, okay.<eos> And since when do we have an intern program?<eos> We don't.
Molly said you wouldn't want to go.<eos> I don't.<eos> Then what's your problem?<eos> I don't know!<eos> You know, you could have asked me to go to the movie with you.<eos> I did, a month ago, and you said you'd rather be eaten by wild dogs.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> But it does sound like something I would say.<eos> If I said it.<eos> Which I didn't.
What are you doing?<eos> You ruined the game for me.<eos> Oh, did I?<eos> Ugh. I'm sorry.<eos> That's real mature.<eos> I'm mature...<eos> Really?<eos> Okay, why did you even come tonight?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Don't tell me.<eos> Okay, tell me.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> We have... Okay, no, no, no.<eos> Keep it...<eos> Keep it like a surprise.<eos> No.<eos> J-Just say it, just say it.<eos> I... okay. Oh.<eos> No, don't, no, don't. (giggles)
J-Just say it, just say it.<eos> I... okay. Oh.<eos> No, don't, no, don't. (giggles)<eos> Like... Okay, go.<eos> Okay. All right!<eos> Don't do it!<eos> (laughs) This is awesome.<eos> Why did you think I would hate this?<eos> Because you don't like guns.<eos> I don't.
- Because you hate me.<eos> There's a fine line, Jonah, between hate and non-hate.<eos> You attacked me with a burrito.<eos> And if I could turn back the hands of time, I would.<eos> - What, so you could do it again?<eos> - No.<eos> The juice could have gotten in my eyes, Dan.<eos> The spicy burrito juice.<eos> I think you and I have a lot in common, actually.<eos> - We do?
- I am un-offering you the job.<eos> You will never be my campaign manager, ever!<eos> - Well, it was a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.<eos> - You bet it was.<eos> It was a huge pleasure to meet me.<eos> You know we're going to rip you apart.<eos> On, so scary!<eos> Do you want to be my campaign manager?<eos> - Yes. - Yeah.<eos> - Yes, I do.
You are off fuckin' everything.<eos> I get it.<eos> I have been a bad little girl, and I just hope that there's some way I can win back your trust.<eos> Someday.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Were we done?<eos> I want to apologize for what I said.<eos> The changes around here just got me all out of sorts.<eos> You don't have to...<eos> I do. I do.
We can't do this on our own.<eos> - We need each other.<eos> - He's right.<eos> - We should do a merger.<eos> - A merger?<eos> It's too late for you guys that.<eos> KickStarter is gone.<eos> We don't have a company.<eos> We don't have anything!<eos> Yes, we do!
How do you feel?<eos> I came here to fight with her and then you told me that she was dead and... I was so angry I didn't wanna let it in, this... this terrible thing that happened.<eos> Caleb, I liked her and I wanted to help her and now she's dead.<eos> And you were...<eos> you were in the car.<eos> You could have...<eos> Come here.<eos> [Remy] What about the current mayor?<eos> [Olivia] He doesn't use this office.<eos> [Luke] Nobody does.
You need to get Hanna away from here.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Don't tell her about Miranda.<eos> Too late.<eos> What's the name of the new lawyer?<eos> I'm gotta call him.<eos> I don't want the police to find Dillon.<eos> What?<eos> I want to find him, and I want to kill him.<eos> No, you don't.

If there are many more of that size, I don't know whether this villa is gonna hold.<eos> Ok were else can we go Mykaela?<eos> Sweetie you have been reading books about volcanoes as long as I can remember.<eos> Can you think of some place else?<eos> So place that's safer?<eos> Crap.<eos> Wait.<eos> Christine, do you still have that map of Pompeii?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes I do.
Hope?<eos> What's hope ever gotten me? Hmm?<eos> My own mother and father dumped me like I was nothing.<eos> Gloria was the only person who ever loved me.<eos> My life ended when I saw her body lying there.<eos> Your life isn't over.<eos> I got nothing.<eos> No one.<eos> Max, you have someone.<eos> You do.
- Terry...<eos> - In two days, I-I have a way that we might be able to escape this mess.<eos> To give you the life you deserve.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Two days.<eos> Just give me two days, and then I'll explain everything.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't leave Arliss.<eos> You don't owe him your life, Lee Anne.<eos> You don't.
Is that correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's correct.<eos> May I speak with you privately?<eos> Sure.<eos> What was that?<eos> What was what?<eos> This case is about sex, and it is my job to ask the tough questions.<eos> You don't get what's wrong with the system here.<eos> I do.
Um... oh, God!<eos> You think I want...<eos> Yeah, sex.<eos> The romantic night out, the movie, the food trucks.<eos> Food trucks means sex?<eos> No, but coming back to your place, it just feels so...<eos> I really like you, Rico, but I'm just not ready.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I mean, I don't want to have sex with you.<eos> You don't?
A big one.<eos> You are?<eos> It's, uh, shocking, I know.<eos> But... but yes.<eos> Now can we just drop all the sex talk?<eos> You want to watch a movie?<eos> Yes. Yes.<eos> Oh, I've seen "Star Wars" like 100 times, but every time is like the first time.<eos> (Stammers) I mean, you know what I mean.<eos> I do.
I think he is telling us.<eos> Tell us more about this job.<eos> Well, as you know, back in my hippie days, a business man came into my coffee shop, told me money was all that mattered, and stole my girlfriend.<eos> That's when I decided to become awesome.<eos> But I had no idea how to break into the corporate world.<eos> So, hoping he wouldn't recognize me, I went to the one person from whom I knew I could learn everything.<eos> Do we know each other, bro?<eos> We're all connected in Gaia's great tapestry of...<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
I did get a perfect score on the A.C.T.'s.<eos> Advanced Card Tricks.<eos> Well, look, buddy. You got a sweet résumé.<eos> But we don't have any openings you're qualified for.<eos> They set me up!<eos> It was a trap!<eos> It's a trap!<eos> We have one opening you'd be perfect for.<eos> Great.<eos> What do I do?
(laughs) Mr. Shue, Mercedes is here!<eos> - Oh, hey, Mercedes. - Hi!<eos> I'd like to speak to a manager, please.<eos> What seems to be the problem here?<eos> WOMAN: Well, one hour ago, I got a call from Detective Sue Sylvester with the LAPD saying that a 50-year-old Ohio man with a perm had abducted 12 emotionally disturbed teenagers, and if he tried to make a reservation,<eos> Oh, my God, that's them.<eos> Who?<eos> Do you seriously have no idea who that is?<eos> Do none of you read the show choir blogs?<eos> No, Blaine, we don't.
Six hundred dollars for your information.<eos> - So who stole it?<eos> - I give up.<eos> Who?<eos> No, not who stole it, like, guess who stole it.<eos> Who stole it like which one of you fuckers stole my money?<eos> Why do you think we stole your money?<eos> - Because you knew where I hid it.<eos> - Where? - In the damn keg!<eos> - Ooh! We do now.
Just get him the fuck out of the house.<eos> - What?<eos> - I warned you. Now go!<eos> Carl, come here. Get rid of any evidence in Frank's room, all right?<eos> He is too sick to leave the house.<eos> Yeah, no shit!<eos> You just let him shoot a bunch of fucking H!<eos> He was in pain!<eos> What if the social worker had showed up right now?<eos> But she didn't.
- Never really had any use for religion. -'Course not.<eos> Girl with your looks gets along just fine out there without giving any thought to her soul.<eos> But I ain't out there any more. No.<eos> Missy, you are not.<eos> I've been listening to you talk.<eos> There's a lot of sense in it.<eos> You think I don't know why you're all of a sudden batting your eyes at me?<eos> You want protection, sanctuary.<eos> Keep these bitches from stomping you and cutting you and worse.<eos> So what if I do?
Well, it turns out some people still give a shit about what kind of person they do business with.<eos> Why didn't you just kill me?<eos> Because we wanted to make sure we had your money, and like the man said, no bodies drop in Mexico.<eos> Now, the rest of you are welcome to go back to our original agreement.<eos> You get this product back in the US.<eos> You go back to working for Hot Rod.<eos> How does that sound right about now?<eos> I think we're good with that.<eos> I'm guessing that don't apply to me.<eos> No, cousin, it does not.
We can't do this without anaesthesia.<eos> Otherwise, the pain will --<eos> Well, at least he won't feel it.<eos> Here. Hold this.<eos> I'm in a hospital?<eos> I wish you were in a hospital.<eos> Got it.<eos> Relax.<eos> I just thought this room might make you feel better, Gabriel.<eos> It doesn't.
Okay, that should be the seed value-- the -- the key code for the blur.<eos> Now you should be able to use the code to try -- It's working.<eos> Weatherly.<eos> All this time, it was right in front of me, and I never saw it.<eos> No one saw it.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I spoke to him this morning after they found Tetazoo.<eos> Did he tell you where he was going?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He did.
And I think you're obsessed.<eos> You're so obsessed you don't even know how to shut it down, even when you're asleep.<eos> So you don't believe me?<eos> Look, I want to.<eos> But where's the evidence that links them?<eos> Real evidence. Hard evidence.<eos> I learned that from you.<eos> Do you think I'm crazy?<eos> Yeah, a little.<eos> I do.
"She shouldn't do the things she does,<eos> "She deserves better than dirty glasses and soggy bills,<eos> She deserves better." Hmm.<eos> Look at this. A check torn up for $1,000.<eos> I couldn't see him throwing out ten bucks.<eos> "BoarHog Record and Publishing."<eos> Got an address and everything.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> When did he give you the authorization to look at them?<eos> He didn't.
Okay, let's see, mm.<eos> Not this one, no.<eos> Um, did you know I have two different color eyes?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Why do you wear the contact?<eos> My ex-boyfriend always made fun of it.<eos> - What an asshole.<eos> - I'm joking. I'm lying.<eos> No one ever did that.
Crack the surveillance?<eos> Leave the whip.<eos> You know the rules and why they exist.<eos> Everything in Vega has a purpose.<eos> That's how the city survives.<eos> Founding law.<eos> "For the protection and good of all, gates are inviolable."<eos> We have a right to leave.<eos> We all do.<eos> No, you don't.
Daniel?<eos> Margaux called.<eos> There's a crisis at work.<eos> We can't avoid each other forever.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> All right, come in.<eos> What do you want to chat about?<eos> The weather?<eos> How I slept last night?<eos> 'Cause I didn't.
She died when I was 4.<eos> And after that, Dad married Anne.<eos> Anne didn't give a damn about me, so...<eos> Neither did he.<eos> To feel that kind of rejection from your -- your father makes you feel like, um...<eos> It made me feel like there was something wrong with me...<eos> No...<eos> Something, uh...<eos> Something bad, unlovable.<eos> I still do.
Sure hope he's got an ace up his sleeve.<eos> Sir, the boatswain's mates have loaded pilot chutes into launchers.<eos> Strong enough breeze, and we'll shoot them high enough to engage the larger chutes.<eos> That should give us just enough speed to turn the prop and get electricity.<eos> - Won't help us make water, but... - So where's the wind?<eos> Gator said the wind was coming.<eos> It's gotta come, right?<eos> I'm guessing the Navy told you about my car accident. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They did.
You miss me?<eos> No.<eos> Ok.<eos> Why don't you, uh... prove it?<eos> Hi. Hi.<eos> I'm going to kiss you.<eos> Ok.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We have a lot to talk about.<eos> Yes, we do.
The two boys probably hatched the plan when they met on the hiking trip.<eos> Teddy knew where his mother kept the jewels and when his father would be gone.<eos> Except Clark shows up high on meth, tries to rape the mother, Teddy fights back and Clark kills the both of them.<eos> And that explains the lack of subdermal hematomas on Teddy's wrists.<eos> He was killed first and then tied up.<eos> Jeffrey Hines, the jogger who got shot,<eos> Garcia found a connection.<eos> It's not who he was, it's where he was.<eos> Your son doesn't look like much of a killer there.<eos> Neither did my son, though.
Hotch handles most of the paperwork now, but before JJ was a profiler, she reviewed cases in here.<eos> Well, she wouldn't hide anything too far out of reach.<eos> All right, 4 digits.<eos> Any ideas.<eos> Henry's birthday is November 12.<eos> 1112 that's too easy.<eos> Try 2008, the year she became a mom.<eos> What's integrity?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But someone does.
- Let's walk.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I can't. I have to go.<eos> And I'm cold too.<eos> You're cold? Hold on a second.<eos> I drank so much I can't feel the cold.<eos> Give me your jacket.<eos> You're not very talkative.<eos> Think I'm an asshole?<eos> - Do you?
- Beat you up?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And kept the chair?<eos> - Sure did.<eos> But I got my phone back.<eos> Where are these boys?<eos> Is this true?<eos> !<eos> A son of mine stole a wheelchair from a guy with MD? !<eos> Ernesto did it.
Y... Uh... You...<eos> You heard me.<eos> Y... Um, you want me to lick your... What?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, I would rather get a job on my merits.<eos> Well, everyone in Hollywood thinks they have merits.<eos> Look, I just told you acting is easy.<eos> That's why everybody wants to do it.<eos> I mean, there was literally like 17, 18 guys could've played Chandler on "Friends," right?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - But Matthew Perry, he did something that none of the others did.
Aidan, come on!<eos> Like, we have to do this.<eos> You saw that little girl.<eos> Yes, I saw that girl, and so did you.<eos> But Beatrice can't, so how's that gonna look, huh?<eos> "Hi, nice to meet you.<eos> "Just met your dead sister<eos> "who was, you know, a ghost and still a child."<eos> Look, I don't wanna do this any more than you do.<eos> - Yes, you do.
You saw that little girl.<eos> Yes, I saw that girl, and so did you.<eos> But Beatrice can't, so how's that gonna look, huh?<eos> "Hi, nice to meet you.<eos> "Just met your dead sister<eos> "who was, you know, a ghost and still a child."<eos> Look, I don't wanna do this any more than you do.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do.
Maybe it's the same thing.<eos> The whole thing makes my head hurt bad, and I haven't even packed up the kitchen yet.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm freaking out.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Are you here to turn with me tonight?<eos> No!<eos> No, I came to talk to Astrid.<eos> Didn't Aidan talk to you?<eos> Yeah, he did.
Where's Astrid?<eos> She's dead.<eos> She told Mark and the rest of them that she was leaving with you.<eos> Mark didn't like that.<eos> She fought them, and then they, uh, came for Josh.<eos> I'm so sorry, Kenny.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I don't even know how to feel.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes you do.
I brought it here!<eos> I'm so, so sorry!<eos> - You know exactly what to do.<eos> - No, I can't fight him!<eos> He always wins!<eos> That's the problem!<eos> You can't fight him.<eos> Confrontation is standing up, looking something in the eye and being honest.<eos> - I don't know how to do that.<eos> - Yes you do.
Why?<eos> She's Julia's mother.<eos> Your mother'?<eos> Just let me make sure she's all right.<eos> Go.<eos> I always knew you were capable of murder, but mass murder?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Don't know about an outbreak in Puerto Rico?<eos> Narvik-A. You don't know about that?<eos> Of course he does.
As your people have done for centuries, with your witch trials and inquisitions.<eos> You know that's not the truth, Spencer.<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> Those are lies propagated by your mother and father.<eos> Let my daughter go.<eos> You can take me back with you.<eos> No, no.<eos> Jane!<eos> Stop!<eos> Please, don't!
Previously on Reckless...<eos> Ms. Marcus is suing the city of Charleston<eos> - for wrongful termination... - Okay, Jamie.<eos> - And defamation of character.<eos> - Game on.<eos> They have a tape.<eos> It's footage of you and three other men having sex on a police car.<eos> They must've slipped something into my beer.<eos> We had something.<eos> Yeah, we did.
- Rose.<eos> - Look at this.<eos> There's a hidden wall. It's a passageway. It's a secret passageway into our bedroom.<eos> Yes.<eos> I finally know what they're doing.<eos> It is an old building with old rooms.<eos> There's nothing secret about that.<eos> Don't use that tone with me.<eos> I know what they want, Guy.<eos> I finally do.
- He didn't mean it!<eos> I know!<eos> I'm trying to defuse the tension.<eos> - Here we go, guys. - Oh, yeah!<eos> - Three more mojitos. - Yum!<eos> Aren't these yum?<eos> I didn't even drink the first one.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause I don't think it drank itself.<eos> No, it did not.
- No, nothing.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> - There's nothing to tell! - Tell me.<eos> - There's nothing to tell! - Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me.<eos> Here. Answer me.<eos> How does Santa Claus get to all of those houses?<eos> Okay, sweetie, the adults are talking right now, and look what daddy brought you.<eos> Mitchell, when somebody tells me something, I can't wait to get home and tell you.<eos> Don't you feel the same?<eos> Of course I do.
And since it has blood on it, it also indicates that someone was shot at the scene where you and your father both say no one was present for his arrest.<eos> Care to amend your statement, Detective Chandler?<eos> Let's try this again, Detective, for the record, tell me exactly what happened after the car crash.<eos> I already told you what happened, Agent Hendricks.<eos> Why are you making this so difficult for yourself?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't expect you to.<eos> So you admit there's more to the story.<eos> Don't put words in her mouth.<eos> I didn't!
Gotta keep that refrigerated.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> Are you trying to lose your job?<eos> This from my fellow body snatcher?<eos> No, I was trying to save Vincent, apparently because Cat shot him.<eos> He didn't give her much of a choice.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do, and so do you.
Like what was Ted doing there in the first place?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's weird. - It's more than weird.<eos> Something bigger's going on here, don't you think?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Come check this out.<eos> This is surveillance from that security camera at the entrance of the roller coaster repair yard.<eos> Ted enters alone at 8:47 P.M.<eos> Did anyone enter prior to that?<eos> No. But about 15 minutes later at 9:04 P.M., someone does.
Drop it on the ground.<eos> Do you know how bad that is for it?<eos> I will place it on the ground, but...<eos> You think K-Log won't shoot, punk?<eos> No, I think K-Log is out of bullets.<eos> How did you...<eos> It's just a thing<eos> I do. Now what the hell is in that briefcase?<eos> As if you don't know.<eos> I honestly don't.
Let's go! Not without a bunch of garlic and some wooden stakes.<eos> What?<eos> They're clones, not vampires!<eos> It doesn't matter to the stake!<eos> What're you...<eos> We can't kill them!<eos> Well, not now! We wait till morning and then murder them in their coffins.<eos> Cyril?<eos> Thoughts? I just really wish I hadn't come on this stupid trip.<eos> But since I did...
We have to!<eos> Ray, I'm sorry.<eos> - No, you're not! - I am, actually, which, whatever, but...<eos> We are not leaving Ray!<eos> What do you even think you're doing?<eos> I am taking command!<eos> - Oh, my God. Okay.<eos> Oh, that's really funny. Thanks, Cyril.<eos> I-I think we needed that.<eos> We did. We really did.
Lily wanted to borrow Robin's photographer.<eos> That shouldn't be a problem.<eos> Shouldn't be a problem, Robin?<eos> Of course it should be a problem.<eos> This is your wedding.<eos> You can't let somebody borrow your photographer.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> She's not serious, Robin.<eos> I didn't even bring the suit that I wore to our wedding.<eos> Yes, you did.
Oh, God, is it a suicide note?<eos> Oh, my God, how many pills did you take?<eos> Quick.<eos> How do we make him vomit?<eos> Uh, remind him he's getting married. Hey-yo!<eos> Wait. Now I'm confused.<eos> Are you dying?<eos> I'm writing my vows to Robin, but I want them to be profound and inspiring, as if they were written by the bard himself, Lionel Richie.<eos> Then why did you wait until right before the wedding to compose them?<eos> I didn't.
For the mind is all the more dangerous when damaged.<eos> And there's no guarantee that it won't choose itself as its next victim.<eos> Physically, you've recovered beyond expectation.<eos> With regard to your head trauma, there are no permanent neurological problems evident.<eos> However, there is a bit of swelling between the frontal and the left temporal lobes.<eos> Would that explain the pounding in my ears, the blackouts?<eos> I'm not a neurologist, Emily.<eos> But the lab forwarded the results to one.<eos> He'll have a better analysis for you tomorrow.<eos> And until then, what do I do? I...
Ah! welcome! Come in.<eos> - Hello.<eos> This is Nick. Ex-ex boyfriend. - And Josefine.<eos> - Nice house. my over seas friend from Europe.<eos> Deacon and his friends need victims.<eos> welcome.<eos> There can't be people that I actually envious them or like because of course they will become victims.<eos> Hi! Josefine? I sat next to you in English.<eos> you used to call me the Jacksersist?<eos> no you did.
'Cause I got broken up with.<eos> [Sighs] I know... That if you let this kid go and you don't say good-bye, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.<eos> You realize that I didn't ask him to leave, right?<eos> You realize he broke off our engagement.<eos> He asked me to marry him, and then he took it back.<eos> He left me.<eos> But he deserves a good-bye.<eos> What about what I deserve?<eos> What about what your granddaughter deserves after I did exactly what you told me to do, which was to be patient and kind and loving and open and try to stand by him through everything?<eos> And I did that.

Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's just nice to have some real male energy around here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mm-hmm. - You know, Rath--he's cool.<eos> He's great and all, but, you know, he's just so closed off.<eos> Yeah, I do find him emotionally unavailable.<eos> - Oh, totally.<eos> - Mm, yeah.<eos> And you don't know what it's like to sit next to Hugh.<eos> - Oh, I do.

- Do you trust me? - Shit, Harry!<eos> Language, honey, please.<eos> But everything changes.<eos> Even flying lost its novelty.<eos> I was falling back to earth, and on earth, things were changing, too.<eos> But audiences had grown numb to the thrill.<eos> I hadn't played to a sold-out house in quite some time.<eos> But I wasn't finished escaping. Not quite.<eos> You didn't grease the collar!<eos> Sure I did. Like hell!
Yeah, are you kidding me?<eos> I wouldn't miss it for the world.<eos> So where are those supposed to go?<eos> We got a surprise for you.<eos> Come on.<eos> What is it?<eos> You'll see.<eos> All right, everybody, gather 'round.<eos> Hey, guys, come on down here.<eos> How y'all doing?
Very good, Jones.<eos> [Sighs] Are we really gonna do this?<eos> Her father is Deputy District Chief.<eos> He could make me work in P.R. if he wanted to.<eos> It's gonna be like killing Bambi.<eos> You have his office number.<eos> You are welcome to give him a call if you like.<eos> [Indistinct TV sports announcer] So what now?<eos> Go home.<eos> Just do me a favor.
Cruz, you drive Truck.<eos> It's an important job.<eos> - I can do both.<eos> - Not necessary.<eos> Jones graduated at the top of her academy class.<eos> I'm sure she can figure out a little basic home ec.<eos> Am I gonna be judged for my efforts on the job or behind the stove?<eos> It's all part of the job, Jones.<eos> Jones, when you're finished up in here, the showers need cleaning.<eos> No, they don't.

Why?<eos> Because if she were a man, they probably wouldn't be throwing around words like "cocky" and "entitled" half a day into his first shift.<eos> [Chuckles] And in this little hypothetical, does the man also cheat his way through the academy?<eos> I figured you'd be on my side here.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I'm a woman?<eos> Matt, the guys are right.<eos> She is entitled and cocky.<eos> I thought you didn't harbor any resentment toward her.<eos> I don't.
Thank you, Commodore.<eos> They're very beautiful.<eos> Many would think them horrific.<eos> Not those with eyes to see.<eos> Are you aware that in the months of our acquaintance, I've yet to hear you express firm belief or disbelief in anything?<eos> Well, it seems to me the problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so full of passionate certainty.<eos> I'm in no hurry to count myself among them.<eos> What about ghosts?<eos> Do I believe in them?<eos> Do you? No.
Her men are her business, but just don't introduce him.<eos> Silvia's irredeemable, she took this twerp!<eos> You don't like him at all?<eos> You do?<eos> - Not a bit!<eos> - He's homophobic.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> - And a racist.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do.
I heard you say orchids are your favorite.<eos> Well, it looks kind of lonely there.<eos> "If we could see the miracle of a single flower clearly... our whole life would change."<eos> The Buddha.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Louis has a potential case for us.<eos> Potential?<eos> Well, because the cross-border elements are not yet certain.<eos> Six German cases, one in Belgium, but I need a list of all the similarities to see if there is a pattern that I can present to the Court.<eos> We don't a lot of time.
- Of course it is.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> She's trying to help me.<eos> She's trying to seduce you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Norman.<eos> Norman.<eos> Because.<eos> Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> - She does not.
No, no, no.<eos> She's trying to help me.<eos> She's trying to seduce you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Norman.<eos> Norman.<eos> Because.<eos> Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> - She does not.<eos> - Of course she does.
No, I don't... I don't want this.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Anesthetic.<eos> Cubans, huh?<eos> Cohiba Maduro 5's.<eos> Like smoking coffee and cream.<eos> 50 bucks a piece though, eh?<eos> You know a customer of mine, he gave me one of those once.<eos> You know who else likes cigars?<eos> Do you?
Your whole department.<eos> That's not the issue.<eos> The issue is his name is on my desk because his old man is a drinking buddy of yours.<eos> And so what the hell is so bad about that?<eos> I don't work that way!<eos> Well, maybe you ought to.<eos> Pop, I'm not going back to the last century where the top spots went to the guys with hooks.<eos> Nobody's asking you to.<eos> And by the way, it worked just fine.<eos> No, Pop... it didn't.
It won't happen again.<eos> Then let's put this behind us.<eos> Fine by me.<eos> How are you doing with the media?<eos> But I stand by my decision to recommend Officer Doherty.<eos> I thought we just agreed to put this behind us?<eos> Frank, I consider it an important part of my job to be straight with you, for good and for bad.<eos> And the truth is, I put those promotion papers on your desk again today.<eos> Are we gonna have a problem here, Garrett?<eos> We already do.
And you think I'm here because I got a leg up.<eos> Permission to open my mouth to remove my foot, sir?<eos> Permission granted.<eos> What I mean is I know enough about you to know that you got here under your own steam.<eos> And my father says that you had some reluctance when asked to step up.<eos> Maybe because you were moving into your father's job?<eos> Right on both counts.<eos> My point is, knowing the department, I'm sure there was some behind-the-back talk you had to deal with about how you had a hook.<eos> And... that's what I meant about if anybody'd understand, you would.<eos> And I do.
What about it?<eos> What if it wasn't like that?<eos> What if we told her?<eos> Told her what?<eos> About us?<eos> Jack.<eos> Uh, the other day was lovely.<eos> But I think we should just leave it at that.<eos> And what if I wanted more than that?<eos> You don't.
What if we told her?<eos> Told her what?<eos> About us?<eos> Jack.<eos> Uh, the other day was lovely.<eos> But I think we should just leave it at that.<eos> And what if I wanted more than that?<eos> You don't.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
This was delicious.<eos> Yeah, I remember how much you loved this restaurant.<eos> I do.<eos> But we used to only come here when it was a special occasions.<eos> Well, I was hoping that... tonight could maybe be one of those.<eos> Right.<eos> The Nicky question.<eos> You really think we should be telling her about... whatever it is we've been doing?<eos> Only if we want to keep doing it.<eos> And you do?
We've been talking about maybe trying for another baby.<eos> That's great.<eos> Well, if you need any help, uh, painting the nursery again, you let me know.<eos> Got a minute?<eos> My time's all yours to take up.<eos> Oh, cut it out.<eos> What's that?<eos> A bottle of Finnerty's 18.<eos> I thought you had a rule about booze in the offices.<eos> I do.
Enough with the mousse, for real.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, Ron, you were right.<eos> Tom has really grown up.<eos> You seem merely overjoyed instead of irritatingly ecstatic.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Well, Tom's come into his own.<eos> April runs Animal Control.<eos> I mean, does this department even need me anymore?<eos> No. We do not.
That's a modification of S.B.R. cancer grading, right?<eos> So Nottingham 7 is a high score.<eos> Considering the Nottingham scale only goes to 9, I'd say so.<eos> Why wasn't this picked up in earlier mammograms?<eos> Um, she hadn't had one in a few years.<eos> (scoffs) Wow, this woman is in serious denial.<eos> Why is that?<eos> A 2.5 centimeter tumor in the lower pole?<eos> If she takes a bath or puts on a bra, she would have felt it.<eos> Perhaps she did.
16? 75?<eos> Do you have to make everything a test?<eos> Okay.<eos> See the relationship between the stroma and the lobules.<eos> They're almost equal, which means she's not producing milk.<eos> So she's menopausal.<eos> Clever girl.<eos> So what's your recommendation?<eos> A t2 triple negative tumor with a Nottingham 7 grade... has to come out fast, as I'm sure you've told her.<eos> I didn't, but you just did.
That's her dog's name.<eos> How about when you're done here, you swing by the hospital.<eos> Let me, uh... give you the once-over?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Danny... take a picture of us. (camera shutter clicking)<eos> Okay, here's what's gonna happen.<eos> But you don't know what's gonna happen.<eos> No one does.
That's only 'cause I got burned on the last miracle implant.<eos> (drawer clatters) How about a drink?<eos> Um... (sighs) I really have to take this to pathology.<eos> Actually, that's going with me.<eos> What do you mean, it's going with you?<eos> You know the terms of our clinical trial...<eos> Any implant removed from participants becomes the sole property of Sabian Medical Devices.<eos> What, is that the only reason that you wanted to conduct the autopsy... just to get your prosthesis? (sighs)<eos> If there is a design flaw here, I want to know about it, and I want to get it fixed.<eos> - Yeah, we all do. - (chuckles) Okay.
He's not you.<eos> I miss you. I am not okay without you.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Then why are we doing this?<eos> Because I don't want to drag you through any more of my crap.<eos> Well, I am not giving up on us.<eos> We're meant to be together. I know it.<eos> And...<eos> I think you know it, too.<eos> I do.
This is regarding the documents against your brother that were sent anonymously.<eos> The case is driving me nuts.<eos> I's like to meet you and figure out something.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - How are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I've been better.<eos> The others are done with their investigation.<eos> But I need to know why.<eos> - You just did your job.
- We don't need the attention.<eos> You're not the only one who struggled with the attention.<eos> Think of Andreas.<eos> Yes.<eos> And we need to talk about him.<eos> - Do you see anything?<eos> - The seabed.<eos> - Dive then.<eos> - Do I look like a diver?<eos> In fact, you do.
Dr. Hugh Jass.<eos> You know, Alex would have died today if Charlie hadn't busted in.<eos> Dawn made a huge mistake, and he saved her life.<eos> You don't think Dawn would have caught it anyway?<eos> No.<eos> He was... so passionate.<eos> It seemed crazy.<eos> You should have seen him beating the crap out of Goran.<eos> That seemed nuts.<eos> Did it?
Turns out you're a violent offender.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Back on the case.<eos> Reward for not giving up.<eos> Now... I want to know what really happened.<eos> I already gave my statement.<eos> I read it.<eos> It's a good story.<eos> Guy with a story like that could walk out of here with no jail time, but somehow, something doesn't seem right.<eos> Oh, it never does with you.
Okay.<eos> He was with you.<eos> But you know what?<eos> He has done a lot of bad things in his life, and if this isn't one of them, well, at least he's where he belongs.<eos> Drew!<eos> I have a confession from a guy and a pattern of facts to support it!<eos> If he concocted it, then he's probably hiding something worse.<eos> - That's just not true.<eos> - You don't know that!<eos> - I do!
Sorry.<eos> Look, whatever's gone on, we'll sort it.<eos> OK?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your dad... ..he brought some disks home from work.<eos> And they're important.<eos> Do you know if he made any copies?<eos> No, I dunno.<eos> Just... take your time.<eos> No, he didn't.
Mac knew Chambers.<eos> I never met him.<eos> He was blackmailing her.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> Why are you protecting Chambers?<eos> I wasn't protecting Chambers.<eos> I was helping Mac.<eos> And that is all I ever wanted to do, was just to help Mac.<eos> Chambers didn't kill Hassan.<eos> Mac did.
He gave me this disc.<eos> Ok, he wants me to air this nation wide, live within an hour, or he will kill everyone in there.<eos> He also wants me to get a crew together and go in and give him a live interview.<eos> Okay, do what you have to do.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Go.<eos> Fuck!<eos> - What the fuck happened?<eos> - Don't ask.<eos> What do I do?
Okay, like, "Last night, I spent the evening trying to drown myself in the bathtub in hopes he would take me."<eos> This guy's a nut.<eos> Okay, sorry.<eos> - It's just, why would...<eos> - Just please keep looking.<eos> Okay, so a number of women go missing over the years and then all of a sudden, one of them shows up...<eos> Saying that she's killed him, escaped, but the police can't find a body.<eos> Well, the woman sounds crazy.<eos> Why would they believe her?<eos> They didn't.
I don't really get it.<eos> To me, he just looks like an idiot playing records.<eos> But I'm sure I did dumber things when I was his age.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, like... none of your business.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's okay.<eos> And listen, if you ever get a car from this century, you know where to find me.<eos> - I do. - Okay.
I take your point.<eos> Besides, you want to know where Hot Rod Dunham's at, Miller's your guy.<eos> All right.<eos> Not too shabby.<eos> There a problem, henkins?<eos> Alex Miller, meet deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, down from Lexington.<eos> Is that a ruger?<eos> It's a gp 100.<eos> Oh. I didn't know D.E.A. Still used revolvers.<eos> Well, they don't, officially.
My pagoda project!<eos> I didn't finish!<eos> Pagoda!<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> This won't take but a sec.<eos> Here, Dotty.<eos> Hold that till it dries.<eos> Rough morning.<eos> Won't happen again.<eos> But it did.
Face it-- you don't have a leg to stand on.<eos> Oh, I got legs-- two of them, just like Axl-- that might have been perfect for ice skating, only we'll never know 'cause you took Sue to ice capades.<eos> Hey, I still do stuff with Axl.<eos> When is the last time you did anything like that with Sue?<eos> Hey, I spend time with Sue.<eos> I watched her play volleyball, Frankie.<eos> Got her checked out at the emergency room.<eos> I'm just saying, you don't know where she works.<eos> You have no idea what J-P-la is.<eos> Nobody does.
Right. Uh-- pbht!<eos> -- Venus is the hottest, due to the greenhouse effect.<eos> Great. Uh, now, what planet's gravitational pull is so strong, it easily attracts asteroids and comets into its atmosphere?<eos> That'd be Jupiter.<eos> But your gravitational pull is much stronger.<eos> Axl, please.<eos> You're not making this easy.<eos> There's plenty of time for that later.<eos> We really got to study.<eos> Well, actually, I don't.
Maybe they'll show us...<eos> Where's the knife? - What?<eos> - Did you take it?<eos> - What? - The knife.<eos> Yeah, you, uh...<eos> You wanted me to take it.<eos> You wanted me to put it in my bag and take it to the university for some laboratory tests.<eos> - I didn't ask you to do that.<eos> - Yeah, you did.<eos> No, I didn't.
Don't worry.<eos> As soon as I let them know what's up, they're gonna get you and Kate out of there, okay?<eos> What? This is our last chance, dad.<eos> Isn't that why you picked me to drive?<eos> No, that's not.<eos> And where did you get that gun?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I was trying to save us.<eos> Well, you almost got us killed.<eos> At least I did something.
We're gonna have to kick her loose.<eos> Waitress confirmed that Jordan was at the café in Queens till 11:00.<eos> So she couldn't have killed Madison.<eos> Not with her bare hands, but who knows how far her secret telekinetic powers might reach?<eos> Well, it turns out our victim might've had some secrets of her own.<eos> Did you track down whoever Madison was seeing?<eos> As far as I can tell, she wasn't seeing anybody.<eos> But these are her financials.<eos> - What kind of high-school kid has financials?<eos> - Madison does.
I mean, the hallways are the same.<eos> The principal is the same.<eos> Same banners for school dances.<eos> A... and why didn't you go to your prom?<eos> I'm sure a 17-year-old Katherine Beckett had many a young suitor.<eos> Yeah, except rebel Becks was a little too cool to go to a silly dance, so...<eos> We went to a poetry slam in the East Village instead.<eos> It was one of those seminal moments that I kind of wish I didn't skip out on.<eos> To the things we missed.<eos> And to those we didn't.

He brought up the lake house.<eos> I mean, i played dumb, but i-i don't like it.<eos> He ain't letting' it go.<eos> He must have talked to jen.<eos> You asked her about the lake house that night.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> She doesn't know anything, And reddick doesn't have anything.<eos> He's just digging.<eos> Why didn't you tell me about this?<eos> I just did.
- Shut up, Ellen. Hey.<eos> What is going on?<eos> You're not my social worker anymore.<eos> Stay out of my life.<eos> Get your backpack, please, Jack.<eos> You don't have the slightest idea what I'm dealing with.<eos> Every time I've ever opened the door, the only thing I've gotten back from you is that disappointed, shitty look of yours.<eos> You don't know me. You have never known me.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> No one does.
It'll be more private.<eos> Here. Have a seat.<eos> - Were there other affairs? - What do you think?<eos> Let's just say that he's been gone most nights for a very long time now.<eos> What am I doing here, Carl?

Uh...<eos> When you last saw him, Jen, he was driving his own car, right?<eos> - Dark gray sedan? - Yes.<eos> Does James have an eye for younger women?<eos> Heh, what men don't?

Thank you, Sergeant Major.<eos> Remember your training.<eos> The white-hot incinerator looms in the distance.<eos> Buzz looks to Jesse... and Rex... and Mr. Potato Head.<eos> They join hands and descend into the fiery inferno.<eos> Will they survive?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Looks good from here, Private Hill.<eos> Yes, dude, you passed.<eos> Damn right I did.

It can wait.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - What?<eos> - Thanks!<eos> For what?<eos> For everything.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> I kissed you.<eos> Yeah, you kind of did.
All this?<eos> If I wanted to go to a rave, I'd get in a time machine and go back to the '90s.<eos> Did you see Scott?<eos> Yep.<eos> You tell him what happened?<eos> No. We still have a couple hours, remember?<eos> We promised my dad.<eos> You promised your dad.<eos> I promised him in order to protect him.<eos> You did.
From the way that his arm is rotated, the tendon looks torn.<eos> He could be on his way to a collapsed lung.<eos> Mom, those things, they're not going to leave until the sun's up.<eos> At the rate he's bleeding, he's not gonna make it that long.<eos> We got to get him to the hospital.<eos> Should we call Stiles's dad?<eos> I don't know. Is that going to just get more people hurt?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't think guns work on them.<eos> Then what does?
My Dad's in jail for murder.<eos> We need to do this.<eos> You're lying, you're a liar!<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> You're lying!<eos> Get this nut-job off of me.<eos> No! She said that they drill holes in your head.<eos> She said they're gonna put a hole in my head!<eos> Please, come on!<eos> Please, don't...
Please don't drill a hole in my head.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They told me my lawyer was here.<eos> So either I'm going to congratulate you on recently passing the bar or I should be worried about something.<eos> Hello, Christoph.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I thought this guy had a key to everything.<eos> I do.
Why that kanji?<eos> Why "self"?<eos> To signify that he died as himself.<eos> Because Rhys wasn't a monster.<eos> Not like you.<eos> If I'm such a monster, why'd you call off the oni?<eos> What happened to the woman who called out for chaos, strife and pain to descend upon everyone and everything?<eos> What happened?<eos> I don't want that anymore.<eos> I do.
What?<eos> Like magic tea? No, chamomile tea.<eos> He's not safe here.<eos> He's not safe anywhere.<eos> But Allison killed one of them.<eos> Doesn't that mean something?<eos> She killed an Oni.<eos> Is that even possible?<eos> - I'm not sure how.<eos> - But she did it.
Previously on Teen Wolf.<eos> One of them is standing right behind me.<eos> That's Meredith.<eos> She's a little weird.<eos> Where did the Nogitsune come from?<eos> It was an internment camp during World War II.<eos> What happened to the woman who called out for chaos, strife and pain?<eos> - I don't want that anymore.<eos> - I do.
Otis, you know, we'd sit on her deck and talk.<eos> Talk? What did you talk about?<eos> She... she mention anybody coming around here?<eos> Was she afraid of anyone, any strangers?<eos> No, mostly she just talked about how messed up things are for her here.<eos> Messed up how?<eos> Well, how she wanted to move out.<eos> How she and her stepmom fought a lot.<eos> And she said that one time she saw the stepmom and the trainer, like... you know.<eos> No, I don't.
I just...<eos> I-I couldn't grind them up after I came back from seeing my brother.<eos> It's so stupid, I know...<eos> Uh, Dr. Hodgins, do you want Mr. Fisher to do it for you?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> They're mine.<eos> I'll have the results for you soon.<eos> I think I understand the saw marks we found on the ulna and the C7.<eos> They didn't do much damage.
I've got to go get the dog walker now, all right?<eos> Let's go.<eos> You tried to cut her up, destroy her face so we wouldn't know who she was, but you couldn't go through with it.<eos> Because you loved her.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> I mean, you said that you... you used to sit on her deck, right?<eos> Is that where you planned the kidnapping?<eos> We tested your clippers, the ones you use to groom the dogs.<eos> They were used to cut off Lauren's toe.<eos> She did that herself.
And that's me.<eos> Man, I never knew it, but I guess I've been looking for you my whole life.<eos> To complete the picture.<eos> I can finally see past the static, Jeffrey, like you.<eos> Let me bring you back.<eos> I promise you'll never have to leave your home.<eos> Never.<eos> Is that... how you know 20,000 Leagues so well?<eos> Did he read it to you, too?<eos> Yeah, he did.
Detective Brian Lucas.<eos> I'm afraid I've got some bad news.<eos> Oh, my God, this can't be happening.<eos> I know, it's a shock.<eos> We do have a few questions to ask you, though, okay?<eos> There were, uh, cinder blocks in your car, as well as a coil of rope.<eos> And your trunk was lined with plastic.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> I-I'm sorry, I don't know...<eos> But no, I-I didn't.
I have a daughter.<eos> Her name is Tingting.<eos> This is Zhuo Yihang, Head of Wudang.<eos> These are nice snacks.<eos> Take them to Xiong's man, Yuan Chonghuan, as reward from the Palace.<eos> Master.<eos> Are you going to Liaodong?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you know, General Xiong is a patriot?<eos> I do.

I know where she is.<eos> If you want to see her, come with me now.<eos> How did he lie to me?<eos> Hurst. Every day, I saw him.<eos> I know his wife.<eos> I know his little girl, Tory. - Kyle...<eos> - She's just eight.<eos> But I saw him aim that gun at your dad. I saw him shoot Finley.<eos> - I saw it, too.<eos> We all did.
Oh, there's more flight delays, so Joel isn't getting in till late tomorrow night.<eos> And then six hours later, he has to turn right back around, which means we only have six hours to figure out all the things going into our house for always and forever.<eos> So I bought a bunch of choices, and I was gonna put them in the house, but the cement was still wet.<eos> So I'm holding them here so we can pick as soon as he arrives. What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> That's perfectly sound.<eos> Fix it.<eos> Big Z, this is only the first visit out of many.<eos> You don't have to do all this stuff today.<eos> Yes, I do.
So?<eos> Actually, the very fact that you think this would be offensive to me is offensive.<eos> You're the one being racist.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not the one who called you a Mexican.<eos> Called me a Mexican?<eos> You're doing it again.<eos> I'm bending over backwards to not be racist right now.<eos> All right. Well, what did he say when you told him I wasn't Mexican?<eos> I didn't.
If only I had been more willing to be brave, I would have stopped Lex Luthor before he escaped the 31st century.<eos> -We make lousy superheroes. -Yes.<eos> We are nothing like the Justice League.<eos> I wish we'd have just disappeared like they did.<eos> Yes, perhaps it would have been better.<eos> Wait, that's it.<eos> Are you thinking what I am thinking?<eos> -That this tunnel really reeks?<eos> -No.<eos> Yes, it does.
Uh... I mean, it's...<eos> Agent Jinks, it's your go, I believe.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Can I maybe go later, or you know, not at all?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Don't go all Pete on me.<eos> We each have to do this.<eos> No, I'm not, it's just...<eos> What if I don't have a defining Warehouse moment?<eos> Of course you do, Pookie.
I'm not sleepy.<eos> The sun's out.<eos> Well, give it a shot.<eos> Nap time.<eos> I'm too old for naps, Tate.<eos> You're bad at tuck-ins.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why do you have to hurt people?<eos> - Well, sometimes you have to.<eos> - No, you don't.
Why do you have to hurt people?<eos> - Well, sometimes you have to.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Well, he lied to me.<eos> He deserved it.<eos> You know that's not the truth.<eos> Oh, what?<eos> And you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I'm not gonna give you a "I've been a lousy father" speech.<eos> But you've been a lousy father.<eos> After you went away, I was a damn pariah.<eos> In my home, I had a stigma on me.<eos> I wanted to leave.<eos> I tried to, believe me.<eos> This place is all I got.<eos> I have to be here.<eos> I'll always be here.<eos> But you don't.
He didn't kill anyone.<eos> I know.<eos> Bo.<eos> We have to leave, sweetheart.<eos> Come get your things.<eos> Tate!<eos> - You're alive! - Oh!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Billy, I thought you were...<eos> Yeah, so did I.
- What?<eos> - You drive all the way to Chico to see that little weasel and you don't tell me?<eos> !<eos> Mom, please, can I just have five minutes where we make it about me?<eos> - All I'm saying is...<eos> - Two minutes!<eos> Give me two!<eos> Look, I'm sorry, but I'm a human being and I have feelings.<eos> Are you?<eos> Do you?
Well, at least that hasn't changed.<eos> And I don't suppose it ever will.<eos> No, I don't suppose it will either.<eos> Clara, honestly... ..I don't want you to change.<eos> It was no bother, really.<eos> I saw your advert, I figured it out - happy to play your game.<eos> No.<eos> No... no, I didn't place the ad.<eos> You placed the ad.<eos> No, I didn't.
How would you kill me?<eos> Why don't you have a drink first?<eos> It's only human.<eos> I am not human.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> Why can't you stay dead, coward!<eos> What do you think of the view?<eos> I do not think of it.<eos> I don't think of it.<eos> I don't.
I'm not.<eos> What is it then?<eos> Is someone gonna come take me away, too?<eos> Nobody's gonna come and take you away.<eos> Why would you even think that?<eos> Because...<eos> I'm different.<eos> People think I'm strange.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> You do.
I let you in there because I thought you were going to get something from her.<eos> That bitch is lying.<eos> I wasn't at Sam's that night.<eos> Okay then, where were you?<eos> I have to ask you now.<eos> I was at home.<eos> Sleeping alone.<eos> Look, you don't actually believe her, do you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Put on some tea.<eos> Bring out the cookies.<eos> I baked them for Janek's return.<eos> Come.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Look.<eos> This one is my favorite.<eos> With Monia. Tadzio...<eos> I told him so many times<eos> Do something with that hair.
I made a promise.<eos> About Tate?<eos> To whom?<eos> I made a promise.<eos> Hope you painted the room pink.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> She's gonna be like me.<eos> Like my mother.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - No, I do.
Salut?<eos> Salut.<eos> [Both wincing] Those were five good years.<eos> Okay... so, you wanna talk about what happened?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> A girl can't take her favorite partner out for several shots of bourbon?<eos> Anytime.<eos> [Laughing] How about this, let's start with this, what's your deal with Samantha?<eos> I don't have a problem with Samantha.<eos> You don't?
That was you?<eos> I only had the armor for 24 hours.<eos> I scared you off.<eos> No, uh, no.<eos> I just...<eos> Overwhelmed me, maybe.<eos> Uh, I should go.<eos> I... Yeah.<eos> Do you remember our first dinner?<eos> I do, I do.
She's not in her right mind.<eos> I am so in my right mind!<eos> Look, this could've worked!<eos> You were one piece of fish away from having a great night, getting back together, and fixing all of our problems.<eos> What...<eos> what is she talking about?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> We're cursed.<eos> What?<eos> And now you do.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have liked it.<eos> I mean, all that sun.<eos> Followed by all that fog.<eos> You belong here.<eos> What if I made the biggest mistake of my life, and let the right person just walk away forever?<eos> Yeah, I think about that every day.<eos> It doesn't mean that I didn't love him.<eos> No.<eos> Definitely not.<eos> Because-because I did.
What have you been doing?<eos> Well, I mean, just taking care of Grandma.<eos> I mean, when she heard I wanted to leave, she had, like, 20,000 errands for me to run, and suddenly she couldn't live without her heart medicine, which is so weird, so...<eos> Surprise, darling.<eos> Heard you went back to BlueBell.<eos> Cut my trip short 'cause I missed my girlfriend.<eos> Oh, my. "Girlfriend"?<eos> Carter Covington, we met at, uh...<eos> Oh, I-I remember, son.<eos> Yes, I do.
I should be so angry at her.<eos> But I can't make her get out of my head.<eos> Know what that's like.<eos> Yeah, that's Lemon for you.<eos> You both understand this?<eos> Not proud of it.<eos> I brought apology donuts.<eos> Wow, you are really into the "I'm sorry" pastries, huh?<eos> Only if the situation calls for it.<eos> And this one does.
I'm in.<eos> Good.<eos> Halfway home.<eos> Sorry, closed for lunch.<eos> You didn't do it, did you?<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> The man came.<eos> But you didn't shoot him.<eos> Did you?<eos> No, I didn't.
It's just the perfect case study.<eos> Two specimens, almost identical, offers us the chance to study the gene that makes you so special.<eos> Any scientist would've killed for the chance to study them.<eos> Perhaps a poor choice of words.<eos> Or maybe a scientist who himself had a paranormal brother.<eos> Well, I'm sure my own personal history probably fueled my interest subconsciously.<eos> I think it's a little more than that.<eos> Meaning?<eos> When I asked you what happened to my father's body after he was killed, You said you cremated him.<eos> I did.
It makes tribute all the more meaningful.<eos> And when you pay tribute... ..is it to your God or your father?<eos> I used to believe they were one and the same.<eos> And now?<eos> There is goodness in you.<eos> There is piety.<eos> There is grace.<eos> No.<eos> No-one looks on me and sees grace.<eos> I do.
It counts for shit, Leo... ..when you start putting people...in chains.<eos> Nobody ever knows better than you, do they?<eos> But you can't get mad, Leo, when the stars don't move as quick as you do.<eos> Fuck me.<eos> The orbits.<eos> The speed of them.<eos> That's the answer.<eos> We're not heading in the wrong direction.<eos> The crescent of Venus was different because Venus... it doesn't circle the earth.<eos> None of it does.
You're not the only one.<eos> I'm just saying, your feelings for Cat aside, this is just as much about Tori as you.<eos> Fight it all you want, but the truth is you share a unique connection with her.<eos> A primal connection.<eos> You may be the only two beasts left on the planet.<eos> Relax.<eos> She's fine.<eos> She could've died, Tess.<eos> On my watch.<eos> But she didn't.
The younger, the better. Maybe I can... repair the situation with the help of your Russian beauty.<eos> You know, I am reminded of this old proverb that if you stand by the river's edge long enough, eventually... you will see your dead enemy's body floating past.<eos> the money or...<eos> Your choice.<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> I told you, Alexander took care of it.<eos> - It wasn't any problem.<eos> - It wasn't a problem? - No.<eos> Lena, do you have any idea what's going on right now?<eos> You don't.
Alexander.<eos> - Are you hurt?<eos> - No.<eos> They took Mya. Sasha's dead. - This can't be happening.<eos> - Well, he... he's not dead. That's for sure.<eos> Why do you think Vladimir took Mya?<eos> He said he was taking her to Mr. Chen.<eos> Mr. Chen wanted me, but he took Mya instead.<eos> I don't even know who Mr. Chen is.<eos> Well, I do.
Yeah, and I should've known better.<eos> And yet it was my idea to search his loft.<eos> I sabotaged this.<eos> You know, I think I wanted him to be the guy.<eos> Not consciously, but when Catherine told me that she didn't know if she could move forward with Gabe, I was so happy.<eos> Which is so messed up because I'm probably the reason why she can't move forward in the first place.<eos> Oh, my God, you do still have feelings for her.<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, yes.<eos> Fine, I do.
We haven't told him yet whether or not you made it.<eos> I get to decide whether I go into Witness Protection or not?<eos> Someplace sunny.<eos> You know, the vows that I wrote, they were for the man that I lost six years ago.<eos> All that time with Barnes changed him.<eos> But I'm a profiler.<eos> I was so focused on who he had been that I couldn't see what he had become.<eos> I know what that's like.<eos> Okay, you got to go.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Uh, was there a directive for... for Alison?<eos> - None in her records.<eos> - Who's the next of kin?<eos> The shooter!<eos> I mean, husband.<eos> - He's the one who gets to decide whether to pull the plug or not?<eos> Some days are easier than others.<eos> "Remo" failure, you know what that is, Dr. Conner?<eos> - Renal.<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah. Got it.<eos> - Nothing yet.<eos> - Come on, Mom.<eos> Come on, - try to move.<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> - Come on, Mom.<eos> - We need to be patient.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
I don't play anymore.<eos> You play every day.<eos> You just don't do it on a chessboard.<eos> The only game I'm playing right now is "catch a killer."<eos> And I need your help.<eos> This is a list of chess moves.<eos> I need to know what move comes next.<eos> You already know it.<eos> In here.<eos> I really don't.
Well, that couldn't have been it.<eos> And then I realized that chess... requires a lot of sacrifice.<eos> Too much sacrifice.<eos> And I just didn't think it was worth it.<eos> It stopped being fun.<eos> It requires a totally different way of thinking.<eos> You have to retrain your mind, and... it starts to become an obsession.<eos> Kind of like this job.<eos> If you know what I mean.<eos> I do.
I'm really glad to see you.<eos> Oh. Because I've come to a huge revelation.<eos> I'm swearing off the opposite sex.<eos> I'm going on a three-month man cleanse.<eos> A "man cleanse"?<eos> I'm flushing out my system.<eos> I'm gonna recharge, so I'm ready for the right man.<eos> And until then, I'm putting my mind and body and my soul into fiance's.<eos> And listen, I know that you want to be more of a silent partner now...<eos> Yes, I do.
You're Lemon Breeland.<eos> Everybody knows that you believe in love and happily ever after.<eos> So, you stopped yourself from sleeping with Peter because he was just another detour.<eos> - Another detour?<eos> - No offense, but meatball, Enrique, Carter Covington...<eos> I mean, were any of those roads to happiness?<eos> (Scoffs) Shut up.<eos> I'm glad that you are not my friend, because you are terrible at it.<eos> Oh, and I suppose you got a real knack for it?<eos> I do.
FOR 10 YEARS AFTER JOSEON'S FOUNDING...<eos> A TEMPORARY SEAL CALLED 'JOSEON'S ROYAL SEAL' WAS USED<eos> Hey!<eos> - Don't tie that there!<eos> - You said to!<eos> - That's not what I said!<eos> - No!<eos> The Wind's blowing this way!<eos> - Stop confusing us!<eos> - You do it!
Just...<eos> Well, I'm gonna go back to bed.<eos> Schmidt, that mattress is heaven.<eos> It's pretty good.<eos> See?<eos> You don't think I'm scary, do you, baby?<eos> Hey, no. - I was just kidding.<eos> - No. Hey, Caroline, there's something I need to say.<eos> Nick, you don't have to do this.<eos> No, I-I do.
Little Paris and her Magical Closet.<eos> Those are little-kid toys.<eos> Hold on.<eos> What...?<eos> What did you ask Santa for?<eos> I can't tell you, or else I won't get what I want.<eos> I didn't even tell Dad.<eos> Well, you know, we should probably mail those letters right away, so....<eos> - You know, I could take it for you.<eos> - Dad already did.
Twenty bucks?<eos> Boy, I'm in the wrong business.<eos> Well, I think I've got something very nice for you.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> I hear you want a doggy for Christmas.<eos> Well, we just happen to have one here.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> That's what makes it all worthwhile.<eos> - How you doing, Santa?
What's your real name?<eos> Why are you asking me that?<eos> Because I think he kidnapped you.<eos> No. It's not like that.<eos> He saved me.<eos> I owe him my life.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't owe him anything.<eos> Your life is yours, not his.<eos> Oh, I do.

I'm not a bad person.<eos> Nobody's saying you are.<eos> Okay, look, relationships are complicated.<eos> I understand.<eos> When we bought this house, we were gonna fix it up and make it perfect and grow old together.<eos> And then we just couldn't agree on anything.<eos> Well, then, I hope the open house goes well, 'cause it sounds to me like it's best for both of you once you move on.<eos> I've been horrible, haven't I?<eos> He drives me crazy, but I don't want to see him suffer.<eos> I don't.
Tom Selleck or Bobby Ewing?<eos> Harrison Ford all the way.<eos> Dr. Kalfas asked me to deliver the placenta.<eos> You don't have to do any crazy jujitsu flips like he did with this guy, do you?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> So, are we gonna go with Sam?<eos> I think.<eos> You?<eos> Does he look like a Sam to you?<eos> He does, yeah.
Come on, Hookfang.<eos> Let's go think with our muscles.<eos> - Problem, son?<eos> - Uh, problem?<eos> What problem?<eos> No, no, everyone is happy, everything is great.<eos> - Good to hear.<eos> - Yep, yep, yep. Everything is right as rain.<eos> - If you say so.<eos> - I do.
Finally, the mysteries that haunted you...<eos> Oh, dude!<eos> Who ripped ass?<eos> Come on, I beefed back there, like, five minutes ago.<eos> You probably dragged it in your suit.<eos> Oh, God, it reeks.<eos> You messed everything up.<eos> It's a fart.<eos> Grow up. It doesn't even smell that bad.<eos> - Yeah, it does.
- Oh, no.<eos> - What? Our boss is now on Twitter.<eos> Is it as bad as I think?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Read this one. "Been wearing the same pajamas all week... ♪ Dealwithit." Terrible huh?<eos> May I speak to you two in private?<eos> Shut the door.<eos> I just want to say that I have kids and I really need this job.<eos> You don't have kids.<eos> I do, though.
Well, that sounds great, Mrs. Ellis.<eos> - Bridget.<eos> - Bridget.<eos> You know that I usually write with very experienced writers.<eos> But once in a while, I get the itch to collaborate with someone who's new... and raw...<eos> And unsoiled.<eos> It gives me a charge.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I think so.<eos> Well, of course you do.
- We're all here for you. - All of us.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> Okay, I will open up to you guys.<eos> I am upset about a lot of women.<eos> I'm upset about Sam, I'm upset about you acting like a woman, and I'm upset about the infant that is literally taking a crap on my poker table.<eos> That's my fault, I shouldn't have given her apricots.<eos> Will, it's nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> I know what it's like to get blown off by women.<eos> Poker chip.<eos> No, I don't.
You don't have to lie or pretend.<eos> You can do what you want.<eos> You can set your own course.<eos> Well, it's not all it's cracked up to be, but there are things I don't miss.<eos> Like my mother's meddling, for one.<eos> When I left, Henry had her locked in the tower, just until the annulment came through, but that didn't stop her from stirring up trouble.<eos> She tried to get Mary and Bash...<eos> What?<eos> You don't want to hear it.<eos> I do.
And the wine.<eos> Yes, and the wine.<eos> I should go.<eos> Thank you for what you did yesterday for me and my brother.<eos> It was brave and incredibly gallant.<eos> And I'm so sorry to have imposed on you.<eos> It was no imposition.<eos> Truly, it was nice to spend time with someone who I... didn't have to hide from.<eos> I'm sorry; you don't want to hear this.<eos> Yes, I do.
Ok, you cannot tell anyone about this, Brandon.<eos> Not until we figure out what to do. Do you understand?<eos> - Yeah, yes.<eos> - I mean it, I'm serious.<eos> This could end up very badly if this gets out.<eos> Ok.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was... really trying to help.<eos> Well, at least no one knows.<eos> - Ana does.
Then is it ok if I ask her out?<eos> Yeah. Sure.<eos> So, I talked to your mom.<eos> She's fine if you wanna go back tomorrow, so you can work on your audition and focus...<eos> Dad.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> For everything.<eos> - Didn't think...<eos> - No.<eos> No, you didn't.
Go to the room. Let's live, now.<eos> - And fuck?<eos> Yeah, I get it.<eos> - That's all it is!<eos> - I'm not a dick!<eos> And after a funeral!<eos> If she'd wanted me, she'd said...<eos> Hey, I like you. Wanna screvxfl<eos> - Nobody says that out loud!<eos> - I do, for example.
This black shin has to go in. It'll look great.<eos> - Wait. Stop!<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - What's this? This?<eos> - Those are good for dust rags.<eos> - A rag?<eos> My favourite shin?<eos> No, no.<eos> - You didn't notice the holes.<eos> - Of course, I did!
I sacrificed saving your prince for my ship.<eos> I am so sorry, Ariel.<eos> You're a coward!<eos> And a monster!<eos> You let a man die for your ship?<eos> !<eos> What kind of person does that?<eos> The kind who's empty, who believes that a ship can fill a void left by a broken heart.<eos> And that makes it okay?<eos> ! No, it doesn't.
!<eos> What kind of person does that?<eos> The kind who's empty, who believes that a ship can fill a void left by a broken heart.<eos> And that makes it okay?<eos> ! No, it doesn't.<eos> I would give anything to take it back, to make things right.<eos> Anything?<eos> Yes... anything.<eos> How am I supposed to trust a man who no longer believes in love?<eos> I still do.
She wanted me to say goodbye to Mary Margaret for her.<eos> Oh. At the rate mermaids swim, she's probably already there.<eos> In fact, let's find out.<eos> I thought you couldn't use mirror magic to look between worlds.<eos> I can't.<eos> But after seeing the raw power you possess, I think maybe you can.<eos> There's no need.<eos> I'm sure she's fine.<eos> Anyway, it's bad form to spy on such a private affair.<eos> How do I do it?
You're a liar!<eos> Come on, Fenton!<eos> You don't really believe she actually loved you?<eos> Oh, you poor sap.<eos> Aaah! Get over here!<eos> Get over!<eos> I'm going to kill you right now!<eos> Fenton, stop!<eos> You don't want to do this. Oh, I do.<eos> I really do!
Remember me?<eos> Lenny Powell, I'm arresting you for the murders of Daniel Pembrook, Rosie Turner and the attempted murder...<eos> He didn't do it.<eos> What?<eos> We need to track down Chris Hutton.<eos> I just hope you're not too late, that's all.<eos> Too late for what?<eos> He's gone after Rebecca.<eos> He doesn't know where she is.<eos> But Ruby does.
What profit would there be in that?<eos> I saw the plans myself.<eos> - You saw a map, I suspect.<eos> - I did.<eos> I have a number of maps.<eos> A map is not the same thing as a plan.<eos> So what's it all in aid of?<eos> The bombs, the triggers?<eos> If you had chosen to abide awhile, you might have learned.<eos> What do I do with him?
Marry me.<eos> How many times have you asked?<eos> 100,000?<eos> Then ask again.<eos> Marry me.<eos> And once again.<eos> Marry me.<eos> I should be honored.<eos> When did you know me?<eos> I didn't, not for sure.
When the day arrives that such a word is considered illmannered in good company, then we really will have lost all hope.<eos> You do believe in it, then.<eos> In love?<eos> I'm familiar with the affliction, yes.<eos> Did you ever marry?<eos> The truth now.<eos> I did not...<eos> Although I came very close once.<eos> But you know how it feels to want to spend the days of your life with someone that you cherish?<eos> I do.
Nobody thinks that.<eos> Everybody thinks that, and they're not wrong.<eos> The child will be a daily reminder of our betrayal.<eos> That's not so. James never saw it as such.<eos> Whatever he claims, his heart will be broken.<eos> I believe he's a better man than you take him for and stronger.<eos> Well, I believe he's had more than his equitable share of sacrificing himself in the name of someone else's welfare.<eos> Then to be clear, what are you saying?<eos> I have to lay it out?<eos> Yes, you do.
But if that should occur, don't hesitate to use these.<eos> If the moment should come, then commit to it.<eos> Aim for the head. Don't hesitate.<eos> A bullet is faster than a person with a knife but not as much faster as you'd think.<eos> If you hesitate to shoot, even for half a second, she'll be upon you, and you'll be dead.<eos> Are we clear?<eos> Good.<eos> You wanted me? Yes.<eos> I was wondering if you knew where Nenna might be.<eos> I don't.
But that doesn't mean that you know more about him than I do or that your opinion of him is worth more than mine, because it isn't.<eos> And what if I were to prove otherwise?<eos> You couldn't.<eos> What if I were to tell you that Thomas Lowe was the man that did this to me?<eos> What do you mean? Did what?<eos> Tom Lowe had me arrested.<eos> Tom Lowe had me tortured.<eos> I was a jacobite, Tim, part of a secret rebellion that sought to depose the King of England and replace him with a true heir.<eos> And you told me a traitor betrayed you to the English.<eos> And so he did.
I'll need rum to irrigate the wounds, a strong needle, and waxed thread.<eos> But first?<eos> I should soak both needle and thread in the rum.<eos> Good.<eos> Clear that table!<eos> He's taken enough.<eos> Why... Why did you tell them to stop?<eos> You're forgiven, Mr. Lowe.<eos> Let it be.<eos> I didn't.
What things?<eos> Things about me. You and me.<eos> What things?<eos> You know what things.<eos> I told you to stay away.<eos> - I have.<eos> How was I supposed to know she'd be there.<eos> Why are you trying to make trouble for me?<eos> Sally Ann now thinks that I attacked you that night in the study.<eos> You did.
My mother was Catholic.<eos> What, the woman that killed herself? Abandoned you?<eos> The police were here earlier.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Knocking on all the doors, talking to all the men in the neighbourhood.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I told them you were in Scotland.<eos> Is that all?<eos> I wanted to tell them that I'd lied for you.<eos> But you didn't?
- Oh, I think you do.<eos> Your father was decapitated in a motorcycle accident.<eos> Or have you forgotten?<eos> No, I haven't forgotten.<eos> It's OK. My mother killed herself when I was seven.<eos> Left me alone and unwanted.<eos> There's suffering all around us.<eos> Why not take some pleasure from it?<eos> I don't know how to get pleasure from suffering.<eos> Yes, you do.
[Laughs] Shut up.<eos> I'm glad you got back together with your girlfriend.<eos> You two are like the school's Portia and Ellen.<eos> Which one am I?<eos> Please say Portia.<eos> Trust me, you're the Portia.<eos> Which is why we probably shouldn't make out again.<eos> I don't want to be the ass[Bleep] that breaks up Hester's cutest couple.<eos> The thing is, Amy and I have an open relationship.<eos> - You do?
Only desperate people respond that fast.<eos> Oh, my God, super cute.<eos> You're so lucky.<eos> Molly and Lucas seem like great parents.<eos> "Molly and Lucas"?<eos> Look, I don't know what you're up to, but cut it out.<eos> What is your deal?<eos> This morning I came to tell you how much I liked your song, and you treated me like I'd groped you in an elevator.<eos> - Oh, you know what you did.<eos> - No, I don't.
You two, get a room.<eos> I'm serious. You're standing where the bridal throne is going.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I don't really see gay or straight.<eos> I just see the person.<eos> That's how I feel!<eos> Ask Peter, I say it all the time.<eos> I would, but he looks a little busy.<eos> I think Shane really likes him.<eos> Of course he does.
I promise, they don't bite.<eos> But maybe we could grab one after?<eos> You mean, like, kind of a date thing?<eos> People still go on those, don't they?<eos> That's a really sweet offer, Pabs.<eos> Lauren was right.<eos> You're a good guy.<eos> I'm just not really the dating type, and I don't want to lead you on.<eos> and I can't believe I just said that, because I think you're really hot.<eos> But I did, and no take-backs, so bye.
When I first heard I'd be working for Gordon Clark, I wasn't sure he even knew his way around a motherboard.<eos> Well, I've been proven wrong a hundred times over, and, today, my respect for this guy has been taken to a whole new level.<eos> To Gordo, for kicking ass and taking names.<eos> To Gordo.<eos> Thanks, Gordon.<eos> Good job, buddy.<eos> Hey, I see you told them the good news about the LCD screen.<eos> Yeah, everyone's excited.<eos> Good, I thought maybe you didn't get my message.<eos> No, I did.
Curled toes.<eos> So, Gabe, I hear you're leaving.<eos> I'm going to try one of your canapes.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Weren't you going to tell me?<eos> Of course I was.<eos> I just, um...<eos> I didn't, because...<eos> I didn't want you to think that it had anything to do with us.<eos> It doesn't?
I mean, it's a little eerie.<eos> I'm following the same investigation she did, looking for the same gem she was.<eos> Trying to figure out who's after beasts, 200 years later.<eos> Maybe you're meant to solve something she couldn't.<eos> So you can move on.<eos> Like you are?<eos> Catherine, please don't take it personally.<eos> I'm just, um...<eos> I need a change.<eos> We both do.
On it.<eos> Andy, oh, my God.<eos> What are you doing? Holly, I-<eos> - I'm--<eos> I don't know- - I-<eos> I don't know what I'm about to say but I have been waiting for the perfect moment to do this but something keeps getting in the way.<eos> It wasn't until you went missing that I realized that something this whole time was me.<eos> See, I got this voice in my head that says I don't deserve a woman as beautiful as you are.<eos> I don't deserve a woman as kind as you are.<eos> And I probably don't, but...
- You scared?<eos> - Yeah, I suppose I am.<eos> All right, folks, it's gonna be all right.<eos> We gots to keep moving, though.<eos> - Let's go. - We've come this far and we almost--<eos> Well, well, look who we have here.<eos> You had no right to kill that man.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> - You had no goddamn right.<eos> - Oh, actually, I do.
This is our now.<eos> I am the antidote, sweetie.<eos> Let me heal you.<eos> You can come in.<eos> It was positive?<eos> I did this to him.<eos> Jessica, I am so sorry.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> Of course you didn't.
Yeah.<eos> That was good.<eos> But anything else?<eos> Maybe something a little deeper?<eos> 'Member how you and Hoyt were fighting yesterday about him not wanting kids?<eos> Yeah, I don't think I'll be forgetting that anytime soon.<eos> Well, I want kids, Brigette.<eos> I mean, I really, really want 'em.<eos> But... what if I have a girl?<eos> What if you do?
Let's do this, sweetheart.<eos> Where did you imagine it?<eos> Huh?<eos> Where did you imagine us doing it?<eos> - On the throne. - Mm.<eos> Well, on the throne it is. Oh.<eos> ♪ Strange you never knew ♪<eos> What happens next?<eos> I straddle you.<eos> Then do it, Ginger.
Where were you tonight?<eos> I saw some friends.<eos> Your fangbanger from last night,<eos> Sookie Stackhouse?<eos> - No.<eos> - Shame on you, Mr. Northman.<eos> I offer you the world and every time all you offer me is lies.<eos> Ah!<eos> Does Sookie Stackhouse know about Sarah?<eos> Does she?
- ...because I am running out of tissues.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And know that my love is present even when I am not.<eos> And know that my love is present even when I am not.<eos> Okay, good, you two are almost hitched.<eos> Jessica, do you take this man to be your husband?<eos> Do you promise to love him, honor and keep him in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others be faithful to him, as long as you both shall live?<eos> - Hoyt, do you take this woman to be your wife?<eos> Do you promise to love her, honor and keep her in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others be faithful to her, as long as you both shall live?<eos> - I do.
I think so.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Thank you, Reverend Daniels.<eos> Any time.<eos> I know it's not my place, but you want some advice about that sermon?<eos> Ha, ha. Honey, I'll take advice wherever I can find it.<eos> Tell them help is on its way.<eos> Tell them it will all be over soon.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
- Good girl. - You're all right, honey.<eos> - You're all right.<eos> - You're all right.<eos> - Come here, honey. - Oh, my God, dad.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Come here.<eos> Let me see. - Whitney, please.<eos> - No, you totally - just saved her life.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.
I could've used an introduction.<eos> - You live around here? Uh, yeah, a little farther up.<eos> Ditch plains.<eos> What about you?<eos> Just right over there, actually.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, it's not my house. It belongs to my father-in-law.<eos> Your father-in-law's Bruce Butler?<eos> You know him?<eos> Well, who doesn't? - Oh, right.
Because the $5 million you're not getting pays for my silence.<eos> "Silence"?<eos> For what?<eos> We both know I didn't do this.<eos> No.<eos> You did.<eos> Rumor on the streets is, you're still angry you didn't get the Fishscale rights from the Metas, so you took out your anger on my supplier.<eos> Are you still upset that we wouldn't move your product?<eos> How do I know you're not setting me up?<eos> You don't.
I'll get you what you want.<eos> But only if you deliver the money personally.<eos> My client, who has no criminal record, was not predisposed to commit the crime were it not for the egregious and illegal efforts of... of Captain Chapel.<eos> Predisposition is a technicality.<eos> Which will easily hold up in court.<eos> Karros v. California.<eos> Can I see you outside?<eos> He's right, Sam, it's entrapment.<eos> How could you have not anticipated this?<eos> I did.
It is imperative that you find them immediately.<eos> I don't care who you have to bribe, threaten, or kill.<eos> Any questions?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Danilov failed us.<eos> I won't.<eos> Find that child.<eos> Not easy figuring out how to be a mother.<eos> - Do you have children?<eos> - My sister did.
The blanket's wet.<eos> She's cold.<eos> This is about the baby.<eos> It's not about you.<eos> You need to get her warmed up.<eos> If you care about her at all, you're gonna do what I say.<eos> We need to get her dry.<eos> Follow me.<eos> - Juliette, you can't trust her.<eos> - Oh, I don't.
Does he really believe we're saving these people?<eos> I know I do because I choose to believe it.<eos> If you believe it, it is your reality.<eos> I was raised by a woman who told me every day that I was ugly and sick and a mistake.<eos> Joe was the first person to look at me and tell me that I was perfect.<eos> He believed in me until I could believe in myself.<eos> You have to trust him, Robert.<eos> I want to.<eos> All you have to do is believe in him.<eos> I do, I do, but--
So he stands up to him and says, no more.<eos> They're threatened, think he might talk, so they kill him.<eos> That's good.<eos> It's very good.<eos> Well, too bad it's not supported by fact.<eos> Look for any more defensive wounds.<eos> If he was fighting for his life, there must be more evidence of it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I'm surprised you want an opinion from a psychologist.<eos> I don't.
Thank you. And, finally...<eos> Brittany S. Pierce.<eos> I called in some favors with Sue.<eos> I figure that everybody deserves a high school graduation, even if it's a year late.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the William McKinley High graduating class of 2013.<eos> Brittany, I have to tell you something.<eos> I think I've made a huge mistake.<eos> You don't want to run away with me, do you.<eos> What? No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Of course I do.
Hmm.<eos> Other potential Adam Peers?<eos> Each of them, at some point today.<eos> Other researchers, executives at Merrill-Grand involved in the development of Toproxefin.<eos> So you think Adam Peer was someone else inside the company.<eos> Unfortunately, I've also already eliminated each of them, as either a coconspirator in the fraud or unaware of it until after the scandal broke.<eos> Lawrence Cranford is the only individual who knew that his teammates were concealing negative data, but was not himself part of the deceit.<eos> Well, it has to be someone else he told.<eos> According to his own e-mails, he only told a handful of higher-ups who rejected his warnings.<eos> Unless, of course, one of them didn't.
We move forward with the plan.<eos> Right now, the Metas believe they're the ones who are setting the trap.<eos> What they don't know is that their head is already in ours.<eos> But it needs to be a surgical strike.<eos> The timing exact.<eos> At the same time Gnomo and his soldiers take out El Mozo's lieutenants and Matias in Mexicali, I'll take out El Mozo myself.<eos> Pop, that's suicide.<eos> You ain't got no one to back you up.<eos> No.<eos> We do. The Lords.
Perhaps it's time we tried to do things differently.<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> We'll go ahead with your plan for now, Daniel.<eos> But, Daniel, you must reach out to Lavar and make sure he agrees to it.<eos> I already did.<eos> I should've run it past you first.<eos> But we were running out of time and I wanted to at least test the waters.<eos> But before he would agree, he wanted to have a sit-down, face-to-face, so he can look you in the eye<eos> - and know if you were sincere. - They'll never let Lavar in here.<eos> No, we don't do it here.

Your whole life is a lie.<eos> Every lie I've told... it was for you, Javier.<eos> For your dream...<eos> - to get this family out.<eos> - Oh, Ryan, that was our dream to get this family out, and you know what?<eos> - It's not over.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> That dream ended the moment you decided to kill Jessica Chapel.<eos> But I didn't kill Jessica Chapel.<eos> You did.

I will be blamed for the CIA chiefs death. I will be blamed for the riots.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> Because it was my video and it's my face on it.<eos> Also, people are watching me now.<eos> - No one is watching you.<eos> - Who's that guy?<eos> - That's a teaching fellow.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'll-I'll see you again, right?<eos> I hope so.<eos> Oh, hey, have fun.<eos> Commander McGarrett.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sean Hutton.<eos> Honolulu Register.<eos> We met at the governor's Christmas party last year.<eos> Oh, sure, I remember.<eos> How you doing?
What's the connection?<eos> Burns' wife.<eos> Meet Sally Ann Burns.<eos> But we know her better as Sally Ann Caldwell.<eos> The name on the other plane ticket.<eos> The reason we couldn't find her is because she hasn't used her maiden name in over 20 years.<eos> So Guy Ingram and Burns' wife were gonna run away together.<eos> Burns must've found out and made sure that didn't happen.<eos> All right, how do we get to Sally Ann?<eos> We don't.
You know how I planned this big party for you and you thought it was the sweetest thing in the world?<eos> Mm-hmm. Well, it's actually even sweeter.<eos> I bribed Bev to get you the afternoon off.<eos> - You did what?<eos> - Isn't that sweet?<eos> No!<eos> No, that's not sweet.<eos> Will, I'm a doctor.<eos> Do you have any idea how important my job is to me?<eos> Whoa, yeah! Of course I do.
Here.<eos> All I have.<eos> - Yeah, I don't need all of it.<eos> - What else?<eos> You seem good.<eos> You seem pretty good.<eos> - What else do you want because I'm busy.<eos> - I want... how much is it...<eos> And I don't wanna get involved in any of your fucked up shit ever again.<eos> I don't.
- A cartoon.<eos> I am a cartoon.<eos> - I'm animated.<eos> I know who I am.<eos> Alright, look at me. I am a cartoon.<eos> Hey, hey, you okay in there?<eos> Hey, hey. Wash your hands. Wash your hands.<eos> You should be working.<eos> You should get your own place.<eos> But you don't. Why?
Finally had time to do all the things we normally couldn't.<eos> Like what?<eos> Go to the park, see a movie, go to the zoo, just do nothing.<eos> Life was good... really good.<eos> It didn't get lonely?<eos> Just the two of you?<eos> [sighs] Henry had tons of friends at school, and I... had someone.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Why are you sorry?<eos> Of course you did.
Thank you.<eos> Doctor, based on your extensive experience in treating sex addiction, can you explain to the panel how an otherwise-stable individual behaves when engaged in sexually addictive behavior?<eos> There's a complete lapse of judgment when the sex addict attempts to alleviate their feelings of isolation.<eos> And in your sexpert opinion, is Mr. Infeld a sex addict?<eos> Oh, one of the most prolific I've ever seen.<eos> He's agreed to let me co-write a book about him.<eos> Oh, I'm going to mention you two boys in the acknowledgments.<eos> Um, not now, Stanton, but thanks.<eos> Besides a paid witness with an obvious financial interest to Mr. Infeld, do you have anyone who can testify to the devious, reckless sexual encounters they've had with Stanton Infeld over the years?<eos> We do not.
If you think about it any other way, you'll end up rocking in a corner.<eos> I need to get home, Sir.<eos> Can you help me?<eos> There's nothing I can say that will make a difference.<eos> Your sergeant needs to speak for you.<eos> He said there's nothing to be done.<eos> Well, that's it, then.<eos> Why will no-one help me?<eos> Is this what they call fair treatment in the British Army?<eos> Don't do anything stupid.
Well, I'm sorry if I alarmed you.<eos> I've been alarmed since the moment you arrived.<eos> You run, you're going to get bloody shot!<eos> They'll shoot me anyway!<eos> I've got to use what I've got, and this is what I've got.<eos> Are you blackmailing me?<eos> Someone has connections on high.<eos> You took what was mine and you let me be shamed!<eos> If she told me the truth, I could have done something.<eos> But she didn't.
Number 11, prostitution.<eos> Nix that one.<eos> My thrill drill is out of juice.<eos> You got to be kidding me!<eos> - Number 12, sperm bank.<eos> - See number 11.<eos> Some sheik named "Fahid Ahmed Habib"<eos> or whatever, is getting a brand-new set of lungs. - Government flew him in.<eos> - We get the newspaper?<eos> Sheila does.
They're always like, "Boys are stupid" and they act like they hate them.<eos> - But I never feel that way.<eos> - How do you feel?<eos> This is weird.<eos> Like I want to protect him.<eos> - Is that weird?<eos> - No, honey. I also feel sick and dizzy.<eos> That's how everyone gets when they're falling in love.<eos> But I thought it was supposed to feel good.<eos> It does sometimes.
I have the cash with me.<eos> On you, in this neighborhood?<eos> Have we got a deal?<eos> You hungry?<eos> I'm gonna go get us something to eat.<eos> So your father just offered me ten grand to stay away from you.<eos> Amanda, you know we love you.<eos> - Did you take the money?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - That you did.
- The fuck is this?<eos> - You guys hungry?<eos> - That a yes? - The fuck are you doing with him?<eos> - Having lunch.<eos> - With this piece of shit?<eos> - You wanted him dead yesterday.<eos> - Don't be dramatic. Mandy, he hit you. In the face.<eos> - No, he didn't.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> No, he didn't.
It is the two loving people who stand, and lie, before us.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Last time I was here, I thought I was so different from everyone else waiting.<eos> Now I fit right in.<eos> I know you have to study.<eos> I'll call you when I know what's happening.<eos> I can study here.<eos> Sheila, do you promise to love and cherish Frank in sickness and...<eos> I guess just in sickness, till death do you part?<eos> I do.
- Yeah.<eos> And how much will it improve your vision?<eos> Well, with the new laser technique, he says up to 50%.<eos> - Wow. It's gonna change your life.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So three tours in Afghanistan, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wow. I did a double.<eos> We lost a lot of good men over there.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Over 2,000... .. and needs to be seen to be believed.<eos> When there's no more... .. balls.<eos> A few new tricks from fellow perf...<eos> 'Tixy, I feel like my mind has been poisoned by beauty.<eos> 'I was so annoyed at myself.<eos> I had the perfect chance 'to throw a pint of sex in his face, and I blew it. '<eos> All right, fatty?<eos> Er, where have you two been?<eos> We've just been out having fun, like young couples do, you know.<eos> No, I don't.
I don't think many people look perfect.<eos> Isabelle?<eos> 'Thank God for Izzy.<eos> 'Thank God that someone else felt the way I did.<eos> 'That someone else wasn't... '<eos> Perfect.<eos> So what d'you think has changed?<eos> Why d'you think you're happy?<eos> You told me to start liking myself.<eos> And do you?
An Xbox. We got cable.<eos> We got pretty much everything we have at ho--at the house.<eos> Check it out.<eos> I got a couple of games we could try out this weekend.<eos> Cool.<eos> Syd. Here's that rainbow loom you have at home.<eos> I thought we could, uh, you know, go rainbow... Bracelet crazy this weekend.<eos> I don't play with that anymore.<eos> I'm ten now.<eos> You don't?
What does she do all d--I mean--<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - Wait.<eos> It's been a while too.<eos> Her parents don't even know.<eos> I mean, that's weird.<eos> What she's saying is that I just make her happy and she just wants to be around me and all this stuff.<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> Her to leave and go back to school, you know?<eos> I-I do, but...
I mean, God knows I still struggle, but these last two weeks, they've just been really... blurry.<eos> Do you remember going to dinner with your sponsor last night?<eos> Was that last night?<eos> Yes, you're right.<eos> It was.<eos> So, then, when did you go to the hotel and meet Justin?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Anita, we have a witness that saw you accost Justin outside of a coffee shop a couple of days ago.<eos> - Do you remember that?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Why would we do that when we were just trying to make this go away?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Someone's targeting us, someone who knew about that tape and knew they could use it against us.<eos> One of the other test subjects, someone on the crew.<eos> I'm gonna need a list of all of the people that knew about that video.<eos> Be sure not to step any further downstage, or the backdrop will smack you in the head when it flies in.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Detective Beckett.<eos> Do you have news about Justin's case?<eos> We do.
Ballsy. Yeah. Ballsy.<eos> It is, yes, but that's not the interesting thing about it.<eos> What is the interesting thing?<eos> Well, it costs £47,000, but when you get in it, everything feels just feels a bit cheap and plasticky.<eos> Look at this handbrake, it's just...<eos> It's like something that came out of a cracker.<eos> You know, if I got the handbrake in a Christmas cracker,<eos> I'd be a bit disappointed.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yes, I do.
This machine was designed, engineered, tested, proved and got on the ground in large numbers in just over three years.<eos> Try doing that with a small hatchback or something.<eos> 'Alongside the Foxhound... '..the military drew on a policy 'called Urgent Operational Requirement or UOR, 'which saw them combine operational demands 'and the best vehicle-related suggestions from soldiers on the ground.'<eos> Here's a very simple example of UOR - this is a Mastiff.<eos> It's got cameras mounted on the sides.<eos> Commander Buzz here can look at the pictures on his screen.<eos> On the early ones, they were originally mounted.<eos> When you went through things like villages, they got smashed.<eos> So somebody said, "Why not put them on a hinge?"<eos> So they did.
You're safe. You're safe.<eos> Go to friar tuck.<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's gone.<eos> Was anyone hurt?<eos> Luckily, no.<eos> Again, I must apologize.<eos> You trusted me, and I let you down.<eos> No, you didn't.
I can help with half of that. What?<eos> She's planning on going back...<eos> Back in time.<eos> Are you certain?<eos> No one's ever been able to cast a spell to go back in time.<eos> Well, clearly, she thinks she can succeed.<eos> I mean, brains, courage, a-a resilient heart...<eos> Those ingredients are in every time-travel spell I've found.<eos> Why go back in time, I mean, we have no idea what she's trying to accomplish.<eos> I do.
Both?<eos> You see, when Rumple saw that Neal was dying, he... absorbed him.<eos> And, uh, Zelena got ahold of the dagger.<eos> Now she controls Rumple.<eos> Maybe now isn't the time to announce the pregnancy.<eos> Regina is right. It's too dangerous.<eos> No, if... if we don't, we give in to fear.<eos> But if we do, we give the kingdom what they need... hope.<eos> We don't even know what this wicked witch wants.<eos> Actually, we do.
They're coming after me regardless of the evidence.<eos> David insists I need a doberman.<eos> Will you be my doberman, Mr. Daniels?<eos> I'm not cheap.<eos> I require a million-dollar retainer and a two-million-dollar advance when we go to trial.<eos> I don't bill by the hour.<eos> I've already instructed David to take care of it.<eos> If I take your case, I have three ironclad rules...<eos> One, do not tell me whether or not you killed this woman.<eos> I didn't.
Automatic send...<eos> On Android, anyway.<eos> And it's trackable on the phone?<eos> Apps can be uninstalled remotely from a browser.<eos> There would be a download history, but if you delete the app in your account and sync, you've wiped it.<eos> Permanently?<eos> If you know how.<eos> And this guy definitely knows how.<eos> At least you have a scenario.<eos> I do.
- Gibbs, right.<eos> She, um... She loves you, so, uh...<eos> Get the DNA from her, all right?<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Scope out that dojo that, uh, Gunn told you about, too,<eos> - and have Navarro...<eos> - Hey, hey.<eos> What?<eos> How you doing?
Mm-hmm.<eos> That's correct.<eos> How can you be sure it wasn't 25 minutes or 32 minutes?<eos> Because for this analysis, I look at one simple question.<eos> How long could seminal fluid have remained detectable without being washed away by the natural process of saliva glands?<eos> The answer tells us that Mr. Blunt had oral sex with Cindy Strauss no more than 15 minutes before she died.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> Nothing further, your honor.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?
And I swear we were really good.<eos> Well, Arnold, unfortunately for you, the music has stopped.<eos> Angela, I need to talk to you.<eos> Your dad reached out, tried to make things right.<eos> I feel bad about what happened to him.<eos> So, as a favor to your father, or even as a favor to me, you got to stop the hustle.<eos> You got to ease out of the street life.<eos> And do it now while you're still young, because... it doesn't end pretty.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> I do.
Are you kidding me?<eos> Dart guns.<eos> Couldn't hurt a...<eos> Whoa, hey! Watch the face there, buddy.<eos> Did you see that shot?<eos> What'd you bring presents for?<eos> They're busted!<eos> We have to meet with the principal in the morning.<eos> You didn't get my message?<eos> I did.
The lorry that just left your depot is being tailed by cops.<eos> - We'll stop him after the tunnel.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I can't see anyone.<eos> - There are no cops.<eos> - They're in an unmarked car.<eos> Lose them and deliver the goods.<eos> - How am I supposed to do that?<eos> - That's your problem.<eos> Just do it.
Now who would do that?<eos> - What do we do now?<eos> - Well, no one knows I'm here, and I'm sure that the boys have learned their lesson.<eos> So, why don't you just sign the lease and I'll fill in the rest?<eos> Three, two.<eos> Gosh, I just...<eos> I don't understand why Carol would stick me with such a dog of a listing.<eos> Oh, wait a minute.<eos> I know what's going on here?<eos> - You do?
You're now on the wrong side of history, Jim Kent.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> You and your wife could still be part of a glorious new order.<eos> But make the wrong decision here and you condemn Sylvia to a painful and lingering death.<eos> I'll ask you one more time.<eos> Where's the Jew?<eos> Christ, I have no idea.<eos> I could drink you right here.<eos> Turn you...<eos> If you do anything...
Nicholas M. Tartullo, or some variation of that name, appears as a witness in all of Rix's cases.<eos> Here, it's Nick Tullo.<eos> There, it's M. Tartullo.<eos> In another one, it's Nicky Tull.<eos> There's no way one guy witnessed all these crimes.<eos> It's obviously a phony eyewitness giving bogus statements.<eos> Rix is cooking his cases.<eos> Guy's got brass ones... I'll give him that. He's barely even changing the name.<eos> I know, and the system's so big, no one ever caught it.<eos> Linda did.
She's a young girl who's been terribly abused, threatened, afraid for her life, obviously in need of comfort and support, and when she told Kate and Donnie that she wanted to be left alone...<eos> We left her alone.<eos> Kayla?<eos> It's Dr. Pierce.<eos> I work with A.U.S.A. Ryan and Agent Moretti.<eos> I-I-I saw you testify in court today.<eos> I told you all to leave me alone.<eos> I know, but I... I can't do that.<eos> I read the files, Kayla, and I-I think you were extremely brave when you told the truth about what Cyrus did to you.<eos> He didn't do nothing bad, okay?
- You wouldn't know.<eos> Why am I asking you?<eos> You wouldn't have a clue.<eos> Well... and I'm just positing this... perhaps you're boring.<eos> Boring? You're calling me boring?<eos> We need to talk about guy code. There's certain things you don't do...<eos> Hey, I need you to help me check out a possible homicide.<eos> Sure.<eos> When did the call come in?<eos> It didn't.
Nick, I saw what I saw, man.<eos> There is no mistaking that.<eos> I'll kill all of you!<eos> I don't think she knows what you're talking about.<eos> Listen to me. Hey! Listen to me.<eos> You're a Grimm?<eos> So am I.<eos> You've heard that before?<eos> - It doesn't mean anything.<eos> - Yes, it does.
Because his parents must have done it.<eos> They couldn't bear to watch, so they put him out of his misery.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Gone. When?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I hope she goes straight to the cops and they fry your ass.<eos> She'll be dead soon.<eos> And so will you.<eos> Well, why don't you go ahead and kill me, then?<eos> Why don't you just do it!
It's just dinner.<eos> I doubt dinner is ever just dinner with you.<eos> Now you're paranoid.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Can't I buy you dinner?<eos> Does it sound that crazy?<eos> Uh, yeah, it does.<eos> I'll call you if I got anything.<eos> Hey, mom.<eos> How you doing?
Hello?<eos> Don't be so hard on Carrie.<eos> You know Joe threatened her.<eos> That's why she lied to you.<eos> You're defending her? Her?<eos> No.<eos> I'm just saying she's been through a lot.<eos> We all have, and one day, all of this is gonna be over, and you're gonna have a life.<eos> You think so?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
What are you saying, Ava?<eos> There's things I got to do in here in order to survive.<eos> And the less you got to do with them, the better.<eos> Boyd, I'm saying goodbye.<eos> Ah... - I don't want you coming back.<eos> - Ava.<eos> Ava. Woman.<eos> Do you know what I've done for you?<eos> Do you have any idea what I have had to do for you?<eos> I do.
It is senile.<eos> I do not remember much.<eos> It is old and senile.<eos> I took my leave from work to take care of him.<eos> When you have visitors, does not recognize them.<eos> Not even remember your family.<eos> Now, I take care of him.<eos> Now, I have to go.<eos> Goodbye, sir.<eos> Lembras-te do Ramli?
He wanted to hurt both of us.<eos> And I wanted to hurt him, too.<eos> I was so angry.<eos> And a part of me...<eos> I think in that moment a part of me just wanted him to die.<eos> Well, I don't blame you.<eos> I guess we'll see if other people feel the same way.<eos> They will.<eos> They have to.<eos> The things that he did to you, Danny.
I'm fine, honey.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It's all over, isn't it?<eos> You should be so proud of yourself.<eos> - I know I am.<eos> - Vikram's still out there.<eos> Cut yourself a break.<eos> You caught Regina's killer today.<eos> Marilyn didn't act alone.<eos> - Maybe she did.
Fuckin' leave it out, will ya.<eos> How's your brother?<eos> He'll be alright, luv.<eos> Yeah, I know he'll be alright.<eos> Are you coming to bed?<eos> No. I'm going to head back to the gaf.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I have to clear my head.<eos> He didn't even want to do it.<eos> He didn't.
Aran.<eos> I know Ma.<eos> I won't happen again.<eos> Aran.<eos> Please Ma. Not the lecture.<eos> You know I do my best for you, don't you.<eos> With what I've got.<eos> Your granda was an alcoholic.<eos> I know.<eos> No, you don't.
If anyone asks, you can just say my niece.<eos> Wait here.<eos> He wants you to follow him and have a chat. Where?<eos> Back there.<eos> There must be a room.<eos> What are you sorry for?<eos> I didn't want it to happen.<eos> No?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.. Alright.
I know. What can you do?<eos> It's nothing to do with me Trish.<eos> I feel fuckin' terrible.<eos> I wasn't gonna say cos it doesn't say it's me but I didn't want you to read it and work it out yourself.<eos> I have to go pick up the kids.<eos> Will I see you later?<eos> I've a few things to do but I'll be back after.<eos> Thanks babe.<eos> What, do you not believe me?<eos> No, I do.
Your mother had a pretty close call with that shrill bomb last week.<eos> You know, I've been hearing some whispers about this Castithan guy named, uh, Skevur, is it?<eos> You wouldn't know anything about this, uh, Skevur, looking for some payback, would you?<eos> Drug thing maybe?<eos> Just gossip.<eos> 'Cause you're a father now, and you have responsibilities.<eos> I know.<eos> Shortly after your wedding, I had some of my miners kick your ass.<eos> You remember that and what I said?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Nope.<eos> Not in the least bit curious?<eos> Fine.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm dying.<eos> A little jumpy, huh?<eos> My nerves are shot.<eos> Ah, I understand.<eos> You have no idea what I'm going through.<eos> Oh. Of course I do.
Why?<eos> I'm dying.<eos> A little jumpy, huh?<eos> My nerves are shot.<eos> Ah, I understand.<eos> You have no idea what I'm going through.<eos> Oh. Of course I do.<eos> It's your sister.<eos> No, this has nothing to do with Kenya.<eos> Ah, yeah, it does.
Don't do that again.<eos> - I deserve to die.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Stop talking like that.<eos> Anyway, you didn't.<eos> Irzu won't let me die.<eos> Would you stop that?<eos> This thing inside you, it doesn't come from Irzu or any other kind of god.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I do, okay?
- be a crime?<eos> - In this case, it should be.<eos> I'll research it back at my office.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So now...<eos> - what can I do for you?<eos> - I came to warn you.<eos> Michel told me about Sebastian Berger.<eos> - He wants him prosecuted.<eos> - No, he does not.
You need to tell me how to delete this upload.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Because Stefan might hurt himself.<eos> Well, I hope he does.<eos> You hope he does?<eos> Anka, you've caused a lot of people to hurt themselves.<eos> Not a lot.<eos> Four.<eos> Do you know who they are?<eos> What they did?
Oh, fake-out!<eos> Oh, no, you don't!<eos> And why would you wanna go out with someone who wants to go out with me?<eos> She doesn't wanna go out with you, she wants to go out with me.<eos> Okay?<eos> So this is what's gonna happen.<eos> You're gonna go out with Sydney and you're gonna be the biggest jerk who ever lived.<eos> But I don't even know how to be a jerk.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I do.
Look, I know I said we should be friends and that it doesn't bother me to think of you with other women, but it does.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - I'm saying that every time I think of you and Heather together, I think, "that shouldn't be her.<eos> That should be me."<eos> Ben, I'm still in love with you.<eos> Okay, well, you kids have a great night.<eos> His son? !<eos> Oh my God.<eos> I mean, I knew I had a type, but wow!<eos> - What do I do now?
- Single?<eos> Why would you tell him that you're single?<eos> You just told me that you loved me.<eos> Yeah, that's just something I say to people, you know?<eos> Hey, I love you!<eos> I love you, too!<eos> Bonnie, what is going on?<eos> I thought we had something special.<eos> Yeah, Brad, we... we do.<eos> We did.
Now look what you've done!<eos> After you, ladies.<eos> Oh-ho-ho! Maybe this whole college thing isn't the worst idea after all.<eos> It has its perks, but I'm afraid you're a little late and I have to leave for a meeting.<eos> Oh, am I?<eos> Do you?<eos> Darn it!<eos> Well, I guess I'll just take off then.<eos> But don't forget to tell Riley that I came by...<eos> Because I did.
Won't know for a few days, he said.<eos> I can't stay.<eos> Got a meeting.<eos> You weren't crazy, Ted.<eos> When you were suspicious...<eos> When you were angry at me for spending time with him, you weren't crazy.<eos> Not that anything happened.<eos> It didn't, but...<eos> Like I told you, I thought that-- that God wanted to use me to save him.<eos> And maybe he did.
We got your M.R.I. back.<eos> There's some sludge in your bile duct.<eos> But, uh, the good news is, it's not completely obstructed.<eos> However, there is some bad news.<eos> Hi! Hi!<eos> That's so great.<eos> Wow, the nurses gave you some pain meds, huh?<eos> Pfft, yeah.<eos> I have a button.<eos> Yes, you do.
What do you think that means?<eos> God, you are relentless.<eos> A year ago, would you have imagined yourself here?<eos> Well, a year ago, I was in a coma, so... no.<eos> Before that.<eos> No.<eos> Nope, I used to be with the woman I love.<eos> And I used to be just a regular doctor who didn't see... dead people.<eos> I thought you said that stopped.<eos> It did.
Well, I didn't order a pizza.<eos> Sorry to bother you, Hawley.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm just cleaning up my latest acquisition.<eos> The Serpent's Tears.<eos> Only six of these guys known to exist.<eos> Pure silver dipped in holy water blessed by the Archdiocese of Halifax on All Saints' Day.<eos> It's like I told you at the library... forewarned is forearmed.<eos> You also said that if we had a problem, you would help us.<eos> I did.
A newspaper, Wade.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Without the Belles, this Toast and Roast is toast.<eos> If they're putting on their own show, who's gonna want to watch us?<eos> I don't even know what we're doing here.<eos> I got 19 episodes of Chicago Fire burning up my DVR.<eos> We all done crying in our soup?<eos> Oh, come on, Lavon, you got to admit, things are looking mighty bleak.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Harley fell off the jungle gym.<eos> But he's okay. He just needed some stitches.<eos> Geez Louise, poor kid.<eos> Uh, you know, I should... I should call Viv.<eos> You know what?<eos> They're... They're probably exhausted.<eos> Right. Yeah, yeah.<eos> Hey, uh, did you...<eos> did you have a chance to put in a word for me?<eos> - I didn't.
I think that there's no trace left of the man I fell in love with.<eos> I will never forget what I did to those people.<eos> I know what it's like, to see the wolf take you over.<eos> No, the eclipse, that was different.<eos> I couldn't control myself.<eos> No, you couldn't.<eos> Tell me, please, do I hurt someone?<eos> Do I hurt... Do I hurt Nora?<eos> I told you, not until it's time.<eos> So what do I do?
Why didn't you wake me?<eos> I did.
Three, two, one.<eos> There you go.<eos> Hi, James.<eos> How are you?<eos> Hey, Beth.<eos> - Hi, Lana.<eos> - Hey, is Danny okay?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - He didn't come in this morning.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Yelling at him isn't gonna change a thing.<eos> Oh, so you'll just let him walk all over you?<eos> Maybe we should do this another time.<eos> So, I'm gonna get a scout to the game tomorrow to check out Sharee.<eos> Oh, that's awesome.<eos> She has so much raw talent.<eos> I just really want her to get the chance she deserves.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
If it makes other people uncomfortable, that's their problem.<eos> - I wish I could be more like that.<eos> - You can.<eos> So your book bombs?<eos> Big deal!<eos> You tried something!<eos> Unless you want to climb back on that safe little boat<eos> - I found you on.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't.
I'm not gonna walk around with no clothes.<eos> No, I don't want you to chaperone.<eos> And so it doesn't make sense for your bag to go if you're not going.<eos> Wait. What--honey, I'm--<eos> - I wish I was still friends with Micah.<eos> He gets to take an extra bag because of his wheelchair.<eos> Okay, can you stop for a second?<eos> Why don't you want me to chaperone?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just don't.
Cameron.<eos> Okay? Cameron?<eos> No.<eos> No that's not me.<eos> Kiera Cameron.<eos> The service was beautiful.<eos> Yes it was.<eos> Betty paid the heaviest price for her convictions.<eos> I know what you want to do but you don't need to go in there right now.<eos> Yeah, I do.
He has a claim.<eos> You did sign a non-compete.<eos> If this goes to court we will likely lose.<eos> Add that to a restive board.<eos> They gave me two months.<eos> I'm trying to fix Halo.<eos> Money and patience take away at the same rate.<eos> The stock price wobbles and the boy genius CEO headlines all but disappear.<eos> The problem is no one really understands your vision.<eos> Oh I do.
Oh, I'm not implying anything, ma'am.<eos> I'm stating.<eos> Well, that's all done with.<eos> That case was sewn up tight.<eos> Got a sworn affidavit it was an FBI turncoat.<eos> That's right. It's yesterday's news.<eos> This is today.<eos> My phone.<eos> Jimmy. You got those last six keys?<eos> I do.
- Hi.<eos> How are you?<eos> Order of the Coif at BOLT,<eos> Rhodes Scholar, clerk for Chief Justice Roberts, member of the Olympic badminton team.<eos> Is that even a thing?<eos> On top of that, he's got connections.<eos> He's gonna bring new business in the door.<eos> Trust me, he's the future of the firm.<eos> (Ben) Sir, nice to meet you.<eos> How you doing?
Can I play?<eos> Well, it's called solitaire, so...<eos> Oh. Hold the phone.<eos> You are in luck.<eos> I happen to have a coupon for an afternoon of go fish with yours truly.<eos> All right, uh, do you have any 9s? Any 9s?<eos> You're next.<eos> Ohh! That's easy!<eos> Do you have any kings?<eos> Yes, I do.
I also think that if they thought that Johnny was worth two of our guys, then two of our guys is worth ten of their guys or maybe twelve.<eos> Or however many I can get in one place at one time.<eos> And that right there, that's very important too.<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll figure it out.<eos> Zane took over for Gil, for what, a little less than a week now?<eos> Here we are... burying Tony and Paco.<eos> How do you like those odds?<eos> I don't, Remo.
I mean, how often do you think about Claire?<eos> Good, because I miss her, Ryan.<eos> I really do. She will always be my one real regret.<eos> Well, I should be off.<eos> Feel like we should hug or something.<eos> Well, enjoy the spectacle, and I hope you find it worthy.<eos> God forbid, you should write another book.<eos> We've got vehicles at the front gate.<eos> We have to go now. North gate is clear, but we need to leave.<eos> What do I do with you?
"Come on!"<eos> "This is a crooked world, it doesn't listen to anyone." "Everyone does what they please."<eos> "Relationships survive only on money."<eos> "This vehicle runs on a mixture of water and petrol."<eos> "A clean body and a dirty mind." "They have weird dreams."<eos> "This world always keeps messing around."<eos> "Then they chant, hail Goddess Ganga."<eos> "This world always keeps messing around."<eos> "Then they chant, hail Goddess Ganga."<eos> "They all do bad deeds."
How do you go about your day without falling apart?<eos> Tell me what you're doing to get through this, because I'm clearly doing it wrong.<eos> There's no right or wrong way, Elena.<eos> No, there's only forever.<eos> That's why I need you to give me hope.<eos> Because I don't think I can live forever without him.<eos> I can't.<eos> I gave up.<eos> You just said that you were looking for him.<eos> I did.
Good thing your doctors didn't give you a choice, then.<eos> You know, you could try to hide the fact that you're glad I can't get out in the field anymore.<eos> I can't hide that I'm glad that you're safe.<eos> What's all this?<eos> Your surprise.<eos> Uh, thank you all--ahem, excuse me, thank you for coming.<eos> Five months ago, this city was under siege.<eos> And the SCPD rallied behind a man in a hood.<eos> Well, I ended up with a captain's rank, and he didn't even get a thank you.<eos> But today, he does.
Yeah, I didn't think it was the best idea to stick around and answer questions.<eos> You don't think you and an explosion at the same place is a coincidence?<eos> Hey, check this out.<eos> It's a GPS.<eos> I found it on your jacket.<eos> It's wasted now.<eos> You took out one of Steelgraves' crew earlier tonight.<eos> It was a set up so they could plant that thing on me.<eos> Oliver, I know what you're thinking.<eos> No, you don't.
- Trying to find the child we care for.<eos> - Quickly, now, secure Lord Voland and his family.<eos> You've made things very difficult.<eos> A noble fell ill in the gallery.<eos> It caused a minor panic.<eos> It sent Pierre Voland and his family scurrying to their private quarters.<eos> Now he's locked in there with his entire household.<eos> I don't see how you could get to him without killing the others as witnesses.<eos> Did you not receive my message?<eos> I did.
It's not like I haven't been thinking about it nonstop.<eos> I have.<eos> Makes me sick.<eos> I feel like I'm gonna throw up, but...<eos> I... I didn't take anything.<eos> I wouldn't do that, and I didn't hurt anybody.<eos> I know the difference between right and wrong.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I don't know, Henry.<eos> But I do!
Hey, this whole thing was your idea.<eos> Living together, trying to be human was your idea!<eos> Ok, you don't wanna do it, I will. Hey!<eos> Let him suffer.<eos> The eye thing was a perfect touch.<eos> So you got to see the world.<eos> You got to indulge in a totally alternative lifestyle, right?<eos> But there's no place like home.<eos> I need a drink.<eos> Of course, you do.
- But mine's bigger.<eos> Boys, boys!<eos> Penises down.<eos> You need Josh, you psycho.<eos> You need his blood.<eos> Nora?<eos> Hi, I just saw you, and I thought...<eos> I wanted to say hi.<eos> - Didn't you move away from Boston? - Yeah, I did.<eos> I did.
Sally, don't... - Sally!<eos> - Josh... Hey, pal, I just wanna talk. - Aidan!<eos> - Oh my god!<eos> That was your plan?<eos> What did-- did you kill him?<eos> - Can guys get him on the bed?<eos> Come on!<eos> - Oh my...<eos> Sally, what are you doing?<eos> Sally, what did you do?
- And it's a good heartbeat!<eos> This is a good thing, isn't it?<eos> I'm just gonna give you guys a minute!<eos> - This is why I didn't know how to tell you.<eos> - How are you feeling?<eos> Are you ok?<eos> - I am.<eos> I wasn't sure this was what I wanted, After everything.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - But I do.
Well, if Berman knew he had incriminated himself on tape...<eos> He'd go to any lengths to get it back.<eos> Victoria, this investigation is ongoing, and exposing it to Mr. Berman or anyone at JP Harding would break federal statutes.<eos> But I thought that this was something that you and your team needed to know.<eos> I'd certainly say so.<eos> So, I trust that you will keep my office in the loop if there are any significant developments.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Of course.<eos> Sir, I didn't... I didn't know you had a sister.<eos> Oh, well, now you do.
I've got the black cable.<eos> Myka!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I mean, is everything all right down...<eos> We are not talking about that, okay?<eos> What the hell are you guys still doing out here?<eos> Am I really the only one that reads the Regent's Addendums to the manual?<eos> Okay, look, we know that the shield draws its power from the Alpha Centauri Star System.<eos> - I knew that.<eos> - No, he didn't.

That's the first artifact that almost killed me.<eos> And now there are four of 'em.<eos> He's replicating artifacts, artifacts that create unstoppable soldiers.<eos> Very good, gentlemen.<eos> Holy crap, it's Valda.<eos> You can feel my commands without my having to voice them.<eos> Excellent.<eos> What is Benedict Valda doing here?<eos> He died in Egypt in a pit of fire.<eos> Not in this reality he didn't.
Get him ready for examination.<eos> Bitch. Bitch...<eos> Was it the noise?<eos> Do you want to come with me?<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Yes?<eos> Ah. Do come in, Prentiss.<eos> Why does it help?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But it does.
I am.<eos> I just look very young for my age. I always have.<eos> Even when I was a baby I looked young for my age.<eos> You're wearing scent.<eos> I'm not, Matron.<eos> It's just rose-water.<eos> Were you not taught the rules concerning conduct and deportment?<eos> Yes, Matron, of course.<eos> But you don't think they apply to you?<eos> No, Matron, of course they do.

Just get better and come home and we will be waiting because you are not nothing.<eos> You are everything to us.<eos> See you in England, darling.<eos> I have to go now.<eos> So you be a good boy for your dad, Georgie.<eos> You be a good boy.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Rosalie, do you trust me?<eos> You need to trust me.<eos> Of course I do.
I'll understand if you're not, but I'll be there.<eos> He was born with a cord around his neck.<eos> He shouldn't be on his own.<eos> He's a lamb.<eos> I should never have left him.<eos> Why did you?<eos> Is it because people found out what you are?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Is it because you're a girl that you think everyone wants their life laid out?<eos> They don't.
What?<eos> Look here Amidral, the enemy fleets have already exceeded 200,<eos> Are you aware of the fact that many of our soldiers are running away already?<eos> - Captain Kim Eok-Choo- In the last ten days, about 50 soldiers have run away already...<eos> I must ask you today, Admiral...<eos> We have no idea when this enemy would show up at our doorstep, and that could be tonight.<eos> So I'm curious, how do you propose to fight against such enemies?<eos> Let's heart it from our young officers!<eos> Do we stand a chance?<eos> Do we?
Well it will be very helpful to our investigation to know exactly what's been removed.<eos> I checked the records as soon as we knew about the robbery.<eos> That particular box was empty.<eos> As I mentioned, we have more than a few.<eos> You do know that impeding a police investigation is a very serious offense.<eos> And you know that as a Fortune500 company, we have a full complement of lawyers that can back-up my truthful and helpful statement.<eos> But why go there.<eos> Liber8 is behind this robbery Mr. Richardson.<eos> You don't want them having anything of yours.<eos> And they don't.
You are a rigid thinker.<eos> That's why I'm gonna end up ruling the world.<eos> All the big-time rich guys -- Steve Jobs... other guys -- they're all creative thinkers, risk-takers.<eos> I don't know about this, Axl.<eos> Wha-- look, that's fine.<eos> Go ahead. Dress like one of the characters in the book and do a lame presentation like a million other kids.<eos> What do you want, Brick?<eos> Do you want to go the safe route, or do you want to be an innovator, a trailblazer, a rule breaker?<eos> !<eos> I do.
Oh, hey. So, this is where the Heck laundry goes down, huh?<eos> Yep, this is where the magic happens.<eos> I've seen the clean clothes, but you never get to see behind the scenes.<eos> [ Laughs ] Very few have had the privilege.<eos> [ Clears throat ] So, listen, I was thinking, you know, sometimes people don't always have dates to the prom. [ Chuckles ]<eos> And I don't know if you do or you don't, but if you don't and you want to go, I'm around, so I could take you if you want.<eos> Are you kidding me right now?<eos> ! No, uh, but if you don't want to --<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no. I do, I do, I do.

The weapons-maker owns Channel #1?<eos> Diana Bolton ran a huge expose on Fermitas a couple years ago.<eos> Fermitas announced an intention to sue, then dropped the suit.<eos> People figured it was because it wasn't winnable, but really...<eos> If you can't muzzle the press, you buy them.<eos> Private acquisition.<eos> Private acquisition?<eos> So nobody knows?<eos> Lucas might have found out.<eos> Did he?
Was there anything useful on that flash drive I got for you?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's official... the Department of Humanity now has complete control and authority over the lottery winners and embryos.<eos> I have complete confidence and faith in your ability to do the right thing here, Darius.<eos> Thank you, Mr. President. I'll... try to do my best.<eos> What's the best way to handle this?<eos> Handle what?<eos> The lottery winners.<eos> How do we tell them that they're not going home... that they're gonna be sequestered in a facility in South Carolina for the next two years and that their babies will be the property of the United States government?<eos> We don't.

She was sleeping.<eos> No. She wasn't.<eos> I saw her.<eos> She was on medication.<eos> I saw the pills.<eos> That's what she does.<eos> She has a problem.<eos> I don't need to tell you what the stakes are here.<eos> That's right, Alan.<eos> You don't.

There were also some issues with quality.<eos> The lights filled with condensation, the rear brakes didn't seem to be working properly, then the clutch went.<eos> So the car had to go back to Denmark.<eos> After a couple of weeks, however, it was mended, so the Zenvo came back.<eos> But almost immediately... a cooling fan went wrong.<eos> Fire, fire, fire!<eos> Copy that.<eos> So the car became even more orange.<eos> And that was the end of that.<eos> That didn't do very well.
We need to look at another time for a wet lap.<eos> There you go.<eos> It's slower than a German saloon car.<eos> It is!<eos> You know this is Danish and it s orange and it's genetically flawed?<eos> I'm surprised they haven't called The Giraffe... ..and shot it.<eos> He said that out loud, didn't he? He did.<eos> He said it out loud.<eos> Never mind, let's move on with the news and, well, my big news this week, certainly is I spent last weekend driving the new Porsche 980.<eos> Oh, you did!
Learning about Muslim culture. It's really neat.<eos> Like, do you know Muslims have seven levels of Heaven?<eos> We only have one!<eos> And each level is like a Sandals Resort, but better.<eos> Shiri, find the nearest mental ward.<eos> Why can't she wear her scarf?<eos> Have I taught you nothing?<eos> Take this down.<eos> "You're not being a good friend when you don't tell someone they look ridiculous"...<eos> Which you do.
I see.<eos> I guess we're seeing the limits of our partnership.<eos> You have a visitor.<eos> How do you know him?<eos> There was an incident, approximately 11 weeks ago, several unexplained temporal signatures.<eos> So it seems we both have something to investigate.<eos> I'm going to get back to mine.<eos> My personal life is off limits.<eos> I promise you, you don't want to do this.<eos> Oh, but I kinda do.
I was only trying to protect you.<eos> Okay? I promise.<eos> Well, what about me?<eos> Am I a freak too?<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry to have to do that, Stephen. But the time for secrets is past.<eos> Everyone you love needs to know the stakes.<eos> Listen to me, the Founder cannot be trust...<eos> I don't want to hurt you, son.<eos> I did it for your own good. Stephen!
We're done talking.<eos> Let's see who passes out first.<eos> Stay the hell out of my life or I will find a way to kill you.<eos> - So what was that about?<eos> - What?<eos> I was trying to save a breakout.<eos> At the expense of Stephen's cover?<eos> Well, it doesn't matter now since the Founder is ushering in a kinder, gentler Ultra.<eos> - But you don't believe that.<eos> - Stephen does.
He will listen to you.<eos> If what you're saying is true, if Roger put himself into limbo to stop the Founder, you say bringing him back doesn't play straight into his plans?<eos> It's a risk we're going to have to take.<eos> You expect... you expect me to convince Stephen of that?<eos> You or Cara.<eos> I understand she has quite a sway over the boy.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> I knew I could count on you, kid.<eos> Hey. How'd you find him?<eos> I didn't, uh, the lady from your office did.
Scully, I want you to do nothing.<eos> Just stand next to me and say, "yes, sarge."<eos> Okay, sarge.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> All right, focus up.<eos> We got 18 minutes, 41 seconds to break this record.<eos> No screwing around.<eos> Whoa, you're really not gonna do a character?<eos> What about Rex "Bookinghame"?<eos> Okay, never, ever do an accent again.
Yeah, see, that's the super cool thing about this website is it does all the work for us so we can just sit back and take it easy.<eos> No.<eos> No, we're not gonna do that.<eos> We're gonna sit forward and take it hard.<eos> - There's a lot of nitty-gritty left to do, Ben.<eos> We need to roll up our sleeves, we need to go door to door, we need to hand out fliers, and canvass.<eos> You know what we should do?<eos> We should have a press junket, to publicize the poll.<eos> Okay, I hope you had lunch plans, 'cause now you get to cancel them.<eos> Well, I-I did.
There he is.<eos> Oh, oh, I see!<eos> Oh, you're all here because you heard the news!<eos> Well, fine.<eos> Peter Griffin crapped himself at work. Happy?<eos> Peter...<eos> No, no, Lois, I-I-let's get it all out.<eos> I'm sure you also heard that someone walked into my office while I was sucking on my own toes.<eos> And do I go fast-walking in nurse's shoes every Saturday in the park?<eos> Yes, I do.
"Munson"?<eos> Whoa, wait a second.<eos> The new Carrot Bill is Tommy Munson.<eos> I know.<eos> Tommy is Henry Munson's son.<eos> Look, I didn't have any problems with Joe.<eos> He was a great guy.<eos> No? No problems at all?<eos> Okay, Daddy didn't tell you that Joe wanted his job back?<eos> Yeah. Sure he did.
There you go.<eos> I'm not getting any better just laying around here.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> You just lay down, okay?<eos> ...streets flooded and blackouts across the state... in me wake of Hurricane Penny.<eos> Floridians are just beginning to assess the damage.<eos> Hurricane Penny caused mass destruction... as vicious hurricane force winds swept through homes and businesses-<eos> You know, honey, you don't have to do this.<eos> I know.<eos> Yes, I do.
A regular Sam Spade.<eos> This guy, great private dick.<eos> Rubbed elbows with the rich and powerful from all around the world.<eos> Sort of a classic Warner Brothers set deck, you know, noir atmosphere.<eos> Yeah, except it's all phony. It's fake, just like him.<eos> Would you take that hat off?<eos> When Bodeen was on his game, it was a great life.<eos> Until it all came crashing down around him.<eos> I wonder how he paid his rent.<eos> He didn't.
Called in, said he has information regarding Michael Elliot.<eos> I brought him up here.<eos> That's all right, isn't it?<eos> Commander, Special Agent Gibbs.<eos> You asked to see me? Yes, I did.<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> When I heard about Michael Elliot's murder, I thought I should contact you.<eos> How do you know him?<eos> I don't.
Linda.<eos> You coming or not...<eos> King?<eos> "Do you feel the chemistry between us?"<eos> Who says that?<eos> It's called role play.<eos> I read about it in a magazine.<eos> Thought i'd be fun.<eos> You didn't have fun?<eos> I did.
JOE: Thank you. MODERATOR:<eos> Let's get started. ROGER: Now, he spills his water!<eos> I swear, this kid is literally gonna shit himself.<eos> Joe Thornhill, you're an ex-baseball coach.<eos> People say you're way out of your league, literally.<eos> Shouldn't you get off the field? You know, ma'am...<eos> I'm just an ordinary guy and I live in the real America.<eos> I may not know much about running the country, I'll give you that.<eos> But you know what?<eos> Neither did George Washington.
Yeah, okay.<eos> It's not reassuring. (CHUCKLING) JONAH: Hey, Dan.<eos> Dan.<eos> I just want to say I'm sorry if I wasn't very sympathetic to your, you know, mental head issues.<eos> So...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Go fuck yourself, Jack and the Giant Freakstalk.<eos> Your team lost, and you should be fitted with a leper bell, you sinking shit.<eos> Yeah, okay. Boy, I do not know what I saw in you.<eos> I do.
I don't remember.<eos> In camp.<eos> You got some kind of... some kind of number tattooed here.<eos> "5-0-2-0-7."<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Grant!<eos> Easy, easy, easy, easy. No! No!<eos> I'm just cold.<eos> I didn't think you'd mind.<eos> Do you?
I don't want to lose you, Aaron, ever again.<eos> Me neither.<eos> We don't have to... you know, if you're not sure.<eos> A word, please.<eos> Not the best time.<eos> I think you'll have time for this.<eos> Doyle is sending men out by the dozen looking for Monroe.<eos> And?<eos> And they don't know where he is.<eos> I do.
Walk around the neighborhood in a fur coat with no pants...<eos> What did you expect was gonna happen?<eos> What do you want, Baxter, a paternity test?<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> Maybe later on, Muffin and I stop by your house and drop a DNA sample on your front lawn.<eos> I'm just having trouble picturing how this was possible between Muffin and Lady.<eos> Well, Muffin's a resourceful little guy, you know?<eos> Maybe he got up on the picnic table.<eos> Which I will no longer be eating off of.<eos> And maybe they, uh, did it "people style."
Even better yet, the boy breaks her heart and Eve never dates again.<eos> I'll be up in a few minutes.<eos> Yeah, I'm still full from dinner, so don't expect too much.<eos> I ate the soup, too, so you're off the hook.<eos> Oh, hey, Eve.<eos> Good night, Mom!<eos> Got a lot of homework to do!<eos> Wait! H-how was the date?<eos> Don't you want to talk about it?<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
To this day, every election when I get that little "I Voted" sticker,<eos> I got to make a beeline straight to the can.<eos> So, sweetie, how was therapy?<eos> Did you get to blame enough stuff on your poor mother?<eos> Oh, I had pages on you. That idiot wouldn't even hear any of it.<eos> Did you tell the therapist about the time Mom left us in the car to go to Oktoberfest?<eos> No, that's good.<eos> I... See, I blocked that.<eos> So, when do you go back?<eos> I don't.
Ew!<eos> Molly's turning everybody's life upside down.<eos> I mean, you saw it with Samuel.<eos> He was a bad waiter with no future, and he was happy.<eos> We were all happy.<eos> Well, I agree.<eos> I mean, without her encouragement, I doubt Samuel will ever have the guts to do the stand-up thing.<eos> See?<eos> You get it.<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
I don't know. Um, Alan hasn't told her and Jeff Strongman doesn't care.<eos> How is it that Señor Strongman has two girls and I have none?<eos> Because you're not willing to lie and treat women like crap so you can get laid.<eos> You're a romantic.<eos> You think every girl you meet is your soul mate.<eos> You're ready to move in after the first date.<eos> We have a term for guys like you in the Lesbian community.<eos> It's "lesbian."<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?
This, uh, park business seems to be picking up speed.<eos> Now that Rockefeller's thrown in with them, they're making real offers.<eos> - They'll be coming to us next?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Rockefeller's $5 million behind them.<eos> We're not interested.<eos> Well, I was asking your husband's opinion, Mrs. Pemberton, not yours.<eos> Easy.<eos> Well, I don't want you to worry about it.<eos> Well, I do.
Right here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The first of our dozen.<eos> - You want me to take that?<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> I got it, Mr. Vaughn.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's perfect, George.<eos> - How do you know it's a boy?<eos> - I just do.
Wait a second. What are you doing in here?<eos> This is my office. See?<eos> My calculators on the desk.<eos> No, Selina said this is gonna be my office.<eos> You don't need an office. You have a bag.<eos> Okay, that's bullying.<eos> Well, why don't you take it up with the president?<eos> Why don't you call the Chief Justice and get them both in?<eos> And so it begins.<eos> Actually, it really does.
- Human error?<eos> - Yes, simple human error.<eos> - Which human?<eos> - Several separate humans, Sean.<eos> I mean, we all make mistakes. Just ask your mom and dad. (LAUGHS)<eos> Has President Meyer spoken to the president of Iran?<eos> I'm not able to answer that.<eos> Otherwise I'd have to have you killed.<eos> MALE REPORTER: Does the president believe this is a moment for levity?<eos> No, she does not. Does not.
I'll get there.<eos> Do you know what happened to the others who left the hall, the ones who couldn't hack it?<eos> I put them in the hole.<eos> For how long?<eos> Who knows?<eos> And that's where you should be except Joe said to give you another chance.<eos> I hope you don't disappoint him, but I have a feeling you will.<eos> It really bothers you that Joe thinks<eos> I'm special, that he cares about me, doesn't it? No.<eos> Actually, it doesn't.
We've seen one or two of 'em.<eos> That's what those sons of bitches did to me...<eos> That and a lot more.<eos> Look, I know I got nothing here, nothing but burned bridges.<eos> And I know there's no reason for you to take me, but I'm asking.<eos> And I can help.<eos> I need payback.<eos> And how do we know this isn't a trick?<eos> How do we know you're not zombified right now?<eos> You don't.
I swear nothing happened between us.<eos> My God, what is wrong with you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know what's happening.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> This girl who accused him.<eos> What happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You do.
You're right, as usual. Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> - Where's my father? - I don't know.<eos> Your guys took him.<eos> Where'd you put him? - I don't know, and I don't give a shit.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Aah!<eos> Where is he, Frank?<eos> You think Cochran tells me anything?<eos> He doesn't.
I don't understand.<eos> Do you think something's wrong?<eos> I don't want to get it. I don't want to talk.<eos> What if something's wrong?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God. What if grandpa died?<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Stop. Don't laugh! I'm serious!<eos> He's fine. He's fine.<eos> What if he did?
What?<eos> Do you want me to use my mouth?<eos> - No.<eos> - What? What's wrong?<eos> I've -<eos> - I'm... I'm just too upset.<eos> And I've had too much to drink.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Well, Clark, you don't have to leave.<eos> Yes, I do.
Those bastards used you<eos> What are you on about? You shot the video<eos> Did you get a hard-on while shooting it?<eos> Huh?<eos> No<eos> Did you jerk off at home remembering what you saw?<eos> I said no<eos> Did they let you have a go?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Did they?
We both know you're not.<eos> I don't have blood on my hands.<eos> Wait, so does Victoria pick the victims, or are you just scoring points with Mommy?<eos> You got no idea what she's been through, so stop attacking her.<eos> Or what?<eos> I'll have an accident next?<eos> You've totally changed.<eos> You don't even see it.<eos> You really think you know me, don't you?<eos> You don't.
I was ready to face them.<eos> And you.<eos> Then how about this?<eos> How about you come over to my house tomorrow, officially meet your grandson?<eos> I would like nothing more.<eos> I thought Brunello appropriate to honor the next chapter of Patrick's life.<eos> Please thank Stefano again for affording him the opportunity.<eos> You were the one that made him an offer he couldn't refuse, but...<eos> In truth, even without the money, he thinks your boy has talent.<eos> Of course he does.
So, this is just regular odd behavior?<eos> This isn't gonna cost me anything?<eos> Toll-free call, just like the Bureau of Land Management.<eos> Bureau of Land Management.<eos> Hi, and welcome to the Sutter Farms family of products.<eos> From industrial cleaning solvents to our delicious baked goods, we're there for you.<eos> If you have a question or comment, press 1.<eos> If you have an idea for a new Sutter Farms product, press 2.<eos> Ooh.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Didn't realize you were the one proposing.<eos> Hey, Smokey.<eos> It's just that I have to hear about it all the time, so I got skin in the game.<eos> What about a hot-air balloon ride over the lake?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All right, never mind on the hot-air balloon idea.<eos> I got a lot more where that came from.<eos> [phone chimes] Hey, did you figure out what to do with Dawson's dad?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.

Swatello!<eos> - You look...<eos> - You can say it.<eos> "Hot."<eos> I'm trying to bait Bob into a dinner at the grill. Oh. You sure that's it?<eos> What else would I be trying to do?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Just trying to make a certain friend of ours jealous?<eos> I would only be trying to make someone jealous if I liked them.<eos> Which you don't.
Yes!<eos> Stig, I might need a little bit more from you than this.<eos> OK, right, so that's not working.<eos> By process of elimination, if we come off the clutch and press this...<eos> Revving.<eos> Yeah, that's revving.<eos> Getting ready.<eos> And your handbrake's on.<eos> That sounds good.<eos> No, it doesn't.
So, erm... why aren't you wearing any labels today?<eos> Lois, how are things going with your mystery boyfriend?<eos> We spent last night kissing.<eos> He's quite shy, so I guess I don't want to rush him.<eos> Anyway,<eos> I think I'm really falling for him.<eos> Don't commit to anything until you've seen his penis.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Chloe, did you get that bottle of water I asked you for?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I did, actually.
Go on.<eos> There you go, you're off!<eos> Go on, Mrs Mansell.<eos> I'm driving, I'm actually driving!<eos> Can we go really fast?<eos> So, what next?<eos> I am angry at you really angry.<eos> Me and your mum... if you can think of the worst matched couple in the world, that was us.<eos> - Look, you don't have to...<eos> - No, I do.
But you knew I'd be coming?<eos> We need to talk, and Max is here for moral support.<eos> I know how this works by now.<eos> Come in.<eos> Okay, how do I put this? Nicolas, I came here today to tell you... to not do that.<eos> But why?<eos> I want you so much.<eos> Okay, you...<eos> You don't want me. You don't even really know me.<eos> I do.
Plain English.<eos> - I kind of agree. - Mmm. I could normalfy this for you.<eos> No.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, no, no. Just listen.<eos> Just listen. He's got sort of a working-class touch, which is something that's valuable, and we should listen to it.<eos> I printed a copy of the speech from the "G" folder.<eos> Why does he have access to the "G" folder?<eos> I don't even have access to the "G" folder.<eos> Yes, you do, Mike. We all do.
- Oh, geez, hairball!<eos> - Oh, sorry!<eos> - It's Shane.<eos> - What are you...<eos> Hey. No. Uh, not yet, but it's still early.<eos> - It's, uh...<eos> - 5:02.<eos> If the phone rings, everything changes.<eos> Suddenly, you're a superstar.<eos> If it doesn't...
Your body has no ability to fight infection, and the enzyme's not working anymore.<eos> Bone-marrow transplants in kids with SCID can be effective, so we're still looking for a match.<eos> They've been looking for a match for me since I was a baby, and they haven't found one.<eos> What if you still can't?<eos> No other treatment for your disease exists.<eos> We're working on it, but for the time being... your only safe place is right where you are.<eos> Hey, Frankie.<eos> You're late.<eos> I'm not a patient anymore, so I don't have to be at rounds.<eos> But you do.
Well, it would have been justified, interfering with a police investigation. Wait.<eos> If we're this close to Xavier,<eos> Quick, get in before he spots us.<eos> Vincent, I know you're trying to help, I do, but I can't let you get in the way.<eos> I have to track Xavier to Sam so that I can catch him in the act, so that I can arrest him, and Gabe can prosecute. Sam?<eos> Yes.<eos> What about Xavier?<eos> You know he's an innocent victim in all this, right?<eos> He's a person, too.<eos> No, of course I do...
I told you that I'd work with you, help you to find out who allegedly killed your son, but you wouldn't listen.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> I can figure it out on my own.<eos> What, you mean this?<eos> Because if you were hoping to get classified names or something, forget it.<eos> It's encrypted, NSA level.<eos> I know.<eos> And we have it and you don't.<eos> Does that amuse you?<eos> Yes, it does.
Because if you were hoping to get classified names or something, forget it.<eos> It's encrypted, NSA level.<eos> I know.<eos> And we have it and you don't.<eos> Does that amuse you?<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> I'm curious, do you... even care how many lives you've destroyed, how many people you've hurt?<eos> Does that even matter to you?<eos> Do you believe in God, Detective?<eos> Do you?
What are you gonna do, kill me?<eos> Mm. Give me that phone, Wendy, or I'm gonna take it - and stick it down your goddamn throat.<eos> - Well, that'd be a real ballsy move, wouldn't it, Darryl?<eos> How are you gonna do it without your balls?<eos> You ain't gonna use that.<eos> I trusted Kendal with you, you son of a bitch.<eos> - Uh, what did I miss?<eos> - Hey, man, she got a gun.<eos> - Yes, I can see that. - Well, ain't you gonna<eos> - do something about it?
He's had a median sternotomy, a couple of chest tubes.<eos> Low SATs, high B.P.,<eos> - failure to thrive.<eos> - Have you cuddled him?<eos> No, I have not.<eos> Well, if I were left in a cardboard box, all I'd want is cuddling, right?<eos> Oh, I think I'd want a cardiac cath to confirm I've had a coarctation of my aorta.<eos> He is like a puzzle that I can't solve... - Oh, whoopsie! - If you're gonna do that.<eos> Do you have a coarctation of your aorta?<eos> Do you?
- You sure?<eos> Yeah. I've got Ross.<eos> Okay, that's Callie now.<eos> Um, come find me after?<eos> Tell Dr. Bailey to go ahead and start without me.<eos> I'll be there as soon as I can.<eos> They asked for you.<eos> I just need to hear it again.<eos> Tell me that you think this is the right idea.<eos> I do.
I gave up so easy!<eos> Thank you!<eos> To eat all this shawarma right before your tux fitting?<eos> Oh, yeah. I'm not gonna be one of those grooms who doesn't eat.<eos> Hey. Thanks for being so supportive all day.<eos> Best man-- whatever you need, I will do.<eos> Actually, there is one thing.<eos> Do you have a pen I could borrow to sign these forms?<eos> You bet I don't have a pen.<eos> I never do.
Hi, vivian!<eos> [laughs] hi, jake!<eos> Vivian! [laughing]<eos> .<eos> Because of it being such an important one.<eos> You know that in ancient egypt,<eos> The peasants drank beer for breakfast? Well, that explains why all their buildings were crooked.<eos> Charles, can I see you in the bathroom for a second?<eos> I've got a mole on my back that needs a looking-at, And charles has eyes.<eos> I do.
Their affair is what broke up my parents' marriage.<eos> - Oh, I didn't... I didn't... - So I don't know, maybe he thought... that was his chance<eos> - to finally...<eos> - Whitney, your dad is not a killer.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> You don't know him.<eos> You just met him.<eos> Okay, you're right, I... I may not know your dad, but I do know for sure that he did not kill Vikram.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do, okay?
Kyle: Police!<eos> Open the door, we have a warrant! What now? [sighs]<eos> - I just came to get some of my stuff.<eos> - Drop what you're taking.<eos> It's evidence. You girls need to leave right now.<eos> Man: Don't forget to check for fingerprints on any surface.<eos> Man #2:<eos> Yo, come over here. So I have a sister?<eos> I mean half, but...<eos> Yeah. You do.
We're already on it, but what we really need is for your boy Harold to tell us what he knows.<eos> I was like a sitting duck in there.<eos> How could you let this happen?<eos> What kind of a cop are you anyway?<eos> Harold, we're doing everything we can to bring in the gunman.<eos> This is what I get for being a snitch.<eos> Well, technically, you're not a snitch, because you haven't actually told us anything yet.<eos> Well, they don't know that.<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
- Which is ironic...<eos> - Mr. Castle. What on earth possessed you to turn my precinct into the set of Kojak? Oh!<eos> Or should I address you as Captain Castle?<eos> Okay, that was so not my idea.<eos> Oh. But the rest of this was?<eos> Sir, in fairness...<eos> And you. Detective Beckett, you know what a high-profile case this is.<eos> How could you allow this circus?<eos> Sir, given his fixation with the '70s, we figured that this would be an opportunity to let Harold Leone open up about his knowledge on Vincent Bianchi's murder.<eos> And did he?
Okay, that was so not my idea.<eos> Oh. But the rest of this was?<eos> Sir, in fairness...<eos> And you. Detective Beckett, you know what a high-profile case this is.<eos> How could you allow this circus?<eos> Sir, given his fixation with the '70s, we figured that this would be an opportunity to let Harold Leone open up about his knowledge on Vincent Bianchi's murder.<eos> And did he?<eos> Well, no, but...<eos> So, all this mess, this ridiculous display, And you have nothing to show for it?<eos> Actually, sir, we do.
That's probably what he wanted to tell you that night.<eos> Isn't that something?<eos> Knowing he did that for me?<eos> So how does it feel to be in the 2010s?<eos> Eh, it's okay.<eos> I'm ready to say goodbye to the '70s, say goodbye to Vince.<eos> Well, then let's do it the right way.<eos> Honor the times along with the man.<eos> Castle, tell me you don't mean...<eos> Oh, but I do.
No one gets away this time.<eos> Copy.<eos> There's over 900 bucks here.<eos> Yeah. Should be enough to lay low till we can make the move to the mainland.<eos> We got to ditch this car, get off the road.<eos> Gonna be lots of cops out there looking for us, you know?<eos> Were you scared?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I was.<eos> I'm just glad the clerk didn't get stupid.<eos> And what if he did?
Reid's girl.<eos> The lies. What you put inside that man's head. A man that you have known in fellowship, and you lace him with such torment.<eos> I want to know if I can see it, see the evil that has come to roost in you,<eos> Caitlin Swift, the woman that I once made mine.<eos> And can you? Can you see it?<eos> I see what I've always seen.<eos> What is that?<eos> I see the face of the woman that I love.<eos> Does it feel like flesh, Matthew?<eos> Because, to me, it does no longer.
All those men, telling all their secrets.<eos> Mr. Nathaniel Glynn.<eos> Do you remember him?<eos> How could I forget?<eos> Which girl did he favour? Remind me. Lily.<eos> And poor Lily... he favours her still.<eos> The powder will blow the lock mechanism...<eos> The weight of the machine will, at the same moment, release the door, I believe.<eos> Did we not pay for that machine at great expense?<eos> We did, sir.
And yet one act damns me.<eos> I take from a man... my cruel father... whose money is made on nothing more than the blood and toil of others, and then I am drowned in a tide of slaughter.<eos> I think of nothing but the protection of my world from a man who ripped the sex and entrails from five young women, and in my fevered pursuit, my eye is turned, and my daughter... lost,<eos> Until your incidental calamity, by turns, brings her back to me.<eos> 'Tis as you say, Mr. Reid.<eos> We are caught in the teeth of some grotesque.<eos> Damned if we do and damned if we do not.<eos> We might act now, however, wrest some measure of control back to ourselves, see good done.<eos> Why do you send for me?<eos> She does not, Mr. Swift. I do.
You can't kill me, Rumple.<eos> I saw Regina take your dagger.<eos> She gave it to Belle.<eos> And she wants me dead.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Well, then, you'll have to do what she wishes.<eos> If she has the dagger, you have no choice.<eos> Yes.<eos> If she has the dagger.<eos> But she doesn't.
- It's a great name. But maybe not so much for a mistress.<eos> 'Cause then I'd be, like, inside her and I'm feeling like it's incest.<eos> - That's gross.<eos> - Don't be so old-fashioned.<eos> - You are a buzzkill. - This is not going well. I don't...<eos> - No, it's going so poorly.<eos> - I find you very<eos> - attractive, I just don't want...<eos> - I actually have other tables.<eos> - Yeah, sure you do.
He's a grown man. No, he looks like a grown man.<eos> You've seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.<eos> Leonard, we can't protect him forever. - I know, but...<eos> - He'll be okay.<eos> You taught him well, Padawan.<eos> Good Lord!<eos> Padawan's the student, not the teacher.<eos> Seriously, let him go.<eos> Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I'm not gonna stand in your way.<eos> I do.
That is the traction control turning them on, not Stig, who is still fuming because I said a baboon could drive as fast in the Golf as him.<eos> Right, just Gambon left.<eos> More hooliganism from the Beemer.<eos> And across the line!<eos> I have the times here.<eos> Come on, then.<eos> The BMW...<eos> The BMW went round in 1.25.1 so it is slower than the old version, which did it on a damp track.<eos> So that's useless.<eos> And the Golf GTI did a 1.28.6.
Really?<eos> LAUGHTER Now, James, you came down in your Fiat Panda, did you not?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did that catch fire?<eos> Let me just think.<eos> No.<eos> Did it not?<eos> No, it didn't at all. Richard, the hire car you came down in...<eos> Yes? ! ..did that burst into flames?<eos> No, it didn't.
- And what did he say?<eos> I just wanted to find out if it was him.<eos> You didn't tell him that I needed to speak to him?<eos> He was at home, dad.<eos> It looked like he had guests.<eos> I have told you how important this is.<eos> You've been telling me that for two weeks.<eos> I get it, dad.<eos> I get it, really.<eos> No, you don't.
- Dick.<eos> Yes.<eos> Look, I don't see you at home, but I can guess you're a lot like you are here.<eos> And here at work, taking away the tailgate was a dick move.<eos> That was a legal issue.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> But you can choose to find a solution.<eos> You can't like having everybody always pissed at you.<eos> - Comes with the job.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
I know.<eos> I beg your pardon, Mrs Greg, but may I speak to you about Patience Dunne?<eos> I'm worried about her.<eos> I think she may run away or worse.<eos> The other girls make her life a misery, Miss.<eos> They even poured a bucket of wash on her the other day.<eos> Is there any way you could move her before something terrible happens?<eos> It's never wise to bow to mob rule.<eos> She cries herself to sleep every night.<eos> Patience Dunne does?
And you told me you were here to end the Negro apprentice system and then you were going home.<eos> Well, it ended and you stayed, why?<eos> I have a reason.<eos> Should I be worried?<eos> No - you couldn't look at another woman the way you look at me.<eos> It's not another woman.<eos> So what is it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You just don't want us to be together?<eos> I do.
Don't want to lose your job.<eos> Better than losing my sweetheart.<eos> Will you forgive me?<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> Go on!<eos> I'd never have believed I'd be so grateful to have children that sleep.<eos> If I'd known how much having a baby would hurt me.<eos> I still can't cough without consequences.<eos> No wonder Lucy's planning on ending up an old maid.<eos> I don't!
Oh, I certainly hope so.<eos> And when it does, we're gonna have a proper reunion.<eos> We found this stuff in the car.<eos> Anything there ring a bell?<eos> Can I touch it?<eos> Of course.<eos> Go for your life. It's really good to have you back around here.<eos> Is it good for you?<eos> So I'm guessing you remember we dated.<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's so different.<eos> Oh, do you remember the first time Amanda caught us in here?<eos> The duct tape. Yes. Yes, you remember that.<eos> What was I thinking?<eos> I almost ripped my nipple off when I was trying to take it off.<eos> Yeah, you were sticky for hours.<eos> She was so mad when we got together.<eos> You remember the first time?<eos> I brought you the flower?<eos> No, I don't actually.
Truly.<eos> That stolen tech must be pretty important.<eos> Or is it something else?<eos> One of the raiders, he... he made me strip down.<eos> It dredged up some old memories I'd spent years trying to forget.<eos> Now these memories are back in the front of my brain, as clear as you are in front of me.<eos> I'm going to tear apart the man who did this to me.<eos> You can count on that.<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> I do not.
I am not gonna work with the E-Rep, and quite frankly I don't understand how you can either.<eos> There's an argument to be made for having one hand on the wheel.<eos> Yeah, and there's an argument to be made for walking away from a bad situation.<eos> Hey, that's not who you are.<eos> I saw you watch those bomb victims die.<eos> You care.<eos> You can't help yourself.<eos> Don't tell me who I am.<eos> You do not know me.<eos> Of course I do.
Could you...<eos> Would you please?<eos> Is it true?<eos> Of course not!<eos> Your fancy mayor is wrong! Trying to impress you with repugnant lies from a disgruntled employee!<eos> Let me help you understand.<eos> Your sister was having an affair with my wife.<eos> This is not the right moment.<eos> Which is why I forced Stahma into killing her.<eos> Please don't do this.
- This is insane.<eos> - This is amazing.<eos> I always knew we were one in a million, and now we got the proof!<eos> Well, actually, one in 8,000.<eos> Triplets occur a lot more frequently than you imagine,<eos> - especially at your age.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Your body is prone to releasing multiple eggs.<eos> It's what we doctors like to call-- and I don't mean to be insensitive-- a going-out-of-business sale.<eos> So, doctor, um, what do we-- like, what do we do?

- There's a quote too.<eos> "'Only a moron would ever live anywhere other than Pawnee, Indiana.'<eos> Leslie Knope, multiple occasions."<eos> I can cut a new plinth with a less ironic inscription.<eos> This is so touching, you guys.<eos> I am crying out of happiness and sadness and gratitude and because I'm carrying triplets and for a fifth reason that I can't figure out.<eos> Leslie, don't cry. It's not that great.<eos> It doesn't even look like you.<eos> Or, actually, you know what?<eos> It kind of does.
He left the prison in a hurry, but his toiletries were missing from his house, and there was no suitcase there.<eos> He obviously went back to his home even though he knew he was taking a risk.<eos> I think that he might have gone back to pick up his dog.<eos> Did Rockland PD mention anything about animals at the residence?<eos> Rings where the bowls would have been.<eos> That's well-spotted, Watson.<eos> GREGSON:<eos> I'll revise the BOLO. Advise them the suspect may be traveling with his pet.<eos> No, I did not know they made a model for dentures based on Aaron's mouth.<eos> None of us did.
Vincent, last night was...<eos> Incredible.<eos> No, I was gonna say, it was a mistake.<eos> Come on, it wasn't a mistake.<eos> I mean, it felt pretty real to me, right?<eos> It must have meant something?<eos> No. It was break-up sex, that's all.<eos> You don't really believe that, do you?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't.
And get the antidote to Rikers.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He seems pretty shaken.<eos> Any sign of Sam when you first got here?<eos> Please tell me you didn't use your beast powers to track him here, 'cause I can't very well explain how we found him if you did.<eos> I used facial recognition software and surveillance cameras.<eos> Tapped into Homeland Security again, did we?<eos> Yes, I did, okay?
I think she really means it.<eos> And that bugs you?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, maybe.<eos> I don't know. It's not like I want to get married tomorrow, but never?<eos> But you're with her.<eos> I-if you love her, who cares if she's not the marrying kind?<eos> - I wasn't.<eos> - Yeah, but then you did.<eos> Right, but some people don't.
You know he's just sitting out there waiting.<eos> April, you run the trauma department.<eos> You work with him more closely than anybody else.<eos> Do you... Do you trust Owen Hunt to treat patients?<eos> He is my mentor, and he trained me.<eos> I... We value your opinion, April.<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> Just be honest.<eos> Do you trust the man?<eos> No, I don't.
I'm sorry.<eos> She just really wanted to have a chance to plead her case.<eos> That was out of line.<eos> I already said no.<eos> I know it was wrong.<eos> I'm sorry. She doesn't meet the criteria.<eos> It's that simple.<eos> I know it's hard because they're kids and they're dying.<eos> And they've got their stories and lives and family...<eos> Well, she doesn't!
And... I-I-I would love to talk to you about that sometime, but i-i-if it's our children that you are so concerned about, if they disagree with you on some things, if that's not okay with you, then I-I-I don't...<eos> I don't know. Restructure the board?<eos> I'm-I'm making this up.<eos> I have no idea how it works.<eos> Clearly.<eos> Look, the point is there will be a way to figure it out.<eos> We did something that wasn't responsible, but we did it because we love each other and we want to spend every day together until we die.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> - No, you don't have to apologize to her.<eos> - I do. I do.
Yes, sir, but I didn't know that it was stolen.<eos> Why I let him go.<eos> Yeah, but you pulled prints from the impounded vehicle?<eos> No, sir. Tech said it was wiped clean.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, we got a photo, though, right? I mean, dashboard camera from the car stop?<eos> You know, proof he's our guy.<eos> No, sir, my camera hasn't worked for weeks.<eos> But Molly's got a picture. It's in the file. She showed me.<eos> Yeah. - She did?
Louder. Louder!<eos> - I, Lester Nygaard... - "Killed!"<eos> No, no, you see, I did not kill...<eos> Lester, you're gonna say it<eos> - one way or the other, okay?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - All right?<eos> - Mm-hmm. "Killed Sam Hess." That's not true.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> No, I didn't.
So, what day should I tell her we'll be there?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Why are you sitting here?<eos> Relax. I just want to talk.<eos> I'm, uh, kind of wondering what it's like to try something and fail, which is why I'm coming to you, the... biggest failure I know.<eos> Aww. Wait.<eos> Did you try at something?<eos> What?<eos> No. Shut up.<eos> You did!
I'm totally packed.<eos> I even bought one of those mini travel toothpastes, which is already in my toiletry bag.<eos> Old people brag about the weirdest things.<eos> No, you know, last night, your dad and I were talking, and we realized that every time we take a trip, the same thing happens, right, Mike?<eos> Back, cry, forget, snark, fight.<eos> And nobody likes that.<eos> Do you like that?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No. No. Nobody does.
Of course not.<eos> Proud of you.<eos> You know what you want, you went after it.<eos> How'd you get so smart?<eos> I got it from you, Daddy.<eos> Nah. Your mom's the smart one.<eos> Sometimes she says "irregardless" when the word is "regardless."<eos> Yeah, well, irregardless of that, she's your mother and she loves you.<eos> So you want to go to Bel Air, huh?<eos> I do, Daddy.
Wow. You two are just so cute, I could just eat you up.<eos> Give me some of that sugar!<eos> Hey, get over here, Peg!<eos> I'm good.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I forgot.<eos> You weren't much of a hugger.<eos> Unless it involved a boy and the backseat of a car.<eos> Kay, they don't need to hear all that.<eos> Yeah, we really don't.
You're no walk in the park.<eos> I get you one week every three years.<eos> You're like a yeast infection!<eos> Well, my dear, consider yourself cured.<eos> You want to tell me about the volcano in eighth grade?<eos> Okay.<eos> What did you do?<eos> !<eos> I didn't make good choices.<eos> No, you didn't!
I mean, you're-you're just gonna throw away 50 years of friendship?<eos> Watch me.<eos> If I can do it to a sister, I can do it to her.<eos> Mike has an aunt?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Are you through?<eos> No. And neither is Kay.<eos> You know, your best friend is at a funeral home saying good-bye to her mother right now.<eos> And she wants you there.<eos> No, she doesn't.
What was in the box?<eos> Um, his... skateboard tools and stuff.<eos> At least, that's what he said.<eos> But you didn't believe him.<eos> It's just, when he came to get it, he acted kind of strange.<eos> He noticed some tape had come loose on the box, and... he freaked out.<eos> He made me swear I hadn't opened it.<eos> Holly, do you have any idea what was in that box?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I... I really don't.
I... I mean, there was one in the bag.<eos> But it wasn't there when he sent it back.<eos> Did he tell you what he was after?<eos> No. But when I saw all the trouble that we were going to, I told Logan I wanted a cut, not just the 3 grand.<eos> He got really pissed and said he wasn't some criminal and this wasn't about money.<eos> It was about making things right for a friend who died.<eos> He was really intense.<eos> I believed him.<eos> Did Logan tell you who this friend was? No.<eos> He didn't.
- [beep] - The lectures will happen and just put Nova Jenkins' surgery back on the boards for tonight, and I'll-I'll-I'll handle it.<eos> Okay.<eos> [speaks russian] Dr. Shepherd? - Dr. Shepherd?<eos> Dr. Grey wanted me to... - Yeah? Remind you to pick up the kids at daycare tonight.<eos> Yes, got it. Got it handled.<eos> Interpreter: Excuse me, Dr. Shepherd? Are you there?<eos> [beep] Yeah, hi. Sorry.<eos> Man: Hello? Dr. Shepherd?<eos> [sighs] Miranda: Braden's bone-marrow extraction went very well, um, but he's gonna be in some pain for a while.<eos> Hey, you did great, Braden.
Figure out how you're gonna get these bastards out of my noggin?<eos> Yes. It will be a, uh, very careful, very precise... yank.<eos> Oh, me! Me, me, me!<eos> [monitor beeping] [scoffs] Do I have to do that thing where I acknowledge the losers?<eos> 'Cause I have like five minutes.<eos> I don't want to waste it on people I don't even know.<eos> Mm, it is a courtesy.<eos> You're nervous.<eos> You know, I know you think that I'm too busy, but I can make it work, if you don't want to be alone.<eos> But I do.
You kids have fun tonight?<eos> Yeah, but it was just a first date, so we'll see where it goes.<eos> Well, my guess is up to the roof to look at the stars.<eos> That's where he usually tries to close.<eos> Well, who knows?<eos> Sometimes you know right away.<eos> Oh, you have an eyelash.<eos> Sometimes it doesn't take more than a look.<eos> You're right.<eos> Sometimes it doesn't.
What do you think about us?<eos> Georgie, there is no us.<eos> I told you that I can't go out with you as long as there's something between you and my brother.<eos> Which is why I'm here.<eos> To tell him that he's not the one for me.<eos> But Ben really likes you.<eos> And what about you, Danny?<eos> Do you like me?<eos> Tell me you don't, and I'll go.<eos> I don't.
Hoping you're on your way.<eos> Please tell me I didn't bedazzle my underwear for nothing.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Yeah, I stretched that one all the way back to my teens.<eos> Which is pretty much the last time I lost anything.<eos> Bonnie, I have terrible news.<eos> No!<eos> Mm-hmm, yeah. I... I slipped getting out of the hot tub.<eos> You can fake it, can't you?<eos> My gay ex-husband did for years.
Because you two lying, backstabbing, no-lunch-eating, fire-escape-kissing cheaters deserve each other!<eos> Well, I'm not walking away from another woman I care about once again just to spare your feelings!<eos> What do you mean, "once again"?<eos> ! And I think we're back to why I left the first time.<eos> You don't care about anyone else's feelings but your own.<eos> You are selfish and immature and it's not a surprise to anyone that you didn't accomplish anything on your list!<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, you're the worst brother in the world.<eos> You're the one who told me to go out for Georgie in the first place.<eos> No, I didn't.
Nope.<eos> I've only known for two weeks.<eos> What about mark?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Mark--<eos> Mark wants what he wants.<eos> This time I need to know what I want.<eos> I know.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> Yeah, except I don't.
It's got your wet suit in it.<eos> All right, let's do this.<eos> Let's catch a wave.<eos> You ready?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You ready to surf?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, you are.<eos> - You can't know that.<eos> - I do!
Wow!<eos> That's great. I know.<eos> We're kind of taking things to the next level.<eos> What are you doing this weekend?<eos> Oh, opposite of the berkshires.<eos> Work-shires.<eos> Working, whole weekend.<eos> I thought you were taking the weekend off to do your laundry.<eos> Does crime take the weekend off to do its laundry, scully?<eos> No, it doesn't.
Well, just that my mother said he wants to leave tonight on the first of many vacations with her.<eos> If Pascal stops running the day-to-day at LeMarchal, it could create a power vacuum back in Paris.<eos> Where Gideon can sweep in and take advantage.<eos> Yeah, Margaux...<eos> We are about to launch a product that will fundamentally alter the landscape of this company.<eos> So why shouldn't your father commit to you before your brother has a chance to change his mind?<eos> Hello?<eos> Are you sure this is the right address?<eos> County Registrar's office said there's no Kurt Renner or anyone living here.<eos> Well, someone does.
Ooh, have a look at this.<eos> These are the boys from the '89 case.<eos> Old rabbit's foot.<eos> Like a kid would have.<eos> Could be a trophy the killer kept from Scotty Gates.<eos> Well, it's got an evidence tag on it.<eos> And these are all old case files.<eos> Just who the hell is this guy?<eos> Assuming your people didn't find any murder weapon in my house.<eos> No, they didn't, Mr. Bishop.
Okay.<eos> You know, Kit Kat, I don't want you to be sad about this, okay?<eos> 'Cause you're better off without me.<eos> Just sign the papers.<eos> Okay.<eos> There you go.<eos> You are a lucky man, Man Parts.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I just wish I had what you guys have.<eos> Well, maybe you already do.
You always have my back.<eos> Julius was at our house, okay?<eos> And I sang with him, and it was beautiful.<eos> If you were there, you would have loved it.<eos> And Danny's still friends with him.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Come on, les.<eos> Unbelievable, man.<eos> Why couldn't you lie for me?<eos> They all did.
Hold on.<eos> I want to say Justin...<eos> Department of Water and Power?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What's up?<eos> Um...<eos> Not exactly sure how to start this convo.<eos> Uh...<eos> "Danny said you need help with phone sex"?<eos> [Chuckles] Of course he did.
No, I must have hid it real good.<eos> How could you be so sure that it won't be found, whatever this thing is that you have?<eos> Here's the thing, Amanda, Carl.<eos> You thought you had me.<eos> You brought me all this way to The Hague, for Godsake.<eos> I mean, you think this intimidates me?<eos> Impresses me?<eos> This building is full of a bunch of underpaid shitheads who all wish they could have stones like me.<eos> They could look at the world by the short hairs and take it, take it, take it.<eos> But they don't.
I know.<eos> I'll text you after I talk with him.<eos> I cannot believe that I took a pill yesterday to prevent me from becoming pregnant.<eos> I could have had a thing growing inside me that could have turned into a person.<eos> Yeah, that image of you and Emmett as teen parents is kind of freaking me out right now.<eos> So what's going on with you and Tank?<eos> He and I...<eos> Never really clicked like that.<eos> I kept trying to make it work.<eos> And it never did.
You going to cut me?<eos> You like to watch me bleed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You want me to cut you again?<eos> Are you hearing that?<eos> Yeah. She's adding years to his sentence.<eos> Tell me about the first time.<eos> I was eight years old... and I cut my sister's breasts with a straight razor.<eos> I got no problem cutting you.<eos> Well, I do.
Yeah, it was just announced this morning.<eos> Well, those are bogus charges concocted by a jealous competitor who will stop at nothing-- I'm so sorry, Tom.<eos> As Dana mentioned, I was c.c.'d on this, but I didn't exactly have a chance to vet it. Tom.<eos> Our reputation is everything, Ms. Scott.<eos> We can't be in bed with criminals.<eos> I will have another proposal over to you within the hour.<eos> Thank you, Louis.<eos> Oh, and, Tom, Scottie's new, okay?<eos> So just cut her some slack. Because when those training wheels pop off, she's gonna be really, really good.<eos> - What the hell did you do?
Is it possible that they are actually identical?<eos> - Anything's possible.<eos> - How would that be?<eos> Either it's a one-in-a-billion event, or one of them stole the other one's design.<eos> Mm. Your honor, based on evidence introduced by opposing counsel and Mr. Morris' testimony, I would like to file a countersuit against AYZ for patent infringement.<eos> That is outrageous.<eos> His client stole my client's design.<eos> I am the one who is outraged.<eos> This case has nothing to do with patent infringement.<eos> It does now, Reginald.
We were partners when I first came up.<eos> Me and Jimmy worked the gang unit together with Alvin.<eos> Ivory tower recognized he'd be better served working undercover in Chinatown.<eos> Yeah, perfect place for him.<eos> He's got his own Vice squad now... all Chinese cops.<eos> All I can tell you is he was dressed like the guys in the video, and he was looking awfully cranked.<eos> So why don't we put a tail on him, see what's what?<eos> - 'Cause it ain't him.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Because I do.
Bad time?<eos> No contact... that was our agreement.<eos> When exactly do you intend to keep up your end of the deal?<eos> When I'm finished.<eos> You were almost killed after a marriage<eos> I can only imagine was supposed to have a very different honeymoon.<eos> I could have been stuck in here forever, spotting a guy named little shiv on the bench press.<eos> I want to renegotiate.<eos> You have no leverage.<eos> Ah but I do.
I've just been looking forward to this.<eos> My folks have, too.<eos> You're the reason they're coming. I am allowed to be upset.<eos> You don't deserve this.<eos> What?<eos> I'm just saying that you deserve to have somebody who's there for you no matter what, and I'm gone all the time.<eos> Wait.<eos> Are you actually trying to make me break up with you?<eos> I'd understand if you wanted to.<eos> Well, I don't.
You two are such babies needing slaves to run around after you.<eos> My slave doesn't even jog, let alone run.<eos> Anyway, don't you still live with your parents?<eos> In a separate annex, though.<eos> I have my own door. - But your Mum does your cooking?<eos> - Well. - And your laundry?<eos> - Lf she's putting a load on anyway.<eos> - And wipes your bum.<eos> - No, she doesn't do that.<eos> - Right, so your Dad does that?
- Don't know. Must have been slave-napped.<eos> Excuse me, this is my slave.<eos> - He went missing last night.<eos> - Really? Are you this man's slave?<eos> I don't think so, I've never done any actual work for him,<eos> - so how can I be?<eos> - Yeah, very good.<eos> - Can I have him back, please?<eos> - No, he doesn't know you.<eos> - Well, of course, he does.
- Really? Are you this man's slave?<eos> I don't think so, I've never done any actual work for him,<eos> - so how can I be?<eos> - Yeah, very good.<eos> - Can I have him back, please?<eos> - No, he doesn't know you.<eos> - Well, of course, he does.<eos> - I don't, he's a bloody chancer. Oh, don't be like that, G-Man.<eos> We'll be auctioning the new batch at sundown if you'd like to buy him.<eos> - And what if I don't?
Oh, well, now I'm awake.<eos> You mind if I watch it with you?<eos> Sure.<eos> I've always had trouble sleeping. So when I moved to New York, Blaine, um... you're gonna get a kick out of this... he started reading me Star Wars Fan Fiction until I got tired.<eos> "'I think young Anakin "has a diaper full of midichlorians, R-2,' "said C-3PO as he bottle-fed space formula to the infant Jedi who would bring balance to the Force."<eos> Whoever wrote this fan fiction really sucks.<eos> Actually, George Lucas wrote this one.<eos> Can I ask you, um, can I ask you a question?<eos> You never told me why you broke up with me.<eos> Yes, I did.
I just feel so responsible.<eos> We had this huge fight. And then I just left him all alone.<eos> If you'd been with him, he would've done the same thing.<eos> I want to kill whoever did this to him.<eos> Don't say that, Sam.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> I just wish he could hear me.<eos> So I could tell him I was here.<eos> He knows we're here.<eos> He does.
I'm Andrew Mittal.<eos> Uh, Doug's brother, 6D.<eos> He cooks with a lot of garlic and plays a lot of Call of Duty?<eos> Yeah, Doug's a-a primate.<eos> But I'm-I'm house-sitting for him and I appear to have misplaced his bearded dragon, which is not good for anybody.<eos> Um, well, I haven't seen it and I have a meeting.<eos> But...<eos> Ah, there he is.<eos> How did you know he'd be in here?<eos> I didn't.
It's going fa... This is as fast as it goes.<eos> You know this. You're not even redlining, okay?<eos> Look, shut up, okay?<eos> I don't know what's worse, your driving or your backseat driving. Zip it.<eos> Kono, go ahead.<eos> We're a little busy.<eos> KONO: Guys, air traffic control is reporting a small aircraft on approach.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I thought we shut down the airport.<eos> We did.
The... the ganja.<eos> The ol' Mexican spinach.<eos> Alan, if I live, I'm going to kill you.<eos> Stop it.<eos> You are gonna live.<eos> Is he gonna live?<eos> We're en route with a 35-year-old male. BP is 160/94, pulse is 108.<eos> And he's dressed as zombie Elvis, over!<eos> I-I don't know if you guys need to know that.<eos> They don't.
It's my daughter.<eos> Just ignore me.<eos> 4,000 likely voters.<eos> Landlines and cell phones.<eos> Mrs. Florrick is well-liked among female voters, liberal and conservative.<eos> That's very unusual. Older female voters liked that she stood by her husband;<eos> younger, that she started her own business.<eos> You needed me, Mr. Gold?<eos> Actually, Nora needed to talk to you.<eos> No, I don't.

Yes.<eos> Well, why don't I let you two talk?<eos> So... you want my endorsement?<eos> Actually I was told that you had had a change of heart.<eos> So, what does this do?<eos> Peter thinks Castro wants the meeting.<eos> Castro thinks Peter wants the meeting.<eos> They're both prideful and...<eos> I want to learn your job.<eos> No, you don't.
I told her she could walk away.<eos> It's your job to call the shots, all right?<eos> You're supposed to tell her what to do.<eos> One, two, three. Voilà!<eos> All right, that's a house.<eos> No.<eos> Correction... that's my house.<eos> You told me I should spend my money on something I've always wanted.<eos> I never thought I'd get to own a place... you know, put down roots, feel like I belong.<eos> Now... now I do.
I mean, isn't this, like, the perfect time for you to disappear?<eos> You got to make up your mind, Beverly.<eos> Either I'm the jerk who's never there when you need him or I'm the white knight always trying to swoop in and save everybody.<eos> Pretty hard to be both.<eos> Yet you manage it so well. Makes it even worse.<eos> 'Cause you get people's hopes up and then you bail on them.<eos> Everything that's going on, you want to do this right now?<eos> Do what?<eos> Talk about things that actually matter?<eos> Yeah. I do.
They put their lives on the line, and I sing songs for a living.<eos> Now they're all gonna get stiffed, 'cause we were gonna simulcast to posts all over the world.<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> Fort Campbell is right outside of Nashville... 30,000 troops there.<eos> Why don't you just go do the show for those guys, and then we can simulcast it overseas?<eos> Well, it'd be hard to do in a hurry, and I don't know if I have a whole show in me, either.<eos> Well, I'd help.<eos> And, listen, we put the word out, I'm sure there are a ton of people in this town who would love to do it.<eos> Don't you have an album to launch?<eos> I do.
ï½♪ Tell me what you think... ï½♪ Can I ask you a question?<eos> I was wondering if you could tell me about the night... ï½♪ As long as it's somewhere ï½♪<eos> Look, you raised a hell of a girl, Teddy.<eos> And you were there for all of it.<eos> I just... ï½♪ We can park on a hill ï½♪ ï½♪ and roll it on down to the riverside ï½♪<eos> ï½♪ Sit and watch the moon shine... ï½♪ Rayna labored most of the night at home.<eos> By the time we got to the hospital, they rushed us right into the delivery room, and Maddie was born right before sunrise.<eos> She came out crying.<eos> Man, she had a set of lungs on her.<eos> Still does.
I did push back. When you push back, you change people's minds, which means either you didn't agree with me or you don't care enough to change his mind.<eos> Look, I know when it's time to change someone's mind and when it isn't, and all pushing harder in that meeting would've done was make him dig in.<eos> We had an ally.<eos> Jonathan agreed with me. Yeah, and then he agreed with his boss, which is what we're gonna do, because it's the way the world works.<eos> - Come on, Harvey.<eos> - Mike. This man goes through lawyers like a hot knife through butter, and I wasn't about to get us fired to protect some guy I don't even give a shit about.<eos> Now are you on board with that?<eos> I'm on board.<eos> Can we move on? - I have nothing to move on to.<eos> - I do.
We just cut the fabric into this shape and then...<eos> Leo, come on, we've got this.<eos> Go find your mother.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The Incas have clearly made no progress.<eos> There must be a clue somewhere.<eos> Leonardo!<eos> Mother!<eos> Tell me you heard that.<eos> I did.
And I don't see myself having children.<eos> And I don't see that changing.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> Well, don't apologize.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I am worried about you.<eos> Will you be happy with me without children?<eos> Will what we have be enough for you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I honestly don't.
I get you and JT are having issues, but this is worst-case scenario.<eos> There is no room for doubt.<eos> I wasn't doubting...<eos> He could lose control, be outed, he could kill somebody.<eos> Okay, we'll get him the gem.<eos> We'll say it's for religious beliefs.<eos> - They can't argue with religion.<eos> - Okay, even if we do, there are gonna be depositions, trials, talking to lawyers.<eos> Gabe'll get you a great lawyer.<eos> Yeah, well, he better because Vincent did this.
Catherine, you can't come with me.<eos> I just got you back.<eos> I'm not letting you go again.<eos> Especially if I know that people are after you.<eos> People are always gonna be after me, okay?<eos> Yeah, but I won't be.<eos> Look, I keep I saying that I need to move forward, but towards what?<eos> You know, maybe my moving forward is coming with you.<eos> Unless you don't want me to come?<eos> Of course I do.
And Cassie is my daughter.<eos> A synergist like Stephen.<eos> Stephen's mother is a paranormal?<eos> Oh, you didn't know?<eos> Oh, of course, that old familiar blind spot for family.<eos> A luxury I cannot afford.<eos> I had thought, perhaps, that Cassie would be up for the task, given her pedigree, but it was not to be.<eos> This would all be so much simpler if we still had your brother.<eos> Wouldn't it?<eos> But we don't.
Just finished rehearsing for a new production.<eos> A small theater but a big role.<eos> He was looking forward to being back on the boards.<eos> Nothing unusual?<eos> No.<eos> What about Jeremy?<eos> What about Jeremy?<eos> Well, had you seen him recently?<eos> You know how it was between them.<eos> Yes, I do.
It could just as well be your head.<eos> Rose brought the malum here behind my back to complete the grand rite without me.<eos> Whose idea was it to turn the puritans' hatred against themselves?<eos> To use them to achieve the first grand rite in centuries?<eos> Who made that possible?<eos> Yet you and that foul bitch mistrusted me.<eos> And much worse for you, you underestimated me.<eos> But killing the Samhain, do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> The question is not whether I understand what I have done, but whether you understand what you must now do.<eos> I do.
He didn't have to tell me about that reserve tank, but he did.<eos> Yesterday, we save his life, he can barely utter a "thank you."<eos> I think in some strange way, he tried.<eos> A few words does not change the fact that all he cares about is his folklore status.<eos> And he's not the only one fueling it.<eos> Rebecca's been... talking him up all over town.<eos> She's also the one who discovered the whole... crop problem in the first place.<eos> But a few science textbooks is not gonna solve what's happening here.<eos> She doesn't know everything about this dome.<eos> And we do?
Well, you finally got a word in.<eos> It brought me comfort.<eos> The gravesite is where I felt closest to you.<eos> Brought you flowers every Sunday.<eos> Thank you, but...<eos> I realize it wasn't about you.<eos> It was about me.<eos> It was about healing.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Mom, that's not why...<eos> - No!<eos> You need to get dressed, get in the limo with Luke, and go to that prom with your head held high.<eos> - Mom, I can't...<eos> - You are a great girl!<eos> And there's nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> I can't go to prom 'cause I can't stop farting.<eos> That's what that is.<eos> All right, well, we can fix this.<eos> - How we doing in here?
Let's go.<eos> McGee, where are you?<eos> Do you think it's possible we could've shaken these guys?<eos> No. Keep your eyes open.<eos> Oh, boss, I got a signal.<eos> These damn things won't let me shut 'em down.<eos> - It's even messing with our phones.<eos> - Got every available I.T. helping Ms. Sciuto, and not one of them knows what the hell it is.<eos> We know one I.T. who does.<eos> Or did.
Bold gesture.<eos> I called you three times.<eos> I had to do something.<eos> - You must be feeling bad.<eos> - I am.<eos> What for?<eos> You're just doing your job.<eos> Scottie, I'm sorry.<eos> What happened with Louis, I didn't like doing it.<eos> - Yeah, but you still did it.
- A piece.<eos> - No.<eos> - No piece?<eos> No negotiating.<eos> Look, I know what you're doing.<eos> You can't make up your mind, so you want me to make it up for you.<eos> But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.<eos> I want someone who's with me 'cause they want to kick some ass.<eos> - And if you want to take this job right now, I will negotiate in good faith.<eos> But you don't.
I let Jessica look stupid. Katrina--<eos> Thank you for your help, Rachel. I really appreciate it, but if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone.<eos> He's not here.<eos> Where is he?<eos> To tell you the truth, I don't know.<eos> All he said was he had a late night. - You're taking the job, aren't you?<eos> Well, I can come back.<eos> - I was just--<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Okay, look, I left you out of it to protect you.<eos> I mean, you shouldn't have come forward, Jo.<eos> I had to... for Danny.<eos> (Chuckles) Yeah, for... for Danny.<eos> Charlie, you can still get yourself out of this.<eos> Just go to my dad and tell him that you lied.<eos> It's not that easy, you know.<eos> I have to think about it.<eos> I just... Danny never hit you.<eos> You did that to yourself.
Thank you for saying that.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I heard you came forward. - Yeah, I kind of had to.<eos> And Danny's out with an ankle bracelet.<eos> It's just Danny and I that came forward.<eos> My dad doesn't think that anybody else knows, so...<eos> I probably shouldn't say anything.<eos> But Danny told the truth, right?<eos> We both did.
It wasn't an accident that you ended up in juvie with Danny.<eos> No.<eos> No, it wasn't an accident.<eos> I stole a car so that I would be put in the same facility as him.<eos> I mean... (Laughs) it took months to figure out how to work my way into being his roommate.<eos> To kill him.<eos> - You wanted to kill him for revenge.<eos> - No.<eos> - Understand... that's not what I said.<eos> - Yes, you did.
- "Different" bad?<eos> - Bad for me.<eos> I didn't want to think about you. I wanted to stay focused.<eos> And then I saw you after you were shot... fighting to stay alive?<eos> But you're right.<eos> I'm kevlar.<eos> You're not.<eos> You don't have to be.<eos> You don't have to shut people out.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Coulson:<eos> Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> - Triplett:<eos> A hard drive?<eos> It's all the research our team's ever done, encrypted for safekeeping.<eos> I'll give you 24 hours to get the password and get out.<eos> After that, bring the girl to me.<eos> - You don't have to shut people out.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
I know.<eos> I get it.<eos> You should have been straight with me.<eos> I would have kept your secrets like a good soldier.<eos> I always have.<eos> But instead, you were worried about me when you should have been worried about anyone else!<eos> You're right.<eos> We should have seen Hydra coming.<eos> But after D.C., they don't stand a chance.<eos> John Garrett does.
Hydra, on the other hand, less constrained in their thinking.<eos> - And younger. - Usually younger.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I told you we should have gone in. - Oh, hush.<eos> May looks barely a day over... 30.<eos> You're gorgeous.<eos> Score one for the Howling Commandos.<eos> Your grandpa's pin should help me locate Cybertek's mainframe.<eos> I didn't know they had wi-fi back in the day.<eos> They didn't.
Deacon.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> I just wanted to come over and say congratulations and what a great guy he is and that I hope you'll both be very happy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause it's a lie.<eos> I was angry when I thought you were lying to me, so I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> I got to say something.<eos> No, you don't.
Roll an ambo to 1400 West Roosevelt.<eos> We have multiple wanted offenders.<eos> So the second car came rolling up, guns blazing.<eos> I took cover, returned fire... the van was clear in about 30 seconds.<eos> They took off. I got the plate numbers, but they came back bogus.<eos> Yeah, we're real close to getting an I.D. on this guy.<eos> - You okay, kid?<eos> - Yeah, a little close.<eos> What do we got down here?<eos> - [Sighs] - How you doing?
Do you think there's any shot that Voight was involved with Jin's murder?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> That's an answer to a different question.<eos> No.<eos> There is no way he's involved.<eos> Yeah, well, he's gonna bury the case, for God knows what reason.<eos> Why?<eos> What reason would he have?<eos> Do you really think that you know everything about this guy?<eos> How you doing?
She said she heard a scream, saw Dr. Slocombe drive off pretty fast in his Porsche.<eos> She assumed it was an argument until she saw us.<eos> He could've been dumping evidence.<eos> We know what time Slocombe got back?<eos> His car's not here, and it's not in the street.<eos> Once Slocombe drove off, how'd he get back?<eos> Maybe he dumped the car, too, came back in a taxi.<eos> What if there was someone else here?<eos> - We get a license on that car?<eos> - We did.
Oh, no.<eos> The S.S. Desperation?<eos> That's what we used to call it.<eos> When you were younger and had all your options.<eos> Now you'd better call it your last best chance to find your perfect Southern fiancé.<eos> So, you want to put me out to sea for a month with a bunch of Titanic-worshipping losers?<eos> It is a luxury liner with a very exclusive passenger list, most of whom disembark engaged.<eos> It's Noah's Ark in reverse.<eos> You leave in four days.<eos> Uh, no, I don't.
but nothing is working.<eos> I have been hiccupping for 14 hours!<eos> It's stress.<eos> What?<eos> Who's the doctor here?<eos> It's stress.<eos> You're upset because Wade is leaving.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, you are, because you love him.<eos> No, I don't!
Because I realized that I belong here.<eos> You realized that you belong here, or you realized that you belong with him?<eos> If you recall, I returned with someone else.<eos> I was in a serious relationship!<eos> Yes, because you were doing everything in your power to deny your true feelings.<eos> You don't want to be in love with Wade because he hurt you, which is why you took off to New York the minute that he told you that he loved you.<eos> And then you had to watch him date your cousin... which proved that he had changed and he had grown up, and it killed you.<eos> Because... guess why.<eos> You... love him, Zoe.<eos> No... I... don't.

- Danny.<eos> - Come on, get off. Come on.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> - Listen, we need to leave right now.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> I'm home.<eos> This is not your home.<eos> You know what?<eos> You guys can leave.<eos> Bryan and Jillian, they did.
- Come on, get off. Come on.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> - Listen, we need to leave right now.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> I'm home.<eos> This is not your home.<eos> You know what?<eos> You guys can leave.<eos> Bryan and Jillian, they did.<eos> - Vic did. - What?
Toni?<eos> - Please don't shoot me.<eos> - Where's Danny?<eos> Where is Danny? !<eos> - Where he belongs.<eos> - What did you do to him?<eos> - Did you do something to him?<eos> - But he liked it.<eos> He doesn't know what you are.<eos> I do.
- Please don't shoot me.<eos> - Where's Danny?<eos> Where is Danny? !<eos> - Where he belongs.<eos> - What did you do to him?<eos> - Did you do something to him?<eos> - But he liked it.<eos> He doesn't know what you are.<eos> I do.<eos> I do!
Yeah.<eos> We got to go.<eos> JC Dekker.<eos> How's the surfboard business?<eos> You tell me.<eos> State of Hawaii became the proud owner of that when you threw me in here.<eos> Well, that's because your problem was trying to diversify.<eos> You should've just stuck with selling surfboards instead of going to the guns.<eos> Warden says you got something for us.<eos> I do.
Which may explain why she's here.<eos> - What about that one?<eos> - Oh God no. The boobs, the hair, the nose... all fake.<eos> The maintenance alone would break you.<eos> Wow. I didn't know you were so good at this.<eos> Oh, Ben, the things you don't know about me could fill an adult bookstore.<eos> I can't believe I'm gonna ask you this, but... will you be my wingmom?<eos> Wait.<eos> For the first time in history, a son actually wants his mother's opinion on who to go out with?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Just visiting my man at work.<eos> Oh. (Mouths) Well, I hope you mean this guy, because if I recall, we decided to stop seeing each other.<eos> No, as I recall, you decided and now I'm undeciding for you.<eos> Did you miss the part where I said we were done?<eos> Followed by the text that said we were done, followed by the phone call and email that I believe were similarly themed?<eos> Ben, you might not know this, but I'm the best thing that ever happened to you.<eos> But we can talk about it more when you get home from work.<eos> Home?<eos> We don't have a home.<eos> Sure we do.
It's not really the problem right now!<eos> Since you seem to have one or two things in common with Bailey, what would get rid of you?<eos> Well, probably a single dad who works for tips and lives with a giant and a dwarf!<eos> But since that hasn't worked, I don't know!<eos> Great.<eos> So she's the mother of the mother of all crazies.<eos> That's it.<eos> You just have to out-crazy the crazy.<eos> - I think I know how to fix this.<eos> - You do?
I totally made her hold my backpack.<eos> No, that she's your daughter.<eos> (Sighs) And that's what I was afraid of.<eos> How did you figure it out?<eos> It wasn't that hard.<eos> I just put two and two together.<eos> I thought you were the slow one.<eos> You have to tell her.<eos> She deserves to know.<eos> Actually, I don't.
I got to get out of here.<eos> Riley, wait.<eos> What are you... come on!<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, ironically she just remembered that she left a cake in the oven.<eos> Aww, a girl after my own heart.<eos> You know, she reminds me of my little sister.<eos> Or your daughter?<eos> - I don't have one.<eos> - But what if you did?
But how about you let me do most of the talking?<eos> Okay.<eos> I can't believe Margot never told me she was pregnant.<eos> I wasn't even sure we were really doing it right.<eos> You know, Riley's gonna be here any minute.<eos> So why don't you go out on the fire escape while I try to make her believe this was all her idea.<eos> Knock knock. Look, I know... I know what you're gonna say.<eos> And you are right, okay?<eos> I'm being silly, and I started this thing, so I need to finish it.<eos> And I do.
Caffrey, you're running out of time.<eos> My travel broke.<eos> I'm supposed to meet with the Panthers in two hours, Caffrey.<eos> Figure something out, now.<eos> Guard's about to come around the bend, Caffrey.<eos> Now or never.<eos> Caffrey, I see the guard.<eos> He kept touching things.<eos> If you don't want your equipment modified - for maximum accuracy...<eos> - We don't.
L'm broke.<eos> I'm this close to welfare and welfare's a fucking no.<eos> When he turns 16, he'll be eligible for youth detention.<eos> I ain't gonna send my son to a jail for lil' punks waiting to be big punks!<eos> They/ll fuck him up.<eos> Did you... consider the S-14 law'?<eos> The new law.<eos> Forget about it.<eos> As a last resort.<eos> L'll never do that to my son!
Hurry, or we'll be dead before tomorrow.<eos> Observe, child, the quintessence of devoted marriage, how carefully I attend to my dear husband's toilet And how fearlessly he exposes his throat to my blade.<eos> Come along, miss Mercy.<eos> Leave her.<eos> Take him with you, tituba.<eos> One's too few, and three's too many.<eos> Your eyes... So filled with want.<eos> The hard part's not getting what you want, child.<eos> The hard part's knowing what you want.<eos> But I do.
We know that Abby fought with her killer, right?<eos> We also know that you went to the Student Health Services and reported that you had two bruised ribs the day after she disappeared.<eos> That's because the rent-a-cop at the dispensary whacked me with my flashlight when he threw me out.<eos> What kind of a writer are you?<eos> Fiction, non-fiction...?<eos> Essays and things like that.<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> I'm just trying to figure out how good you are at making up stories, that's all.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Termites did a number on these bones.
- Why?<eos> Plus, she cut off your supply at her dispensary.<eos> That is crazy.<eos> I'm a good student.<eos> I'm here to study.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, we talked to some of your classmates. They said, four months ago, you sold pot to some of your customers, and it didn't get them high.<eos> Because her plants were truly medicinal.<eos> That's why you didn't go back for the rest of her grow. You have no proof of this.<eos> Yes, we do.
That cannot happen.<eos> We must do something.<eos> Guard: The king is not in his chambers, lady kenna.<eos> He asked me to wait for him.<eos> "paragraph two.<eos> "in case of wife's death...<eos> Guard: My lord!<eos> Kenna.<eos> I know why you're here.<eos> You do?
Give us a fag, would you.<eos> Watch your step, mate.<eos> There's mines.<eos> I've got a med kit.<eos> Oi, follow our line in, mush.<eos> Yeah, you got it.<eos> - Rescue party's come down from Athens.<eos> Mark's got a stretcher.<eos> Fuck me!<eos> How you doing?
Oh! Oh, my God!<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Let's get out of here!<eos> Wait! No!<eos> I have other available lots!<eos> Okay, we have to get up.<eos> I don't want to have to fire you for being late.<eos> I'll appeal and tell them why.<eos> Not sure I told you... my parents are coming to town.<eos> No, you didn't.
Oh, right.<eos> That's right, a warrant.<eos> Like this one here?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Look at that.<eos> That okay for you, Mr. Huntsman?<eos> Hey. Okay, initially I thought the damage to the organs was caused by predation, animals tearing them apart.<eos> But these are actually fractures.<eos> All right, I'm not Dr. B, but organs don't fracture.<eos> Only bones do.
You were supposed to be more careful.<eos> You're no better than the people who murdered your family.<eos> What do you know about my family?<eos> Everything I do is to honor them.<eos> Murdering innocent people doesn't honor anybody.<eos> Innocent?<eos> Look around!<eos> Roy... the numbers.<eos> Roy doesn't have them.<eos> I do.
This is an escort service.<eos> So Daniels was having an affair.<eos> With a "promising young woman."<eos> I have a feeling I know exactly what she was promising.<eos> See if you can track down whoever it is that's running this...<eos> scholarship fund.<eos> Whoever it is knows what they're doing.<eos> Got the location pretty well cloaked.<eos> You know, I may be an idiot, but don't these nonprofits have to report donations of a certain size somewhere?<eos> Yeah, they do.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Sarge, who's looking at me?<eos> Hey. Where's Grandpa?<eos> He's out.<eos> Good.<eos> Someone's looking into me, Dad.<eos> Who is it?<eos> I really can't talk about that now.<eos> So you do know about it.<eos> Yes, I do.
That's how you do it.<eos> You see that?<eos> Um, so, my friend, I would like a margarita on the rocks with salt, please.<eos> Sure ya wanna mix like that, ya lush?<eos> Oh, I can handle my liquor, thank you very much.<eos> And get one for Hayley, too.<eos> Eddie, do you want to come with me to the girls' room?<eos> I need you a sec.<eos> Why do girls always need to pee in pairs.<eos> We do not, okay?
We do not, okay?<eos> Okay, try not to miss us too much.<eos> Okay, we'll try.<eos> You realize you're kidding yourself, right?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You said you were not into Eddie.<eos> She's like my sister.<eos> Well, I think you want to kiss your sister.<eos> And I don't mean Erin.<eos> I don't.
You'd have to ask him that.<eos> I'm asking you.<eos> Why would a solid cop like Cutter-- close to making detective-- suddenly turn in his shield, forfeit his seniority and start from scratch with another department?<eos> You know, I always considered us colleagues.<eos> Friends, even, in that "from work" kind of way.<eos> You?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> There was an allegation that went away with a quick settlement and a quiet resignation.<eos> How did you know?<eos> I didn't... till now.
- Nothing!<eos> Look, Leon's best friend died.<eos> I was being supportive, and it turned into something else, but it was a mistake, and it never happened again.<eos> Chelsea, this undermines your credibility.<eos> And it gives the Breakers the right to terminate you.<eos> Well, it doesn't give Ally and her posse<eos> - the right to harass me.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> It doesn't.
Suddenly you care about the environment, Ellie?<eos> You spearheaded that seaside strip mall that every environmental group opposed.<eos> I now realize that that was a mistake.<eos> Madam Mayor, may I suggest that you call a vote on the current measure... your impeachment?<eos> Excuse me, we have a protocol for comment.<eos> - You can fill out a form...<eos> - I am the mayor's attorney.<eos> Pursuant to chapter six of the brown act, I am permitted to offer her council, and I am urging her to call a vote now.<eos> We have to wait for Councilman Andrews.<eos> No, we don't.
I've... i've had this stutter since I was a kid.<eos> I-I went to a speech pathologist, and... and he used puppets in his therapy, and it worked.<eos> I found that as long as I was working with a puppet, my impediment went away.<eos> How do you like that?<eos> Of the two of us, I'm the normal one.<eos> The condition is called selective mutism.<eos> So, you never weaned yourself off the puppet?<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> We prefer to be called mannequin Americans.<eos> Uh, no, I never did.
Are you happy that I had an affair with that over-sexed married woman?<eos> Cheryl just said that you both know you didn't do it, and given that she's obsessed with you and hated her husband, I don't think you killed Harry.<eos> I think it's possible she did.<eos> And according to that file, she was at the club the day of the murder.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> We have another suspect.<eos> Stace? Sweetie, what's wrong?<eos> I'm worried about Owen.<eos> I don't think he wants to marry me.<eos> Well, of course he does.
And that, Dr. Hubert, is probably where my fear of anthropomorphic animals comes from.<eos> I still can't go to Disney Land.<eos> Thank you for sharing.<eos> But we've been here for 45 minutes, and I'm not hearing anything from Owen.<eos> Owen, you recently had an anxiety attack.<eos> Let's talk about that.<eos> Yes, let's!<eos> I don't think Owen wants to marry me.<eos> What?<eos> ! No, of course I do.
Why is this relevant?<eos> The average whale weighs one ton.<eos> The annual legal limit for slaughtering whales is 1,000.<eos> But if they sold 5,000 tons of whale meat, that likely means they killed approximately 5,000 whales.<eos> They exceeded the maximum kill five times over.<eos> It seems Okata violated the law.<eos> - Right.<eos> - But, nevertheless, your client still sabotaged Okata's vessel.<eos> It doesn't change the facts of the case.<eos> Actually, it does.
(Sighs) Are we okay?<eos> Yeah, of course we're okay.<eos> Ms. Kaswell.<eos> Whenever you're ready.<eos> Um... your honor, the defendant would like you to believe that this case is about professional etiquette.<eos> But the truth is, it's really about so much more than that.<eos> It's about the way we choose to live our lives.<eos> It's about limitations and possibilities.<eos> Now, do I personally believe in Sasquatch?<eos> No, I don't.
You should pick some up.<eos> Bring it to the office.<eos> I know that Kim loves shrimp.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Sure. Sure.<eos> Whatever it is you want.<eos> - Hey, listen to this.<eos> - What?<eos> I got the best wedding present ever two perfect little babies.<eos> Yes, you did.
Bring it to the office.<eos> I know that Kim loves shrimp.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Sure. Sure.<eos> Whatever it is you want.<eos> - Hey, listen to this.<eos> - What?<eos> I got the best wedding present ever two perfect little babies.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> You did.
The state gave Harper School, LLC the money and not Harper School Inc., which is a separate legal entity.<eos> It's a difference without a distinction.<eos> Hardly.<eos> The state approached the school about using our athletic fields for public youth programs.<eos> We accepted the money through a separate business entity precisely to avoid the public funding that might jeopardize our private status.<eos> Taxpayer money still made it onto Harper School's campus.<eos> I'm sorry, Ms. Bingum, but Mr. Brenner is correct.<eos> These are different corporate entities, so AB1266 doesn't apply.<eos> Unless you have something else...<eos> Absolutely. I do, your honor.
Is there anything I can say to change your mind?<eos> Paul, I really do like you.<eos> But if I have to pick between you and Grayson...<eos> I pick Grayson.<eos> I just don't see how we can beat this school if they're not subject to state law.<eos> I'm hoping there's something in the student handbook.<eos> Seriously?<eos> You think a snotty private school like that has a rule that says a transgender student can use their gender identified bathroom?<eos> I don't know, Kim.<eos> Oh, actually, I do.
I'm not sure anyone would enjoy that.<eos> Oh, no, well, that's not really true.<eos> You know, I mean, 'cause you're just always so self-deprecating.<eos> I've got stuff to do.<eos> She's green.<eos> I don't think we should just put her in with random skank.<eos> You said Zen Dolls, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> I know somebody who works there.<eos> Or did.
Come on.<eos> Found this in my desk.<eos> What was she like?<eos> She was a pain in the ass.<eos> Her coffee order was the most complicated in the district.<eos> Took her longer to describe it than to drink it.<eos> But she was damn good police.<eos> Slept like a baby every night.<eos> Mind if I keep it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm gonna tell Briggs in return for the info on you guys, all I want to know is what he knows about the construction robbery, you feel me?<eos> They feel you.<eos> I'll wait outside.<eos> No doubt.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> - What's up, dog?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Where's Copeland Briggs?<eos> Got some stone-cold wildcats right here.<eos> Yeah. Hey, well, I don't...
Hot in Cleveland is recorded in front of a live studio audience.<eos> Special Agent Griffin Gilmore, administering polygraph examination.<eos> Case number 2498, escape from Ohio federal corrections facility, prisoner:<eos> Emmet Lawson.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Emmet is a Sir.<eos> He was knighted by the queen, you know, like Sir Elton John and Sir Paul McCartney.<eos> I mean, maybe the queen is just a big fame whore and this is her way of meeting celebrities, but it should count for something.<eos> It doesn't.
We have our first lead.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> You know, on Edge of Tomorrow, Honor St. Raven once cloned a missing lover from the DNA left in his shoe.<eos> Let's call that "Plan B."<eos> Yeah, I don't even know if my shoes will fit me anymore.<eos> My feet swell up two sizes when I'm pregnant.<eos> Pregnant.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Well, Melanie, when a man and a woman love each other very much, and the woman is pushing 50... how did this happen?<eos> It just did.
I mean, I didn't see a ring.<eos> I thought maybe we could have dinner sometime.<eos> Oh, normally I would love that, but I can't, as I've just rekindled a relationship with my baby-daddy.<eos> Oh, uh, how old's your baby?<eos> 400 months.<eos> Well, I didn't mean to get in the middle of a serious relationship.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Though it's hard to say how serious it is.<eos> He's out of the country and he said he'd come back.<eos> But what if he doesn't?
- Aye.<eos> I had no idea that all that was going on.<eos> That's right.<eos> Ye've not told me what you were doing all day.<eos> Hey, on your feet, lass.<eos> You hardly wanna get married looking like a melted candle.<eos> Like a what?<eos> Oh, god.<eos> So, do ye no remember anything of your own wedding?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
It's not brain surgery.<eos> It looks kind of exciting.<eos> Mother!<eos> Right to the bone.<eos> - You're not cold?<eos> - You kidding me?<eos> Gonna have a frickin' heart attack.<eos> Ah, I wish I could do it.<eos> Can't you just take that stuff out for a second?<eos> Yeah, well, I do sometimes.
We... we have to regulate the construction density. What?<eos> The construction d...<eos> What time are you... what time are you meeting the mayor?<eos> 2:00.<eos> Can I tell you my points again?<eos> Mom, I've heard them many times.<eos> - You know them.<eos> - I know.<eos> I know, and George told me not to focus on the information.<eos> - George did?
Yeah! They broke into my house on Christmas.<eos> People, please, look, we're just trying to keep everybody safe.<eos> Well, you're not trying to keep us safe.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> It just doesn't seem fair, us being locked up inside our houses.<eos> Yeah. I mean, with all due respect, Chief, how do we even know these people didn't do this to themselves?<eos> Because you were with them when they found the body.<eos> Well, I was with some of them.<eos> What are you... you don't even live here.<eos> Well, sure I do.
Got it. Jesus. Right.<eos> The stoning.<eos> Fuck.<eos> The victim was what, Tomorrow's Family? No, Guilty Remnant.<eos> Oh, those nuts.<eos> What's up with the chain-smoking?<eos> Look, you know what? It sounds like you got your hands full.<eos> They sent the body to you a couple hours ago, and it's not like...<eos> Shit.<eos> They did?
Any chance I could get an autograph?<eos> Sure.<eos> You're fighting Enrique Corona today.<eos> Man, have you got guts.<eos> You know it's just for show, right?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> But they did tell you about Enrique, right?<eos> What am I saying?<eos> Of course they did.
Mack the Knife.<eos> Reid: Let me ask you, did Abigail come in often?<eos> Was she a regular customer?<eos> What was that?<eos> Mack the Knife.<eos> Was that the song in her head?<eos> No.<eos> It was the name of her last...date.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Yes, I do.
His gun is in there.<eos> Oh, my God. What?<eos> I need you to get out in that hallway.<eos> Ok.<eos> You ok?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Relieved.<eos> I thought it was gonna be the worst day.<eos> I was so afraid Reid wasn't going to make it.<eos> Yeah, but he did.
Any--right there is fine.<eos> Ok.<eos> So, you should get some sleep.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yesterday touched a nerve when I saw you like that.<eos> Who's Ethan?<eos> My son.<eos> He was 9 when he died.<eos> Doctors said it was neurological, but they didn't have a name for it.<eos> Still don't.
You're trying to save her.<eos> You've seen danger here.<eos> My old friend, how can I say this?<eos> I can't let you leave.<eos> Your gift of sight is invaluable to me, to the safety of France.<eos> You can force me to stay... but not to see.<eos> You'll have me, but not my visions.<eos> Not if you cost me this last chance at happiness.<eos> So you came to me as if I had a choice,<eos> - but clearly I don't.
See you and Jake, Barnes Noble,<eos> I'll have the press there, do a couple of interviews, a couple of happy snaps.<eos> Easy peasy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You look great.<eos> - Bye, cat.<eos> Thank you. Bye, darling.<eos> Easy peasy.<eos> Cat said that Jake needs to be at the book signing.<eos> He does.
Know him well?<eos> A bit.<eos> He grew up here, But he's a lot younger than me.<eos> [clears throat] That's where you're supposed to say,<eos> "but he doesn't look it, miller."<eos> Ah, missed my cue.<eos> Mm-hmm. Anyway, he left right after high school.<eos> He's been back two, three years.<eos> [knocks on door] Tom goes to his Sunday school.<eos> So did danny.
Mandy, honey, can you give us a sec?<eos> Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> Oh, Mandy and I have no secrets. Ah, well, considering your year as a carny, that's disturbing.<eos> April, um...<eos> Look, Mike and I have always been willing to help you, but this... this donor-egg project...<eos> We just don't feel comfortable underwriting it.<eos> I'm sorry, honey.<eos> If we don't help her, how is she gonna start a family, Mom?<eos> Yeah, I don't have anywhere else to turn.<eos> Yes, you do.
Fix up your tin-can Casanova.<eos> But bring me any parts and ammo you find.<eos> And no skimming.<eos> Take this to Matthews.<eos> It should cover the expenses.<eos> And if he don't want it, you keep it, Deunan.<eos> Consider it a early Valentine's gift to add to your collection.<eos> You seemed awfully chummy back there.<eos> Thought you wanted away from Two Horns.<eos> I still do.
He's a nobody.<eos> A hired gun.<eos> That's all.<eos> - Is that what this is about?<eos> - It's about the girl your cyborg kidnapped.<eos> - Do you know?<eos> - If this is about Briareos, I can help you.<eos> But I don't know about any kidnapped girl.<eos> - You know something.<eos> - I don't.
We finish this.<eos> For Olson.<eos> Fortress right on course.<eos> Almost in position.<eos> You're the last one.<eos> Go out big, baby.<eos> If we take out one more cannon, it should create a large enough opening for you.<eos> - It worked.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, it didn't.
We're out.<eos> Well done, Iris.<eos> There's so much I wanted to tell you.<eos> You gave me a reason.<eos> You gave me hope.<eos> So, what's the take?<eos> Not much.<eos> Deunan, she died for something she believed in.<eos> Knowing that doesn't make it any easier.<eos> It never does.
The reasons why don't matter to me.<eos> What I don't understand is... why he didn't tell me.<eos> You know, often people reject what's odd or foreign to them, and I'm sure Brian was afraid he'd lose you.<eos> But I loved him.<eos> I would've accepted him.<eos> If he'd just given me that chance, trusted me, maybe he'd still be alive.<eos> I found footage of the fight that Brian got into outside Madame's Apple.<eos> I thought the club didn't have any security cameras.<eos> They don't.<eos> But the convenience store behind the club does.
We should see if she owns a gun.<eos> I was going to suggest that.<eos> Do you own a gun, Ms. Morrell?<eos> I don't like what you're suggesting.<eos> And I don't like that you're not answering the question.<eos> I don't have to talk to you without a lawyer.<eos> It's a simple question, especially if you're innocent.<eos> The records are easy to check.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do. A .45.
You treat her like she's the village idiot.<eos> - I do not.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> And I need you to tell me that she's not the village idiot.<eos> She is not the village idiot.<eos> I wouldn't let her near the Coopers if she weren't exceedingly capable.<eos> [sighs] Hey, is that the...<eos> A fully functioning robotic leg?<eos> Yes, it is. Well, I thought my absence totally stalled the progress.<eos> It did.
Wait.<eos> She has made so many sacrifices for me, and now I think it's time for me to do the same for her.<eos> Wait.<eos> I have been wanting to leave for a while now, but I just haven't been able to find anyone that I was willing to give the institute to, until now.<eos> Wait. You're offering me your hospital, like you're Willy Wonka and you're handing me a chocolate factory?<eos> Cheer up, Charlie.<eos> You're not serious?<eos> You are serious.<eos> ♪ like a virgin ♪ This place is yours, Cristina, if you want it.<eos> Do you?
On what?<eos> Do you care?<eos> The voir dire process is a very important one, because it enables the court and the lawyers to determine whether or not each of you would be appropriate jurors for this particular case.<eos> Canning's right.<eos> This trial is over in voir dire.<eos> You had in your employment contract that we only need a majority to prevail, so, we just need seven.<eos> Whoever gets the first seven jurors has the upper hand in negotiations.<eos> This isn't about going to trial. This is about getting seven jurors.<eos> It could be the difference between a $200,000 settlement and $8.5 million.<eos> What do I do?
Show-off.<eos> - Hey, guys, um, Abby's tied up, you know, on the...<eos> on the other case, but she wanted me to show this to both of you. Has to do with that asphalt that we pulled from Ensign Tate's head wound.<eos> What about it?<eos> Well, aside from the... usual bituminous sand and tar, she also found trace elements of vegetable oil.<eos> Vegetable oil...<eos> You know, like old, burnt vegetable oil with microscopic bits of potato, bread, onion...<eos> Like from a deep fryer.<eos> Exactly. But I don't remember any fast food joints near there...<eos> No, but apparently they do.
I don't know.<eos> I mean, you talk to god, right?<eos> He talks to whatever he calls it, His spirit guide.<eos> Isn't that sort of the same thing?<eos> Who decides that his messages Are any different from yours?<eos> Of course, if you ask your husband, Both of us are deranged.<eos> Ha. I can't even imagine.<eos> Look, you're so vulnerable now.<eos> Anyone who seems to have answers--<eos> Yeah, but no one does.
Talked to Rick.<eos> Some of them know what you did at the prison.<eos> Daryl, Maggie.<eos> They accept it.<eos> You wouldn't be here if they didn't.<eos> Gonna talk to the rest of them.<eos> Tell them to accept it, too.<eos> They don't have to.<eos> No, they do.<eos> They just do.
Senior year, I gave...<eos> Josh some money for their trip, and, uh, the day he left on that trip... that was the last time I saw him.<eos> Shane told us he decided to stay.<eos> Yeah, sent me a damn e-mail.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> Some B.S. about Western materialism and living the simpler life and said he had found the last paradise on Earth.<eos> And that's when you lost contact?<eos> Well, he e-mailed me for a couple more years.<eos> Mainly, it was just to ask me to wire him some money.<eos> And did you?
We missed you at bobby's funeral.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I had a thing. With aiden.<eos> Well, you haven't seen him much.<eos> No.<eos> Bobby's folks, they appreciated the flowers.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Did you get a chance to follow up on his autopsy, Like I said?<eos> I did.
Yeah. That's my shorthand.<eos> WPF-- "when pigs fly""<eos> I didn't believe a word the guy said.<eos> Ah.<eos> All right, I think we got the visual perfect here.<eos> But we're missing something.<eos> What are we missing?<eos> Odor.<eos> Oh, I didn't know you wanted to go that far.<eos> Uh, I don't.
Or what's left of 'em.<eos> Peggy, I'm... (sighs) I'm not gonna pretend to know what you're going through but...<eos> I do think you should see a doctor so you know what you're going through.<eos> He's just gonna tell me what I don't want to hear.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> Then what am I gonna do?<eos> What if I can't manage on my own?<eos> You sure as hell don't want to take care of me.<eos> I don't.
Who's counting?<eos> Because I do like some people with PDS.<eos> Very few.<eos> You...in fact.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Not long now.<eos> I'm awake, too, so it's no good thinking about gnawing your own arm off.<eos> I thought maybe I could leave that to you, given...<eos> I didn't know you made jokes.<eos> I don't.
See?<eos> He's not far gone.<eos> He'll be okay.<eos> Whoa, take it easy.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> What are you going to do with him?<eos> Put him in the lock-up. Someone will drop by, take him to the non-compliant detention centre in t'morning.<eos> I hear it's nice there.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> He didn't do anything.
Then find me one.<eos> Not here.<eos> Somewhere off the grid, where all of us can be safe.<eos> Somewhere far away.<eos> You can do that, right, Winter?<eos> It's not true, is it?<eos> Bo, I'm talking to you.<eos> Winter couldn't do that, could he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't.
Your significant other is about to submit his entire life to public scrutiny.<eos> If you think this is bad, wait until the press gets a hold of you.<eos> I am someone who interrogates people for a living, so I do think that I can handle whatever it is that the press throws at me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then tell me about your first marriage.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, you're about to re-marry a man you divorced only a year and a half ago.<eos> That's kind of weird, right?<eos> - You want to explain it?<eos> - No, I don't.
That's the best idea I've heard all night.<eos> Excuse us, fellas.<eos> You were amazing tonight.<eos> Really?<eos> You were completely charming.<eos> - All the donors loved you. - Oh.<eos> You should feel great.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I do.
Left a nasty scar. That's all.<eos> So wait, they quit your ass after you took on three bangers by yourself?<eos> They gave me a commendation.<eos> I quit my own ass.<eos> I never met anybody that tight before.<eos> Tight?<eos> Brave.<eos> I wasn't brave. I was just drunk.<eos> Don't feel sorry for me.<eos> I don't.
Joe, please. Save your theory on intelligent life-forms of the universe for a Ted talk.<eos> Explain her memory loss, and the fact that she hasn't aged in decades.<eos> Maybe the dome sent her. It sent my mom.<eos> Hey! No, Melanie's a person.<eos> The dome sent an avatar. You can't grab an avatar.<eos> Okay, whatever she is, let's not manhandle her.<eos> And since there's no way she's actually Melanie Cross, then we probably shouldn't call her that.<eos> Then what should we call her?<eos> I should know what my name is.<eos> But I don't.
- Hiya.<eos> There aren't many mums who'd let their sons run off to join the circus.<eos> But my mum did.<eos> And she used to worry about my weight and she tried to give me salad.<eos> But she meant well.<eos> And after my dad died we were a team.<eos> Like Stoke City.<eos> We were a team. And she worried about me.<eos> And she didn't have to worry about me.<eos> But she did anyway.
Stick with the colds and flus, okay?<eos> Hey, Landry.<eos> You remember Scott, right?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I heard you were taking over trauma.<eos> Thinking about it.<eos> Oh, that should be interesting.<eos> So Jordan tells me that you're seeing T.C. now.<eos> - Oh, did she?
Look, Topher and Janet will be okay.<eos> Her labor took 12 hours the last time, so... hopefully she'll be back before her water even breaks.<eos> And we need you downstairs.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Scott is an excellent surgeon.<eos> Yeah, he's good.<eos> I just don't like...<eos> Anyone telling you what to do?<eos> Who does?
It's okay, everybody!<eos> This has happened before.<eos> The generators will kick on again in just a few seconds.<eos> Okay, this is not a drill.<eos> We are out of power.<eos> Everybody, keep manually bagging your patients.<eos> We don't know how long this is gonna last.<eos> Ragosa, what happened?<eos> I thought we had enough fuel.<eos> We do.
I feel quite nervous. And I'm not even going.<eos> We'll choose the clothes carefully so you can take them on and off without my help.<eos> Well, I'll have his help.<eos> Honestly, my lady. You'd better hope I never write my memoirs.<eos> There is one thing I've got to ask you.<eos> ~ I'm really sorry, but I must.<eos> I have to sure there aren't any...consequences.<eos> What sort of consequences?<eos> Well, you know.<eos> No, I don't.
Just pull the trigger, OK?<eos> On 3.<eos> 1... 2... 3!<eos> Do it!<eos> Just wait!<eos> Just do it! I can't!<eos> Just do it! I can't! Do it now!<eos> Nora Jamison Durst, you have provided the appropriate documentation, certifying the respondents' status as "Departed"?<eos> Yes, I have. And you wish to dissolve the marriage between yourself, the plaintiff, and the respondent, Douglas Isaac Durst?<eos> I do.
The last time he kept a secret from me was smoking cigarettes with the wrestling team behind Papa Gino's, remember?<eos> You do realize you're talking about high school.<eos> - Listen, can't you just find out something for me? - [Elevator bell dings]<eos> Okay.<eos> But I... I think you're being paranoid, okay?<eos> And I don't think Frankie is smoking.<eos> Or wrestling.<eos> I'm not paranoid.<eos> - I'm protective. - [Elevator bell dings]<eos> How you doing, Frankie?
I'm sorry, I don't.<eos> Pua...<eos> Kai.<eos> Pro Bowl weekend last year.<eos> I helped you crack a monster case.<eos> Oh, yeah, right!<eos> Now I remember!<eos> I figured you would.<eos> Uh, you may also remember, we kind of had a moment.<eos> Yeah... we did, didn't we?
Grandad!<eos> Come away, he'll hurt you!<eos> He's fine, love.<eos> You see?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Everything's under control.<eos> Now, the penguin with the white flipper? He's eating.<eos> Sidney needs his lice powder.<eos> Lizzie did it.
Everyone in Upton knows my business by now - it's hardly a secret.<eos> Yes, no, but it's the Mottersheads that YOU'LL damage by association.<eos> Isn't it better just to stay out of it?<eos> Why is it so important to raise your head above the parapet for Mottershead of all people?<eos> I could ask you the same.<eos> Why go out on a limb and make such an effort to stop a man like George?<eos> He pushes his luck.<eos> He... ignores the wishes of the majority, he blindly pursues his own will.<eos> - You may find that heroic.<eos> - I do.
And what was it like there?<eos> Were there gelatin shots?<eos> No. No, it was stupid and loud.<eos> Honestly, you're better off.<eos> I suppose. I had a fine night.<eos> I had some palak paneer and I watched a documentary about Liberia.<eos> But then I woke up to this unexpected development.<eos> Do you... Do you really want Erlich on the board?<eos> - Because I'll support you... - No.<eos> I don't. At all.
And if you could ever use someone with my business-development skill set,<eos> - I would love to be a part of this.<eos> - The fuck you will be.<eos> We'll call you when we want pleated khakis.<eos> You know this is a fucking domestic?<eos> Why were you so mean to him?<eos> He wasn't spying on us.<eos> He just said he likes us.<eos> - He wants to join the company.<eos> - Of course he does, Richard.
You've seen my daughter.<eos> You can move along.<eos> There's kids here.<eos> I'm looking for a kid... my kid.<eos> And I said, "move along."<eos> Mr. Hopkins.<eos> How can we help you?<eos> My daughter came to stay here after when I was in jail?<eos> Emily?<eos> No, Mr. Hopkins. She did not.
Go.<eos> Go on!<eos> Out of my sight!<eos> Isaac the fornicator!<eos> George.<eos> George!<eos> George!<eos> Hello, father.<eos> Told you I'd get out.<eos> Yes, you did.
Charles sent me 12 long-stem roses in a crystal vase and she took 'em.<eos> I was right at the photocopier when she came in preparing her shit, and somehow-- 'cause I put the card in my purse,<eos> I guess because it said, "I love you so"-- she thought they were hers.<eos> Well, it was an honest mistake.<eos> Who the hell is sending her flowers?<eos> Why didn't you say something?<eos> It was too late.<eos> I tried.<eos> - You tried?<eos> - I really did.
Well, what are you trying to do, Don?<eos> Are you taking lunches now?<eos> No, I'm just looking for love.<eos> Well, on behalf of myself and all the millionaires at McCann Erickson, we'd love a chance to tell you how handsome you are.<eos> Move along, Jim.<eos> Tell Mary I picked up the check, because I just did.<eos> I don't have to crap on McCann for you, do I?<eos> I almost worked there.<eos> Twice.<eos> But you didn't.
'Cause I don't.<eos> I keep replaying it over and over in my head.<eos> What color was the light?<eos> Did I check the cross traffic?<eos> But I don't know.<eos> Cruz, listen to me.<eos> Welch thinks you screwed up.<eos> Who cares?<eos> He doesn't know you.<eos> But everybody at 51 does.
Gabe...<eos> - Look, I know that Cat thinks that I had something to do with Heather's kidnapping, but you got to talk to her, because she doesn't have all of the facts...<eos> Don't make this harder than it has to be.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I think you know what's going on.<eos> You're wanted for questioning in the disappearance of Jack Watson.<eos> Cuff him.<eos> All clear.<eos> I don't have a key.<eos> I do.
Uh, more specifically, a cell phone road map.<eos> Gabe's cell phone.<eos> Now, all phones communicate wirelessly with the nearest tower, then get handed off to the next as we travel, right?<eos> When you're making a call.<eos> No, but even when we're not.<eos> If your cell's turned on, it's always communicating with the nearest tower, just like Gabe's was.<eos> Well, why wouldn't he turn it off?<eos> Who turns off their cell phones?<eos> Nobody.<eos> And... lucky for us, neither did Gabe.
Why wouldn't he just go in the front door, ring the doorbell?<eos> Where was his wife?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, so you just happened to be on patrol when Mr. Harris was climbing over his fence?<eos> And why wasn't the motion sensor working?<eos> You know they've got one, right?<eos> Look, ma'am, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to step back.<eos> - Yeah, but...<eos> Hey, we got to go. We're so late.<eos> No, we don't.

It's my problem.<eos> You should just go home. Just go home, go to bed, And we'll forget this ever happened.<eos> We'll forget we were ever friends.<eos> Is that what you want,<eos> To forget that you ever knew me?<eos> Of course not.<eos> And no one has to know about this--<eos> Not tom, Not your parents.<eos> I have to tell them.<eos> You don't.
Not tom, not your parents.<eos> (danny) I have to tell them. You can't.<eos> What are you doing to him? What are you doing? Stop!<eos> Leave him, dad!<eos> He's my friend!<eos> (joe) stop, stop!<eos> Come on.<eos> Go home.<eos> But-- go to bed.<eos> Don't do anything.
This is a courtesy call.<eos> I wanted to let you know you should get your affairs in order.<eos> What?<eos> My affairs?<eos> I know you're working with Carlos Solano.<eos> - You think I'm doing what? - How's that happen?<eos> How do you go from busting gangs to working with a cartel?<eos> Agent Warren, you have me confused with someone else.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Why the hell would he be headed there? I don't know.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> After the place blows, you make sure you grab Lawrence. I'll deal with Solano.<eos> All right.<eos> - Everything all right?<eos> - Yeah, just work.<eos> - Turn around, okay?<eos> The feds are gonna hit the garage.<eos> - What? - Listen to me.<eos> - How did...
If he knew this place existed, don't you think he'd make a move to shut it down like he did with the buses?<eos> Well, he still might.<eos> Couple more days, see if he makes a play.<eos> Couple days?<eos> These aren't guns in crates or drugs in shipping containers.<eos> These are girls, and they're locked up in there like cattle.<eos> If we don't get all the guys, there's just gonna be more girls, okay?<eos> I don't like the cost of this either.<eos> - You don't even know the costs.<eos> - Yes, I do.
They were 70% of the structure of this house.<eos> Peter, please tell me this is covered by our insurance.<eos> Sorry, Lois, it doesn't cover acts of "dog."<eos> Hey, guys, I-I think the tomato juice is really working. Don't you? No.<eos> You smell like my six-foot-tall German girlfriend.<eos> Christopher, are you ready to go to the Guttenschvartzen?<eos> Hell, da!<eos> She can swim across the pool in two strokes.<eos> Wh... I don't know what else to do.<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> He's right.<eos> And I'll tell you one more thing I'm gonna do...<eos> I'm gonna toss you an apology.<eos> But I should warn you, my sister and I come from the same fiery Sicilian bloodline, okay?<eos> So if I toss you this apology, and you don't accept it,<eos> It's a-gonna be a problem, eh?<eos> You want me to toss you this apology or not?<eos> I do, Danny.
What happened?<eos> There was an explosion.<eos> But it's over, and you're fine, okay?<eos> You're gonna be just fine.<eos> The patient in bed four is awake.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ♪ it's no better to be safe than sorry ♪ Bailey: I would have thought, you know, now that you're minister of education or whatever that you could tell the stupid board...<eos> I don't control the budget, Bailey.<eos> W-well, did you at least fight for me to keep my lab?<eos> No, I did not.
I need you.<eos> What happened in El Paso?<eos> Yovani was inappropriate.<eos> He touched me.<eos> How he touch you?<eos> In a way I didn't want to be touched.<eos> So... you kill him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I told him not to touch you.<eos> He did.
They have toilets inside.<eos> You know I'm pee shy dude.<eos> - Gay or straight? - Straight.<eos> - Hey, what are we going to say?<eos> - We're straight.<eos> Gay or straight?<eos> Straight. Wait.<eos> Why would you ask me that and not him?<eos> Don't we get one phone call?<eos> Yeah, we do.
I didn't kill your brother.<eos> Well, I'm told otherwise.<eos> And I think I'll trust my source over a fugitive.<eos> You saved her, and then you took out everybody that tried to hurt her-- including Ray.<eos> Wait, that was you?<eos> You're the one who saved me?<eos> Okay, look, you've got it all wrong.<eos> Lowan is trying to pin this on me, okay?<eos> He is the one who killed your brother and I have a witness to prove it to you.<eos> You do?
- But not smart enough.<eos> Strike three.<eos> At least I'm to scale.<eos> You are so, so not to scale.<eos> Look at those things on your chest.<eos> Those things are perfect in form and balance.<eos> Look at you.<eos> You're all leg.<eos> Well, I'm exactly to scale because, you know, Susie doesn't guess.<eos> Well, she does now.
Ricky is not a violent person.<eos> He was provoked.<eos> He's not built for that place, Tony.<eos> He pretends when I talk to him, makes it sound okay.<eos> [Clicks tongue] Just know he's suffering in there.<eos> It's been very hard for your mom, Bravo.<eos> It's enough she has to worry about you.<eos> You got contacts. Couldn't you put in a good word for him?<eos> Tried, Javi.<eos> I did.
I tried to talk to her, but she hung up.<eos> You have to tell her to relax.<eos> She really is doing well as the new girl in town.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well, then,<eos> I don't want to take up any more of your precious time.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> It's the Clios.<eos> Who cares?<eos> I do.
- What do you mean?<eos> - Don't bother him.<eos> He'll know.<eos> Come here.<eos> Chevalier Blanc has started Chevalier Noir.<eos> That's "night," or "black."<eos> Either way, it's the opposite of Blanc.<eos> And we're supposed to work up print based on this voiceover tagline, "More horsepower."<eos> And you gotta see the words, but it ends with a freeze-frame.<eos> What does?
The TV spot.<eos> Oh. I assume you have storyboards.<eos> Exit stage left.<eos> What have you been up to, Don?<eos> Just RR mostly.<eos> Do you want to see the strategy?<eos> Sure.<eos> What happened to the storyboards from Chevalier Noir?<eos> She gave them to Lou.<eos> What do I do?
- No. You eat them.<eos> I don't want them.<eos> Eat your candy.<eos> Your shoes.<eos> What about her?<eos> I just discovered you're our best hope to explain why Don Draper is downstairs.<eos> He came to me in remorse and said he's ready to come back.<eos> Ah, I see.<eos> Well, unfortunately, we fired him.<eos> No, we didn't.
I want a fair discount...<eos> Rs. 90,000, final price.<eos> Huh? ! How much did you say?<eos> The one on your iPad was around Rs. 5 lakhs, right?<eos> What a discount!<eos> Wait. This is a Manish Malhotra original gown?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> A hundred percent original fake.<eos> Sir, did Gurpreet Sodhi buy her wedding gown from here?<eos> Yes, she did! A")!
Indian men are useless!<eos> Sitting with their feet up, with the newspaper...<eos> Get me tea, get me food!<eos> That's all!<eos> All Indian men are not like that, Granny.<eos> All the men we've seen are like that.<eos> Do you like my sweater, sir?<eos> Exactly like yours, right?<eos> Nice.<eos> How did you like Angad's cooking? Yeah... very nice.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> What the hell are YOU doing?<eos> ! Are you here to marry me or attend Angad's wedding? !<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Angad's parents are coming tomorrow itself!<eos> Now, you have only tonight.<eos> Tomorrow my father will ask you why Angad is wrong for me.<eos> What are you going to say?<eos> Don't look away, Humpty!<eos> What do I do?
Or should I ask, who?<eos> I need to drop something off to a friend.<eos> - Right now?<eos> - I said after dinner.<eos> Your sister has been gone for nearly a...<eos> Then I will wait till she goes asleep, okay?<eos> What makes you think she can sleep?<eos> Her mother is still not here, and I am thinking you're the only one who knows where she is.<eos> Think what you want.<eos> I don't.
She better haul us because I'm guessing Jason is not making too many more stops tonight.<eos> Guys, please, enough with Jason for a minute.<eos> Mona knows that we were in New York.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> Okay, it's only a matter of time before she runs out of whistles and start tearing our balloons and say Aria killed Shana.<eos> - Okay, whistles?<eos> - Aria, stop.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mona does not know about Shana.<eos> Then who does?
That time stamp means that your mother wrote that 2 hours after the last time anybody saw her at that police station.<eos> And she never finished writing it.<eos> She didn't even enter an address to whom she meant to send.<eos> Maybe she changed her mind.<eos> What would make her do that?<eos> What would make you change your mind?<eos> A message like that... is something that I would want to deliver personally.<eos> So she got up from her computer, she walked out the front door and she went to go tell somebody that Ali was alive and that things were falling apart faster than anybody could fix them.<eos> Too bad she never got to give the message.<eos> What if she did?
Nice to meet you.<eos> Oh, looks like I got here just in time.<eos> Your hug vitals are low. Oh.<eos> When was the last time you had your neck examined? Mmm. CAHILL:<eos> (laughs) (Catherine giggles)<eos> Don't worry. I'm a doctor.<eos> WILFRED:<eos> Hey, dickweed, check it out.<eos> You're not the only tripod on the block anymore.<eos> Wilfred, how you doing, little fella?
What-what does that mean?<eos> You're a god, right?<eos> Well, I did rise from the dead, yeah.<eos> Well, then, I guess you should know what that means.<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> It doesn't work at all.<eos> I mean, if you're a god, why didn't you know the truth about my father?<eos> You didn't even know you were a god.<eos> Admit it, you have no idea where we're going.<eos> Yes, I do.
Hi.<eos> Wait, don't you have a show to do?<eos> That's right.<eos> All right. I knew this was coming.<eos> Everybody give me your best shot. Oh, my God.<eos> Where do I even begin?<eos> You know, it's not a good sign that this is the first time a lot of people are realizing you had a show.<eos> Your logo was stupid.<eos> It looked like a big, purple penis and your ratings blew.<eos> We did about the same as Bob's Burgers.
You're not alone.<eos> Neither is Bo, ever.<eos> She's alone right now, Winter, somewhere.<eos> If that Dani girl hurts her... that is not going to happen.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> 'Cause I think I know where Dani took her.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wait.<eos> We want the same thing, you know.<eos> No, we don't.
Or, cos they've lived such a long time, they've got so many stories, they never runs out.<eos> And... I don't mind even hearing a story twice, cos it's so interesting.<eos> Your grandad's interesting.<eos> He's got loads of stories.<eos> He's brilliant.<eos> Yeah, but he can't hear what you say back.<eos> Just listen, then.<eos> Well, will you teach me to make them pretend dragonflies, what fools the fish?<eos> I don't know how.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay. Sorry to make you wait.<eos> Yeah, in the middle of the night.<eos> So, you brought the serum?<eos> Actually, I didn't.<eos> - Right.<eos> Because none of this is real, right, Gabe?<eos> Look, I'm not doing this story.<eos> I don't believe Vincent's a beast, or that they even exist.<eos> Well, they do.
I-I just couldn't do it.<eos> Mr. Gaines said it was a formality, that the execution would be stayed again, but...<eos> Anyway, I just kept walking up and down the stairs, checking the clock.<eos> Finally, I-I came out here.<eos> I saw my bike. Your dad heard the garage open and came out and asked me what was I doing.<eos> I said, "I'm... I'm gonna take a ride."<eos> "No, you're not." "Yes, I am."<eos> "Janet, don't make me get in the car and follow you."<eos> I said, "let me be."<eos> And he did.
An Espheni.<eos> Don't question Lexi like this, Ben.<eos> Shut up, Lourdes.<eos> Please drop the high-priestess routine.<eos> You're not fooling anyone.<eos> Yes.<eos> I talked to an Espheni, just like I talk to all of you.<eos> I'm the bridge between the species.<eos> I trusted you, Lexi.<eos> We all did.
You lied to me, Lexi.<eos> When did I lie to you, Maggie?<eos> I told you we'd be safe here, and we are.<eos> I told you that non-violence is the answer, and it is.<eos> Why are you meeting with an Espheni behind our backs?<eos> Because...<eos> He's a part of me.<eos> It's who I am.<eos> What do they really want?<eos> The same thing I do, the same thing we all do -- peace.
But I didn't give in.<eos> The more I told myself to be strong, the stronger I got.<eos> You're stronger than you think, Mira.<eos> I saw some wire cutters in the maintenance shed during chore detail.<eos> Tell me you didn't take them.<eos> Mira, they don't miss anything around here.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I'm just saying... We could cut the fence -- How far do you think we're gonna get?<eos> I thought you wanted to escape.<eos> I do.
I didn't think that I could be played, Dante, but you played me.<eos> With your stories about your wife and how your relationship withered because of work.<eos> Tell me, are you married, Dante?<eos> The real you?<eos> You are married. And she left you. Because of work, right?<eos> Tell lies close to the truth... isn't that the trick?<eos> Does she know that you slept with me?<eos> Whatever it takes to stop people like you. She understands that.<eos> Oh, she understands, but she doesn't know.<eos> Neither do you. About your own father.
You put Josh on your "Thirty Under Thirty" list and I'll put Gabi on your "Girl-Under-Girl list.<eos> Deal.<eos> Crushed it!<eos> List made.<eos> What's the good news, my man?<eos> Logan found someone in this room very impressive.<eos> Yes!<eos> Thirty Under Thirty!<eos> I'm gonna go call Caroline and tell her the good news.<eos> You do that!
Elliot, I hate you so much right now.<eos> The next time I see you, I'm gonna...<eos> - Hey!<eos> - God, you're cute.<eos> No, I'm not!<eos> You should see me without makeup.<eos> - Arf, arf.<eos> - I bet you're fetching. Get it?<eos> Remember that time where you said that we could take things slow?<eos> Oh, you don't?
Jeez, somebody's gaydar's on the Fritz!<eos> I think you're the one who's straight.<eos> I love women and boobs and chopping firewood.<eos> Then what's he talking about?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's just some jealous ex-boyfriend.<eos> He's the person that I slept with who made me realize that I am so over men and way into the lady business.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - I don't know what's happening.<eos> I do.
So did 15,000 other people.<eos> He's the only one murdered last week with classified intelligence documents on his laptop.<eos> You're accusing me of espionage.<eos> Security protocols.<eos> DoD ciphers.<eos> Everything you need to infiltrate our intelligence systems.<eos> I am the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.<eos> This guy's murder is connected to your daughter and our two dead NCIS agents-- why?<eos> I told you I have no idea.<eos> And, clearly, neither do you.
Look, there's no rule that says you have to walk into school with her tomorrow.<eos> Well, it's not written down but it's understood.<eos> We're gonna walk down those hallways with Ali and everyone will think what they've always thought.<eos> Which is what?<eos> That we're her puppets.<eos> But you're not.<eos> So who cares what they think?<eos> Hey. People know who you are, Hanna.<eos> They do?<eos> 'Cause lately I don't.
Does Alison know?<eos> What you think he did to her mom?<eos> It's not the kind of information that I want to arm her with until I know for sure that he did it.<eos> So if action is character, then who is Alison now?<eos> Been reading Fitzgerald?<eos> I've been re-reading Fitzgerald.<eos> I already know Alison's story but I find it hard to picture her as a victim.<eos> She seems really genuine when she says that what she's been through changed her.<eos> And I want to believe her.<eos> But you don't.
No one told me.<eos> I was there!<eos> She was there.<eos> It was 1927.<eos> I was 10 years old.<eos> Which would make you...?<eos> You do the math, junior.<eos> Ilona was your best friend, and you were supposed to take the trolley that day with her to the beach.<eos> Did you go? No.<eos> Uh, ilona did.
Do you want to tell me about your dream?<eos> Pretty scary, huh?<eos> Well, dreams are just your subconscious Trying to make sense out of what happens to you during the day.<eos> What's a subconscious?<eos> The secret part of you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, there's the part of you That's here with me right now. And there's another part of you<eos> That just belongs to you. I don't think I have that part.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Everybody does.
No, he stays.<eos> I want him.<eos> He has a mother already.<eos> You gave him to her.<eos> I want him back.<eos> Too late.<eos> Live with it.<eos> I'll come back for him.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I do.
Marshall, I'm Sheriff Longmire.<eos> You think you could show us the way?<eos> You mean I gotta go back up there?<eos> Been here two weeks.<eos> Last night was solo night.<eos> We all had to be out here completely alone.<eos> Not supposed to come back to camp till 24 hours is up.<eos> It's intense, right?<eos> So, what made you come back early?<eos> I didn't.
I assume Vic told you about that.<eos> She told me about it.<eos> I just wanted to see how you'd react when you saw the picture.<eos> Little tactic I learned from my wife.<eos> Huh. What'd Vic say about the photo?<eos> Did she know what this means?<eos> I-I-I haven't talked to her about it yet.<eos> Just lead to an argument.<eos> She'd probably think I had someone following her.<eos> Did you?
Of course.<eos> Ready when you are, Captain. Good.<eos> Then we won't waste time on pleasantries.<eos> I'm sure the name Fu'ad Hansur means something to you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Parsa gave up Hansur as his second in command during my interrogation.<eos> Hansur evaded our roundup, but today he showed his face.<eos> On behalf of the Brotherhood, he released a video claiming responsibility for the break.<eos> Thought you said he didn't have the funding to pull this off.<eos> They don't.
You've pitted yourself against them from the start.<eos> How can you retreat from that position?<eos> You mean I've made it 'them or me'?<eos> Haven't you?<eos> You despise the family, but I think you forget my wife was one of them.<eos> My child IS one of them.<eos> Where does that leave me?<eos> Don't you despise them?<eos> Really?<eos> No, I don't.
Is that all you got? .<eos> We didn't find any explosives.<eos> Must've been a false alarm.<eos> Turn off the jamming device.<eos> Come out, come out, wherever you are.<eos> Bitch!<eos> Run for it, bitch.<eos> What are you gonna do about my 2 million?<eos> .<eos> How did you do it? .
Is he nuts? !<eos> Stop!<eos> What a fucking moron...<eos> I just want to talk...<eos> I really don't know!<eos> All I want to know is... the reason why Park's looking for Lee.<eos> I don't know, I swear!<eos> Please let me go, okay?<eos> You really don't?<eos> I don't! Fuck you!
Let's go.<eos> Tao: ... At which point we made a visual identification of our victim, who was...<eos> Hey, mom, that's my friend, Lieutenant Tao.<eos> Guess they're out on another murder.<eos> Um, by the way, I made a list of everything that you gave me since I've been here.<eos> I even did the lip balm.<eos> But I have no idea how much any of this stuff costs, so if you could just total it up and bring it back to me.<eos> Mom, I told you yesterday<eos> - you don't have to pay me back for anything.<eos> - No, I do.
Tell me why you did that.<eos> I suppose I was... seeking counsel.<eos> From the man who put him on death row... made his whole career out of it.<eos> It's assault, Ted, sexual assault.<eos> That's a very serious crime.<eos> If Janet finds out about this, I don't know if she could come back from it.<eos> But if I don't tell her now and she hears it from somewhere else...<eos> You see my dilemma.<eos> He wasn't even out a week, Ted.<eos> Not seven days before he did this to Teddy.
Amantha."<eos> I have to be honest with you, Charlie Chaplain.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I thought you'd be funnier.<eos> Thank you, Miss Becky.<eos> You turd.<eos> I just wanted to see your home away from home.<eos> It's, uh, well-lit.<eos> Jon told me that your shift ends soon.<eos> Did he, now?
Which one?<eos> - Echols.<eos> - Never heard of it.<eos> It's not convenient.<eos> Of course it isn't.<eos> So... what about Christmas?<eos> Or birthdays?<eos> Will they let you visit?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I'm afraid the service is ended.<eos> I was hoping to speak to more than just a few of the die-hard faithful.<eos> Where's the rest of your flock got to?<eos> - Paris, France?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Ooh, you don't want to go and live there.<eos> They never bathe.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I heard they don't have showers in their houses.<eos> Of course they do.
Is that the only reason?<eos> Is there something going on between you two? No.<eos> Then why did you bring him to Emily's last night?<eos> Okay, we had a slip.<eos> A slip?<eos> Well, technically, it was two slips.<eos> Aria! I thought you said that you were never gonna go there again.<eos> I meant it when I said it.<eos> Are you forgetting about what he did to you?<eos> What he did to us?
Well, it sounded like you are making plans to go somewhere.<eos> Were you?<eos> Alison. I can't live in a world where I jump every time the doorbell rings.<eos> So what?<eos> You're just gonna run away?<eos> Please don't tell the girls or try to stop me.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Say that you were kidnapped again?<eos> Do you think I want to live like this?<eos> Because I don't.
So whoever dropped off that picture had to have done it after I arrived but before Tanner came.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, now we wait. You know, I've been thinking... maybe you should tell Tanner the truth about Shana.<eos> You know, that she was the one that shot you.<eos> Where's this coming from?<eos> Ezra, you lied to the police.<eos> You could get into serious trouble.<eos> But if I tell the truth now, they're gonna know I've been covering something up.<eos> Oh, God, I hate that I dragged you into this mess.<eos> Hey, hey. You didn't.
Yeah.<eos> What's it supposed to be? It's a drawing of my mother.<eos> We think that Bethany drew that while she was in there.<eos> So they did know each other.<eos> Doesn't look like Bethany liked your mom too much.<eos> Really?<eos> What gave it away?<eos> Was it the demon or the spear?<eos> - What did Eddie say?<eos> - He didn't.
Is that dad?<eos> It was.<eos> Are we moving back home?<eos> Yes.<eos> But your father's moving out.<eos> We decided it was the best thing for everyone.<eos> You both decided this?<eos> I don't understand though.<eos> I thought you said that everything went well, that you believed him that he was telling the truth.<eos> I do.
No fair.<eos> - Don't show my face. - Shut up.<eos> Don't show my face.<eos> - All right, give me that.<eos> I am serious, little missy.<eos> - You mess with the bull...<eos> - Don't cry.<eos> God!<eos> I love it when you record me.<eos> No, really, I do.
I can't wait to introduce you to my mom.<eos> Fuck this shit.<eos> 100 bucks or no 100 bucks.<eos> Keep driving.<eos> Maybe I'll make your retarded friend strip next, huh?<eos> A little threesome.<eos> What a turn on you are, yeah.<eos> So good, baby.<eos> Wait a second. I know you.<eos> Millions of guys do, thanks to your website.
Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because you're broke, Erich.<eos> Your company is gone.<eos> Salter is gone.<eos> Ivana is gone.<eos> Wilkerson is gone.<eos> Daniels is gone.<eos> Well, at least I've still got you.<eos> No, you don't.
First female GM in NHL history?<eos> Hey, where'd that barrier go?<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> Valerie broke it down.<eos> Oh, yeah. That's gonna have to wait.<eos> I actually came out here to reschedule.<eos> Everyone is calling me with trade proposals.<eos> It's amazing how many people want to play with the Rangers.<eos> Well, I know I do.<eos> Yeah, he does!
Well, at the moment...<eos> You know, it seems like you're getting to know my thigh.<eos> Hey, what did I miss?<eos> How do you think it's going?<eos> Hard to say.<eos> Right now it looks like they're just feeling each other out.<eos> Oh my God, Ben, thank you.<eos> She actually likes you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Some women actually do.
- Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> And you need to believe her.<eos> Okay?<eos> You don't want to mess this thing up.<eos> Trust me, I did, and I've never regretted anything so much in my entire life.<eos> Is that true?<eos> It's so true.<eos> But you don't still feel that way, do you?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
All right.<eos> On three.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Knock-knock.<eos> Child services.<eos> Yeah, you really should get used to hearing that.<eos> Danny, just put her down.<eos> It's not like she has a limited number of steps in her.<eos> Well, what if she does?
- Oh, I don't care.<eos> I know all of his secrets.<eos> But you don't know him very well.<eos> You're right. You're right.<eos> It's just I'm looking at you and seeing how, well, disorganized this all is.<eos> And I don't think he'd stand for that.<eos> I don't think he'd trust you to make your own plans.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing here.<eos> This is a dumb idea. No, no, I mean, he wants to help, I'm sure, in his way.<eos> We both do.
- It's ted.<eos> Ted's on the phone.<eos> Hello.<eos> I've seen the work so far.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> And what would you do?<eos> I would use everything at my disposal to win it.<eos> If you think george payton will prefer it, I'm not going to ignore that.<eos> You know that she's every bit as good As any woman in this business!<eos> I do.
You want to tell me what?<eos> I kissed Joe.<eos> I know. I just wanted to feel normal for a minute.<eos> Melanie, you are normal.<eos> I died.<eos> Nothing about me is normal.<eos> Why am I even here?<eos> Because I'm connected to some egg?<eos> And no one even knows where it is.<eos> Actually, I do.
Yes. Let me get this straight, father cowens -- You were willing to steal evidence<eos> To help a buddy solve a riddle? Brendan was an esteemed member of my church.<eos> It was clear that something was weighing heavy on his heart, And he needed my help to free himself.<eos> I see that as my job, detective.<eos> Isn't that what confession's for?<eos> [ chuckles ] well, I'm a fan of the ritual.<eos> But it doesn't always give people what they need.<eos> So he didn't confess anything That seems relevant to my investigation?<eos> Well, if he had, I wouldn't discuss that with you.<eos> But no, he did not.
Straight through the uprights.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Very nice. How do I look? Oh!<eos> Uh... Well, that's a very challenging palette For you, angela, but you seem to be pulling it off.<eos> [ sighs ] damn.<eos> What can I do to look worse?<eos> Ma, you look like a russian nesting doll.<eos> What is up? I'm breaking up with sean today And I didn't want to look too good.<eos> And then dump him would be cruel. I-I thought that you liked lieutenant cavanaugh?<eos> I do, very much.
No cash in it. But could be she wasn't carrying any.<eos> Okay, I'll check with the patrols, see if there were any late-night robberies in the vicinity.<eos> Well, she's married.<eos> Friend gave me his name.<eos> Judson, C.E.O. of a tech start-up.<eos> I pulled his phone number from the victim's phone.<eos> The dress doesn't exactly scream "homemaker."<eos> - No. - Did you check to see if he called<eos> - when she didn't come home?<eos> - Yep. - Did he?
Yeah, she did say once that you got motor oil out of her communion dress.<eos> Yeah. Kind of.<eos> I-I bought her a new one.<eos> - So you kind of didn't.<eos> - It's mom logic.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> Yeah, it will be to Jane when she finds out.<eos> She doesn't want to hurt Jack's feelings.<eos> She doesn't?
So, I cock the hammer, close my eyes and fire... ..and its fucking head explodes.<eos> You are so badass.<eos> Where were this?<eos> Roarton.<eos> No, where in Roarton?<eos> The Save'n'Shop.<eos> Um...<eos> Jem?<eos> I was wondering if you had a partner for the show-and-tell tomorrow.<eos> Cos if you didn't...
BLAIRE: Do you see...<eos> BLAIRE: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!<eos> (ALARM BEEPING) (MUSIC PLAYING)<eos> What is that?<eos> It's an alarm I set for tomorrow.<eos> We have a test. -We do?<eos> -Yeah, it's...<eos> Mitch, do you hate me?<eos> I don't hate you, Blaire.<eos> -You don't?
OK. I always wishes there was a cat there.<eos> I wish there...<eos> Oh! Next time, we should draw a cat.<eos> Good idea.<eos> It's a true story.<eos> Don't see any fruit.<eos> Oh, there's fruit, love.<eos> I got a kumquat up my rectum.<eos> The dwarf can't believe his luck.<eos> 'We do loads of classes. Every week, art, book club, yoga.'
We're just looking at ostriches.<eos> Emus. What's the difference?<eos> Rod Hull had an emu.<eos> Bernie Clifton was on an ostrich.<eos> That's how I tells, anyway.<eos> Anyway. I just... just want to get it out there, mate.<eos> What?<eos> All those problems we've been having, me and Janice.<eos> I dunno.<eos> Yeah, you do.
All those problems we've been having, me and Janice.<eos> I dunno.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> Yeah. She left me.<eos> Been putting it about a bit.<eos> Word on the street, she's now called the hefty gobbler.<eos> Nah, we're better than ever now.<eos> Sex.<eos> I dunno.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I'll take the top bunk.<eos> I think that one's more your style.<eos> You should sleep.<eos> I'll take first watch.<eos> - This is locked up pretty tight. - I know.<eos> Then we're good, then. I'll keep first watch.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> You said we get to start over. Yeah.<eos> Did you?
Cady...<eos> Bail hearings are about people.<eos> If you want the Judge to grant bail, you need to prove to him that your client is an honorable person.<eos> Right.<eos> Bring out his family... preferably daughters.<eos> The Judge has three girls.<eos> Henry doesn't have any family.<eos> That's bad.<eos> So you gotta spin some bullshit about how Henry's got ties to the community.<eos> He does.
Oh, my God, Darrin.<eos> You have crazy-long eyelashes.<eos> Oh, no, they're not so long.<eos> No, they are.<eos> Look at them!<eos> [ Laughs ] You can't look at your own eyes.<eos> [ Laughs ] I love how you scrunch your nose when you laugh.<eos> [ Volume increases ] You have the cutest laugh.<eos> I do not. [ Laughs ]<eos> Yes, you do.
Hello? I don't think I got a firm answer on the fabric store.<eos> And I never got an answer if you're gonna talk to dad or not.<eos> You know, Axl had girls over all the time, and he never confronted them.<eos> Axl, tell her. Tell her!<eos> Tell her.<eos> Tell her! Okay, everybody just needs to calm down and give me a minute.<eos> No, no, no. This is our time now.<eos> You can't take one of our minutes.<eos> Come on, mom. Silligan noses don't grow on trees.<eos> Actually, they do in one book, but--
But it would bleed less.<eos> I'm not authorized to prescribe medication.<eos> Something that might make life a little easier.<eos> At least easier than picking fights with cert teams.<eos> But if an inmate makes the request himself...<eos> Then I'm required to run their request up the flagpole.<eos> Feel-good drugs?<eos> Feel-less-bad drugs, maybe.<eos> You get what I'm saying?<eos> I do.
Will you accept the charges?<eos> Um... yes.<eos> Oh, sh-shit!<eos> Good morning.<eos> I'm sorry, Ted.<eos> I've heard worse.<eos> No, I mean... I'm sorry about the kitchen, about... how things are.<eos> I'm getting kind of used to it.<eos> I thought he'd stay home for a while.<eos> I really did.
Maybe the details were foggy, but the truth was as clear as day.<eos> It remains so.<eos> You said I could go home.<eos> Did you kill Hanna Dean?<eos> If I say I did, will you let me go this time?<eos> No one made you kill her, did they?<eos> If I say I did, will you let me go?<eos> Tell me... no one made you kill her, did they?<eos> No.<eos> They didn't.
I-I just put my hands around her neck...<eos> Squeezed as hard as I could.<eos> Until what?<eos> Until she was gone.<eos> I killed her.<eos> And no one put words in your mouth.<eos> No one coerced your confession.<eos> Did they?<eos> No.<eos> They didn't.
- Hey, Steve.<eos> - Hey, Sin Nombre.<eos> Hey, can I do a line real quick?<eos> So, is this intervention for blow?<eos> - No. Booze. - Oh.<eos> Steve, this is not a good idea.<eos> Come on, man. I'm going away to rehab.<eos> What's one little line gonna hurt?<eos> Yeah, just let him. Please.<eos> Okay. Just do it in the bedroom, all right?
- Glad you're here.<eos> Hey, can you talk to these girls for me?<eos> 'Cause they're boring the shit out of me.<eos> - Oh. - How's it going out there?<eos> - Good. I think we're making some real progress.<eos> - Okay. Good.<eos> Hey, ladies, welcome to my intervention.<eos> - Hi, Todd. - Hey.<eos> Whoa.<eos> How you doing, Todd?
I just keep coming back to how much easier It would've been to grab castle in the city.<eos> Instead, they took him on long island, Just as he was about to get married...<eos> Do you think that this has something to do with me? You and mr.<eos> Castle worked a lot of cases together.<eos> Could someone you went after have taken revenge?<eos> Yeah. A lot of people.<eos> I'll start by taking a run at gary duffin.<eos> You go through your case files, Come up with a list of potential suspects.<eos> Keep me apprised of what you find.<eos> As long as you do the same.
Security had no sense of romance.<eos> Finally had to buy a ticket.<eos> - To London?<eos> - Newark.<eos> It's the London of New Jersey.<eos> I can't let you do this.<eos> Okay?<eos> I can't let you walk away from this relationship.<eos> I don't think I have a choice.<eos> You do.
It's getting closer.<eos> It's coming from the north.<eos> There!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> It only attacks when it feels threatened.<eos> Pistol, sword...<eos> Hook, my cunning wit --<eos> I don't think we have what it takes.<eos> Emma does.
I know I do.<eos> All right, well, it's public knowledge that Mr. Clarke and entrepreneur Nolan Ross were business associates years ago.<eos> Mr. Ross, welcome.<eos> Uh, Nolan was like the son I never had.<eos> And I knew his first company would be a success, and it was.<eos> Well, because you had the courage to invest in me.<eos> An investment that paid off.<eos> I figured the profits would provide a nice nest egg for my daughter, Amanda.<eos> She never got the money, did she, Nolan?<eos> Of course she did. Of course she did.
Would you stop?<eos> You're doing this to hurt Emily.<eos> Charlotte, you know me.<eos> I thought I did.<eos> And then I found out you killed Aiden.<eos> And I know why you killed him... Because you blamed Emily for Pascal's death.<eos> But he died because she was seeking the truth about what you did to David.<eos> I'm sick of being caught between you and Emily and your cycle of hate.<eos> I want out!<eos> What I did to David all those years ago...
If there are 48 of us here, we still have people out there.<eos> The patrol brought in everyone they could find.<eos> What about the Ark?<eos> It came down last...<eos> We saw it.<eos> There were multiple crash sites over 100 square miles.<eos> If there were survivors, we will bring them in, too.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I want to see my people.<eos> Of course you do.
Don't feed the dog.<eos> Hey, Dad. Yo!<eos> You look nice.<eos> Today's my interview.<eos> Today's your interview. You said you could take the kids to school.<eos> Of course I'm taking the kids to school, right, kids?<eos> What's an interview?<eos> Mommy's getting a job. Trying to get a job.<eos> Do you want it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> See you then.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Patti, you ready to come in?<eos> It's a cat?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ha ha ha! But it has a Pop Tart for its body, and it's just shooting through space and it has rainbows coming out of its butt and it's just really happy about it.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> No, Dad, you don't.
Did you just smoke?<eos> What?<eos> You smell like cigarettes.<eos> I mean, I don't really care.<eos> You're the one that wanted to quit.<eos> Just be honest, this time.<eos> "This time"?<eos> Tommy told me about Michael. Oh, so what, you're...<eos> you're angry 'cause I didn't say something?<eos> Why didn't you?
The Remnant.<eos> You can't help them.<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> I know I can 'cause I'm supposed to.<eos> But you need to tell me why she did what she did.<eos> You need to tell me what she said.<eos> She said... I understand.<eos> Understood what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sure you do.
Let's dance.<eos> No, no. Nobody's -- nobody's dancing.<eos> Shh.<eos> Say it with your hips.<eos> O-kay.<eos> Hey, uh, no, Cam. Um...<eos> You know I love you, right?<eos> First man that ever did love me right!<eos> We have fun.<eos> We do, we do, we do.
Ah. Hey, honey.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I know, goddamn it.<eos> I'm not at liberty to say.<eos> You hungry?<eos> What the hell happened to my cabinetry?<eos> Deer broke in. Huh! No shit.<eos> Try not to get trapped in there.<eos> How did you know?<eos> Uh... I didn't.
Just so you know, it is possible for some people to be ok, Jill.<eos> Are you ok, Aimee?<eos> I am fuckin' fantastic, and I got to say, I think your dad would be, too, if you'd just fuckin' let him.<eos> Guys, let's just calm down. Come on.<eos> Did you fuck him?<eos> - Whoa. Hey. - What?<eos> - Let's play ping-pong, ok?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Right?<eos> Did you?
Guys, let's just calm down. Come on.<eos> Did you fuck him?<eos> - Whoa. Hey. - What?<eos> - Let's play ping-pong, ok?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Right?<eos> Did you?<eos> Did you fuck my dad?<eos> Yeah, Jill.<eos> I did.
Word with you outside, Chief?<eos> Something tells me you're about to get some excellent advice.<eos> - Fuck are you doin'?<eos> - What?<eos> I signed up for this little adventure under the countenance of strong and decisive leadership, but now, lo and behold, that leader is now gone, and the man currently residing in his skin clearly has no fuckin' idea what is happening in there.<eos> When we did this last night...<eos> What did I say I wanted?<eos> You said it was time to end it.<eos> I don't want to hurt her.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
What to fucking do?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want you to understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> You ever think about the 14th, 14th of October?<eos> Oh. The great vanishing?<eos> The sudden departure?<eos> The cluster fuck of the modern era?<eos> When's the last time you ever really thought about it?<eos> I don't.
That's so funny that we never saw each other before.<eos> And now we're...<eos> Now we see each other everywhere.<eos> Yeah, it's a regular Baader-Meinhof situation.<eos> - Yeah, exactly.<eos> - What is that?<eos> It's the phenomenon when you learn about something for the first time and then suddenly you hear about it everywhere.<eos> That's dumb.<eos> Do you want to jump ahead of me in line?<eos> I do.
Dewey, really.<eos> Mr. Barba.<eos> You know, that weekend was kind of a blur.<eos> Buffett, uh, he always brings the party.<eos> Your Honor, the defendants have presented no evidence suggesting Mr. Barba objected to the witness taking possession of his land.<eos> I agree.<eos> Because the five-year period has lapsed, I'm inclined to rule that Mr. Harcourt validly acquired the property in question, which means you were all trespassing.<eos> Gentlemen...<eos> You better have something very special up your sleeves for tomorrow.<eos> Oh, we always do, Your Honor. We always do.
You need to grow up.<eos> How's getting a job not growing up?<eos> Because you're running away.<eos> I'm not running away. I'd be going to earn some money then coming home again like normal people do.<eos> Oh, so screw the relationship.<eos> Screwing it?<eos> That's helping our relationship.<eos> I thought we were trying for a baby?<eos> We did try for a baby.<eos> We DID? Right.
He's got cancer.<eos> No, he hasn't.<eos> He's really not very well, Derek, and they ha...<eos> What will they do?<eos> How will they... They give him...<eos> They're going to put him down.<eos> Why's...?<eos> He's not in any pain now but if they don't do it then he will be in pain.<eos> And they just called to let you know, in case you wanted to go...<eos> Yeah, I do.
And sometimes, we all need a push.<eos> See? I get it. I get it.<eos> See, this is exactly the kind of thing that we need to work on.<eos> It's not funny when someone gets injured.<eos> Henry, I'm sorry.<eos> Showing compassion for others. Great.<eos> And after that, you can come with me to SoulCycle.<eos> I'm not going with you to SoulCycle.<eos> - Don't you want a rock-hard ass?<eos> - No, I don't.
- Bye.<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> Nope. Thank you.<eos> I'm going into town in a bit if you want to join, get out?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You yell up at me when you're going?<eos> That's brutal, man.<eos> Maybe she wants you to go after her.<eos> No.<eos> She doesn't.
Thank you.<eos> You're... teaching classes just to teach classes, right?<eos> Something like that.<eos> I'm having a month, I'm sorry.<eos> Your father didn't give me much warning or tell me much about you.<eos> And I'm really not one for nepotism.<eos> I just got the call asking if I could squeeze you into a class.<eos> So I don't really know who you are.<eos> It's OK.<eos> Neither do I.
We live in a world full of probablys.<eos> Well...<eos> I'm a decent listener... if you ever want to talk about, you know... whatever.<eos> Talking about whatever's overrated.<eos> I prefer just to, you know, let things stew inside of me, then have a violent out...<eos> What'd you do that for?<eos> It just seemed like the next interesting thing to do.<eos> I'm kind of married.<eos> Yeah, I don't mind.<eos> I kind of do.
What?<eos> I never wanted to be a mother.<eos> Not much you can do about that now.<eos> Yeah. It's too late.<eos> I was too young when I had you.<eos> I was the baby.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> I'm telling you this because... I don't want to lie to you.<eos> I don't want you to take our relationship too personally.<eos> I don't.
So why are you still here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't get it, man.<eos> What don't you get?<eos> Well, your dad is, like, the, like, a culinary maverick.<eos> He's, like, the Mick Jagger of the restaurant game.<eos> All you got to do is make one phone call and it saves our asses, but instead you want us to drown, like 90 percent of the other restaurants in the city.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> - Stu, Stu...<eos> Well, I... What did he do?
I don't get it, man.<eos> What don't you get?<eos> Well, your dad is, like, the, like, a culinary maverick.<eos> He's, like, the Mick Jagger of the restaurant game.<eos> All you got to do is make one phone call and it saves our asses, but instead you want us to drown, like 90 percent of the other restaurants in the city.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> - Stu, Stu...<eos> Well, I... What did he do?<eos> What do you mean, "What did he do?"<eos> Your dad, what did he do?
Well, your dad is, like, the, like, a culinary maverick.<eos> He's, like, the Mick Jagger of the restaurant game.<eos> All you got to do is make one phone call and it saves our asses, but instead you want us to drown, like 90 percent of the other restaurants in the city.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> - Stu, Stu...<eos> Well, I... What did he do?<eos> What do you mean, "What did he do?"<eos> Your dad, what did he do?<eos> I mean, at least take a page out of his book.<eos> What did he do?
- Oh.<eos> You know, they say that if you walk away from things, then you'll just keep walking away. Start a whole history of walk-aways.<eos> Did that sound as lame as I thought it did?<eos> No.<eos> Good, 'cause I don't have a fucking clue as to how life should be lived.<eos> Well, could you refer me to someone who does, please?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had a dog... Miles.<eos> I got him from a pound.<eos> He did it pretty well.
- I said "part of me," Les.<eos> Look, you're the bravest guy I know.<eos> So don't let her go without saying everything that you need to say.<eos> Fine.<eos> I really hate that you're leaving, but part of the reason that I fell for you in the first place is because you are the type of girl that would go and help your mom.<eos> And I'm not gonna take it back, Nicki.<eos> I love you.<eos> Okay?<eos> And I don't care if you say it back.<eos> I do.

If you want to fire me, fine.<eos> But she needs you.<eos> I don't know. I just wanted to do... Something.<eos> I'm done.<eos> We have an actual client waiting for us in court.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I hooked up with pretty much all the hot guys at boarding school, if it makes you feel better.<eos> Also, I barely remember what his penis looks like.<eos> Wait. No.<eos> I still do.
Do you not own a cell phone?<eos> I do now.<eos> Oh, no, you don't!<eos> This phone is my lifeline!<eos> My texts, my music, my contacts, my photos, my Twitter, my Pinterest, and my comprehensive notes dedicating my five-year plan!<eos> Back off, bitch!<eos> Hey, let your phone go!<eos> Thanks.<eos> I had it under control, Jenna.<eos> No, you didn't.
I...don't know.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Er, hey, no offence, but I've got plans.<eos> I need you.<eos> Right!<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Into darkness.<eos> Doc...tor!<eos> How do you know who I am?<eos> He doesn't.
Oh, baby, that's a sneeze guard. It's to protect the food.<eos> From going into our mouths? - Mommy? - Hmm.<eos> This food makes me sad. Wait.<eos> I am so hungry. [Fork clatters]<eos> Boy, there's food on your fork! You know what?<eos> If everybody is so unhappy, why don't we all just go home without eating? All:<eos> Really? I'm sorry.<eos> Baby, this is the beef plantation!<eos> So, you have "roots" on laserdisc, but eating at a place called beef plantation doesn't bump you?<eos> Well, it didn't... Till now.
There are no girls in hockey.<eos> - Problem solved. - (Call waiting beeps)<eos> - Hang on a sec. - (Beeps)<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Oh my God, Danny, I lost Ben.<eos> Did you check The Lost and Found?<eos> No, he met someone else.<eos> What are... what are the chances of that even happening?<eos> Well, it's Ben, so 100%?<eos> So what do I do now?
Don, can you be impartial?<eos> What do I hold out for?<eos> Don't negotiate, just accept the deal.<eos> Should we take it from the top?<eos> "Welcome, welcome.<eos> Indiana's beautiful this time of year."<eos> I tell a joke, everyone laughs.<eos> Then Harry gets up and doesn't squander the good will I've just generated.<eos> - I have a joke, too.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Why? - Because we're presenting to Burger Chef<eos> Monday morning.<eos> I know the astronauts may not make it, and then what are we gonna say?<eos> Oh. I'm sorry.<eos> - They're going to be fine.<eos> - It's not fair!<eos> You know what? I'll give you the key and you can come down and watch yourself.<eos> Just don't use the stove again.<eos> I don't wanna go to Newark.<eos> - Nobody does.
You can't stop me.<eos> He attacked you.<eos> I had every right to take him out of the house.<eos> He's got some dangerous friends, Bridg.<eos> It's not your world.<eos> You can't see him anymore.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Didn't you ever love somebody that wasn't right for you?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- How much do we like each other? - A lot.<eos> Heh, heh.<eos> Mom came home at 2 a.m. last night.<eos> Yes?<eos> You know anything?<eos> Boss, I don't want to do this.<eos> You don't get to tell me what you want.<eos> Do you know anything or not?<eos> Boss-- You wanna keep your job? No.<eos> Yeah, you do.
So, what?<eos> He won't do it, we'll get someone else.<eos> No one will fucking touch it now.<eos> You went to his house.<eos> What would I have seen if I had taken pictures of you, Ray?<eos> How many fucking women would there be?<eos> I need you to sign these papers.<eos> What are they? Loan papers for the new house.<eos> I don't want it anymore.<eos> Yes, you do.
If you can make this happen pretending to be a lawyer... imagine what you could do if you became a real one.<eos> We need to make sure you do.<eos> Right, Felix?<eos> Felix!<eos> Sometimes it's... Not so bad having you around.<eos> Just so you know, what I heard was, "I love you."<eos> Well, if he's choking, you're doing that wrong.<eos> No, Ama, that was a hug.<eos> "Another thing we didn't have in our village."<eos> We didn't.
[Chuckling] Oh, yeah.<eos> You're Myrna, okay?<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Your husband gets arrested.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Then later on, his buddy Lee comes over, looking for bail money.<eos> Right, and I think if Geno's so smart to save some bail money, well, then he's got to have some money hidden somewhere in this house.<eos> And you want it.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
And you tell yourself there's nobody there, nobody watching, nobody listening, nobody there at all...<eos> ..and you very nearly believe it.<eos> You really, really try... ..and then...<eos> There are accounts of that dream throughout human history, time and time again, the same dream.<eos> Now, there is a very obvious question I'm about to ask you.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> Have you had that dream? Exactly.<eos> No - that was me asking you, have you had that dream?<eos> I asked first.<eos> No, I did.
Nothing, she was perfect.<eos> She was top of her class in law school, and she's an academic fellow for the united nations.<eos> Wow, so she's good enough for the entire world, but not Yolanda.<eos> But Derrick, Cheryl sounds like the one.<eos> I mean, you don't just meet somebody like that.<eos> I mean... I had that with my last boyfriend, Cooper.<eos> We had this amazing connection until, you know...<eos> He dumped me and moved to China.<eos> But, you know, the point is if you love somebody...<eos> I do!
I paid a lot for those teeth.<eos> So, are you okay with me calling Cheryl?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Yeah. Are you okay that I manipulated you into calling Cheryl?<eos> I had to.<eos> It's true love.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> But it doesn't mean that I don't love you.<eos> I would be lucky to have someone like you in my family.<eos> You already do.
You just go.<eos> - Got it.<eos> Douche bag.<eos> - Yeah. You know, uh...<eos> She said this guy sulla called carlito.<eos> She might not like it, but Mike's right.<eos> The place could be our way back into solano.<eos> - Mike picked up Lawrence to question him about our insider.<eos> He knew where Paige was, but he wasn't talking.<eos> - So what did you do to him?
I mean, how could this have happened?<eos> He was just at work.<eos> We're still trying to figure that out.<eos> In the meantime, is there anybody that you could call?<eos> [Cellphone ringing] * hey, yo pick 'em up, pick 'em up * * hey, pick 'em up, pick 'em up * [clears throat] [Ringing stops] - Duncan, could you get a glass of water, please?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> [Sighs] We just... we just had dinner together last night.<eos> - [Water running] - How am I supposed to feel?<eos> - [Water shuts off] - I don't know what to do.<eos> What do I do with this stuff?
Put this sword on the ground right now!<eos> Holster your weapon, now.<eos> - No, not until he drops it.<eos> - Put the gun away now!<eos> You Ray Spencer?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - He's a killer.<eos> - He killed Mr. Power.<eos> - I didn't kill anybody!<eos> - Yes, you did!
Is it weird that I feel sorry for Ray?<eos> No.<eos> That's you. I suppose it's the same reason you ended up with him.<eos> Yeah, something like that.<eos> Uh, this could be an eight-hour day.<eos> What is the deal with this eight-hour-day thing?<eos> Just tired of breaking promises.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had it under control.<eos> - No, you didn't.
No.<eos> That's you.

- [Sniffles] Yeah.<eos> - Okay, good. Good.<eos> We still have quite a bit of time.<eos> I like to budget like half an hour to get across town, you know, just in case something comes up... construction, traffic.<eos> - [Horn honks] - You never know.<eos> Right, yeah, no, it's good to, um, - be able to take our time. - Mm-hmm.<eos> ♪ soul shine ♪ Uh, Sam's gonna miss having you.<eos> Will he?<eos> [Scoffs] I mean, you never know with that guy, right?<eos> - Do you?

I don't expect you to know about mine.<eos> But when people die, our worlds collide.<eos> ~ And when they're killed - ~ Sidney, you've sat with the dying.<eos> Many times.<eos> And you, Inspector.<eos> Sometimes people are ready.<eos> Sometimes they hold on and suffer terribly.<eos> I have seen how debilitating an illness can be.<eos> Then you understand.<eos> No, I don't.
So how do you two know each other?<eos> Hildegard plays the piano.<eos> I'm thinking of taking some lessons.<eos> What do you play?<eos> Any Mozart?<eos> Can't beat a bit of Mozart.<eos> Of course, he is one of my favourite composers.<eos> Plays the piano?<eos> Next you'll be telling me she actually likes jazz.<eos> - She does.
It gathers around me!<eos> I hope we will have a snack.<eos> It has water, it's something.<eos> Please, listen to me.<eos> We have the unique opportunity this morning to be able to attend a ra-ri-ssime event.<eos> Loading...<eos> Please!<eos> Archers at my command, be kind enough to draw!<eos> But do something!<eos> What do I do?
I need a witness.<eos> I'm here against my will, without an attorney.<eos> It's a violation of my rights.<eos> Smile, agents. You're on-camera.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We believe Tish is involved with a group that's selling illegal weapons and that they're being stored here.<eos> Here?<eos> Yes, and we're gonna find them.<eos> Little thing called the fourth amendment.<eos> Don't you?
I don't feel like another interrogation.<eos> What you need is a partner... a seasoned investigator, like me.<eos> You're my hallucination.<eos> You're no more seasoned than I am.<eos> Really?<eos> I would've squeezed that guy.<eos> Why didn't you make him sweat a little?<eos> Because he would have tossed me out of his office.<eos> - It's not like I have a badge.<eos> - But I do.
Just shut your mouth!<eos> I'm not talking to you any longer.<eos> Hey, Sean, who did you call before we picked you up, eh?<eos> The feds?<eos> State troopers?<eos> Did you call the sheriff, Walt longmire?<eos> You can tell me.<eos> I didn't call anybody.<eos> I thought you said you and your wife had some car trouble.<eos> We did.
What do we tell his brother?<eos> Luciano's taking care of him.<eos> Mike?<eos> Watch him.<eos> You finish that, Al wants you to run this over to Cicero.<eos> He's not feeling safe.<eos> He's very grateful for what you've done.<eos> Lobby.<eos> He had two kids.<eos> So do I.

If you take it, you're stealing from me and you're certainly no gentleman.<eos> I need you to pull all the prostitution cases north of 110th Street.<eos> You need me to?<eos> Mr. Hodge does.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I don't make the assignments.<eos> Would it be any different if you did? Yes.<eos> I know you're good at your job.<eos> Mr. Hodge does, too.
I don't understand.<eos> You love your music.<eos> We love the fact that you love your music.<eos> Has something... happened?<eos> I mean, Johnny is so lost.<eos> Can you think what it must be like to lose a sibling without even a chance of a farewell?<eos> I mean, it's unimaginable.<eos> The funeral's tomorrow.<eos> You know all the right things to say.<eos> No, I don't.

I want her back, Sidney.<eos> I want Claudie back.<eos> Mr. Johnson.<eos> You're not welcome here.<eos> - I want to say goodbye.<eos> - You're not welcome here!<eos> Let him see her, Dad.<eos> - Or what?<eos> - I don't wanna do this.<eos> - Yes, you do!
Uh, no, it's not actual smoke.<eos> It's a bunch of small blood vessels that form to compensate for a blockage in the carotid artery.<eos> How did you figure it was moyamoya?<eos> Well, during your solo, I saw you not getting enough oxygen, and hypoxia is not a symptom of Huntington's, so...<eos> So what caused the blockage?<eos> Hard to say for sure, but it might have formed when your dad dropped you from the jungle gym.<eos> So I did get a condition from my father.<eos> Speaking of which... Your blood work came back.<eos> Now, I just need to confirm that you want the result of your Huntington's test.<eos> - I do.
Say hi. Hi.<eos> I had an accident.<eos> Okay. That's all right.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get you out of those clothes.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> It says here:<eos> "The hero always crosses water in the beginning."<eos> Really?<eos> "They did it with Moses. King Arthur. And Oedipus."
Wake up, Danny.<eos> Come on, Danny.<eos> Please.<eos> Who am I meeting, Amy?<eos> Hey.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You're all right.<eos> - Did I... did I hurt anyone?<eos> - No.<eos> No, you didn't.
I can promise you that.<eos> My little brother is in the ground.<eos> Cold and alone.<eos> He doesn't deserve to be there.<eos> He deserves to be up here with me.<eos> Alive and well.<eos> The second Rising will happen when the First Risen is sacrificed.<eos> The disciple was meant...<eos> he was meant to do it.<eos> He didn't.
Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You gotta rest.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay, you just gotta sit back and you gotta trust me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, I got our best guy on this, and he's gonna take care of you.<eos> But now you need your rest.<eos> And I promise that I'm watching out for you.<eos> You always do.
Jordan, I was never gonna lose you.<eos> The guy's a scumbag who shot Dwayne in cold blood.<eos> You are not responsible for any of this.<eos> - You understand?<eos> - Guys?<eos> I know this is going to be awkward, but the shooter needs medical attention.<eos> - Screw him.<eos> - That's too bad.<eos> - I know how you feel.<eos> I... - No, you don't.

Maybe.<eos> Or he'll be very close.<eos> How are we gonna break out?<eos> I'm working on a plan now.<eos> So I just say, "Marie, we're gonna bust out of this joint"?<eos> It's not gonna be your idea -- it's gonna be her idea.<eos> Cousin Ricky needs surgery again.<eos> He's got to lose his gall bladder.<eos> doctor says it's got to go. Huh? Huh, what does it do?<eos> What does a gall bladder do?
It's the end of Ramadan. They're celebrating.<eos> Fireworks.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It is beautiful.<eos> You thought it was a bomb, didn't you?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I did not.<eos> You did.
Kurt, let's dig into Nightfall himself, his asset history, how we recruited him, any work he's done that I can actually brief POTUS on.<eos> I already spoke with the Russia House.<eos> Their clandestine services officer is on his way in.<eos> They don't usually work at this hour.<eos> Yeah, no one sane works at this hour.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> I had a flat tire.<eos> Is my fly open?<eos> I thought Skinner got fired.<eos> He did.
20-some odd minutes of riveting footage of terrorists drinking tea, and then it gets interesting.<eos> There's the cameraman, Logan's buddy Al.<eos> So we did a little digging.<eos> It was actually a lot of digging.<eos> We, uh, did some facial recognition.<eos> This is of a training camp of Sheikh Hakam's from seven years ago.<eos> It's the same guy.<eos> Question is, did Logan game us?<eos> No.<eos> No, Fatah did.
Sorry it didn't work out.<eos> Come see us for your next exam.<eos> We specialize in treating dental phobics.<eos> And we have Pac-Man.<eos> I think it's time to throw in the towel.<eos> I mean, for your theory to hold,<eos> Cody would've had to somehow switch out those dental records.<eos> - Son of a bitch!<eos> - What?<eos> He did.
So, Henry Morgan, what's your story?<eos> Well, I won't bore you with the details, but the watch was a gift.<eos> Legend has it had belonged to a doctor seeking passage on a ship from Africa.<eos> It was given to him by his father.<eos> Anyway, the watch was lost at the bottom of the ocean.<eos> And years later, it was recovered by a team of treasure hunters.<eos> It was bought at auction and given to me.<eos> That is a generous gift.<eos> This person must have really cared about you.<eos> Yes, of course she did.
What are you doing? !<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Stop the car. Wait -- ma'am, we're in the middle of the bridge.<eos> No, stop the car now!<eos> Stop the car please! What the hell are you doing? !<eos> [ tires screech ]<eos> Hey, what the hell are you doing? !<eos> [ panting ]<eos> What are you, crazy?<eos> Hey, lady, don't do this!
That's my mom.<eos> Yeah, she was beautiful.<eos> We all have different ways of dealing with loss.<eos> He never forgot her.<eos> What's this?<eos> "youth. Vitality.<eos> The ouroboros, or a snake eating its own tail.<eos> It suggests eternal renewal.<eos> I wonder if that has something to do With the condition of your father's body.<eos> Or maybe this does.
What is it?<eos> This room is filled with Degas, Monet, all masterpieces.<eos> And one painting by an unknown Argentinean.<eos> Ah, the Vermeers.<eos> Abigail, this is Gloria.<eos> It's her party.<eos> I think you have someone special here, Abigail.<eos> I think you're right.<eos> Do you have someone special?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
He said it was just a dalliance that she'd forgotten.<eos> But he was wrong.<eos> She never forgave him.<eos> And I never forgave her.<eos> She donated millions of dollars to secretly keep this painting on display... And one day die in front of it.<eos> I hope she saw it.<eos> Good work back there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I know it's hard to go someplace with old memories.<eos> You do?
Previously on Covert Affairs...<eos> Borz Altan.<eos> Could be an American, Muslim.<eos> Has he worked for McQuaid security for a short while?<eos> Mr. McQuaid?<eos> What do you remember about Borz Altan?<eos> Did security work for me for four months in Eastern Europe.
Yeah. Who wants you sitting in their waiting room, right?<eos> No.<eos> Not... not "you."<eos> It's... it's... it's the office.<eos> - Okay. I get it. I get it.<eos> - It's... it's... it's...<eos> So, our victim's mother had stage IV lung cancer.<eos> When traditional drugs failed, she was accepted into a trial for a new A.L.K. inhibitor. It worked.<eos> She went into remission, and the doctor thought that she would have a meaningful recovery.<eos> - But she didn't?
This is usually when Jane says, "get to the point"<eos> before she's overcome with an urge to strangle me<eos> - with her bare hands.<eos> - I miss her.<eos> The chemist found, uh, substantial amounts of acetone, as well as traces of other chemicals that he discounted as burn-off.<eos> Meaning the stuff left behind from everything<eos> - that melted in the fire?<eos> - Yes. And one of those discounted chemicals was toluene, a solvent.<eos> But it would only have been present as a burn-off if the Sullivans had hardwood floors.<eos> - Which they didn't.
That confirms it, then.<eos> She's got a dick.<eos> Smith, hurry up.<eos> You're on laundry dispatch.<eos> Well, it's gotta be one of the newbies.<eos> Yeah, well, it's not the young girl 'cause she's like a rabbit caught in the headlights.<eos> The cripple couldn't have pushed that machine on her. Yeah, well, it's gotta be the bloke.<eos> That's the worst disguise I've ever seen.<eos> Bea, you're gonna have to do your research. You'll have to find out who's got associations.<eos> Well, how do I do that?
- Yep. What am I supposed to see?<eos> - Keep looking.<eos> The secure room we're looking for, we're standing in it.<eos> You're looking at the braxnet a97.<eos> It's the most advanced security system on the market.<eos> Each unit is independently powered, so cutting the house's main will get us nowhere.<eos> A security cage rapidly descends if the laser perimeter's broken.<eos> It's full of redundancies and backups developed with the help of ex-thieves.<eos> - You're angry they didn't ask you, aren't you?<eos> - They did.
- Nice to meet you.<eos> It's hard enough putting the bad guys in prison without the good guys letting them out.<eos> The same could be said for you, Agent Burke.<eos> I had the feeling I'd see you soon.<eos> Did you?<eos> I thought it would be sooner.<eos> It would have been sooner had you reached out to me.<eos> That would not have been in my best interests.<eos> You don't want to take down the Pink Panthers?<eos> Oh, I do.
- All of them in the U.S. These right here, airlines and corresponding plane numbers.<eos> International airlines.<eos> So whatever they're transporting is going in and out of the country.<eos> We haven't figured out what these numbers mean yet, but we think it has something to do with where the shipment ends up.<eos> If everything is chosen at random...<eos> No one knows who's flying or where until the algorithm chooses.<eos> Cloaked in this kind of secrecy, it must be a very high value target.<eos> And without planning, it's almost an impossible heist.<eos> Unless you have the algorithm.<eos> Of which, thanks to Neal and Keller, the Pink Panthers do.
If you can't buy a beer without thinking the bartender made you.<eos> And always on the move.<eos> Always on a hustle.<eos> I thought you preferred that lifestyle.<eos> I do.<eos> But it ain't cheap.<eos> That's why I'm gonna take all the money.<eos> I-I told you we couldn't trust him.<eos> We had a deal, Keller. Yeah, you're right.<eos> We did.
Are you serious?<eos> - Go on, take it.<eos> What am I supposed to do with that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Be glad that it's negative.<eos> - I am. Come on.<eos> - Oh, god.<eos> Go.<eos> Please be seated.<eos> Do it quietly.
Call the judge on your phone.<eos> Tell him we need an arrest warrant.<eos> You know, I got a dry-aged t-bone for dinner tonight, but looks like we might ought to put in on that eye of yours.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Hey, dad?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I need to borrow the car.<eos> Why?<eos> I got a job to finish.<eos> No, you don't.
Malachi strand told me.<eos> You can't be sure anything malachi says is true.<eos> This time, I can.<eos> If he had not told the truth, the bar would be in ashes right now.<eos> Did you start this fire?<eos> I thought if I could get malachi to tell me where Darius was when Miller Beck was killed, then cady could link them together and we might have had a shot in court.<eos> But my gamble did not pay off.<eos> Turns out, Darius was in Connecticut, doing a job for malachi when Miller Beck was murdered.<eos> Well, malachi might have told you that, but we still need to confirm it.<eos> Cady already did.
Might be nothing. Old ladies die all the time.<eos> It's practically their job description.<eos> And the monster?<eos> Well, seen by no one except her, which suggests that it wasn't there.<eos> Dying brain, lack of oxygen, hallucinations.<eos> Anyway, people do just die sometimes.<eos> She was over 100 years old.<eos> Says the 2,000-year-old man.<eos> Clara, you actually sound as if you want this to be a thing.<eos> Do you?
Why?<eos> I guess I hoped seeing you might make me feel a little less...<eos> I don't know...<eos> Alone.<eos> Ok.<eos> Look. Maybe for tonight, we could pretend things are different.<eos> I'm not a vampire, you're not a wolf, the city isn't about to implode.<eos> We could just... I don't know... Be ourselves.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Well, we did it.
I'm the one who loves you.<eos> You knew how special she was.<eos> I always thought you would protect her, that she would be your wife, that one day I might call her daughter.<eos> Instead...<eos> I didn't hurt her.<eos> You've taught yourself to hide from who and what you are for thousands of years.<eos> No.<eos> I did not hurt Tatia.<eos> I could not.<eos> But you did.
What's happening?<eos> That's mother dearest calling me home.<eos> Well, you always did know how to leave a message, mother.<eos> If only all my sons were as respectful as you are.<eos> Kol will return home soon.<eos> Elijah will wake from his slumber believing the only way to salvage his humanity is to rejoin our family, which is why it is time you bring Camile in.<eos> Here.<eos> I've spelled this to subdue her without causing bodily harm.<eos> I thought we had more time.<eos> We don't.
Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Train guy's still here.<eos> - Wow. - Seriously, that was great.<eos> Not the kiss, the read.<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I feel like the girl who took her top off at the dinner party.<eos> Great job.<eos> Oh, I loved it.<eos> And apparently, so did Andrea Askowitz.
Hey, Sykes.<eos> Does number one have a...<eos> Lina has a black eye, yeah.<eos> Number one is about to be on the move.<eos> I assume LAX.<eos> Is her father going with her to the airport?<eos> That's a negative.<eos> If we throw up road blocks south of Madhavan's house, we could possibly channel Lina and her driver down La Cienega<eos> - if you need time.<eos> - I do.
Maybe I have.<eos> I'll dig them out.<eos> Well, anyway, you were delivered at Saint Joseph's because we had to move to North Hollywood when I was eight months pregnant so your dad could train some Armenian guy.<eos> Who I think has since passed away.<eos> I can't believe you don't know any of this.<eos> Yeah. I just thought it was Huntington for some reason.<eos> Well, I guess if you want to be official, you're from the Valley.<eos> But to me, you're from Venice.<eos> Lisa said you have my money.<eos> I do.
Big deal.<eos> Ah, I just wanted to talk to you about an opportunity... yeah, I heard you talking to my mom, and I'm not interested.<eos> Well, you're gonna be interested!<eos> You're an airbender now, and you have a responsibility as a citizen of the world.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I didn't ask to become an airbender, you know.<eos> Well, I didn't ask to be the Avatar, but I am, and I'm fulfilling my duties. So?<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Yes, I do have to.<eos> No, you don't.

No, you don't.<eos> Well, if I didn't embrace my role, then our entire world could be thrown into chaos.<eos> Think about that.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> - No, it's not! So what?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Everyone cares!<eos> I don't care.<eos> Yes, you do!

Please, call me Su.<eos> Great to finally meet you, Avatar Korra.<eos> And this must be Mako, Bolin, and Asami.<eos> You've done your research.<eos> I make it my business to know who's visiting my city.<eos> So you're a dancer?<eos> Dancer, leader, wife, mother, collector of rare meteorites.<eos> You'll find people here have many skills and interests.<eos> Korra, why did you lie when Aiwei asked if there was anyone else with you? What?<eos> I-I didn't.
Don't even think about taking one more step!<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Where are you off to today?<eos> I, uh, got a delivery to make in Bao Yu.<eos> I should be back later today.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, just a little tired.<eos> One more pickup, then I'm clocking out.<eos> I thought you said you had a delivery.<eos> Did I?
- Politics?<eos> - Indeed.<eos> To announce his intention to take his father's seat on the select board.<eos> In the middle of the night?<eos> Miss Hale.<eos> The accused was seen kissing you forcibly in public.<eos> There is no blame attached to you.<eos> You are a -- a slight and defenseless slip of a girl.<eos> But do you deny it?<eos> He did.

Who is it who has really violated women?<eos> John Alden?<eos> Or one who possesses... And uses... Tools such as this?<eos> How dare you?<eos> No, sir!<eos> How dare you? !<eos> This session is suspended for the day!<eos> We will resume in the morning when tempers have cooled.<eos> The whole town wants to hang me like I'm some kind of monster, like I possess some dark, magic power.<eos> And you do.
I can't.<eos> I can't! You're Mary.<eos> You're Mary.<eos> They all call you Mary Sibley.<eos> Do you know what I call you in my head, to myself, in my heart?<eos> "Magic Mary."<eos> You were always magic, even back when we was just sprouts.<eos> And you could do anything -- always could.<eos> You just have to want it bad enough.<eos> And you do.
She was held in a basement, okay?<eos> Alison was kidnapped and blindfolded and I don't even want to think about what else.<eos> Hasn't the universe punished her enough?<eos> What we're doing isn't punishment, it's a preventative measure.<eos> That's semantics.<eos> I never thought I'd say this, but I feel bad for her.<eos> It's hard to still see Ali as the devil when she just escaped from the hell.<eos> What if I told you that her abduction story is just that, a story?<eos> No one would lie about something like that.<eos> She did.
What happened on your road trip?<eos> - So I ain't fired?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why the hell not?<eos> - This ain't personal.<eos> This is business.<eos> Everybody wants the exclusive on the wedding.<eos> We haven't even set a date yet.<eos> - Why didn't you fight for her?<eos> ! - I did.
Mollie asked me to go glow-in-the-dark bowling, but I really don't have to go.<eos> I can stay here with you.<eos> - No, why would you want to do that?<eos> You should go and have fun with your friend, okay?<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Yeah, I'll... I'll find something to keep me busy.<eos> - Thank you. - Yep.<eos> You think I want to leave right now, fly all the way to Kansas to play this thing?<eos> I've got a fever, too.<eos> Sure you do, Patsy.
I'm surprised you even wanted to come.<eos> Research.<eos> Jeanie gave me a mandate.<eos> She wants me to write something fun, and I don't know if I'm the writer-for-hire type.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You and Gunnar did pretty well when you worked together.<eos> Ever think about partnering up again?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> I can't believe your dad let you come to this.<eos> He didn't.
[chuckles] I can imagine that's true, too.<eos> I mean, I'm, you know, trying to give my kids this kind of life, but I couldn't imagine it for myself.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> With daddy working as a groom and us living season to season...<eos> I mean, he loved those horses, but he could never imagine owning one.<eos> Rich, poor...<eos> I know we're all equal in the eyes of God, but here on earth... [chuckles] rich is a lot better.<eos> But you had a good family.<eos> I mean, it always sounds like you had so much love around.<eos> Yeah, yeah. We did.
Why didn't you?<eos> We never even used to have paparazzi in Nashville.<eos> Now we got this TMZ here.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> I'm actually not surprised.<eos> The first picture of you in your wedding dress is gonna be worth big bucks.<eos> Oh, yeah! Mama's gonna buy herself something pretty.<eos> Got my damn car blocked in.<eos> Oh, well, if you want to leave, they have to move, right?<eos> No, they don't.
- Luke: Hey, sorry.<eos> I got caught playing mini golf with the kids.<eos> - You missed a good game, Rayna.<eos> - I know I did.<eos> Look Wheeler, Brett from Rolling Stone.<eos> - Brett: How you doing?<eos> - How you doing?<eos> I thought this was just gonna be the two of us<eos> - taking care of all this.<eos> - I did, too.
Juliette's...<eos> Fine, I guess.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Stuff's... Weird between us.<eos> It's just hard to be friends.<eos> Darling, even if you don't have a relationship with her, you can have a relationship with your daughter.<eos> That's all that really matters.<eos> We have a good time together.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, we do.
Cover of Rolling Stone, CMAs, "Dancing with the Stars. "<eos> - You're gonna be on that Christmas special.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> What?<eos> You hit the stratosphere.<eos> I don't recognize my life anymore.<eos> Yeah. Well, you know, it's a lot of changes.<eos> You wanted to build up your company, and you did it.<eos> I don't know how much of this really has to do with my company.<eos> Or maybe it does.
It's going all right out here.<eos> What's new at home?<eos> Um... ooh. Check this out.<eos> Brand... new pedal board.<eos> Nice!<eos> What else?<eos> Well, you remember my old friend Kiley, right?<eos> She's leaving town and wants to catch up before she goes.<eos> But look, if that bothers you, I don't have to see her.<eos> It... it doesn't.
Yeah, there's actually a tour in L.A. That my friend Mavis could get me on, but...<eos> I know you don't want to sing backup anymore, but...<eos> It's better than sleeping on Deacon's couch.<eos> Hey, maybe you could manage me, too.<eos> I'm not really managing Terry.<eos> I mean, he had a whole career before I came along.<eos> I'm just helping him.<eos> You're just helping him get gigs, get press...<eos> Did I tell you that people from a television show want to interview him?<eos> Well, of course they do.
Thank you!<eos> Hi. You've reached Layla. Leave a message.<eos> Hey, uh, I can't find you, so, um... I'm just gonna head on home.<eos> You know, if I were you, I wouldn't give up on being a serious musician just yet.<eos> Ah, I'm pretty sure that ship has sailed.<eos> But not for you.<eos> You were incredible today. I mean it.<eos> Come on, I'll give you a ride.<eos> Yeah, well... if only everybody didn't see me as the girl curious about robot voices.<eos> I don't.
He produces this whole awards show.<eos> And next to him is Scott Borchetta.<eos> He's the head of Big Machine Records, which is...<eos> And don't forget Jeff Fordham, president of Edgehill-Republic.<eos> Hey, little man.<eos> You got a second to talk about your future with the company?<eos> Sure.<eos> Uh, give me just a secon... so, I've been told that you're actually better than your ex-boss.<eos> You have any demos I could listen to?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Especially you, Rayna Jaymes.<eos> You have inspired me not only as an artist, but as a person, and your relationship has inspired me, too, and I just hope that one day, I can find the kind of love that you share.<eos> Just, thank you all so much.<eos> I - I couldn't be more thrilled.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm gonna hit the men's room.<eos> [Chuckles] Okay, I'm not even gonna ask how you knew this room was here.<eos> You have any idea how many lies I had to come up with to cover your ass out there?<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Yes, I did.
Oh, on the off chance he actually wins something.<eos> God. Do you even hear yourself?<eos> I mean, you had a plan for everything.<eos> What did it get you?<eos> A daughter who never talks to you, a son you keep pushing away.<eos> I'm not pushing you away.<eos> I happen to be worried about the well-being of my grandchild, even if you're unconcerned.<eos> I am not unconcerned.<eos> You want to know what my plan is?<eos> Yes, I do.
You said you would, and you didn't.<eos> So either do what I'm asking, or I'll do it myself.<eos> You can't do it, Harvey.<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> Logan's gonna do it anyway.<eos> At least this way it'll be me.<eos> What's the difference if you hire somebody to look into Mike or Logan does?<eos> You know damn well they're gonna uncover his secret.<eos> I don't know that, and you don't either.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
That's not how it works.<eos> Well, maybe you should think of something that won't ruin his goddamn life.<eos> You ready to get down to business?<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> - Good. I was thinking that maybe we could do all this over lunch.<eos> It's 10:30.<eos> There's a lot to discuss, Jessica.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> We need to bury them in paperwork.<eos> No, we don't.
You're gonna go to Walter Gillis, and you're gonna make this thing right.<eos> It is right.<eos> It's over. You lost.<eos> Nothing's over.<eos> And you're the one who lost something today.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You went personal. I went personal.<eos> Your father's master tapes... I've got 'em.<eos> Those tapes have nothing to do with this deal.<eos> They do now.
The family probably gave different sketches to different investigators.<eos> I looked for welles for about a year and a half.<eos> Tracked him all the way to Cleveland, but then the trail went cold.<eos> The family was only paying me for travel and food, so I didn't make enough money and, you know, had to call it quits.<eos> Ah. So, why were you looking for him two days ago at the homeless shelter?<eos> Well, you know how it is, Walt.<eos> It's hard to give up on the cases you don't solve.<eos> I pursued welles for so long, and then the other day, I see a guy looks just like my sketch.<eos> I really thought I'd seen him.<eos> Apparently, I did.
I'm a philanthropist, facing so many deserving causes.<eos> Which do I help first?<eos> Maybe... you can help... both at the same time?<eos> Only two?<eos> See who else you can find?<eos> So, how do we celebrate your success?<eos> Want some champagne? No.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Nshombo.<eos> I thought you got to her.<eos> I did.
I'm going to find her.<eos> When I was a teenager, I started reading every book I could find on the occult.<eos> I taught myself spells, rituals, curses.<eos> I learned to conjure all kinds of dead things.<eos> Just not her.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Get ready.<eos> I told you to call my cell phone.<eos> You really don't want to be up here.<eos> Oh, yes, he does.
- He's my friend.<eos> - He's not your friend, Rabbit.<eos> - He was using us.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> He made a video saying that you wanted to hurt - a lot of people.<eos> - We could show it to you.<eos> - Why would we lie to you?<eos> - Because you want to shut me down for good and never wake me up, exactly like he told me.<eos> - I don't want to shut you down for good.<eos> - Yes, you do.

He can... get into people's minds and make them do things they don't want to do.<eos> How?<eos> Well, he has special powers.<eos> He does something to our brains that we can't understand.<eos> Not mine.<eos> This doesn't seem like a prudent course of action, considering.<eos> We're not leaving him.<eos> You said Sean was exposed to the spores.<eos> How do you know he won't contaminate the capsule?<eos> I don't.
There you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Like this.<eos> I thought you didn't like mustard.<eos> Hm. You want to try it the Boston way?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. You gotta put the tomato and the pickles underneath the burger.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, he doesn't like pickles.<eos> Yes, I do.
That cannot happen, not because of some bastard spreading lies.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Preliminary hearings are won by the prosecution 99% of the time.<eos> The judge only needs to prove that there's probable cause of a crime to go to trial, so the only way to keep Marren's case out of trial is to find the real culprit.<eos> There are 52 employees at trudeau securities.<eos> Your job is to interview them pretending it's case research, of course, until you find us a traitor.<eos> Happy hunting.<eos> - How do you know it's one of her employees?<eos> - I don't.
You don't have to say it twice.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Did you read it?<eos> What the hell is she doing?<eos> She's defending you.<eos> None of this is true.<eos> But it's good for you.<eos> You never had the phone, and now griffin has a motive.<eos> If he knew lila was cheating on him --<eos> He didn't.
Objection... argumentative.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You didn't ask an actual question.<eos> The opposing lawyer would have no choice but to object.<eos> I watch court TV.<eos> Grandma hated Elke.<eos> She felt like mom should be our mom, not some Scandinavian milkmaid.<eos> Don't say that part on the stand.<eos> We don't want anyone to think your grandmother had anything to do with it.<eos> Maybe she did.
He thought I could be a teacher, if that doesn't make you laugh.<eos> But he couldn't manage it.<eos> We had no money, you see, and then my mother got ill and so I had to earn as soon as I could.<eos> Why don't you take Matric now?<eos> No, I've missed it.<eos> But I'd like to help.<eos> Make sure somebody got away.<eos> Mrs Hughes?<eos> Do you remember that overcoat I gave you, for the refugees, when we were in London for Lady Rose's ball?<eos> I do.
No, I've missed it.<eos> But I'd like to help.<eos> Make sure somebody got away.<eos> Mrs Hughes?<eos> Do you remember that overcoat I gave you, for the refugees, when we were in London for Lady Rose's ball?<eos> I do.<eos> They were very glad of it.<eos> It sounds mad, I know, but did you find a ticket in it, in the pocket?<eos> Of course. You won't remember.<eos> No, I do.
I'm afraid I'm a bit of a mess.<eos> Not at all, please.<eos> I just wanted to ask you if you might reconsider coming to the unveiling of the memorial.<eos> I don't mean to be rude, m'lord...<eos> I know that.<eos> But, it's important reconciliation is the spirit of the day.<eos> I should feel I had failed if you were to be absent from the ceremony.<eos> Please. I ask it as a favour.<eos> Very well. If it means that much to your lordship.<eos> It does.
Take courage for their sake.<eos> We must always travel in hope.<eos> I realised what it is about Marigold that keeps catching my eye. Oh, yes?<eos> What's that?<eos> She reminds me of Michael Gregson.<eos> Just tell me if I'm wrong.<eos> You're not wrong.<eos> Don't tell Edith you've guessed.<eos> Why not? It makes things a good deal clearer than they were.<eos> Just don't. Not yet.
What you doing sitting out here?<eos> Just waiting for you.<eos> I feel so bad for Dave.<eos> Seeing how far Bright was willing to go, it... must've made him question everything.<eos> Only it was too late for him.<eos> What is that?<eos> Uh, that's, uh, peach blueberry.<eos> From Sweet Creations in Nashville?<eos> I had to, uh, pull a few strings.<eos> Course you did.
James.<eos> This is important.<eos> Please listen.<eos> Talk to Lyle.<eos> Only to Lyle.<eos> And if my...<eos> No, no, no. No, no, no. Come on, come on, come on.<eos> - Joe, Joe... what happened?<eos> - That's so strange.<eos> Mine just did the same thing.
I was wrong.<eos> The rain is... is-is a test.<eos> A test of my worthiness.<eos> Whose test?<eos> The dome.<eos> I believe that now.<eos> You're prepared to surrender?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. I-I believe in its plan.<eos> I do.
You didn't know that?<eos> Hello?<eos> Sophia?<eos> Tobias?<eos> Lady Riesen, the Principate sent us to find...<eos> Two of my students live here.<eos> Look at this place.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> If the Blues are gonna toss the place, they could at least clean up after themselves.<eos> The Blues did this?
And, yes, I think that love is an emotion created to sell greeting cards and chocolate-covered candies and, in some cultures, a chicken.<eos> But you can't greet Nicki like this.<eos> You look like a dude just waiting for sex.<eos> Are you really trying to help me right now, or are you just messing with my head?<eos> Why can't it be both? [Door opens] Justin?<eos> Justin!<eos> [Chuckles] Oh. Okay.<eos> I don't want... I don't want to have sex.<eos> That... that... that came out wrong.<eos> I do.
I know you like to take credit for everything, but...<eos> You can't tell Nicki that you... you gave me that move.<eos> But then how's Nicki gonna know that I gave you the move?<eos> She won't.<eos> Ever since we, you know, met, I've always thought, like, Nicki was out of my league, you know?<eos> And, please, promise me... promise me you won't say anything.<eos> Fine.<eos> Ah, I still don't know what got into you last night.<eos> [Chuckles] Well...<eos> [High-pitched voice] I do.
What do I care about those people?<eos> They don't even know what a McLaren is.<eos> A man who hasn't worked in almost a year lights himself on fire, and you're laughing about it?<eos> Lighten up, little cousin.<eos> You're not being very fun right now.<eos> I want to dance.<eos> What do you think, baby?<eos> You want to dance?<eos> Uh, no, I don't think so.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Thank God it's warming up again.<eos> Well, whatever happens, we'll get through it together, if that's what you want.<eos> Did you hear that? Yeah.<eos> Can't be the egg, though. Right? No, it's something else.<eos> Lyle. You should be resting after everything you've been through.<eos> You hear that? Huh?<eos> I think we're all gonna be resting pretty soon.<eos> Did Jim tell you about what I saw?<eos> A fresh vision of hell on my way back here.<eos> Yeah, he did.
That was my cuff link.<eos> - Technically my cuff link.<eos> - True.<eos> The pain in my legs and my feet?<eos> Is from gout.<eos> It's not life threatening, but you should try to avoid eating rich foods, red wine, oysters... that kind of thing.<eos> Yeah, where she's going, that won't be a problem.<eos> You're a traitor.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We did.
Excuse me?<eos> That's why you don't like me.<eos> When we first met, I-I looked at your breasts.<eos> Seriously?<eos> That's all I could come up with.<eos> I was pleasant and personable, I showed a reasonable amount of intelligence,<eos> I'm good-looking, I have a healthy ego.<eos> The only wrong move I made was when my eyes lingered in your upper torso area for a second too long it triggered an instant dislike for me.<eos> How do I fix that?<eos> Why did you do it?
Is she in the cell?<eos> I just went down there to tell her the good news.<eos> She's gone.<eos> Kyle, where is she?<eos> Crash came by Some idiot clerk allowed him to post bail for her.<eos> No, that's impossible.<eos> She's a minor.<eos> - They can't.<eos> - I know.<eos> - But they did.
Hey, old man.<eos> The flamethrower was a nice touch.<eos> Oh, you liked that?<eos> Yeah, I added that last minute.<eos> Well, where have you been?<eos> I thought I told you not to do anything crazy.<eos> No, you said don't do anything stupid. You didn't say anything about crazy.<eos> I know.<eos> I didn't see another way.<eos> Well, I did.
Why didn't you get extra peanut sauce?<eos> We can both play this game.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Uh, does Penny live here?<eos> May I ask why? Well, uh...<eos> I-I met her at my office, she winked at me. And, uh...<eos> I-I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.<eos> Okay, um... Look, I'm pretty sure she didn't wink at you.<eos> Oh, she did.
I made a commitment. There are higher commitments.<eos> You could have sat back, stayed quiet, watched Thin Man fail.<eos> And let Heisenberg beat us to the punch?<eos> If we fall short with the combined brain power of all the Allies and a floating line of credit from the United States government, isn't there a chance that Werner Heisenberg will fall short, too?<eos> Of course. And if we fail, and Heisenberg fails, it'll never get built.<eos> We could all go home.<eos> You could have kept quiet.<eos> But instead, you walked into my office, and you sounded the alarm.<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> And now I do.
She's not my mom.<eos> She is the woman I have to live with until I find my real mom.<eos> Which is hopefully before you guys find her.<eos> Well, to be honest, that's turned out to be a lot harder than we expected.<eos> Really?<eos> Besides you, all we've got is a tip line with sightings from 50 different countries.<eos> Who even knows what she looks like now.<eos> Or what her name is.<eos> Really, you have absolutely no idea?<eos> Neither does the FBI.
Hi, we're looking for someone who we think lives here?<eos> She looks like this?<eos> Do you know her?<eos> Cat, yeah... 2-3-4.<eos> She lives in the building?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> She moved.<eos> A month or so ago.<eos> Said she was gonna go live with her daughter.<eos> She did?
If they dig up a body in Rob's grave and it's not him, he's got a big problem.<eos> It's been two hours.<eos> Sincerely hope you know what you're doing, mate.<eos> Rob will have a man inside the coroner's office.<eos> Sorry, Frank... For dragging you out here.<eos> Truth is... I think this was more about saving me than it was Rob.<eos> Things that bad?<eos> My life's going nowhere, Frank.<eos> When they shot me, they might as well have killed me.<eos> Well, they didn't.
- I'm your wife.<eos> Your medical file said, traumatic brain injury, severe memory loss.<eos> Some kind of dissociative fugue.<eos> Hell, there was so much chemical in the air, I'm not surprised.<eos> You probably don't remember me.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Jason Shaw. Verax.<eos> I used to work for you in Iraq.<eos> Yes, you did.
- Louis.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> You once told me that my actions had consequences.<eos> Remember?<eos> Your actions yesterday have consequences too.<eos> - What did you say to gianopolous?<eos> - Not much. Just that you were the person responsible For his number two leaving him.<eos> - I was responsible?<eos> He agreed to it. - But what he didn't know was is that It was his own lawyer who came up with the idea.<eos> - And what does that...
Don't bullshit me.<eos> It hurts.<eos> What exactly do you want here?<eos> I want you and your father to figure your shit out.<eos> Because Oprah said to?<eos> No, because I have a daughter with a very controlling man, and Lord help me if she turns out half as... interesting as you.<eos> I want your father to evolve.<eos> And healing things between the two of you will be a big step toward that.<eos> Well, I would love to help, Corrine, but... in order to do that, I would actually have to give a shit what my father thought and felt about me.<eos> And I don't.
Yeah, I think someone picked it.<eos> I just lifted some prints from the door.<eos> Someone stole a corpse?<eos> I know. Pretty sick, right?<eos> So, what do you have here?<eos> Less than we thought if we don't get Ridges' body back.<eos> Taillight's out.<eos> It wasn't 10 seconds ago.<eos> You mind popping that trunk?<eos> Yes, I do.
It's brewing up a solar wind big enough to blow this whole planet away.<eos> I assumed your teachers have mentioned this.<eos> I thought it would spoil an otherwise enjoyable walk.<eos> OK.<eos> OK.<eos> Well, this is the bad news.<eos> The good news is, it's happened before.<eos> And you're still here!<eos> The Tunguska Blast, 1908 - that should have blown the whole planet off its axis.<eos> But it didn't.
Fear a little bit less, trust a bit more.<eos> Well...<eos> No, not now.<eos> Go home.<eos> Do your marking.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Then tell me.<eos> I saved you from a tiger today.<eos> I deserve at least that.<eos> Yes, you did.
I want to see if your eyebrows drop off.<eos> All of this...<eos> All of it, just to give me an army.<eos> Well, I don't need one, do I?<eos> Armies are for people who think they're right.<eos> And nobody thinks they're righter than you.<eos> Give a good man firepower and he'll never run out of people to kill.<eos> I don't want an army!<eos> Well, that's the trouble!<eos> Yes, you do!
Then you're gonna need to get the detonator away from those cylinders... as far as the cord will let you.<eos> Okay, uh...<eos> That, uh...<eos> That might be a problem.<eos> I only got about four inches.<eos> You're gonna need more than that... a couple feet at least.<eos> - Okay, well, can I, uh... can I cut the wire?<eos> - No!<eos> That is one thing you cannot do.<eos> All right, then what do I do?
You can have anything you want.<eos> How did you meet Ji-wook?<eos> He just came to me by chance.<eos> That's weird!<eos> Are you two dating?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Ji-wook doesn't talk much but you two seem kinda close.<eos> I don't even know his name.<eos> He probably doesn't know mine either.<eos> He does.
Unser's here.<eos> He needs to talk to us.<eos> - OK.<eos> - I got him. Mm-hmm.<eos> Um, thanks for...<eos> - thanks for not saying anything.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I love him.<eos> You don't even know him.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Why not?<eos> Bonjour. - You see that?<eos> You see that?<eos> Women were of a higher class back then.<eos> You probably don't remember. They were curvier.<eos> They were hairier. Then somewhere along the line, men got afraid of their mothers and wanted to screw their little sister instead.<eos> - You think oedipus had the right idea?<eos> - That makes me feel all warm inside.<eos> - I'm taking lina. - The girls don't leave.<eos> - She does.
He'll understand that you're no longer a credible witness, that you probably can't take the stand if we indict, and that there's a good chance you screwed up his whole case, not just the girl.<eos> I can't just leave her down there.<eos> You can.<eos> That's the only thing you can do.<eos> I told her I'd come back for her.<eos> You lied.<eos> You lie for a living.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The ballerina didn't used to spin.<eos> Now it does.
What?<eos> Tanner's here again.<eos> She's hoping for a mutiny, spencer.<eos> If that frizz-top-cop just gets one of us to cave...<eos> I'm not caving.<eos> Okay, but what about aria?<eos> She's totally icing us out.<eos> Is there something going on between her and hanna?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, neither does hanna.
Aria filled me in on your great idea.<eos> It's not gonna happen, spencer.<eos> What we should be doing is burning this stuff.<eos> Emily...<eos> Ali is not our friend right now.<eos> She's a dangerous person who has no problem Gambling with our lives.<eos> She's not dangerous, she's hurt.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> She doesn't want me to tell you.<eos> Oh, no, of course, she doesn't.
Lying to your boyfriend again.<eos> Nice.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Like mike montgomery knows a single real thing about you. 170 to control.<eos> Witness has identified 5th street house.<eos> Eta to the courthouse, 8 minutes. Do not release suspect in holding.<eos> I repeat, do not release cyrus petrillo.<eos> I'm the one confusing things, em.<eos> I can't trust ezra.<eos> I don't.
She's worried about you.<eos> So is Spencer and to tell you the truth, me, too.<eos> Who died and made you Oprah?<eos> So there is something wrong.<eos> Caleb, Hanna's scared.<eos> If you walk away, she's still going to be afraid.<eos> Do you want things to stay like that?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey. I didn't think you worked this shift anymore.<eos> Uh, I don't.
Ali wasn't walking around naked.<eos> Are you saying it was always someone's idea that Bethany take Ali's place?<eos> Tell me another way that Bethany ends up in that yellow top.<eos> We need to figure out a way around that picture of "A"<eos> at the hospital or we're busted.<eos> What picture of "A"?<eos> Picture of Alison.<eos> No, you said a picture of "A".<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, you did.
I'm sorry for that.<eos> Han. I'm waiting for the cookies.<eos> Did you figure out what you're gonna do with your sister's going-away present?<eos> Melissa sent me that video because she wanted me to know the truth.<eos> Her confession doesn't actually help any of us.<eos> She said it out loud.<eos> She buried Bethany.<eos> She killed her.<eos> Yeah, because she thought that I was the one who hit her.<eos> But you didn't.
We have to limit contact... no e-mails, no drops, nothing.<eos> They might be watching now.<eos> I'm sorry you're in this position.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> I won't have the details of the prince's motorcade assignment until tomorrow.<eos> Security's getting tight.<eos> I understand.<eos> Thank you, Aaron, for taking the risk.<eos> Happy to do it, Hani.
That's the number.<eos> It's okay, sweetheart.<eos> - We're...<eos> - That's the number!<eos> In Mexico, we just call this a standoff.<eos> Brett, you okay?<eos> Okay, back off!<eos> Back off!<eos> How hard did you hit him?<eos> I didn't.
♪ I shut it out of my mind ♪ What, you don't like it?<eos> No, I wouldn't say I don't like it.<eos> I'd say I hate it.<eos> ♪ Pretending to not feel alone ♪<eos> ♪ Pretending to not feel alone ♪<eos> You guys saw it.<eos> What did you think?<eos> I liked it.<eos> Shut up, you did not.<eos> I did.
Like a brother now.<eos> I know, and I'm like your sister.<eos> No...<eos> That's not what you were gonna say?<eos> No, but... um, close call.<eos> If you think of me like a brother, we can...<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no, no. I don't.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I do.
I really believed you when you said you weren't into him, because that's what you told everyone all the time.<eos> I was just trying to convince myself, which I didn't.<eos> I hate not being in control of my feelings.<eos> I hear you.<eos> See, okay, that's the other thing.<eos> I can't be into the same guy you're into... that's weird.<eos> Don't even worry about it, okay?<eos> We're all the same to Crash, just one on a potential list of girls to bang.<eos> Well, I have no intention of being that.<eos> None of us do, and yet...
So, I hear there's a good chance you could become team captain.<eos> That's very impressive for a junior.<eos> Hey, what're you doing tonight?<eos> I have a science poster to do, and then they just slammed us with a bunch of English reading.<eos> Well, I know that I'm not as exciting as either of those, but I was hoping that we could do something.<eos> You and me?<eos> Like a date?<eos> As in a date, yes.<eos> But you want me to bring Carter?<eos> No, I don't.
Even babies, you know, they can only drink milk.<eos> I think they're thinking,<eos> "you know what this milk could really use?<eos> A cookie."<eos> I think you just made a joke.<eos> I am not an animal, I am a human being.<eos> I know it's... it's like Arnold Schwarzenegger gone bad.<eos> You're too young.<eos> You don't know that reference.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay, well, at least it's not serious.<eos> It is serious.<eos> You don't know what kind of life he's led.<eos> I'm sure it's been tough,<eos> - and maybe it's to blame for what he's become. - Maybe?<eos> But it doesn't matter anymore, because now it's who he is.<eos> How can you even say that?<eos> That boy has had no one to believe in him...<eos> Ever.<eos> Now he does.
They'll be there any minute.<eos> Yeah, well, you never were a very good liar.<eos> Goodbye, Lori or Janet, or whatever you're calling yourself these days.<eos> You were amazing.<eos> - Was I?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> Thank you, for choosing us.<eos> This decision must have been very hard.<eos> - I didn't want you to regret it.<eos> - I don't.
The last time you two celebrated a birthday together, you were three years old.<eos> I think I'm gonna go with my mom.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Too bad Elizabeth is stuck here with her family.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - What do you think I mean?<eos> Okay, my son's room?<eos> Your husband knows that you and I are having an affair.<eos> Trust me, Liz, he knows.<eos> And now, so do we.
Which direction do you think she's coming from?<eos> No idea.<eos> When you talked to her last night, how upset was she when you told her I wasn't going with her?<eos> I'm sure you can imagine.<eos> She's always said her biggest fear was losing me.<eos> She must have known that would be inevitable.<eos> Thank you for arranging this meeting.<eos> This decision must have been pretty hard.<eos> I didn't want you to regret it.<eos> I don't.
Why didn't you say something?<eos> Can you please stop banging your extremely handsome partner?<eos> Did I have to tell you that?<eos> Why did you stay with me?<eos> I knew one day you'd stop.<eos> I knew he didn't mean that much to you.<eos> How?<eos> Because I know you.<eos> I know how you are when you're in love.<eos> Yes, you do.
We need to call Parrish.<eos> You're okay, Liam.<eos> You're okay.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Lydia, Meredith's gone.<eos> They found her an hour ago in her room. She hung herself.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't want to keep watching people die.<eos> I'm not sure you have much choice about that.<eos> Maybe I do.
Are you still a Kitsune?<eos> Technically.<eos> These are your grandmother's ashes.<eos> Grandma died in Eichen House.<eos> Your father had a difficult relationship with his mother.<eos> But after the things she said, and the way she acted...<eos> He thought she was crazy.<eos> Well, she said she heard things.<eos> Why did she want her ashes in here?<eos> Well, actually, she didn't.
I'm the dad.<eos> You're the son.<eos> You get it?<eos> Dad.<eos> Son.<eos> I take care of you.<eos> We're supposed to take care of each other.<eos> Hey, we're going to be all right.<eos> How do you know, Dad?<eos> I don't.
But is it still just professionals?<eos> I don't think Haigh's ever tried anything like this.<eos> I think he was taking a chance.<eos> That means anyone with the dead pool can take a chance.<eos> But if Haigh had it, then who else does?<eos> How easy is it to get this thing now?<eos> Meredith was only at my grandmother's lake house once.<eos> But... I think once was enough.<eos> How did your grandmother know her?<eos> She didn't.
He put it online.<eos> He took the money from the Hale Vault, then turned the bearer bonds into cash.<eos> He made the payments.<eos> Was it Brunski's idea to fake your death?<eos> Did he get nervous because you helped us with one of the cipher keys?<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> All you ever wanted to do was help.<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> I know you wouldn't want to be here if you didn't want to talk.<eos> I do.
I'm not gonna let you die.<eos> Eh, you might just have to concentrate on saving yourself.<eos> I don't hear it.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - No, no.<eos> There's only one way out on this side of the basement.<eos> I know.<eos> But if we don't get out of here, someone's going to die.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.
I don't work like this, all right?<eos> So go home to your original doctors, and they'll take good care of you.<eos> I knew the odds of getting you as my doctor sucked.<eos> But I figured what the hell?<eos> I mean, what was the chance I was gonna get cancer?<eos> Here I am.<eos> I take it the word "no" is not in your vocabulary.<eos> If "no" was in my vocabulary, why would I be asking you to say "yes"?<eos> When you work in pediatrics, there are always gonna be patients you really care about.<eos> And patients you don't.
Maybe.<eos> Come on, let's go home and talk about it, huh?<eos> - (sniffles)<eos> Oh, you got gifts.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Murray's a good mom.<eos> Yeah, she is.<eos> Sometimes I get tired of going home to an empty apartment.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> I do.
- Me.<eos> Duck lips?<eos> She's so cool, don't you think?<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> So, feel free to put me on instagram, tweet about me, Facebook, if anyone still looks at that.<eos> What about me, can I get a picture with you?<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> Hey, you can make that the cover of your next book.<eos> I thought you didn't want me to write about you.<eos> I don't.
That's not enough for you, is it?<eos> You'd still leave us.<eos> I can't answer that.<eos> You already did.<eos> She found your escape backpack... Elizabeth.<eos> What?<eos> It's gone.<eos> - Carter wait.<eos> - She took it.<eos> No, no, she didn't.
I was in a coma?<eos> It was a little coma.<eos> Just long enough to scare us all to death.<eos> Why does all the fun stuff happen to you?<eos> Abduction, seizure, coma.<eos> I kissed Gabe, didn't I?<eos> Yes, you certainly did.<eos> Taylor...<eos> I really don't like him.<eos> Except, you do...
I'm gonna grab some wooden stakes from the trunk and do the blessing.<eos> [ muffled breathing continues ] Is Marie gonna get eaten?<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Soon as that curtain rises, we are gonna be there to take out this Calliope.<eos> Hey. How you doing, champ?<eos> This...<eos> If I hadn't written this dumb play, none of this would've happened.<eos> Okay, well, first of all, uh, the play's not dumb.<eos> I thought you didn't believe in this interpretation.<eos> I don't.
Humans.<eos> I never learn.<eos> What's in the box?<eos> It's not really a policeman, is it?<eos> You want to know what's in that box?<eos> I'll tell you what's in that box.<eos> It's a time machine, it also travels in space, and it usually contains a man who just wants to get on with his work of preventing the end of the world, but keeps being interrupted by boring little humans.<eos> Cool. So, that's really a spaceship?<eos> I'm serious, I'm trying to save this planet.<eos> End of the world for me tonight, whatever you do.
He doesn't speak for the library!<eos> I speak for the library. Who speaks first, speaks for the library.<eos> Technically, that is true.<eos> That is true technically. Is there not to be an intercession?<eos> No, I don't believe there should be.<eos> You do not speak for the library.<eos> Is there not to be an intercession?<eos> Intercess all you want, mate, as long as I'm intercessing with my double cheese, extra pep.<eos> I'm assuming he doesn't have my pizza on him. No.<eos> No, he does not.
That's what I keep telling him.<eos> Celebrate?<eos> - Yo, Mikey.<eos> - What's up?<eos> So, man, hey, can I talk to you real quick in private?<eos> Can it wait, actually?<eos> We have a special guest.<eos> - Our A.D. Foster is here.<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> How you doing?
What do you mean action?<eos> Escort service.<eos> Girls will come home.<eos> No, it's not safe.<eos> It's absolutely safe, Lali.<eos> This is Delhi.<eos> You can get everything with just a call.<eos> Lali, you backed out the last time as well. Let's try it once.<eos> We might get lucky.<eos> - Only boys do such things.
Fine.<eos> Great, I'll play along.<eos> Blood.<eos> Whose is it? Gagnon!<eos> It's mine.<eos> May I have it, please?<eos> Already had my fingerprints and DNA on it. And now it has yours, too.<eos> Tell me what this is about.<eos> Like you don't know.<eos> I don't.
I'm gonna find that piece of...<eos> - That's what I'm saying.<eos> It's about time we kicked a little ass around here.<eos> I say we hunt it down and blow its brains out.<eos> Fine, let's do this.<eos> Let's not fly off the handle. You said it yourself. - Ben!<eos> - We don't know what Lexi is.<eos> We don't know how she got this way. This could be a real opportunity to understand what Karen did to her and why.<eos> Fine.<eos> But we do this my way.
I just<eos> - didn't think that you remembered.<eos> - He's my godson.<eos> How could I forget?<eos> Plus, you know, Eve puts all that stuff on my calendar and reminds me the day before, calls me the day of.<eos> This guy wouldn't know how to tie his own shoe without a detailed e-mail from his assistant.<eos> But I can perform an appendectomy with my eyes closed.<eos> Hey, he's no slouch himself.<eos> Did he tell you he finished second in his class in Harvard?<eos> He did not.
So I didn't eat.<eos> I just let him order whatever he wanted.<eos> He was in the middle of telling me a really good story about his school, how he... came in second place in the triple jump at Sports Day.<eos> He even had a little medal.<eos> So, what happened to him then?<eos> A bomb went off... he was wiped off the face of the earth!<eos> And you let the people who did it get away.<eos> Well... if we did, I'm sorry.<eos> I know that you have the computers and my hard drives.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Yeah, I'm just trying to liven up the place a bit.<eos> I'm hosting an event tonight.<eos> A pledge drive of sorts.<eos> Got to make an impression, right?<eos> Now, what can I do for you?<eos> You can stop.<eos> You can stop sending me flowers, and you can stop texting me and calling me and emailing me, because I spam them, anyway.<eos> Oh, is "spam" a verb now?<eos> Because I am never, ever, ever going to work for you.<eos> Actually, you already do.
So help make Star City our future.<eos> So you're the Arrow.<eos> I thought you'd be taller.<eos> It's over.<eos> Lower your bow and live.<eos> We both know that's not going to happen.<eos> Who hired you? !<eos> Who's she?<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yes, I do!
- Pick up a bottle of wine. - (giggles)<eos> Get that bread you like, with the cheese.<eos> We could head down to the water and...<eos> Pretend.<eos> Yeah. Maybe.<eos> That'd be nice.<eos> - Let someone else be cops for a while. - Oh...<eos> You've done enough.<eos> Give Jo time to find the antidote, let us all take over.<eos> What if she doesn't?
To the right as you go out the door.<eos> Thanks.<eos> AL: Excuse me.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> What?<eos> No, Al. Come on. I think I'm old enough to go pee-pee by myself.<eos> Not like this you're not.<eos> All right, listen. This isn't Cavanaugh's. And it's not a Tuesday night.<eos> You remember Cavanaugh's?<eos> Yeah. I do.
I-I think I need a refill.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> He's lying.<eos> He's lying about everything.<eos> If you're right, there should be blood evidence in the kitchen.<eos> It was here.<eos> It happened right here.<eos> He must have cleaned it up.<eos> Why else would he invite us so freely into his house?<eos> If he did, he did a hell of a good job of it.
I killed him because he killed my mom.<eos> Your mother committed suicide.<eos> No, he made her do that, all right?<eos> She... she was fine before, okay?<eos> And my mother...<eos> I never got the chance to tell her...<eos> I said some really terrible things to her.<eos> Listen to me, Connor.<eos> I'm a mother, and I promise you, your mother knew you were sorry.<eos> No, she didn't.
I mean, I could half believe that.<eos> Liz, I wouldn't do it with any screw.<eos> Of course you wouldn't, and that's why you've gotta stick to your guns.<eos> She's gonna take my baby or worse, she'll kill it.<eos> Come on, come on, you're being ridiculous.<eos> Darling, she is just trying to intimidate you, Dor.<eos> Well, it's working!<eos> You have got to be strong.<eos> It's easy for you to say. You don't even have kids, Liz.<eos> I do.
I'll sniff around.<eos> All right.<eos> For your information, I already own a big, beautiful yacht.<eos> Oh, is that what you call that thing?<eos> Fine. It's a mahogany sunfish.<eos> Hey.<eos> Got to say, for a family that just lost two members, you all...seem fine.<eos> Well, Sam, I'll let you in on a little family secret.<eos> We don't really like each other.<eos> Then again, what family does?
- Oh, come on.<eos> He's married.<eos> - Right.<eos> Like that ever stopped anyone.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome, miss.<eos> How'd you guys make out?<eos> Oh, like thieves.<eos> That true?<eos> Yeah, we did pretty well.
Of course you do.<eos> What?<eos> You.<eos> You're so... impressed with yourself.<eos> "Look at me.<eos> Look at what I did.<eos> I'm bringing democracy to Abbudin."<eos> You really believe he can do this... win the votes and the love of the people?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Stop it.<eos> I'm doing something serious...<eos> See what people say on the forum<eos> Another drug addict attempting suicide looks like she has a good body should've been a hooker to benefit society<eos> Spot on.<eos> Bastards.<eos> They don't even know why she tried to kill herself and gossip about her they have an opinion for everything all bullshit!<eos> Why did that girl jump?<eos> You know?<eos> I don't!
I think this bookshelf slides open.<eos> What do you think is down there?<eos> Could be a storage cellar.<eos> Or it could be how Zaheer got in and out.<eos> Aiwei's coming back.<eos> Quick!<eos> What are you doing in my house?<eos> you are trespassing on the property of one of the highestranked officials in the city.<eos> You had better have a good explanation.<eos> We do, we do.
This is my job!<eos> Don't lecture me about jobs!<eos> Enough.<eos> Korra, listen to Lin.<eos> But.... they... please.<eos> Lin's only looking out for you.<eos> I promise you Aiwei and everyone he's working with will be brought to justice.<eos> Fine.<eos> If you really think it's best.<eos> I do.
When I was in jail, penniless, she left me.<eos> Her loss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't make the love stop.<eos> Does it get any easier?<eos> No.<eos> Indeed, no, it does not.<eos> You didn't come to bed.<eos> Well, I had work to do, and I figured you didn't want me there.<eos> Of course I do.
- Her therapist says it's okay.<eos> - Then definitely not.<eos> She wants us to go in there with her.<eos> Where, to therapy?<eos> Do we have to?<eos> I don't think it's such a bad idea for us.<eos> Yeah, you've been kind of distant lately.<eos> It's just... it's just this book.<eos> And you don't want to fuck me anymore.<eos> Of course I do.
Obviously they weren't murdered on the premises, and you're still looking for them, so it must mean they were kidnapped, which is why my client provides valet service, to encourage safety.<eos> You still have I.C.E. on your speed dial?<eos> Of course.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go show Commander McGinnis that you're not just a paper pusher.<eos> Mr. Tariiji's heart breaks for their families, but he's not responsible for their absence.<eos> Mr. Tariiji, I'm captain Raydor.<eos> This is Deputy Chief Howard, and we're here to discuss your visa issues.<eos> My client has no visa issues.<eos> He does now.
This is a warrant... and this is a document pertaining to the Official Secrets Act... - which I'm... I'm gonna need you to sign.<eos> Terrorism Prevention...<eos> - And if I call the police...? - Yeah...<eos> Of course.<eos> Here... use my phone.<eos> The number's 999.<eos> No.<eos> Actually... I'll use our phones.<eos> If you think that's best.<eos> Yeah, I do!
Oh... you left the music box.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> We used to hum that song together when you were little.<eos> You remember?<eos> No, because you're not my mother.<eos> You didn't hum anything to me.<eos> And the only reason you remember is because my father told you.<eos> I thought all the years that I spent with your father and the love that we shared would count for something.<eos> Well, it doesn't.
- McKenzie had it on him.<eos> Well, did he give it to you?<eos> Mm, not exactly.<eos> He kept it at home, not at the office.<eos> Well, that still doesn't explain how you got it.<eos> We kind of broke in and took it.<eos> Journalistic probable cause.<eos> Where is that?<eos> We don't know.<eos> I do.
He gets a free pass?<eos> One thing at a time.<eos> Eleanor works for him.<eos> We take down fausto first, then we see.<eos> Caramel corn?<eos> So, how's jesus?<eos> I don't see him anymore.<eos> Oh. That's sad.<eos> So, how do you feel about journalists?<eos> I don't.
"Slippers for the stubborn."<eos> [gasps] Mules.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Coffee?<eos> Yeah, I'd love some, but we have a dead<eos> - girl in Kenmore Square.<eos> - We do?
Yes.<eos> Once he pulled the wire tips out of his heart, they stimulated everything they touched, including the nerve to your diaphragm.<eos> We refer to this habit as twiddler's syndrome.<eos> So it wasn't a heart attack?<eos> No.<eos> Just concern for your daughter.<eos> Ashley, I'm so sorry about the trial.<eos> Divya had it under control.<eos> You didn't have to come in.<eos> Of course I did.
- Sure.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> What?<eos> Listen, Passaic, I know you're trying to help, but Russel and I don't want to build an empire, so go take over the Hamptons for someone else.<eos> I'm going to run my business the way I want.<eos> Paige.<eos> [Whispers] Who is it?<eos> Who is it?<eos> I guess she didn't roll over today after all, so you didn't miss anything.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Yeah, well, what about this one?<eos> Florida.<eos> Wasn't anywhere near domesticated.<eos> Brought him back to the surface for five minutes.<eos> Five minutes, and then he went into convulsions and died.<eos> And these are the only ones who carried I.D.s.<eos> What about Nevada?<eos> I believe I was out when you worked on her.<eos> Yeah, you don't want to know about Nevada.<eos> Yes, I do.
- He say where we was?<eos> - No, and I didn't ask.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> Aw, come on, guys.<eos> I've been through this before. Answer the question.<eos> Treated Abe and myself to a fat, juicy steak and a bottle of wine at ringside, the restaurant, not the gym.<eos> Check if you like.<eos> Why are they back, Abe?<eos> They must know what I did.<eos> - You didn't do nothing.
Hey, don't hold back.<eos> Nobody's going inside.<eos> What are you...<eos> I got a fight.<eos> Anyone who doesn't belong here should go.<eos> This is harassment.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> You killed Bobby and Abe.<eos> You must have some pretty good evidence to make a charge like that.<eos> We do.
I mean, after all, isn't that how you were able to afford electric skateboards and extravagant beds that we don't even want?<eos> We're getting electric skateboards?<eos> It wasn't extravagant.<eos> It was a wedding gift.<eos> - OK. Just inappropriate.<eos> - Stef, come on.<eos> I mean, a bed is a very personal thing.<eos> And not only did you buy us a bed without asking us, but you got rid of the one that we love.<eos> Look, if you don't like the bed, please...<eos> We don't.

I'm sick and tired of running.<eos> Of everyone around me dying.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Killing that man is not the answer.<eos> Then what is?<eos> I don't have anywhere else to go.<eos> I don't have anyone else to turn to.<eos> I don't have anything but this.<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
You think she's trying to put her family back together?<eos> Or he might know where she took him.<eos> I wish I could help, but I haven't seen Judith since we divorced.<eos> Which is right after your son died.<eos> Yes, but things weren't good between us before that.<eos> She was... impulsive?<eos> One minute, she hated me. The next was total love.<eos> Mr. Peterson, do you have any idea where she might have gone?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't.
This your son?<eos> James.<eos> He's such a cutie.<eos> Looks just like you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's Judith, right?<eos> Is it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. It is, but you can call me Judy.<eos> All my friends do.
How's Barry doing?<eos> - It's a secret.<eos> - What kind of secret?<eos> The kind I have to keep.<eos> I just have a little experience with liking someone who doesn't see you the same way.<eos> - Dad, the thing is...<eos> - You two are dating.<eos> - So you're not mad.<eos> - Oh, I'm mad.<eos> What does the fastest man alive do on his day off?
In the wake of that, you can understand why Cisco would want to be prepared for the worst.<eos> I can understand that, but what I can't understand is why you didn't tell me what you did.<eos> I mean, after all we've been through, I thought you trusted me.<eos> - I thought we were friends.<eos> - We are, Barry.<eos> I mean, if you would have just told me, I could have been prepared.<eos> But instead, someone died tonight.<eos> And I have to live with that.<eos> No, Cisco.<eos> We all do.
It's a treacherous journey.<eos> You will need your strength.<eos> Eat this.<eos> Oh, my God, you have food.<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> What doesn't make sense?<eos> How Adalind did this.<eos> For this to have worked,<eos> Adalind would've had to have lost her powers at some point.<eos> Uh, yeah, she did.
I'm afraid he is.<eos> How?<eos> Did... how did that happen?<eos> We're waiting for the autopsy, but until we figure out cause of death, we're investigating it as a possible homicide.<eos> Tell us what happened last night.<eos> How'd you hurt your wrist?<eos> I fell.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Whoa, looks like the bad guy's winning.<eos> He always does.
No!<eos> Uncle Ben!<eos> Stop, it's not working.<eos> Stop! Don't!<eos> No, don't!<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Stop it! Let go!<eos> - What the hell is he doing?<eos> - Please don't.
Come on. We're grasping at straws here.<eos> Well, I believe that Lexi has changed at the cellular level.<eos> Her human and Espheni DNA strands have conjoined and become something new and altogether different.<eos> It doesn't explain her becoming an evil thing capable of killing Lourdes.<eos> Lexi isn't evil.<eos> I don't accept that. Well, I don't accept it, either. I don't...<eos> I don't want to.<eos> I've come to know your daughter these past few months, and I've come to care for her.<eos> It pains me to think that she lost touch with her humanity.<eos> She didn't.
DUI.<eos> I occasionally see this movie director guy. Gross.<eos> One time, he booty-texted me from some awards show.<eos> I was already at the bar, so I drove over to his house, and then he texted me he was going to be late, so I idly drove around his neighborhood... until I kind of sideswiped an off-duty cop.<eos> Do you know, I'm glad this is a one-night thing, so we can reveal all this awful shit about ourselves.<eos> Totally.<eos> High five.<eos> I'll get that.<eos> Okay, I like that.<eos> All girls do.
No.<eos> I've watched you for two years now get girls to come home with you, and they're always gone in the morning.<eos> Sorry, I can help it if she refused to leave?<eos> Give me my controller.<eos> No.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm sorry I have to do this.<eos> Now, I don't mind you being jerky with me because I know you care.<eos> What the...<eos> No, I don't.

But she had this vision.<eos> She said that the money would come.<eos> The master bedroom!<eos> We were gonna grow old together in that house, you know, raise a family, be happy.<eos> - Break it in?<eos> - Break it in!<eos> And that's what I wanted. Really good.<eos> It was the American dream, if that even exists anymore.<eos> But that day, I totally believed in it.<eos> We both did.
Pop?<eos> Francis, I'm in the sunroom.<eos> I'm having a whiskey.<eos> You want one?<eos> We have a guest.<eos> Well, does he want one?<eos> No, she doesn't.
Nope, I know.<eos> So, I've done business with Hoffman.<eos> He's a good detective.<eos> Why did he steal your collar?<eos> We graduated from the academy together.<eos> He was second in the class.<eos> So he just has it out for number one?<eos> I don't know what his problem is.<eos> But he made detective and you haven't yet, so maybe you have the same kind of problem.<eos> Maybe I do.
From who?<eos> Eiling?<eos> Eiling is a dangerous man, Barry.<eos> We do not want him as an enemy.<eos> After the lighting bolt, what if you hadn't found me?<eos> It could've been me.<eos> Hunted, on the run, cut off from everyone I know and care about.<eos> You guys saved me.<eos> And I want to save her just as bad as you do, Barry.<eos> We all do.
Well you tell me, it was your weapon.<eos> And you're going to answer for it.<eos> Attempted murder.<eos> Unless of course she dies.<eos> I've got about six witnesses to say those injuries were self-inflicted.<eos> Nice try.<eos> You know what? She could have cut me right there, and she didn't.<eos> Got a knife, bang.<eos> Right up there.<eos> She did it to herself.
Get her some air and remind her of the rules.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Hanging all over my guests.<eos> And her?<eos> She was practically unconscious.<eos> I thought that's what this party was all about.<eos> You think that's what I wanted to see from you?<eos> You're here because of who you are, not because of who you think I want you to be.<eos> Well, I wanted to show you that I know what I'm doing.<eos> But you don't.
Okay, ready?<eos> Feeling any better?<eos> All right, I guess.<eos> What did you...?<eos> What did you give me?<eos> Haldol, to calm you down.<eos> I can't take that.<eos> It's not good for my baby.<eos> Coco, you don't have a baby.<eos> But I will, really.
We are not going to waste time training ER docs on equipment they'll use once a year.<eos> If we had the saw, we could give midline thoracotomies for all penetrating chest traumas.<eos> That's not the standard of care.<eos> The standard of care gives miserable results.<eos> If they arrest in the ambulance, 10% survive.<eos> If they arrest in the ER, 30% survive.<eos> Midline thoracotomy gives us better exposure to repair cardiac injuries.<eos> All right.<eos> If you're so damned interested in this, do a study.<eos> - All right, I will.
I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far.<eos> How about we play for more money?<eos> Say 1 50?<eos> One hundred and fifty dollars.<eos> Say 200?<eos> Two hundred dollars!<eos> You're doing it again.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> -l don't want to lose $200.<eos> -We won't.
... Ihadamajorcrushonyou .<eos> I knew.<eos> You did?<eos> I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.<eos> I did.<eos> Listen, do you think--<eos> Try not to let my intense vulnerability become a factor.<eos> Would it be okay if I asked you out sometime?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Okay, maybe I will.
Oh, sweetie.<eos> Thanks. What?<eos> Just kidding.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Got you again. You're so easy!<eos> If anything happens to him<eos> The vet said it's a simple procedure.<eos> Things can go wrong.<eos> What if he doesn't make it?<eos> -He will, Joe.
Good.<eos> They took the bomber alive.<eos> It's a woman.<eos> She might lead us directly to Halir.<eos> We wouldn't need Formitz anymore.<eos> - I thought you'd like to know.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> She broke?<eos> No.<eos> And she won't.
Terry sprained her ankle.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> Why didn't she report?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe she thought she could shake it off.<eos> Did you see it?<eos> Not at first.<eos> Why am I on trial here?<eos> Why don't you just ask her?<eos> I will.
I like her.<eos> She's very... easy-going.<eos> And resourceful.<eos> - She's stealing our money.<eos> - What?<eos> Locked.<eos> Step back.<eos> Kitana!<eos> If the Emperor finds out, we're finished.<eos> - He won't.
You want me to let Robert Sippel move into a cell?<eos> Just until he finds a landlord who will rent him a room.<eos> I need to see the shift log.<eos> He'll have to stay in Gen Pop.<eos> - He'll be at risk.<eos> - Yeah, he's aware of that.<eos> He's not gonna get an apartment unless he has a job.<eos> Well, that's my next mission.<eos> I gotta find somebody who will hire a defrocked priest.<eos> - l will.
I've seen cases like yours.<eos> It's treatable.<eos> Yeah, I will take care of it later.<eos> It's time to think Jimmy.<eos> I messed up, Jarod.<eos> I let down my father and almost killed my little brother.<eos> You didn't know that Brinkman messed with the engine.<eos> I know now.<eos> I am going to do everything I can to make it right.<eos> We all will.
You've got two days to make the kid talk, after that I'll do it in my way.<eos> Angelo has been moved.<eos> Do you know anything about that, Miss Parker?<eos> Are you talking to me?<eos> Exactly one hour after he was moved, I was notified I'm under Tower review.<eos> As we speak, they've set cleaners scour in my personal files, my office, everything.<eos> I'm crying on the inside.<eos> If you sessions don't happen without a directive.<eos> If I find out you are behind this...<eos> You'll what?
That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Frankenstein...<eos> Frankenstein...<eos> Frankenstein!<eos> REMBRANDT: Man, that rain stinks!<eos> The cable's hooked up.<eos> REMBRANDT: Okay. One good lightning bolt and you're cooking.<eos> Thank you, Igor.<eos> This won't work.<eos> Sure it will.
- - They'r e gonna cut Santori.<eos> -<eos> - The placekicker? He's made eight field-goal attempts in thr ee games and has connected on a grand total of none of them.<eos> - - Oh, I've met him.<eos> He's a good guy.<eos> - - Can't kick. -<eos> - He is a good guy.<eos> -<eos> - Can't kick. - - He'll get picked up by another team.<eos> - - No, he won't.
Yes. Then you will allow me to stabilize the remaining molecules.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> Your Starfleet Directive is no longer relevant.<eos> I have found a way to control Omega. I don't care if you can make it sing and dance. We're getting rid of it.<eos> A foolish decision.<eos> Yes, but it's mine to make. Now, step aside.<eos> I could've done this without your permission, but I chose to follow your command structure.<eos> I should've made the attempt.<eos> I still can.<eos> But you won't.
Yeah, I know that.<eos> Let's just make as big a dent as possible. OK?<eos> Ready and awaiting your order, sir.<eos> OK.<eos> Well, I suppose now is the time for me to say something profound.<eos> Nothing comes to mind. Let's do it.<eos> O'Neill, Apophis's ship approaches.<eos> We heard him say he'd rejoin Klorel once they came out of the shadows.<eos> Teal'c, if we can knock out this ship, will it stop them?<eos> It will not.
So, she's hot.<eos> Oh, so hot!<eos> Okay, are you okay?<eos> Umm, yeah.<eos> Donna, how can you be okay?<eos> There's a college woman sleeping in his bed.<eos> He's sleeping in the basement.<eos> Donna, stair are not going to stop a high school horn dog.<eos> Barbed wire will not stop a high school horn dog.<eos> A wall of fire will not...
By the gods, she's alive.<eos> Are you comfortable?<eos> It won't last long. When darkness comes, my child will awake.<eos> He'll be hungry.<eos> -Gabrielle, slow down!<eos> -Xena, we're almost there!<eos> Look You'll blow the plan if you don't get focused!<eos> You lose your head, and we are history!<eos> The thought of Hope with my family... -I mean, if she were to hurt them...<eos> -She won't.
This isn't so bad, Ares.<eos> "River of Wailing", is it?<eos> I thought you were different from her.<eos> I thought you had a regard for life, no matter whose.<eos> You're not going to die, Crassus.<eos> I said I'd switch you.<eos> Now if the guards recognize who you are, I have no control over that.<eos> Don't rely on that.<eos> Most of Rome doesn't know what I look like, let alone the prison guards.<eos> You will with this.
Dorian's right to be concerned, Xena.<eos> Why don't you leave me and go on ahead?<eos> The advance scouts travel a day ahead of the main force..., ...so we still have time.<eos> Be honest with me Xena.<eos> How bad is this poison?<eos> It didn't hit a main artery.<eos> This poultice will delay the effects until we can get to Tripolis and treat it with a serum.<eos> By tomorrow you'll be trying those flips again... with a staff.<eos> -If she dies...<eos> -She won't.
I promised Xena I'd switch you for Vercinix!<eos> Then you really are in the middle of it.<eos> I thought you were different from her.<eos> I thought you had a regard for life, no matter whose.<eos> You're not going to die, Crassus.<eos> I said I'd switch you.<eos> Now if the guards recognize who you are, I have no control over that.<eos> Don't rely on that.<eos> Most of Rome doesn't know what I look like, let alone the prison guards.<eos> You will with this.
It kept going off...<eos> For some reason.<eos> False alarms.<eos> Might want to try and use it again.<eos> OK?<eos> We're going to check the windows and doors, see if anybody tried to break in.<eos> We'll keep watch over the house.<eos> - We'll do the best we can.<eos> If anything else happens, you'll call us.<eos> - We will.
I'm going to have to, Joe, somehow.<eos> - You'd better do it soon.<eos> - I don't know how, but somehow.<eos> She needs you pretty bad.<eos> I've been visiting her most every day.<eos> She asks for you a lot.<eos> Sometimes she thinks I'm you and calls me Sonny.<eos> I'm going to try to make it.<eos> Tell her to hold on.<eos> I will, brother.
Tell her to hold on.<eos> I will, brother.<eos> Be very careful, whatever you do.<eos> Tell her that I built the prettiest little church this side of heaven out in the wild wood.<eos> Tell her that.<eos> Tell her the bad boy done it again.<eos> I can't make it.<eos> I'm going to try, but tell her to hold on.<eos> OK, Sonny.<eos> I will.
- Excellent. Send him in.<eos> Run and fetch Mr Bean, will you?<eos> - We're about to fire him.<eos> - Marvellous.<eos> Mr Bean is the worst employee in the gallery's history.<eos> Good afternoon, sir.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Before moving on to the major business, I'd like to broach the question of Mr Bean.<eos> Mr Bean has worked for us for many years.<eos> And will for many more.
What are you talking about?<eos> Why don't you ask Liam why he burnt down the gym?<eos> I just follow orders.<eos> He's way out of control, Joe.<eos> Hello, Maggie.<eos> Hi. It's your dad.<eos> All right.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> Sure you never will.
Excuse me! A glass of water, please!"<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> Say nothing at all...<eos> "l'm afraid, Rahul.<eos> Don't leave me I'm scared"<eos> Now quietly go to sleep! Good night!<eos> First promise me that you won't leave me.<eos> "Okay, baby, I shan't leave you alone."<eos> "You won't leave me, even if I ask for an ice-cream, will you?"<eos> "No, I won't."
You spot him, you take him out.<eos> Understood.<eos> - Be careful, D.J.<eos> - Don't worry about Weir.<eos> I'll take care of him.<eos> D.J.?<eos> D.J.? D.J., answer me!<eos> Okay, Dr. Weir.<eos> You don't wanna leave your ship?<eos> You never will.
- I, Elsie Wright...<eos> Be serious. - Sorry.<eos> I, Frances Griffiths... hereby, on this day...<eos> - hereby, on this day... swear never again to break the code of fairy secrecy.<eos> Say it.<eos> Swear never again to break the code of fairy secrecy.<eos> Didn't hurt.<eos> Fairies, we call to you.<eos> What happens if we break our promise?<eos> We won't!
- Oh, we are!<eos> We are with this!<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - I swear it.<eos> - Nearly 25.<eos> - All right, I'll leave it open.<eos> - But don't let it drop. - No!<eos> Say you won't have me arrested or I'll kill you, Dad.<eos> You won't shoot me.<eos> - Oh-ho, yes, I will.
Who's behind this?<eos> Who did this to me?<eos> - Why?<eos> - What do you mean, why?<eos> How deluded can you be?<eos> It could've been any asshole with a couple of hundred million in the bank.<eos> Get your boss up here.<eos> Tell him I'm gonna shoot someone.<eos> They won't do it.<eos> Yes, they will.
I keep tellin' them, but they don't see it.<eos> - They're not as watchful as you.<eos> - They're too busy thinking about themselves.<eos> A greasy pole.<eos> - No loyalty. - No, um,<eos> Iove.<eos> I promised to protect her... from people like you.<eos> [Chuckling] For once in my life, I'm not the issue.<eos> - She'll never understand it.<eos> - Oh, in time she will.
What does he shrink with it?<eos> Hemorrhoids?<eos> - That is not funny.<eos> - Admit it, Adam.<eos> Your dad's a loser.<eos> He is not.<eos> And if he were here... he'd kill you for what you've done to his bookshelf.<eos> Is that so, daddy's boy?<eos> Well, he's not here, so I guess you're gonna have to do something about it.<eos> W-W-Well, maybe I will.
Two meters tall, long snout binocular vision, strong forearms, killing claws on both feet.<eos> The Rexes may track us, too, if they feel we're a threat to their infant.<eos> No, we'll lose them once we leave their territory.<eos> Tyrannosaur has the largest proportional olfactory cavity of any creature in fossil record, except one.<eos> The Turkey Vulture could scent up to 10 miles.<eos> Right. This is all very thrilling, but I say we should head for the village.<eos> We could head back down to the lagoon.<eos> And sit out in the open, near a heavily used water source...<eos> - ... hope that your captain comes back?<eos> - He won't.
He'd be right!<eos> Because by all the evidence, Jim Williams is an innocent man.<eos> But I'm not Perry Mason.<eos> I'm not some TV lawyer.<eos> So I got to scratch and tear at the prosecution's case trying to whittle it down to nothing.<eos> And darned if I don't think I have!<eos> Because the fabrication of the prosecution's case is in pieces.<eos> When you consider how Detective Boone has consistently lied about bagging the hands.<eos> Does that surprise you that a detective would lie?<eos> Of course he will.
It's a wedding gift.<eos> Take it.<eos> This is a sacred event. I know it's sacred.<eos> This is sacred, too.<eos> Just take it. It's legal.<eos> Don't nobody know about it.<eos> How many did you keep? Enough.<eos> Now get married.<eos> Lord, forgive me.<eos> He will.
You murdering bastards!<eos> What happened in the square was not my doing.<eos> - It was your men.<eos> - Dan!<eos> To us. Man.<eos> Stand back, or more will die.<eos> Aye.<eos> And you among 'em.<eos> You should leave, Sharpe.<eos> - I will not.
Value.<eos> The value of what we had between us is short by 10,000 guineas.<eos> Is money everything?<eos> It is to you, Jane.<eos> The minute you found a lord, you lifted your skirt and fell on your back.<eos> What's your favor?<eos> Do not ask him to sell the estate.<eos> I've already asked him and he's already promised me.<eos> - He will not do it.<eos> - He will.
One pound, three shillings and ten pence a day.<eos> What are you, a general?<eos> Lieutenant Colonel.<eos> Strewth, live well on that, you could.<eos> - Well, I could.<eos> - I do. More money than I've ever been paid in my life.<eos> Sad, innit?<eos> And now you'll most likely get killed.<eos> - Not me.<eos> - Yeah, you will.
Be off to the ball, sir.<eos> Bugger balls!<eos> If he won't do his job, I will.<eos> Harris, Daniel.<eos> Let's stop them, the French.<eos> They're still not sure what they face.<eos> Patrick...<eos> Will you put Lucille on a barge to Antwerp?<eos> And from there to England, should we lose this fight.<eos> I will.
You've torn it, and you've got your fingerprints all over it! Book.<eos> He left his fingerprints on it. He left his fingerprints on the tennis book.<eos> See, when I press the button, the bear will come right through. There's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing in the world.<eos> Book. Tennis book.<eos> He left his fingerprints on it. What happened back there?<eos> - There's prints on it.<eos> - What?<eos> Dell must have left his prints on the torn tennis book.<eos> Well... We'll have to get back to New York and get it.<eos> Well, indeed, we will.
Let's go this way.<eos> Come on.<eos> I make my own luck.<eos> So do I.<eos> Come on!<eos> No, come on.<eos> Let's go this way.<eos> This way!<eos> Go back to the main stairwell and everything will be sorted out there.<eos> The hell it will!
Anyting des'ined 'o be good for you can only be good.<eos> How am I 'o know you better, unders'and you better and be a good influence, seeing you once a week?<eos> If you're no' kep' in on Sunday, come 'o 'e Cave and paddle inside.<eos> Do no' read; "Piddle."<eos> I have a cold.<eos> You always have colds.<eos> Do you hide my letters?<eos> In my desk, under my books.<eos> - If De Pradts looks...<eos> - He won't!
Two wonderful plays which will run for years.<eos> Back comes Bosie, and what have you written since?<eos> You know how much I... love and admire you... but you're throwing your genius away.<eos> - For what?<eos> - It's highly ironic.<eos> Queensberry thinks Bosie and I are locked in nightly embrace... and in reality, we've been the purest model of Greek love since...<eos> Bosie doesn't like doing it with me, but I've loved him.<eos> - I've educated him.<eos> - But he's never grown up.<eos> And he never will.
To tell him I didn't love him.<eos> Milly, I'm going to go back to London... tomorrow.<eos> Because of me?<eos> Because of you, because of Merton... and because of me.<eos> I'm in your way. Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Would you really mind if I left?<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> Please don't lie to me.<eos> I don't want you to hate me.<eos> I won't.
Save us, Satan!<eos> Beat that guy for us! Satan!<eos> Get him!<eos> Mister Satan...<eos> I am the world champion! No matter the opponent, it will not do for me to run away!<eos> S- see here! You guys!<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing!<eos> You pull a selfish stunt like that, a- and I, the world champion Mister Satan, will...!<eos> Mister Satan will...!<eos> Satan will...
What are you doing?<eos> I am Killing the germs of poverty<eos> Get out of here<eos> No!<eos> Why?<eos> Do you remember my sister's last words?<eos> What did she say?<eos> She said I must stay here till your death<eos> So until I cremate you, have taken of your ashes, I won't leave this house<eos> I won't
It's just a wooden door, you know. I can still hear through it.<eos> Good, now hear this:<eos> Dad wants me to take you to get your tetanus shot, and I'm going to, and it's not going to be that bad.<eos> Oh, right, and at what point after the long, sharp piece of metal pierces my flesh does "that bad" start?<eos> I'm not going.<eos> Look, I'll go get a screwdriver and maybe we can take the doorknob off or something.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Look, why are you making such a big deal out of this?<eos> What if the needle goes right through my arm?<eos> It won't.
- Don't you have a date with the rabbi?<eos> - I had to reschedule.<eos> It's hard dating a rabbi after a day of blackmail.<eos> It was easier being sleazy knowing you were with me.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm going to go up and pack.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I'll be here with the Biscuit.<eos> - Tell Billy to hurry up, will you?<eos> - I will.
Just talk about that.<eos> I shouldn't work for you anymore.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, well, lately, it, it... ... doesn'tseem... ... itdoesn'talwaysfeellike work .<eos> I have to think hard to even remember him as a professor.<eos> You never mentioned him before.<eos> Yeah, I couldn't even admit it to myself.<eos> I haven't even told Renee yet, or anybody and--<eos> Oh, God, please, you cannot tell a soul.<eos> I won't.
I'm fine.<eos> I've been doing a great deal of thinking, Zack.<eos> There are several hundred unpleasant things I've been avoiding doing... since I got back from Z'Ha'Dum.<eos> Now with Delenn gone, I don't have any excuses.<eos> I have to start taking care of them.<eos> I checked Mr. Garibaldi's file.<eos> When he resigned as chief of security... regulations required that he turn in his link, his Identicard and his weapon.<eos> This has not been done.<eos> Why? Well, he's going to come back sooner or later, captain.<eos> Maybe he will, maybe he won't.
Ivanova, good.<eos> I was just about to call you.<eos> I've been going over these reports... trying to figure out how we're going to get along... with all our supply shipments from Earth cut off by the embargo.<eos> We've got two, maybe three months of reserves.<eos> Then we are going to run out of things. Small things at first, then more important things.<eos> Something breaks, we may not be able to fix it. And you can forget the spare parts for the fighters.<eos> We can go black market if we have to.<eos> We will.
- I have homework to do.<eos> And... my mom's not really feeling well and she could probably use my help.<eos> And, to be truthful, I'm not feeling all that well myself.<eos> Sorry. Of course, if-if you're not well...<eos> I'll take an early pass this evening and one later, but for most of the evening...<eos> You should stay home with your mother.<eos> - Well, say it.<eos> - I'm not gonna say it.<eos> - You lied to Giles.<eos> - Cos she will.
Moe?<eos> I'm coming. I'm coming.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> Abject prayer and supplication would spring to mind.<eos> I saw her walking past this park with her grocery bags.<eos> She lives in this neighborhood.<eos> I'm gonna start banging on doors.<eos> Wait. No. We do not have time for that.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> We will.
It's the only way.<eos> - I don't want...<eos> - She's the one!<eos> - But...<eos> - You saw what she did.<eos> How strong she is.<eos> - I know, but...<eos> - She's the last.<eos> Just this one more and I'll be free.<eos> - I won't.
Happiness is a full nursing staff.<eos> - I hope everyone is feeling healthy.<eos> - Peachy!<eos> I'd hate to see us get hit by the one-day flu again.<eos> It's run its course.<eos> I hope so.<eos> I can't afford to get fired.<eos> That was just management rattling its tired old saber.<eos> - What if they replace us?<eos> - They won't.
- Where am I gonna go?<eos> 7-Eleven?<eos> And no talking either!<eos> Over here!<eos> Please!<eos> Please!<eos> Please, someone!<eos> Please!<eos> - Duncan, don't go anywhere!<eos> - I won't!
We've lost about half.<eos> Therefore my time is reduced by half.<eos> I'm sorry Kai, I'm sorry.<eos> We've lost half your blood, and we've learned nothing.<eos> I have lost half of my blood, I have lost half of my time, but we have learned much.<eos> First, that the prophecy may not be certain, and second, that the gigashadow is something we should fear.<eos> This is Stanley Tweedle, the captain of the Lexx, the most powerful destructive force in the two universes.<eos> If anybody can hear me, and would like to make contact please transmit now, we are monitoring all frequencies<eos> How does it taste?<eos> Meaty - but not as meaty as you will, Stanley.
You're supposed to be brilliant, a wunderkind.<eos> Whatever happened to you?<eos> I went mad.<eos> Well, I never would have guessed.<eos> Are all those your children?<eos> They are now.<eos> And you're gonna help me get more.<eos> Specifically, all the sons and daughters of Dynacord's board of directors.<eos> What?<eos> I will not!
And working late shift, you get to know all the nut balls.<eos> Suppression. 11:18.<eos> Just before Knox picks him up in his cab.<eos> So, I tell him the Seattle Tribune doesn't want his crazy-assed story.<eos> Watch this part.<eos> Guy goes bananas.<eos> Lot of personnel for one lunatic.<eos> What, he kill some rich guy?<eos> If he shows up again...<eos> He won't.
Sentence: 20 years.<eos> Up for parole in three.<eos> The Jew shot Omar Selim because he figured Selim was gonna rip off his little store.<eos> - And the Jew got off.<eos> - Oh, you know it.<eos> So we had to teach the Jew a little lesson on respect.<eos> Thank you, Brother Huseni.<eos> But now we pray.<eos> Imam Said, listen, I think we gotta do a little more than pray.<eos> We will, brother.
[Chuckles] You've led quite a life, Tamzarian.<eos> It's your life.<eos> I just kept it warm for you.<eos> Oh, I nearly forgot.<eos> Your pocket watch.<eos> Mother's picture is still inside. Take good care of her.<eos> I'll wind her every day.<eos> I poached some fish for your trip, Mr. Tamzarian.<eos> They're full of tiny bones, so I want you to be careful.<eos> I will, Moth- uh, Mrs. Skinner. [Sighs]
I'm only beginning to understand it all, myself.<eos> I still have so many questions. Now that she's here, I have a chance to find some answers.<eos> Odo, this isn't the time to go off on some kind of personal quest.<eos> There's too much at stake.<eos> After the war is over, do whatever you need to do.<eos> If you feel you need to go and join the Great Link I'm... I'm not going to stop you.<eos> But for right now I need you here-- focused.<eos> Please promise me that you're not going to link with her again.<eos> Not until this is over.<eos> All right. I won't.
I see I was wrong.<eos> One man's villain is another man's hero, Captain.<eos> You should see the monument they're erecting in my honor at the gateway to the Imperial Plaza.<eos> Is that why you sold out your people to the Dominion?<eos> For a monument? !<eos> What I did... I did to make Cardassia strong again.<eos> And mark my words, Captain, I succeeded.<eos> You may have escaped defeat this day but tomorrow...<eos> We will see about tomorrow.<eos> Yes, we will.
I don't like you.<eos> Major, that's just not true.<eos> There's a bond between us.<eos> No. Only in your mind.<eos> You are an opportunistic power-hungry dictator and I want nothing more to do with you.<eos> Ziyal would be very disappointed to hear you say that.<eos> She'll get over it.<eos> Please, Nerys, let's sit down.<eos> We'll talk about it.<eos> No. We won't.
Iliana... I... I...<eos> Don't listen to him.<eos> Your daughter is alive, Ghemor.<eos> I know where to find her.<eos> I want to believe you, Dukat, but... even if I did let's just say, I don't like the company you're keeping.<eos> You and I might have come to an agreement one Cardassian to another, but now, dealing with you means dealing with them and that makes the price too high.<eos> All right, you have your answer.<eos> My ship will be docked here a few days longer...<eos> In case you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
But I wonder what Baal would think if he were to receive intelligence that the weapon was... temporarily out of commission.<eos> He would come to this world to claim it for himself.<eos> - The Tauri would have to destroy him.<eos> - And we would have to give them nothing.<eos> Oh, come on. Baal would never fall for that.<eos> He knows how desperate you are.<eos> He might find this information a bit convenient.<eos> Perhaps, but you leave us few options.<eos> OK. We'll do it.<eos> We will?
- But what if he's telling the truth?<eos> A phantom POW left for dead comes back to avenge the injustices?<eos> - Maybe the war ain't over.<eos> - Maybe not Denny Markham's war.<eos> Given the facts of the case and the polygraph test,... ..it's the only explanation we've got.<eos> Or it's a clever story being proffered as a cover-up... ..for an elaborately orchestrated conspiracy.<eos> There is that possibility too.<eos> Let Markham take the polygraph.<eos> - And what if he passes?<eos> - He won't.
Oh, I won't hurt him.<eos> Look, I swear it!<eos> Even my enemies know me as a man of my word.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I tell you and Joxer's as good as...<eos> That pip-squeak?<eos> I will kill him!<eos> No!<eos> You gave your word that you wouldn't hurt him.<eos> Oh, I won't.
Thanks.<eos> I'll see you to the door, doctor.<eos> I wait for your good news.<eos> Get water for his medicine.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> We may be infected.<eos> You want us to get ill like him?<eos> Get him water for his medicine.<eos> No.<eos> - Then I will.
Ebola?<eos> What can I do for you, sir?<eos> What would you do for me?<eos> I only trust myself.<eos> This is my passport.<eos> I've just arrived from South Africa.<eos> I made reservations for the penthouse.<eos> Come in, Mr. Wong.<eos> If you wish you can call room service.<eos> I will.
I was not three steps outside and he said...<eos> Miss Smith!<eos> You better go by Mr. Cole's stable.<eos> The near way is flooded. Thank you.<eos> [Sighs] Miss Woodhouse, do talk and make me comfortable again.<eos> [Thinking] I suppose this would not be the right time... to mention that Mr. Elton is engaged.<eos> This was awkward because it was the first time... - you've seen Mr. Martin since refusing his proposal. - No.<eos> You, and I must say he, behaved very well!<eos> Now, the kindest thing you can do for yourself... is to put Mr. Martin out of your head for good.<eos> Yes, I will.
Surprise...<eos> Birthday.<eos> My birthday's not till the 14th.<eos> 14th?<eos> Dad will fetch me on the 14th.<eos> Will you come too?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> It's for you.<eos> He won't come.<eos> He won't, will he?
-No soldiers! Sanctuary!<eos> Get out!<eos> -Wait!<eos> All I want is to...<eos> -Go! I mean her no harm.<eos> Go!<eos> You tell her for me, I didn't mean to trap her here.<eos> But it was the only way I could save her life.<eos> Will you tell her that?<eos> Will you?
You were so good to my brother.<eos> He loved you so much.<eos> I'm sorry, Claire.<eos> I'm so stupid sometimes.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I wish I could help you, honey.<eos> There's just so much happening.<eos> - I'II see you.<eos> - Tell Mom thanks for the soup.<eos> I will.
How have you been feeling?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> You listen in.<eos> - I don't enjoy it.<eos> - You don't?<eos> - No.<eos> But we can't afford the slightest error.<eos> I think you're being a little harsh with your child.<eos> - He may start to ask questions.<eos> - He won't.
You know all right.<eos> At my place.<eos> Go, I'll call her.<eos> She won't forgive you.<eos> You could have come home.<eos> With a face like minced meat, it would have scared you.<eos> And I wasn't scared now?<eos> I was thoughtless.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I won't.
- Hey, don't worry. He's an old man. The boss is watchin' 'im.<eos> Have- - Try some of this lobster. -Mm-hmm.<eos> -My secretary here will settle the bill. So what do you have in store for me, Womack, when this is over?<eos> You'll get your life back, Mason.<eos> But you could've given me my life back years ago.<eos> - Why should I trust you now?<eos> Will you shake on it?<eos> - Freeze, mister! - Oh, man!<eos> Drop the gun, or I drop your boss.<eos> You will not!
As you know I can.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> Old soldiers never lean, do they?<eos> Only one trade thee's good for. Old snoddy like thee.<eos> You think I'm an eejit cos I'm Irish.<eos> I do not.<eos> Bless my soul, I do not, Paddy.<eos> Take it.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
i'm sure that she really appreciated that.<eos> yeah, but i didn't look at it because it's not my affairs.<eos> right. i guess you're right.<eos> people's mail is their business.<eos> i don't look at other people's affairs because it's not my business.<eos> well, like it's not my business to tell you who to like and stuff.<eos> right.<eos> well, i'm going to go inside now and take care of my business.<eos> o.k., but if you ever... want to know what i think about that, uh... bad guy... with the fast car, you just ask me, o.k.?<eos> i will.
He took it with him.<eos> That animal was mine, you idiot.<eos> You disobeyed a direct order and now you are going to pay the price.<eos> I'm sending you to the Russian front.<eos> Please, Field Marshal.<eos> I'm sending anybody who works here. You people think you can get away with anything because you know I'm lenient.<eos> Do you think I've noticed it?<eos> Discipline has collapsed here!<eos> I won't stand it!<eos> I won't!
Now...<eos> I think the only way these girls are gonna get along... show us some respect and bring harmony to this household... is for you and I to stop interfering.<eos> There'll be no reason for them to rebel against our rules and demands... because... there won't be any.<eos> - Morning, Hayley.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Oh, excellent shirt, Aly.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's three days in a row, Hayley.<eos> If it happens again, I'm going to start deducting from your grade.<eos> It won't.
Not forgetting three shillings and fourpence, carriage.<eos> You think yourself insulted.<eos> -Try to understand.<eos> -Oh, I understand.<eos> You think that if you accept this trifle of me, I shall presume on it hereafter.<eos> I assure you that is not the case.<eos> Well...<eos> I shall take you at your word.<eos> But remember.<eos> I will.
Were we?<eos> Okay, we were. It's just I was there and she was there and it came up.<eos> Oh, that's great. Let's just say we're even.<eos> Want to play a little one-on-one?<eos> re.<eos> You spying on your sister?<eos> I'm just looking out for her.<eos> And this is our room.<eos> So don't worry if Mom and Dad won't let you sleep in here at first.<eos> They will.
But I don't know how to stop being afraid.<eos> Mom was afraid?<eos> I thought Mom and Dad never get scared.<eos> Well, I guess you're wrong, 'cause she was.<eos> Why did she say she wasn't scared? I don't know.<eos> Maybe she thought the truth would scare you, and she didn't want to do that.<eos> I could have handled it.<eos> Yeah, well, Mom didn't know that.<eos> Will you tell her for me?<eos> No, you will.
- Get him. Now.<eos> She just started bleeding.<eos> What were you doing at the time?<eos> Never mind.<eos> What's your relationship to Miss Emory?<eos> - Buck. - That's none of your business.<eos> - We always gonna do this?<eos> - Do what? - Jerk around like this.<eos> - You just make damn sure she gets better.<eos> - Or you'll what?
Anyway, I got a message for you.<eos> So this wasn't just a chance meeting?<eos> I'm taking a chance, all right.<eos> Look out for Sheriff Buck.<eos> - Come on...<eos> - No, really.<eos> Have you ever looked into the face of evil?<eos> I mean... the pure, unadulterated thing.<eos> I would probably be too busy to even notice it.<eos> You will.
We've all had our share of pain, Artie.<eos> Artie, I'm coming in.<eos> What about Caleb and Gail?<eos> I'll take care of them. You just listen to Doc Crower and he'll talk you through it.<eos> What if I do get the thing out of him?<eos> What do I do with it then?<eos> Open a window, pretend it's a football.<eos> - Lucas. - What?<eos> I don't want to lose him.<eos> You won't.
You son of a bitch!<eos> Yes or no?<eos> - Yes or no, Lucas? - You really want to know?<eos> Yes! I know what you are.<eos> In my soul, I know what you are.<eos> And would you change me if you could?<eos> No.<eos> Get off!<eos> So tell me the truth. For once.<eos> Okay, I will.
But how?<eos> You know every ship going to Narn is searched.<eos> Vir, we're talking about G'Kar here.<eos> He is annoying but extremely capable.<eos> He will find a way.<eos> And when he arrives, he will attempt to free her and my forces will be there to arrest him.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It won't work, Londo.<eos> He'll never believe me.<eos> Yes, he will.
After the Narns were defeated, I took steps to put some distance between us.<eos> Refa, I have the feeling that he and his associates are carving a great, dark hole in the middle of the universe.<eos> And when they go down, anyone nearby will go with them.<eos> That will not happen.<eos> You don't appreciate their strength.<eos> I appreciate their strength, all right.<eos> And that is why this unfocused aggression worries me.<eos> By drawing our forces into a dozen smaller wars you have effectively weakened our main line of defense should they turn an eye to Centauri Prime.<eos> - They will not do that.<eos> - No, they will not.
The resolution was passed quietly.<eos> Fourteen opposed it.<eos> - No one's seen them since.<eos> - He's mad.<eos> If there's a madman on the throne, it's because you and Refa put him there.<eos> He's your responsibility, and you... You are mine.<eos> Based on our warm relations of the past my associates asked for you as our liaison to the royal court.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I won't do it.<eos> Of course you will, Mollari.
-Sure.<eos> -No.<eos> Ex...cuse me.<eos> -No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> Really. I'm sorry.<eos> Get out of my home!<eos> How dare you defy Hera?<eos> I owe her nothing!<eos> All my other children died for her!<eos> This one will not!
Typhon, we need to get some answers here, first.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> You can be sorry all you want. I'm still gonna see how far I can throw you!<eos> Save me!<eos> -Typhon!<eos> Don't!<eos> -But I...<eos> Hurting Klepto won't save your baby.<eos> You're right, Hercules.<eos> But what will?
There never was a greater archer.<eos> You're the reason he's dead!<eos> You led us into this trap!<eos> Now's not the time for pointing fingers, Artemus.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe I should just kill this old drunk!<eos> You don't wanna do anything to Jason, do you?<eos> You're not gonna be around to protect him forever, Hercules.<eos> This is crazy..., fighting among ourselves!<eos> -He's gonna get us all killed!<eos> -No, he won't.
- And what do you want?<eos> - You didn't tell me about the cups.<eos> - What cups?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - Is this who Clark married?<eos> - They moved the cups.<eos> - What have you done?<eos> - And for this you deserted your post?<eos> - I might make other mistakes.<eos> - But you won't.
Scimitar's going commercial.<eos> By the year 2000, that Scimitar chip's gonna be on every airliner in the country.<eos> I feel safer already.<eos> Well, I just want you to know I've been talking to corporate types about you.<eos> You're our best flier, hands down.<eos> - But?<eos> - But I gotta give the test to Dixon on Friday.<eos> I understand.<eos> You don't want a repeat of the last test.<eos> We won't.
The question is, are you smart enough to grab it?<eos> - Why do you need a third guy?<eos> - 'Cause we had problems the last time out.<eos> We need a third guy to plug up the leaks.<eos> - How does it work?<eos> - We use the security codes supplied by the stores.<eos> - Low risk, high reward.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - What if something goes wrong?<eos> - It won't.
Look who's eating at 6:00.<eos> Your suddenly well-to-do president.<eos> Stop it, Jack.<eos> You enjoy your last meal in office.<eos> Tomorrow, when they kick you out you'll have plenty of time to drive around in your Cadillac.<eos> They're not kicking me out.<eos> You don't have the votes.<eos> That's what you think.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yes, we will.
It happens.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But why in front of him, huh?<eos> He's giving you a second chance.<eos> I don't know if I can take it.<eos> My head is...<eos> My head is pounding!<eos> I mean, I have such a headache.<eos> We'll help you.<eos> We will?
(Mary) How is it the Duke lives?<eos> (assassin) I don't know.<eos> I saw him disappear into the ocean.<eos> He never surfaced.<eos> Obviously, he did.<eos> I trusted you, and you failed me.<eos> My nephew and I have too much invested in this to allow these kinds of mistakes.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> That's right.<eos> It won't.
The way everyone looks at me... I can't stand it.<eos> After the court-martial's over, I'm definitely signing up for the next mining expedition to the Gamma Quadrant.<eos> Maybe there won't be a court-martial.<eos> You're right.<eos> None of us may get out of here alive.<eos> No, I mean Starfleet could decide to send you to counseling instead.<eos> I won't go.<eos> I don't deserve to be in Starfleet.<eos> Therapy won't change what I did.<eos> Nothing will.
Increase speed to warp nine.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> It was delicious.<eos> What do you call it?<eos> Chicken à la Sisko.<eos> How did you learn to cook like this?<eos> Well, uh, all Sisko men have the cooking gene.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah, you should try my father's shrimp creole.<eos> Maybe one day, I will.
Well, I can start to restore power to the systems one at a time.<eos> That'll give us a chance to test them and establish their functions but it's going to take awhile.<eos> How long?<eos> I wish I knew.<eos> Well, you can do it, Chief.<eos> I don't think a ship's been invented that you can't figure out.<eos> Muniz is strong.<eos> He'll make it.<eos> No.<eos> He will not.
No, it's perfect.<eos> You sure you're all right?<eos> I'm not sure about anything anymore.<eos> You seem sort of, I don't know funny.<eos> Look who's talking the guy who still wears his Virillus token.<eos> Hey, come on.<eos> Lots of guys still wear their tokens.<eos> Besides, it's good luck it saved my life, remember?<eos> How could I forget?<eos> Yeah, well I never will.
I thought we were passed that.<eos> Well, we're not.<eos> Oh, and don't try to contact Diana.<eos> You'll only put her in danger.<eos> She'll stay quiet.<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, Aggie.<eos> My name's Agis.<eos> Well, what do we do when the real Xena gets here?<eos> She won't.
Get bent, ma'am.<eos> Why do you have to be a pain?<eos> Don't you realize you're getting a bad reputation?<eos> Don't you realize your butt sticks out?<eos> It does not.<eos> Hey.<eos> An automatic dialer?<eos> Is that legal?<eos> - I don't want you getting arrested.<eos> - I won't.
It's time.<eos> Even when it's warm here, it's cold.<eos> It won't be like that in Arizona.<eos> There is no Arizona.<eos> I don't have to go.<eos> It was a lie.<eos> My editor the story, the book it's all over.<eos> Do I still have to worry about you?<eos> I don't know how to feel about what you did.<eos> Maybe I never will.
Let's not start on that again, OK?<eos> You turn around?<eos> She didn't have a choice.<eos> Let's put the knives in your father's back where they belong.<eos> Yeah, that might be more appropriate.<eos> I can't help wishing you had inherited... a little bit of his promiscuity.<eos> But look where it got him.<eos> I wish I'd seen him at least once before he died.<eos> He was alone, and I don't want that to happen to me.<eos> It won't.
Child?<eos> I didn't see no child.<eos> The one you're carrying.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I might be crazy, but you know it is possible.<eos> But that can't be.<eos> I mean, I can't.<eos> I can't have a child.<eos> You will, in the spring.
It was spoiled.<eos> Try your beer. See how that is. I don't want it anymore.<eos> Give it to me. I've drunk 'em warm before.<eos> Don't cross my eyes none. Mmm. Mmm!<eos> Damn.<eos> Flat.<eos> Flat. That's something we can see. Can you get some more beers and soft drinks from the cold case there?<eos> You can't dillydally any longer, craigy-waigy. You have to get to Boston, and you have to do it... Now!<eos> I don't want to shoot you, but I will if I have to. I don't want to shoot you, but I will if I have to.<eos> Yes, I will.
And we need them now.<eos> With such a force arrayed against us, it's time to discuss other options.<eos> Other options?<eos> Don't you wish at least to lead your men onto the field and barter a better deal with Longshanks<eos> - before you run?<eos> - Sir William...<eos> - We cannot defeat them.<eos> - We can.<eos> - Sir William.<eos> - And we will.
You and you alone can rule Scotland.<eos> What I tell you, you must do.<eos> Not for me, not for yourself, but for your country.<eos> Right, lads, make way.<eos> Coming through.<eos> Make way, lads.<eos> - The Bruce is not coming, William.<eos> - He'll come.<eos> Mornay and Lochlan have come.<eos> So will the Bruce.
Right there, now.<eos> This fool calling me out, he ain't even got no gun.<eos> I'll kill that motherfucker.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Let him live.<eos> And he'll be scared of you from now on.<eos> He better be scared or I'll kill him.<eos> He will.<eos> You better tell him.<eos> I will.
It's just beer.<eos> It's over there.<eos> - I told you. The store is shut.<eos> Get out.<eos> Got the beer?<eos> - Didn't find any.<eos> Can't even do such a simple job?<eos> - That was an angry man.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> - You won't.
You look so handsome, is not handsome, George?<eos> Almost as much as his father.<eos> And that's pretty cute.<eos> I better go prepare the roast.<eos> Are you nervous, son?<eos> - A little, I think... What if I do not get along?<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> The first time you saw your mother...<eos> I did not sleep last night worrying about whether... Computers were wrong. But the bride chose absolutely 100% perfect for me.<eos> And they will for you too.
- We still on?<eos> - He wants it.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> - So your ship came in again, Jimbo?<eos> Africa, land of great beauty and untold riches.<eos> - Absolutely untold.<eos> - Keep it that way.<eos> Take care.<eos> - Tell them to send an alert.<eos> - No, I won't.
Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Mary, are you hurt? Did they wound you?<eos> Mary.<eos> What have they done?<eos> We will avenge you. Rob will kill every last one of them.<eos> He will not know. Rob will not know.<eos> Mary, Rob must know.<eos> He will not! He will not know!<eos> He will not!
Could the freak be more vague?<eos> As far as master plans go...<eos> I really can't wait for you to see.<eos> It's going to be something.<eos> Know what?<eos> I'll be standing next to you.<eos> So when this thing happens, be sure and let me know.<eos> Don't want to miss it.<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> You won't.
- They got him.<eos> All set?<eos> For you to do, sir.<eos> Richard... it was here Ma was killed.<eos> Rifles... search!<eos> - Ellie?<eos> - Dada.<eos> Oh, Dada! Dada?<eos> But he knew me then. He did.<eos> - He will again.
My wife's family, the Aztecs, have a belief that you have to have the permission of the four winds to harvest what the earth gives.<eos> Isn't she beautiful?<eos> Victoria! Come on!<eos> You're a married woman now.<eos> What about Pedro? He's not married.<eos> Neither are we.<eos> I want you more than anything, Victoria.<eos> You can't imagine how I want you. But I'm not free.<eos> And I won't hurt you that way.<eos> I won't.
- We need that similarity to crack this thing.<eos> - Don't you understand what this means?<eos> It means we have more information than we had five minutes ago.<eos> To beat this, we need all the information we can get.<eos> I want a biogenic comparison of these two groups in an hour or you'll have something worse than the plague to worry about.<eos> Now move!<eos> I want answers!<eos> Has he found Mama yet?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> But he will.
- Don't do this.<eos> - No, don't you do this!<eos> Don't tell me it's not what I think when you're standing there lying!<eos> Yes, I'm lying.<eos> Maybe I wasn't ready for us moving in together. - You could've just said that.<eos> - I'm scared.<eos> I was stupid and I'm sorry.<eos> - Give me another chance. - No.<eos> - It won't happen again.<eos> - Yes, it will. Diane!
- Don't do this.<eos> - No, don't you do this!<eos> Don't tell me it's not what I think when you're standing there lying!<eos> Yes, I'm lying.<eos> Maybe I wasn't ready for us moving in together. - You could've just said that.<eos> - I'm scared.<eos> I was stupid and I'm sorry.<eos> - Give me another chance. - No.<eos> - It won't happen again.<eos> - Yes, it will. Diane!
Birds just don't say...<eos> ... " Hello,sithere.<eos> Eat something."<eos> You pick one.<eos> How about the ladybugs?<eos> So forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining?<eos> Fine!<eos> Do you want the birds?<eos> Get the birds!<eos> Not like that, I won't.
You can ask your friend Salmoneus that if he lives through the experience.<eos> But there's an explanation for his involvement.<eos> -I'll... be the judge of that.<eos> -Wait a minute! You can't save him this time, Hercules.<eos> Salmoneus must pay for his greed.<eos> That was by accident, right?<eos> Guess not.<eos> Can't you see I'm in a hurry?<eos> Have to do a lot better than that.<eos> Oh, I will, Hercules. I will.
Ah, this land is filled with Scottish graves. Aye.<eos> And they're be English ones by the time I'm through.<eos> Has there not been enough bloodshed?<eos> Enough?<eos> They slaughtered 4,000 Scots.<eos> Men, women, children in their mother's arms.<eos> I do not ask you to understand.<eos> Aye, but I do, only too well.<eos> More blood does not make it better.<eos> It never will.
I'm just trying to figure this out like you are.<eos> So we'll help each other.<eos> - I don't always respond appropriately.<eos> - Neither do I.<eos> And I don't always know how to express how I feel.<eos> And I get tongue-tied sometimes.<eos> But I do know you broke my heart.<eos> And you just have to let me work that out.<eos> You can't expect me to just snap out of it.<eos> I will.
We gotta do something about this.<eos> Keep those hands high and give me the gold.<eos> I think I know where they are.<eos> Bye.<eos> Brother, you're right.<eos> It's time to get back in the saddle.<eos> Folks, this here is a holdup.<eos> - Lois, what are you...?<eos> Go back inside.<eos> - I will not.
- I'll see you later, champ.<eos> - Bye, Grandpa. How about this for a name?<eos> - Cowboy. - Cowboy?<eos> Cool.<eos> Cowboy!<eos> Hey, thanks for that good dinner, Cathy.<eos> - It's my pleasure.<eos> - You better take some time off from work.<eos> - You seem a little stressed.<eos> - Maybe I will.
Mike, I'm sorry.<eos> I never meant to hurt you, personally or professionally. And if I've done either of those things, then I apologize.<eos> I just couldn't help myself.<eos> Now, it's out of my system, okay?<eos> I've seen her. It's not Karen.<eos> I know this.<eos> I accept this. And I am ready to move on with my life.<eos> Good.<eos> Because, so help me, if you ever do anything like this again-<eos> I won't.

All right, what am I supposed to do here?<eos> Should I go over there?<eos> It's not like somebody died.<eos> It's Beaches, for God's sake.<eos> If she was sitting next to me, I'd put my arm around her.<eos> I can't see making a big move like going all the way over there.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
Tell her that it rained for two and a half days.<eos> I don't know if she can see the sky... where they're keeping her.<eos> And...there was more.<eos> There was something about a friend...<eos> Why can't I remember?<eos> I wanted to tell her!<eos> Is all right.<eos> She'll understand.<eos> Yes, yes, you're right.<eos> She will.
Under the circumstances, physical resistance is ineffective.<eos> We are...fighting back by refusing to give them any information.<eos> Get down there!<eos> Three more hours.<eos> There's nothing going on around here.<eos> Wake me if the Lieutenant shows up, will you?<eos> You girls aren't supposed to come down here anymore.<eos> Do you want me to leave?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Then I won't.
RCMP.<eos> [sighing] - This used to be a feeding ground forthousands of caribou.<eos> They lived off the land and so did we. Till the water came.<eos> They said it wouldn't change anything... but... now some nights... the rivers run backward.<eos> Land becomes an ocean... and the caribou die.<eos> And in the morning, the ocean is gone.<eos> All back here, neat and tidy.<eos> - Why haven't you told someone? - Told yourfather.<eos> He didn't do anything.<eos> Neither will you.
Still...<eos> It's a funny idea, isn't it?<eos> You, me, married. Living in that big house.<eos> Yeah, it's funny.<eos> Don't forget, you owe me a dollar for the shoes.<eos> Anyway, as I was saying, my lawyer says I can turn all my money, everything, over to one person, now.<eos> You understand?<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't wanna end up in a home.<eos> You won't.
I'm on it right away!<eos> That's what I wanted to hear.<eos> Thanks, buddy.<eos> Next time you're in town, come over to the White House for dinner.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'd be honoured.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have a nice day, pal.<eos> - Yes, sir. I will.
He was spotted in the lingerie department, eh, Wendy?<eos> There's nothing wrong with Sir Edmund Hillary buying underwear for his wife<eos> He was a very nice man<eos> I bet it was thermal underwear<eos> I bet I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom<eos> And they have to pretend to be on a mountain<eos> That's enough, Yvonne<eos> That man's a credit to the nation<eos> Right, who's going to help me clear away?<eos> I will, Mum
No harm done, and forget the doctor.<eos> He's just a little too liberal with his own medicine.<eos> You can always reach me here.<eos> I don't really want to go back.<eos> - Do we have the money we need?<eos> - I could ask Mom for the rest.<eos> - But you hate asking her for money.<eos> - I just want some peace.<eos> - I don't ever want to lose you.<eos> - You won't.
Thanks, Daniel.<eos> You sure you wanna do this?<eos> Yes. I'm sure.<eos> You gonna be all right?<eos> I'm gonna be all right.<eos> How about you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> Tell Catherine this brought me luck.<eos> I will.
I don't stand a chance!<eos> I was only joking.<eos> Wing Chun is a woman.<eos> Wing Chun has become a woman?<eos> She must have lost her virginity.<eos> She's here, I'll hide.<eos> Hey!<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> I'll tell Wing Chun that you're having an affair with a man.<eos> No, you won't.
- You spoke to Senator Gant?<eos> - For an advisory.<eos> - I won't call Central for everything.<eos> - And?<eos> He declined even to advise.<eos> Said it's my responsibility.<eos> But it isn't your fault.<eos> This is a tough situation for everyone.<eos> - That doesn't make me feel better.<eos> - Nothing will.
- That was the camel's nose in the tent.<eos> Operating on Shon will be the rest of the camel.<eos> I have to stop it somewhere.<eos> Otherwise our charter will be compromised.<eos> The station's role as a meeting place for different races will be destroyed.<eos> - You're just gonna let him die.<eos> - Do you think I want to do this?<eos> I have no more choice than anyone.<eos> I have to be the advocate for the parents.<eos> No one else will.
Perhaps if you came back.<eos> I believe the ambassador can see you now.<eos> What a joy to see you. What can I do for you?<eos> You can give the Centauri some room to maneuver.<eos> That again?<eos> As far as I'm concerned this is a dead issue.<eos> We have to push forward.<eos> You told me that before the Centauri came, Narn was an agrarian world a peaceful world. To be free, you had to fight. That's true, but you've overcompensated.<eos> Like abused children who abuse others as if that'll balance the scales.<eos> It won't.
Cutter was there when the evidenceagainst me was found.<eos> Cutter's one of our best agents.<eos> Maybe Home Guard wascounting on that.<eos> Look....<eos> You should scan those bays yourself.<eos> You're head of presidential security. You should make a personal inspection.<eos> Presidential shuttle launched.<eos> Now onapproach to docking bay one, vector 694.<eos> With great pleasure, I presentthis new fighter wing to Babylon 5.<eos> The station 's own fighters will now...
You've broken the law son, that carries a heavy penalty.<eos> Perhaps you didn't think it through.<eos> Man, back off, okay, just back off.<eos> Well, I'm afraid I can't do that.<eos> Now if you'll hand me that purse.<eos> Said back off!<eos> Diefenbaker.<eos> No.<eos> You better keep that dog off of me or I'll pop him too.<eos> No you won't.
That was...<eos> That was...<eos> Perfection?<eos> What'd he say that was so funny?<eos> I have absolutely no idea.<eos> That's classic. My God, you guys!<eos> What am I doing? This is so un-me!<eos> If you want, I'll do it.<eos> I just wanna bite his bottom lip.<eos> But I won't.
What happened, big guy?<eos> Big guy?<eos> It felt like a "big guy" moment.<eos> I got fired!<eos> They said I acted too much with it.<eos> I told everybody about this!<eos> -Everybody's expecting to see me.<eos> -lKnow what?<eos> -No one will be able to tell.<eos> -My mom will.
There's nothing too brave about that.<eos> Well, sure, you're not flying around with a big red S on your chest bragging about what a hero you are.<eos> You heard Superman brag?<eos> Well, no.<eos> Not in so many words.<eos> Look, I know that he's a friend of yours and no one can deny that he's done a lot of really good things but you're 10 times the man he is. I mean, you're an ordinary guy.<eos> You're getting ready to stand up to this huge criminal organization.<eos> Takes guts.<eos> I'd like to see Superman try that without his cape on.<eos> Well, maybe you will.
But I know it was, it was a little thing put me on to em.<eos> I came into the parlor unexpected one day and as I came in I saw the light of welcome in me wife's eyes but when she saw it was me she turned away with a look of disappointment.<eos> There was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose steps you can mistake from mine.<eos> I tell you from that moment on my peace was gone.<eos> Sarah was in the kitchen and I went straight through, and I told her that if Fairbairn ever set foot in my place again I'd send her his ears for a keepsake.<eos> I believe I could wish you had committed this deed of yours in France.<eos> They acknowledge the crime of passion there.<eos> You won't let them leave me alone, will you, sir?<eos> No,<eos> I won't.
I mean, she could be cutting class, doing drugs.<eos> Having sex. Like we did.<eos> I never cut class, and you never had sex in high school.<eos> You know, I know why she did it.<eos> She did it to get me to react.<eos> Maybe she just did it to do it.<eos> - No, she did it to get a reaction.<eos> - Well then don't react!<eos> I'm not.<eos> I won't.
Consider the cloaking device a gift.<eos> Ferengis aren't known for their generosity.<eos> We are a deeply misunderstood race.<eos> You've saved our lives.<eos> Our movement owes you.<eos> I know how you can repay me.<eos> Convince Natima to stay here.<eos> - She will never agree to stay behind.<eos> - No Natima, no cloaking device, and no way off this station.<eos> - She won't.
Then we can be together.<eos> I can't just abandon them.<eos> They need me.<eos> I need you.<eos> Listen to me, Natima.<eos> You've done enough for the movement.<eos> You lit the match.<eos> Let them carry the torch.<eos> - Won't the movement survive?<eos> - lt will.
Maybe one day I'll come back and we'll be together, but not until my work is done.<eos> So I just have to wait until Cardassia becomes free and democratic?<eos> I promise... I'll make it worth the wait.<eos> I can't come with you?<eos> No. lt's not your fight.<eos> And I couldn't bear it if something happened to you.<eos> I need to know that you're here, safe.<eos> That way a part of me will always be safe too.<eos> I love you, Quark.<eos> I always will.
Miserable.<eos> I wish you could stay here longer.<eos> All right, I will.<eos> I'll stay a few more days.<eos> - You can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because in two days you are going to be elected Kai.<eos> Oh, that!<eos> There's no guarantee I'll win.<eos> Of course you will.
You can't get those back on Vulcan.<eos> - Do you eat like this every night?<eos> - This is a special occasion.<eos> The commencement of a new business relationship is the most special occasion for any Ferengi.<eos> It's a cause for opening great wine, dancing into the wee, small hours.<eos> We'll let it breathe.<eos> I will attempt to respect some of your cultural idiosyncrasies.<eos> I will drink the wine, but I won't dance.<eos> You'll change your mind after you drink the wine.<eos> - No, I won't.
They feed into the Sherman crater.<eos> - That's how we accessed the caldera.<eos> How'd you get these? - Firewalker.<eos> They were transmitted right before Trepkos destroyed his camera. Oh.<eos> So you're finally gonna go after Trepkos.<eos> Well, I'll tell you one thing:<eos> You won't find him with those.<eos> - You won't find him with any map either.<eos> - Well, how will I find him?<eos> You won't... not without a guide.
I don't know how you two can sit here laughing at poor Lisa while she's probably scared to death. We're laughing with her, Marge. There's a big difference.<eos> With her.<eos> You really think I did okay out there, Mom? Absolutely, honey.<eos> By blocking the net, I really think you helped your team.<eos> Okay, little buddy. Hop in. I mean my little girl buddy.<eos> We're having our best season ever.<eos> And I would like to say that it is because of teamwork.<eos> Gee, who am I kidding, huh? It's all because of Lisa. Let's hear it for Lisa!<eos> Hey, Bart. If Lisa's better than you at hockey does that mean you're gonna become better than her at school?<eos> Maybe I will, Milhouse.
I can't keep that promise.<eos> What about May?<eos> What about how May feels?<eos> If you're using my marriage as some victory of ours, then there's no reason on earth why you shouldn't go back.<eos> You gave me my first glimpse of a real life and then you told me to carry on with a false one.<eos> No one can endure that.<eos> I'm enduring it.<eos> - What's the use?<eos> I know you'll go back.<eos> - I won't.
At the hideaway, in your bed!<eos> Shame on you two!<eos> - And what will you do now?<eos> - About what?<eos> Nancy.<eos> I like her a lot.<eos> Nancy is a little sparrow.<eos> She seems strong and bright.<eos> But she's a sparrow... that anybody can hurt.<eos> Nobody will.
What did happen on the ice?<eos> I told you, Mom. It was an accident.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I know I've always treated her like a bratty kid sister but until yesterday I never realised how much she meant to me.<eos> I know.<eos> I'd better go home now.<eos> Never mind.<eos> I'll see you at home.<eos> - Tell Connie I was here.<eos> - I will.
- Why? What's wrong?<eos> It's Henry. He's been doing things.<eos> Terrible things.<eos> - What do you mean, terrible things?<eos> - He's got everyone fooled. Everyone thinks he's this great kid but he's really evil.<eos> He killed this dog with this thing that he made that fires steel bolts.<eos> Then yesterday... he tried to kill Connie.<eos> Mark, is Wallace there? Or Susan?<eos> I tried to tell them, but they won't believe me.<eos> Nobody will.
Who needs you more today than me?<eos> There cant be anyone.<eos> Im desperate.<eos> You want to do this, I know you do.<eos> There!<eos> There it is!<eos> You see it?<eos> The road to forgiveness.<eos> Ill talk about me.<eos> I will.
What happened to my face?<eos> Where did I get these? - So you're a glorified waterboy.<eos> - Oh, you just don't get it.<eos> If you are on that team, my opinion of Notre Dame just hit the shits.<eos> Leave him alone. There's no "if."<eos> I wear a uniform, I block and tackle.<eos> You just don't understand. Actually, it's simple.<eos> Every Saturday when we turn on the TV to watch we see players wearing the blue and gold.<eos> We just don't see you.<eos> You will.
You wouldn't dare!<eos> Wouldn't I?<eos> -I'll have them drag you back in.<eos> -Will you, Mr. Rajah?<eos> That's just fine.<eos> Then I won't even look at you.<eos> I'll stare at the floor.<eos> I'll clench my teeth together and never tell you one thing.<eos> Not even about seeing your father.<eos> Yes, you will.
The little thing didn't come up.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Why'd you let me sleep?<eos> How am I gonna explain this?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> What, is it broken?<eos> - Yeah. Is your kid awake?<eos> I don't want him to see me here.<eos> Is he?<eos> He won't, baby.
Don't make me come down there after you.<eos> - Listen.<eos> Y'all call me tonight so we can figure out a plan.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Rita!<eos> - See ya.<eos> On second thought. Call me in the mornin'.<eos> Peace.<eos> Y'all. - All right.<eos> - We'll.
Now. Come on. If they're gonna close this school.<eos> Let's go out with a bang.<eos> Yes.<eos> Let her.<eos> Very awesome.<eos> Well...<eos> Very well.<eos> Then.<eos> You seem to have the support of everyone.<eos> So I'll...
Money!<eos> Who said when artists dream they dream of money?<eos> God, I must be such an artist.<eos> Bravo!<eos> Bravo!<eos> Bravo.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I don't want to lose our life here.<eos> I don't want all the debt to pile up and crush us.<eos> It won't.
Let me get this straight.<eos> He wanted to but you didn't know, so he didn't ask and you didn't say.<eos> So he didn't and you weren't.<eos> But he's not here and I am, and I want to.<eos> So I'm going to go ask.<eos> - Where're you going? - To ask Orin if I can kiss my wife.<eos> Stop it!<eos> You got a very beautiful smile there, Mrs. Sommersby.<eos> Hope to see a whole lot more of it.<eos> Well, you will.
God!<eos> You didn't like it?<eos> What's your family like?<eos> Sadie's a pit boss in vegas. She's on her fourth marriage.<eos> Fourth?<eos> My god.<eos> To frank.<eos> Frank sells plastic catheters, bedpans,<eos> You'll probably see some of his work wash up here onshore from time to time.<eos> Really, you will.
It explains...<eos> It would explain...<eos> I think the two of them are trying to get my money.<eos> - And go to New Zealand. - What?<eos> What?<eos> He bought a house in New Zealand without my knowledge.<eos> It was a down payment we couldn't afford.<eos> And when I found out about it he told me it was some kind of an investment.<eos> - Don't ever tell him you know.<eos> - I won't.
I stole it.<eos> I have never stolen a story before in my life.<eos> How could I do that?<eos> It's him. It's Superman.<eos> I mean, ever since he held me in his arms... there's something between us, Lucy.<eos> I know it. There's this connection.<eos> You should be ashamed of yourself.<eos> I am ashamed of myself.<eos> And you'll never do it again?<eos> I won't, never again.
Our big-screen TV is probably arriving just about now.<eos> How we getting out?<eos> We need a plan.<eos> I got it.<eos> We'll give the keys to Elaine.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're a woman.<eos> Men won't hit a woman.<eos> Oh, they won't?

One shot.<eos> I could do it.<eos> I know I could do it.<eos> Jerry, we're friends.<eos> We can't do that.<eos> It would ruin our friendship.<eos> Oh, friendship. Friendship, schmiendship.<eos> -No, that's important to me.<eos> -We won't ruin the friendship.<eos> -Yes, we will.
What?<eos> I'm gay.<eos> I'm a gay man.<eos> I'm very, very gay.<eos> - You're gay?<eos> - Extraordinarily gay.<eos> Steeped in gayness.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> You don't believe me, ask Jerry.<eos> - I will.
It's all a misunderstanding.<eos> He sprayed several Skrreean boys with a foul-smelling vapour.<eos> - What do you have to say?<eos> - l'm sorry?<eos> - The boy's beside himself with guilt.<eos> - That doesn't excuse his actions.<eos> - And he will be punished severely.<eos> - l will?<eos> I want you to tell the Constable that you will never do it again.<eos> I won't?
But there is nothing to talk about.<eos> - You used to tell Curzon everything.<eos> - Not everything.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> - lt's because I'm a woman, isn't it?<eos> - Don't be ridiculous.<eos> It's hard to talk man-to-man with a woman.<eos> - That has nothing to do with it.<eos> - Then tell me what's going on.<eos> I will.
We'll be driving Mrs O'Brien crazy again in a few days.<eos> Just when I find a new home and friend<eos> - it always seems I have to leave.<eos> - Hey, hu-man!<eos> Cut it out!<eos> Has there ever been one of your kind and mine who were better friends?<eos> Never.<eos> If our fathers couldn't break us up, no stupid coupe...<eos> Coup d'état. lt's French.<eos> No stupid French thing will, either.
I have doubts. Of course, you do.<eos> It's only natural.<eos> No one is going to blame you for that.<eos> But in order to lose those doubts to keep fear and confusion away<eos> I need you to remain linked to the others so that their strength and their confidence can help you.<eos> I need you, Goval.<eos> I need you to help me build a future for the Borg.<eos> I can't do it without you.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Yes, I will.
-Have a nice night.<eos> -You, too.<eos> She's too young for you, Bill.<eos> I like them young.<eos> Shit!<eos> That trooper is behind us.<eos> Don't look back.<eos> Just be cool.<eos> What if he pulls us over?<eos> He won't.
- What do you want to do now?<eos> Nothing? - We call her in for questioning.<eos> She's got enough money to burn the department down...<eos> She was the last person seen with the guy.<eos> I'll take the responsibility.<eos> It's yours.<eos> It won't do any good.<eos> She'll just waltz in with some superstar lawyer who'll get us all canned for wasting the taxpayers' money.<eos> - That's exactly what she'll do.<eos> - No, she won't.
Remind me to take it out on what's-her-name.<eos> Santa Claus?<eos> Afraid not.<eos> I'm just a poor schmo.<eos> Got lucky.<eos> Sue me if I want to give some back.<eos> I only wish I could hand out more than just expensive baubles.<eos> I wish I could hand out world peace and unconditional love wrapped in a big bow.<eos> Oh, but you can.<eos> Oh, but you will.
How about the letters?<eos> The letters came first.<eos> I don't know who's writing them.<eos> Shit, but they're reading my mind.<eos> Those are my thoughts.<eos> It made me think I could do it.<eos> But I would never hurt the baby.<eos> I would never hurt Fletcher!<eos> - You must stop it.<eos> - We will.
They're racing against the sunset.<eos> It may be too late.<eos> Mina!<eos> Shoot!<eos> Charge!<eos> Quincey!<eos> No!<eos> No.<eos> When my time comes, will you do the same to me?<eos> Will you?
- You're no pinup.<eos> No?<eos> - No.<eos> You're not handsome at all.<eos> Are you tryin' to hurt my feelings?<eos> - No.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> - I could say the same thing about you.<eos> Could you?<eos> - But I won't.
You look tired, honey.<eos> You really gotta take better care of yourself.<eos> Look at this.<eos> I didn't have one gray hair not one until I married you.<eos> You can't even see that unless you're looking under a magnifying glass, Jimmy.<eos> Think I'm afraid?<eos> Of what?<eos> Of you.<eos> That you won't love me when I'm an old man.<eos> Of course I will.
And then the legend included Camille and Jean-Baptiste.<eos> It spread across the whole country... from village to village... from the border of China to Saigon.<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> Nobody move!<eos> Tell me, Guy.<eos> Why am I here?<eos> Camille's in Poulo-Condore prison. She's alive!<eos> Get her out.<eos> I want to see her.<eos> You won't!
No, that small one, over by the trees.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> He said this was your stick.<eos> He said it's all right now, he's found a good place.<eos> And if you behave yourself, you can go with them.<eos> He said he'll teach you big magic.<eos> He said he's never met a man like you before.<eos> And maybe, he never will again.
Don't say anything.<eos> Let's just get out of here.<eos> -Look sad.<eos> -Okay.<eos> My department had been alerted to Mr. Jenkins' ... ... deterioratingemotionalstate.<eos> Of course, none of us ever expected a tragedy like this.<eos> I think you can all appreciate how... .<eos> Oh, Nick.<eos> I never want to lose you.<eos> You won't.
Well, she slung eight of 'em.<eos> I drowned four right off.<eos> She couldn't feed that many.<eos> I just kept the biggest.<eos> Candy's dog is old and no good.<eos> You oughta get Candy to shoot that dog.<eos> Then you could give him one of the pups.<eos> All right.<eos> George, ask that man, can I have one of his pups?<eos> Yeah, I will.
- It's a bank. Nothing else under here but a bunch of spiders.<eos> Darn, it's empty.<eos> Bobby, we can stash money in this thing.<eos> - Don't tell anybody about this, okay?<eos> - I swear. Pinkie promise.<eos> I'm telling you, you're not supposed to pick your nose.<eos> Your brains will fall out.<eos> - Will not.<eos> - Will so. You'll make a hole in your head and your brains will fall out.<eos> - Will not.
That's 20, right?<eos> Sorry.<eos> We're millionaires!<eos> What are we gonna get with it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> We can't spend any of it.<eos> Promise we won't, Mike.<eos> Okay, Bobby.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We won't.
Ah, yes, another triumph for the dashing Agent Cooper.<eos> And now, Diane, you must clean the coffee cups, get fresh ground coffee from Sally, and make a damn great pot of coffee.<eos> Well, Agent Desmond wanted to check out the trailer court one more time.<eos> He asked me to drive the van with the body back to Portland, which I did.<eos> It was 105 miles.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?<eos> Stanley, I'm up to speed.<eos> Agent Desmond never did explain to me what the Blue Rose meant.<eos> Neither will I.
Okay, we'll see that also.<eos> Uncle, did you see?<eos> Mother seems lost these days.<eos> Her mind is somewhere else. Isn't it?<eos> - What happened mother?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Are you fine?<eos> If you permit, I'd like to celebrate your birthday in a grand way.<eos> And if I don't permit, then too will you celebrate it?<eos> Yes, I will.
!<eos> If you can't find any subcontractors, then use your family members to do the job!<eos> Call in your wife or whatever!<eos> Call in the girl working at the convenience store you go to along with anybody else!<eos> You crack me up, Han, really.<eos> I should call in the president's family too, huh?<eos> Yeah, call them.<eos> Call them now!<eos> Call them this instant!<eos> I definitely will!
Tahara and Handa are on the way here to pick up the rushes.<eos> Should we take a coffee break?<eos> The rich aroma that forcibly interrupts the story.<eos> The deep taste that makes even a zombie's eyes pop out.<eos> When you are tired of a confused story. For you, who know the difference, try Dog Blend.<eos> What ajoke.<eos> Human beings being bossed around by a zombie like that.<eos> We can't let that creep work as the chief of this movie!<eos> I'll show them.<eos> Soon, I will, by my own hands...
Careful, Stosh.<eos> We can cut through a lot of the ritual, here.<eos> Like I said, I want the chopper on the roof in a half hour.<eos> I want five back packs with enough food for five men... for a week, flashlights, sleeping bags, a compass.<eos> You get the idea. Either the chopper is on the roof in a half hour, or your first body hits the pavement.<eos> You're ok, right?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> And these guys aren't going to let us go even if I wasn't all right.<eos> - Maybe they will. - No, no, no.
You would have absolute power.<eos> Take this sword.<eos> Absolute power.<eos> Hey, it's worth a shot.<eos> Don't joke about it.<eos> That is a Mazamune sword.<eos> No one has ever fought with a finer weapon.<eos> Now come at me.<eos> Well... I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You won't.
I don't know what to do."<eos> And the conductor goes, "Do this.<eos> Like this..."<eos> "Oh, okay, thank you.<eos> Thank you very much."<eos> Why try anymore?<eos> There's no sense to it.<eos> I'll never meet anybody.<eos> I should accept it.<eos> - Oh, yes, you will.

We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place.<eos> We got a show about nothing.<eos> With no story.<eos> Do you think they're going, "Maybe we should give those two guys who have no experience and no idea, more money"?<eos> Oh, what are we gonna do?<eos> I'm shaking.<eos> I'm shaking.<eos> - I think you're wrong.<eos> - We'll just see.<eos> - Yes, we will.

Pick me.<eos> Pick me, pick me.<eos> I pick Ken GriffeyJr.<eos> Aw, geez.<eos> Okay, I'll take Millhouse.<eos> Mr. Boggs, will you be on my team?<eos> You got yourself a player.<eos> Damn!<eos> All right, I'll take Louis.<eos> I'll takeJose Canseco. D'oh!
No, because, for me none of this will have happened yet.<eos> What's that?<eos> That's history fulfilling itself.<eos> History has to fulfill itself.<eos> Even Picard knew that.<eos> You were there in the cavern.<eos> You know what happened. What am I supposed to do?<eos> If I told you what happened in that cavern it might affect any decision you'd make now.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I won't.
I was just rehearsing with my little theater group.<eos> I just love theslimelight.<eos> For tonight's dreary drama, I thought we'd try anexscarimentalpiece about a retired drag racer who's afraid of getting to thefinishedline a little sooner than he wants.<eos> I call this nasty nugget...<eos> King of the road.<eos> [Brakes screech] Oh, yeah!<eos> See you later, daddy.<eos> Will you be by tonight?<eos> Probably. You got a ride home?<eos> No, but I will.
A horrible, monstrous beast!<eos> -Is it a big beast?<eos> -Huge.<eos> -With a long, ugly snout?<eos> -Hideously ugly.<eos> -And sharp, cruel fangs? -Yes, yes!<eos> Will you help me?<eos> All right, old man.<eos> We'll help you out.<eos> You will?
- I got really hungry being dead.<eos> I don't think they believe us.<eos> We have to find someone who will.<eos> Catch you later, cop dudes!<eos> Ted, we can't go like this.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> And I would like to contact Ty Cobb.<eos> - Has this séance stuff ever worked?<eos> - No.<eos> But it will today, dude.
And for the flowers.<eos> You remembered I like 'mums.<eos> You got them, I'm glad.<eos> Susan, this is Lorie.<eos> She's...got the cubicle across from me.<eos> I didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> Maybe we could get together next week.<eos> Great, call me.<eos> But don't change your hair, or the deal is off.<eos> - I won't.
Why are you so upset?<eos> I don't like being lied to.<eos> I don't like secrets.<eos> I could report you.<eos> Have your license suspended.<eos> Stop acting like a petulant child.<eos> You haven't answered me.<eos> Who wrote this book?<eos> You tell me.<eos> I will.
You can tell Freidkin he can have the Faxton account. Thanks, Sheila.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Wanna dance? Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Sure.<eos> - Who's gonna lead? - You are.<eos> Okay.<eos> I forgot how to do this.<eos> This doesn't feel right.<eos> - Then I will.
This is called black powder, Bob!<eos> One teaspoon of this stuff can blow up a treestump.<eos> There we go!<eos> And how much is this?<eos> 20 pounds worth!<eos> You understand, don't you?<eos> There's no other solution!<eos> You won't go away!<eos> - I will!<eos> - No, you won't!
I'm sure he'll bless you if he comes to the celebration.<eos> He'll come if he's a man of his word.<eos> Is this the last?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Rest is for the celebration.<eos> I want some too, I'm hungry.<eos> Come here!<eos> Now!<eos> Eat, you need your strenght.<eos> - I won't.
-What are you talking about?<eos> -Our blind date to the game.<eos> blind date?<eos> No, see, I don't do blind dates.<eos> I mean, you think it's gonna be Mr. Right... and then it ends up being some tall, skinny guy... with big ears and weird clothes.<eos> I mean, not just you, anybody.<eos> Look, here you go.<eos> Here's your ticket.<eos> Hey, maybe I'II see you at the game.<eos> You probably will.
I'm late for a very important appointment.<eos> Victor Nesbitt.<eos> You'll remember that name.<eos> Kelly!<eos> Hit the top floor button!<eos> All right, pal, get on your feet. Come on, get up.<eos> Come on.<eos> MacGyver, we did it.<eos> You know, I just don't think it's right that Will should get off scot free.<eos> Oh, he won't.
Second... there's a break in that communication cable out there.<eos> I want you to locate it and repair it.<eos> What?<eos> Sir, with all due respect...<eos> I will put together that patrol for you... but I am not going out there.<eos> I don't have to.<eos> I'm an officer.<eos> God damn it, it's because you're an officer that you must go!<eos> I can't!<eos> I won't.
It's hopeless.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Hmm.<eos> "Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity.<eos> "No matter what you tell your child to do... he will always do the opposite." Huh?<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> You gotta use reverse psychology.<eos> That sounds too complicated.<eos> - Okay, don't use reverse psychology.<eos> - All right, I will.
What if we can't?<eos> Are you willing to take that chance?<eos> Besides, Evans City is a war zone.<eos> I've been there.<eos> It'll take a lot more than five miles to get any help.<eos> There's a gas pump out by the shed.<eos> My uncle keeps it locked.<eos> - You know where the key is?<eos> - No, but I can hunt for it.<eos> We will, but not now.
I got a big surprise for you.<eos> That's right, Big Ben's is 100 per cent American.<eos> I'm selling the store to the Japs.<eos> - What?<eos> Thought I was gonna leave it to you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, I'm not.<eos> I'm selling to the Hirohito Corporation.<eos> I still get the land, right, Dad?<eos> No, you won't. No, no.
Usher, you got a job downtown!<eos> That's a good pussycat.<eos> Good pussycat.<eos> How 'bout fixing me something to eat?<eos> I'm here. The cat's not.<eos> [Phone Rings] Hello?<eos> Hi, Anne.<eos> No, I haven't heard anything at all. I'm frantic about it.<eos> [Taps Tabletop] No, not really.<eos> I will.
- Here it is.<eos> Nice and creamy.<eos> This is a wonderful cup of Nilbog icecream for a little child.<eos> You're gonna stuff yourself with it, don't you?<eos> Kids with a sweet tooth like yours love icecream.<eos> Help, grandpa Seth!<eos> HELP!<eos> Hmmm, open your mouth my little friend.<eos> Please, open it!<eos> I won't.
You might as well give up. There's nowhere you can run.<eos> Where are you hiding? Saionji!<eos> no one can kill me. I will live forever. Forever?<eos> That's absurd.<eos> Everything in this universe has both a beginning and an end.<eos> except for one thing: Your crimes are eternal.<eos> too.<eos> It's finally over.<eos> My nightmare has ended.<eos> I will.
Go, go, go, go, Data, go. Go with your friends.<eos> May I say good-bye to Dr. Soong, sir?<eos> Alone, sir.<eos> Everybody dies, Data.<eos> Well, almost everybody.<eos> Do you believe that we are in some way alike, sir?<eos> In many ways, I'd like to believe.<eos> Then it is all right for you to die because I will remain alive.<eos> You know that I cannot grieve for you, sir.<eos> You will... in your own way.
How so?<eos> A classic case of stress-related ailments brought on by overwork.<eos> Exhaustion, irritability. Muscle spasms.<eos> Yet he insists on ignoring it.<eos> - Doesn't sound serious. - I plan on keeping it that way.<eos> - What's the treatment?<eos> - A week's shore leave.<eos> - Impossible.<eos> - I could make that an order.<eos> But you won't.
Because I can assure you that will not go down well at Starfleet Academy.<eos> Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.<eos> The Academy?<eos> I just received a message from Admiral Nsomeka.<eos> She expects you to report in two weeks.<eos> A position has opened up in this year's class.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, you're going to have to work overtime in order to catch up but I have assured the Admiral that you are capable of it.<eos> Please, don't make a liar out of me.<eos> Oh, no, sir, I won't.
Cowardice is a term I have never heard applied to Tasha.<eos> - Is something wrong?<eos> It is just that, for a moment, the expression on your face reminded me of her.<eos> It's been 15 years.<eos> I don't even remember what she looked like.<eos> You don't believe I'm Tasha's sister.<eos> We have considered the possibility.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> You can sample my DNA if you'd like.<eos> Yes. I will.
Trying to recalibrate nutation.<eos> Damn!<eos> - Shields have failed.<eos> - Fire all weapons.<eos> Their subspace field is intact.<eos> - New frequencies had no impact.<eos> - Reverse engines.<eos> Full reverse.<eos> - We're not moving.<eos> - Fire at will.
Bobby Leo moved.<eos> What's with the tablecloths?<eos> The critic has spoken.<eos> I feel like a fool.<eos> Norma, pick your lower lip up off the floor.<eos> It wasn't that bad. Mother, please don't tell me how to feel.<eos> This business is all I've got.<eos> I wanna keep my regular customers.<eos> I don't care if anyone new ever comes in here again.<eos> They probably won't.
Not much shade!<eos> ' They grumbled, as they set out across the scorching sand.<eos> 'We'd be better off in the cool shade of a glass of lager."'<eos> Make up your mind or I'll hitch a ride alone.<eos> All right. Let's go, daddy-o.<eos> A lube job, please.<eos> Where are the bathrooms? Come on, Mimi.<eos> Hey, kid, how'd you like to own a car like this?<eos> - Sure!<eos> - Well, you never will.
Help me get him to his feet.<eos> There is something else that reaches him...<eos> Human contact.<eos> Stand over there for a minute.<eos> He cannot walk without me.<eos> If I let go of him, he will fall.<eos> I will not let you fall.<eos> But... he will walk with me anywhere.<eos> It is like the ball, it is my will he is borrowing.<eos> The will of another human being.
Whatever.<eos> I never knew a murder could be so pure.<eos> Pure.<eos> I like that.<eos> Make sure he takes all of it.<eos> Understand?<eos> All of it.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> You're asking too much. I...<eos> -I won't.
No.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> It won't make any difference.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Somebody will do it. Cherepovetz will go, with the president and the generals.<eos> - I know.<eos> - And New York, and everything in between.<eos> I know but I'm not gonna do it. I can't.<eos> - You can't?<eos> - I won't.
Oh, to speak with elegance.<eos> Oh, to be a handsome musketeer.<eos> Roxane is precieuse, demanding charming. I need wit...and eloquence.<eos> I'll lend you it!<eos> And I'll borrow your good looks. We'll be a hero for storybooks. What?<eos> Can you learn by heart what I teach?<eos> You mean...<eos> You fear chilling her heart...<eos> Will you or won't you? Your look scares me.<eos> Will you?
There she is.<eos> - Which one?<eos> - The one in the yellow.<eos> She'd want to. Tadgh is no orator.<eos> Jaysus, she has a great pair of hips.<eos> She'll give me an heir alright.<eos> Good evening ladies.<eos> Hi. What are ye all laughing at?<eos> You think I'm not good enough for ya? Will you dance with me?<eos> I will not.
- I love that chair.<eos> - I know, but we discussed this.<eos> I've had it forever.<eos> - When I watch TV, I sit in it.<eos> - This chair is ugly.<eos> - And it doesn't go with anything.<eos> - It goes with me.<eos> You're right, it does.<eos> - We'll paint it.<eos> - We'll what?
"Have a really super time.<eos> "Oh, look, here's another one.<eos> "And another." –Oh, well.<eos> "There you go.<eos> Bless you." Well, thank you very much, if you don't mind me saying so.<eos> Indeed, I certainly don't mind you saying so.<eos> In fact, it's quite kind of you. Here's a fiver.<eos> Well, thank you, I'm sure.<eos> Well, I hope now, Hugh, you're going to monitor the public's behaviour very closely and if you find people are approaching you now with £5 notes instead of clenched fists, you'll come back on the programme and let us know?<eos> –I certainly will, yup.
Look, once again I like someone of whom you don't approve, for your own peculiar and inexplicable reasons.<eos> So you order him out like some Latin American generalissimo.<eos> Where's my life in all this?<eos> I'm sick and tired of trying to find someone who fits into your notion of Mr. Right!<eos> He's not Daddy. Nobody is.<eos> He's leaving and that's final.<eos> Now, you go right downstairs and tell him!<eos> You tell him.<eos> All right...<eos> I will! Alex...
- Think you can rescue her by yourself?<eos> It's not my business.<eos> You're not gonna try to save this woman?<eos> You don't care?<eos> Well, what do you care about?<eos> Fender.<eos> There's a cure for the plague and you don't give a shit?<eos> What kind of jerk are you?<eos> - Why don't you rescue her?<eos> - Maybe I will.
I am Chocolate!<eos> Why fooled me three times?<eos> It is my plan! So you fooled me!<eos> I had tried to tell you.<eos> Your I.Q. Is low<eos> How can you be my partner?<eos> Why should I be... what did you say? Les Vegas!<eos> Les Vegas!<eos> Right, 30/70! No! If you betrayed me again?<eos> I won't!
If she wasn't enjoying it, why didn't she cry for help? Tell me that.<eos> Because she is not some bargirl who knows how to deal with men.<eos> Because of shame.<eos> Better humiliation, than the shame of telling others she's been touched.<eos> That is the Japanese way, isn't it?<eos> - Maybe you're right.<eos> - I am right.<eos> And now, I will give you some information that will place you in my debt.<eos> Then I might not want to hear it.<eos> Yes, you will.
- Loosen up, Bow.<eos> - Willie, got one poured for you.<eos> - Not for me, thanks.<eos> All you do is exercise.<eos> You gotta live a little.<eos> My astronaut training starts in two days.<eos> Forget space cadet.<eos> I'll drink hers.<eos> What happens if he goes back and finds the bottle missing?<eos> He won't.
And she was so moved that she gave me a jewel-- an earring.<eos> She plucked from her ear and said...<eos> "A Tear of Sharez for my tears... when I heard your flute."<eos> I put it in my pocket.<eos> - It's nice, isn't it?<eos> How?<eos> I thought it was stolen.<eos> Her husband is j--<eos> You see, Zoe, he doesn't know it was all an innocent misunderstanding.<eos> - Neither will Mom.
Help!<eos> Get him up.<eos> Big Brother.<eos> Big Brother is great!<eos> Where's the letter? Letter, envelope?<eos> Here.<eos> Use Sparingly.<eos> The manager is watching.<eos> He catches us; we'll be fired.<eos> You won't.
Please tell her we've done our best.<eos> Now I am powerless.<eos> At this hour?<eos> What other hours you have in mind?<eos> The marriage will be destroyed.<eos> Consider we never helped her.<eos> That's beating a hasty retreat.<eos> Yes, I'm beating a hasty retreat.<eos> I won't tell her that. I've a heart.<eos> You... I won't either.
Are you going to tell Ellie?<eos> I have to mull that over for a while.<eos> Maybe I'll just tell her I haven't seen the damned cat around.<eos> I don't want to spoil her holiday. And Rachel's.<eos> Maybe there's a better way.<eos> Do we plant him outside the circle, or do we start a new one?<eos> The place we're going is on the other side of that.<eos> We can't climb over that.<eos> We'll break our necks.<eos> No, we won't.
Joseph.<eos> Joseph.<eos> Yes...<eos> let's have that drink.<eos> So...<eos> Your bumbling was the work of a ghost.<eos> Nah, Nah. It was... it was an accident.<eos> But you blamed me.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No... it won't.
What could be more important than what's going on with Dad?<eos> If we could talk about boys, everything would be so much easier.<eos> Your room is always ready.<eos> You can always come home if you want.<eos> All right.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> If they ask you questions would you please say something nice about him, Mom?<eos> Help him?<eos> - All right.<eos> - You will?
If she was able to make me afraid, well, that was all.<eos> - I'm going back.<eos> - To London?<eos> - No, to the house.<eos> - You shouldn't go there.<eos> Mr Toovey, I've been entrusted with a job, and I've hardly begun it.<eos> You shouldn't go there alone.<eos> - I can find no one to go with me.<eos> - No.<eos> Nobody will.
We will enter a hideous age of Puritanism.<eos> They'll close all the theatres. Lace handkerchiefs for men will be illegal.<eos> And I won't be able to find a friendly face to sit on this side of Boulogne.<eos> If they so much as suspect our loyalties, our property will be forfeit and we'll be for the chop.<eos> Oh, I love chops.<eos> Baldrick, your brain... is like the four-headed man-eating haddock fish beast of Aberdeen.<eos> - In what way? - It doesn't exist.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> What are we going to do? - Don't despair, Sir, something'll pop up.<eos> Not under Puritanism it won't.
- Deal again.<eos> Certainly.<eos> And he did, and he won.<eos> And the devils got into the kind of fume... only devils can get in.<eos> Fume.<eos> He won game after game... while the devils cheated to high heaven and low hell, to no avail.<eos> By the first bells of morning... the 40 barrels of gold... were stacked behind the chair of the soldier... who whistled as he won.<eos> Well, my friends...<eos> I suppose we'd better call it a day.<eos> No, we will not.
- You recognize me.<eos> You know me.<eos> You are not the Jason Bourne I knew.<eos> - Then who am I?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> Your face has been altered to look like Bourne but you are not a cold-blooded killer.<eos> Beyond that, I have no idea.<eos> If I run, will you shoot me?<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
He's got no money now.<eos> It has nothing to do with us.<eos> He made your life miserable.<eos> we did it because of money.<eos> Then who could it be?<eos> There's a phone over there.<eos> Don't die before you sign this! Sign this cheque before you're dead.<eos> You...<eos> He's nearly dead, so I won't care.<eos> If not, maybe I will.
- Our accounts are settled.<eos> There's nothing for you here.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What don't you understand?<eos> I still don't understand.<eos> You will one day.<eos> But I want to understand now.<eos> - Then understand now!<eos> - But I don't understand.<eos> You will one day.
But I don't think it will work<eos> Let them stay with you!<eos> It will be easier for me if I know you have them<eos> - l will try, but...<eos> - Get Glauce to ask her father<eos> Yes, I can persuade her lt will work if you do as I say<eos> Do what?<eos> Let our sons bear this gift to her<eos> Go with them<eos> Yes, I will
Go away while you can.<eos> This is not your war.<eos> It is now.<eos> So be it.<eos> You are a good friend.<eos> I stay.<eos> I will show you the way.<eos> I will go too.<eos> No, you go with them.<eos> I will not.
Why did you break all that glass?<eos> All right, you've come to, so just lie there, stupid.<eos> o it's me who bit him. That's my work.<eos> That'll mean a beating.<eos> However did you managed to lure such a nervous dog, Philip Philipovich.<eos> By kindness.<eos> The only way to deal with a living being. Terror will get you nowhere.<eos> That I have maintained, do maintain, and always will maintain.<eos> They believe, terror will help them.<eos> Well, it won't.
We were going to leave him no less than five rooms...<eos> This is a disgrace.<eos> If there were a discussion now I would prove to this Pyotr Alexandrovitch...<eos> Pardon me, do you wish to open a discussion right now?<eos> I can understand your irony, Professor.<eos> We will leave now. till, as chairman of the cultural department of this house I...<eos> - Chairwoman.<eos> - Chairwoman. ...I suggest that you buy some of these magazines sold for the benefit of the children of Germany.<eos> - Fifty kopecks a copy.<eos> - No. I will not.
Is that the code for it?<eos> It's possible.<eos> How the hell would you know, lady?<eos> Because I used to date a guy... who worked at the Rand Corporation.<eos> I've just been trying to reach a few of our friends... who could tell me if the unthinkable... was being thought about in D.C.<eos> At this very moment, 4 out of 5 are in transit... to the extreme southern hemisphere.<eos> I find that more than just very curious.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> We have less than forty-six minutes till we know.<eos> And then everyone will.
Because i want you to get that promotion.<eos> Get out there and start kissing up. [Kissing sounds]<eos> I'm not kissing up to anyone.<eos> Especially, not walter burke !<eos> I knew you wouldn't. That's why i'm here to do it for you.<eos> Oh, wally !<eos> No , wait !<eos> You can't go out there.<eos> What if they discover you're an alien ?<eos> They won't !
Though our hearts be troubled with this graveloss, we must remind ourselves of the fleetingness of our own lives, and that someday we shall rejoice with Margaret forever in the hereafter.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Thank you.<eos> -You're welcome.<eos> We're going back to Boston, Miss Shirley.<eos> -Pauline has accepted Isaac Kent.<eos> I've decided to sell Maplehurst.<eos> How I shall miss you, Emme. But we will see each other again soon.<eos> And I promise you I won't ever forget you. Just you mind that.<eos> I will.
- ... and wants to meet people!<eos> - What's she like?<eos> She's a sweetheart, good sense of humour.<eos> You'll love her!<eos> I won't love her because this won't happen!<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> But I highly recommend her.<eos> Talk about the kiss of death!<eos> - Call us if you change your mind.<eos> - I won't!
Good.<eos> How's Mommy?<eos> Send her my love?<eos> Okay.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Call me tomorrow.<eos> I will.<eos> I promise. You be sure you tell Mommy I called?<eos> I will.
I said to her, "What's your name?" Fuck your name!<eos> Nearly did, too.<eos> Wish I had.<eos> And you, too grand to come to the boathouse.<eos> "Haw, my man. Five shillings not good enough for you, eh?"<eos> You've no idea how you nearly missed gettin' me.<eos> Boathouse was the place I always fancied.<eos> I still got the key now, matter of fact.<eos> We'll meet in your boathouse yet.<eos> No, we won't.
Yeah.<eos> I want you to stop seeing her.<eos> OK.<eos> And go to confession.<eos> A man understands one day that his life is built on nothing and that's a bad, crazy day.<eos> Your life is not built on nothing.<eos> - It's Johnny, I'll get it.<eos> - I'll get it.<eos> - I should tell him.<eos> - I will.
And stay out of the way of the big boys, until you can handle them.<eos> But if they won't leave you alone, you hit first and run hard.<eos> They'll leave you alone if you hit hard enough.<eos> Listen to everything the teacher says and don't make trouble.<eos> Remember to use your handkerchief.<eos> Do not use your fingers.<eos> But if no one's looking, then you can save the handkerchief.<eos> Take care of your sweater, now that I've mended it.<eos> If the teacher's wife invites you to coffee, take only one piece cake.<eos> - But she won't.
Hey, can you...<eos> Excuse me, can you...<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Please. Thank you.<eos> Guys, we got enough to get the Masked Avenger rings and an ice cream soda.<eos> - We gotta leave some for Palestine.<eos> - Why? It's all the way over in Egypt.<eos> - It's a sin.<eos> What if the rabbi catches us?<eos> - He won't.
He runs OCP.<eos> OCP runs the cops.<eos> Come in, Officer.<eos> You know, I don't usually see anyone without an appointment, but in your case, I'll make an exception.<eos> You are under arrest.<eos> On what charge?<eos> Aiding and abetting a known felon.<eos> Sounds like I'm in a lot of trouble.<eos> You better take me in.<eos> I Will.
There lies our strength.<eos> We act as one.<eos> You make no sense, Borsa.<eos> Your servants are like family, but if they want some of your useless land, you kill them.<eos> Even the useless land has belonged to my family for a thousand years.<eos> I hold it for my son, as my father did for me and his father for him.<eos> We will never let it go.<eos> - We can't.<eos> - And if the communists win?<eos> They won't.
Laura, baby, I hate to leave, but the city just won't wait.<eos> Mmm. I will.
I promise you.<eos> Under the car get Rognir.<eos> When the big wolf creeps around.<eos> Show me.<eos> Thor outside. Hidden.<eos> Hagor in the air.<eos> Odal and Barga in the fire and hidden.<eos> Lagu day and in the earth.<eos> You will encounter.<eos> The son of Herne will.
- I'm calling Dawson right now.<eos> We'll just see what he has to say about this little stunt.<eos> Dawson doesn't have any more to do with this.<eos> - He's your brother!<eos> - And that's all.<eos> Dawson will put a stop to this.<eos> He'll take the gun away.<eos> If you call him, I'll just have to do it before he gets here.<eos> Soon as you hang up the phone I'll just walk in the bedroom and lock the door.<eos> You will not!
Well, just un-tell him.<eos> -No, I'd just be too scared.<eos> What harm could it do?<eos> It's not gonna make things worse than this, never seeing him again.<eos> I suppose that's true.<eos> -Of course.<eos> So call him. Take a chance, will you?<eos> -You've gotta try, Lenny.<eos> Yeah. You should.<eos> -All right, I will.
We're here for the Crites.<eos> The county is going to pay for this, Jeff.<eos> Jeff?<eos> Jeff?<eos> Jeff Barnes?<eos> Jay.<eos> Jay, what are you doing?<eos> Maybe we ought to just stay put.<eos> They haven't gotten into the house yet.<eos> They will.
- The whole night.<eos> I've got the time.<eos> Look, if you want to punch me, I'm ready.<eos> Go on, laugh.<eos> You say that to me?<eos> You think I'm worth nothing, you do.<eos> I'm an idiot, aren't I?<eos> Because I didn't understand anything about Giulia because she's fine, and all she needed to get well was to fall in love.<eos> Great, but when you leave her? !<eos> I won't lea ve her.
- You must come with me.<eos> - She'll need some things.<eos> Indeed.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> - Jane!<eos> Jane!<eos> - No!<eos> No!<eos> I will not!
Let me jockey for a position.<eos> You look OK.<eos> She is very attractive.<eos> You'd risk Laura's death with a fake.<eos> We risk getting robbed with the real one.<eos> Don't hand it over until we know Laura's safe.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Go alone. I'll keep watch.<eos> - No looking at the ladies, now.<eos> - I won't.
- Open up, imbecile!<eos> - No, I won't!<eos> - We can talk through the door.<eos> - Why?<eos> If I can't see you, I might tell you something.<eos> You're as mad as your poor father.<eos> What do you want to tell me?<eos> I don't want to, but you're insisting, so ask away!<eos> Tell me who she is!<eos> No, I won't!
There is a house I want to buy.<eos> Let's just cut to the chase, okay?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want you to loan me $200,000 in cash.<eos> No.<eos> Benny!<eos> - You shout at me?<eos> - I shout at you!<eos> - I need that money, and you're gonna loan it to me!<eos> - I will not!
I couldn't listen.<eos> I couldn't watch, so I went away.<eos> People said I was the height of callousness.<eos> It's not true.<eos> I loved her too much to watch her die.<eos> I'm not here to boss you around.<eos> I'm here to work for you. And if I'm not working hard enough, you just tell me and I'll work harder.<eos> You just come up and say:<eos> "Mister, you gotta do a whole lot better than that."<eos> And I will.
- What?<eos> - Come on.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Wait a minute, what are you...<eos> Now, I want to tell you something.<eos> You have to promise not to tell anyone!<eos> - Okay.<eos> I won't. - No, I'm serious.<eos> No one else can know.<eos> I won't.
First....<eos> Out.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It is important to develop the master-dog relationship.<eos> If you show any fear... the dog will not respect you.<eos> -Sweetchuck.<eos> -Me?<eos> -Order the dogs to sit.<eos> -They won't listen to me.<eos> They will.
I know, I know.<eos> I gotta get ready myself.<eos> - You going out?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> New guy.<eos> Terrence.<eos> Owns a pet shop.<eos> We'll see what happens.<eos> - Give Mr Perfecto a squeeze for me.<eos> - I will.
You didn't give me a chance Otis.<eos> You threw the fucker right out the window.<eos> It ain't my fault it broke.<eos> Go back and get it if you want.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Want to get a beer?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> I want a beer.<eos> If you want a beer so bad, Otis go ahead and get one.<eos> All right, I will.
- Blast the man.<eos> - You know Bent.<eos> The court-martial is a blot on his record.<eos> He'll take that out on Fisk. It's time we did something about Bent before he kills somebody.<eos> What can we do?<eos> I just remembered something.<eos> Lt. DeJong thinks Alice Peet does laundry for him and nobody else.<eos> Now, what if we were to use that information... to give Bent a little taste of his own medicine?<eos> What if he leaves too soon?<eos> - He won't.
I lost my temper.<eos> So did I.<eos> Now you've put me to shame, George.<eos> God, I'm glad you came.<eos> Now I can apologize.<eos> I have missed you, George.<eos> - That's grand, George, congratulations.<eos> - Thank you. I always knew you'd be a wonderful father.<eos> - Next March, if all goes well.<eos> - Of course it will.
Mr. Bates knows what's about to take place.<eos> He feels no obligation to bear witness in person.<eos> The execution will be televised for all to see.<eos> We shall miss him nonetheless.<eos> I believe you haven't had the opportunity to see the disintegrator in operation.<eos> I've been told it is most impressive.<eos> - Any word from the Resistance?<eos> - None whatsoever.<eos> I hope they don't disappoint us.<eos> They won't.
This is a plaster-of-Paris bagel and cream cheese paperweight.<eos> I bought it from a local artist.<eos> Kiki Bridges.<eos> Did you ever hear of her?<eos> Julie I promised I would come back and I did.<eos> Now I really do have to go.<eos> I gotta sleep.<eos> You understand that, don't you?<eos> And I promise I'm gonna see you again.<eos> I will.
You cannot make an omelet without breaking eggs.<eos> Every cook will tell you that.<eos> But look what happened to the cook.<eos> Colonel, are you willing to take that chance?<eos> What choice have we?<eos> None.<eos> I suppose you're right.<eos> But it's dark upstairs.<eos> Will anyone go with me?<eos> - I will.
Someone's killing your men.<eos> You gave them new identities.<eos> There must have been a leak.<eos> Lawson, Forrestal, Bennett, they've all been hit.<eos> - Who is doing it?<eos> - You've made enemies all over the world.<eos> It could have been the Syrians, the South Americans... the Russians or a terrorist group.<eos> They're gonna find you.<eos> We were going to make a normal life here.<eos> You will.
Oh, now.<eos> Look, Biff, when you grow up you'll understand about these things.<eos> No, you mustrt overemphasise a thing like this.<eos> Come on, III see Birnbaum first thing in the morning.<eos> - Never mind.<eos> - Never mind?<eos> He's gonna give you those points.<eos> I'll see to it.<eos> - He won't listen to you.<eos> - He certainly will!
He had to fly for the first time, didn't he?<eos> That's right.<eos> He flew and he flew... and, finally, after the storm, he found his way home.<eos> Now, honey, I want you to find Deej.<eos> The Ewoks will help you.<eos> - No, Daddy. I want to stay with you.<eos> - No, sweetheart. You can't do that.<eos> You have to go on without me.<eos> You have to be like that little bird and fly away.<eos> - I won't .
Archie, what did you do?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Archie!<eos> Somebody's at the door.<eos> See who it is.<eos> Cover me.<eos> - Freeze! - No!<eos> Take what you want.<eos> - Just don't harm the children.<eos> - I won't.
- Morning, Brother.<eos> I cook breakfast every Wednesday morning.<eos> But it'll be your job from tomorrow.<eos> So you better find out what they like.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> - What about drinks?<eos> - They all like Pepsi Cola! Here.<eos> - Good morning. - Morning.<eos> Who wants to challenge me?<eos> - We all will. - Yeah!
NO, DUSSELDORF!<eos> THE REPLY IS BREMERHAVEN.<eos> I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU ARE ON YOUR TOES.<eos> HALT.<eos> WHY HAVE WE HALTED?<eos> I WAS JUST GETTING INTO THE SWING OF IT.<eos> THE CUSHION WHICH I AM WEARING UNDER MY JACKET TO MAKE MY STOMACH LOOK LIKE THE COLONEL'S IS SLIPPING DOWN TOWARDS MY CROTCH.<eos> I WILL HELP YOU TO ADJUST IT.<eos> STOP, WE WILL AROUSE THE SUSPICION OF THE SENTRY.<eos> NO, WE WILL NOT.
Just make sure she doesn't get in the way.<eos> You can't do this to me!<eos> I've always looked up to you.<eos> Hold her arm.<eos> Respected you.<eos> I...<eos> All right, take her in the other room and tie her up.<eos> I talked to my contact a little while ago.<eos> I assured him nothing would go wrong.<eos> And nothing will.
How's Laura?<eos> Well, she was pretty torn up when she talked with Devon.<eos> Since her husband died, Becky's been her whole life.<eos> April, you gotta hang in there.<eos> They're both gonna need you.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I didn't even take time to change.<eos> April, you look fine.<eos> (KITT) april, tell Becky I'm pulling for her.<eos> (April) I will.
Well, I won't.<eos> How are we supposed to live?<eos> Do you want me to beg on the streets?<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> - All they want to see is your work.<eos> - Shit. - What's wrong with that?<eos> - Shut up! Just shut up.<eos> One royal pupil, and all of Vienna will come flocking.<eos> They'll come anyway.<eos> - No, they won't.
They say you have debts.<eos> Who? Who says that?<eos> That's a malicious lie!<eos> Do you have pupils?<eos> I don't want pupils!<eos> They get in the way.<eos> I have to have time for composition.<eos> Composition doesn't pay.<eos> You know that.<eos> That one will.
We get the horn, her guards will kill us, and Bombaata takes the girl and the horn back to her.<eos> - And her promise to you?<eos> - A lie.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - To Shadizar.<eos> - What for?<eos> - To stop Jehnna's sacrifice.<eos> But it's her destiny. It can't be stopped.<eos> - You don't have to come. - I will.<eos> - I will.
- Hi everybody. - Hi, Junior. - Hello, Junior.<eos> - Hi, Junior. - How you doing, love? How did it go last night, Junior?<eos> Franny, what do you think about moving to Vienna?<eos> I think it'll be more sophisticated than staying here.<eos> Well... what am I gonna do without you?<eos> - You did okay last night.<eos> - The pot calling the kettle black.<eos> John? - Take me to Vienna with you.<eos> - I'll ask Pop.<eos> No, you won't.
Like a coward.<eos> Choose instant destruction while the rest of us are doomed to stay here in our beloved city...<eos> And slowly perish.<eos> Kara!<eos> Kara, no!<eos> Kara!<eos> No!<eos> You lunatic!<eos> She'll be killed.<eos> Oh, no, she won't.
I'm ashamed of you!<eos> Don't be so unhappy.<eos> You're got her so mad she can't even speak.<eos> I'll do the questioning.<eos> Hey, don't get me in trouble. Don't worry.<eos> I won't ask you about the girl.<eos> I'm going to ask you a question Just give an honest answer.<eos> Apart from you wife do you ever think of other women. I don't want to answer that.<eos> I want you to!<eos> No I won't!
I busted my buns saving up for that shoe box.<eos> Took me a month.<eos> This is all I got left.<eos> Every cent.<eos> But I want to chip in to help.<eos> $3.68.<eos> That just about covers our fee.<eos> And if you fail, then things will be worse.<eos> They won't fail. I've seen what they can do.<eos> - They won't.
Please, sir. That's right!<eos> You can hit me as much as you want, too. But give us the fish. Go on.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Will you tell me why you boys want that blasted carp? It's for our mother, sir.<eos> She's going to have a baby, and she's not very well.<eos> And Mr. Pak said carp blood's the only thing that'll help her.<eos> Without it, my mother will get worse or even... You wouldn't want my mother to die, would you?<eos> Oh, please, help us.<eos> Please save her.<eos> You won't?
Down there.<eos> We had better get started.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Let us try it.<eos> Christine has to come through the door.<eos> You have to get into the office and stay out of sight.<eos> Once she gets inside, hit the button and bring the door down.<eos> Then we will have her trapped.<eos> What if he does not come?<eos> Christine will.
I can assume any form I wish.<eos> Any form you wish.<eos> There's no love in that form.<eos> And you think there's love in your boy king?<eos> I've not held a man in my arms since my lover left.<eos> This is a lie!<eos> I know how painful it is to be far from your lover.<eos> He will betray you.<eos> Comfort me for one night.<eos> He will not.
You could die!<eos> She is evil!<eos> Whoever goes there... doesn't come back.<eos> Or her magic... will drive him crazy.<eos> Miss Alice?<eos> Some men have come to pick you up.<eos> They're waiting for you downstairs.<eos> Good morning, Miss Alice.<eos> This note is for you.<eos> Myservants will g0 with you.
It's fresh.<eos> It came right out of that tank.<eos> You cooked my angelfish?<eos> Why do you do these terrible things?<eos> Because I love to see those veins in your temple throb.<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> I'll kill...<eos> Devil woman!<eos> - You'll never do this to another man!<eos> - Oh, yes, I will.
Biggs.<eos> Don't know. Sorry, sir.<eos> Can'ter?<eos> Was it taking your clothes off, sir?<eos> And after that?<eos> Putting them on a lower peg, sir.<eos> The purpose of foreplay is to cause the vagina to lubricate so that the penis can penetrate more easily.<eos> Could we open a window, sir?<eos> Yes.<eos> Harris, will you?
Keep him moving, Tommy.<eos> MAN: Stand back.<eos> Harry... how did the wonder horse travel?<eos> Oh, I love the way you blokes keep calling him the "wonder horse".<eos> You weren't calling him that when he was losing all his races at the start.<eos> Well, he's really found form now.<eos> Who do you think made him find the form?<eos> Do you reckon he learned all by himself?<eos> And you think he'll win the Melbourne Cup?<eos> Of course he will.
Good on ya.<eos> Well, thas the end of Phar Lap.<eos> They've given him 10 stone 10 for the Melbourne Cup.<eos> What are they trying to do, kill him?<eos> If they have to.<eos> Has any horse ever carried that much weight in a 2-mile race?<eos> Nowhere near it.<eos> I'm a tolerant man, Jack, as you know, but finally I'm forced to the conclusion that McKinnon and his cronies are a pack of pricks.<eos> Maybe Mr Davis won't let him run.<eos> Yes, he will.
- Yes. - Well, who plays that part?<eos> - Pee Wee. Oh.<eos> So Pee Wee plays the little fairy and you play a big fairy.<eos> That's a lot of fairies.<eos> You guys get to run around the woods together?<eos> You guys must be really proud of your ignorance cos you show it off so much.<eos> - John Henry.<eos> - Yes, I know.<eos> Tell Mrs Morris I'll take the part.<eos> I will.
Dying. He'd only been in 15 years.<eos> You won't catch me dying. They'll have to kill me before I die.<eos> Many a man has tried, Captain Yellowbeard.<eos> And soon you will be at large again.<eos> With a hand-picked crew of the hardest buccaneers... that have ever stained the seven seas with Spanish blood.<eos> It was most unjust I thought, locking you up for... merely doing your duty.<eos> Twenty years for killing 5,000 dagos and frogs.<eos> Betrayed by me right-hand man, that bastard Moon.<eos> But he never found out where you hid the treasure, did he?<eos> No! Nor will he ever.
Oh, it gave me goosebumps to hear him carry on that way!<eos> Like the rats might have some horrible disease!<eos> Night, Beth... I told him you'd call him back.<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> Moving!<eos> - It can't be!<eos> - It certainly can! I don't suppose you've packed!<eos> What about Timmy?<eos> The chill in the air could kill him!<eos> Well child, that tractor surely will.
You understand?<eos> - Say you understand.<eos> - I understand that.<eos> Did you participate in the abduction of Jerry Langford?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I abducted him. You abducted him?<eos> Do you know where Mr. Langford is now?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> - Will you lead us to Mr. Langford?<eos> - No, I won't.
Yeah.<eos> And can you lend me your Malagutti?<eos> I can't keep my moped.<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> Okay for the dough, but not the Malagutti, shit!<eos> - I'm still breaking it in.<eos> - Breaking it in?<eos> You don't know what it means to break it in?<eos> - Fine, break it in.<eos> - Yes, I will.
- He's just gone out with Jo to check on the flock.<eos> Good morning, Lucy.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - You don't despise me, do you?<eos> No.<eos> How could I?<eos> Well, you could.<eos> I could.<eos> It can't happen again.<eos> It won't.
Morning.<eos> We seem to have... lost our train.<eos> - Two weeks.<eos> - Two weeks!<eos> Bugger it!<eos> Unless you're game enough to cross the lake.<eos> Hey, Arch, two weeks, that's not too long...<eos> - Hey, Arch, hang on!<eos> - Better take this.<eos> Hey, Archy, will ya...
There's no time left for jokes.<eos> You know where she came from, what she wants?<eos> Mark. Mark, where are you?<eos> You've seen me before.<eos> But where?<eos> Perhaps in your dreams.<eos> - But how could I?<eos> - There's no way you could have understood.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Perhaps now you will.
People can't stop trying to take it away from me.<eos> OK.<eos> Now leave me the car.<eos> Take Margie's keys and go to her place and wait there.<eos> Can you drive a motorbike? Heinrich taught me.<eos> It's outside.<eos> Now, I'll take care of Bob and everything.<eos> I'll go to the bank on Monday and take the money out.<eos> If Bob wakes up, tell him...<eos> I will.
You just made the list. buddy.<eos> And I don't like nobody touching my stuff!<eos> So just keep your meat hooks off.<eos> If I catch any of you guys in my stuff. I'll kill you.<eos> Also. I don't like nobody touching me.<eos> Now. any of you homos touch me. and I'll kill you.<eos> Lighten up. Francis.<eos> You're all in this together.<eos> One of these men may save your life one of these days. understand?<eos> Then again. maybe one of us won't.
Come away from the window, please.<eos> I like him.<eos> He appears intelligent and serious.<eos> A serious and intelligent man wants a serious and accomplished partner.<eos> Looks are not everything.<eos> Character is more- and accomplishment, of course.<eos> Come in.<eos> Lydia, dear, you will need to tuck a little lace tomorrow.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> - She will, lady Lucas, won't she?
At Netherfield?<eos> I will not be invited. Of that, at least, we can be certain.<eos> In fact, I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honored with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening.<eos> Do come along, Mr. Collins.<eos> ¶ Near Woodstock town in oxfordshire ¶ ¶ as I walked forth to take the air... ¶<eos> I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.<eos> Society has claims on us all.<eos> - Until Tuesday, there is Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday.<eos> If it stopped raining we could at least walk to Meryton.<eos> But it will not.
But he'll need something rubbed on his skin.<eos> No.<eos> Applications to the skin don't do any good at all.<eos> You mean them filthy bottles of stuff that fancy fellow in brawton made him buy were a waste of time?<eos> - Afraid so, yes.<eos> Yellow it was and stank the place out.<eos> Ruined my carpets, and good chair covers.<eos> I can't wait till I get home.<eos> I'll show him.<eos> By gum, I will!
You had your mother for that.<eos> Quiet...<eos> Must you do this to me?<eos> Calm down, please<eos> It's not as bad as you make it<eos> You're exaggerating.<eos> We haven't come to such odds We've been through difficult moments before<eos> We'll grow old together<eos> I won't leave you<eos> You won't? But I will!
Even Pitoeff turned it down!<eos> D´you know Mrs Fabre?<eos> She wants to ask you for a favor.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I know Madame.<eos> It´s about my son, Pierre.<eos> What´s he doing here?<eos> He likes to sniff around at rehearsals... when he´s interested in a play.<eos> Will he write about us?<eos> He will, or he won´t.
The cave.<eos> Remember your failure at the cave.<eos> But I've learned so much since then.<eos> Master Yoda, I promise to return and to finish what I've begun.<eos> You have my word.<eos> It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants.<eos> That is why your friends are made to suffer.<eos> That's why I have to go.<eos> Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.<eos> You won't.
I understand.<eos> R2.<eos> Fire up the converters.<eos> Luke!<eos> Don't give in to hate.<eos> That leads to the dark side.<eos> Strong is Vader.<eos> Mind what you have learned.<eos> Save you it can.<eos> I will.
My only child.<eos> Jason.<eos> You let him drown!<eos> You never paid any attention!<eos> Look what you did to him!<eos> Look what you did to him!<eos> Kill her, Mommy.<eos> Kill her!<eos> Don't let her get away, Mommy. Don't let her live!<eos> I won't, Jason.
Jason.<eos> You let him drown!<eos> You never paid any attention!<eos> Look what you did to him!<eos> Look what you did to him!<eos> Kill her, Mommy.<eos> Kill her!<eos> Don't let her get away, Mommy. Don't let her live!<eos> I won't, Jason.<eos> I won't!
Large<eos> Large<eos> Large<eos> Mine<eos> Mine<eos> Mine<eos> Mine...<eos> She won't marry me. Oh.<eos> She will.<eos> She won't.
Who is it?<eos> Richard Collier.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You sleep all right?<eos> Wonderfully.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't sleep too well either.<eos> But I was on a porch chair. So, you know...<eos> Don't you even have a room?<eos> Yes, I will at 9:18.
He got married six months ago, and went to Australia.<eos> Is there nobody else can give him a helping hand?<eos> No, they're all in the same boat, Mr. farnon.<eos> And there's no paid labor to be had, even if he could afford it.<eos> Getting the lad and his wife to Australia took all we-- all he had.<eos> But what will you do?<eos> What can you do?<eos> I don't know, but I've got to do something.<eos> You know he's got to sell those sheep.<eos> He won't, Mr. farnon.
You could always confront Chameleon.<eos> - I'd be practically calling the man a liar.<eos> - Not practically.<eos> If he's telling the truth, he'll understand.<eos> If he's not telling the truth, I wouldn't worry about his feelings.<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> I happen to believe the man.<eos> I'd rather be on patrol... but I'm with you.<eos> Would you ask Colonel Tigh to run the security check?<eos> I will.
- I won't.<eos> What is it you found?<eos> - Don't go in there.<eos> - Let me go!<eos> - You don't want to go in there!<eos> Apollo.<eos> Maybe she should.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Take a look.<eos> All right, I will.
Mama-san! He-Hey!<eos> They're gone.<eos> The place is deserted.<eos> They took everything.<eos> - Including the neighbors.<eos> - Where'd they go?<eos> I guess to someplace safe from the shelling, like this used to be.<eos> - But I'll never find them.<eos> - Maybe they'll come back.<eos> [Chuckles] No, they won't.
Ferdy!<eos> - Hello, lovers!<eos> - Hi, Monkey!<eos> Go on, get in there!<eos> She won't bite.<eos> 'Cos if you don't, I might!<eos> - No, I'm not bothered.<eos> - Not much.<eos> I know, I'll ask for you.<eos> - No, you won't.
This way.<eos> Where did you get these marks?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Now, call me in the night if you want anything.<eos> Anything. Even if you have a bad dream.<eos> Will you be sure to do that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, anything. I mean it.<eos> I'll be right down the hall.<eos> I will.
I don't like that, either.<eos> I hate that.<eos> But can't you just personalize it a little?<eos> I want to have sex with you, Marilyn?<eos> I want to have sex with you, Marilyn.<eos> I want to have sex with you, Potter.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> I'm not that good.<eos> I won't let anyone do that to me.<eos> I just won't!
I can not.<eos> You will have to join the others.<eos> Molly!<eos> Jerry!<eos> Molly!<eos> Jerry?<eos> - Jerry!<eos> - Molly!<eos> Let Molly!<eos> We will.
Day calls, night calls.<eos> Six hours sleep in 24 if I'm lucky.<eos> I'm completely worn out.<eos> I need a society for the prevention of cruelty to vets.<eos> I can't pretend I'm bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.<eos> It's the longest month ever.<eos> - And two weeks left.<eos> Don't rub it in. I shan't last the course.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> We both will.
I am Jyunai Asada from the Totomi-administration.<eos> I am Itto Ogami.<eos> Master Gemba Sawatari would like to meet you.<eos> He told us to find you.<eos> Am I going to meet him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Please come with us.<eos> Will he come?<eos> He has to.<eos> If he won't, we ...
There's just something in my head that makes me feel... paralyzed sometimes.<eos> We've discussed that already.<eos> Is it no better?<eos> No, it's not better.<eos> Just look at my hair.<eos> I've cut my hair off.<eos> I'm so sorry for you that you don't like me like this.<eos> A few hairs don't make any difference.<eos> -Nobody will notice.<eos> -Oh yes they will.
You want me to beg?<eos> Okay, this is me, Fats, and I'm beggin'.<eos> It's not easy for me either.<eos> It is.<eos> It is easy.<eos> You wont be alone.<eos> I'll tell.<eos> What will you tell?<eos> Everything.<eos> I will.
Do I?<eos> Standing Snake.<eos> The Snake Rears.<eos> Teacher does that.<eos> It looks right, but that's all.<eos> Are you stupid?<eos> Do you doubt me?<eos> Right. So try me!<eos> Try?<eos> Sure I will.
Andersen, you are on watch.<eos> Would you please?<eos> Okay...<eos> The celebration, I must admit that I am a bit concerned... about this year's dramatization of the ten commandments.<eos> The kids' version promises to be entertaining?<eos> Don't worry, it will certainly be entertaining and festive!<eos> Come down here, Lars.<eos> I don't like that it's so dark.<eos> What if someone comes down here?<eos> No one will.
My name's Portnov.<eos> Police investigator.<eos> My name won't mean anything to you.<eos> Tell me anyway.<eos> Let's just say Ivanov.<eos> I've nothing against that. Let it be Ivanov.<eos> From what squadron?<eos> Don't start with that.<eos> I'm not saying anything.<eos> You won't?
Grow your beard back for me, it makes you look this...<eos> Giovanna. Leave us alone. Please.<eos> What do you want of me? An answer.<eos> To what question.<eos> Did you know Agnese Bignardi?<eos> Get out.<eos> Leave here at once!<eos> You were lovers, weren't you? I won't stand for this!<eos> Get out!<eos> - Neither will I.
And the shadow of the person that took the picture was in the foreground.<eos> And it was wide.<eos> And it fell on their legs, and all I could think about was, "who took the picture?"<eos> I spent more time looking at the shadow than I did at my own wife or kids.<eos> I was just going to give Margaret and the kids something to remember me by.<eos> I was just going to give the guy that took the picture something to remember me by.<eos> I was just going to give this whole son-of-a-bitching country<eos> If they can do it to me, why shouldn't I be able to do it to them?<eos> You will.<eos> I won't!
They're touched with humanity. And some of the noble virtues of humanity. Rage, anger, hatred.<eos> Homicidal hatred.<eos> You've given them something to hate!<eos> Do you want to live?<eos> Do you?<eos> Then they will have to fear you as they fear me.<eos> I want no part of this.<eos> You have no choice.<eos> I told you a ship will be coming.<eos> It will, the supply ship, but not for two years.
The key!<eos> The only means of opening the door to the shrine.<eos> Hyperborea... to visit the shrine, examine the very source of life.<eos> Archimedes would split himself with envy.<eos> Now, everyone, stand well back!<eos> Imagine that power a million times greater used not for evil, but for good.<eos> That is what the Arimaspi have left us!<eos> Yes, I will go with you.<eos> - Thank you!<eos> - Yes, by all the gods, I will.
I swear to you I won't do it again.<eos> Yes, well, let's not be in too much of a hurry to swear anything.<eos> My dear, I must talk to you like a grown woman now.<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> Can I open my heart to you?<eos> Oh, yes, Grandmother, yes.<eos> Many years ago, before you were born, we all went through the terrible agony of civil war.<eos> Rome tottered and shook and nearly fell.<eos> I'm afraid that may happen again.<eos> And will it?
- Well, what do you think?<eos> - I like it. I think it's terrific.<eos> Look at that. No ruffles at all!<eos> Red.<eos> I might've known it would be red.<eos> It's pink, Mama.<eos> Look what Tommy gave me, Mama.<eos> Aren't they beautiful?<eos> I can see your dirty pillows.<eos> Everyone will.
Look, tomorrow is Sunday.<eos> No, I wouldn't like to see the studio.<eos> You wouldn't?<eos> Monroe, we have that...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Look.<eos> Look, where would you like to go?<eos> I'm a weak woman.<eos> If I meet you tomorrow... will you leave me in peace?<eos> No, you won't, will you?
Been leading me, like a thread, throughout the world.<eos> Marousia?<eos> And the children?<eos> Where are the children?<eos> I'm going to tell everybody that you've stolen the book.<eos> - What?<eos> - I will, you'll see.<eos> - Now stop it!<eos> - Go on, tell everybody!<eos> I will, anyway!
That's being set up.<eos> We'll have you out in a few hours.<eos> -A few hours?<eos> -Why don't you give them what they want?<eos> They'll get it. We want to be sure we get what we want.<eos> Let's get you all out of here safe.<eos> You two boys too.<eos> That's close enough.<eos> Tell the TV to stop saying there's 2 homosexuals in here.<eos> I will.
l missed my watch in the station at Lahore before boarding the train.<eos> How was I to know you were a Mason?<eos> What's this?<eos> God's holy trousers!<eos> Tickets again?<eos> is your name Dravot, sir?<eos> I'm to say that Peachy has gone south for the week.<eos> He's gone south for the week.<eos> Did he say I'd give anything for this?<eos> I won't.
Breakfast?<eos> - What?<eos> - Would you like some breakfast?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> - Thanks. - Right.<eos> I put him up for a night, which lasted a weekend, for three long, dark years.<eos> Oh, that's nice. That's very nice.<eos> - I'm glad.<eos> - Yeah, they do a nice job at that laundry. - You tell 'em.<eos> - Yes, I will.
Well, I...<eos> I expect we shall see our way through somehow.<eos> Don't let me detain you, Miss Lumley, you have a class in a few minutes, I believe.<eos> Senior needlework.<eos> Just ask the Waybourne girl to come in to see me, please.<eos> After luncheon will be convenient.<eos> Yes, Mrs Appleyard.<eos> Oh, and Miss Lumley.<eos> Do your best to forbid any idle and morbid gossip - about this whole wretched business.<eos> - Yes, Mrs Appleyard. I will.
- How much you want for those?<eos> - Forget it.<eos> That's my lucky pair. - Come on.<eos> - I'm not kidding.<eos> They belonged to my Uncle Bob.<eos> - He wore 'em to get out of the navy in World War II.<eos> - We need 'em for Colonel Potter.<eos> - I need them for my freedom.<eos> - We'll get you a little freedom.<eos> - We will?
There now follows... Hello.<eos> I'd like to talk to you tonight about a minority group of people<eos> Who have no mental or physical handicaps And who, through no fault of their own Have never been deprived<eos> This often-ignored minority Is very rarely brought to the attention of the general public.<eos> The average man in the street scarcely gives a second thought To these extremely well-off people.<eos> He quite simply fails to appreciate the pressures That vast quantities of money just do not bring.<eos> Have you at home ever had to cope with this problem?<eos> Or this?<eos> I know it's only human to say "oh, this will never happen to me"<eos> And of course, it won't.
What happened?<eos> Who's coming?<eos> Now we'll start a new life, according to the protocol.<eos> He'll make us line up.<eos> What a stubborn girl, so headstrong!<eos> What could I do?<eos> Don't show that you're afraid. Like we have not seen the robbers before!<eos> Look at him, like some Stepan Razin, the steppe invader.<eos> But we have to greet him properly.<eos> We will.
- Did you see my present for you?<eos> - It was on my pillow.<eos> I'm going to be leaving very early tomorrow.<eos> - Will you take me?<eos> - No, I can't, Anthony.<eos> - Why do you have to go?<eos> - I have to do business.<eos> I could help you.<eos> I know.<eos> Some day you will.
Get another tank!<eos> Angela?<eos> Angela?<eos> Phillip?<eos> Phillip, open the door!<eos> What ideas can I use upstairs... ... toexplainwhereI'vebeen all this time?<eos> Well, what you might do is just... ... walkrightup to himand say , "J.D., I'm sorry for the delay...<eos> ... butmysecretary had an urgent personal problem. "<eos> What happens if he asks what the problem was?<eos> He won't.
Come on. I'll see you soon.<eos> I love you.<eos> Let it go!<eos> You think this'll hold it? It'd better.<eos> We have to cut the elevator cable.<eos> -What's your number? -68.<eos> 47.<eos> Here, Mrs. Ramsay, you'll be all right now.<eos> -Tell my husband I'm all right. -Tell him I'll be all right.<eos> -I will.
You're gonna hear them come through.<eos> They'll probably search the grounds. You just be real quiet until they pass by.<eos> - And I'll come back to get you. - They'll never find me.<eos> They'll never<eos> - They will never find us.<eos> Us?<eos> David, they might find you.<eos> No, no. I can hide. They'll never find either of us.<eos> - But what if they do?<eos> - They won't.

If we had the slightest reason to believe he has any kind of arsenal we'd move in on him.<eos> Besides, Han would never allow guns on the island anyway.<eos> He had a bad experience with them once and he's fearful of assassination.<eos> You can't really blame him.<eos> Any bloody fool can pull a trigger.<eos> I guess I won't need anything.<eos> There's a radio on the island.<eos> We'll be monitoring it on the chance you can get to it.<eos> And then you come?<eos> Someone will.
Navy's the best thing ever happened to me.<eos> I don't want you to fuck me up.<eos> You understand?<eos> - Buddusky?<eos> - I hear you. Do you agree?<eos> I was just trying to show him a good time. Know what I mean?<eos> He can't have a good time. It ain't in him.<eos> - He had a good time in Washington. - All right.<eos> He had a good time in Washington. Think that'll make it any easier to pull his eight years?<eos> It won't.
And for 50 cents!<eos> I never ate anything so good.<eos> I ain't shitting you.<eos> I'm going to have to have another one of these.<eos> I'd like a little more onions.<eos> - Little more?<eos> There's some. - How about some of these?<eos> You got it.<eos> We got to figure out what to do.<eos> And we will. We will.
We're just outside St Jo.<eos> - So what?<eos> - So...<eos> It's a big town.<eos> We can do better than twenties.<eos> Y'all know that one, "Let's have another cup of coffee, "<eos> It's 1 0,30 Sunday morning in St Jo and y'all get to church now, OK?<eos> Here's the news, ln Omaha, President Roosevelt told the nation,<eos> Moze, what if he don't believe you?<eos> He will.
They say you are getting to be too much of a gringo since you've been sheriff.<eos> That you make deals with Chisum.<eos> You don't touch me.<eos> You are dead inside.<eos> - I wish you'd never put on that badge.<eos> - Not now.<eos> Or I won't be here when you get back!<eos> We'll deal with this when it's over.<eos> I hope he gets away.<eos> Well, he won't.
We eat breakfast at 7 am.<eos> Honey, I had a nightmare.<eos> I dreamed I was a maid.<eos> That won't be enough.<eos> Two of them, me and doggy.<eos> Darn it! Too yeasty.<eos> You can let Sonia off the leash.<eos> They like to play together.<eos> - I'm afraid she'll run away.<eos> - She won't.
Everyone Cross used to know in Vienna.<eos> Everyone Cross used to know... that you know.<eos> We're monitoring telephone calls to America, telegrams and radio telegrams.<eos> I want the tapes brought here.<eos> We've got a watch on the embassies, but if Cross doesn't move, he'll be invisible.<eos> He'll move.<eos> He'll try to get his wife out.<eos> He'll need funds and help.<eos> Not if he goes over.<eos> - He won't.
- It's what I'm good at.<eos> - My husband was good at robbing trains.<eos> - Your husband was a fool.<eos> Because he got shot in the back in a whorehouse?<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For him or me?<eos> The boy.<eos> No matter how things turn out... I want to thank you for all that you've done and... if you should change your mind about coming back with me...<eos> - I won't.
Leaves in 45 minutes, Gate 3.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> Kind of tricky, isn't it?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Come over here.<eos> You don't always have to take your gun out.<eos> I'll do anything you want.<eos> Really.<eos> I will.
Shanghai is so big<eos> He does not know Shanghai well organize a search!<eos> We must find him out<eos> We'll settle this when he returns<eos> Who's there?<eos> It's me!<eos> I thought you'd be here<eos> Hiding is useless<eos> Come an discuss it<eos> I won't
I am Jyunai Asada from the Totomi-administration.<eos> I am Itto Ogami.<eos> Master Gemba Sawatari would like to meet you.<eos> He told us to find you.<eos> Am I gonna meet him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Please come with us.<eos> Will he come?<eos> He has to.<eos> If he won't, we...
Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor.<eos> You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going.<eos> If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.<eos> Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon for the rest of your life.<eos> But what about us?<eos> We'll always have Paris.<eos> We didn't have we-- we'd lost it until you came to Casablanca.<eos> We got it back last night.<eos> - When I said I would never leave you.<eos> - And you never will.
Ladies and gentlemen, and Mr. Larrabee.<eos> Frederick!<eos> Mr. Frederick.<eos> What I want to say...<eos> What Howard's trying to says is how much he appreciates your hospitality.<eos> We'll both think of you when we're back in Iowa.<eos> What compelling sentiments.<eos> Did anyone ever tell you that you were very sexy?<eos> Well, actually, no.<eos> They never will.
It's a good way to get sick.<eos> Very, very sick.<eos> That's how I got so sick. Someone called me on the telephone !<eos> What's going on here ?<eos> Who are you ?<eos> My name is Grace Collier and I write for The Staten Island Panorama,<eos> - and I must use the telephone.<eos> - No ! No ! Don't give it to her.<eos> Don't ! She won't use it, Arlene.<eos> She won't.
He has asthma.<eos> He has to stay in this air-conditioned room.<eos> Who are they, Mom?<eos> We're after the coin collection.<eos> Is it yours?<eos> What's the combination?<eos> Tell him, darling.<eos> If they were any good, they could do it the hard way.<eos> Tell him to tell us.<eos> - I won't.
- You won't get a thing out of me.<eos> - I'll wager those were the very words the Queen used to you.<eos> Oh, no, as a matter of fact, she was ready and waiting...<eos> My Lord Cardinal, will you show the Queen to her apartment?<eos> - Gladly.<eos> This way, Your Majesty.<eos> - Wait. What is to happen to Sir Roger?<eos> Nothing, if he signs a simple confession.<eos> - And if he doesn't?<eos> - He will.
I must appraise him of what has happened.<eos> It is my only hope.<eos> They're so strict on security here.<eos> Even I'm searched from top to bottom when I leave.<eos> - Top to bottom?<eos> - Well, almost.<eos> There is in fact only one place I could put a letter where it might avoid detection.<eos> And you could not bring yourself to do that for me?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I will, I will.
Please.<eos> Zira, I've been asked to give you an injection...<eos> No, you can't use that!<eos> We only use those things for killing.<eos> - Killing?<eos> - No, this is not for killing, Cornelius.<eos> This is for relaxing.<eos> It won't harm her.<eos> - Will it harm my baby?<eos> - No. No, it won't.
Jack, you're wrong.<eos> -Good afternoon, Mr. Brumby.<eos> -Jack!<eos> Who is setting you up in this place?<eos> Brumby.<eos> -Is he coming here?<eos> -Don't worry.<eos> He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.<eos> Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?<eos> He won't.
- It's for my new piece.<eos> - Are you coming to the theatre?<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Do you mind?<eos> - No, I'll let you work.<eos> - I have to go, or I'll be late.<eos> - Say, Sylvie.<eos> - Yes,<eos> - Tell me, if someone ends our love or if we have to separate...<eos> We won't, my angel.
Angel's food or devil's food?<eos> Devil's food cake.<eos> And it would ooze into the windows and into the doors and engulf the people.<eos> It'd eat everything in its way.<eos> It was traveling down the coast from Scotland.<eos> Whenever it would come to a town or a village, it would call out.<eos> "Here comes the cake.<eos> BBC sent out... He wants her.<eos> He'll never believe me again.<eos> No one will.
There's lots of ferns growing out there.<eos> Anyway, I've already decided something.<eos> We're going on our own tomorrow.<eos> Why?<eos> - That's best.<eos> - No!<eos> Suppose he wanted to do something, or something happened?<eos> Suppose he tried to...<eos> Suppose he went off and left us?<eos> No, he won't.
He's stuck in the pipe, isn't he?<eos> It's his stomach.<eos> - He's blocking the chocolate!<eos> - What happens now?<eos> The pressure will get him out. It's building up behind the blockage.<eos> I wonder how long it's going to take?<eos> The suspense is terrible.<eos> I hope it'll last.<eos> He'll never get out.<eos> Yes, he will.
What are they doing to me?<eos> What"s happening?<eos> What are they doing...<eos> No!<eos> Stop, please!<eos> We can"t make her tell us why they were escaping.<eos> Your lover, I have to tell you, he is dead.<eos> Don"t worry.<eos> You will tell me.<eos> You will.

But it was with more simple, homespun verses- that McTeagle's unique style first flowered.<eos> "If you could see your way to lending me sixpence, "I could at least buy a newspaper.<eos> That's not much to ask anyone."<eos> One woman who remembers McTeagle as a young friend--<eos> Lassie O'Shea.<eos> McTeagle wrote me two poems- between the months of January and April, 1969.<eos> Could you read us one?<eos> Och, I dinna like to, though.<eos> They were kind of personal...<eos> But I will.
Hey, now, that's a good idea, Mel, using little old ladies for skycaps.<eos> You keep that up.<eos> You're doing a good job.<eos> Mel?<eos> For my sake, be patient with him.<eos> How you can live with that over-aged juvenile delinquent I'll never know.<eos> There's just the two of us.<eos> If I left him, what would I have?<eos> Would you have any more if he decided to leave you?<eos> He won't.
It's an honor, my lord.<eos> Welcome to my inn, sir.<eos> Your new wench. Where is she?<eos> She's only a serving wench, my lord, sir.<eos> Get some of your foul drink and bring her.<eos> Bess!<eos> What can I do for you, my lord?<eos> My girl, you don't want to spend the whole of your life... as a serving wench, do you?<eos> I have no wish to change my trade.<eos> Wishes or not... you will.
My turn!<eos> Why don't you and Spicer play?<eos> Spicer?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Robert would you do something for me?<eos> Would you play for me?<eos> Catherine, your game!<eos> Catherine?<eos> Will you?
That's gonna be a lot of fence.<eos> I was gonna tell the rest of the boys after the funeral.<eos> But I tell you now, just in case you didn't wanna ride back this way.<eos> Here's your pay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, would you tell Dolly to put that Chet was from Illinois on his marker?<eos> Sure.<eos> Chet was proud of that.<eos> Oh, and tell Mary why I'm not there, huh?<eos> I will.
But, Colonel, this is planter's stock. Jamaican rum.<eos> - I paid dear for this.<eos> - And you charge dear for it.<eos> Give us that stuff on the bottom shelf.<eos> Give me the bottle.<eos> Colonel, I know why you want to see us.<eos> You haven't found the fella who told us about your gold shipments.<eos> Who sold you the information about our gold shipments.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> But I will.
- I'm going now.<eos> - Hurry up. Yes, sir.<eos> - Do you need anything else, sir?<eos> - No, nothing.<eos> The later you come back, the better. Yes, sir. - Goodbye.<eos> - Have you finished?<eos> - No, not yet.<eos> Leave that.<eos> - What if she comes back?<eos> - She won't, not until supper time.
I have been working with her.<eos> She saved me once.<eos> This is a great woman!<eos> Men...as many as you want...<eos> But Mrs. Mathilde, never!<eos> We will not discuss about it.<eos> She must disappear and she will.<eos> You won't do it! We have other killers.<eos> If necessary, I will do it.<eos> You won't.
- You're the fatheaded beast.<eos> Quit shouting.<eos> Boy' somebody sure trained 'em.<eos> Which way?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I don't know where we've been and I've just been there.<eos> They can't follow us.<eos> We're safe.<eos> You really think so?<eos> I will if you will.
WHICH OF THESE IS "THE BRAIN"?<eos> - Want my opinion?<eos> - Yes.<eos> They reckon you're the Brain.<eos> I'll give myself up to the police.<eos> Definitely not.<eos> What else can we do?<eos> We'll go to Le Havre, like we said.<eos> We'll never make it.<eos> Oh, you will.
- What you ask is impossible.<eos> - You must make it possible.<eos> You know what your English newspapers are like.<eos> Think of the delight they'd have in dragging you down.<eos> You want me to withdraw the report, and make a speech stating that I believe there are possibilities in the scheme?<eos> Those are my terms.<eos> I will give you any sum of money you want.<eos> My dear Sir Robert, even you are not rich enough to buy back your past.<eos> - I will not do what you ask.<eos> I will not!
- I'm sure you were badly brought up.<eos> - I was.<eos> - I wish I'd brought you up.<eos> - I'm so sorry that you didn't.<eos> - It's too late now, I suppose.<eos> - I'm not so sure.<eos> - Will you ride tomorrow?<eos> - Yes, at ten.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> - Of course, I won't.
Ugliness means nothing.<eos> Won't he have a name?<eos> Macunaima.<eos> Names beginning with M bring misfortune.<eos> Macunaima, hero of our people!<eos> So It was in a place called Tocandeira's Father... Brazil, that was born Macunaima... hero of our people.<eos> As a child, he already did hair-raising things.<eos> - Kiss your sister-in-law.<eos> - He'll spit on you.<eos> No, he won't.
- What's your name?<eos> - Macunaima.<eos> - With an M?<eos> That's misfortune.<eos> Do you know what I want?<eos> To beat up that giant, Wesceslau Pietro Pietra.<eos> - I'll invoke his spirit.<eos> - Please do it.<eos> - Will he feel whatever I do to you?<eos> - He will.
Yeah, but he's right outsi--<eos> He did, huh? .<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Anything else? .<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You tell Harold the bad guy from the parking lot brought his bird back.<eos> - You tell him.<eos> Hear? .<eos> - I will.

I'm not going!<eos> Can't you leave the boy alone? He won't do you harm.<eos> Why can't you leave him where he'll have the chance of a decent life?<eos> You'll bring him back here, my girl. Unless you want to feel my hand on your throat.<eos> Nancy, my dear... we must have that boy brought back.<eos> If he talked, think what would happen to us. Think what would happen to Bill.<eos> It would be the gallows for him.<eos> The drop. You wouldn't want that to happen, would you, my dear?<eos> - She'll go, Fagin. - No, she won't, Fagin!<eos> Yes, she will, Fagin!
- That sounds so far away.<eos> It is. One more thing, we' d like another blood sample.<eos> Oh, yes, of course. What for?<eos> The nurse didn't take enough, so would you drop by and see her?<eos> But I am pregnant, aren't I?<eos> Oh, yes, it's just for blood samp... er, blood sugar.<eos> - But you're pregnant.<eos> - I'll come in on Monday.<eos> - Don't forget the pills.<eos> - No, I won't.
Sensor sweeps reveal no other ships within range, captain.<eos> - Lieutenant Uhura?<eos> - No contact with Starfleet as yet, sir.<eos> Mr. Sulu, change course to 17, mark 4, warp factor 3.<eos> Warp factor 3, sir.<eos> When I take this ship,<eos> I'll have Kirk's head stuffed and hung on his cabin wall.<eos> - They will kill us before we can act. - No.<eos> They wish to question us, learn our strength, our plans.<eos> - They never will.
This man, this groom is a rat!<eos> You don't know who he is, do you?<eos> Too bad. He's an immoral scoundreI.<eos> Thank you for alerting us.<eos> This deplorable example will help us to rally up the masses.<eos> Right.<eos> And I'm going to the police.<eos> You can't! They'll arrest you immediately.<eos> They will be obliged to place you under arrest.<eos> They will.
You didn't see this apartment.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> The woman wasn't home.<eos> You saw the apartment on the third floor.<eos> That's why.<eos> You don't like it.<eos> I do like it, dear.<eos> I'm just waiting for my eyes to clear.<eos> I thought you'd say wow!<eos> I will.

What was that name you used, Luke?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Oh, God, I pray to God you don't hit me anymore.<eos> I'll do anything you say, but I can't take anymore.<eos> -You got your mind right, Luke?<eos> -Yeah mind right.<eos> Oh, I got it right, Boss.<eos> Suppose you was to backslide on us?<eos> Oh, no, I won't, Boss.
If I thought I would get shot, I wouldn't go.<eos> Back as soon as I can.<eos> Here.<eos> Use this till the doctor gets here.<eos> How did this mess get started?<eos> A bunch of men on horseback came flying around the bend and...<eos> What was the idea of diving under those horses?<eos> Diving under those horses?<eos> A man can't shoot good when his horse is jumping, and a horse won't step on a man.<eos> - He won't?
But could you try?<eos> Since I graduated, I feel like I have to always be rude. Do you understand?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> It's like I've been playing a game, but the rules don't make any sense.<eos> They're being made up by all the wrong people. No, I mean no one makes them up, they seem to make themselves up.<eos> I wonder if I could request you to turn that down a little?<eos> Would you like to come in?<eos> I could make you some coffee.<eos> I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.<eos> - We won't.
I don't know what's happening.<eos> You're confused?<eos> Don't be confused.<eos> We're getting married.<eos> I don't see how we can.<eos> We just can.<eos> I have to go now.<eos> Are you serious about this?<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> - You really will?
Or today's a good day.<eos> I haven't said I'll marry you.<eos> I happen to have my birth certificate with me.<eos> Where's yours?<eos> I just don't think it would work.<eos> Why wouldn't it?<eos> - I just don't think it would.<eos> Can we get our blood tests tomorrow?<eos> Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?<eos> Alright, I will.
To preserve the works of Edgar Allan Poe for the world is the work of God, not the devil.<eos> To condemn a man to a living hell is the work of the devil.<eos> And one's soul can only be released if a living soul replaces his in the devil's domain.<eos> Is there no other way to release you?<eos> There is another way.<eos> By fire.<eos> I have the means here.<eos> But in return you must tell me more about the unknown.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
To my shop.<eos> Andy's back and waiting for you.<eos> - Now? - Right now.<eos> He's just passing through.<eos> But we're so late already, and I must pick up my brother at school.<eos> Maybe he could go.<eos> The school's right nearby.<eos> It'd help us out.<eos> - How can you?<eos> Of course I will!
- They?<eos> - Yes, there's another man.<eos> I've seen him, but don't know him.<eos> Who's anyone here?<eos> Let's go and see your father.<eos> Think you can make him listen to reason?<eos> Maybe. If he's still able to.<eos> Certain of your subject's indoctrination?<eos> Never had a failure.<eos> I won't with the watchmaker.
Well, if that's what you want, take it.<eos> I'll give it to you.<eos> I don't want you to give me anything.<eos> I'll stay on as sheriff long enough so I'll have enough money to pay for it.<eos> You'll get along all right wherever you are.<eos> You like the woman you live with.<eos> I wanted that for my son, but...<eos> Please, I've got to get out of here.<eos> Now, our marriage contract includes getting through a party for my father.<eos> And we will.
- Ready to move at short notice?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But I must have approval of the details of your plan.<eos> - That's our business.<eos> - It's our money.<eos> Meet me here tomorrow, same time, up on the roof.<eos> We've got what we wanted.<eos> The operation has begun.<eos> - Begun? My client hasn't approved.<eos> - He will.
Perhaps you know the legend.<eos> It's the story of a young boy Ali Hadjj who was given 3 wishes.<eos> His first wish was for good health, his second for great happiness and the third was for great wealth I suppose.<eos> - It always is with these wish things.<eos> - Not always Sir Harold.<eos> Ali Hadjj considered health and happiness all the riches he required and so he gave his third wish to the people that all who are in Dammuz on this day today should have one wish come true.<eos> Even our guests may have a wish.<eos> What a perfect day to have arrived in Dammuz.<eos> Have you made a wish Mr Shahbandar?<eos> Not yet, but I will.
Very well, sir.<eos> I'll withhold my report for 48 hours. I dare not do more than that.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant.<eos> You won't regret it. I'm sure of that.<eos> What are we going to do about this, sir?<eos> We'll fill it in, make it look as if it's never been touched.<eos> We can manage this on our own, Sir James.<eos> Why don't you wait inside where it's warm.<eos> Thank you, Peter.<eos> Yes, I will.
- Yes.<eos> What happened at the boom?<eos> By that signed declaration we have renounced nationality itself.<eos> Your uniform now gives you no authority over us and no responsibility for us.<eos> - Romantic nonsense.<eos> - We've convinced most people here that there is no connection between ourselves and the gunboats.<eos> - Your presence only endangers us.<eos> - We're at war, Jameson.<eos> They'll kill you.<eos> They will not.
Why, I didn't expect so soon.<eos> It's efficiency.<eos> You're lucky we got a match so quick.<eos> Hop aboard, son.<eos> Up there.<eos> The doctors are waiting.<eos> That's just so you won't fall off.<eos> But there's things we have to talk about.<eos> I mean, my identity...<eos> We will later.
But there's things we have to talk about.<eos> I mean, my identity...<eos> We will later.<eos> Just relax, son.<eos> Everything's going to be just fine.<eos> The thing about doing it on my own.<eos> You see, it's so important... choice.<eos> You've got to change.<eos> We have to talk about it.<eos> We will.
Shh!<eos> Calm down now.<eos> Would you mind waiting outside?<eos> - Sorry, sir.<eos> - Now, answer every question they put to you.<eos> Don't lie.<eos> You've no need. Don't submit to a med--<eos> That is, being so healthy, they've no need for a medical exam.<eos> What if they ask about--<eos> They won't.
Where were you?<eos> Shh! Calm down now.<eos> Would you mind waiting outside?<eos> - Sorry, sir.<eos> - Now, answer every question they put to you.<eos> Don't lie.<eos> You've no need.

Let's escape together.<eos> Come with us, Omiyo.<eos> Genba went to Joshin Temple to force the priest to tell him where Tatewaki and Sasuke were, and then tortured him to death.<eos> The priest is dead?<eos> At long last I know clearly who I am.<eos> At last I understand what I must do.<eos> I must not run.<eos> I cannot run.<eos> Use my men. And please find my son.<eos> I will.
I want that man back.<eos> It ain't my job, Major.<eos> I didn't sign on to go chasing after no homesick soldier boys.<eos> It's mine.<eos> All right, Sergeant, you find him.<eos> Beg your pardon, sir... but what'll they do to Pvt. Hadley when they catch him?<eos> What?<eos> Son, it'd be our good luck if he killed him.<eos> But he won't and the Major will.<eos> Oh, no, Mr. Potts... the Major will not.
You needn't do that.<eos> Nanny will do it for you.<eos> - I'd rather do it myself.<eos> - Making your own bed?<eos> My, what a grown-up boy you are, Master Joey.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Nanny was just going to unpack for you.<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> - But, Joey...<eos> Of course he will, madam.
Fancy, madam, Master Joey can make just about every knot there is.<eos> - I can make a hangman's knot.<eos> I'll show you. - Not now, darling.<eos> We'll have to do something about this room.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I like it just as it is.<eos> We bought you some new things.<eos> We put them in the other room.<eos> We'll bring them in.<eos> No, I will.
I don't think she ever forgave me for that.<eos> I used to think Rose-Ann was having a good time for herself on her bed.<eos> I know better now.<eos> I feel a bit sorry for her sometimes.<eos> - Are you still there, Gordon?<eos> - I'm here.<eos> What do you think of the book?<eos> I never knew you could feel words.<eos> I can't read it any more than an ordinary book.<eos> You will.
Not much shade!<eos> ' they grumbled, as they set out across the scorching sand.<eos> 'We'd be better off in the cool shade of a glass of lager. "'<eos> Make up your mind or I'll hitch a ride alone.<eos> All right. Let's go, daddy-o.<eos> A lube job, please.<eos> Where are the bathrooms? Come on, Mimi.<eos> Hey, kid, how'd you like to own a car like this?<eos> - Sure!<eos> - Well, you never will.
But I want it back.<eos> Yeah, sure, sure... don't worry.<eos> Let's go, Zdenek.<eos> Look, that bricklayer spilled our drinks.<eos> Who cares, let's dance.<eos> I'm not thirsty anyway.<eos> I'll get us new ones. Don't you mind?<eos> I'm going.<eos> Don't let her get away!<eos> - I won't!
She asked me to tell you not to come to San Martin.<eos> You know me.<eos> You want me to believe that a priest would risk his hide to warn me?<eos> Maybe you're not a priest.<eos> Answer me!<eos> You're gonna face Carlos.<eos> - One of you is lying.<eos> - Carlos is lying.<eos> If Carlos is guilty, you won't see him again.<eos> Oh, yes, I will.
Let's see your witnesses!<eos> Joseph!<eos> He cut my branches.<eos> You saw it, no?<eos> You agree?<eos> Perfect!<eos> A servant!<eos> Servants don't count.<eos> We'll see about that, you scoundrel!<eos> Oh, no, we won't!
50 barrels of gunpowder, heh?<eos> About hundred american dollars a piece.<eos> -And we will share?<eos> -Just like brothers.<eos> We will drink to it, amigo.<eos> Amigo, who would have thought the night we got out of jail that we would be here like... a rich man,heh?<eos> You remember, the time with a rope almost around my neck<eos> I said that my luck had changed<eos> We donn't have the money yet.<eos> But we will.
She's seen your face.<eos> Do it for me, Billy.<eos> Then we can both be safe for ever.<eos> See how easy it was, Billy.<eos> She didn't suffer<eos> She didn't feel anything.<eos> She just went to sleep.<eos> Now she's safe with Arthur.<eos> You don't want me to say that any more, do you?<eos> I won't.
There are three men.<eos> He's one of them.<eos> They think I have a quarter of a million dollars that belongs to them. - Go on.<eos> - That's all.<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> Where's the money?<eos> - I don't know. They killed Charles to get it, but he must not have had it with him on the train.<eos> - So they think he left it with you. - But he didn't.<eos> I've looked everywhere, and if I don't find it they're going to kill me.<eos> No, they won't.
Is it over?<eos> Do you think it's over?<eos> You're breaking my hand.<eos> This is monstrous.<eos> This is cruel. It is hurting a child and I will not let anyone... anything hurt a child.<eos> I won't endure this.<eos> It thinks to scare me. It has, and poor Theo, too.<eos> Honestly, it feels like she's breaking my hand.<eos> I will take a lot from this filthy house for his sake... but I will not go along with hurting a child.<eos> No, I will not.
Yes, fine.<eos> She's happy about the arrangement.<eos> We might keep her if she's any good.<eos> - He's a wonderful wit.<eos> - Terribly funny.<eos> - Terribly.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> I'm dying to see him again.<eos> I haven't seen him for ages.<eos> - You won't for some time.
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum Prestidigitonium<eos> Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum Prestidigitoni...<eos> What a way to pack.<eos> Well...<eos> Now, just a minute, boy.<eos> How else would you get all this stuff into one suitcase, I'd like to know.<eos> - But I think it's wonderful.<eos> - Yes, it is, rather.<eos> Now, don't you get any foolish ideas that magic will solve all your problems.<eos> Because it won't!
What's the idea of flinging your evil spells all over the place?<eos> Lend me a hand, boy.<eos> Well, what have you got to say for yourself?<eos> You call washing dishes and sweeping floors a work of evil?<eos> I'll decide what's right and wrong around here.<eos> Besides, that's the Wart's job, one of his duties.<eos> Look here, boy. If you want to make that trip to London, you'd better toe the mark.<eos> You old goat!<eos> If I ever catch you in my kitchen again, I'll...<eos> Madam, you won't.
I think it's better if you go on without me.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - Ichi.<eos> - What?<eos> I want you to come to Edo and meet my parents.<eos> I appreciate the thought, but you need to get home safely as quickly as possible, Mitsu.<eos> - Can you understand that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Will you come visit me sometime?<eos> Yes, I will.
And you're wrong in your assessment.<eos> This is about more than you and me.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Have you ever played chess, Derek?<eos> The game of chess involves two very powerful strategic players.<eos> They share the same battlefield, employ many agents.<eos> But none of them are as important as the pawn.<eos> You see, the pawn is the most important tool of any strategist.<eos> This is a game which you have yet to comprehend, Derek.<eos> But you will.
I didn't come to be a messenger.<eos> You're here to obey orders!<eos> Phylon, the message you carry today will buy centuries of freedom for Greece.<eos> Tell the Spartans we are staying here obedient to their word.<eos> - Ellas, you must hurry.<eos> - Ellas.<eos> Ellas.<eos> Tell my wife to take care of our son.<eos> Tell her that I am thinking of them both.<eos> I will, Leonidas.
How much I would like to see her smile.<eos> Put your notes in order... And go to bed.<eos> Father, I want to sleep in the sea tonight.<eos> It's not good for you to be in the water all the time.<eos> It might be bad for your lungs.<eos> Olsen, lchthyander has left for town.<eos> He doesn't know anyone but you there.<eos> Try to find him!<eos> All right.<eos> I will.
Cheer up, milord.<eos> We pay no rent.<eos> Mother Nature sets the table for us.<eos> And, fortunately, we have plenty of water.<eos> That's very fortunate, I must say.<eos> - Very fortunate.<eos> - My father will never trust another Indian.<eos> But Thalcave's different.<eos> He said, "I bring help".<eos> - And he will.
- It is their payment, colonel.<eos> - Payment.<eos> Truly.<eos> Are not British soldiers paid?<eos> - They don't go home when being paid.<eos> - They are not free to.<eos> Well, there's another lot you've seen the last of.<eos> They'll come back.<eos> He says they'll come back.<eos> Will they?
- You've taught her so much this week.<eos> - Not enough.<eos> Obedience isn't enough.<eos> Well... she learned two nouns this morning.<eos> - But not...?<eos> - No.<eos> Not that they mean things.<eos> It's still a finger game to her.<eos> No meaning.<eos> But she will.
Oh, Mr Shayne.<eos> What a pleasant surprise.<eos> Erm, are you stopping at the same motel we are?<eos> Don't press your luck.<eos> Kiss his feet! Did you drive up with anyone?<eos> Yes, a plucked chicken.<eos> Oh. Maybe the four of us can get together later for a drink.<eos> Oh, honey. You're blowing the whole thing.<eos> - Hang up the phone.<eos> - I will not.
- You're not going to stay here.<eos> I got a roof over my head, a cot, a stove...<eos> But you've got a beautiful house in Kahala, and a family.<eos> Let's get this over with.<eos> All the time I was overseas, I got a letter from my folks every week reminding me of my beautiful future in my dad's pineapple business.<eos> And the more they reminded me, the more I knew I couldn't come back with my life laid out for me.<eos> It's too easy to fall into that setup.<eos> I got to do this myself.<eos> - Can't you tell them that?<eos> - I will!
No!<eos> Tell your lord, the Cid, that we seek neither his favor nor his help. Nor can he expect anything from us.<eos> Now go.<eos> Who has done more for you and Spain?<eos> Go!<eos> Now you are also King of Valencia.<eos> I am king of nothing.<eos> No king at all!<eos> - I will make myself a king!<eos> - I will!
Do what he says, come on, upstairs.<eos> Do you gentlemen care for a drink?<eos> - None for me.<eos> Let's play.<eos> - By all means.<eos> Thought we came here to play pool?<eos> I don't play pool, I play billiards.<eos> It's my house, my game.<eos> You don't have to play if you don't want to.<eos> - We won't.
I don't know what's come over him.<eos> I'm terribly sorry.<eos> He's never acted this way before.<eos> Never mind. Never mind.<eos> Please, just go away.<eos> You've done enough.<eos> Please? Oh.<eos> Oh, I say. Here, take mine.<eos> Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live?<eos> I will.

Get out of here!<eos> It ain't playin' anymore!<eos> Can't any of you get that?<eos> - But the gang...<eos> - You're a girl! Be a girl and beat it!<eos> Come on, Chino!<eos> Get me, too!<eos> I'm callin' for you, Chino!<eos> There's nobody here but me. Come on!<eos> Please, will you?
Hey, Ushitora, you see this?<eos> I'll be keeping her!<eos> Ask the horny old sake brewer what he says to that!<eos> That was amusing.<eos> Mommy!<eos> Where's my mommy?<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Don't you want to look?<eos> I can't see her!<eos> You will soon.
For Madeline's safety.<eos> It was probably the trembling of the house which caused that chandelier to fall.<eos> - Do you really think so?<eos> - Have you a better explanation?<eos> While I was riding here, I noticed a singular lack of vegetation in the area.<eos> Is there something wrong with the soil?<eos> The soil...<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Roderick, please.<eos> As you will.
That's exactly what I mean.<eos> Aztec treasure.<eos> Have you found some? Would to God we had!<eos> I would not be sitting here.<eos> I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.<eos> Then tell me this - how come Calvera keeps hangin' around here?<eos> Calvera...<eos> We've seen the end of him.<eos> He'll be gone in the morning.<eos> No, he will not.
I know that!<eos> like you're the only one that knows what's going on. No wonder we don't fit in here.<eos> You act so above everyone.<eos> You want to fit in with people like Phyllis... who's afraid to do anything unless it's approved... by a military committee or Dylan... who's afraid his sperm count'll drop... if he actually used his brain for 5 minutes?<eos> They're our neighbors.<eos> You wanted to move here, honey.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I thought it was a good place to settle in... to start a family.<eos> It is.<eos> And we will.
I'm thirsty.<eos> Give me some water.<eos> Now, come.<eos> Come where we can talk.<eos> Leave me alone Pinto, for the love of God.<eos> If it's an order I'll go, but I don't want to.<eos> I want to be good.<eos> Let me be good, Pinto.<eos> Stop Pinto, I won't go.<eos> I won't.
But, faith, I have need for it now.<eos> Tomorrow at dawn I've got to go to Glencove to bring back a bell for the chapel.<eos> I'll have to round up the horse, now, before she runs all over the mountainside.<eos> I'll be glad to give you a hand.<eos> I was just going to ask you to go the rounds of the manor house and try all the doors and the windows.<eos> Right so, but after that, I think I'll go down to the Rathcullen Arms and see about a room.<eos> Now, why would you be doin' that?<eos> I don't like to take hospitality under false pretenses, and besides, two weeks from today, you must leave here.<eos> - I think your daughter should know.<eos> - She will, she will.
With the interesting result that the background level of radiation... in this room is nine times what it was a year ago.<eos> Julian.<eos> Don't you know that?<eos> Nine times!<eos> We're all doomed, you know.<eos> The whole silly, drunken, pathetic lot of us.<eos> Doomed by the air we're about to breathe.<eos> We haven't got a chance!<eos> Stop it! I won't have it, Julian!<eos> I won't.
- We've come a long way.<eos> - We got a long way to go.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> And perhaps not.<eos> We now know that at the peak of terror...<eos> The Tingler is a solid mass extending from the coccyx to the cervicals.<eos> If one could stand the pain without screaming... or otherwise releasing their tension until they died... an autopsy would give us a Tingler we could work with.<eos> The advancement of human knowledge is fine, but dying for it...<eos> If that's your attitude... we'll have to find someone else who's willing to die for science.<eos> And eventually we will.
They will be all right in a couple of days.<eos> I know how to care for them.<eos> During the night, I spat up something strange.<eos> I felt like something in my chest was broken.<eos> Get that well too.<eos> Drink your coffee.<eos> I'll get you something to eat.<eos> And...<eos> And bring me the papers from the time I was away.<eos> I will.
- Would you tell me something?<eos> - If I can, sir.<eos> - Am I a damn fool, too? - Sir?<eos> Mr Bledsoe seems to think I am, and I have a great respect for his opinion.<eos> Maybe you have to be, Captain, to do something like this.<eos> You nailed that Momo with a bow shot.<eos> Why not the Akikaze?<eos> The Akikaze never misses, Mueller.<eos> Never.<eos> Well, he will this time, sir.
Am I or am I not right when I'm saying you listen too much to Adelaide?<eos> That isn't true!<eos> I've always been honest with you.<eos> The same here.<eos> You must believe me!<eos> That's not true!<eos> I'm telling you!<eos> Listen, I don't want to stay here!<eos> Tell me, tell me why?<eos> I won't.
No.<eos> A woman will point the way.<eos> - What will she look like?<eos> - You will know her when you see her.<eos> - When will that be?<eos> - Soon enough.<eos> Will she love me or hate me?<eos> Love and hate are horns on the same goat.<eos> What woman would ever look at a slave?<eos> This one will.
Perhaps you'd like to share my lunch with me.<eos> My friend couldn't stay, and I have plenty of food.<eos> I have chicken and salad and some rolls.<eos> - Oh, just a roll and some coffee will do. - All right.<eos> - Won't you sit down? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I was just wondering if there's much to be done.<eos> - Everything looks so wonderful.<eos> - Not much.<eos> Do you think you'll finish today, or will you have to come back?<eos> Hmm, probably will.
I said, it's a good idea if it works it's gonna work, 'cause it's gotta Work it's gotta work, 'cause I said so<eos> If it don't work, it ain't that kid's fault<eos> I never saw anybody work so hard in my life.<eos> Let's go, Pete.<eos> Now, Leonard!<eos> Good luck, Adam<eos> Do you know the principle of the internal combustion engine?<eos> No, I'm afraid not.<eos> Will, I'll never be able to<eos> Sure you will.
Well, whatever for?<eos> Not tomorrow, no.<eos> Let me check.<eos> Would Thursday do? Good.<eos> The Park Lane Hotel at 1 :00?<eos> It was odd to think that during the war... we could be so totally at peace.<eos> There were nights when I wished those sirens... would never end.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I always will.
But what good will that do you to go?<eos> - If Hamar finds...<eos> - I will not go, Mabuna will go.<eos> - What?<eos> - Why not?<eos> With Pharaoh dead, let Hamar learn what he can.<eos> - Because then I shall rule in Egypt.<eos> - But...<eos> Mabuna will not fail.<eos> Will you, Mabuna?
Buy you a drink?<eos> - My pleasure.<eos> Gus.<eos> Hear you're riding to Butte tonight.<eos> Yes.<eos> After I leave, set 'em up for the boys.<eos> Long as it lasts.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Hope you'll be heading back here soon.<eos> I will, one of these days.
Why don't they get me a dresser?<eos> They could afford a dozen.<eos> - Do you want me to talk to Cook?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Tell him to stop that understudy hovering there like a vulture.<eos> - If you talked to Mr Dodd...<eos> - You talk to him.<eos> Tell him to keep that guy out front.<eos> Get me some new tissue.<eos> I will, right after rehearsal.
Did he get away?<eos> No.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Tony, are you still there?<eos> - Margot.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Now, listen very carefully.<eos> Yes, I'm listening.<eos> Don't touch anything. I'll be with you right away.<eos> No. No, I won't.
Don't think it hasn't happened to anybody else.<eos> All of us.<eos> You just didn't understand it. There's only one thing in her head. That man out there.<eos> Nothing else.<eos> Now you know.<eos> - Why didn't you kill me?<eos> - I need you.<eos> You don't need anybody, Hooker.<eos> You don't need any of us.<eos> I will.
One thing, you don't have to worry about me.<eos> - I'll try not to.<eos> - Because it's being taken care of.<eos> - What is?<eos> - Me, her, all of you.<eos> They're up there in those hills, hundreds of them.<eos> They came to the door of the mine and stood there and looked at me.<eos> You know why they didn't kill me?<eos> Because they couldn't come up with a worse way to do it.<eos> But they will for you and her and that scum.
Don't snigger!<eos> - Hey, children!<eos> - He started it!<eos> Be nice now.<eos> If you want to fight, go behind the compost so we don't see.<eos> Don't be silly now!<eos> Take that, Pelle...<eos> You take that...<eos> No, don't take that...<eos> Nix will.
Oh, I am.<eos> You'll say that much to Gwen, won't you?<eos> That you're sorry.<eos> Then Harold won't have to go.<eos> No, Harold!<eos> Please!<eos> I'll go get Gwen.<eos> Mother will tell her she's sorry.<eos> You will, won't you?<eos> Yes, she will!
-You are Apache.<eos> Now, hear me, pony-soldiers are near.<eos> Soon will be fought remembered fight.<eos> They will come here first.<eos> -You will not go with them, White man.<eos> -l will not.<eos> Leader of pony-soldiers will question you.<eos> You will say you have seen Apache trailing to the west.<eos> This I won't do.<eos> -You will not?

– The strings broke.<eos> I must go back to earth for new ones.<eos> Ha, sly fox!<eos> Just arrived and want to go back already?<eos> First marry one of my daughters.<eos> See how many I have?<eos> Then I'll let you go for new strings, if you wish.<eos> Choose the one you like best.<eos> Tell father you will marry me.<eos> But I won't!
I'm not that young anymore.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> I feel we're doing wrong.<eos> I've often talked to Father about this.<eos> Should you have the chance, please get married, anytime you want.<eos> I mean it.<eos> It pains us that you won't remary.<eos> All right.<eos> If I have the chance -<eos> You certainly will.
No, say "I swear".<eos> I swear.<eos> I swear too.<eos> Cross my heart and hope to die.<eos> Bravo!<eos> The police are here.<eos> Tell me where the crosses are.<eos> Tell me, you stubborn little brat.<eos> Tell me where they are.<eos> I won't.
For 20 years I've been hauling Honolulu's garbage out to sea.<eos> My reputation, right down the drain.<eos> Go down the drain with it.<eos> It's like I was stabbed right through the heart.<eos> You maybe will be.<eos> You must keep quiet.<eos> Don't waste time.<eos> Call the bouncers.<eos> I want to fight.<eos> All right, I will.
What happened with the King?<eos> Nothing.<eos> The King wanted...<eos> - And you didn't.<eos> So?<eos> - I slapped him.<eos> - You didn't!<eos> - I did.<eos> - But if Monsieur Lebel finds me...<eos> - He won't.
But I had to, after you left.<eos> It's all for the best. All for the best.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> I don't know.<eos> But something's gone.<eos> Gone forever.<eos> Nothing's gone, it only changes.<eos> I still love you.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> You always will.
Run after him!<eos> Go on! Get a policeman! Get two policemen!<eos> When are you gonna stop tagging after me?<eos> When I want to.<eos> Well, why don't you go play with girls?<eos> Why can't I play with you?<eos> I don't want you to, that's why.<eos> Oh! Barnaby Fulton, I don't like you.<eos> Then go away.<eos> I will not.
Who do you think you are, ordering me about?<eos> I'm the captain, and you ain't going.<eos> You'd only be in my way.<eos> I suppose I was in your way going down the rapids.<eos> Then what you said back there was a lie, about how you couldn't have done it alone and how you'd lost your heart and... everything.<eos> You liar!<eos> Oh, Charlie, we're having our first quarrel.<eos> Oh, Rosie, it's only that I just can't bear the thought of...<eos> What I mean is, suppose something should happen...<eos> - not that anything will, but...
- Come along.<eos> That giant looks as though he had the strength of a Cretan bull.<eos> - Do you think you can down him?<eos> - I'll squeeze the seeds out of him.<eos> Wait.<eos> We're being followed.<eos> - I don't hear anyone.<eos> - Three times I have heard. They stop when we do.<eos> Go on to the house.<eos> - But what will...?
- Getting on fine.<eos> - I want to see her, Mark.<eos> - Do you think she wants to see you?<eos> I got something important to see her about, and then I'll clear out.<eos> I'm afraid I can't tell you that.<eos> - What do you mean, you can't tell me?<eos> - All right, then.<eos> Won't tell you.<eos> - You want a steak, Marshal?<eos> - Why won't you?
She's not coy or cute or corny.<eos> She's a good guy.<eos> I'm glad she's on my side.<eos> She speaks her mind and she knows what she wants."<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> But let me add I also know what I don't want, and I don't want to be rushed.<eos> When you've made up your mind, stop by.<eos> Uh, but not before noon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will.
I will.<eos> Your phone's ringing.<eos> Oh, hello, Brub.<eos> Yeah, well, I can imagine a reunion under more pleasant circumstances.<eos> I just talked to Sylvia.<eos> That's my wife.<eos> She wants you to come to dinner tomorrow night.<eos> That's swell.<eos> And she said to bring someone, if you like.<eos> Well, maybe I will.
Phillip, you're mad!<eos> Thirsting for the coolness of your lips.<eos> You can have the phone now.<eos> No, Phillip, no.<eos> We must be strong.<eos> You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards.<eos> Furthermore, you can have the phone now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Suddenly I find myself terribly afraid of losing you.<eos> You won't.
Madame may be watching.<eos> Will going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark do it?<eos> I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night.<eos> Why don't you?<eos> I'm writing a script... and I'm gonna finish it no matter what.<eos> It is just that I am greatly worried about Madame.<eos> Sure, you are.<eos> And we're not helping her any... feeding her lies and more lies, getting herself ready for a picture.<eos> What happens when she finds out?<eos> She never will.
There are other lawyers.<eos> I'll get in touch with Bill Cantwell.<eos> He's as good as Ackerman.<eos> It won't help.<eos> It's no different than it was.<eos> You felt all right this afternoon.<eos> I didn't realise how serious it was, but now I know.<eos> I thought because Dad was innocent nothing could happen to him,<eos> - but it will.<eos> - It won't.
What an inconvenient hour to land!<eos> Now, you will be careful to get the details right?<eos> - They are most important.<eos> - Of course.<eos> You will have a closed carriage at the corner of McDougal Street tomorrow evening as soon as it gets dark.<eos> - Tomorrow night at 9:00.<eos> - Yes, at 9:00.<eos> Oh, here they are!<eos> - Now, tell her everything.<eos> - I will.
- Where is she?<eos> She's upstairs with Austin.<eos> He's out of mood.<eos> You'd better leave.<eos> - I'll tell her everything.<eos> - I want to tell her myself.<eos> - I'll wait until he's gone to bed.<eos> - No, please go.<eos> - If Austin should see you...<eos> - He won't.
A hundred times I wanted to tell you, tell somebody. I...<eos> I liked that Greek...<eos> I'd do anything for him.<eos> If I could I'd change him for me right now.<eos> I think you would.<eos> Guys make mistakes but every one we make, a stack of chips goes with it.<eos> We make a mistake and some guy don't walk away!<eos> For evermore he don't walk away.<eos> I guess all we can do is just take it and hope we don't make the same mistake again.<eos> I won't.
Would you let me take care of him?<eos> I mean, take him home just for a while. He'd be very happy, he'd have everything he wants.<eos> You could see him whenever you like.<eos> Please let me, just for a little while. You have all this work.<eos> Why not, Belinda?<eos> I only want to help you, can't you understand?<eos> Just sign here. Just make a cross.<eos> If you don't give him to me, they'll come and take him. Belinda, listen, please!<eos> Let me take him.<eos> I won't....
We'll bury him.<eos> Move!<eos> Matt, I told you to get away.<eos> You might have got hurt.<eos> He went for his gun first, but you seemed to know--<eos> Next time, do what I say.<eos> - How'd you know he was gonna draw?<eos> - By watching his eyes.<eos> - Remember that.<eos> - I will.
- I'm gonna--<eos> - What are you gonna?<eos> It's my wife.<eos> She--<eos> She always wanted a little pair of red shoes.<eos> I kind of figured I'd get them for her.<eos> Is that such a fool idea, Mr. Dunson?<eos> It's a good idea, Dan.<eos> I'd do it.<eos> I will.
Ljubov was right, after all.<eos> - Aha, Ljubov-<eos> - Ljubov is always right.<eos> We know. - Do you really think so?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, well, well. Take it away. Take it away.<eos> Well, you see, my dear, Mr. Lermontov is a very busy man.<eos> Now, why don't you go and wait over there with the others?<eos> - Ivan, are you ready?<eos> Yes, I will.
I am going to give them this house to make a school and a hospital for the people.<eos> You know nobody here wants a school... and I'm sure they don't want a hospital!<eos> How do they know what they want until they try?<eos> The people have all kind of diseases.<eos> - They have ringworm.<eos> - They don't mind having ringworm.<eos> Then they ought to mind.<eos> And it will all be free.<eos> It was free last time, and nobody came.<eos> They will this time.
Maybe you did it, maybe you didn't.<eos> Sam says you didn't kill her... and I've known Sam a long time.<eos> I've got a lot of faith in Sam.<eos> That's why I took this job.<eos> If I had thought you were a professional killer... I wouldn't have any part of it.<eos> But the way it is now, is this:<eos> You'll look older, but you'll always feel 10 years younger.<eos> And you're through with me and I'm through with you.<eos> The artist in me wishes I could see what a nice job I've done.<eos> But I never will.
And in the white winter.<eos> Danilushka.<eos> Katenka.<eos> Give me one of your flowers.<eos> Choose the one you like.<eos> Look, you've chosen the best one!<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> By Serpent Hill.<eos> Don't lose it.<eos> I won't.
We would have made it, if you didn't stop to pick up your gent.<eos> We might be able to chase it.<eos> I can get a bus back to Ridgeville tomorrow.<eos> Maybe I won't get a bus back to Ridgeville.<eos> Maybe I'll go someplace else.<eos> Maybe in another direction.<eos> Chicago or further west, maybe.<eos> - Have you ever been out West before? - Yeah.<eos> I've never.<eos> But maybe I will.
Here she comes...<eos> The boat's comin'!<eos> Here she comes!<eos> There's Nicodemus...<eos> The horses must be ready.<eos> But I still can't understand why we're leaving. You've got the contracts.<eos> We're leaving because we gotta stay away from Bender until the wheat's harvested.<eos> If he can't get his hands on that contract, he won't burn the wheat-- It won't do him any good.<eos> What if someone sees us taking our bags out?<eos> They won't.
And then I got to thinking what cemeteries are for.<eos> They're to put dead people in.<eos> I guess that was the first time I ever thought about Phyllis that way.<eos> Dead, I mean. And how it would be if she were dead.<eos> I saw Lola three or four times that week.<eos> One night we went up into the hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.<eos> I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, but it was only with her that... I could relax and let go a little.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Not gonna tell me, huh?<eos> Of course I will, Walter.
Andreas.<eos> You.<eos> You have no power over me.<eos> That was ended many years ago.<eos> I'm no longer your slave.<eos> Dr. Ainsley has cleansed me of all the evil you forced upon me.<eos> You can't bring it back.<eos> You can't!<eos> I won't let you!<eos> I won't!
By whom?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Spat fire at me.<eos> My good sir, in spite of Mr. Holmes' theories to the contrary things have been seen and heard on those marshes that cannot be explained away by the use of logic.<eos> If I were you I'd keep away from them.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> Holmes found...<eos> Penrose, for the first time in my long pursuit of crime, I confess that I find myself baffled.<eos> I'm a detective I need tangible clues and up to now I admit I found none.<eos> And you won't.
You've left yourself wide open. Not at all. You'll score 500 points at most... and you're behind by 1 ,000.<eos> - Now what do you have to say?<eos> - I didn't plan on that.<eos> Who doesn't plan for everything sees his plans go awry.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Just a figure of speech.<eos> At any rate, we're now tied.<eos> Sir Bruce...<eos> I have a big favor to ask you, and you may not refuse.<eos> Then of course I will not.
Women and children, line up.<eos> Life vests will be handed out on the steps.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the ship's crew has ordered a lifeboat drill.<eos> Please put on your life jackets and go up on deck.<eos> Please follow the orders of the crew members immediately.<eos> And please hurry.<eos> - Is it really just a lifeboat drill?<eos> - Please get a life jacket immediately.<eos> - Won't you tell me the truth?<eos> - Yes, I will.
As for you, you'd forget me.<eos> That I never will, sir.<eos> You know that.<eos> I see the necessity of going, but it's like looking on the necessity of death.<eos> Where do you see that necessity?<eos> - In your bride.<eos> - What bride?<eos> I have no bride.<eos> - But you will have.<eos> - Yes, I will.
- I'll have to think it over.<eos> Anyway, don't you think that I might come here in the holidays... and sort of take care of you?<eos> - What would Mother say?<eos> - Jill?<eos> She wouldn't mind.<eos> - She loves to get rid of me.<eos> - Kitty!<eos> You'll write to me, won't you?<eos> - Kitty!<eos> - Will you?
Tom Tom!<eos> - Tom Tom!<eos> - Bo Peep! Stan and Ollie found little Elmer, alive!<eos> Where?<eos> In Barnaby´s cellar.<eos> I knew he had something to do with this!<eos> Oh if I ever get my hands on him.<eos> Come on. We'll find our way out of here.<eos> Oh Tom Tom, we'll never find our way out of here!<eos> Oh yes we will!
In honoring your great men, we elevate ourselves.<eos> The Lord Treasurer is waiting, Your Majesty.<eos> I can't see him.<eos> He says it's very urgent.<eos> -Tell him I don't want to see him.<eos> -Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> Well, Countess?<eos> The Queen can't see you, Your Excellency.<eos> You mean she won't.<eos> She won't, Your Excellency.
I just assumed there'd be specific strategies in case of capture.<eos> That's not what it's about.<eos> Sliding means improvising.<eos> Great.<eos> Do doubles share the same personality traits?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Sometimes not.<eos> But let's say this one does think like you.<eos> How would you be fooled into letting two intruders escape?<eos> I wouldn't.
- Where?<eos> She took a train.<eos> - No, she's too smart for that.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> She just meant to throw them off.<eos> She said she wanted to go public.<eos> The Baltimore Guardian is only a couple of blocks down from the train station.<eos> They didn't believe my story.<eos> Not a word of it.<eos> Who in their right mind would?
A rifle, a handgun, maybe a pair of shoes... taken off a dead truck driver.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I'm Leland Stottlemeyer.<eos> How's your wife?<eos> My wife is gonna be fine.<eos> The doctors saved her life.<eos> You should call them and thank them, because they saved yours too.<eos> You might wanna let the lieutenant hold that for you.<eos> Are you afraid I'll use it?<eos> I would.
Kosh, the real Kosh, wasn't like this.<eos> I think, on some level, he cared about us.<eos> About me.<eos> But with you, it's as if I'm being used... and thrown away when I'm not needed anymore.<eos> Damn it, I have earned some respect!<eos> And I have earned some answers.<eos> Respect.<eos> From whom?<eos> Would you know my thoughts?<eos> Would you?
Then let me help him.<eos> Make your punches count, Quinn.<eos> Don't just throw wildly.<eos> Come on, concentrate on what you're doing.<eos> Take aim.<eos> That's it, let it go.<eos> Let it all go.<eos> He wouldn't help me.<eos> I asked him to come to school and get 'em off my back.<eos> He wouldn't.
- The fantasy of a killer.<eos> She's completely non-responsive.<eos> We did a tox screen and found traces of morphine and scopolamine.<eos> - Twilite Sleep.<eos> - The dental anaesthetic?<eos> A painkiller cocktail.<eos> It's also for women in labour.<eos> - Would that account for her condition?<eos> - No,<eos> What would?
-Hercules.<eos> He caught us by surprise, Iolaus.<eos> I thought I was going to die.<eos> Ambushing people, attacking women... That's not the Hercules I know.<eos> He must have gone crazy or something.<eos> You'd know that he had if you saw what he did to Estrogon.<eos> Estrogon shouldn't have been there with you. I should have.<eos> But then, Hercules would have killed you.<eos> -You expect me to run away?<eos> -Other men would.
- And you didn't come in?<eos> Well, I... I figured you were busy.<eos> Please, you have to come in and see what I did.<eos> I have a table with your name on it, for people who can't afford a meal.<eos> Of course.<eos> After what you did.<eos> What I did?<eos> I made a promise and I kept it, period.<eos> - Most people would do the same.<eos> - Nobody would!
No crime in that, is there?<eos> - Be quiet.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Stand still!<eos> - You stand still, Tom!<eos> - I want my mum!<eos> - I want mum!<eos> - Let's just get you cleaned up first.<eos> You wouldn't want her to see you all messed up like this, would you?<eos> Yes I would!
Can you see the lesions on your face in this mirror from three feet away?<eos> Answering truthfully.<eos> At the time I was fired, the lesions were much bigger.<eos> Answer my question, please.<eos> No, I can't really see them.<eos> No more questions.<eos> We'll take a break now.<eos> We'll reconvene in the morning.<eos> I hate this case.<eos> - I'd like five minutes in redirect.
Religious purposes.<eos> You've been getting dressed for three hours and still look like a bloated citrus fruit.<eos> Sweetie, it's a very healing colour, a very positive colour.<eos> I'm getting rid of all my other clothes.<eos> Is that really the best you could come up with? Oh God!<eos> Well, only this and the dreaded kaftan fitted.<eos> Well, I say fitted. It was filled to capacity.<eos> I mean, all my clothes have got stretchmarks, darling.<eos> Honestly, you wouldn't believe how much I weigh.<eos> - I would.
You're good.<eos> I respect that.<eos> Am I supposed to respect this?<eos> This... is just business.<eos> Nothing personal.<eos> A means to an end.<eos> So you're bluffing the police.<eos> No.<eos> We'll do whatever's necessary.<eos> You would too in my place, wouldn't you?

RIGHT-GOT IT- BEAUTIFUL DAY.<eos> WE HARDLY HAVE ANY CONVERSATION THESE DAYS.<eos> EVEN WHEN WE MAKE LOVE YOU RARELY SPEAK TO ME.<eos> ESPECIALLY WHEN WE MAKE LOVE YOU RARELY SPEAK TO ME.<eos> YOU THINK DOING TWO THINGS AT ONCE IS A FORMULA FOR SUCCESS.<eos> IT'S JUST THAT- AT TIMES LIKE THAT A WOMAN LIKES A LITTLE CONFIRMATION THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY SOMEBODY THERE.<eos> IT'S THAT MEMORABLE, IS IT?<eos> I'LL TELL YOU WHY I DON'T LIKE CHATTING WHEN I'M MAKING LOVE TO YOU.<eos> BECAUSE THE LAST TIME, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THINGS, YOU SAID TO ME, "ONSLOW, IF I'D HAVE DIED IN CHILDBIRTH,<eos> WELL, WOULD YOU?
There we are!<eos> You know who she is?<eos> Your grandma would.
Hey, Ed. You mean to tell me her nipples are hard as sapphires, she's been eating like two horses, her breasts are growin' by leaps and bounds, and she's not pregnant? !<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Absolutely. - How can this be?<eos> Extremely unusual.<eos> But apparently her body has convinced itself that it's pregnant... with all the physical manifestations of pregnancy.<eos> And yet, the fact is, her blood test indicates that she is not pregnant. And the results, I'm afraid, are indisputable.<eos> There is, however, no reason to assume that this means that next time you won't actually be pregnant.<eos> It's for the best anyway.<eos> I wouldn't wanna bring a baby into the world when her daddy's not sure he loves her momma. Just cos her momma is married!<eos> Would you?
- Resume.<eos> Your knowledge of our systems and procedures is very impressive.<eos> Sir.<eos> I would like to make one suggestion, sir.<eos> A suggestion?<eos> When I served aboard the Pagh, the hardest part for me was recognizing and adapting to the demands of the crew.<eos> They needed an iron hand.<eos> It must be very difficult to work with a crew that is... so different.<eos> I would be happy to guide you in that regard, if it would help.<eos> No, Commander, it wouldn't.
You have a wonderful, giant redwood tree of a pencil.<eos> - She said it.<eos> - Let him do this.<eos> The woman knows.<eos> What's happening?<eos> It's an auditory monitor of your scrotal activity.<eos> Oh, I thought maybe you were lonely.<eos> Would you like to listen to your testicles?<eos> - Who wouldn't?<eos> - I would.
The Grand Grimoire.<eos> Always witches have lusted for it.<eos> And now here I find a page. One lone page.<eos> 'Twas last held by a Boston church. The West End Church.<eos> I had urged them to third the book, thus thirding the chance of a witch thieving it. But the pages were to be kept on hallowed ground, not scattered about the landside like... where's the warlock?<eos> He's fled.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> If thing is so bitchin' to witches, why would he leave a page?<eos> Even just a page.<eos> He would not.
He's working now, as a matter of fact. He's in Atlanta with the Democratic National Committee.<eos> He says he's got a king hell of a story about a power struggle.<eos> What happens when his writing's finished? Let me put it this way.<eos> I have a 19-year-old daughter, and if I saw Hank coming up the path on a Saturday night,<eos> I'd pray to God he was a process server.<eos> So women aren't his only problem? No. There's also gambling.<eos> Does it affect his work?<eos> It only affects the accounting department. I mean, he has to, uh, draw advances on his salary.<eos> So, if we told you that we think he might have, uh, blackmailed Pierce, that wouldn't surprised you?<eos> Yeah, it would.
You want to try a decongestant.<eos> Hell hath no fury like a woman's horn.<eos> The trouble with wearing tights is your skin can't breathe.<eos> I know a funny joke about stockings.<eos> - Go on, then.<eos> - No, it's dirty.<eos> - I don't like dirty jokes.<eos> - This is filthy.<eos> - You're gonna tell it though.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
Faster!<eos> Come on, Chrissie!<eos> Connor, you're back!<eos> It's a miracle!<eos> Look at them:<eos> you'd think they were married.<eos> Tomorrow I would have gone and find you.<eos> How would you been doing that?<eos> I would fly like a bird and I would ask for help for the trip.<eos> You would, eh?
- The shift seems radical.<eos> It's triple-checked.<eos> These are typical brain scans from our subjects.<eos> It targets only certain areas of the brain.<eos> Air and vital functions: Breathing, heart rate.<eos> Looks like somebody turned it off with a switch.<eos> But in the areas controlling sensory awareness, thoughts and emotions... bang.<eos> So the animals know what's happening to them?<eos> Yeah, the entire time.<eos> A man would, too.
No money, no equipment... he didn't even have an education.<eos> He had to come up with the entire theory in his head.<eos> And you, you just take it.<eos> Marie, I did not just take it.<eos> I merely borrowed it... in order to develop a lucrative proposition for us all.<eos> Einstein will get a percentage, of course.<eos> I hate you for what you have done.<eos> I don't see what you're getting so upset about.<eos> Somebody had to make something of it.<eos> He never would.
Sure.<eos> There 's no hurry.<eos> I said in 6' months...<eos> The rest is coming.<eos> He still inspires you?<eos> Not only that<eos> - You're gonna hear something fantastic...<eos> I'd like to have Berangere, a bit.<eos> I'm organized now, so if she wants....<eos> Sure she would.
Maybe a little too nice.<eos> No, I'm sorry, we don't have a thing available until after 7.15.<eos> Yeah, that's OK.<eos> - Goodnight, Rose.<eos> - The young woman said you'd get this.<eos> - She didn't pay for this?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> Lulu?<eos> She said the gentleman would pay for dinner.<eos> The gentleman would...
- Uh, no.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You were saying you ended this relationship with this girl.<eos> Well, i came home... see, i was living with a ballet dancer. Her name was daniele.<eos> So when my father gave me a "c" in english, i didn't understand.<eos> He told me it was because he had to treat me like all the other kids, but i really thought he was being much tougher on me... sorry, larry.<eos> That's all the time we have for today.<eos> If you like, i can see you next thursday at 3:00.<eos> Yes, yes, i would.
- Good.<eos> Gracias, señor.<eos> Had an English friend fighting in Spain.<eos> He was there from the start.<eos> During the Battle of Madrid... he lay holed up with a machine gun in the library of University City... reading Carlyle between attacks.<eos> He was a Communist.<eos> Approximately the best man I ever met.<eos> Had a taste for Vin Rosé d'Anjou... and a dog named Harpo.<eos> You wouldn't expect a Communist to have a dog named Harpo.<eos> Or would one?
So Henry has offered to fetch it tomorrow in his barouche.<eos> It travels in style.<eos> During the haymaking, it would be hard to spare a horse.<eos> Hmm. Well, in London we have a maxim.<eos> "Everything can be bought with money."<eos> I shall understand all your ways in time.<eos> Will you write to your brother and tell him I shall prepare some plaintive air against his return?<eos> And you shall come and listen to me.<eos> It will give me the greatest pleasure, though I am not expecting to write to Tom at present.<eos> What brother would?
Almost time for my father to come home from work.<eos> What's the matter? What you crying for?<eos> Daddy's going to kill Ralphie.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> Yes, he is, too.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> I promise you Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.<eos> Why don't you come on out of there?<eos> Would you like some milk?<eos> You would?
- I can't believe you just said that.<eos> I didn't mean it.<eos> I didn't mean it, I swear.<eos> - What have you been doing, Emma? - Nothing.<eos> What is it, Momma?<eos> I really would like to get some sleep so I could look halfway decent for tomorrow.<eos> Come on.<eos> What is it?<eos> You wouldn't want me to be silent about something that's for your own good, even if it might hurt a little, would you?<eos> Yes, ma'am, I certainly would!
I'd like to...<eos> - Let's dance.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's my favorite dance.<eos> - Oh, really, I don't dance.<eos> - You'll love it. - What?<eos> - Follow me. Follow me.<eos> - Please, I don't... I don't...<eos> You know what?<eos> I'd... Really, I'd rather not.
Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your witness.<eos> Anything?<eos> You're aware of the penalties for perjury?<eos> - It's a crime.<eos> - It is a crime.<eos> A serious crime.<eos> - I wouldn't do it.<eos> - You would not?
Oh, my love, should you not like to see a place of which you've heard so much?<eos> Wickham passed all his youth there, you know, it's the home of the Darcy family.<eos> We have seen many great houses.<eos> I confess to being a bit weary of fine carpets and satin curtains.<eos> If it were merely a fine house richly furnished I should not care about it myself, but the grounds are delightful.<eos> You know they have some of the finest woods in england?<eos> They say that those who come to view are made most welcome by whom?<eos> - By the housekeeper, of course.<eos> You would not expect to find a Darcy on such an errand.<eos> No, I would not.
Let's go home.<eos> Okay Doctor, I'm sorry, you're not more uh, cooperative which means that<eos> I'm just gonna have to waste some time in getting a court order to check out your appointment book.<eos> I'm sorry too but I feel I must protect the confidentiality of my patients.<eos> Oh, of course, we're just two professionals doing our job huh?<eos> It's too bad we can't work together.<eos> Come on... thank you very much for your help, I'll be in touch.<eos> Yes, thanks for waiting, this is the answering service.<eos> Would you care to leave a message?<eos> Yes, I would.
- Look, I'm not gonna do this anymore!<eos> George, I had hoped that your motivation for being here would be better by now.<eos> What about getting well?<eos> - Yeah, what about it?<eos> You tell me!<eos> - I am going to cure you, George.<eos> You have my word on that.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> I would like to believe you, Dr. Haber.<eos> I really would.
George Arthur.<eos> - Who were you with, George?<eos> General Joe Shelby.<eos> What about you?<eos> - I was with Shelby, too. - Where?<eos> Coleharbor.<eos> Shelby weren't at Coleharbor.<eos> You're a goddamned liar.<eos> - Should I kill him?<eos> - I would.
Keep away from her, from my house.<eos> Keep away from my car, my tuxedo, my chicken and my bed.<eos> If I even see slippers, I'll shoot first and try them on after.<eos> Ira, sorry I'm late.<eos> Somebody stole my car.<eos> Glenda. Can I have just one minute with you?<eos> Just one minute, Ira.<eos> Time it.<eos> - What if I said I'd change?<eos> - You wouldn't.
Rabbi, this is Mrs. Bender.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Welcome, Rabbi.<eos> And, this is my younger daughter, Rosalie.<eos> I know that in our marriage agreement... I mentioned my other daughter, Sarah Mindl.<eos> - But what difference does it make...<eos> You know, your father thinks that... you can just switch one promised-wife for another promised-wife... but I know that it isn't that way in America.<eos> So, please don't feel... obligated in that way.<eos> Wouldn't you like to dance with me?<eos> I would.
Read it, Mr Cranford.<eos> But I know what killed that beast!<eos> Your beast died of acute heart failure.<eos> It's all in there.<eos> It's my £80 insurance I'm thinking about.<eos> Sorry, it was natural causes.<eos> You'll have to carry the loss.<eos> Now, look, Mr Herriot, we're... both men of the world and... you know as well as I do that the insurance company can stand the loss better than me.<eos> Besides, they... wouldn't know, would they?<eos> I would, Mr Cranford.
Your mother was a grand cook, God rest her.<eos> Yes, she was. And you've been cooking for your dad. I've not heard him complain.<eos> - Mother taught me pretty well.<eos> Doesn't happen if you haven't got the gift.<eos> It's my opinion that every woman should want to cook for her man.<eos> I know what you're going to say, Mrs Hall.<eos> It's very kind of you but this is your kitchen.<eos> It wouldn't do for me to come in.<eos> Well, now, it would...<eos> and it wouldn't.
We don't want no cheap seaters around the table.<eos> If Kenny's moving, you've got to move.<eos> All right.<eos> Would you go if you had the chance again?<eos> - Would I go? Yeah!<eos> - I'd go to Sweden.<eos> No, not to Canada.<eos> - Would you go back to 'nam again?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You would?
- Yeah. Everybody likes Johnny.<eos> Hey, Molly.<eos> He wants to go out with you.<eos> - Who?<eos> - The gentleman you like.<eos> Abe.<eos> - She wants to go out with you.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - If you don't, I will.<eos> - Yeah, you would, too.
Better than either one of my marriages.<eos> There's just something different about you.<eos> You know, I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun.<eos> I mean, I know it's hard. It's...<eos> Alvy, what about...<eos> what if we go away this weekend?<eos> Why don't we get Rob, and the three of us would drive into Brooklyn?<eos> We could show you the old neighbourhood.<eos> That'd be fun for you.<eos> Yeah, it would.
Uh, can anybody lend me a pair of shoes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Me.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> If you want to buy them, I can make you a nice price.<eos> Fifteen marks.<eos> Oh, no, thanks.<eos> I already have some in my suitcase.<eos> I just need a pair for today.<eos> But if you'd rather not--
Hell, no.<eos> Charlie hates blacks.<eos> He hates Jews.<eos> He even hates women.<eos> He once told me that women were slaves with no souls.<eos> No, whatever it is, it ain, t for the benefit of mankind.<eos> - It, s for the benefit of Charlie. - How?<eos> How does it benefit him?<eos> - I don, t know.<eos> - Who would?
It's early. It's late.<eos> They talked as if I'd been dancing with the Prince of Wales.<eos> Mr. Stahr?<eos> I've said I can't.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> Not now.<eos> Can I talk to you for one minute?<eos> Look, tomorrow is Sunday.<eos> No, I wouldn't like to see the studio.<eos> You wouldn't?
- Mars. Why?<eos> I just thought I'd verify the signal.<eos> - No harm in double-checking.<eos> - What's that, Doctor?<eos> In principle, it's the same as the gadget you've invented, only less cumbersome.<eos> - (BEEPING) - Yes, it is the same signal.<eos> Obviously automatic.<eos> Well, if it's a message, it shouldn't be difficult to decipher.<eos> - They'd make it easy.<eos> - Who would?
What do you think girls?<eos> No wonder, haven't slept for over 28 hours.<eos> I too am sleepy.<eos> Girls, what about following this trail of smoke?<eos> Will it lead to where those scoundrels lured Agapit?<eos> What if we pretend we too were affected by their infernal music!<eos> Aye girls?<eos> Not a bad idea.<eos> Vic would understand.<eos> No, wouldn't.
- Is Haven around?<eos> - Yeah, right around the corner.<eos> Would you check and see if it's all right if we come? - Yeah.<eos> - I see him with other people.<eos> Thank you, Del.<eos> Do you want to be a singer? Look at me.<eos> - Look at me.<eos> - I think everybody...<eos> Dad wouldn't hear of it.<eos> He really wouldn't. He...
- This red stuff, yes, sir.<eos> I haven't seen tomato juice in donkey's years.<eos> Reminds me of all the goodies back home.<eos> - Kosher pickles. - Apple pancakes.<eos> - Escargot.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Snails.<eos> - Oh, ick.<eos> I would never eat a snail.<eos> Nobody would.
There's one peeping at you down there.<eos> Oh, not really.<eos> My husband... Will he come back?<eos> - What else do you know about him?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> But I know everything about you.<eos> One look and I know it all.<eos> - Then perhaps you'd like to tell me.<eos> - "Perhaps you'd like to tell me."<eos> Perhaps I wouldn't...
Sellin' 'em.<eos> I gotta hand it to ya, Harve.<eos> You sure knew you were looking for something.<eos> Yeah, Wintergreen, and I'm looking for something now.<eos> Robert W. Zemko.<eos> You figure Zemko's the one, huh?<eos> Well, Wintergreen, when you find a load of dope and fingerprints of a convicted dealer, it don't take a brain like Harve Poole to know you got a prime suspect.<eos> Right, Harve.<eos> I never would've figured old Frank to be a dealer.<eos> You wouldn't, huh?
You are the best combination chauffeur and private detective in the business. But what is the matter? Why can't he get something for you on Logan and get rid of all your opposition?<eos> Tell me now, Quincy. What is it?<eos> What's wrong? Your wiretapping - it's not working?<eos> Why can't you frame a harmless old bachelor? - Yes, Valerie?<eos> - 'Excuse me, Mr Buckner. '<eos> - 'Mr Logan and the others are here. ' - Thank you.<eos> It's all here, Roger. Tomorrow, the conglomerate attorneys are meeting me at the cabin in Pinewild to discuss the terms of the sale.<eos> Tonight, I want you to go see your Aunt Dori and tell her you don't care about working here, you're quitting, and tomorrow, you release that statement to the press.<eos> Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to show her all this.<eos> You really would, wouldn't you? I would.
Won't you believe me?<eos> Don't you think that you can count on me?<eos> Just don't bump your head anymore.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Will you forget that?<eos> Hey, listen. I just asked you a question.<eos> Do you think I'd let you down?<eos> I don't know. Would you?<eos> Hey, I wouldn't.<eos> Maybe you wouldn't.
Come, sit with us.<eos> Have a cup of coffee and a sandwich.<eos> Perhaps Mr. Bakersfeld could impress upon Mrs. Quonsett that this isn't a very nice thing to do.<eos> Mrs. Livingston hasn't been able to.<eos> Yes, Mrs. Quonsett.<eos> What you've done is dishonest.<eos> You've broken the law.<eos> You've defrauded Trans Global.<eos> Don't you realize they can prosecute you?<eos> But they wouldn't, would they?
- It's fate.<eos> Cruchot, go explore.<eos> Merlot, Fougasse, help him.<eos> Why me?<eos> First, we need to know if they're really inside.<eos> You go have a look.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> - The sentry post is at the back.<eos> - If they come to patrol...<eos> Why would they?
Bound to.<eos> I sure don't feel much like it.<eos> No. Me neither. Go get him.<eos> Just one fool thing after another.<eos> It sure is.<eos> Jimmy, can't you stop this?<eos> Stop what?<eos> Thanks, John Henry.<eos> Well, now, I wouldn't call that exactly fair, would you?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
-Thank you.<eos> Please.<eos> As I told you last night, Mr. Singer, I don't treat whites.<eos> No charge.<eos> I said, no charge.<eos> Bad enough having to treat him without taking money for it.<eos> The attitude shock you, huh?<eos> Why should it?<eos> You'd take it for granted if I were white and he were colored.<eos> Yes, you would.
Irene'll arrange it.<eos> 10,000 scattered and 15 miles.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - No sweat. We're all clear.<eos> - Bye-bye.<eos> Joe, George.<eos> Greg.<eos> See ya when we get back.<eos> Would you like to let your friend know you're coming?<eos> Yes, I would.
Go to Shimpo Temple.<eos> Who will go to report it?<eos> It isn't over.<eos> My experience tells me it's only just begun.<eos> Why not send him?<eos> A vagrant?<eos> What he says makes sense.<eos> Even if it was our obligation, we did just kill the chief vassal.<eos> We'd better stay together till things settle down.<eos> Yes, you'd better.
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.<eos> I don't believe in witchcraft, but there are plenty of crazy people in this city.<eos> - The doctor's name is Shand?<eos> - No, Dr Shand is one of them.<eos> - The doctor's name is Sapirstein.<eos> - Abraham Sapirstein?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Do you know him? - I've met him once or twice.<eos> To look at him, you' d never think...<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Say nothing of what you've seen here tonight.<eos> Now look, Sergeant, it doesn't need me to tell you there's something very wrong in this village.<eos> All these young men dying and now this.<eos> Well, some people say it is the marsh fever, sir.<eos> Oh, marsh fiddlesticks.<eos> In any case, it couldn't cause a body to disappear into thin air, could it?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Well, then, will you help me or not?<eos> I'd like to help you, sir.<eos> Really I would.
My wife.<eos> My wife gets sick quite easily.<eos> Your wife is Martha.<eos> I know.<eos> She doesn't really spend any time in a rest home?<eos> Your wife?<eos> No, yours.<eos> Mine?<eos> She doesn't.<eos> I would.
- Do you write ?<eos> - Two rhymes.<eos> I recommend the duck a la rouennaise.<eos> A la rouennaise.<eos> Roasted meat in velvet sauce ?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - In velvet.<eos> Rabbit a la cabriole.<eos> I wouldn't recommend it for you.<eos> You wouldn't ?
Admiral, have these correspondents been instructed in security?<eos> They'll be instructed, Captain.<eos> You may return to your duties.<eos> Aye, aye, sir.<eos> I'm sure you boys realise that you're not to file any stories until Cdr. Owynn gives you the word. Now, back to Operation Apple Pie.<eos> Carry on.<eos> Lieutenant, do you have any idea how Broderick knows these details?<eos> I'm afraid not, sir.<eos> You wouldn't know about Owynn sending special dispatches to Toulebonne?<eos> I wouldn't, sir.
You have to tell me something.<eos> She could live or die or end up paralyzed.<eos> Hear that?<eos> Be quiet!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> I told you he'd get mad.<eos> But what are her chances?<eos> Can't you tell me that?<eos> - It wouldn't change anything.<eos> - It would for me!
Lilith!<eos> Lie down!<eos> Lie down!<eos> What happened?<eos> They took the wrong fork of the river and they went over the falls.<eos> Did you happen to hear the name of the family?<eos> I think.<eos> Something like that.<eos> As soon as they're buried decent I'm heading back East on the first boat that comes along.<eos> you would too.
All scrubbed and nice and waiting for you to hear their prayers.<eos> Thank you, Anna.<eos> I shall be up in a moment.<eos> One thing more before I go.<eos> - Yes, miss? - Our local vicar, what sort of man is he?<eos> The Reverend Fennel?<eos> Oh, he's a very fine sort of gentleman, miss.<eos> Oh, but, miss, I wouldn't do that.<eos> I mean, if you were thinking of discussing with the vicar what we have been discussing...<eos> Oh, I wouldn't, miss.
And there is something else you have in common:<eos> you are a German.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> Did you like it?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> Very much indeed.<eos> - Can I drop you? - I only live a few blocks from here.<eos> I was going to walk.<eos> Would you like to go for a walk?<eos> Yes. Yes, I would.
How could I be so stupid?<eos> You'd think I would've learned by now.<eos> When you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.<eos> It's Christmas Eve, Fran.<eos> Let's not fight, huh?<eos> - Merry Christmas. - What is it?<eos> Oh. Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.<eos> - Thanks, Fran.<eos> We'd better keep it here.<eos> - Yeah, we'd better.
Go on.<eos> Thanks, Corneal.<eos> It's excellent what you did.<eos> Yes, excellent. Goodbye.<eos> Another crisis lived through.<eos> They're letting Bergdorf out.<eos> Giving him an amnesty.<eos> Some joke.<eos> I bet Ocean knew it, but he wouldn't tell me.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
'Twas his lordship's carriage you saw.<eos> His coachman told me they found you rootin' in the mud of the road, so far gone in grief you were out of your mind entirely.<eos> Pony, I heard you were goin' to live in Cahersiveen.<eos> I am.<eos> Then why don't you be on your way and leave us alone?<eos> Don't worry. I will.<eos> I've heard enough silly blather about little people to last me a lifetime.<eos> What kind of man are you at all that doesn't believe in the little people?<eos> - Maybe you'd like to find out.<eos> - Indeed I would.
My personal experience with spies is limited.<eos> I've only known one. Do you mind, Major?<eos> I prefer to ride alone.<eos> All right, forward.<eos> Back in line, Doctor.<eos> These lady's drawers are almost dry. - Yeah.<eos> Aren't you getting chilly?<eos> Don't tell me you're concerned about my health.<eos> If I give you back your clothes, will you promise not to run away again?<eos> I would, ma'am.
Do you know where you are?<eos> Do you know who you are?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Then stop being a child!<eos> Don`t you know that when you became a soldier, you contracted for killing in all its forms?<eos> I do not think it possible to remake this world from the basement of a little police station.<eos> It doesn`t matter what you believe.<eos> Under battle conditions, I could shoot you for what you have just done.<eos> And I would.
Look, this is something for you.<eos> There you go.<eos> She's hungry.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Oh, she is such a sweetheart.<eos> Max, a child of this age is truly missing here.<eos> Yes, all our own are already too grown up.<eos> A mother has nothing left to do.<eos> You probably just want to keep it.<eos> Yes, I would.
If he's so set on going, let him go alone.<eos> It doesn't take two to shoot at a shadow.<eos> Grace, you're getting yourself all worked up.<eos> Why do you do whatever he wants?<eos> You know you do.<eos> You always do!<eos> I'll bring your little Arty back home safe and sound, Gracie.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> If it was just you, I'd wish it was black.<eos> Yes, I would!
It doesn't matter.<eos> Just so I can get some sleep.<eos> - Lieutenant Dunbar?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> James Schuyler Dunbar from Boston?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do we know each other?<eos> He's from Boston, too.<eos> But you wouldn't know him unless your house was robbed!<eos> Maybe he would.
Not so far.<eos> Well, if he is, why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've been trying to analyze him.<eos> I think he has a frustration.<eos> He's a good boss, but you never have the feeling that you'd like to do something for him outside of the line of duty.<eos> You do and I'll beat his brains out.<eos> Don't be an ape.<eos> I mean he doesn't draw affection from people.<eos> In your case, he'd better not.
- He does. If you ask me, he's jealous.<eos> - Jealous?<eos> Yeah, I think he has a crush on you.<eos> Turk, don't be silly.<eos> Doc's nice to me.<eos> It's just little things he does, like fixing my breakfast.<eos> He's nice to everyone.<eos> - He ever make a pass?<eos> - No, Doc'd never get fresh.<eos> - He'd better not.
- I didn't know he'd a sister.<eos> Then you know Dr. McClora? - No.<eos> - But you...<eos> But are you sure you wouldn't have time to have a drink with me?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I'll tell you what I'll do, however.<eos> What will you do however?<eos> I'm interested.<eos> - If I meet your friend I'll be glad to give him a message.<eos> - Would you?
And I wish it was a Congressional Medal for bravery.<eos> You earned it.<eos> Help you in, ma'am?<eos> That one's cos you're real pretty.<eos> - Goodbye, ma'am.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> - This is the Jameson place? - That's right.<eos> That garden you were talking about - we could plant it over there.<eos> Maybe you wouldn't want a garden.<eos> Would you?
I didn't mean it that way, or I wouldn't have--<eos> No, Matthew.<eos> I know you've only a few hours, but-- but listen for just a minute, that's all.<eos> Then I won't talk about it anymore.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> He hasn't changed his mind, Matthew.<eos> - I didn't think he would.<eos> - We saw the railroad, and I thought--<eos> I thought it might make a difference, but it didn't.<eos> Nothing would.
Certainly not.<eos> You have no idea what that girl is like.<eos> No idea at all.<eos> She is beyond anyone's reach.<eos> You can't touch her nor tempt her.<eos> You'd get nowhere.<eos> If I were to go, would they throw me out?<eos> You? Go to Port-Royal Square?<eos> Port-Royal Square?<eos> Of course they would.
- What's that to you?<eos> - Looks like I'll be needing a new partner.<eos> Hugo!<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> You're joking.<eos> Like hell I am. I've my career to think of.<eos> What? You wouldn't run out on me now?<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> You wouldn't do that to me.<eos> Oh, wouldn't I?

Orders.<eos> Well, goodbye, sir.<eos> I'll have your bag put in your bunk.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Good night.<eos> - Thank you, Hastings.<eos> - Au revoir, Captain.<eos> - Good luck to you.<eos> - Would you like to take your coat off?<eos> - I would, thanks.
