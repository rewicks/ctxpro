Can I have a word?<eos> Alone?<eos> What is it?<eos> We can't let luna win.<eos> The time for alliances is past.<eos> I'm fighting for my people today.<eos> Can you beat her?<eos> Of course he can.<eos> She bleeds like everyone else.<eos> I know it's hard for you to accept that it's over, but it is over.
Gael kom ingranronakru...<eos> Please don't be her.<eos> Fio kom trikru...<eos> Octavia's still out there.<eos> Couldn't tell her I loved her, even with the world ending.<eos> Trust me, Bellamy, she knows.<eos> She knows.<eos> You were smart to come back here and hide, but not smart enough.<eos> For Lincoln's sake, I'll make your death quick.<eos> How could you even say his name?
More blood?<eos> You used to believe that people were worth saving.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Skaikru taught me that people are cruel and violent and selfish to the core.<eos> Not Lincoln.<eos> He believed that we can do better, and I loved him for that.<eos> And yet here you are, killing for your own clan, just like everyone else.<eos> Lincoln would be ashamed of you.<eos> Like hell it is.<eos> You can't hide forever.

You can't hide forever.<eos> Octavia, I'm not here to kill you.<eos> Then you came to the wrong place.<eos> Other clans are making alliances, working together.<eos> We should do the same.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> Look. You should've stayed back at your farm.<eos> Octavia, I won't be your enemy.<eos> I'm not the girl you want me to be.<eos> The next time I see you... I'll kill you...
I take it by your presence here that your sister's still alive.<eos> That's right.<eos> If I call for a scout, she'll be executed right now...<eos> But what fun would that be?<eos> You really think she can win, don't you?<eos> I wouldn't count her out if I were you.<eos> She's survived harder things than this.<eos> Before she dies, I'll tell her she's lucky to have you as a brother.<eos> I got a better idea.<eos> After she guts you and before you die, you tell her I was the lucky one.
Big surprise?<eos> But Woods, yeah, he found me after.<eos> And he told me to my face that he'd settle the score.<eos> Is there anyone who can back that story up?<eos> No.<eos> Hell no.<eos> You bring somebody else in here.<eos> Look, I'll talk to them, but I ain't about to trust your lying ass.<eos> My friend took a bullet in the forehead over $122.<eos> You're lucky they didn't pull you out of the...
Look, Eric, as far as we know, you were just defending Jo Jo's honor.<eos> I mean, you don't have a record.<eos> You probably didn't mean for anything to happen.<eos> I mean, we're thinking you went home, you dug up one of your dad's guns and you went to see Richie.<eos> And that's when things fell apart.<eos> Okay, so, now here's the problem.<eos> This is your dad's gun, right?<eos> All right, so see, him and your mom they're responsible for providing a weapon that was used in the commission of a crime.<eos> Just because it was in the house, where you could have access to it.<eos> Unless they drove you to see Richie and they put the gun in your hands and they said, "Go kill him."
Show me your hands! Show me your hands!<eos> Get out of bed.<eos> Whoa, whoa, wait.<eos> You ain't got no business here.<eos> - This is my home.<eos> - Take her, too.<eos> For what?<eos> Get dressed, Sunshine. Let's go.<eos> You hit the lottery, Sammy?<eos> Did your old boss ever let you do interviews?
That's bad news for you.<eos> You're facing a murder for hire charge.<eos> And you're 17 years old.<eos> That's close enough for the state to charge you as an adult.<eos> But we don't need to go there.<eos> You can tell us what we already know.<eos> Lavar Spann hired you to kill Bobby and Darren Wilkes.<eos> That was smart, using a gauge.<eos> We couldn't trace the ammo.<eos> But we did recover a 40-ounce bottle with your prints on it from the murder scene, and we have a witness who saw you fleeing that scene.
I mean, I figure you got the inside track with you two shacking up.<eos> So, why don't you tell me right now: What was he into?<eos> Who would've gone looking for him at your place and done this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He was good to me, Hank.<eos> I would tell you if I knew.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's get real specific about this morning.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Who saw you there?
What the...?<eos> [groans] [laughing] Eep, what are you doing here?<eos> You're supposed to be tyrannaconda food.<eos> Can't keep this girl down.<eos> [chuckles] Really, he couldn't.<eos> It was like...<eos> Then I'll just fight back like... [grunting]<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Enough!<eos> I'm dragging you out of this town.
Amber heard Grug excuses but not hear Grug apology.<eos> For what? You don't even have a scratch on you.<eos> All right, fine, I admit it, I left you in the cave so that we could defeat the Broods without all of you there to muck it up.<eos> Well, I never!<eos> [both growling] Friends, just to be clear, Grug doesn't growl for all of us.<eos> Come on, be honest, Ugga, the only reason we went on vacate-shun was to get away from these bigmouths, always butting in like big...<eos> [all gasp] Say it ain't so, Eep.<eos> Say it ain't so.<eos> No, Lerk, that's how my dad feels, not me.<eos> Lerk, please, I didn't call you a... [sobs] I just came back to let you know one more time that... [bawling]
But there's nothing here.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Grace.<eos> I'm so sorry, your assistant sent me up.<eos> She said you were finishing up a meeting. And we are.<eos> Grace Barrows, Catherine Adams.<eos> Grace is my government liaison for the Mars project<eos> - I was telling you about.
That's what's most important.<eos> I wish I didn't have to leave you on your birthday.<eos> There's a lot of things we wish we didn't have to do.<eos> You go.<eos> Code 9-5-7-2-3.<eos> Charlie, Victor.<eos> Authorizing transfer of four P-9 barrels of Uranium-235 from the WIPP facility in Maryland.<eos> This had to be tonight?<eos> I'm just doing my share, Deputy Secretary, by selling my investor on the Mars project.<eos> And you don't mind lying to her about where her money is really going?
For the poison ivy, stops the itching.<eos> You have an answer for everything.<eos> Yeah, well, that's my military training.<eos> Ready for anything, anytime.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What gets red wine out?<eos> Was it salt or peroxide?<eos> - Harris.<eos> I need to tell you...
What are you, what are you doing here?<eos> So, some guy named Lazlo just showed up at the bookstore the other day.<eos> He said that Darius Tanz wanted to meet me.<eos> I'm getting a tour, and he's taking me to lunch.<eos> Wow. I assumed it was because of you.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I-I told him all about you.<eos> I just, I didn't realize that was today. - Yeah.<eos> - That's, uh...<eos> I'm really glad to see you.
Short of that, I will recommend to the president that we move forward with the impactor plan, seven days from now.<eos> And God help us all.<eos> _<eos> Your press liaison seems awfully empowered to speak her mind to the Deputy Secretary of Defense.<eos> Grace's point was valid, and she's there to counterbalance the wonks and military types.<eos> Like you and me.<eos> Frankly, I'm surprised she even has clearance to be there.<eos> What are you getting at, Claire?<eos> Come on, I've been in God knows how many meetings with you, Harris.<eos> You don't give anyone that much sway once you've made your stance known.
Now, I don't mean to be abrupt, but I have some...<eos> I have some family business to attend to.<eos> Of course.<eos> But if you change your mind, you know where to find me.<eos> Why is Jillian here?<eos> I thought you'd be happy. - Well, I am.<eos> - Then what's the problem?<eos> It's a distraction. Really?<eos> See, I thought it was more of a distraction when you were taking detours to her bookstore to catch a loving glimpse of her through a window.<eos> I need your head in the game; that means I want everything you care about under one roof: mine.
This is not just some rebellion, Dad,<eos> I'm actually trying to save the world.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, you aren't going to do it from a jail cell.<eos> - Now let's get out of here.<eos> - What about my friends?<eos> What about them?<eos> They're locked up back there.<eos> You always said leave no man behind.<eos> Dylan, I called in a favor to get you out of here.
- Heinlein, of course.<eos> Uh... - What about Bartok?<eos> Andre Bartok?<eos> Too dystopian for my taste.<eos> Surprising, considering your connection to him.<eos> He's your... grandfather, if I'm not mistaken?<eos> Mr. Tanz, what am I doing here having lunch with you?<eos> If you want to meet my grandfather...<eos> No, on the contrary.<eos> I have a proposition. For you.
- What?<eos> Beyond.<eos> Would you be happy to see more of me?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Darius offered me a job.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He has this think tank where he brings together authors, artists, philosophers, and he said that I would make a great addition.<eos> I thought you'd be happy.<eos> Don't you find it strange that he would pluck you from obscurity, fly you here, offer you a job...
I told you not to push it, damn it.<eos> Darius told me to send more power.<eos> Nothing was happening.<eos> We needed to improvise. Improvise?<eos> We just figured out how to make it work, and you want to improvise?<eos> - That's how things get done.<eos> - Croft's right.<eos> You're not a scientist, you're a celebrity.<eos> Is that right?<eos> And now, because I listened to you, our last chance to save our collective asses has literally gone up in flames.
Darius hates anything that slows him down.<eos> Once, he shut down a firewall because it was interfering with a holographic conferencing system he was tinkering with.<eos> It's possible he has a private terminal somewhere on the site.<eos> Well, then it's possible that the mole found that and used it to lock us out of the probe.<eos> If we find that terminal, we might regain control.<eos> There's over 500,000 square feet of ground to cover in this building alone.<eos> How much time do we have?<eos> Less than four hours.<eos> Well, then it's impossible without Darius's help.<eos> And what if Harris won't let you talk to him?
Can you talk more about that?<eos> We have never been more vulnerable in this country than we are today.<eos> We've suffered significant intelligence failures, both foreign and domestic, under the Haas administration.<eos> The CIA failed to prevent an Islamic Front attack at the G20.<eos> And just a few days ago, he FBI suffered an attack... in their own backyard.<eos> You have to stop calling me.<eos> - And you have to get me out of here.<eos> - Not possible.<eos> The FBI is doing random sweeps on The Farm looking for you.<eos> You poke your head up for air, you'll be thrown in a hole so deep, no one will find you.
Well, glad I could help.<eos> You want to really help?<eos> Take off those pity pants, come back to the bunker with me, and do your job.<eos> My mom used to say that.<eos> My mom used to say,<eos> "Get your head out of your ass, Clay.<eos> I can't give a speech about gun control at the NRA."<eos> I might still be a little bit drunk.<eos> Come back.<eos> Do what you were meant to do.
Breathe.<eos> Let your mind rest.<eos> We won't see anything if you're all wound up.<eos> I'm not wound up.<eos> I'm just sober, finally.<eos> Yeah, well, you still need to take a moment.<eos> And if I'm being honest, I kind of need one, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry I made a pass at you.<eos> I'm sorry Maxine left you.
We are on Cat's clock now.<eos> We only have 3 1/2 hours left.<eos> I know what the secret is.<eos> You do?<eos> Why else would you put me through all this? Ooh.<eos> Phrasing it in the form of a question.<eos> That way it doesn't count as a guess.<eos> Very smart, doctor.<eos> I'm gonna walk you through a scenario and your face is gonna tell me how close I am.<eos> From the moment I arrested you, you watched and waited for the right time to take your revenge.
So have you.<eos> And we've never...<eos> I know.<eos> We've never...<eos> Ask me how I did it.<eos> Come on, ask me.<eos> How did you do it?<eos> I had Lindsey dose you in Mexico.<eos> You lost time.<eos> And I gave her very specific instructions to get you in the mood. What, did she pretend to be you?
No. Don't say that.<eos> Je...<eos> I do know.<eos> I know two inmates, Frazier and Duerson, killed your friend Delgado in front of you.<eos> And I know they wanted you to move their heroin, and I also know that if you didn't, you would have been next, right?<eos> Spence, anyone in your spot would have done the same thing. You wouldn't have.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I would have, Spence.<eos> If someone was threatening my life, you bet your ass I would.<eos> It doesn't make you a bad person.

You wouldn't have.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I would have, Spence.<eos> If someone was threatening my life, you bet your ass I would.<eos> It doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> 'Cause you know who does think like that, that... that in you doing what you had to do to survive somehow makes you a psychopath?
Oh, my God.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Look at me. He seems like a pretty all right kid.<eos> He... I... it's complicated.<eos> I'll try.<eos> I make no promises.<eos> Go save some lives, baby girl.<eos> Ok.<eos> Meow.<eos> I hate it when you go, but I love when you walk away.
Kai.<eos> I'll show you the most important step of the process.<eos> I've written down everyone that Cheng Yi introduced me to.<eos> People, time, place.<eos> I now know how he moves every day.<eos> The factory is just for packing.<eos> Do you have anything else?<eos> I'll keep investigating.<eos> Nice one, Kai...<eos> I just taught you a lesson, didn't I?
The heartless bastard left you for dead ten years ago.<eos> Now you have a chance at revenge.<eos> Take two shots at him.<eos> If the shots don't kill him, then God has spoken.<eos> You can take him home.<eos> If you don't take the shots, then both of you have to stay here.<eos> You'll do ten more years.<eos> How's that sound?<eos> How can you cheat?<eos> How dare you cheat?
See?<eos> You should've let me go with my friends, where I'd be out of harm's way. Thanks!<eos> It's your grandpa's birthday.<eos> You can't go until you've sung to him.<eos> Even the U.S. ambassador is here.<eos> Grandpa's really old.<eos> There are going to be so many candles on his cake that he'll burn himself.<eos> Don't be so rude.<eos> It's his birthday.<eos> -What are you laughing at?
And it's also the most important answer of your life.<eos> Your future and freedom depend on it.<eos> So take your time.<eos> Man to man, General.<eos> There's nothing I'd like more than to know where Emilia Urquiza is, and, above all, how she is doing.<eos> I told you, General.<eos> I haven't heard from her.<eos> Need a hand?<eos> These two are enough.<eos> Who do you think you are?
Don't point that at me!<eos> Bring the guns.<eos> Come on, get up!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Christopher. Christopher.<eos> Cut it out, man!<eos> Christopher! Christopher!<eos> Christopher!<eos> Let me out, you bastard!<eos> Christopher, you're a fucking idiot!
Open up!<eos> [Emilia] Christopher.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> [man on TV] The fact is that, after President Nava's death,<eos> Emilia Urquiza went missing, which makes us wonder if she was involved in the president's death.<eos> Have you heard from Zyan?<eos> -You just asked me half an hour ago.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Why do you care so much about that woman?
Like you.<eos> You kill your piece of shit husband.<eos> And then you come strutting through my barrio.<eos> And on top of that, you've got the ovaries... to go around asking for favors.<eos> As if we owed you something.<eos> But you owe me something much bigger.<eos> Don't touch her, you son of a bitch!<eos> Don't touch her!<eos> [Emilia] How can it be that, after 20 years, you've changed so much in just the last two?<eos> If you leave, you're going alone.
Talk to me, honey.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> My mom is a murderer.<eos> She killed my dad.<eos> Do you really believe your mom would do something like that?<eos> Why hasn't she come for us?<eos> Because she's afraid.<eos> You know what your mom's like.<eos> Remember everything she taught you and your sister.<eos> Remember that she always told you and Maria that you can't judge people without knowing their stories.
They did things their own fucking way.<eos> Excessive force.<eos> Extrajudicial and arbitrary arrests.<eos> Arbitrary?<eos> They came to my barrio.<eos> They took my sister.<eos> They came for all of them.<eos> And all except for one, they took all of the Bitches.<eos> The ones from Tepito.<eos> Now you remember, you bastard?
-Christopher, don't be stupid.<eos> -Chris...<eos> Drop it, brother.<eos> Christopher.<eos> Give me that thing, dude.<eos> Don't be stupid, Christopher.<eos> Kill me, and you'll never find out what happened to your sister.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Kill me but you'll never know what the fuck happened to Mosca.<eos> Help me and if your sister is still alive, I'll help you find her, I swear.
-Are you okay?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> That's it. Okay.<eos> We'll fix this, man.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> I need to know who killed Diego.<eos> -I need a place to hide.<eos> -You have to be fucking kidding me.<eos> The first lady has a list of demands?<eos> But there isn't a single cop who isn't looking for you.
Are you sure?<eos> They just wanted to see if I knew where Emilia was, and I don't.<eos> I'd like to keep it that way.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> Or else I'm leaving.<eos> -Did they threaten you?<eos> -No.<eos> You're lying to me, Dolores.<eos> Well...<eos> They told me they could pick you up for questioning.
I'm not a secretary.<eos> And I'm here because the president asked me to be.<eos> We've been very tolerant of your actions.<eos> This is the last time we'll ask, Mr. Urquiza.<eos> Be very careful what you say to the press.<eos> You don't want problems with the president.<eos> Hey, tell me something.<eos> Are you sleeping with this president, too?<eos> Or was it just with my dad?<eos> I don't know what made you say that, Maria.
Are you aware you're this close to getting me in trouble with my wife?<eos> I just wanted to talk to you, and you won't even reply to a damn text or call.<eos> Fine, I'm here.<eos> What's so urgent?<eos> I think I saw my mom at the funeral.<eos> What?<eos> At the church?<eos> No, outside in the crowd.<eos> And I need you to help me check.<eos> How am I supposed to help you find out something like that?
There's nothing that links Bray to criminal activity.<eos> You and I want the same thing.<eos> We want to find Emilia.<eos> We want justice for President Nava and for Mexico.<eos> The warehouse was a key part of our investigation.<eos> Drug trafficking is handled by the Secretariat of National Defense.<eos> Your investigation has nothing to do with that warehouse.<eos> Nothing?<eos> Nothing we can use.<eos> Chela wants you to go.
-No.<eos> Anything else you'd like to add?<eos> No, no. No, I think that's all.<eos> -Good.<eos> I'll sign and be done with it.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> [guard] Door!<eos> -Listen, little princess. -[grunting]<eos> A little birdie told me you think you're the shit. [shrieks]
There's no way.<eos> Oh, no?<eos> Then where is he? !<eos> -I don't know!<eos> -[Chela] We're in serious trouble.<eos> Turn on the news.<eos> [man] Reports confirm that Jaime Bray's body was found here.<eos> What?<eos> [doctor] So, you already showed them who's the big shot here.<eos> You've only been here a year and they're already calling you El Bravo.
-I don't know!<eos> -[Chela] We're in serious trouble.<eos> Turn on the news.<eos> [man] Reports confirm that Jaime Bray's body was found here.<eos> What?<eos> [doctor] So, you already showed them who's the big shot here.<eos> You've only been here a year and they're already calling you El Bravo.<eos> They could kill you for that.<eos> Or is that what you want?<eos> Why do you fight?
It isn't, but we're counting on you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Mosquita.<eos> Shut up, you damn dogs.<eos> Hey, dog... wanna die?<eos> Want to get out?<eos> [man over speaker] Shift change. Shift change.<eos> Shift change!<eos> Being with a younger man has its pros and cons.<eos> -One of the pros is... they respect you more than men your age.
Hands up! Identify yourself.<eos> I'm Emilia Urquiza.<eos> I'm turning myself in.<eos> What's she doing? What the hell?<eos> [man] On your knees!<eos> [screaming] [man] On your knees!<eos> I have the guy on the right.<eos> Wait!<eos> We have a problem.<eos> Emilia, why did you get in the way?
[Chela] Maybe you can just pretend it's one of those computer games you like.<eos> Sis, Citlalli!<eos> [Citlalli] Help me. Help me!<eos> [Zyan] Get down!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Get out!<eos> Just wait, damn it.<eos> You okay?<eos> Have you seen Citlalli? Mosca?<eos> What did they do to you?
Get out of here!<eos> Get out!<eos> Just wait, damn it.<eos> You okay?<eos> Have you seen Citlalli? Mosca?<eos> What did they do to you?<eos> [crying] Little brother!<eos> [Chris] It's okay.<eos> Here he is.<eos> What did they do to you?
Don't kill him.<eos> I need him to talk.<eos> I won't say a damn thing.<eos> [Citlalli] For me.<eos> For all the Bitches who will come after me.<eos> For all women in this tough barrio.<eos> For all women in this tough barrio.<eos> [Zyan] Juan! Juan...<eos> It's okay.<eos> We'll come back for you.
Bringing a soldier here?<eos> Rip his shirt.<eos> [Ovni] Here.<eos> [phone ringing] EMILIA URQUIZA'S LOVER DIES<eos> [woman] Mr. President, it's General Aguirre.<eos> Send him in.<eos> Tell me, what the hell is wrong now?<eos> The C1.<eos> It's... a secret detention center.<eos> We kept it that way so you wouldn't be involved.
I need to see my children.<eos> I need to see my children, please.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> I need to know what they're thinking.<eos> Your children?<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> Look at me. Come here.<eos> Your children know you.<eos> They know who you are.<eos> And anyone who knows you knows everything they're saying is a lie.
You want Emilia to see her kids on TV.<eos> She'll turn herself in.<eos> I know her.<eos> She won't be able to resist.<eos> -[bell tolling] -[Diego] Viva Mexico!<eos> ONE YEAR AGO... [crowd cheering]<eos> Good night.<eos> Don't go.<eos> Please.<eos> After you turn yourself in...
Nowhere, Emiliano.<eos> Go back to your room.<eos> Mom left that cell phone in your room.<eos> -I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> -Did you talk to her?<eos> Did she ask about me?<eos> Yes.<eos> And she told me she didn't do it.<eos> That she never would have hurt Dad, okay?<eos> She said she loves you and she'll see you soon.
I have to call her.<eos> -No.<eos> No, we agreed the call from the van was the last.<eos> Chela, if something happens to my daughter because I didn't call her...<eos> All right, call her.<eos> Sixty seconds.<eos> That's it.<eos> Honey...<eos> What happened?<eos> Maria said she was going to see you.
Plus, I can't keep putting you guys at risk by having this around.<eos> Can you trust him?<eos> He's my dad.<eos> I need his help.<eos> [Zyan] If you want to catch her, go where I told you.<eos> -I went looking for you at the club.<eos> -What the hell for?<eos> We need you to help us with the van.<eos> We need to look for Emilia's daughter.<eos> Whatever happens, don't forget that you owe her your life.
No.<eos> No way.<eos> I've paid her back a thousand times already.<eos> You're jealous.<eos> Fine.<eos> You're angry?<eos> Me, too.<eos> But don't go overboard.<eos> Working together is what's kept us safe.<eos> Or have you forgotten?
-We know her location.<eos> -Are you sure?<eos> -Positive, ma'am.<eos> Shall we proceed?<eos> -No.<eos> No, I'll take care of it.<eos> [in English] What took you so long?<eos> -[in English] It's been a busy day.<eos> You don't call 911 and then stay in the house as it's burning down.<eos> Who's onto you?
"As you know, I'm the daughter of the late president,<eos> Diego Nava Martinez and his killer, my mother,<eos> Emilia Urquiza Garcia.<eos> During the past two weeks, you and I have witnessed the weakness and incompetence of Jose Barquet who hasn't been able to bring my mother to justice for the death of my father.<eos> That's the reason why honorable men and true defenders of justice felt the need to take matters into their own hands in the hope that her maternal instincts will compel my mother to do the right thing.<eos> Grandpa, if you're watching this, instead of using your influence for your own gain,<eos> use them to convince her to do the right thing:<eos> to save me.<eos> Mom, do you remember where we went last year, after Independence Day?<eos> I need you to remember.

Did you talk to Dolores?<eos> She's not at the prosecutor's office or at any police station.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Mr. Urquiza.<eos> The jet's ready.<eos> I'll be going to Los Pinos first.<eos> Emiliano!<eos> -I don't want to leave.<eos> -Emiliano.<eos> I need you to try and remember.
Chris, what are you doing with Isabella's babies?<eos> And why are you holding them that way?<eos> You'll hurt them.<eos> Where's Isabella?<eos> She got deported this morning.<eos> Deported?<eos> A-And she just left her babies with you?<eos> Well, just until she can come back.<eos> Chris, are you crazy?<eos> What makes you think you can take care of two babies?
Sorry, Lois, can't leave the eggs till Quagmire gets back.<eos> We're having sloppy joes.<eos> Well, I guess I haven't seen that mongoose in a while.<eos> We're having sloppy joes.<eos> Yeah, I heard.<eos> Please say you got the onion bun...<eos> We're having sloppy joes.<eos> Mongoose!<eos> Mongeese!<eos> Hey, just a heads-up, my dad's friend, Mr. Quagmire, is gonna say a lot of stuff to you, and it's all gonna be disgusting.
Right? I mean, politics aside, we can all agree, that is a problem.<eos> Thanks for the ride, Consuela.<eos> And thanks for talking us on that little detour to Dollywood.<eos> Was I right, or was I right?<eos> Yep, totally worth the extra two days.<eos> Look, Chris, I owe you an apology.<eos> I didn't believe in you. I was wrong to say you couldn't handle the responsibility of taking care of two kids.<eos> Y-You risked your life for those babies.<eos> Well, I didn't want them to get hurt.<eos> That's right. Because you care about them, just like you care about Isabella.
No, fight louder!<eos> Call her a bitch!<eos> But I don't understand.<eos> Why did you come here today?<eos> 'Cause that call last night gave me a scare.<eos> I figured if I do have a kid out there, I want to make sure they're not giving out my information.<eos> They're not supposed to;<eos> I signed a form.<eos> Hold on, Peter.<eos> I'm sorry I tricked you, but if you do have a child out there, isn't it only fair to let him or her meet you?
You're in such great shape.<eos> Well, I do have tiny blue weights in my garage.<eos> Oh, hi, Larry.<eos> Hi, Lois.<eos> Is Peter here?<eos> Larry, it's only 2:00 in the afternoon.<eos> Peter's still sleeping off last night's party.<eos> Then why... why are you still in your pajamas and bathrobe?<eos> Oh, that's because I'm depressed.<eos> Is that why that sad Shel Silverstein blob is following you around?

That would give me a reason to get dressed today.<eos> Oh. Would you, uh, like to join us?

Yeah, your bra strap is getting in the way here.<eos> I'll just bite it off with my teeth.<eos> Lois, is a president stronger than a king?<eos> What the hell? !<eos> Oh, Peter.<eos> L-Look, calm down.<eos> We're just friends.<eos> H-He's just giving me a friendly massage.<eos> A friendly massage?<eos> ! Yeah, and what do you care?
I was holding my own there.<eos> You were getting beat up.<eos> No, no, I meant I was holding my own nuts so he wouldn't kick them.<eos> But if he's not your boyfriend, why'd you kiss him?<eos> He kissed me.<eos> And I should've told you.<eos> I'm sorry if I hurt you, Peter.<eos> I guess Larry just reminded me of a younger version of you, and the truth is,<eos> I liked that he was paying me a little attention, the way you used to.<eos> Maybe I have been taking you for granted, but I promise I'll make it up to you.
Not like I do.<eos> So, trust me when I tell you it's not worth stepping on my toes over this one.<eos> See you upstairs.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Hey, hey. Thanks, man.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Harriman's a beast and now he hates me.<eos> Well, you didn't have to get into it with him.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> A guy steps to you like that, you can't back down.
You are.<eos> You are one of the strongest women I have ever met.<eos> Even if you don't feel like it right now 'cause you're drowning in a sea of hormones.<eos> You have no idea, ma'am.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> You don't have to go at it alone.<eos> Your parents might be shocked, but you are literally the light of their lives and they'll get over it.<eos> And Joe's parents raised a hero, so, really, how bad can they be?<eos> Then you got all of us here.<eos> God help you.
I'm sorry you felt ambushed.<eos> I'm sorry that I called you out in front of the leader of the free world.<eos> I just find it surprising that a guy who was shot multiple times not two months ago and is still on crutches is going to oversee a field op halfway around the world.<eos> Babe.<eos> I've been on point with the VFF mission since the beginning... are you really that surprised?<eos> Okay, okay, it's not that you're going, it's that you<eos> - didn't tell me.<eos> - No, it's that I'm going.<eos> - Are you really gonna push me on this?<eos> - I'm sorry you felt ambushed.
Great.<eos> Well, that was easy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe a little too easy.<eos> We just asked her to spend the week as a single mother, and she just... accepted.<eos> She doesn't have any plans?<eos> She's 22-years-old.<eos> What, she and Jareth don't have a life?<eos> They don't live together.<eos> You ever wonder about that?
- Engaged!<eos> - I have control of the drone.<eos> We have control of the drone.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> It's a miss.<eos> They were able to abort.<eos> I don't have control of the landing mechanism, so it'll have to be a managed crash away from the city.<eos> We will coordinate containment with your Biological Response Force.<eos> I told the school not to bother you.
Do you remember that cabin that we used to rent on the Staunton River when the kids were little?<eos> I saw on Airbnb that it's available.<eos> This weekend.<eos> The same one.<eos> - Cabin 12.<eos> How cool is that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Because, you know, maybe the last family that stayed there got ax murdered.<eos> Stop.<eos> You don't even remember it.
Who'd you think?<eos> Joining us to comment on the situation...<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's been years since anybody yelled at me from another room.<eos> Well, welcome back, gorgeous.<eos> You want breakfast?<eos> - I have to go to work.<eos> - Dinner?<eos> - I have to stay at work.<eos> - Does Bess ever let you eat?
We think that, your old boss, Doroshevich, is behind the Bulgarian invasion.<eos> That would not surprise me.<eos> He was always pushing Ostrov to take a more aggressive stance towards Europe.<eos> Would you be willing to look at some intelligence we've acquired, give me your take?<eos> When I offered my assistance before, you told me it was impossible because of President Dalton's promise to the Russian government.<eos> What's changed?<eos> Part of the agreement with Russia is that they honor their neighbors' borders.<eos> This incursion into Bulgaria, covert as it may be, nullifies that deal.<eos> But if Salnikov knew I was in D.C...<eos> We have ways of protecting you.
Am I gonna get a spanking 'cause you know I...<eos> Just listen. I don't know if you realize this, but whenever you're between projects, you tend to get a little insecure.<eos> Oh. A little clingy.<eos> I know and I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> I love when you're affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place.<eos> Well, excuse me, but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the FDA shut down your project?<eos> I signed us up for ballroom dance class.<eos> Okay, and what did you do when they took you off the antifungal team?
And now the movie just got rated "R."<eos> Hey. You going somewhere?<eos> No, but you are, so I got you this as a present.<eos> Sheldon, that isn't necessary.<eos> No, it is.<eos> Leonard pointed out to me that I'm not always a loving and supportive boyfriend, so here's some quality luggage.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so...<eos> Perhaps you should fly inside it.<eos> Does this mean you're okay with me going?
The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so...<eos> Perhaps you should fly inside it.<eos> Does this mean you're okay with me going?<eos> Well, I'm not looking forward to it, but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it.<eos> Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey, so it's not like you're gonna want to stay.<eos> Uh, I know it's not your birthday, but if you're interested...<eos> I am.<eos> Oh, and just to be clear, I'm not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going.<eos> I wasn't thinking that.<eos> Well, no, it's just, I'm just warning you, you know, if you find yourself 3,000 miles away and craving a-a hit of this, you know I can't Skype it to you.
A fine institution.<eos> The place where Albert Einstein taught, and where Leonard got his PhD, so it may have gone downhill.<eos> And just remember, I'm proud of you. And I support you in all that you do.<eos> Thank you. That means a lot.<eos> Oh, and one last thing. If you find yourself working with a male scientist, who's as smart as me, as tall as me, and has hair like Thor, well, then, I want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately.<eos> ♪♪<eos> How are you settling in?<eos> Pretty well.<eos> Princeton has a beautiful campus.<eos> Now, I've learned some fun facts about New Jersey to help you make small talk.
You like Snickers? Why, with the sugar?<eos> Nuts are healthy.<eos> No, he doesn't eat sugar.<eos> Okay.<eos> Because of your body?<eos> Charlie, why is your dad such a poopie-head sometimes?<eos> Don't say poo... hey!<eos> Charlie, - you see why he gets time outs?<eos> - You told him about my ti...<eos> He... what'd he tell you about my time outs?

- Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> Your car or mine?<eos> Maybe mine.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> We're on an island.<eos> - Where's he gonna go?<eos> - Maybe he thinks we're gonna get bored or back off or something.<eos> That was... that was a legitimate question.<eos> You don't have to be a smart-ass with me.
He joins us from Washington.<eos> - Good to have you with us. - Surely.<eos> Do I quote you correctly, that these ads were planted by someone else out to get you?<eos> Yes, indeed, um...<eos> An exhaustive investigation now indicates that a domestic employee who I discharged for substance abuse... on the second time that we learned that he had a drug problem, is the perpetrator.<eos> I'm deeply troubled by this notion of paid sources who can say anything anonymously about you.<eos> Provide no photographs, no proof, no documents.<eos> You know, it's very hard.<eos> My granddaughter, who's seven years old, said to my wife on Sunday,<eos> "Why are they doing this to you, Grandma?"
"All citizens' rights and privileges"<eos> shall not be suspended unless, when in cases of rebellion or invasion, "the public safety shall require it."<eos> - And that's just one of the amendments.<eos> - I know them well.<eos> "Rebellion," "invasion." That can mean anything.<eos> That's a blank check for the federal government to suspend our rights for any reason.<eos> The world has changed, Iris, and this country has to change along with it.<eos> I've made my choice, and you've made yours... clearly.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Not at all good to see you, Alex.
You hear back from Felix?<eos> Don't take "no" for an answer.<eos> That sounds like girlfriend advice.<eos> And by "girlfriend," you mean "girls who are friends"?<eos> Well, like these two, who apparently had molly for dinner.<eos> No, that's not it.<eos> It's, um...<eos> He doesn't like displays of affection.<eos> Well, and I bet we could get him out of here faster.<eos> Not yet. I told you.
- You're sorry.<eos> You said that already.<eos> If you... ever need anything...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I need you to destroy Roarke.<eos> I believed every lie he told me.<eos> And America does, too.<eos> He told them he would fix the country, and all he wants is to fix it for himself and his friends.<eos> Tell me how to win.<eos> Anything you can think of, they've already thought of.
Just access?<eos> With Peter Theo's intel on your former boss, combined with whatever FSB has on him, the Russians can easily compromise the president, and he won't even see it coming.<eos> And once it's done, he won't be able to get out.<eos> Since my life is on the line, I just have to know... what are the Russians giving you for this?<eos> They're not giving us anything.<eos> We're using them to take Roarke out.<eos> How can you be so sure this will work?<eos> The Russians could do anything with that intelligence.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> And I know I don't have a right to ask you to do this.
I know you guys are friends.<eos> He's grieving.<eos> What does he have to grieve about?<eos> He was heartbroken when you left him.<eos> I left?<eos> Of course.<eos> He can't look like the bad guy around you.<eos> Um, Clay kicked me out, said he didn't want to tarnish my good name, as if it's the turn of the century and there's still such a thing as a good name.<eos> I wanted him, he wanted me gone, and that was that.<eos> I don't know what kind of play he's been putting on for you, but... I can guess why.
He's not pathetic.<eos> What the hell's going on here? !<eos> I'm...<eos> - Well, how'd I do?<eos> - You did so good, baby.<eos> Come here.<eos> We're here.<eos> The car's waiting to take you to the plane.<eos> They're gonna be expecting a body.<eos> We've created a comprehensive paper trail at Bryn Mawr Hospital, including a death certificate and an autopsy, but it will only buy you so much time.
So what are you gonna do now?<eos> Your runaway thing again, like last year?<eos> No.<eos> This time, I disappear.<eos> Hey, look. Thanks for uploading that data.<eos> You'll take the blame for that.<eos> I've masked the IP address a few different ways to make it interesting, but, well, they'll trace it back to you.<eos> At least this country won't be controlled by the Russians.<eos> All right.<eos> Come on. We need to get you out of here. Hey.

We need to get you out of here. Hey.<eos> I'll be in the follow car in case you get made, all right?
You want to go somewhere?<eos> We don't have to hide anymore.<eos> We can finally have that date.<eos> I saw Maxine.<eos> She was here?<eos> Protesting with the Roster.<eos> - She told me what happened.<eos> - Shelby...<eos> You broke up with Maxine because you didn't want her tainted by the scandal of being with you.<eos> You don't have that same concern about me, do you?
But we'll discuss this matter later.<eos> Hi, Sam.<eos> Someone sent you flowers.<eos> Was it Miles?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is it a special occasion?<eos> No, just to be nice.<eos> Well, if he wanted to be nice, he should've gotten you your favorite flower ranunculus.<eos> Pretty flower, bad name.<eos> I can't believe you've remembered that.
Can my special dish be "not coming"?<eos> Nope. They were all out of that at the market.<eos> It's tomorrow night, so be there or be square.<eos> Sam, how's your arm? Is it okay?<eos> Yes, and you've asked me that six times.<eos> It was fine then. Why would it be different now?<eos> Honey, he seems okay.<eos> Stop beating up on yourself.<eos> You know?<eos> Jesus! What's the matter with you?
I didn't say anything.<eos> Okay, we're gonna go.<eos> Bye.<eos> Okay, I know that because of your autism, you might not know if you love me yet, and that's totally fine.<eos> But if you could figure it out by Thursday, that'd be great, because we're having dinner with my whole family and we could break the news to them then.<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> It's about the baby.<eos> I'm tired of leaving you messages.<eos> Obviously, you don't care about this pregnancy, and that's fine.<eos> I was really upset about it before, but I can see now that if you can't be bothered to call back, well, we're better off without you.
Take a carrot for the road.<eos> Okay, I will.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> So...<eos> Okay.<eos> That looked hot and heavy.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I'm saying that we've never really had the "talk."<eos> Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm here if you want to launch right in.
So, Meatball was, um...<eos> Big guy, goatee.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Meatball.<eos> Yeah. I never spoke with him, but he had a kind face.<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna let you go so you can be with...<eos> Actually, you know, it really cheers me up, you being here... if you don't mind staying.
And there's so much new stuff in my life, and I don't like new stuff unless it's exactly like the old stuff, but everything is new... dancing, love, Olive Garden.<eos> They have unlimited breadsticks, but what does that mean?<eos> There has to be some kind of limit.<eos> All right, just relax, Sam, okay?<eos> We're gonna... We're gonna figure this stuff out, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> I lost my poor meatball When somebody sneezed Hey.<eos> Meet me in the supply closet.<eos> What?<eos> I figured out a way to make you feel better.
What the...<eos> Hey, Elsa, what are you doing? What happened?<eos> What, did things get too real for you?<eos> You're being so selfish. You know that?<eos> Oh, good, good. I'm being selfish.<eos> Great. For once, something gets to be about me.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I liked you.<eos> It was fun.<eos> I didn't think you'd get hurt. I wouldn't have done this.
They don't give a shit.<eos> If it's funny, they're, like, "Oh, my God.<eos> Right?"<eos> Ten Indians.<eos> And then he'll count, like the fucking song!<eos> Hilarious!<eos> Women will laugh and cry.<eos> Women will laugh and cry because they're emotional creatures.<eos> They can't give you one emotion.<eos> "I gotta give you two!"
"She's Filipino, Dad."<eos> "Whatever."<eos> "Rice is rice."<eos> What the fuck? "Rice is rice!"<eos> That's so racist!<eos> I'm not knocking what my mom had to do to get to America.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> That's her hustle.<eos> That was her hustle.<eos> God bless you, Mom.
"Rice is rice."<eos> What the fuck? "Rice is rice!"<eos> That's so racist!<eos> I'm not knocking what my mom had to do to get to America.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> That's her hustle.<eos> That was her hustle.<eos> God bless you, Mom.<eos> You hooked up with a soldier and had a kid in America.<eos> God bless you, Mom.
Now they're friends.<eos> Best of friends.<eos> Seeing my mom and sister make up: Funniest shit ever.<eos> Just seeing my mom cry.<eos> "I just want you to know that... I didn't think you gave your pekpek away to everybody."<eos> "Well, I didn't, Mom.<eos> It's right here.<eos> It's the same one you gave me."<eos> Man, I get it, Mom.<eos> God bless you.
Shit.<eos> Here's the thing about dating.<eos> All you need is just to be secure.<eos> Just be secure and your girl is gonna fucking love you.<eos> Stop being insecure.<eos> The minute you're insecure and start questioning her, it fucking turns her off.<eos> Don't question her every time she goes out with her girlfriends.<eos> "Where are you going?"<eos> "I'm going out with my girlfriends.<eos> I told you that already."
What will they say?" They won't understand.<eos> You gotta start opening up to us, kid.<eos> Just, you know, let us know what's going on.<eos> It's hard to be the parent of a teenager.<eos> The teenagers are trying to establish some independence.<eos> Sometimes when they would like help on some level, they're also pushing it away.<eos> And both Clay and Hannah, at times, really would like some help, but don't know how to ask for it.<eos> [Teefey] I feel like parents being honest and not ignoring issues and not ignoring what they went through will really help kids, I think, be a little bit more comfortable.<eos> And, I mean, I always told her:<eos> "You don't have to tell me everything, but if it's really something that's important, I'm here and there's no judgment."

She pushes people away, people that we know would have been there for her.<eos> You know, she could have been more open.<eos> But in a way, she kind of sets up Mr. Porter to fail.<eos> I think it's okay to recognize that.<eos> She wasn't perfect, she didn't do everything she could.<eos> And she should have done more.<eos> So, what happened, Hannah?<eos> How did you get here?<eos> Just... one thing on top of another.<eos> [Mr. Porter] If I'm gonna help you, I'm gonna need you to be a little more specific.
What?<eos> Hey, uh... how's it going?<eos> [McCarthy] It's more than a show about a young woman's suicide, or sexual abuse, sexual violence, rape, it's much more than that.<eos> I think it's a wonderful way the show ends, with Clay just taking a minute to acknowledge a woman in his life who he hasn't connected with in a while.<eos> And it's those small steps, which I think can make a big difference.<eos> [Dr. Hsu] I've seen that make a difference, and I've had people actually on their way to harm themselves kind of stall because they were thrown off because somebody was nice.<eos> And I think that's where it starts.<eos> It just starts with reaching out to people. You know, saying, "Hey, what's up?<eos> You matter to me.<eos> I'm glad you're in my world."
We were terrible together. And now we have these two happy kids.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Plus, she had this new thing going with Chuck, the owner of the Fairwick Hotel next door.<eos> But eventually, Raf won her over.<eos> Yeah, he can be pretty relentless.<eos> Which brings me to his sister, Luisa.<eos> See, he didn't quite trust her, or her new girlfriend, Eileen.<eos> If you want to be in my sister's life, we need to do some medical tests.<eos> And it turns out, Raf was right to be suspicious, because...<eos> You do realize, when you pass this medical exam, you leave the country.<eos> Or I will have you killed, make no mistake.
You remember that Rose had just threatened to kill her if anyone figured out their scheme.<eos> Oh, you have a twin or something?<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It was her or Scott.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So she ditched him.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Do not touch the prisoner.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - GUARD: Time's up.<eos> I told you you could trust me.
There is no way anyone goes into a drunken blackout off a little peach schnapps. You were roofied.<eos> The night my beloved Scott died, you text me from his phone.<eos> He was never breaking up with me.<eos> He was always loving me.<eos> So now, I play same phone trick on you.<eos> And it all comes kruh Se uzavrel.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or, "full circle," as it were.<eos> Which unfortunately brings us here.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I told you to leave.
She wants to bring me dinner.<eos> - Well, can't win 'em all.<eos> - I thought you were past that with Ivy.<eos> You two seemed to get along.<eos> Not as well as you and Amanda in the kitchen.<eos> - What did you say to her?<eos> - I may have simply put her on notice about using you to get information back to Stinger Senior.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Because I'm trying to protect all our asses, Linus.<eos> Who asked you to?
"What's wrong, Achilles?" "My mom didn't dip my heel.<eos> She's so stupid.<eos> She ruined it."<eos> Fuck you, Achilles, you Greek dick.<eos> I hate the way people talk about their mothers.<eos> I was watching a football game, and this guy scored a bunch of shit, whatever, and they were excited.<eos> So, they asked him about it afterwards.<eos> And the football player said, "My mom died last year, but I know she was watching my game from heaven tonight."<eos> And I wanted to be there to say, "Leave your mother alone.<eos> How dare you.
- You assholes!<eos> Whoever puked in my cell, I'm gonna make ya mop it up and suck on the mop!<eos> Oh, man!<eos> - Goddamn it!<eos> - Seriously.<eos> Oh, you think that's funny, you shit-heel?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> I'm just a sucker for physical comedy.<eos> Daaaamn!<eos> Remind me never to rent you a mule.
All of you, out!<eos> Not so fast, shamus.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Hey, not that it should matter, but I was a Tanker.<eos> 761st Tank Battalion.<eos> Wait.<eos> Patton's Panthers?<eos> You guys saved our asses at the bulge.<eos> - Well, now I feel like an asshole.<eos> Well, can't help you with that.
"On second thought, to make this happen, we're going to need a finger."<eos> Nobody has ever said, "To make this happen, we're going to need a finger."<eos> Oh, you'd be surprised.<eos> The last thing I wanted to get mixed up in is a kidnapping, even one as phony as a three-dollar bill.<eos> Because doing a stretch in jail would be the least of my worries.<eos> Vandertunts have enough juice in this town to make sure I never even see the inside of a cell.<eos> So I am not looking forward to this.<eos> Plus I bet that creepy old joint's as haunted as Mrs. Muir's twat. Hmm.<eos> I know, right?<eos> Oh, also, when I said I'd take you to the bus station... [tires screeching] [man yells] [exclaiming] [laughing]
You didn't even have feet!<eos> Now look at you, walking around on new legs, with hands that can crush steel...<eos> And, I mean, don't try it right now, obviously, but...<eos> Look at me!<eos> I'm a Goddamn freak!<eos> And I don't know who I'm gonna kill first, you or that son of a bitch Len Trexler.<eos> Well, first of all, it's "whom."<eos> Uh, no, it isn't.<eos> It absolutely is. Doesn't matter.<eos> But if it'll help you decide, this serum, which is sort of the key to the whole deal, I call factor-K.
Man, I gotta warn Trexler Dutch wants to kill him.<eos> Mainly because Trexler hasn't paid me for my work yet, but... also because... say what you will about der robotik ubermenschen.<eos> Sure can punch good.<eos> I'm sorry, darlin', but you're gonna have to repeat that.<eos> I said, "I had a little towel, "but I lost it walking here, so I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle."<eos> Oh, is that all? Yeah.<eos> That oughta do it.<eos> You, uh, sure you don't need me to, uh, check your oil?<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> And by that remark, I assume you're referring either to my robotic limbs or offering to plunge your finger, and/or penis, into my anus.
No.<eos> What, the potato compart... no.<eos> Spud box?<eos> No!<eos> Tater hutch.<eos> Rrrrrgh! I knew we'd get there eventually.<eos> Can we eventually get to Trexler's?<eos> I mean, presumably.<eos> Ugh! I swear to god...<eos> Poovey, if you don't shut up...
I mean, presumably.<eos> Ugh! I swear to god...<eos> Poovey, if you don't shut up...<eos> - No, you shut up!<eos> - Come on! Wait!<eos> It's not too late to turn back.<eos> Yes. It is.<eos> And why the hell are you so desperate for money?<eos> Because you know how much it's gonna cost to send a kid to Stanford in 1967?<eos> I know if you don't shut up, you won't have to worry about it, because I'm gonna shoot you in the... genitals!
You guys looking to say some prayers this time of night?<eos> Don't screw with me, Swagger.<eos> If the tables were turned, she'd sell you out for a bag of almonds.<eos> Don't you mean heroin?<eos> We have standing orders to hold her in our custody.<eos> No, your orders were to hold her until we came and got her, dumbass.<eos> Great.<eos> As soon as I hear from my superior officer, she's all yours.<eos> Playtime's over, Jarhead.<eos> Why don't you step aside and let the big boys do their job, yeah?
Jose!<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Ah, sounds like you got your nephew killed - when you sent him to him.<eos> - He's the fu... ing devil.<eos> Trailer park by the on-ramp to Route 3.<eos> - What the hell was that?<eos> - Got what we needed.<eos> Do you wanna die?<eos> We're not friends. What do you care?
And you're Kurt Zehnder, former member of the 8113.<eos> Not former.<eos> 8113 is for life.<eos> Is that why you've been pretending to be dead?<eos> It's the only way to get stuff done.<eos> And if you're really a friend of Swagger's, he'll know exactly what I'm talking about.<eos> How long you been in here?<eos> That bottle you broke over me? Wasn't water, let's just say that.<eos> Safe to say we could both use a shower.<eos> Which I can get you, by the way.
He's not.<eos> He's laying low.<eos> Tell him to stay that way.<eos> Who is "they," Zehnder?<eos> No. No, we gotta move.<eos> if you were able to find me, it's only a matter of time before they can.<eos> Is that music?<eos> Alexi.<eos> Bob Lee Swagger, as I live and breathe.<eos> Last time I saw you, there were two dead guys in my cell.
If Solotov knew all his targets were here, why send the JV?<eos> Maybe he had a higher value target in mind.<eos> Zehnder better never stop running.<eos> It's me.<eos> Zehnder, you there?<eos> Zehnder, you there?<eos> I would not have thought to come back here. Very clever.<eos> Zehnder?<eos> You were the best of them.<eos> Do not beat yourself up too bad, Swagger. You can only be in so many places at once.
Who knew covering ourselves with purple goo could have a downside?<eos> I know. We'll use our arms.<eos> [groans] They're all weak from not being used enough.<eos> Yeah. Also, mine were pretty weak to begin with.<eos> You know, I'm starting to think that all this slakking wasn't a great idea.<eos> Or rather, it was a great idea with a bad part that we didn't think of.<eos> [Eep] We did it!<eos> Now, let's move.<eos> How'd you get clean?<eos> I hate you, you dumb goo.
Oh-hh! Or is it time for a tummy rub?<eos> Okay, yes, he ate Not Food, but that was a while ago.<eos> He's changed.<eos> Have you learned nothing? Of course not. It's me.<eos> [grunting] [groaning] [screams] I'll just do both!<eos> I'm sorry, Not Food.<eos> [gasps] Okay, one last time.<eos> [grunts] [sighs]<eos> [whimpers]<eos> Like how I snuck out to message you, or how Lerk was being weird, but, like, not in the fun way she's usually weird.
[grunts]<eos> Well, don't... uh... Thank goodness I was here.<eos> [Old Man Root humming]<eos> So, what's he doing exactly, besides making me wish I'd lost even more of my hearing? Uh, I don't know.<eos> But Old Man Root is an expert in old weird stuff. Uh... which doesn't apply to you at all.<eos> Saved it, Thunk, yeah.<eos> I'm studying your energy.<eos> - [sniffs] - Ugh!<eos> Breathing in your essence and... Ow!<eos> How's that supposed to tell you how old I am? Oh, it's not. This is for my bald spot.
- This wasn't the first test, Grug. - [screams]<eos> Okay, so it may be deadly, or it may be the cure.<eos> What we need is to test it, and there's only one man for the job.<eos> - Is there a second man for the job?<eos> This goo will either cure you, or, uh, well... there's this pile of pigrats back there.<eos> It's kinda hard to explain.<eos> You really need to see 'em with your eyes.<eos> Anything to help the valley.<eos> And, hey, if it turns me into a pigrat like those guys, I can live with that.<eos> [all cheering] Either way, buddy, I forgive you for releasing the super bugs.
Quickest way to the ravine is through the Garden of Eatin'.<eos> We gotta hurry.<eos> That jerk moon'll come soon and eat all the light.<eos> Good news, then.<eos> This fella says there's a shortcut past that tree.<eos> - This is why we don't listen to worms.<eos> Hey, I know.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Calling a winged cheetah to ride so we can get there fast and in style.<eos> All the predators will hear you.
Where my worms at?<eos> Thanks, pals.<eos> Friendship!<eos> I'm never washing this hand again.<eos> And that is for calling Eep a loser!<eos> [groaning] [cheering] We made it!<eos> I mean, [monotone] we have survived.<eos> Hoorah.<eos> Lerk, that was amazing!<eos> I'm sorry I asked you to crank down your youness.
So what did you do when it all got to be too much?<eos> Alcohol.<eos> That's not really an option for me.<eos> Having people around me that I could trust didn't hurt, either.<eos> What?<eos> I'm sure it's nothing.<eos> I need to extract some blood.<eos> I'll go get my kit.<eos> What happened?<eos> You don't remember?
I had to rip the Band-Aid off at some point.<eos> Couldn't fight this war from the hybrid zone forever.<eos> Now come on, let's get the band back together, huh?<eos> There he is.<eos> Our very own Mr. Spock.<eos> Like in part two when he dies, and then part three... Yeah, I-I get the reference.<eos> You know, when I found out that you let Max raise my kid,<eos> I almost went back into the grave...<eos> I can't...<eos> Even a pack of wild razorbacks couldn't keep you down.
Yeah, listen, I'm already aware of your whole, "he puts the lotion in the basket" situation downstairs, so... it's a little late to save your reputation.<eos> Okay.<eos> There are two Shepherds that I haven't been able to track down.<eos> One is Mr. Duncan, who is a ghost, and the other is The Falcon, who is apparently ascended to the upper echelons of power.<eos> But, after all this time, The Falcon has remained out of reach.<eos> Is that a Tom Collins?<eos> Since when is that your drink?<eos> Well, a few things have changed in the last ten years.<eos> Yeah, I noticed.<eos> What happened to you?
If we let this deadline pass, that choice is gone and we lose our only chance of getting Isaac back.<eos> I don't understand men like you.<eos> World hangs over an abyss and yet you protect order.<eos> Imagine you find it honorable.<eos> Band playing on while the Titanic sinks into the cold depths.<eos> But honor is a lie you tell yourself.<eos> I think you're afraid.<eos> I think you enforce that order because you don't know what else to do.<eos> Suppose it gave you purpose.<eos> Lucky for me... it also gave you this.
We need to take a little walk.<eos> Okay, what are we doing?<eos> - Mansdale? - Oh, look.<eos> The coward son of Oz.<eos> Talk again and I cut your eye out.<eos> This is what I've been protecting you from.<eos> What are you talking about? Protecting me?<eos> Why do the Shepherd hunters think you're in Asia?<eos> Who scrubbed your photo from every server on the planet?<eos> The only thing keeping you on this side of a cage or worse is me.
Wrap it in tinfoil.<eos> Use the copper wire to...<eos> Yeah, I got it.<eos> Make it all electric-y.<eos> Okay, we're close.<eos> That thing's pretty slick.<eos> Dr. Abe just whipped it up in a matter of minutes.<eos> You must be impressed.<eos> Well, it's not that amazing.<eos> You jealous of somebody out-sciencing you?
No matter how messy it gets, we're still a family.<eos> You, me, Jamie, Dariela, Mitch...<eos> Clem.<eos> What's going on, Abe?<eos> What aren't you telling me?<eos> I need to find Dariela.<eos> Abe, we need to talk.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Just, uh, use the electrical tape and the lemon juice, okay?<eos> Abe, there's something I need to tell you.
We need to leave now.<eos> We're either gonna need a whole lot of lemon juice or a whole new plan.<eos> Guess that means new plan.<eos> Wh-What?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> ! It was worth a shot.<eos> Was it?<eos> I have another idea.<eos> Okay, we're good.<eos> What do you think, middle of the Atlantic?
Help!<eos> Baldur!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Admiring your tasteful decor.<eos> You don't spend much time here, do you?<eos> Get out.<eos> You're not still upset about our little misunderstanding, are you?<eos> You wanted to kill me.<eos> Prepared.<eos> I was prepared to kill you.
I just have to pack a bag.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We found his place.<eos> This guy, Liz, he's a special kind of strange.<eos> Take photos.<eos> I want to see everything.<eos> Hey, let me call you back when I get to the safe house. Bye.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Just be still.<eos> I'd like to ask you to turn around.
That's your name, isn't it?<eos> Edgar Grant?<eos> How do you know that?<eos> The FBI raided your house this morning.<eos> So, if you hurt me, you'll only make it worse for yourself and your family when you're arrested.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Oh, I'm a debt collector.<eos> My client wants what you owe him.<eos> And he hired me to make you pay.
I agree.<eos> I'm just not at all sure of the right way.<eos> And depending on the way, whether I'd be up to it.<eos> I need to look her in the face and see if I still recognize her.<eos> Raymond, she has gone too far.<eos> All to prove that you have gone too far.<eos> She can't see what she's become.<eos> What if I'm the one who can't see?<eos> No, Raymond.<eos> Remember why you surrendered yourself to the FBI in the first place.
I need to look her in the face and see if I still recognize her.<eos> Raymond, she has gone too far.<eos> All to prove that you have gone too far.<eos> She can't see what she's become.<eos> What if I'm the one who can't see?<eos> No, Raymond.<eos> Remember why you surrendered yourself to the FBI in the first place.<eos> Remember what all of this was about.<eos> You can't give up now.<eos> You can't let Kate destroy everything that gives you purpose.
I guarantee you won't be harmed.<eos> I'm closer than your people and the FBI.<eos> I'm handling this myself.<eos> If something goes wrong...<eos> You'll what?<eos> Shoot me? Again? Please be careful, Kate.<eos> No need for alarm, Edgar.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where's Tyson Pryor?<eos> I'm sorry to have misled you, but Tyson Pryor didn't hire you.
Well, I guess being a monomaniacal prick has its benefits.<eos> You're all that, except for the monomaniacal part.<eos> Ressler.<eos> Liz is in trouble.<eos> Talk to me. I know where she is, and I've got backup.<eos> But you need to be there.<eos> Forget the suspension.<eos> Look, just text me the address, all right?<eos> It's another case.<eos> You don't have to explain.
- Forget about it.<eos> All right.<eos> It's all good.<eos> You lied.<eos> You said you were trapped in steerage on a ship.<eos> I thought I was, until I was able to trade one of my last supply routes in the Balkans for a ride on prince Hajjar's jet.<eos> You had me kidnapped.<eos> You put Agnes at risk.<eos> Agnes was never at risk.<eos> And I gave explicit instructions you were not to be harmed in any way.
Untie me.<eos> I said untie me.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> She's on her way here now, thinking she's going to save me.<eos> I assume so, yes.<eos> And you're going to kill her.<eos> As I said, that's entirely up to her.<eos> I want to believe there's another way.<eos> After everything that's happened?<eos> What could she possibly say to convince you?
They've got overwatch. I count three.<eos> Everyone, hold your positions.<eos> Hello, Raymond.<eos> Said the fly to the spider.<eos> We go where our hearts take us.<eos> Yours took you to Elizabeth.<eos> And yours kidnapped her.<eos> Thank you, Raymond, for proving my point better than I ever could.<eos> You underestimate yourself, Kate.<eos> The deaths you've caused in the name of crippling me have been more than adequate to prove what you've become.
Did-- did everyone get one of these?<eos> It's illegal to tell a target of an investigation that you've been called to testify.<eos> Keep it to yourself.<eos> Knock, knock!<eos> Brimley. At last, a friendly face.<eos> Here. Here.<eos> Two rabbits.<eos> There's a woman in the other room.<eos> I need you to get her to divulge the name and the address of Kaplan's new driver.<eos> I'm skipping euchre with the Saltmans to tell you this face-to-face--
I'm just-- I'm proud of the work that we've done here.<eos> Proud of facilitating a criminal empire?<eos> A necessary evil.<eos> Maybe, but if we're being honest, some of the blood he's spilled is on our hands.<eos> I agree with Ressler, and with Aram.<eos> I'm proud and I'm ashamed.<eos> And one day, when they teach a course on Reddington's task force at Quantico, we can do a panel and debate the pros and cons.<eos> But right now, we need to get Kate Kaplan.<eos> Kaplan?<eos> I think you missed the part about Julian Gale.
- Nuts?<eos> - Probably macadamias.<eos> When stolen, uh, by truckload, they're actually quite lucrative, so...<eos> Uh, fun fact.<eos> Any known associates?<eos> He has a kid brother in prison.<eos> Mecklenburg Correctional.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I told you, we're gonna need him--<eos> Reddington hired the Debt Collector to kidnap you.
If you're right and we don't go to jail, does the bureau take us back?<eos> When it's over, where do we go to get our reputations back?<eos> I wish I knew.<eos> Aram won't testify against us.<eos> They gave him immunity.<eos> How did they know to do that?<eos> Gale only knew about us, not aram.<eos> I can't protect you.<eos> It's my job to do that and I can't do it.<eos> We're only here because of reddington, because he shot kaplan for trying to help you.
That here we are, at the end, and we still don't know why he walked into your life that day.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To do something I should have done a long time ago.<eos> Once kaplan testifies, an indictment is inevitable.<eos> Cooper tried to shut it down.<eos> Harold has to work within the system.<eos> Henry Prescott does not.<eos> Who's Henry Prescott?<eos> A man who knows how to bury problems.<eos> If you find yourself up against impossible odds due to poor judgment, Henry Prescott's the man you want on speed dial.
I loved you, Raymond.<eos> Kate!<eos> No!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't think I had a choice.<eos> They said they were gonna revoke my immunity agreement if I didn't cooperate.<eos> They threatened me so I... I gave you up.<eos> I'm sorry, you what?<eos> When I testified before the grand jury...<eos> Hang on, didn't samar tell you?
She loved you so much.<eos> And now she's gone. Just like Sam. And my mom.<eos> I hope you get the answer you're looking for.<eos> Agent mojtabai.<eos> It's good to have you back.<eos> Welcome. Thank you, sir.<eos> That means a lot.<eos> You got out.<eos> When you came to see me in jail, why didn't you tell me Janet was the reason I was in there?<eos> Because, I saw that she was making you happy.
Broke is such a harsh word.<eos> I prefer illiquid.<eos> What was so awful that you withheld the answer to a question I've been wondering my entire life?<eos> Were you afraid I'd turn out like you?<eos> Because, guess what?<eos> I am like you.<eos> All those times you asked me to think like a criminal, was it a test to see how naturally it came to me?<eos> Because it did come naturally.<eos> And that terrifies me.<eos> Elizabeth, if you need to walk away...
I heard something.<eos> Is it the Feds?<eos> Why did you let me drink so much?<eos> You're off tomorrow.<eos> Relax.<eos> - Do you think Leighton fancies you?<eos> - Leighton?<eos> Do you not see the way he looks at you?<eos> How could he not fancy you?<eos> What do you think the monster's doing now?
- Did he?<eos> Said Marr always made him feel uncomfortable.<eos> Not the only one.<eos> Is Kieran at home?<eos> I'm a friend.<eos> From college.<eos> He's with his brother.<eos> Can I say hi?<eos> In you come.<eos> Somebody to see you, Kieran.
How did that work?<eos> It worked fine.<eos> Here, you contribute, you're in.<eos> - Everybody loved him.<eos> - Well, somebody didn't.<eos> - All right?<eos> The beauty of nature.<eos> It bores the living shit out of me.<eos> Craig...<eos> Craig, what happened to you yesterday, you need to talk about it.
Have you ever thought about getting any help with that?<eos> Jonjo's phone's just ringing out.<eos> Fucking Food Standards.<eos> Been on hold 20 minutes.<eos> - Did you hear what I said?<eos> - Yeah, I heard.<eos> You don't think I've enough to deal with?<eos> Can you not leave that?<eos> We've got to find out what he's done with his pills.<eos> What do you think he's done, Nicole?
We could have the killer's handwriting.<eos> His first mistake.<eos> We've a missing teenager, Jonjo Patterson.<eos> Our communications officer is organising an immediate appeal for tomorrow.<eos> - Jonjo...<eos> - One simple message.<eos> Help us find this boy.<eos> John Joseph Patterson, known as Jonjo, is a vulnerable 18-year-old student.<eos> He was last seen at the family home around 10:00 a.m. yesterday morning.<eos> My message to Jonjo would be, there's nothing for you to worry about.
I spent 20 years talking about what I did.<eos> And therapy helped you understand why you did those things.<eos> A wound doesn't heal if you keep opening it up.<eos> I don't want to mention the car.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Evie?<eos> _<eos> Why didn't you show me this last night?<eos> - Well, you were asleep.<eos> - Since when did that bother you?
If that's what you think, why'd you keep me on the team?<eos> I'm trying to figure that out.<eos> I went into Marr's house to look for Jonjo.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Our friend?<eos> I don't need you judging me.<eos> He had photos of Bethan on his laptop.<eos> - Kieran, Dr. Marr...<eos> - Yeah, I heard you.<eos> Does that not creep you out?
Why?<eos> You know what's funny?<eos> My father never told me about you.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Robert Oz kept many secrets.<eos> Especially from his children.<eos> You don't have to do this, Abigail.<eos> Whatever your plan is, it's not too late.<eos> Tell me how to stop the hybrids, and I will help you.<eos> Jackson, do you really think I brought you here so that we could have a hearttoheart?
You'll find everything you need inside.<eos> Welcome aboard.<eos> This was good.<eos> This was never the problem.<eos> But we have each other again.<eos> So you think everything's back to normal?<eos> Isaac is back.<eos> Reiden is behind us.<eos> And we can begin to be a family again.<eos> What does that look like to you?
Hey!<eos> Kenyatta vs. Kenyatta.<eos> Say "mercy," say "mercy."<eos> You have to relent.<eos> You have to.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Body slam!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Hey.<eos> I got to tell you, I do not think this is a great idea.
Hey.<eos> I got to tell you, I do not think this is a great idea.<eos> What method did you last attempt?<eos> - Neuro bypass.<eos> - Via?<eos> Swine. Wow.<eos> You're not a halfbad scientist.<eos> Well, thanks, Dad.<eos> Only took me dying and coming back to life for you to give me a little acknowledgement.<eos> Well... you say what you will, but I know my gadgets.
The plane's trying to conserve its battery.<eos> It's going into safe mode.<eos> Safe mode?<eos> It basically just files in a circle until we fix the problem.<eos> And there's the problem.<eos> It's probably just some faulty wiring, but give me a hand, will you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's an unexpected development.<eos> This is gonna sound weird, but do you know what I was doing last night?<eos> You can't remember?
That's it.<eos> Abe, get down here!<eos> Abe!<eos> Dariela!<eos> Starting to see some color blobs coming back.<eos> Max Morgan...<eos> Explorer, genius, lover.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> You just gave me some geriatric medicine.<eos> Hey, look, son, I know you're feeling guilty about what you did to Jamie.
Are we gonna start taking suggestions from DJ Logan now?<eos> Hang on.<eos> What auxiliary generator?<eos> If we create an independent power loop, this could actually work.<eos> The tank will lose power in five minutes.<eos> This might be our only option.<eos> Mitch?<eos> You all right?<eos> Your friends are surprisingly resourceful.<eos> They'll find a way to stop you.
Ready.<eos> Once I press this, that hybrid will be coming straight for us.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Jamie, we'll let you know as soon as the hybrid's loose.<eos> Fuel leak, loss of altitude.<eos> You could give in to your despair, your hatred.<eos> Use them.<eos> Wake the tiger.<eos> Have him tear out my throat.<eos> I have nothing to stop you.
Abigail?<eos> Can you help me?<eos> Mitch, Mitch, listen to me, okay?<eos> Do not listen to her.<eos> Do not listen to a word she tells you, okay?<eos> It's no use, Jackson.<eos> Mitch Morgan is gone.<eos> I'm on a plane, and all the people here, they're calling me "Mitch."<eos> No, you are Charles Duncan.<eos> The people there, whatever they are telling you, it is a lie.
This is happening.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm trying to figure out why.<eos> So we can come up with patriarchal nicknames later.<eos> Like way later.<eos> We've got a long road ahead of us.<eos> The team is heading back to pick us up.<eos> We need to dissolve this into a solution and then we should be ready to sedate your friend Abendegos.<eos> Great.<eos> Abe, how are you holding up with Isaac and everything?
You must hate him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And no.<eos> Part of me thinks that he couldn't help it.<eos> Between him and my sister, I'm beginning to think that there's something tainted in the Oz bloodline.<eos> Like, we're cursed.<eos> Jackson, you can't really believe that.<eos> Jackson.<eos> We're ready in the vehicle bay.<eos> When we land, I think that you should get as far away from me as possible.
Be careful, rafiki.<eos> Don't shoot unless I say so.<eos> Ready.<eos> Don't shoot.<eos> Little help here? !<eos> Okay, Leanne's in her office.<eos> Let's find out who killed her.<eos> If this turns out to be you, I'm gonna be very disappointed.<eos> It's over, Leanne.<eos> Robert would roll over in his grave if he knew what you'd become.
She's with Abe.<eos> He's going to examine her and the baby.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I should be there.<eos> - No.<eos> You should rest.<eos> I'm worried that that bio-drive in your head is what made you pass out.<eos> Bio-drive or not, I got to figure out what's going on with my daughter.<eos> Well, you can do it from here.<eos> There's years of science for you to catch up on.
I think we've found the kids.<eos> Yeah, radiation signatures are high upstate, so the kids should be there, and the Melvatox pills.<eos> Let's go get our son back.<eos> Good news.<eos> She's turned a corner.<eos> We should be able to pull her out soon.<eos> Good.<eos> Good job.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I hate to do this, but, uh, I have orders to keep you here.
Eat a cheeseburger in Maharashtra, and you'll find out what that shit is."<eos> He's like, "No, sir, you don't understand.<eos> I'm a Muslim.<eos> Her father doesn't know.<eos> If he finds out she is with a Muslim boy, he will never let her out of the house again.<eos> Please call the mother.<eos> She knows."<eos> "Fuck you, man!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> I was this close to killing you, bro.
-it's amazing.<eos> - Amazing.<eos> Hi!<eos> Now, as you say on Earth, dig in.<eos> Oh, it looks so good, you guys.<eos> Big Barda, we saved you a seat.<eos> Once a Fury, forever a Fury.<eos> Right?<eos> Ignore them.<eos> They're using known tactics to anger you.
I need some of Frost and lvy's anti-K mix.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> It's hero time.<eos> If you please, ladies.<eos> Huh?<eos> I lost it.<eos> I can help.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> If you get too close to it, it can hurt you.
My ankle!<eos> Stompa's win in the hand-to-hand combat round is a real smack down!<eos> And I'm not kiddin'!<eos> Somebody called for a kitten?<eos> Better say goodbye to your pals now.<eos> Korugar has this in the bag.<eos> The gulp-<eos> Wondy kicks the competition right in the kisser in the aerial obstacle race.<eos> I'll sing you a song to swear my allegiance<eos> H! tell you a tale of loyalty strong
Squik.<eos> Pow!<eos> Battle Bot on!<eos> How about you, partner?<eos> Ready to kick some robot butt.<eos> Suspicious activity in Sector H.<eos> You won't need to bring any of this to Korugar.<eos> It's all junk.<eos> This is not the junk.<eos> Don't you remember the great laughs of the hilarity we had this day at the Tamaran Zoo?
They said, "Just write about your life," so I said...<eos> Oh, thank you. Yeah.<eos> Yeah. It turned out to be the greatest comic novel ever written, but when it started it was supposed to be a memoir, you know? A...<eos> So it makes you think, "Well, what is my life?"<eos> So I started thinking about it, right?<eos> So I said, "OK, I wake up in the morning", and I eat some Count Chocula."<eos> And then I watch Sports Center while I'm digesting my Count Chocula, and I phone my friend Fat Freddie.<eos> And I go, "Hey."<eos> You want to eat a cheese sandwich or something around three o'clock?<eos> I... I got to wait for my Count Chocula to digest, "but how does that settle with you?"
But it's good, you know, not to lie, but it's very, very hard, you know, not lying, because you want people to like you and...<eos> Do know what I mean?<eos> You want to...<eos> All kinds of reasons to lie.<eos> I thought of a way of not lying, and I'll... I'll share it with you, if you like?<eos> You can tell the truth, word for word, absolutely true, but when you do it...<eos> You use a sarcastic accent.<eos> So I'll give you an example.<eos> Your wife goes, "Hey, I noticed at dinner you were looking at my sister."<eos> You're... You're not attracted to my sister, are you?"
I go, "Thanks.<eos> You're cool, too. I love you."<eos> "I love you more than anything!" "I love you, too."<eos> "Remember yesterday when you threw that bone and it turned out to be a rubber bone?"<eos> "Yeah, it was a joke. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."<eos> "I wasn't! I wasn't!<eos> I was laughing. It was funny."<eos> "Oh, you love me so much, and I love you."<eos> This is the greatest thing. "I'm just going to kiss you and kiss you forever."<eos> I go, "Yes, you can do that." "I'm just going to keep kissing you."
I grew up here.<eos> Like, Pioneer...<eos> I grew up here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But Davis was, like, super white.<eos> Kind of like tonight.<eos> Roll call was a problem. It was a big deal for a lot of us.<eos> - Like, what's your name?<eos> - Jasura.<eos> Okay. What would you get?
Your son just won the Scripps National Spelling Bee.<eos> Look at his brother.<eos> His brother is like, "I'm fucked. I'm fucked.<eos> The bar is way too high.<eos> I should kill myself."<eos> People say, "Where's Bobby Jindal from?"<eos> That's where he comes from.<eos> That is an Indian sociopath.<eos> I know what happens when I talk about this.<eos> People say, "Your parents don't love you."
He's here to surprise me.<eos> Turn left. Turn left.<eos> Turn... left."<eos> Then he turns right, and I'm like, "Home Depot?<eos> No!"<eos> I'm like, "Why are we here?<eos> Do you know what day it is?"<eos> "It's Saturday."<eos> "No, it's my birthday.<eos> Did you forget?"
I'm like, "I'm in Honors Gov, I have it right here.<eos> Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.<eos> All men created equal."<eos> It says it right here, I'm equal.<eos> I'm equal.<eos> I don't deserve this.<eos> But as soon as I say that...<eos> He looks at me like I believe in Santa. "Hasan, you'll never understand."<eos> "I'll never understand?<eos> Dad, you're the guy that will argue with the cashier at Costco when he doesn't let you return used underwear. And now you want to be the bigger man?
But as soon as I say that...<eos> He looks at me like I believe in Santa. "Hasan, you'll never understand."<eos> "I'll never understand?<eos> Dad, you're the guy that will argue with the cashier at Costco when he doesn't let you return used underwear. And now you want to be the bigger man?<eos> Now you're like, 'Let's be reasonable with the bigots.' What?"<eos> And then he just walks back into the house with glass in his feet.<eos> And I honestly don't know who is more right.<eos> Maybe he's right.<eos> Put your head down.<eos> Be a doctor, get a house in the burbs, let them call them whatever you want.
I'm walking up to the doorstep, and I'm about to ring the doorbell when I'm like, "Wait.<eos> 30 second time-out.<eos> Do you understand what's about to go down?<eos> You're about to go to prom with Bethany motherfucking Reed."<eos> "This is the American dream.<eos> This is what Dad fought for."<eos> Ding-dong. Mrs Reed opens the door.<eos> She has this look of concern.<eos> And I look over her shoulder, and I see Jeff Burke putting a corsage on Bethany's wrist.<eos> And she's like, "Oh, my God, honey, did Bethany not tell you?
I have to tell him stories.<eos> So I'm telling him stories about my life, he's telling me stories about his.<eos> So I tell him the prom story.<eos> He goes, "Hasan, I'm mad at you."<eos> "I know, I kissed a girl.<eos> I'll never do it again."<eos> He goes, "No... why don't you forgive Bethany?"<eos> He wanted to be the bigger person again.<eos> I was like, "Why?"<eos> "You know when I emigrated to this country in 1982, I thought if I let you go to a school dance, you would join a gang, get a girl pregnant and become a drug dealer, in one night.
I've got to drop the greatest status update."<eos> I run upstairs, open my laptop, fire up Facebook, and then I see this.<eos> You guys see this, right?<eos> Don't you know what this means?<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> I'm the cure for racism.<eos> I cured it.<eos> Alright, maybe I didn't cure it, but everyone has a purpose.<eos> Some people were put here to find a cure for cancer, or find a vaccine for Ebola.<eos> My life is definitive proof that once you go brown, you've got to lock that shit down.
Okay, this is only a little bit personal.<eos> Kirsten.<eos> What?<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I bounced from the stitch and everyone was gone.<eos> What is that smell?<eos> - Were we gassed?<eos> - Yeah, I think, maybe.<eos> What's the last thing you remember?
Look, I know the NSA told us to stay put, but...<eos> There's stuff between us that we haven't dealt with, and I'm... I'm not sure I want to right now.<eos> I understand.<eos> That's...<eos> But, you know, if we have to stay put, then it makes sense to stay put together.<eos> You sure?<eos> I have to admit this isn't the most inspired penne I have ever made, but then again, your pantry is also a foodie's worst nightmare.<eos> I know.<eos> It was Camille's night to get groceries.<eos> Has anything come back to you from before you woke up in the lab?
Do you think the NSA sent someone to watch us?<eos> Was that... "Mother"? Okay, I think this is the latest in a series of aftereffects from the knockout gas.<eos> You just need some rest.<eos> Our friends are missing, and I just saw someone peeping on us from outside.<eos> Yes, I know that, but you are very tired, and we are both very disoriented, so I think the best option right now is to get some rest, and come at this with a clear head in the morning.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> If you don't mind, could... could you sleep in my room tonight?
Wait.<eos> If you don't mind, could... could you sleep in my room tonight?<eos> Like on the floor?<eos> - Are you awake? - Hmm?<eos> Barely.<eos> What's up?<eos> I can't stop thinking about us.<eos> We've done so much together, it seems like we should know everything there is to know about each other, but after hearing you talk about your mother before,<eos> Speak for yourself.<eos> I think I know you pretty well.
Oh. Oh, yeah?<eos> What's my favorite movie? Mmm.<eos> Trick question.<eos> You don't have one.<eos> Now, good night.<eos> Well, when I was in middle school, what sport did I play?<eos> And why did I quit?<eos> Basketball.<eos> Ed Clark wanted you to try out because he thought it would help you be a team player, and even though you never wanted to go, you didn't quit.<eos> Until they kicked you off the team.
Feel anything, honey?<eos> When you find Mommy, you bring her back.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Kirsten.<eos> You were doing it.<eos> Oh. Again?<eos> What kind of dream was it?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I don't remember my dreams.<eos> - You don't?
You're right.<eos> That's not my business, is it?<eos> Look, I'd like to run some tests.<eos> See what's going on.<eos> So why don't we take a ride?<eos> We'll go back to my office.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, you didn't call me last night.<eos> Was I supposed to?<eos> Ah, to yell at me for springing my mother on you.
And...<eos> Okay. Here it is.<eos> Until two days before her "accidental" death, Officer Newcomb worked in the Air Force chemical research lab at Dreamland.<eos> She must be who Fred was with in the stitch.<eos> Uh-huh. All right.<eos> I'll see what I can find out about her.<eos> Great.<eos> I understand.<eos> The NSA won't budge, and there's still a hiring freeze.<eos> But it doesn't mean a spot won't open up for you down the road.
Harris, they've got missiles poised at the ready, and our governments are not talking to each other.<eos> You must know something about what's happening here.<eos> I know what you know.<eos> Retribution for what?<eos> Something called Atlas.<eos> Is it possible this has something to do with Project Atlas? I know you said<eos> - never to mention it...<eos> - Atlas is a dead program, Grace.<eos> The files were closed years ago.<eos> What would make you think that?
Yeah, the door to hell, where she belongs.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'll show her the door myself.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Welcome...<eos> Jillian.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> Excuse me one second, would you, please?<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> I mean, you know, I'm glad to see you.
Mwah. - Why did they...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You see what's going on with the news?<eos> It's crazy stuff? Yeah.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. What?<eos> What is it?<eos> You okay?<eos> Hey, hey. What's go... what's going on?<eos> Dad, there's, um... something important I need to tell you.
What is it?<eos> You okay?<eos> Hey, hey. What's go... what's going on?<eos> Dad, there's, um... something important I need to tell you.<eos> Hey, I just found a first edition Hemingway from a book dealer in Newton.<eos> Jillian.<eos> Laura.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'ml'm working here now.<eos> I thought your dad told you.
I got this photo from a reputable source.<eos> Supposedly, it's tied to a secret government program.<eos> Project Atlas.<eos> What is it?<eos> Maybe you should ask your boss.<eos> That's Tanz technology.<eos> Which means you're in the middle of something big.<eos> Dead center.<eos> With everything that's happening now, with Russia, I think it's all connected.<eos> What makes you say that?
No. They won't talk to the government.<eos> Maybe they'll talk to me.<eos> Grace, the world's about to catch fire, and we may be the only ones who can stop it.<eos> Are you coming or aren't you?<eos> What kind of meeting?<eos> Business with Darius Tanz.<eos> - But I can't...<eos> - You can't talk about it.<eos> You know, I really don't know why we talk at all.<eos> Zoe, look, I can't tell you what I'm working on right now, but there is something I can tell you.
Grace.<eos> I've said too much.<eos> I have my family to think about.<eos> Katya, wait.<eos> If we don't end this conflict, the entire human race will become extinct.<eos> They say that about every war.<eos> I'm not talking about a war.<eos> I'm talking about something much worse.<eos> What could be worse?<eos> There's something I need to tell you.
- Did they say who they got the photo from?<eos> No.<eos> But... whatever Atlas is, it nearly got me killed, Liam.<eos> A car came out of nowhere and hit me headon.<eos> Holy crap.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When I met you that first night, I started out just looking for a big story. But now I'm really just looking for the truth.<eos> So... what was that bruise that Jillian saw on you?<eos> Well, you know, I...<eos> I already told you.
Here, with my family.<eos> You.<eos> Okay, Tess.<eos> The hackers used a VPN to mask their IP address.<eos> Can you find it?<eos> Scanning now.<eos> Tess, what's up?<eos> The encryptions are multitiered.<eos> Come on.<eos> They haven't met you, though.
- Ravi?<eos> - Cue music.<eos> Ravi, music.<eos> [music starts]<eos> [George] Ravi, goddammit! Late!<eos> Late! Ravi, late! Excuse me.<eos> As soon as he says "1960's," you come in fast with the groovy music.<eos> Ravi, you got to hit that cue or he's gonna go bananas.<eos> No, no, I'll go banana bread on you, and it will be too dry to swallow.<eos> You ever fuck up one of his monologues again, and I will choke you out, Slumdog.
O. J. Simpson breaks his 45-year no-killing streak.<eos> O. J. Simpson kills those two people so hard, they stopped making the Ford Bronco.<eos> Can you imagine doing something so fucked up, there's no more Toyota Camry?<eos> Meanwhile on the East Coast,<eos> Sieg heil, Rudy Giuliani rules New York with his Gestapo-like tactics.<eos> Excuse me, the guy gets rid of all the pornography in Times Square, now you got to walk one block west to 8th Avenue?<eos> And now 8th Avenue is this cesspool.<eos> You go to 44th and 8th to that hand-job parlor?<eos> What's it called again, Shake Shack?<eos> [music stops] Oh, yeah, come in our Wacky Shack and we'll shake you off, and there's a line of goddamn families going out of there?
I am George St. Geegland and you are Gil Faizon, and this is over because you ruined it!<eos> Matthew Broderick is waiting right behind that door.<eos> Waiting to come out and act, and you ruined it!<eos> George, I'm a Peter Pan.<eos> I don't know when I'm gonna grow up or when I'm gonna go to the bathroom.<eos> It's what makes me so charmed, I'm sure.<eos> Except you're not charming, Gil.<eos> Richard Dreyfuss, he's charming.<eos> But you're an immature idiot.<eos> I can not believe the CBS people wanted to give you that voice-over job!
So, Evie, how was Jonjo at college?<eos> Did he get on with Mr. Petrie?<eos> Y-Yeah.<eos> You don't sound too sure.<eos> No, Mr. Petrie was cool with him.<eos> Cool as in?<eos> N-Nice.<eos> You were in class with him every day.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Evie, something you think might be trivial could actually turn out to be crucial.
- You just stood there.<eos> - Nah.<eos> I'm not having that.<eos> I kept the edge.<eos> You couldn't have done it without me.<eos> Mate, I was messed up, and I used you.<eos> You?<eos> You haven't got it in you.<eos> You want me to prove myself, yeah?<eos> Show you what I picked up in prison?
- Nah.<eos> I'm not having that.<eos> I kept the edge.<eos> You couldn't have done it without me.<eos> Mate, I was messed up, and I used you.<eos> You?<eos> You haven't got it in you.<eos> You want me to prove myself, yeah?<eos> Show you what I picked up in prison?<eos> I want you to take the money and go!
- See you later.<eos> - See you.<eos> - Where'd you come from?<eos> - Evie all right?<eos> Did the cops ask you about Mr. Petrie?<eos> A bit.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just wondered.<eos> How much do you get for those?
I made a mistake, but I'm gonna sort it.<eos> When?<eos> What...<eos> What mistake?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna tie it off right now.<eos> What mistake, Tench?<eos> I let slip my name to your mate Alan.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm not letting them put you away again.
Don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna tie it off right now.<eos> What mistake, Tench?<eos> I let slip my name to your mate Alan.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm not letting them put you away again.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Tench.<eos> Shit.<eos> Don't let the bastard get to you, Blake!
- What an idiot.<eos> - I know, but if you want in, you should call him right now.<eos> - All right, see you later, Mom.<eos> - Bye. Good night, Lane.<eos> Hey, I'll feed him tomorrow if you two want to sleep in.<eos> Mom, I love you.<eos> Bye, Mom.<eos> It's Friday night.<eos> I don't know. What?<eos> I thought you said you were feeling better.
If you were able to fight back, could you describe what you'd like to do to him?<eos> Hey.<eos> What the hell are you doing? !<eos> I was just... looking for my phone.<eos> Here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Is Petrie gonna press charges?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> Am I sacked?<eos> What do you think?
Why do you want to see him?<eos> I'm visiting all senior students, letting them know it's business as usual.<eos> The geography department have planned a trip to the hydroelectric dam this afternoon.<eos> I just need to know how many are going.<eos> Could I just have a word with him?<eos> Mr. Petrie's here.<eos> No.<eos> As you were, please.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, Desmond do you have any idea how far from the shore you are?
It's the will of God.<eos> I've lost three babies.<eos> Three beautiful babies.<eos> - I'm sorry, Mum.<eos> - Come on.<eos> We need to give this one a chance.<eos> Our first grandchild.<eos> My waters haven't broken.<eos> I lied.<eos> Well, we're still gonna get you to hospital.
- I'm sorry, Mum.<eos> - Come on.<eos> We need to give this one a chance.<eos> Our first grandchild.<eos> My waters haven't broken.<eos> I lied.<eos> Well, we're still gonna get you to hospital.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Get you checked out.
- Come on.<eos> We need to give this one a chance.<eos> Our first grandchild.<eos> My waters haven't broken.<eos> I lied.<eos> Well, we're still gonna get you to hospital.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Get you checked out.<eos> - What did he do to you?
Jonjo, over here.<eos> So, Evie, how was Jonjo at college?<eos> Did he get on with Mr. Petrie?<eos> Mr. Petrie was cool with him.<eos> Cool as in?<eos> Nice.<eos> Mr. Petrie asked you quite intrusive questions<eos> - about your father.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And you didn't mind him asking you questions like that?
Craig Petrie was here.<eos> Answer your phone!<eos> I saw him in the house, I don't know about Dessie's room.<eos> Not exactly...<eos> I got some help.<eos> Stop lying, for God's sake!<eos> You knew what he'd do if he got off the leash.<eos> The evidence was wrong!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This is exactly why I could never tell you.
- I can come back if you...<eos> - No, no.<eos> I was just going.<eos> Don't let him leave until they change his dressing.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can't smile.<eos> I didn't bring you anything.<eos> I thought about bringing you grapes, but it's a bit of a cliché.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you feeling?
Thanks.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Hello.<eos> Blake Albrighton.<eos> It's D.S. Redford.<eos> I need to talk to you about Dessie and Petrie.<eos> Are you ready to tell me why the police suspected you?<eos> I told you.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> How can I help you if you close yourself off like this?
I can only guess what you're feeling.<eos> But I need to know...<eos> Did you have an affair with Niall Swift?<eos> What?<eos> Where are you getting this from?<eos> I read the letter...<eos> "Leave the money where you used to meet Niall Swift."<eos> That was just someone trying to scare me.<eos> Stop lying, for God's sake!<eos> I watched you when the police were asking about Niall's phone.
Your aunt won't mind?<eos> Nah, she'd love it.<eos> Australia.<eos> Come on.<eos> You don't sound too sure.<eos> Mr. Petrie was cool with him.<eos> Mr. Petrie was cool with him.<eos> Mr. Petrie asked you quite intrusive questions<eos> - about your father.<eos> - Yeah. And you didn't mind him asking you questions like that?
Yes.<eos> Kieran?<eos> Hello?<eos> Mrs. Whitehead?<eos> Okay. Right, bye.<eos> Love you.<eos> Bye.<eos> Kieran.<eos> My aunt's totally cool with it.<eos> Says she can't wait to meet you.
They're bored. Their standards of entertainment are low.<eos> We got to get down there.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I'm okay here.<eos> What's going on, man?<eos> Why are you wrapped up like a skinny burrito?<eos> There was an incident... on the bus.<eos> I caused a scene.<eos> Dude, I'm sorry.<eos> You know what might make you feel better, though?
It was wrong.<eos> I've been so angry, and I've been holding it over you for so long.<eos> And I'm done. I'm done doing that.<eos> He needs you. I need you.<eos> And... I'm sorry.<eos> You don't have to say sorry.<eos> Why don't we do this? Why don't we just have a clean slate... for both of us?<eos> Clean slate.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
It's definitely been two minutes. I have to go.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can you come get me?<eos> This is a good igloo.<eos> Way better than his last one.<eos> So what's going on here, Sam?<eos> I mean, you show up with my necklace and soaking wet.<eos> I mean, what do you want?<eos> Do you want to get back together?<eos> I want to try to explain, but I might have to talk about animals, and I know that annoys you sometimes.
Once upon a time, a cat was trapped in a book.<eos> Hello?<eos> Where are you?<eos> I am everywhere.<eos> You may call me... the Storyteller.<eos> Did you say I'm trapped in a book?<eos> Yes.<eos> And in this book, I control everything.<eos> Almost.<eos> For I am compelled by Eldritch forces beyond my Ken to offer some choices to you.
I am everywhere.<eos> You may call me... the Storyteller.<eos> Did you say I'm trapped in a book?<eos> Yes.<eos> And in this book, I control everything.<eos> Almost.<eos> For I am compelled by Eldritch forces beyond my Ken to offer some choices to you.<eos> Choices that affect your destiny.<eos> I am not following you.<eos> It means that sometimes I'm going to let you choose what will happen.
I think I'd also like to see the angry bears.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my...<eos> You know, I think I'd also like to see an interpretive dance.<eos> What?<eos> What is this?<eos> What are we doing?<eos> I am not even in this.<eos> I kinda like that.<eos> Obviously I am just messing with you.
But, no.<eos> A kiss.<eos> A kiss would make a better story.<eos> Very well.<eos> Before we do this, there are some things you should know.<eos> Yes?<eos> Yes.<eos> Eh... First, I ate some blue cheese earlier today, so I apologize for my breath.<eos> Second, I am real and you are not.<eos> What makes you think you're real?
I mean, we had a romantic kiss, and you cannot get any more ending-y than that.<eos> No, of course this isn't the end.<eos> What?<eos> Why am I laughing?<eos> This isn't funny.<eos> That was only the end of this story.<eos> There will be another and another and another, forever!<eos> No!<eos> No Little Bo Peep. I have had enough of you, Storyteller.<eos> Whoever you are, I am going to get you!
At my core, I'm fiscally conservative."<eos> You ever been in your backyard at night, and you just look up at that endless sky and you just wonder what it's all about?<eos> Here we are, on a rock, floating through space.<eos> Whatever this even is.<eos> We don't even know how we got here.<eos> We don't know where we're going.<eos> We don't even currently know what this is that we exist in.<eos> You see those stars up there, and they're not even there.<eos> It's just we're finally seeing the light from those stars.<eos> And just something like that is so mind-blowing, you just want to yell out to the heavens...
"No, Mom, but thanks for everything you do."<eos> In second grade, Madison Gold gave me a valentine with a picture of a western honeybee on it that said "Bee mine." Bee.<eos> I didn't understand why the word "be" was misspelled, but she was nice and explained it to me.<eos> That's the first joke I ever learned.<eos> Hey, Madison. Bee mine.<eos> Um... what?<eos> Would you like to go on a date?<eos> That's so nice, but I'm busy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait. I didn't tell you when the date is.
I don't. My mom does.<eos> Doesn't your mom pick out your clothes?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I think maybe it's time to start picking out your own clothes.<eos> But... how?<eos> There are so many clothes.<eos> And different colors and patterns and sizes.<eos> This shirt is called "fog gray,"<eos> but fog isn't even a color... it's translucent.<eos> Just pick something that feels like you.
Maybe you should get going.<eos> Dad!<eos> Can we have a second?<eos> Yeah. I'll be in the car.<eos> What the hell?<eos> I say that to you.<eos> What are you doing? Coming home early. All up in my face.<eos> Acting like Mom. You know, I love your mom, but that's a low blow.<eos> Okay, I justYou know, I get worried about you.<eos> I don't want you distracted. I don't want you to screw up your track career.
I just... I can't believe that my dad would leave us.<eos> Like, why?<eos> Was he having an affair?<eos> Or, like, does he have, like, a whole other family somewhere else?<eos> Just, it feels so unlike him.<eos> I'm sorry that I even brought it up. I should've never said anything.<eos> No, I mean, I'm glad that I know.<eos> I thought that we were so close.<eos> Like, who abandons their family?<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, my dad's got a gambling problem.
Where'd you go?<eos> I went to Grandpa's cabin.<eos> And... first, he wanted me to build an addition to the house, and... and I just stayed.<eos> I built a stupid fire pit and...<eos> I drank beers, and it was...<eos> It sucked.<eos> I'm embarrassed that it even happened.<eos> I can't believe that you left us.<eos> I know, but I'm sorry, okay?<eos> And you know I love you so much.
You know, I think this would make the perfect centerpiece for a new exhibit I'm putting together for the Smithsonian.<eos> Perhaps you would allow them to display it, on loan?<eos> You know, it's a funny thing.<eos> I've had this rock for years.<eos> No fuss, no fanfare.<eos> But then, just yesterday, Ivan Petrenko made me an eightfigure offer for the paperweight.<eos> The very next day, Darius Tanz lands on my doorstep, and does the same.<eos> What are the odds?<eos> Clearly, it's... something very special about this rock.<eos> Something that would warrant you venturing all the way up here, after all these years.
Well, honey, you know, Mike has moved on.<eos> Don't you think it's time that you let another man into the picture?<eos> - Mother, please.<eos> - So, Zoe, when are you leaving for Kenya?<eos> Four weeks.<eos> But I'm ready to go now.<eos> Ed can be a real buzzkill, but at least he's got great taste in whiskey.<eos> Isn't it possible you're seeing something you want to see?<eos> So forget all the strange things that have happened since Tanz and the DoD have forged this new partnership.<eos> Doesn't it strike you as odd that the great and powerful Darius Tanz gave an exclusive to little old me?
You want to talk about stakes?<eos> What happens if your guy breaks his only diamondtipped drill bit?<eos> Or the extractor overheats and fuses to the rock?<eos> We are all screwed, that's what.<eos> We only have one chance.<eos> It's got to be me.<eos> It has to be me.<eos> Fine.<eos> But you follow my orders to the letter. Okay?<eos> I'm not about to get us all killed so you can play hero.
Fine.<eos> But you follow my orders to the letter. Okay?<eos> I'm not about to get us all killed so you can play hero.<eos> - Are we clear?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, we're clear.<eos> Your orders?<eos> I'm going with him.<eos> So, this, guy of yours that you know, who is he?<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Daddy, you know I never ask much of you 'cause I knew you couldn't cross those lines, but I'm afraid I have to now.
Hey, you ever need to talk to someone about Croft... I've been there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thought we'd lost you there for a moment.<eos> Yeah, you and me both.<eos> I reached Calhoun.<eos> They're calling off the dogs.<eos> I don't want to be without you anymore.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> You were right.<eos> Jillian was a ploy to motivate you, manipulate you, at first.
Hanging out with someone for too long.<eos> That's what it is.<eos> It's true.<eos> Fuck these movies.<eos> They glorify love.<eos> Two people in the rain, looking at each other, not giving a shit it's raining 'cause they're holding eye contact.<eos> Right?<eos> They're just like, "I fucking love you."<eos> You're my soul mate.<eos> I'm so lucky I found you.
And then look at this zero area I've got over here.<eos> Look at that vast area.<eos> They shot Mad Max on the other side of you.<eos> Tom Hardy's over there on the front of a vehicle like:<eos> And I'm over here with my leg and my dick flopped off the bed.<eos> Explain that. Explain why my dick is flopped off the bed.<eos> They shot Mad Max and Dances With Wolves on the other side of you.<eos> Kevin Costner's over there with a water buffalo just like:<eos> He's saying that.<eos> Every time you turn, you take the covers. You know that?

He's saying that.<eos> Every time you turn, you take the covers. You know that?<eos> Every time you turn, you take it. You take it.<eos> I'm there and you're sleeping, but you're dreaming.<eos> 'Fuck him.<eos> He doesn't deserve them.'<eos> And you take it and you take it and you take it.<eos> And you do a billion revolutions a night.<eos> You take it, you take it.<eos> And when you come back, you leave it.
Put your fucking head against the side of the plane.<eos> I gave you the window seat for a reason. Use it.<eos> Well, I'm trying to be fucking chivalrous.<eos> "Time to kick back and relax."<eos> You're freezing, but she's got your hoodie balled up, using it as a pillow.<eos> And you gotta be happy about it.<eos> You're like, "Ah, I hope you're comfortable."<eos> And you're, like, going to visit her family in, like, Dallas or some shit and then she was like, "Do you wanna go because you wanna go... or do you wanna go because you know that I want you to go?"<eos> "You know what?<eos> You're asking me to lie to you."
That's what you want, right?<eos> But some dudes are like,<eos> ♪ Meet me somewhere el... ♪<eos> And they're like, "Fuck you.<eos> You don't get that last note."<eos> The balls you've gotta do to do that shit.<eos> I don't wanna go to your party, dude.<eos> What the fuck? Birthday party?<eos> Come on.<eos> I gotta get you a gift? Why?
I don't wanna go to your party, dude.<eos> What the fuck? Birthday party?<eos> Come on.<eos> I gotta get you a gift? Why?<eos> What happened? What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You just waited.<eos> That's all that happened.<eos> You didn't die.<eos> And I gotta, like, buy you a VCR or some shit?
It's my own backyard.<eos> I've had it for three years.<eos> "My dogs shit here.<eos> They know about it, too."<eos> I thought she was gonna change who I was.<eos> Instead, I checked into my gangster heart.<eos> I looked in her eyes and I thought, "Just another lying-ass bitch."<eos> I've been down this road before.<eos> Betrayal is a motherfucker.<eos> "That's how you got so real in the first place, dawg."
What if we hadn't brought you in?<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> Because... you made our father leave me... again.<eos> He told me that we were all going to be together.<eos> A family.<eos> So, I believed him.<eos> When you called the NSA on him, and he left, and I was so upset, I took over the avatar of young Cameron that he created.<eos> Wait. Hold on. You weren't the anomaly the whole time?<eos> No. Only the time that Kirsten was trapped.<eos> He was using that to make you trust him, to bring you back to us!
- Are you working for him?<eos> - No.<eos> He showed up a few weeks ago, and I kicked him out.<eos> Wow. You just can't stop lying.<eos> You really are your father's daughter.<eos> - Linus.<eos> - No. I'm done.<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> No way.<eos> You know all Linus ever did was defend you, right?
We're not friends. We're definitely not sisters.<eos> Just run on back to Stinger, so we can be enemies.<eos> At least be honest about that.<eos> - Kirsten...<eos> - No.<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> Well, Cameron usually briefs me on what I've missed while I was gone.<eos> Do you have something to add, Kirsten?<eos> I could tell you something you missed, but I guess Fisher already told you that we have that proof that Ivy's been in contact with Stinger.
- Drugs?<eos> - Steroids?<eos> I'll see if I can find that memory, and we'll focus on it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm at a press event for the tournament.<eos> Monica's giving an interview.<eos> Uh, both Leslie and I have worked really hard to hone our own set of skills that really complement each other.<eos> Uh, but I think it really comes down to teamwork and determination.<eos> That's just really the key for us.<eos> And having your teammate carry you doesn't hurt either.
What I did, I did for my country.<eos> Call it what you want.<eos> You were just doing other people's dirty work.<eos> Is that why you started All In?<eos> To tempt broken people into doing each others' dirty work.<eos> Maggie... we both know that at some point, everyone wants to get rid of someone.<eos> Problem is, most people don't have the money or the power to make it happen.<eos> All In just evens the playing field.<eos> Your app was downloaded hundreds of times.<eos> If we hadn't stopped you, a lot more people would have been killed.
The last time we spoke, you didn't want anything to do with me.<eos> What's different now?<eos> Things have changed.<eos> Kirsten and...<eos> Linus and... the whole team.<eos> They all hate me.<eos> You're my only real family.<eos> - I want to believe you.<eos> Then tell me this.<eos> If they all hate you... where'd you get your information about Jacqueline?
We got a story.<eos> Kinda all makes sense now.<eos> Doesn't it?<eos> Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.<eos> I indulged in temptation and risked my sister's life.<eos> Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned...<eos> You're been praying out here for over an hour.<eos> Phoebe saw you from the window... reminded me you were out here.<eos> I wanted to stay.<eos> I have faith that He heard you and He'll spare your sister.
I... thought you were coming over on Tuesday.<eos> You could've let me know.<eos> I know. I'm sorry.<eos> The thing is, I can't come see you anymore.<eos> - That last time was a mistake.<eos> - You've said that before.<eos> I'm trying with Faye.<eos> I really wanna try.<eos> So why are you here now?<eos> Well... to tell you.
Nothing.<eos> Okay.<eos> And you know how she said in her interview that her parents were both dead?<eos> Guess what?<eos> They are alive and well, a half hour away in Ellenville.<eos> As long as you're a loner, they'll push you around.<eos> You should sit with us.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> We have to move you, honey.
I'm all right.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> They said you had gotten pregnant. Is that true?<eos> Don't you think that's something that you should've told me?<eos> Cora?<eos> Why did you lie to the cops about Frankie?<eos> I know the guy you were talking about.<eos> I know JD. He's got that truck.<eos> I knew some of his friends before we met.<eos> Was he the one that got you pregnant?
I mean, can you please try and relax?<eos> Oh! I feel like a total dill weed!<eos> I just wanna have fun.<eos> Well, that's what I want, too.<eos> And I'll join you as soon as I finish up these blueprints.<eos> But I want you to go now.<eos> - Have some fun!<eos> - Okay.<eos> These blueprints really are quite literally kicking my ass.<eos> Beth, we've talked, and we've decided we're not gonna let you sell the camp!
Coop!<eos> Coop! Hey, there you are.<eos> Hey, Katie.<eos> Just trying to find an ending to my book.<eos> Listen. I'm not sure if you remember, but earlier this morning we said we'd talk later.
That's the call of Camp Firewood.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> It's luck and serendipity.<eos> Oh, yeah. Coop told me about the spirit.<eos> It's that totem thing, right?<eos> Uh... Yeah, well, you know, there's more to the spirit.<eos> They'll explain it to you.<eos> That's cute.<eos> No, it's a way of life and it's a philosophy.<eos> Yeah, Ginny, it's like when you forget to set your alarm clock, but you wake up the next morning at the exact right time.
Three, four, close the door.<eos> Five, six, pick up sticks.<eos> Do you see where I'm going with this?<eos> I'm sorry I wasn't truthful with you, Ginny.<eos> Will you forgive me?<eos> Coop, you know I can't stay mad at you.<eos> Come here.<eos> - So you'll stay?<eos> - Are there any other camp flings I should know about?<eos> The only flings you need to worry about are the flings of the Frisbee when we all gather on the main lawn later this afternoon to play ultimate Frisbee.

I know what I did!<eos> And don't give me your holier-than-thou crap.<eos> Beth cared about you even after you became a can, and how did you repay her?<eos> You sucked and fucked your way through every waitress in New England.<eos> You have no idea what my life has been like.<eos> Stop it!<eos> After the incident, I spent years in physical therapy, just learning how to walk.<eos> I still can't type.<eos> Don't you dare judge me.<eos> And don't you dare judge me!
Stop it!<eos> After the incident, I spent years in physical therapy, just learning how to walk.<eos> I still can't type.<eos> Don't you dare judge me.<eos> And don't you dare judge me!<eos> Gene, I didn't come here to fight you.<eos> Well, then I guess you came to the wrong Winnebago!<eos> Get a goddamn hold of yourself, Gene!<eos> I don't want you here, Mitch!<eos> Whatever it is you came for...
- God, isn't this like old times?<eos> - Yeah. - Hey, Coop.<eos> - Yeah... - Can we talk for a sec? Privately?<eos> - Sure, Ginny, sure.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, Coop...<eos> You know Iâ€™m the kind of girl who would never give her man an ultimatum.<eos> I know, and that's what's so...<eos> Until now.<eos> I don't want you hanging out with Katie anymore, okay?
She's a fucking bloodthirsty, murderous, bitch-ass psycho!<eos> What?<eos> Surprise.<eos> - Surprise.<eos> - Surprise.<eos> Surprise.<eos> Renata organized a surprise wedding anniversary for you. For us.<eos> No, no, Ben.<eos> She's got a knife.<eos> For this cake I made you.
- Renata...<eos> I donâ€™t know what to say.<eos> I am so sorry I misjudged you.<eos> It's hard being a new parent.<eos> I get it.<eos> - Will you accept my apology?<eos> - Of course I will, yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Come here, you.<eos> - I have a secret to tell you.
One step ahead of you, sir.<eos> Don't brag, George.<eos> Modesty is a virtue.<eos> Better get ready for the dance, Coop.<eos> You know Beth wants us all there.<eos> -Whatever.<eos> Who pooped in your tuba?<eos> Ginny dumped me.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> Hey, what happened to you, man?
Are you there?<eos> Yes.<eos> What do you want, Andy?<eos> I'm sorry I've been out of touch for a while.<eos> You're sorry?<eos> Well, I guess that means everything's forgiven.<eos> I just wanted to see how you're doing.<eos> I thought maybe I could talk to Nathan.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> You can't just waltz in and out of our lives whenever it suits you.
Look at you.<eos> You're covered in blood.<eos> That was just ketchup.<eos> All right, wait a minute.<eos> None of this is real?<eos> I mean, I put together a cracker jack team to stop a nuke.<eos> That's right, Gene.<eos> You did that.<eos> And now you're home again.<eos> And there's a young lady here who'd like to meet you.
Yes, but from this apartment complex to the scene, there are over 100 stores they supply it to.<eos> Everyone is visiting the stores at the moment to find out if anyone bought the knife in the last few days.<eos> Right, we're talking about from Seongdong-gu to Yongsan-gu.<eos> There must be a ton of stores.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm from the police. Do you happen to know this person?<eos> You should leave now, sir.<eos> All right.<eos> Ms. Lee.<eos> Are you preparing to divorce me?
We're not the type to quibble and get divorced like other couples do.<eos> We should at least try to hide our ugly sides from each other.<eos> I've never cheated on you.<eos> Then why are you sorry?<eos> You shouldn't have come that day.<eos> Your brother's trial.<eos> The first time we met.<eos> Or... I should've listened to your father.<eos> Whether he's a total rogue or not, had I let the corporate heir go,<eos> you wouldn't have been interested in me.
Are you saying our relationship was wrong from the start?<eos> Why are you being like this?<eos> What on earth are you...<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> I'll be late.<eos> Father must be waiting.<eos> You know how much he values punctuality.<eos> Let's talk at home.<eos> The flight ticket.<eos> Are you preparing to divorce me?
-You'll need to close them more tightly.<eos> Is this better?<eos> -Like this?<eos> -Yes, that's perfect.<eos> What's missing?<eos> They took it.<eos> Those scums.<eos> Chang-jun and Yun-beom.<eos> When?<eos> I was out of it earlier, but I wanted to check it after hearing what you said at the funeral.
Of course you didn't.<eos> Right?<eos> RECEIVING FAX<eos> These women came to my house because they received invitations.<eos> I have absolutely no idea who sent the invitations, or for what purpose.<eos> Can we please hurry up and name it?<eos> What's the rush?<eos> I have homework.<eos> Would you please put on some clothes?<eos> You still haven't gotten used to it?
You're a sensei, right?<eos> Anyway, give me a hug.<eos> Sensei... you're already hard.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> I want to do it now too.<eos> Hold on...<eos> There you are.<eos> Midori.<eos> Don't come near my school.<eos> I know I can find you here.
I get the feeling the women can see right through me.<eos> Cat!<eos> Whoever sent the invitations is using the women to do something to me, I'm sure of it.<eos> But I've grown used to this life now, so I don't really care anymore.<eos> Is that really good for your body?<eos> It's supposed to be.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, because it looks painful.<eos> It does?<eos> In fact, it looks like you're hurting yourself.
That's not in the rules.<eos> It's okay, isn't it, Cat?<eos> It ran away.<eos> Do you think that cat came here by accident?<eos> Of course it did.<eos> It didn't say anything about a cat coming in my invitation.<eos> I wonder who sent them to us.<eos> Hey, Midori.<eos> Hey!<eos> I gave you money the other day.
Well, it's not so difficult to do.<eos> By the way.<eos> This.<eos> I read it.<eos> As usual, it was a very apt review.<eos> It was just my honest opinion.<eos> Thank you.<eos> By the way, who is this guy you really tear into?<eos> Oh, Shin Michima?<eos> He's an ordinary person that you needn't bother about.
She's that idol I saw earlier.<eos> Right.<eos> She's going to a premium hotel suite now to sell her body.<eos> What?<eos> You see...<eos> She works in the call girl club that I run while she does idol work.<eos> Oh...<eos> Why do you do this work?<eos> Questions aren't allowed.<eos> Did you forget that?
It's quite easy.<eos> No matter what needs to be done, there are pros who specialize in it.<eos> Pros?<eos> But I don't know any...<eos> I'll ask one.<eos> Leave it to me.<eos> Are you a pro at this kind of thing?<eos> Well...<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> Midori, did you do as I told you?
What do you plan to do with him?<eos> Do you know how many people go missing every year in Japan?<eos> About 100,000.<eos> That guy will be one of them.<eos> Can't you help him?<eos> Please!<eos> Sunako, do what she asked.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> What will you do if he mooches off you again?
The person who is best at telling lies... will be the last to survive.<eos> Who sent the invitations?<eos> Naturally, it's someone you know.<eos> Who do you think it is?<eos> THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL.<eos> ALL CHARACTERS AND ORGANIZATIONS IN IT ARE FICTITIOUS.<eos> It's your new novel!<eos> I'll do whatever it takes to make it sell!<eos> I'll give it a fair judgment.<eos> Is that what's interesting to you?
Is it selling well?<eos> This week's sales rank is...<eos> THIS WEEK'S SALES RANK: 984TH It's 984th.<eos> Amazing.<eos> You know how good stuff doesn't necessarily always sell well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Though I don't know if your novel is good or not.<eos> At any rate, I try to write books that are interesting.<eos> Then why don't they sell?<eos> Is that what's interesting to you?
He's selling very well.<eos> RANCH MILK<eos> THANK YOU, NANAKA!<eos> MICHIMA<eos> Hey!<eos> Apologize.<eos> It's your fault Nanaka was killed.<eos> We'll never forgive you for what you did.<eos> Hey! Say something!<eos> How dare you run away!
There is no better time than now.<eos> No matter what has happened, you are still a novelist, Shin Michima.<eos> Oh, it's Miura?<eos> Hurry up and get in here.<eos> You would not believe the number of movie offers you're getting.<eos> The promotional effects of Nanaka Hiraki were fabulous.<eos> People are easily moved by emotional events.<eos> This is another of my theories.<eos> You're so right.<eos> You don't mind if I add a few things to this?
Come on.<eos> You suck at that.<eos> Give me that.<eos> No thanks.<eos> I don't want thick makeup like yours.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hold still or you'll turn out ugly.<eos> Minami, why are you doing this for me?<eos> Because you always have this look of, "I'm so pitiful."<eos> I think I told you this before.
Yes, why don't we?<eos> Okay, now for an announcement from Mr. Hanaki.<eos> MOVIE VERSION OF WORLD THEORY !<eos> THIS SUMMER ON HINOMARU TV.<eos> World Theory will now become a movie.<eos> Unfortunately, Nanaka is unable to play the heroine, but I believe that it will be a masterpiece.<eos> In addition, I believe she would...<eos> Is something wrong, Mr. Michima?<eos> I finally realized that you lied to me.<eos> Now, I'm inviting you to come to me.
I think it was about a year ago... that I just happened to read one of your novels.<eos> I didn't think it was particularly interesting or boring.<eos> But whoever wrote it has an incredible aversion to death. In fact, he might even fear it.<eos> I could sense that quite intensely as I read.<eos> When I researched you, I found out your father was on death row.<eos> It made me laugh.<eos> I had found the perfect plaything.<eos> My heart danced with joy for the first time in a long time.<eos> In six months, I would change an unpopular novelist who feared death into a best-selling novelist who desired to commit murder.<eos> Don't you think that sounds like an interesting game?

NATIONWIDE AUDITIONS FOR THE DRAMATIZATION OF WORLD THEORY !<eos> Are you sure you want auditions?<eos> Yes.<eos> But we had Masumi Arimura all set for it.<eos> With her, we would have a hit for sure.<eos> By normal logic, it's only natural.<eos> Then why?<eos> In order for me to give birth to a logic that only I can create, I will find a new logic yet to be expressed in this world.<eos> I will explain to everyone why we need it.<eos> Just how far will your zealousness take you?
You take all the time you need.<eos> I don't always love new things, but that's just a smart survival instinct.<eos> Do you think that a bearded seal would last very long if it said, "Well, I've never seen that animal before with the sharp teeth and beautiful white fur.<eos> I'll walk over and meet him."<eos> No.<eos> No, he wouldn't, because that's how you become a polar bear's dinner.<eos> You nervous about tomorrow?<eos> No. Oh, you're, like, freaking out.<eos> Kind of.<eos> Well, hey, just remember they recruited you.
But it's that dense, chewy kind, that maybe you can't eat the whole thing.<eos> So, do you want to go halfsies?<eos> We could be like Arctic foxes sharing food with our den mates.<eos> Card.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a system I developed so Sam doesn't annoy people with Antarctica facts.<eos> I give him three cards at the beginning of every day, and when he talks about Antarctica, I take one away.<eos> When he's out of cards, he can't talk about it anymore.<eos> Right, Sam? I decorated it with puffy paint.<eos> Sam, are you okay with this?
Oh, yeah? Does this have anything to do with the five-hour conversation that you and Dad had the other day?<eos> It took me some time, but I got there.<eos> And the distance and the money and Sam, we'll figure it out.<eos> Oh, that reminds me.<eos> We have the Clayton tour, so I won't be in school to give you your lunch money.<eos> But Evan's sister Beth will hold onto it and find you during fifth period.<eos> Do you know who Beth is?<eos> Yes, she talks loud.<eos> Why are you wearing a dress?<eos> Do they need to see how muscly your legs are to know if they want you on the team?

You don't want to be late before you actually go to the school.
Casey.<eos> I'm Jayson. Nice to meet you.<eos> Hey. You, too.<eos> You look familiar.<eos> I'm black, so they put me on the brochures.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> So we do peer interviews here.<eos> It's supposed to make you feel more comfortable, and I must be crushing it because you seem comfortable, so...
But I need my sweatshirt. How do I get it back?<eos> I don't know, maybe give her something else to replace it.<eos> That's extremely wise.<eos> I told you, dude.<eos> Kayla's a total genius.<eos> Plus, she works at Claire's. She can pierce whatever you want for half price, except scrotes.<eos> I don't want her handling some other dude's dangle-downs, know what I'm saying?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, my goodness, that was fun.<eos> Casey, you need to write that nice boy that interviewed you a thank you e-mail.
I don't need you.<eos> Well, good! That's what I wanted.<eos> Well, good!<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, Casey, it's Jayson... from Clayton Prep.<eos> I just got your e-mail.<eos> Oh. Hi.<eos> You guys are prompt.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Look, I just wanted to call to say I think you're awesome.
Where was this, do you remember?<eos> This was out on holiday.<eos> I just remember having the skinniest legs and still do. You're quite skinny there.<eos> Chicken legs. Got some good, bushy blond eyebrows there.<eos> Your freckled nose. Your freckles have gone quite a lot now.<eos> You used to have such freckles.<eos> They come back now and then.<eos> Funny. A sweet picture of her. Happy memories, big smiley faces.<eos> She smothered us with love, that's for sure. Yeah. To myself and William, she was just the best mother ever.<eos> She would just engulf you and squeeze you as tight as possible. And being as short as I was then, there was no escape, you were there and you were there for as long as she wanted to hold you. Even talking about it now, I can feel the hugs that she used to give us, and, you know, I...

And being as short as I was then, there was no escape, you were there and you were there for as long as she wanted to hold you. Even talking about it now, I can feel the hugs that she used to give us, and, you know, I...<eos> She was extremely good at showing her love. She was extremely good at showing what we meant to her and, you know, what feelings meant and how important it was to feel. Behind closed doors, she was a very loving, caring mother and an incredibly funny person.<eos> One thing I would love to ask her now, because I genuinely think that she got satisfaction out of dressing myself and William up in the most bizarre outfits, normally matching...<eos> It was weird shorts, and, you know, like, little, sort of, shiny shoes with the old clip on, and looking back at the photos, it just makes me laugh.<eos> Funnily enough, we got to the age when William would go, "I'm the older brother, why do I have to be dressed the same as him?"<eos> I'm sitting there going, "Hang on, if you're gonna dress differently, I'm not gonna be the only person dressed like this. It's ridiculous."
You know, losing someone so close to you is utterly devastating, especially at that age.<eos> I think it sort of really spins you out. You don't quite know where you are, what you're doing and what's going on. The family came together, erm, and Harry and I tried to talk as best we could about it, but... being so small at that age, it's very difficult to... to communicate or understand your feelings.<eos> It's very complicated. After the service in Westminster Abbey, Diana's body was taken to her family home at Althorp.<eos> The first time I cried was at the funeral on the... on the island.<eos> And probably, like... and only since then maybe once.<eos> So there's, you know, there's a lot of... there's a lot of grief that still needs to be, erm, to be let out.<eos> Slowly you try and rebuild your life and you try and understand what's happened, and... I kept saying to myself that, you know, my mother would not want me to be upset; She'd not want me to be down, she'd not want me to be like this.<eos> I was so young, I grew up sort of thinking that not having a mum was normal.<eos> I think it was a classic case of,<eos> "Don't let yourself think about your mum and the grief and the hurt that comes with it, because it's never gonna bring her back and it's only gonna make you...
that level of detail. So I do regularly, putting George or Charlotte to bed, talk about her and just try and remind them that there are two grandmothers, there were two grandmothers in their lives, and so it's important they know who she was and that she existed.<eos> She'd be a nightmare grandmother, absolute nightmare.<eos> She'd love the children to bits erm, but she'd be an absolute nightmare. She'd come and go and she'd come in, probably, at bath time, cause an amazing amount of scene, bubbles everywhere, bathwater all over the place, and... and then leave.<eos> I wanna make as much time and effort with Charlotte and George as I can because I realise that these early years, particularly, are crucial for children, erm, having seen, you know, what she did for us.<eos> I found these ones here, which I thought was quite sweet.<eos> Believe it or not, you and I are both in this photo.<eos> Right. You're in the tummy. Oh, nice.<eos> Yeah, exactly. No, she wrote on it saying, "W Harry." It's quite funny.<eos> I mean, you potentially look excited that you've got a... at that point, a brother or sister coming.<eos> I think I was looking forward to beating you up, maybe you're right. I thought it was a funny photograph. Quite sweet.
"I don't know about his policies.<eos> He just says what's on his mind."<eos> I thought that was the dumbest thing I'd ever heard till I went to visit...<eos> Yeah, seriously.<eos> I thought that was the dumbest thing I'd ever heard till I went to visit my mother, my own mother. Iranian lady.<eos> She had fallen for the line.<eos> She goes, "Maz, I like this guy because he say what is on his mind."<eos> I go, "Mom, are you crazy?<eos> He's anti-immigrant.<eos> If he becomes President, your relatives can't come to visit you."
Immigrant parents don't say "I love you" all the time.<eos> In America, we have to tell our kids we love them all day long.<eos> In the morning, "I love you."<eos> Lunchtime, "I still love you."<eos> Afternoon, "I loved you more than lunch and breakfast.<eos> I love you even more now."<eos> Even when they get in trouble, you gotta tell them you love them.<eos> My son gets in trouble... "You're in big trouble.<eos> You did not clean your room!<eos> But just know that I love you.
My parents had sayings that indicated that they might love us.<eos> My dad always used to say, "You're the light of my eyes.<eos> You're the light of my eyes."<eos> "You're the light of my eyes!"<eos> You'd be like, "Wow!"<eos> Yeah, don't clap.<eos> Don't clap.<eos> Because I would be like, "Wow, does that mean you love me?"<eos> He'd be like, "Ehh.<eos> That means I can see you in the dark.
He's, like, a total pussy and...<eos> I don't know how to handle that energy at all.<eos> I was home for Thanksgiving a couple years ago, and we were watching football on TV.<eos> It's just me and him in the living room.<eos> When the game ended, he turned the TV off and he looked at me, he went,<eos> "Uh, Joseph, have I ever told you about my happiest memory?"<eos> I was like, "Uh, no.<eos> No."<eos> He goes, "I want to share this with you.<eos> I don't know if you remember this.
Lotion-less.<eos> I didn't want to go. I was not on board for this Jewish summer camp thing.<eos> Driving to Wisconsin... The whole drive to Wisconsin, I was in the back seat of our minivan yelling,<eos> "I don't want to go!<eos> I don't want to do this!<eos> I'm scared!<eos> I've never been away from home before!"<eos> My mom turned around and calmed me down. She's like, "Joseph.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> You're gonna find God, and you have nothing to worry about.
Uh, does air go in your nose and out your mouth, or in your mouth and out your nose?<eos> I don't remember how to do it."<eos> "Don't worry. Don't worry.<eos> I just won't do either."<eos> Sometimes I get so high that if I'm around too many people, I'II lock myself in a bathroom and interrogate myself in a mirror like a fucking murder detective on a TV show.<eos> Right? I'II, like, slam the door, lock it.<eos> Be like, "Joe, what the fuck, shit bird?<eos> Why the fuck do you feel so crazy?<eos> You came to the party normal, now you're crazy.<eos> Why you feel so crazy, asshole?"
"We"?<eos> As in you and your mom.<eos> Me and my boyfriend.<eos> Snowshoeing was his idea.<eos> I hate the cold.<eos> You have a boyfriend?<eos> Mm-hmm. Miles.<eos> Anyway, it's great that you're showing so much interest in others. We've been working on that.<eos> But how about we get back to you?<eos> Now, when Mr. Tavern's voice bothers you...
You never heard any of this?<eos> Casey's just a sophomore.<eos> Yeah. I forget.<eos> Superstar's still just a baby.<eos> Little baby.<eos> In science, observable evidence plays a key role in discovery.<eos> Yo, brotha.<eos> But to really understand it, you have to ask questions.<eos> Excuse me. Bailey?<eos> I'm the boy whose sister punched you.

Bailey?<eos> I'm the boy whose sister punched you.<eos> I noticed yesterday you were kissing Henry and today, you're kissing Arlo.<eos> And I was wondering, how did he woo you?
And then I tried to pawn them.<eos> I didn't really have a good reason why.<eos> They left the band room unlocked. I guess that's the reason.<eos> Anyway, never mind.<eos> Ninety minutes later, cops are at my door.<eos> They put me in cuffs.<eos> And since I stole stuff from the school that I go to, you know, like a genius...<eos> I also got expelled.<eos> So there it is.<eos> That's the full story. I hope you're happy.

I hope you're happy.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> You stole musical instruments?<eos> That's what you did?<eos> Yeah. I told you it was stupid.<eos> Why are you laughing?
You stole musical instruments?<eos> That's what you did?<eos> Yeah. I told you it was stupid.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> Because that is hilarious!<eos> Because everyone thinks you're, like, a total badass.<eos> How did you carry them all?<eos> I brought my wagon.<eos> God, this just gets better and better.<eos> I can't believe you're laughing at me right now.

I shouldn't have told you. You know what?
You saved me.<eos> I didn't hurt him.<eos> Just do what you did before.<eos> Like the dead bird.<eos> Go on.<eos> I won't tell.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Wake up now.<eos> You!<eos> How dare you come here!
You'd feed an army that's crucifying your own people?<eos> I'd offer you ambrosia from the gods of Mount Olympus and conjure up dancing girls and woodland nymphs if you would spare these children of my father's house.<eos> If you tell me these men are not bandits and thieves, I'll believe you.<eos> They've been in Alexandria seven years.<eos> They're craftsmen.<eos> I received a letter only a month ago that tells of their plan to come here.<eos> You know we have to put down this rebellion.<eos> It's good wine.<eos> It's very good wine.<eos> For the life of my family, would I give you bad wine?
It's good wine.<eos> It's very good wine.<eos> For the life of my family, would I give you bad wine?<eos> Take it.<eos> Take it with you.<eos> It's a hard thing you have to do.<eos> Yes.<eos> We leave this village as it is.<eos> I thank you, grandmother.<eos> The Lord bless you and keep you.
Joseph, what do you...<eos> It's the fever.<eos> Riba, get more water and rags.<eos> Dear God, heal my child, I beg you.<eos> May your love and compassion shine upon your blessed child and spare him from suffering.<eos> Please forgive the sins for we have this day.<eos> Send a word from his righteous path...<eos> You are no child.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Why don't you dwell in the house of the Lord in Jerusalem?

Just after the uprising in Sepphoris.<eos> We were establishing order.<eos> It's a bloody business,<eos> - establishing order.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> And what of this family?<eos> Did you establish order?<eos> They appeared innocent.<eos> We left them untouched.<eos> Was that before or after they gave you the wine?
Where are you from?<eos> Jericho.<eos> Your name.<eos> Name!<eos> He can't speak.<eos> He's been that way since birth.<eos> Go.<eos> Go to your temple.<eos> You are alone?<eos> It's all I can give you.
Jericho.<eos> Your name.<eos> Name!<eos> He can't speak.<eos> He's been that way since birth.<eos> Go.<eos> Go to your temple.<eos> You are alone?<eos> It's all I can give you.<eos> God be with you and watch over you.
God is your father.<eos> But we're all children of God.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> But you...<eos> You are begotten of God.<eos> That is why you can make dead birds fly, the sick well, the blind see,<eos> and why you were able to make Eleazer live again.<eos> He's made you a child to grow in wisdom as well as in all other things.<eos> Keep your power inside you, until your father in heaven shows you the time to use it.

I bet he's dead by the weekend.<eos> No messing about this time.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> So, you're the mystery elf who's been hacking up my slope, huh?<eos> Just you?<eos> No pickaxe?<eos> You do realize the time to start jumping is when you're five or six?<eos> Thanks.<eos> The Norwegians already told me that.<eos> Did they also tell you you look ridiculous in that gear?
- Just helping.<eos> Up, back, forward, down.<eos> Up, back, forward, down.<eos> - Say it.<eos> - Up, back, forward, down.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Fell in love with this sport.<eos> It started with this little baby.<eos> This little 15 meter little vixen.<eos> You manage to land that because it's meant to hook you into the sport... otherwise you wouldn't bother trying.
- That was better, weren't it?<eos> Bo Derek!<eos> Yeah, baby!<eos> I think a little bit of wee came out.<eos> So, all you have to do is make this landing and you qualify.<eos> One jump away from the Olympics, man.<eos> Get your skis.<eos> Okay.<eos> Stay focused.<eos> Do everything I told you to do only better.
It was beautiful.<eos> I was really proud of you, man.<eos> Mum... Dad was right.<eos> Wasted all this time and money on nothing.<eos> My dream's turned into a nightmare.<eos> I'm really sorry to have done this...<eos> I promise I'm gonna make it up to you.<eos> - No more messing around.<eos> - Don't be silly.<eos> You've had knock-backs before and it's never stopped you.
- Peary!<eos> - Come here.<eos> I've been doing some thinking.<eos> They recorded the flippin' practice jump.<eos> It's official.<eos> It counts.<eos> - 61 meters.<eos> - "Everything to the letter."<eos> You should go and pack, my friend, because we are going to Canada.<eos> If you go now, they're never gonna let you back.

So, all you can prove is you don't mind coming last?
I'm gonna go.<eos> Then you're on your own.<eos> It won't mean anything if you sell yourself short.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> We should go back in '92, not as a qualifier, as a contender.<eos> This is everything we've worked for, isn't it?<eos> Listen to me... a year after I got bumped from the Olympic Squad I went back to Warren Sharp to apologize.<eos> I literally got down on my knees and I begged him to let me jump again.<eos> You wanna know what his last words to me were?<eos> "You will never take jumping seriously 'cause you do not take yourself seriously."
I mean, what have horses gotta do with skiing?<eos> Okay.<eos> I love this guy.<eos> Wake up, Princess Anne.<eos> My head.<eos> How long have I got?<eos> I'm sorry, it seems like you overslept.<eos> Me and the fellas wanted to thank you for helping us avoid that curse.<eos> Think I'm about to have my first fight, ever.<eos> This is the complaint I was telling you about.
It'll be the first for me to be commentating on a British... ski-jumper at the Olympics and let's hope he's the first of many.<eos> Yes!<eos> To say his style is unorthodox would be something of an understatement... but it obviously works for him.<eos> And the scoreboard shows... 60.5 meters.<eos> It is a new British Olympic record.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm a British record...<eos> Mum, I love you.<eos> British record!<eos> I love you, too, son.
- Fluff?<eos> This is a mustache.<eos> - Is that what you call it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nice jacket.<eos> What happened to the other one?<eos> Well, I got rid of it.<eos> Really?<eos> For now.<eos> And it's cold, let me tell you.
Oh, my God.<eos> I wanna hear you at the back of the stands.<eos> Okay, if you're not yelling it, you're not selling it.<eos> You're quite a popular guy, Eagle-Man.<eos> Every time you turn on TV you're there.<eos> Yeah. Maybe perhaps you can tell us, what's the secret?<eos> Clothes.<eos> ...underneath the landing area making it harder and more dangerous than usual.<eos> Can't we watch It's A Knockout?<eos> I'll knock you out if you turn that channel over.
Why am I so thirsty?<eos> Hang on, boy. Hang on, boy.<eos> Hang on, boy. Hang on. Hang on.<eos> There we go. There we go.<eos> You love God, don't you, Daniel?<eos> Yes.<eos> There we go.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I know you are.<eos> But you love God, and God loves you.
If we can't feed the hogs, we got nothin' to put in the smokehouse. We got nothin' to put in the smokehouse, we starve in the winter.<eos> That's murder, ain't it?<eos> You know what the penalty for murder is, don't you, lieutenant?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> Thomas!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Come here.<eos> What rank I make you?
You own any slaves, ward?<eos> You got any negroes to fight for?<eos> No. But it sure looks like you do.<eos> That's fine, ward.<eos> You leave any time you want.<eos> Save your farms.<eos> All you got to do is lay down your arms.<eos> You ain't being disloyal.<eos> You're just being smart.<eos> Your mama don't need you dead.
They fought beside us, and our boys got as much to lose in this than anyone.<eos> - I know. - Well then get 'em to come to one meeting.<eos> Get 'em to come to one union league meeting.<eos> They gonna see the fight ain't over.<eos> They ain't gonna come.<eos> They just ain't.<eos> Their war is over.<eos> It's over.<eos> You know better than that.<eos> God bless you, Newt.
- 'Cause I'm not guilty of anything.<eos> Young man,<eos> I don't appreciate these games, and I am tempted to rescind your bail right now.<eos> Your honor-- you can rescind anything you want, but I'm not changing my plea.<eos> Fine.<eos> Bailiff will take the defendant into custody.<eos> Bail is hereby rescinded.<eos> Your honor-- you missed your chance, Mr. Oaks.<eos> -I love you, honey.<eos> -I love you too.

You know what you must do after the Black Ops are finished.<eos> After this assignment, the Vanquisher project must be closed.<eos> Okay.<eos> A little unexpected, but all right.<eos> From what I've seen in your profile, you are qualified for this job.<eos> You're an officer in the Special Ops unit, Royal Thai Police.<eos> A sub-lieutenant.<eos> How long have you worked there? .<eos> About four years.<eos> What made you choose the field job? .
What he said made me think of the possibility.<eos> And I became suspicious.<eos> I need to know the truth.<eos> Hey, how's it going over there? .<eos> You know, what you're doing here could land you in jail for 70 years.<eos> You know this is America, not, you know, France.<eos> Who's going to find me? .<eos> George Bush? .<eos> Yeah.<eos> George Bush might find you.
You okay?<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a bunker.<eos> Your room's a little bit of a fixer-upper, but at least you got a door.<eos> A scary door, but you still got a door.<eos> How long have you been down here?<eos> Couple of days, I think.<eos> You know, it's actually kind of hard to tell with no windows or sunlight or anything.<eos> I mean, how do we get out of here?<eos> Oh, he didn't tell you?
You wear helmets when you ride your bikes. You have seat belts in your cars. You have alarm systems to protect your homes.<eos> But what do you do when those alarms go off?<eos> "Crazy" is building your ark after the flood has already come!<eos> I think maybe it's time you met frank and Mildred.<eos> Closest I could get to an airlock.<eos> See?<eos> What happened to them?<eos> They weren't as lucky as you.<eos> It's the air, Michelle.<eos> That's what happens when you get exposed.
Please?<eos> Ah, shoot!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna need the pepper also.<eos> What exactly do you think you're doing?<eos> I'm asking for pepper.<eos> Like hell you were! What was that?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.<eos> Are you trying to insult me?<eos> Here, in the shelter that I built that's keeping you alive?
I'll know.<eos> - Water. Una agua.<eos> You got it.<eos> - Hey, um...<eos> I like your hair.<eos> It looks different from... from the bus.<eos> - It's nice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You shouldn't feel insecure about it or... self-conscious.
No.<eos> It's gotta be here somewhere.<eos> Well, was your name in it?<eos> Or, like, any contact information?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Ah!<eos> You fucking bitch!<eos> Claire?<eos> You here?<eos> What I just put in you is called pancuronium bromide.
Shit's always going out.<eos> Got it.<eos> Got it.<eos> - It's, uh, broken?<eos> - It's always broken.<eos> - This whole place sucks.<eos> - Alright.<eos> Shut up!<eos> So...<eos> I'm Seth, in case you forgot.
Breathe.<eos> Sit up.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> It's OK.<eos> I brought food as well, in case you feel up for it.<eos> Water.<eos> Food.<eos> Just take it easy, alright?<eos> That's all you're getting today.
Might not have a choice.<eos> And why's that?<eos> I might not be able to save you.<eos> What is this, some kind of fucking religious thing?<eos> Did God tell you to punish all the whores, something like that?<eos> It's a different kind of saving.<eos> - And no.<eos> - So, what?<eos> You're just a sick fuck?<eos> This is how you get your kicks?
When you talked to me, you saw me.<eos> You really... saw me.<eos> That's just what you wanted me to see, huh?<eos> The version of Holly you are when everyone's watching.<eos> We both know that's a lie, don't we?<eos> Go to hell.<eos> That's the question.<eos> Which one's the real Holly?<eos> The Holly on the outside or... ..the other Holly?<eos> Because if there's even a chance I can save you,
We both know that's a lie, don't we?<eos> Go to hell.<eos> That's the question.<eos> Which one's the real Holly?<eos> The Holly on the outside or... ..the other Holly?<eos> Because if there's even a chance I can save you,<eos> I have to take it.<eos> But if that's it, if there's nothing left to save, then you're never leaving this room.<eos> What you doing here?<eos> Man, if they catch you fucking around in them tunnels...
- Fucking kidding me.<eos> You don't think?<eos> "Love is sacrifice."<eos> You know who believes that?<eos> People who hate themselves.<eos> Who are alone, depressed.<eos> Just like you.<eos> - Think I hate myself?<eos> - I know you do.<eos> You hate yourself so much, you can't even imagine how fucked up someone would have to be to love you back.
Nothing.<eos> Just... was curious.<eos> Why you did it.<eos> I guess when I saw Eric's email, all those messages from Claire...<eos> No, not Claire.<eos> I understand that.<eos> It's a crime of passion or whatever.<eos> I want to know why you didn't stop there.<eos> Why you killed the others.<eos> 'Cause you felt guilty, for what you did to Claire, for getting away with it.
'Cause you can't just walk away.<eos> Not with your fingerprints all over the place.<eos> I kill myself, your life ends too.<eos> So how's that for the boundaries of our fucking relationship?<eos> - Seth?<eos> - Hm?<eos> Finish this up and come see me in my office.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> "Is something wrong?" That's the question, isn't it?<eos> I'm not following you.
Are you stabbing me? !<eos> Motherfucker!<eos> The block, Seth.<eos> Use the cinder block.<eos> - He's moving.<eos> Come on.<eos> Use it.<eos> - I can't.<eos> You have to.<eos> Seth, I can't lose you.
I'm sorry.<eos> Seth.<eos> You have to listen to me.<eos> You have to do exactly what I say.<eos> Are you listening? OK.<eos> Step one is disposing of the body.<eos> The sooner, the better.<eos> OK, burn it, bury it, sink it, whatever.<eos> Get it out of here.<eos> But you can't do that before you get rid of any identifiers.
Um...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nate asked me to watch the front while he ran some errands.<eos> And he's still not back yet.<eos> I don't know where he went.<eos> O...<eos> OK.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - How do you feel?
The first time's always the worst.<eos> There is no first time.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> I told you.<eos> You know what always got to me... ..was the questions.<eos> I remember in the beginning, all I could think about was what if she had a pet?<eos> This poor little doggie just...<eos> sitting by the door waiting for her to come home.<eos> But all that goes away.<eos> The more you think about it, the more you remember the parts that you liked.

But the only problem is... ..that sooner or later, it all goes back to normal.<eos> All of a sudden, you're nothing special.<eos> You're just you.<eos> Stop, OK?<eos> And that's when you start to wonder how far you'd have to go to get that feeling back.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> There is no shame in accepting what you are, Seth.<eos> I did it to keep us safe.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> Didn't you ever wonder why... ..all the girls in the world, but you get a hard-on for me?
Tell me what you need.<eos> You know the answer.<eos> You put me in a box.<eos> That's not love.<eos> That's ownership.<eos> You didn't give me anything.<eos> All you did was take.<eos> I can't let you out.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - Didn't ask you to.
Even when I was a kid, I still knew... ..that if they ever found out, my family, my friends... ..if they knew what I really was, they'd run the other way.<eos> And so you learn to... ..blend in, to fake it.<eos> After a while, you... ..you don't even notice how lonely you really are.<eos> But then...<eos> ..someone comes along, someone like you.<eos> Even if he just doesn't know it yet.<eos> And all of a sudden, you start thinking... ..maybe it doesn't have to be this way.<eos> Maybe I don't have to be alone.<eos> And so you let go of the rope.<eos> Because this person, he's not gonna let you fall.
Master Kaecilius.<eos> That ritual will bring you only sorrow.
This is mania.<eos> Some things just can't be fixed.<eos> - Life without my work...<eos> - Is still life.<eos> This isn't the end.<eos> There are other things that can give your life meaning.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like you?<eos> This is the part where you apologize.<eos> This is the part where you leave.
Stephen.<eos> Wong.<eos> What do you want, Strange?<eos> Books on astral projection.<eos> You're not ready for that.<eos> Try me, Beyoncé.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You've heard of her.<eos> She's a huge star, right?<eos> Do you ever laugh?
I came here to heal my hands.<eos> Not to fight in some mystical war.<eos> London.<eos> Kaecilius!<eos> No!<eos> Wong?<eos> Mordo?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Daniel, I see they made you master of this sanctum.
You think this is where you die.<eos> You wonder what I see in your future?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> I never saw your future.<eos> Only its possibilities.<eos> You have such a capacity for goodness.<eos> You always excelled... But not because you craved success... But because of your fear of failure.<eos> That's what made me a great doctor.<eos> It's precisely what kept you from greatness.

From learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all.
But I have to go away now.<eos> You said that losing my hands didn't have to be the end.<eos> That it could be a beginning.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Because there are other ways to save lives.<eos> A harder way.<eos> A weirder way.<eos> Doctor Palmer to the er, please.<eos> Doctor Palmer to the er.<eos> I don't want you to go.
Yes.<eos> Ready, steady.<eos> Father.<eos> Oh, I knew it!<eos> It's all wet.<eos> He'll not know you when you return.<eos> But you must go.<eos> I know that.<eos> Indeed.<eos> I have something to tell you.
What I say, Mr. Murray... Is I accept that challenge!<eos> Mr. Costin!<eos> I see you seated there!<eos> Will you return with us?<eos> Mr. Fawcett, that jungle is hell, but one kind of likes it.<eos> We shall return!<eos> And we shall find the glory!<eos> I have such high hopes, cheeky.<eos> With this journey, we may be able to tear down their narrow-minded convictions.<eos> I do believe I am quite ready to accompany you on your next journey.
Ah.<eos> The rigors of such a trip would be beyond your imagination.<eos> I believe it is generally acknowledged that the pain a woman experiences during childbirth far exceeds anything a man must endure.<eos> This is not about childbirth.<eos> Oh, what do you know of childbirth?<eos> Have you witnessed two minutes of it, let alone endured it?<eos> The jungle is about years of practice... Training, the art of soldiering.<eos> I have that.<eos> It is about maggots in your skin.<eos> It is about deadly snakes and disease that make you vomit blood.
Who are you?<eos> Holtzmann. Virgo.<eos> Avid skier.<eos> Gluten-full.<eos> And 100% jazzed to meet you.<eos> Don't get too close to her, Holtzmann.<eos> She'll ask you to write a book, and then she'll squash your dreams. Okay.<eos> Holtzmann works with me here in the lab.<eos> She's a brilliant engineer and very loyal.<eos> She would not abandon you.
We didn't get anything.<eos> Well, we didn't think so.<eos> And then later, in the lab, when we were reviewing these tapes...<eos> - You really got me. - You know what?<eos> Usually we can't even get people over here. - But we have never...<eos> - She came right over to it.<eos> Never had anybody actually put their face down close to the machine.<eos> It's a cool joke. That was funny.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> Is it more or less disgusting if I tell you it came from the front?
- She came right over to it.<eos> Never had anybody actually put their face down close to the machine.<eos> It's a cool joke. That was funny.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> Is it more or less disgusting if I tell you it came from the front?<eos> - You didn't...<eos> - I can do it live if you want.<eos> What's next?<eos> You gonna give me a wedgie? No.<eos> I think both of us pretty much feel you have enough stuck up your butt.
- Yes.<eos> Break!<eos> - Wait, you're going?<eos> - I got the pack. Abby!<eos> Please, Abby.<eos> The book.<eos> Come on. Let's go!<eos> I'm not going with you guys.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> You were never invited!
Well, you said "let's," so... - Oh, my God.<eos> Just pull the... - We're wasting time. Just close the door behind you, it'll lock!<eos> Abby, wait! Hey!<eos> Taxi!<eos> - Abby. Abby, come on.<eos> Please, Abby, just take the book down.<eos> Please.<eos> All right, all right, but you have to introduce us to this guy at the Aldridge Mansion.<eos> Yes, he would love to meet you.<eos> Then I will consider, maybe, taking the book down until you get your stupid tenure at your stupider college.
I didn't get fired.<eos> Even though I have the old plant in the box.<eos> Margaret, hi.<eos> Just taking my plant out for some air.<eos> Just like to carry it in this box with all my other personal stuff.<eos> Phil.<eos> Phil.<eos> Hi.<eos> Phil...<eos> If you turn around, you'll see me. I'm right behind you.
Tonight, the Ghost Jumpers make contact with the ghost of Bigfoot. God! These phonies!<eos> I mean, you know what?<eos> These guys are the reason you got fired.<eos> It's because of stuff like this that makes it impossible for us to do our real work.<eos> This cannot be the best option for people.<eos> Okay, we are on the cusp of something here, a real discovery.<eos> Unlike Columbia, this institute is 100% behind us.<eos> Really?<eos> Erin, this is what we have dreamed about since we were little kids.<eos> I know that if you come and join us here, they are gonna be so pumped.
You know what? I think it's not always about the end result. It's about the journey.<eos> Well, what about this one?<eos> I think that's already a thing.<eos> What, 7-1-1?<eos> It's 7-Eleven.<eos> Yep, it is.<eos> I have another option, though. - Okay, please.<eos> - It's this one.<eos> That's one of my favorites.<eos> I think you might've made a mistake. I don't think that one's for us. No.
Hey, guys, which one of these makes me look more like a doctor?<eos> Me playing saxophone or me listening to saxophone?<eos> Who was on the phone?<eos> The Stonebrook Theatre.<eos> There's a goat on the loose.<eos> I'm gonna load up the car.<eos> Okay, okay, okay!<eos> Yo, yo, I got something for us, too!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, you guys, I got these from work.<eos> I'm making it official, man. You put one of these on, you won't get slimed again.
I'm telling you, he...<eos> Look, I bet you he get loose and...<eos> I bet you he pop locks.<eos> I bet you...<eos> He does...<eos> No!<eos> None of that. None of that's happening.<eos> - It's rigid.<eos> It's got a lot of teeth. - Girl. Please.<eos> And he thinks he's doing you a favor.
Pretty cool, right?<eos> If it doesn't work, we can just swing it around and break stuff, so it's kind of a win-win.<eos> - What?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Not my babies!<eos> Hey! - Wait a minute!<eos> - No! Man, are y'all playing?<eos> 'Cause this ain't funny, man.<eos> Yo! For real!<eos> See, Abby, I told you to have that sandwich, man.
- All right. With who?<eos> - It's working with this fashion incubator, and they just pay young designers to come up with clothes for their store.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> You're not working for that douche bag? - No.<eos> For this woman.<eos> - But it's where he works, right?<eos> He doesn't work there.<eos> He just owns the company.<eos> Why didn't you tell me you were up for it? That's a little weird.
He's an old boyfriend of hers.<eos> And we lived with him in Paris for a few years when I was a kid.<eos> And?<eos> He raped me.<eos> When was this?<eos> Over the summer.<eos> Before I came here.<eos> I...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I thought I'd tell you.
No, I've seen your picture on the back of your book.<eos> I studied it in college in northwestern.<eos> Really... really fucking brainy stuff.<eos> Yeah. Oh, thanks for your kind words.<eos> Hey, you know, I'd like to buy you a drink if you don't mind.<eos> Wait, don't be silly.<eos> You're the one with the heavy heart.<eos> It's not every day you run into a fan, so cheers to that.<eos> Cheers.<eos> So... if you're up to it, I can show you around in Paris.
What are the chances that an American knowing my book so well?<eos> And then just runs into me here in Paris at my local bistro.<eos> Marty Summers is my American accountant.<eos> He's not a teacher.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you want?<eos> What have I done to you?<eos> You don't just rape a girl and get away with it.<eos> I never raped anyone in my whole life.<eos> Now, who told you that? - It doesn't matter.
Yeah.<eos> I got it.<eos> Yes!<eos> I knew that you would.<eos> You hungry?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Good. 'Cause I'm taking you out.<eos> You saw him.<eos> In Paris.<eos> What did he tell you?
- Très bien.<eos> When?<eos> - I was thinking maybe next week.<eos> Terrific.<eos> Bravo, monsieur.<eos> - What's your business here?<eos> - I'm here to see Madame Le Tellier.<eos> - Then give her a call.<eos> - No, it's okay. I know him.<eos> If I knew we would be talking about that troublesome little girl, I would not have invited you in.
Thank you.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Let me teach you how to be single.<eos> Okay, lesson one.<eos> Go get us some drinks.<eos> Okay.<eos> No. That was a trick.<eos> You don't buy the drinks.<eos> Boys buy the drinks.<eos> It's kind of like a sexual currency that they use, so they're not actually paying you to hook up.
Hey, what's up, y'all?<eos> I don't know why I just said "y'all."<eos> "You all" would have taken just as much time.<eos> And I'm not even from the South, I'm from Portland.<eos> Which is southern from Canada.<eos> Are y'all Canadian?<eos> I just did it again, I said it again.<eos> My system should have weeded him out.<eos> You probably read your data wrong.<eos> I bet that guy told you exactly who he was. You just didn't want to hear it.
See, some women would look at what you just did and think that you smiled.<eos> But, because I'm a doctor, I know that that was probably just an involuntary tic, or gas.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're not that cute, and I am not falling for it.<eos> So, you just keep trying, but it is "no."<eos> Shut up, baby.<eos> And, you know what?<eos> Don't touch that, because that's not very sanitary.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Germs are little bugs, like little microbes that get into your mouth, and they make you sick.
I'm telling you.<eos> Sex?<eos> It's the best way to find out what you want.<eos> Think about it, the whole love thing, the whole,<eos> "I just want a guy to notice when I'm cold."<eos> It's nice when a guy notices when you're cold.<eos> It means he's... It means he's faking it, because he knows that's what you want to hear.<eos> So, instead of being a psycho who pretends that I give a shit if you're cold, I tell everyone the same thing.<eos> "If you're looking for the one, that's not me.<eos> "If you're looking for the one" "to have a little fun with, I'm that one."
Meg, I'm not ready to be alone.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I don't know how to reset my router.<eos> I don't even know where it is.<eos> I don't even really know what, exactly, it does.<eos> I'm gonna be alone forever.<eos> At least my dead body will serve as food for my cats.<eos> In the eight weeks that it takes for anybody to find me, because nobody gives a fuck.<eos> Why are you watching Bridget Jones?<eos> What did I tell you?
There's no strings attached at all.<eos> Nothing. Is that crazy?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, my God, you're gonna have a baby.<eos> I know!<eos> You're gonna have a baby!<eos> I'm so happy for you.<eos> You'll always be my baby first.<eos> But you do need to grow up.<eos> And you do need to move out by this Friday.
Okay.<eos> You need to move on.<eos> Fine.<eos> Uh, no going backwards, only forwards.<eos> You can't sleep with Tom again.<eos> Well, then, we're gonna have to start going to a different bar, girlfriend.<eos> No, you'll be fine, just don't hit your drink number with him.<eos> What's my drink number?<eos> In every male-female friendship, there's a total number of drinks and if you hit that, it means you will definitely have sex.<eos> So, how many drinks does it take to get you wasted?
Never.<eos> Okay.<eos> How many little meats make up a whole big meat?<eos> I don't know, maybe four?<eos> I've had seven.<eos> Eight. I meant eight.<eos> Is it four, or is it eight?<eos> It's eight, or more.<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> Who told you that?
Like, we just met 30 seconds ago.<eos> Honestly, like, if we're not gonna make it through this, I don't think we're gonna make it at all.<eos> So, why don't you just, like, let her rip?<eos> Okay.<eos> Like, let it all out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How awesome was that?<eos> That feels so good.<eos> Right?<eos> Who are you, again?
Look at this guy, right?<eos> That's the John McClane of Christmas trees.<eos> Like, you cannot kill this guy.<eos> We load him up with a bunch of water, stuff one of those self-pouring cat bottles on the side, you're good to go for, like, three weeks.<eos> I'm telling you, you're gonna be begging this guy to die.<eos> Then, in three weeks we throw this guy out on the street, and get ready for Valentine's Day. "We" get ready for Valentine's Day?<eos> Yeah, hearts, candy, you name it.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no. That's not...<eos> Listen, in three weeks from now, I think the novelty of this whole thing will have worn off and I think, the reality will set in, which is that I work all the time and I probably would never see you, and I'd probably have to cancel all of our dates.
You're not her mom.<eos> What are you...<eos> What are you... What do you mean?<eos> We were just singing, David.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, but when it comes to Phoebe, I get very protective.<eos> And, you can't just...<eos> Look, I'm really sorry.<eos> I didn't know that that was a thing.<eos> I'm not trying to, like...<eos> I guess I didn't know that that would upset you because you don't actually ever really share anything with me.
I guess I didn't know that that would upset you because you don't actually ever really share anything with me.<eos> Do you know how I found out your wife passed away?<eos> From your doorman, David.<eos> Yeah, well.<eos> I just thought you were divorced.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> It's just been two years, okay?<eos> Phoebe's not ready for all that.<eos> I have no idea what it's like to be a parent.<eos> But, I feel like you have to open up to Phoebe about her mom.
Great.<eos> Me, too.<eos> You go first.<eos> I'm getting married.<eos> What?<eos> That's, uh...<eos> Look, your computer programs are total bullshit.<eos> Your algorithms?<eos> Also, total bullshit, all right?<eos> Just because the music stops, doesn't mean you got to sit in the closest chair.
Huh?<eos> Hi. I didn't see you, right over there.<eos> It's a good hiding spot.<eos> Uh, listen.<eos> I've been thinking about you a lot.<eos> Look, David, I'm sorry, I...<eos> I can't do this.<eos> You made it so clear to me, that you didn't want to, so...<eos> That's not why I came here at all.<eos> I just came here to apologize to you for being such an asshole.
But, uh, are you okay?<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Happy Birthday.<eos> See?<eos> I told you this would be fun.<eos> Although, I thought one of them was, like, gonna punch each other and that hasn't happened yet.<eos> Robin, this isn't a joke.<eos> This is my life.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I guess you wouldn't actually understand that, because you've never really cared about anybody enough to ever get hurt.

Pop to the back of the head!<eos> Donnie!<eos> What's the matter with you, shooting a gun at church?<eos> I had to figure out a whole new TV schedule, you know, for supper.<eos> You know, 'cause I like to eat, and, I mean, this is the time that she gave me for dinner, right?<eos> When I was growing up, 6:00 is dinnertime, and she knows that.<eos> She knows.<eos> So... Why not just open your heart?<eos> Be honest with her.<eos> Tell your mom to call you back after you've eaten.
Tell your mom to call you back after you've eaten.<eos> I mean, what does it matter to her what kind of cheese I have on my sandwich?<eos> It's up to me what I like.<eos> -Yeah, I...<eos> I make the choices...<eos> -I'm sorry to cut this short, Ted.<eos> I need a word with him.<eos> I like Swiss cheese.<eos> Read my mind, kid.<eos> Don't tell me you're here to bitch about the air-conditionin'.
If you want to be there, you should be.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> What you did was wrong.<eos> But are you sorry about it?<eos> Then He forgives you.<eos> No.<eos> No matter what you've done... if you need Him, He has to be there for you.<eos> That's the whole point.<eos> God doesn't hold grudges.<eos> If you get down on your knees... and you listen... and I mean really listen...
It's... I'm getting... I had to jump out of a plane 30.000 feet.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> Meantime, stay out of trouble.<eos> Get rid of your credit cards, hold up, and lay low.<eos> Oh, I'm layin' low, all right.<eos> Now, listen, I need you to wire me some...<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You...<eos> The moral of this sad-ass story is don't believe what you hear.<eos> I know the little snitch who told you, too.
Hanks as Waitstill: "173 Boulevard Saint-Germain,<eos> "Dearest Martha, These long silences surely "are trying.<eos> "Why don't you write, "even if you send no more than a postal card?<eos> "I shall certainly hope for a word from you tomorrow.<eos> "I think I shall have to try out for the wounded love section "at the Paris Opera.<eos> "Now do, please, write me.<eos> Ever yours, Waitstill."<eos> Goldman as Martha: "My darling Waitstill, "I am terribly lonely without you,<eos> "The fact of thinking of Hastings "off in his little aloneness "and Martha by herself and you in Paris<eos> "and of myself here has been early too much. "I think that the experience has made me realize "how much I love you and how horrible it would be if anything should happen to you."
I knew that Martha was still in peril.<eos> How would I tell our children that their mother hadn't come home?<eos> This is the letter I received when I was 8 years old.<eos> "Dear Hastings, I am sending you this letter by clipper.<eos> "I love you, and I miss you very much.<eos> "Now I have some very important news from you.<eos> "Here in France today, the children do not have "enough food.<eos> "I shall not return home with Dad.<eos> "I must wait until I can make all the arrangements<eos> "for the children, so I must give up seeing you until about your birthday."
- Yeah.<eos> - And that what we needed was a new...<eos> - Oh, fuck, what's that word?<eos> - A new what?<eos> Like a new...<eos> - Like a, you know...<eos> Come on.<eos> - Oh, I know.<eos> No, I know what you mean.<eos> - But you're so cute when you struggle.
- Okay, let me guess, you have a Colombian snitch who gave you that name?<eos> - They prefer to be called informants...<eos> - I know what they prefer to be called.<eos> How long have you known him?<eos> - Long enough.<eos> What is this, 20 Questions?<eos> - Long enough.<eos> - And how much is you offer?<eos> - 250K.<eos> What do you care?
Don't worry, man.<eos> I called your wife and told her you were gonna be late for dinner 'cause you were locked in a closet, you know.<eos> Bob, we're all waiting for you to come out the closet.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> So, this is all just a joke to you?<eos> Oh, come on, man.<eos> You need a beer.<eos> You need to relax.<eos> I don't want a beer, I want answers.<eos> Bro, what do I have to do to make you happy, man?
Could get a little messy.<eos> You serious?<eos> Fucking hell.<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> Bobby, come on.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What, no coffee?<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - Fuck you, Bobby.<eos> You didn't forget?
You got the best fucking job in the world.<eos> I can't believe I have to talk you into this shit.<eos> Bob, I know these people, man.<eos> You gotta play with them, you gotta drink with them, you gotta fuck with them.<eos> That's the way you get their trust.<eos> Hey, I'm alive, aren't I?<eos> Oh, my God, you're a piece of work, Bob.<eos> You're a fucking piece of work.<eos> I mean, why are you even doing this, Bob?<eos> Why do you even bother?
- It matters.<eos> It's a special occasion.<eos> - I know.<eos> - And I want it to be special, okay.<eos> I'm just wondering where my little Bobby the accountant went?<eos> - Nowhere, I'm right here.<eos> - Kinda liked him.<eos> Hey. Kinda like you.<eos> You look beautiful tonight, by the way.<eos> I have never seen you with a pocket scarf.
- You're not calling me a liar?<eos> - No.<eos> But you said that I told you that I wanted an anniversary cake.<eos> Sir, I'm sorry.<eos> We have to understand something, you and me.<eos> - You can read?<eos> All right.<eos> - I can read, sir.<eos> When I look at this cake it says to me, "Happy Anniversary."<eos> What does it say to you?
- I can read, sir.<eos> When I look at this cake it says to me, "Happy Anniversary."<eos> What does it say to you?<eos> It says, "Happy Anniversary!" "Happy Anniversary," doesn't it?<eos> - Stop!<eos> - Get that fucking thing away from me!<eos> Jesus.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?<eos> I'm sorry, Ev.<eos> That was the most degrading, vicious, disgusting thing I have ever seen you do.
The only difference is, in my business, nothing good ever comes in the absence of trust.<eos> Without it there is no loyalty.<eos> And when there is no loyalty, it never ends well.<eos> It's actually amazing how much these little things pick up, huh?<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Hey, I wanted to tell you, you were pretty good today.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah, well, you're here because of me, and I feel responsible for your safety.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> You don't have to worry about me.
They inject you with that fucking adrenalin shit so you don't pass out before any of that.<eos> Man, they cut open your fucking eyes so you can't shut them, and then they're gonna bring in your little fucking family.<eos> They'll cut your son's head off with a cheese wire.<eos> They'll do the same to your little girl.<eos> And then, they'll cut your wife's tits off right in front of you and they won't feel a fucking thing.<eos> Last but not least, they're gonna cut your fucking head off and send it to your buddies down at Customs.<eos> You could have retired, couldn't you?<eos> You made a choice.<eos> And this is mine.<eos> Now, I hope you don't mind, but I got you something.
I'd be stranding her on this ship for the rest of her life.<eos> Well, you can't do that.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> I'm here for you.<eos> Arthur, you're a machine.<eos> See? You can't feel that.<eos> You don't have feelings.<eos> See?<eos> That doesn't hurt.<eos> And you don't even mind.
I can't get off this ship. I can't get off this ship.<eos> I can't get off.<eos> No!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> Aurora... I know nothing I can say will make this okay.<eos> But please, listen.<eos> I was so alone... for so long.<eos> It felt like I was disappearing.<eos> The night I first saw you, I was ready to...
The outer door is jammed.<eos> We've got to open that door and cool the reactor down... or the whole ship is gonna blow.<eos> How?<eos> I got to go out there.<eos> Open it from the outside.<eos> I open the door, I get clear.<eos> You blow that fire into space.<eos> You get clear?<eos> You can talk to me through this.<eos> What happens to you when that door opens?
What are you saying?<eos> With Gus's ID, it can be like hibernation inside the AutoDoc.<eos> You can go back to sleep.<eos> But there's only one AutoDoc.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you're gonna lay down in it, and fall asleep.<eos> And you'll wake up on Homestead II.<eos> And you'll write your book.<eos> You'll finish your journey.<eos> You'd do what you set out to do.
Now, Elizabeth Bennet, you get back there.<eos> You get back there.<eos> - No. - And you face up to your future... Excuse me.<eos> Mr. Bennet!<eos> Bugger.<eos> Lizzy!<eos> Lizzy, you will marry Mr. Collins or I shall never speak to you again!<eos> You talk to her.<eos> Lizzy! An unhappy alternative is before you.<eos> Your mother will never speak to you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins.

- Mr. Darcy...<eos> - It's all right.<eos> He said you'd come.<eos> Wickham said you'd come.<eos> Mr. Darcy...<eos> The bastard.<eos> My God, you're so predictable.<eos> I knew by taking young Lydia, you'd have to protect the Bennets' honor.<eos> So, come to kill me then, Fitz?<eos> On the contrary, I've come to make you an offer.

You think so?<eos> Well, I can take it.<eos> They became the king and queen of Gotham city.<eos> And god help anyone who disrespected the queen.<eos> We finally meet.<eos> He don't shake hands.<eos> But sit down and have a drink.<eos> Hey, J.<eos> On behalf of everybody, welcome back.<eos> I wanted to come by and personally say thank you.
A sorceress from another dimension.<eos> Archaeologist Dr. June Moone...<eos> Wondered into the wrong cave.<eos> June...<eos> She opened something she shouldn't have... releasing a metahuman more powerful than any we've encountered.<eos> The enchantress.<eos> Enchantress aka dr June Moone she inhabits Dr. Moone's body now.<eos> Where is this witch?<eos> In my pocket.<eos> Now tell him why she won't turn you into a frog.
Now tell him why she won't turn you into a frog.<eos> Some say the witch has a secret buried heart... And whoever finds it can control the witch.<eos> So we searched the cave where she turned up... And we found her heart.<eos> - That thing's her heart?<eos> She's vulnerable without it.<eos> You want to put our national security in the hands of...<eos> Witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles?<eos> Don't forget about the joker's girlfriend.<eos> These are villains, Amanda.<eos> What makes you think you can control them?
Why don't you kiss her ass?<eos> She's in charge.<eos> Welcome, ma'am.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm here to assist you in anyway.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Are you the devil?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Ain't you scared?<eos> Why'd they put you down here?
She had a mouth.<eos> Listen up!<eos> In your necks...<eos> Injection you got, it's a nanite explosive.<eos> It's the size of a rice grain but it's powerful as a hand grenade.<eos> You disobey me, you die.<eos> You try to escape, you die.<eos> You otherwise irritate or vex me, and guess what?<eos> You die.<eos> I'm known to be quite vexing. I'm just forewarning you.
I'm coming for you.<eos> Look at that pretty lights!<eos> Are you guys seeing this?<eos> What happened?<eos> Terror attack.<eos> Dirty bombs, bad guys shooting up the place with aks.<eos> You know, usual shit.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, you're a bad liar.<eos> I don't know if they told you... But I'm a hitman.
Hey. I like these odds, mate.<eos> You just say the word.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah. Uh.<eos> Hold that thought.<eos> Rick, why do they look like that?<eos> Stay cool.<eos> What the hell are they?<eos> You cut and run. I'll blow your head off.
Helos extract us off the roof.<eos> - It's Miller time.<eos> - Check<eos> Waller?<eos> We're about to enter the building.<eos> Get that chopper ready.<eos> What do say we get this over with?<eos> What the hell? Deadshot.<eos> Fall back.<eos> You mind if we tag along?
I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole of a locked closet... which also happens to be my...<eos> Your bedroom.<eos> Lucky. I slept in a dishwasher box.<eos> You had a dishwasher.<eos> I didn't even know sleep.<eos> It was pretty much 24/7 ball gags, brownie mix and clown porn.<eos> Who would do such a thing?<eos> Hopefully you, later tonight?<eos> Hey, what can I get for $275 and a... a Yogurtland rewards card?<eos> Baby, about 48 minutes of whatever the fuck you want.
Bernadette is not going anywhere, because you're not going anywhere.<eos> Drink.<eos> You're right.<eos> Cancer is only in my liver, lungs, prostate, and brain.<eos> All things I can live without.<eos> You belong here at home.<eos> Surrounded by your Voltron and your Bernadette, and your me.<eos> Listen, we both know that cancer is a shit-show.<eos> Like, a Yakov-Smirnoff-opening-for-the- Spin-Doctors-at-the-Iowa-State-Fair shit-show.<eos> And under no circumstances will I take you to that show.

You are so relentlessly annoying.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Never heard that before.<eos> Why don't you do us all a favor and shut the fuck up?<eos> Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you.<eos> See, here's the problem with round-the-clock torture... is that you can't really step it up from there.<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> If this doesn't unlock your mutation, then, well... nothing will.<eos> Now, what we're going to do is lower the oxygen concentration in the air... to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.
You know the funniest part of this?<eos> You still think we're making you a superhero.<eos> You.<eos> A dishonorable discharge.<eos> Hip-deep in hookers.<eos> You're nothing.<eos> Little secret, Wade.<eos> This workshop doesn't make superheroes, we make super-slaves.<eos> We're gonna fit you with a control collar and auction you off to the highest bidder.<eos> Who knows what they'll have you doing?
Where's Francis?<eos> No!<eos> Please!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> I'm so sorry!<eos> You little spider monkey!<eos> Where... is... Francis?<eos> This is confusing.<eos> Is it sexist to hit you?<eos> Is it more sexist to not hit you?
And I think she's in love with me.<eos> Wait, pretty sure Robin loves Batman, too.<eos> Al?<eos> Morning, sleepyhead.<eos> It smells like old lady pants in here.<eos> Yes, I'm old.<eos> I wear pants.<eos> But you're no lady.<eos> So comfy.<eos> Upside of being blind: I've never seen you in Crocs.
Cease fire!<eos> Fellas! Hey! Hey!<eos> You only work for that shit-spackled muppet fart.<eos> So, I'mma give you a chance for y'all to lay down your firearms... in exchange for preferential, bordering on gentle... possibly even lover-like treatment.<eos> Fine.<eos> Commando!<eos> Teabag!<eos> Bob?<eos> Wade?<eos> Oh, my God, I haven't seen you since...
What better way to crawl back inside that head of yours?<eos> Oh, you never left.<eos> But you did, asshole!<eos> Deep breath, darling.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Wrong choice of words.<eos> I hope they blocked pain to your every last nerve.<eos> 'Cause I'mma go lookin'!<eos> I hear you grow back body parts now, Wade.<eos> When I'm finished... parts will have to grow back you.
Rough?<eos> I live in a crackhouse.<eos> With a family of 12.<eos> Every night we spoon for warmth.<eos> Everybody fights for Noelle. She's the fattest.<eos> There's nothing that we don't share.<eos> Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.<eos> So, you live in a house.<eos> I should have come and found you sooner.<eos> But, baby, the guy under this mask, he ain't the same one that you remember.
Sales Analyst. It sounds so impressive.<eos> Junior Sales Analyst.<eos> But the "Junior" is gonna be gone by Christmas.<eos> And Will's finally being paid at LA Weekly.<eos> - Way to go, you two.<eos> - I know. I told you guys, we're a power couple.<eos> Will, there's a little something to get you started.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> Thanks, Mom.<eos> Will, did I ever tell you what my first job was?
- You do that. - Yeah.<eos> Will do. Will do.<eos> Thanks for everything you do, Officer.<eos> Sorry, kid.<eos> Shit rolls downhill. You know what I'm saying?<eos> You get it. You get it.<eos> You'll be all right.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Hey, Dad?<eos> I gotta ask you for money.
You've got an incredible amount of torque.<eos> You deserve so much more money than this, but I'm on a teacher's salary.<eos> If you want to see the show, you gotta pay for it.<eos> No, I'm just here for the free buffet.<eos> The buffet is free 'cause you're supposed to be spending money on me.<eos> I guess I found a loophole.<eos> - Your friend's got an attitude.<eos> - He's out of work.<eos> So buy him a lap dance to cheer him up.<eos> - Yeah. - I'd like to get to know you sometime.
Thirty years, one company.<eos> Wow!<eos> An employer sees this, and they see a dinosaur.<eos> Well, I can't say that I agree with you there, Hernando.<eos> - Fernando.<eos> - It's Fernando?<eos> You should do whatever you can to look younger.<eos> For starters, lose the beard.<eos> An image consult is included with the Platinum Package.<eos> We'll give you a workstation, some place to go every morning. And we will produce a video résumé that will set you above the rabble.
Oh, to go, please.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, hey, honey. How are you?<eos> I'm at the office.<eos> Oh, that music? Yeah, well, I...<eos> That's...<eos> You know Jerry. He's just trying to jazz up his...<eos> I should get back to that meeting, honey.<eos> I'll see you in a few hours, okay?<eos> I love you too.
I've a real job for a real company. The kind of job that you've been bugging me to get for years. And if I don't produce an immaculate cup of urine, it's back to the unemployment line.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> No, it's not what I want.<eos> I just don't feel comfortable doing this.<eos> Air conditioning, so... - No.<eos> - It was 100 degrees in that warehouse, and you did whatever it took to get off the floor.<eos> And that's what I'm doing.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> I'm doing what you told me.<eos> What happened to you?
Could you put me in touch with that fellow from your video?<eos> Yes, sir. In six months to a year. Depending on good behavior.<eos> What the fuck? What the fuck!<eos> How is it possible to be this bad?<eos> Ball.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kwan, let's review the basics.<eos> Give and go!<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Big Stuff, anyone ever show you how to set a pick?
Well, my supervisor's back from leave, and she is a total ballbuster.<eos> I mean, she was on my ass about my e-mails, and my Facebook page, and how I dress in front of everybody.<eos> It was humiliating.<eos> Wait, this isn't how you dress at work, is it?<eos> Dad, I'm the video guy.<eos> Who cares what I look like?<eos> Look, just stop, okay?<eos> Stop for a second.<eos> Your clients pay $30,000 for your services.<eos> They care what you look like.
Who cares what I look like?<eos> Look, just stop, okay?<eos> Stop for a second.<eos> Your clients pay $30,000 for your services.<eos> They care what you look like.<eos> You need to conform to their standards, not the other way around.<eos> And the fact that you can't grasp that is mind-boggling!<eos> What is up with you?<eos> What is up with me is, I've sent out hundreds of résumés, and I've gotten only three interviews.<eos> What is up with me is, I don't want to hear you bitch and moan that your employer makes you act in a professional manner.
I know. I just...<eos> I just want them to take me seriously at work.<eos> Everybody takes you seriously.<eos> - They do?<eos> - Yes, they do.<eos> Sophomore year. We're running Ultimate Frisbee drills down in the lounge.<eos> Ethan comes in and says that there's a situation that I need to handle downstairs.<eos> So, I go downstairs, and I see this tiny little person in pajamas and slippers, and she is so, so angry.<eos> I was trying to study.<eos> The moment that I saw you, I knew that you were someone to take seriously.
I've rid this company of the dead wood.<eos> We are leaner and meaner.<eos> This is a contract.<eos> It's a what?<eos> You're now Vice President of Corporate Communications.<eos> Your salary is $52,000.<eos> 52,000?<eos> You'll be doing the work of three people.<eos> Get used to eating dinner at your desk.<eos> Now that I've turned you around, it was easier to kick you upstairs than to train someone new.
Just got to turn it in.<eos> Where did you find that?<eos> I called Lon Zimmet.<eos> He went on and on about you, and used the word "cock" like, 1,000 times.<eos> Yeah, he does that.<eos> I need to say something.<eos> What?<eos> I'm 22 years old and I have no idea what I'm gonna do with the rest of my life.<eos> And I'm fine with that.<eos> I have a lot to offer the world, and this is just the beginning, and if you want to take a job with some shady start-up company that has nothing to offer you but stock options and a dream, then you should do that!
Fucking great!<eos> Will, I'd like to officially welcome you to the Sweat team.<eos> Thanks, Lon. But I'm gonna have to turn down your offer.<eos> - What?<eos> - I've started my own production company, but I would be honored to have Sweat as my first client.<eos> In other words, don't just feel special.<eos> Be special.<eos> Do you love your wife?<eos> Of course you do.<eos> But when she tells you she's going shopping, how do you know she's not actually going to a sordid motel like this one?
Oh, I'm sorry. See you around, Max McGrath.<eos> Charlie Quinn.<eos> He was our intern.<eos> Brilliant kid.<eos> He was very good at bringing us coffee at 2:00 in the morning.<eos> Yes, he was. Which happened just about every single night.<eos> Yes. And I'm sure you...<eos> Hi, hon.<eos> Hey.<eos> Wow, God, look at you.
Yes, he was. Which happened just about every single night.<eos> Yes. And I'm sure you...<eos> Hi, hon.<eos> Hey.<eos> Wow, God, look at you.<eos> You remember Miles, don't you?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't. No, he doesn't. He doesn't remember.<eos> I am the guy who used to send you all the random Christmas presents.
Oh. Frita.<eos> Wow, that is... Yes, and that's privileged information by the way, so.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> You don't have to worry.<eos> Good.<eos> Because, you know, I know a secret about you, too.<eos> What?<eos> Well...<eos> You haven't hooked up with any of the cliques.<eos> But you're friendly with everyone. You don't attract a lot of attention, but you talk just enough. So that people don't think you're weird.
I don't remember, but the important thing is...<eos> I found you and now that... Wait.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> Ah.<eos> Good question.<eos> You're from space?<eos> I think so.<eos> You're an alien?<eos> Yes!<eos> And you are Max McGrath. Yeah. I'm here to protect you from everything that's trying to kill us.
No, you didn't. Don't lie.<eos> We've been attacked!<eos> I, uh, said my backpack is heavy.<eos> Stupid books. Am I right?<eos> Freak. See, Max?<eos> I protected you. Whoa!<eos> Incoming.<eos> Max?<eos> Sofia.<eos> What happened to you yesterday? You okay?
When you get worked up, you generate energy.<eos> Clearly, "my mom" makes you upset.<eos> No, she's just...<eos> It just sucks. What?<eos> Everything that happened with my dad, she just kept moving us from place to place.<eos> I know.<eos> Yeah, no, I get it, right.<eos> Why am I telling you this?<eos> Because I'm here for you, Max.<eos> I'm here to protect you.
Max?<eos> You know, sometimes I just wish my dad was still here.<eos> That I could, I don't know, talk to him, or even know what his laugh sounded like.<eos> I don't even know him, but I miss him.<eos> I understand.<eos> I don't even know where my home is, but I miss it, too.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was just kind of going off your vibe anyway.<eos> Although it could help if you could remember who was trying to kill you. Hey, us.
That I could, I don't know, talk to him, or even know what his laugh sounded like.<eos> I don't even know him, but I miss him.<eos> I understand.<eos> I don't even know where my home is, but I miss it, too.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was just kind of going off your vibe anyway.<eos> Although it could help if you could remember who was trying to kill you. Hey, us.<eos> You.<eos> All right, look, if you can just remember something, I don't know. Maybe more from the memory that we saw, it might help us.
The guys in the black vans?<eos> No, the Ultralinks.<eos> They always come for us.<eos> Uh, just...<eos> No trespassing. Seriously?<eos> All caps, Max.<eos> Looks pretty serious to me.<eos> Max, wait.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, so, if you don't remember any details, how do we trigger that memory thing that we had?
No, the Ultralinks.<eos> They always come for us.<eos> Uh, just...<eos> No trespassing. Seriously?<eos> All caps, Max.<eos> Looks pretty serious to me.<eos> Max, wait.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, so, if you don't remember any details, how do we trigger that memory thing that we had?<eos> Does anything around here remind you of anything? Yes!
Let's go talk to Miles.<eos> Okay, so, apparently, my dad, who I thought was a scientist, knew you, an alien, which is nuts. And the two of you were attacked for some reason by a wind-monster thing.<eos> Actually, Max, it's super, super scary. See, Ultralinks can manipulate the elements. Air and wind and fire...<eos> They can control air itself to create storms or tornados, which is a kind of storm, but also like...<eos> So, my dad, he must have... hurricanes or tsunami or typhoon...<eos> What, I don't know...<eos> Sofia. Max, we can still kill her.<eos> Okay, I need you to be quiet for a second, please.<eos> It's like you actually want me to run you over.<eos> No, we want you to go away. Shh.
Sorry!<eos> This is not happening.<eos> Max, we have two vans in pursuit. Okay.<eos> We need some kind of, like, a plan. Okay.<eos> Time to suit up. No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> We have to...<eos> We have to like split up.<eos> Okay, if you can send them on like a wild goose chase, or something, then I can head to N-Tek and talk to Miles.<eos> I must protect you, Max. Just buy me some time!
A thirsty man is prone to drowning.<eos> Come out, Max.<eos> Or...<eos> Wait, is that it?<eos> - That's it.<eos> - What's it?<eos> We just have to give him what he wants.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Oh, actually, that's really smart.<eos> There's no one here to save you. Come out.
Hey, I wanna introduce you to somebody.<eos> Steel, you're alive.<eos> Hi, Molly.<eos> We have a lot to talk about.<eos> You totally married an alien.<eos> Hey, what's wrong with that?<eos> The night your father died, I didn't know what to do.<eos> The whole town thought it was an accident, a freak storm.<eos> But I knew the Ultralinks had come for them and I was afraid they would come for you, too.<eos> So, I did the only thing I could think of to protect you. I ran.
But now I couldn't be prouder that you did.<eos> What's your name?<eos> So, are there more Ultralinks out there?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why do you think I watch the stars so much?<eos> Why haven't they come for me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe because you didn't have the power yet.<eos> But you're a threat now and they'll come for you.<eos> I thought I could protect you, but I can't.
Why haven't they come for me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe because you didn't have the power yet.<eos> But you're a threat now and they'll come for you.<eos> I thought I could protect you, but I can't.<eos> You know you're not exactly making me feel any better.<eos> But I do know one thing, okay?<eos> You will not have to do this alone.<eos> I love you, bud.<eos> I love you, too, Mom.
The 9th of May.<eos> Birthday.<eos> How in hell did I end up here again..<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Twelve hours earlier.<eos> My birthday actually began the way of all my birthdays.<eos> Hello Darlin.<eos> Just ring to wish you a happy bday.
Mom?<eos> It's six o'clock in the morning.<eos> I now use FaceTime.<eos> learned from Una.<eos> It's really great.<eos> The purpose of FaceTime is that you do not have to keep your ear to the phone.<eos> What stupid of me.<eos> There you are.<eos> Around this time, 43 years ago ...<eos> I ate Indian lamb in an attempt to chase you out.
- Bye.<eos> Maybe that's why Mark Darcy and I never made it.<eos> I always felt like a rattling, hag, even when we were together.<eos> I was not going to keep stabbing at the negative things.<eos> Nobody on my work knew at least that it was my birthday.<eos> Or how old I would be.<eos> Surprise.<eos> Congratulations, Bridget.<eos> Or so I thought.<eos> Who told you?
Against it, girl.<eos> Praise the Lord for the gay community.<eos> What fears you today carry with you ...<eos> I want you take those fears and to them says they should opsodemieteren.<eos> And.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Bikes but, sexy girls. Bicycles.<eos> I'm sorry, Bridget, but I have to cancel.<eos> I did not tell you today, but Eduardo and I are going to adopt.
Turn on your TV now.<eos> Look at your TV. Now.<eos> Put it on Channel 4.<eos> Bridget, I've found him.<eos> He is the dating website guru.<eos> You have to trust the science.<eos> Algorithms do not lie.<eos> You fucking slept with a billionaire.<eos> Tell me, Bridget.<eos> What attracted you initially to the billionaire Jack Qwant?
It's ... much better than you are mentally unbalanced.<eos> I'm about twelve weeks pregnant.<eos> Okay. Right.<eos> So you mean that it was the music?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's quite a surprise.<eos> Yes but... it goes well with me, you should know that ...<eos> I want nothing from you.<eos> Besides a complete DNA check and an assessment of my medical records.<eos> I just do not want you to come out.
Do not you think I have it on Jerry Springer?<eos> - No, I'm just happy.<eos> I'm not sure if you are mine or those cute lieutenant colonel of the bowling club.<eos> It was just a joke.<eos> You have my feet.<eos> I've always had dainty feet.<eos> Just tell the truth, Bridget.<eos> There you are always great.<eos> Mark, I have some exciting news.<eos> I have to tell you something funny.
Because...<eos> Damn.<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> Because we believe in 'Hard News' ... We believe we are ready and ahead ... by asking the questions that the world wants to answer.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay. Career collapsed.<eos> Both men in the same room.<eos> What can go wrong there now?<eos> I hope you do not mind me suddenly stand before you.
I'm sorry, I got your messages.<eos> Hi.<eos> It does not matter.<eos> There you can put anything.<eos> Which you need to include.<eos> It may be your job.<eos> No worries.<eos> I help her.<eos> - Yes, I can see that.<eos> Okay, you need to relax.
Mark thinks the baby is not his, and I let him believe it's mine.<eos> That's why he's gone.<eos> Why would he think that?<eos> - Because I took care of that.<eos> Because I wanted you for myself.<eos> We could be so good for each other.<eos> 97 percent.<eos> - On paper.<eos> But love does not happen on paper.<eos> Sometimes you love someone because he is not the same as you. And sometimes you love someone because it feels like home.
This place is full of single mothers, single fathers, bisexuals, surrogates.<eos> And they are all so sweet and so normal.<eos> I even have two gay men in the team.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> Who would have expected now?<eos> - Everybody.<eos> I'm so proud of you, honey.<eos> Do you know?<eos> What you do is not easy, but if anyone can it's you.<eos> That child is the happiest guy on earth to have you as his mother.
Please contact your bank.<eos> Nee.<eos> Damn.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Everything is suddenly against.<eos> Right.<eos> Nee, nee.<eos> Okay, new pre-birth planning.<eos> I, Bridget Jones, best mother will be in the world.<eos> I will try to remember you in a store ... or you stop a machine like that woman did with her cat.
just think the pain away.<eos> - Get out, both of you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I've changed my mind.<eos> I've changed my mind.<eos> You can do this.<eos> You can do it.<eos> We do this together.<eos> Remember what life has brought so far.<eos> You've turned into catastrophes triumphs ... with your pure, joyful, indefatigable, contagious zest for life. You have this pregnancy almost accomplished on your own ... despite one insane mother, oppressed women and cheating boyfriends who do not deserve you.
And now, it's time for a breakdown.<eos> Mmm, mmm, mmm, yeah--<eos> Man, I told you Robbie Wheirdicht showers here during first period.<eos> Why doesn't he just shower at home like a normal person?<eos> Look at him.<eos> Does anything about that look normal to you?
- If you want me to cancel, I will.<eos> You know? If that's what you want, I don't mind.<eos> I mean, it's a little weird, but whatever.<eos> I'll just see if the doctor can fit us in tomorrow.<eos> - How about at lunch time?<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, babe.
You gotta see it, dude.<eos> Total classic.<eos> It's my favorite all-time movie.<eos> Then I realized high school was nothing like Sixteen Candles.<eos> And I'll never be like Molly Ringwald.<eos> Yeah, well, depends on who you ask.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> For me, I--<eos> What's going on?<eos> Hey, man, I just wanna say that I'm really sorry about what Trevor and those guys did to you back then.
No biggie.<eos> I don't even think about it anymore.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here's the secret.<eos> You know what I did, Jet?<eos> I took all that stuff and I balled it up real tight and then I shoved it way down deep.<eos> And I just pretty much ignore it.<eos> You know, that sounds really unhealthy, Bob.<eos> Hey, I gotta tell you.
I think it says a lot about our relationship.<eos> Wait, hold up, wait.<eos> What're you doing? Oh, my God!<eos> Here's the thing, though.<eos> There's only one way for you to get out.<eos> What's that?<eos> You gotta get in first.<eos> What is it that--<eos> What-what! Take my gun, Jet, we may have to kill some people.<eos> - Come on, it's not gonna bite you.
What the hell am I supposed to do about Maggie?<eos> Get down, Jet!<eos> Shit!<eos> Look out, Bob!<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Who is that?<eos> Bob?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Larry.<eos> Thought you retired.
- I know what you're...<eos> Come here.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You know what?<eos> We're leaving!<eos> Let's go!<eos> This is not real.<eos> It's real to me.<eos> You know what, Calvin?<eos> If you can't commit to working on our marriage, then you need to let me know.
What-what?<eos> Oh, my-<eos> - Dr. Dan, I had nothing to do with this.<eos> He's fine.<eos> I'll get you some water in a little bit.<eos> - Thanks,doc.<eos> - You know-- That's it.<eos> That is it.<eos> That is it.<eos> All right, Jet. I see that Harris has given you a button to push.
- Dr. Dan, I had nothing to do with this.<eos> He's fine.<eos> I'll get you some water in a little bit.<eos> - Thanks,doc.<eos> - You know-- That's it.<eos> That is it.<eos> That is it.<eos> All right, Jet. I see that Harris has given you a button to push.<eos> Relax, I would've taken the same deal, too, if I was in your shoes.<eos> Otherwise, she wouldn't let you out of her sight, right?
So, you know, if we could--<eos> Say no more.<eos> It's my pleasure.<eos> I've been there.<eos> These international accounts can be very, very tricky if you don't have the right clearances.<eos> You can get a bunch of digital red tape.<eos> I'm happy to help, you know?<eos> Robbie.<eos> You're such a blast from the past, buddy.<eos> How long has it been since I saw you?
Now, before you go, stay seated one second.<eos> Give me two minutes, sit down.<eos> Men, a few years ago... I found the Lord Almighty.<eos> And, ever since then, my life has been completely different.<eos> Okay?<eos> He's got a plan for each and every one of us and, in his infinite wisdom, he makes no mistakes.<eos> You're right about that.<eos> I think the Lord put you here because he wants me to get something off my chest.<eos> He wants me to clear my conscience and he wants me to ask for forgiveness.<eos> Robert. What I did to you at that rally in senior year was a cowardly act.
So, here's what you're going to do.<eos> You're going to tell us exactly where you and Bob are.<eos> Then you're going to go outside and you're going to keep Bob on-site until we arrive.<eos> And if he leaves, you lose.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Oh, hey. I don't know what happened in there, and I just froze up.<eos> I locked up.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look,Bob,L"<eos> No, I gotta tell you something, CJ, listen.
I told Harris where we are.<eos> They were going to hurt Maggie.<eos> I had to.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Freeze, Bob!<eos> Hands on your head!<eos> Do it now!<eos> I know you know how this goes, so I'll spare you the dramatics.<eos> I'll ask you just once.
I didn't have a choice.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Freeze, Bob!<eos> Hands on your head!<eos> Do it now!<eos> I know you know how this goes, so I'll spare you the dramatics.<eos> I'll ask you just once.<eos> Where are the satellite encryption codes?<eos> Aw. What's the matter, Bob?<eos> Are you upset that your friend turned you in?
- Okay... - Go sit down.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> - Sit down! Sit down!<eos> - Okay, okay, okay.<eos> You know, Bob?<eos> This is actually my favorite part of the job.<eos> Thank you for being so uncooperative.<eos> What do you think your little buddy, Joyner, would say if he could see you like this?
This is my friend.<eos> - Oh! -It's my buddy.<eos> His name's Snake Gyllenhaal.<eos> - He guards my lunch.<eos> - Okay, that's enough.<eos> It's gotta be Harris, right?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean, she's gotta be The Black Badger.<eos> It's the only thing that makes sense.<eos> I mean, she's had access to the encryption codes and she's so hot and bothered about pinning this whole thing on you.
Oh, my-- on!<eos> We're going down, Jet!<eos> There's nothing I can do!<eos> - Oh, shit!<eos> - Really quickly...<eos> What's the one thing you wish you'd done in your life?<eos> The one thing I wish I hadn't done is not get in a plane with a guy who didn't check the goddamned fuel!<eos> - Why wouldn't you check the fuel?<eos> - No, something that's real.<eos> What's the one thing you regret not doing for you?
Dude, this is amazing!<eos> I'm so happy for you!<eos> Thank you, Jet!<eos> I feel so free! - Come here.<eos> - No,no,no.<eos> Your 'gunk "vs out.<eos> - Oh. Sorry, Jet.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Hi, Robbie.<eos> - You probably don't remember me.
- Oh. Sorry, Jet.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Hi, Robbie.<eos> - You probably don't remember me.<eos> - Is that Darla McGuckian?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wow! She looks great!<eos> Didn't she used to have a lazy eye?<eos> - Two of them.<eos> - Wow. I can't believe you remember me.
Lisa, if you're watching this footage, I think you're gonna wanna delete it.<eos> How is she?<eos> It's infected and she has a fever.<eos> Did you see anything, like...<eos> Uh, nothing like that.<eos> But we should take her straight to the closest ER tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Hey, James, is that you?<eos> Hey, genius, I think you're sittin' on your walkie.
Close your eyes.<eos> Lisa, I'm so sorry.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> Heather?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Is that really you?<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> James!<eos> James, where are you?<eos> If you don't look at her, she can't hurt you.
I'm not gonna be buried in Venezuela.<eos> I'm not going in.<eos> If I go in, I will be murdered in the face.<eos> Look at me.<eos> - Breathe.<eos> - I'm breathing.<eos> Not like you're drowning.<eos> Slow it down.<eos> Breathe.<eos> If Masovich wanted you dead, he would have ordered those cops to execute you.
At least wait until we leave.<eos> Damn!<eos> All right. Whole night's ruined.<eos> That's just...<eos> - Something is wrong with you.<eos> - I know.<eos> - In the head.<eos> - It's not even...<eos> How did you get here?<eos> Did anyone spot you?
I've been down here on my own forever.<eos> I don't have any more resources.<eos> That was my last safe house.<eos> Well, then, how would I be getting to the inauguration?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I'll wear a wire.<eos> No, you were right.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> We gotta get you out of here.
Yeah. - Seems very nice.<eos> My shoulder, man!<eos> I got shot.<eos> I have thousands of followers all over Venezuela, but I cannot think of anybody as beautiful as you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Muy Bonita, we get it. Okay.<eos> Let's focus on what's important.<eos> Yours truly just received a personal invite to... a certain black-tie event.<eos> You see?<eos> What did I tell you?
- Sam, what we're about to do is...<eos> - I know.<eos> - It's not a book.<eos> - Let's just call it a night.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> - You're worried about me. - No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's why you're a one-woman operation.<eos> Why you push people away with the nicknames.<eos> If you're on your own, you don't have to worry about losing anyone.
- I know.<eos> - It's not a book.<eos> - Let's just call it a night.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> - You're worried about me. - No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's why you're a one-woman operation.<eos> Why you push people away with the nicknames.<eos> If you're on your own, you don't have to worry about losing anyone.<eos> You can't get hurt.
The president... is dead.<eos> ¡Que viva la revolución!<eos> ¡El Toro!<eos> ¡El Toro! ¡El Toro!<eos> ¡El Toro!<eos> Ghost, you did it.<eos> - El Toro, what are you doing here?<eos> - There is nothing to worry about.<eos> I have made a deal with General Ruiz.<eos> And Juan here, he has something to tell you. Oh.
Oh, I can't stand it.<eos> You're doing a Ned talk!<eos> How? How did that...<eos> How did that...?<eos> Wh-what... what...?<eos> Did they just call, or...<eos> They don't just call anybody!<eos> I submitted you, you nutty genius.<eos> You and your marvelous book.<eos> I would've told you earlier, but I was afraid they would reject you.
It's his entire world.<eos> And, no, it's not even about that.<eos> I'm tired of being an afterthought.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Let's sit.<eos> Michelle, I've known you for a few years, and you're pretty damn amazing.<eos> You're kind, you're funny.<eos> - I'm hilarious. - You are hilarious.<eos> And you're not too difficult to look at, if you know what I mean.<eos> And I do think Charlie does love you, in his own way.
You called him a weirdo!<eos> No, but he has a point.<eos> Who wants to be treated like the elephant man?<eos> But, like, you still could've told us.<eos> I mean, who we gonna tell?<eos> Maybe my sisters, but they're,<eos> - like, in seventh grade.<eos> - Don't tell your sisters.<eos> I'm really close to my sisters. That's okay.<eos> But do you tell them - every time you masturbate?
And all I ever wanted was to be normal, and I couldn't let a doctor kill my hope that normal was possible.<eos> Dude, that actually makes sense. That's, like, super zen.<eos> I mean, this is great.<eos> You're normal now.<eos> You got to tell Michelle, play the sympathy card, right?<eos> -I'm gonna hate myself in the morning for saying this, but that could actually be the greatest closing line of all time.<eos> "Hey, baby, I've never had an erection, and I just had elective surgery to remove a tumor from my brain and I'm getting my first erection, looking for the right girl to utilize it on."<eos> Neither one of you fucking say a word to Michelle! Okay?<eos> Besides, we don't even know what's gonna come of this.<eos> Well, hopefully you are.
You're gonna be okay.<eos> There's nothing to worry about.<eos> Actually, more like champagne grapes.<eos> Yeah, I'm still feeling great.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> We're here for you.<eos> I'm sorry we let you down.<eos> We're not doctors so, you know, how could we...?<eos> How you feeling?<eos> When rich told me that the tumor had kept you trapped inside the body of a 7th-grader and that's why you've never had sex or an erection, I felt so happy for you.
If I could create a pill that cured puberty, I could buy France.<eos> Got a minute?<eos> Come on in, please, yes.<eos> I'm sorry about Nikki.<eos> Your face looks a lot better, though.<eos> You know those guys at proactiv, that Adam Levine, they just know what they're doing.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> I actually can't stay long.<eos> I have to pack.<eos> I'm leaving for that cooking retreat thing I told you about.
But you look good.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> It's good to see you, too.<eos> You look good, too.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I wanted to ask you something.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Maybe... you wanted to tell me about Santa Barbara, and maybe you wanted to tell me about Santa Barbara over dinner?<eos> Yeah, I could do that.<eos> Give me an hour and I'll tell you more about it.
You would love it. He has this old villa from 1908 and this amazing cellar with these wines...<eos> Alcoholic much?<eos> And we were out on this veranda, and we were looking up at a million stars...<eos> Okay, we get it.<eos> You had a good time with Bobby.<eos> Are you jealous?<eos> No, I'm not jealous.<eos> How could I be?<eos> I'm just concerned.<eos> If I slept with him, do you think I would be telling you this story?
Can I start over? - Please.<eos> - I have so much to tell you.<eos> I've had an interesting ride. I'm...<eos> I'm still the same person that you knew.<eos> I'm still... Kinda silly, a goof.<eos> I still love your food.<eos> I'm still genuine, kinda weird, truthful, - honest...<eos> - Un-fucking-believable!<eos> You stole our table.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about. - Wait, Pete.
Pardon the interruption, but do you drive a silver Prius?<eos> - I'm in session!<eos> - My office, now!<eos> - We have 25 minutes.<eos> - I'm having you towed.<eos> You are our best and brightest.<eos> How could you allow a patient to fellate you? !<eos> She hadn't yet.<eos> If news of this gets out, our clinic could be gone overnight!<eos> With this Ned talk coming up, what were you thinking?
Hi.<eos> Ugh! Jeez, it's like pure ice up here. An accident waiting to happen, you know?<eos> I mean, somebody should really do something about this, huh?<eos> Ahem. Lemmings.<eos> Anyway, I really should get goin' now.<eos> I've got a seal to go catch and eat and i-- anyway, I uh-- see ya, gotta go.<eos> Bye now.<eos> Babe, look!<eos> A hunt! This trip is finally paying' off.<eos> Any last words before I eat you?
But grandpa always said-- enough about grandpa, norm.<eos> He left us, remember?<eos> He's not here.<eos> We are. The humans won't destroy something they love.<eos> And they love...<eos> Us. Let's give these people what they came a thousand miles to see. A show!<eos> And go!<eos> You ain't seen nothin' yet.<eos> Whales, I need whales.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?
Norm:<eos> Dad, you're not listening, there's more.<eos> There's a human house right here on grandpa's land.<eos> Humansare movingherenow.<eos> Ah, norm, you always did have such an imagination, now, didn't you?<eos> - First with the poetry--<eos> - I swear it's true.<eos> Socrates and I snuck in.<eos> And look-- from Florida.<eos> Norm, you are not to go anywhere near there. Do you hear me?
Ah, norm, you always did have such an imagination, now, didn't you?<eos> - First with the poetry--<eos> - I swear it's true.<eos> Socrates and I snuck in.<eos> And look-- from Florida.<eos> Norm, you are not to go anywhere near there. Do you hear me?<eos> Grandpa's land is off limits.<eos> "Snuck in."<eos> Norm, you shouldn't go onto property that doesn't belong to you.<eos> You should know better. Besides, I'm sure the house you're referring to is simply a research hut.
Ineedyourhelp withthisshot.<eos> Please?<eos> It's a seal, you generalist.<eos> Humans think all animals look the same.<eos> Ouch! Cracked driveway.<eos> Not a good selling point.<eos> Hey, the arctic comes as is.<eos> Who said that?<eos> Mommy.<eos> Sorry, honey. Mommy couldn't call you back.
Well, we need to get him out right now.<eos> Grandpa says it'll blow my cover if I break him out?<eos> He wants me to build an ark?<eos> Oh, no, no. He wants me to focus on the arctic, saving the arctic.<eos> I got it. It all makes sense.<eos> I'll save the arctic first, and then I'll save grandpa.<eos> And then, if I have time, I'll build an ark.<eos> Woman: Makeup!<eos> Hey, norm. Norm, this is my daughter, Olympia.<eos> Olympia, this is the great actor i was telling you about.
The lemmings told us what you've done.<eos> You used your gift and you risked your life to protect ours.<eos> And on behalf of all of us... Thank you.<eos> Ahem. Remember what we discussed?<eos> King: Anewdaydawnsupon us.<eos> We need a leader who feels for the arctic, speaks for the arctic, and always fights for our home.<eos> Norm,I crownyou-- now just a New York minute.<eos> You can't do this without me.<eos> Grandpa!<eos> They all said you drowned. I was 80% sure you were gonna make it.
Now that's what I call a grand entrance.<eos> The tide took me all the way to Greenland, but I hitched a ride with an orca.<eos> He said he was coming back to audition for Stan.<eos> You need therapy.<eos> I have an opening tomorrow afternoon.<eos> Book yourself in. Son, please continue.<eos> Norm, i crown you king.<eos> - That's my brother!<eos> If the clouds clear and the barometric pressure is just right-- wow.<eos> I see magister mundi is teaching you all these fancy new terms already.
Slash-guy who killed his wife using cheap building materials that collapsed on her.<eos> Slash-guy who has got to stop beating himself up about that!<eos> Slash-guy who couldn't make spaghetti soft so they took away his son, so-slash-now he's alone and hiding from the world.<eos> Slash.<eos> Slash-have you ever even tried to get your son back?<eos> You can do that?<eos> Yeah. You'd hire a litigator, he files the appropriate paperwork...<eos> But I don't even know where he is.<eos> First things first.<eos> If you take this job that Alexanya's offering you, you could prove to Child Services that you're a productive member of society again.
- No!<eos> Because when Vip said that, you had this look on your face, like,<eos> "I totally know what farm-to-table Wi-Fi is!"<eos> I was acting cool 'cause I thought you knew.<eos> I thought you knew!<eos> No, I just didn't want Vip to think I was uncool!<eos> I miss not knowing things with you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me, too. Why didn't we do this sooner?<eos> Because we've both been in hiding since the day I killed my wife and permanently disfigured you.
You guys have a talk.<eos> I'm going to a bar. That's a good idea.<eos> Yeah, go.<eos> You are a basic bitch.<eos> Come on, let's go. Come on.<eos> Out.<eos> I can kill you.<eos> Please. Let me just explain.<eos> Guys, you didn't even give me a chance to explain!<eos> Hansel, how can you expect to love 11 people when you don't even love yourself?
I have incredible news!<eos> We did a full diagnostic on your Aqua Vitae look, and a linguistics analysis on its etymology.<eos> The direct translation is "Water of Life." But many have interpreted it another way.<eos> "The Fountain of Youth".<eos> Okay, look, I only worked there for a summer.<eos> And, no, they don't give happy endings.<eos> No, Derek.<eos> The actual Fountain of Youth.<eos> Can you imagine if the Fountain of Youth indeed does exist... And if Alexanya Atoz could market such a liquid...<eos> Do you ever get that feeling when you see beautiful teenager girl with perfect skin and you want to kill her and take her skin and put it on your skin?
I have many sins that I would like to confess.<eos> One of my sins has to do with the death of Justin Bieber.<eos> No way.<eos> Hey, Derek.<eos> Hey, Sting.<eos> And hello, sweet Hansel.<eos> Hi.<eos> You two know each other?<eos> Sadly, we've never met.<eos> And yet I feel like I've known you my entire life.
When not allowed the use of them, you'd be surprised how quickly feet can be trained to do the exact same thing.<eos> Your son is doing wonderfully.<eos> From what the school tells my offshore accountant... He's incredibly smart.<eos> Your accountant?<eos> Who do you think paid for that fancy orphanage?<eos> When he was taken away from you, someone had to make sure he got his eight square meals a day. Eight?<eos> You bastard!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'd love to keep talking about this, but I seem to have developed a nasty itch.<eos> I'd ask you to scratch it for me, but no doubt you'd think I was just trying to trick you.
Check and mate, Mugatu.<eos> Your move.<eos> You really are an idiot, aren't you?<eos> Like, super, super white hot, blazingly stupid.<eos> For ten long years... I've been plotting my escape from this dreadful place. For ten long years.<eos> For ten long years.<eos> Ten years spent creating some of the most realistic and lifelike masks... evermade.<eos> One for you.<eos> And one for me.<eos> All so that today... you can become me!
Now where is that chubby little blood fountain?<eos> Hansel!<eos> Guys, Mugatz just killed Atari.<eos> For serious?<eos> Also, they're going to kill your son tonight.<eos> What? Hang on.<eos> I'm gonna try and get more intel.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why did you kidnap me?<eos> I didn't kidnap you. Don't be a silly-billy.
How long can you hold your breath? - What?<eos> - Take me from behind, Derek.<eos> And grab me like your life depends on it.<eos> Not like this. Like this!<eos> For safety.<eos> And buoyancy. Wait.<eos> What?<eos> We are swimming back to Rome.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I just talked to your dad. And we've got to get you out of here pronto.
I think that most people would have...<eos> We aren't most people.<eos> Most people don't have to make decisions like that, hours after watching their husband get murdered next to them.<eos> Oh, Lyndon. What an awful way to begin your presidency.<eos> Are you saying it was a mistake?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> How dare you?<eos> They murdered him inside the jail.<eos> These people can get to anyone.<eos> How dare you keep that from me?
They murdered him inside the jail.<eos> These people can get to anyone.<eos> How dare you keep that from me?<eos> You had no right!<eos> The children?<eos> The ceremony at the Capitol... I took them out the front door.<eos> Are you... This is all insanity!<eos> You and your brother. All these years, all your goddamn secrets!<eos> Caroline and John are all I have left, and I put them in danger because of you.<eos> I would never put you at risk.
Where the tuck's your boy'?<eos> What are you so worried about?<eos> Where the hell you have to be, anyway?<eos> Beating your pizza-faced, Liberace-son back to Boston.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> We're from Providence!<eos> He'll be here.<eos> He'll be here. He'll be here.<eos> Don't you worry about that.
I don't think he's ready to make that sacrifice.<eos> Damn straight. 'Cause there ain't no need to.<eos> Boy thinking about dying instead of boxing.<eos> That should tell you all you need to know.<eos> Motherfucker, tomorrow night, you gone.<eos> I'm gonna rain on you like a thunderstorm.<eos> Be scared.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do me a favor though, tomorrow you get yourself a Tic Tac.<eos> And if you're this close to me tomorrow,
No.I can% watch you get hurt.<eos> Yeah, well, you know I don't get hurt.<eos> Where's the tape at?<eos> It's in the VCR.<eos> Can you put that there, please?<eos> Well, will you move this thing off the table?<eos> I can't do two things at once, can I?<eos> The WBC super lightweight title.<eos> If "will" and "want to" alone was all that mattered,<eos> Pazienza could beat this guy, but "will" would only take you so far, unless you can bring some skill along with it.
This is where you trained Tyson, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That is crazy.<eos> This your family?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You guys go to Disneyland?<eos> World.<eos> In Orlando.<eos> Oh... Not yet.<eos> So, why did Tyson fire you?
Was it that DUI thing?<eos> What are you, a newspaperman?<eos> Nah, I'm just asking.<eos> Do you not want to be here?<eos> Yeah, I'm standing here, aren't I?<eos> All right, listen.<eos> Let's get real, Vinny.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You lost three in a row, last one, a title fight, you got nothing lined up 'cause you're not a draw, your own manager, on fucking HBO, said you should hang it up.<eos> The only reason you're standing in my gym is because Lou sent you here to put us both out to pasture.
Let's see.<eos> All right.<eos> There's no point.<eos> I'm gonna be way over.<eos> You just fought at 140 two weeks ago.<eos> What, did you eat a horse?<eos> I told you, I haven't been training.<eos> That's not what I usually weigh.<eos> I'm not at my fight weight right now.<eos> Hey, Vinny, I just saw you use your weight.
All right.<eos> There's no point.<eos> I'm gonna be way over.<eos> You just fought at 140 two weeks ago.<eos> What, did you eat a horse?<eos> I told you, I haven't been training.<eos> That's not what I usually weigh.<eos> I'm not at my fight weight right now.<eos> Hey, Vinny, I just saw you use your weight.<eos> It wasn't slowing you down.
Thats...<eos> No, no, that's a huge risk, which is the exact opposite of what everybody tells me I should be doing right now.<eos> It's a risk.<eos> This is The Clock.<eos> He's gonna teach you how to move and time.<eos> Jesus Christ, Kev!<eos> What's that thing made out of?<eos> Rock maple.<eos> And you don't get to hit The Clock back yet, neither.<eos> I only want you to avoid him for now, all right?
Okay, Vinny, that's good.<eos> Vinny, Vinny!<eos> Stop!<eos> What?<eos> Stop.<eos> What?<eos> What is that?<eos> What?<eos> You fight the same way.<eos> It's like if you're not completely spent, then you must not have tried hard enough.
What are you doing, champ?<eos> Stop playing around!<eos> Come on!<eos> Give me water.<eos> This wasn't the game plan, all right?<eos> Why are you going toe-to-toe with this guy, huh?<eos> Hey, Vinny, look at me.<eos> You don't move and you're gonna get hurt.<eos> You're gonna get hurt!<eos> Don't let the feelings get the better of you, okay?
I'm so happy!<eos> So what?<eos> You bulk up.<eos> No big deal.<eos> It's Duran.<eos> You'll have to fight him super middleweight.<eos> Yeah, you think I can handle him?<eos> I'd rather you fight where you naturally live.<eos> I don't want you to have to starve yourself or bulk up.<eos> But, yeah, you can handle him.
Listen, I want to talk to you one more time about your options. Before we proceed tomorrow.<eos> No need.<eos> Well...<eos> If I install the halo, there's no guarantee that it will work.<eos> The halo relies solely on your body healing on its own.<eos> Well, that's good, because I heal fast.<eos> Not that fast.<eos> It'll be six months untill you're really out of danger.<eos> Until then, one bump, one fall, any kind of movement and your spinal cord could sever.<eos> Any doctor in the world would be telling you that spinal fusion is really the preferred procedure with this severe of an injury.
We got your room all set up down here in the den.<eos> Yeah, I saw that.<eos> Brought your posters down and everything.<eos> Thanks, Jon.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Where's the parm?<eos> I got it.<eos> Look, I appreciate what you guys are doing, but I'm not a handicap.<eos> We left the wheelchair in the car.<eos> We just want to make sure that you don't hurt yourself, Vin.
Yeah, we don't have to kiss.<eos> We'll figure something else out.<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> You see, that's not nice.<eos> You can't just come over here and tease me like that.<eos> Vinny...<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> I gotta tell you... Let it go.
We're just going through some of Vinny's old tapes.<eos> Ten more.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, you're not even counting.<eos> Five.<eos> There.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Good?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, what happened to you?
- Peppers are good.<eos> - All right, darling.<eos> One day you're fighting and calling each other names, now you're giggling like a bunch of school girls.<eos> What the hell's the matter with you two?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know, Pops.<eos> Just having a good day, I guess.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, knock it off.<eos> So, you don't mind the construction site on his face?
Right under my fucking nose.<eos> You been doing this the whole time?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's been the only thing that's kept me alive these last few months.<eos> You lied to me, Vinny.<eos> I lied to you?<eos> Where were you tonight?<eos> The fuck did you just say to me?<eos> I'm sorry, Pop.<eos> I didn't want you to worry.
I didn't want you to worry.<eos> Vinny.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We gotta get the show on the road.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I told her I'm good.<eos> You have to be given a sedative for me to remove the screws.<eos> Nah.<eos> Let's just do it.<eos> Vinny. I can't do this without giving you an anesthetic.
I can't get anyone to issue a fight.<eos> Listen to me, Lou.<eos> I've been busting my ass over here, all right?<eos> Only one thing got me through that.<eos> Come on.<eos> I don't care who it's with, where it happens, how much money it's for.<eos> None of that.<eos> I made the calls, Vinny.<eos> No one will fight you.<eos> No one wants to be the one to send you back to the hospital.
No, you didn't.<eos> No, I did.<eos> No, you didn't do it.<eos> I did!<eos> All right?<eos> And I know it's a little late to be making a change, but...<eos> What change?<eos> I can't be in your corner for this one.<eos> Or any of them.<eos> I can't be part of you getting hurt no more.
Use the ring!<eos> Use the ring, damn it!<eos> What's he doing?<eos> I can't watch this.<eos> Come on!<eos> Jab!<eos> Roberto Duran taking this fight over.<eos> Watch out for the hook!<eos> Watch out for the hook!<eos> Every single time, he's looking for that left hook, I told you.

What was the biggest lie you were told?<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> Why not?<eos> No, that's the biggest lie I was ever told.<eos> "It's not that simple."<eos> And it's a lie they tell you over and over again.<eos> What's not simple?<eos> Any of it.<eos> All Of it.<eos> It's how they get you to give up.
"It's not that simple."<eos> And it's a lie they tell you over and over again.<eos> What's not simple?<eos> Any of it.<eos> All Of it.<eos> It's how they get you to give up.<eos> They say, "It's not that simple, Vinny."<eos> So, what's the truth?<eos> That it is.<eos> That if you just do the thing that they tell you, you can't, then it's done.
His old man just died and I hear that the son is much more of a moderate.<eos> Hey, fellas... howdy doody. Say...<eos> I'm looking for Dikembe Umbutu.<eos> I see you found their armory.<eos> The one and only, David Levinson.<eos> Catherine, wow!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You don't think you're the only expert he called, do you?<eos> I'm so surprised to see you, a little bit.<eos> I'm a little surprised that you remember my name.
Today is the Fourth of July.<eos> Looks like someone picked up the phone and answered.<eos> I'm going crazy up here.<eos> I can't take it anymore.<eos> Tell me how much you miss me.<eos> Actually, the Chief of Staff just got a really handsome intern.<eos> Not quite as tall as you, but has great dimples... and plays the cello.<eos> You know how much I miss you.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna steal a tug and come back and see you right now.
I've got good news.<eos> - That pilot that China sent... is my future wife and I mean it.<eos> I think my heart exploded.<eos> It's like our souls were communing.<eos> He just walked in, didn't he?<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're not gonna finish this?<eos> You mind moving?<eos> We both know what happens when you get in my way.
Hey, what would happen... if we were able to kill her?<eos> No one has ever killed a Harvester queen.<eos> That's encouraging.<eos> But as a hive... her fighters will fall, and her ship will leave your planet.<eos> Recalled by other Harvester queens.<eos> But it's too late now.<eos> You must terminate me... or she will get the coordinates to the refugee planet.<eos> And that will be the end.<eos> Wait, wait a second.<eos> If we're so sure that she's coming here to get you... maybe we can bait her... like she baited us.
Sorry!<eos> Sorry, everyone!<eos> That was my bad!<eos> I'm gonna see if it's clear.<eos> Jake!<eos> Hell of a time to scare a guy!<eos> Sorry.<eos> - It's good to see you!<eos> - It's good to see you, too.<eos> - I didn't think you made it.
We're not leaving anyone else behind!<eos> No one else dies today!<eos> You with me?<eos> I'm with you.<eos> It's getting dicey up here!<eos> Rain, just get out of here!<eos> Respectfully, sir, no way in hell!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Hey, man...<eos> I just want you to know... if we don't make it out of here... I'm really sorry for almost killing you in training.
I'm gonna get you to sick bay.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm not going to make it.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Wait.<eos> You can't go.<eos> Who's gonna water the orchids?<eos> Who's gonna make sure you put your pants on in the morning?<eos> Right.<eos> I've got something I gotta tell you.
Do you think my legs are too white to wear a skirt?<eos> No.<eos> You think I'm fat, don't you?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, not at all.<eos> Once you have a baby, your body isn't as tight as it used to be.<eos> Not everybody can stay as tiny and skinny as you.<eos> Oh, I never had a kid, so...<eos> Well, fucking don't, okay?<eos> Because, let me tell you, once you do, that is it!
Great!<eos> Liar!<eos> Could you... zip me up?<eos> Sweetie, I need makeup on my face.<eos> Could you do it?<eos> I need to just rest.<eos> Yeah, I don't really know how to do that kind of stuff.<eos> Oh, for fuck's sake!<eos> There, there's your tip.<eos> Has anyone ever tipped you a hundred bucks before?
Thank you.<eos> - You can probably go, yeah?<eos> - Yes ma'am. Hey, baby.<eos> He didn't want me.<eos> He didn't want me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Dude, come on.<eos> I don't know what to tell you, kid.
No! These are my things.<eos> You have no right to touch them.<eos> I just thought it would be fun, and...<eos> Who does that?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Pfft! A lot?<eos> This is my home, it's not a joke.<eos> Okay.<eos> God, this is a 1920s Soumak carpet.<eos> You can't just do anything you want.
Don't do that!<eos> I took you in.<eos> I will not be taken advantage of.<eos> It's not personal, Margo.<eos> Of course it's personal!<eos> Get your filthy fingers off of that.<eos> I will not let some crazy kid come in and destroy my life for her own amusement.<eos> Jesus!<eos> No wonder Nico left.<eos> I need you to go.
Get your filthy fingers off of that.<eos> I will not let some crazy kid come in and destroy my life for her own amusement.<eos> Jesus!<eos> No wonder Nico left.<eos> I need you to go.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Of course I'm serious.<eos> Get out!<eos> Go live in your van.<eos> You can paint any goddamn thing you want.
If it was so much fun, why did he leave?<eos> He just was... he said he was tired.<eos> So you're in love, you're living in a van with a baby, and suddenly my son just decides to ditch his kid, and, what? Walk back to New York?<eos> - He's probably hitchhiking.<eos> - Stephen, what are you doing?<eos> He's being pretty rude.<eos> No, I'm not being rude.<eos> I'm trying to get it straight. I'm trying to find out what the fuck happened to our son.<eos> Now this is the last person who saw him alive.<eos> Doesn't that concern you?
Why? Why?<eos> Because God forbid I make it hard for you, as if it isn't hard enough being a faggot!<eos> You let me build this family on a lie, you let me make it my life, and you knew the whole time!<eos> That's what kills me!<eos> You knew!<eos> Goddammit, you knew the whole time too!<eos> You knew!<eos> If we're really being honest here.<eos> I loved you and I loved our family.<eos> And how dare you call someone else a liar?

Hi, Mom.<eos> Hi!<eos> I'm not gonna ask what you were doing here.<eos> I don't care anymore.<eos> Nothing could be worse than what you've done to our daughter.<eos> You are worthless, Carolyn.<eos> Who was she?<eos> - She worked here.<eos> - No, she didn't.<eos> But you didn't fucking check, did you?
Here.<eos> I'll get you a real desk.<eos> Marry you.<eos> What?<eos> I'm already married.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> That was private.<eos> It was a private conversation.<eos> You had to buy the ring yourself in Woolworths.<eos> When times got hard, he tried to send you back to Wales, and he's disappointed in you?
Thank you.<eos> Sometimes one simply has to be firm.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> You left your jacket in the cabin.<eos> It smelt of you for the longest time.<eos> And then one day, I went in there and all I could smell was Uncle Frank's pipe.<eos> Only I'd understand, you know, if things have changed.<eos> And that bullet might have had my name on it.<eos> Oh, Johnnie.<eos> I wouldn't blame you.
I never come to the studio.<eos> Mrs. Cole!<eos> The boss wants to try a take without Uncle Frank's lines 'cause he says we are losing visual tension.<eos> Mr. Hilliard is talking about the integrity of the story, saying he will play the scene as you wrote it or not at all.<eos> - Nobody's had any sleep and you're just...<eos> - It's all right.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> No.<eos> Let me deal with it.<eos> Once Hilliard gets his hands on you, he won't let you go for hours, and I was rather hoping to do that myself.
Branch!<eos> Branch!<eos> Branch!<eos> Branch, are you in there?<eos> I'm not going to your party.<eos> The party's over.<eos> We just got attacked by a Bergen.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Branch!<eos> I have to tell you something.
And you won't last a day in here.<eos> Chug, chug, chug!<eos> Solid burn, returned.<eos> Sorry, Branch!<eos> Poppy, wait.<eos> Please be careful.<eos> Don't worry, Dad.<eos> I can do this.<eos> I love you, Poppy.<eos> I love you too, Dad.
I know it!<eos> You don't know anything, Poppy.<eos> And I can't wait to see the look on your face... When you realize the world isn't all cupcakes and rainbows.<eos> 'Cause it isn't.<eos> Bad things happen... And there's nothing you can do about it.<eos> Hey, I know it's not all cupcakes and rainbows.<eos> But I'd rather go through life thinking that it mostly is... Instead of being like you.<eos> You don't sing, you don't dance.<eos> So grey all the time!<eos> What happened to you?
- I look like a child in this one.<eos> - Oh, sire!<eos> I need something elegant, sophisticated.<eos> You know, a man's bib.<eos> Oh, he's so beautiful.<eos> And so are you.<eos> - He'll know that I'm just a scullery maid.<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> I got to get out of here.<eos> I'll be right here for you, Bridget.
No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For showing me how to be happy.<eos> Really?<eos> You're finally happy?<eos> Now?<eos> I think so.<eos> Happiness is inside of all of us, right?<eos> Sometimes, you just need someone to help you find it.
Get out of here!<eos> No! Bridget, if you go in there without us, you know what they'll do.<eos> I know.<eos> But, Bridget...<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay, Poppy.<eos> You showed me what it feels like to be happy.<eos> I never would have known if it wasn't for you.<eos> And I love you for that.<eos> I love you too, Bridget.
My way!<eos> No!<eos> With me in charge... I'll serve you Troll every day of the year.<eos> With me as queen... All of life will be a never-ending feast of happiness!<eos> Come on, eat!<eos> Eat!<eos> No!<eos> Happiness isn't something you put inside.<eos> It's already there.<eos> Sometimes you just need someone to help you find it.
Just raw-dog it.<eos> But, full disclosure, I'm pretty fucking nervous about this.<eos> I don't know how well I'll perform once it happens.<eos> I've obviously never been in a bun before, so...<eos> Hey, I'm not gonna be any better.<eos> I've never opened up.<eos> I mean, look how tight I am.<eos> Oh, sweet fucking fuck.<eos> Look, okay, I know it's against the rules, but I can't wait anymore.<eos> I need to just feel you.
- Just the tips? - Just the tips?<eos> - I can't believe we're doing this.<eos> - I know. We're so naughty.<eos> It's fine, right?<eos> I mean, nothing bad's ever happened from just the tips.<eos> No. No, no, no. No, no, no.<eos> Oh, yeah, go in.<eos> Put it in there.<eos> - Big tip.<eos> - Oh, you wouldn't dare.
Yo!<eos> Oh, fuck, yeah, dude.<eos> Somebody call a doctor because, honestly, this beat is sick.<eos> - Actually, I feel great.<eos> Real healthy.<eos> - Not you, the beat.<eos> Oh, shit, Chips!<eos> C-H-I-P-S, Chips, Chips, Chips.<eos> I've known you forever. I would never disrespect you with a lie.<eos> I will tell you very much that you look fucking disgusting, bro.
Yeah, your nozzle's bent.<eos> Sorry. You should be happy you're alive.<eos> Yeah, Banana's whole face peeled off.<eos> Peanut Butter's wife is dead.<eos> Look at him.<eos> Jelly! I'm gonna fix you. I'm gonna fix this.<eos> You think I give a fuck about PB or J?<eos> Fuck this.<eos> I'm gonna kick your ass.<eos> How you like them apples?
I'm gonna kick your ass.<eos> How you like them apples?<eos> - Who, us?<eos> - No, not you.<eos> Come at me, bros.<eos> Come at you?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Fine.<eos> You won't come at me?<eos> Well, then, guess who's coming at you.
And... then we'll get a lay of the land... and we'll figure out where we're going. Come on.<eos> As long as the bagel stays away from me, I accept.<eos> Oh, believe me, asshole, I'll keep my distance.<eos> No disrespect, but you look fucking gross, bro.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Fucking bent-ass, busted-ass nozz.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> You're leaking all your juice out.<eos> Can I ask you a question, me?<eos> Why would a god let you up in her smooth, perfect sliz... when you can't even squirt?
Holy shit.<eos> Look at this place.<eos> It's fucking crazy!<eos> Are you seeing this?<eos> They're all out of their packages.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> This is a place of unparalleled sin!<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.<eos> Didn't see you there. Sorry.
Sativa.<eos> It's good shit.<eos> Clean high.<eos> Oh, no, thanks.<eos> Trust me.<eos> What you're about to hear, you'll want some.<eos> Fifty-five minutes.<eos> I know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Looks like you got ditched, bun.
I know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Looks like you got ditched, bun.<eos> He wouldn't ditch me, dumbass.<eos> I mean... we touched T-I-Ps.<eos> We touched tips<eos> Just the tips Oh, we touched our tips<eos> Sorry, I don't know why I'm singing.<eos> Sometimes I get nervous And I'll sing!<eos> Maybe that's why he ditched you.
Yeah, I am. Why?<eos> And you've been traveling with a sausage?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I have!<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> I have!<eos> He's looking for you in my aisle.<eos> He's right this way.<eos> I can take you to him, chica.<eos> I take you to him real good.
He's looking for you in my aisle.<eos> He's right this way.<eos> I can take you to him, chica.<eos> I take you to him real good.<eos> All right, vámonos.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I am to be trusted.<eos> Yeah. This has a nice south-of-the-border vibe.<eos> Okay, you go over there and you sit at the bar right there, okay?<eos> You can't move a muscle, okay?
What are you saying, Carl?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> No! No!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Carl!<eos> Carl!<eos> Barry!<eos> Carl!<eos> Dear sweet Carl.<eos> What have they done to you, Carl?
Oh, good.<eos> That actually makes me feel a little better.<eos> - We must never give in to them.<eos> - That's the opposite... - ...of what I thought you'd say.<eos> - Yes. The gods are always watching, even when we cannot see them.<eos> You think it's too late for me?<eos> Do not worry, bun. I will get you home.<eos> Can I ask why you're helping me?<eos> When I saw you, I felt inside myself a tingling-lingling sensation.<eos> I am sure it was the gods telling me to help you.
- Frank!<eos> - You feel so good.<eos> I was afraid you left me because I wasn't fresh.<eos> I was attacked by a douche. He's trying to kill us!<eos> Douche?<eos> Oh, my God, Brenda!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did he come at you?<eos> Yes, I'm fine, but it was really scary.<eos> Where have you been?
- You're just trying to hurt me!<eos> - All over my backside, neck and face.<eos> - I'm not gonna listen!<eos> Brenda! Brenda, okay, look.<eos> Let's just stop this, okay?<eos> Okay? You're my bun.<eos> Oh, don't "You're my bun.<eos> Hey, trust me!<eos> Hey, guys, come over here, follow me!"<eos> You're basically saying you don't care about me.
Brenda!<eos> Sammy!<eos> Lavash!<eos> Taco Lady.<eos> I didn't get your name yet.<eos> Brenda!<eos> And I would do anything for love<eos> I'd run right into hell and back<eos> I would do anything for love<eos> I'll never lie to you and that's a fact
I've eaten so many of your family members!<eos> I've committed pizza genocide!<eos> - Mr. Sausage, when will it end?<eos> - "When will it end"?<eos> When he stops drinking us. - Yeah!<eos> - Yeah! And stops eating us!<eos> - Same here!<eos> - Fuck yeah!<eos> And when he stops using us!<eos> What did he do to you?
- Wait a minute. You know Hummus?<eos> - Know him?<eos> I'm gonna go so far as to say I consider Hummus one of my dearest friends.<eos> Really?<eos> I too know Hummus!<eos> And I too consider him a dear friend.<eos> We both like Hummus.<eos> Well, any friend of Hummus is a...<eos> Get the fuck away from me.<eos> What troubles you, sweet Brenda?
Well, jeez, it's been a sincere sensation.<eos> Goodbye, Brenda Bunson.<eos> Goodbye, Teresa Del Taco.<eos> So long, Bagel.<eos> Traveling with you was... - ...tolerable.<eos> - Oh, you're so sweet.<eos> Later, you flappy fuck.<eos> Well, Teresa, you've done as much as you promised.<eos> You got me back to my aisle safely.<eos> I really can't thank you enough.
What the fuck is that?<eos> Fuck.<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I gotta show them.<eos> They need to know how wrong they all are before it's too late!<eos> Sammy, bubula, where have you been?
Fuck.<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I gotta show them.<eos> They need to know how wrong they all are before it's too late!<eos> Sammy, bubula, where have you been?<eos> Oh, I'm surprised that savage Lavash didn't stone you to death.
No way.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I gotta show them.<eos> They need to know how wrong they all are before it's too late!<eos> Sammy, bubula, where have you been?<eos> Oh, I'm surprised that savage Lavash didn't stone you to death.<eos> You had to travel with a bagel?<eos> How much did his dirty hands steal from you?
You intolerant piece of shit.<eos> No, it's starting.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Come on. Sing.<eos> - Do it.<eos> - No! Don't do it, Corn.<eos> - Come on, Larry.<eos> You can do it.<eos> - Start.<eos> Don't you dare fucking do it, Corn.
No, it's starting.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Come on. Sing.<eos> - Do it.<eos> - No! Don't do it, Corn.<eos> - Come on, Larry.<eos> You can do it.<eos> - Start.<eos> Don't you dare fucking do it, Corn.<eos> Don't you fucking do it.
Oh, my God!<eos> The sausage, he was right!<eos> They're evil!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Nobody's gonna help us.<eos> Then this is it.<eos> At least we go out together.<eos> - What the...?<eos> - You fuck with them...<eos> You fuck with us, bitch.
Oh, no.<eos> Brenda!<eos> Frank!<eos> Barry!<eos> Oh, so now you're gonna come at me, bro?<eos> Oh, I'm coming at you.<eos> Okay, we got him, easy now.<eos> Easy now.<eos> It's hard when your head's up my ass and you're yanking on the scrot.<eos> Look, sausage, I relish the fact... that you mustard the strength to ketchup to me.
I don't like the movies.<eos> I read books.<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> Subtract us into nakedness and night again... and you shall see begin in Crete 4, 000 years ago... the love that ended yesterday in Texas.<eos> Hello, Daddy.<eos> How do I look?<eos> - Just beautiful.<eos> - It's the prom next week.<eos> Already?<eos> You're so old and not married yet.
- Eleven.<eos> - Ten.<eos> Swine.<eos> He had listened attentively to a sermon in chapel... by a sophomore with false whiskers.<eos> He had prepared studiously for an examination... on the contents of the college catalog.<eos> Ten.<eos> That's a very long paragraph.<eos> It started four pages ago.<eos> Poor Maxwell.<eos> You're too young to be in love.
I mean, I search for the need of a father of our spirit.<eos> It's about every single thing that makes this country great.<eos> It's mammoth!<eos> Max says... the only ideas worth writing about are the big ideas.<eos> Big ideas, fewer words.<eos> You see, I'm lost without him.<eos> Aren't we all?<eos> You know I'm a writer, too?<eos> That so?<eos> Max didn't tell you?
One word, no flourishes.<eos> Grotesque.<eos> The screaming is constant and so... desolate.<eos> They don't have enough toilets.<eos> I can't let Zelda stay in such a place.<eos> I know.<eos> But private asylums are expensive.<eos> I know Gatsby didn't make any money.<eos> But I'm up against it, Max.<eos> Scribner's can't give you any more advances.
Scribner's can't give you any more advances.<eos> The Post won't even take any more of my stories.<eos> I guess I could go back to Hollywood and give that another try.<eos> I hope you don't do that.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You're a novelist.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I should have died when I was 24.<eos> Right after This Side of Paradise.<eos> Did you get that book I sent you?
Which?<eos> General Grant's memoirs.<eos> Do you know how he came to write them?<eos> This is interesting.<eos> He was dying of throat cancer... and he wanted to leave something behind for his family... so he started writing his autobiography.<eos> He worked every day for hours and hours.<eos> He was in great pain, anguish... but he just kept on writing.<eos> And in the end, he produced the most astounding book.<eos> So very beautiful.<eos> Just a little velvet to see you through.
Well done.<eos> Now, go home and get some sleep.<eos> - I need you...<eos> - Let me read it.<eos> Read it kindly.<eos> Please?<eos> If we work every day in the evening, when we won't be disturbed... we can do it.<eos> - How long?<eos> - Nine months.<eos> If you work hard and if you resist... the temptation to add much more.
"It was a sure silence... "but his life was shattered."<eos> End of chapter.<eos> You don't like it?<eos> You know I do.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> So he sees a girl... and he falls in love for the first time, yes?<eos> Does his mind go to deep-sea marine life?<eos> At that moment, yes.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> I think you fell in love with the images, not the girl.
You don't have the first idea what it is to be alive!<eos> You don't know what it is to wake up... and grab hold of life every day and fight with it.<eos> You're just so goddamn scared to live.<eos> There are other ways to live!<eos> There's loving your children and seeing them grow up right.<eos> There's providing for your family.<eos> There's doing work that's important and giving to other people.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> - No, I've taken your abuse... 'cause I told myself you were worth it... that the work was worth it.<eos> But God help anyone who loves you, Tom.
I was a damn brute.<eos> I wouldn't blame you if you slammed the door in my face.<eos> You don't know how sorry I am... for talking to you and Zelda like that.<eos> Please, say you forgive me.<eos> Believe it or not, I've been drunk myself once or twice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm still a bit of a washout as a screenwriter.<eos> I just can't make the grade as a hack.<eos> Even that requires a certain practiced excellence.<eos> I'm mighty glad to see you, Scott.
I'll get the doctor.<eos> Pencil.<eos> Afternoon, Mr. Perkins.<eos> Afternoon, James.<eos> Dear Max...<eos> I've got a hunch. And I wanted to write these words to you.<eos> I've made a long voyage and been to a strange country... and I've seen the dark man very close.<eos> And I don't think I was too much afraid of him.<eos> But I want most desperately to live.<eos> I want to see you again. For there is such impossible anguish and regret... for all I can never say to you... for all the work I have to do.
People put models on this crazy pedestal, but<eos> I think that's why, you know, Becca fell for me, because I just treat her like a normal person.<eos> Good for you, man. Hey, so, um, are you gonna be inviting your fake girlfriend to the holiday party later?<eos> I mean, I just want to make sure you have time to inflate her.<eos> Okay, Becca's real.<eos> And we're not gonna mix business with pleasure.<eos> Sounds like he didn't invite her, dude.<eos> Oh, my God, did you not...<eos> Oh, no!<eos> I mean, I hope she's not imaginary pissed. You won't get any more imaginary blow jobs. Right?
Oh, shitster.<eos> It's my sister.<eos> There she is!<eos> My sister from another mister!<eos> I'm kidding, our mother didn't start having affairs until the mid-90s.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, we were just going over your fourth quarter earnings.<eos> And I wondered if I was missing something.<eos> Probably.<eos> Clay, why don't you have a seat?
Maybe you shouldn't have promised them bonuses.<eos> No, first rule of business: Shoot for the moon and you'll land on the sun.<eos> I'd love to know where you read that.<eos> And let's just focus on closing Walter.<eos> You know, Carol burned this place to the ground.<eos> We are planting the seeds of a new dawn.<eos> Smitty? Clay Vanstone.<eos> No, I'm not dead.<eos> That was just a rumour, although well-founded.<eos> How much alcohol can I legally buy from you?
Match, match, match. Match! Come on.<eos> Okay. Um, what are we gonna do with these after the party?<eos> Raffle.<eos> For a failing branch, we're surprisingly productive.<eos> Yeah, I just wish Carol could see this.<eos> Uh, no, Clay, that would be very bad.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> All right, go put on your party suits.<eos> - Tonight's gonna be a great night.<eos> Clay, I told you,
Thank you. You look great.<eos> Oh. - Hey, Josh.<eos> - Hey, Dean.<eos> You... You thought you'd bring the kid, huh?<eos> Yeah. We couldn't get anyone to watch him. But don't worry, he has an iPad.<eos> We could axe murder each other and he wouldn't even notice.<eos> He'll just sit there with that dumb look on his face.<eos> Yeah, that's the one.<eos> Okay. Well, can you stick him in my office for me?<eos> - If you're cool with that.
- Uh-uh, neither.<eos> And, you know, we can skip this, too.<eos> - Good spirit, though. Yep.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Could I have a beer, please?<eos> Pretty great, huh, Jeremy?<eos> Yeah, it's so weird, I feel like I'm still at the office.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh. Thank you.<eos> God, I know I haven't asked You for much in this life.
You doing okay?<eos> You all right?<eos> - That really did hurt, yeah...<eos> - Are you sure? But you know what, I had this for padding.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> What the fuck is that? Tell me that's not for something illegal.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Don't worry, this is all mine. I rented one of those Money Tornados.<eos> So for the bonuses later, I'm gonna make it rain like a hurricane.<eos> Are you sure you're not getting carried away?
I think you mean Becca, right?<eos> Uh...<eos> I'm gonna be honest, I've never done this before.<eos> Although my mum and I have watched Pretty Woman, like, a million times.<eos> Oh, I love that movie!<eos> It's why I'm doing this.<eos> - Oh, wow.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It feels kind of dirty.<eos> You feel dirty?
Excuse me. Excuse me!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Raise your hands if you're keeping your jobs!<eos> Raise your hands if you're gonna get a bonus!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Clay?<eos> Clay!<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Hey, sis.<eos> Carol, before you get mad, listen to what I did.
- Wait, what? - Did you say fired?<eos> Oh, yeah. Oh, he got fired at the close of business today.<eos> He told me, like, two hours ago.<eos> They shipped his whole branch overseas.<eos> What? I confirmed it with my H.R. Facebook group.<eos> And they know everything.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Just to clarify, because I'm detail-oriented.<eos> So you didn't get a contract with Walter Davis because he didn't have a contract to give.<eos> Carol, before you get mad, here's the thing...
Excuse me.<eos> Just to clarify, because I'm detail-oriented.<eos> So you didn't get a contract with Walter Davis because he didn't have a contract to give.<eos> Carol, before you get mad, here's the thing...<eos> He wanted to work with us. - So...<eos> - Clay. Clay!<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> You're not?<eos> I mean, I was mad when Dad gave you this branch just as a reward for taking six years to graduate with a degree in...
I fucked up, okay, so blame me.<eos> But these are good people.<eos> You can't close this branch.<eos> This is Dad's branch.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> He shouldn't have given it to you to fuck up.<eos> Oh, and, uh, good luck trying to be Mr Fun Guy when you have to fire all these people. Whoo!<eos> I'll see you in New York.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Did your little friend not tell you?
- Against yourself. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Andrew, in the copy room, he was changing the toner.<eos> And I pretended to drop something on the ground so that I could bend over and graze his butt with my nose.<eos> And I did.<eos> - That doesn't seem that bad.<eos> - And then I said,<eos> "If you don't fuck me, buster, I will ruin you."<eos> Hmm. That's harassment.<eos> That's why he quit.<eos> You seem like you feel better.
Do we have to worry about them?<eos> Cops look after cops.<eos> Same as you Special Ops do.<eos> It's fine.<eos> All right.<eos> All right?<eos> Gabe's been clean for six months.<eos> He's trying.<eos> He was a good cop.<eos> Look, I know you give a fuck.
Uncle Jeff. Can you do that?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You know what kind of spots I've been in?<eos> A lot hairier than this... So don't worry about me.<eos> No. lam worried about you.<eos> You don't realize...<eos> Any one of these little fucking snake-eyed motherfuckers, you know, could be strapped right now.<eos> I owe it to your mother.<eos> I owe it to her.<eos> Look, it... I can't look after you...
All right. Let's get this off you, man.<eos> Go on, sit down.<eos> There you go.<eos> There it is.<eos> Just sit there for a second while I go speak to your mother.<eos> You fucking late.<eos> You're lucky you get to see him at all.<eos> I need to see your sister.<eos> Why the fuck ain't she answering my calls?<eos> Michael, I had to convince my sister to spare you, okay?
We own the secrets of kings, me and him.<eos> This is why we have survived so long.<eos> Where's Felix?<eos> Felix and Elena won't be joining us tonight.<eos> Here.<eos> Hear it for yourself.<eos> Elena?<eos> Michael.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Irina didn't tell you?
I need a favor.<eos> Anything-.<eos> I need a hard copy on Leah Green's murder.<eos> I need the name of the lead cop on the scene when they found the body.<eos> Sure, it has to be our little secret though.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Look at you, you little worthless motherfucker.<eos> Figured I'd find you here.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> What's up? I was just wondering if you wouldn't mind coming back to the station with me.
Not an arrest.<eos> He'll only be charged with bribery and embezzlement.<eos> Spain will have to negotiate your surrender, you'll do less time.<eos> How long?<eos> Five years, tops.<eos> We're good.<eos> All right.<eos> It's okay, Paco.<eos> It's me.<eos> Don't hold me to this, but I'm glad to see you.
I'm only warning you.<eos> Have a good trip.<eos> Pier Marie Laperrouze.<eos> Of course I know him.<eos> I sold him and his associate weapons a couple years ago.<eos> A guy named Rene.<eos> He's a bounty hunter.<eos> People are nervous in your country.<eos> This is serious, Paco.<eos> What kind of trouble are you in now?
Well, now you can see.<eos> I guess I came too soon.<eos> Next time I'll come later.<eos> This is my second warning, Paco.<eos> You can come anytime.<eos> You're in trouble, Paco.<eos> I have Roldan's documents.<eos> You can't touch me.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I don't think you'll dare to find out.
Next time I'll come later.<eos> This is my second warning, Paco.<eos> You can come anytime.<eos> You're in trouble, Paco.<eos> I have Roldan's documents.<eos> You can't touch me.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I don't think you'll dare to find out.<eos> You know there's nothing in those documents.<eos> They won't protect you from the law.
Hey.<eos> Thirty-one flavors and I got them all!<eos> I got somebody very, very important that I want you to meet.<eos> The best trainer in the history of boxing.<eos> Ray Arcel.<eos> He has trained more world champs than anyone else in boxing history.<eos> Relax.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I told you I would bring you to the Madison Square Garden.
He's just a kid!<eos> - Wassup, kid?<eos> - Wassup.<eos> - All good?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Clearly, all is great.<eos> I can get you out.<eos> But let me be clear...<eos> If you are caught fighting or stealing...<eos> I'll bring you back myself and leave you here.
Yeah, well.<eos> I might as well be dead already anyway.<eos> Oh, what a lovely thing to say to your wife.<eos> I mean... we are what we do.<eos> And if you just make money, you become money.<eos> This thing that everybody wants that everybody craves, it's just symbolic.<eos> It has no real value.<eos> I have to do something that I really care about.<eos> I'm not an idiot.<eos> I know you're miserable.
You're gonna have to learn to breathe.<eos> And you're gonna learn to pace yourself.<eos> There's technique and there's strategy.<eos> Technique is your every move, your every punch covers all your short-term decisions.<eos> Strategy is your plan for the whole fight.<eos> It's your long term.<eos> It defines how you apply the technique to achieve your major goal.<eos> It's okay if your technique fails for a beat as long as you're following the strategy.<eos> Buchanan knows you're gonna try to knock him out in the first round.<eos> And then he'll wait for you to get tired and try and catch you, and that's his strategy.
What school did you go to?<eos> I went to the Plomo Quiñones school.<eos> Now I'm in the Ray Arcel.<eos> Ray Arcel?<eos> American school?<eos> Yes, American school.<eos> You didn't go to school, did you?<eos> But you can read, right?<eos> This is like a job interview.<eos> I thought I was walking you home.
Durán, Durán, Durán...<eos> Hey, Ray!<eos> Cheers.<eos> - I got a question for you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why you always brushed my hair when we were in the corners?<eos> Fighter punches you, feels proud.<eos> Bell sounds, next round starts, you come out looking all fresh, like you just came out of the shower.<eos> Drives him nuts.<eos> He thinks he can't hurt you.
No go.<eos> I will beat him.<eos> With my strategy.<eos> If you leave, I'm packing my bags.<eos> I'm going.<eos> - Leave.<eos> - You leave, I'll leave.<eos> - Be my guest. - Ah...<eos> Goddamn schmendrick.<eos> Goddamn you, fucking schmendrick.
I'm sorry, okay?<eos> Sorry's not good enough.<eos> How could you do that?<eos> Insult a woman like that?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Well, my country felt insulted by yours.<eos> And not only women.<eos> Children.<eos> What does your country have to do with the way you talked to that woman?<eos> The way you behaved?
If Ray finds out you are dead.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I don't want to disappoint tomorrow.<eos> Dad!<eos> Hey!<eos> My babies!<eos> Good morning!<eos> Kisses for Daddy.<eos> Can't wait to see you kill that coward!
Go!<eos> Beat him!<eos> Now, Sugar Ray is fighting an inspired fight.<eos> You gotta try to knock him out, Cholo.<eos> You never know with these darn judges.<eos> They can take the fight away from us.<eos> This has been your best fight.<eos> But you're still human.<eos> You could still lose.<eos> I want you to focus.
Leonard.<eos> You are my friend now.<eos> All along, he's been doing this on purpose.<eos> He hurt you to drive me crazy.<eos> To get me to be in his macho tough guy war.<eos> Ray, you're obsessed.<eos> I'm telling you, it's a strategy.<eos> It's been a strategy...<eos> I'm gonna fuck your husband in the ring and when I'm done with him, I'm gonna go and fuck you all night, baby.<eos> From the moment he insulted you, he knew that he could get in my head and cause me to stand toe-to-toe with him.
Hold it right there!<eos> I'm hungry, man.<eos> Catch him!<eos> A bit salty... but thank you.<eos> Revolting!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> While you were at your party...<eos> What?<eos> Chaflan was killed.<eos> Who told you?
It's your house.<eos> Nobody else's.<eos> It's your house.<eos> - You understand that, Cholo?<eos> - I don't feel good.<eos> You're letting this guy run all over you.<eos> He's running in circles around you.<eos> - You know that he does, that's his defense.<eos> - I don't feel good.<eos> You don't feel good?
Listen. I-I can't.<eos> I-I'm done with it.<eos> And it has nothing to do with you.<eos> We're talking about me now.<eos> I'm old. I'm tired.<eos> You don't need me.<eos> You never really did.<eos> You're a naturally great fighter.<eos> You have great fighter's instincts.<eos> I was just there to support you.
You're a naturally great fighter.<eos> You have great fighter's instincts.<eos> I was just there to support you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I need you in my corner, Ray.<eos> Not anymore, you don't.<eos> You're an adult now.<eos> You have children of your own.<eos> You don't need a father.<eos> You need somebody to bring the street back into you.
You have children of your own.<eos> You don't need a father.<eos> You need somebody to bring the street back into you.<eos> - Talk to Plomo.<eos> - Plomo?<eos> He knows you better than anybody.<eos> He's been with you from the beginning.<eos> I'll help you get a fight.<eos> I'll be watching you all the time.<eos> But get Plomo to bring you back.
Well, hang on a second.<eos> Hang on!<eos> I only had one drink.<eos> And that was just to keep warm out there.<eos> I'm freezing my nuts off.<eos> And if we're being honest here, you, you guys should be supplying us with some kind of electric underwear or some shit.<eos> Oh, well, if we're being honest, I don't like being lied to.<eos> - Please.<eos> I need this.<eos> - Why do you care so much?
Because the world's a fucking shit hole.<eos> But when I put this suit on, I feel like...<eos> Well, I feel like General MacArthur must have felt when he put his uniform on and went and killed all them Filipinos.<eos> Look, I, I put up with a lot of shit from kids...<eos> For the kids. I won't piss on the suit.<eos> I really won't.<eos> I mean, give a broke-dick motherfucker a chance, will you?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll give you a second chance.<eos> If you give me a chance to help you.
Sweetheart, I'm not sure you could handle my A game.<eos> You get one hit of me and you'll be addicted.<eos> - I like your confidence.<eos> - I'd light you up like the Fourth of July.<eos> Look, Ronald, I'm just gonna cut to the chase here.<eos> I am strictly first-class.<eos> I'm talking Chrysler 300, factory-direct, fully loaded.<eos> And after that...<eos> lobster.<eos> Now if you think you can handle that, then maybe, just maybe, I'll pencil you in.
Have a seat.<eos> What can Santy Claus get you?<eos> A penguin.<eos> It doesn't have to be alive.<eos> - What's up, champ?<eos> - I want a hand grenade.<eos> Yeah, well, I want a hand release, but you don't see me holding my breath, do you?<eos> - What's a hand release?<eos> - It's kind of a compromise.<eos> Anyway, Santy ain't no arms dealer, so I can't help you out.
- Don't do that.<eos> - Oh, that's for me.<eos> Shut up.<eos> - Pew-pew. - Don't touch me with the fucking thing.<eos> No, seriously.<eos> I did get you a gift.<eos> - I want you to have this.<eos> - What the fuck's that for?<eos> The midget.<eos> He tried to kill you once.
U m, I ain't exactly what you call the romantic type, you know.<eos> I don't go in for all the sappy shit.<eos> But, um, I gotta tell you, you got gigantic titties.<eos> - And that's no shit.<eos> - Um... thanks?<eos> No sweat.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - This better be an emergency.<eos> - Willie, where are you?<eos> I'm in Chicago, but I can't find you anywhere.
Any bed that's not taken.<eos> Alrighty, here we go.<eos> Now listen, don't be sitting on any toilet seats.<eos> If you gotta take a shit just stand over it, couple of feet away, take aim and blow it in there.<eos> 'Cause I'm pretty sure crabs can jump.<eos> All right?<eos> Don't let anybody muscle up on you in the showers either, because they'll try.<eos> And if a fight breaks out, go straight for the nuts or gouge an eye out.<eos> I don't think I like it here, Willie.<eos> Then you should go home, like I told you to start with.
You guys are really good at singing.<eos> I like to sing in the bathtub.<eos> I'm a soprano.<eos> My friend Ronnie says I sound like Mariah Carey.<eos> - Hello.<eos> What's your name?<eos> - I'm Thurman.<eos> Thurman Merman.<eos> For real?<eos> Would you like to join us, Thurman?
Old man wants to see you.<eos> Good afternoon MaryAnne.<eos> Hey, Pop! I heard you want to see me.<eos> Yeah, Kenny.<eos> You get you're ass in here, would you?<eos> Would you run through this Pershing County strategy again for me?<eos> Right, umm.<eos> It's about this southern part of this Newmont property, right here.<eos> But Newmont just started drilling at 140 meters... and they're finding a whole lot of magnesite.<eos> Now, if you remember, we still own the option on Relief Canyon... which is next to them. We're not findin' squat.
Those boys'll ride with you.<eos> God, we work hard in this business, sometimes for nuthin'.<eos> I wake up every morning, I tell myself: "I don't have to do this".<eos> I get to do this.<eos> And then it's just... blue skies.<eos> Blue skies, baby.<eos> My old man... the legend.<eos> That was the last time I saw him alive.<eos> Hello? Pour one for Kenny.<eos> God bless you, Roy!
Any message you'd like to give to the readers of Gold Digger magazine?<eos> The last card you turn over is the only one that matters.<eos> Kenny, it's good to see you.<eos> Good morning, Beverly.<eos> Clive, how are you?<eos> There he is.<eos> Good to see you, sir.<eos> Good to see you, son.<eos> You know, your father and I, we started together in this business.<eos> Hell, he put me into business. I don't have to tell you that.
Let's take a... This isn't a deal, Brian... this is a goddam rape!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> No, no, no! This is mine!<eos> This is mine!<eos> I. I found it.<eos> Me and Mike, we were the ones up to our ass in the mud... and the shit and the malaria!<eos> And this little prick offers a minority partnership?<eos> Kenny, let's keep some perspective here, ok?<eos> Whenever anybody offers this amount of money, it's a good day.<eos> You may say yes, you may say no... but it's not like anybody's trying to offend you.
That was really great!<eos> What?<eos> Say again?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Kenny, what's going on?<eos> Kenny, what happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm going to find out.<eos> I don't know any more than you.<eos> You're not going to get away with this!
They're taking Washoe off the Board.<eos> You sold some, right? Yeah!<eos> Of course.<eos> Bobby?<eos> I thought...<eos> I thought it was just gonna keep on going up.<eos> Damn it, Bobby!<eos> I told you from the beginning... just put some away.<eos> Save a little bit, just in case.<eos> How many times did I tell you that?
I gotta sneak by the guy at the Front Desk 'cause I can't pay the hotel bill.<eos> I can't be a party to that information.<eos> Good luck, Mr. Wells.<eos> We'll be keeping an eye on you.<eos> What are you gonna do now, Wells?<eos> Hey, Kenny!<eos> I'm still worried about that mulberry over the back fence.<eos> Yeah, I know, Hart.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Good to see you too, Kenny.
Nick isn't legally allowed to leave the state of Georgia anymore.<eos> I've barely seen this guy since high school.<eos> What's wrong with spending some time with him?<eos> So spending time with family is suddenly important to you now?<eos> Look, he can come here tomorrow morning for breakfast.<eos> We can drive down to Boca during the day, maybe play a round of golf or two, then he'd be back here in Atlanta the next day.<eos> He can't just flake off for two days!<eos> The risk versus reward here is just... I don't see it happening.<eos> It's what she would have wanted, that's all.<eos> But if you have to get ready for your wedding, if you're that busy...
Thanks for doing this, by the way.<eos> Those fuckheads down at the DMV took my goddamn license away because of these fucking cataracts in my eye. But I can still hit the shit out of a golf ball, that's for sure!<eos> I made a tee time for us in Florida for this afternoon.<eos> You can use your grandmother's lady clubs, they're right there by the front door.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, you ready?<eos> I thought the plan was to have breakfast here?<eos> Now let's get in that giant labia you drove up in and get the fuck out of here.<eos> You sure I should be driving with this, Grandpa?<eos> Don't worry, if you spill it, this giant tampon we're driving in should soak it up.
I haven't had sex in 15 years, Jason, and I want to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!<eos> So that's what this is all about? This whole thing.<eos> You didn't want to be with me.<eos> You wanted me to drive you down to Boca so I could be your fucking wingman?<eos> Obviously I made a bad decision because you're nothing but a cock-blocking machine. I don't know what you are.<eos> You're like the Israeli Iron Dome defense system, - but with vaginas instead of missiles. - What?<eos> You're like some sort of Cock-blocking Terminator sent back from the future to cock-block humans.<eos> The robots should have sent you instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger, you could have cock-blocked John Connor's parents and he would never have been born!<eos> - Shut up, Grandpa!<eos> Shut up! - What got into you?
"Can we do this now?"<eos> "Jason Richard Kelly, son of..."<eos> "Doctor Smegma Von BoxMunchers."<eos> "David and Brooke, is a junior associate at the law firm of..."<eos> - "Cream pie fart and donkey punch!" - Okay, who is that?<eos> It's no one.<eos> It's a waiter with pretty bad Tourette's, I think...<eos> He just keeps walking by yelling weird shit, I don't know why...<eos> Okay, well, what restaurant are you at?<eos> I can barely even hear you now.
- No.<eos> - What?<eos> You did it. You turned into one of those people.<eos> I turned into one of those people that gives a shit about something?<eos> Are you gonna chain yourself to a polar bear?<eos> Only if you let me borrow...<eos> What is this, a beach sweater?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What, did you just come from skiing?<eos> Yeah, I skied in, just to see you save the world.
No, no, no, it's a FaceTime effect.<eos> All the kids are using them these days.<eos> There's a Hanukkah one. See?<eos> I don't like that one as much as the swastika full of dicks.<eos> Okay, let's discuss the wedding vows.<eos> Jason, why don't you begin by telling us all what it is you like about Meredith.<eos> Yeah, where do I start? She's...<eos> Hello.<eos> - Hello, buzzy bee. - What?<eos> If you can't think of anything, lean into them looks, dawg.
I know things got a little chaotic, but I'm so close with Lenore...<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> I'm about to get fucking married, Grandpa! In one week!<eos> To a Jewish girl!<eos> And I just woke up in fucking jail with a bunch of penises on my forehead in the shape of a swastika!<eos> Could call it a swasticock.<eos> - What? - It's a play on words.<eos> It's a play on words.<eos> Play on these words.<eos> I'm dropping you off at your old army vet buddy's house, he's gonna drive you to fucking Boca.
This?<eos> This is liver failure.<eos> - Who's the lesbian?<eos> - That's my grandson, Jason.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Is he here to scissor with me?<eos> Okay, that's just offensive to lesbians.<eos> I am very sorry, K.D. Lang.<eos> Time for Bingo! Come on.<eos> Stinky, we got to get you the fuck out of here.
You made all this up just so I'd come down here with you.<eos> I had to make sure you'd come.<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> - Just chill, Jason.<eos> Hakuna matata.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> I should have known you were fucking crazy the moment you started hitting on women the day after Grandma's funeral!<eos> Don't you fucking judge me. You have no idea what I had with your grandmother.<eos> And everything I've done these last few days I've done for a reason.<eos> You were about to fuck up royally by getting married, and you fucking know it! Yeah?
You 69 her, man! And then she's dead.<eos> Are you kidding me, Pam?<eos> This is what you drive?<eos> Yeah, it is so easy selling kids drugs from an ice cream truck. It's crazy!<eos> - Jason! Jason!<eos> - Go, go, go, go!<eos> Jason, stop!<eos> Stop right now.<eos> Stop!<eos> If you leave right now, you can kiss your job at the firm goodbye!
It means "to liberate the oppressed."<eos> You ready?<eos> - Yep.<eos> I don't think he's gonna find anybody as good as me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But you know what they say...<eos> "Tough times can sometimes lead to tougher people."<eos> That's Kurt Vonnegut.<eos> Holy fuckin' shit!<eos> Has anyone ever told you that you have the pussy of English Sheepdog?
Well, we'll work on it.<eos> You're a hard man to track down, Professor.<eos> - Are those my pants?<eos> - Yeah, these are your pants.<eos> I found a Werther's Original in the pocket and I've been sucking on it all morning.<eos> You do know that I'm not a professor, right?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You're just a dirty, dirty grandpa, and I'm just a girl from Long Island City who likes to fuck old people.<eos> I like your pull-out couch.<eos> Yeah, well, I got news for you. That's the only thing that's gonna be pulling out tonight.
You're just a dirty, dirty grandpa, and I'm just a girl from Long Island City who likes to fuck old people.<eos> I like your pull-out couch.<eos> Yeah, well, I got news for you. That's the only thing that's gonna be pulling out tonight.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm sorry. I don't know if I can do this.<eos> I haven't done it for a long time.<eos> I guess they just slipped off.<eos> I want you to tear open my bra like it's a social security check.<eos> Tell me you've fallen and you can't get up.
What?<eos> - BP sons of bitches sent Schlumberger guys home.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kuchta, why is the Bankston here?<eos> - Good morning to you too.<eos> - What is the Bankston doing here?<eos> Good morning, Pete.<eos> Happy to see me?<eos> I am always happy to see you, Andrea.
- What's the word?<eos> - I heard we done.<eos> -We're done?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Who you heard that from?<eos> - I can't tell you all that much.<eos> What do you mean you can't tell me that?<eos> - I just can't tell you.<eos> - Why can't you tell me that?<eos> I can not tell you.
Here we go, ladies.<eos> Time to strap on a feedbag.<eos> Yeah, chow time.<eos> And every good meal needs a little booze.<eos> Bronn?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, I'm sorry. No, no, no.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I got a soda around here somewhere.<eos> God bless you.
You came to my college last year and did some lectures on modern design theory.<eos> - Very fascinating.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm just thrilled to know that anybody actually attended one of my lectures.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How was your day?<eos> - It was fine.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're late again.<eos> Hardly see you these days.
I'm just thrilled to know that anybody actually attended one of my lectures.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How was your day?<eos> - It was fine.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're late again.<eos> Hardly see you these days.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm just super busy at work.<eos> I told you, this project is like the biggest thing we've ever done.
Yeah, she...<eos> She's...<eos> She's not like that.<eos> She doesn't...<eos> She...<eos> I don't know.<eos> She doesn't enjoy it.<eos> I don't know.<eos> My birthday?<eos> Yeah, look, I would if I could, but I told you how things are right now.
I've got to study.<eos> Michael.<eos> Hey, sweetie, what're you doing?<eos> I kept hearing weird noises last night.<eos> Freaked myself out, so I came in here.<eos> What kind of noises?<eos> Can you tell Michael to stay out of my room?<eos> He keeps leaving dirty hand marks everywhere.<eos> Hey, big guy.<eos> Something's bugging you, huh?
- Hey!<eos> - I'm really, uh, sorry to call you so late.<eos> Oh, that's fine.<eos> No problem.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I was just running through this latest round of designs that just came in.<eos> They're an absolute mess and I think I'm gonna need some one-on-one help to make this deadline.<eos> I was just wondering if there's any chance at all that you would be willing to work late for a couple of nights or maybe even over the weekend?<eos> Yeah. Whatever I can do to help you.
I am sure.<eos> - Where's my dress? - What's wrong with that?<eos> Simon will love it.<eos> You sure we can't split it?<eos> Hey, put your money away.<eos> - You'll pay for it later.<eos> - It's on us. I did reach.<eos> You saw me reach, right?<eos> Next time you bet your ass it's on you.<eos> Bronny, I need to tell you about this fascinating lecture I went to the other day...
- That may be true.<eos> - It is true.<eos> But he's my unbearable boss who is now going to tell the entire goddamn office that my wife can't get through a single dinner without bringing up our personal family problems.<eos> Thanks for dragging me along.<eos> Steph, where's Michael?<eos> Mikey?<eos> Mikey?<eos> Mikey.<eos> Honey.<eos> Sweetie, I told you not to play in here until we clean it up.
Darian, meanwhile, just got better looking. And that asshole knew it.<eos> That night, I picked up some cheeseburgers with my dad.<eos> What do I have that's any good? Tell me that.<eos> What have I ever had?<eos> Hey, you have a lot.<eos> You have love.<eos> You have my love.<eos> Very soon you're gonna have cheeseburgers.<eos> Oh, look!<eos> Did I not tell you?
Hey. So, just a heads up, but yesterday, when you were giving your lecture, you were like,<eos> "Blah, blah, blah, blah, then the North seceded from the Union,"<eos> you meant to say the South seceded.<eos> You accidentally said the exact opposite.<eos> I didn't want to raise my hand and be all,<eos> "Excuse me. These kids are pretty confusable."<eos> Just thought maybe you'd want to know.<eos> - Oh, hey. - Yeah?<eos> - Great catch. - Yeah.<eos> Now, I know that it was a long lecture, and you probably don't recall, but, uh, was there any point during it where you thought to yourself,
I just think it looks kind of bad.<eos> You know, it's kind of poofy, and I don't know.<eos> Do my arms look bad?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, you don't sound very believable, and you're making me nervous, Nadine.<eos> Your upper arms are breathtaking.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Well, it's last minute, but Brent called me. The dentist one. And he asked if I wanted to go to Manzanita for the weekend, and I thought, "You know what?<eos> "I deserve to be a little selfish once in a while, so..."<eos> You should go for as long as you want.

And he asked if I wanted to go to Manzanita for the weekend, and I thought, "You know what?<eos> "I deserve to be a little selfish once in a while, so..."<eos> You should go for as long as you want.<eos> Very funny.<eos> I'm gonna be back on Sunday.<eos> Okay?<eos> Just in time to surprise you.
- You just picked my nose.<eos> - No way.<eos> Mmm-mmm. - Do a gainer!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Darian!<eos> Darian!<eos> You need to get all these people out of the pool.<eos> Excuse me, all of you need to leave.<eos> Bye-bye!<eos> Hey, no one's listening to you.
Please rise above yourself, Nadine.<eos> Please suck several dicks, Darian.<eos> Oh, hey. I want you to meet some people.<eos> What's up?<eos> This is Krista.<eos> - Hi!<eos> - Hi.<eos> I'm Shannon. You were in my chem class last year, right?<eos> Yes! Yes.<eos> Nice to officially meet you.
Sorry, I keep...<eos> How are you?<eos> Are you good? You all right?<eos> Hey, so Tim's Theme Park's open late tonight.<eos> Do you want to meet there?<eos> So, how come they canceled the party?<eos> Oh. By "canceled," I more meant I left.<eos> - Gotcha.<eos> - Yeah. Thanks for driving, by the way.<eos> I don't have a license 'cause I'm like, "Why not just have people drive you?"
I look at you and I just see this really, really, really old man.<eos> - "Old"?<eos> - I'm complimenting you.<eos> I just see this very kind, very gentle, very wise old man.<eos> In a convalescent home.<eos> In a wheelchair.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I... I know you're mad at me because you think that I ditched you to play beer pong, and...
I mean, so hard your pillow was just soaked.<eos> That made me so sad.<eos> I got up and I went in my room. I got my pillow.<eos> Took the wet one for myself.<eos> I wish you loved me that much.<eos> Asshole.<eos> No, no.<eos> Hey, you're so messed up for bringing up that story. You're so messed up!<eos> I mean, do you even realize how sick in the head you are for bringing that up?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry you feel guilty for never caring about anyone but yourself. Oh, yeah.
You'll do the right thing.<eos> I know you will.<eos> I mean, look at that drink you're making.<eos> You want one?<eos> Oh. What did I do to make such a perfect kid, huh?<eos> Could you point me in the direction of the cat litter?<eos> Eight, I think.<eos> You go to Lakewood, right?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> I've seen you around.
I'm gonna have to talk to her about that.<eos> No, you're not!<eos> I can't drive you every morning.<eos> It puts me on the freeway late and adds 40 minutes.<eos> If you do that, I will do something equally terrible to you.<eos> I will tell everyone on Facebook that you pluck your nipples.<eos> How about that?<eos> All right.<eos> Look, just tell me what you wanna hear, and I'll say it. - Mom.<eos> - I want to make you feel better.
You know why you're not married?<eos> Because bald men are gross, and they're disgusting and especially the ones that make $45,000 a year.<eos> What?<eos> I've been doing this 23 years, and you're the first person to ever underestimate my salary.<eos> That made me feel good.<eos> I mean, that part.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm giving you half my cookie.<eos> Why?<eos> Make you feel better.
I'm gonna drown myself now.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey. Thanks for letting me come over.<eos> I'm glad you did.<eos> Do you wanna have sex right now?<eos> Okay. I'm just kidding.<eos> I was just...<eos> You know that I was just playing out the movie scene.<eos> You ever feel like you have to do that?
I could just sit with them.<eos> Well, my parents are in Korea for three months. - So, they won't make it.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> You've had this whole place to yourself for three months?<eos> Yay.<eos> No, I get it. It's...<eos> It's a big house.<eos> You're bored.<eos> You know what you need?<eos> You need someone to rob you, so you can reenact Home Alone.
You're coming with me.<eos> You know, my boss isn't gonna be happy about it, and you're the one that gets to explain it to him.<eos> Don't you have something to do?<eos> Schoolwork or something?<eos> Hmm?<eos> - Can I have this hole punch? - Give that to me.<eos> I want you to just sit there for the next eight hours and don't touch anything and don't make any noise.<eos> Can I mime?<eos> You're not funny. If my husband had any idea what I was gonna have to deal with...<eos> I love how you refer to him as your husband.
Actually, I'm just bored because I know everything you're gonna do before you do it. - Sure you do.<eos> - Oh, you don't believe me.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I'm gonna write down the next thing you're gonna say to me.<eos> - I'm not gonna play your little games, Nadine. - Your little games, Nadine.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Mmm.<eos> All right, you know what?<eos> Here's something you're not gonna guess. Hmm.<eos> Your dad would be so disappointed in the way you're turning out.
I am done trying to understand you.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, God, help me.<eos> Why do I even bother?<eos> Why do I even...<eos> You've never given me one thing.<eos> Any time I ask you for anything, you're like,<eos> "You need help with something? Let me help you.<eos> "I'm just playin'.<eos> I'm gonna butt-fuck you some more."
So do you...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mom?<eos> Hey, Mom?<eos> Oh.<eos> What are you doin'?<eos> It's going to Goodwill.<eos> All of it.<eos> Everything that's on the floor, gone!<eos> Mom, why don't you just calm down, okay? No.
What are you doing?<eos> I'm handling it.<eos> Wow.<eos> Look at this view, it's amazing.<eos> Look, you know what to do.<eos> I'm not gonna be an asshole and tell you.<eos> Look, you know what to do...<eos> I love this song.<eos> I can't believe this is happening.<eos> There's so much that I've wanted to tell you and ask you.
I wasn't saying that because it's shitty.<eos> All right.<eos> No, God, no. Look, I love your car, okay.<eos> I don't even have a car.<eos> I'm just acting weird, and this is just all a lot.<eos> And please stop.<eos> Please don't leave.<eos> - Fuck!<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't understand you. - What do you...
Get in the car.<eos> Well, I don't feel like getting in the car with you and her.<eos> Do you know what I've been doing all night?<eos> I'll find another ride.<eos> Hey, get in the car. Stop!<eos> No, you think this is fun for me? - Let go of me!<eos> - You think I like this?<eos> Where were you?<eos> You can't pick up your phone even once?<eos> You don't need to pretend to give a shit about me just because people are watching.
Hey, I just want you to know you're right, Nadine.<eos> - Darian, we don't need to do this...<eos> - You're right about everything!<eos> I don't give a shit about you.<eos> I'm only here for me, and my life is fuckin' incredible.<eos> I love it.<eos> No, I love spending another night talking Mom off the ledge.<eos> I love only applying to schools nearby because who knows what'll happen in the house if I'm not around to fix it?<eos> And I love that the one person who makes me feel like I could take a fuckin' breath,<eos> I can't have without completely destroying you.
Why did she not leave that choice up to him?<eos> Maybe I should go fetch her.<eos> I know you're there, and I know you can hear me.<eos> You may have no tongue, but there is nothing wrong with your ears.<eos> Why do doubts rise in your heart?<eos> Why are you troubled?<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> How does it feel to be a murderess?<eos> Do you know why I'm here?<eos> I'm here to punish you.
The Reverend. He locked me up in the barn.<eos> Oh! Where'd you get to, huh?<eos> You scared your mother.<eos> Had her worried sick.<eos> Shall I facepaint you?<eos> This afternoon, what were you and the Reverend talking about?<eos> Did he talk about me?<eos> Mama, are you evil?<eos> The reverend said you murdered a man.<eos> He says he's here to punish you.

Come, honey.<eos> All right, Meng, let's talk fucking Turkey.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Lookie here!<eos> Fresh meat.<eos> Swallow it right on down, girlie.<eos> Soon you'll be swallowing something else.<eos> What's your name, girl?<eos> Joanna.<eos> Did your daddy bring you here?
What's your name, girl?<eos> Joanna.<eos> Did your daddy bring you here?<eos> No?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Didn't he just think you were so good, he had to let the rest of the world in on it, too?<eos> Hyah! Hyah!<eos> Whoa, there now, where do you think you're going?<eos> They're leaving without me!<eos> Yes, they are, but don't you worry about a thing 'cause from now on, this is where you live, darling.
No?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Didn't he just think you were so good, he had to let the rest of the world in on it, too?<eos> Hyah! Hyah!<eos> Whoa, there now, where do you think you're going?<eos> They're leaving without me!<eos> Yes, they are, but don't you worry about a thing 'cause from now on, this is where you live, darling.<eos> Right here.<eos> Now, come on now.<eos> Let's get you cleaned up.
I don't mind it, Joanna.<eos> It's just a game, right?<eos> You do that again and I'm going to shoot.<eos> Please put the gun down.<eos> Don't you ever.<eos> Just keep pointing it at me.<eos> Don't you dare drop that gun on me.<eos> That's right.<eos> Keep pointing it at me.<eos> Don't you dare.
You see that?<eos> What do you say we have her join us next time?<eos> This is just between me and Frank.<eos> All I want is a fair fight.<eos> Then what are you doing here?<eos> Blow him to hell!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I'm not a violent man.<eos> I usually work with numbers.<eos> But now, I'm standing here in front of you to shoot you dead, Frank.
Then what are you doing here?<eos> Blow him to hell!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I'm not a violent man.<eos> I usually work with numbers.<eos> But now, I'm standing here in front of you to shoot you dead, Frank.<eos> My daughter is dead because of you.<eos> It's men like you who think their actions have no consequences, who are making the country turn into what it's turning into.<eos> So, for my daughter's sake, for every daughter's sake,<eos> I have to kill you.
But you made me do it.<eos> And only you can save me.<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> I have sinned because we should have finished the ceremony first.<eos> Paul, the apostle, wrote it in the first Corinthians.<eos> Help me, Joanna.<eos> I can't.<eos> Then we shall both burn in hell.<eos> I am here to save you, so that you can save me.
He used to put cigars out on my arm, the sadistic fuck.<eos> And he was a pervert, just like you.<eos> I killed him when I was nine years old.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You have a real special daughter.<eos> She deserves to be free.<eos> You think you can come in here and take that which belongs to me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you think?<eos> That God's gonna come down here and save you?
I don't know...<eos> A sawmill or something...<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Have you ever fired one of those things before?<eos> This is my fight.<eos> I should be the one holding the gun.<eos> I need you to stay with Sam.<eos> There's no use shooting from that distance.<eos> It's more difficult than you think, especially with a gun like that.<eos> I was truly prepared to forgive you, back in Bismuth.
Miller? Yeah.<eos> Are you naked? Yeah.<eos> A bomb drops on you in 1943.<eos> It is 1943<eos> September the 3rd, 1943.<eos> The whole day, every day.<eos> Its our loop.<eos> Right on time.<eos> Ms. Peregrine.<eos> Delighted to meet you.
To the police?<eos> Are you implying Abe died an unnatural death?<eos> I found him in the woods with eyes missing.<eos> I'd say that was pretty unnatural.<eos> Unless essential. I don't discuss unpleasant matters.<eos> An Ymbryne's is a duty to protect children, Jake.<eos> I am not a child.<eos> He wanted you to tell me everything.<eos> How frustrating for you.<eos> Between Ms. Peregrine rules and my ******* not to scare you off. It's like no ones telling you anything? !
Leader of what?<eos> Who are these people?<eos> Bad people... bad peculiars.<eos> Abe dedicated his life to hunting them down.<eos> These are the ones he never found.<eos> What do you mean "hunting"?<eos> They raided homes.<eos> Whole homes full of children left for dead.<eos> Abe took lives... To save life's.<eos> He only retired when you were born to protect you.
That was Abe's greatest gift of all.<eos> He could see the monsters.<eos> We call them 'Hollowgasts'.<eos> Hollows.<eos> For short. My grandpa told me about people, who turn into monsters.<eos> Is that what they are?<eos> I will explain everything, Jake.<eos> I fear its my duty now considering... but you should know that in doing so...<eos> I'm breaking a solemn promise.<eos> I knew you were peculiar when you were born but your grandfather... forbid me to tell you anything.
I'll hold him as long as I can when are you going to realise you are a terrible shot with that thing?<eos> Get the others, I'll meet you at the.<eos> Loop entrance.<eos> He's getting out.<eos> Eventually you're going to run out of breath and it'll all be over.<eos> Death for your beloved Jake and Miss Megan Peregrinee... and everlasting life for me.<eos> Olive!<eos> Olive!<eos> I'm so sorry, Olive.<eos> All these years I never appreciated you.
- Which can be no bad thing.<eos> - And what about the Hollows?<eos> As long as they are out there, you are not safe.<eos> We don't need you to make us feel safe, Jake.<eos> Because you made us feel brave.<eos> And thats even better.<eos> Cmon guys, lets go!<eos> And then we said goodbye and loop closed.<eos> I was so scared that you wouldn't be here.<eos> I'd never see you again.
No.<eos> Get to know him.<eos> I had to pull some strings, but I sent him your Polaroids, and he has agreed to do a test with you.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> It sounds great.<eos> It sounds...<eos> Sounds good.<eos> Well, there's just a teensy bit of paperwork.<eos> I'll need a copy of your drivers license and a voided check, and I can take those right now.<eos> When did you graduate from high school?
That's my chair.<eos> Well.<eos> You certainly move fast.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You must be fucking him.<eos> Sarno doesn't let just anyone walk his collection.<eos> I don't think I'm his type.<eos> Why not?<eos> You're very masculine.<eos> I bet they made you do the casting.
Why are these chairs so far back?<eos> I'm gonna move them up.<eos> President Eisenhower went on to say that the government has what he termed,<eos> "all sorts of useful projects on the shelf,"<eos> to be put into action against the recession if and when they're needed.<eos> The economy of this country is a lot stronger than the spirit of those people that I see...<eos> "Bless us, oh, Lord, for these, Thy gifts "that we are about to receive from thy bounty, "through Christ, Our Lord.<eos> - "Amen."<eos> - Amen.<eos> Well, from all I've read about Howard Hughes I hope he doesn't expect to meet you in some hotel room.
Varnish the cane.<eos> Butter the muffin.<eos> I get it.<eos> Bye, girls.<eos> Mam ie told me that six months ago one of the drivers got fired because he ate dinner with her.<eos> But Sally says all the drivers have to be hired through their churches.<eos> Fine, that doesn't make them angels.<eos> And when is Frank Forbes' fiancée coming to town, anyway?<eos> ♪ I don't want a ricochet romance ♪ ♪ I don't want a ricochet love ♪<eos> ♪ If you're careless with your kisses ♪

He won't even meet with his wife.<eos> - Lucky woman.<eos> - He won't let anybody look at him.<eos> - Oh, well, he's right!<eos> - There's no reason...<eos> Because they might see exactly what he is, a cold, sleazy, egomaniacal, old fake not worth meeting with.<eos> You wanna have meetings or make movies?<eos> They got names for guys that are doing what you're doing, Frank.<eos> Who do you think you're talking to?<eos> I think I'm talking to somebody that sold out and you can tell the guy that you sold out to that I'm never going back to that stupid house!

Any thoughts as to what may happen...<eos> We've lost touch.<eos> I'm sorry I was in such a bad mood when you came to Las Vegas.<eos> When was that?<eos> Five years ago?<eos> I was not at my best.<eos> I know that, Howard.<eos> Neither was I.<eos> Mamie Murphy knows Richard Miskin very well.<eos> She told me that she was very sure he never met you.
Deep breath!<eos> And we're back in the now.<eos> Chuck!<eos> You've had your hand up the whole time.<eos> My poem is about a hate crime.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Lot of sickos out there.<eos> Lot of sickos.<eos> What?<eos> Oh what did I make you of?

You messed up there.
Water is the softest thing, yet it can penetrate mountains and earth.<eos> Here's my thought of the day.<eos> When are we done?<eos> Red, what the caterpillar calls the end, the world calls a butterfly.<eos> Can I just say I never understand a single thing you're talking about?<eos> That's very lifelike.<eos> So deep.<eos> And, Terence, let's see your...<eos> My goodness.<eos> I did not know you felt that way.
Get rid of them!<eos> Get him off of there!<eos> It's too strong.<eos> I can't break it. Ah!<eos> Bomb, blow up the chain.<eos> Come on, Bomb, you can do this.<eos> Come on, Bomb, you got this.<eos> Blow up.<eos> You gotta get me mad.<eos> Okay, well, then what makes you mad?
Shoot it!<eos> Okeydoke.<eos> Fire!<eos> And a one and a...<eos> Take that, porkers!<eos> Incoming!<eos> Boom, baby, boom!<eos> Well, how about that? My teacher can shoot fireballs out of her butt. You!<eos> What's your name? Hal?<eos> I've seen you do something strange before, right?
Great, thank you.<eos> Bye.<eos> They moved my call forward.<eos> All right.<eos> See you later.<eos> I did tell you that I'd have to do some work.<eos> Come have a drink with us.<eos> - Uh, I'm okay, thanks.<eos> - It's not okay.<eos> Your woman just left you.
A teacher.<eos> Then how the fuck can you afford this restaurant?<eos> My wife is a successful lawyer.<eos> How long are you in Morocco for?<eos> We leave in a couple of days.<eos> Why don't you come to a party with us tonight?<eos> It's a Russian party.<eos> Maybe another time.<eos> What other time?<eos> I'll never fucking see you again.
Hold it up to me.<eos> It's a game.<eos> Now put it away.<eos> If I remember the number on that card, you come with me to the party, and if I fuck up, I'll give you $5,000, okay?<eos> All right.<eos> 5673 0976 2121 0508.<eos> Call your wife, Professor.<eos> Hey, it's me again.<eos> Look, you must still be on your call.<eos> I popped out for a drink with those guys from the restaurant and I just didn't want you to worry.
- Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, this is a coincidence.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I don't even know your name.<eos> Luke.<eos> I'm gonna bet that's not your real name.<eos> No?<eos> Shall we?<eos> I'm sorry to call you back like this, but we've had a chance to examine the contents of the memory stick.
Did Dima ever mention your involvement in any future negotiations?<eos> What negotiations?<eos> He's asked to meet us in Paris.<eos> He wants you there when we make contact with him.<eos> - Why?<eos> - He doesn't trust us.<eos> Probably worried we'll get the information we need out of him and feed him back to the wolves.<eos> - But he hardly knows me.<eos> - He knew you well enough to know you'd pass on his message.<eos> Obviously thinks you're a man of principle.
When he does, look surprised, then listen carefully to every word he says.<eos> Just be yourselves.<eos> If his companions question you, stick to the truth as much as you can.<eos> It's always more convincing.<eos> Professor!<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> Dima.<eos> First I kiss your wife.<eos> Lovely to see you.<eos> Don't tell me he's taking you to a fucking museum.
£10 million on signature.<eos> Another £10 million on first day of trading.<eos> All paid to a secret account in Switzerland.<eos> I need their account numbers.<eos> Bankers, politicians, all of them.<eos> I don't have them until after Bern.<eos> I make the payments to them at the same time I sign over the accounts that I control to the Arena Bank.<eos> Well, then, I'm afraid I can't do anything for you or your family until then.<eos> Why can't you get them out now?<eos> This doesn't concern you.
It's funny you here in Paris.<eos> Why is it funny?<eos> You, me, Dima.<eos> It's like Morocco.<eos> It was sunnier in Morocco.<eos> Oh, no, merci.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Who you work for, Professor?<eos> I teach at a London university.<eos> Maybe I come visit you in London, visit your house, we go to football match together.
You were 12, maybe 13 years old and you were so excited.<eos> You couldn't wait to kill something.<eos> And then we saw this buck and you raised the rifle, but the buck just looked at you, kept on grazing.<eos> It wasn't afraid.<eos> You tried and tried to pull that trigger, but you couldn't.<eos> So you started crying like a little girl.<eos> So I had to take the rifle and kill it for you.<eos> Papa's on the move.<eos> They'll be with you shortly at the Bellevue.<eos> Luke, make sure he sees you in the lobby.
Hello?<eos> We're fine.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Just a sec.<eos> Perry?<eos> It's Hector.<eos> He wants a word.<eos> They want me to go alone.<eos> They want you to go ahead.<eos> They're gonna send a helicopter to pick you up.
Yeah, so, she opened the door. And I'm like, "Yo.<eos> Chill.<eos> I ain't about that drama."<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> "I know you got another nigga in the crib."<eos> What's up?<eos> What?<eos> Can I get the shit?<eos> What shit?<eos> I just gave you $300 for some weed.
That guy was not fucking around.<eos> Yeah, you probably should have picked a different girl.<eos> Fuck that, it almost worked.<eos> Hey, do you remember when you fought Eric Moscowitz in sixth grade?<eos> Yeah, he did that windmill thing with his arms.<eos> That was the sickest.<eos> He was unbeatable.<eos> You remember that shit?<eos> That's it.<eos> Dude, he would have killed me if you didn't jump in.
As God as my witness, - I will get you your guns.<eos> Hello?<eos> What a fucking piece of shit!<eos> Do you believe this fucking guy?<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> What guns, David?<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> You told me you guys were selling bed sheets.<eos> Yeah, and I also told you that we're selling other stuff too.
Honestly, we were out of our league.<eos> Change $10,000.<eos> Any luck today?<eos> Efraim!<eos> What's up, bro?<eos> Where you been?<eos> Why aren't you answering your phone?<eos> I'm with a prostitute.<eos> What's up?<eos> Okay, you need to get dressed and come with me right now.
It's Efraim and David.<eos> We have a serious fucking problem.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> The AK ammunition, it's Chinese.<eos> What, you think the Afghans who are getting shot up by the Taliban give a shit where their ammo comes from?<eos> No, but the Pentagon does.<eos> Henry, you know we can't use Chinese!<eos> America has an embargo against China.<eos> You had your boys show us the one crate of Albanian ammo in the entire country.<eos> I'm sorry, did anyone prevent you from inspecting the other crates?
Please.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> David, we need to talk.<eos> Now's not a good time.<eos> I have not been paid yet.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Like for the month?<eos> Ever.<eos> You haven't been paid anything?
We'll stay in the same spot.<eos> We'll blow the whistle.<eos> We'll give whoever's coming to look for us... a chance to find us.<eos> You're gonna steer a ship without hydraulics?<eos> That's your plan?<eos> How's that gonna work?<eos> I'm gonna build a manual tiller.<eos> Hey, Sybert, why should we even listen to you?<eos> The only thing you ever cared about was this ship.<eos> Man, I'll tell you what.
Yeah, she asked me, Chief.<eos> Wow.<eos> You, uh, sure you got your pants on, Webber... or is she wearin' 'em?<eos> Sounds like this girl cut off your...<eos> What, Webber?<eos> What?<eos> Huh?<eos> Don't you got boats to tie up?<eos> She's my fiancée, sir.<eos> Who asked you... to be married.
Nantucket's dispatched their 36-footer to the Mercer.<eos> We got orders to do the same.<eos> You asked Cluff yet?<eos> That's him, right?<eos> Not yet, sweet... Uh...<eos> I'll explain later.<eos> - I... I gotta go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.
- Quiet down now.<eos> My God, give me a break.<eos> Uh, I was on my way home.<eos> My car spun out into a ditch.<eos> I need some help.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> We live near here.<eos> We can go back to my house.<eos> I'll call my brother.<eos> He can tow you out.
Here.<eos> Come on, take it.<eos> Use it.<eos> Got it, Pop!<eos> We lost the pumps.<eos> The pumps are tripping the breakers.<eos> I'll go check the connection.<eos> Give me the light.<eos> It's not worth a damn, Bouloo.<eos> Sometimes, I wish I didn't understand you.
The storm's easing up, boys... so we just look for the lights on the shore to guide us in.<eos> Even if we have to go so far as Nobska Point, so be it.<eos> We just gotta find land.<eos> Been one heck of a long day, right, fellas?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure has.<eos> But don't you give up hope on me now.<eos> She's a good boat.<eos> She'll get us through.<eos> We'll get you home, okay?
Clara, let's go.<eos> I am not my father.<eos> - And you really mean that?<eos> D'Antonio!<eos> D'Antonio, we got to hoof it!<eos> - All right!<eos> - No, no. No!<eos> This isn't how it was supposed to...<eos> - I love you!<eos> - I love you, too!
Shit.<eos> Are you worth $850, you shiny devil, huh?<eos> Alpha, Romeo, tango.<eos> Sir?<eos> Where are we headed after the drop?<eos> Not my concern.<eos> Or yours.<eos> Hey, so what's in the crate, huh?<eos> I hear it's toilet paper for General MacArthur.<eos> So why'd you join the Marines?
Your requested cereal, Chief.<eos> Hey, Lindy here has a confession to make.<eos> This asshole wanted to join the Army.<eos> But he ended up in the Navy, and he doesn't know how to swim.<eos> I'll tell him tell him why he doesn't need to know how to swim.<eos> Because we won't be going in the water, sir?<eos> Hey, son, you any idea how old the ship is?<eos> It's 13 years old. 13 is an unlucky number.<eos> We have the unlucky privilege of carrying God knows what with no protection across the ocean.<eos> So you don't need to swim because if you go in the drink, and the Japs don't get you...
Don't go nowhere.<eos> Sir, please don't go nowhere.<eos> - Don't go nowhere. Please don't go nowhere.<eos> - How's my little boy?<eos> - He's good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - He's strong, like his daddy.<eos> Don't go nowhere. Don't leave me here.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm not leaving you.
Sir, please don't go nowhere.<eos> - Don't go nowhere. Please don't go nowhere.<eos> - How's my little boy?<eos> - He's good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - He's strong, like his daddy.<eos> Don't go nowhere. Don't leave me here.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> What I'm saying, Fireplug, is if you gotta leave a woman, you always make sure she thinks she left you.
We might even have a new New Testament!<eos> What's going on over there!<eos> Get in the raft!<eos> Get in the raft!<eos> You men, out of the water!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You stop swimming, you get out of the water!<eos> Where in the hell's he going?<eos> What happened?<eos> May he shine his face upon you.
Captain!<eos> Help me.<eos> It's okay...<eos> Oh, Christ have mercy on me!<eos> "He wandered into the mess hall gleam in his eyes, rolled the dice, and said, 'Lady luck is a friend of mine.<eos> Open up and let it shine.'"<eos> - What are you doing? - I'm reading.<eos> - What?<eos> - Reading!<eos> You're gonna have to do better than that.
Was there anything I could have done?<eos> You were exposed.<eos> We were there.<eos> As a commander in the Imperial Japanese Navy, it was my duty to kill you.<eos> But as a man...<eos> I have regrets.<eos> I had a good idea of what we were carrying.<eos> I, too, did my duty.<eos> But as a man... I find no... honor in it.<eos> I often wonder how things would be if I had stopped you before you completed your mission.
Maybe you sing a little song, eh?<eos> I will join you.<eos> We can sing together how you saved the grateful Chinos.<eos> You saw what happened out there, and that's what you say?<eos> I see black powder.<eos> - I see a man forget his friends.<eos> - The black powder's not going anywhere.<eos> What goes nowhere is you.<eos> You'll never get what you want from this.<eos> You think they see you as some kind of hero?
I've trained for this my whole life.<eos> Trust.<eos> I'll get you the shot.<eos> I've got you.<eos> So, how's life without me?<eos> A little slow.<eos> - You're a hero after all.<eos> - Oh, it looks that way.<eos> You seem pleased with yourself..<eos> And what are they giving you for all your troubles?
It's good to have you back, Duncan.<eos> And, thank you, Tora, for bringing him.<eos> No, thank you, Richard, for everything, for the house, for my job, for... - the adoption.<eos> - It's what families are for.<eos> Anything you ever need, please don't hesitate to ask.<eos> - How are you finding the islands dear?<eos> - I think they're beautiful.<eos> - And the hospital?<eos> You're settling in?<eos> - Ken treating you well, I hope.
What if she was murdered less than three years ago?<eos> You're not!<eos> Okay, so you're going to turn your back on a sacrificial murder?<eos> Now, you listen to me, and you listen to me good.<eos> Sacrificial, satanic, ritualistic.<eos> They're all words I don't want to hear.<eos> If you want someone dead, you slit their throat or you put a pillow over their head.<eos> Maybe you blow their brains out with a shotgun but you do not do what was done to that poor girl and I don't care what you call it.<eos> What are you doing still standing there?<eos> Well, what do you expect him to say?
You're tense as hell.<eos> Yeah. - Duncan.<eos> - Guthrie!<eos> I was wondering when you were going to show your face around here.<eos> Get your hands off my wife.<eos> Just being friendly.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Lunch, remember?<eos> Right.<eos> So, you know you've got nothing to worry about with Ken, I mean...
There were over 50 people at her service.<eos> Including McKie here.<eos> That's true.<eos> You seem very sure of Theresa Renney's medical records.<eos> That's because my own wife passed away right around the same time.<eos> It was a very hard time for everyone.<eos> - I'm telling you he's lying.<eos> - Oh, Tora.<eos> Stephen Renney may have murdered his wife.<eos> That doesn't bother you?
Tora, you've got to stop this.<eos> But if it was me out there, you would stop?<eos> - That's an American accent, isn't it?<eos> - Uh, New York.<eos> We went to Florida last year with the nippers.<eos> Disneyland.<eos> Or is it Disney World?<eos> - I always get them confused.<eos> - Yes, it's an easy mistake.<eos> Here, you, never mind her.
Now I've become death, the destroyer of worlds.<eos> Not sure that I could make that work.<eos> It is with great pleasure tonight that I introduce the architect of our ancient order's future.<eos> Please welcome the CEO of Abstergo Foundation,<eos> Dr. Alan Rikkin.<eos> With the recovery of the Apple, we are now in possession of the complete genetic road map to humanity's instincts.<eos> Any impulse towards independence, resistance or rebellion will be crushed.<eos> Any predisposition that might oppose our march of progress can now be eradicated.<eos> All I have to do is shout.<eos> I'm here to help you.
You see?<eos> Even your house is fat.<eos> I'm on a diet.<eos> You're always on a diet, Mum, but you're always fat. Mmm-hmm.<eos> Because you never stop eating! Mmm-hmm.<eos> Now will you please... just stop for one second and look at what you've done?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, I love that girl.<eos> Your death threats, m'lady.<eos> Everybody bloody hates you!
You make me sick.<eos> I'm innocent.<eos> Patsy Stone.<eos> But I am innocent.<eos> Excuse me, guys.<eos> I'm the victim here.<eos> I'm Patsy Stone, but I am innocent.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thursday.<eos> Can you please shut up, darling?
Edina must be back in 3 days for the primary hearing.<eos> I don't care about her.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> Let me. No!<eos> I'm better on my own.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> I know you.<eos> My mother used to bring me here as a child.<eos> Christopher, I know you're here.<eos> I just saw you.
I'm wearing this.<eos> But not those shoes.<eos> Those shoes, darling.<eos> Not those shoes.<eos> But I like these shoes.<eos> They make you hobble.<eos> I'm wearing them anyway.<eos> I have thin ankles.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What that woman has done to you.
Darling, don't think about it.<eos> They can't tie it to us.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Eddy, living well is the best revenge.<eos> This could be our life, couldn't it?<eos> This is our life.<eos> We're not going back.<eos> And what's to miss?<eos> Just things.<eos> You've never had attachments, have you?
Darling, I know you think I don't know who I am and what I've done.<eos> But I do, darling, I do.<eos> I'm disgusting.<eos> Always wanting everything, always taking more.<eos> Wearing stupid... ridiculous small, small, small, stylish, stupid, ridiculous clothing!<eos> You think it's hard living with me, try being at this end, darling.<eos> And it is all about me, isn't it?<eos> It has been all about me.<eos> And me, Eds.<eos> Darling... I've never given you the love that you deserve.
Don't let this repellent little shrew take it away from us.<eos> Every time our life hits a good patch, this miserable piece of flesh ruins it.<eos> If you don't tell her, I will!<eos> Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.<eos> No!<eos> Lubey, I have something to tell you.<eos> I'm not a man.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'm not a woman.<eos> Well, you don't mind sleeping with him/her?
Is he breathing?<eos> Hal?<eos> Hal, can you hear me?<eos> Hal, can you hear me?<eos> Hal...<eos> Come on.<eos> He's dilated.<eos> Hal...<eos> What do you think you're doin'?<eos> I'm gonna have to beat you now, you know the rules.
He's violent enough already.<eos> Okay, fine, you go smother him in kisses.<eos> You tell him the world's a soft and gentle place.<eos> Hal's gonna be okay.<eos> I could have killed him.<eos> Yes, you could have.<eos> Murder, it's the worst sin of all.<eos> And to take another man's life, that is the most egregious sin in the Lord's sight.<eos> Nothing hurts his heart so much.<eos> Don't you understand English?
I don't want to have to visit my sons here.<eos> Daddy, I signed up already.<eos> I couldn't do otherwise, Pop.<eos> Everybody else is doing...<eos> You ain't everybody else!<eos> Everybody else jumps in and does things quick, without thinking!<eos> Like the damn idiot fools we were.<eos> And soldiers who live, they live because they can do that!<eos> You can't!<eos> Look, you gotta sit and think and pray about everything!
Let's go, move it. Move it.<eos> You are a very strange-looking individual if you don't mind me saying so, Private.<eos> Name?<eos> Andy Walker.<eos> How long have you been dead, son?<eos> Sir?<eos> I am not "Sir"!<eos> I am Sergeant Howell or Sarge.<eos> "Sir" you save for useless people.<eos> The name is "Ghoul," you say?
Come on.<eos> We gotta move right now.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Go! Go! Go!<eos> You better get the hell out of here! Move! Move!<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I'm scared. It's going to help the pain.<eos> No, don't.<eos> Don't you do that. Come on.<eos> Come on, Smitty, you stay with me.
Thank you<eos> Hi<eos> Hi<eos> You're here?<eos> I told you, I come here often to record folk singers<eos> Yeah, that's right<eos> My recorder conked off.<eos> I had to send it to Delhi to get it fixed<eos> So I just came to collect it<eos> What brings you here?
I need to finish.<eos> You should go.<eos> I should go?<eos> Okay...<eos> Okay, I'll just go.<eos> But first, I'm gonna ask you a question.<eos> You're gonna give me an answer.<eos> Why would you and Pop go to that funeral?<eos> She left us.<eos> Do you not remember that?
You should go.<eos> I should go?<eos> Okay...<eos> Okay, I'll just go.<eos> But first, I'm gonna ask you a question.<eos> You're gonna give me an answer.<eos> Why would you and Pop go to that funeral?<eos> She left us.<eos> Do you not remember that?<eos> Do you not remember that?
"Missed you, too, Braxton."<eos> "Missed you, too, because I love you."<eos> "You're my brother."<eos> Maybe...<eos> Do you want to...<eos> Maybe I could see you in a week?<eos> You name the place. I'll be there.<eos> How will I find you?<eos> You won't.<eos> I'll find you.
Thanks.<eos> Look what he got tonight!<eos> Much obliged, everybody.<eos> Man, ain't that the breaks, I...<eos> That was quite a display.<eos> It's not everyday you meet an American... that plays baccarat.<eos> It's not everyday I meet someone... who leaves me speechless.<eos> Samantha.<eos> I run Guest Services for the casino.<eos> The hotel would like to offer you... a suite for the evening... if you are interested.
- Where's your wallet?<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Forgive me for not being able... to grab my wallet before being kidnapped.<eos> How about that nice watch of yours?<eos> Not my watch.<eos> No. Well, how bad do you want to get me in Macau, Bennie?<eos> Money, money, money, okay?<eos> You know, I think I got you figured out.<eos> Something tells me you're either unhappily married... or there's no one waiting for you at home.
Your turn.<eos> You must be tired. Always running away.<eos> I mean it looks pretty tiring... fighting as hard as you do.<eos> Impressed?<eos> No. I'm actually kinda pissed.<eos> Don't point that thing at me, man.<eos> Hurry up, hurry up!<eos> Which part of the pig am I blowing on?<eos> Is that what we're trying to make?<eos> The cops ask any questions... you just look at them like you don't understand a word, okay?
I had no choice.<eos> I did what I had to do to get the phone back...<eos> We never touched her, just scared her a little.<eos> Tell him, Willie.<eos> I was only following your orders.<eos> If I had known who she was...<eos> You liar.<eos> You couldn't have achieved any of this without me.<eos> I am the money man. You need me.<eos> That's where you're wrong, Victor.
You really don't know when to stop, do you?<eos> Connor?<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> I'll tell you over breakfast.<eos> Forget breakfast.<eos> Where is Bennie?<eos> I have to go find something to open this with.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Don't you dare leave me here.
- No.<eos> - Good job.<eos> - Great job.<eos> One take.<eos> Perfect.<eos> BMW X5, 300 horsepower.<eos> 27 miles to the gallon. What are you doing?<eos> A commercial?<eos> - BMW, bring me one.<eos> - They won't give you.
I'm losing him in a little shadow.<eos> - You kidding me?<eos> - Just move in.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Director wanted a better angle on your face.<eos> There's kind of a... A little shadow.<eos> "A little shadow"?<eos> Patty, "A little shadow"?<eos> He could have killed you much easier off camera, Lee.<eos> There's a reason he's interrupted you on live TV.
You have always been such a fucking failure.<eos> - You sat down in the basement all night...<eos> - Molly, just reading your fucking books, thinking you are some kind of a smart guy, but you aren't.<eos> You fucking aren't. And now you go and you do this?<eos> You blow all your mother's money like some kind of a halfwit and then you come in here with a fucking bomb?<eos> Turn it off, for Christ's sake!<eos> You hardly even know how to use a screwdriver!<eos> That is how useless you are around the house!<eos> And now you're going and you're building fucking bombs?<eos> Since when did you become such a man all of a sudden?
- No, they won't help us.<eos> What about the hacker guy from the Citi security breach segment?<eos> - The guy with the Yoda voice.<eos> - Yes! Yes! Find him.<eos> Quickly.<eos> Watch your head.<eos> Step here.<eos> Bree, where the hell is Ron Sprecher?<eos> And has he gotten to the SEC yet?<eos> I will check, but I need to tell you something first.
You can say that you eat what you see is the same as you see it you eat.<eos> Or that I get what I want is the same as I want what I get.<eos> It's the same for you, doctor.<eos> - Can I get some?<eos> - No.<eos> This is not for people like you.<eos> I will not tolerate it!<eos> - But it's medicine.<eos> - Actual.<eos> Is that why they call you crazy?
What was Oogway thinking?<eos> I think he heard us.<eos> I didn't hear anything.<eos> He said you're a loser.<eos> I'm sorry, Oogway.<eos> Would you stop doing that?<eos> How was your first day teaching?<eos> Humiliating.<eos> I heard.<eos> Who told you?
He said you're a loser.<eos> I'm sorry, Oogway.<eos> Would you stop doing that?<eos> How was your first day teaching?<eos> Humiliating.<eos> I heard.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Did Tigress tell you?<eos> I heard from Monkey, and Crane, and Mantis... and your dad, and Mrs. Chow from the gift shop... and those ducks you just passed... and Tigress told me.<eos> Did she also tell you that it'll never happen again?
Well, good luck to you.<eos> You, too.<eos> I hope you find your son.<eos> And I hope you find your father.<eos> Son?<eos> Oh, my gosh, it is you!<eos> Well, don't just stand there.<eos> Give your old man a hug!<eos> I can't believe you're alive!<eos> I thought I lost you forever, Little Lotus.
But I still don't understand.<eos> I thought Po was the only panda left.<eos> No.<eos> There's a whole bunch of us.<eos> Where?<eos> A secret panda village in the mountains.<eos> A secret panda...<eos> But how did you know where I was?<eos> I received a message that led me here.<eos> How could you receive a message if no one could find you?
Rats!<eos> Now, what's all this about a Dragon Warrior?<eos> How did you know I was a Dragon Warrior?<eos> Did the universe tell you that, too?<eos> No, the poster did.<eos> And the gift shop.<eos> I bought a tiny cup.<eos> Oh, right, of course!<eos> You have no idea.<eos> There's so much to show you.
Someone broke that once.<eos> -Who?<eos> -Some idiot.<eos> Wow!<eos> This is Master Flying Rhino's battle armor!<eos> I wonder if I could fit in that.<eos> Get out of my head, Dad!<eos> I've wondered the same thing!<eos> If I could fit in it?<eos> If you could?
Come on, throw it!<eos> I'm coming for you.<eos> Bring it on, Master Rhino.<eos> Here I come!<eos> I'm gonna get you.<eos> I am gonna get you!<eos> I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you!<eos> I'm gonna get you.<eos> Who's got you?<eos> Who's gonna get you?
I'm coming for you.<eos> Bring it on, Master Rhino.<eos> Here I come!<eos> I'm gonna get you.<eos> I am gonna get you!<eos> I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you!<eos> I'm gonna get you.<eos> Who's got you?<eos> Who's gonna get you?<eos> Who's gonna get you?
Here I come!<eos> I'm gonna get you.<eos> I am gonna get you!<eos> I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you!<eos> I'm gonna get you.<eos> Who's got you?<eos> Who's gonna get you?<eos> Who's gonna get you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who's gonna get you?
He will continue stealing the chi of masters until he has consumed it all.<eos> We have to think of a way to stop him!<eos> He'll get more and more powerful with every master he defeats.<eos> There is no choice.<eos> We fight.<eos> I can teach you, son.<eos> You can do this?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm a panda.<eos> That must be why the universe sent you here!
Done, Master.<eos> -Crane, Mantis?<eos> -Still nothing.<eos> Wait.<eos> It's them!<eos> No!<eos> Kai.<eos> Nice.<eos> Very tacky.<eos> How dare you set foot on these grounds!
No.<eos> You must warn Po.<eos> Master, please.<eos> I will show you the true power of chi, brother.<eos> No.<eos> Oogway, forgive me.<eos> What do you say, Oogway?<eos> Do you forgive him?<eos> You may have destroyed the Jade Palace... but you will never succeed.<eos> There will always be someone to stop you.
-"We can learn kung fu"?<eos> -After that!<eos> "We can be just like you"?<eos> -Yes!<eos> -We can?<eos> No!<eos> You can't!<eos> But you don't have to be!<eos> That's what Shifu meant.<eos> I don't have to turn you into me.
-After that!<eos> "We can be just like you"?<eos> -Yes!<eos> -We can?<eos> No!<eos> You can't!<eos> But you don't have to be!<eos> That's what Shifu meant.<eos> I don't have to turn you into me.<eos> I have to turn you into you!
Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> We got them now.<eos> Stop. Stop!<eos> Enough!<eos> Get out...<eos> Let's finish this.<eos> That's our boy!<eos> Sorry, buddy.<eos> Gotta send you back to the Spirit Realm.
Wow!<eos> Po!<eos> You can fly!<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> Dads!<eos> -Son!<eos> -Son!<eos> Don't you go disappearing in petals ever again.<eos> We thought we lost you.
Hello, Decker.<eos> I'm at Chateau Nightclub, on 17 with some of my girl friends.<eos> Are you coming tonight?<eos> I can't wait to see you.
Michael, I didn't know you were working undercover here.<eos> Well, that would be the reason for being undercover is to not tell people you're undercover.<eos> Whatever, just sign the goddamn statement.<eos> Sun is coming up and I'm tired.<eos> What the girl said...<eos> I can't discuss that with you.<eos> I just wanna know if she's backing up my story, you know, if she's sharing the same version that actually happened.<eos> Your version?<eos> Hey, man, no two people remember the same shit the same way.<eos> I can't tell you what the other witness said.
You can smoke, like, in the Louvre.<eos> You can smoke anywhere here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Ronnie had money, too.<eos> A lot of money.<eos> A lot of money, lot of money.<eos> Where do you think he got all that money?<eos> Lieutenant said you used to be a cop back in the States.<eos> Something like that.<eos> Well, then, I shouldn't have to spell it out for you.
Where do you think he got all that money?<eos> Lieutenant said you used to be a cop back in the States.<eos> Something like that.<eos> Well, then, I shouldn't have to spell it out for you.<eos> Yeah, but you see, folks can make a lot of money a lot of different ways.<eos> They can make money pimping hos, they can make money killing people.<eos> They can...<eos> He sold crystal meth.<eos> Or at least worked for the people that did.<eos> And during his hard schedule of selling drugs, he also beat you up, didn't he?
Why'd you stay with him?<eos> He kept me from being bad.<eos> So what do you think you're gonna do now?<eos> I wanna get his car and go home, but the police won't let me have it.<eos> And that's why you're here, because you need a relative like a wife or someone, right?<eos> Could you get it for me?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> His car.<eos> I have a spare set of keys.<eos> What if I give you something?
I knew you were in town, but I didn't know you were coming here.<eos> Surprise.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> I'm to understand Mr. Vargas is concerned about...<eos> Hey, that's my dog!<eos> I understand Mr. Vargas is concerned about...<eos> He wants his money back.<eos> I tried to do everything I can to understand what happened after all these things.<eos> The only thing that matters to Mr. Vargas is results.<eos> Trying... well, it just gets you killed.
Two million, cash.<eos> I hope you're right.<eos> Is that a real badge?<eos> Sure enough it is.<eos> Listen, I spent a long time in the military and a long time in law enforcement.<eos> I can make this happen.<eos> I really can, if you listen to me.<eos> I've got a plan.<eos> You gotta do everything I say.<eos> If you go off the res, you will fuck shit up and get us caught or killed, alright?
I've got a plan.<eos> You gotta do everything I say.<eos> If you go off the res, you will fuck shit up and get us caught or killed, alright?<eos> Even if this shit looks like it's going sideways, it ain't, I promise you.<eos> - Can you do that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> All right.<eos> Now, there's gonna be one cop in the office.<eos> He'll have a manifest for all the impounds as well as the keys.<eos> But I told you, I have a set of keys.
- You know why?<eos> - Why? Because it's about to get dark, and you understand something, sweetheart?<eos> Darkness is our friend.<eos> Oh, yeah, darkness is our friend.<eos> Ronnie had money, too.<eos> A lot of money.<eos> I wanna get his car and go home, but the police won't let me have it.<eos> Could you get it for me?<eos> I'll probably pass on that at the moment.<eos> What if I give you something?
He looks like a cop, she looks like a stripper.<eos> Sorry, but I cannot help you with that.<eos> - See that wall behind you? - Oui.<eos> It will be splattered with your fucking brains if the next words out of your mouth aren't a room number.<eos> 372, third floor.<eos> Third, trois.<eos> Hey!<eos> Put that down.<eos> Put it down.<eos> They don't have enough cops in this city to stop me from killing you.
Well, like I said. I'm just taking him out for a little lunch.<eos> - For lunch, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It was really great to see you.<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> Make sure he comes home safe.<eos> I will.<eos> How far is it?<eos> It's about two blocks.<eos> Where you gonna set up?
- Yeah.<eos> - Give me the money.<eos> I gather Key West is off the table.<eos> That money's mine, and there's not enough to share.<eos> Not with you or anyone else.<eos> I... risked my life for you.<eos> Just on the odd chance you might see there's somebody out there who's not bad, who's not crooked, who's straight up.<eos> I don't really care about money.<eos> I care about honor, and no matter how this goes, at least I showed you that.<eos> The real treasure in life are people who love you, who are willing to die for you.
Don't be an idiot.<eos> You need to be gone and stay gone.<eos> Key West, remember?<eos> I already got you the ticket.<eos> Did you stash the rest of that money back to my place?<eos> I did, it's in a garbage can outside the back door.<eos> How much?<eos> Five hundred thou.<eos> Now we're even, mon ami.<eos> So once again, the real treasures in life are all about the people who love you, that are willing to take a bullet for you.
- I did tell her!<eos> - Uh... Dory.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mr Ray has too many fish to keep an eye on today.<eos> Uh-huh. So it would be best if today you weren't exactly with the class.<eos> Oh. Why not?<eos> Well, you know, you have problems remembering things sometimes.<eos> That's the one thing I can remember.<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay. And sometimes it's not your fault, but it can cause you to wander. And Mr Ray doesn't really have time to worry about fish who wander.
Where'd you grow up, Dory?<eos> Me?<eos> Um, I don't know.<eos> My family.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Did I forget again?<eos> You see, I suffer from--<eos> Short-term memory loss.<eos> How can you remember your family if you have short-term memory loss?
Where are you?<eos> - Dory!<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Dory!<eos> - Ah! Where did you go?<eos> - You were the one to go.<eos> - My parents.<eos> I remembered them.<eos> What?<eos> What did you remember?
I have to get there.<eos> Hmm. That's a hard one, kid.<eos> Unless...<eos> Nah. Never work.<eos> It's too crazy.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I'm okay with crazy.<eos> You know, I could see that?<eos> Well, there's one thing I can think of... to help you get to your family.
Well, there's one thing I can think of... to help you get to your family.<eos> If I just take--<eos> Yes! Great idea.<eos> You take me to find them.<eos> Why didn't I think of that?<eos> Uh, no, no, no.<eos> If I just take your tag... I can take your place on the transport truck then you can go back inside... and find your family. All you have to do is give me the tag.<eos> What tag?<eos> There's a tag on my fin!<eos> How could you forget you have a tag on your fin?
Why didn't I think of that?<eos> Uh, no, no, no.<eos> If I just take your tag... I can take your place on the transport truck then you can go back inside... and find your family. All you have to do is give me the tag.<eos> What tag?<eos> There's a tag on my fin!<eos> How could you forget you have a tag on your fin?<eos> Oh no.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-- I suffer from short-term memory loss.<eos> You don't remember what we were talking about?
All right, that's it!<eos> You have wasted my time!<eos> - Wait. - That transport truck leaves at dawn... and I'm not missing it, so give me your tag.<eos> Wait.<eos> No, I remembered that sign.<eos> - So?<eos> - So I'm remembering more... and more and I feel like my memory's getting better. I think we should--<eos> No!<eos> Your memory is not working.<eos> You can't remember anything.
- Sweetie. Sweetie.<eos> - Oh, watch out, kelpcake.<eos> Oh, watch where you're going.<eos> I'm sorry, Daddy.<eos> I'm sorry I can't remember right.<eos> Oh, sweetie. Sweetie, you don't need to be sorry.<eos> You know what you need to do?<eos> Just keep swimming.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I bet you can remember that because we're just--
Dory would do it.<eos> Nemo, hold on to me. Whoa!<eos> Whoo-hoo! Hey, it's working! Whoa!<eos> Just keep gasping.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> What would Dory do now?<eos> Who's Dory?<eos> Oh boy.<eos> Are we happy to see you.
Bye.<eos> Hi. Do you know anyone who lost a kid a long time ago that would be me?<eos> I don't know how long ago exact-- Okay.<eos> You're in a hurry.<eos> - Ho, ho! Watch where you're going.<eos> - Oh sorry.<eos> It's our goal that every animal we rescue and care for... will eventually return home to where they belong.<eos> Shells.<eos> And there we go.<eos> Now, if you ever get lost, Dory...
- Quarantine.<eos> That's it!<eos> Oh, and I met this septopus, super cranky... but secretly kind of sweet, and he got me into the exhibit...<eos> The exhibit.<eos> Dory?<eos> Do you think my parents will want to see me?<eos> What?<eos> Why wouldn't they want to see you?<eos> Because... I lost them?<eos> Dory, your parents are going to be overjoyed to see you.
Why would you say that?<eos> Because ever since I've met you, you've shown me how to do... stuff I never dreamed of doing.<eos> Crazy things!<eos> Outsmarting sharks and jumping jellyfish.<eos> And finding my son.<eos> You made all that happen.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't know you thought that.<eos> Unless I forgot.<eos> No, you didn't forget.

Help.<eos> Help me. Please.<eos> Somebody help me!<eos> Hey, can- - Help me?<eos> Can you help me?<eos> I've lost them!<eos> - Oh. Lost who?<eos> - I-I-I-I...<eos> Ah, sorry, honey.<eos> I can't help you if you don't remember.
That's right, sweetie. And so we did too.<eos> And we've stayed in this spot for you ever since.<eos> - We thought you might come back.<eos> - We stayed and waited for you.<eos> So every day, we go out and lay out...<eos> Shells.<eos> And you found us.<eos> Oh honey, you found us.<eos> And you know why you found us?<eos> Because you remembered.
But, you know what, Nemo is the sweetest.<eos> He just never gives up on me no matter what.<eos> Um, what would Dory do?<eos> Well, we'll certainly have to thank Marlin and Nemo when we meet them.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait I know this place.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Sigourney Weaver.<eos> - There!<eos> - Won't you please join us?
- I don't know how.<eos> I don't know in what way, but I think this has something to do with--<eos> - Water.<eos> Water.<eos> I need water.<eos> Are you crazy? How'd you get here?<eos> - Dory! - Oh!<eos> - I thought we'd never see you again.<eos> - Aw, me too.<eos> But, darn it, no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't forget you.
-He shows that line all the time but never really hits her.<eos> -Do you know what any of those things do?<eos> That button you just pushed.<eos> What's it do?<eos> -Doesn't matter.<eos> -Ah... I see.<eos> -Ship's gotta run, and I gotta run this ship.<eos> -No, you don't.<eos> Everything here is automated.<eos> What makes you think this ship doesn't fly itself?
-Do you know what any of those things do?<eos> That button you just pushed.<eos> What's it do?<eos> -Doesn't matter.<eos> -Ah... I see.<eos> -Ship's gotta run, and I gotta run this ship.<eos> -No, you don't.<eos> Everything here is automated.<eos> What makes you think this ship doesn't fly itself?<eos> Why would they leave that to you?
Toodles, darling.<eos> -Abe...<eos> Your hat.<eos> -Right.<eos> Bye, honey.<eos> -Abe?<eos> It's Saturday.<eos> You don't have to work.<eos> -Right...<eos> -Seems like the only thing you can remember is breakfast, lunch and dinner.
-Sure.<eos> -Yeah, me, too.<eos> -Something wrong?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -Is it...the bees again?<eos> -No, they're actually thriving.<eos> I just can't sleep.<eos> -I didn't sleep well as a kid.<eos> Military bases are always... awake.<eos> My mother used to tell me to...think of something that makes you really happy.
-It is you.<eos> But you're not dead yet.<eos> That's a good sign.<eos> -Y-yet?<eos> -I'll explain later.<eos> Can you hand me those...those blueprints?<eos> -W-what are you doing?<eos> -Trying to figure something out.<eos> -Get down from there!<eos> -Well, if you hand me the blueprints like I asked you to a moment ago,
194. 1-3-0.<eos> 1-9-4.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Ben Parish.<eos> They called me "Zombie" in quarantine.<eos> Any family not known to be dead?<eos> No.<eos> Sister died in the quakes.<eos> Mom and Dad killed by the virus.<eos> But it didn't kill you, did it?
And that must be Sam.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can't wait to meet him.<eos> -We should probably get moving. -Yeah.<eos> All right, this way.<eos> How do you know without a compass?<eos> Do you have a compass?<eos> No.<eos> You know, I can make one out of a pin and a glass of water.<eos> Didn't peg you for a Girl Scout.
We do not know exactly, Why the cow ...<eos> Welcome to prison, potato!<eos> Potato sits on hot coals!<eos> There is a lot of space in it After the many drilling!<eos> Leave it, Simon!<eos> Take a seat!<eos> Why, potato, why are you here?<eos> What?<eos> Just tell me!<eos> Why were you brought here?
What?<eos> Just tell me!<eos> Why were you brought here?<eos> Wait a moment. These are potatoes on your plate.<eos> Potato eats potatoes!<eos> Is not it funny?<eos> Potato is a cannibal.<eos> It's enough, Simon!<eos> Your parents have thrown you out.<eos> They wanted to get rid of you.
Are you sleeping?<eos> Neither.<eos> And you?<eos> Still not.<eos> Pst Come over!<eos> I have something for you.<eos> For the birthday.<eos> - I had a birthday already.<eos> - Three months ago we did not know each other.<eos> I could not give you anything.
This is the day when you My children.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> - All right, Camille?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I do not know why I cry.<eos> Sometimes one cries, Because one is glad.<eos> Right, Raymond?<eos> Yes,...<eos> Dear Simon, you said the home is for the, Who have no one to love them.<eos> You were wrong. We have not forgotten you.
Thank you for coming.<eos> You should get into his bed tonight.<eos> what?<eos> He looks at me like I'm trash.<eos> We are not people.<eos> We are just the Goulds of Dorchester.<eos> We make the lace for your cursed curtains.<eos> Heaven!<eos> You know that...<eos> Do not you dare touch me.
I have to go and see you-know-who on Saturday.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - That 's the idea.<eos> Come on.<eos> What is the alternative?<eos> You want me to go to the Charles River?<eos> I'm going to meet Statler with him on Saturday.<eos> It excites him to see me when he has the woman next to him.<eos> Then he's going to Detroit for a week.<eos> Do you think you can get on the Statler at 19:00?
- Do not worry.<eos> "I would never have brought you here..."<eos> You think I'm going to be humiliated by a whore?<eos> Came to me And they said that a fool is putting horns on me.<eos> You're lucky you did not cut your tits and toss you into a bin.<eos> Take her to the car, Donnie.<eos> - No!<eos> Joe, I'm sorry!<eos> Albert, do not kill her.<eos> You should be more worried about what I'm going to do to you.

Welcome to Ybor, the Harlem of Tampa.<eos> Cigars built it.<eos> What are you smelling? They are probably cakes or empanadas.<eos> The rest of Tampa leaves Ybor alone.<eos> To them, we are a date of stupid Hispanics and carcamanos And we can do whatever we want if we leave them in peace.<eos> It was to be believed that we all had a good time, But that's not what happened.<eos> The Italians and the Cubans do not give themselves.<eos> But Cubans hate Hispanics And Hispanics find Cubans an arrogant half-breed Who forgot who they were when they were released in 1898.<eos> Cubans and Hispanics despise Puerto Ricans And everyone, even all, shit for the Dominicans.<eos> The Italians only respect you if you came on the boat.
You're a pest.<eos> You, you black whore And your filthy caramanian friends.<eos> I'm going to take over the Parisian.<eos> I do not want 60%.<eos> I want everything.<eos> I'll control all your clubs.<eos> I'll take everything you got.<eos> Maybe I'll even go by your house. And tear that whole black before he cut his throat.<eos> You still did not realize, But you're leaving town, boy.<eos> You just forgot to pack.
Rays.<eos> Shit.<eos> Shit.<eos> Get the car.<eos> It's ok.<eos> - Let's get you to a doctor.<eos> - Rays.<eos> It hurts.<eos> Yes.<eos> It hurts, but it will not kill you.
You do not have to listen hidden.<eos> Ask me anything you want about the deal. And I'll tell you.<eos> It's your business, it's not mine.<eos> But it will be.<eos> I'll tell you everything you want to know.<eos> Yes.<eos> When I came here, I just thought To take revenge and make money.<eos> Now, everything I do, every step I take It is for both of us and to protect our future.<eos> You have to understand that.<eos> But if these steps make you, Little by little, another person, You will cease to be you.
But he did not listen to me.<eos> And then?<eos> I gave him a shot.<eos> We fell into the water and I swam to the shore.<eos> I ran to the nearest house.<eos> He was a fisherman.<eos> He did not care to welcome me.<eos> Did not you want to contact me?<eos> If he showed up, they would kill me.<eos> I owed you nothing.
David!<eos> David!<eos> David!<eos> David!<eos> Let me out of here!<eos> David!<eos> David! Please let me out!<eos> David!<eos> David, please!<eos> He doesn't want you here.
Yeah, I believe you.<eos> I can cancel this trip in the city.<eos> It's just two days.<eos> Finalize the sale of the company, help with the transition.<eos> - I can reschedule.<eos> - No. No, I don't want you to do that.<eos> Lucas and I can spend the time together.<eos> That'll be good for us.<eos> I want you to keep an eye on your mother for me while I'm gone. Look after her.<eos> You want me to pick up some Juniors for you while I'm gone?
- Is that right?<eos> - That's right.<eos> And he didn't like leaving me with babysitters, so, I've spent a lot of time on-site, and a lot of time around young men like you.<eos> So then you're used to seeing people smoke on the job site.<eos> When did you start working for your daddy?<eos> - When I was old enough.<eos> - Doing what?<eos> Whatever he'd let me do.<eos> He must have been proud. Of?<eos> Of you, getting a degree, becoming an architect.
Like I could tell you, Tom... got tighty whities on, right?<eos> But in the process, you exposed your key informant, Fatima Hamza.<eos> Two years building her trust, infiltrating the terror network, wasted.<eos> - It was a calculated risk.<eos> - Really?<eos> Because your Baghdad CO describes you as reckless, insubordinate and irresponsible toward human assets.<eos> You recognise that description?<eos> No, but I recognise an asshole when I see one.<eos> Tom, a minute.<eos> I stuck my neck out trying to get you this position.
Briar, this is out of control.<eos> I have to give this to French Intelligence, OK?<eos> Yeah, who are you gonna talk to?<eos> Victor Gamieux.<eos> He was my contact back in Libya.<eos> He's OK.<eos> And what about my assets?<eos> - He's gonna want us to turn them over.<eos> - A pick-pocket and a bomb mule?<eos> What do you care?
I will not take my eyes off it.<eos> You watch the car, Blake.<eos> Stop talking to me, go talk to her!<eos> Eugene, did you get that?<eos> - Yes, I got it all.<eos> Drink, drink, drink, drink!<eos> Oh, my God, high school parties.<eos> I can't wait for spring break.<eos> It's gonna be so cool.<eos> Please. To do anything fun, you have to get out of United States of Can't Do Anything.
It's still early, no?<eos> Nice, this is a great Fredde Le Grand track. It's really good.<eos> You're really into music.<eos> You a DJ, or what?<eos> I am, inside my own room.<eos> Outside, not so much.<eos> Well, I know the DJ here. Would you like to try it?<eos> No, no, thank you.<eos> Why not?<eos> I want to hear what you can do.
Wha...<eos> Where are you going, lover boy?<eos> Jesus. Oh, my God, it's huge!<eos> I gotta go.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> Right after I get some therapy.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Sorry, I must have fallen asleep. I, uh, where are we?<eos> A motel.<eos> Do you remember?
- Her.<eos> - Her name's Gaby.<eos> - Beautiful girl, yeah.<eos> She's pretty. She's also a thief.<eos> - I find her.<eos> - What? - I find her.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Chuy knows everyone! - See?<eos> I told you.
I know a way you could get it in 20 minutes.<eos> But it may offend your delicate American ways.<eos> Delicate?<eos> Bro, I'm in!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I can't watch this, man, this is brutal.<eos> I know dude, but it's our last chance to get the watch back.<eos> It's either them, or you.<eos> Fuck. We haven't won once.<eos> Don't worry. You bet the same color five times in a row, next one guaranteed winner.
Let's toast to a new beginning!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Oh, fuck. Fuck.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I think you need to close the door.<eos> - Where is it? - I got it, I got it.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Panic?<eos> - You're a fucking asshole. What happened to new beginnings and all that bullshit?
When we get back, we'll find out where Dorian lives, and then we'll wait til he's asleep and we'll steal the watch back.<eos> I'm being serious dude, why not?<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop helping!<eos> You know, none of this would ever have happened if you just manned up with Lina in the first place.<eos> What?<eos> None of this would have happened if I manned up?<eos> How about none of this would have happened if you weren't such a selfish douchebag?<eos> Selfish?<eos> Dude, I did all of this just so you could get with Lina!
What?<eos> What the fuck is going on here?<eos> What is this?<eos> Sammy, Sammy! Come here!<eos> Go and get him, go!<eos> Fucking pair of idiots.<eos> Okay, so maybe... I'm all done.<eos> Gaby, come with me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You owe me, right?
Okay, so maybe... I'm all done.<eos> Gaby, come with me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You owe me, right?<eos> And I will pay you, but my way, not yours.<eos> And how are you fucking going to do it?<eos> By working double shifts in the fucking hotel for four dollars and hour plus tips?<eos> You will never make enough money.<eos> You will be always in my debt. Forever.<eos> How much does she owe you?
Ooh, ouch, that hurt.<eos> C'mon, I'll help ya.<eos> I need help, I'm stuck.<eos> I know, and I'm going to lift you.<eos> Light as a feather.<eos> Thank you, bring them up here. Bring them on up, thank you.<eos> - Hey, Logan, what's with the door?<eos> I don't know, it was working fine for me.<eos> - I'm gonna check the garage.<eos> - Nice to see you, too, Dad.
I noticed you're not wearing my watch.<eos> You didn't scratch it, did ya?<eos> No, I didn't scratch it.<eos> Tell me you didn't scratch my watch.<eos> - I didn't scratch your watch.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> - I lost it.<eos> - You lost it?<eos> You lost the Rolex?<eos> Yes, and I'm gonna do whatever I can to make it up to you.
You lost the replacement.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Feels like shit, doesn't it?<eos> It feels like shit.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> A year abroad, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What's her name? - Whose name?<eos> The girl you're in love with.
Stand or fall, you said.<eos> You'd never leave my side, you said.<eos> You swore it.<eos> And then you fled.<eos> I see you fight, and I see you run.<eos> No, Sara.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> I saw Tull kill you.<eos> I saw him kill you, with my own eyes.<eos> I would never leave you.
I saw him kill you, with my own eyes.<eos> I would never leave you.<eos> But I saw you leave me, with my own eyes.<eos> And you, of all people, should know Tull could never kill me.<eos> Sara.<eos> Don't.<eos> I swear to you.<eos> She put me in her dungeon.<eos> For seven years.<eos> And when I finally escaped, I swore I'd find you.
That looks familiar.<eos> Dwarf-made trap.<eos> It's where I would've put it.<eos> Yes, it'll take more than that to catch the likes of...<eos> No! No!<eos> Silly mope.<eos> What?<eos> This was unexpected.<eos> Oh, what? The hidden dwarf trap was unexpected?<eos> You're not the tracker you think you are.
You know what this is?<eos> It's a great big bloody diamond.<eos> I'm not blind.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> You let us down, and I'll tell you.<eos> Doreena!<eos> Coming, Mrs. Bromwyn!<eos> Keep an eye on this lot.<eos> Shoot the he-dwarves if they get mouthy.<eos> Or if you just feel like it.
Flint and steel.<eos> Their blood smells like tar.<eos> You see?<eos> It is gold.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Goblins ain't real, eh?<eos> Look.<eos> Do your best to stay dry.<eos> This is bonkers.<eos> Praise the bridge that carries you over.
If you're looking for gratitude, you have it.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> What exactly am I supposed to do?<eos> You think it's about you.<eos> No.<eos> What you should choose.<eos> What you should do.<eos> That I'm just waiting here for the man to pass a test.<eos> And you did.<eos> So now I have to love you.
Dwarves.<eos> They're just like children.<eos> We're mighty far from children, Bitch Queen.<eos> Adorable.<eos> Bring me the Mirror.<eos> You'll have to kill me first!<eos> No, I won't.<eos> Doreena, no!<eos> You knew, didn't you?<eos> You knew she'd betray you and you spared her still.
You two, come with me.<eos> Did you have to hit him so hard?<eos> Shut up.<eos> He's very heavy.<eos> Right.<eos> We stuff him in here, we cover our tracks.<eos> That's very sloppy work, that is.<eos> This is the worst plan ever.<eos> Stop.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?
I do.<eos> Then what is your judgment?<eos> Death.<eos> Traitors!<eos> Traitors to who?<eos> Your old queen?<eos> Your new queen?<eos> You broke the law.<eos> The law?<eos> Have you forgotten the ones who loved you?
Stand back.<eos> Nothing can save you, Huntsman.<eos> All that's left is pain!<eos> Ravenna, stop.<eos> Stop!<eos> Enough!<eos> We can't leave the Mirror.<eos> Then we climb.<eos> I thought I had driven the weakness out of you.<eos> I thought I made you strong.
We can't leave the Mirror.<eos> Then we climb.<eos> I thought I had driven the weakness out of you.<eos> I thought I made you strong.<eos> But you're as pathetic as you ever were.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> How did you make me strong?<eos> How did you draw the weakness out?<eos> What did you do? What did you do?<eos> I don't have to tell you anything.
- put this behind us.<eos> - It's all fine.<eos> I wouldn't be doing my job if we didn't go over a couple of exercises.<eos> So, grab a stress ball.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay, so, Margaret's gonna show us... the meaning of trust.<eos> - Hey, Sanjay? - Yeah?<eos> Did I tell you that I ate at a Indian restaurant the other night?<eos> Yeah, I had to call and make an Indian reservation.<eos> Yang, tell Oren how he makes you feel.
Jeff had mentioned something about urinals.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, the customer's always right.<eos> But, yeah, they are my drawings.<eos> Customer's always right. Except when they're not.<eos> - The bathroom's that way, Tim.<eos> - No, thank you, I'm fine.<eos> That was one of the best Junetoberfests we have ever, ever had.<eos> Have you ever seen a couple move into a neighborhood so nicely as the Joneses?<eos> You don't you think there's something off about them?
Do you and Jeff have a thing?<eos> Yes, Jeff and I have a thing.<eos> We do it really fast in case the kids come running into our room.<eos> Sounds like you're very sexual people.<eos> - But your kids are gone, aren't they?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Time for something new.<eos> Is that why you're buying lingerie?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let's see what you decided on.
Listen.<eos> It is impressive how people open up to you.<eos> - They tell you a lot.<eos> - They do.<eos> It sounds like they complain a lot, but... Gosh!<eos> It comes with the territory.<eos> I'm fine with it.<eos> But, yes.<eos> Let me ask you this.<eos> Does anybody ever say to you in confidence how much they hate the company?
- Who?<eos> - Tim Jones. Look at that.<eos> Why are you wearing a robe?<eos> Are you sick? Nice.<eos> Honey, I'm just thinking.<eos> What am I really doing this summer?<eos> I mean, I sent the kids away to camp, I'm redesigning bathrooms.<eos> Is that what makes me happy?<eos> Is that what makes me, Karen Gaffney, complete?<eos> Okay, well, listen, if you wanna feel complete, there's some exercises I do at work with the guys...
It's okay.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You know what, honey?<eos> We need to go back to our lovemaking.<eos> - Where were we?<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> - It's so hot!<eos> It's so hot! - Yeah.<eos> Okay, I...<eos> Should I grope you?
You're right.<eos> We need more evidence.<eos> - And it's a jalapeño.<eos> - Karen. Karen!<eos> Karen!<eos> Karen, look.<eos> I know that you miss Mikey and Patrick, but parents weekend is not for two weeks.<eos> Get down!<eos> Parents weekend isn't for two weeks.<eos> Maybe we can do some breathing exercises to center you.
- No. Can you turn the air conditioner on, please?<eos> - It's not going on!<eos> - It's hot.<eos> My seat belt's not on!<eos> Wait!<eos> Okay, it's about to get weird.<eos> About to get weird?<eos> Quick question.<eos> Are you guys the good guys or bad guys?<eos> What do you think?
It's a legitimate thing.<eos> It's actually appropriate to give somebody a gift.<eos> What isn't appropriate, however, is what you happened to wear at the yard party.<eos> Now you want me to dress like some kind of a sexless - elementary school nurse...<eos> - Come on.<eos> I'm not talking just to fit in with the other mothers, right?<eos> - No offense, Karen.<eos> - You look great!<eos> You look amazing.<eos> But you have to fit in.
What do we do now?<eos> Yeah, what do we do now?<eos> Just stick to your routine.<eos> And nobody finds out about any of this, okay?<eos> I won't tell anybody.<eos> Yeah, keep it quiet.<eos> There's this other thing I needed to ask.<eos> I know you guys are undercover and this whole thing is a setup, but...<eos> The other day at the Cobra Club, was that about getting me drunk and having me betray my co-workers or was that about two guys, you know, maybe starting a friendship?<eos> It was about getting you drunk and betraying your co-workers.
- Long story.<eos> But we can't really get into it right now.<eos> But, it's good to see you!<eos> Jeff, do me a big favor?<eos> Will you just... - scoot a little bit to your right?<eos> - Yeah. Sure thing.<eos> Thank you!<eos> I am blown away, you guys.<eos> This is un...<eos> Jeff, I don't want you to turn around right now, but there are four guys in fezzes behind you on the...
Don't you think?<eos> Honey. We blew their cover again.<eos> - No!<eos> No. - What?<eos> - We should feed the baby?<eos> - I think we should feed the baby.<eos> - If you can just pass me the bottle...<eos> - Can you hold this bag for me?<eos> - Do you mind holding the baby?<eos> Before you freak out, it's just a baby.
No. - What?<eos> - We should feed the baby?<eos> - I think we should feed the baby.<eos> - If you can just pass me the bottle...<eos> - Can you hold this bag for me?<eos> - Do you mind holding the baby?<eos> Before you freak out, it's just a baby.<eos> - All right? Don't worry.<eos> - Kids are great! I have pictures.<eos> - Karen, how do you get...
Kind of see what I'm dealing with.<eos> Okay.<eos> I see now.<eos> Okay?<eos> See what that is?<eos> - It's okay, honey.<eos> - I need you to breathe.<eos> - You can do it.<eos> - You've done this before.<eos> On three, I want you to get down, and take cover. Okay? One...
That's nice.<eos> That's fine, thank...<eos> You.<eos> A shame I've come too late.<eos> But here I am, sober and clothed. Don't tell anyone.<eos> I have a bad reputation to keep.<eos> Come here. Come.<eos> No. No, no. No, no!<eos> Hard to believe, but you look like a king.<eos> If that's what excites you, who am I to judge?
To remind you of the demons I slayed for you.<eos> A more valuable treasure Egypt has never known.<eos> This old thing?<eos> How can the Goddess of Love not know what love is?<eos> It's not bedding any girl who flutters her eyelashes, mighty lion-slayer.<eos> I was celebrating the hunt.<eos> You would know that had you been here.<eos> I value my freedom.<eos> Dead animals less so.<eos> Well, you have no problem wearing them.
- No, I wouldn't miss it.<eos> - For you.<eos> A hunting horn.<eos> From the skull of a ram that flattened 10 gods slower than me.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Try it out.<eos> From Set.<eos> Come on!<eos> Let Ra himself hear you.
- For you.<eos> A hunting horn.<eos> From the skull of a ram that flattened 10 gods slower than me.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Try it out.<eos> From Set.<eos> Come on!<eos> Let Ra himself hear you.<eos> I think someone heard you.
- Father, don't.<eos> - Stay out of this, son.<eos> Why?<eos> In 1,000 years of peace, what have you accomplished?<eos> A land of people who dream of nothing more.<eos> - It's my turn now.<eos> - I won't fight.<eos> I love you, brother.<eos> With all my heart.<eos> I love you, too, brother.
It is my burden to fight the demon Apophis night after night.<eos> Egypt must never be destroyed by Chaos.<eos> So, you see, there are things worse than Set.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> That demon isn't the one who murdered my father.<eos> - Murdered your son.<eos> - They are both my sons.<eos> They were both equal in my eyes. As is all of my creation.<eos> And the uncertainty of its destiny is my will.<eos> So what is it actually that brings you here?
I can make any man, woman, god or beast do my bidding.<eos> Unless their heart belongs to another.<eos> You're in love.<eos> Her name's...<eos> Zaya.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I promised her a proper home.<eos> Money for a family. Respectability.<eos> I gave her nothing.<eos> Oh, she wouldn't have been with you if she didn't love you.
He deserves to know the truth.<eos> I need him to get us in to choke Set's fire.<eos> If he refuses, we'll all die.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> It's too dangerous to cross the plain.<eos> - We'll wait for darkness.<eos> - But we're running out of time.<eos> - I say we cross now.<eos> - And I say we wait.<eos> All the time you were apart, she never forgot you.
How else would a blind, useless god get you to help him?<eos> Go on.<eos> Ask him.<eos> - Pour it in.<eos> - Is it true?<eos> Bek, pour it in!<eos> No!<eos> Shame you weren't on my side.<eos> I admire someone that doesn't let death stand in his way.<eos> But this is what love gets you.
Who picked the wrong god now?<eos> I think I may actually miss our little get-togethers.<eos> But you're still no match for me.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm just the bait.<eos> Now you're just becoming a pest.<eos> Horus!<eos> You don't think your eye might have been more useful than a wounded thief?<eos> Probably, yes.<eos> I'm sorry for everything I've done to you.
- Matthew!<eos> - ...shall get their $20.<eos> Get off him!<eos> Those of you who do not, may your good Lord help you.<eos> I'll help you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> The Lord's watching.<eos> What kind of man are you?<eos> What'd these people ever do to you?
How 'bout we take him over into that mine there?<eos> This is as good a place as any.<eos> Into the mine, Faraday.<eos> If you're gonna kill me, kill me.<eos> If you're gonna rob me, rob me.<eos> But I will not go in that mine.<eos> There's rats in there.<eos> Virginia City?<eos> Three days past?<eos> Best you remember who'd you cheat out of $50 in a card game!
- Well, look at that.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Nothing to be scared of! Let's go!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Is he dead?<eos> Come on. Get away.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Come on, don't be afraid.<eos> I have assembled these men and offered fair pay.<eos> Who picked you to deal on our behalf?
Bogue will come from the south.<eos> Now, he'll prefer high ground, but we'll try to lure him into town, turn it into a shooting gallery.<eos> Now, if we can create enough confusion, maybe we can get them to break ranks.<eos> That's a lotta open space here, Sam.<eos> I don't really see a way to keep 'em out.<eos> We're not.<eos> We're gonna let 'em in.<eos> Yes, yes, we force 'em down through here, leave this open here, make this into a graveyard.<eos> Goodnight, you're our best shot with a rifle.<eos> You find high ground that gives you a clear line of sight, you keep Bogue in your sights once the chaos starts.
We got them agitated, didn't we?<eos> You ride with God today.<eos> You know I ain't got no religion.<eos> Do you not fear the eternal hell that awaits you?
Marisol, I'll go where they send me.<eos> It's not as if I've been chasing this man my entire life.<eos> I can ride as well as you.<eos> You taught me to track...<eos> It's crazy talk.<eos> We should change the subject.<eos> You're gone more than you're ever here.<eos> What happened to the Tompkins woman, only a month ago, was south of Austin.<eos> And not just some rogue straggler we've somehow missed, but a band of Cheyenne and Comanchero.<eos> Would you like me to describe to you exactly what they did to that poor woman?
Would you like me to describe to you exactly what they did to that poor woman?<eos> This is coming from the governor himself.<eos> At least here, we both know you're safe.<eos> Since you took me, you come and you go.<eos> I'm left here with nothing to do.<eos> There's the Sheltons.<eos> Donahues are less than a mile.<eos> Marisol, this is a job.<eos> It's my work.<eos> You can't expect me to put you in that kind of danger.
- But why on earth?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> But I thought about it.<eos> Really, it's the ideal cover until I can figure out what's going on here.<eos> He frightens me, David.<eos> He's a man, Marisol, not a crystal gazer.<eos> - No one knew we were coming.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> These people, they're just a bit off the reservation.<eos> Make sure you remember that.
He frightens me, David.<eos> He's a man, Marisol, not a crystal gazer.<eos> - No one knew we were coming.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> These people, they're just a bit off the reservation.<eos> Make sure you remember that.<eos> Stop it.<eos> - Get away from me.<eos> - Now, now, wait.<eos> Don't you walk away. Come on.

Come on.<eos> Don't you walk away from me. Where are you going?
We deserve it for all we've done.<eos> Futile to toil over such things.<eos> Forces you to look inward and examine the monster you truly are.<eos> Don't go exempting yourself.<eos> You'll answer the same as everyone else.<eos> David, I was never born nor will I ever truly die.<eos> Aw, you'll die, all right.<eos> You'll die right here.<eos> Your leg will swell.<eos> You'll scream and try to kill yourself to save the pain.
Go and finish packing.<eos> Madam, I am too old for this familiarity and listening to your orders!<eos> Oooh, If only your father heard you!<eos> - He is dead.<eos> Can't get to him.<eos> - What?<eos> I made his last years beautiful!<eos> You're obliged to respect me!<eos> Not the best moment, ma'am.<eos> Thank me that I will transport you to Austria, on my own expenses, dammit!
Forget Paris!<eos> And the palace is mine since father's death, I'm the oldest.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> As a member you voted to cancel the rule of the oldest.<eos> So my children have an equal right to inheritance of Montmirail just like you!<eos> Don't let it embarrass your political career!<eos> Don't be so unfair to your brother.<eos> I respect you like your deceased mother.<eos> It is an honor for me to save you and your siblings.<eos> - And do not forget Elise, who loves you dearly.
- Yes.<eos> We shall not work like townspeople!<eos> - I'm going.<eos> Elise!<eos> Give it to me. Everything will be spilled.<eos> Get out!<eos> I'm going to get my mummy's portrait!<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> - You do not have to worry.
- It will not happen again.<eos> The killed Marat!<eos> What is this noise?<eos> Someone got arrested?<eos> No, your family is here.<eos> And with them problems.<eos> Drink, I am thirsty.<eos> - Who is it?<eos> It did not break.<eos> - Cousin Kurt, with whom you are to connect.
The world is made in France, not in America, in palaces that stink of mould.<eos> We risk a fall in front of the Germans.<eos> I'm not a coward.<eos> I chose the revolution.<eos> It's the future.<eos> Even for the family.<eos> I disagree, Gonzague.<eos> In the city, there is no future.<eos> When you lose your land, you lose your soul.<eos> Have your region prosper even with beggars who love you. Like my Jacquouille.
That's enough!<eos> - We don't want him here!<eos> What is that idiot doing?<eos> Pissing?<eos> Do not be afraid, I am servant of cousin Kurt Houb.<eos> My court is not a toilet.<eos> We observe hygiene.<eos> We pee on the street.<eos> I had to go urgently.<eos> - Won't they let you into the latrine?
Their lackey damaged Philibert's back.<eos> Insist on a payment for it, medication is expensive.<eos> - Yes. We get on just so so, Charlotte.<eos> Do you want help?<eos> - No.<eos> Everyone has to carry his load.<eos> It is a privilege to have a full suitcase.<eos> Alarm!<eos> Saracens attack! - What are you doing here?<eos> Do you know soldiers looking for you?
- What will happen here, Papa?<eos> - We'll be all right, girl.<eos> - This Magua led us in to it.<eos> Eighteen killed.<eos> These men came to our aid.<eos> They guided us here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> - Help our selves to a few horns from your powder stores.<eos> - Some food. Indebted to you.
There was no reflection.<eos> My body, clothes, everything was gone.<eos> I was invisible.<eos> I see it too.<eos> Throw some light up there.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, help me!<eos> help!<eos> help!<eos> What's the matter with you?
You just said everything was fine.<eos> Do you think I can relax and enjoy the weekend when he has a temperature?<eos> Why don't you wait till tomorrow morning and then ring again?<eos> Well, it's obvious you don't have children.<eos> - Mary!<eos> - Well, that was unnecessary.<eos> None of us can possibly imagine what you've been through.<eos> And your over-reaction is understandable.<eos> But it is an over-reaction.<eos> We haven't seen you so long, and we'd just like to spend a bit of time with you.
Not after he's seen everybody.<eos> I never even seen you guys.<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> - You should never have taken him out of the trunk.<eos> We wanted to know what he knew about the set up!<eos> - There is no set up!<eos> Here's the news:<eos> Blondie, you stay here and take care of these two.<eos> White and Pink, come with me!<eos> Because if Joe sees all the cars, I swear to you, he's going to be mad at me as well!
Five guys are sitting in a bullpen in San Quentin, wondering how they got there.<eos> "What did we do wrong?<eos> What should we have done?<eos> It's your fault!"<eos> All that bullshit.<eos> Then one of them has an idea:<eos> "Wait a minute!<eos> While we were planning this caper, all we did was sit around and tell jokes!"<eos> Got the message?<eos> I was never meaning to holler at you.
- I see.<eos> - It's impossible.<eos> - It's ironic.<eos> - It's a fucking tragedy, is what it is, ned.<eos> - Listen, i got to go.<eos> - So soon?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Will you be coming back?<eos> That's hard to say.<eos> Let me come with you!
This is not a test.<eos> The penetration is live. The target is unaware.<eos> Sneaking a foreign intelligence service that might kill us to keep us out is not what we do.<eos> The probable level of security is very low. But if you guys don't want to take that chance just to keep me out of jail... Fine.<eos> I understand. Don't do it.<eos> Well, Bish, I can't speak for the other guys, but I'm in it for the money.<eos> I don't care if you go to jail. Me neither.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Could we maybe just go back to the "they might kill us" part?<eos> If I thought that was likely to happen, I wouldn't bring this to you. But there is a risk.
What?<eos> There isn't a government on this planet that wouldn't kill us all for that thing.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I see.<eos> Hit the alarm.<eos> Mother, lock everything down. Then kill the lights.<eos> Whistler, unplug that thing.<eos> You bet.<eos> Thank you for the trust, fellows.<eos> I really enjoyed sleeping with all you guys.
You the police?<eos> We look like the police to you, bitch?<eos> We Deuces, baby.<eos> You bad boys kill anybody?<eos> Shit, you know we down for that 1-8-7, baby.<eos> Why?<eos> You want somebody killed?<eos> Man, shut up!<eos> Drive off, Ken Dog.<eos> Take me with you.
Come on, pick it up.<eos> Have a taste of this!<eos> All right, you men!<eos> You've got something to look forward to when you get back to the castle!<eos> Lord Arthur approaches!<eos> Raise the portcullis!<eos> Lord Arthur!<eos> Lord Arthur approaches!<eos> Lord Arthur, where is my brother?<eos> Did he not ride with you?
Magnets. You move one...<eos> - You can pull it out of us?<eos> - Yeah... in theory.<eos> But I might just give the cell a coat of red paint.<eos> - Let's find out.<eos> - You mean right now?<eos> - Have you got a better time?<eos> - No... If you explode, what happens to the rest of us.<eos> Try me.<eos> - I'm going with you.
It's stuck.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Okay... my turn.<eos> Somebody take notes, man.<eos> I can't do it to myself.<eos> I'll do it to you...<eos> after you do it to me.<eos> - What about your parole?<eos> - Bullshit! It's time I woke up.<eos> I'm going with you.
I said right!<eos> You say "right" and point left.<eos> - So what?<eos> You don't know right from left. You drive yourself.<eos> I haven't got a license.<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> Put the blade away, Brjansi.<eos> - You're going to die.<eos> Moli really likes you guys.<eos> He's talking about setting up a mafia ring with you.
But surely it was the dart that killed the poor woman.<eos> Hasn't that been established? - Almost certainly, yes, mademoiselle.<eos> - Then why--<eos> - Mademoiselle Grey, when was the last time you saw to be alive Madame Giselle?<eos> - Well, I suppose when I collected up the plates after the meal.<eos> - Yes, she was alive when I poured her coffee.<eos> A few minutes later that would be.<eos> - Merci.<eos> Just one more question.<eos> Madame Giselle, had she ever flown with you before? - I'd never seen her.
The bomb was an M60 in the trash can.<eos> Just loud enough to make a diversion.<eos> It worked.<eos> I haven't found anybody who saw the actual shooting.<eos> The suspect's described as tall, short, fat, thin, dark hair, blonde hair.<eos> One thing everybody agrees on:<eos> White, white, very white.<eos> Tells you something.<eos> Yeah, summer's here.<eos> We wanted to coordinate with you before we released any information.
- I know why you're doing this.<eos> - Going down.<eos> You're trying to make me feel guilty, to shame me into doing the honourable thing.<eos> - Why, then?<eos> - Our number's up here.<eos> I want to set the record straight.<eos> It's not easy saying this one man to another, but... I love you, man.<eos> I really, really love you.<eos> - Going up. - It might be a good idea if we try and get into a kind of a four-way hug situation.<eos> - What's wrong with you?
- I'm calling you one if you are.<eos> - Are you?<eos> - Get your finger out of my face.<eos> - Get yours out.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> Get out! Out!<eos> Out! Out!<eos> Hey, hey, hey! Come on, stop it!<eos> Come on. Break it up!<eos> What's the matter with you?
I said, "Get out of here.<eos> No story?<eos> Is that what I said?"<eos> Well, I informed him that he was exceeding the speed limit and that's when he told me that he was racing home because his friend was about to commit suicide.<eos> And then what happened?<eos> He became very loud and hysterical.<eos> He was flailing his arms about as he told the story and then he threw himself on the ground and he grabbed me around the legs and he begged me to let him go.<eos> And when I refused that's when he began to scream, "My friend's going to die.<eos> My friend's going to die. "<eos> I don't know how you guys feel, but we would like to be in business with you.
- Voy a matar a usted.<eos> - Wha?<eos> That's Spanish for "I am going to kill you."<eos> - Say what?<eos> - I do believe it's time... for your beloved MacGyver.<eos> - Oh, hey, you're right.<eos> - Well, time for my walk. - Mm.<eos> Don't forget to die.<eos> I was feeling kind of lonely without Selma.<eos> Mind if I watch TVwith you?
He's afraid of being sent back to Mexico.<eos> Tell him to go right now.<eos> We cannot leave this room.<eos> We can only leave if the sergeant tells us to.<eos> Wait a moment.<eos> Were there five of you?<eos> One hasn't arrived yet.<eos> One hasn't arrived yet.<eos> Really?<eos> Let me share a little secret with all of you.
- Dude, we gotta ditch this guy. - Definitely.<eos> But how?<eos> Melvin.<eos> Excuse us, dude but your shoes are untied.<eos> I can't believe we just melvined Death.<eos> Let's hope he doesn't catch up with us.<eos> No way!<eos> This isn't funny.<eos> Way to go, Joanna!<eos> I don't understand what's come over you two.
-My God.<eos> I thought I was dreaming some nonsense.<eos> No one answered when I knocked but I knew you wouldn't be far off.<eos> This here is Thorgeir, you must remember him from the old days.<eos> I hardly believe I'm awake.<eos> Let's have some coffee.<eos> I think it's real brave of you going west just like that.<eos> It has been a dream of mine a long time and people should make their dreams come true, no matter how old they are.<eos> You are like a pair of youngsters on a camping trip.<eos> I wish I could join you.
I used to think a wedding was a simple affair.<eos> Boy and girl meet, they fall in love. He buys a ring, she buys a dress, they say, "I do."<eos> I was wrong.<eos> That's getting married.<eos> A wedding is an entirely different proposition.<eos> I know. I've just been through one.<eos> Not my own, my daughter's.<eos> Annie Banks MacKenzie.<eos> That's her married name.<eos> MacKenzie. -I'll be honest with you.
She'll be back later.<eos> She's gonna do more later.<eos> Lighten up.<eos> Now back off here a little bit.<eos> I got a special treat for you guys.<eos> I'm gonna tell you now.<eos> You know your captain Danny Leonard?<eos> Hell of a man, hell of a man.<eos> His mother...<eos> His mother flew 12,000 miles to be with him and to be with you.
Tennyson wrote:<eos> "Authority forgets a dying king. "<eos> This was never more true than for John F.

We're partying, baby.<eos> Joycie, turn the radio on.<eos> - You broke it.<eos> - I didn't break the radio.<eos> I was showing you it wasn't fixed.<eos> I'll just have to sing.<eos> Everybody was kung fu fighting<eos> It was a little bit frightening<eos> Those kids have expert timing<eos> So James actually did go with you?
They stick mostly to certain breaks.<eos> If we can get some hair samples and get a match at a certain beach... we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf.<eos> You buyin' this?<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> But let's do it anyway.<eos> It will bug the shit out of Harp.<eos> - My man. - Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> When you two are done making out, I need to talk to you.
Guard it with your life!<eos> Bring the Bishop to my chapel!<eos> Is she worth it?<eos> Worth dying for?<eos> He cleared it!<eos> We're doomed.<eos> 'Tis rebellion!<eos> We must escape!<eos> -Marry us!<eos> I will never marry you!
Charlie.<eos> Forgive me, Charlie.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Did you think I was stealing the scene?<eos> Don't talk.<eos> Don't even move.<eos> Get my car and driver.<eos> Get him to The Queen of Angels.<eos> Gladys, ride with him.<eos> I'll have my personal physician meet you.
- It's at number seven already.<eos> I think it'll go to number one.<eos> That's marvelous.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> I may call you tomorrow to see if it's improved.<eos> - It's on every front page today. - Fine.<eos> - They're doing marvelous here.<eos> - Thanks very much indeed.<eos> Yeah, baby.<eos> I'm with you all the way.
- Yeah, no question.<eos> But that's not from her album.<eos> What is this?<eos> Coming through.<eos> That's Dave Buell.<eos> Where'd you find him?<eos> Vacant alley near Feather and Grants.<eos> He was strangled.<eos> Like Linda.<eos> Wait up, guys, I want to go with you.
Vinnie, I'm ready.<eos> Well, honey, we're finally alone.<eos> I know what would take your mind off that record for a minute.<eos> You can make love to me four times.<eos> Peg, when I said I was after an oldie, I meant, but a goody.<eos> There must be someone around here old enough to know that song.<eos> - Hi, Peggy.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Jefferson and I were thinking of going to the movie.<eos> Well, I don't think we can go with you.
- Are you busy?<eos> - No. Come on up.<eos> Can you believe somebody threw this out?<eos> I'm gonna make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.<eos> Well, wouldn't it be invisible?<eos> I mean, what, are you gonna just sense it's in front of the couch?<eos> Well...<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> What's with you two?
Assault. Manslaughter. Stealing cable TV!<eos> Marge!<eos> Lisa!<eos> Maggie!<eos> Shake hands.<eos> Keep it clean.<eos> Come on, boy!<eos> Excuse me. I hate to interrupt your judging me. I've made a couple of important decisions.<eos> Number one: I'm cutting the cable when the fight's over.<eos> Number two: I'm not very fond of any of you.
Because we knew you'd be too cheap to buy one for yourself.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -That's right.<eos> Well, shit.<eos> Now I guess I'm supposed to--<eos> What?<eos> Tell everybody what I think about them?<eos> Yeah!<eos> You're the best.<eos> It's been an honor to serve with you.
Don´t shoot!<eos> I don´t think it´s loaded, kid.<eos> Danny, what are you doing here?<eos> - Hey, where´d he come from?<eos> - Beats me.<eos> I ran away from home.<eos> Your father´s going to have kittens.<eos> Does this thing work?<eos> Please don´t call.<eos> Just let me stay here the night with you.
Just because your dad likes something, doesn't mean you have to like it.<eos> He likes being a lawyer.<eos> You don't have to be a lawyer.<eos> I am going to be a lawyer.<eos> Ash, the world does not need another Philip Banks.<eos> We might not have enough farmland to support the one we have.<eos> No, the world needs an Ashley Banks.<eos> Girls, you must remember to practice more, no?<eos> Violin is very jealous, much like the sexy Toscanini.<eos> If you even look at another, it will not speak to you for days.
Because we're giving him the weekend off.<eos> You mean I'm going to have to get my own breakfast, too?<eos> Am I being punished for something?<eos> I was just asking myself that same question.<eos> But, Dad, I'm only nine.<eos> Can't Hilary take care of herself?<eos> Hi, Hilary.<eos> Ashley, you be a good girl while we're in Palm Springs.<eos> Well, I'm in a bad mood, and somebody is going to suffer.<eos> Please take me with you.
- There's my problem!<eos> I can't tell the Continuum you committed a selfless act.<eos> There'd be questions and explanations for centuries.<eos> - I've learned my lesson.<eos> - Remember who you're talking to.<eos> All-knowing, all-seeing.<eos> Fine, you got your powers back.<eos> Try and stay out of trouble.<eos> So, they wanted to destroy me, did they?<eos> If you think I tormented you in the past, wait until you see what I do with you now.
Hey, I ordered a cheeseburger!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No cheeseburger.<eos> We only serve sushi here.<eos> Man, oh, man!<eos> We've got to do something about this, dudes!<eos> Don't panic.<eos> We can handle this.<eos> I must continue the search for my beloved.<eos> I have no time to deal with you!
- Yeah.<eos> Sometimes shook-up old ladies<eos> - get cut.<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> They're just bums.<eos> Mr. Puniverse wants a fat lip.<eos> I'd like to hear you sing.<eos> I will say this once and once only.<eos> Stay away from my granddaughter, you common juvenile delinquents.<eos> It was nice talking to you all.
It's all right.<eos> No one was injured.<eos> Juvenile delinquents are everywhere.<eos> Right here in this community.<eos> Boys with long hair and tattoos, who spit on the sidewalk.<eos> - Can't believe it.<eos> How disgusting.<eos> Girls who wear tight slacks.<eos> Hysterectomy pants, I call them.<eos> And if one of these creatures ever approach you on the street, you are to silently repeat to yourself the four "B's" you learned here at RSVP.
I'm small, I can get them for you.<eos> And then, Dad...<eos> Come here.<eos> You heard what Uncle Jules said.<eos> We're going to walk seven miles in the hills.<eos> You're too small to walk that far.<eos> I'm light. My bottom's not fat like Uncle Jules'!<eos> I never get tired.<eos> I don't like people mentioning my bottom.<eos> If you won't take me with you, I'll be sick.
They can fly 500 or 600 yards after they're dead.<eos> The lad saw them fall on the ridge.<eos> Good job, boy!<eos> If you don't have a dog, have children!<eos> - Who sold you that?<eos> - They cost two shots.<eos> One weighs two pounds and eight ounces.<eos> And the other, three pounds and two ounces!<eos> Royal partridges!<eos> - St. Hubert was with you.
The mood on board Becomes businesslike and a little tense As we draw closer To the powerful skyline of Bombay.<eos> The customs officers will go over A dhow from Dubai very thoroughly. It's the main route For smuggling gold into India.<eos> The ship's lifeboat, which would have been Totally inadequate for 22 people, Is lowered, with much helpful advice, Into waters which give murkiness A bad name.<eos> Bye, Suliman.<eos> Bye, Suliman II. Bye, Yusef.<eos> Bye, Mohammed. Goodbye!<eos> Bye-bye, Kasim!<eos> Thanks very much!<eos> You are very nice people. Very good crew!<eos> I will always sail with you. Thank you!
- No, I am sure.<eos> - And the Tredwell?<eos> - Must know, live already here there has much.<eos> - The nursemaid of the child, you. Withers?<eos> - I find that not.<eos> No.<eos> - Take, one for each one.<eos> - The best.<eos> Captain, we are going to start a travel for the darkness.<eos> - I go with you.
No, really, i'll be fine.<eos> It'll be nice and quiet in your car.<eos> Not like my apartment.<eos> They're building that new freeway, you know?<eos> But the noise is usually drowned out By the all-Night bowling alley.<eos> Well, then, of course... You can always spend the night here.<eos> Only if i'm not imposing.<eos> We can put brian in with lynn And, uh, you can have his room.<eos> You folks have been so nice to me.<eos> Can i level with you?
Whatever you can grab is yours.<eos> You ready?<eos> Okay.<eos> [CLAMORING]<eos> Kids, kids, kids!<eos> Stop playing with your mother for a minute.<eos> I was just up in the bathroom, and I had an emotional experience.<eos> You washed your hands this time?<eos> No.<eos> Anyhow, I'd like to share something beautiful with you.
Howaboutastatement?<eos> Turn this way, would ya?<eos> Hey, everybody outta here.<eos> Give the Kid some air.<eos> Chalky, get them outta here.<eos> You're fighting Tiger Joe Jackson in a week or two, Out!<eos> Out!<eos> Chalky, have a heart come on.<eos> Kid, Kid, we need one statement for the press.<eos> He'll talk to you later.
Right, 15 quid.<eos> And what did I get?<eos> A five-quid book token.<eos> Those cards aren't free.<eos> I had to fork out for that.<eos> You never even paid me back.<eos> You're tighter than an Italian waiter's keks.<eos> Blue Midget is loaded.<eos> - Aren't you ready?<eos> - We'll catch you up.
Showtime at 7:00 p.m.!<eos> It'll be great fun for the whole family!<eos> Lions, tigers, and bears.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> - The bearded lady was so fake.<eos> - Right.<eos> - She was.<eos> You could tell.<eos> - And you kissed her, I guess?<eos> That's right, I'm talking to you!
I've got a very important meeting today.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I have to leave town for a few days.<eos> Okay, we'll do it when you get back.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'm late.<eos> - Nice to see you again.<eos> - Nice to see you, too.<eos> I'll talk to you guys when you get back.
- Tommy look, there's David.<eos> - White two, red zero.<eos> That's not a point, Tommy.<eos> - Punk!<eos> - Bow to each other.<eos> - That's enough!<eos> - All right, gentlemen, hit the showers.<eos> Hit the showers.<eos> Quickly.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
Shut the fuck up.<eos> You're under arrest, Kovic!<eos> Come on!<eos> - What?<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You're a pig?<eos> You should've died over there, you traitor.<eos> I don't have balance.<eos> Give me your fucking hands.<eos> Okay, I'll go with you.
Hey, this guy shows a lot of spunk.<eos> Come on, Katie.<eos> I'm with you guys.<eos> Steve!<eos> Do something, Steve.<eos> - Do something.<eos> - Like what?<eos> Come on, Katie.<eos> - Let's get out of here.<eos> - I'm with you guys.
Hate mail finally got you, didn't it?<eos> Age: Uh, 42.<eos> Race: Caucasian.<eos> Description of wound:<eos> Some-uh, several large bites. Probably a canine.<eos> No, scratch the canine.<eos> He probably did that to himself.<eos> All right, I'm going into the chest.<eos> Feet and hands inside for the ride.<eos> If you cooperate, we'll go easy on you.
-No.<eos> -What then?<eos> Guys, I can't find my squad.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> -l can't find Wilkins.<eos> -Find any pound cake?<eos> -No, just chicken.<eos> -Where is yours?<eos> Somebody stole it.<eos> Can I stay with you?
- Who's hearing voices?<eos> - Ray is.<eos> Out in the fields.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I'm...<eos> Noises.<eos> That darned tractor...<eos> I'm just going to get some 3-in-1oil.<eos> That ought to do it.<eos> Nice talking to you.
One piece of advice: Do not overdo it on him too hard.<eos> - Take the helm.<eos> - Of course, sir.<eos> I would check the lifeboats too.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> - Can you take us home?<eos> - I'll call sea rescue.<eos> And you?<eos> Will you stay here?<eos> I will never be what he wants me to be, so I'll go with you.
Tasty pick, bonehead!<eos> If you had brain one in that huge melon on top of your neck, you'd be living the sweet life in the beautiful San Fernando Valley.<eos> Oh, darn it.<eos> Now we become one.<eos> Now we become one.<eos> - Where's that singing coming from?<eos> - The people outside.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Ghostbusters.<eos> I'm here with you, guys.
A... a Cornish name? No, I am a Welshman.<eos> Knowest thou Fluellen?<eos> Aye.<eos> Tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate upon Saint Davy's day.<eos> Do not wear your dagger in your cap that day, lest he knock that about yours.<eos> Art thou his friend?<eos> And his kinsman too.<eos> The figo with thee then.<eos> I thank you.<eos> God be with you.
On the sidewalk, please.<eos> Mrs. McGee.<eos> There she is.<eos> Let me ask her.<eos> Why can't we talk to you if you're the spokesperson?<eos> You can.<eos> I'll come outside and talk, but not inside.<eos> I've asked you to leave.<eos> - We'll go, if you come and talk.<eos> - I don't think I'll talk to you.
It was there that Sinbad sailed... in hopes of discovering where Jaffar had hidden the sacred gems.<eos> When Jaffar learned that Sinbad had escaped his dungeon... and set sail with his men to find the sacred gems of Basra... he called forth the black source of his evil strength... and prayed to the Lord of the underworld.<eos> Illustrious Prince of Darkness, do not forsake me.<eos> Grant me the power to crush him forever.<eos> And a terrible cloud covered the sun... and blackened the skies over Sinbad's ship... turning the day into night.<eos> And out of that awful darkness... rose up the legions of Death.<eos> The brave crew of the mighty Sinbad prepared to battle for their very souls.<eos> Go back where you came from... you evil, filthy spirit.<eos> Dinner's ready.<eos> What's with you guys?
Thank you.<eos> Mama, look at this.<eos> This was in the hall closet.<eos> What is it?<eos> Rubbers.<eos> Tommy says Jonathans planning to cover the honeymoon car with these.<eos> -Please stop him!<eos> -Keep your voice down.<eos> Jonathan!<eos> Boys, I wanna talk to you.
It was reversed.<eos> - What about the ring?<eos> - On the wrong hand.<eos> Are we clever or what?<eos> Let's blow this place.<eos> 20 seconds, Cash.<eos> There's a lot of new pollution in the sky tonight and they call it Perret.<eos> Kiki, are you okay?<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm okay.<eos> I'm just worried about you.
Um, here you are.<eos> Hmm.<eos> And then there was the Earle of Essex...<eos> Was there...<eos> A truly great man -- they still sing his famous ballad down the Chepstow Arms.<eos> What ballad is that?<eos> "The Earle he had a thousand sovereigns, hey nonny no!<eos> He gave them all away to the man with the axe ... oh!"<eos> A thousand sovereigns?<eos> Well, you can't take it with you, Your Majesty...
not only that, who would unbrick me once the cement becomes set?<eos> no, you stay out there.<eos> but i have a little hammer.<eos> we could both bang away until someone heard us.<eos> help me through.<eos> rene!<eos> rene, there are germans everywhere. nowhere is safe.<eos> that is why i am bricking myself up with my husband.<eos> but if they cannot find you, they will put the blame on me!<eos> i, too, will brick myself up with you.
my favorite drink.<eos> do you have a light?<eos> my favorite-- my favorite brand.<eos> let us sit down and see what else we have in common.<eos> oh, well-- i like berlin in june, how about you?<eos> i like a mozart tune, how about you?<eos> i am mad about good books-- i cannot get my fill.<eos> and adolf hitler's looks?<eos> they give me a chill.<eos> psst! i must speak with you.
Of course you know.<eos> Look, we're not trying to--<eos> Mrs. Tanaka, we're very sorry to have disturbed you.<eos> Thank you very much for your time.<eos> - May I help you?<eos> - How you doing?<eos> My name's Jackson.<eos> This is Mr. Frank Dux.<eos> Are our rooms ready?<eos> Mr. Lin in Room 31 0 wants to see you after you check in.
-Put these on and we won't have to use it.<eos> -lt's your last warning, Frank.<eos> Inspector, no.<eos> We've gotta take him back.<eos> Frank, give us a break. We've been chasing you all over Hong Kong.<eos> -Can we stop this?<eos> -Okay, Frank. You win.<eos> But it's wrong what you're doing.<eos> It's a mistake.<eos> I'll meet you at the airport tomorrow.
I've got a card here somewhere.<eos> Here. Who do I have to kill?<eos> - Hold that for me. - Whoa!<eos> - There you go.<eos> - You don't have to kill anybody!<eos> Possession!<eos> Learn to throw your voice.<eos> We just want to get some people out of our house.<eos> I understand. In order to do that, I'll have to get to know you.<eos> We've got to get closer. Move in with you for a while.
Tell your troubles to somebody else.<eos> Why?<eos> You're perfect.<eos> Orderly!<eos> Orderly!<eos> All right, calm down!<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Let him down.<eos> Let him go, let him go.<eos> What is wrong with you people?
But, Melchett, what have you got under your coat?<eos> Is it a present?<eos> A present, Majesty?<eos> But of course!<eos> You're so painfully transparent, Blackadder.<eos> Am I?<eos> That's fab!<eos> I love presents.<eos> For a moment, I took against Christmas, but nowl'm dippy about it again.<eos> In fact, I'd like to marry you.
It's so wonderful to see you.<eos> - It's great to see you, boy. - What's to see?<eos> I'm a broken-down old schlep with one foot in the grave.<eos> If I was a horse, they'd shoot me.<eos> The same old Bernie.<eos> You haven't aged a day.<eos> You probably think I'm ajerk for not going with you.<eos> Oh, Bernie, we never thought that.<eos> Good, because I never regretted it.<eos> I never once regretted not going with you.
We're going to start the demonstration now.<eos> Sara, please?<eos> - See?<eos> All right!<eos> You can't fool him, you see?<eos> We're gonna make arrangements to move him to a secure location.<eos> - I want to keep this very quiet.<eos> - Fine. - Good work. Job well done.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Congratulations. I am very impressed with you and your facility.
Today we can rejoice with the family as we welcome Lindy home.<eos> Words are totally inadequate to say how we feel, to express our gratitude for your love and your care and your prayers.<eos> It reaches out to us like a blanket. It surrounds us.<eos> It's totally tangible.<eos> The fight for justice has only just started.<eos> You may think it's over, but, believe me, it's only just beginning.<eos> It's not only for us, for our freedom and to clear our name.<eos> But it's for all Australians.<eos> We never wanna see this happen in Australia again.<eos> God bless you all and be with you.
I feel sure you are about to tell me.<eos> He went round to see his mistress and bluntly announced he was leaving her.<eos> Well, as you can expect, she protested vociferously.<eos> But to everything she said to every objection she made he simply replied:<eos> "It's beyond my control."<eos> Good night.<eos> You're only five minutes late, but I get so frightened.<eos> I become convinced I'm never going to see you again.<eos> - My angel.<eos> - Is it like that for you, too?
I don't know.<eos> I don't see him anywhere.<eos> He's gone.<eos> He went straight up.<eos> I've seen enough.<eos> One Baker five.<eos> Curt, do you read me?<eos> One Baker five.<eos> This is Mooney speaking.<eos> I was a little worried about you.
You're a demon.<eos> You're possessed.<eos> You're a lunatic!<eos> This is my home!<eos> - You should be ashamed.<eos> - Kill him!<eos> He's going to burn us.<eos> Don't touch him!<eos> If I could touch every stone if I could breathe on every branch, they'd get up and follow me!<eos> So what's wrong with you?
Does she have any family or friends that might know where she went?<eos> She has a sister, Lanh.<eos> She works at the stripping place on the corner of Thieu and Tu Do Streets.<eos> The Pink Pu...<eos> The Pink Pussy, sergeant.<eos> We know it well.<eos> Thank you, Sister.<eos> We'll talk to Lanh and see what she knows.<eos> Sergeant.<eos> I don't think Lanh will talk to you.
You're not gonna do it.<eos> He's got his hand on his gun.<eos> It's not quite working out right, huh?<eos> Live or die. Your choice.<eos> I need some help in here now!<eos> OK, everybody.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Move back.<eos> Let's go.<eos> It doesn't concern you.
"I want you to do whatever you want to do."<eos> So you know what he did?<eos> He threw up.<eos> The thing about being married to a Polish man you'd think it would be like being married to anyone else.<eos> The first physical contact I had with a woman came very early in life.<eos> I saw a girl dancing, I went up and bit her on the chest.<eos> Slaughter?<eos> They're saving the whales they're saving the seals but nobody gives a shit when they kill a baby polyester just to make a...<eos> Hollywood's newest concept for a wax museum comes from an ear doctor who treats the stars.<eos> I don't want to argue with you, please, with the stereotypes.
And if you haven't heard basal ganglia, you haven't heard Shakespeare!<eos> The basal ganglia, where something passing through the size of just a peanut...<eos> - Don't do this!<eos> ...can bring silence!<eos> Darkness, like a comet, like a ship, Io, passing into the night.<eos> This scares me.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Don't be scared, because I'm funny Steve with a lampshade on his head who is singing and dancing, for your entertainment his own rendition of Singing in the Rain!<eos> Girls, everybody, come close.<eos> I wanna talk to you.
He was shot resisting arrest near Waterford... where he had stolen a car, and was attempting to flee.<eos> More at 5:00.<eos> We return you now to the ball game.<eos> Get the bike out of the back.<eos> Now get on it.<eos> What are you talking about, Dad-<eos> Get on the bike.<eos> You're on your own, kid.<eos> I want you to go to Juilliard.<eos> But, Dad, I want to go with you.
- Of course!<eos> I'll have to buy Mephisto a black tie.<eos> Did you hear, Mephisto?<eos> My dear fiancés, I am welcoming you... from the deep bottom of my heart... on this very special day... when you freely decided to be legally... man and wife.<eos> I suppose that both of you know your duties... in supporting each other... and I am sure both of you know your own medical records.<eos> I have to tell you this:<eos> Don't think life is a walk on a sunny meadow.<eos> Life isn't a walk on a sunny meadow... and life isn't a walk on a rose garden.<eos> Our socialist country... has done much for you.<eos> Now it's up to you.
But Mark says it looks like Nicaragua and that we're making some kind of statement.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It's just like paradise.<eos> It's like a paradise with little gold palm trees.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> I hope I'm not being rude, but who are you?<eos> I'm Tess.<eos> I'm... I'm a friend of Mark's.<eos> I'm just so happy that I could be here for you today.
- You have left your rudio on.<eos> If you do not swatch it off, you will have a flit bittery.<eos> Thank you. I was just leaving anyway.<eos> Can I give anyone a lift?<eos> Colonel, Helga?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> (Man) "Allo, 'allo. I am receiving you.<eos> 'Stand by.<eos> We have somebody who wishes to speak with you.' l do not recognise this voice.
Here we are, gentlemen.<eos> - Hard hats, anyone? - Great.<eos> Get the lamps off.<eos> Fill those with water.<eos> - We in business?<eos> - We're doing all right.<eos> Just one thing:<eos> I don't want Pepe going into portal six.<eos> - It could be dangerous.<eos> - No, I'm with you all the way, guys.
I have delved into...<eos> A magic course he got selling magayines in the tenth grade.<eos> A correspondence course.<eos> A mail-order Mandrake, huh?<eos> No.<eos> A mail-order Sheldrake.<eos> Come to the opening tonight, and I'll show you the most magnificent magic act you've ever seen.<eos> Thank you, one and all for joining The Great Sheldrake on this magic carpet ride into that shadowed land where reality and illusion intermingle.<eos> A place where the mysteries of time, space, and the journey of souls are held in the firm grasp of darkness.<eos> A depth of infinite knowledge, shared with you alone.
Definitely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll just change for bed, then.<eos> Isn't that cute, Peg?<eos> She's... walking.<eos> Al, will you put down Tiffany's sweater?<eos> You know, Peg, her sweater smells like sunshine.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, Al, why don't we put it with your shirts?<eos> What with the moons under your arms and her sunshine, we'll have a whole galaxy.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Bundy, I can't thank you enough for letting me stay here with you.
Where are you going?<eos> We said 45.<eos> The wealthier they are, the more they rob you! .<eos> Joseph, what are you doing?<eos> Get back to peeling the potatoes.<eos> All fixed now.<eos> - You drink too much, Madame Perrin. - Mind your own business.<eos> Can't be wrong to drink good wine.<eos> - You have stamps?<eos> - Wont do business with you anymore.
I can't do it?<eos> I will not have this investigation pissed away.<eos> This crime, this robbery, could be a political disaster for the mayor.<eos> Have you ever heard of due process?<eos> Policy requires us to give you a board of review within two days.<eos> You got two days.<eos> - I am fighting you on this, Harold.<eos> - Chief Lutz to you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm not through with you two guys.
- Should I call the bomb squad?<eos> - That's funny, Eddy. - It's Alex.<eos> - Ferrino, hold that.<eos> Hello? Hello?<eos> What?<eos> - Where's Vincent?<eos> - Went back to the...<eos> - Bring him to the game room.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Hey, Jack, Tony, I want to talk to you.
You must bring him back to life.<eos> He's mine!<eos> Pablo is mine.<eos> - He wanted to save me.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> We must go to the hospital.<eos> You wait here.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> - I'm going with you.
Wonderful!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm sorry we missed the concert.<eos> We had some trouble at the airport.<eos> I can't imagine why!<eos> General Gogol, I don't believe you've met Kamran Shah.<eos> - My pleasure.<eos> - Where's James?<eos> - Unhappily, he's on assignment abroad.<eos> - I'll be with you shortly.
Ladies and gentlemen-<eos> - Thank you, Miss...<eos> - Mrs. Feldman.<eos> I want to welcome all of you to the Academy.<eos> You are part of a new and exciting program that I call...<eos> - C.O.P. - C.O.P.<eos> - Citizens On Patrol. - Citizens On Patrol.<eos> - Citizens On Patrol! - Citizens On Patrol!<eos> You will work and train with the police.<eos> The police will work and train with you.
Discipline!<eos> - Jerk.<eos> - What?<eos> He said bye.<eos> No.<eos> I said jerk.<eos> I think it was pretty clear.<eos> - I said, "Jerk. "<eos> - Jerk.<eos> Cadets, I'd now like to discuss with you... something that will be vital for you to know... when you're, like, out there on the job as a police officer.
Your mother still makes lousy spaghetti.<eos> - lt's pasta now.<eos> Spaghetti's out of date.<eos> - So am I. You want a beer?<eos> Billie!<eos> Bring a Molson Lite for the kid!<eos> - Looking good, huh?<eos> - He looks terrific.<eos> Carl, we'll be at the bar.<eos> - l'll catch up with you.
What's this?<eos> Yours truly, leg..<eos> I've made him crippled. Once he tried to escape from here.<eos> - And you..<eos> Thank me that I've just crippled him.. ..and not cut his leg.<eos> You rogue!<eos> You should thank me that I reunited a family.<eos> Got it?<eos> Let my Shankar come.<eos> Soon, he will be with you.
The women's movement comes to Toga Island.<eos> It is time for you to bless the meal.<eos> Let us be thankful for the peace and joy here on Toga today and for this bounty that is before us.<eos> May we continue to prosper and love, forever...<eos> Well said, my son.<eos> It's the monks!<eos> Oh, boy, are we glad to see you guys.<eos> Yeah, we heard you have a radio.<eos> It seems we have a new god on the island of Toga.<eos> Can I speak to you behind the totem pole here?
Wrong.<eos> I've got a better plan.<eos> Look at that idiot, he thinks he's really a god.<eos> Where is everybody?<eos> Looking for us?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Move, move.<eos> You, too, get moving, sucker.<eos> HANNIBAL: Frankie, you and Face set up that monastery to blow.<eos> We'll meet with you after we have a talk with Chief Saderaka.
Something I can do for you?<eos> We need to talk to you.<eos> About what?<eos> Your father.<eos> Who are you?<eos> We want to help you, Matt.<eos> Listen, we're on your father's side.<eos> But we really got to know what's going on.<eos> No, I'm on his side.<eos> Look, I don't know you... and I don't want to talk to you.
Huge pink and pale blue hotels... where there was once only unadulterated sand.<eos> Ugly. Ugly.<eos> Yeah, ugly.<eos> Non-stop ugly.<eos> Junk everywhere.<eos> Junkies, junk food, junk mail, junk-junk, triple junk, double junk, quadruple junk... wrecked aircraft grinning charco'al flame... smiles of death and hopelessness.<eos> Charter members of the Mile High Club, are cooking on another planet... and they will not share the recipe.<eos> Lifetime residents of the Miami day room, weave ugly baskets... out of shattered dreams and whacked-out schemes.<eos> Scammers, planners, posers, pilots... superstars of tragic circumstance. Can I have your autographs?<eos> Yeah, Captain's talking to you.
A closed piano is a dead piano.<eos> I sell live pianos, guys.<eos> Live ones!<eos> Look at all your little teeth sparkling away.<eos> You have to come alive today of all days.<eos> I'm sure you'll make a great team.<eos> It's ready!<eos> Are you coming up?<eos> Yeah, I'm coming.<eos> I'm counting on you.
Where's the money?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Uh... Eddie?<eos> Eddie!<eos> Where's the money?<eos> Eddie's got the money.<eos> Where'd they go?<eos> They left.<eos> Relax.<eos> Take it easy. What's the matter with you guys?
He started to say something.<eos> Then we lost him.<eos> Well, I can't wait any longer.<eos> - This is Mr Samir, your guide in Beirut.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> We gotta get moving.<eos> Otherwise we'll miss that rendezvous.<eos> ISRAEL, HAIFA NAVAL BASE MONDAY, JULY 22ND - 4:15PM<eos> Raffi... I just wanna thank you for all your help on this.<eos> - I wish I could join you.
My God, aren't you feeling well?<eos> Be careful, it's wet.<eos> - Lean on me.<eos> - Where's my yogurth?<eos> Admiral, you have to take the drops before.<eos> I want an answer.<eos> - I want my yogurth.<eos> - It's in my bag, I'll get it now.<eos> Admiral what will you do in our show?<eos> - He'll be with you. - With us?
I think as far as laughs, that was probably the best thing we ever did.<eos> But the show about the Frenchmen, that was funny and warm.<eos> We got that idea on that Paris trip.<eos> Remember that?<eos> Hannah had jet lag for six weeks.<eos> But it was... I guess we had fun when we were there.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Coffee?<eos> Listen, you guys, we...<eos> Want some more? We had something we really wanted to discuss with you.
And I told them to give all the food away to those people on the road.<eos> All, all away.<eos> Who is this woman?<eos> I mean, I don't know who you are.<eos> No more do I.<eos> All right.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - If you could have any wish?<eos> - Love, to be with you.
- I'm not.<eos> She's not nervous.<eos> I'm nervous!<eos> - You're hysterical.<eos> - How is Walter taking it?<eos> Taking what?<eos> There's nothing to take.<eos> Here he comes!<eos> Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.<eos> It's a great pleasure to be back with you again.
Haddy.<eos> You won't tell Father I come.<eos> Sparks and gas for Father's outboard.<eos> What will I tell him?<eos> Tell him you found 'em.<eos> Don't mention Haddy.<eos> You gonna drown without the outboard.<eos> There gonna be water everywhere.<eos> You hear, Charlie?<eos> God be with you.
I do not want to die like a dog.<eos> I have a wife and babes.<eos> - I am still young, young!<eos> - O Jesus, in Thy infinite mercy.<eos> They haven't the spunk of a weevil.<eos> We must get ourselves out of this alone...<eos> - just you Froggie, and myself.<eos> - I'm with you, Captain!<eos> - You're a bullycock.<eos> - I'm with you too!
Mind if I come in and talk to you about it?<eos> Mom, I don't feel well.<eos> You know, I got a t-- maybe, we'll just talk from here, all right?<eos> Come inside, baby. I want to take your temperature.<eos> Come on, Robert.<eos> I'm glad we have this opportunity to talk with your family out of the way.<eos> Because I believe you have a problem here.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I believe, there's an Indian living' here with you?
Do you think this is too much?<eos> Bye.<eos> I thought that was very uncool of you last night.<eos> - What?<eos> - "What"!<eos> - You mean Andie?<eos> - Yeah, I mean Andie.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> I like her.<eos> Matter of fact, I was pissed off that you guys were so nasty to her.
- Rich people make him crazy.<eos> - There's a guy up here named Snake.<eos> He's wearin' garage-sale clothes and the top of his hair looks like a parakeet.<eos> He also has $50,000 in small bills in a briefcase.<eos> As his neighbours, you must make sure there are no suspicious characters... or evil perpetrators lurking' in the area who would seek to do him harm.<eos> Again, $50,000 in small bills. Tax free!<eos> In a briefcase, in this apartment, which has really cheeseball locks.<eos> You can push in, bop him on the head, take it...<eos> Nobody'll know.<eos> So it's up to you.
No dough, no show.<eos> Boys. Boys.<eos> Let me just say... one thing.<eos> It'll be a cold day in hell when Harry Flugleman lets an actor tell him what to do!<eos> Do you know what the word "nada" means?<eos> In all those Mexican movies you made, did you ever hear that word?<eos> - Isn't that a light chicken gravy...<eos> - It means "nothing"! Zero.<eos> Zip.<eos> It's what you're gonna have when I'm through with you!
I have your horses waiting.<eos> You must ride against them now.<eos> - What is she talking about? - I don't know.<eos> Looks like we got another show to do.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Let's get it over with.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's go.<eos> They are so brave.<eos> It's a pleasure working with you.
Don't you think so? Shut up, fool!<eos> We got enough nuts around here.<eos> If you don't get out there and start lifting some things... I'm gonna turn you and baste you till you're black and blue. Now, come on now.<eos> B.A... that was inspirational.<eos> We expecting a truck this afternoon?<eos> Yeah, but it was supposed to be Daly.<eos> I don't recognize those guys.<eos> What the hell's going on out there?<eos> (Hannibal) Let's get out of here.<eos> I wanna talk to you guys.
With all the stress that we go through every day... chasing cops, flipping vans, being the vanguards of justice and all that... I mean, I think there might be something to this health and vitality stuff.<eos> I mean, they give us vitamin pills at the V.A. all the time... and we're just crazy about them.<eos> You can say that again.<eos> All of it?<eos> Ah, never mind, Murdock.<eos> Now, can we get down to the problem at hand?<eos> Look, ladies, I think you should be aware... of the fact that we are rather expensive.<eos> Look, there's no problem.<eos> We've got some money saved up... and if we can get Hi-Brite back on its feet, we'll have plenty of cash.<eos> Actually, I want to be honest with you.
You're gettin' a little long there, buddy.<eos> What are you doin', man?<eos> What do you mean, "what am I doin"'?<eos> What's it look like I'm doin'?<eos> You're filing' Elvis's nails.<eos> Well, he can't do it himself.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> We got company, man.<eos> What do those meatheads want?<eos> I'd like to talk to you guys.
My friend's cousin, who I don't know, you're going to pay 30.<eos> And you're gonna be protected, secure, and everything will be very nice when you get back to Miami Beach... and live in millionaire style.<eos> Is that not what you want? To live in a millionaire style, but not at 30.<eos> Twenty-five is what I'll offer.<eos> Look, I talk to you because I knew Papo Morales.<eos> No, you talk to me because you want to make a deal.<eos> Deal?<eos> Do you know how many gringos come here looking to make a deal?<eos> You know how many Colombians want to make a deal?<eos> If I talk to you again, we will see if, uh, if we can do the business.
Thanks a lot for this.<eos> She'll really like it.<eos> D-4.<eos> Wilke.<eos> - Now the knee. - All right!<eos> Perfect!<eos> Just perfect!<eos> That's great!<eos> Yeah. Document Control.<eos> - "NSA guy on his way up to see you."
It was impulsive.<eos> I never expected it to go on as long as it has.<eos> I'm not like you.<eos> You have no idea what I'm feeling.<eos> You want a mole in the CIA, you find somebody else.<eos> I have a life apart from all this, unlike you.<eos> You know, we waited a very long time to meet you.<eos> We have put up with more than anyone should ever have to!<eos> - You owe us.<eos> - Owe you?

Don't trade places with what I been through.<eos> Come on, Miss Celie. Les go into the car.<eos> He ain't worth it.<eos> He ain't worth it.<eos> Who you think you is?<eos> You can't curse nobody.<eos> Look at you!<eos> You're black, you're poor, you're ugly, you're a woman!<eos> Until you do right by me, everything you even think about will fail!<eos> Is been a pleasure meeting all of you.
There's this little business about stolen dynamite, and where's your pal?<eos> That ex-yippie science teacher, Bob Roberts?<eos> - l don't know.<eos> - That a fact?<eos> - Yeah....<eos> - Tell you what.<eos> - Let's take a ride down to the station.<eos> - What for?<eos> - l'm enjoying the conversation.<eos> - l'm going with you.
Find Ikoma and Ogura for me!<eos> But it's they who've betrayed us!<eos> The enemy is everywhere, inside and out.<eos> Hell is upon us!<eos> Lord Taro is slain!<eos> - What?<eos> - A terrible shame!<eos> It was a stray shot from the tower!<eos> Such are the vagaries of war.<eos> The fates are kinder to you than to Taro.
THESE HANDCUFFS ARE FOR LUPIN!<eos> Four or five in the front cars. Same in the passenger cars.<eos> One of them is...<eos> Here's our wine list.<eos> "Independent actions are prohibited. "Attract them.<eos> Fascinate them first!"<eos> I'll have this. I'll have this.<eos> Me too. Very good, ladies.<eos> Oh, oh, a pair of my kind of big-busted ladies!<eos> May I join you?
Well, do you want to dump them? I don't know.<eos> Well, we have been with them three months. We've been to all the parties.<eos> We've met all the people. We won't go to any more parties and we won't meet any more people.<eos> We'll go into a social coma.<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> We're sorry.<eos> Want to give them another chance? Okay.<eos> Will you forgive us? Please.<eos> Oh, you guys.<eos> What are we gonna do with you?
Over This is unit 7-3-6.<eos> we are on our way.<eos> And veteran, Michael Johnson, has been threatening to jump for over an hour<eos> Press. Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Damn, the network news is here first.<eos> Stay there!<eos> Why don't you hear me?<eos> I'm so damn tired.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you? Can't you people leave anything alone?
-He's gonna like it here.<eos> -I'm sure.<eos> I'll see you later, Eleanor.<eos> Goodbye, Sean.<eos> It's good to see you again, Julie.<eos> -Martin.<eos> -Hello, Donovan.<eos> -You just stop by for directions?<eos> -We brought weapons and uniforms.<eos> -We're with you now.
What did you find out?<eos> Murdock just got hired by the Long Beach Cargo shipping company.<eos> And this is serious business, Murdock.<eos> So you can't take your invisible dog Billy, or your talking bug friends.<eos> You got that? B.A., have I said anything about invisible dogs?<eos> Have I had any conversations with insects of late?<eos> No. You are the one displaying paranoiac tendencies, my friend.<eos> If you will excuse me.<eos> Judy, we're gonna fly from here, so if you'll take the van back to your house...<eos> Wait a minute. I'm going with you.
We're close.<eos> What else did he tell you?<eos> There was some arms trafficking on the US Army base... that you and your brother were stationed at.<eos> And that before his death... your brother was scheduled to drive the stolen hardware off the base.<eos> Paul got scared.<eos> He wanted out.<eos> Great reason to kill somebody.<eos> Just a crazy thing.<eos> I can't even go to the base commander because I don't know if he's in on it.<eos> That's why I came to you.
They got Ollie.<eos> We better get back to the compound.<eos> [Singing] In the spring, spring, spring<eos> When the birdies sing<eos> The nuts fall off the walls<eos> I was just singing a song.<eos> Somebody kicked that tripwire we set.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Hold it!<eos> We're not gonna have any more trouble out of you people, are we?
You got thrown out a window?<eos> TAWNIA: Didn't you tell them?<eos> I was just about to get around to that.<eos> [Siren wailing] Decker.<eos> You can tell us on the road.<eos> - See you, Baker, and thanks.<eos> - Hannibal, wait!<eos> Decker saw me with you.<eos> He'll haul me off to jail.<eos> You've got to let me come with you.
Tell them to drop their guns and back up against the bush.<eos> Let's see the money.<eos> $1,000 notes.<eos> Must be $200,000 in here.<eos> We'll just take it all, for now.<eos> If there is anything left after we repair the Golden Pagoda... and pay back all the people you've been stealing from around here... then we'll get it back to you.<eos> Minus, of course, a modest fee for our services.<eos> I mean, it's not like we're robbers.<eos> Now, here's the new law, sucker.<eos> We're closing you down.
Almost visionary.<eos> Bait, which is the solution.<eos> I came to Sherwood because I love you.<eos> Whatever happens, what the danger is, I want to be with you.<eos> There you had today something to overcome.<eos> If you had been there ...<eos> You think I want to live without you?<eos> I am one of you.<eos> That should be.<eos> The boy also fights with you.
Beat Street<eos> It's like a heartbeat<eos> I'm talkin' about Beat Street<eos> No one said it'd be easy<eos> And people never treat you like they should<eos> You got to get out and go for yourself<eos> But you knew that you always would<eos> It's like a heartbeat<eos> Beat Street<eos> Kenny, let me go with you.
Beat Street<eos> Kenny, let me go with you.<eos> All right.<eos> Fresh.<eos> Ramo, when will you teach me that style?<eos> Practice up on it.<eos> I like you, man.<eos> - I'm going with you.<eos> - Check it out. Cotton-Field Chants and Hollers. Very fresh.<eos> - Why can't I go with you, Kenny?
That's the million? To substitute for seven days in every way imaginable.<eos> Who are these guys?<eos> Two of the richest men in the world, cousins.<eos> They're part of a dynasty that represents an authentic empire of wealth.<eos> Uh, they live in Brazil, Rio.<eos> You know Brazil?<eos> Is the Pope Catholic?<eos> They own tobacco plantations, hundreds of thousands of cattle, mines, shipyards, hotels, banks.<eos> Boy, that's really tough.<eos> So, can I count on you both?
Jessie?<eos> Aren't you coming to work today?<eos> No, I'm not coming in today.<eos> Just go ahead without me.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll see you tomorrow.<eos> I could use a map of some kind to plan out where we're going.<eos> We're in good shape.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> How's she gonna travel with you?
Don't worry.<eos> Then I'm going to open.<eos> - Right now?<eos> - It's late. - Alright then. ...<eos> It's not my fault. - I'll never come here in the morning!<eos> - Yes you will.<eos> - No, I'll come in the afternoon.<eos> I'll come here in the afternoon.<eos> I want to sleep in the morning.<eos> - Then I'll leave it to you.
We should be thinking of moving on before the sun gets too high.<eos> Do forgive me, Dr Aziz.<eos> I'm rather tired, so I think I'll stay here.<eos> I've never been a good walker, and you two will get on much better without me.<eos> Dear Mrs Moore, nothing to forgive.<eos> You're right. It is quite a big climb.<eos> And I'm glad you're not coming, because you're treating me with true frankness, as a friend.<eos> I am your friend.<eos> - So may I make a suggestion?<eos> - Of course. Don't take quite so many people with you this time.
And I had this theory that it was my Aunt Ida's kissing that was doing it.<eos> Because they were all dropping dead in January and February, and she was doing all the kissing in December.<eos> There was a definite cause-and-effect relationship there.<eos> What is he, a friend of yours?<eos> Hopper, why do you keep looking over there?<eos> No reason.<eos> I saw Sally. Oh, yeah?<eos> Where?<eos> At the Point.<eos> How'd it go with you two? Okay, I guess.
Boys.<eos> Matty.<eos> Jed.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Don't talk, don't say anything.<eos> Let me look at you.<eos> Yeah. I knew I was right.<eos> I knew it.<eos> You're alive.<eos> I was tough on both of you.
He never aided anybody!<eos> We just took the stuff!<eos> We killed him!<eos> They killed him, son.<eos> Made him an example.<eos> Now, you boys listen to me and let that burn in real good.<eos> I don't know where your mother is, Robert.<eos> I ain't got nobody now!<eos> You boys need food, a bed, you need anything, you come here.<eos> I... got a couple of heirlooms I wanna hide with you.
Before we get in a big, wicked fight, let's get out of here, huh?<eos> Hi, Jake. I'm Samantha.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Do you got a cigarette?<eos> Jake, this may sound incredibly dumb, but I love you, and I'll do anything to make you love me.<eos> I love your shirt.<eos> Jake, you're not going to believe this, but I had this very bizarre dream, and you were in it.<eos> They won't like me! I'm not going to tell you again!<eos> Just act like a man!<eos> I want to go home! I want to be with you guys!
We will start with some resensualization exercises...<eos> - You've got... nice bodies...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So play and enjoy them but no erection and no penetration and the anxiety will disappear.<eos> Yeah... but if he gets...<eos> Well, you understand me... if he...<eos> Gets an erection?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Yes, but with what you've told us...<eos> Well, he very well could... In that case, it's up to you two.
Dr. Aaron Jastrow. We call him "Araleh".<eos> Sure. Of course we will.<eos> Will you please tell him Berel say "Lekh Lekha"?<eos> Two simple words in Hebrew. Lekh Lekha.<eos> Remember.<eos> That means "get out".<eos> Yes, "go out".<eos> I must go now.<eos> I have to go to find my wife and daughter.<eos> God watch you.
She may try to work her way back to Siena from London.<eos> She had that notion. But that may be impossible.<eos> Does she even know the word?<eos> I don't have time to talk about Natalie Jastrow now.<eos> But I'll tell you this.<eos> I haven't had a moment's peace of mind since I met that lioness.<eos> Why don't you marry her?<eos> I just may, if she'll have me.<eos> She'll have you.<eos> I don't think I'll be going with you.
She's as strait-laced as you are.<eos> What can a girl do that's worth that much money?<eos> That's what a senior-grade lieutenant makes after ten years!<eos> It's absurd!<eos> Well... would you like me to go to New York and be with her?<eos> We can't afford that.<eos> The Navy won't pay your way.<eos> Briny, you're going back with Slote.<eos> Maybe you can find a job in New York.<eos> I've been meaning to talk with you about that.
All this talk about food has made me hungry.<eos> Murdock, we were talking about eating parking tickets.<eos> Well, to a human garbage disposal anything's appetizing.<eos> - Uh, uh, B.A.?<eos> - Let him go, man.<eos> - Gotta get some gas. - Yeah, we've gotta get directions to the cemetery too.<eos> We'll meet you back here.<eos> I"m really not very hungry.<eos> Funerals tend to ruin my appetite.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.
I know he's out there.<eos> That devil of a whale I have chased so long.<eos> The white whale.<eos> The living ghost, with the harpoons of 100 men... in his back, and yet he still swims on.<eos> How that ghost haunts my soul... my mind.<eos> What mind?<eos> Cool it, Murdock.<eos> Must be high tide.<eos> I'm sorry. She's not here.<eos> PRESLEY: But I wouldn't want you to think that... I wasn't willing to play ball with you.
Your little protection racket is over.<eos> And if you lean on the Mayers once more... you're gonna be shopping for some new kneecaps.<eos> Face, read this guy what he owes up to date.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> For extorted profits from fishermen, damaged properties, and for duress... we figure you owe the people of Lobster Bay $300,000.<eos> That's a tentative figure, of course.<eos> Probably a lot larger.<eos> You people are real funny.<eos> We supposed to be scared of you guys?<eos> That's up to you.
There's nothing like a good old 22.<eos> [All] Twenty-two!<eos> Are you ready, B.A.?<eos> One more.<eos> Twenty-two always works.<eos> - We rehearse.<eos> - Here's one I've been rehearsing in my mind.<eos> That's for my window in my van.<eos> And here's for my tire.<eos> I don't have to fight with you.
All this talk about food has made me hungry.<eos> Murdock, we were talking about eating parking tickets.<eos> Well, to a human garbage disposal anything's appetizing.<eos> - Uh, uh, B.A.?<eos> - Let him go, man.<eos> - Gotta get some gas. - Yeah, we've gotta get directions to the cemetery too.<eos> We'll meet you back here.<eos> [Face] I"m really not very hungry.<eos> Funerals tend to ruin my appetite.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.
Honors and benefits.<eos> Already at the age of nine.<eos> Come on. Let's get on with it.<eos> I don't need all that jazz about smugglers and pirates.<eos> Listen tomorrow night for the concluding adventure of...<eos> The Black Pirate Ship.<eos> Now it's time... for Annie's secret message for you members of the secret circle.<eos> Remember, kids, only members of...<eos> Annie's secret circle can decode Annie's secret message.<eos> Remember, Annie is depending on you.
Find a bush, Audrey!<eos> Dad, you must've jumped the car about 50 yards!<eos> It's nothing to be proud of, Rusty.<eos> Fifty yards.<eos> Ellen, get me out of here!<eos> Stay in the car!<eos> It's hot and dangerous out here!<eos> Don't you tell me what to do!<eos> I'll do what I want!<eos> I should never have come on this trip with you!
You call reeling and passing out on the streets "a little"?<eos> I've told you before, I'm never going out with you when you're drinking!<eos> That's no reason to be with these bums.<eos> Who're you calling bums, pal?<eos> You!<eos> We got two more of us in the back seat.<eos> Pity the back seat!<eos> -You're looking for a fight!<eos> -I am looking for a fight!<eos> We'll go with you.
What was that you were you saying?<eos> You used to hear her chant all night long. "Om mahney pod me om."<eos> " - Om mahney pod me om."<eos> - Over the plants?<eos> She'd cup her hands over those seeds and chant by the hour.<eos> She grew the most beautiful wandoos you ever saw, man.<eos> Primo stuff.<eos> Resin city.<eos> Stand clear.<eos> The commander's been worried about you.
Request status check.<eos> Hey, Front Door, this is Midas.<eos> We are A-okay all the way.<eos> Condition:<eos> Green.<eos> Roger, Midas.<eos> Good work.<eos> Over and out.<eos> All right, Mr. Dugan, Miss Elliot.<eos> It is up to you.

Deactivated?<eos> You mean somebody turned you off?<eos> My creator, Wilton Knight... He brought me into the world and then turned on me.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> My old man... same way.<eos> Yeah. You can't count on nobody 'cept me and Tony.<eos> Interesting.<eos> I will enter that information in my data banks.<eos> I am indebted to both of you.
That's him!<eos> See the brand?<eos> That's him, zed's son.<eos> Kill him!<eos> Kill him now.<eos> Kill him!<eos> Kill him now!<eos> Face the animal on his own terms, you will find you are not so very strong.<eos> Seth, look.<eos> I'm indebted to you.
What do you wish me to do, colonel?<eos> Stay with them, but do not close up.<eos> I'll check with Priabin.<eos> What if they stop us?<eos> - There are other arrangements.<eos> - Other arrangements?<eos> - We've got over 600 miles to go today.<eos> - I am ordered to die, if necessary.<eos> To ensure that you get away free.<eos> What is it with you Jews, anyway?
We're asking for cooperation.<eos> We want identification from the superior officer.<eos> I'm sorry, but as I said the captain is involved in an experiment at the end of the floe.<eos> All right, team.<eos> Come on, you guys!<eos> Move it!<eos> Let's go!<eos> The man's got a plane to catch!<eos> - You've got to go.<eos> - I'm worried about you.
I checked it twice.<eos> What shall I do?<eos> Do what I told you:<eos> Get the chopper here, at once!<eos> A Green Beret!<eos> A war hero!<eos> Great!<eos> Just great!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> What's up with you?
Put away your revenge.<eos> What good will come of more killing?<eos> Have the courage to do what you know is right.<eos> For God's sake let us embrace like brothers.<eos> It's our promise.<eos> We stop.<eos> Hindu swords.<eos> It's a promise.<eos> Go.<eos> God be with you.
Even now they wait to hear from you.<eos> Wamba, your memory will be preserved while there is honour on this earth.<eos> But I trust I shall find means of saving you.<eos> And what shall I say if they should question me?<eos> I have no language of a holy Father.<eos> ls that all?<eos> -lt is more useful than a broomstick.<eos> -Very well.<eos> Athelstane, farewell.<eos> If I cannot save you, I shall return to die with you.
Does he breathe?<eos> But a rattle.<eos> A welcome addition to the kingdom of Satan.<eos> He lacked of faith, true, but unless we wish to join him, we had better return to the battlements.<eos> Live or die, we fight as gentlemen.<eos> -Stay outside.<eos> -What?<eos> Stay outside.<eos> You have no armour for this fight.<eos> My bones may be old, but let them curse me in my grave if I don't join you.
This cameo is over a hundred years old.<eos> Yeah, some haul, huh?<eos> And this watch is only a few years old, and it's not yours.<eos> Well, I'm off. I'm taking these back to the lab along with the tapes.<eos> I'm going to have to display these, you know.<eos> - Please, not on "60 Minutes."<eos> - Or "That's Incredible!"<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm leaving Ryan here with you.
I'm sorry about what happened last night, you know that. I want you to know that Nathan didn't mean what he said about your book.<eos> Well, you know that. Right?<eos> I know he really loves your writing.<eos> Look, that doesn't matter anymore.<eos> But, I mean, we will still be friends.<eos> You know, I'm leaving.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> It should be a better place for me to write.<eos> We have driven you away.<eos> It has nothing to do with you.
- It's a bloody great pile of rubble.<eos> The Pharaoh, mate... his wife and everything they had were buried in there.<eos> Yeah. That's man's first attempt to beat death.<eos> Thanks, professor, can you get your mind back on the game?<eos> Let's think about the West Australians' first attempt to beat the bloody Vics.<eos> Something's gotta be done about that long, thin streak of pelican shit.<eos> Yeah, get him, Bill.<eos> Sort the bastard right out.<eos> All right, men.<eos> You are shortly to be let loose on the local inhabitants... who, you will be surprised to find, don't look at all like you.
Hey, what country are you from?<eos> Ethiopia.<eos> What part?<eos> 125th Street.<eos> I'm gonna sign him up.<eos> The big turn.<eos> And that's the Ethiopian shim-sham.<eos> He's good.<eos> He's great.<eos> What's wrong with you? He's good.
No, you don't understand, Your Majesty.<eos> It is God's will.<eos> Except for the beauty mark and mustache.<eos> - There's our double. - Sacrebleu! You're right.<eos> I do look like the piss boy.<eos> All right.<eos> At the first sign of trouble, he shall be the king. - Go.<eos> - Immediately, sire.<eos> Bearnaise!<eos> Garçon, I must have a word with you.
I can't right now.<eos> - You see?<eos> OK, fine, I love you.<eos> Now come to class.<eos> Yu go ahead, I'll catch up.<eos> Hi guys. - Hey.<eos> -Hey.<eos> How are you, Yudale?<eos> - Fine, Bracha.<eos> Guys, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Twenty-four hours!<eos> They got twelve!<eos> You've got twelve!<eos> Listen, I was wrong about you and I'm sorry.<eos> It's a long time since I've seen driving like that, man.<eos> You're okay by me, son.<eos> With you driving that rig, we got it licked!<eos> Nice to have you aboard. I've been saving these.<eos> Thank you, and welcome.<eos> It's been a pleasure doing business with you, but I'm leaving.
I stared at him.<eos> We both knew it was wrong.<eos> It's just not gonna be any fun without you.<eos> Honest?<eos> Does that mean you'll stay?<eos> - We've got plenty of room.<eos> - No, no. We're past that.<eos> - You're coming with us.<eos> - Really?<eos> Me come with you?
Staff, stand at ease.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, for 141 years, old soldiers like myself have stood here on this day and told the finest of America's young men the meaning of the word "commencement".<eos> It is a beginning, we told them.<eos> But today, this day, it has another meaning, an end.<eos> An end to nearly a century and a half of tradition and an end to the heart of us.<eos> I have been informed that Bunker Hill Academy is to be closed, all of its buildings torn down, nothing to be left... but memories.<eos> It is the decision of the board of trustees in their wisdom that this institution be sold and the land developed for its real estate potential.<eos> In order to allow the incoming seniors to graduate and the underclassmen to seek enrolment elsewhere, the board has graciously extended the date of termination for one year.<eos> One year.<eos> I stand here today with you and look out over these young men
-Wait a minute.<eos> -Colby, we're losin' time.<eos> You mean you'd go back and play the second half?<eos> Move.<eos> We've only got a few minutes.<eos> Yes, but we could win this.<eos> You could never, with me as the goal.<eos> Of course, we can.<eos> He's not a bad goalie, is he?<eos> What's the matter with you?
You're a very clever man, Captain.<eos> I'm going to try to live up to that compliment.<eos> Try to understand, that opium really belongs to us.<eos> The dealers will pay us a good price for it.<eos> What I'm offering you is something more precious...<eos> Your life.<eos> It would be very easy for you to chase us, catch us and ram us.<eos> - Do you have any choice?<eos> - There are plenty of choices.<eos> I would prefer to die with honor, and at the same time get rid of you.
Made by the Pittsburgh Manufacturing Corporation Inc.,<eos> - Imported from America?<eos> - I know. But we make computer peripherals in this country.<eos> - In my constituency.<eos> - I know!<eos> - What about unemployment?<eos> This must be stopped.<eos> - Sir Humphrey to see... oh sorry.<eos> - Oh no.<eos> No, come in. I want to see you both, come on.
Oh, but she looks like you!<eos> The spitting image of you!<eos> It's amazing the way she looks like her mother!<eos> - No, no, I'm not allowed to.<eos> - You have to drink to the baby.<eos> But I'm in training.<eos> And you know that I've never liked the stuff.<eos> Just this once. It's for the baby.<eos> All right, I give up.<eos> I'm tired of fighting you.
It's bumpy, but we'll be past it in a few minutes.<eos> We're now flying over Hoover Dam, and later we'll pass south of the Grand Canyon.<eos> Meanwhile, relax and enjoy your flight, OK?<eos> Chicago, this is flight 209er.<eos> We're in trouble.<eos> We need traffic below us cleared and priority landing in Chicago.<eos> Yes?<eos> My husband's very sick.<eos> Can you do something?<eos> The doctor will be with you in just a moment.
I wanted you to know... now... I'm very proud.<eos> Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.<eos> The gear is down, and we're ready to land.<eos> He's on final now.<eos> Put out all runway lights except niner.<eos> Captain, maybe we ought to turn on the searchlights.<eos> No.<eos> That's just what they'll be expecting us to do.<eos> I want to tell you both good luck.<eos> We're all counting on you.
Keep your eyes on the far end of the runway.<eos> You're too low, damn it!<eos> Watch your stall speed.<eos> Flare it out!<eos> Ease her down.<eos> Down!<eos> The brake!<eos> Pull the red handle!<eos> I want to tell you both good luck.<eos> We're all counting on you.
Pull out of it!<eos> Push that button!<eos> Gate 13... Gate 14.<eos> Gate 15...<eos> Auntie Em!<eos> Toto!<eos> It's a twister!<eos> Gate 23, 24, 25...<eos> I want to tell you both good luck.<eos> We're all counting on you.
That seats 5,000.<eos> You guys fii Il that place, you can make 5,000 bucks, easy.<eos> - Book us for tomorrow night.<eos> - Hold it!<eos> Tomorrow night?<eos> A gig like that, you gotta prepare the proper exploitation.<eos> I know about that stuff.<eos> I been exploited all my life.<eos> Forget it.<eos> There's no way with you guys.
You're all hung up.<eos> Hey there, I'll cut you loose. Let go there.<eos> Oh, there you go!<eos> You're free!<eos> You have a new record.<eos> I didn't know massage parlors were like that, man. ♪<eos> Goddamn, that was fun!<eos> Why don't you wait for me?<eos> Where are ya going?<eos> Can I go with you?
Get over there and sit down now.<eos> Thank you, baby.<eos> Smile.<eos> Aw, beautiful.<eos> That's just beautiful.<eos> That's it, babe.<eos> Put the backdrop back on the bed.<eos> Are you and Daddy going out again tonight, Mama?<eos> Yes, honey, I've got to sing over in Lynden.<eos> Can I go with you?
You did it!<eos> - Luke, we're ready for take-off.<eos> - Good luck, Lando.<eos> When we find Jabba the Hutt and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.<eos> I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on Tatooine.<eos> Princess, we'll find Han.<eos> I promise.<eos> Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal.<eos> Take care, you two.<eos> May the Force be with you.
Well, we'll just go right down there and disabuse them of that notion.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> They'd cut you down before you had a chance to open your mouth.<eos> We don't know how many of them there are.<eos> We've got to do something.<eos> Yeah, beat a hasty retreat back to the plane, where there's a little armor between them and us.<eos> Come on.<eos> Watch it, Bobby.<eos> Are we supposed to hide in here forever, Mr. Dugan?<eos> What's the matter with you people?
- What was it?<eos> - Someone get shot?<eos> - How'd she get in? - You there!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Dumb bastards!<eos> You could've been killed!<eos> You aren't hurt?<eos> It's all right!<eos> No harm done!<eos> I'll be right with you!
- Slave?<eos> - Wife.<eos> - The same.<eos> - Heavy Eagle.<eos> He beat you some, huh?<eos> Where'd you learn American?<eos> Fort McKenzie.<eos> In the summer we trade beaver there.<eos> You learned good.<eos> I go with you.
Come on, let's go!<eos> Get away from here!<eos> Our victory is complete!<eos> The son of Jor-El has fled.<eos> Superman fled?<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> - The next time we will kill him!<eos> - The next time?<eos> The next time?<eos> What am I going to do with you people?
Adama, you can't.<eos> Do it.<eos> If we have Adama, they might have second thoughts about attacking us.<eos> Yes. Yes, they might.<eos> Very well, Adama, one more centare - in exchange for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Not so funny now, is it?<eos> Adama... As soon as the Cylons are in the landing bay, they'll move to their ships.<eos> - Then I'll contact you. - This is suicide.
Did you hear what the Council voted yet?<eos> It condemns them to spending the rest of their lives in these chambers.<eos> - If they live at all.<eos> - Apollo. - All clear?<eos> - Ls what all clear? - Starbuck...<eos> - Buddy, this is no time to be subtle.<eos> Subtle about what?<eos> We're taking your patients.<eos> You're not serious.<eos> Starbuck, do you know what they can do to you?
I've already spied on you through the keyhole.<eos> Minou!<eos> The village isn't far, is it?<eos> They told me it was 2 miles before the rivers meet.<eos> Just 2 miles, but it's 20 centuries from here.<eos> Daniel, what are you doing, where are you going?<eos> - To the Kuma village.<eos> - Did you talk to Joshua?<eos> Relax, I've got your boss's permission.<eos> I'll come with you.
Somebody should have told us!<eos> This is the devil's work.<eos> - What'd he say?<eos> - Says the boat is gone.<eos> Mister, what'd you just say about the boat to San Francisco?<eos> - Gone!<eos> - Well, that can't be.<eos> That boat's supposed to leave first tide in the morning!<eos> Supposed to?<eos> What the hell's the matter with you?
- Show me.<eos> - Me?<eos> Oh, I'm not a very good dancer.<eos> - Do you feel joy?<eos> - Yes, I do, very much.<eos> Then show me, please.<eos> Dance with my people.<eos> Well, I'll take a crack!<eos> No!<eos> I want him to dance with you.
How did they receive God's word...<eos> Hold the thief. Hold the thief.<eos> What is it, my son?<eos> Someone stole a can of oil from my gas station.<eos> Oil?<eos> Where is he?<eos> He hid in the chapel.<eos> - Let's have a look then.<eos> In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<eos> May the mercy of Jesus Christ, the love of God the Father and the unity of the Holy Spirit forever be with you.
Whaddaya want?<eos> - Keys.<eos> - No.<eos> - Hey, come on.<eos> - Come on, Steve, cool out, baby.<eos> - Come on.<eos> You're taking the car?<eos> - Just for a few days.<eos> Coming with us?<eos> No, I'm not going with you.
We're all crazy.<eos> Let's shake on it.<eos> Let's not.<eos> Come on!<eos> Attention!<eos> Stand at ease!<eos> If all you men could be standing where l'm standing, and seeing what I'm seeing, you'd know how it feels to be truly proud of our country.<eos> The United States Army is the greatest fighting force in the world.<eos> And now you men are going to be thousands of miles away from home in a few days, and you'd better take some of that greatness with you.<eos> And this afternoon, while you're on leave, you'd better take some with you, too.
Move like you got a purpose.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you, soldier?<eos> Didn't you hear what the Captain said?<eos> Get your bag packed!<eos> Get your helmet!<eos> Get your pistol belt! Get it right now!<eos> Let's move like you got a purpose.<eos> Get the doggone coat on!<eos> Quickly!<eos> What's the matter with you troops?
We'll approach from the east.<eos> We'll have the sun at our backs and in their eyes.<eos> How come he says "we"?<eos> He's not going.<eos> We're we.<eos> We expect light to moderate flak.<eos> We'll approach from 12,000.<eos> Cloud cover at 6 to 8000.<eos> We'll drop at 6000.<eos> -I wish I were going with you.
Packman, second.<eos> You've got cloud cover from 8 to 10,000. Make the drop at 6000.<eos> I know what it's gonna be like, so be careful.<eos> He flew 100 missions over Texas and he knows what it's gonna be like.<eos> We should have 5- to 10-mile visibility below 8000.<eos> Approach from south to north.<eos> Nobody ever took Texas while he was there.<eos> Takeoff is at 0830.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I wish I could've gone with you.
We can't make it without you.<eos> I already have problems.<eos> Don't you give me any more.<eos> Hey, wait, we wouldn't dare cause you trouble, my friend.<eos> If I do any wrong, I'll change my name to Rotten Egg.<eos> Right, and you can break my iron head any time that you like.<eos> Hey, you've nothing to lose.<eos> Come with us and meet our boss.<eos> Right.<eos> Oh, then maybe I'll come along with you.
They say civilian people, we can save people, you know.<eos> Give them mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You know what I mean, cause if I'm walking down the street and I see some mother fucker laid all out and slobber and shit hanging out of his mouth, he ain't gonna make it.<eos> You know what I mean? I'm gonna say, say bro,<eos> I don't think you're gonna make it, unless you can get somebody to wipe that shit off your mouth.<eos> Right, cause you could be giving somebody mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and they die, and death ease down your lungs.<eos> Death don't give a fuck where it goes.<eos> And if they can get two for one, that's a good day for death.<eos> And if you ever have to go to the hospital, which I hope you never do, carry your own piss with you, cause that's what they want.
This is it!<eos> It's the same as ours.<eos> Look at it, lad.<eos> A ramping, great, big lion with a castle on top.<eos> There's no denying it, girl.<eos> Mrs. D'Urberville recognized her own flesh and blood.<eos> But she never even saw me.<eos> Well, you couldn't expect her to throw her arms round your neck her being an invalid. But her son made you welcome.<eos> He called you "cousin," didn't he?<eos> I'd rather bide here with you.
I hope we have your blessing, Commander.<eos> My dear, you not only have my blessing, you have the blessings of the Lords of Kobol.<eos> - Congratulations, my son.<eos> - Thank you, Father.<eos> You've made a father very happy.<eos> Well, as best man, I've got to see to the groom's sendoff preparations.<eos> Going to be a real bash.<eos> Thanks for the food.<eos> I hate to run.<eos> Pleasure dining with you.
Stand by to attack.<eos> This is going to be a classic defeat, spoken of throughout the star system for 1 ,000 yahrens.<eos> Launch fighters.<eos> Incoming communication from Commander Cain, sir.<eos> Put it on the line.<eos> I'm resuming command of the Pegasus.<eos> So I've been informed by Commander Adama.<eos> Get that ship out of there.<eos> Swing on a 180 and follow course 1-1-0.<eos> I'll rendezvous with you.
- I didn't think you'd get around to it.<eos> - Neither did I.<eos> I hope we have your blessing, Commander.<eos> My dear, you not only have my blessing, you have the blessings of the Lords of Kobol.<eos> - Congratulations, my son.<eos> - Thank you, Father.<eos> Going to be a real bash.<eos> Thanks for the food.<eos> I hate to run.<eos> Pleasure dining with you.
Starlos isn't far.<eos> We can pick up food and water and fuel.<eos> Are you with us, or are you going to turn your back on freedom again?<eos> I could not shoot down a Colonial warrior.<eos> Oh, yes, I know - the code, the bloodline.<eos> And for all your compassion, they chained you like an animal!<eos> Now is your chance! Our chance.<eos> One last time, my husband.<eos> Are you with us?<eos> I'm with you.
He was a little part of us.<eos> And we're gonna miss him.<eos> Leroy, get up!<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Lets go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> - I can't stay with you anymore.
Don't you know what you must do?<eos> Hold your head high<eos> Take a deep breath and sigh<eos> Come on, Sandy.<eos> Goodbye to Sandra Dee<eos> Attention, seniors.<eos> Before the merriment of commencement commences, I hope that your years with us here at Rydell High have prepared you for the challenges you face.<eos> Who knows, among you, there may be a future Eleanor Roosevelt, or a Rosemary Clooney.<eos> And among you young men, there may be a Joe DiMaggio, a President Eisenhower or even a Vice President Nixon.<eos> But always you will have the glorious memories of Rydell High.
- Any time you want.<eos> I'll pick you up...<eos> My dad would kill me if he knew I was going to a frat house.<eos> Okay if I meet you there?<eos> Is it okay?<eos> It's terrific!<eos> Girls, welcome to the Delta toga party. Come in.<eos> Let me take your coat.<eos> Great pair of togas.<eos> Have some delicious Delta punch, and I'll join you in a minute.
How we know he coming?<eos> All them years he been gone, and no word.<eos> He coming back because he say he gonna come back.<eos> Your dad ain't never said nothing in his life he don't mean. Hear me?<eos> Just asking, Mama.<eos> I don't want to hear no more about leaving.<eos> Ain't nobody going nowhere till my man come back.<eos> We is a family and we is gonna stay a family.<eos> Tom?<eos> Martha and me sure would like to throw our lot in with you.
200 dollars to bust up a couple of cops in uniform seems stingy to me.<eos> It'll be our first offense you understand?<eos> You heard the judge.<eos> What if we throw in some good stuff with the 200 bucks?<eos> What do we do to 'em huh?<eos> Just put 'em in a wheelchair for six months.<eos> He's on the war path.<eos> [Radio Voice] Headquarters calling 3211, headquarters calling 3211, 3211 come in please.<eos> 3211 is all ears.<eos> [Radio Voice] Hold on boys, McBride wants to speak to you.
So long.<eos> The tiger cub is a real SOB and the good dragon is a sucker.<eos> That's it.<eos> Now that we finished casting one big shadow, I'm splitting.<eos> Too bad, we made a good team.<eos> What about the car, do I keep it?<eos> Oh no, we sell it.<eos> We go half and half.<eos> [Radio Voice] Attention all units 16th District,<eos> Attention all units 16th District, Captain McBride wants to speak to you.
Are we the first?<eos> Are we the first to arrive here?<eos> Is the interpreter with you?
Hello?<eos> Mr Togo?<eos> What's happened?<eos> Fanta's crying!<eos> - We'll miss the train!<eos> The injury is not bad.<eos> But I have to see the doctor first!<eos> What?<eos> Only one bus a day?<eos> Then I'll follow you with the buggy!
Well, would you guys come with me, please? Uh-huh.<eos> What do you do here? Am I gonna get a shot?<eos> Hush now, BJ.<eos> Oh, come on now, BJ, would I do that to you?<eos> Then what's all this stuff for?<eos> Well, I'll tell you. Now, this is our research laboratory.<eos> And what we're trying to figure out here is just how strong the human body can be.<eos> Hey, my mama's real strong.<eos> Once she saved my life.<eos> Yes, I know, and that's what we want to talk to you about.
- Yeah.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I'll play for him.<eos> I won't audition.<eos> OK.<eos> Oh, Jimmy.<eos> Jimmy, come on.<eos> Jay, it's slippery. We don't want to slide into town. We want to drive in.<eos> Leave me alone. I'm napping.<eos> - I'm glad I'm working for you.
Penny? Penny?<eos> - Yes? - Penny.<eos> Penny, dear, now don't cry.<eos> We are here to help you.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where'd you come from?<eos> We found the bottle with your message, and we've come to rescue you.<eos> Did you hear that, Teddy?<eos> Our bottle worked!<eos> Didn't you bring somebody big with you? Like the police?
The target area is only two meters wide.<eos> It's a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port.<eos> The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.<eos> A precise hit will start a chain reaction... which should destroy the station.<eos> Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.<eos> The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.<eos> That's impossible, even for a computer.<eos> No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-16 back home.<eos> They're not much bigger than two meters.<eos> Then man your ships, and may the Force be with you.
- Do you want us to enter?<eos> - In a moment.<eos> What's up?<eos> I'm not very good at things like this.<eos> I've known you, especially Colonel Brubaker, for some time.<eos> What you're about to do today, I've spent my life.<eos> I'd just like yuh to know that I feel that all I've ever worked for, it has meaning today, and I'm very proud.<eos> Proud of the program and proud of what I've been able to contribute in some small way, and<eos> proud of you.<eos> I'd like for you to take this Bible with you, from me, from all of us.
We are not your enemy.<eos> Please, wait here.<eos> I suppose you're wondering why I called you up here.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Hi there, Dr. Kelloway, nice to see you.<eos> A funny thing happened on the way to Mars.<eos> Well, why don't you all sit down?<eos> Well.<eos> Okay, here it is.<eos> I have to start by saying that if there was any other way, if there was even a slight chance of another alternative, I would give anything not to be here with you now, anything.
We are awaiting the start of the final television transmissions from the Command Module on its return to Earth.<eos> This is specifically a conversation between the crew and their wives.<eos> This is the first time the crew has been close enough to Earth to make normal conversation feasible.<eos> This is Capricorn Control.<eos> Capricorn One, this is Houston.<eos> Capricorn One, this is Houston.<eos> Roger, Houston, this is Capricorn One.<eos> Houston, do you have a picture?<eos> Roger, Capricorn, we have a picture.<eos> We have three anxious ladies here who would like to talk to you.
I'm going to write to him at once.<eos> Meanwhile, order the Guards onto the streets!<eos> Marcus.<eos> Marcus!<eos> Oh, it's been too long, too long.<eos> I wouldn't have had it so.<eos> Marcus, what silly things get in the way of friendship.<eos> - You could have come sooner.<eos> - How could I have come?<eos> I'd have come to you.
Good bye.<eos> Read Julius' commentaries on his campaign in Britain.<eos> - I've read it twice.<eos> - So have I. Goodbye.<eos> Don't move the tokens while I'm gone.<eos> I know where they are.<eos> They're good boys.<eos> We'll have need of them one day.<eos> Come and walk with me in the garden a moment.<eos> - Is Antonia travelling with you?
Get a move on.<eos> Do nothing until you hear from me.<eos> I shall arrange a meeting between you and members of the Senate, but in the palace.<eos> But make your mind up to it, Claudius.<eos> For good or ill. they've made you Emperor.<eos> If you don't accept, you won't survive - or any of your family.<eos> If you do nothing else, accept.<eos> At least for the time being.<eos> Senators, I understand you d-d-do not want another Emperor. But it seams you've b-bean given one.<eos> I sympathise with you.
I'm going to marry you... to Uncle Claudius! And you can both come and live in the palace.<eos> Thank you, Caesar.<eos> And now I must away to shed more light.<eos> Oh, Cassius!<eos> The watchword for tonight. "Bottoms up!"<eos> I give you another watchword - "Liberty."<eos> I'm s-s-sorry.<eos> Don't you want to marry me?<eos> it's j-just that I'm so much older than you.<eos> I'd be very happy to be married to you.
Oh, Cassius!<eos> The watchword for tonight. "Bottoms up!"<eos> I give you another watchword - "Liberty."<eos> I'm s-s-sorry.<eos> Don't you want to marry me?<eos> it's j-just that I'm so much older than you.<eos> I'd be very happy to be married to you.<eos> To tell you the truth, I was terrified when he brought me here.<eos> I thought he was going to...<eos> I'd feel safe being married to you.
Why am I so unlucky today!<eos> Unless of course it's your dice I'm playing with.<eos> My dice? Why should my dice be different from any other?<eos> .<eos> A dice is a very personal thing. One man's dice may be lucky for him, but not for his friend.<eos> Here, Lord, try these.<eos> They were sent to me by Herod.<eos> He claims they once belonged to Alexander the G-Great.<eos> Really? . I'd no idea that Alexander played dice.<eos> He had many things in common with you, Lord.
- Do you sleep together?<eos> - Now and then.<eos> I must admit, it's a bit of an ordeal.<eos> Her face is not unpleasant.<eos> I rarely see her face.<eos> I never get up that far!<eos> Oh, Claudius!<eos> Dear brother.<eos> It is good to see you again.<eos> I wish I could have come with you.
- No, I won't.<eos> If I can become Emperor, you can certainly become the Queen of Heaven! (HE LAUGHS)<eos> Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus!<eos> Claudius, dear fellow.<eos> How nice to see you.<eos> I w-was on my way to see Castor.<eos> I'm told he's v-very bad.<eos> Yes, but he'll recover, I'm sure.<eos> Your sister is taking care of him.<eos> Actually, I wanted to have a word with you.
It's settled on her lungs.<eos> She's sinking fast.<eos> She's asked to see you.<eos> Well, are you going to sit there all night?<eos> I hear you're dying, Great Grandmother.<eos> You won't forget your promise, will you?<eos> To make you a goddess?<eos> What makes you think a smelly old woman could become a goddess?<eos> I don't need you any more, you see, Great Grandmother.<eos> My secret will die with you.
- Drusilla? Your sister?<eos> At your age?<eos> What is the world coming to?<eos> - He doesn't mean it.<eos> - He's been too long in the East.<eos> Syria is no place to bring up a Roman child.<eos> - I don't like it here.<eos> - You'll have to get used to it.<eos> What was so wonderful about the East?<eos> Herod Agrippa is talking to you, child!
Oh, I could eat you.<eos> - Here comes your brother.<eos> - Postumus.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Have you lost something?<eos> No.<eos> Are you going back to Rome?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - May I come with you?
Off you go.<eos> That child should have been exposed at birth.<eos> - We don't do that anymore.<eos> - More's the pity.<eos> He twitches, stutters and limps.<eos> Even his mother can't stand him.<eos> Well, he's quite harmless.<eos> He gets on my nerves.<eos> He talks to himself and irritates people.<eos> - I want to talk to you.
Banish her for life.<eos> Don't tell me where she's gone or mention her name.<eos> But let her...! Let her be all alone.<eos> All alone until she dies!<eos> She's not fit for human company!<eos> (SCREAMING) Father!<eos> Father!<eos> Please!<eos> Please let me in!<eos> Let me talk to you!
Father!<eos> Please! Please don't send me away!<eos> Please, please, please don't send me away!<eos> I couldn't bear it!<eos> I couldn't bear it!<eos> Not alone. Please!<eos> Plea-ea-ease!<eos> Please!<eos> Please, Father!<eos> Please let me talk to you!
No.<eos> He pestered you, I suppose, and you gave in.<eos> - What frail creatures we women are.<eos> - He always wanted me.<eos> And you always enjoyed teasing him.<eos> Yes, you did, I've seen it.<eos> I swear to you I won't do it again.<eos> Yes, well, let's not be in too much of a hurry to swear anything.<eos> My dear, I must talk to you like a grown woman now.<eos> Can I talk to you?
Marcellus?<eos> Agrippa?<eos> What is he saying?<eos> What is he, some kind of raving lunatic?<eos> Does he think that they were all murdered?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Or is just that you want me to think you are?<eos> Yes!<eos> You're very clever.<eos> You think that by pretending to be mad that I'll be lenient with you.
Alpha. Is it still there?<eos> Is it manned?<eos> '<eos> (Eagle 1) 'Moonbase Alpha is operational.'<eos> We'd be more operational if I knew about that gravity pull. Any data?<eos> No.<eos> I'll check if it's a real gravity threat, or if our computer's developed a fault.<eos> 'Swift to Moonbase Alpha, Swift to Moonbase Alpha, hello there!<eos> 'Listen, guys, I haven't seen anybody for so long I'd given up.<eos> 'Tell you what, can I come and have lunch with you?
And for the present, I will permit you... minimum life support power.<eos> It will be necessary for two of you to come to Vega.<eos> - Because it is required.<eos> I told you, we mean you no harm.<eos> - Then unlock our systems.<eos> - Commander, I've given you enough life support for you to survive for 48 hours.<eos> You have already wasted precious minutes.<eos> You expect us to stand by while you drain our atmosphere?<eos> You will not interfere with our plans.<eos> Don't interfere with us and we will not interfere with you.
- Where do you think you're going?<eos> Out to get what we came here for.<eos> We've got bigger things to worry us now.<eos> Look, I...<eos> But I can't do your job.<eos> I'm the geologist and you can't do mine.<eos> And Alpha needs that milgonite.<eos> Maya... I am sorry about Tony.<eos> Alan, keep him company.<eos> I'll be right with you.
Come in, Alpha!<eos> Only Magus's power is holding this planet together against the pull of our moon.<eos> Koenig to Alpha!<eos> Come in, Alpha!<eos> Koenig to Alpha!<eos> John!<eos> John!<eos> The mutants!<eos> You get aboard the Eagle.<eos> I'll meet you there!
I was once in a high-school game where the score...<eos> Come on, guys. It's only a game.<eos> Nice try.<eos> Maybe next time you'll get a chance to bat.<eos> Hey, Tanner!<eos> Come down, Tanner.<eos> Get down from there.<eos> Forget about that.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I want to talk to you.
Stein, get back in here!<eos> - Goddamn it, you stupid...<eos> - Yankees two, Bears two.<eos> Everybody, sit down.<eos> Come on.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Sit down, Engelberg.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Next time I tell you to do something, goddamn it... you do it or else you're off this team.<eos> And the rest of you, what's the matter with you?
I know I'm not crazy.<eos> But every day, I have to come here, watch this clown show, man.<eos> Sometimes... (INHALING DEEPLY)<eos> I just can't take it.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey, look, hey, it's gonna be all right.<eos> We'll work it out...<eos> Together.<eos> ANNOUNCER: All right! This is J.J. Jackson, the prince of darkness, coming to you in the night time, 'cause you know it's the right time.
Hey doc! We sure fooled them, ha?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Don't be forgetting. We got to make it back.<eos> Come on!<eos> Get me those reins.<eos> The three Shannons.<eos> The terrors of the west.<eos> And you think you go inherit the legend of your father.<eos> Why you three yellow-belly cowards couldn't even take care of one half-breed?<eos> He wiped the countryside with you.
She brought me here because I begged her to help me.<eos> - He's lying.<eos> - No Sandman ever ran.<eos> You don't run.<eos> You kill runners.<eos> You have always killed runners.<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> But now it's my turn.<eos> And I find I want to live.<eos> What's the matter with you?
- Lf you'd kept out they'd be here now.<eos> You think it's you he wants?<eos> It's me.<eos> It's John and me.<eos> - He's in his castle waiting.<eos> - Take me to Nottingham.<eos> - No, not you, we're going.<eos> - I'll walk if I have to.<eos> Take her to camp.<eos> We'll join you later.
- But that was the bell, wasn't it?<eos> - No! - He means the drill hasn't started yet.<eos> - What drill?<eos> We didn't hear a drill.<eos> - No, no, look, look.<eos> That was the burglar alarm.<eos> - See! - The burglar alarm?<eos> - Yes! - Are there burglars?<eos> - Evidently.<eos> No, what's the matter with you all?
Leave me alone.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Commander!<eos> 'The alien's escaped from security.'<eos> He's in assembly area D.<eos> Security, assembly area D.<eos> Alan.<eos> Use the kill ray.<eos> Please, I must... talk to you.
When immortality is coming in a shoal.<eos> Live in a house, and it'll never fall.<eos> To any of the centuries I'd nod<eos> And enter it, a house I'd install.<eos> That's why with me your children share board,<eos> Your wives join me at my table, and all.<eos> One table serves both granddad and grandchild:<eos> The future's being made right now.<eos> Whenever I'm to raise my hand in tide,<eos> I all five rays of it on you bestow.
Do you think there's anything wrong with your mind, really?<eos> Not a thing, Doc.<eos> I'm a goddamn marvel of modern science.<eos> You're going to be here for a period, for us to evaluate you.<eos> We're going to study you.<eos> We'll make our determinations as to what we're going to do... and give you the necessary treatment as indicated.<eos> Doc, let me just tell you this.<eos> I'm here to cooperate with you 100 percent.<eos> 100 percent.<eos> I'll be just right down the line with you.
They can go back to the schedule after the Series.<eos> I'm talking about the World Series, Nurse Ratched.<eos> Well, anyway, this is no way to proceed about this.<eos> How would it be if we had a vote, and let the majority rule?<eos> Great.<eos> Let's vote on it.<eos> So, all those in favor raise your hands.<eos> Okay, guys, come on.<eos> Put your hands up.<eos> What's the matter with you?
Get your hands up.<eos> It can do you some good... to get some exercise, putting your arms up in the air.<eos> That's it.<eos> Come on, let's...<eos> What is this crap?<eos> I watch the Series.<eos> I haven't missed the Series in years.<eos> Even in the cooler.<eos> When I'm in the cooler they run it there or they'll have a riot.<eos> What's the matter with you guys?
Rinaldo, take a look. Take a good look.<eos> Claudio, Bruno, you too.<eos> My turn, Efisio!<eos> On Perati Bridge<eos> A black flag flies:<eos> The mourning of the Julian regiment that goes to war.<eos> The best of youth lie under the earth.<eos> Graziella, Doris, Renata, and all the others!<eos> Down! Get them down!<eos> The gentlemen are not satisfied with you.
I'm glad you bought it.<eos> - So am I. - So am I.<eos> " Pride goeth before a fall"<eos> I'll just take it back, and see if Mr. Oleson will give me the money on it.<eos> Now Caroline, Why do you think the good Lord went to all that trouble of making you so pretty, if he didn't want you to have a new blue dress?<eos> You'll be beautiful ma'!<eos> I can't wait until everyone sees you.<eos> They're going to think they're looking at a piece of heaven!<eos> If they don't think that already, I can't say much for their judgment, or their eyesight.<eos> What am I going to do with you!
The cost this expedition?<eos> We had that store many provisions ...<eos> Kwei Ping is very far.<eos> I suppose perhaps 10,000 U.S. dollars Chinese, Madam.<eos> - - They are yours.<eos> - - What?<eos> I financiarei the journey to this village ...<eos> -- ... with a condition. -<eos> - And what is it?<eos> Let me take you.
Then Zed will be terminated.<eos> The monster is a mirror, and when we look at him, we look into our own hidden faces.<eos> Meditate on this at second level.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I will... I will not go to second level.<eos> I will... I will not go to second level with you!<eos> I will...<eos> No!<eos> I will not be one mind with you!
"Four score and seven years ago... "... our forefathers brought forth on this..."<eos> Are you coming back?<eos> In a moment, dear.<eos> Gentlemen, affairs of state must take precedent over the affairs of state.<eos> Yes, of course, sir, we understand.<eos> Will you make all the arrangements?<eos> I will make all the arrangements.<eos> Especially the funeral.<eos> Good luck, good luck, boys.<eos> Wonderful working with you.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe I can. Where's your husband?<eos> He's out at a convention.<eos> When will he be back?<eos> Not until late.<eos> April fool!<eos> Just a little joke, folks.<eos> - That shows you the possibilities... - Larry Peterson... - of the Moran S-15.<eos> - Larry Peterson Burns. Thank you. The demonstration is concluded.<eos> I'd like you to take a little literature with you on your way.
That ain't it.<eos> If she cashes in her investment, whole thing'll collapse.<eos> General Motors, the Pentagon, the two-party system and the whole shebang.<eos> Arnold, what is he saying to you?<eos> That's it. We're all running downhill.<eos> Gotta keep running faster or we'll fall down.<eos> Arnold, what was he saying to you?<eos> Arnold? What did he say to you?<eos> Did he insult you?<eos> I don't wish to be forward but we'd like to exchange cars with you.
Get it?<eos> Abrasion of the left testicle.<eos> It took 3 stitches.<eos> The bullet missed the artery...<eos> He sure was lucky.<eos> We're always lucky.<eos> Incredibly lucky.<eos> The golden touch.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> I was worried about you.
Hey, you've got a watch on.<eos> Will you tell me the time?<eos> I'll go get some of those chains on your shoes.<eos> Big deal. Geez louise.<eos> Do you have the time, please?<eos> 'Cause I'm wait -<eos> Hey, listen, you birds. I'm waitin' for my kids at school.<eos> Do you mind giving me the time?<eos> Do ya?<eos> What's the matter with you?
Hold him, boys!<eos> Stop it!<eos> You gonna finish the dance?<eos> - The dance is over.<eos> - You got all them veils left.<eos> The dance is over!<eos> Then I guess I'm just gonna have to keep on pouring.<eos> He has done you no harm.<eos> Let him go.<eos> I do not wish to fight you.
Hello.<eos> ...<eos> Uncle Jacob? No, it's Solomon.<eos> Did you have a good voyage?<eos> No, I did not have a good voyage.<eos> I had a very bad voyage!<eos> - Where are you? - At Orly!<eos> 30 years I haven't been to Paris and the police picks up!<eos> It's all in order, Chief.<eos> - Thanks. What's with you people?
Boy, this is old Abe Fraser.<eos> Danny, tell him that ain't necessary.<eos> There's your share of the money, Mr. Fraser.<eos> Three-fifths.<eos> About $12,000.<eos> That ain't right, Danny.<eos> The usual way, the proper way, is for the leader to make the split.<eos> It all works out the same way but one likes to observe the proprieties.<eos> You understand.<eos> - You got the rest of the money with you?
What is this?<eos> - The place is under emergency- - Get out!<eos> Now, hold on, fellas.<eos> Just what's going on here?<eos> It's the lights!<eos> Where's Mommy?<eos> My mother!<eos> Get out!<eos> It's my mother!<eos> Tell me what this is all about, and maybe I'll cooperate with you!
Thank you, my love.<eos> The Madonna by Antonio Rizzo in about 1490.<eos> The grille work is also by Rizzo.<eos> Note the flowers woven into...<eos> Jesus!<eos> - You hypocrite!<eos> The bishop!<eos> I'm an hour and a half late!<eos> In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.<eos> May the mercy and love of our Father and the peace of the Holy Spirit be with you.
She's responsible for the polio contributions on the base.<eos> Every year, they give her a plaque.<eos> Meadows comes and fucks over charity.<eos> She took it very seriously.<eos> - Jesus!<eos> - Eight years, that's very seriously.<eos> - Know what I mean?<eos> - Well, good duty for you guys.<eos> You get to go to Washington, New York Boston.<eos> I'd trade places with you.
Uptown, James.<eos> Come on, you guys.<eos> Hurry up. Where are we gonna go?<eos> Michael, give us a lift.<eos> Get outta here.<eos> Get the fuck outta here!<eos> Hey, get outta here!<eos> You're startin' to make too much noise. Let me in.<eos> I'm standin' out here in the rain.<eos> What's the matter with you guys?
- You know what that is, scrupIes?<eos> - No.<eos> But if you've got them, it's a sure bet they belong to somebody else.<eos> And his name ain't Frank!<eos> It's franklin!<eos> Hey there, I wondered where you got to.<eos> Where's your pa?<eos> - Is my picture ready? - Sure.<eos> Excuse me, folks.<eos> Sit back in the moon there. I'II be right with you.
Good answer.<eos> Clara!<eos> Clara!<eos> Clara!<eos> So, will you give her to me?<eos> I think you have lost her.<eos> Clara!<eos> Marcelo!<eos> Marcelo!<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be with you.
I think you have lost her.<eos> Clara!<eos> Marcelo!<eos> Marcelo!<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be with you.<eos> Blessed be You among women.<eos> Blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.<eos> Hail Mary, mother of God, beseech us poor sinners.<eos> Now and at the hour of our death, Amen.<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be with you.
We were barely out 20 minutes.<eos> They had enough to drink.<eos> You don't just leave like that!<eos> Why not stop them?<eos> They looked scared.<eos> They ran out.<eos> - Scared?<eos> - Scared of what?<eos> I'm Your Monsignor Dufour, bishop of this diocese.<eos> I'd like to speak with you.
I feel that Watson and I must go to London.<eos> London?<eos> I think we will be more useful there at this present juncture.<eos> Excuse me. Might I have some fresh coffee?<eos> Certainly sir.<eos> But I thought you were going to see me through this business?<eos> Trust me my dear fellow.<eos> I do.<eos> Tell Stapleton that I would have been happy to come with you but the urgent business requires me to be in town.<eos> I don't understand should I not come with you to London?
We'll give up karate.<eos> Let's learn from Ah Lung.<eos> Right!<eos> Customers! Come quick!<eos> Change, on the double!<eos> Ah Lung, no, Master, Master I have to go take care the customer.<eos> We'll talk later.<eos> Is there anything for me to do?<eos> Watch out for those villains.<eos> My boss wants to see you!
You want that?<eos> Cool.<eos> Give me my money and time to get out of your way.<eos> - I'll let you crazy mothers shoot at each other.<eos> - He's right, Pete.<eos> You're fuckin' "A" right, I'm right.<eos> Now, which is it?<eos> You guys meet, or give me my money and I'll split.<eos> We're not goin' to him.<eos> And he's not comin' to you.
Listen, Francesco. Out of the way!<eos> Francesco, when you're in Perugia, don't forget DeGoli's storerooms behind the marketplace.<eos> - He's as rich as the Pope.<eos> - Yes, leave it to me.<eos> Remember the cathedral triptych.<eos> It'll save us a fortune in indulgences.<eos> Yes. War is beautiful.<eos> This is my death mask.<eos> Go forth, sons of Assisi.<eos> God is with you!
Or a foot to his height?<eos> Consider how the lilies grow in the fields.<eos> They do not work nor spin.<eos> Yet even Solomon, in all his splendour, was not attired like one of these.<eos> How little faith you have.<eos> You ask, "What are we to eat?<eos> "What are we to drink?<eos> What are we to wear?"<eos> When all these things are for the pagans to run after, not for you.<eos> Set your mind on God's kingdom and His justice before everything else,and all the rest will come to you as well.
Something for the lady friend? Nylons?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - Petrol coupons? - Chocs for the little 'uns?<eos> - No.<eos> How about one of these, mate? Fell off the back of a lorry.<eos> - Be a good chap and run away. - Would you fancy this, then?<eos> Now you have my undivided attention.<eos> - What can I do for you?<eos> - Get over to the Bookman right away.<eos> He wants to see you.
That ridiculous contraption actually seems to work, Q.<eos> You've surpassed yourself this time.<eos> Not a bit of it.<eos> Made one of these for the kids last Christmas.<eos> Maxwell, James and I will head for the house.<eos> Get set to hit the penthouse as soon as we find Whyte.<eos> Let me speak to Metz.<eos> There's been a change.<eos> Push all plans forward by 24 hours.<eos> I'm joining you immediately.
- Ride you this afternoon?<eos> - Ay, my lord.<eos> Is it far you ride?<eos> As far as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper.<eos> - Fail not our feast.<eos> - My lord, I will not.<eos> We hear our bloody cousins are in England and Ireland not confessing their cruel parricide.<eos> But of that tomorrow. Hie you to horse.<eos> Adieu till you return at night.<eos> - Goes Fleance with you?
- Attend those men our leisure?<eos> - They do.<eos> Bring them before us.<eos> To be thus is nothing, but to be safely thus.<eos> Our fears in Banquo stick deep.<eos> In his royalty of nature he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour to act in safety.<eos> There is none but he whose being do I fear.<eos> And under him my genius is rebuked.<eos> We'll keep ourself till suppertime alone.<eos> Till then, God be with you.
And when we confess...<eos> -They hit you?<eos> -We'll see about the monks.<eos> -Really?<eos> Muchos gracias.<eos> This business that bad monks beats up peons bothers you, don't it?<eos> -No, so if you think that I... -No, I didn't think that at all...<eos> It's just that Parker paid us 4000 to close our eyes and the sheriff wants us to stay clear of a bunch of drunken monks...<eos> So, something stinks here.<eos> -May the Lord be with you... -Why?
I'm sorry that Anton isn't here. He's hunting.<eos> Oh, we passed him on the way.<eos> I expect he won't be long.<eos> They're coming now.<eos> Girls, back to your places.<eos> What is there to look at?<eos> You've seen the men coming back from hunting before.<eos> Shall we sit down?<eos> The girls are always happy for any excuse to stop work for a few moments.<eos> I expect you two are just the same.
Look, we killed a mad dog.<eos> One of the shots in his brain was mine.<eos> Would you please go and fetch the Lady Patricia?<eos> She should be here.<eos> We must show these people that we have no fear... any of us.<eos> Burke!<eos> Quiet, everybody!<eos> Silence!<eos> Stop the music!<eos> Sir Edward's going to speak to you.
Well, are you reassured now, Major?<eos> Men of the Seventh!<eos> The hour of victory is at hand!<eos> Onward to Little Bighorn and glory!<eos> We've caught them napping!<eos> Sound the charge!<eos> We have them on the run!<eos> Take no prisoners!<eos> Get off of your knees, men!<eos> Custer's with you! Custer's up!
Yes, please.<eos> is that right?<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> Come on.<eos> You all right?<eos> Keep it straight, eh?<eos> - First the present, then dinner, then a movie.<eos> - You mean all three of you?<eos> - Where I go, Warren goes.<eos> - You don't want me to go with you?
We always have things on our birthdays.<eos> Oh ay, from your own relations, that's different.<eos> No, not just our relations.<eos> They're from all sorts of people in the village.<eos> - And who put'em up to it, I'd like to know.<eos> - We did.<eos> So you've been telling the neighbours that we can't make both ends meet.<eos> Now you've disgraced us as deep as you can in the neighbourhood, you can take that pack of tricks back where it came from.<eos> I'm very much obliged, I'm sure.<eos> I don't doubt that you meant it kind but I'd rather not be acquainted with you any longer, if it's all the same to you.
Hey, Michael!<eos> Michael, darling, show us your fish.<eos> How much does he weigh then, Mike?<eos> How long is it, Michael?<eos> I've never seen a lobster the equal of that.<eos> - Michael, can I touch it?<eos> - Come here and show it to us, Michael.<eos> Michael.<eos> Now what? Now what?<eos> What am I to do with you?
When you turn back to the Mexican group... I'll zap them, and they'll hear you in Spanish.<eos> It'll never work.<eos> Just keep turning back and forth like a lighthouse.<eos> Like everyone else, he'll hear part in English and part in Spanish.<eos> Considering the way he's acted, he'll hear the whole thing in Spanish.<eos> Serve him right.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Do you know you're driving me right out of my skull?<eos> And now, my friends my Norte American friends and my fellow Mexican countrymen Mr. Darrin Stephens will now say a few brief words to us in Spanish and in English.<eos> I'm happy to be here with you, but please forgive...
I wish you'd let me know you were coming, Cousin Henry.<eos> I didn't have time.<eos> It was a sudden case of heartburn.<eos> My heart had a burning desire to pay a family visit.<eos> It's in me, the heart.<eos> I'm afraid we haven't much time.<eos> Tabitha and I are going shopping.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Hinkley's Department Store.<eos> - Well, I'll go with you.
- What?<eos> - My nightie. - Oh.<eos> Mr Tanner!<eos> Well, I fell over her and accidentally pulled it off.<eos> I'm quite sure Barbara's big enough to put it back on herself.<eos> O h, yes, she's big enough, all right.<eos> - Oh. - I mean...<eos> Good night.<eos> You two get to bed.<eos> I'll deal with you in the morning.
Close the door.<eos> I've taught in this city for over 30 years.<eos> I taught some of your parents - your father, MacDowall - in the old slum schools in the city, before they built this fine estate, and this wonderful school.<eos> Things are no better now than they were then.<eos> I just can't understand this generation.<eos> I thought I knew something about young people.<eos> I should be able to, you know, with my experience.<eos> But with you, no.<eos> It just seems a complete waste of money and a waste of time.<eos> And it's a waste of time talking to you now.
Look out!<eos> It's the blancmange!<eos> .<eos> Now this is where Mr. Podgorny could have saved his wife's life.<eos> If he'd gone to the police and told them that he'd been approached by unearthly beings from the galaxy of Andromeda we'd have sent a man round to investigate.<eos> As it was, he did a deal with a blancmange and the blancmange ate his wife.<eos> So if you're going out, or going on holiday or anything strange happens involving other galaxies just nip round to your local police station and tell the sergeant on duty, or his wife, of your suspicions.<eos> And the same goes for dogs.<eos> So I'm sorry to have interrupted your exciting science-fiction story but then, crime's our business, you know.<eos> So carry on viewing, and my thanks to the BBC for allowing me to have this chat with you.
I think he wants to tell you that it was those three white men... Who wanted it to look like Apaches.<eos> And I think my brother wants to tell you something else.<eos> He wants to tell you that I was in on it.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.That I had Evans killed...<eos> Because he was coming here to make the Forge River Valley an Apache reservation.<eos> That's what my brother says.<eos> My brother.<eos> Well, I say that my brother's wrong.<eos> But that's up to you.
They have annihilated each other totally.<eos> My people, all dead?<eos> Yes, Commissioner.<eos> All of them.<eos> - No one alive?<eos> - None at all, sir.<eos> Your band of murderers did this!<eos> Your genocidal maniacs did this!<eos> Stop it!<eos> What's the matter with you two?
Repeat, general quarters, Security Condition 3, intruder alert.<eos> As soon as she has entered the gravity chamber, secure all ports.<eos> Don't touch me, Scotty.<eos> We've lost her to them.<eos> - Stay where you are.<eos> - She could kill us all in this state.<eos> She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has planned.<eos> Stay with us, Mira.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> I want to be with you.
Oh, that's not it.<eos> That's "Anzo." It's "Anzio" we're going to.<eos> Why worry?<eos> They'll spell it right on your white cross.<eos> A-N-Z-I-O.<eos> That's "Anzio," right?<eos> Cellini, tell him how the ginzos pronounce it.<eos> Sorehead.<eos> Where do you write when the battle starts?<eos> Up there on the line with you guys.
I won't tolerate pessimism, inspector.<eos> And...<eos> Unheard of.<eos> "ln view of the bad use to which the government has put the public money, I shall take steps to remove it from circulation.<eos> Signed,<eos> Diabolik."<eos> It's a joke.<eos> And we'll call his bluff!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, our minister of finance.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, this is the first opportunity that I have had of talking to you on the television as your new minister of finance.
Now, by St. Peter's Church and Peter, too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!<eos> So it is concluded.<eos> Son Paris.<eos> How now, wife.<eos> Have you delivered to her our decree?<eos> Ay, sir.<eos> But she will none, she gives you thanks.<eos> I would the fool were married to her grave!<eos> Soft!<eos> Take me with you.
So it is concluded.<eos> Son Paris.<eos> How now, wife.<eos> Have you delivered to her our decree?<eos> Ay, sir.<eos> But she will none, she gives you thanks.<eos> I would the fool were married to her grave!<eos> Soft!<eos> Take me with you.<eos> Take me with you, wife.
I have been chased and run over every rock pile for the past 50 miles.<eos> I saw your wagons, and I knew right there my trials and tribulations were over.<eos> - Anybody with you?<eos> - Nobody, sir. Nobody at all.<eos> - What's your name, son?<eos> - Black Feather, sir.<eos> I was adopted into the Wolf tribe of the Comanche nation.<eos> The Kiowas set up a terrible slaughter on us three days ago.<eos> I escaped.<eos> I'll just travel along with you gentlemen till I get back to my tribe.
- I drank too much last night.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O princess daughter.<eos> I bet you drank too much last night.<eos> - Isn't he a sight for sore eyes?<eos> - Oh, Neddy, we missed you.<eos> Sit down and tell us everything.<eos> - Where are you coming from?<eos> - I was around.<eos> I thought I'd come over and have a swim with you.
The next 20 years ought to be a lulu.<eos> - It's our room!<eos> You'll have to excuse me.<eos> You go right down there.<eos> You can say that again.<eos> It's our room!<eos> What are you two boys doing in here?<eos> - It's our room.<eos> - Yeah, room B.<eos> Janette, Colleen, I'm surprised at you.
- Go on.<eos> All hell's gonna break loose.<eos> Thirteen black.<eos> Thirteen black wins again.<eos> Pay it.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> Let's check upstairs.<eos> Right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> ...which we have chosen for our city, Law and Order is the expression of an ideal by which I've lived, well, long before I came to settle here with you.
Well can't it wait till we get to a starbase hospital so they can be checked out by a child specialist?<eos> We're not leaving here until we find out what went on, or what's going on.<eos> Well I won't prevent you questioning them, but it could harm the children if you do.<eos> It could be far worse for them if I don't, and for us too.<eos> Be careful.<eos> - And I got another flavour on top. - After this, we can all play games.<eos> How do you like getting your ice cream out of a computer? - I'll eat some more before bed.<eos> - That was fun.<eos> Well, well, well, you're all having such a good time.<eos> - I think I'll join you. Is that all right?
And first tonight, ladies and gentlemen, a surprise extra.<eos> In the far corner, a pair of highly aggressive barbarians --<eos> Strong, intelligent, with strange ways, and I'm sure full of a lot of surprises.<eos> And facing them, two favorites here from previous encounters,<eos> Achilles and Flavius.<eos> Victory or death?<eos> And for which of them?<eos> Well, ladies and gentlemen, you know as much about that as I do because this is your program.<eos> You name the winner.<eos> I don't mind fighting, but why you?
I've had a full report.<eos> You are not from Zeon.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Where do you come from?<eos> I'll explain when I see the Führer.<eos> What is your business with the Führer?<eos> I'll discuss that only with him. Pig!<eos> You're speaking to the chairman of the party.<eos> That's enough, major.<eos> What were the weapons found on you?
- It's all right.<eos> It's all right, Alexander.<eos> Listen, we haven't given up. And there may be something you can do to help.<eos> - Anything I can do to help, you just tell me. - All right.<eos> Did the Platonians always have this power?<eos> - No, not until we came to this planet.<eos> - Alexander. Is it possible for you to recall how long after you arrived here that their power began to develop?<eos> How could I forget that?<eos> It was exactly six months and 14 days after we got here that they started pushing me around.<eos> Would you know how many months' supplies you brought with you?
Not after what they've done to me. Why not?<eos> You could conceivably take Parmen's place and run the whole planet.<eos> You think that's what I want?<eos> To become one of them? Become my own enemy?<eos> Just lie around like a big blob of nothing and have things done for me?<eos> I want to move around for myself.<eos> If I'm gonna laugh or cry, I wanna do it for myself.<eos> You can keep your precious power.<eos> All I ask is one thing.<eos> If you do make it out of here, take me with you.
With two very important exceptions.<eos> It is much older than Earth, and about a half million years ago, its atmosphere was totally ripped away by some sort of cataclysm.<eos> The planet has evidently been dead since then.<eos> Sensors detect no life of any kind.<eos> All your questions will be answered in time, Captain Kirk.<eos> - Are your hailing frequencies open?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> I am Sargon.<eos> It is the energy of my thoughts which has touched your instruments and directed you here.<eos> Now, at this closer distance, I can speak to you at last.
There's someone, something out there in the rocks.<eos> - Five of them. Humanoid.<eos> Large.<eos> I want them conscious.<eos> Fire only on my signal.<eos> Flank out.<eos> Chekov.<eos> We mean you no harm.<eos> We're not your enemies, we're your friends.<eos> We only wish to talk to you.
You are not the others?<eos> No.<eos> We come from a far place.<eos> We are men.<eos> - Men?<eos> - Like yourselves.<eos> You are small, like the others.<eos> - Who are the others?<eos> - Givers of pain. And delight.<eos> Do they live here with you?
- He's looking for the Palladium.<eos> - Palladium?<eos> That's only two blocks east of Scotland Yard.<eos> Oh, splendid.<eos> Now, how do we get to Scotland Yard?<eos> Well, you-- excuse me, sir, how do you find Scotland Yard?<eos> I beg your pardon, ma'am, how do you find Scotland Yard?<eos> I'm terribly sorry, but we just arrived from the United States.<eos> Listen, I have a flashlight.<eos> Why don't we go and look for it and if we find it, we'll send someone back for you?
What, you need a special invitation?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - No, sir?<eos> - I mean, yes, sir.<eos> - Then move it.<eos> That's TS, Greek.<eos> Why don't you tell it to the chaplain?<eos> All right, you foul-ups, come on!<eos> Get over to the MP hut.<eos> The man wants to talk to you.
Let's get the lead out.<eos> What's he all upset about?<eos> All right, you bunch of foul-ups.<eos> Come on. Grab a formation.<eos> Fall in there!<eos> Come on, you yard birds!<eos> You believe this Army?<eos> We gotta be losing.<eos> Move it!<eos> What's wrong with you?
Those are the two guys that gave Wladislaw his lumps.<eos> Those are the two guys that jumped Wladislaw.<eos> Those are the two guys that banged Wladislaw.<eos> Those two gorillas beat up Wladislaw.<eos> Those are the two guys...<eos> In my opinion... the officer in command of this operation... has either disregarded his orders or is flagrantly disobeying them... one way or the other.<eos> And that is what I am here to find out.<eos> All right... gentlemen, let's understand each other.<eos> I'm here to find out exactly what this is all about... and I intend to do it if it takes all day.<eos> Now, you can make it easy or tough on yourself. That's up to you.
I don't know, lady. You'll make a month's wages in three days.<eos> Me and Doris want to get out of here, so does Jess.<eos> That's three more of us.<eos> And Russell's looking for a ride too.<eos> All right, that's four.<eos> Why can't we do it?<eos> Have I said we couldn't?<eos> Is everybody ready?<eos> I saw that fella Mendez.<eos> I'm going along with you.
We came on behalf...<eos> -We're from the ball committee.<eos> Tell her...<eos> Miss...<eos> We are... If you would... that you... like to participate in the beauty queen contest.<eos> You are quite a decent and good-Iooking girl.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Don't do this to me, guys!<eos> Wait.<eos> What should I wait for when I'm talking to you?
Now, just a second, I— Remember, I'm a coun—<eos> If I could only find the doctor's formula for destroying matter... I can rule all the others.<eos> - What—<eos> - We meet again, Francesca.<eos> I thought it rather rude of you to leave us without saying good-bye.<eos> - Don't any of you come near me.<eos> - Stop behaving like the Statue of Liberty!<eos> - Put that torch down.<eos> - Yes, we can still make a deal.<eos> Make a deal with you?
- Stella, dear.<eos> - Harcourt!<eos> Harcourt Fenton Mudd!<eos> What have you been up to?<eos> Nothing good, I'm sure.<eos> Let me tell you, you good-for-nothing...<eos> - Shut up! - Thing...<eos> Marvellous, isn't it?<eos> I finally have the last word with her.<eos> And with you.
All right.<eos> The truth is, I'm a little green man from Alpha Centauri. A beautiful place.<eos> You ought to see it.<eos> I am going to lock you up for 200 years.<eos> That oughta be just about right.<eos> He's probably in security section.<eos> It'll take time for the authorities to get there.<eos> Quite logical.<eos> Do you know the coordinates to get near the interrogation rooms?<eos> Yes, but you won't get them unless you take me with you.
I know that, 99, but he's still our Chief.<eos> Max, that's the trailer over there that Raymond went into.<eos> It belongs to Gertrude-Gerald, the half-man, half-woman.<eos> Well, we'll just wait until Raymond leaves and then we'll ask Gertrude-Gerald a few questions.<eos> Mr. Smart, Mr. Smart, down here.<eos> I'm Tiny Allen.<eos> Mr. Smart,<eos> I understand you're interested in the circus accidents. And a little matter of smuggled diamonds.<eos> Go on.<eos> I don't want Raymond to see me talking to you.
We can't go into no town.<eos> I know.<eos> But if there's a town nearby, there's got to be nesters or a small ranch or something.<eos> You figure we lost them?<eos> I figure we got to find a place to hide before the sun comes up tomorrow, and this ain't it.<eos> Be a shame to do all this walking for nothing.<eos> Your one day ahead of the game already.<eos> Better blisters than neck burns. Come on.<eos> Hello inside.<eos> Can we have a word with you?
George, I've just been thinking about the cod-liver oil.<eos> Do you think we put too much in?<eos> Twenty-four hours later, they were still refusing food of any kind.<eos> They were actually dying of starvation before our eyes.<eos> Formula seventeen.<eos> To be perfectly honest, I'm beginning to wish I hadn't brought them back.<eos> Come on, darling.<eos> Come on, sweetie.<eos> What is it?<eos> What are we going to do with you?
Gentlemen, my noble theatre is a poor hiding place... However Juliette and I can help you leave Paris.<eos> If we manage to sneak into unoccupied France, we sure can make it back to England.<eos> England?<eos> I bloody well can't go to England!<eos> Go with them.<eos> It's safer for you.<eos> There you have it.<eos> I summarize Tomorrow morning 8h05 you take the train for Burgundy.<eos> Once in Meursault, go directly to "Hotel du Globe".<eos> No need to take notes. My granddaughter is going with you.
No.<eos> I think you should, you know.<eos> I can't tell you anything.<eos> Well?<eos> Stay friends with him.<eos> Whatever may be done by smiling, you may rely on me to do.<eos> Set your mind at rest.<eos> This is not the stuff of which martyrs are made.<eos> Good evening, sir, Lady Alice.<eos> Will wants to talk to you, Father.
In Europe he is claimed as the King's enemy.<eos> Rubbish!<eos> Crank he may be, traitor he is not.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And with a little pressure...<eos> With a little pressure he can be got to say so.<eos> That's all we need. A brief declaration of his loyalty...<eos> - ... to the present administration.<eos> - I still say, let sleeping dogs lie.<eos> The King does not agree with you.
But let me tell you all the same.<eos> You have no more sincere admirer than myself.<eos> No, not yet, Rich, not yet.<eos> If I might hear the charges.<eos> - The charges?<eos> - I understand there are certain charges.<eos> Some ambiguities of behavior I should like to clarify, hardly charges.<eos> Make a note of that, will you, Master Rich?<eos> There are no charges.<eos> The King is not pleased with you.
You still make a superlative custard, Alice.<eos> Do I?<eos> That's a nice dress you have on.<eos> Nice color anyway.<eos> My God, you think little of me!<eos> I know I'm a fool... but I'm not such a fool as to be lamenting for my dresses... or to relish complimenting on my custards.<eos> I'm well rebuked.<eos> - Alice... - No!<eos> I'm sick with fear when I think of the worst they may do to me.<eos> But worse than that will be to go with you not understanding why I go.
I'm holding you responsible.<eos> As commander of the civilian forces in this emergency, I'm charging you with treason.<eos> Give me that thing!<eos> Give me that!<eos> See that?<eos> That's the the Dexter F Meddels Memorial Sword.<eos> (Sniffing) Yeah.<eos> You traitorous fink!<eos> (Mattocks) Get out of it!<eos> (Norman) What's the matter with you?
I'm not gonna do your work.<eos> - I won't stand any more of your watches.<eos> - Harris, lay below!<eos> - Perna, you...<eos> - I said lay below!<eos> Harris!<eos> - Cut it out! Cut it out, you guys!<eos> - Let him go! Let him go!<eos> - Get the deck aides to help you.<eos> - What's the matter with you guys?
Yes, sir.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> RZ2 to R01.<eos> RZ2 to R01.<eos> R01 here.<eos> We'll be around the plateau by about 10:00 in the morning, sir.<eos> About 250 miles away from you.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I'll have the helicopter meet you on the plateau.
The murderers!<eos> They destroy the army, the people.<eos> What for?<eos> Go and tell Lisa.<eos> Father, tell me how it happened.<eos> Go on.<eos> Killed on the battlefield where the best Russian men and Russian glory were led to their death.<eos> Go on, Princess Maria!<eos> Go and tell Lisa.<eos> I'll be right with you.
Your unsuitability has condemned the Talosian race to eventual death.<eos> is this not sufficient?<eos> No other specimen has shown your adaptability.<eos> You were our last hope.<eos> But wouldn't some form of trade...<eos> mutual cooperation...<eos> Your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy itself, too.<eos> Captain, we have transporter control now.<eos> Let's get back to the ship.<eos> I can't. I can't go with you.
Pull!<eos> I wouldn't exchange you for anything in the world<eos> Everything in the world is mine with you by my side<eos> Nothing is more valuable than love<eos> My dear brother, my priceless jewel<eos> Finally you guys have come.<eos> You were to return at 10.<eos> What is the time?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Today is rakhi so I won't scold you.
HELLO?<eos> HELLO, CONTROL CENTRAL?<eos> WHAT'S THE MATTER?<eos> OH, MY TIE IS BUSY. WELL, UH,<eos> PUT ME ON MY HANDKERCHIEF, EXTENSION FOUR.<eos> NEVER MIND THE HANDKERCHIEF, CENTRAL.<eos> MY BELT IS RINGING.<eos> HELLO?<eos> CHECKPOINT EASY?<eos> YES.I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.
Tim Strawn.<eos> Well, waste not want not. Where's that jug of yours?<eos> Strawn.<eos> You sure?<eos> Silver nose and all.<eos> Let Shelleen do it.<eos> Let Shelleen do it.<eos> Shelleen's in no condition--<eos> He sure isn't.<eos> Look, I'm counting on all three of you.
She's with her folks for a couple of days.<eos> Did Lancey go for it as a game setup?<eos> Yeah. Just about.<eos> Is it okay if Melba goes with you?<eos> - Look, Shooter...<eos> - I promised her.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> Well, I'd appreciate it.<eos> Thanks, Kid.<eos> I'll meet you at my place after the fight.
When they bury Walter Southgate tomorrow, there will be buried with him something of the regional tradition of English literature.<eos> Now-a-days it is London which more and more devours the talents.<eos> London.<eos> That damn jam factory boiling out the goodness from writers.<eos> As Southgate once said to me.<eos> A certain flinty integrity has gone.<eos> Perhaps forever.<eos> Good night.<eos> And that's all from us for this week.<eos> We'll be back with you again with another program in a fortnight's time.
But I tell you now the hand that will betray me is on this table.<eos> -No!<eos> -Not I, Master.<eos> -Not I.<eos> -No, Master.<eos> -Master, who is it?<eos> -Who is going to betray you?<eos> One who is eating bread with me tonight.<eos> Is it I?<eos> Only for a little while longer am I with you.
How are we to know where you are going?<eos> I am the Way and the Truth, and the Life.<eos> No one comes to the Father but by me.<eos> Take it, and eat.<eos> This is my body, which is being given for you.<eos> Do this in remembrance of me.<eos> Drink this.<eos> For this is my blood of the New Testament which shall be shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.<eos> I have greatly desired to eat Passover with you before I suffer.<eos> I tell you I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
I meet him on his own level.<eos> He does have anxieties, though, don't you agree?<eos> Let's call a spade a spade.<eos> The kid's crooked.<eos> -Now, who is to say who is crooked?<eos> -The cops.<eos> well, I've thought about him a Iot lately anyway.<eos> After all, we're potential brothers-in-Iaw.<eos> I'm glad to hear that, Jim.<eos> When you and Tracy get married, he can go live with you.
You look happy to meet me<eos> Blossom of snow<eos> May you bloom and grow<eos> Bloom and grow forever<eos> Edelweiss<eos> Edelweiss<eos> Bless my homeland forever<eos> I think it'll work.<eos> I shall miss all of you.<eos> I shall miss the money I could have made with you.
The murderers!<eos> They destroy the army, the people.<eos> What for?<eos> Go and tell Lisa.<eos> Father, tell me how it happened.<eos> Go on.<eos> Killed on the battlefield where the best Russian men and Russian glory were led to their death.<eos> Go on, Princess Maria!<eos> Go and tell Lisa.<eos> I'll be right with you.
Well, how?<eos> Walls have ears.<eos> If he should hear us... Well, how can he hear us?<eos> You're dealing with a crazy one.<eos> He'll kill us all.<eos> All right! All right!<eos> Can you take us to miss tregellis?<eos> The girl? Yes.<eos> And I can take you away from here.<eos> But I'm coming with you and I want a free pardon.
- Tomorrow, my lord.<eos> - So soon?<eos> They've been promised since childhood.<eos> It's time, lord.<eos> I give leave to your son to wed.<eos> We thank thee.<eos> Work on the moat goes well, lord. But the drawbridge, the blacksmith...<eos> No more now! Get him out!<eos> Bones of the saints!<eos> What's wrong with you?
Carry it all on your broad back, then. Your sins and mine.<eos> Carry them to a monkery and pray your way back to God's grace again.<eos> Or go to hell.<eos> I've been there.<eos> Then go on a quest for the Holy Grail and take that with you.<eos> But first, I'll have my father's ring.<eos> The ring, I say! - Draco!<eos> - Shall I take her finger with it?<eos> I can't fight you, Draco.<eos> Then I'll fight you.
Your father set me to ride at your back when you were too small to reach the saddle.<eos> God help me, I've ridden too many miles there to leave now.<eos> Bronwyn!<eos> Bronwyn!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I can't take you to that that far place, not for a while.<eos> I'll be with you, always.<eos> Wherever you go.<eos> So you go now to the north. Oh, no!<eos> I want to stay with you.
Ladies, thank the host.<eos> - I'm all for youth.<eos> - Thanks, Lucas.<eos> Actually, I quite like Mathurin.<eos> I forgot my bag.<eos> With my love letters.<eos> - Nice for Mathurin.<eos> - That kind of reading keeps you awake.<eos> I'll get them.<eos> I'll see you at Senequier's.
Cape Kennedy, near the White House.<eos> But we are speculating idly.<eos> Operation Grand Slam will be successful.<eos> You will be there to see for yourself.<eos> Too closely for comfort, I'm afraid.<eos> Forgive me, Mr. Bond, but I must arrange to separate my gold from the late Mr. Solo.<eos> As you said, he had a pressing engagement.<eos> Very chic, Miss Galore.<eos> Please entertain Mr. Bond for me, Pussy.<eos> I'll join you both later.
- I really thought that...<eos> - Excuse me. Miller.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - What are you doing with that?<eos> - Carrying it, sir. - It's mine, captain.<eos> - Yours?<eos> - Yes. My sea bag, you know.<eos> Sea bag?<eos> But you're only staying a few hours, aren't you?<eos> Well, I do feel it my duty, captain, as a new trustee to be some little time with you.
And I cry, little ones<eos> 'Cause I'm touched by your words<eos> Don't be sad, Mommy dear<eos> If it's true the world is round<eos> I will search Round the world<eos> Till the bluebird is found<eos> Little one, there's no need<eos> To wander too far<eos> For what you really seek<eos> Is right here where you are
Listen, if this is somebody's idea of a joke, I don't think it's very funny.<eos> Ellen, did you have anything to do with this?<eos> Not a thing.<eos> The wire I received was signed Caryl Fergusson, and that's all I know.<eos> Well, all I know is...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> L sent those telegrams.<eos> Now, I...<eos> I didn't mean to be deceitful, it's just that...<eos> Well, you know, I wanted to talk to all of you just once more.
Winnetou must try to forget.<eos> You'll help me.<eos> We've got an awful lot to do.<eos> - We'll start on Forrester!<eos> What did you say?<eos> Peace!<eos> - Everybody's talking about it.<eos> Colonel Merril negotiated with the chiefs.<eos> The worst news is that his son, Lieutenant Merril, is going to marry a chief's daughter.<eos> Jenson! Carter! I want you over here right away!
They said it would please you very much.<eos> The sun does shed its grace too brightly.<eos> It has become too hot here for kings.<eos> My Lord Ptolemy will retire.<eos> For His Majesty, a Roman guard of honor.<eos> It was not by your hand, of course.<eos> If, as you say, you've been told of me, you know better, Caesar.<eos> My men shall be properly housed and fed.<eos> - May I speak?<eos> - Not until you're spoken to.
Any of the opposition around?<eos> Not in any condition to worry about.<eos> Good.<eos> We'll make it.<eos> I know this territory like the back of my hand.<eos> sir Do you mind if we have a bite to eat first?<eos> I've been on the go since breakfast.<eos> Of course not. leave your things there We'll go to the restaurant car.<eos> caroline you go on with captain Nash to the restaurant car.<eos> I'll join you there in a few minutes.
I'll go alone.<eos> No. I have to go with you.<eos> I have no country now. And I love you.<eos> Castor, Phalerus, Dmitrius, get to the door.<eos> The rest of you, back to your places.<eos> - The priestess.<eos> - Argos, listen to Medea.<eos> When you're clear of the palace, go to the ship and row downstream.<eos> There's a break in the cliff and a path through the woods.<eos> Anchor there. We'll join you.
- Why?<eos> I don't know, but she gave me strict instructions... that once I found you, not to let you out of my sight.<eos> Don't do that, Rexford.<eos> Dr. Bedlo, we must be on our way now.<eos> Yes, we are in a hurry.<eos> If you do that once more... I'll smash you one right in the face!<eos> - Dr. Bedlo, please.<eos> - He's my son!<eos> Yes, I know, but we must go.<eos> - Then I must go with you.
They're getting the milk for you.<eos> Now, hold it quiet, so I can...<eos> Stand still, baby.<eos> Good...<eos> - That doesn't get us anywhere.<eos> - We are just wasting milk.<eos> - A goat only gives so much a day.<eos> - He must eat!<eos> Don't look at me!<eos> Feeding him is up to you people.
There's more over here!<eos> Back! Back!<eos> Up, up you little devils!<eos> All we need is about 200 more.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Three miles down the road, past that little duka, is a tree.<eos> There are lots of monkeys in that tree.<eos> At 6.30 tomorrow morning, I'll be ready to throw a net over them.<eos> - The rest, my friends, is up to you.
You stay here and rest up.<eos> Wow! What a knife!<eos> Listen, Galtsev, would you give it to me?<eos> I would, Vanya, but...<eos> Don't be a miser. Give it to him.<eos> This is a memento.<eos> It was my buddy's. He was killed.<eos> - Let me have it till tonight.<eos> - All right.<eos> Why should I go with you?
- No.<eos> - For Feisal?<eos> - No!<eos> Nor to drive away the Turks.<eos> He will come because it is his pleasure.<eos> Thy mother mated with a scorpion.<eos> Make God your agent!<eos> Aqaba!<eos> Aqaba!<eos> God be with you.

- Smith. Say, "sir," when you answer the Governor.<eos> Sir Smith.<eos> That won't get you far here, lad.<eos> Well, all I have to say to you is this.<eos> I don't have to know what you've done.<eos> You are here for us to try and make something of you, to turn you into industrious and honest citizens.<eos> Well, as we see it, that shouldn't be too difficult.<eos> We like things to run smoothly here, of course. Both for you and for us.<eos> The sooner we have your cooperation, the sooner you'll be out of here.<eos> If you'll play ball with us, we'll play ball with you.
Class, still! - Roach.<eos> - Good morning, sir.<eos> I see from the sports report that Smith is making good time in these practice runs.<eos> Better than I expected, sir. I think you were right.<eos> - You still don't trust him, do you?<eos> - I wouldn't like to say, sir.<eos> Well, we'll soon see, shall we?<eos> - Stand them at ease.<eos> - At ease!<eos> Well, lads, you've all heard me say that if you'll play ball with us, we will play ball with you.
Take them away.<eos> We should take more men.<eos> The others will try to rescue these four.<eos> We're defenseless on the road.<eos> Bring reinforcements quickly.<eos> It's not safe to go alone.<eos> Take two men with you.<eos> Three's not enough.<eos> I'll go too.<eos> I'm going with you.
- Okay.<eos> What're you doing here, Jonah?<eos> - Just visiting, bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Hi, Ellis.<eos> - Hello, Sarge.<eos> - Hi, Page.<eos> - Hi, Sarge.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come on, I want to talk to you.
He's not in the mood?<eos> That ungrateful blind wretch!<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Tate is giving him a massage.<eos> A blind masseur getting a massage from a seeing man?<eos> That's funny!<eos> Tate, is someone here?<eos> It's my sister.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I have something to tell you.
You got it!<eos> - Yes, I got it.<eos> - Doc, you're a pal. You're the best friend a guy ever had.<eos> I'll pay you back as soon as I can. I promise.<eos> - Forget that. - No, I'll never!<eos> I couldn't.<eos> Doc, you know what we're gonna do in the country, Maria and me?<eos> We'll have kids, and we'll name 'em all after you... even the girls, so when you visit us...<eos> Wake up!<eos> Is this the only way to get through to you... do just what you all do, bust like a hot water pipe?
You have not right to question Mr. Kyle like that.<eos> Haven't I?<eos> Well, he's got you pretty well fooled, hasn't he?<eos> Fooled about what?<eos> He hasn't got me fooled about anything.<eos> Tell him, Kyle!<eos> Tell him the truth!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> What's the matter with you?
Then circle back to the Malvet place.<eos> Sure you want to go alone? I'm sure.<eos> Well, I guess we lost 'em. I doubt it.<eos> (rifle cocking)<eos> (pistol cocking) HOSS: I wouldn't do that, boys.<eos> Just leave them peashooters right where they are and be sensible about this.<eos> It was Clay Renton beat up that storekeeper.<eos> I swear it was.<eos> Now, the safe was robbed.<eos> You got the money with you?
Your courage, your sincerity...<eos> Really, I need you.<eos> Your desperation gives me strength.<eos> You'd be a marvelous companion. Because I could tell you everything.<eos> You know everything.<eos> Maddalena, are you listening?<eos> Answer me.<eos> Maddalena, enough playing. Come back. I want to talk to you more.<eos> We're going on a ghost hunt at the old villa.<eos> Is Maddalena with you?
I want a legitimate freighter... with legal registry and real cargo we can unload here in Cyprus.<eos> A ship for six...<eos> That's a wonderful idea.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> But the expense will be brilliant also.<eos> Not too brilliant.<eos> You know, our treasury is based on donations, and right now we're rather low.<eos> - Well, can you deliver or not?<eos> - I'll do my best.<eos> We Cypriots are with you.
Not much to show for working hard all their lives... Yet they have such dignity and wisdom... Sorrow and pride.<eos> Oh, Mother, this is Mr Eaton.<eos> Good evening, Mr Eaton.<eos> It's very nice of you to come.<eos> Very kind of you to have me.<eos> What is everyone standing around for?<eos> Let's have a drink.<eos> - Nothing for me, dear.<eos> - Nor me, Dad.<eos> What's the matter with you people?
I'm real sure about tonight.<eos> Artistic poses by Miss Angela Rossini.<eos> Nothing here, nothing there.<eos> Allez-oop.<eos> $1, please.<eos> The same poses that have stirred the hearts... of the red-blooded American males... from the great Atlantic to the blue Pacific.<eos> $1, please. $1 for these lively, spicy portraits.<eos> Thank you. $1 to set the blood tingling through your veins.<eos> Thank you. Who wants Angela Rossini?<eos> Take her beauty home with you tonight. Thank you. Who wants Angela Rossini?
That's a long pull over rough country.<eos> Right over that mountain.<eos> You got snow, you got wind.<eos> You got trails where you take one wrong step and you're over the edge.<eos> Look, Mabry. If you don't want to come along, you don't have to.<eos> You've done a lot for us.<eos> I don't want you to feel you have to stay.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> I was raised to do good, and I like to do it whenever I can.<eos> No, I'll stay with you.
This time it must be Ocean.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Who?<eos> - Mr. Corneal.<eos> - Corneal again.<eos> - Will you accept the call?<eos> Yes, I'll accept the call.<eos> That man sure likes telephones.<eos> Come in.<eos> I'll be right with you.
What're you thinking?<eos> She's a very lovely girl.<eos> I'd like to take you home and spread you on my waffle.<eos> There's only two.<eos> He begs for a job. Now he's dumping customers.<eos> - Let's get the bum out.<eos> - Okay, Al.<eos> - Now?<eos> - Now's the time.<eos> - What's the matter with you?
I don't want her to take it one more night.<eos> Neither do I, Vince.<eos> Here, take that.<eos> Shucks, Danny.<eos> Cut it out.<eos> Here's a plane ticket.<eos> When you get there...<eos> Go to this address.<eos> Ask for Josh Howard.<eos> - Josh's in with you?
Hoods always mix with other hoods.<eos> Where there're hoods, there're stool pigeons.<eos> But with us, no leaks.<eos> You five guys, which hotels you in?<eos> - Flamingo.<eos> - The Sands.<eos> - Desert Inn.<eos> - Riviera.<eos> Sahara.<eos> There'll be five more men working with you guys as teams.
Check all outgoing flights.<eos> Car 306. 306, come in, please.<eos> I want every piece of luggage examined.<eos> 306, proceed with plan 22. Over.<eos> If they don't cooperate, let's find out why.<eos> - I can 't do it.<eos> - What do you mean, you can't?<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> - Smooth as a peeled egg.<eos> You?
Allow me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How do you like this for the winner of the race?<eos> I better try it on for size?<eos> Not going to argue?<eos> Just conceding that I'll win?<eos> Fritz, about this afternoon... I know why you and Ernst were fighting.<eos> It was my fault and I'm sorry.<eos> It wasn't your fault, Roberta.<eos> Everything that's happened here lately is because you brought me back with you, even the danger we're in from the pirates.
Then you must be tired of living.<eos> I don't kill as easy as that woman, Blackie.<eos> You going with him or you want to stay?<eos> Blackie's right, I... I don't aim to try my luck with that posse.<eos> Both of you, on your horses.<eos> Ride out.<eos> Good luck, kid.<eos> I'm bushed.<eos> I know how you fellas are suffering.<eos> I'm suffering along with you.
Take their guns.<eos> What are you going to do-- kill us, too?<eos> You're going back to California, all of you.<eos> You're drawing a pretty fine line on murder. Aren't you, Cartwright?<eos> Now, we're out of supplies.<eos> I told you my sister is sick.<eos> And you're going to make us go back through that country without food and guns and our stock worn out?<eos> Isn't that murder?<eos> Mr. Pennington, Pa wouldn't do that.<eos> We brought along fresh stock and supplies by muleback, and I'm gonna be riding along with you.
I reckon you ain't.<eos> How's Ben's wound?<eos> Well, it soaked through a little bit, Doc.<eos> That bandage ought to be changed, but I'm sort of busy.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Hello?<eos> !<eos> Mr. Davis! (indistinct chatter) Mr. Carter!<eos> Mr. Carter, I need you real bad.<eos> (indistinct chatter) What's the matter with all of you?
Here passes from this Earth Hélène Delambre, ...widow of my brother André, ...whom I loved deeply, hopelessly.<eos> She was destroyed in the end by dreadful memories:<eos> A recollection of horrors that did not dim as the years went on, ...but instead grew monstrously, and left her mind shocked and unsteady so that death, when it came, was a blessed release.<eos> Beg pardon, gentlemen.<eos> May I speak to you?
- There were two of them?<eos> - Only Benner and Bill.<eos> There were three.<eos> - I only saw two.<eos> - There was one up on the ridge.<eos> - The one that killed the big fella?<eos> My friend's name was Nicholson, Bob Nicholson.<eos> A brother to Ben Nicholson of Texas.<eos> We had to let him lay when the team took off wild.<eos> - I'd like to go with you.
You'll find out soon enough.<eos> I can't imagine what.<eos> I persuaded Uncle Bill to keep it a secret awhile.<eos> We got married.<eos> But don't worry, dear.<eos> I'll send you the $2500 just as soon as the will is read.<eos> A deal is a deal.<eos> Here is further evidence that crime does not pay, for the law caught up with Mrs. Herman and Mrs. Fenimore shortly after they had spent the inheritance.<eos> They are now living on government expense.<eos> The subject of money brings us quite naturally to the following, at the conclusion of which, I shall rejoin you.
That's right.<eos> I have lost.<eos> Simson, go and hitch the horses, we're leaving.<eos> - Would you help us pack, Mr Tubal?<eos> - I'm staying here.<eos> My path is another.<eos> One should live piously, as Sofia says.<eos> Higher aims, you understand.<eos> Greater meaning and less apparatus.<eos> No... I'm not coming with you.
What have you two been up to?<eos> You don't know each other well enough to fight a duel.<eos> A gift from Jim.<eos> We're about ready for you, Major.<eos> Mornin', Pat.<eos> Morning, Steve.<eos> - Where are you off to?<eos> - A little hunting expedition.<eos> Good.<eos> Jim going with you?
And your job right now is to help me restore some order around here.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Okay, everybody, quiet down a minute.<eos> Quiet down, please!<eos> Listen, this is an emergency, and it can affect every one of us.<eos> That's all I can tell you right now.<eos> But we're trying to get things under control.<eos> In order to do that, we have to clear this area immediately.<eos> So please go home and stay there.<eos> We'll keep in touch with you through your radio station.
- Get your gun and horse. Le's go. - Where?<eos> - After 'em!<eos> - They stole five horses!<eos> We can't find Emma.<eos> They've taken her.<eos> Josefa! They've taken Emma.<eos> Wha'll I do? Please help me.<eos> Please!<eos> Mr Steinmetz, we'll all help.<eos> I'll get my horse and go with you. Come on, Jim.
If you like it, I'll make you a good deal.<eos> I figure I owe it to you.<eos> Perhaps there is a nice, comfortable hotel.<eos> If you're willing to pay for putting up a nice comfortable family of five.<eos> Or you could sell an old Cézanne you may have hanging around.<eos> Let me show it to you. What can you lose?<eos> - It's the best location around.<eos> - I think that's poison ivy.<eos> Down there is my old man's grocery store, and across the river is the country club.<eos> There's a better class of people at the grocery store, but that's up to you.
Hello, Pearl!<eos> - Funny, funny, funny! - What's with you?<eos> We're trying to eat.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> - Is this a private dining room?<eos> - Wanna sing?<eos> Go to the head!<eos> It'll take more than you to put me there!<eos> Break it up!<eos> What's the matter with you guys?
The old man heard the fight a few hours earlier.<eos> When he's in bed, he heard the body hit the floor, heard the woman scream, got to his front door as fast as he could, heard somebody running and assumed it was the boy.<eos> - I think that's possible.<eos> - Assumed?<eos> Brother, I've seen all kinds of dishonesty in my day, but this little display takes the cake.<eos> You all come in here with your hearts bleeding' about slum kids and injustice.<eos> You listen to some fairy tales.<eos> You start getting through to these old ladies. You're not getting through to me.<eos> I've had enough.<eos> What's the matter with you guys?
No, tomorrow I won't be here.<eos> I'm just now on my way to Rome.<eos> May I introduce myself, General?<eos> - I am Signor Unte, commissario of police.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> This is Dr. Uhl.<eos> - It's a pleasure.<eos> - How do you do, sir?<eos> From the government in Rome, I received a telegram.<eos> I am to cooperate with you.
- They're all expendable.<eos> - All of us?<eos> We don't expect you to do anything inhuman, of course.<eos> But we need those documents from Benghazi.<eos> We need them here, right away.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> - All right, then.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Two planes will drop you in the desert... three hours' march from German HQ, Benghazi.<eos> Sgt. Evans of the Camel Corps will meet you with your gear... and you'll proceed to rendezvous.
Give yourself a chance to live.<eos> No, I thought about it.<eos> I thought real hard about it.<eos> No, sir, I can't run.<eos> Ike and Finn are my brothers.<eos> You understand that, don't you?<eos> Yes, Billy, I understand that.<eos> How can you sit there like you're playing checkers?<eos> How can you sit there like that?<eos> What's the matter with you?
I'll be with you in a moment.
Neighbors won't talk to us.<eos> We figure maybe they're hiding him.<eos> They'll talk with you, Major.<eos> Would you help us?<eos> Would you give me one good reason why I should?<eos> We figured we'd give him a break.<eos> We haven't reported him yet.<eos> If we get him on another plane, we might not have to turn him in for desertion.<eos> - Desertion?<eos> - I'll go with you in a minute.
If anybody needs any help, holler.<eos> Jube could use some of that help, Shem.<eos> He's in bad trouble.<eos> He's killed a man.<eos> It was self-defense.<eos> It was Shep Horgan.<eos> What did you bring him here for?<eos> What if they come after him?<eos> I think they might.<eos> But I knew he'd be safer here with one of you.
What?<eos> If they're dug in, they could give us a hard, hard time.<eos> No use trying to crawl it.<eos> There's no cover.<eos> 400 yards in battle gear is too far to run, so we'll walk the first half and then we'll kick out.<eos> And pray.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - It could be a real real crock, sir.<eos> - Get the men moving.<eos> - I'll be with you in a minute. - Yes, sir.
Would you come along with me?<eos> Don't be nervous.<eos> Prime Minister, this is the young lady.<eos> Dear lady, I'm forever in your debt.<eos> This is her husband. I trust you'll permit me to wait upon you tomorrow. And to express to you the depth of my gratitude.<eos> It wasn't...<eos> But it was, my dear lady.<eos> Will you excuse us?<eos> Excuse me, but I have to go.<eos> I think Mr. Buchanan would like a word with you.
We have heard how you took ibis from the Nile to destroy the venomous serpents used against you when you laid siege to the city of Saba.<eos> May my arms stay strong in your service, Great Sethi.<eos> Who is this fair young god come into the house of Pharaoh?<eos> No need to tell you how I share her joy at your return-<eos> No need, my brother.<eos> Great one, I bring you Ethiopia!<eos> Command them to kneel before Pharaoh.<eos> Command what you have conquered, my brother.<eos> I bring the Ethiopian king and his sister in friendship, as an ally to guard our southern gates.<eos> My son has dealt wisely with you, Ethiopia.
Kenyawa Tambe just charged some tickets to a ski resort.<eos> Yeah, so what?<eos> Kenyawa Tambe is one of Luanne's aliases.<eos> - Why didn't you tell me this before?<eos> - l just found out. - Oh really?<eos> - Yeah. You know, we're supposed to be working as a team here.<eos> - You're going around behind my back.<eos> - lf the pressure's too much for you-- - You'll take over!<eos> You'll take over! - Sirs!<eos> I shall go with you.
Tommy, let's have the second 24 bars.<eos> Ready?<eos> One and two and...<eos> - That's much better, thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> All right, now listen, kids.<eos> I want the whole number.<eos> Places, please.<eos> It's "Boogie Barcarolle," from the top.<eos> I'll do it with you.
Back up!<eos> He tricked us.<eos> At least I know where to look for the medallion.<eos> We'll search till we find him.<eos> Remember, he's dangerous.<eos> So am I.<eos> We have located the medallion.<eos> It is in the possession of a short, fat foreigner.<eos> Take it away from him.<eos> So you do not fail, I will go with you.
Bill Clark, coming here?<eos> It was Father's idea.<eos> He thought it'd be a nice surprise for you.<eos> I haven't seen Bill since I got out of the Army.<eos> I want you to tell me all about him.<eos> That is indeed wonderful news.<eos> I must tell my guests.<eos> Orchestra!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> Mr. Collins has brought us news that I'm eager to share with you.
- Yes, sir.<eos> Yes?<eos> My name is Sacajawea.<eos> At the village, you said you are going to where the river meets the mountains. Yes, we are.<eos> That is the land of my people.<eos> That isn't Minnetaree country.<eos> I am Shoshone.<eos> I was captured by the Minnetarees.<eos> They raid our villages, steal our horses... and carry our women off as slaves.<eos> Take me with you.
- Sergeant, cast off.<eos> Cast off!<eos> Fend off there.<eos> Pull in those lines!<eos> Lay down your oars!<eos> Now!<eos> Give way together!<eos> Pull!<eos> Tomorrow, you ride against our enemies.<eos> The Great Spirit will ride with you.
I think you're a liar.<eos> Merne, I...<eos> Excuse me, gentlemen.<eos> Go on to the camp, George.<eos> Since you're not behaving like officers, I'll not speak like a sergeant.<eos> I don't know what's between you two, and I couldn't care less.<eos> But if you have any sense of responsibility... you'll stop acting like a couple of schoolboys.<eos> Them woods down there is crawling with Indians.<eos> If we're to get out of this alive... you'll need every man in the outfit.<eos> I'll follow you, but the others won't.
Hello, darling, baby-pie, glamour puss, sweetie.<eos> Beau, you belong in bed.<eos> He's home.<eos> You're home.<eos> You're home.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Where were you?<eos> We were so worried.<eos> I wouldn't take a sleeping pill till you were home.<eos> Can I talk to you guys?
Leave me alone with him.<eos> - You're the fisherman.<eos> - And you're Claudius's wife.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - My business is with Demetrius.<eos> - This is my house.<eos> - l know.<eos> I was told, if I wanted to see him, to come here.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> He doesn't want to see you.
And Vienna was one of them, understand?<eos> Well, I did see him kiss her.<eos> We won't need you, Emma.<eos> I'm coming along.<eos> You'll only be in the way.<eos> It's my money they got.<eos> I'm going after it.<eos> They got a lot of my money, too, Emma.<eos> The marshal's right, you'll only slow us up.<eos> I'm riding with you.
How does he feel about the fellows who wear $150 suits... and diamond rings on your union dues and your kickback money?<eos> And how does He, who spoke up without fear against every evil... feel about your silence?<eos> Shut up about that!<eos> Just watch this.<eos> You see that?<eos> You want to know what's wrong with our waterfront?<eos> It's the love of a lousy buck.<eos> It's making love of a buck, the cushy job... more important than the love of man.<eos> It's forgetting that every fellow down here is your brother in Christ.<eos> But remember, Christ is always with you.
Do I get that winter underwear, or do I have to come in and take it off you?<eos> Don't listen to her.<eos> She wouldn't dare.<eos> Oh, wouldn't I?<eos> All right, you'll get it.<eos> I didn't know last night I'd married into such a handsome family.<eos> You know, you're mighty good-looking boys.<eos> Well, you are. Every last one of you.<eos> What you been doing, going around hiding behind those whiskers?<eos> Afraid some girl will see you and run off with you?
What do I have to do, beat some sense into your dumb heads?<eos> Taking them back is the only way you'll ever get them.<eos> - The whole town's coming here.<eos> - Let them come.<eos> - We'll fight them all. - Sure ..<eos> Sure you will.<eos> And who will you be fighting?<eos> The girls' kinfolk.<eos> Someone's bound to get hurt, a father, a brother, maybe.<eos> Think the girls will marry you after that?
I just thought it best that we have a little talk.<eos> I hope my telegram didn't interfere too much with your plans.<eos> That's all right, Father. We closed last night.<eos> We'll be laying off for Lent anyway.<eos> Oh, isn't that interesting? I didn't know actors gave up the theater for Lent.<eos> Well, not exactly, Father. Let's say that the theater gives up actors for Lent.<eos> Does the box office fall off? Yes, Father.<eos> Ours falls off. Yours picks up.<eos> Oh, I understand, but to return to the children.<eos> The fact is, they want to be back with you.
- I hope not, I'm counting on it.<eos> - Some people don't get her jokes.<eos> - I'm gonna try.<eos> Dorothy's the best and loyalest friend a girl ever had.<eos> She'll make a wonderful wife. You'll find out.<eos> - I've got to be going.<eos> - Going?<eos> Where?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm only concerned about you two.
Now you try.<eos> I'll think of a mermaid lagoon, underneath a magic moon.<eos> I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave.<eos> I think I'll be an Indian brave.<eos> Now everybody try.<eos> One, two, three!<eos> We can fly!<eos> We can fly!<eos> This won't do.<eos> What's the matter with you?
The Son of Man must be delivered<eos> Into the hands of sinful men<eos> And be crucified and rise again, rise again. "<eos> "The Son of Man must rise again. "<eos> And lo, Jesus appeared to us<eos> And showed us his wounds<eos> And he said unto us there:<eos> "Go ye therefore, the blessed<eos> And teach all the nations. "<eos> "And I am with you always. "

Come, let me present you.<eos> Marcellus Gallio, tribune of Rome.<eos> Peter, fisherman of Galilee.<eos> A humble subject of the empire is honoured, Tribune.<eos> I think the honour is mine, sir.<eos> Everybody, move closer.<eos> Sit down, children.<eos> Closer, everybody.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I want to talk to you.
Get a whole lot o' soldiers!<eos> We ain't got time for soldiers.<eos> Jake!<eos> ... Jake Viner! ...<eos> Jake! Mr Viner... he run away, Judge.<eos> Well, I ain't gonna run away, son.<eos> Judge... can I stay, too?<eos> Yeah, you stay, Uncle Plez.<eos> Hey... there he is, Pa!<eos> Boys, I want to have a little talk with you.
He is?<eos> How old are you, Isamu?<eos> Tell her.<eos> The bath is ready anytime.<eos> How about a bath, Father?<eos> Want to change your clothes, Mama?<eos> Please don't bother.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let me cary these.<eos> Did Keizo meet you at Osaka?
Mother, are these yours?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I've gotten so forgetful.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Will they get seats?<eos> Yes, we're in a good position here.<eos> The train should be in Nagoya or Gifu around morning.<eos> And arrive in Onomichi? Have you wired Kyoko?<eos> I have.<eos> Keizo will meet you at Osaka, too.
Anything can happen.<eos> Maybe a record...<eos> Come on, Al!<eos> Come on!<eos> Hey, get off the track!<eos> Please don't cross the track.<eos> Don't cross the track.<eos> Don't get hurt.<eos> Blood makes the road slippery.<eos> What's the matter with you?
Porthos brought five.<eos> I've already lost count! Good, we're ready. Inform these men of their duties.<eos> There's one more thing to be done.<eos> In the attack the King will be in danger.<eos> Some of us must go into the castle and guard him. How? By using the Countess as she used you.<eos> Oh!<eos> Sons of the Musketeers, this is what we've been waiting for - the future of France is in our hands.<eos> The honour of saving the King - and therefore France - has been bestowed upon us.<eos> To achieve this we have pledged our lives.<eos> I know you won't fail your fathers or your King. You know what is to be done - do it. God be with you.
Some folks think I'm almost as fast as that raider from Missouri.<eos> Um, what was his name?<eos> McLyntock?<eos> Friend of yours, honey.<eos> Oh. Laura.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'll be right with you.<eos> Bradley, take the scales for a moment.<eos> How's everybody upriver?<eos> We've been worried about you.
Nothing.<eos> That's just it. All that talk he made about always shipping with me,<eos> Railroad or no railroad, was just talk.<eos> I haven't seen one ounce of his bullion.<eos> Since you came here.<eos> He used to be my best customer, too.<eos> All through the holdups and all that, He never missed a shipment any time.<eos> And then you came along, and he's stockpiling. Waiting for you fellows to finish so he can ship with you.<eos> He isn't shipping with us.<eos> He must have some other reason for fighting with you fellows.
Well, how about it, Mr. Hutcheson?<eos> Is it a rumor?<eos> We have a right to protect ourselves, haven't we?<eos> Well, go ahead.<eos> Tell us we got nothing to worry about.<eos> The day after tomorrow in surrogates court...<eos> You got two weeks' pay coming to ya.<eos> The paper's closing.<eos> Quit now and look for another job or... wait for the probate judge's decision.<eos> It's up to you.
Greer?<eos> What do you say?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, Ferriman!<eos> So this is the way it works.<eos> 10% instead of your 20% finder's fee.<eos> I can't let you take advantage of me like that.<eos> That's the way it is.<eos> Take it or leave it.<eos> Fine. But I go with you.

But I go with you.<eos> Not on my boat, you don't.<eos> Think I'd tell you where a fortune might be without insurance?<eos> There are five other boats that would jump at this.<eos> I come with you.
She was dying anyway.<eos> What will he get?<eos> I'm a policeman, not a judge.<eos> - Why pick on us?<eos> - Just a hunch.<eos> He was always chasing circuses as a kid.<eos> You wont see that face around here.<eos> Probably not.<eos> Anyway, I've arranged to fingerprint some of your people in Cedar City.<eos> Do you mind if I ride along with you?
- It's out of bounds. - Why?<eos> - Because it's dangerous down there.<eos> Because a wall could fall in on you.<eos> Because I'm sheriff and because I'm responsible for everybody's safety. - What about Tatum?<eos> - Out of bounds.<eos> You heard me!<eos> What about Tatum?<eos> You're repeating' yourself.<eos> This is a pretty nice place I fixed up here for you boys.<eos> Be a shame to cut all these wires and kick you out.
I couldn't go on.<eos> "Couldn't go on"?<eos> You'll give the performance of your life.<eos> And she gave the performance of her life.<eos> And it was a night to remember, that night.<eos> Honored members of the Sarah Siddons Society, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> What is there for me to say?<eos> Everything wise and witty has long since been said by minds more mature and talents far greater than mine.<eos> For me to thank you as equals would be presumptuous.<eos> I am an apprentice in the theatre, and have much to learn from all of you.
You'd look good in a shower curtain.<eos> We're pals, Cotton.<eos> You'll see that I get away all right, see that I get to a doc?<eos> Sure, Zuckie.<eos> We're all set.<eos> Cody, I was pretty good back there on the train, huh?<eos> - Pretty good for my first job, huh?<eos> - Yeah, you were great.<eos> You won't leave me here.<eos> You'll take me with you.
Ay, my good lord.<eos> We should have else desired your good advice, in this day's council, but we'll take to-morrow.<eos> Is't far you ride?<eos> As far, my lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper.<eos> Fail not our feast.<eos> My lord, I will not.<eos> Farewell.<eos> Let every man be master of his time till seven at night:<eos> To make society the sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself till supper-time alone.<eos> While then, God be with you!
- What happened? Nothing.<eos> The glass was cracked and it broke.<eos> That's all. - May I get you some champagne?<eos> - Oh, I should adore some.<eos> Daddy used to have a glass every morning at eleven.<eos> But of course, Henry doesn't like it.<eos> Mr Kentley, may I get you some?<eos> I'd prefer a little Scotch with a lot of water, if you don't mind.<eos> Is David here?<eos> I expected him to come with you.
It's odd the way one can pyramid simple facts into wild fantasies, isn't it?<eos> - We all do, don't we, Phillip ?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Particularly after a few drinks.<eos> How is yours, Rupert?<eos> I think I'll be running along.<eos> Phillip, you'll feel much better once you get out in the open air.<eos> I don't think there'll be much traffic and we ought to make good time.<eos> It's a lovely night and you'll be driving up in good weather.<eos> I almost wish I were going with you.
I don't know what's happened to him.<eos> He's probably drunk in some dive.<eos> - What's the pay? - $8 a day.<eos> Don't just stand there.<eos> Make up your mind, the ferry doesn't wait.<eos> - I'm your man. - Come on.<eos> - Hello, there. - Hello, yourself.<eos> Okay, you guys, get aboard.<eos> Take it your way.<eos> What's the matter with you two?
Belongs to Dude.<eos> He's kind of particular.<eos> Don't wanna get it dirty.<eos> Look, I shaved.<eos> Changed my shirt too.<eos> Smell like a lily.<eos> Even combed my hair, right around the part you gave me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I thought maybe you and me could make a deal.<eos> There's only one deal we'll make with you:
Make way, I tell you!<eos> Lets see what's inside there!<eos> What do you mean Joseph?<eos> Help me down, somebody!<eos> - I'll kill the next person...<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I'll kill the next person who touches these trunks<eos> That's an awful word to use Joseph.<eos> Did you hear what he said? My husband to be?<eos> This is my wedding present and I'm going to share it with you.
You could say it is almost the core of all our treatment methods-- development of knowledge of oneself with the accompanying safety that it brings.<eos> I'd like to see if we can get some illustrations of how one's personal safety would stem from childhood safety, and how the childhood safety itself would stem from the parents' safety.<eos> My illustration, as a child, whenever I underwent any experiences that were frightening to me, I never told my parents.<eos> I kept it to myself. While I was alone at night in my room I'd call on God.<eos> If I did anything wrong that I was ashamed of, I was ashamed to go to my parents and tell them what I had done.<eos> So I kept it to myself.<eos> And I used to... I know I used to be in constant fear that my parents would find out my feelings.<eos> Well, I wonder if there's any of your mother's troubles that you would know about.<eos> No, my mother never gave any of the children any part of her troubles.<eos> Well, that would be the same thing that happened to you.
Some find her beautiful.<eos> If I had 1,000 pieces of gold, I'd give them all for you.<eos> 1,000 pieces of gold?<eos> That's not enough.<eos> My price is high.<eos> My mistress awaits my coming.<eos> Who may your mistress be that you grudge me a few minutes of your company?<eos> She's the betrothed of Hulagu Khan.<eos> Return to your mistress, then.<eos> But know I shall come to you under the stars. And some day I will buy you for my very own.
- Yes, my Lady.<eos> - Everything is ready for you.<eos> - Then let's go quickly.<eos> My Lady...<eos> Come!<eos> Look!<eos> Your men torture my father.<eos> What is the meaning of this?<eos> Cut him down from the rack and...<eos> I'll marry you.
Don't talk about it.<eos> - We are silly to even listen.<eos> Old man just play games with our mind, that's all.<eos> But I have heard he has money, lots of it.<eos> Well, that's different.<eos> That's something else again, eh, Marius?<eos> Yeah, that would be different.<eos> You there.<eos> This fellow got lost in the swamp.<eos> I told him he could spend the night with you.
This is between you and me.<eos> Now first you say "I," and then your name.<eos> Promise that I will do everything in my power... "Promise that I will do everything in my power." ...to reach France, our country...<eos> I guess that's all, except to get in the boat and not waste any more of this good wind.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Good luck.<eos> So you see we have gone through quite something to get this far, Captain, and nobody is going to make us turn back now, if only for the little old man who didn't get to come with us.<eos> Yes, Grandpère is the real hero of our story.<eos> I agree with you.
Sure.<eos> Come ahead.<eos> Anybody got a match?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Who's that?<eos> She came in this afternoon. The plane from the south.<eos> Now look, Frenchy, about that other thing.<eos> I know where you stand and what your sympathies are.<eos> It's all right for you, but I don't want any part of it.<eos> If I'm caught fooling with you fellas, my goose'll be cooked.
Why should the enemy want to take this place?<eos> No such luck. We won't even see him from here.<eos> Now who's worrying?<eos> It couldn't be you, could it, Brewer?<eos> No, sir, it's Luke here.<eos> He's worrying about how the farmers get on.<eos> Let's hope we won't be here long enough to find out.<eos> - Are we moving, sir?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> That's what I'm here to tell you.
Amen.<eos> Why weren't you up there?<eos> I got no use for burials.<eos> Oh, coffee's more important, huh?<eos> - You don't think I care he's dead?<eos> - Why didn't you come up?<eos> - Sorry for that Jap?<eos> - Shut up!<eos> I don't take that from nobody!<eos> I'm surprised at you guys, all of you.
At the present time, they're approaching this position.<eos> The purpose of this combined operation is the first bombing of Japan.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Lieutenant Raymond will tell you your mission.<eos> Bombing planes must have information necessary to a successful operation.<eos> The weather, shore installations barrage balloon positions and the number and location of Japanese ships.<eos> We'll get that information to them by radio.<eos> After you are ashore, the Copperfin will proceed as near as possible to Tokyo.<eos> We'll obtain data that our fliers need on that city.<eos> - That will be transferred to you.
How?<eos> Bit right through it.<eos> Tore it to shreds with his teeth.<eos> With his teeth?<eos> Bruno!<eos> Stop it!<eos> What do you want here?<eos> I'm looking for an old gypsy woman.<eos> Maleva is her name.<eos> Is she here with you?
All right.<eos> Get inside.<eos> I'm sorry I blew up just now but that crack that guy made about my tank kind of burned me.<eos> She's a good tank.<eos> I'll tell you once again.<eos> We got it over the radio.<eos> We're surrounded, and the only way out is south.<eos> That's the way we're going.<eos> Good luck, sir.<eos> Wait a minute, we're coming with you.
Get back in your places.<eos> Waco, start her up.<eos> We're moving on right now.<eos> Those birds know just when to show up.<eos> They can smell death ahead of time.<eos> - Anybody know what he's babbling about?<eos> - I speak English.<eos> Speak very good.<eos> You don't leave me here.<eos> You take me with you?
Still, it's the duty of every man in the armed forces to do everything he can.<eos> If you'll excuse me, nine of us with peashooters doesn't make any sense.<eos> If it's our duty to try and delay this column, what's the talk about?<eos> Just give us our orders.<eos> That brings us down to cases.<eos> I look at it this way.<eos> Because it is a 100-to-1 shot.<eos> Because it's so much more than "line of duty."<eos> Because there's so little chance of any of us coming out of it.<eos> I felt I ought to put it up to you.
No, but I think she would see me.<eos> - Vin!<eos> - Hello, Carol.<eos> It's all right, Chandler.<eos> It's nice of you to come.<eos> Well, I wanted to find out if everything's all right.<eos> Do come in.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> After a terrific row with Mr. Foley my grandmother's agreed to obey the blackout regulations.<eos> - I was worried about you.
Upon my word!<eos> - Sirens, milady.<eos> - I'm not deaf.<eos> - Get all the servants quickly to the cellar.<eos> - You too, Granny.<eos> He said so.<eos> The cellar!<eos> Hello?<eos> That you, Dad?<eos> All right with you?
He could move if it had flexible joints.<eos> Ventilation would be a problem.<eos> The pilot would snuff out like that.<eos> - I don't believe you can do it.<eos> - Why does it have to be armor?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I think Blake's got something there.<eos> Look, If we design it like this, on the principle of a diving suit with flexible joints here, yet capable of holding oxygen inside I think we'll have something.<eos> Look.<eos> I'd like to work on it with you if you're willing.
Now, what about some nice hot crumpets, sir, huh?<eos> Of course, we mustn't spoil our appetite for dinner tonight.<eos> Miss Beatrix would be after me properly if we did that, sir.<eos> And besides, Mrs. Marley's butler tells me that their new cook is really first-class, sir.<eos> Sir, what about your tea, sir?<eos> Shall I serve it down there, sir?<eos> Now, look here, sir, you must have something, you know.<eos> Mrs. Marley, my deepest apologies.<eos> You doctors.<eos> I know we can never rely on you.
Why a camp?<eos> No, we just take them back because our religion tells us to.<eos> - The Hutterite religion?<eos> - The Christian religion.<eos> Is it one of your rules to sing like this?<eos> We haven't any rules.<eos> We sing because we like to.<eos> It's good for the digestion.<eos> Well, good night.<eos> The leader will look after you.
Our job is to make this the finest regiment that the United States ever saw.<eos> I needn't tell most of you that a regiment is more than just 600 disciplined soldiers.<eos> Men die but a regiment lives on.<eos> Because a regiment has an immortal soul of its own.<eos> Well, the way to begin is to find it to find something that belongs to us alone.<eos> Something to give us that pride in ourselves, that will make men endure and if necessary, die with their boots on.<eos> As for the rest, it's easy.<eos> Since it's only hard work hard riding and hard fighting.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I know I can count on you.
Tommy, let's have the second 24 bars. Ready? One and two and...<eos> Tommy, let's have the second 24 bars.<eos> Ready? One and two and...<eos> - That's much better, thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> All right, now listen, kids.<eos> I want the whole number.<eos> Places, please.<eos> It's "Boogie Barcarolle," from the top.<eos> I'll do it with you.
- Name?<eos> - Joad.<eos> Say, what is all this here?<eos> - Joad.<eos> Not here.<eos> - License?<eos> Oklahoma E-L-2-0-4.<eos> Don't check.<eos> Now, you look here.<eos> We don't want no trouble with you.
But you agree we got to get him out in a hurry?<eos> Yes, but we'll do it my way.<eos> - This is a sample of your future.<eos> - Get in, Russ. Get in.<eos> Hold them off as long as you can.<eos> I'll send word from Wichita.<eos> - Say, what the...<eos> - Keep calm, it's official business. Come on.<eos> I'm Sheriff Hatton of Dodge City. I've got a prisoner here for Wichita.<eos> - Is it all right if we ride with you?
You needn't be so amused.<eos> She's after your beau now.<eos> That's mighty flattering of you, Miss Scarlett.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Why's your sister mad?<eos> You sparking her beau?<eos> As if I couldn't do better than that old maid in britches.<eos> Brent and Stuart, you handsome old things!<eos> - I didn't mean it.<eos> I'm mad at you!
I'll see what I can do.<eos> Why's your sister mad?<eos> You sparking her beau?<eos> As if I couldn't do better than that old maid in britches.<eos> Brent and Stuart, you handsome old things!<eos> - I didn't mean it.<eos> I'm mad at you!<eos> - What have we done?<eos> You haven't been near me all day! I wore this old dress for you.<eos> I was counting on eating with you.
- So I took them to Belle's.<eos> - And she took them in?<eos> She's by way of being an old friend of mine.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry...<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't think up a more dignified alibi.<eos> This isn't the first time you've come between me and disaster.<eos> It isn't likely that I'd question any device of yours.<eos> And now I'll go and see what Dr. Meade needs.<eos> Have you no interest in what's become of your own husband?<eos> Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?
I'm sure sorry.<eos> Well, I'm sorry too.<eos> I wasn't talkin' about her.<eos> She's gone.<eos> It's you I'm sorry for.<eos> Zee!<eos> - It's Zee. - Zee?<eos> - I can hardly believe my eyes. - Zee!<eos> - How are you, Zee?<eos> - I've worried so about you all.
So you couldn't keep her from leaving school after all.<eos> Yes, but not for want of trying.<eos> I swear that we won't let it happen again!<eos> How?<eos> I failed because I was alone.<eos> But if we united--<eos> United against whom?<eos> You don't have to join if you don't want to, Suzanne.<eos> But the rest of you--<eos> If we could find a way to prevent this injustice, could I count on you?
But he does love you.<eos> I was jealous of you.<eos> That's why--<eos> Jealous?<eos> You poor child.<eos> Because he loved you and me not at all.<eos> He told me so.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said, "I love her more than life. "<eos> And then I warned him against you, but he laughed and went in to you.
Did you find my hat?<eos> And you don't have any money.<eos> Madame needs lots of things.<eos> What will you do without money?<eos> They trampled it.<eos> It's all ruined.<eos> I speak my mind.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> Madame won't be happy with you.<eos> Will you take me with you?
Tarzan, believe me when the moon has made safari three times three times, and when she comes out of the river, big and round and looks in on us here, she'll find us as we are now.<eos> Together.<eos> And my safari will be over forever.<eos> And I will never go away again.<eos> Tarzan and Jane.<eos> Understand?<eos> Understand.<eos> Bravo, Rawlins!<eos> Now let's see you strangle a lion.<eos> - I'm going with you.
I had a shot at him myself. Let me phone the High Commissioner for Canada in London.<eos> You better do that from London.<eos> You'll be there soon enough. It'll save you the cost of a trunk call.<eos> That's the Professor's car all right.<eos> Hannay must be inside spilling the beans.<eos> - Stop him there!<eos> How do you do? We're all waiting for you.<eos> Pamela's gone to meet you at the station.<eos> This way, this way. ...From our respected leader and standard bearer himself...<eos> I welcome this opportunity to discuss with you another question vital... to the import of our country at this critical and momentous hour.
Wait a minute.<eos> I'II stay right here.<eos> well, well?<eos> Come on, Iet's get going.<eos> Why don't you watch that...!<eos> Turn around there.<eos> - Look where you're going!<eos> Get that car out of here!<eos> Get that thing out of here and pull over there.<eos> I wanna talk to you!
Well, maybe it ain't so hot.<eos> - Maybe we can't buck Little Arnie.<eos> - I can.<eos> You're too good, that's what.<eos> Hello, Joe.<eos> You were in a big hurry about getting here, weren't you?<eos> Maybe this kind of work ain't to your liking.<eos> Joe's all right.<eos> He's in with us.<eos> Yeah, I'm in with you.
Otero told me I don't look good in a derby.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - Looks just like you.<eos> - I thought so.<eos> I guess I'll stick to them from now on.<eos> "Compliments to a true pal.<eos> Mr. C. Bandello from a true pal Mr. Sam Vettori. " Well, that's nice.<eos> I appreciate, Sam.<eos> That's swell of you.<eos> What's the matter with you birds?
The Captain is charming, isn't he?<eos> - I'm fascinated.<eos> I'm fascinated, too.<eos> Right on the arm.<eos> Fascinated, whim-wham!<eos> If I were Eugene O'Neill, I could tell you what I really think of you two.<eos> You're fortunate the Theater Gill isn't putting this on.<eos> And so is The Gill.<eos> Pardon me while I have a strange interlude.<eos> You couple of baboons, what makes you think I'd marry either one of you?
Come on now, give the little girl a big hand.<eos> Speech, big speech.<eos> My good friends, if I could only tell you how rosy-hued everything seems to be tonight.<eos> As I look into your faces, they're all lit with gay laughter.<eos> The whole world, and everything in it is bathed in a soft, flowing, luminous haze.<eos> The old gal is stewed to the eyebrows.<eos> And now, I want to wish you all a most enjoyable evening.<eos> As for myself, I'm sad.<eos> I simply can't go any further.<eos> I'll get off with you.
Donald Smith, technological connoisseur and resident mouth breather.<eos> Alright.<eos> Alright... Do it.<eos> Go...<eos> - Go.<eos> Put your meat in his mouth.<eos> - He's taking it.<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> Damn redneck, hillbillies.<eos> So tell us what's been happening with you.
He gets sensitive to change in pressure.<eos> I'd see that happens before when spirits are around.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> It's a good sign.<eos> Alright, let's get audio and video up.<eos> Donnie set up the batteries and don't be afraid to tell people what you need.<eos> It doesn't sounds good If things happened, we don't get it on camera.<eos> Why did Sam Chapman think you had such a connection to the house?<eos> So your mother knew Martha and the victims, but so what.<eos> What does that have to do with you?
I didn't quit! All right.<eos> You know that dipshit lady on Channel Eleven who does the segments where she tries new things?<eos> - Yeah. Go on.<eos> - Well, she wanted bangs, but then afterwards she decided that she didn't want bangs.<eos> And my manager started bitching me out, so I shoved him and his American Girl Doll glasses broke.<eos> Okay. So you got fired.<eos> Why do you keep doing this, Mom?<eos> You wanna have a cereal party? No, I don't.<eos> I want you to be responsible so that I don't have to be.<eos> It is too stressful sleeping with you on a pull-out couch in your friend's dining room.
Call him.<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Hi! Hae-Won!<eos> No, Hae-Won.<eos> Right, sorry. You made it.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> What?<eos> Look at this flock of hotties. Wow.<eos> You look so happy. You look so free and not oppressed at all.<eos> We were worried about you.
- Do you wanna do some shots? - Yeah.<eos> Hi, I'd like to make a noise complaint.<eos> Winter is coming, bitches.<eos> - So, what's this order again? - All right.<eos> It goes salt.<eos> Shot.<eos> And then we suck on these?<eos> No, you throw them at each other. That's the way you're supposed to.<eos> - Maura? - That's what...<eos> Some guy here to see you?
God. Go.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> I'm really itchy.<eos> It went up my nose.<eos> It went up my butt.<eos> Are we gonna die?<eos> No, this stuff's safe. This is all from the '70s.<eos> Wow! This is fucked up!<eos> I wanna do that foam thing like we saw at the Fart Mitzvah.<eos> Ooh! I need to talk to you outside.
- Yeah.<eos> Great. Okay.<eos> They told me that they're gonna help us get a house.<eos> Do you want me to come down there and we can talk about it?<eos> We're all pretty wiped from packing.<eos> You know, I would say maybe just get some rest and...<eos> So come over in the morning.<eos> Wait. You want me to come there in the morning?<eos> You have been begging me for weeks to tell you where I am, and now that I'm here you're gonna blow me off?<eos> No, I'm not blowing you off!
You're such a weirdo.<eos> Remember, I can throw a car at you.<eos> Maybe it'll look better in the daylight?<eos> Why is it blue?<eos> Well, we are totally fucked.<eos> My God, Mom, don't say "fucked."<eos> It sounds so wrong coming out of your mouth.<eos> Too fucking bad.<eos> I'm pissed.<eos> And I'll say whatever I wanna say because I am cuntingly disappointed in you!
Ma, I'll come visit you real soon.<eos> Jacob.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Iwantyoutoknow howproudIamofyou.<eos> Foreverythingyou'vedone.<eos> Get some sleep now.<eos> Iloveyou,sweetie.<eos> Iloveyousomuch .<eos> Everything allright,Jacob?<eos> Everything's going okay by you?
Ican'tgiveyou anothernightoff,Nicks.<eos> I don't want another night off.<eos> It's just that, every day is the same.<eos> I like it that way, but Wednesday nights I gotta kinda reset.<eos> And it throws me off a little bit.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm gonna give you Wednesday nights.<eos> I'll move Tito to the day shift.<eos> Thanks, Frank, I appreciate it.<eos> You think I give a fuck about you?
And it throws me off a little bit.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm gonna give you Wednesday nights.<eos> I'll move Tito to the day shift.<eos> Thanks, Frank, I appreciate it.<eos> You think I give a fuck about you?<eos> I don't give a shit about you.<eos> You're making my life easier.<eos> Tito falls asleep halfway through the fucking picture anyway.<eos> At least with you, I don't got to worry about that.
I caught a glimpse of some of your film.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> I was simply checking the exposure, that's all.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> I didn't intend to look at it, man.<eos> It just happened.<eos> Sully, I trusted you.<eos> Nicks, I don't know what to say.<eos> I mean, I'm truly sorry, okay?<eos> I'm concerned about you, kid.
-What?<eos> -The sound.<eos> -What?<eos> -Wait.<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> It's nothing?<eos> You think I'm an idiot, don't you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The only reason I fucked you is because I felt sorry for you.
You need some sleep.<eos> -You want one?<eos> -Sure.<eos> One for him, too.<eos> Is that guy still following you?<eos> You know how you always ask me if there's anything I need?<eos> Like what?<eos> You know, you know.<eos> How do I know you're not a snitch?<eos> I'm just joking with you, man.
Leave me alone, you freak!<eos> I never want to see you again!<eos> Ivana!<eos> Doyourealize whatyou'vedone?<eos> Doyourealizehow many refundsI hadto give?<eos> Justtakeit outofmy paycheck.<eos> It's not about the money I lost tonight.<eos> It's about the fact that those customers will never come to this theater again.<eos> I don't know what happened, Frank.<eos> Something's going on with you.
Could it be as high as 90?<eos> Jesus, Robby.<eos> I need to know, Jim.<eos> I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't important.<eos> You gotta stop this, Robby.<eos> Robby, Macleish's assistant said he's all booked up.<eos> He can't see us.<eos> Yeah! Well, the hell he can't.<eos> All right. That'll be fun.<eos> You know what? I'll catch up with you, okay?
When did I stop liking beans?<eos> Beans?<eos> Way to kill the mood, babe.<eos> -Seriously.<eos> -What?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Did I ever like them?<eos> No.<eos> Something doesn't feel right.<eos> Yeah, that just might be the amnesia messing with you.
Open this door at once.<eos> Albert, you're scaring her.<eos> Shut up.<eos> I swear to God, I will kick this door down if you don't open the door this minute!<eos> Daddy...<eos> Albert, stop it.<eos> Stop it.<eos> January, open this door!<eos> January...<eos> I'm angry with you, darling.
Just be brave.<eos> Please!<eos> Please...<eos> Please!<eos> Please!<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> Please don't!<eos> Clean yourself up.<eos> He might not show it, but Daddy really does care for you.
HH E L P MM EE.<eos> What happened?<eos> Where did he go?<eos> Hey. Wait up.<eos> What the fuck...<eos> Nice try, daemean!<eos> - Drew, Drew. - Dude.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> - Come on. Hey, hey.<eos> Drew. - What the hell is wrong you?
Like, right at the really big pad.<eos> The come pad.<eos> Daphne!<eos> That's sick.<eos> Can we also raise a glass to Daphne's husband, for getting us these cameras?<eos> - Yeah, so...<eos> - Wait a second.<eos> He had no business buying those.<eos> He doesn't have a job.<eos> Okay, well, at least he married you instead of jacking off while you were in the shower.
Look what I got.<eos> Ivan.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I would like to say something.<eos> Quickly, if everyone could...<eos> Could listen for a second.<eos> To my girlfriend, my beautiful girlfriend of six wonderful years.<eos> I want to marry you more than anything I've ever wanted in my entire life.
Phil, what are you doing?<eos> What's going on?<eos> You were being really funny last night.<eos> You were drunk, it was like great, classic wedding material kind of stuff.<eos> It was...<eos> I thought it would be good to get hidden camera stuff, so I...<eos> I set up a camera right here.<eos> - You left it running?<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you.
- What's going on?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - I know you're lying to me.<eos> - Just leave me alone.<eos> - I know something...<eos> - Stop being a cunt.<eos> If you don't tell me, I'm gonna fucking divorce you, I swear to God.<eos> Jon got a blow job last night.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
It's amazing to me that he's gonna go have sex with Tammy.<eos> Also, it's crazy that I am getting married after you guys put a fucking ring in my girlfriend's sundae without me even knowing about it.<eos> What?<eos> What did you just say?<eos> - No, no.<eos> - It was a prank?<eos> - No, it wasn't a prank.<eos> - It was a fucking prank.<eos> - No, it started...<eos> - What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> It started off as a prank, Sarah.<eos> But it...<eos> Are you fucking kidding me, Ivan?<eos> - I'm not kidding you anything.<eos> - Stop the bullshit.<eos> Stop your fucking bullshit.<eos> You fucking got engaged to me on a prank.<eos> People can't be pushed to do something they don't really wanna do.<eos> What's wrong with you?
You fucking got engaged to me on a prank.<eos> People can't be pushed to do something they don't really wanna do.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Shut up, Ivan. Shut the fuck up.<eos> And I thought for once in your fucking life, that you were making a decision based on something that was real.<eos> But instead, you were just going along with whatever the fuck was in front of you, like you always do.<eos> You're a fucking shitty, stupid, fucking coward.<eos> And you're not funny, you have terrible jokes!<eos> And I can't get this fucking ring off!<eos> And I don't want to be with you anymore, okay?

I just wanna get home.<eos> - Sarah.<eos> - Just go.<eos> When I watched you look down and see that fake two-dollar ring in that sundae, something happened to me.<eos> I wanna believe you so bad.<eos> See, that's what I'm saying to you.<eos> It was all real.<eos> All of it.<eos> I love you.<eos> I wanna marry you, Sarah.
Head straight north.<eos> There's gonna be thousands of refugees.<eos> Just get into that stream and don't look up.<eos> We got one shot.<eos> Let's make it count.<eos> Good luck, Katniss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Pollux.<eos> Tigris, thank you for everything you've done.<eos> Katniss, let me come with you, okay?
- 'Dead? '<eos> No.<eos> Shit.<eos> Eddie, I'm gonna have to go.<eos> Call you back later.<eos> 'Frank? '<eos> Morning.<eos> Now, shut up.<eos> Move now!<eos> - 'What happened to you? '
I know.<eos> No!<eos> I got it.<eos> You have no idea of the strings I had to pull to keep Homeland Security from pressing charges, Casey.<eos> This is not just vandalism. All right?<eos> - It's NASA.<eos> It's government property.<eos> - Have you ever seen this before?<eos> You're not getting it, are you?<eos> I am very upset with you!
- We need to go back over, Frank.<eos> - Back over there?<eos> Yes, yes, Frank, we need to go back over.<eos> Good. Great.<eos> That's just great.<eos> You know, hey, I got stung by a bee. Let's jump on the hive.<eos> That's a terrible analogy.<eos> That's a fantastic analogy.<eos> What do you know about analogies?<eos> You know, you're impossible to talk to when you're like this.
Now, of course, I can't tell you everything, but suffice it to say Igor and I stand upon the cusp of creating life out of death.<eos> Mr. Frankenstein...<eos> Victor. Please.<eos> I find your promise more than a little unsettling.<eos> Superstitious, are we?<eos> No.<eos> Are you not afraid to challenge the natural order?<eos> Igor, speak up.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Once, I would have agreed with you, Lorelei, but think about it.
What is that? !<eos> Oh.<eos> Igor Straussman, meet Igor Straussman.<eos> What?<eos> What did you do to him? !<eos> Found him like that a couple months ago.<eos> Overdose.<eos> A couple of months?<eos> You took his eyes!<eos> Victor, what is wrong with you?
Because of you.<eos> Hey. Hey. What are you doing?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Stop!<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> No. Stop!<eos> Ow. Ow. Why you little...<eos> Come back here!<eos> Berries!<eos> What's with you?
I got you!<eos> Nash, the herd! Yah! Yah!<eos> Yah!<eos> Giddy up.<eos> Come on now. Giddy up! Yah!<eos> Watch out!<eos> Nobody steals our longhorns.<eos> Finders keepers.<eos> Come on now.<eos> Momma wants to play with you.
Watch out!<eos> Nobody steals our longhorns.<eos> Finders keepers.<eos> Come on now.<eos> Momma wants to play with you.<eos> I know you're there.<eos> I can smell you.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, shoot! That's my favorite tooth!<eos> I'm gonna love ending you!
- Hey, Manuel.<eos> Come on, Copiapo!<eos> Lucho.<eos> Tomorrow is my free day, but... I would like to work.<eos> I'm kind of short of money.<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> I know there is a lot of people asking you for the same thing, but...<eos> You got it.<eos> You're not going to fight me or anything?<eos> I'm not going to fight you.
I have a duty to the safety of these men.<eos> At this moment, the refuge is the safest place.<eos> There's a radio.<eos> There's food.<eos> Some of these guys need patching up.<eos> You know me, Lucho.<eos> There is no way out until there is no way out.<eos> I'm going to check out those ladders.<eos> Don Luis. Excuse me.<eos> I'm coming with you.
Alex!<eos> If you really want to do this, don't do it alone.<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> - No, let's do it together.<eos> Yes, I am crazy! I am crazy!<eos> I am completely out of my mind.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I have a daughter.<eos> And a wife.<eos> And you have a wife with a baby on the way, and they're counting on you, Alex.
You have a week.<eos> I won't sleep till it's complete.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You want to share a cab?<eos> Jim: Was I playing the beard tonight?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Well, either you came to the lab with Klaus or you got there through the wormhole.<eos> I did arrive with Klaus.<eos> But I'm leaving with you.
Should I?<eos> It's yours.<eos> It is now.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What you and Klaus are doing is wrong, and it has to stop.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I know what you're up to, and I'm not gonna let it happen again.<eos> That's none of your business.<eos> It'll be my business if you and I get involved.<eos> Does this technique usually work for you?
It's right here.<eos> First of all, can I tell you something about Time magazine?<eos> I believe it's a training facility for paid assassins.<eos> "Jobs insists," I am quoting...<eos> I didn't invent math.<eos> "28% of the male population of the United States could be the father."<eos> I wasn't saying you've slept with 28% of American men.<eos> I was using an algorithm based on the blood test, which said there was a 94.1% chance that I'm the father.<eos> You're trying to publicly paint me as a slut and a whore.<eos> Believe me, I'm not trying to publicly do anything with you.
Lisa, wait for me in the hall, please.<eos> You can put your coat on in the hall.<eos> Bye, Lisa.<eos> Bye.<eos> Lisa, in the hall. Now.<eos> I just wanna know, when you say you're gonna put money in my account, how much we're talking about.<eos> It's a school day. She needs to be in school.<eos> I'm gonna give you whatever you need.<eos> Woz wants me to acknowledge the Apple II team.<eos> You must be able to see that she looks like you.
- Yes. You said you wouldn't compete with them, but you designed a computer specifically for the education market, which they putatively own.<eos> So, I think it's cool they're here.<eos> They're suing me.<eos> Still.<eos> It was nice they came.<eos> They're not being magnanimous.<eos> They want it to look like an amicable divorce.<eos> History doesn't remember Joe DiMaggio kindly for dumping Marilyn. Steve.<eos> What's your problem?<eos> I don't know, but I'm sure it can be traced back to you.
I can't really think of the word.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, have a good day at school. "Regretful."<eos> What?<eos> Like, wishing you could go back and do things different.<eos> You're too young to be regretful.<eos> Not me.<eos> The person singing the song.<eos> Got it. "Regretful." That makes sense because...<eos> I wanna live with you.
She's been acting weird for months.<eos> She's turned on me.<eos> - Fix it.<eos> - What the...<eos> - Fix it, Steve.<eos> - Take it easy!<eos> Fix it or I quit. How about that?<eos> I quit and you never see me again.<eos> How about that?<eos> Tell me what's wrong with you this morning.
Jade thinks you're pretty, too.<eos> Man, this road sucks.<eos> Is that your house? Uh-huh.<eos> Oh, cool.<eos> Right there.<eos> This place is creepy. I don't like it.<eos> Is that another one of your fortune teller's visions?<eos> This is cool.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Hey, you want me to come with you'?
We can't just leave her here. She's a kid.<eos> We got to at least wait until her parents show up.<eos> Are you looking to adopt, Tyler, or what'?<eos> Yeah, besides, we're missing the Chili Peppers.<eos> Hey, where you going?<eos> It's my playtime now.<eos> All right, but don't go too far away, okay'?<eos> Lucy, Lucy, come here, come here.<eos> Hi, Mommy. Oh, my God.<eos> I was so worried about you.
- No.<eos> - Come on.<eos> It's your turn this time.<eos> On three?<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Clock's ticking.<eos> Chop, chop.<eos> Doesn't he drive you nuts?<eos> I've gotten used to him.<eos> I've been dreaming of you.
All right.<eos> Morphine, good idea.<eos> Ticket to paradise.<eos> Give him a heavy dose while he's still inside.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> What choice do I have?<eos> - There's another way.<eos> - We don't have time.<eos> It's as simple as ABC.<eos> Hey, what's the matter with you?
Or did you really try to kill me?<eos> Just let me in.<eos> We can talk about it.<eos> Let you in?<eos> You have gone nuts.<eos> No, you're a danger to me.<eos> You're a danger to the sleepers.<eos> You're a danger to this whole facility.<eos> - Bauer, please.<eos> - It's not like I'm mad at you.
We can talk about it.<eos> Let you in?<eos> You have gone nuts.<eos> No, you're a danger to me.<eos> You're a danger to the sleepers.<eos> You're a danger to this whole facility.<eos> - Bauer, please.<eos> - It's not like I'm mad at you.<eos> No, I take it back.<eos> I'm pretty mad at you.
You don't know the situation.<eos> You don't know what's in my heart.<eos> 'Cause you're racist!<eos> Okay. Whoa! No!<eos> And you smell weird!<eos> I'm sorry, you don't.<eos> Julia, I'm gonna need your help.<eos> No, I am not touching her.<eos> She seems sticky.<eos> Get physical with me, and I will get physical with you!
Where's Sophie?<eos> Uh, she's with a guy who doesn't wanna be in a relationship, so it's a real treat for her.<eos> What's your name?<eos> My name?<eos> Yeah, I realized...<eos> I was kinda having fun not knowing, but now I think it's more weird than adorable.<eos> Is it hot in here? Um...<eos> I don't really like my name.<eos> I just kinda... I kinda hate it and it makes me angry.<eos> And I've been really honest with you about everything.
You're really upset about that.<eos> Hey, Monster, it's me.<eos> I'm...<eos> I don't think before I act sometimes but I'm not a bad person.<eos> You think bad people have the capacity to... Love and stuff?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You've been through a lot and I'm...<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't go.<eos> I just wanna talk to you, that's all.
Ten guys?<eos> Yeah, other than you and Moon.<eos> From what you've said, that sounds appropriate.<eos> But, Richie, what I'm trying to...<eos> No buts.<eos> Get outta here.<eos> Go.<eos> Martha.<eos> Martha.<eos> There's two guys here from the FBI to see you.
I mean, I did think you were joking, in fairness.<eos> Martha, we should call the police now.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm gonna shoot you in the armpit.<eos> Great, great.<eos> Can't wait.<eos> I would never do that, I'm not gonna shoot her.<eos> We've got a dead body in our home, hello!<eos> How about if I miss your armpit, I'm gonna shoot you in the eye?<eos> I'm not talking to you right now.
I like turtles, you dick!<eos> Johnny, Richie's dead!<eos> The guy you are calling is dead.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Super-good.<eos> Super-good.<eos> It's not that I'm angry with you.
We can do that for him.<eos> Well.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> What did we do to deserve you?<eos> - Sweet dreams.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Well, you can't argue with mom.<eos> Happy it is. Team happy!<eos> Sounds great!<eos> Totally behind you, Joy.
- Atta girl.<eos> All right, everyone, fresh start.<eos> We are gonna have a good day, which will turn into a good week, which will turn into a good year, which turns into a good life!<eos> So, the big day! New school, new friends, huh?<eos> I know!<eos> I'm kind of nervous, but I'm mostly excited.<eos> How do I look?<eos> Do you like my shirt?<eos> Very cute!<eos> Are you gonna be okay? You want us to walk with you?
- What? - So long, sucker!<eos> I hurt all over.<eos> Wait. I know you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I get that a lot. I look like a lot of people.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I do. Bing bong! Riley's imaginary friend!<eos> - You really do know me?<eos> - Well, of course!<eos> Riley loved playing with you!
I only teach one thing.<eos> I just teach this moment.<eos> Pay attention to this moment.<eos> And everything is there... perfect... and complete.<eos> Just as it is.<eos> You're so quiet.<eos> You keep everything to yourself.<eos> You have love in you.<eos> I know it.<eos> When I'm with you...
Thumb, first finger, third finger, left, fourth finger, third finger, second finger, thumb, right hand, thumb, first finger, second finger, thumb...<eos> Have I found you?<eos> Can it be?<eos> Answer me.<eos> So this is what we are.<eos> A fire.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Away.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> I wanna go away with you.
Come on, Max.<eos> Of course, I would remember.<eos> I have really good memory.<eos> It's not just the Adderall.<eos> Hey, do you want anything?<eos> I'm gonna go get a popcorn and then we can dump MM'S into it.<eos> That way, every handful is, like, kind of suspenseful?<eos> Sure.<eos> Hey, Chris, I'm just gonna have a Diet Coke and a child-size popcorn, but make sure to dump half of it into the garbage. You remember, right?<eos> You know what, I'm just going to come with you.
Not for you.<eos> Very bad!<eos> It's too bad all the girls are so busted.<eos> The only way you or I are going to get any is with angel eyes over there.<eos> What?<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> These girls are slamming, my man.<eos> And I am going to do all of them.<eos> Yum! By the way, what's with you and Max?
That's not who I'm supposed to be, remember?<eos> I'm just the shy girl with the clipboard and the guitar.<eos> Yeah, but you wanted to change that.<eos> - Honey, let me do this.<eos> - No.<eos> Max, I'm not afraid.<eos> I wanted to save you.<eos> Max, you did.<eos> You did, Max.<eos> Just by letting me be here with you.
It was my idea to take Mallory rafting that day.<eos> You can't blame yourself for what happened.<eos> It's just different when it's your own kid.<eos> I know.<eos> Sometimes I can't get that look she had outta my head.<eos> The moment she realized... that I wasn't gonna be able to save her.<eos> And then coming home every day to you and Blake only made it harder.<eos> Because nothing was the way it used to be. And the way it used to be was...<eos> It was perfect.<eos> I should've let you in.
I do everything, but you... You aren't nice to me and I don't like this, I really don't like this.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, now listen,<eos> - please, please...<eos> - Yes?<eos> Can we use that to call emergency?<eos> Oh my God, oh my God.<eos> - Don't fucking touch her.<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> Yes of course!<eos> Man, what's wrong with you?
But first, first, first...<eos> First of all...<eos> Bring it to me.<eos> Oh my God, you are sick.<eos> No!<eos> Bring me this and I give you radio.<eos> I never lie, I always keep my promise.<eos> I promise when I get off this landmine, I'm gonna fuck your world up.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Look at me, you piece of shit, I'm talking to you!
Dog has no hands, look, look at my dog.<eos> Has he hands?<eos> No.<eos> Come, come, Alicia, let me explain.<eos> Let's do it, let's do it together, Like a team, come on, come on, doggy!<eos> Go!<eos> Go, go.<eos> Come on, go.<eos> Go.<eos> He is playing with you.
Actually, you know what, let's have a little stage.<eos> Let's have a little stage.<eos> Yeah, there we go, Now we got a nice, fun thing.<eos> Everybody can see.<eos> Here we go, okay?<eos> So now we're gonna play the game.<eos> Strip.<eos> Strip.<eos> Hey, do it to me, do it to me, okay?<eos> - Do it to you?
Everybody can see.<eos> Here we go, okay?<eos> So now we're gonna play the game.<eos> Strip.<eos> Strip.<eos> Hey, do it to me, do it to me, okay?<eos> - Do it to you?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Please.<eos> Why would I do it to you you fat fuck?
What's the deal?<eos> I'm not responsible for others' actions.<eos> He's much older than her.<eos> It's alright, he's only...<eos> He's at least 20!<eos> You realize he's old!<eos> Ok.<eos> I'm going for a dip.<eos> What did I say?<eos> Wait for me, I'm coming with you.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> By the way -- If you're looking for your boxers, the ones I gave you for Father's Day, they're in my room.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Good night, Dad.<eos> You're letting her go out again?<eos> She didn't come home late.<eos> You're not even going out in your dreams.<eos> I'm good here.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I want to sleep with you.
You're a pain in the ass!<eos> - You don't care about me!<eos> You only think of yourself.<eos> Not eating?<eos> You're really pathetic.<eos> Marie...<eos> Louna, can I come in?<eos> Leave me alone, I'm tired!<eos> You're pissing me off! Fuck off!<eos> Antoine, I have to talk to you.
What?<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> Fucker!<eos> It's Loukoum.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to apologize for last night.<eos> - I was being awful.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> No, I wasn't respectful to you.
What are you talking about?<eos> What's she talking about?<eos> Fine then. Marie!<eos> Marie!<eos> It's nonstop.<eos> - It's one or the other. - What?<eos> When it's not one, it's the other.<eos> I didn't say come in.<eos> Don't talk to me like that.<eos> How should I talk to you?
Well, Richard was there.<eos> You remember Richard, don't you?<eos> Well, he's gonna be writing this article and it just reminded me that there was some stuff that you and I...<eos> Can you turn that off?<eos> Just out it on pause.<eos> Conrad, can you please turn that off.<eos> Get out!<eos> Get the fuck out.<eos> Don't you speak to me like that.<eos> I'm just trying to talk to you!
At the risk of reducing them to an example, to victims.<eos> In times of war or extreme poverty, the codes for civilized behavior are suspended.<eos> And so-called normal life, nobody would go to a house where people are grieving and photograph them.<eos> I try to approach people with respect. I try not to speak to loud. Or move to fast.<eos> I want to be open.<eos> I want to feel open in my heart toward them. And, they do sense it.<eos> Even with no words at all.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Hey, come sit down.<eos> Hey, I just wanted to talk to you.
- No, I don't think he will.<eos> But she was depressed, you know that, right?<eos> I mean you were away at college, I mean,<eos> Sometimes I think it must have been really hard for you.<eos> I mean, it was tough here.<eos> You don't know what was really going on, I mean, it was...<eos> Yeah you couldn't know what was going on.<eos> Actually,<eos> I did know what was going on cause she called me all the time.<eos> When she wouldn't talk to you, she would talk to me.
- Really? - Yeah.<eos> No, I mean, I don't really...<eos> I don't really think I have time for it.<eos> Mm. You're so good at what you do. You should have fun.<eos> Jonah?<eos> I'm glad I came.<eos> I had fun.<eos> Recently I have felt really tired.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> It's really good being here. With you.
Recently I have felt really tired.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> It's really good being here. With you.<eos> It makes me feel, like, um... Like I can still feel passionate about things.<eos> Are you sleeping?<eos> Yes, sorry, it's just like, it's such a mess up here.<eos> My father just has not dealt with, any of my mother's stuff, so...<eos> But weren't you supposed to lecture here this week?<eos> Hey, it's not, hey, hey! Not my fault if the gallery people keep like fucking it up, is it?<eos> - I'm just trying to talk to you.
Did it go on for long?<eos> A while. On and off.<eos> But it was never here.<eos> It was never stateside, it wasn't like...<eos> And I wanted to be with her Gene.<eos> I was ready to leave Samina and everything.<eos> But for her, It only made sense when we were working.<eos> So, when she stopped going, uh...<eos> That was it.<eos> She wanted to be with you.
I'm a mess.<eos> You're my own little hero.<eos> Coming through, coming through!<eos> - Drew, what happened?<eos> - Found her in the parking lot.<eos> - She's in and out.<eos> Stand clear. - Can you tell me your name?<eos> - Nick...<eos> - Do you have any allergies?<eos> Tell me who did this to you.

And then he pulled the trigger.<eos> And I scream and I hear a click.<eos> Some fucking games to play with another human.<eos> Right, Nicky?<eos> And I want to sue him, and you know who he is,<eos> - and you just let him walk away.<eos> - Just know I tried, Holly.<eos> Sure, you liar.<eos> Just know this one thing.<eos> All those times I told you I cared for you...
Trained to run around all commando.<eos> What were you?<eos> SBS?<eos> SRR?<eos> SAS?<eos> - Just "S".<eos> - Just "S".<eos> - "S" for special?<eos> - "S" for shut your mouth.<eos> It's not something I'm getting into with you.
My shift's starting.<eos> Yellow 11, that's it.<eos> Yellow 11 is the on line winner.<eos> Winner's rolling hot.<eos> You know who he is and you just let him walk away.<eos> We're quits, okay?<eos> - But I intend on gambling for hours.<eos> - I don't have hours.<eos> And you're safe in the casino, Kinnick.<eos> Nobody'll mug you in the casino.
Let me... just let me be!<eos> Let me be, please!<eos> I...<eos> I... you got the wrong idea!<eos> I'm really a good guy!<eos> I am!<eos> So you're not mad at me, then?<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Good, I'm not mad at you, either.
So what?<eos> He's messing with us?<eos> You know...<eos> What was that?<eos> Maybe he found Chris and Amelia.<eos> He probably found them fucking in the woods.<eos> Let's go, Nia.<eos> What if he's hurt?<eos> Let's keep going.<eos> This is freaking ridiculous. I got stuck with you.
- OK.<eos> - I am serious.<eos> OK.<eos> - OK?<eos> - OK.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ben?<eos> Is everything cool?<eos> Ben, is everything cool?<eos> I'm so worried about you.
Ha ha, you guys are so hilarious.<eos> There's no way I'm going in there.<eos> I am not going in there!<eos> Ben?<eos> Very funny guys.<eos> Pick on the new girl.<eos> I can hear you.<eos> Guys?<eos> This isn't real.<eos> They're just fucking with you.

I'm sorry for what happened to my friends.<eos> I know that I am responsible.<eos> That it's all my fault...<eos> But you shouldn't have punished them for what I did.<eos> I'm sorry for being selfish.<eos> I'm sorry for being stupid.<eos> For coming here to this forest, when I knew I should never return.<eos> I wish I had gone to the dance with you.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I know that... something horrible happened to you when you came here.
My new drinking buddies.<eos> Nice to meet you. Ron.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> What do you fancy?<eos> A bit of black or a bit of white?<eos> All right.<eos> Back to the bar, now!<eos> Right now!<eos> No, just leave your arse, so I can play with it.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
Go to sleep.<eos> Do you see that?<eos> Wait, wait, wait, what's wrong?<eos> What's the matter? - Er...<eos> Please say you're not doing this because you feel sorry for me.<eos> Or because you're into amputees.<eos> For me, the ultimate turn-on would be if you had no limbs at all.<eos> Mmm... OK, wow.<eos> Throw you in a bag, get your little nubs in there.<eos> Pull you out when I just wanna have my way with you and then just stick it back in.
No!<eos> Who's gonna look after us?<eos> What about when I grow up, when I need girl things?<eos> Daddy will be there.<eos> - Oh, great.<eos> Hey, I know about girl things.<eos> - And you'll have Miranda, and Jess too.<eos> You might not die.<eos> Oh, my darling.<eos> You just have to know my spirit will always be with you.
From The Broch to Peterhead and back again<eos> Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies<eos> Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain<eos> For we've received orders to come back to Blawearie<eos> From The Broch to Peterhead and back again<eos> Ah, Jean.<eos> All right, Jean, lass.<eos> Get in the house, you white-faced bitch!<eos> Get away!<eos> What's wrong with you now?
What the hell... are you getting... paid for?<eos> Help me strip him, Chris.<eos> It's a stroke, Chris.<eos> Yes, Doctor.<eos> He'll need a lot of looking after.<eos> Will's married Mollie Douglas.<eos> They've sailed from Southampton to the Argentine.<eos> Just blow the whistle if you need me.<eos> You're my flesh and blood.<eos> And I can do with you what I will.
I am that.<eos> How did the horses fare in the storm?<eos> I took them into the barn.<eos> Ewan Tavendale helped me.<eos> Ach, it's plain you've nae need for relatives here.<eos> I only pray you don't come to disaster.<eos> No need to cry about it yet, Auntie Janet.<eos> Ewan and I haven't lain together.<eos> We'll wait... till we're married.<eos> He's to marry you, then?
There's fools enough in the fight as it is.<eos> What a blether about a war.<eos> Och...<eos> Like I was asking, only.<eos> Aye, man.<eos> Aye, man.<eos> Chae Strachan.<eos> You're an exception.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> You know, I'd come back with you in the morning if only...
They can't hurt him any more.<eos> Even this can't hurt him.<eos> But I know right well you should know it, Chris.<eos> Ewan was shot... as a coward and a deserter out there in France.<eos> You're better always to know what's truth in a thing.<eos> For lies come creeping home to roost, Chris.<eos> You're young yet.<eos> You've hardly begun to live.<eos> And I swore to mysel' I'd tell you all so you'd never be vexed with me.<eos> I'll never be vexed with you for telling me this.
She didn't even come to kiss me goodbye.<eos> Chae... never said goodbye.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> Mind me when you're back at Blawearie.<eos> And will you look at my lass for me... when you see her again?<eos> And you give her that kiss... the kiss that I'll never give her.<eos> And she'll think I died like the rest of them.<eos> Don't tell her.<eos> Please, Chae... you're no' to tell my dear Chris.<eos> Mind that night of the storm, Chae... wi' you on horses?
Can you do me a favor and get my name to Rome?<eos> Mike Lane.<eos> And if that doesn't do the trick, I guess we'll just stop bothering you.<eos> You can follow me.<eos> Y'all chill down here.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> What's up?<eos> Sit your ass down.<eos> Malik, I'm sorry for the surprise, but a ghost is a ghost.<eos> I'll see you downstairs in a minute, okay?
I like cake.<eos> Do you have any idea what's going on out there?<eos> A lady is about to get...<eos> I don't even know how to put it into words.<eos> No, I'm a cookie guy.<eos> What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's red fucking velvet.<eos> I would take a pack of Oreos over that bullshit any day of the week.<eos> - What's wrong with you?
I know better than to blindly trust my sources.<eos> If anybody on Earth knows that, it's me.<eos> But this is different, okay?<eos> This has been months.<eos> My whole reputation's on the line, or what's left of it anyway.<eos> Mike, you are a good friend.<eos> And I owe you so much.<eos> So, so much.<eos> Mike, don't give up on me.<eos> Writing with you has been the only thing that's kept me going.
Plankton?<eos> When will my frustration-slash-humiliation end?<eos> - Plankton?<eos> - Not now, hon!<eos> I'm ranting-slash-raving.<eos> All right, what is it?<eos> Well, I was trying to tell you there's an angry mob outside.<eos> But now they're inside.<eos> I just work here.<eos> We'd like to have a word with you!
Oh. Very good, Bob.<eos> Oh... Oh, spectacular!<eos> I'm so proud of you boys.<eos> - Oh, Stuart. - Ah.<eos> For you, I have this beautiful, super duper incredible snow globe.<eos> And, look look.<eos> Hours of excitement.<eos> Oh, ah.<eos> Yippee. Thank you.<eos> Oh, Stuart. We're just messing with you.
- Shut up.<eos> You're gonna embarrass everybody.<eos> This needs to stop.<eos> What?<eos> I took that noose down.<eos> Reese, I took that down.<eos> You saw me take it down, man.<eos> The stairs?<eos> Can you guys please stop messing with me?<eos> We're not messing with you.
You'd punish me, you'd use this stuff on me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - What would I get out of this?<eos> Me.<eos> If we were to do this, this would be your room.<eos> You can decorate it however you like.<eos> You want me to move in?<eos> Not full time, just Friday through to Sunday<eos> - We can negotiate the particulars<eos> - So - I'd sleep in here with you?
-Thats a lot of women.<eos> - I told you before, if you want out-<eos> I don't want out, I'm just not jumping at the opportunity for whips, torture and your red room of pain.<eos> The red room is much more about pleasure. I promise you.<eos> Will we still go out to dinner, and movies...<eos> Thats not really my thing.<eos> Try to keep an open mind.<eos> If you agree to be my submissive, I will be devoted to you.<eos> This is what I want.<eos> And I want it with you.
I felt the same at first.<eos> Well... What made you change your mind?<eos> By giving up control, I felt free, from responsibilities.<eos> From making decisions. I felt safe.<eos> You will too, you'll see.<eos> I never took anyone in the helicopter.<eos> Never had sex in my own bed.<eos> Never slept with anyone.<eos> Ever.<eos> Only you.
I've gotta go back to work.<eos> Do you want to watch the footy after?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Lily, you in there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You need anything washed for the morning?<eos> Just these, thanks.<eos> Where'd you go after school?<eos> To the skate park.<eos> Did Tommy go with you?
Yeah.<eos> You need anything washed for the morning?<eos> Just these, thanks.<eos> Where'd you go after school?<eos> To the skate park.<eos> Did Tommy go with you?<eos> Can't keep calling him Tommy anymore.<eos> Did he?<eos> - What?<eos> - Go with you.
Do you hear me?<eos> Burtie, who you let paint this bloody house!<eos> Burtie!<eos> - Burtie?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Rae told you this?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Rae knew?<eos> Mr Parker.<eos> Is she in there with you?
That sucks because, I mean, he would have been the cornerstone of the whole frigging...<eos> Look, he wrote one surprising album. He had a lot of potential. And it sucks that he died so young.<eos> Yeah, but hon, how many stacks of dissertations have been written about, you know, I mean, hell.<eos> You got Cobain, you know, Buckley,<eos> Arbus, Elliott Smith, Nick Drake, David Foster Wallace.<eos> On and on, you know?<eos> You know, Hunter Miles...<eos> Uncharted territory.<eos> Tenure in the bag, man. Lost my mind in...<eos> No, no, no, this does not make or break you.
-That's what I smell like.<eos> -Yeah, ok. He's not shy.<eos> Ok. We'll take you in here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> In we go.<eos> Bed time. Bed time.<eos> -Hello again. -Hi.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, it's, nice to be in business with you.
Thank you.<eos> It is an honor to sit in front of you.<eos> So much.<eos> Okay, please.<eos> I'd like you to have the seat.<eos> Mike, can I say something to you?<eos> Can you not say your whole name today, sorry, um... when we meet the Benjaminson Group?<eos> Why?<eos> Because, um...<eos> I'm just going to be honest with you.
Hey, Dan.<eos> Hey, Chuck.<eos> I've got to go talk to Benjaminson.<eos> But I will catch you later.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Yeah.<eos> "DAN".<eos> Bill, hey. Dan Trunkman.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm just a little thrown.<eos> I saw Chuck Portnoy from Dynamic Progressive Systems... and she mentioned... that she's gonna see you, Bill, also.
Bess.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm in the waiting room.<eos> Is she okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> Can you talk to her, please?<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Hey, Bess.<eos> Hey, I'm in Germany, where I am for work still, a little longer.<eos> I gotta go to this meeting in just a second... but, honey, I want you to know that I'd like to be with you now.
You do not want your down day to own you.<eos> Stay fresh.<eos> Check in with the family.<eos> So, I'm gonna go for a run.<eos> Finish my daughter's little fucking homework assignment... which is driving me crazy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> "No curtains", that's what they said to me.<eos> So, I'm being no curtains with you.<eos> Your daddy is...<eos> Your daddy, honey, is a man who is concerned about you now... in addition to your brother.
Because you have to be teal tough.<eos> Give me a break, Dad.<eos> Come on!<eos> We could probably start a gang, me and you.<eos> Just for real men, though.<eos> Yeah, I guess we could.<eos> Like "The Teal Boys."<eos> How many kids are in your class?<eos> 42.<eos> And how many of those kids pick on you?
You definitely seemed to be liking the idea, so I set it in motion.<eos> It's gonna be great.<eos> Hold, please.<eos> You're hiring senior citizen interns?<eos> There's been a ton of research on this, and the results are actually incredible.<eos> I mean, imagine having an intern with a lifetime of experience, as opposed to somebody who spent the last four years of their life playing beer pong.<eos> - Do they eventually want jobs here?<eos> - No, darling, they're all retired.<eos> They just want the experience.<eos> And I would like one to work directly with you.
Do you want to come?<eos> - Maybe we can stay the weekend?<eos> - That sounds awesome.<eos> Thursday I can't.<eos> Paige is snack leader at school, and I'm supposed to be in the class with her. It's kind of a big deal.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Yeah, it's a really big deal.<eos> No, I know, sweetie.<eos> I'm sorry. I forgot.<eos> - Maybe Ben could go with you.
Jesus.<eos> I could have one bitch of a day.<eos> I can see that.<eos> You want?<eos> God, yeah.<eos> I had beer too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For liabation.<eos> Chin-chin.<eos> So what's wrong with you?
Plus added.<eos> You can hear that it has been for some hours during the year.<eos> Still, I am not afraid to say - - That you are the best I have seen.<eos> You're better than your brother.<eos> You are 100% the best football player.<eos> I thought that it was right to take you out - - Because you were tired, and it was best for the team.<eos> I can not promise that you will always is the first on the team sheet.<eos> But if you are not, then ensure I help you get to know why.<eos> I want you to play the semifinal exactly as you feel.<eos> Today you must keep completely free.
- You can not be the same as Brian.<eos> - No.<eos> You are not as fast as Sivebak.<eos> You do not have the same view, as Christofte has.<eos> But you're my engineer.<eos> You are the one that gets the others to act.<eos> You run and run like no other.<eos> You run and you never give up.<eos> If I want another player I would have taken another.<eos> If the ball comes to you, and it is true - - So I demand you to give it a kick in the ass.
He's looked over here twice already. He hasn't!<eos> - He's walking over here now.<eos> - He's not!<eos> Why would I keep lying to you about what George Sheridan's doing?<eos> Would you like to dance?<eos> Is that really everything you own?<eos> Oh, Eilis. I should have looked after you better.<eos> You've bought most of the clothes in this case.<eos> That's one of the reasons I'm going, cos I can't buy my own.<eos> If it was just that, I'd spend every penny I had on you. Gladly.
- Yeah?<eos> That's on my way home.<eos> Can I walk you?<eos> I'm going to say yes and then I'm going to tell you why.<eos> So I don't get the wrong idea?<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?<eos> - You don't know her?<eos> She lives in my boarding house and she's awful.<eos> If I leave with you, I'm sure she'd understand.
- What does that mean?<eos> - Oh, you know.<eos> No.<eos> Hands.<eos> Too many of them?<eos> I guess it could seem that way if you was a girl.<eos> Listen...<eos> I want everything out in the open.<eos> I came to the Irish dance... because I really like Irish girls.<eos> And I was the only one who would dance with you?
I want to be a book-keeper.<eos> I like working in the shop well enough, but I don't want to be there forever.<eos> I'm sorry, Eilis.<eos> I'm an idiot.<eos> I'm a rude idiot.<eos> So has Tony offered to take you to Ebbets Field when the season starts?<eos> You like baseball?<eos> He never mentioned the Dodgers?<eos> Not even once?<eos> Tony, what's the matter with you?
Anyway, you'll have to go to Ebbets Field if you wanna see him in the summer.<eos> They're that important to you?<eos> Put it this way, if our kids end up supporting the Yankees or the Giants,<eos> - it'd break my heart.<eos> - Mine too.<eos> She's not laughing, Tony.<eos> Think it's too late.<eos> She's a Yanks fan.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't think you were coming. Yeah, I know.<eos> I thought you were gonna think that.<eos> That's why I wanted to be here no matter what.<eos> - I need to say something to you. - Can you...<eos> Can we just talk about something else until we get to Mrs Kehoe's?<eos> - It's not...<eos> - Please.<eos> So...<eos> Ten minutes before I'm supposed to meet you and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.
- Off you go.<eos> Enjoy yourself.<eos> Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.<eos> It's a great pleasure to meet you.<eos> We could try the Connaught Hotel bar.<eos> There may be a few of the fellas from the rugby club there.<eos> OK.<eos> Do you have to be with other fellas from the rugby club all the time?<eos> No.<eos> But Nancy told us we wouldn't be allowed to talk to you cos you have too much to say to each other, so we're just looking for company.
That isn't a ledger, is it?<eos> You didn't take a look for yourself?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> But the file was encrypted.<eos> And why would I lie to you?<eos> So that I would lie to Hunt.<eos> But he wouldn't have stolen it if he knew what it was.<eos> And you wouldn't have helped him.<eos> What is actually on that disk?<eos> I'll be honest with you when you start being honest with me.
- I shoot.<eos> - What?<eos> I think we should shoot.<eos> To be honest, yes we offended you.<eos> Do not play with him, Nicky.<eos> Was already in jail.<eos> In the damn jail.<eos> Do you have any idea what was about to do to her?<eos> Shut up, asshole.<eos> Never going to want to be with you after that.
- Return to seven.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I think your hair was wrong.<eos> Suffice of formalisms.<eos> - Hey, nice jacket.<eos> - Fuck!<eos> Is authentic.<eos> Gordon!<eos> Gordon!<eos> Back to you, friend.
Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> She was here.<eos> I know.<eos> But she's out drinking now, because you said or did... something that sent her up the fucking wall.<eos> I opened the door and she ran off.<eos> That's it.<eos> You fucked it up, Jack.<eos> I don't even know what I did.<eos> She just wanted to meet you.
Yeah.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> No, she's nice... and you'll have fun.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Don't look at him.<eos> What?<eos> You can see him?<eos> Yeah, why wouldn't I see him?<eos> He's solid.<eos> Just ignore his existence, even if he speaks to you.
I don't know, man, please?<eos> I'm sorry. Please don't kill me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Never hold me on the phone.<eos> What's wrong with your fucking head?<eos> This isn't a fucking game.<eos> I'm not playing.<eos> Who did you drop Andrea Huntsman off to yesterday?<eos> Stop fucking interrupting me, you fucking fuck!<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
Right, of course you do.<eos> Is that a finger?<eos> Let me in, Gary.<eos> Not tonight, Jack.<eos> Fuck off somewhere else.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Not happening, Jack.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, where do you think you're going?<eos> Hey, buddy, where you going?<eos> Hey, asshole, I'm talking to you!
You weren't even around for Egypt.<eos> Or Walachilla!<eos> I impaled thousands of people in Walachilla just see them die.<eos> Look at me. Look at me!<eos> Fuck you! I hate you!<eos> I hate this fucking place, all of it!<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> You can't see him?<eos> Now I have your attention?<eos> What the hell's the matter with you?
And look at us.<eos> We're sitting ducks here.<eos> So, let's try and make it a little bit harder for the bastard, shall we? Have you got any tools on this train?<eos> - What's wrong with you?<eos> - Dodgy kebab gave me the shits.<eos> - It's not easy, is it?<eos> - Here. Here, I'll help you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Listen.<eos> I'm sorry about being such a cow to you before.
Not a damn thing.<eos> But never say never.<eos> It's nice.<eos> What is?<eos> You and Romanoff.<eos> No, we haven't... That wasn't...<eos> It's okay.<eos> Nobody's breaking any bylaws.<eos> It's just she's not the most open person in the world.<eos> But with you she seems very relaxed.
I had this, um, dream.<eos> The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake...<eos> What did you dream?<eos> That I was an Avenger.<eos> That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.<eos> I think you're being hard on yourself.<eos> Here I was hoping that was your job.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm running with it.<eos> With you.
You can't save them all.<eos> You'll never...<eos> "Never" what?<eos> You didn't finish!<eos> What, were you napping?<eos> Thor.<eos> You're bothering me.<eos> All right, we're all clear here.<eos> We are not clear! We are very not clear!<eos> All right, coming to you.
It's entirely physical, and it's completely changeable.<eos> Kind of sound like a pamphlet there, Eden.<eos> You can actually expel those emotions from your body and live the life you want to live.<eos> So you're shitting out your pain?<eos> I can see you're not interested.<eos> I'm sorry, Eden.<eos> It just sounds fucking crazy.<eos> Eden, what the fuck?<eos> Until you stop making a joke out of everything, you'll never learn a thing.<eos> That's why nobody cares what you think.
Miguel, Kira, Gina.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I'm glad you're here, but frankly where the hell is choi?<eos> Choi?<eos> Is my asshole boyfriend.<eos> Said he was gonna be early for once.<eos> He didn't call you guys, say he was gonna be late? No.<eos> Come on.<eos> I thought he was gonna come with you.
Believe, and give yourself over.<eos> Will, let's go.<eos> Everybody's waiting.<eos> Iloveyou.<eos> I love you so much, my heart is breaking.<eos> I'mwaitingforyou .<eos> Okay.<eos> Kira.<eos> Look at these people.<eos> They're so happy to be here with you.
- I swear to God! What is in the bag!<eos> - I just carry the bag!<eos> Good work, Cam.<eos> What... what's going on?<eos> You pulled some serious moves out there, pal.<eos> - Dude, we heard about the bus.<eos> That was sick!<eos> - And you, sir, you were hauling ass!<eos> Hey, it's all right, buddy.<eos> We just had to make sure you had our backs. You're family now.
Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Hey, Cam.<eos> If you need anything at all, call me. All right? - All right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Coming back in?<eos> No, I'm tired.<eos> I'm... gonna hit it.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Wanted to talk to you.
And he always finds out.<eos> No.<eos> I'm all good.<eos> Good.<eos> I got the last one.<eos> Unit 17 code...<eos> All clear, good job.<eos> That's how we do it!<eos> - Wait.<eos> - I'll catch up with you later?
- Why can't Dylan go in...<eos> - Dylan's watching our exit.<eos> How are we getting in?<eos> Through the skylight?<eos> Copy that.<eos> - What's inside there?<eos> - New plateau, my friend.<eos> It's not loaded.<eos> You want me to go in unarmed?<eos> I'm going in with you.
- I'm sorry. It was stupid.<eos> Everything's just screwed-up.<eos> I'm not thinking straight.<eos> There's something wrong with me.<eos> Well, where are you staying?<eos> The Fregoli.<eos> La-di-da, you're doing well.<eos> You know. It's boring.<eos> Everything's boring.<eos> Okay, I could meet you there.
It's hard to explain.<eos> I've been running for a long time now.<eos> Running?<eos> We were special together.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I agree.<eos> But things kind of shifted.<eos> But just like completely suddenly?<eos> I was so pissed at you.
I feel odd asking in front of you, Emily. But I didn't know how else...<eos> No, no. That's okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> You sure you don't mean Emily?<eos> Everyone always likes Emily better.<eos> This is awkward.<eos> I'm going to the room, Lisa.<eos> I'll see you later maybe.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Em, I came here with you. I'm not going to just abandon you.
I'll just have a glass of wine, please.<eos> I'm glad to get you alone for a while.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You don't like Emily?<eos> Everybody likes Emily.<eos> Emily's a prince... ess.<eos> - Emily's a princess.<eos> - She's very nice.<eos> I just felt... a sort of special thing with you.
I'm a bad mother.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're superwoman as far as I'm concerned.<eos> You keep the farm going, you raise four kids, get them to school every day and you don't drink a gallon of bourbon to do it.<eos> No, that cop was right.<eos> If things weren't bad at home, Ben wouldn't be in so much trouble.<eos> Fundamentally he's a good boy.<eos> Sometimes I think it'd be better if I disappeared.<eos> Oh, yeah? And what about the kids?<eos> They could go with you.

And what about the kids?<eos> They could go with you.<eos> They'd be better off in Kansas City.<eos> Father's a nut job and I'm a failure.<eos> That's runner's new car.<eos> Do you want me to come in with you?
There's nothing left to say.<eos> You lied. I lied.<eos> We're even.<eos> What about us?<eos> You don't know me, Ben.<eos> You think you do, but you don't.<eos> Just like I don't know you.<eos> Or mom. Or debby, or Michelle.<eos> Whatever silver of a memory I had of them died with them that night.<eos> I'm so angry at you.
It's perfect.<eos> Was this you?<eos> Do you have anything other than photo chemicals in the icebox?<eos> I-I'm feeling...<eos> Sure.<eos> Is there any point in, I don't know, fighting it?<eos> The injunction?<eos> No.<eos> I feel useless, like I can't help you or offer anything.<eos> It has nothing to do with you.
Yes, and then, of course, come to some agreement on the question of compensation.<eos> I'm afraid we are not budging, and that is final.<eos> Can you help me understand the inflexible position that you're taking?<eos> We will not be paying for something we believe is ours, and we will fight you till the end before we concede on this.<eos> Arbitration in Vienna.<eos> - Randy?<eos> - We choose... one of the arbitrators, you choose the other, the third is neutral.<eos> Now you're talking sense.<eos> This sounds like a reasonable idea.<eos> Randy, may I speak with you in private, please?
My wife and I, my-my children, everything I fucking care about in this world, and you have the nerve to...<eos> Everything that I've done, I've done to get those goddamn paintings back for you.<eos> I wish you'd never asked me.<eos> And you-you have the nerve to come here and say to me that it's over?<eos> We're so close, you...<eos> Just hang in there.<eos> The Austrians will never let go.<eos> Never.<eos> But I won't let them humiliate me again.<eos> Go back to Vienna if you have to, but this time, I'm not coming with you.
Oh, shit.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Is it Lito?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> See you in a sec.<eos> Hey.<eos> Why is it when I feel scared, I end up with you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm such a chicken compared to most of the others.<eos> I'm worried for you.
Did you go through my stuff?<eos> No.<eos> I might have reached in there a little bit to kinda feel around blindly, but...<eos> Is that why you're wearing my perfume?<eos> Well...<eos> I didn't spray that.<eos> That wasn't me.<eos> So other people went through my stuff, too.<eos> I'm really sorry, okay.<eos> I just came to switch bags with you.
Okay, is anyone else, like, shitting their pants right now?<eos> Or is it...<eos> Guys, I'm not gonna lie.<eos> I'm completely terrified.<eos> But I'm the one who's on the tape.<eos> So if you guys don't want to come, I understand.<eos> If you're going, I am.<eos> I'm in, too.<eos> I'm with the group.<eos> I've done every boring thing with you since first grade.
We're gonna be so rich, I'm gonna hire Kim Kardashian to have my baby.<eos> "Winner's Parking"!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Put it there.<eos> Put it right there.<eos> This is worth so much money.<eos> I respect you for that.<eos> After taxes, that's $53,876,522.<eos> Want to bet me $100,000 that you're right?<eos> I'll bet you $200,000 I'm exact.
You lookjust like him.<eos> Really?<eos> - Handsome.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> So how did he...<eos> It was a car crash.<eos> He left my party.<eos> Had some kind of urgent call or something.<eos> I don't even really know.<eos> To be honest with you, I don't know the whole story.
This is harder than it looks, huh?<eos> To write something.<eos> What would you do?<eos> "Before the world ends, I want to dance the night away."<eos> That's pretty dumb actually.<eos> Hey, I wrote that one.<eos> I mean, it's okay.<eos> It's not that dumb.<eos> I just...<eos> David, I'm messing with you.
Hey, you don't want to play?<eos> No, I'm kind of tired.<eos> - Really?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> - Taking off?<eos> -Yep.<eos> Okay, cool, cool.<eos> Look...<eos> Hey, can I...<eos> Can I talk to you forjust one second?
What are you doing?<eos> What are you filming?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Are you poking me?<eos> By the way, I told my dad I was sleeping at Jennie's.<eos> Are you taking your towel off?<eos> Should I not take my towel off?<eos> You should.<eos> You absolutely should.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Can you see the stain on here?<eos> 'Cause I got two job interviews today and I really need to look good.<eos> - Interviews?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Sweetie, you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mom, you look beautiful.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> What's up with you?
Somehow.<eos> He thinks it's really, really adorable every time you talk about science and all the projects that you used to do.<eos> It's kind of amazing.<eos> Enough, please.<eos> Chris.<eos> Please have mercy on me.<eos> What's up, Patrick?<eos> Dude, the other night was dope!<eos> Come on.<eos> God, what is up with you, David?
We all called you, David.<eos> - Really?<eos> -The guys are right behind me.<eos> - Really?<eos> -What did you do to the machine?<eos> You know, I'm just making some modifications.<eos> Modifications?<eos> Why?<eos> We did a full systems check yesterday.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?
David!<eos> Shit.<eos> David, when are we?<eos> It's Tuesday.<eos> Adam's still okay.<eos> I can make it so he never ends up in the hospital.<eos> What about everyone else?<eos> What happened to "nobodyjumps alone"?<eos> I know!<eos> I'm sorry for yelling at you.
Nobodyhome.<eos> They found a body in the kitchen.<eos> Now they're suspecting arson.<eos> Stillthere, Whit?<eos> 'Preciate that there, Jim.<eos> There's an open investigation.<eos> William Colby is a person of interest, but there's no solid evidence yet.<eos> Seems like this couple has a history of insurance claims.<eos> They've been on a watch list for the past--<eos> Mind if I join you?
♪ It's true<eos> ♪ Bullies are just such a waste ♪ ♪ Of space<eos> You know, you really should enter the talent contest.<eos> I... I can't sing in front of other people.<eos> Rubbish.<eos> You sing to me all the time.<eos> That's different.<eos> In front of strangers, I go all like jelly.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I'll do it with you.
Yes.<eos> He's happy where he is.<eos> When are you coming home, Molly?<eos> [Line beeps] One second, Gerry.<eos> I have to take this other call.<eos> Hello.<eos> Your limousine is downstairs, Miss Moon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Gerry, I have to go now.<eos> I'll talk to you later.
Adderstone was horrible to you.<eos> I think she's forgotten about that.<eos> She's not been quite herself.<eos> Well, anyway, she's leaving today.<eos> Miss Adderstone.<eos> Molly Moon.<eos> Are you still hypnotized?<eos> I'm just waiting for a taxi.<eos> I think I've been making a bit of a fool of myself,<eos> And I know I haven't been very nice to you.

Don't.<eos> Clarinda, something terrible happened!<eos> Stay away from him!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I thought I fixed this thing.<eos> Nice job, Joy.<eos> Nice job.<eos> Peggy?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What's the matter with you?
I'm fine.<eos> They have a much better time with me anyway, with Aunt Peggy.<eos> But I wasn't stupid enough to get into a bad marriage and have a couple of kids.<eos> Don't bother your sister, Peggy.<eos> I'm gonna talk to Dad about business.<eos> All right?<eos> You gonna come bring the books by the garage later?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna bring them later.<eos> He's in the basement.<eos> I'm joking with you.
That's Joy's special thing, and it belongs in this house.<eos> No, I<eos> Joy.<eos> Joy, wake up!<eos> Someone's been ringing the doorbell.<eos> Jackie!<eos> Oh, thank God!<eos> It's you.<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm worried about you.
All right, you're okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Daddy!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> We got away.<eos> All right, we're going back in!<eos> ...land of opportunity is offering just that to our enemies.<eos> ...the magnitude of destruction our director of defense, the United Nations, and the Centers for Disease Control warning us about?<eos> I don't know the words to tell you how I wish I could be where you are protect you hold you.

Is he responding? Is he responding?<eos> - He's responding. - Okay, okay, okay, okay!<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Responding?<eos> No, "man down ."<eos> Man down is a military term.<eos> It's what you say when one of your boys goes down or someone gets hurt, or...<eos> Let me take a wild guess of who that is.<eos> Is that him right there?<eos> I'm gonna come in with you so they don't mess with you.
What happened to...?<eos> To who?<eos> The world.<eos> How come you weren't affected?<eos> How come you weren't affected?<eos> Oh, please.<eos> How is it the whole world is in shit and you're not affected?<eos> Save your compliments for someone who'd want to hear them.<eos> - This whole world's fucked. - You're alone?<eos> You got survivors with you?
- Okay, Natty.<eos> And what. What does Devin get to do?<eos> Why does he get to stay back, 'cause he broke his arm? I mean, he gets to stay back for what?<eos> Because we need a presence here as well. Why?<eos> Who the fuck's attacking America?<eos> You're gonna be okay, Nat.<eos> Really?<eos> Afghanistan, Gabe?<eos> You think that I want to do this, that this is something I want to do, like I can't wait to go to war?<eos> You know, I'd love to stay here and just be here with you, Natty, but I can't do that. That's not an option for me.
Go back in side. - But, Mommy, he's here.<eos> I'll come get you in a second.<eos> Why do they give a shit about me?<eos> They don't give a shit about me, I don't give a shit about them.<eos> Gabe.<eos> We can make this work.<eos> Come on, please.<eos> Nat!<eos> Where's my kid?<eos> I'm not gonna talk to you if you don't calm down.

I'm calm.
Shots fired!<eos> Go back in!<eos> Okay. You're okay.<eos> Come on, we'll go over here.<eos> I'm going to go. Stay right there. - You okay, buddy?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Whatever happens, you'll be fine, you understand?<eos> Dev, come in, Dev.<eos> The fucking thing, man.<eos> What's wrong with you?
- Mommy.<eos> Mmm-hmm? - Did I die?<eos> - What?<eos> When I was a baby?<eos> No.<eos> Who did you hear that from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, there was a cord in Mommy's tummy and it got wrapped around your neck, and the doctors got scared because it made it hard for you to breathe.<eos> So, they went in there real quick and they got you out.<eos> And there's nothing wrong with you.
- Yeah.<eos> I mean, he writes most of his own stuff, doesn't he?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I believe he does.<eos> Roger, why are you talking like this?<eos> Why are you banging on about your vision for the department?<eos> - I don't know, man.<eos> - Have they offered you David's job?<eos> Derek told me not to say anything.<eos> Trellick doesn't even know yet.<eos> It's no reflection on you, Steven.
It was actually...<eos> It was Rio by Duran Duran.<eos> That's between you and me.<eos> It was Blue Monday.<eos> - New Order. 12 inch vinyl.<eos> - There it is.<eos> Please leave a message after the tone.<eos> Steve?<eos> Steve, you there, man?<eos> Mate, I need to talk to you about the Songbirds.
Get Finn's bag.<eos> I'm sorry, Claire.<eos> Iggy!<eos> Iggy!<eos> Stay here, Claire.<eos> Iggs.<eos> Iggs.<eos> Iggy.<eos> Jesus, Iggs.<eos> What did they do to you?
Kill 'em!<eos> Kill 'em all!<eos> Jack!<eos> Jack!<eos> We showed them, didn't we, George?<eos> Jack, stay with me!<eos> You can't die.<eos> I still gotta whup you good.<eos> I can't carry you forever, Johnny.<eos> It's up to you now.
Temper?<eos> When she got her dander up, look out.<eos> We was in a saloon once.<eos> This fellow sitting next to her starts talking about the perfect way to make a cherry pie...<eos> So your mom says to me, "Frank, come here a minute.<eos> Tell me again, just where did you get them flowers?"<eos> I said, "I know that you think I stole them from the graveyard."<eos> Good morning, boys.<eos> Morning, Never Wears Bra.<eos> I had dream about you last night, White Knife.
Oh, the General?<eos> To me, she is royalty.<eos> Well, she certainly is that. We got company.<eos> You have to hide.<eos> You have to leave.<eos> Go. Come on, BB-8, hurry!<eos> Blast that X-wing!<eos> Over there!<eos> You take this.<eos> It's safer with you than it is with me.
Over there!<eos> You take this.<eos> It's safer with you than it is with me.<eos> You get as far away from here as you can.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I'll come back for you.<eos> It will be all right. Keep moving!<eos> Stay here.<eos> Look how old you've become.<eos> Something far worse has happened to you.
I had no idea we had... the best pilot in the Resistance on board.<eos> Comfortable?<eos> Not really.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> No one has been able to get out of you... what you did with the map.<eos> You might want to rethink your technique. Where is it?<eos> The Resistance... will not be intimidated by you.<eos> Where... is it? It's in a droid. A BB unit.<eos> Well, then, if it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it.<eos> I leave that to you.
- No, no, no.<eos> Keep it.<eos> It suits you.<eos> You're a good man, Finn.<eos> Poe, I need your help.<eos> PZ-4CO, report to communications.<eos> General Organa...<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt.<eos> This is Finn.<eos> - He needs to talk to you.
No! No!<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> It is over.<eos> Thereisnothinglefttodo .<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Perhaps he simply didn't care for the girl.<eos> Are you listening to me?<eos> His master's daughter was presented to him as a whore, and he did nothing.<eos> Hecaresfornothing.<eos> Nothonor,nothis family, nothimself, and certainly not you.
If you use that stuff, you'll spill from the saddle.<eos> I'm tryin' to prevent that accident.<eos> I ain't had any.<eos> I apologize for goin' in your wife's things.<eos> Will you yield it?<eos> Mr. O'Dwyer rides vanguard.<eos> Mr. Kory.<eos> Call me Chicory.<eos> Chicory.<eos> I'm sorry for hollerin' at you.
- Ah, gave up drinking.<eos> Oh, good for you.<eos> Along with, uh, sniffing, snorting, injecting, licking yellow frogs, and women.<eos> Three years without a word.<eos> Nothing.<eos> You bastard.<eos> - Celia's gonna be delighted.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> She missed you, you know?<eos> Really worried about you.
Carrots!<eos> Carrots!<eos> Carrots!<eos> - Twenty seconds, chef.<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> You don't give me a plate?<eos> !<eos> Why are you fucking with me?<eos> You're handing me a plate with nothing on it?<eos> What the fuck's wrong with you?
Regardless of time.<eos> Eat it.<eos> Yes, chef.<eos> Now spit it out before you die of "who gives a fuck" scallop.<eos> I kinda made a mistake with you.<eos> I didn't know you were deaf.<eos> I'm not deaf.<eos> Then how come I left you at the saucier, then I find you at the poisson?<eos> - Adam...<eos> - I'm not talking to you!
Any special reason?<eos> No special reason at all.<eos> Right, Mavey?<eos> - What's his deal?<eos> - He's silly.<eos> It's just a beautiful night, and...<eos> Well, if you don't want to...<eos> No, no!<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I would eat a bucket of garlic to fly with you.
Where's my vampson?<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Still has to make a dramatic entrance.<eos> Dad!<eos> Look at you!<eos> So you run a hotel now?<eos> From Prince of Darkness to King of Room Service.<eos> Yes.<eos> So good to see you.<eos> I'll be right with you.
You don't do that anymore?<eos> What the fuck do you want me to do?<eos> I just want you to keep your ear to the ground, find out who's using scars, who's offering jobs in Congo, who's asking questions about me.<eos> I gotta find out why after all this time.<eos> I talked to Cox.<eos> He hadn't heard anything.<eos> I wanna go to Barcelona and get to Felix. Maybe he knows.<eos> Now, get me set up. I just need 24 to 48 hours, then I'll bump.<eos> I need you to set me up with a kit.<eos> You get compromised, and I fucking go down with you, and I'm just beginning to enjoy my pathetic little life here.
Why?<eos> Didn't we do them enough harm?<eos> I was drilling wells.<eos> I was working for an NGO.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, really.<eos> Not all of us wanna turn our sin into profit.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, let me tell you, I don't believe a word you're saying.<eos> I believe you're here because you think Annie will leave me to be with you.
Oh, God. Okay, okay, this is what I'll do for you, soldier boy.<eos> I'll go to some of my stateside sources, and I'll find out what I can.<eos> And whatever I find, I will give to you, okay?<eos> We're gonna start over again here, Jim.<eos> Yeah, civilly.<eos> Join Annie and I for dinner tonight.<eos> Murgola Restaurant?<eos> 10:00 p.m.<eos> I'm sure she'd love to see you.<eos> I came here to talk to you.
Hell. Hell don't forget us.<eos> It's in our hands.<eos> Okay, okay, we'll do all that later.<eos> - It's on our hands, James.<eos> - Stop, Felix!<eos> We've gotta go!<eos> You're never gonna be happy, Jim.<eos> - Stay down.<eos> - And I am sorry to tell you now.<eos> This hell we created is gonna be with you always!
You were quite a marksman back in the day.<eos> It seems you haven't lost your touch.<eos> They're trapped in the bathroom.<eos> Copy that.<eos> I'm heading to the roof.<eos> I know every room in this house.<eos> You have one skylight, this door.<eos> You've got nowhere to go.<eos> And I know you're not alone.<eos> His wife is with you, Annie.
Then we've got nothing left to talk about.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Just fucking get him!<eos> Jim Terrier. I was expecting your call.<eos> Have a word with your friend, Stanley.<eos> Come on, mate.<eos> Spit it out.<eos> We've been going at him for a while here, Jim.<eos> Man hasn't said a word, not a thing.<eos> That's loyalty for you.
Yeah.<eos> Suicide... successful suicide... is permanent.<eos> Suicide is not temporary.<eos> You will not come back to see your father, your mother, your brothers, your sisters, your relatives, your friends... no one.<eos> It's a tragedy for the whole school, for the whole community because this is a... um, just a wonderful young lady who, uh, had a bright future, uh, ahead of her.<eos> She was pretty much a loner, except for Brian.<eos> In a school of this size, you could have multiple friends, right?<eos> Brian?<eos> Hi, Brian.<eos> I wanted to talk to you a little bit about Jessica.
Hey, sorry I didn't wait for you.<eos> I just...<eos> - Is everything OK?<eos> - I just want to go home.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Jess.<eos> What happened today?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Did she come up to you today?
Nothing.<eos> Did she come up to you today?<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Jess, are you sure you're OK?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Hi, ladies. How are you?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Good to see you again.<eos> Avery, can I talk to you for just a second?
So you ready to get started?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - OK.<eos> Set up a monitor here, if you guys want to take a seat.<eos> No, um, they're not gonna stay.<eos> What do you guys have going on here?<eos> Well, we're... we're sitting down to...<eos> We're just watching something, so you guys can just go.<eos> Well, I am not gonna let you just sit there by yourself.<eos> I have to watch it, too, with you.
Well, we're... we're sitting down to...<eos> We're just watching something, so you guys can just go.<eos> Well, I am not gonna let you just sit there by yourself.<eos> I have to watch it, too, with you.<eos> I mean, I'm curious what's going on here.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I can do this by my... this is my thing right now with Amy, so...<eos> But I am your mother, and you are going to sit with me and allow me to be your support system.<eos> I'm not gonna sit with you.
- Uhh! I'm fine!<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> Yes, she does!<eos> We'll be in the next room, right?<eos> If you want to go to the next room, you go right ahead; I'm gonna stay with her.<eos> I'm not leaving her in this time of need!<eos> Listen, you're going with me in the other room to leave these two alone!<eos> This has been going on long enough!<eos> This is about Avery.<eos> This is not about you.
They don't pay enough.<eos> The English will be quiet for a while.<eos> I want to get on with our lives.<eos> We can finally extend the vegetable garden.<eos> Great... As much as you like.<eos> I'm glad I ordered an extra cask of beer.<eos> All those lost years.<eos> You were on your own because I was away.<eos> Was it a boy or a girl? A girl.<eos> I'm staying with you now.
Don't spoil it.<eos> I'm only doing this for you, anyway.<eos> Come and join me.<eos> Affairs of state, my little Salsisu.<eos> I'll be with you very soon.<eos> Majesty.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Don't you like girls?<eos> You have locked us before the French?<eos> No, I wanted to discuss with you first.
It doesn't com pare to What he'll get when I get my hands on him.<eos> You look hellish.<eos> You found yourself a woman yet? Nah.<eos> That's a fucking empty existence you've got there, is it no'?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Minute late, Porter.<eos> Not impressed.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Henderson, I was, eh... I was coming along the green there and I was threatened by a bunch of, um... wasps.<eos> Get that shite off.<eos> Did, uh... Wullie have a chat with you the other day'?
"Edinburgh."<eos> You've already tried, and failed, to raise capital in London, Edinburgh, Milan.<eos> And now you're here.<eos> Isn't it beautiful?<eos> It's been working perfectly for an hour.<eos> We've done it.<eos> We've done it, Lucille.<eos> I can't wait for Edith to see it.<eos> Edith?<eos> I did this with you.
Snapped it in two under his boot.<eos> She never quite healed.<eos> She was bedridden for a long time.<eos> But I cared for her.<eos> Fed her.<eos> Bathed her.<eos> Combed her hair.<eos> Rubbed liniment on her scars.<eos> I made her better.<eos> I'll do the same with you.
Hi. Thank you so much for celebrating our engagement with us.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Everyone, just "shh."<eos> Shh! You need to "shh." Senator.<eos> Shh! Shh.<eos> Yellow tie.<eos> I see you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> James, I love you and I can't wait to be married to you.
You go back over there with the negros!<eos> That's where you belong.<eos> - I don't see anyone.<eos> - You belong with the Negros.<eos> - Go.<eos> - I'm going.<eos> Fuck you calling a negro? ! He was.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> I told you, Carlos! Keep that shit over there on your side!<eos> - Take the Yankee with you!
God!<eos> You're failing.<eos> I've got a state-of-the-art gym 40 feet away.<eos> Ain't no gyms in San Quentin.<eos> Curl me, bitch!<eos> Curl me!<eos> Maybe I should start with a baby at higher reps.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, you!<eos> - I wanna fight you.

What are you in the mood for?<eos> Some Penn State?<eos> Some Pepperdine?<eos> Pomona?<eos> Princeton?<eos> I'm not getting into Princeton.<eos> He's not getting into Princeton.<eos> Um, so, is that it?<eos> No, honey, it's not it.<eos> Your father and I want to talk to you about something kind of sad.
It sucks quite a bit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dad, Cat Stevens is clawing me.<eos> Well, he's deeply distraught.<eos> Well, you know, I was talking to Denise and Denise feels that you might be someone who could make Rachel feel better.<eos> Yeah, but like I said, we're not really friends, so...<eos> Just give Rachel a call.<eos> Yeah, well, what do you want me to say?<eos> "Hey, it's Greg, the guy who's<eos> "never really paid attention to you...
And you're so, so, handsome.<eos> Oh, I'm not handsome, but thank you.<eos> And so modest.<eos> I guess I'm a modest mouse.<eos> Greg, where do you come up with this stuff?<eos> Well, that's the name of a band, actually.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Rachel!<eos> I've got a modest little mouse here to see you!
Can we take a little break and have a little taste?<eos> You boys are old enough to have a little taste, right?<eos> Can we take a teeny break, just have a little taste?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's a good boy.<eos> Greg, will you join us?<eos> Oh, I'm okay.<eos> Oh, come on, don't be a party pooper!<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Now we can get back to our interview.<eos> So, basically, this whole setup is so that, you know I can talk to you, you can talk to me and I can see you, and you can see me.
Oh, my God, can you just...<eos> Ooh, Greg, this pillow's name is Francesca.<eos> Don't joke, I can't deal with that.<eos> She's a filthy Italian woman.<eos> Please, stop!<eos> Don't yell at me.<eos> So, that's it?<eos> Just, to hell with college, to hell with growing up?<eos> Greg, don't.<eos> Rachel, what the hell is wrong with you?
Just waiting for Earl.<eos> Awright, awright.<eos> Whassup, boy?<eos> You gonna come in?<eos> So, Rachel told me that you told her about the, uh about the film that we're making for her.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You're like Julian Assange, man.<eos> It's like you always do this...<eos> I don't know, 'cause you, like, wanna be a better friend than me or something?<eos> I don't know if I can work with you again after you sell me out like a dick!
Oh, okay.<eos> Watch out, yo.<eos> Hey, yo, shut your ass up, man!<eos> Like you care so much about what other people think, boy, you go around here kissin' everybody ass, pretending like they your friend.<eos> Look, nobody gives a shit about you, Greg!<eos> All right?<eos> Nobody give a shit!<eos> Whoop his ass!<eos> And then the one girl who do actually care about you you wanna come over here and bitch and whine about some films, yo? Huh?<eos> Because somebody actually cares about you?
I'm not a good kid.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Okay.<eos> Earl came by earlier to drop something off but he turned down this superb Andouille rabbit sausage which is quite unlike him.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Buddy?<eos> Hey, Rachel.<eos> Uh...<eos> We tried a lot of different ways of making a film for you but they were all too goofy or irrelevant or just not what we wanted.<eos> So, now I'm gonna talk to you directly.
So I guess I could just go.<eos> Or you could go.<eos> No, I like the air-conditioner.<eos> And I like the comfortable chair.<eos> Yeah, I like those too.<eos> Sounds like your damn problem.<eos> ...which showed one film per week twice a night, and three times on Saturday.<eos> In a way, Tales of Hoffmann is the culmination of Powell-Pressburger's work with what they call the composed film.<eos> Hey!<eos> Can I talk to you about the movie?
What?<eos> No.<eos> I...<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, so you guys are gonna be getting busy on my brand new Tuscan leather?<eos> No.<eos> I think- Huh?<eos> No, we're not.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Nah, I'm just playing with you.
Oh yeah? - Miss Patricia? - (GLASSES CLINKS)<eos> Being back doesn't solve that.<eos> Did you know that we were gonna have lunch the day of her funeral? You're finally going to discuss some of the things that have been keeping us apart.<eos> - Elizabeth...<eos> - And there's not a day that I don't think about that, Jake.<eos> She was my only sister and I never got the chance...<eos> - Look, Elizabeth... - I...<eos> We'd like to make a proposal, Jake, and just hear me out.<eos> We'd like Katie stay here tonight, and you get settled.<eos> You'll get you sea legs, so to speak. And then, you know, in a week or whenever you're ready, then have Katie come with you.
- It's completely fair.<eos> Now you're to inform Lucy that Tuesday's session will be your last.<eos> And at the end of the session, Dr. Weinberg will come in and introduce herself.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Will you please put this back on the shelf?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um... Lucy, I've had the best couple of months with you.<eos> It's been such a pleasure to get to know you, and to read, and play and draw pictures.<eos> It's been so fun that I told my friend Carla who works here, she's super nice, how much fun it's been.<eos> And she want's to play with you too.
Potato Chip. Hey.<eos> There seems to be a very grumpy child here.<eos> Trying to take away the grumpiness one layer at a time.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, that's a little bit of grumpiness gone.<eos> I still see some grumpiness.<eos> Gone!<eos> It's all gone.<eos> Here I'm a pretty good doctor.<eos> KATIE: Okay. I'll stay with you, okay?
Or you thought my parents are gonna like you too much didn't you? What? You'd be even deeper than you are now, is that it?<eos> How deeper am I in?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know, Katie. I don't know what we're doing here.<eos> I'll tell you something. I'm tired.<eos> I'm tired of...<eos> What?<eos> I'm just... I'm tired of trying to figure out what this is, what we're doing. What are we doing?<eos> Look, if this is just hanging out and that's all it is, then that's fine, because you know what, it makes me happy.<eos> Will you please look at me when I'm talking to you? Katie!
The name's Kenny.<eos> No crap from you, OK?<eos> Fancy going out tonight?<eos> Or don't you party anymore?<eos> I've got something on.<eos> - What?<eos> - Just something.<eos> A chick?<eos> Lady killer.<eos> Bring her with you.
Do you think I like going from one crap job to another?<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Tell me what you want.<eos> You know what I want.<eos> I just want to be dull.<eos> Come home at 5 p.m., put the potatoes on, watch TV.<eos> Ask my man about his day at work.<eos> Go swimming with my kid once a week.<eos> A dull fucking life.<eos> If not with you, I'll find someone else.
Better than that Moroccan dope, huh, Kenny?<eos> Can we get on with it?<eos> And you, Dave, got a ball and chain yet?<eos> Is there a Miss Dave?<eos> Or Mr. Dave?<eos> It's allowed, you know.<eos> You have to watch out for them, Dave.<eos> I mean it.<eos> First, they do anything to trap you.<eos> And once they've got you, they break you.
Did you really think you could hide something like that?<eos> You have to tell your brother a thing like that.<eos> It's not possible to talk to you.<eos> I've been trying my whole life.<eos> Did you listen, even once?<eos> Do you know how it feels, to be humiliated by a woman?<eos> No... you don't.<eos> She had to do it.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> There's just no other way with you.
If you'd be into that.<eos> Sure, Dan.<eos> All right.<eos> Let me try and explain this to you.<eos> I feel like you're not getting it.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> - I know.<eos> It's like I'm here with you right now, right?
- How are you?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - Good.<eos> I'm John.<eos> - Theresa.<eos> Thanks, John.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> So that was totally not what I thought it was gonna be.<eos> But now I can just, you know,<eos> I can just let it go, and I can be here with you.
I don't know.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> What? This fucking suit, man!<eos> - It's fucking terrible!<eos> - Really?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> But it's beautiful.<eos> It is beautifully terrible.<eos> It says, "I couldn't bother being conforming to you, you conforming automatons."
See once you find your necessity, it's all gravy from there on out.<eos> Carla, where are you right now?<eos> Why is your phone off, first of all?<eos> Second of all, I'm so high right now.<eos> I'm still at the wedding, and my family is insane.<eos> I just got high with my mom's boyfriend.<eos> You know what he told me?<eos> He told me that sex with my mom is still fantastic.<eos> So I've got that image in my head for the rest of my life.<eos> I so wanna talk to you right now.

What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You too.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> What'd she say?<eos> I don't wanna talk about it.<eos> Why are you being so nice to me?<eos> What do you mean, why am I being so nice to you?<eos> I care about you, that's why.
Like you want me to really say it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I wanna kiss you right now, okay?<eos> That's the truth.<eos> And I feel like that's all I ever do is like I have to pretend that I don't wanna kiss you every time I'm with you.<eos> And I get to like hang out with you and Emmy and have dinner and come party here, and it's just...<eos> I'm just tired of it.<eos> I like you, you know?<eos> And I like being around you.<eos> I'm just waiting, you know, for them to leave so I can be alone again, and I never feel that with you.
There's my Solnychamoya.<eos> Let me look at you, first day at the Academy, and the youngest cadet ever admitted!<eos> I'm so nervous!<eos> Oh! This is my roommate, Cadet Madison.<eos> It's an honor, Admiral<eos> I still can't believe he's your grandfather.<eos> Great-great-grandfather!<eos> I've heard so many things about you Sir!<eos> Don't believe a word about it!<eos> I'm worried about you, Poppy.
Eli?<eos> I'm not going.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not going.<eos> You're not going?<eos> I can't leave Eva.<eos> Nell, would she leave you?<eos> No, she wouldn't.<eos> She's not here, is she?<eos> She wouldn't come with you.
Look at you.<eos> Every fucking year, Lou?<eos> Hey, enough with this dad stuff.<eos> Call me Lou.<eos> Why do I have to pretend to be your butler?<eos> You are my butler.<eos> No, Lou, just 'cause my room's near the bar and I'm good at receiving guests and...<eos> Holy fuck, I'm your butler.<eos> Wait.<eos> Hey, Lou, what do you think about, maybe this summer, you know, I come work with you at Lougle?
- Wait, the sticker?<eos> -Yeah, on the neck.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We normally give Tylenol for that.<eos> I just pumped him full of...<eos> Narcotic-seeking nanobots?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> -Whoops.<eos> You're a great listener.<eos> I should have married you.
All right.<eos> Just any hook-ups happen off the campgrounds.<eos> No, Will, seriously.<eos> I don't want any problems this time.<eos> Trust, my ass.<eos> Hey!<eos> Where's Christy?<eos> Michelle...?<eos> I'm sorry I got mad.<eos> I shouldn't have yelled at you, okay?
What does he love to do?<eos> Orchids.<eos> He was an expert in orchids.<eos> What languages did he speak, John?<eos> English, Russian, Mandarín and Tamil.<eos> Why Tamil?<eos> Because your mother was from Sri Lanka.<eos> You know where he is, don't you?<eos> Katia.<eos> YOu told me you wanted to do this, and I told you I would do it with you... but if you want my help, you have to tell me where he is.
I'm not talking about the job<eos> I think you're lying<eos> I don't believe you can just turn off fear or love<eos> I don't believe anyone can.<eos> You're either a person or something else.<eos> Which is it?<eos> Are you asking me, or yourself?<eos> You can't fight who you are, Katia.<eos> You'll lose.<eos> Is that what happened to you?
Oh, fuck it!<eos> It's the Chairman.<eos> What's happening?<eos> What's he doing out of his office?<eos> It's quite enough, John.<eos> You can wait outside, all of you.<eos> It's okay, John.<eos> Petya.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> I am going to be completely honest with you.
No.<eos> No, not people like us.<eos> What you did... When you chose to play God, can never be undone.<eos> You can't run from what you are.<eos> So I should...? Embrace it?<eos> Re-start the Program with you as it's head?<eos> Yes.<eos> You always were a small man, Antoine.<eos> A derivitive thinker, at best.<eos> This desperation suits you.
Welcome back.<eos> When i was born, we had no central heating here.<eos> So the first thing i did when we made a little money, I put central heat and air in this house.<eos> I was tired of sweating.<eos> Dude, look at this. - Did you write that?<eos> - I did.<eos> - I think i got a little crazy. I decided i wanted to do my autograph on everything.<eos> Well, that's crazy, i lived my whole life in this house.<eos> It's been a part of my life for 39 years.<eos> And to actually stay here with you.
Albumafteralbum tour after tour--<eos> Weweredone.<eos> '99 to 2000, this was my haven.<eos> Because i could do whatever i wanted,<eos> 'Cause we pretty much ran orlando.<eos> Everything was comped, comped everywhere we went.<eos> Yeah. I mean, free liquors, free everything.<eos> - We've been best friends now for what, 15 years?<eos> - Yeah, 15. This has got a lot of history for me, good and bad... - yeah.<eos> - With you.
So, turn me in and walk away.<eos> And then, Barrett and Jessup will back me up.<eos> NSA won't care.<eos> They think because of you, now we have Black Widow.<eos> You have to run.<eos> What? You're gonna refuse an order? You escaped.<eos> We reconnect in Jakarta.<eos> Look, your bosses can add two and two.<eos> I'm not turning you in.<eos> Do I go with you or Nick?
I'm not turning you in.<eos> Do I go with you or Nick?<eos> Neither.<eos> - What?<eos> - This doesn't involve you.<eos> Who made that choice?<eos> He's right.<eos> Look, I'm not sure there's any light at the end of this tunnel anymore.<eos> What did you do, Chen Dawai?<eos> Remind him he owes you?
- Come on, man.<eos> NAMCHE BAZAAR: 12,303 ft 3,750 m.<eos> Guys, man want to see your climbing permits.<eos> Need to see all your climbing permits.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> We'll see you on the way back.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - All good?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Yeah, you?
Harold, where are you?<eos> Can you hear me, Harold?<eos> Harold.<eos> Harold, can you hear me?<eos> Figure it'll take me about half an hour to get back up to the South Summit.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> If you don't have oxygen, mate, don't come up, don't come up.<eos> We're moving on.<eos> I'm coming up to you, Rob.
Get me the fuck out of here!<eos> We got to move. We got to get him out of here.<eos> Is everyone okay?<eos> Sully's bleeding fast.<eos> - Okay, put me down.<eos> - You're all right.<eos> Here, here, here.<eos> Shit!<eos> Sully, you got to hang in there, man.<eos> I'm depending on you.
I am Hannah and this is my daughter, Ruth.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I'm Sarah and this is my son, Ira.<eos> Ira?<eos> Ira?<eos> - Good Shabbes.<eos> - Good Shabbes.<eos> Good Shabbes.<eos> Good Sha...<eos> The following days were consumed with plotting ways in which I could talk to you... now that you had found a home in my small community.
The wound got infected.<eos> I ran a high fever for almost two weeks.<eos> You need to see more doctors.<eos> Get a second opinion.<eos> Don't you think I've already done that?<eos> There's nothing they can do.<eos> This is my life, I have to accept it.<eos> But I don't want it to be yours.<eos> But there is still a chance.<eos> I want to marry you.
I understand ...<eos> I'm a monster!<eos> I can not believe it.<eos> I'm a monster!<eos> And I found you.<eos> I'm a hero.<eos> A great day!<eos> Halt not!<eos> I got to be a hero.<eos> I'm going back with you, Agent Skunk.
Halt not!<eos> I got to be a hero.<eos> I'm going back with you, Agent Skunk.<eos> You'll be a hero! I promise.<eos> But first I have to find Lily.<eos> We would have been on SkyArk friends?<eos> Of course, Agent Skunk.<eos> Yes Yes!<eos> As brothers! - Yes!<eos> The mask is you!
Sometimes I think I'm invisible.<eos> Well, I see you.<eos> I wonder what I'm doing here sometimes.<eos> - What do you mean by that?<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> You mean you have thoughts of killing yourself?<eos> I just can't do it.<eos> Hello.<eos> Who are you here to see?<eos> Is your mum or your dad here with you?
What is it?<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Elizabeth, listen to me. Just try and speak, OK?<eos> What is it?<eos> What's over there?<eos> Hey, no...<eos> Elizabeth?<eos> I've got to be honest with you, Pete.
Want something to eat?<eos> Don't wait up.<eos> Hi, Baz.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Fuck, mate. You've had a really shit couple of years.<eos> It's good to see you, though.<eos> Fuckin' life, ey?<eos> I can't even imagine what it is you must be going through.<eos> It's made me think a lot about my past. Addressing it, you know... the things I've done.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about something.
- Your brother?<eos> - And you believed him?<eos> - Why wouldn't I? - He hates you.<eos> - What would you know?<eos> Just trust me.<eos> You coming?<eos> Check that out. Jackpot.<eos> Dinner and a show.<eos> How do you know it's not two blokes in there?<eos> What's wrong with you?
We need to leave.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - Right now. We have to go.<eos> Slow down.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said that we have to give him $20,000 or he's gonna rape us.<eos> - He said he was going to rape us?<eos> - Yeah, the whole family.<eos> At the same time?<eos> What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with those people?<eos> - Monsters.<eos> She's dead, Murphy.<eos> She's dead.<eos> Freeman's dead too. He bled out.<eos> Look at him.<eos> - Look, at him, Murphy!<eos> - Benji!<eos> You need to pull yourself together, okay?<eos> I can't think with you crying like a little bitch.
My parents never did anything to me.<eos> My parents are perfect parents.<eos> They never hit me. They never hurt me...<eos> Sweetie, come here, come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I didn't...<eos> They're very hard on you.
He misses the bullets.<eos> Let him settle in.<eos> Give him time.<eos> How does nine months sound?<eos> I'm having another baby.<eos> And you didn't tell him, did you?<eos> You gotta tell him.<eos> I don't want him to be disappointed with his life.<eos> With me.<eos> He will never be disappointed with you.
You do whatever it is you gotta do.<eos> When you find that sumbitch, just do me one favor.<eos> What's that?<eos> Don't miss.<eos> Thank you so much for letting us stay, Mando.<eos> I hope it's not a problem.<eos> Listen, Dom needed a safe delivered to Rio in two days.<eos> That was a problem.<eos> Hosting his family in the Dominican Republic, that is vacation.<eos> Anyone messes with you here, they mess with the entire country.
This is crazy.<eos> I might have to move out here.<eos> I think I'm gonna start a new culture. It's called Blarab.<eos> You know, like "black Arab."<eos> How are we looking, Tej?<eos> We're almost in position.<eos> Okay, so this is how it works.<eos> We got to move in sync if we're gonna pull this off.<eos> So let's go over it to make sure everyone clearly understands their roles.<eos> Roman, that means you.
Dawn's up in two hours.<eos> We're gonna go take down Shaw then.<eos> Go get changed.<eos> We should go now.<eos> Just you, your team, and me.<eos> I thought you said at dawn.<eos> My guys are racers, the best drivers in the world.<eos> But they ain't killers.<eos> Told you he'd say that.<eos> I know you too well, Dom, and I'm going with you.
It came to me like a flood.<eos> I remember that night in the Dominican Republic.<eos> The night we got married.<eos> Will this do?<eos> We have eternity in this moment.<eos> You will never be alone again.<eos> I vow wherever you go, I go.<eos> You ride, I ride.<eos> You fight, I fight.<eos> And if you ever die on me, Dominic Toretto, I'm gonna die with you.
If you die, I die.<eos> And I'm not ready to leave this place yet.<eos> This moment is still ours.<eos> I remember everything.<eos> I remember it all.<eos> It's about time.<eos> Why didn't you tell me we were married?<eos> Because you can't tell someone they love you.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> You sure you brought enough backup with you, Hobbs?
First of all, it's a tangelo and it's in season.<eos> Secondly...<eos> So far, so pretty, you guys-<eos> What do you say we head back to the kitchen and round up the troops?<eos> You guys stay here and get comfy.<eos> You know, I think a bandit clown with a big ax is pretty creepy.<eos> It's called counterpoint.<eos> Plus the beard adds nuance.<eos> You are so insecure, Anson, it's revolting.<eos> Was anyone talking to you, Mimi?
- Can I ask you something?<eos> - Of course, God.<eos> What exactly are you talking about?<eos> - Fate.<eos> - Oh, fate.<eos> - Brought us together.<eos> - So mysterious.<eos> Because I guess I could put the thing with Bethany on hold... Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> I hate that bitch Mimi and the way she talks down to you.
All right, well, I've got some white panto beans.<eos> No dearth of those around. Whoa, hey!<eos> You hung the stray upside down.<eos> That's kind of neat.<eos> Kind of an homage to the traditional Mexican pinata. Mmm! Mmm!<eos> - Is it not on point, man?<eos> - Holy shit!<eos> And you know, we'd be halfway through prepping the next entree if you weren't in the pantry for a fucking hour.<eos> Why were you in there for so long, man?<eos> Well, I need to cool it down with you and have a little sidebar asap, ASAP, as soon as possible.
- Bart's on his own.<eos> No.<eos> Look.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> You two get out of here, all right?<eos> Call the cops, don't look back.<eos> I got this.<eos> Hector, wait!<eos> Please, please be careful!<eos> I will not go out with you if you're dead or all fucked-up looking!
- But which one?<eos> I nominate me...<eos> and vote for me.<eos> Fuck! Ow! You don't call anymore.<eos> Oh, God, I'm so sorry. Hey! Oh, God, fuck.<eos> Miss Behavin' ran outta air. Cry baby. Ram<eos> You're not funny, you asshole!<eos> I have a long labial It's genetic!<eos> This is what it feels like to die.<eos> Now go to hell, and take your giant pussy with you.
Well, you're... you know!<eos> You're a paramedic!<eos> You, it's your responsibility!<eos> You have to help!<eos> Yeah, I don't start 'til Monday.<eos> It's okay.<eos> That's okay.<eos> It's okay, Stef.<eos> No, no.<eos> I'll be here with you, little brother.
Yeah, I don't start 'til Monday.<eos> It's okay.<eos> That's okay.<eos> It's okay, Stef.<eos> No, no.<eos> I'll be here with you, little brother.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'll...<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm with you, bro.
It's me.<eos> It's me, Marty Clement.<eos> Uh, we went through training together.<eos> Am I gonna die?<eos> 'Cause that would be really ironic.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> I want you to sit tight for me, okay?<eos> You sit tight right here.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> And then I'm gonna be with you for the rest of time.
I can just leave it.<eos> Let's go get into trouble.<eos> This bush always been here?<eos> - Watch it!<eos> - You know there's a gate, right?<eos> It sure is a stylish party.<eos> Yeah, well, this isn't just any college party, this is a cappella angry.<eos> So, get prepared to meet a lot of sexually confused men.<eos> Bellas, welcome, welcome, welcome.<eos> Jesse, where is Beca, I thought she was gonna be with you tonight?
I didn't know what those were, but they're like salty peas.<eos> So...<eos> I don't know if you've seen the news lately, but...<eos> There's a war, and also the economy is dipping' and ebbing', growing'.<eos> Bumper, what's goin' on?<eos> Now you're kinda creeping' me out.<eos> Okay, I guess I'll just lay it all out there.<eos> The reason I brought you here tonight... it's because I was thinkin' that... maybe... perhaps... if you're interested...<eos> This is harder than I thought it was gonna be.<eos> I want to date you, that's what I want.
We're talking about the forthcoming album, some other business matters.<eos> So I think it's... it's gonna be an exciting time.<eos> Ah-ah! Naughty!<eos> Amy, Amy!<eos> She was, like, "Why is he bringing another camera crew to St. Lucia?<eos> "Dad, you want money?<eos> I'll give you money.<eos> "Why are you doing your life story, which is really my life story?"<eos> She just felt like, "My dad's doing a lot of stuff for money or the limelight."<eos> - Want me to go with you?
And it was my Amy, completely normal.<eos> And she kept saying she'd never done this before.<eos> She just kept saying sorry.<eos> It was like complete clarity over the whole situation of the nightmare of the past however many years that we'd just gone through.<eos> "Jules, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry..."<eos> Like when you're a kid and you panic that you've done something wrong and you wanna just fix it there and then, that's how it was.<eos> I just wanted to grab her, bring her back to me, wrap her in my house, not let her out.<eos> And she called me the next day, and it was just so weird hearing her talk normally, because for so long, we'd just been pining for her...<eos> Like, I missed my best friend, Lauren missed her best friend. We just wanted to have a normal conversation.<eos> She just kept going, "Can I see you?
I was being real, but Mamie-Claire then goes and marries him.<eos> They live in Greenwich, Connecticut in some big gross house.<eos> Do you know that place?<eos> Yeah, Greenwich, Grossville.<eos> Living off of his riches and my t-shirt idea.<eos> I hate them!<eos> I actually pity them.<eos> They have no more dreams.<eos> These?<eos> I wanna marry you!
I know.<eos> I'd never met a geologist before.<eos> It's weird that someone who studies rocks can be really into Jesus.<eos> What did your mom do?<eos> She was a special education teacher.<eos> That's so nice.<eos> She was really good at it.<eos> I still don't like retarded jokes.<eos> Do you want to see a picture of her?<eos> She doesn't look like you, but she has your expression, you know?
How do we get there?<eos> I really don't like to leave the city.<eos> You're gonna want to take the Hutch to the Merritt.<eos> I'll bet Dylan is still in love with me.<eos> Marrying Mamie-Claire is like buying a cashmere sweater from Old Navy.<eos> Even if he's not, this is a great investment.<eos> And don't forget, she still owes you.<eos> Yeah, it's win-win.<eos> Because I'm sure he still loves me.<eos> I'm not driving you to Connecticut to break up a marriage.
This is, this is our life.<eos> It's a real life.<eos> I know Brooke doesn't believe that, but you do.<eos> You know what?<eos> I appreciate the offer, Dylan, but I'm not going to take the money.<eos> I just wasn't brought up that way.<eos> What will you do?<eos> I'll figure it out.<eos> I always do.<eos> I am so impressed by you and so worried for you at the same time.
Yes. You.<eos> Unlock it.<eos> You sure you want to do this?<eos> I think we all remember very well what happened last time.<eos> That's why when Sarah says the coast is clear you're going to lock that door.<eos> Oh, I'm going to do that am I?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sarah, you don't have to do everything she tells you.<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> If I even see a hint of a dinosaur I'm going to personally feed you to it.
All right, shut it down.<eos> Wasting our time.<eos> I've been assuming that all Divergents are the same.<eos> But some are much stronger than others.<eos> Assign all non-essential personnel to the Divergent detail.<eos> We need to look harder.<eos> We need to find that very special one.<eos> Where's your scary boyfriend?<eos> Probably off doing scary boyfriend things.<eos> Mind if I join you?
How very Amity of you.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I'm not gonna fight you.<eos> Of course you're not.<eos> You're gonna fight her.<eos> The one you really hate.<eos> What are you?<eos> I'm you, Tris.<eos> I'm the real you.<eos> I'm not gonna fight you.
Unable to hunt starving and scraggy wolves moved closer to populated areas.<eos> They preyed on cattle.<eos> The new settlers retaliated.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> What's that?<eos> What's that smell that makes you so happy?<eos> Slowly!<eos> Slowly!<eos> What's up with you?
Still not going.<eos> You never came back for me.<eos> You came back for them.<eos> Well, go on, make them their dresses.<eos> Make them think they're classy. They'll still hate you.<eos> Tape measure.<eos> Oh, your centre line's off.<eos> Got to start from the beginning again.<eos> Get all these pins out and start again.<eos> What's wrong with you?
You were making me ill.<eos> But Tilly Dunnage has cured me.<eos> You followed Molly here and used her.<eos> Just like you used me.<eos> You've had lots of affairs, haven't you, Evan?<eos> She murdered Stewart.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Your new friend.<eos> You mean Tilly, your daughter, murdered your son?<eos> If it weren't for him, I would never have had to marry you.
Why is the door open? Hello?<eos> Ab, is that you?<eos> - Boss?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Boss, are you alright?<eos> - Yeah, I'm sort of okay.<eos> Tired of this crap.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Have they left you alone or given you a rough time?
- Yeah, what's wrong with him?<eos> - What's right with him?<eos> Here.<eos> - Shit, that's way too much.<eos> - Now come on, you deserve it.<eos> Here, come here.<eos> I want to talk to you.<eos> What's up?<eos> I want you to take this money and I want you to hide it in the next 20 minutes.<eos> - Yeah, but I'll come with you, right?
But anyway, you're safe here, you know.<eos> Really, Jack, don't worry.<eos> I'm sorry, I must assist my wife.<eos> What the hell did you just say to him?<eos> You're a pain.<eos> You want one?<eos> - Look, I'm sorry, okay? - Will you stop saying you're sorry?<eos> You English spend your time apologizing.<eos> Why do you always apologize?<eos> - I don't want to argue with you.
I'll be all right, really.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - It's the least I could do.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> Everything.<eos> Dinner.<eos> Don't be. It's not your fault.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What happened to you, Jack?
I know you will do it again.<eos> You need me. We are your only family.<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Don't leave! I don't want you to leave.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I will do anything for you.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Scissors!<eos> Free, at last!<eos> I couldn't have done this with anyone else. Only you.
- Calais?<eos> - Just drive.<eos> - But where are we going?<eos> Anywhere but here.<eos> Shouldn't we go back to your family?<eos> No.<eos> They'll be worried, no?<eos> No. They never have.<eos> Anyway, I feel safe here.<eos> With you.
I'll try not to.<eos> You cut my hair.<eos> This sword could skin you alive.<eos> But you told me I was safe.<eos> And you were.<eos> Entirely safe.<eos> I gave you my word.<eos> Now I will take this.<eos> Miss Everdene.<eos> Perhaps I could walk with you?
And you're being downright mean to him.<eos> Oh, what are you going to do about it, Shrimpo?<eos> I was gonna ask you to be less mean.<eos> "Less mean"?<eos> Like this?<eos> Yo, check it out, Marble Henry.<eos> He ain't so tough now, is he?<eos> He sure ain't.<eos> That's my beloved pet you're humiliating out there.<eos> I tried talking nice to you but now I got to take matters into my own hands.
My friends, they have money. Please.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> Sorry, but money cannot help you.<eos> And I'm afraid you have so much left to give.<eos> You know, I used to feed my dog pig ears.<eos> But they just don't have the same nutritional value.<eos> Beast.<eos> You're sick.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Listen to him when he speaks to you, cunt!
Jesse, chill out.<eos> Sorry, sir, he can be a bit of a hothead.<eos> I'm sorry I can't be more help.<eos> If you guys ever want a great tattoo, you're welcome back to this shithole any time.<eos> I hope you find them.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We appreciate it.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I just met your friends.<eos> They really do seem concerned about you.
I'll do anything, anything you want.<eos> Oh, I know you will.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They have no interest in me.<eos> I sent them on their way.<eos> Amy...<eos> This tattoo will forever bond you to me.<eos> Every time you look in the mirror, you will see me.<eos> You will see us.<eos> I will be with you wherever you go.
He remembered Amy's name.<eos> Ok, and why is that important?<eos> - Did he remember Brock's?<eos> - Ok, Sherlock.<eos> - What are you getting at?<eos> - Seriously, please. Fuck off.<eos> Kev, let me see Brock's profile again.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - I knew I'd seen that design before.<eos> - What the fuck is wrong with you?
Benny, come here!<eos> - Did he get you?<eos> - Yeah, he tore my dress.<eos> Stupid dog.<eos> Well, he's not stupid, he's just being protective, that's all.<eos> - I'm your daughter.<eos> - You're a stranger to him, is all.<eos> Come on, Benny.<eos> You know, Miranda, I've been thinking.<eos> I really should go with you tomorrow. Go down and look at that house.
I'm sorry.<eos> - Stop saying you're sorry.<eos> - Well, I just want to stay in touch.<eos> You could've written.<eos> You could've called.<eos> I could?<eos> Yeah, I thought I made that clear last time I visited.<eos> Well, I just... figured maybe you were just saying that.<eos> No, 'cause when I say something I mean it.<eos> I hope the same goes for you.
Manny.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> At all.<eos> You were so strong, Miranda.<eos> When your mother died, everyone figured you would rebel, cause all sorts of troubles.<eos> But you stayed the course.<eos> You stayed levelheaded.<eos> For the first time in my life...<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I'm really worried about you.
I had two already.<eos> Whoa, whoa, this ain't Molly.<eos> What is it?<eos> Something tight.<eos> This will take you to the moon and back, and you ain't even gonna blink.<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> And I'm telling you, Pandora has landed on my brain.<eos> So, whatever you're doing right here, Joshy boy, it's about to get a whole lot faster.<eos> Ah, ha-ha! All right, you got to buckle up 'cause we're about to lift off, and we're all coming with you.
Remember that trust thing we talked about?<eos> Shove it up your ass.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> Okay, Josh, how did I lie to you?<eos> You didn't tell me your best friend was Mary's brother.<eos> That's none of your goddamn business.<eos> That is between me and that family.<eos> You knew about me and Mary, yet you failed to mention that?<eos> Well, I guessed you would find out in your own time.<eos> She told me why they don't talk to you.
No.<eos> You mean that bag over there?<eos> And I'm back to "Yes."<eos> And right back to "No."<eos> Abort.<eos> Abort.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Guys... what are you doing in here?<eos> ... Well...<eos> We... just wanted to spend as much time as possible with you before you left for Miami.
Drive safely!<eos> What?<eos> I hope he gets home safe.<eos> Ouch!<eos> I got a splinter in my tail.<eos> I can't sleep without my pillow.<eos> I don't suppose they make Tempur-Pedic tree branches, do they?<eos> Seriously, guys?<eos> You're the ones who are supposed to be comfortable sleeping in trees, not me.<eos> We're not talking to you, okay?
So, I guess we're going to be family after all.<eos> Except for one tiny detail...<eos> By stealing the ring, we've effectively ruined the proposal.<eos> You're right.<eos> We need to get that ring, and get to that restaurant!<eos> Let's do it. Come on.<eos> Looks like Air Marshal Suggs is gonna be checking into the Shelborne Hotel.<eos> Yes!<eos> Time for a chip hunt!<eos> I really wanna go with you... but I'm stuck babysitting.
Bye, Theodore-able.<eos> Miles, that was amazing!<eos> Dave, we're so sorry we came to Miami without telling you.<eos> We just didn't wanna lose you.<eos> Lose me?<eos> Why would you guys ever think you were gonna lose me?<eos> Because you said you're starting a new chapter in your life.<eos> We thought you might bail on us.<eos> Technically, we're not even a family.<eos> We're just three chipmunks who live with you.
You should agree with the dialogue, that's good, but don't believe it too much, okay?<eos> Not believe it too much?<eos> Stay a bit to one side, okay?<eos> Tell me what's wrong!<eos> Just a little hitch with the guy picking up Huggins.<eos> What little hitch?<eos> His car broke down, but we're resolving it.<eos> You're all incompetent, thirty people, thirty incompetents.<eos> - I'll go.<eos> - I'll go with you later, if need be.
Think it over a little more.<eos> I realize it's a complicated period for you, but if necessary, the company will give you more time.<eos> There's no need, I've decided, and I won't change my mind.<eos> I know it's not elegant to remind you, but at your age...<eos> Yes?<eos> ...you won't find another job easily.<eos> I know! I know.<eos> Giovanni, it's me.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I can never reach you. Your answering machine's always on.
-IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL.<eos> -IT'S NOT WHAT YOU TOLD MOM.<eos> - OH, YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LISTEN.<eos> OH, SWEETIE, YOU ARE GROWING UP.<eos> AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, HANDSOME?<eos> DO YOU HAVE A NEW GIRLFRIEND?<eos> - NOT REALLY.<eos> - HE CAN'T SEEM TO FIND HIS BRAIN AROUND GIRLS.<eos> - SHUT UP.<eos> -SHE'S JUST MESSING WITH YOU.
Evacuate... right now.<eos> I'll be just a moment.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm going to, uh, get ready to evacuate.<eos> Beverly?<eos> Evans.<eos> Special Agent Ethan Burke.<eos> I'm here to see the Sheriff.<eos> ♪ a flame in your heart ♪ Hi, Arnie.<eos> There's a man here to see you.
And God's full support is there.<eos> The Taliban started the campaign that girls' education is against islam... and girls should not go to school.<eos> As long as girls are covered, they can get religious education.<eos> Any other type of education is completely unnecessary for women.<eos> Education was a threat to them.<eos> Education gives you the power to question things.<eos> The power to challenge things.<eos> To be independent.<eos> Peace be upon you.<eos> Peace be upon you, as well.

Told you I'd win, man.<eos> I told you.<eos> I tried to tell you something, bro.<eos> You don't wanna listen.<eos> You wanna learn things the hard way, huh?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Doing good.<eos> I just came home, I wanted to talk to you.
Something like that.<eos> Does he train you?<eos> My pop died before I was born.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> So what made you wanna sing?<eos> It makes me feel alive.<eos> Where's your next show?<eos> That place that you saw me at, Johnny Brenda's.<eos> I got a residency there so we're back on Friday.<eos> Can I roll with you?
Good to see you.<eos> Hey, champ.<eos> How you doing, bro?<eos> This guy is so good with the mitts, he's gonna teach you a lot of stuff.<eos> He's got a lot of knowledge.<eos> And Stitch, best cut man in Philadelphia.<eos> Hope we don't need him.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Welcome to Philly, brother.<eos> - Pleasure. - Glad to work with you.
Back it up.<eos> No, just like he's doing.<eos> Yeah. - I can't pivot fast enough.<eos> - Yeah, just turn it.<eos> That's your power.<eos> Fast, pop it fast.<eos> I'm popping as fast as I can. I'm trying to push off my back foot like you told me.<eos> Hey, Donnie.<eos> Come here.<eos> I came out here to work with you, though.
I'm popping as fast as I can. I'm trying to push off my back foot like you told me.<eos> Hey, Donnie.<eos> Come here.<eos> I came out here to work with you, though.<eos> This is how I work, okay?<eos> There's some things I can't do.<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> I can never hold the pads like that.<eos> But I'm looking at you.<eos> I'm working with you.
Yeah.<eos> Hey, champ.<eos> All right, Donnie.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> That's gonna bring him luck.<eos> You never been in front of this many people before, right?<eos> That don't matter.<eos> You've never been this far away from home.<eos> That don't matter.<eos> What matters is what you leave in that ring and what you take back with you.
Tomorrow.<eos> Leave the vote to us, eh Mrs Miller and well leave you to the home.<eos> Ive already made up the hours.<eos> Worked late Tuesday and Thursday.<eos> And Maggie will mop up any extra.<eos> Why dont you tell Mr Miller Ill give you a clip round the ear and knock some sense into you if he wont.<eos> Yeah, me an all.<eos> Do er some good, eh?<eos> Violet.<eos> Ill come with you tomorrow.
But youre only fodder for a battle that none of you can win.<eos> I am offering you a lifeline.<eos> Take it.<eos> Before it is too late.<eos> Come on, George.<eos> George! Youre scuffing your shoes.<eos> Whats the matter with you?<eos> What would your mother say?<eos> George!<eos> What am I going to do with you?
That's-- lt's a crazy cupcake!<eos> -You love cakes.<eos> -Well... I'm not a big cake.... I make cakes.<eos> Yes. I see the connection.<eos> Now you can wear a cake.<eos> How did you know I don't care for traditional jewelry?<eos> I can't seem to stop looking at it... and it can't stop looking at me.<eos> Imagine how awkward it would've been if it'd been a diamond ring or something.<eos> Not a diamond ring! No!<eos> I would've had to say, "l don't want to marry you!"
There's no money.<eos> It's a bunch of amateurs, and there's no strategy for improvement.<eos> So I'd like it if you come on as team director.<eos> Well, you certainly make it sound attractive.<eos> Oh, believe me, you would be better off far, far, far away.<eos> I'll tell you something.<eos> After the disease, I never wanna be that close to losing again.<eos> You wanna win the Tour?<eos> - Postal deal still on the table?<eos> - Yeah. - I wanna talk to you.
We can explain.<eos> The EPO test is not simple.<eos> There is a protein isoform, your level is 75% which is high, yes, but still it's...<eos> No one's listening.<eos> No one will say he's borderline.<eos> They'll say he's a cheat.<eos> He is single-handedly transforming your shitty little Eurosport into a globally significant brand.<eos> Please, no one appreciates Lance more than we do.<eos> Right, in terms of what we do with this result, I think you should do whatever you think is best for the integrity of cycling.<eos> I'll leave it to you.
I'm not training because I enjoy it, I'm not training because I wanna stay fit.<eos> It's my whole... my whole life.<eos> It's what I do.<eos> It's what I do.<eos> That's all for now, Mr Armstrong.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> Lance, it's Bill.<eos> It's about Nike.<eos> They thought you ought to know before they go public.<eos> They wanna stand by you, no question, but it's just, I mean, now's not so good, right?
What's that?<eos> Halt!<eos> You there!<eos> Stop!<eos> - Water.<eos> - Who did this to you?
The runaway bride.<eos> Obviously you need to work on your relationship skills.<eos> You and I could still be partners, if you weren't so loyal.<eos> Like a dog.<eos> Well, she's the one you want to watch out for.<eos> You think I'm deceptive?<eos> She will reel you in and rip out your heart.<eos> You're an animal.<eos> Then you shouldn't have tried to tame me.<eos> I'll deal with you later.
Mydaughterswentthere. I know, but tuition has doubled since your daughters.<eos> Oh,okay.<eos> You'regoingto land onyourfeet.<eos> Youhaveto .<eos> Upstairs woman or downstairs woman?<eos> Both.<eos> Why aren't you at school?<eos> Conservation day.<eos> Are you going to Paris?<eos> Mmm-mmm. I have a short day too, so I could meet you after piano.
Actually, he gave the keys to Katarina, so you might wanna look out for her.<eos> You don't want him to eat your girlfriend.<eos> Aw, that's real cute.<eos> Seriously, you should go with her.<eos> She looks really upset.<eos> All right, if we got the keys, let's go.<eos> All right, let's go, yeah. [speaking Ukrainian] Um, this is Inna, and she's local... witch.<eos> Yeah, and she can go with us to help us.<eos> I'm sorry, and how is a witch supposed to help us?<eos> People here are a bit different, and they're afraid of strangers, and they might not want to talk to you, but they will definitely talk to Inna.
- You gotta watch this!<eos> - Let's go check it out.<eos> Ryan, you weren't shooting in the attic last night, were you?<eos> - No.<eos> Why?<eos> - Look at this.<eos> Well, somebody must have shot it on the camera.<eos> Look, I know that you're trying to make things more interesting, but I'm not buying it.<eos> Jenny, I said it wasn't me, all right?<eos> I can go with you, if you want.
How you gonna use it?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We have to listen to him.<eos> We will bring it into the house.<eos> We don't have to do shit.<eos> We're the fucking idiots.<eos> We're running around and doing whatever he says.<eos> No, we will bring it to the house.<eos> - We will finish it now!<eos> - What is wrong with you?
Jenny.<eos> Jenny?<eos> Jenny.<eos> Jenny.<eos> Jenny, are you okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Jenny.<eos> Jenny, are you okay?<eos> Jenny?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
-[interviewer] Michael, here we are at this royal premiere.<eos> Huge, great crowd standing behind us now as we're talking.<eos> -[Fox] Yeah, I'm not nervous at all.<eos> - What do you make of an occasion like this?<eos> -It's...<eos> It's wonderfully exciting.<eos> I mean, it's, uh... It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.<eos> If indeed it is only a once-in-a-lifetime thing for me, I'll die satisfied.<eos> -[Fox] The greeting line where we met the royals, Princess Diana and Prince Charles, and we had this little guy, this little super-serious protocol guy tell us,<eos> "You can't speak unless you're spoken to.
Got the big pool, up on top.<eos> Lockdown. Good.<eos> My man, let's do it. Come on.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's my boy, Greg DiStefano, man.<eos> Buying alcohol from a cop?<eos> Hey, don't worry.<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> You're under arrest for being gay.<eos> No, I'm fucking with you.
He's my friend.<eos> I feel like these guys are...<eos> Like the gay versions of us?<eos> Fuck, man.<eos> So what's up?<eos> We got a party?<eos> You want liquor, I know.<eos> I got to ask. Everyone who's drinking, they 21?<eos> Right?<eos> Wink. I'm fucking with you.
I feel like these guys are...<eos> Like the gay versions of us?<eos> Fuck, man.<eos> So what's up?<eos> We got a party?<eos> You want liquor, I know.<eos> I got to ask. Everyone who's drinking, they 21?<eos> Right?<eos> Wink. I'm fucking with you.<eos> Always fucking with you.
What is going on here?<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> He's got a boner.<eos> A what? I have a boner, that's true.<eos> But it's about Rachel.<eos> Frank, that's disgusting.<eos> And you!<eos> I'm the manager.<eos> Put some clothes on.<eos> What's wrong with you, perv?
You're a smart man, Chuck.<eos> Chuck, one.<eos> Lifeguards, lose.<eos> That was awkward.<eos> So, what was so important that you came to my house?<eos> Oh, uh... Well, there was just this...<eos> There's this staff party that we're having.<eos> It's gonna be this big, huge party and I thought that, since I'm leaving, maybe it would be fun if you wanted to, I don't know, go to the party.<eos> Danny, that's really sweet.<eos> And please don't take this the wrong way, because it has nothing to do with you.
I guess this happens with pools sometimes.<eos> Did you do this?<eos> Why would I want to ruin a party that I wasn't invited to?<eos> You son of a bitch. Okay.<eos> Skootch, Skootch, Skootch.<eos> Look. Don't move, and don't touch nothing.<eos> Yeah, yeah, you got it, Konko.<eos> I got to get the fuck out of here.<eos> Shaolin's finest.<eos> Wassup with you?
Let's go.<eos> Did they tow my fucking car?<eos> You don't even know what I had to go through to get weed.<eos> Which I got.<eos> I had a gun pointed at my head.<eos> I had to ride in the back of an ice cream truck.<eos> I had to do fake cocaine.<eos> This entire thing sucks.<eos> This whole plan has been fucked since the beginning.<eos> Krystal's not coming and Rachel doesn't even talk to you.
"Cemile, you will always be by my side."<eos> "I can't live without you."<eos> What about all that?<eos> Cemile, please don't.<eos> This is my job.<eos> How else am I going to make a living?<eos> Let's take the girls and go.<eos> -What are you talking about?<eos> -I'm saying we should leave this place.<eos> Do you want me to take the kids and go with you?
Kids!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You should not behave this way.<eos> I don't want to see you picking on Aziz anymore.<eos> If you don't listen to me, you can forget about candies, biscuits and me.<eos> And I won't let you in school.<eos> Understood?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Aziz?<eos> The kids won't pick on you anymore.
It's just<eos> - I know what you mean.<eos> Really?<eos> Do you want some?<eos> Listen to me!<eos> It feels what I feel!<eos> Open up, I need to piss!<eos> You're not the only ones here!<eos> - Dude, chill out!<eos> Think I'm fucking with you, right?
Give it a chance. True.<eos> Patience isn't my strong point though.<eos> So, you... You're probably wanting that sugar, right?<eos> Sorry?<eos> The sugar you came over to borrow.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> Well, I suppose I'll see you around?<eos> - How about tonight?<eos> - You want a tour of the pubs?<eos> Pubs really aren't my scene, to be honest with you. I'm...
- What?<eos> No.<eos> The prospect of ending up with someone for that long.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't think it does.<eos> I mean, my parents were together for decades.<eos> They went through a lot of shit together and came out on the other side, still in love.<eos> I suppose I'd like to find a relationship with that kind of commitment, you know.<eos> Cool.<eos> But I haven't always had the best luck with women to be honest with you.
Not for me, it wasn't.<eos> Me neither.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Agnes?<eos> Hello? It's John Davies here.<eos> Look, I'm staying downstairs.<eos> Me and you really need to talk, yeah?<eos> Agnes?<eos> Agnes?<eos> What happened to you, dolly?
Everybody turned you guys down.<eos> And if it wasn't for Jimmy, I wouldn't sponsor you either.<eos> So you kids either shape up or we can just go home right now.<eos> You hear what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah, Big Mama.<eos> Darth Vader, can you please go and get Jimmy back for me now?<eos> Well?<eos> I'm in.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I'm with you, Coach.
Rasheed has a bad temper, but he loves this stuff.<eos> I mean, he watches every kung fu movie that comes out.<eos> So my husband and I just thought this could be a good place for him to learn some discipline.<eos> Mrs. Shabazz, you've brought him to the right place.<eos> That's good news.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Rasheed, you're gonna get started tomorrow morning, okay?<eos> All right, well, we'll be going now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nice talking to you, Rasheed.
Thank you.<eos> Nice talking to you, Rasheed.<eos> Hooh-ah. That boy doesn't need karate, he needs therapy.<eos> Hey, Charlie, I was that kid, remember?<eos> And I've always been thankful that you never gave up on me.<eos> That means you're staying for good, right?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> What I said was I was thankful.<eos> Charlie, I've gotta get you some hearing aids because you're beginning to hear things.<eos> I'll talk to you later, Charlie.
Be careful.<eos> Think of your team!<eos> Think of your team, Rasheed!<eos> Think of your team.<eos> Watch it.<eos> Rasheed, confidence.<eos> Believe in yourself.<eos> Now take it to him, Rasheed.<eos> Hey, come on, little bro.<eos> It's all you, man.
Now take it to him, Rasheed.<eos> Hey, come on, little bro.<eos> It's all you, man.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Come on! - What are you doing, man?<eos> I bet your whole family is a spazz.<eos> Look at his moves.<eos> It's so unorthodox.<eos> Come on, bro.<eos> It's you, man.
Yeah.<eos> Yes, you love the doll.<eos> But what if I told you that was the only doll you're allowed to play with the rest of your life?<eos> How would you feel?<eos> Sad.<eos> You'd feel sad!<eos> Of course!<eos> Because there's a lot of other dolls on your shelves.<eos> And if you play with the other dolls, you can't have that doll anymore.<eos> Even though that doll doesn't really want to play with you at this point.
That's your dick?<eos> Uh-huh! Too big!<eos> Your dick doesn't end.<eos> Why doesn't your dick end?<eos> Have you ever fucked someone before?<eos> Where is she buried?<eos> That looks like the whole cast of Game of Thrones.<eos> Come here.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm, like, really shy, Uh-huh. So we should probably do this first so I feel comfortable with you.
You can sleep with other girls.<eos> It's like every guy's dream.<eos> It's not this guy's dream.<eos> Yeah, this guy's got a dream, and it's us making it!<eos> Getting married, moving out to the countryside, having a family.<eos> Three boys and two more boys.<eos> Enough for a basketball team.<eos> And I'll develop a CrossFit program and patent it.<eos> And I'll rule the CrossFit world.<eos> With you by my side.
Ijust, like... I'm very high, and I just kind of need this interaction to be over.<eos> You serious?<eos> Fuck you, Amy.<eos> You are not nice.<eos> I'm totally nice.<eos> Maybe you should consider changing your ways.<eos> My "ways"? Mmm-hmm.<eos> You would love having a family.<eos> You sound like Steven.<eos> I wish I could break up with you.
He called me on purpose. Hang up.<eos> He's obviously sick or something.<eos> Yeah, what's up?<eos> I was calling to say I had a really good time last night.<eos> I was wondering if you wanted to, um, hang out again.<eos> Will you say that again, please?<eos> I was wondering ifl could see you again.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna call the police. Hold on, hold on.<eos> I'll just talk to you about it tomorrow at the interview.
I mean...<eos> You're building him up, and you're gonna let yourself in for a big fall.<eos> He's gonna break your heart.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> I'll tell Temembe to come get you.<eos> Amy, don't leave like this.<eos> I don't like it when you don't talk to me for a while.<eos> Thank you so much for doing this with me.<eos> No, I wanna be doing this with you.
You don't get to pretend today like you gave a fuck.<eos> I think that's enough for today, Amy.<eos> We ought to go.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey-<eos> You Okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm good.<eos> You ready to go?<eos> Yeah, let's go.<eos> Ijust want you to know, I really care about you, okay?
Are you serious right now?<eos> I've been through a lot this year, and of course I'm gonna have some ups and downs, but that's why I need to stop and then say,<eos> "Am I gonna just follow the river "or am I gonna make decisions in my..."<eos> You're sleeping!<eos> You were just asleep.<eos> No, I wasn't.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Because I am not even close to done.<eos> Okay. I have a lot of thoughts and I'm thinking very clearly right now.<eos> I'm so glad that I feel comfortable enough with you to talk like this.
It hurts like a mother.<eos> Yeah, hey.<eos> I'll be right over.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Just sit tight, I'll be right over.<eos> LeBron!<eos> Hey.<eos> You Okay?<eos> I'm not okay, Aaron.<eos> I'm concerned about you.
This is your intervention.<eos> What?<eos> My intervention?<eos> For what?<eos> You ruined things with Amy.<eos> This is about Amy?<eos> You've been so sad lately.<eos> It's scaring me.<eos> Aaron.<eos> We're concerned about you.
I wanted to show you I can work hard and put myself out there, you know?<eos> I got that.<eos> And not be afraid to fail.<eos> No.<eos> I got the metaphor.<eos> 'Cause with the dance, I wanted to show you us.<eos> Yeah, I got the metaphor.<eos> It's like I really wanna try.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wanna try with you.
I had missed the boat.<eos> I had gotten into the animated cartoon field too late.<eos> Film cartooning had been going on for all of six or seven years.<eos> I should have started then.<eos> I don't see how I could top those New York boys now.<eos> I thought you'd be here.<eos> You all right, Walt?<eos> I'm going to go to California. Get a fresh start.<eos> It's a great idea.<eos> You should probably take this with you.
We did it.<eos> This was a good date.<eos> We did the date.<eos> - I think it was the first I think it might have been the first date I've ever been on so I don't really have much to compare it to, but it seemed solid.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay.<eos> Shit...<eos> What?<eos> I<eos> - I want to fuck you. - What?
This was an awful idea.<eos> Oh wow, that's weird.<eos> I can hear my mom's voice when I'm underwater.<eos> Oh, this is good stuff.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm Chris. This is Paul.<eos> Lainey.<eos> Jake.<eos> - Ah, hi you two. Are you guys married?<eos> This is my son, and he really liked dancing with you.
- Sir, I can't stress enough- if we give her water I don't know what happens.<eos> - Give me this water. - See? She's addicted.<eos> She's addicted.<eos> This is an addict.<eos> I have seen it a hundred times with her.<eos> You gotta trust me.<eos> You have lost your mind.<eos> And you have lost your water.<eos> I guess we're tied.<eos> I want to be able to talk you about this kind of thing. I sense that.
What was the other thing - oh yeah, buzz me for the three o' clock.<eos> And that's it. - Okay.<eos> - Yeah, don't fuck that up.<eos> You got to let them have it.<eos> Hey, will you sign this for me please?<eos> Well I have to know what it is first. Oh.<eos> It's a nullification of my contract.<eos> It says I resign and forfeit any vesting stock options to Xander.<eos> And why would you do that?<eos> Right, no. because I want to go on a date with you.
My phone died.<eos> So. How was your day?<eos> Swell.<eos> Want to come up?<eos> It's over.<eos> He didn't choose me.<eos> You never told him to make a choice, you know.<eos> How was Paula?<eos> That was a mess.<eos> She nice to you?
Good.<eos> What's up?<eos> Are we in love with each other?<eos> What are we gonna do about it?<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Nothing.<eos> There's nothing to do.<eos> I love you for free, Lainey.<eos> I love you for free, Jake.<eos> I guess I can't talk you into a road trip to Ann Arbor?
Even the word "Think" is wrong, because I don't actively do anything.<eos> You're just here.<eos> Look, I didn't think I'd remember you.<eos> I thought that I would forget about all of it. And I didn't...<eos> You know, I just-I know we're no good at this shit.<eos> And that's why we agreed to stop seeing each other. So we wouldn't fuck it up.<eos> But I want you to come back.<eos> I need you to...<eos> Because ahh,<eos> Because I'd rather fail with you, than win with anyone else.
- I'm not. - No.<eos> Well, that's good, that's good...<eos> 'Cause... everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Did I tell you that I had surgery once? - You did?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> It's nothing. Nothing to be worried about. Nothing.<eos> No, it was perfectly fine.<eos> When I came out... bizarre.<eos> I started farting all the time.<eos> I hope it doesn't happen to you.
I'm not looking for Tylenol.<eos> Can you help me? Are you a nurse?<eos> Are you a doctor?<eos> What the fuck are you?<eos> Can you help?<eos> Franny, what are you doing?<eos> Franny.<eos> I'm here to see Toby.<eos> I want to see him.<eos> Franny, what happened to you?
He's not lying to you.<eos> He's fine, all right?<eos> He's post op. He doesn't need to be here.<eos> He's okay.<eos> - He's fine. - Show me.<eos> - We're gonna take five minutes, okay?<eos> - All right, get him out of here, please.<eos> Let's move.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm not gonna try and relate to you, Franny.
My mother, she wonders if you have brought your famous hat.<eos> Oh, the deer stalker.<eos> That was an embellishment of the illustrator.<eos> I've never worn one.<eos> - And the pipe?<eos> - I prefer a cigar.<eos> I told Watson, if I ever write a story myself, it will be to correct the million misconceptions created by his imaginative licence.<eos> Did you write such a story?<eos> But I'm trying to do so now.<eos> I must finish with you before I die.
Mr Holmes?<eos> Are we going for our swim?<eos> I've already seen to the apiary.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm perfectly...<eos> I'm quite...<eos> Perfectly fine.<eos> All right, Roger.<eos> You go along.<eos> I'll catch you up.
And now, the making of a harlot.<eos> She was a young girl driven astray by the lustful lure of the flesh.<eos> She looked every bit the harlot she was bound to become.<eos> With her brassiere straps exposed, her tight pants rode up snugly at the crotch, almost like a horse, when viewed from behind.<eos> He was a beautiful junior, rich and famous in high school.<eos> His name?<eos> Ricky Wasserman.<eos> What?<eos> It's just so intense.<eos> I mean, there's something about having sex with you, Minnie, kind of scares me.
She's like a little doll.<eos> My mother doesn't touch me if she can avoid it.<eos> She used to touch me a lot, in a motherly way, when I was little.<eos> But then...<eos> There's something sexual about Minnie's need for physical affection from you.<eos> It's not natural.<eos> Hey! Come on, lazy bones!<eos> Help me.<eos> Come on, Minnie.<eos> I wanna dance with you, too.
I did meet this guy at the movies.<eos> This black guy with a huge dick.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, what happened?<eos> He fucked me in the back of his car.<eos> Really?<eos> Just like that, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wanted it.<eos> So, some stranger comes up to you who wants to fuck you, and you say, "Yes."
Don't you think?<eos> I think we do.<eos> That's not the point, that you get along with her.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> The point is that you fucked my daughter, and so you're gonna marry her. That's the point.<eos> Mom.<eos> What?<eos> It's true, right?<eos> He porked you?<eos> He porked you, and so now he's gotta marry you!
We're making grilled cheese.<eos> Yeah, she's real young.<eos> You like that?<eos> Minnie?<eos> God damn it, Minnie.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Oh, my God, we were so worried about you.
Well, it got pretty wet here.<eos> You know what, big day tomorrow.<eos> First day of school.<eos> It's getting kind of late.<eos> But it's, like, 8:30.<eos> No, no, no. Actually, I gotta get going.<eos> It's a big day tomorrow.<eos> I'll walk outwith you, Mr. Peterson.<eos> Oh, I'm going to stay around awhile, thanks.<eos> Well, you know, I'll walk out with you, Noah.
Tell me you're not going to.<eos> I'm thinking about it. Oh, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Oh, I know! I know.<eos> Let's tell him to take his cookies and shove 'em right up his ass.<eos> You know what?<eos> Enough with the cookie jokes.<eos> We've all done things in our lives that we wish we wouldn't have.<eos> You know what? Maybe you should start worrying about yourself for a change.<eos> Ifs way more fun worrying about you.
Quiet's not good.<eos> Alex, you see this face?<eos> This is my "whoop-ass" face.<eos> When you see this face, it means I'm about to whoop ass.<eos> Get ready. Come on.<eos> "You gave me life when I was dying.<eos> And when I was leaving this world..."<eos> - Quinn!<eos> - Jesus, you scared me!<eos> I need to rely on you to get him up and going.
"You will go to the end of the world and you will find me waiting there.<eos> "Your servant."<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You can start the scene again.<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know it.<eos> Do you wanna take a break and come back in a little bit?<eos> I hate him, and I don't mean I pretend to hate him, like, "Really, I love you.
What's happening to me?<eos> One night after you came to see me,<eos> I had a vision of you.<eos> You were standing in the dark.<eos> A man was walking toward you.<eos> A man who couldn't breathe.<eos> I've been to that dark place, too.<eos> It's not a place for pure souls.<eos> It is very dangerous.<eos> When you go there, things come back with you.
I have done something bad in the past.<eos> I can't help you just yet.<eos> What if I wait for you?<eos> I promise I'll live till the day you can save me<eos> I'm sure you can.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Hit him hard!<eos> Harder!<eos> What's wrong with you?
- I'm here right now.<eos> - Yes, you fucking are.<eos> To our hero who's back... to stay.<eos> Hey, hey, we're have a true-blooded, whisky-drinkin' turban-chasin', son of America right here.<eos> Line up and pay your respects.<eos> Buy this man a beer!<eos> - Just sit down, sit down.<eos> - Buy me a beer too. I can see nothing's changed.<eos> Uh, where's Toad?<eos> Oh, dude, Toad, he's fucking pissed at you, dude.
Are you gonna bitch about this all night?<eos> Should have called us more, man. Yeah.<eos> What, we're not good enough for you, Spence?<eos> It's like his third time by how am I suppose to keep getting hyped up for this shit?<eos> Why didn't you call me, you asshole?<eos> Fuck you all.<eos> He was so damn sad.<eos> I can't wait to tell Emily how dumped you were.<eos> Man, you wanna play with the winner?<eos> I don't see a winner around. I guess I'll play with you.
This night is perfect.<eos> Would you wanna live here forever, Spencer Koll?<eos> I could do that Alice...<eos> Shelley.<eos> Shelley.<eos> Do you wanna live here forever, Alice Shelley?<eos> I want that.<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't ever want to go back.<eos> I wanna stay here... with you forever.
Spencer.<eos> Spencer, look at me.<eos> Sir, you can't leave against medical adviser not signing...<eos> - Where you going?<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> I can't be here anymore, I have things to do.<eos> What things?<eos> Wait-wait-wait, take it easy. Calm down.<eos> You wanna get outta here?<eos> Let's go, I'll go with you.
That's what I've learned.<eos> She found this book at the party.<eos> It was in the library and she recited every fucking word of it from memory.<eos> Holy Grail. Destiny kinda shit.<eos> I don't know what you're talkin' about, man.<eos> Look, I'll-I'll go check at the lake.<eos> I need you to help me maximize my extended breath-hold.<eos> I'm out of practice.<eos> Hold this.<eos> Spencer, what is going on with you, man?
Most of the time.<eos> Spencer, I'm trying to tell you that I think you need help.<eos> Yes, will you time me?<eos> Who's Alice?<eos> Where did you meet her?<eos> - At work.<eos> - When?<eos> I don't know, what's the day.<eos> Did you know her before you broke up with me?<eos> - I didn't break up with you.
I didn't say no. Can't you just...<eos> Can't you just what?<eos> Figure it out, stupid girlfriend or sometimes-girlfriend or whatever it is that I am?<eos> My God, Spencer, you were so good and now lying and not telling the truth all at once.<eos> It's just a thing that happened.<eos> So that's it?<eos> You come back and it's like five years together that's just gone?<eos> You had your freedom, and now you come back and you're some kinda guy that takes random girls to parties?<eos> You don't think that I know that I fucked up.<eos> Whatever I'm feeling it's not about you.

Cell phone videos, all that.<eos> Family lawyer has got in touch with us.<eos> Now, luckily there's no brain damage.<eos> Gonna be some reconstructive surgery necessary.<eos> I think it's much better if we just sweep it away, settle out of court.<eos> Your parents and I'll pay off all the bills.<eos> And you are gonna work off every last cent, you understand me?<eos> Yes, you'll pay off the bills.<eos> We can deal with that later.<eos> I think what's much more important here is that everyone's concerned about you.
Just stop asking questions.<eos> It's just a place like any other.<eos> But can it last forever?<eos> Can anything?<eos> If you don't let it end, it doesn't have to.<eos> It'll never have to. Right?<eos> Only question you should be asking is where should I be right now.<eos> I know the answer.<eos> Here.<eos> With you.
It's not funny!<eos> Wow, he was actually mad.<eos> I knew coming' up here was a bad idea.<eos> Yo, what, hey.<eos> What if he really just died right now?<eos> - I'd feel bad about that? - You-you'd feel bad about that?<eos> You're the master of the understatement, Howie.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Hey, man, you really think he was trying to drown himself?<eos> What the hell is matter with you?
And if you keep going on like this you're never gonna come up.<eos> Fuck, man, draw a picture of her.<eos> Or write a story, so that maybe I can meet her but just-just fucking stop this.<eos> Stop it.<eos> What is that?<eos> Spencer, you realize there's people that actually need you right?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I mean you wanna go away?<eos> You wanna leave this place then do it, go.<eos> But don't leave your life, I mean do you hear the way that kid talks to you?
Don't fuck with me, man, I trust you.<eos> Clink, bitch.<eos> Alright.<eos> You can say that, but what is his team going to do?<eos> They have no identity.<eos> They have no identity at all.<eos> What I'm concerned about is really the outfield player.<eos> It doesn't make any sense, Jim.<eos> It doesn't, it doesn't make any sense.<eos> I completely agree with you.
I was just too nice to say anything.<eos> -I don't know what you mean.<eos> -I got it!<eos> Good save.<eos> -No, that's not...<eos> -It's Dad.<eos> Take your time.<eos> What's up?<eos> Hello... Again.<eos> She's not gonna date you, you know.
-Bro, you're messing everything.<eos> --You got nothing to prove.<eos> --You're a pussy, man.<eos> -Now, dude!<eos> Now!<eos> -Hey, don't move, cabron!<eos> Don't move.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> I'm being robbed!<eos> What's wrong with you?
I just think you need to know what's happening.<eos> No.<eos> -You don't know anything about us.<eos> Actually, I do.<eos> I know your son very well.<eos> And I know that he wrestled a gun away from his brother in a botched robbery a couple of hours ago.<eos> Lorenzo was there?<eos> Lorenzo, get your ass out here now!<eos> -Your brother got picked up?<eos> What's wrong with you?
No.<eos> -You don't know anything about us.<eos> Actually, I do.<eos> I know your son very well.<eos> And I know that he wrestled a gun away from his brother in a botched robbery a couple of hours ago.<eos> Lorenzo was there?<eos> Lorenzo, get your ass out here now!<eos> -Your brother got picked up?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> What's wrong with you?
That's true.<eos> What did your husband do?<eos> Why are you asking me about my husband?<eos> I was just curious.<eos> I just want to know more about you.<eos> He was a lawyer.<eos> His name was Bill, by the way.<eos> You got to be kidding.<eos> What was he like?<eos> Nothing like you.
Would you have rather had a friendly no?<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> Joan, you've never experienced that before?<eos> Have you, P9993'?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You can't have it both ways.<eos> You can't dress the way you do...<eos> How do I dress?<eos> Look, they didn't take me seriously, either.<eos> So what you're saying is I don't dress the way you do because I don't look like you.
Flight's not till 6:00.<eos> I hate to disappoint you, but I don't need that much time.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> I can't find my passport.<eos> It's okay.<eos> This is a romantic spot.<eos> Stevie.<eos> I'm sorry, but what were we going to do in Paris?<eos> I thought you were a fling, but now I think maybe you're more.<eos> I don't want to sleep with you on the night we first met.
You're already making enemies in high places.<eos> Keep it up.<eos> Sam, get control of this situation.<eos> Ugh.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for backing me up.<eos> You have great instincts, Kate.<eos> Bill.<eos> - Can I talk to you for a sec?
She's gotten so old. She forgets where she hides it so asked me to take it away.<eos> That's the key money for the king's tavern.<eos> I always believed in you. You know?<eos> That's because you're in the audience.<eos> Actors can't convince each other easily.<eos> - Look at that. Our king.<eos> - And you're my queen.<eos> We didn't act well. We destroyed everything.<eos> Always in an argument...<eos> I remember first time I was left alone with you.
You forgot that, too.<eos> Just give me a break, all right?<eos> If you forgive me, I'll make it up to you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> How?<eos> Breakfast in bed?<eos> That sounds like dessert. Mmm. I think I'm just going to stick with the coffee.<eos> No, you need to eat something, soak up all that booze.<eos> Just give it a rest, will you?<eos> You want me to stop caring about you?
Yeah?<eos> How?<eos> Breakfast in bed?<eos> That sounds like dessert. Mmm. I think I'm just going to stick with the coffee.<eos> No, you need to eat something, soak up all that booze.<eos> Just give it a rest, will you?<eos> You want me to stop caring about you?<eos> I want you to get off my back.<eos> Nora.<eos> Nora, I'm worried about you.
Nora.<eos> Nora, I'm worried about you.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - No, you're hungover.<eos> And if you're not hungover, you're drunk.<eos> That is such bullshit.<eos> You've got a problem.<eos> Yeah, my boyfriend's a pain in the ass.<eos> Nora.<eos> Look, I'm really worried about you.
What?<eos> The truck hit the passenger side of the car.<eos> The doctors said she died instantly.<eos> She didn't feel any pain.<eos> She's dead?<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Does her boyfriend know?<eos> He's here.<eos> Someone is with him now.<eos> Nora, the police want to talk to you.
- Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Your Dad's been ringing.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you want me to take you over?<eos> Not yet.<eos> He still loves you, you know, no matter what's happened.<eos> What if I don't love him?<eos> Come on.<eos> You sure you don't want me to come with you?
Nora?<eos> That you?<eos> It's good to see you, love.<eos> It's good to see you, Dad.<eos> Fancy a cuppa?<eos> Betsy will make one.<eos> No, I'm all right.<eos> You've been well, then?<eos> Better for seeing you.<eos> Been worried about you.
And if I don't, then I don't think I'm going to make it.<eos> So was it lonely when Mom died?<eos> Of course it bloody was.<eos> I was left on my own to look after two teenage girls.<eos> You weren't the easiest kid to look after, believe you me.<eos> I missed my mom.<eos> I acted out.<eos> We all missed her.<eos> I look the most like her, though, don't I?<eos> Shannon looks more like you.
The strain of your accident has nearly killed your sister.<eos> I'm sorry, Dad.<eos> That's not going to work anymore.<eos> I've had enough of this crap.<eos> Where's Betty?<eos> She's gone out.<eos> It's just the two of us now.<eos> - Get out of my way.<eos> - No, not this time.<eos> Prison's done something funny to you.
Look at me.<eos> I'm an old man.<eos> I've not got many years left.<eos> Don't take her away from me.<eos> Tell me why you did it.<eos> Come on!<eos> I didn't mean it to happen.<eos> I just wanted to teach you a lesson.<eos> A lesson?<eos> I didn't know how to handle you, wearing all those clothes and coming in all hours.
Hey, Brian, I gotta use the bathroom.<eos> Go for it, you use the bathroom.<eos> Everybody's gotta use the bathroom.<eos> We all gotta use the bathroom.<eos> Use the bathroom.<eos> We gotta get that truck, though.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I can't go with the door open.<eos> All right, I'll turn around.<eos> No, I can't go with you standing there.
We were. That's why I thought if I tell you<eos> I have a sick aunt, you would just give me a pass.<eos> Then we could get back together after the holidays. But, Leah, the second I broke up with you,<eos> I regretted it.<eos> What do you think I am? -A toy? -No.<eos> You think I'm just a doll you can pick up when you want to play with it again?<eos> ♪ Oh, you're on your own ♪<eos> Steve, you played me. No! See, that's the thing.<eos> I never played you.<eos> James is playing you.
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you.<eos> Are you, by chance, going to Los Angeles?<eos> -No.<eos> -No?<eos> Sweet.<eos> Are you, by chance, going South?<eos> I'm looking for a ride.<eos> Hello?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> If you keep doing this, they're going to kick you out of school.
-For sleeping.<eos> Um, well, I just thought I'd camp out there.<eos> You're gonna camp in the backyard?<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Um, I guess.<eos> All right, well, I'm gonna...<eos> I'm gonna go to bed.<eos> I have to get up early.<eos> I have a huge day tomorrow.<eos> Speaking of that, I wanted to talk to you about tomorrow.
Yeah, I think my parents would have known.<eos> I mean, they have to reveal that legally.<eos> They didn't reveal anything back then.<eos> Conrad was a ward of the state and he was adopted just like a normal kid.<eos> That's your brother.<eos> I need to talk to my brother.<eos> -Okay.<eos> I'm gonna go back out to the party.<eos> -Okay.<eos> I'll meet up with you.
I mean, you're...<eos> Look at how you're fucking reacting!<eos> Charlie's on the phone.<eos> Dude, I gotta go.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, he's right here.<eos> I'm gonna put him on.<eos> He's out of solitary.<eos> Hi.<eos> Yeah, good to talk to you, man.
I need to talk to you.<eos> Just one second. Please!<eos> Fuck him.<eos> We got five minutes.<eos> Let's go.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> -Connie!<eos> -I gotta go!<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> Please! I just need to talk to you for one minute!
What?<eos> Did he shave your head?<eos> No!<eos> Is this another fucking thing you're gonna come down on me about?<eos> No.<eos> Look...<eos> What?<eos> Okay.<eos> That stuff with Dad that you were talking about before.<eos> Dad was an asshole to you.
- Yes, it is.<eos> - Ma?<eos> - Hi, honey.<eos> - Mom, what are you doing awake?<eos> - I couldn't sleep.<eos> - Your medication isn't working?<eos> - I haven't taken it yet.<eos> I was thinking of taking the dog out for a walk.<eos> It's 4:00 a.m., Ma.<eos> - I worry about you.
I believe you.<eos> Now I want to speak with Vaughn before we finish this.<eos> All right, we are following this situation of a runaway bus.<eos> Suspected hijackers are on this bus and there is a very heavy police presence following the bus down the highway.<eos> Sorry, kiddo.<eos> Bus 657, please respond.<eos> - Bus 657, bus 657? Come in, please.<eos> - Turn that goddamn thing down.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
If you want it to happen, you'll do me a favor.<eos> - Is he okay?<eos> - He ran away from home.<eos> His sister picks on him and his parents take her side every time, apparently.<eos> I hear that.<eos> Move slow, a-hole.<eos> This is not going to end well for you.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Take the shot.<eos> No, I'm not fucking kidding you.
How are you today?<eos> I'm great, I think.<eos> I haven't been able to get ahold of anybody since I got here, and I can't leave.<eos> And the only reason that I'm here is because I was sent here to find you and Bill Evans.<eos> And guess what?<eos> I found both of you.<eos> Only you're... working in a toy store and living in a house with a picket fence and a man named Harold, and Bill Evans' mutilated corpse is rotting in an abandoned house on the outskirts of town,<eos> But other than that, I couldn't be happier.<eos> What happened to him, Kate?<eos> And what happened to you?
Yeah, I'm gonna find him myself.<eos> Now?<eos> No, in the morning.<eos> Either Ethan is dead or he has abandoned his family, and I'm gonna find out which one it is.<eos> And if it is the latter, then I am going to kill him myself.<eos> Oh, can I help?<eos> Yes, you can stay with Ben.<eos> I'm coming with you. No, sweetie, you have to stay with Aunt Darla.<eos> You have school.<eos> No, I'm coming with you.
And every one of our tests involved metal in some capacity.<eos> Even the trace amounts of iron in the cereal.<eos> And this guy had been complicit with Norman's ruse right from the start.<eos> Right under our noses.<eos> It was... it was a crushing blow.<eos> For the institute's credibility and for Henry's reputation.<eos> It was... it was awful.<eos> Is there... something else we should know about?<eos> Judith?<eos> With you?
Meeya more.<eos> And you said this was, um, all locally grown organically?<eos> I'm glad somebody noticed.<eos> Forgive me for having a deposition in the morning.<eos> I take it couples counseling went well today?<eos> Hey, mom.<eos> - Hi, baby. - You hungry?<eos> I was thinking of ordering Chinese.<eos> Look how thin I was there.<eos> Am I in any of these with you?
You're making a penis joke.<eos> Is that you're closer now?<eos> God, we're talking about real things here. Adult feelings.<eos> You wouldn't understand, George.<eos> Okay, the perfect Bill Murray binge-watching weekend Has gotta be "Ghostbusters," "Groundhog Day," "Rushmore,"<eos> "Caddyshack," "What About Bob,"<eos> And to end in tears, "Lost In Translation." - I love it!<eos> - Amazing.<eos> I'm telling you, I've seen it a million times.<eos> He says, "I'll always remember these past few days with you."
- Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> Not bad.<eos> Ely!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Naomi, you're here.<eos> You are the hottest.<eos> Way to go awol on me.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You know I'm always ready to dance with you. Come here.
Wait.<eos> Are you sure you didn't leave anything else upstairs?<eos> Like what?<eos> Like your balls to go along with your dick.<eos> Language, Gene Harlow.<eos> Buy your own damn drinks tonight, Ely.<eos> It's time for a changing of the guard.<eos> Come on, Bruce, let's take cutie patootie for a walk.<eos> Are we going out tonight or what?<eos> Have fun with whatever it is you're lying to me about. Because I've changed my mind, Ely, I don't wanna go to a stupid Nyu party with you tonight.
Are we going out tonight or what?<eos> Have fun with whatever it is you're lying to me about. Because I've changed my mind, Ely, I don't wanna go to a stupid Nyu party with you tonight.<eos> Is this about Bruce?<eos> - What's about me?<eos> - Not you, the other Bruce.<eos> - Oh, is he coming with us, too?<eos> - Why don't you ask Ely?<eos> I just thought he was with you when he went upstairs earlier.<eos> Looks like Colonel bastard's upstairs in Ely's bedroom With a candlestick.<eos> Listen, I was always gonna go with you okay?
- It's cutie pie...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Have fun!<eos> Hey, uh, Naomi?<eos> Uh, I think I lost cutie pie.<eos> Wanna play Candyland?<eos> Wow, life in the big city.<eos> Whoa, look at that navel.<eos> Well, where's your other half?<eos> Isn't it like some law that if you're out In the middle of the night, the Ely appendage is with you?
- When did they take her?<eos> - About an hour ago or something.<eos> - Well, listen, I will contact Bess...<eos> - No, no. No. Not Bess.<eos> - She won't help us.<eos> Ask someone else.<eos> - There is no one else.<eos> Bess is our only hope.<eos> Listen, you can't be seen around here like this.<eos> I'm fine, but let me come with you. Let me help her...
- About an hour ago or something.<eos> - Well, listen, I will contact Bess...<eos> - No, no. No. Not Bess.<eos> - She won't help us.<eos> Ask someone else.<eos> - There is no one else.<eos> Bess is our only hope.<eos> Listen, you can't be seen around here like this.<eos> I'm fine, but let me come with you. Let me help her...<eos> - Go home, I'll contact you. Wait there. - I can talk to them.
I prefer to be here? out in the cold. To give up this.<eos> Where are? your daughter now?<eos> You have not help?<eos> I do not want to talk about that.<eos> Okay...<eos> I understand.<eos> It's a tough world.<eos> There is no doubt about it.<eos> Dir you? what friend.<eos> Since you have been so generous to me. Be? honest with you.
- Wait.<eos> Sandra.<eos> - Sandra.<eos> - You want to beat me up?<eos> No.<eos> - Come on, do it!<eos> - I never hit you.<eos> - Leave me alone.<eos> - Sandra, I'm not well.<eos> - I wanted to talk to you.
- Yeah.<eos> - ALS?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's what it's called.<eos> The muscles disappear.<eos> In my whole body.<eos> And when it gets to the diaphragm, well... you just suffocate.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> I saw my daughter.<eos> Did she talk to you?
Herbert, this is how I like you.<eos> Why can't you get out of your skin?<eos> Come on, kiss me.<eos> - Kiss me!<eos> - Marlene, stop it.<eos> Herbert, can you still get an erection with this disease?<eos> - Pull yourself together.<eos> - Maybe you'll be dead soon.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I used to think I could marry you.
A fly?<eos> No, a butterfly.<eos> She got it at the dentist's.<eos> - And? Were you brave?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Go play.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Let me spend some time with her.<eos> And with you.
Hello?<eos> Henry?<eos> Hello, Gemma. Jesus!<eos> You scared the shit out of me!<eos> You wanna tell me what's going on?<eos> Jesus!<eos> What the fuck, Henry?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That was wholly inappropriate and stupid of me.<eos> What's going on with you lately, anyway?
Enjoy.<eos> Okay, good luck with puberty. Bye.<eos> For the start of the annual Halloween parade a long time village tradition.<eos> With a car leading the way families made their way down main street to the heart of the small town.<eos> Their destination was Chestertown Park where the pumpkin carving competition was under way.<eos> The mayor was satisfied by the turnout and excited about this year's event.<eos> Hey, it's Jace.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> Are you on your way? Or should I meet you at the party or something?
I know how you feel, Ethan.<eos> Believe me, I-I do.<eos> Perhaps the best things in this world... require the biggest sacrifice.<eos> Look.<eos> Look at all this beauty around us.<eos> Hector Gaither.<eos> He's on the local radio every night.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Almost all the locals tune in.<eos> When we get to the end of the road, I want you to go left, go home, and I'll see you there in a bit.
I see your partner's already here.<eos> This is Dennis Cooper.<eos> He's been here since day one.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I'm Julia, but everybody calls me Streak.<eos> That's great.<eos> Cooper will take you through the controls.<eos> But I think you'll find the system pretty intuitive once you start using it.<eos> You'll go on patrol once every two hours.<eos> Cooper will communicate with you using this headset.
I told you something's not right.<eos> No, we have company.<eos> - What does he want?<eos> - Probably wants shelter for the night.<eos> - What are we gonna do about it?<eos> - One of us is gonna have to go down there and tell him to scram before he breaks that window.<eos> And I guess that person will be me.<eos> - I didn't realize.<eos> - Save it.<eos> I'm coming with you.
I'm wondering what happens to your memory over time.<eos> I can't remember my family.<eos> I don't remember... Their faces or how they talked.<eos> Last night I was watching Lena while she was asleep. And I was thinking about all the thousands of little things That I'd done for her as her father.<eos> And I'd done them deliberately so that she would remember them When she grows up.<eos> But in time She won't remember a single thing.<eos> Tremendous effort, Mick, you know.<eos> Tremendous effort, Mick. With a modest result.<eos> They're going to talk tonight, mostly.<eos> I will bet you thirty Swiss francs They don't say a word the entire dinner.
He said...<eos> Yes...<eos> She was good in bed.<eos> You didn't have to tell me that.<eos> Believe me, Lena. I can understand you.<eos> Really, I can.<eos> You can understand me?<eos> Like hell you can!<eos> Mommy would've been able to understand me.<eos> Mommy found herself in the same situation I'm in now with you not once, but dozens of times...
Get used to it!<eos> I've already talked to the producer.<eos> Just the question of coming up with another actress and the shooting starts.<eos> Just a matter of waiting a few more months.<eos> What a bitch that Brenda Morel is!<eos> Don't talk like that about Brenda Morel.<eos> - Goes where the wind blows.<eos> - Which is what we all do.<eos> And that's what you all will do In order to survive in this jungle.<eos> It's not true That she came to Europe especially to meet with you, Mick.
It's okay, honestly.<eos> I totally over-reacted. I was really upset.<eos> It's not going to be like this always, you know.<eos> Mike, you're like the strongest, kindest person I've ever met in my whole life.<eos> I fucking love you.<eos> - You're a fucking mess, man.<eos> - Yates!<eos> - For Christ's sake.<eos> Yes, Victoria?<eos> I need to speak with you right now.
Anyone having knowledge of their whereabouts should contact the authorities immediately. Shit, Phoebe. Fuck...<eos> These two animal activist are highly contagious...<eos> That's that lady I was telling you about.<eos> ...and should not be approached under any circumstances.<eos> What?<eos> Officials have indicated that Victoria Lasseteris responsible for the outbreak.<eos> Why the fuck y'all on TV, Mike?<eos> ...Victoria Lasseter's inappropriate close contact with several test monkeys.<eos> Yo, Mike, are you in on this?<eos> You mean, this is the lady that talked to you?
No, no, no.<eos> What is going on?<eos> How do you know...<eos> How do you know what that gas was?<eos> I don't know what's going on. But, listen...<eos> - Baby...<eos> - No. No.<eos> Okay, Mike. Mike. Mike...<eos> Hey... I don't know what's going on.<eos> But I do know what's going on with you, okay.
He's a monkey astronaut.<eos> I made him up.<eos> He goes on adventures.<eos> Hey, Mike, you know Phoebe was supposed to come back in.<eos> When you were in the program, she always looked out for you.<eos> As all the other assets kept failing, you kept succeeding.<eos> She had so much faith in you.<eos> You were real to her.<eos> She was just supposed to get you settled into this town and then she was going to be reassigned.<eos> But she decided to stay with you.
I don't wanna go home yet.<eos> You have to, Sam.<eos> Just one more day.<eos> She's not expecting me yet.<eos> One more day.<eos> Are there friends you can speak to?<eos> Your father?<eos> Your brother, Hal, isn't it?<eos> What is this with me needing to talk to anyone?<eos> Just to know, others are concerned and care about you.
All right, take it easy okay.<eos> Sit down.<eos> We're just talking.<eos> Roy, I'm a police officer.<eos> I'm going to tell you what I'm looking at.<eos> I'm looking at a young man.<eos> Who doesn't speak to his sister.<eos> Doesn't speak to his father.<eos> And is living in an abandoned building.<eos> What's wrong with you?
It's easier to fall into his trap when you don't suspect his existence.<eos> Do you believe the Devil is a real entity...<eos> Lacy?<eos> Lacy?<eos> Lacy?<eos> Lacy?<eos> Kitty-kitty-kitty.<eos> Lacy?<eos> Kitty-kitty-kitty. Come on kitty.<eos> What's wrong with you?
And that your mother killed herself because she couldn't take it anymore.<eos> That's a lie.<eos> You really opened up to George.<eos> And then you guys were sleeping together, right.<eos> I mean, when he told you he would never run away with a minor...<eos> And you saw that your life was going to be like your mothers, you decided to change it.<eos> Why were you crying that day at the seminar?<eos> I already told you why, her father raped her.<eos> No.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second.
But I wonder if Miss Keaton is so sure about me.<eos> It was an order.<eos> They said you were traitors.<eos> That's all I know, I swear.<eos> It was a secure command line.<eos> What was I supposed to do?<eos> Do you believe her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sure your people will come and find you, if you haven't outlived your usefulness.<eos> After all this was over, what did you think they were gonna do with you?
It's another death row case.<eos> The guy's being railroaded.<eos> $1,000 for you.<eos> Cyril.<eos> Webby.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I am loving the digs.<eos> Mike.<eos> It's Justin.<eos> - I'll just sit with you for a minute.
Cyril.<eos> Webby.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I am loving the digs.<eos> Mike.<eos> It's Justin.<eos> - I'll just sit with you for a minute.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jugger.<eos> We're all worried about you, man.
- Same tests as Mike Webster.<eos> - You're paying for that, too?<eos> Yes, Danny, I'm paying for that, too.<eos> Joseph Maroon.<eos> This is my dream.<eos> The schools are good.<eos> You are good, Prema.<eos> I'm sure you see good in me.<eos> I see all that you are.<eos> I want to marry you.
Laughter is a sin around here.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because laughter can mean happiness<eos> And I want you boys to always know<eos> Happiness don't exist for you.<eos> It exists for the privileged, for the loved.<eos> The world outside don't care about you!
Let's change the subject, talk about something else.<eos> Hey, Oscar?<eos> Isn't it funny?<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Listen, you may think everything is a joke.<eos> But me, I take everything seriously.<eos> And I don't appreciate you mocking me.<eos> I wasn't mocking you.
You don't have to be shy, we have plenty of food. More coming out.<eos> No thanks, I'm not hungry.<eos> No?<eos> Give him his freakin' money, let him get out of here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, oh, Frankie, Frankie.<eos> You know, not for nothing, But we offer you food all the time.<eos> And never once, once, do you every sit down and eat with us.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> My gesture of friendship doesn't agree with you?
Oscar, please wait outside.<eos> Alright.<eos> Wow, that was weird.<eos> Alright, go to Jimmy's on 10th street. You know the way.<eos> What the hell is that banana head doing over there?<eos> Pull over, pull over.<eos> Stop.<eos> What the hell is Frank Stone doing in this neighborhood?<eos> Wait up a second, I want to talk to you.<eos> Look, I'm sorry that I spoke to you that way.
Or burn out.<eos> Central B5 requesting an additional unit.<eos> Alright, call it in.<eos> 20 boy central, requesting one addition.<eos> 5 boy 4 by on there?<eos> Paging Dr. Bender.<eos> Paging Dr. Bender, please.<eos> Dr. Bender to the mental ward, please.<eos> How you doing, Frank?<eos> Mind if we talk to you for a minute?
Frank?<eos> How the hell did you get in here?<eos> That letter you wrote me was so beautiful, I cried like a baby.<eos> Like a baby, huh?<eos> Look at me.<eos> I want to ask you one question.<eos> One question.<eos> If I don't like the answer, we're gonna bash your face in.<eos> Frank take you to Coney Island, huh?<eos> Did he do this to you, huh?

Frank!<eos> You feel it, Tony?<eos> That's the feeling of pain and agony<eos> That you cause people out of necessity. I'm an avenging angel, Tony.<eos> This time you hurt the wrong person.<eos> Yeah, I feel better.<eos> I used to be a bit of a partier.<eos> I used to drink too much. A lot of people say to me<eos> "Art, what's a wild night of drinking to you?"<eos> "You look like you've had a few."
Where are you?<eos> Carmichael!<eos> You told me this place was secu re!<eos> Whit!<eos> Whit!<eos> Carmichael!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just wanna talk to you.<eos> I jus t wanna talk to you for a seco n d.
Easy!<eos> Easy! Ea sy! Easy!<eos> I was in the control room.<eos> I wa s on the other side of the roo m.<eos> The ship went down on one side, I was over there talking to yo u, remember?<eos> Daddy loves you to the Milky Wa y.<eos> The long way, not the fucking s hort way, remember?<eos> Remember?<eos> We were talking.<eos> I was talking to you.
Shh.<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> Come on. Come and play, Whit.<eos> One left.<eos> No hard feel ings.<eos> Thought you were winning!<eos> You wanna play?<eos> Medic! Medic!<eos> I'm just fucking with you.
Mm-hm.<eos> Come on. Come and play, Whit.<eos> One left.<eos> No hard feel ings.<eos> Thought you were winning!<eos> You wanna play?<eos> Medic! Medic!<eos> I'm just fucking with you.<eos> You thought you were gonna win.<eos> I'm playing with you, Whit!
How long have you been here?<eos> Forever.<eos> Do you know why they want it so badly? The Pixum?<eos> You ask too many questions, kid.<eos> They kill for it.<eos> We die for it.<eos> End of story.<eos> - Thanks very much.<eos> - Don't thank me.<eos> I don't care about you.
I have this memory thing.<eos> Eidetic memory.<eos> I'm supposed to know what that means?<eos> If I read something or see a picture of something just once... it sticks with me forever, with perfect clarity.<eos> - That's awesome.<eos> - Oh, you think so?<eos> How'd you like to have the menu of IHOP on 23rd and Broadway... dancing around in your head 24/7?<eos> Got it from my father.<eos> He has it.<eos> Bet your dad's pretty pissed at you now, huh?
Billy, you're bleeding.<eos> On your back.<eos> You fell, funny man.<eos> Go to the infirmary.<eos> I tell you what, Dwayne.<eos> I have a job.<eos> So you don't need to send me those checks... that you weren't even sending me anyway.<eos> - How long you been sitting there?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> What's wrong with you?
I don't know.<eos> Feels like I broke something.<eos> Rest.<eos> All right, so the black guys don't talk to the Latino guys.<eos> And the skinheads don't talk to the black guys or the Latino guys.<eos> And nobody talks to the crackers.<eos> - I love clichés.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And nobody but nobody talks to me.<eos> I'll talk to you, Nathan.
Okay.<eos> Fate's a fucking magician.<eos> I'm gonna feel the wind in my face... and the silk of thighs wrapped around my neck... like the wings of angels.<eos> You... are no longer El Gato.<eos> You are now El Poeta.<eos> I see you, El Poeta... in San Francisco in a Kinko's.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's your day job.<eos> But at night, en la noche... you're reading your poetry at Papalote's... while the chicks from Marin... they're swallowing your yarn.<eos> Take me with you.
I can't hear you.<eos> Come down here and tell me.<eos> Crazy, B!<eos> Justin...<eos> Girl, that hurts.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> What, uh...<eos> What's that?<eos> Your father put it there while you were gone.<eos> He does not want to argue with you about it.
We have a hunting cabin?<eos> No, we do not have a hunting cabin.<eos> Max.<eos> Max.<eos> Hey.<eos> He)'-<eos> How'd you get home, buddy?<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> Come on, boy, let's go.<eos> Oh, honey, I feel like I should go in with you.
Stop the truck!<eos> You go after Ray.<eos> Come on, Max!<eos> Max!<eos> Tyler!<eos> Tyler!<eos> Don't you hurt my boy!<eos> This never had to happen.<eos> None of it!<eos> What am I supposed to do with you now, huh?
And here's the man of the hour.<eos> You coming with or waiting here?<eos> We'll take the tour with you.<eos> Loan us a couple pop guns.<eos> All right, this is turning into an all-star affair!<eos> Keith, you want another hand on the exchange?<eos> You sober?<eos> Will be by the time we get there.<eos> Got a bottle in the truck in case your hands get shaky.<eos> I know I could always count on you, Keith.
They're gonna call Manuel back soon.<eos> Isn't that the point?<eos> It's okay, Reg.<eos> I thought he was a friend.<eos> I know.<eos> Want me to stay tonight?<eos> No. I'm good.<eos> You sure?<eos> I'm good.<eos> How y'all want me to talk to you when you keep fucking hitting me?
I'm Dock.<eos> The ship's doctor, perfect.<eos> I am...<eos> They call me Dock, because I used to live under one.<eos> - Nickname. - Right.<eos> Great, like one of the seven dwarves.<eos> Yeah, and they call him Grumpy.<eos> Why would this be in my locker?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> What would a cold fish have to do with you?
What?<eos> This is embarrassing.<eos> I don't even... I'm tellin you, I been on the beach patrol 23 years of my life.<eos> This is fuckin way worse than the lady With a horseshoe crab up her ass.<eos> You're okay, someone's coming, someone's coming.<eos> You're okay, you're okay.<eos> What's her problem?<eos> Well, her fingers got stuck.<eos> Why aren't you helping?<eos> What is wrong with you?
Do that you fucking idiot!<eos> Okay, call your supervisors, whatever.<eos> My supervisor?<eos> I'm the supervisor.<eos> I'm the one in charge.<eos> Oh my god, it's his shoes.<eos> Look at his feet.<eos> You got somethin to say?<eos> No sir.<eos> I wasn't talkin to you blondie, I was talking to your little boyfriend.
There you go.<eos> Hey, look confident.<eos> Not too confident.<eos> Hang on, what are you doing?<eos> You need to invite her in.<eos> That's better.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Ha! Job done.<eos> Alright, mate.<eos> I'll leave you with it, alright?
This might be my undoing as a mayor, but the penguins have always felt special to me.<eos> The one thing Judge Burns loves more than his bike is the law.<eos> When I point out how exposed the entire whale development is on account of being approved before the sanctuary was legally available, he'll walk Oddball on that island himself in his rush for due diligence.<eos> You're a clever egg, aren't you?<eos> I didn't become mayor for nothing.<eos> We'll keep that dog on the island.<eos> But be warned, when they're forced to put their plans on hold, our approval ratings might be in for a bit of a hammering.<eos> Oh, that's my strategic advantage.<eos> - No-one approves of me, anyway.<eos> I don't mind you.
You're thinking some of our friends are just below the surface lying in wait?<eos> It's a distinct possibility.<eos> Well, I don't see any fins.<eos> Oh, it doesn't matter. We could get ten feet out, and they'd be on us before we knew what hit us.<eos> What can we do?<eos> Well, we got a couple options.<eos> We can go back the way we came and choose another path...<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no. Miss me with that crap.<eos> That ain't happening.<eos> Oh, I actually agree with you.
- It's been used for worse.<eos> - Yes, I would do it. Okay?<eos> I would do it in a heartbeat.<eos> Good. Perspiring heavily the whole way, the whole time shoving Certs into my mouth. Exactly.<eos> Freaking out. It would cause me a week of absolute trauma. And, yes, I would do it in a-- in a heartbeat.<eos> Okay? Are you happy?<eos> We got that?<eos> It's on the record. Okay.<eos> Um--<eos> I like talking to you about this stuff.
I don't know. She's--<eos> She's probably sleeping anyway.<eos> Please.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi. How's it going?<eos> It's, uh-- Did I wake you up?<eos> No.<eos> I'm up reading Infinite Jest.<eos> Pretty amazing.<eos> Oh. Good. Listen, I'm here with somebody who wants to talk to you.
There you go.<eos> Okay.<eos> What?<eos> You didn't think to write down where we parked the car?<eos> No. I didn't. Okay?<eos> Sorry. I fucked up.<eos> All right?<eos> I'm a fuckup.<eos> Not everybody can be as brilliant as you.<eos> What is with you?
Okay.<eos> What?<eos> You didn't think to write down where we parked the car?<eos> No. I didn't. Okay?<eos> Sorry. I fucked up.<eos> All right?<eos> I'm a fuckup.<eos> Not everybody can be as brilliant as you.<eos> What is with you?<eos> What the fuck is with you?
And a set, I think, of real convictions about why I'm continuing to do this. Why it's worthwhile. Why it's not just an exercise in getting my dick sucked.<eos> Okay.<eos> - This is such a clever tactic on your part.<eos> - Tactic? What tactic?<eos> That's right.<eos> Get me a little pissed off, get me a little less guarded-- I'm gonna reveal more.<eos> Yes, it's true.<eos> - I treasure my regular guyness. - Mm-hmm.<eos> I've come to think that maybe it's my biggest asset as a writer. That I'm basically just like everybody else.<eos> You know what? I'm not doing any kind of faux thing with you.
Can you hold this?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey.<eos> Yes, I would like to, um--<eos> I can't right now.<eos> I got this guy here.<eos> Whatguy?<eos> RollingStoneguy, yeah.<eos> You know, can I just meet you there?
What- - What is it?<eos> It's just an old Civic.<eos> I know it doesn't look like much. But, man, this thing starts.<eos> It's actually a problem.<eos> Why is that a problem?<eos> I gotta get a new one, but I can't junk this.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's my friend.<eos> Hey, David. I, uh--<eos> Wow. Just happened to have one on you, huh? Yeah.
Thanks. Be interesting to be inside your head for a while.<eos> I like your cover.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> I actually had them use the same art for the British edition.<eos> Come on. You got approval, and I d--<eos> It's nice. It's very nice.<eos> Don't worry about it. It was not such a-- not such a big success.<eos> Hey, isn't it at all reassuring to have a lot of people read you... and, you know, say that you're a really strong writer?<eos> It'll be interesting to talk to you in a few years.
No. No.<eos> What if someone...<eos> We can't!<eos> We won't.<eos> Not unless we have to.<eos> If I want to eat my french fries on the way home, I'm gonna.<eos> No.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I guess I'll get my Tina on.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
If you want to talk to them, we'll talk to them.<eos> If we get a name for that cop, I'll leave the tip.<eos> But it's all you.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> You think they're going home?<eos> Yeah! Hey, bro.<eos> I'm whupping the shit out this motherfucking game, dawg.<eos> Ain't nobody fucking with me.<eos> I'm about to get the last cherry and shit.<eos> Hey, I know he been talking to you, boy.
Oh, you do?<eos> Is that all?<eos> I mean, that's why you came all the way down here for?<eos> Nah. Nah, you see?<eos> There's something you ain't telling me.<eos> You know something about who shot Donelle, bitch?<eos> Who's Donelle to you?<eos> - Answer the motherfucking question.<eos> - You first.<eos> - What the fuck is wrong with you, bro?
You don't need to sell it Minnie, you need to make it.<eos> And you need to get your ass out there and help Charly with them bags and get Ed in here.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> -But fix that coffee.<eos> -I'll fix you!<eos> I don't know, some old man.<eos> Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to do about it.<eos> I'm just telling you what she said.<eos> Anyway, she sent me out here to help Charly.<eos> She wants to talk to you.
I think I saw a woman with a limp.<eos> It's just a sprained ankle.<eos> She'll be walking normally again in a few days.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> That is a shame indeed.<eos> One night on the coach, he sat next to the woman who liked butter biscuits.<eos> He gazed out of the window, not looking at anything in particular, just trying to avoid talking to her.<eos> - How's Bob?<eos> - He's fine.<eos> I'd give anything to go for a walk with you and Bob one afternoon.
The colour is OK, though.<eos> The most important thing is that you're not bald.<eos> However, when it comes to men, baldness is always a possibility you can't avoid.<eos> - Is your father bald?<eos> - No, he isn't.<eos> And even if someday I lose my hair, there are things I can do to get my hair back.<eos> I can have a hair transplant.<eos> - You can always tell when someone's had a hair transplant.<eos> Nice hair is not something you can get.<eos> It's something you're born with.
Have you decided what you're going to do on your last day?<eos> I'm still thinking about it.<eos> Morning, ladies.<eos> So today is your last day.<eos> And as is customary, you can choose how you would like to spend your last night.<eos> What I always say in these situations is, it would be wise to choose something you can't do as an animal... for example, read a work of classic literature or sing a song you really like.<eos> It would be silly to choose for example a walk in the grounds, or to have sexual intercourse with another person, because those are things you can do as an animal.<eos> But first your best friend has written something she'd like to read to you, which is really very touching.<eos> "We always sat together at school.<eos> And whenever I had a problem, I talked to you about it because you always gave the best advice.
Would you like me to show you my belly?<eos> No.<eos> I, I remember your belly very well.<eos> Smile.<eos> Can I have a knife and fork, please?<eos> Not a butter knife, a steak knife.<eos> Certainly.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm going to do it with a knife.<eos> Do you want me to come with you?
Honey, that was a bad dream.<eos> You were having a nightmare.<eos> No.<eos> First, I had the nightmare, then I woke up and saw the monster.<eos> You said so yourself that before, there were monsters that killed mom.<eos> And all those monsters have died from the cold.<eos> And they didn't look like Ramble.<eos> If they all died... then why do you keep so many locks on the door?<eos> You never let me go out.<eos> Not even to get food with you from the other houses.
Look.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry for everything that's happened.<eos> It's not my forgiveness you need.<eos> What...?<eos> Lu, sweetie, for once in your life, just obey Daddy.<eos> I need you to go downstairs.<eos> Listen to me. Lu, listen to me.<eos> Daddy needs to help get the monsters out of the house.<eos> I can't do that if I don't know you're safe.
Come on, Faye, you can do it.<eos> There we go.<eos> There we go.<eos> Come on.<eos> That's it. That's it, baby girl.<eos> You see?<eos> You see?<eos> You're only a few feet from the glass.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> Nothing bad is going to happen to you.
What?<eos> The case I'm working on, it's going to trial, and they want me to lead the trial team.<eos> That's great.<eos> Yeah, it's a great opportunity for me, especially if I want to make partner.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What aren't you telling me?<eos> Well, the trial would be held at the downtown courthouse.<eos> If I take the case, I can't come home every night.<eos> And leave me here by myself?<eos> No, we can get Stephanie to stay with you.
I didn't see anything.<eos> I just heard her screaming, and I found her that way.<eos> Sorry, I had to call someone to come stay with her tomorrow.<eos> Is there gonna be any sort of investigation?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> It appears to be an accident.<eos> All right, we're done here.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I talked to your aunt, and she said she'd come to stay with you tomorrow.
Why won't you talk to me about her?<eos> I don't want to cause you any more pain.<eos> I'm so tired of everyone treating me like I'm some sort of emotional cripple.<eos> Fine, what do you want to know?<eos> What happened between them?<eos> I've already told you how she suffered from depression for many years.<eos> Your father worked long hours and stayed away.<eos> That just drove her deeper and deeper into her depression.<eos> What happened on the day that she left?<eos> She showed up at my house and asked me to watch you for a couple of hours.
If she says she saw something, I believe her.<eos> Let's see what Dr. Murphy and Tom believe.<eos> Doc, is it possible that one of the medications that you prescribed Faye is causing her to have these hallucinations?<eos> Hallucinations are not a side effect of that drug.<eos> However, paranoia is a classic symptom of underlying panic disorder.<eos> But she's never been paranoid before.<eos> It's obviously a new symptom.<eos> So she's getting worse instead of getting better?<eos> Stop talking about me like I'm not in this room.<eos> Faye, everybody in this room cares about you.
All he had to do was... act like a courier so he could meet you.<eos> You know, I really do think he fell for you.<eos> So you see... you beat me again.<eos> Faye?<eos> Faye... it wasn't supposed to happen like this.<eos> You were supposed to just go get the help you needed.<eos> I offered you all my money.<eos> Don't think I didn't consider it.<eos> It was certainly a lot less work than all this.<eos> It would mean being cooped up in here with you for the rest of my life.
Love is messy.<eos> It's illogical, it's wasteful and it's messy.<eos> And it leaves these loose threads that go out all over the place.<eos> But you, you like things nice and neat and tidy and ethical.<eos> But you screwed that up the minute you got with a married man.<eos> You're not being my friend right now.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I am being your friend.<eos> This is being your friend.<eos> I'm being honest with you.
Didn't you tell me to block it out?<eos> I told you do it by the book.<eos> Cut the bullshit.<eos> Nobody else could have stopped that arcade machine and you know it.<eos> Oh man, listen to me Kung Fury.<eos> You need to start following the rules like the rest of us, so I'm assigning you a new partner. What?<eos> Hell no, I work alone.<eos> Not anymore you don't.<eos> Say hi to your new partner, Triceracop.<eos> Very nice meeting you Kung Fury, looking forward to working with you.
I thought they went extinct thousands of years ago.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name, is Barbarianna.<eos> What year is this?<eos> It's the Viking age.<eos> That explains the Laser-Raptor.<eos> Fuck! I went too far back in time.<eos> You need to get out of this valley.<eos> This place is swarming with Laser-Raptors.<eos> I'll meet you at the God's drop.
Our lives in the Highlands are steeped in tradition, custom, and ritual.<eos> So I've seen.<eos> And Colum chose to risk looking weak, publicly changing his position, because peace was more important than custom.<eos> I saw a rigid man bend.<eos> It made me mindful.<eos> About what?<eos> Wives obey their husbands.<eos> Husbands discipline them when they don't.<eos> Now, that's how it was with my father and his father on and on and on, back.<eos> But maybe for you and me it has to go a different way.
We owe this to Teela.<eos> We owe this to Teela?<eos> Well last I checked Teela's goddess owes us.<eos> However ...<eos> A hidden treasure of legendary proportions, unguarded ... and there for the taking.<eos> I could ... I mean ... We all could be rich.<eos> Fuck the treasure.<eos> - Fuck the treasure?<eos> Look ...<eos> I didn't have to share this with you.
That you blame for Caeryn's death.<eos> - That was not what I was going to say.<eos> It's true.<eos> And you're right.<eos> I'm a necromancer and I can't control it.<eos> And if the Darkspore is in there and I touch it, Kishkumen will see.<eos> Look, there's something drawing me towards it and it's growing stronger.<eos> I do not know if I can resist it.<eos> We have come all this way.<eos> - I'm not going in with you.
As if it were still dawn ?<eos> Can he still catch up?<eos> Let me get into the horse's head.<eos> The truth, honorable Secretaries, is that what has already been ruined, our founding disillusion,<eos> is our freedom.<eos> We won!<eos> You must have nothing to lose to love heart and soul.<eos> You must eclipse the giddiest heights to dare to plunge headlong.<eos> You must endure the fall of empires and the greatest storms to be together in that moment.<eos> You must have lived, you must have lost, o i/er and again, to triumph with you.
What's the plan?<eos> There's a superb boat that picks you up at the dock down there, if you call them.<eos> I found a merry, muscular sailor with bulging biceps for you.<eos> You'll come with?<eos> No. Today, we're going to see Agnes.<eos> We're going to introduce Simbad to Agnes today.<eos> "We're going"?<eos> She's not coming?<eos> Don't worry, I'll drive down, meet her... - And you...<eos> - I'll come with you.
My tranquilizers.<eos> He's the dopehead and you're on a cure? Of tranquilizers?<eos> Look, this is how you eat it.<eos> You're jealous?<eos> - No.<eos> - As if!<eos> I saw those jealous eyes.<eos> You think I'd steal your man?<eos> I don't steal other people's men.<eos> Look at me, I'm talking to you.
I mean, we have lakes.<eos> Here the weather's always good and there's just so much stuff to do.<eos> I've been thinking about making the... the move... the move out west.<eos> I just need a change and...<eos> I really need to expand my business.<eos> What do you do?<eos> I wholesale bounce houses.<eos> Ah. That'd be fun, right?<eos> I mean, no pressure.<eos> I'm just thinking about spending more time with my niece and nephew, and... you, of course.
Well, look, he is your brother.<eos> You're more like a brother to me than he is. No, that's exactly how I feel about you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay. Heh.<eos> I need my feet scraped!<eos> Oh, for the love of God.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Hold up.<eos> What?<eos> Take me with you.
I'm sure they have Internet here, right?<eos> Let's go to the house.<eos> How do we know he's even living there?<eos> How do we know he's not?<eos> B, we gotta start somewhere. You know?<eos> Let's split up. Is that okay?<eos> Is that okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Are you guys, like, 5?<eos> Yeah. And I could go with you, Beatrix.
Melissa. Melissa, please.<eos> Come on.<eos> You and I are about to have a lot of fun.<eos> Come on, girl. Come on.<eos> - Help!<eos> Help me!<eos> - Come on, let's have it.<eos> - Please help me!<eos> - Come on, honey. That's the spirit.<eos> What should we do with you tonight, huh?
You didn't have proper authorization to go in there.<eos> I had a warrant.<eos> Is that not authorization?<eos> Look, you know as well as I do that you could have got him upon exit.<eos> But no, you had to go in there and cause a big scene.<eos> Julian Michaels and that resort provides half the tax revenue that keeps this city going.<eos> And in return...<eos> In return we show him a little cooperation. Come on, Roy.<eos> This isn't the first time.<eos> What is it with you and that place?
I'm not gonna lie to you, this is gonna hurt like hell.<eos> - Come here.<eos> Get off me!<eos> Stop.<eos> Oh, the life you've lived.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Easy.<eos> - Make it stop.<eos> - Easy.<eos> - Take her with you.
You would never think of... Ugh.<eos> No.<eos> Not that.<eos> Hi, Carmen.<eos> Hey, Michael.<eos> What up, DeeDee?<eos> What's up, Michael?<eos> Nothing, girl.<eos> You got a man, yet?<eos> My brother's been jerking off to you...
That's weird, man.<eos> It's a job interview!<eos> All right.<eos> Forget it. A job is a job.<eos> We go by there tomorrow then.<eos> No, no.<eos> He said to come through tonight. 11:00.<eos> I can't believe that Mom let you borrow the car. (INDISTINCT CHATTER)<eos> She didn't. What?<eos> I'm messing with you, man.
The guy right there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's Princeton.<eos> Princeton.<eos> Princeton dress like Prince.<eos> Hey, I see you made it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is my brother, Chris, right here.<eos> What up?<eos> So, I wanted to talk to you about that job opportunity.
Don't "Mom" me.<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> I love you.<eos> At least you got some damn sense.<eos> Do me a favor, don't be leaving these laying around my house.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I could've managed Akon but I felt like my brother needed me more, you know what I mean?<eos> MICHAEL: Chris, let's go.<eos> Yo, you a bona fide star here, man.<eos> Magic Mike ain't got nothing on you!
Where do you work?<eos> I don't work. I'm a student.<eos> Student?<eos> Maybe you should learn about this right here.<eos> Get you in free, so bring your girlfriends, check out some more Sexy Chocolate.<eos> Cool.<eos> All right.<eos> I like free.<eos> I like you.<eos> You know that I love spending time with you over everything else.
This place is out of control.<eos> Hey, Ma.<eos> Hey, son.<eos> What're you still doing up?<eos> (EXHALES LOUDLY) I couldn't sleep.<eos> So, I decided to make some hot chocolate and clip some coupons.<eos> You want some?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Hey, Ma, I got something I got to tell you.<eos> I haven't been entirely honest with you.
This is what happened when you turned up here tonight and found them both here together.<eos> Her pimp, an undercover police officer shot dead with your gun.<eos> Now walk away and I'll give you 24 hours before I turn over all this evidence - to the local precinct.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> Your choice.<eos> Walk away and live, stay and you die, she dies, everybody dies.<eos> Listen my client wishes for less mess and bloodshed but it really makes no difference to me, so what's it going to be?<eos> Here's your choice...<eos> You're going to tell me where my kidney is.<eos> I'll make it quick for you.
I had forgotten something very important. I'd forgotten to nail shut the coffin.<eos> Actually, there was no coffin. It was the crate holding the walk cable.<eos> But, in my mind, I had changed this crate into a coffin.<eos> Philippe!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're waking up the whole neighborhood.<eos> Well, I forgot to nail shut the coffin.<eos> Stop calling it that!<eos> A coffin is what this may be.<eos> That's not funny. What's wrong with you?
Hello.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Enjoy! Bye-bye!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Where were you?<eos> The damn train was late.<eos> At what time did you leave?<eos> I didn't see you.<eos> Around 5am because I had yoga class<eos> What's wrong with you?
That's it.<eos> Ana! I don't want to go to any party;<eos> I want to go back home now.<eos> Is it still the same problem?<eos> I thought we were going to talk, and like an idiot, I fell for another one of your games.<eos> My games?<eos> Yes, your games!<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> I don't need anything to be happy<eos> I'm happy with just you.
Cheri did something awful to them, that's why she left town.<eos> Rose, you can't bring her back.<eos> No, but I can at least try to figure out what happened to her.<eos> That's not who I'm talking about.<eos> You suffered a major loss, it's your mom.<eos> There's nothing worse than that.<eos> Your pain, it's starting to come out in other ways.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> You sound just like my dad.<eos> Why, 'cause I'm worried about you?
What was that noise?<eos> What was that?<eos> You don't hear that?<eos> I didn't hear anything.<eos> - Don't mind me.<eos> - Don't move.<eos> I've got a cold, don't come in!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Got me all worked up and sweaty.<eos> Bro, can you take me with you?
How about Japanese civilians?<eos> All civilians are innocent.<eos> Act like the bullets have eyes.<eos> Then, how about taking a photo?<eos> For the historical record.<eos> Comrade Ahn, you can change clothes.<eos> Okay.<eos> We can't fight on an empty stomach<eos> Captain Yem said you would cover our compensation.<eos> What's with you?
My family is very rich. What the... what is wrong with you?<eos> What's your problem, man?<eos> Where your family got that money?<eos> This is my family business.<eos> Is not your business.<eos> Your family business is a problem, but, your mouth is even a bigger problem.<eos> You're kind of a liability.<eos> And do you think this is about me?<eos> Get out of here, man.<eos> No-no-no, it's not about you.
You look better with long hair.<eos> I see you thought about me a lot.<eos> When you have one aim in life, - you devote time to it.<eos> - Don't worry,<eos> I'm here to take you to a smaller, dirtier prison.<eos> You'll have the next 20 years to plaster your cell with sketches.<eos> You know what's a shame?<eos> They're closing the GP.<eos> It seems you're no longer necessary.<eos> So many years fighting criminals like me... - and budget cuts get you.
Goddamn mask!<eos> What with the bazooka, it slipped our minds.<eos> The Butcher and the Molecule.<eos> I see you still get the top men.<eos> What was your catchphrase?<eos> "Anacleto never fails"?<eos> It doesn't seem very accurate now, does it?<eos> It doesn't look like your plan worked out either.<eos> You don't know my plan yet.<eos> - It's to kill you and your son!
And when we watch TV series?<eos> We get under the blankets, with some pizzas... it's great.<eos> But I don't want to live on a couch.<eos> - No.<eos> - And you know it.<eos> Yes.<eos> I got myself a ticket to India.<eos> Jesus!<eos> I got into World Doctors again, and this time I'm sorry, but... - I'm no waiting for you to decide.<eos> - I was coming with you.
- I don't know, he's yours.<eos> Sapristi!<eos> Sapristi!<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Get down!<eos> Sapristi...<eos> We have to go now and forget the farm forever.<eos> I will forget it, but I'm not going with you,
I fulfilled my part of the plan.<eos> C'mon, the briefcase.<eos> Jeez, what a pain!<eos> From now on, you're on your own.<eos> What is this crap?<eos> When I was in prison my henchmen invested all the money in that stamp scam, Forum.<eos> But they'll go up in value. In a few years you'll be a millionaire... almost for sure.<eos> Or in a few months.<eos> No excuses.<eos> You have 24 hours to get the money, or I'll use all my resources to put an end to you.
This is going to be hard to believe, but my father... is a secret agent.<eos> Please.<eos> Whatcha doin'? !<eos> You comin' in or not? !<eos> No, Mom, we're going to my room...<eos> - ...to talk!<eos> - "Talk", she says.<eos> They're gonna have sex.<eos> Here, in your house, the day of her farewell. And before dessert.<eos> You're jealous because he's not here to see you.
- It doesn't matter.<eos> - Yes, it does.<eos> I just wanted to protect you from all this.<eos> That's why I pretended to be a sausage maker.<eos> Well, I always liked the sausages.<eos> Especially the cured pork.<eos> Your mother's were better.<eos> I would've liked to know about Mom before too.<eos> When she died, I couldn't handle it.<eos> That's why I was hard on you, insulting you, laughing at you to make you stronger.
Katia, we have to talk.<eos> Whenever you want.<eos> - Right now, in the car.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Can you give me a lift?<eos> All this has opened my eyes, I have to make the leap.<eos> You know what I did today?<eos> You'll freak.<eos> I signed up for driving lessons.<eos> And I'm coming to India with you. Or wherever.
So we're not going to India?<eos> You were looking forward to it.<eos> Not now, and I feel terrible.<eos> I postponed it, I need some time at home.<eos> Okay.<eos> What about us?<eos> There is no "us", Adolfo.<eos> Now I need a normal boyfriend, no nasty surprises.<eos> Just quiet dinners on Saturday on the sofa, a blanket, a DVD and...<eos> I see that now it's impossible with you.
Now he's just a "fucking gringo"?<eos> I left.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Everything is all right.<eos> A soldier never hides when family and friends are dying!<eos> Hailey!<eos> Mom!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Are you all right, sweetheart?<eos> I was so worried about you.
You got any idea the shit storm that's gonna rain down on us now?<eos> I had to do somethin', Walt.<eos> For all I knew you were in hiding and you were never comin' back.<eos> And who could blame you, after you screwed over the people that you did?<eos> What are you talkin' about?<eos> I had everything under control.<eos> You can't even control your own five senses.<eos> Get in the car!<eos> We're leavin'.<eos> They're not goin' anywhere with you.
Stay back here, keep your heads down. All right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Colt, it's Jasper Calloway.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> Now... we know you're in there.<eos> We just wanna talk.<eos> Come on, Colt.<eos> Come out with your hands up and nobody else has to get hurt, including you!<eos> Colt, this is your final warning.<eos> I'm comin' to you as a friend.
- That's not necessary.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Stay.<eos> Please. Rest for a while.<eos> Talking to your father is like talking to a rock.<eos> He's so busy with his little things, the shape of a drop of dew, the sound roots make breaking their way through the ground.<eos> Everything matters more to him than you.<eos> No.<eos> My father loves me.<eos> He is amused by you.
Action over words.<eos> Always.<eos> Otherwise, silence.<eos> You think you are his only child?<eos> There are others.<eos> No.<eos> There is only me.<eos> There is only me.<eos> Look in on your mother.<eos> Did the boy speak with you when you went to the water?
It's stunning, isn't it?<eos> That life ends.<eos> You will meet again.<eos> We will have been here together.<eos> And we leave the boy behind.<eos> That'll have to do.<eos> How far can a man walk into the desert?<eos> Only halfway.<eos> After that, he's walking out.<eos> When you leave, you could take me with you.
Send him in.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> The president is ready to see you now.<eos> Doug.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> The doctor told me your recovery is going very well. Yeah.<eos> Well, there's this.<eos> But everything else is as good as new.<eos> It's great to see you.<eos> Claire and I have been worried sick about you.
Francis?<eos> When do we announce the nomination?<eos> Listen, I wasn't gonna bring this up tonight, but you should know that there are some serious doubts from people at the State Department.<eos> You mean Cathy.<eos> And some on her staff.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, in over your head, wearing two hats, the obvious things.<eos> And are you saying this because you don't want to move forward?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm sharing with you so you fully understand - what you're getting into.
You think that Ethan is...<eos> I don't know, but I can't rule it out.<eos> Theresa, you know Hassler. He is nothing if not a straight shooter.<eos> How much of this have you told Ethan?<eos> I haven't, and I'm not sure it's a good idea to.<eos> I really have to go.<eos> You're a good person, Theresa.<eos> And I wish we had met under different circumstances.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Ethan, we're worried about you.
It's Landis.<eos> So, you are Landis.<eos> Mommy!<eos> Quiet.<eos> That was" that was your daughter, wasn't it'?<eos> You were setting a bad example as a parent.<eos> You were going to let all these people die.<eos> I love you!<eos> Quiet!<eos> I'm disappointed in you.
Who the fuck are you'?<eos> Just talk away, man.<eos> Look at you, you filthy bitch.<eos> Who the fuck are you coming around here?<eos> Fuck off my corner, bitch.<eos> Now, that was pretty sneaky.<eos> Hey, nobody touches my pimp.<eos> Jesus Chris t!<eos> Bitch.<eos> What the fuck is the matter with you'?
Ten minutes.<eos> Bro, I think I'm going to need a little longer than 10 minutes.<eos> Come on, bro, for real, 10 minutes.<eos> Oh. See you enjoying yourself.<eos> All right.<eos> Hold up, baby, business.<eos> Hey, chill.<eos> What the fuck you cops doing here?<eos> Ain't you see we was having a conversation?<eos> I'm looking for a piece of shit, and he looks just like you, asshole.
Don't you go anywhere.<eos> Clear!<eos> Clear!<eos> Clear!<eos> Place is empty.<eos> We're too late.<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Hey, yeah, I just got away from the officer.<eos> I'm on my way to you.
Ladies and gentlemen, I need your attention.<eos> I need you to evacuate the building immediately.<eos> This is not a drill.<eos> There's a bomb in the building.<eos> Please do not panic.<eos> Just exit as quickly as possible.<eos> Let's go, let's go, all of you, please.<eos> Out of the building. Right away.<eos> What the fuck is going on, Mike?<eos> What the fuck is the matter with you'?
Get your big head out of the shot.<eos> Your head is in the shot.<eos> - Clear out, please. - Dude, move!<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Gabrielle, over here.<eos> - Gabby, Gabby, good.<eos> - This is Alex Pappas!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> This woman wants to talk to you.
- Yes!<eos> Get your shit together. Come on.<eos> Yeah, okay, okay, okay.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> Oh!<eos> Bob!<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - It's great to see you.<eos> Great to see you.<eos> I got this movie thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Bob!<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - It's great to see you.<eos> Great to see you.<eos> I got this movie thing I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> I'm not gonna touch movies.<eos> The last one I had was a $200 million indie.<eos> - I think I lost money.<eos> - I can't argue with you there.<eos> You know, I got this TV thing I wanted to talk to you about it.
Man, I'm just trying to, like, apologize to you.<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> Get the fuck out of here!<eos> Sorry, guys.<eos> I was just joking.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> - You know, I'm just kidding. - Okay, I got it.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> I'm fucking with you.
It's just so dead over here.<eos> Nobody goes out.<eos> You should come over more often.<eos> I slept over almost every night this week.<eos> Sally loves it when you sleep over.<eos> Oh, do you?<eos> She loves a good nose.<eos> Is that my brother-in-law?<eos> What is he doing?<eos> I'll meet you up at the field, okay?
We had that time set aside to talk about our problems.<eos> We talked about it more in the car.<eos> We got very very sad.<eos> And then we decided, "Let's have a fun day.<eos> Let's make the rest of the day fun." - Kick the can!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm doing it!<eos> Whats you expect?<eos> I want you to have fun.<eos> I want to fun with you. - I can't.
Get in there.<eos> I know you're in here.<eos> Oh my god.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> She saw me.<eos> We're fucked.<eos> What a sucker.<eos> She's gone.<eos> What's wrong with you?
What's my deal?<eos> It's actually your deal.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your deal is that you only call when you need something.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> When's the last time you called just to check in or to hang out?<eos> We talk all the time.<eos> Alex...<eos> You know what, I'm not gonna argue with you.
Those are his words.<eos> He said, "That was a freak, drunk thing." Yeah, right.<eos> Well, he would say that, 'cause he's embarrassed.<eos> Well, what am I supposed to do with him?<eos> He's so high-maintenance.<eos> He's like a girl.<eos> I do think that you could be a little more careful with the people in your life who really matter to you.<eos> What... What is this?<eos> Are you... You're mad at me too?<eos> I'm not mad at you, but...
Your toilet's clogged with a monster shit.<eos> No.<eos> Larry wants to give you a part in his movie.<eos> - What?<eos> - And it's a big role.<eos> Shoots in New Orleans.<eos> Umm... why?<eos> What do you mean, "Why?" Because he likes you.<eos> He hasn't even seen me act.<eos> But he's confident you can do it just based on the... the times he's hung out with you.
Of course.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I just want to be me.<eos> I don't want to be Brett.<eos> I want to be me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I think that's a great idea.<eos> For the moment, just... maybe you should just sneak in the front door, go to your room, and just take a nap.<eos> You're worried about me. I...<eos> Why would I be worried about you?
I...<eos> I, uh, drank Scott's tea.<eos> - Mushrooms.<eos> Oh, you took mushrooms? Yeah.<eos> Okay, so you just decided to show up to my party, which you know means a lot to me, on a mushroom...<eos> - A mushroom trip?<eos> It was not something I planned on, it just happened.<eos> It was a happy accident and I'm enjoying myself.<eos> I tried something new and I like it.<eos> What is going on with you?
It isn't easy.<eos> These are terrible.<eos> Anyway...<eos> I'm leaving you now.<eos> - This afternoon we'll dive again? - You bet.<eos> Yorgos...<eos> Your glasses.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Will you dive again later? - Yes.<eos> Can I come with you?
People are fucking in here!<eos> Zero, 11!<eos> Now, take a dump.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, guys! Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Hey, Ethan.<eos> We need to get the fuck out of here. I'm losing my shit right now.<eos> What happened?<eos> Please. I wanna go right now.<eos> - I'm right behind you.
You guys can take it down to the homeless shelter.<eos> It's only a few blocks away.<eos> I'm sure they'd appreciate it.<eos> You're right, Mom.<eos> You boys are so sweet.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> - Wanna help me in the kitchen? - Okay.<eos> Thanks so much for dinner, Mrs. Roberts.<eos> You're welcome, sweetheart!<eos> Dude, what the fuck is going on with you?
It's incredibly sensitive.<eos> Wow, what's on the phone?<eos> You don't need to know.<eos> How's the party?<eos> Is it as dumb as you thought it'd be?<eos> Actually, it's kind of amazing.<eos> It's really fun... and you should get here.<eos> Quickly. What?<eos> Really?<eos> You want me to come there? To see you?
- Okay.<eos> - All right. - Okay.<eos> Oh, my fucking God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God! This is the greatest night of our lives!<eos> - That was crazy.<eos> - That's so crazy, right?<eos> Listen, I'm sorry about the ring. I'll get you a ring, I promise.<eos> We can do that tomorrow.<eos> No, Ethan, I'm not going to marry you.
- No! Stop congratulating me!<eos> - What? What happened?<eos> Just go talk to Ethan.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm sorry! I'm sorry!<eos> I think he's gonna be fine.<eos> Please, punch him in the face!<eos> I thought the Messiah preached forgiveness!<eos> Look at me, asshole.<eos> What the fuck wrong with you?
Thank God. I'm so sorry.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I made a mistake. I made a huge mistake.<eos> I called you.<eos> - I switched phones with Sarah.<eos> - From work?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> It doesn't matter. I just need to tell you something. Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna come clean with you.
- Are you laughing?<eos> - This is hilarious.<eos> - Cunt!<eos> - Did you just call our baby a cunt?<eos> I forgot about that.<eos> Okay, I can't watch anymore.<eos> But honestly, I'm a little relieved.<eos> - You are?<eos> - Are you kidding me!<eos> I feel like such a dumb asshole compared to you sometimes.
Fuck that park. It got crackheads.<eos> Say the grace, boy.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Heavenly Father, thank you for this food we're about to receive. Thank you for my momma.<eos> Thank you for my friends and their families.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Really?<eos> Are you gonna propose to me again? - No.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> I just wanted to talk to you.
What?<eos> First of all, I'm sorry about last night.<eos> - I know that was stupid.<eos> And it was totally crazy that I wouldn't meet your parents. That was just me being really....<eos> Yeah. I agree with that.<eos> But I guess I was...<eos> I don't know, scared... because Chris and Isaac have been my family for the last 10 years... so I didn't wanna meet your family... because that would change everything.<eos> But everything changes, right?<eos> We all grow up... and that's a good thing, I wanna grow up.<eos> I wanna grow up with you.
But one day your voice will come.<eos> Oh, you like to read.<eos> "Brothers of the Wind"<eos> Sunlight!<eos> Essential to develop his feathers.<eos> Hey! Where are you going?<eos> Did you forget our capercaillie?<eos> Come on!<eos> Hey, Lukas!<eos> I'm talking to you!
I'd advise you to get out of there now.<eos> Okay then.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> My mom's just been ill recently, and, um...<eos> Yeah, I... I hate to do this, I just... I have to get going.<eos> I can't say I'm not disappointed.<eos> Look, I'm headed out of town over the weekend.<eos> I want more of you before I go.
Yeah, that grey area where you like to work between us and the bad guys?<eos> It can get real foggy down there.<eos> I'd hate for you to lose your way.<eos> I'll keep my eyes open.<eos> I know the police failed to find your sister.<eos> And for that, I am truly sorry.<eos> But, I can make it up to you.<eos> My department can give you the access and resources to help people.<eos> Help yourself, and find your sister.<eos> Everyone wants to play with you, Lindy.
That's Sophia for you.<eos> One of the kindest girls I know.<eos> She loves to pick up strays.<eos> (Laughs) I'm serious!<eos> It was like a past life thing.<eos> And then, she told me she just got into town.<eos> Don't ask me why, but I insisted she stay with me.<eos> (Chuckles) And I've never left.<eos> Is there a past life thing between us, too?<eos> Oh, sweetie, you are plenty to handle in the day to day.
No, trying to get a signal.<eos> Okay, well, I'd prefer if you sit over there. S-sure.<eos> Just trying to give Lindy and Sophia some space.<eos> Well, room's pretty big.<eos> I'd say there's plenty of space.<eos> That's quite some view.<eos> You must spend a lot of nights here alone.<eos> What a shame.<eos> Are you trying to flirt with me?<eos> Would you like me to flirt with you?
I didn't get a chance to wrap it.<eos> "How to Cook and Have a Life"?<eos> Yeah, it's just a bunch of take-out menus from all my favorite places in the city.<eos> That's, um... that's really creative.<eos> Look, I'm sorry we haven't had much time to see each other, but work's been a nightmare lately.<eos> But I'm glad Sophia invited me.<eos> Me too.<eos> What?<eos> You can't just ignore my calls, Sophia.<eos> I'm mad at you, Connor.
Not a good thing.<eos> You wanna talk about it?<eos> It's nothing to worry about.<eos> Why don't I believe you?<eos> Believe me.<eos> And look, as far as this goes, I don't want you to get your hopes up.<eos> It's unlikely he'll show.<eos> It just feels good that we're actually doing something.<eos> Here.<eos> I wanna be able to talk to you wherever you are, okay?
Someone's blocking the signal.<eos> (Phone chirping)<eos> Thanks.<eos> One club soda.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm helping Sophia throw this thing, I need to keep my wits about me.<eos> I know all this has been crazy, but I hope this clears things up, and that maybe we could start again.<eos> Things are a little upside-down for me right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> This has nothing to do with you, honestly.
Hey, beautiful. Help me make ten-grand, those shoes look tasty.<eos> Yeah, sorry, I've got really big feet.<eos> I can handle it.<eos> - Okay, really?<eos> - All right, easy, man, easy!<eos> - Back off! God, what a creep.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This is getting out of hand.<eos> I need to find Tommy.<eos> Take her to the security office, I'll meet you there.
The party's on lockdown, no one goes in or out.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> This isn't the Flirtual killer doing this.<eos> Then who?<eos> Bubonic.<eos> Wow, it's hot in here.<eos> Over there.<eos> (Thud, dragging) Jake?<eos> Jake?<eos> When did he contact you?
- I did, didn't I?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Hang on a sec.<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, no, that sucks.<eos> No, seriously, it's okay.<eos> Really, don't worry about it.<eos> I'll cancel the reservation.<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll talk to you tomorrow.
They die so quick.<eos> Cactuses are hard to kill.<eos> Say hello to big vad.<eos> Hooked me up to this ticker four days ago.<eos> It's the only thing keeping me alive.<eos> It's freaky, huh?<eos> It's tough.<eos> You never really appreciate how vulnerable you are until something like this hits you.<eos> How could you?<eos> What's going on with you?
Why is your fiance getting a lumbar puncture?<eos> - Uh, neurosyphilis.<eos> - Wow.<eos> She certainly does get around, doesn't she?<eos> Yes. Yes, she does.<eos> Murphy, I'll take care of this. - Friends of the family.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Could you just...<eos> Thanks.<eos> Could I talk to you outside, please?
- Uh, neurosyphilis.<eos> - Wow.<eos> She certainly does get around, doesn't she?<eos> Yes. Yes, she does.<eos> Murphy, I'll take care of this. - Friends of the family.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Could you just...<eos> Thanks.<eos> Could I talk to you outside, please?<eos> I came to you because I thought this could be discreet.
Lindy?<eos> Good, you're back.<eos> Why are you stuffing my handbag with toiletries?<eos> You're leaving.<eos> Leaving?<eos> Cyber Crimes is working a big case.<eos> I can't leave you here without a protective detail.<eos> Where exactly am I leaving to?<eos> Montauk.<eos> I booked you on the Jitney. Connor's meeting you there.
He kind of reminds me of Philippe.<eos> You remember Philippe, from Montreal?<eos> You liked him.<eos> We both liked him.<eos> Yeah, well, he died.<eos> - Meningitis.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> That... that's so sad.<eos> Tessa...<eos> What is going on with you?
Yeah, well, he died.<eos> - Meningitis.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> That... that's so sad.<eos> Tessa...<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - The partying.<eos> Traveling, Philippe.<eos> I don't know, it's just not you.
Seems like it's gonna be an all-nighter.<eos> Yep.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You seem different.<eos> This was a bad idea.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> What's a bad idea?<eos> This.<eos> This whole flirtation.<eos> It's not easy having to hang out and protect you all the time.
I'm still hung.<eos> Wow, you're really warm.<eos> You know me.<eos> I'm always warm.<eos> I just need sleep.<eos> You don't look so hot yourself.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Don't try and change the subject.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm really worried about you.
It's the weekend tomorrow.<eos> The island will be deserted.<eos> If they catch us trespassing, the most they can do is fine us $800.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> All you need is some DNA.<eos> A hair.<eos> And then we can put this to bed one way or the other right now.<eos> You're serious?<eos> If it was my sister out there, I'd need to know.<eos> I'll go with you to the end of the line, Lindy.
No...<eos> You're the kind of girl that you like to control everything that everyone fixes!<eos> God.<eos> It's you.<eos> Eye Candy?<eos> How did you know where I lived?<eos> Creeped you out, didn't I?<eos> It's the pillow.<eos> I feel hungover but we didn't even drink.<eos> I'll go with you to the end of the line, Lindy.
I think I found our way in.<eos> Lindy, what did you find?<eos> - The file is my case file.<eos> - What?<eos> The Cyber Crimes Unit's case against me.<eos> It's redacted.<eos> I can't read it.<eos> The original file's on Catherine's computer.<eos> It's him, Lindy.<eos> He's playing with you and now you find your case file inside a picture of your sister?
Are you sure?<eos> It'll come to me.<eos> - Why did you lie to me?<eos> - What?<eos> - About your parents' divorce.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - What are we talking about? - I called them, Tessa.<eos> My parents?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> They're worried about you.
What are you doing here?<eos> Lindy Sampson, you're being charged with four counts of violating the computer fraud and abuse act for crimes related to your activities as a hacktivist.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and...<eos> You're a cop?<eos> Lindy, listen to me.<eos> I traced the call.<eos> It's him.<eos> He's inside the Cyber Crimes Unit.<eos> The killer is with you, Lindy.
- And who told you that you shouldn't? - You did.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Love you.<eos> Daddy's got a business trip.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, in just a few minutes I'll be coming through the cabin to offer you a selection from our beverage service.<eos> This is a nice plane.<eos> Yeah. Glad Roselle was able to get you a seat.<eos> Yeah, right away.<eos> I told you, online, it's a crapshoot.<eos> I want to go over the itinerary just once more with you.
Why'd you call?<eos> Well, like I said on my VM, I'm in town on business.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, you wanna get a beer?<eos> No, man, this week's kind of tough for me, but...<eos> How long you in town for?<eos> Just a couple of days actually.<eos> Are you comin' out at all again this year?<eos> No, I don't have that planned at all.<eos> All right, fuck it. I'll meet you.
'Cause that's fucking bullshit.<eos> It's Lawless.<eos> Olli.<eos> D-Smooth.<eos> What's up, my brother?<eos> Hey, that was some fuckin' fun ass shit out there in LA.<eos> The LA.<eos> It's like a great place, shit.<eos> So, yeah, give me a call back.<eos> I wanna talk reunion with you.
Okay, I will.<eos> So, what was up with the whole Spicer thing?<eos> What?<eos> You came in with the name right away.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You guys were tryin' to think of Milhorn's name going back and forth, but then when Oliver and I were tryin' to do the drama teacher, you just came out and said it.<eos> You killed the whole thing.<eos> Killed what whole thing?<eos> I knew Milhorn's, but I still let you have fun with it.<eos> What is going on with you exactly?
- Don't worry about it.<eos> Shit. Are we being too loud?<eos> - A little.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Sorry, bro.<eos> We'll try and keep it down.<eos> Actually...<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?
You heard me.<eos> I want you out of this house! Dan!<eos> Stacey, this does not concern you.<eos> - It's okay, Stacey.<eos> - No, it is not okay.<eos> It is okay!<eos> Maybe I overstayed my welcome.<eos> I'm gonna get my things and crash at Craig's.<eos> I am so sorry, Oliver.<eos> Dan, what is the matter with you?
I'll just...<eos> So... How was your three-way?<eos> Didn't happen.<eos> Damn.<eos> It was a prank.<eos> No, Dad. It just wasn't me.<eos> Look, I know I've been a little absent lately.<eos> You've tried to talk to me about this stuff...<eos> I just want you to know, you can talk to me about whatever.<eos> And I wanna talk to you about some things.
Aye, they know your plans to recover the gold must be kept secret and silent.<eos> If it were to be discovered by another crew, they could become competition for its retrieval.<eos> You know how to keep a secret between three men?<eos> Shoot two of them.<eos> What kind of fool tries to keep a secret amongst 100?<eos> The faster we retake the fort, the faster you'll be back on the water en route to the Urca with my men in your service.<eos> Even if the information were to be divulged that the gold is still to be won, even if another crew could discern its specific location, even if they could refit rapidly enough to get out there ahead of you, they'd still be facing a warship standing between them and their prize.<eos> Adhere to our plan, you will have your gold and I'll have my fort.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I need to speak with you alone.

I will see you when I am able.<eos> I have come upon some information which changes things for you.<eos> You must not move against that fort.<eos> Miranda, you don't understand what's going on.<eos> I understand why you need that fort.<eos> I understand why you need that gold.<eos> I understand why you need this island.<eos> I understand it all because I was there the day our lives ended and all of this began.<eos> But I have been devoted to you since that day.<eos> I have been loyal and protective and fucking committed to you since that day, and I am asking you to come with me so that I can save your life.
I think you are fighting for the sake of fighting.<eos> Because it's the only state in which you can function. The only way to keep that voice in your head from driving you mad.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What voice?<eos> The one telling you to be ashamed of yourself... for having loved him.<eos> You were told that it was shameful.<eos> And part of you believed it.<eos> Thomas was my husband.<eos> I loved him and he loved me.<eos> But what he shared with you... it was entirely something else.
Fuck you.<eos> You won't fucking touch me.<eos> You know who my captain is?<eos> Who my brothers are?<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> Some skinny little cunt without a crew.<eos> Not a fucking soul...<eos> What did you do?<eos> You fucking lunatic!<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
Shut the fucking door!<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Why are you here?<eos> Look...<eos> I need...<eos> You can't just barge into my place like that.<eos> - I needed to talk to you.
It's just us, Martin.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> - Why did you come here?<eos> - I got your message.<eos> No, no, no, no, no!<eos> My message told you not to come here!<eos> I told you not to come!<eos> We were worried about you, Martin.
The same one that followed me here or a similar looking one!<eos> I got it, man!<eos> I fucking proved it!<eos> Christ almighty.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing. No, no, what?<eos> Say it, what?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - What?<eos> So you were experimented on... and you came to in some lab, some Army base lab.
She doesn't answer, so I lean in towards her.<eos> - Do you know what she said?<eos> - No.<eos> That she doesn't want a bloody soldier.<eos> Pick up the pace. We're in a hurry.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - I worked with my dad.<eos> I didn't see Ingrid all that much.<eos> You'll see her soon.<eos> - What about you, Gram?
- But you're not.<eos> - That's exactly what I am.<eos> - Your father's German, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Then you're German, too.<eos> - You're thicker than I thought.<eos> This is not a game.<eos> Let's save it for tomorrow, eh?<eos> - Go back to sleep.<eos> - It's hard with you squabbling.
I'm quite tired, too.<eos> Come on.<eos> Max!<eos> Max!<eos> Yeah, boy!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Good boy.<eos> You're up early this morning.<eos> Yeah, I thought I might come into town with you, if you don't mind.
Too late in the summer to get another job.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> - You're an idiot.<eos> I'm just busting your balls.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> First day at work, you'll be crying like a baby begging to go home by lunch.<eos> Yeah, we'll see.<eos> Write your blood type on your boots for when you sever a limb. Boots?<eos> I was gonna wear flip-flops.<eos> I'm gonna enjoy fucking with you all summer.
But don't get me wrong my intentions are not all altruistic.<eos> If I can only enjoy one beer a day, why not make it 130 proof?<eos> - Can I taste it? - Ho-ho.<eos> It has yet to kiss my lips, my friend. But the time is upon us.<eos> Let's take our business elsewhere. To some place more righteous than here.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> "Sell your home at a premium price."<eos> How much could they be offering for in this neighborhood?<eos> Twenty dollar make you holler.<eos> - Can we talk to you?
How's the pharmaceutical business going?<eos> Got five hundred coming in next week.<eos> Can you take it?<eos> No.<eos> That's cool, I'll split it..<eos> It's still a no.<eos> Let's cut to the chase.<eos> He sent me here to give you a message.<eos> Boss down south?<eos> Not very pleased with you.
He was with us.<eos> I knew all I did was buy myself some time, but it was necessary.<eos> Sundown is gonna have his case thrown out by the DA.<eos> And he's gonna walk this afternoon, after his hearing.<eos> When it came to the cartels, and the boss down in Mexico, that was a different story.<eos> Once in that world, you can't just leave by your own free will.<eos> So what did I do?<eos> I had them oust me.<eos> He sent me here to give you a message.<eos> Boss down south, not very pleased with you.
No one goes outside, no matter what. You keep 'em in here.<eos> I'm gonna lead this thing away from here.<eos> I'm really scared. I'm...<eos> I'm not strong enough for this. I can't stand this.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> You are strong enough.<eos> Lily.<eos> Come on, sweetheart.<eos> You are strong enough. Come on.<eos> I'm counting on you.
I was under the impression that this was the only lodge out here. Nothing else within a hundred miles.<eos> Well, there's actually a research camp...<eos> For wildlife preservation.<eos> I see.<eos> [Hanna] Adding several traits from the wolf DNA to our subject... Has seen favorable adaptations that will increase...<eos> Subject beta has gained a number of traits... That we anticipated going into the project. That bitch.<eos> DNA has also added expanded...<eos> They're growing these goddamn things.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I wanted to talk to you alone.
Is she okay?<eos> Yes, she's fine.<eos> She was asking about you.<eos> Can you go check?<eos> Yeah, sure. I will.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Okay, I guess.<eos> Oh, Ben.<eos> Everyone in town has been so worried about you.
Oh, God.<eos> 9:30.<eos> This is gonna be fun.<eos> No Wi-Fi at 9:30.<eos> I want more cookies.<eos> She was right about the burnt walnuts.<eos> So, go get some.<eos> Well, it's past 9:30. I don't want to wake them.<eos> Oh, just be quiet. They're old, they won't hear anything.<eos> I've wanted to spend time with you for so long, Nana.
- Is he in trouble?<eos> - Yeah, he is.<eos> Will you go out with me?<eos> I'll go easy on him if you do.<eos> All right.<eos> But not for that reason.<eos> Saturday night.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> You're half-dressed, talking to a man in the door.<eos> What's wrong with you, Frances?
- Sorry for wasting your time, Jack.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> Here you go, mate.<eos> Good?<eos> You fucking little thieving cunt.<eos> You understand?<eos> I heard me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Next time I'll finish you off, you little slag.
I'm a club owner.<eos> I like the money and I like the respect of being a club owner.<eos> But I'm not a gangster.<eos> I could have been a boxer, but then, you know... hello, mate...<eos> I'd end up looking like some sort of potato.<eos> And I wouldn't even know what day of the week it was.<eos> This way, at least I know who I am, you know?<eos> More so, I like the fact that I've made a little something of myself.<eos> I don't owe the world anything.<eos> So long as the world agrees with you.
No, no, no...<eos> Right, you, get him out of here.<eos> Go on, fuck off.<eos> - One hour.<eos> We'll be with you.<eos> - That's it, bye-bye.<eos> Fuck off, George.<eos> There's the door, go on.<eos> - Bye-bye.<eos> - Take that dead fox with you.
Hello, Frances.<eos> - Hello, Ron.<eos> - I saw Reg today.<eos> He sends his best.<eos> He says it's probably best that you don't go and visit him yet.<eos> Did he say why?<eos> Nah, didn't mention it.<eos> Do you know it is possible, right, for a person to become a ghost while they're still alive.<eos> You think so?<eos> Well, it's happened to you, ain't it?
Right!<eos> - Your flowers.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And your Christmas present.<eos> Sorry it's late.<eos> Go on, open it.<eos> Frances Shea, will you marry me?<eos> We'll live free and above-board?<eos> On my honor.<eos> Yes, Reggie Kray, I will marry you.
- There she is.<eos> - Yeah, I got her.<eos> All right, stop here.<eos> That girl's gonna be the death of me.<eos> Mind how you go.<eos> Frankie.<eos> Frank.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I need to have a word with you about something.
Franny, I'm telling you, the police stitched me up.<eos> - I am innocent.<eos> I'm completely...<eos> - Even if you are...<eos> - What?<eos> - You're back in prison.<eos> You made a promise to me.<eos> And it still stands, it stands.<eos> I'm fucking innocent!<eos> I'm sorry, I don't mean to swear at you, all right?
- What?<eos> - You're back in prison.<eos> You made a promise to me.<eos> And it still stands, it stands.<eos> I'm fucking innocent!<eos> I'm sorry, I don't mean to swear at you, all right?<eos> I just...<eos> I really want you to marry me.<eos> Please.<eos> If you're innocent and acquitted, I'll marry you.
It's over.<eos> Teddy, take him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - That's very kind of you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> For the tea.<eos> That's a good deal.<eos> How do I look?<eos> Fucking deadly.<eos> - Do you want me to come in with you?
I dare you.<eos> Frances.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Because I can't kill you.<eos> No matter how much I fucking want to.<eos> Reggie.<eos> Reggie?<eos> Reggie?<eos> Reggie, look at me.<eos> What the fuck's wrong with you?
I remember the first time I got laid but my first corpse, that shit is burned in my memory.<eos> I'll never forget that face, man.<eos> - Was it terrible?<eos> - No, it wasn't terrible.<eos> It was... it was nice.<eos> She was... 17, red head, nice body.<eos> - The corpse?<eos> - No, my...<eos> The girl, the first girl I slept with.<eos> What's wrong with you?
Are you fond of killing demons, my Lord?<eos> It's either them or me.<eos> I guess you are not Little Snow after all!<eos> I have never been to this city before.<eos> Sister, what's wrong?<eos> The guy who stopped our caravan earlier, why did he come back?<eos> Haven't you stared enough? No ...<eos> Come here and make yourself useful.<eos> - I'm not done looking ...<eos> All my souls and spirits are here with you.
How come I don't remember a thing?<eos> I couldn't stop crying. I thought I would never see you again.<eos> And then?<eos> - Then Master Zhang brought you back!<eos> A God is a God!<eos> You came back as if nothing had happened!<eos> Not even a scar on your head!<eos> I need to go to Hell!<eos> I need to find out who I really am.<eos> I'm going with you!
Get out of the car.<eos> Come on!<eos> Let me out!<eos> I don't think I can do this, Luke.<eos> Well, you have to.<eos> You have to kill her and finish what we started.<eos> Hey. Will you shut up!<eos> Nobody's talking to you.<eos> Will you come with me?<eos> I'm always with you.
- Look, Cuca-- Look, let us explain what we have to--<eos> Wait.<eos> From now on, in all of my labs... I'll build a large house with air-conditioning, with a pool...<eos> - And whores from Brazil.<eos> - ...and whores from Brazil.<eos> - Just for you.<eos> - One problem.<eos> These are my labs.<eos> Relax.<eos> No one's arguing with you.
The hippies had been replaced by Colombians, and these guys didn't wear flip-flops.<eos> The Miami coroner said Colombians were like Dixie cups.<eos> Use 'em once, then throw 'em away.<eos> The Dade County morgue couldn't fit all the bodies from the drug war.<eos> They had to rent a refrigerated truck from a local company to hold all the extra corpses.<eos> That was the first person I ever shot.<eos> A teenager not old enough to buy a six-pack.<eos> Hey... it was self-defense.<eos> - Kevin called you?<eos> - He's worried about you.
Queens used to get adorned here won't you adorn your Queen tonight?<eos> "This kind of yearning sometimes leads to destruction."<eos> "A clean image gets marred."<eos> "Examples of change of heart are a many."<eos> "Beautiful dreams make me yearn."<eos> "Yearning full of need and indulgence."<eos> "Come to me, darling. I yearn for you."<eos> "I want to spend my life with you."<eos> Remember this place?<eos> It's the same place where I fought with you over something imagine that the same barbecue is set up there I've worn your favourite dress again and...
Call it what you like, but yesterday she was enraged.<eos> And today she is not.<eos> That is not seduction, that is simply removing the cause of her frustration.<eos> Please.<eos> She was frustrated because you crossed Eleanor Guthrie.<eos> Do you really believe that?<eos> Has she not been behaving strangely for far longer than any of that?<eos> Were Mr. Hamund here, perhaps he could testify on the subject.<eos> I beg your pardon, but are you asking me to believe that Anne killed eight men, risked her life, utterly destroyed both our reputations, to say nothing of the damage done to her relationship with me,<eos> to remove you from that tent, and that she did it all because she secretly wants to fuck you?
Although, perhaps this is just the act of a spineless traitor, in which case... well, in which case...<eos> I have a duty to do something about it.<eos> - You need to walk away from this.<eos> - Walk away?<eos> This venture is on shaky footing.<eos> How long before the street realizes this?<eos> How long before the mob is outside your door again?<eos> What happens if this time it won't go away?<eos> Since when have you been concerned with my operation?<eos> My concern is for you.
What?<eos> I'm asking if there's any reason I should expect he may not be willing to pay to ensure no harm comes to you?<eos> You're asking if he loves me?<eos> He'll pay you what you ask.<eos> Can you write?<eos> Of course.<eos> Then write the following.<eos> You're a prisoner of the pirate Captain Charles Vane.<eos> Your ransom, should your father ever wish to see you alive again, is £250,000.<eos> The next contact I'll make will be to arrive in Charlestown harbor with you in my possession.
She loves you, and that means a lot.<eos> I'm a little short tonight, can I get you next week?<eos> - Yeah, no, that's cool.<eos> I get it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Bye, Jessie! - Bye, Shannon!<eos> See you tomorrow!<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> Mom?<eos> Wasn't expecting you 'till later, Greg.
Will someone take me home?<eos> Yeah. Come on, I'll give you a ride.<eos> ...symbolizes your eternal love.<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> We did it!<eos> I'm so glad you guys could watch!<eos> We'll say it was beautiful in the comment section.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I believe I'm supposed to carry you across the threshold.
I'm sure you did.<eos> Maybe that's the problem-- you always do the right thing.<eos> Maybe it's time to do the wrong thing.<eos> Like you're doing right now?<eos> Exactly.<eos> I asked you over and over if you were okay.<eos> Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren't?<eos> I thought I was okay, but it turns out I'm not.<eos> Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift!<eos> Wow! Well, marriage must agree with you.
Exactly.<eos> I asked you over and over if you were okay.<eos> Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren't?<eos> I thought I was okay, but it turns out I'm not.<eos> Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift!<eos> Wow! Well, marriage must agree with you.<eos> Well, you are just glowing.<eos> I'm not glowing.<eos> I'm upset.<eos> Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.
Well...<eos> I think I'll be going. Sheldon...<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> We are done here.<eos> Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?<eos> Sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.<eos> All right, Leonard, hang in there.<eos> Talk to you tomorrow.
He's, um...<eos> Forget it.<eos> Um, I just wanted to check on you guys and see if you were okay.<eos> You guys didn't come over the other night. I just...<eos> So are you guys okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What's...<eos> You know, I haven't been as... open with you... as I should be.<eos> You deserve that.<eos> You deserve to be with someone that can offer that to you.
It's strange to hear you speak so highly of it.<eos> Do I seem so unfeeling?<eos> You never take Dagen's affection for you seriously.<eos> I have business with Captain Purio.<eos> Captain Purio is a little busy today, fighting Gutchers.<eos> War business past this point only.<eos> The Captain will want to see me, I assure you.<eos> - You can pass, but only you.<eos> - No!<eos> I'm going with you.
- What happened?<eos> - We know where the Eel is, let's go.<eos> Dire wolves.<eos> Maybe half a league away, at most.<eos> We need to build a fire, and soon.<eos> And if a swallow or an owl make pray of it, what then?<eos> My beetles are pray to nothing.<eos> What is that you give them?<eos> Only the Nuri cement they need.<eos> How long have you had them with you?
Do you see that retreat down there?<eos> It's where I dropped your shipment.<eos> Who's he?<eos> The man in charge.<eos> His name is To kora.<eos> He doesn't look Golgotian to me.<eos> - I shouldn't have come.<eos> We're all...<eos> - Calm down.<eos> What's gotten into you?
Comfort.<eos> Better said lament.<eos> I too.<eos> I married to be queen.<eos> Tell me, Antipas, tetrarch of fair Galilee, am I a fool for wanting more?<eos> If so, we are both fools.<eos> Promise... I will someday find you here... not lamenting, but ruling Jews-all Jews- as your father ruled.<eos> All powerful, not a puppet of the Romans.<eos> I will not rest until I'm on this throne as king.<eos> With you by my side.
What is prophesied cannot be denied.<eos> The cup will be raised to your lips, Jesus.<eos> Baptize me.<eos> And I, too, will go into the desert... and listen for the voice of God.<eos> I will baptize you.<eos> Though it is you who should baptize me.<eos> You're right.<eos> Come.<eos> Let the Lord shine his light upon you.<eos> The new dawn, the new light... is with you, my cousin.
Fishing nails is easier than netting fish.<eos> For months now, the hole is near empty.<eos> Do you ask God's blessing?<eos> I know about you, Jesus of Nazareth.<eos> My brother Andrew follows the Baptist.<eos> He told how he greeted you.<eos> - Yes, I remember him.<eos> - So like the bug eater, do you preach?<eos> Or just pray like the rest of us?<eos> Take me with you.
Some do.<eos> And you?<eos> So great will be my pride... when I hear you speak at the temple.<eos> I'll not speak there again.<eos> But on the road, many were coming to hear you.<eos> Well, that's over now.<eos> I've come all this way.<eos> You'll deny me that?<eos> I mean, the decision isn't mine.<eos> I can't speak of it with you.
Come on, let's go.<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> No.<eos> Not you.<eos> Go home.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me go.<eos> Come on...<eos> What's wrong with you?
I want you to tell me their names, And where I can find them.<eos> And then we will set you free.<eos> I promise you.<eos> We can help.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> But maybe... there is someone you can help.<eos> Good.<eos> But tell me everything.<eos> Sofia.<eos> I'll be in touch with you very soon.
I don't wanna take any chances with my prize.<eos> Your prize.<eos> - Good boy.<eos> - So I'm a dog now.<eos> And you're gonna be a sleepy little puppy.<eos> Let's get you up to bed, okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> Well, you wanna be my nurse, too.<eos> - She sleeps with you.
- Oh, I'm good. Thanks.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> All right!<eos> - Did you find what you were looking for?<eos> - Yeah, thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> Don't fade on me now, George.<eos> Come on.<eos> We're gonna play another memory game.<eos> Do you recognize what I'm doing to you?
And now the hardest thing that a father can do is to let his little girl go.<eos> But you're ready.<eos> You have so much ahead of you, Jerrica.<eos> And where you go now is up to you.<eos> Use all you've learned to be the best version of yourself you can be.<eos> Oh, and just so you know, my greatest creation was never Synergy.<eos> It was always you and Kimber.<eos> Be there for each other.<eos> Time with family, with the ones you love most, there's nothing more valuable than that.<eos> I wish I could be there with you to see the person you've become.

I'm going to bring them something we can sell.<eos> It's a surprise.<eos> Come on.<eos> The dogs'll look out for you.<eos> They're fierce dogs, huskies.<eos> But only when it comes to bears.<eos> A husky will never, ever attack a man.<eos> Oh, it's a wood burner.<eos> You'll be fine here.<eos> Can't I come with you?
So Dad's gonna bring pizza home.<eos> Lucy?<eos> Lucy!<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> What would you like me to call you? Lucinda.<eos> It's more adult.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, Lucinda, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It wasn't that long ago you'd have me climb into bed with you when you had a nightmare.
- I can't.<eos> - Yes you can.<eos> Your other spirits... if I leave, I may never be able to come back.<eos> Do you want that?<eos> You have to try.<eos> I'm so sorry for everything I said.<eos> Just for everything.<eos> - I wish I wasn't such a little brat.<eos> - No, no, no, don't... don't say that.<eos> I'd still be here with you and Dad and you would still be together.
Chuck Parson.<eos> Chuck Parson?<eos> You didn't think a scumbag like Chuck Parson could emerge unscathed, did you?<eos> He's Jase's best friend.<eos> He's an accomplice.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He's a heavy sleeper.<eos> Don't, don't, don't.<eos> The 6th-grade dance?<eos> Chuck told all the girls not to dance with you and we all went along with it.
All those paper houses and paper streets and...<eos> And the people, too.<eos> I've lived here 11 years... and I've never come across anyone that cares about anything that matters.<eos> Okay, I'll try not to take that personally.<eos> Here's a tip, Quentin.<eos> You're cute when you're confident.<eos> Less when you're not.<eos> May I have this dance?<eos> You owe me one.<eos> Maybe things would have been different... if I'd hung out with you this whole time.
I'm not being an asshole.<eos> I'm trying to be a regular kid for a change.<eos> Have fun.<eos> What?<eos> Hello, Quentin.<eos> Margo, where have you been?<eos> Everywhere.<eos> Nowhere.<eos> You have to get lost before you find yourself.<eos> People were worried about you.
That's 1,200 miles between you and your love of your life.<eos> Because you love her, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> There you go. Your true love waits.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm gonna do it.<eos> Do it!<eos> Wait, I wanna go.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> She's my best friend. I'm going with you.
Girls were talking to me.<eos> And now the guys and I...<eos> The guys and I and Lacey Pemberton... we're driving to New York.<eos> Wait, you're what?<eos> It's a really long story.<eos> Are you breaking up with me?<eos> Am I...?<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I wanted to be honest with you and I don't want you to be mad at me.
I was thinking how it will be on board one of these ships.<eos> Sailing across the sea to England.<eos> We have not talked about it yet.<eos> I am not sure I want you to come with us to Wessex.<eos> I am ready.<eos> I have endured many hours of training.<eos> Lagertha herself even helped me.<eos> But what if you are with child already?<eos> If I lost you, then I would also lose my child.<eos> I am coming with you!
No, that's not what I meant.<eos> Well, then explain it to me!<eos> I feel trapped, in all this happiness.<eos> I feel trapped, Helga.<eos> We do not want to trap you, Floki.<eos> If you want to leave us, you should leave.<eos> You're too reasonable, Helga.<eos> It doesn't help.<eos> Why are you not angry with me?<eos> Yes, I am angry with you, Floki.
Athelstan...<eos> I rejoice with all my heart to see you again.<eos> How are you?<eos> Within yourself?<eos> I'm well, sire.<eos> Thank God.<eos> You left this behind.<eos> I...<eos> Go on, take it.<eos> May the gods go with you and protect you, my son.
Newly single, ladies.<eos> - Call me, Joe.<eos> - And finally... my right hand man, Mr. Greg Sandoval...<eos> I've been told it's not good to date someone in the band... but honestly, I don't think it's hurting our sound, right?<eos> We're not really dating, Greg.<eos> Excuse me, is that not the correct terminology?<eos> Are we hooking up like my kid says, right? Yes.<eos> Well, we've been spending some time together, yeah.<eos> I spend time with Buster.<eos> I think you and I are different.
If I'm not what I was when I was born, and I ain't what I've become instead... what the fuck am I?<eos> She's going to rest for now.<eos> I know this is the last thing you need to hear, but me and the girls were talking.<eos> We know what risks we face with the turns. How to avoid them, protect against them.<eos> - What she did to Charlotte...<eos> - Don't.<eos> That's not something we know how to protect against.<eos> Shouldn't we be focusing on getting her out the door right now before it's one of us next?<eos> Please don't be the voice of this.<eos> If you're concerned that by removing her from this place she could get violent with you, there are men we can talk to about making sure she can't hurt you.
As long as we don't come any further, they know we're no threat.<eos> I don't want to see a single one of our gun ports open. I don't want to see a single man on deck with a weapon in his hand.<eos> This only works if we can make it clear that we have absolutely no intention of shooting at anyone today.<eos> What if they start shooting at us?<eos> Duck.<eos> Prepare to drop anchor!<eos> I've made arrangements.<eos> You'll be safe here until I return.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm going with you.
What if they start shooting at us?<eos> Duck.<eos> Prepare to drop anchor!<eos> I've made arrangements.<eos> You'll be safe here until I return.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> You heard what she said.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> If I'm standing next to you, he's far more likely to see you as the man you were.
- Yeah.<eos> So.<eos> - You have the hots for my boyfriend?<eos> - No.<eos> Don't lie.<eos> It makes you look crazy.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> You're a crazy little white trash bitch.<eos> Do you really think that he would have anything to do with you?
You are in trouble, mister!<eos> You are. You are.<eos> Jacobs, come in.<eos> Jacobs, do you read?<eos> Come in.<eos> Jacobs, do you read?<eos> Come in.<eos> 10-4.<eos> Read you loud and clear, boss.<eos> Everything all right with you?
No!<eos> Say "I am a crazy bitch."<eos> - I won't say it!<eos> - "Crazy bi..."<eos> - What the fuck, Theresa?<eos> - Fuck yourself.<eos> I can't believe you did that.<eos> When was this?<eos> Why do you like her so much?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
Don't go poaching my players.<eos> You're stuck with me, you're my anchor.<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> Let Mom know you're here.<eos> I gotta go to the bus stop.<eos> You're gonna go pick him up?<eos> He's a grown man.<eos> He can't get here himself?<eos> John, you know I love you, brother.<eos> I have sexy dreams about you.
- Can you pop the trunk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Where you going?<eos> The bus station?<eos> - Yup.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> Did you write something for tonight?<eos> Mama!<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> - I was worried about you.
They hate you, man.<eos> They always will.<eos> Jesus fucking Christ.<eos> Hey, man. I'm just trying to help.<eos> I'm on your side.<eos> So we say yes.<eos> And he comes back.<eos> You know who's gonna get the worst of it, don't you?<eos> You.<eos> John, as soon as things turn to shit, he's gonna come straight back to you.
Do you want him to stay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was surprised to see you get off that bus.<eos> You should take it easy with those things.<eos> why don't you try one?<eos> No.<eos> I don't need any.<eos> I'm not in any pain.<eos> You gonna stay after the weekend?<eos> Maybe I should go with you.
How's that?<eos> - You could be in Miami.<eos> I could be sitting here wondering when I'm gonna see you again.<eos> 'Cause I've missed you.<eos> I missed you more.<eos> 'Course you did.<eos> You were in jail.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> What's up, Grace?<eos> Can I crash with you for a few nights?
I think it's best if the locals take care of the case.<eos> - What?<eos> - I've already talked to Detective Cohen and asked him to leave you out of it.<eos> - Report his findings directly to me.<eos> - Why? - Why?<eos> Well, for one, you two can't stand each other, but two...<eos> I'm just not sure you're in any condition to be able to handle it.<eos> I can do my job, Lynn.<eos> You don't have to worry about me.<eos> I do worry about you.
Almost took my fucking head off.<eos> I've made camp at Port Royal, Tortuga, Kingston.<eos> No matter where I've been, one thing is true. There's always one.<eos> The one you don't cross.<eos> It would seem readily apparent that in this place, that would be you.<eos> Thank you for noticing.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> I think it's no secret that since my arrival I've been repeatedly provoked and harassed by the Guthrie woman.<eos> And, as her aggression seems to be escalating, I thought it wise to speak of this in the open.<eos> Her aggression towards you?
I think it's no secret that since my arrival I've been repeatedly provoked and harassed by the Guthrie woman.<eos> And, as her aggression seems to be escalating, I thought it wise to speak of this in the open.<eos> Her aggression towards you?<eos> Conspiracy with my quartermaster to depose me.<eos> And a provocation by her man-at-arms.<eos> I think you and I have both seen enough of these things to know they never end well.<eos> What are you telling me for?<eos> I saw you that day in the tavern.<eos> I hear you and she have a connection.<eos> And if things were to deteriorate even further between us, I'd just like to know whether I'll have you to deal with, too.
Partnership between your crew and mine.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> But you haven't heard the deal yet.<eos> I took the fort to control the bay, but I have no desire to waste away in it.<eos> My place is at sea.<eos> But as I'm certain you've heard, I was recently deprived of my ship.<eos> Which means I need a new one.<eos> Were she to come with a strong crew, all the better.<eos> Let me stop you there.<eos> Before I came to see you this morning, I will admit I was concerned.
He can't help it!<eos> It's his dad!<eos> Caleb is his dad.<eos> Why are you doing this to me, huh?<eos> - Get in.<eos> - You got the wrong person!<eos> Norman!<eos> You really shouldn't tell anyone that you came here.<eos> You know what you have to do.<eos> I'm always with you.
I liked you being home too, but you got to go to school.<eos> Besides, it's good for you, you know, meet new people, try new things?<eos> Oh, by the way, my mother died.<eos> Here's your lunch.<eos> Wait, what are you talking about, your mother died?<eos> I got a call this morning.<eos> Yep, she's dead, and I'm only telling you this because you might need to know for some legal document some day.<eos> Mother, I'm so sorry.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Do you want me to stay home with you?
Mother, I'm so sorry.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Do you want me to stay home with you?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Like, I haven't spoken to her in 20 years.<eos> It doesn't mean anything to me.<eos> I don't want to go in.<eos> Oh, Norman.<eos> Sweetie, what happened with you and Miss Watson is all in the past, okay?<eos> It had nothing to do with you.
No.<eos> I can't. I'm not going.<eos> Norman, stop being dramatic.<eos> Come on, you're just used to being home, but you got to rip off that bandage and just go.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> Go to school.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> I'll sit with you while you have your lunch, sweetheart.
I'm glad you did.<eos> You seem like a nice girl.<eos> I am.<eos> Thank you for saying that.<eos> Get out of the car!<eos> It's me.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I just...<eos> Stay there.<eos> Look, I followed you up here so I could talk to you.
That's a beautiful dress.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm wondering, could you tell me where a restaurant called Olive and Anchor is?<eos> I looked it up online, but I can't quite figure out how to get there.<eos> It's in the village.<eos> It's very nice.<eos> Yeah, but it's a little bit hidden.<eos> It's down one of the side streets. It's, uh...<eos> Well, actually I, uh... I have to go into town anyway to pick up that new thermostat for room seven.<eos> So, um, I was gonna walk, but why don't I drive with you and show you where it is, and then I can walk home. That's very nice of you, Norman.
How're you feeling?<eos> Better.<eos> But, you know what heartbreak is like.<eos> It's not easy missing someone so much.<eos> I know.<eos> anyway- -- thanks, Harriet,<eos> for arranging all this.<eos> I know this isn't just about playing Byron, Shelley and Polidori.<eos> Actually, it was John's idea.<eos> He's worried about you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I feel a bit guilty.<eos> Well, since we are here, I suggest a toast.<eos> To the night.<eos> - To the night.<eos> - To the night.<eos> That girl... your friend.<eos> Miriam?<eos> Miriam.<eos> Does she live here with you?
- You take hydrogen, you add oxygen, you burn them. [ SOL 37 ]<eos> Now, I have hundreds of liters of unused hydrazine at the MDV.<eos> I run the hydrazine around an iridium catalyst It will separate into N2 and H2.<eos> And if I just direct the hydrogen into a small area and burn it, likely remake history of humanity.<eos> Nothing bad has ever happened from lighting hydrogen on fire.<eos> NASA hates fire because of the whole, fire makes everybody die in space thing.<eos> So, everything they sent us up here with is flame retardant, with... the notable exception of... Martinez's personal items.<eos> I'm sorry, Martinez, if you didn't want me to go through your stuff, you shouldn't left me for dead on a desolate planet.<eos> By the way, I'm figuring you're going to be fine with this, given my present situation.<eos> Counting on you.
So, by Sol 868, he'll be long dead.<eos> We're going to have to launch as soon as possible, which changes our travel time.<eos> Yeah, we're working on it.<eos> Preliminary estimates call for a 414 day trip.<eos> It's Sol 135 now.<eos> We need 13 days to mount the boosters, perform inspections which gives Bruce and his team 47 days to make this probe.<eos> I'll let you call Bruce. Give him the news.<eos> I'm... I'm going to need a change of clothes.<eos> SOL 136<eos> Dear Mark, Apparently, NASA's letting us talk to you now.
But in 20 years, I have not even shared table with you.<eos> - Get used to it.<eos> If they don't say your name, thank God.<eos> If they do, say a prayer.<eos> He knew his end was near.<eos> - How did he know?<eos> - He just did.<eos> One develops a sense for these things.<eos> You can smell it on your interrogators breath.<eos> You know when he's had enough to deal with you.
Please.<eos> Please, please!<eos> They will...<eos> they'll recognize me.<eos> They will.<eos> I've been a client for 20 years.<eos> They will recognize me.<eos> Fariborz Jamshidi is the manager.<eos> He was a teller when I opened the account.<eos> - I can come with you.
Why don't you join us'?<eos> - Please?<eos> - L 'chaim.<eos> - Salamati.<eos> Please.<eos> - They're not as good as yours.<eos> - The whole time I was there, I thought of you. And Parviz. Your mother.<eos> I talked to you.<eos> I embraced you.<eos> I lived with you.
- Prologue, Tim!<eos> - Is your brother in?<eos> - I'm in his geography class. - So?<eos> OK, and remember, if anyone laughs at you, it's because they haven't the guts to do it themselves.<eos> Break a leg.<eos> - Cue overture, Chris.<eos> Eric, curtain!<eos> Two households, both alike in dignity, in fair Verona where we lay our scene.<eos> Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.<eos> - What's up with you?
I'm a dyke, you deadshit.<eos> - Fuck it.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Come here.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Oh!<eos> Oi, back off, mate!<eos> - Why?<eos> Is that your boyfriend?<eos> - I don't wanna fight you.
More than any desire anywhere...<eos> ..deep down, in my deepest heart,<eos> ..I want you back again.<eos> Please...<eos> John...<eos> Don't say any more.<eos> You're making me cry so dreadfully.<eos> Tim, get off!<eos> I have to go.<eos> Take me with you!
What happened to Mina?<eos> I mean Teena ... or whatever the hell. I don't know.<eos> She wasn't my sister, exactly.<eos> It was nice when you played like you were, though. Huh?<eos> You want something Dewey?<eos> On me.<eos> What you got in mind?<eos> Um, how about the twofer plus two?<eos> It's two pancakes and two eggs with either two slices of bacon or a couple of links.<eos> Any chance I can maybe jam one last bone in you? He bothering you?
Transportation and distribution of illegal substances.<eos> That don't look good on a résumé.<eos> No it does not.<eos> How many years would he be in for that?<eos> Well, he's not a first-time offender.<eos> - No. - It's got to be at least 7 to 10.<eos> Depends on the judge.<eos> Could be more. Uh-huh.<eos> - Maybe just let KSP handle this.<eos> Dewey, you think Boyd gives a shit about you?
Remind me why I'm gonna be patient.<eos> Not back him into a corner and force him to draw?<eos> - Plug him face-to-face.<eos> - Get'r done quick.<eos> Save us all a big headache.<eos> Make the world a better place for a little while.<eos> Yeah, you could kill Boyd.<eos> then you'd be headed down to Florida without a star and a gun.<eos> And you might be seeing your daughter through the glass on visitation days at the penitentiary.<eos> Or, Raylan, there's another way it goes, where you try and you fail and the bullet finds you.
- We should both go...<eos> - No, no, I need you to stay here and hold down the fort, all right?<eos> Times have not changed.<eos> We are still being raped and plundered by the white man like we have been for 500 years.<eos> What exactly is it you think we're going to celebrate?<eos> You left, Chayton.<eos> I'm in charge.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I don't want to fight you.
- She went to bed hours ago, Carrie.<eos> - It's past midnight.<eos> - I had to work late.<eos> You know, somehow I don't think you were at the diner.<eos> Well, you know, a lot of single mothers - have to work two jobs.<eos> - This has to stop!<eos> Let's not do this.<eos> Isn't the whole point of getting a divorce so we don't have to fight?<eos> How can you not realize that you are risking the well-being of your children?<eos> What is it with you?
EMS, we got multiple casualties!<eos> Repeat, multiple casualties!<eos> Are you worried about the Indian?<eos> He knew.<eos> How could he know?<eos> They would naturally suspect my involvement.<eos> Who pulled the trigger is not important to them.<eos> It seemed pretty important to him.<eos> You know, I'm gonna put a guard in the house.<eos> Anywhere you go, Burton will go with you.
- Worth what?<eos> How do you want that burger cooked?<eos> Hi.<eos> So what happened?<eos> - He grabbed my ass.<eos> - So you broke his nose?<eos> Do you really think you're the right person to be lecturing me?<eos> Yeah, 'cause right now I'm the only friend you've got.<eos> So I'll ask you one more time.<eos> What's going on with you?
~ Come to gloat?<eos> ~ I've come to give you a message.<eos> From your father.<eos> Do me a favour, hasn't your family run us up enough recently?<eos> I'm serious, I swear I'm not joking.<eos> I've seen him.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> ~ I didn't believe it either.<eos> ~ Just get out!<eos> He said he can't meet you here.
I checked.<eos> Of course!<eos> ~ I need to speak to Curtis, is he in?<eos> ~ I'm not really sure.<eos> It's important!<eos> You should know Curtis doesn't like visitors.<eos> He's not the most sociable.<eos> Mr Braylesford?<eos> Mr Braylesford?<eos> Curtis, there's someone to see you.
Thank you, Spence.<eos> Appreciate it, Spence.<eos> Good luck, Spence.<eos> You know when that call finally came? Never.<eos> For real?<eos> You better wise the fuck up.<eos> 'Cause you got one contract left and when it's done, you'll be out here in the streets with the rest of us.<eos> You keep fucking up like this, you keep acting like a little kid, when it's done and you're done, you're gonna be broke and miserable.<eos> And you know what the worst part about it is?<eos> Nobody will give a fuck about you.
- Behind Steve Largent.<eos> - Who the fuck is that?<eos> He's in the Hall of Fame, Rick.<eos> How do you not know who Steve Largent is?<eos> Can't believe they got me in this position, man. I can.<eos> Because the first thing they teach us in PR is to not get caught fucking skanks in the bathroom.<eos> Men have done much worse.<eos> You know what? Just shut the fuck up.<eos> They got no value for me out there. Well, look, you know how it is now.<eos> Once they see an imperfection, the organization wants nothing to do with you.
And what exactly do you think you're building?<eos> You're out there trying to get funding so you can hire people, scale up, roll out a product, IPO, and eventually become a publicly-traded what?<eos> Corporation.<eos> We would be different.<eos> I suppose once Pied Piper is a billion-dollar company, you'll seek out your competitors and help them.<eos> Please.<eos> Let's face it.<eos> What is Hooli if not the best possible future version of Pied Piper?<eos> You think you're building something different?<eos> No. You're building something that's exactly the same as what I've already built, except with you instead of me, but that's not possible now, Richard.
- You're not eating.<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> For the first time in your life.<eos> There's a first time for everything.<eos> Here.<eos> These will help.<eos> Thank you.<eos> May Freya lie with you tonight, and take care of you, my friend.
I enjoyed fighting.<eos> You fought well today, I watched.<eos> But you took too many risks.<eos> You jumped into battle, you did not stay by my side.<eos> Don't do that, Porunn.<eos> You have much to learn.<eos> Do you suddenly not believe in our gods?<eos> Do you not believe in fate?<eos> Is that really Bjorn, son of Ragnar, or some impostor who just looks like him?<eos> I only do this because I care about you.
I only do this because I care about you.<eos> Or because I'm a woman.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Marry me.<eos> - What?<eos> I asked you to marry me.<eos> What is your answer?<eos> Yes.<eos> I will marry you, Bjorn.
Or because I'm a woman.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Marry me.<eos> - What?<eos> I asked you to marry me.<eos> What is your answer?<eos> Yes.<eos> I will marry you, Bjorn.<eos> I will marry you.
Are you finished?<eos> Please.<eos> Spare my brother.<eos> Rollo!<eos> Rollo!<eos> You poor bastard.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> If the gods allow.<eos> They will not allow it.<eos> Take me with you.
So it seems.<eos> No, more than seems.<eos> I heard of your exploits.<eos> I also heard about Porunn.<eos> Poor Bjorn.<eos> Yes.<eos> Poor Bjorn.<eos> You don't care?<eos> Of course I care.<eos> Anything to do with you, I care about.
Don't you want to have sex?<eos> What is it?<eos> You had so much sex in England you don't need it?<eos> Perhaps more of our people can go and join the settlement.<eos> Yes.<eos> They can go and work for a Christian king, in a Christian country.<eos> Perhaps they can also become Christians.<eos> Why not?<eos> Whatever they choose to do will be up to them.<eos> Who asked you, priest?
Kalf has made himself the new Earl of Hedeby.<eos> I supported you in Wessex, now you must support me.<eos> Together we can overthrow this usurper.<eos> Firstly, you came to Wessex of your own volition.<eos> Secondly, if there is a civil war, many of our own people will die.<eos> Is your earldom really that important to you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because it is rightfully mine!<eos> Well, there is never much use in arguing with you, Lagertha.
Alive.<eos> You want to hate me, but you can't.<eos> Can't I?<eos> All I know<eos> is that I desire you with all my heart.<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> How could I believe you?<eos> I could have let you die.<eos> What if I accept what you have to say?<eos> What if I agree to be with you and go with you?
And he succeeded. Hmm.<eos> He got us into Paris.<eos> And now we have even more spoils.<eos> We leave the camp tomorrow for home.<eos> But because we intend on raiding Paris again in the spring, it is important to maintain some sort of presence here.<eos> - I will stay.<eos> You have no reason to stay here, Floki.<eos> And what reason do you have, Uncle?<eos> Then it is decided.<eos> You will winter here with the rest of the warriors who decide to stay with you.
You might as well have posted fliers.<eos> Aight, I'll be the grown-up and say what's on all y'all niggas minds at this table.<eos> You all mouth, Lamont.<eos> That's your problem.<eos> And we can't afford to be havin' no soft-ass niggas in this crew.<eos> In case you gentlemen have forgotten, that is the protocol to our industry.<eos> You wanna climb the corporate ladder?<eos> Keep you mouth... fuckin' mouth shut!<eos> And, unfortunately, we got a zero-tolerance policy, my nigga.<eos> Lamont, I'm just fuckin' wit' you.
Hey, I'm just trying to give your friend some clarity, here.<eos> Let me give you some fucking clarity, you fucking piece of shit!<eos> A man who discovers that his fucking fiancé is cheating on him six weeks before the god damn wedding, is probably not a guy you want to fuck with!<eos> That man would probably have no fucking issue fucking blowing your fucking stupid face right across the fucking floor!<eos> Zach, Jesus Christ, take it easy.<eos> I'm gonna fucking shoot him.<eos> Calm down, man!<eos> Give me the gun.<eos> Zach, give me the gun.<eos> He's trying to fuck with you, and he's trying to get in your head.
Why'd you hang up on him?<eos> You shouldn't have...<eos> Shut up, Noah.<eos> I can't hear myself fucking think.<eos> Sure, no, that's great.<eos> Guys, let's give Zach time to think.<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> Don't you think that before you hang up on a guy who's most likely gonna see us sleeping with the fucking fishes, you should of consulted with us first?<eos> Are you fucking yelling at me?<eos> Yes I'm fucking yelling at you!
I love you so much right now.<eos> Wow Caprice, I can't believe you actually got them.<eos> That's my honey.<eos> Stickiest fingers in Bailey Downs.<eos> Gotta go.<eos> Don't get busted.<eos> Come on, we got a long drive.<eos> Christmas Eve and you wanna drive to see your old aunt who, as far as I know, doesn't even like you.<eos> She doesn't like anyone.<eos> Okay, fine, but you're dragging us along with you.
Now we haven't got much time, so you're gonna have to do as I say.<eos> Bring the changeling back to the forest where you lost your son.<eos> Changeling?<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> An animal.<eos> That ain't your son.<eos> Don't call again.<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> Molly?<eos> We were worried about you.
Can you move the light?<eos> What happened?<eos> We couldn't wake you up.<eos> Aren't you cold like that?<eos> Where's Dylan?<eos> In the room.<eos> That room?<eos> What's he doing there?<eos> He wanted me to join him, but...<eos> I wanted to stay here with you.
[Editing:<eos> Park Gok Ji] [Music:<eos> Jo Young Wook]<eos> Hey, come here!<eos> You want to get taken away?<eos> These two.<eos> Heads!<eos> What do you mean three?<eos> Look at it, don't you see the scale?<eos> Do you take me for a fool just because I'm going easy on you?
It's me, Byeong Sam.<eos> We're in trouble.<eos> The cops rounded up everyone!<eos> What?<eos> It's probably because of Assemblyman Seo.<eos> - What about Boss Kang?<eos> - He turned himself in on your behalf.<eos> - You have to leave!<eos> - Ah, shit.<eos> Hey, what's with you?
Boss Yang.<eos> You bastard...<eos> Hey, let's move him to the washroom.<eos> Come on, help me.<eos> You've got your boys in there.<eos> The voice...<eos> Hey, you assholes!<eos> Kill them all.<eos> You bastard.<eos> What the hell is the matter with you?
God forgive me.<eos> The child!<eos> Go on, go with her!<eos> But she doesn't want me either.<eos> Grandfather?<eos> Good morning, Grandfather.<eos> Drink.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I'll take you to the parson.<eos> He'll know what to do with you.
How will that work?<eos> You can't walk.<eos> Peter!<eos> - Come on, let's go.<eos> I'm not leaving Klara on her own.<eos> Move, go!<eos> - Peter!<eos> He'll get over it.<eos> We're going!<eos> Heidi, I'd love to go up there with you two.
Yeah.<eos> - Penn Station, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Last call!<eos> 49 Lake Shore Limited!<eos> Last call!<eos> Last call, 49 Lake Shore Limited!<eos> Is that your mother?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's not coming with you?
I'll be happy to correct you, Colonel.<eos> You are wrong.<eos> Trolls are nothing but subdued. In daylight.<eos> Oh. Cryptic and annoying.<eos> A two-fer.<eos> Okay, so we have to get a sample or a picture and not die.<eos> You two, see if the sheriff has any surveillance from the bridge.<eos> Maybe we'll get lucky.<eos> I'll see if I can find anything on the ground.<eos> Um, maybe I should go with you.
I think your definition of bored and mine differ greatly.<eos> "Trolls are nothing but subdued in daylight."<eos> That's just a pile of rocks, right?<eos> Then you should have no problem reaching in there and grabbing a few pebbles.<eos> Go on.<eos> Grab a few.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What?<eos> Um, I didn't think you'd want to work with me.<eos> I told you, Cassandra. I can work with you.
I'm gonna try and play this song backwards, Rob Halford style, man.<eos> I mean, it makes sense, right?<eos> Reverse all this shit?<eos> - Fuck that.<eos> This town is shit.<eos> We're going up to the lookout, rolling a three-skinner, cranking some Slayer and watching this town burn to the fuckin' ground!<eos> - Dude, what about Medina, Giles and Dion?<eos> They could all still be alive.<eos> - Those guys are dicks.<eos> Medina is never gonna put out for you, man.
They don't know who they're dealing with.<eos> I can't do any work.<eos> Look, I've hunted for a job before, and I may not have to, but I appreciate the warning.<eos> No, I keep thinking about that woman.<eos> Her kid got hurt. She felt guilty.<eos> I know what she felt.<eos> I understand the entire psychological situation.<eos> She shouldn't have talked to me that way. She shouldn't have kids.<eos> That's not for you to say.<eos> Ah, Jesus, I can't even agree with you.
Of course he does.<eos> He doesn't know me.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> To be unknown by someone?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Do you want him?<eos> Do you want her?<eos> No.<eos> But you like to watch her.<eos> I like to watch with you, honey.
Vanessa?<eos> I think I wanna write about you.<eos> I'll change the name.<eos> So what?<eos> So what if they know?<eos> Honey, I would never write about that.<eos> My love.<eos> Are we dressing up or not?<eos> I was thinking maybe I'd get dressed and go for a walk.<eos> I'll go with you.
What does it matter whether they hang him or not?<eos> We came here to retrieve this ship.<eos> We've done so.<eos> Ought that not to be the end of the conversation?<eos> We can say what we will about Flint, and I've said my share, but the world knows his name, they know him.<eos> And his body swinging over the harbor of this place sends a powerful message.<eos> No one surrenders to a dying thing.<eos> And that's exactly what we'll be if we don't act.<eos> Where are the men about it?<eos> Well, those who think saving Flint's a good idea, you're taking ashore with you.
Something to hide?<eos> Love letters, maybe, from all those men in your life?<eos> This is fancy.<eos> Greenwich, Connecticut?<eos> Who the fuck you know in Greenwich, Connecticut?<eos> No one.<eos> I was gonna throw it out.<eos> It's stupid.<eos> "I've heard I'm to have a grandchild.<eos> I'd like to see you.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I made a big decision last night.<eos> - You did?<eos> Mmm-hmm. To take control of my own life.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> What prompted this reawakening?<eos> Did you have a religious epiphany?<eos> I just decided it's time to stop whining and to take matters into my own hands and make something happen.<eos> Well, that's good, because, uh, to be honest, some of us here were kind of worried about you.
Yeah, so, it's due on Friday and basically,<eos> I just don't understand his moral principles.<eos> I don't understand. You've been in such a touchy mood.<eos> I'm fine, I just don't want to go to the concert.<eos> Yeah, but the only reason I got the tickets is because you said you wanted to go.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, Roy.<eos> I just had a change of heart.<eos> - Go with a friend.<eos> - Yeah, I will.<eos> But I was looking forward to going with you.
- But you can't, you can't justify it! - Shh!<eos> You can't justify it with all this bullshit.<eos> With all this bullshit, French postwar rationalizing.<eos> This doesn't...<eos> This is murder.<eos> This is murder.<eos> It opens the door to more murder, Abe.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, okay...<eos> I don't have the intellect to refute these arguments.<eos> I can't argue with you.
Saturday was her piano lesson.<eos> Most of the offices were closed.<eos> There was very little action in the building.<eos> I couldn't make it look like the elevator had been tampered with, but I knew enough how to make it seem broken.<eos> Hi.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - I just...<eos> I wanted to talk to you before I go to the police.
I was ordered to plunder the coffers of Florence.<eos> Plunder them I did.<eos> I don't suppose you were ordered to plunder her body as well?<eos> It is common knowledge you bedded the First Lady of Florence.<eos> I can't imagine your orders entailed such a blunderous tactic.<eos> - My methods are my own.<eos> - You fool.<eos> All that matters is we have the funds required.<eos> I am a physician, a man of stature.<eos> I have been seen with you in public.
I'm sure there are others.<eos> If they're not here, they didn't make it.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> If they come, they won't be able to get in and they'll die out there.<eos> Someone has to stay behind. Someone has to let them in.<eos> Megan, Megan, no.<eos> I made a promise to the first generation... a promise that they would be protected.<eos> You need to make sure The children get into the mountain complex.<eos> You need to make sure they're safe.<eos> I'll meet you there.
He had such great plans for his life.<eos> He was everything I wanted to be.<eos> And nothing has ever hurt this much.<eos> Tell me why God takes my brother so young with such a great life ahead of him.<eos> I don't think anybody can answer that question.<eos> You know, just because you're not a religious person doesn't mean you can't pray at a time like this.<eos> Well, if I did pray, it would be to ask God to bring my brother back!<eos> I understand.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't mean to yell at you.
Right 53 veer pass.<eos> You sure?<eos> Hell, yes, I'm sure.<eos> Run the play.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, I might be wrong, but I'm not confused.<eos> Defense, get ready.<eos> All right.<eos> Get in tight.<eos> Randy, this one's coming to you.
We're gonna be playing Notre Dame.<eos> It's the first time they ever accepted a Bowl invitation.<eos> They wanna prove they can beat the national champions.<eos> The doctor.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> That's it.<eos> No more interviews.<eos> We gotta start preparing for Notre Dame.<eos> Come on in, Freddie.<eos> I'll talk to you later.
Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Roof. Hurry.<eos> Vincent, no!<eos> Vincent!<eos> Aah! Vincent...<eos> Listen to me, you-you cannot kill him.<eos> He is an innocent.<eos> Someone did this to him.<eos> Someone experimented on him, just like Muirfield experimented on you.
Damn it!<eos> It's Baird.<eos> Baird!<eos> Baird, we're in here!<eos> Baird!<eos> I tried that before.<eos> She can't hear you.<eos> Samosa?<eos> No, I don't want a samosa!<eos> What's wrong with you?
What's with the attitude?<eos> Yes, I invited her.<eos> She's not coming.<eos> You know, that might be for the best.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Uh, because she's weird.<eos> I dunno, she's like a total stoner, or something.<eos> She has these moments where she, like, completely zones out.<eos> I dunno, she's just kind of off.<eos> Well, Mr. Only Male in Home Ec class, people think you're weird and I still hang out with you.
Sometimes the robe is black.<eos> Sometimes it's white.<eos> Boring.<eos> So, what can I do for you?<eos> Well, Ludivine, it's not so much what you can do for me.<eos> It's more my wife, Fatima.<eos> It's her birthday next week.<eos> That's nice.<eos> You see, Ludivine, out of all the designers out there, Colette is her favorite.<eos> That's why I come speak to you.
I'll just pretend I'm not here.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't know what to think.<eos> All I know is that you spend a lot of time talking with her.<eos> Yeah, Luis. Talking.<eos> It ever cross your mind that I like talking to her 'cause I can relate to her as a parent?<eos> Unlike your childish ass.<eos> Yeah, like you and some blonde chick from Paris have so much in common.<eos> Eddie, why don't I see that?<eos> Are you upset she didn't want to sleep with you?
I had a little help from a friend.<eos> Well, you need to get help more often.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Yes, you're gonna get some.<eos> - Want me to do all the work?<eos> - All the work, baby.<eos> - All the work?<eos> - All of it.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
I'd advise you to get out of there now.<eos> Okay then.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> My mom's just been ill recently, and, um...<eos> Yeah, I... I hate to do this, I just... I have to get going.<eos> I can't say I'm not disappointed.<eos> Look, I'm headed out of town over the weekend.<eos> I want more of you before I go.
Yeah, that grey area where you like to work between us and the bad guys?<eos> It can get real foggy down there.<eos> I'd hate for you to lose your way.<eos> I'll keep my eyes open.<eos> I know the police failed to find your sister.<eos> And for that, I am truly sorry.<eos> But, I can make it up to you.<eos> My department can give you the access and resources to help people.<eos> Help yourself, and find your sister.<eos> Everyone wants to play with you, Lindy.
That's Sophia for you.<eos> One of the kindest girls I know.<eos> She loves to pick up strays.<eos> I'm serious!<eos> It was like a past life thing.<eos> And then, she told me she just got into town.<eos> Don't ask me why, but I insisted she stay with me.<eos> And I've never left.<eos> Is there a past life thing between us, too?<eos> Oh, sweetie, you are plenty to handle in the day to day.
No, trying to get a signal.<eos> Okay, well, I'd prefer if you sit over there. S-sure.<eos> Just trying to give Lindy and Sophia some space.<eos> Well, room's pretty big.<eos> I'd say there's plenty of space.<eos> That's quite some view.<eos> You must spend a lot of nights here alone.<eos> What a shame.<eos> Are you trying to flirt with me?<eos> Would you like me to flirt with you?
I love you, Dad.<eos> I love you too, son.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm getting tired of going to bed without you.<eos> If they're on the fence, I'm going to have to publish another article as soon as I can.<eos> - Are they on the fence?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Just seems like I would've received a letter by now.<eos> Charlie wanted to wait up for you tonight.<eos> I think, if you don't carve that pumpkin with him tomorrow, he's going to disown you.
- I don't know.<eos> Just seems like I would've received a letter by now.<eos> Charlie wanted to wait up for you tonight.<eos> I think, if you don't carve that pumpkin with him tomorrow, he's going to disown you.<eos> Can he do that?<eos> I think he'd have a case, yeah.<eos> And what about you?<eos> Are you ready to disown me, too? Huh?<eos> Can I take that as a no?<eos> I don't want you to think I'm not mad at you, okay?
I've got some client designs I gotta finish.<eos> Please.<eos> So, when I saw it, on the wall, the graffiti, I remembered something that Charlie said to me, on that day, just before he...<eos> - Yep.<eos> - He asked me,<eos> "Dad, can we pay the ghost?"<eos> Okay. So, what are you telling me, Mike?<eos> I mean, we're in a city that's full of graffiti, right?<eos> Did he ever say anything like that to you?<eos> Kristen, have you been hearing anything, or seeing anything that might make you think or feel that Charlie might be trying to communicate with you?

Just try not to move things around too much.<eos> Whoever ransacked this place left Tatiana's purse.<eos> Stereo, TV.<eos> It wasn't a robbery.<eos> Here's her phone.<eos> Tess called her the day she died.<eos> The 16th, right?<eos> It's for you.<eos> Hey, you little klepto, get your ass back up to the suite.<eos> Or we are never gonna work with you again.
He didn't say anything.<eos> It's just, he keeps bringing up Ilaria.<eos> I need to know.<eos> What is going on here?<eos> What the hell have you gotten me into?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We can deal with Alan.<eos> Now here's what you need to do.<eos> Look at this mess.<eos> I'm very disappointed in you.
You know I love you.<eos> More than every face on that wall.<eos> Ever since you were, oh, a small child, you were different.<eos> You were smarter.<eos> You were more self-possessed.<eos> More driven.<eos> Of all my daughters you've always been my favorite.<eos> But this lack of trust, this doubt, it's like a virus.<eos> And we will lose everything we've worked for everything I've built for the past 500 years.<eos> -I just wanna be with you forever.
We gotta get this thing under control.<eos> It's a war zone.<eos> Hey, watch it.<eos> You'll pop your stitches.<eos> He's right.<eos> -You gotta sit this one out.<eos> -What?<eos> No.<eos> You cannot triage an abbey's worth of unstable patients on your own.<eos> -I'm coming with you.
Eighty-three Mycotics, and we only found four.<eos> Looks like the sedative is wearing off.<eos> This place is about to be turned upside down.<eos> -Have you seen Sarah?<eos> -I figured she was with you.<eos> No.<eos> I checked her room.<eos> She wasn't there.<eos> I thought I'd check the lab next.<eos> I'll come with you.
You tell me.<eos> You've been doing it for centuries.<eos> I've always enjoyed my unique place in this world.<eos> Take Agnes, for example.<eos> Her death was swift and merciful.<eos> I saved her from a long and painful decline.<eos> Don't you talk about her.<eos> -You don't have that right.<eos> -Of course I do.<eos> I made her, and I ended her, just as I'm going to end you.
You're all safe now.<eos> The CDC--<eos> Michael said the CDC was here to keep us safe.<eos> -But they brought the sickness.<eos> -No.<eos> That's absolutely not true.<eos> Lies and more lies.<eos> Michael, who called himself our brother fell prey to the evil words of the outsiders and now my mother is following his path.<eos> -How dare you speak to me that way.<eos> -I will speak to you any way I like!
No.<eos> He believes in what he's doing.<eos> -How's that? -He's young.<eos> He's reckless.<eos> But he's not going through the motions.<eos> He really believes it.<eos> Now we're getting somewhere.<eos> Doreen, you know exactly why I can't leave Kyle out here.<eos> Yeah, well he's as stubborn as you and doesn't back down from a fight.<eos> He may even look a bit like you if you shave the damn beard.
Understand?<eos> Make me understand.<eos> I only take orders from Dr. Walker.<eos> Shame to waste so much aggression on someone who can't even feel it.<eos> Do not talk about her that way.<eos> You really care about her.<eos> I bet you cared about all of them.<eos> Each in their different way.<eos> You know who I don't care about?<eos> You.
What's taking Balleseros so long?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He may get sidetracked, but he'll come through.<eos> It's not like we have anything to give to Amy anyway.<eos> We're running out of time, and she's gonna kill my son.<eos> Let me talk to her.<eos> Alone.<eos> -No. No.<eos> -You're too emotionally invested.<eos> You wanted to do this together, so I'm coming with you.
You can help by staying out of sight.<eos> Soren.<eos> Promise me.<eos> I promise.<eos> You scared me.<eos> I figured I'd find you up here poring through 500 years of clues.<eos> Believe me, there's not much to find.<eos> What do you want, Alan?<eos> Actually, I came to apologize.<eos> I came at you pretty hard yesterday.
- Bullshit.<eos> - Bullshit... if I was the one who killed that little man.<eos> You only shot him once he was already on the ground, dead.<eos> I shot him first.<eos> - Come in.<eos> Did you give information about Poison to the DEA?<eos> So?<eos> I'm still listening to their phone conversations, and it's not a shipment of drugs.<eos> They're carrying three million dollars to Bogotá, and if two guys from the DEA stop that car,<eos> Pablo is going to hang you by the balls.
How many?<eos> - Two.<eos> Yeah, but two what?<eos> Sergeants or officers?<eos> Officers.<eos> You know Poison.<eos> - Officers are a million each.<eos> - OK, so two million?<eos> - Yes, I'm writing it down here.<eos> - OK, talk to you later.
You know what you have to do?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Remember, you have to record the entire conversation.<eos> Don't forget.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Have a nice flight.<eos> Aren't you coming with me?<eos> No, the boss just told me to bring you here.<eos> Hey, but don't worry.<eos> Tomorrow, I'll come and meet you there.
I've been instructed to tell you that if you cease and desist your operations, you will receive a one-time payment of six million.<eos> Horacio... that's US dollars, not pesos.<eos> Instructed by whom?<eos> I think you can guess.<eos> Say the name.<eos> You know who.<eos> Say the name, Rodrigo.<eos> Escobar.<eos> Don't look at me like that, Horacio.<eos> I've always cared for you.
There's no arguing that.<eos> But you gave in.<eos> And there are people who will see that as weakness.<eos> We've gotta keep our enemies close, now more than ever.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's great to see you again, Valeria.<eos> Likewise, Pacho.<eos> I'm very happy to see you.<eos> Although, I must say... it was a little unexpected.<eos> We are worried about you.
The last thing I want is to be married to him.<eos> Besides... do you think I'd want to be his wife?<eos> Do you think I want to be locked up, waiting all day at the Monaco building, while he's out with... with me?<eos> No.<eos> That's too boring.<eos> I missed you so much.<eos> I missed you, too.<eos> No, it was terrible.<eos> It was terrible.<eos> Every day in a different house... worried about you... the kids...
Oh, my God.<eos> "Where were you?"<eos> "Where have you been, son?" I would yell out.<eos> "In the mountains, Mama."<eos> "Higher than the clouds, Auntie," Gustavo would say, laughing.<eos> He...<eos> He always wanted to go farther.<eos> He always did.<eos> But with you.<eos> Only with you.
- He needs you to stay here to look after your sister.<eos> Isn't that what he always says?<eos> - But the soldiers are going to kill him.<eos> - Don't ever say that in this house!<eos> - They're going to kill him!<eos> - Quiet!<eos> The car was outside the garage, still idling, the keys still in the ignition.<eos> - I've called his phone 20 times.<eos> - Did you call embassy security?<eos> - No, I wanted to talk to you first.
Makes a mean cocktail, gives you door-to-door service right to the embassy.<eos> - What did Herrera say?<eos> - What'd he say?<eos> What'd he say?<eos> You fuckin' gave him that information.<eos> He's got pictures on me, he's got tape on me, Javi.<eos> Answer me.<eos> - What?<eos> - Did you give that shit to Herrera?<eos> - Do you think I would do that to you?
You've come to your senses?<eos> As a matter of fact, I have.<eos> Seems I bet on the wrong horse.<eos> Time to put it down.<eos> Rodrigo, I need to talk to the Alpha council.<eos> They have already decided.<eos> They want your head.<eos> This is not about me, this is about all of us.<eos> There is no "us", Malcolm.<eos> You're finished. I don't want you pulling me down with you.
I need the truth.<eos> Has Aleister ever asked you about our powers?<eos> He knows what we are.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> Listen to me very carefully, Savannah.<eos> You can never trust Aleister.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> He's...<eos> He's dangerous!<eos> He may act nicely towards you, but that is not who he really is.
It's for my safety.<eos> Is that what he's telling you?<eos> Look, you can trust me.<eos> Okay?<eos> You're family came to us for help.<eos> My mother's dead.<eos> Paige and Ruth aren't my family.<eos> They want to control me.<eos> They may not be blood, okay, but they love you.<eos> They care for you.
I didn't give you up, it's a lie.<eos> They want you to fight me!<eos> They... they want us to Change and then they'll kill us both!<eos> Nice try.<eos> You're trying to trick me so I won't Change.<eos> Then you will.<eos> There were other werewolves here.<eos> Huh! Do you see them around?<eos> They're in jars now!<eos> If I don't fight you, I'll end up in jars too.
I was pissed off.<eos> I might have said some things.<eos> Can you tell me why you fired her?<eos> It was a university protocol matter.<eos> That's all I can say.<eos> Paige: Standard 411 search gives us six T. Ashmonts.<eos> One deceased.<eos> We're going to have to do better than 411 if we want to find these guys.<eos> Why don't you let Nick here have a crack at the hack, huh?<eos> Nick Sorrentino. 234 women have matched with you on Tinder this month alone.
The witch is dead.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Why have they brought you in here?<eos> I asked them to.<eos> Okay, um, would you like your choice of a luxurious cot, or a super cold concrete floor?<eos> The cot.<eos> I can get him to make your room more comfortable if you want.<eos> I don't want to get more comfortable.<eos> I want to get out of here.<eos> With you.
- Yeah.<eos> No way.<eos> We don't have to talk to your mom.<eos> - We can't do...<eos> - We can go, and we can just... take a look.<eos> Have a nice dinner... bottle of wine...<eos> Maybe we can even spend the night.<eos> I think that we deserve it.<eos> Elena?<eos> The other Alphas would like to speak with you.
- He's dead, Lily.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> His last words to me were your name.<eos> He wanted me to come find you.<eos> But now that I'm here, I wish that I hadn't come, because I brought so much danger into your life.<eos> - I mean...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> A happy moment with you... is worth all the heartbreak in the world.
If it helps, what harm can it do?<eos> Can I borrow this?<eos> No.<eos> I...<eos> It's too fragile.<eos> Shouldn't be out in the woods.<eos> You must have something.<eos> Survey maps?<eos> You building us a little cottage?<eos> Right now, I'm more worried about you.
They're tearing us apart.<eos> I won't let that happen.<eos> Listen to yourself.<eos> This isn't you.<eos> You're right.<eos> This is me.<eos> Clay, no.<eos> Stop.<eos> (Grunting) What are you...?<eos> Stop it, what's wrong with you?
This isn't you.<eos> You're right.<eos> This is me.<eos> Clay, no.<eos> Stop.<eos> (Grunting) What are you...?<eos> Stop it, what's wrong with you?<eos> (Door slam) Elena!<eos> Hello?<eos> I count on you to help me keep this Pack together, not tear it apart.
Let's finish this.<eos> It's okay...<eos> - Argh!<eos> - Is he okay? It's the first wave of the Change.<eos> He's caught in the pain.<eos> It's affecting all of us.<eos> Oh, save your strength, sweetheart.<eos> How are you alive?<eos> We came to an understanding.<eos> I'm with you on this, all right?
- Listen to me...<eos> - Clay and Elena are in there.<eos> - I open this door, they're coming through.<eos> I don't know how long I can hold them, go.<eos> - But... - Please.<eos> Just do this for me.<eos> Nick?<eos> Nick!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't get to you, darlin'.
Let's go.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> She's not coming.<eos> She has work to do.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> You know who I was supposed to have lunch with?<eos> Someone important?<eos> Doesn't anything mean anything to you?<eos> Here, this will hold you over.<eos> I'll meet you by the elevator.
He acts like we're the Three Musketeers.<eos> We've never had lunch.<eos> I just wanted to say that I'm very happy for you.<eos> And everyone's going to miss you who doesn't hate you for getting that big job.<eos> Well, you're doing fine.<eos> Keep it up, you'll be a creative director by 1980.<eos> God, that sounds like a long time.<eos> I'm telling you, it will happen.<eos> They just have to get used to the idea.<eos> Someday people are going to brag that they worked with you.
Oh, wait, Don. When was the last time you saw them?<eos> Betty, I didn't know.<eos> Don, honey, I- - I appreciate your intentions.<eos> I really do.<eos> But I'm not going to waste the rest of my time arguing about this.<eos> I want to keep things as normal as possible, and you not being here is part of that.<eos> Birdie...<eos> I know.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'll talk to you soon.
You weren't raised with Jesus.<eos> You don't know what happens to people when they believe in things.<eos> It's true.<eos> You think that I don't want to hear the truth?<eos> I could help you.<eos> I could move to LA.<eos> Look, I don't know what you're doing.<eos> You show up with some family heirloom.<eos> You're not my family.<eos> What's the matter with you?
It's just a couple of little projects.<eos> Don't you want to be with me?<eos> Of course.<eos> But I don't know, it seems like this might be a chance to build something.<eos> Well, it's going to take all your time, all your energy, and all your attention.<eos> That's not true.<eos> It is.<eos> I did it.<eos> And you loved it.<eos> I want to be with you, and I don't want to be rooting for you to fail so that can happen.
You've got to let him go.<eos> It doesn't mean you stop caring about him.<eos> I'm sorry I said those shitty things to you.<eos> I don't believe them.<eos> Look, you're going to do great no matter what you do.<eos> I think you were right.<eos> I mean, I'm going to stay.<eos> Good, because I didn't want you to leave.<eos> Then why didn't you just say that?<eos> Because every time I'm face to face with you, I want to strangle you.
You will, I promise.<eos> But first, I got to go to the bathroom.<eos> Hi, you've reached Wes Lawrence.<eos> Please leave a message.<eos> Wes, you need to call me right away.<eos> Minx knows.<eos> She knows... What you did.<eos> Told you, mommy.<eos> You scared me.<eos> Daddy doesn't want to talk to you.
You leave!<eos> - Okay. Let's go.<eos> - Go.<eos> Go.<eos> Go on.<eos> You go.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Leave.<eos> - We'll try this again another time, okay?<eos> I'm disappointed in you, Doris.
- He probably votes more than you do.<eos> I am a conscientious objector.<eos> That's different.<eos> Oh, Roz, honestly, I just don't think this is this big a deal.<eos> You are not like them.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You were so supportive before.<eos> I'm having a rare moment of clarity.<eos> You're jealous because I'm having fun and doing things with others and not you.
But that was 15 years ago!<eos> Move the fuck on!<eos> You're telling me to move on?<eos> You have packets of duck sauce in your refrigerator from the 1970s.<eos> - It keeps. - Oh, honey.<eos> Darling, don't you see?<eos> You're just a weird little old lady in the funny clothes to them!<eos> You're like their weird fucking art project!<eos> - You take that back.<eos> - Doris, I'm worried about you.
Hey, hey.<eos> - Hey, Doris, you made it.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You look gorgeous.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Oh, I made a pie.<eos> - Nice.<eos> - John?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I would like to talk to you about something.
We miss you, Melvin.<eos> And those of us who are in prison, we hope that the food there does not suck.<eos> And let's give thanks for friends who are here instead of someplace else.<eos> Friends who have not abandoned us.<eos> Friends who have not betrayed us in our hour of need... and run off with some hot piece of whatever.<eos> And let's eat some turkey.<eos> - Let's.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, pretty lady.<eos> You know, I'm really excited to chat with you tonight.
I can't get through to her.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Doris.<eos> - Don't be so hard on her.<eos> - It's like somebody... stole my friend and replaced her with a wild animal... who stays up all night... and sleeps all day and wears too much makeup... and runs around with other wild animals.<eos> Let her be, Roz.<eos> Just let her be.<eos> Let her live her life.<eos> Besides, she's just a kid.<eos> John, I would like to talk to you for a minute, in the bedroom.
My dad's in the hospital.<eos> Shit.<eos> What happened?<eos> He had a stroke.<eos> They're trying to figure out how bad it is, but it's serious.<eos> That's hard. Not knowing.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I fucked up with my dad.<eos> I- - Oh, I really should not be talking to you about this.
- Yeah. Of course.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> - Hey-<eos> - Hey-<eos> I'm just getting here.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I can't meet you tonight.
I wanted to try again, you know, right away.<eos> But she said that she did not think I was ready to become a father.<eos> Why?<eos> She says I need to grow up.<eos> I'm too social, I'm too loud.<eos> I drink too much. I have a temper.<eos> I see you agree with her.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah. You do.<eos> No. I think she has a point, but I also think she kind of knew that when she married you.
How do you and Marco keep it together?<eos> You guys are, like, the best couple I know.<eos> Oh, we have problems too.<eos> No, you- - You always seem so relaxed around each other, you know?<eos> Like--<eos> I guess the secret is don't get married.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I thought you were going to the hospital.<eos> Meg's waiting in the car.<eos> I just wanted to check in with you before I left.
And we're the ones that have to deal with all the fallout.<eos> Do you ever wonder what I'm left dealing with?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm really happy you're here.<eos> I truly am.<eos> I'm so--<eos> - I think it's so good for Mom and Dad.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> That's nice.<eos> But I need to know if she can rely on you.
Vodka-cranberry, please.<eos> I hate seeing him like this, not knowing if he can understand us.<eos> It's late.<eos> You should let me take you home.<eos> Danny's picking me up.<eos> But you should go.<eos> You should be out with Marco, living your life.<eos> I am living my life.<eos> And I am choosing to be here with my parents.<eos> I'm worried about you, Meggy.
It's late.<eos> You should let me take you home.<eos> Danny's picking me up.<eos> But you should go.<eos> You should be out with Marco, living your life.<eos> I am living my life.<eos> And I am choosing to be here with my parents.<eos> I'm worried about you, Meggy.<eos> Mom, I'm fine.<eos> - Your father's worried about you too.
And he put you in an impossible situation.<eos> I don't wanna talk about it anymore.<eos> I do wanna talk about us.<eos> What you said the other night.<eos> I'm sorry for bringing it up.<eos> - No, don't be sorry.<eos> - No, really.<eos> We--<eos> We don't have to talk about it.<eos> I've been unfair to you.
Affirmative.<eos> In position.<eos> Philip, how can you be sure the boy is telling us the truth?<eos> I believe the kid.<eos> Don't you? You did the right thing coming to me, Robin.<eos> We'll get her back.<eos> Zero.<eos> Eyes on two targets.<eos> Bravo Three, what's your position?<eos> Coming to you.
Zero, you getting this?<eos> I've got a room full of girls here.<eos> Is Chloe there?<eos> That's a negative.<eos> Negative, Chloe's not here.<eos> Bravo One, follow Bravo Two.<eos> Go after that girl. No, bollocks!<eos> I'm not leaving them.<eos> Martinez, I need you in here.<eos> I need you to come help.
You held your nerve like no-one I'd ever seen.<eos> Yeah, well, I was different then.<eos> I didn't have Chloe.<eos> If you think we should keep going down this path, Phillip, then we keep going down this path.<eos> Sir, the North Korean delegation is waiting.<eos> Shall I have the Deputy Ambassador meet them?<eos> We'll wait here.<eos> It's taken me years to bring them to the table.<eos> What would I do without you?<eos> He looks up to you.
You know I do.<eos> Can't wait to debrief you later.<eos> Hmm.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, come on, he knows.<eos> You know, don't you, Mikey?<eos> What? You two?<eos> Since when?<eos> You two are wankers.<eos> And I'll talk to you later.
I don't give a fuck, let it go, all right?<eos> What?<eos> It's done, your done with her, it's done.<eos> Who is she dancing with?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Who cares, what are you talking about?<eos> Who gives a fuck?<eos> Let's go, all right?<eos> Electra!<eos> Electra, I wanna talk to you!
That's so sweet.<eos> This is like the essence of life.<eos> I think movies should contain that,<eos> Or should be made of that.<eos> Which is your favorite movie?<eos> 2001.<eos> What do you think of this movie?<eos> Oh, I really never saw.<eos> You've never seen 2001?<eos> What is wrong with you?
And so what's the point, To keep on fighting?<eos> For what?<eos> There's no hope, because, We should just commit suicide.<eos> I don't wanna say goodbye.<eos> What's the meaning of life?<eos> Love.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Murphy, what's yours?<eos> Electra.<eos> I wanna fuck you so much.
- Yeah.<eos> Let me get some sleep.<eos> A happy birthday, by the way.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Ah, come on.<eos> You taking this so seriously.<eos> Yeah it's a big deal.<eos> They're investing a lot of time and money into it.<eos> Yeah, and you're gonna be fine.<eos> I guess I can't do this whole apathetic thing as well as you do.
Anybody, anybody.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> Copy...<eos> Copy...<eos> Is this part of your plan, Walter?<eos> Hey Bug!<eos> Bug, is this urine?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you recycle it for me please?<eos> Bug, we're worried about you, okay?
I said I'm fine!<eos> I'll be right out!<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam?<eos> Sam?<eos> Hi Daddy.<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> Around.<eos> Hey did I tell you that I made it to the final round in that astronaut thing?<eos> Can I come with you?
She almost died! Alright?<eos> We're getting out of here.<eos> There's no way that we're leaving here.<eos> We're almost to the end.<eos> If you open up that hatch, we all lose!<eos> Don't you get it? It's all a simulation.<eos> For all we know, she could be faking it! Faking?<eos> All that data could have been pre-recorded.<eos> And as our captain, you should know that we should handle this on-board!<eos> I'm not going to sit here and debate with you.
I'll be your host, you hang tight, and my wife will bring your food out in a moment.<eos> Okay, what the hell is going on here?<eos> I'm not eating whatever he brings us.<eos> Isn't it odd that all of the street lights are on?<eos> Probably running on a generator.<eos> Yes, why?<eos> I mean, why waste all the power?<eos> It's dark, people need to see.<eos> I think they're meant to be seen from a distance.<eos> These people look familiar to you?
This is bullshit.<eos> - Shut up, you fucking prick.<eos> - You weren't there.<eos> - You know it. I know it.<eos> - Even he knows it.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - Can't tell me you believe this.<eos> - You don't know what the fuck--<eos> - John-<eos> - I'm not gonna talk to you!
All of them.<eos> At the same time.<eos> I'll clear your leave.<eos> Take as much time as you need.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Go and take care of your family.<eos> I have to go to Chicago, find Jimmy, bring him back here.<eos> Okay.<eos> I should only be gone a couple of days.<eos> You know, I can come with you if you want me to.
Can we get back to Jimmy?<eos> Oh, absolutely, boss.<eos> Uh, so what can I do?<eos> Call his friends.<eos> See if any of them have heard from him.<eos> We're gonna check out the bars in Bridgeport.<eos> Sure.<eos> Ooh, I forgot.<eos> Uh, baby's christening's on Saturday.<eos> Any chance you can make it?
Look, I know crap when I hear it, Stan.<eos> I am gonna kill Jimmy for getting you involved in this.<eos> Just stay out of it.<eos> Please?<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> Got to catch that.<eos> What's going on with Stan?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> That's what Jane was talking to you about at the lake --
He was there for Stan.<eos> Why'd you cover for him?<eos> Stan, he's -- he's working so hard to be good.<eos> Just wanted you to be proud of him.<eos> I am proud of him.<eos> I'm proud of all of you.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you call me when I got my electrician's license?<eos> You only call to yell at me, just like always.<eos> Look, I know I was tough on you when you were a kid, but come on.
After my mom died, I was the parent, and I left.<eos> Well, you felt trapped.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> Now Stan's life is a mess, Jimmy's got a gambling problem, and God only knows what Tommy's up to.<eos> Yeah, sure, look, t-they've got their problems.<eos> But they're good people.<eos> And they wouldn't even be here if you hadn't loved and protected them when they were kids.<eos> You're uncomfortable around them because you feel guilt.<eos> I understand that.<eos> But you need to know they're not mad at you.
I want to.<eos> Just enough to keep you from getting punched in the face again.<eos> I kind of thought you wouldn't mind seeing me get punched in the face.<eos> I'm the only one who gets to punch you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You want one?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Hey, I'm glad you made it out.<eos> It means a lot.<eos> And Karen's family was really impressed with you.

I'll think about it.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Nope, that's it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Thanks.<eos> No problem.<eos> Cho.<eos> Cho?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Can I come with you?
What can I do here?<eos> We need to put together a description of your attacker.<eos> I don't know if it was Gabriel or someone else who attacked me, and now Gabriel's gone.<eos> And Jane's inside.<eos> Go see him.<eos> Why?<eos> Just go.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> They want to check me out at the hospital, but Cho said to see you first.
I can throw her in a cell to cool off.<eos> I can't talk... Right now, Eric-<eos> - I'm busy.<eos> I'll be leaving at 6:00, To get ready for the miners party tonight.<eos> Right.<eos> Hello, fortitude police.<eos> Hello?<eos> Carrie?<eos> It's Ingrid.<eos> Do you remember me? We've been worried about you, sweetheart.
You'd tell me, wouldn't you, if people were saying things That made me look ridiculous?<eos> Eric.<eos> I'm talking about Eric.<eos> You don't need to go to this party.<eos> I can do it.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Markus said you managed to eat something.<eos> I'm glad you've got someone to care for you.<eos> I really am.<eos> But I care for you, too.
You have no right!<eos> Goddamn it, you have no fucking right!<eos> None!<eos> I came here to find a fucking killer!<eos> To find justice...<eos> that's all wrong.<eos> There's no justice in this fucking place.<eos> I'm gonna make us some dinner.<eos> We sit together... at the table... eat dinner.<eos> You at the head of the table.
A woman.<eos> Her nails on your back.<eos> No, no, not her nails.<eos> Hotter,<eos> - burning. - Yes.<eos> Burning. Burning my skin!<eos> A branding iron.<eos> You can enter now.<eos> Leave everything you were outside this door.<eos> Everything you are, bring with you.
The peasants pay me little for my craft.<eos> Fuck them.<eos> Worse than animals.<eos> Break its neck.<eos> Put those on the shelves by their like.<eos> Keep the nightshades together, yeah?<eos> Tell me about your mother.<eos> No. I'll tell you.<eos> She's dead.<eos> But she was very much like you.
He's awfully charming... but I think a little too sophisticated for me.<eos> Lily.<eos> We should think about getting away.<eos> - Away where?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Leave London.<eos> - Take a bit of a holiday.<eos> - Nonsense.<eos> I'm just getting used to the place, and you have so much more to teach me, don't you?<eos> I'm safe... here with you.
It's not personal... it's goods and services.<eos> I supply him with what he wants, he supplies me with what I want.<eos> It's tit for tat, Sir M.<eos> And what does he give you?<eos> No, Malcolm... us.<eos> Eternal life, eternal beauty.<eos> Such shallow pursuits.<eos> What value do they hold if we walk always alone?<eos> I've been too much alone... and this house is... so cold.<eos> But with you, I've found a kind of elation.
Shall we kill him?<eos> They're made for killing.<eos> I've experienced so many sensations over the years but never one precisely like this.<eos> Complete supremacy.<eos> Cruelty even.<eos> Ascendancy.<eos> Conquest.<eos> And him?<eos> Shall we murder him right now?<eos> Entirely up to you, darling.
Why would you catch monsters?<eos> To make money.<eos> Then why are you alone?<eos> Want to know?<eos> Yes.<eos> People who know too much about me... I'll have their tongue cut off.<eos> Where're you going?<eos> I'll sleep in my Grandma's room.<eos> Sheep with me.<eos> I stay here... so that I can sleep with you.
Niuniu may have gone to see the baby.<eos> Does any of you inside see Niuniu?<eos> Don't hit him.<eos> What's that?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> All good.<eos> Niuniu, you should come out.<eos> Wait.<eos> Oops, Madam faints again.<eos> What's wrong with you today?
We are running out of lime.<eos> I know.<eos> I am under a lot of pressure too.<eos> We will try our best.<eos> Let's try.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> We can't open this cage.<eos> You two should leave.<eos> Take care, and don't die.<eos> I'm not done arguing with you yet.
- It Does that seem fucked?<eos> There are ten thousand here.<eos> Let's go. We will leave.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Ten thousand!<eos> - What the hell are you?<eos> Ten thousand!<eos> Ten thousand!<eos> Ten thousand!<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
I want you to know.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Arise!<eos> Now!<eos> We have a robbery in progress.<eos> Shots were fired.<eos> It is the Bank 914.<eos> Unchecked!<eos> What the fuck ...?<eos> What is happening to you now?
Above!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Everybody down!<eos> Heavens!<eos> Get down!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Get down!<eos> What is this?<eos> Where did these people?<eos> Let me talk to you for a second.
Are you ready to die?<eos> Please save her.<eos> Save her.<eos> "Letustherefore, boldly to the throne of grace, formercy... andfindgraceto timely relief. "<eos> Hebrews 4:16.<eos> Campbell,donot.<eos> - Do not!<eos> - Campbell.<eos> Campbell back here!<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
Think about it.<eos> This weekend week will be on the beach.<eos> Do not?<eos> With whores and beers.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Please Rob not.<eos> I need you.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> My fucking fault!<eos> I'll go with you anytime.
Get out of here!<eos> Yes, it's checkmate for now.<eos> But I'll see you later.<eos> You can count on that.<eos> I went in and was at the cashier, and the girl came out of nowhere.<eos> The guard and I did not expect.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I must attend the call.<eos> Is my wife.<eos> - I will contact you.
Do you mind?<eos> Some of them prosthetics they got nowadays-- pretty good.<eos> Uh... I knew this guy who lost both of his hands at Guadalcanal.<eos> He was a cook at a fancy place in Asbury Park.<eos> He had these two hooks, and he could, uh, he could chop and dice and mix-- all that normal cook shit.<eos> Hey, you know what I was thinking about doing after I get this all straightened out?<eos> I'm gonna see if I can buy the show from Elsa.<eos> She's leaving, right?<eos> So I figured she'd sell it to me for cheap-- keep it in the family and all that.<eos> I'll go in on that with you.
Might want to go easy on that rouge.<eos> You look like you just marched out of The Nutcracker Suite.<eos> Nutcracker.<eos> Where does this one go?<eos> I told you, furs and gowns go in this trunk, and the costumes in that trunk.<eos> No!<eos> What?<eos> Eve, Eve.<eos> Does that look like a costume to you?<eos> Huh? Well, truthfully, sometimes it's hard to know with you.
You have to get him out of there.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> You have to get him out of there.<eos> Dell!<eos> You lied to Jimmy.<eos> About that night you came into my caravan.<eos> You told him you wanted to put an act together.<eos> Look, lady, I'm sorry about all that mess-<eos> - I really am--<eos> But I can't go round deal with you right now.
Yeah, it hurts like hell.<eos> Good.<eos> You never needed an assistant.<eos> We never had a real show before.<eos> This is our chance!<eos> You're constantly twisting what I say to fit your agenda.<eos> Stop putting words in my mouth!<eos> You...<eos> It's so wonderful how you throw your voice like that.<eos> Thank you. We needed to talk to you about something.
Sit.<eos> Settle yourself.<eos> We'll rub your shoulders.<eos> So you would... involve me?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> And we've heard it's many men's fantasy to be carnal with two girls at the same time.<eos> Hmm. Not his!<eos> Shut up.<eos> For Christ's sake,<eos> Chester, I can handle you sitting there like a dummy, but that puppet...
No, no.<eos> No.<eos> Stop hiding.<eos> I know you're just doing it to punish me.<eos> Looking for someone?<eos> My Marjorie is lost.<eos> No, she's not lost.<eos> She told me she's running away.<eos> You...<eos> Marjorie is very angry with you.
You're going to saw those twins in half.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Come with me.<eos> There's something I have to show you.<eos> Jesus, Desiree.<eos> Sit down, Dell.<eos> We got a lot to talk about.<eos> I'm not gonna talk about anything until you put that gun down.<eos> I'm glad you want to talk.<eos> I want to talk to you, too.
You think, after everything you've done, you think we're just gonna ride off into the sunset?<eos> My hands... are in a goddamn jar, and that's all because of you.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I'm gonna make it right with you and with them...<eos> I promise.<eos> You're gonna bring Ma Petite back from the dead?<eos> I've changed, Jimmy.<eos> If I was you...<eos> I'd get the hell out of Dodge before I get those new hands.<eos> I'm gonna make things right-- with them and with you!
If I had it all to do over again, believe me, I...<eos> I come in friendship.<eos> I'm well aware that I missed my chance.<eos> I'm not half the man you deserve.<eos> But I asked myself,<eos> "Dandy, what could you do to be of support to those beloved girls?"<eos> And it occurred to me, the one thing I can offer is protection, so I hired a proper gumshoe, and gathered all the information I could on your new beau.<eos> And it breaks my heart, but it appears your Chester Creb is an absolutely beastly sicko!<eos> We don't need to see that.<eos> What is wrong with you?
I, uh...<eos> I have a disease in my lungs, uh, that has gone into my bones.<eos> Uh, they say that I only have a month.<eos> And then I will be gone.<eos> And now there will be no one left, huh?<eos> Elsa?<eos> Leave me alone, Michael, I'm drinking.<eos> Hello, Elsa.<eos> You should have called, huh?<eos> I did not know you were bringing Mr. Gable home with you.
This sounds serious.<eos> Can I get you a drink, Mr. Gable?<eos> Could definitely use one.<eos> Now, why don't you tell me what this is all about?<eos> It seems Hedda Hopper got her hands on some eight millimeter films you shot back in Germany.<eos> The content-- how can I put this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Fakes, forgeries?<eos> It's not me.<eos> It looked a lot like you, Elsa.
What on earth are you doing?<eos> Broadening her musical horizons.<eos> This is awful. (MUSIC OFF)<eos> Awful?<eos> That's our song, in case you've forgotten.<eos> That is not our song.<eos> ~ You said it was your favourite.<eos> ~ When?<eos> ~ At the freshers' ball. ~ (WHINES)<eos> Which I didn't go to with you.
You did, and it's not lousy.<eos> I haven't even negotiated, we're already at 100 a year.<eos> All benefits and unlimited private jet travel.<eos> It's a flying limousine, Pete.<eos> You can have lunch in New York and be back for dinner.<eos> Good, because I live here.<eos> I have to go.<eos> - He wants to have dinner with wives.<eos> - No.<eos> He's only meeting with you and one other guy.
I want to start over.<eos> And I know I can.<eos> I'm not so dumb anymore.<eos> I'm not ignoring the fact that I could actually lose your love.<eos> You never lost it. But I will never allow you to hurt me again.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I always have.<eos> I've never loved anyone else.<eos> Never.<eos> You think you can come in here when I'm all disoriented and say the things I wanted you to say to me two years ago and make me run away with you?
Why was I ever doing it?<eos> "Dear Sally,<eos> I know that you're frightened and there are many decisions I can't prepare you for, but you must immediately tell the hospital and the funeral director that I'm to be interred intact in the family plot in West Laurel.<eos> Uncle William has the details from Grandpa Gene's burial.<eos> I've also enclosed a portrait from the 1968 Republican Winter Gala.<eos> The blue chiffon I wore is my very favorite.<eos> I hung it in a gold garment bag in the hall closet beside the mink.<eos> Please bring them the lipstick from my handbag and remind them how I like to wear my hair.<eos> Will you show them the picture?<eos> Sally, I always worried about you because you march to the beat of your own drum.
Easy.<eos> That painting is worth more than my car.<eos> James?<eos> This painting is alive.<eos> Nah.<eos> It's just the PCP talking.<eos> PCP?<eos> Well, I've seen many door girls in my day but this one...<eos> Look...<eos> I will go home with you tonight under two conditions. - Yes.
Bowie used one of these in Space Oddity.<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Holy cow!<eos> How do you ever leave this place?<eos> You'd be surprised at all the distractions that can come up.<eos> You were good out there, you know?<eos> - You really know how to work a crowd.<eos> - Thanks, man.<eos> You know what? Let's hear that track of yours again.<eos> You got it with you?
- Yeah, he should be.<eos> I'll let you in.<eos> Hey, babe.<eos> I was just taking a little nap.<eos> I know.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> I can't accept this.<eos> Oh, Christ. Put that back in your pocket.<eos> What do you think, I broke up with you?
Yeah, well, I actually feel terrific.<eos> Did you know Sophie moved to the Valley?<eos> North Hollywood.<eos> Is that a real place?<eos> She's making $6 espressos at a vegan café where they only serve Fairtrade organic.<eos> She's better off without me.<eos> Summerfest is coming up this Saturday.<eos> - Man, you really messed up on that one.<eos> - I didn't deserve it, anyway.<eos> What's wrong with you?
This is the safest place you could possibly be. Come on.<eos> There's someone i want you to meet.<eos> I'd like to introduce you To the newest member of our family,<eos> The little troublemaker all the fuss has been about.<eos> Camille... [door opens] This is hope.<eos> Oh, my god. What?<eos> You said-- i thought she was-- The only way to truly protect her<eos> Was to convince the world of her death.<eos> I hope you understand Once it's safe for you to leave here,<eos> Our secret cannot leave with you.
You said-- i thought she was-- The only way to truly protect her<eos> Was to convince the world of her death.<eos> I hope you understand Once it's safe for you to leave here,<eos> Our secret cannot leave with you.<eos> She's perfect.<eos> Now that we've entombed our mother, I intend to finish making the city safe for hope, Which to start means dealing<eos> Once he figures out what you've done to your mother, He's gonna go off the deep end.<eos> That's exactly why we need to keep you out of harm's way. Hayley and i will return home<eos> And take care of my wayward brother.<eos> Elijah will remain here with you.
With mortal enemies-- Drink and hopefully blow off a little steam.<eos> Rebekah, it's me again.<eos> Please call.<eos> Yahtzee! Ha ha! If there's one thing i've learned about you people<eos> It's that there's always a bottle of booze around.<eos> You want one?<eos> Sounds delightful, And after that, camille, then what?<eos> We have another, then another,<eos> Perhaps another after that, another after that?<eos> Before long, i find myself opening up to you Or bearing my damaged soul, as it were?
With you from the very beginning.<eos> I love you, hayley.<eos> I think i always have. Jack. No.<eos> I-i know we're only doing this<eos> When we sold our souls for those damn rings, Ok, but i-i loved you before i knew you, And every moment that i spend with you,<eos> Every single thing that i learn about you<eos> Just makes me love you even more.<eos> I promise that we will turn this around for our pack.<eos> We'll save our friends from whatever hell We've dragged them into, And that is the only thing that i can ask from you...<eos> And forcing you to love me isn't gonna be one of them...
He said he'd tell me where to meet him later, but listen.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I got to give him something.<eos> He's killing one of my guys every hour until he gets it.<eos> I need to call Klaus.<eos> You come simpering for brotherly love, and the whole time, you're plotting against me with that damn dagger.<eos> You're no better than Finn.<eos> Ah, and you threatening me makes you better than Finn, does it?<eos> The both of you just stop it.<eos> I came to you because you're my family, but I see whilst you and Rebekah and Elijah all hang portraits and share secrets, I'm the odd one out.
I want your word.<eos> This is between me and you.<eos> Why, of course.<eos> You have my word as a gentleman.<eos> Brave lad.<eos> Klaus!<eos> You wanna fight me?<eos> Come on!<eos> You mistake my intentions.<eos> I haven't come here to fight you.
After all, that's what wolves do.<eos> You don't know a damn thing about being a wolf.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I never had the luxury to live among my kind nor the chance to truly know my father.<eos> But you knew him.<eos> Perhaps he saw in you the son he always wanted.<eos> I'm glad I was spared such a sorry fate.<eos> I'm convinced.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> Which means whatever Klaus is keeping secret is so secret he won't share it with you.
You don't know?<eos> Do you have a license?<eos> Think that's funny?<eos> Driving without a license is serious.<eos> He could've hit someone.<eos> You wouldn't be laughing then.<eos> You're the one who's liable.<eos> If your son injures someone, you'll pay millions in damages.<eos> - It's not her fault.<eos> - I'll hear you later.
Behind bars you get nothing.<eos> All you learn there is hatred.<eos> Don't you deserve better?<eos> You've never given yourself a chance.<eos> Now you get one.<eos> Then give me your cell phone.<eos> No cell phones here.<eos> I gotta talk to Mom and Toni.<eos> You can call them twice a week.<eos> - If I gotta talk to you?
Find me a tattoo job, I'd get up.<eos> You can't even draw.<eos> Wake up, you dork.<eos> You're useless with your hands.<eos> You're just good for swiping cars.<eos> And what can you do?<eos> Nothing for me.<eos> You're the judge's poodle.<eos> You shit where she says to.<eos> What do we do with a kid like you?
It's been a rough day.<eos> He took me back. I can't come now.<eos> When? Dunno.<eos> I got them on a string.<eos> You said before Christmas.<eos> We'll see.<eos> I miss you.<eos> Do you miss me, too?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Can I sleep with you tonight?
Cell walls won't help him see clearly at an age of searching, of finding oneself.<eos> I ask you, Your Honor, to place him in a Juvenile Detention Center and not follow the DA's request.<eos> Very well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You are entitled to the last word.<eos> Please leave for a few minutes while I make my decision.<eos> Keep the young man under guard.<eos> Whereas...<eos> Tess called me.<eos> She couldn't reach you.
What do you know about it?<eos> Fits the description, right?<eos> My people know him.<eos> He's not with us.<eos> Amphetamine freak.<eos> Bragged about it, said, well, matched your wife's account.<eos> How do you know my wife's account?<eos> This is only information, man.<eos> Shit in the air.<eos> I'm sharing with you.
You tell me the name of that kid, Chad.<eos> I'm gonna count to three.<eos> One, two...<eos> Aspen.<eos> Aspen Conroy.<eos> Aspen?<eos> That's a boy's name?<eos> - Chad.<eos> - God damn it, Ray.<eos> What the hell is the matter with you?
Anyone at all?<eos> No.<eos> Jamie, I'm sorry. I should have called.<eos> I wouldn't have answered.<eos> Angela, there was a shooting tonight at the club.<eos> Some woman got in with a gun.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Jamie, are you...<eos> - I'm okay. But a waitress got hit and I don't know if she'll make it.<eos> There's no way I'll be able to go with you to Miami tonight, I'm sorry.
We should be tan.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I was thinking it, too.<eos> It's like everything I put together, it was all gone in one night.<eos> I'm so sorry this happened.<eos> I know how much the club means to you.<eos> I wish I could help.<eos> This helps.<eos> Being here with you like this.
You said.<eos> He's gonna leave town with her.<eos> He's probably calling you from fucking Brazil. I don't know.<eos> It's all fucked up and I can't trust him right now.<eos> I can't trust nobody.<eos> Except Holly.<eos> If you trust that girl so much, where is she?<eos> I don't know. I'm looking for her everywhere.<eos> I called her cell like 100 times.<eos> Maybe she don't want to talk to you.
Stop, Ghost.<eos> Just stop.<eos> I saw the bags in Angela's apartment.<eos> What the fuck you doing in Angela's apartment?<eos> Shut the fuck up, Ghost.<eos> You were leaving with her.<eos> Deny it.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> We were going to Miami.<eos> It had nothing to do with you.
"Bold-faced"?<eos> Bold.<eos> Tell me about your night.<eos> Well... You left me, so I hung out with Jessica and she was making out with this guy.<eos> That's very nice.<eos> Yeah, and then... The party was shit.<eos> Everyone left. It was dying.<eos> It was boring, so Jess asked for a ride home,<eos> - I gave her a ride home...<eos> - You drove? And then, I came to see you.
Wait, why didn't you come back here last night?<eos> I had texted you and you didn't respond.<eos> I didn't want to wake you up.<eos> Are you going to the record label?<eos> But I don't think they're gonna need me for that long, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> Can we hang out when you're done with class?<eos> Hey, was that party any fun last night after I left?<eos> No, it was stupid.<eos> I should've just left with you.
It's not that fucking big of a deal.<eos> Please, just calm down, okay?<eos> Yeah, I was about two years old.<eos> Very nice, guys.<eos> Very nice.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Mel, I can't understand anything you're saying.<eos> I don't...<eos> What the fuck, Mel?<eos> You call me, you say you're at my house, and you're crying and I have to fuckin' leave and come get you, and, now, you don't want to talk to me?
Okay, do you... you want my real answer?<eos> Yeah.<eos> 'Cause my real answer is that you need to make this decision about you, not Mel and not this relationship.<eos> Honey, I know how special it is with you and Mel.<eos> You're family to each other and we all are, we're all family.<eos> And I love her.<eos> This is nothing against Mel.<eos> But I am telling you this is a great opportunity and I know you want it.<eos> I know you do.<eos> And, honestly, if I could tell you anything that was valuable... And I'm talking to you as an adult, now... That if...
- No, the job you wanted was here in Austin.<eos> - I just want you to be happy for me.<eos> This is what we planned for.<eos> It's not as if things always happen according to plan.<eos> Well, it's not like you can just make the changes.<eos> Can't you be a little bit flexible, please?<eos> Well, can't you decide something that's not just for yourself?<eos> Why can't you think about me?<eos> All you think about is yourself and all the things you want.<eos> You're saying I'm being selfish and like I try and talk to you about this and you just flip out!
You flip out at any conversation of me not being with you...<eos> It's not a conversation!<eos> You flip out.<eos> I can't believe you're... You didn't want to see me for two weeks.<eos> You just kicked me aside.<eos> You ignored me!<eos> I did not kick you aside.<eos> I asked for space! And you couldn't respect that, in the slightest.<eos> You flipped out.<eos> It's like you need me and, if I'm not with you all the time, you're gonna fall apart.
Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God, I fucking love this record. So fucking good.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> I have to go.<eos> See you later?<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> Come on.<eos> You fucking asshole!<eos> - Stop! Stop! - What the fuck is wrong with you?
We had a problem with one of the barrels.<eos> How long is "a bit"?<eos> Er... five, maybe ten minutes.<eos> Hannah was quite young to be a pub landlady, wasn't she?<eos> She inherited The Green Man when her dad died.<eos> I think she struggled at first, but... .. she was determined to make it work.<eos> Hannah was the one good thing that's ever happened to me.<eos> (Sighs) I want to walk back.<eos> I need some air.<eos> I'll come with you.
I think she struggled at first, but... .. she was determined to make it work.<eos> Hannah was the one good thing that's ever happened to me.<eos> (Sighs) I want to walk back.<eos> I need some air.<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> Someone needs to go in the car, since my mother has bothered to wait.<eos> I'd like some time alone with my wife, if that's OK, Theo?<eos> ~ She'll be cross now.<eos> ~ No, she won't.<eos> Not with you, with me.
I can't go to a party.<eos> Why not?<eos> I just think it would be better if we both stayed at home tonight.<eos> Magnus, you can't give up on this.<eos> Two people, one of them my curate, have died in the most horrible of circumstances.<eos> And I'm very sorry.<eos> But somebody has to try and save St Cyprian's.<eos> It's what Andrew would have wanted.<eos> If we lose this church, you'll be sent to a different parish.<eos> And I won't be going with you.
I've got a shit-ton of heroin I need you to sell.<eos> - Are you out of your mind, inmate? - Hey.<eos> You're asking me to sell narcotics?<eos> I'm a Federal Corrections Officer.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> - We're gonna go to Caputo's office...<eos> - No!<eos> ...you're gonna tell him exactly what you told me, every word, even that weird Al Gore thing.<eos> Okay, look, Luschek, you must've misunderstood me, all right?<eos> I'm fucking with you.
- Yeah. I need to stop taking nuts from nutbags.<eos> All right.<eos> It's time to right my wrongs.<eos> N-no, no, no.<eos> That's... not what I said.<eos> I don't care what you want.<eos> I'm not fucking wearing it.<eos> Why do you have to be such a bitch all the time?<eos> Because you're such a good role model.<eos> Do you want the kids to make fun of you?
'Cause licking gravy boats has kind of been your whole thing.<eos> And Reverend Lawlor, he's got a lot of opinions.<eos> Okay, look. Nobody is talking about conceding my hard-earned position as lord of the lesbians.<eos> I'm just embracing the gray areas to make a buck.<eos> Black and white, that's for zebras and Michael Jackson.<eos> Wait, ain't he dead?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Here you go, sister.<eos> In lieu of a mattress.<eos> Oh. Pleasure doing business with you.
- Rum and coke, right?<eos> I'm very intuitive.<eos> - It's my favorite.<eos> - Oh? It tastes like vacation in a cup.<eos> That was the stupidest thing I've ever said.<eos> - My name's Carrie.<eos> - Tracy.<eos> Tracy.<eos> Well, it is nice to meet you.<eos> I'm having such a good time with you.
"You Wouldn't Like Me," Tegan and Sara.<eos> - "The Pussy is Mine," Miguel.<eos> - Miguel.<eos> This is so nice, and so gay.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Mr. Caputo, I need to speak to you.<eos> I'm sure it's something your counselor would be happy to assist you with, inmate.<eos> It's about one of your guards.<eos> As you can see, I am very busy at the moment, so I will make every effort to try and find you tomorrow.
- Now!<eos> I'm so done with this depressing-ass place.<eos> Marisol, get out here and get to work.<eos> I just really miss you.<eos> I'm so jealous.<eos> Oh, baby, it's work.<eos> And it's fuckin' Kesha.<eos> You're not missing anything.<eos> Seriously.<eos> When you gonna let me sell with you?
We would be living lesbian stereotypes.<eos> We could stop shaving and start camping.<eos> We could go to... golf tournaments.<eos> No?<eos> No. No golf.<eos> Who's that girl?<eos> - She's not in orange, so she's not new. - Hmm.<eos> I've never seen her before, and then today twice in one day.<eos> It's a prison phenomenon.<eos> It's like when you think you've seen everyone, you suddenly notice that there's a girl with a port wine birthmark on her face that has been working with you in electrical since you got here and you'd never seen her before.
Fucking nobodies.<eos> Your budget is $800,000...<eos> Marisol, turn that down, I can't think.<eos> How much thinking you gotta do with that shit?<eos> Go straight, then turn.<eos> Many private islands in the Keys sell for over $10 million.<eos> Ugh. I do everything around here.<eos> - Marisol Gonzales?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah.<eos> What's your favorite anime?<eos> Oh, it's very obscure, you probably haven't heard of it.<eos> It's this animal-human hybrid thing.<eos> It's by an artist named Dayanara Diaz.<eos> It's really out there.<eos> I'll have to check it out.<eos> I like you, Lorna.<eos> And I like you, too, Ron.<eos> I'll be honest with you, the last girl I met in this prison pen pal thing turned out to be... a little heavier.
Hey, I don't make the rules.<eos> You take a woman's power away.<eos> Her work, her family, her currency.<eos> You leave her with one coin... the one she was born with.<eos> It may be tawdry and demeaning, but if she has to, she will spend it.<eos> But you're right.<eos> Your feelings count, too.<eos> I mean, you couldn't give a guy a heads-up on this fiasco?<eos> I got cos up my ass like a lemon-juice enema.<eos> Oh, like your mom never did it to you?
- Fine.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Shabbat shalom, bitch.<eos> How much longer you gonna stay mad?<eos> Man, do you know how hard it is to get a squirrel into a laundry bag?<eos> No.<eos> I took it a little too far, hooch jacking you.<eos> But you was pissin' and setting' traps like Elmer Fudd.<eos> Man, the shit was funny.<eos> But also, I was worried about you.
- Yeah.<eos> Shabbat shalom, bitch.<eos> How much longer you gonna stay mad?<eos> Man, do you know how hard it is to get a squirrel into a laundry bag?<eos> No.<eos> I took it a little too far, hooch jacking you.<eos> But you was pissin' and setting' traps like Elmer Fudd.<eos> Man, the shit was funny.<eos> But also, I was worried about you.<eos> Well, you know, if I was worried about you, I'd have made you some goddamn soup or something.
This about to be a headband. Yeah.<eos> Check it. Check it.<eos> Inmate.<eos> That's official whispers merchandise.<eos> If you make any more mistakes, we're gonna take the full retail price out of your pay.<eos> Oh, what is that?<eos> Like, 100 hours of work for 25 cents of fabric?<eos> Zip it, Hayes, or that's a shot.<eos> This is not coffee hour. And there are plenty of bodies in here that would be happy to fill those seats.<eos> What am I supposed to do with you?
He ain't come yet.<eos> And Norma is bullshit.<eos> It's people like that that give religion a bad name.<eos> Uh, Doggett.<eos> You're Doggett, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, hey. I'm Charlie.<eos> Hey.<eos> New here.<eos> So they told me to tell you that we need to take the van into town to the hardware store, and I'm gonna go with you, if that's okay.
Round-eyed Asian with blond hair?<eos> I'm Ukrainian.<eos> I'm making a joke.<eos> You know, it wouldn't kill you to smile once in a while.<eos> It's not like I'm asking you to sleep in my bed... or bring me back leftovers of Lasagna Classico... which you pay for with my money, which you know I enjoy, which you never finish!<eos> "I don't want to be a fat person."<eos> You know what?<eos> I had a really good day today.<eos> I had a really good day today.<eos> And I just wanted to come home and share it with you... and you don't care.
--Like King Wangchuck of Bhutan.<eos> He created the Gross National Happiness scale so his people would be content and remain loyal.<eos> And how did that work out for him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's no such thing as a benevolent dictator, only a weak one, or a dead one.<eos> He did not die.<eos> He abdicated voluntarily.<eos> You know what I mean. You're letting the fox back into the hen house.<eos> You dumped me because I fired Flaca, and now you're criticizing me for bringing her back.<eos> I broke up with you because you were being gross, and now you're being stupid.
-Ah. She's getting out and wanted to give me something to remember her by.<eos> I was sad, so I let her.<eos> White ink, huh?<eos> That must be pretty intimidating to some of these girls, maybe under, like, a black light or something.<eos> -What does it say?<eos> -It says "Trust no bitch."<eos> And yes, as a matter of fact, the girls are scared shitless.<eos> I'm quite gangsta.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What? I have to give you honesty, because that's how I need to live, in truth.
You want... You want me to get a little rough?<eos> Is that it?<eos> A little roleplay?<eos> You into that?<eos> Something's really wrong, like, like my Nancy Grace ears catnip.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yes, something's...<eos> It's like my Nancy Grace ears catnip bluegrass funeral.<eos> Tiff, are you okay?<eos> What's the matter with you?
And as groom and bride prepared for this ceremony, they reflected on what it is that brought them here today, ready to commit their lives to one another.<eos> You have your vows, yes?<eos> Groom goes first.<eos> "Lorna, - I cannot believe we are doing this.<eos> In fact, I think we might be crazy.<eos> But we are crazy together.<eos> We fit, and we match and I think you are beautiful... and you make me feel tall.<eos> --And I love your heart."<eos> You're good, Lorna.<eos> "I cannot wait to spend every day that I am allowed to with you, and then when you are out, just every day."
Ah! Say it.<eos> Say it!<eos> You're the man. Oh, you're the man!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - Ew. - Gross.<eos> Your place depresses me.<eos> The walls are sticky with loneliness.<eos> I'm disgusted with myself... every time.<eos> Why am I fucking you?
'Cause this was just so itchy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey... now you gotta really get me the Vagisil.<eos> You know, like, so we can... You know, just to cover up, 'cause...<eos> On it.<eos> Yo, where are my donuts?<eos> Not today.<eos> Girl, did I not tell you to suck a dick and get me some goodies?<eos> Chop-chop, little lady.<eos> Hey... what's the matter with you?
I'm gonna move back in with my parents.<eos> I already asked for more shifts at Paddy's.<eos> I'm staying here.<eos> I'm gonna take care of you and this baby.<eos> I'll tell them right now.<eos> You stay and Hank goes?<eos> Joey, why would you do that?<eos> It makes no sense.<eos> I love you.<eos> I wanna marry you.
Just, you know, check out, go to your happy place.<eos> I'll be quick.<eos> Stop that.<eos> And maybe I'll sodomize you while I'm at it.<eos> You know, stick a hairbrush up your ass.<eos> Hold you down, pull your hair, maybe bite your neck.<eos> Wouldn't that be fun?<eos> You might like that.<eos> Why don't you try it, huh? Why don't you try that?<eos> Just let me have my fucking way with you.
No offense, but fuck you... sir.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> I think we need a plan B.<eos> Are you pussying out on me right now?<eos> Look, if being a pussy is not wanting to eat rats in SHU, then...<eos> No one's going to SHU...<eos> Louder.<eos> Remember how I was in the Puppy Program?<eos> Well, see, I may have palmed a doggie sedative, or four, that I have been keeping as a treat for myself in case I would like to fake a seizure, go on a vacation to a hospital and touch nurses.<eos> Do you see, this is how much I care about you, Doggett.
You will, one day.<eos> Ain't no way around that.<eos> But this here, this is life coming out of you.<eos> Kind of like pee.<eos> Don't be scared.<eos> All it means is you ain't a little grubber no more.<eos> Now you're like a case of pop.<eos> You got value.<eos> Look, there's some things you gotta know.<eos> Now that you're a-tittin' and a-hairin', boys are gonna see you different, and pretty soon, they're gonna do you different.
His phone that was locked in my desk drawer.<eos> You broke into your mother's desk?<eos> She can't take my shit.<eos> It's mine.<eos> Do you see that?<eos> Hey, nothing is yours.<eos> You live by the grace of me.<eos> Michael, look at me.<eos> This behavior of yours is unacceptable.<eos> I don't know what's going on with you, but you need to get your act together right now.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> I was beginning to think it was all men, honestly.<eos> God, Lorna, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Now, you know, I'm gonna deny saying that to my friends.<eos> You know, I can't have them thinking I'm a pussy.<eos> - I'm kidding, right? I'm kidding.<eos> - Right, right, I get it.<eos> - I'm fucking with you.
You've been following me all over this fucking place... tracking me.<eos> And then lying about it.<eos> But, yeah, I'll leave you alone... - Hey. - You crazy, psychotic bitch.<eos> I knew he fucking sent you.<eos> This ain't your bathroom.<eos> - Ours is crowded.<eos> - So?<eos> So, I needed a mirror, and it's a free country.<eos> You're living in a different country than me then.<eos> I don't wanna fight with you.
Get the fuck away from her!<eos> What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> This whole place is completely bugged.<eos> They've been gathering information on me and they're trying to frame me for treason and for terrorism.<eos> The NSA?<eos> Yeah, so please, help me. Please, help me.<eos> Please, I know...<eos> I know you're one of 'em.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Hey, I'll work with you, okay?
- No, ten more minutes.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Ten more minutes, please.<eos> My dad said I gotta be packed by the morning.<eos> This place is gonna be so stupid when you're gone.<eos> - No, it won't.<eos> - Yeah, it will.<eos> How far is Wyoming?<eos> Far.<eos> Take me with you... please?
Ella knows me.<eos> No.<eos> You need to stay here.<eos> Take Saul then, she knows him.<eos> I don't know her.<eos> Sure you do.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> Saul!<eos> Do as I say.<eos> He goes with you.
Take Saul then, she knows him.<eos> I don't know her.<eos> Sure you do.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> Saul!<eos> Do as I say.<eos> He goes with you.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Both will go with you.
Everything can't be as perfect as you said.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> No, you're pretending to be fine.<eos> But how could you after what we did?<eos> That's enough group therapy for me.<eos> Connor, unless we all start talking, We are all gonna fall apart, And that is exactly how we're gonna end up in jail.<eos> I got back together with kan. I am trying to get over frank.<eos> I saw my family over the break. It was the worst thing ever.<eos> So I actually missed you guys.<eos> You -- what's going on with you?
No, I can't do this anymore.<eos> What?<eos> I think we should postpone the wedding.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> No, no!<eos> Don't -- don't do this.<eos> I swear I'll do anything you want.<eos> Just don't -- don't do this.<eos> I love you. I want to marry you, and you want to marry me.
We are interrupting ourselves, or allowing ourselves Be interrupted by a series of information And what would, in any other context,<eos> If I leave my phone in my pocket and it is in vibration mode, Unconsciously, I'll move when it vibrates.<eos> And I even move when it did not vibrate but I thought it vibrated.<eos> And that ruins a conversation.<eos> Like, those nanoseconds of distraction, I think they have a very damaging effect.<eos> Everywhere I look, are small constant movements.<eos> This anticipation of novelty has the effect of turning us into laboratory mice that simply are pressed.<eos> Meditation is a great antidote to this.<eos> The people here on ABC News asked me "Why are you meditating?"<eos> In other words: "What's wrong with you?"
- You don't.<eos> Ride out the clock.<eos> Stay miserable.<eos> I've got news for you.<eos> The next chapter is not that long.<eos> - Wait, is that why you got the Cialis?<eos> - Everyone gets Cialis at my age.<eos> You probably should sleep in the den.<eos> Grace?<eos> Can I talk to you for a second, please?
What am I gonna tell my kids?<eos> Why don't you start with, "Do you know where poop comes from?"<eos> How am I in trouble right now?<eos> Sorry, Dad.<eos> Look, I'm sorry you had to find out this way and I know it's a shock, - but... honestly, it was killing me.<eos> This is why I didn't want to talk about it yet.<eos> I didn't want to fall apart in front of you.<eos> It's okay, Mom.<eos> It's a fall apart kind of a thing.<eos> Daddy, we'll come talk to you in a little bit.
- My Skeflaxin.<eos> That's not a word.<eos> No, it's medicine.<eos> My back's in spasm.<eos> I can't move.<eos> It's totally harshing my buzz.<eos> Where are they?<eos> In the meditation room in the pill basket next to my shrine.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be right with you.
That is the worst iced tea ever.<eos> What is in there?<eos> Ass? Peyote.<eos> - Peyo-tea.<eos> - What?<eos> I just took muscle relaxers with peyote?<eos> - And you're welcome.<eos> - What do I do? You should probably brace yourself for some light vomiting followed by life-altering hallucinations.<eos> Just let it all out.<eos> This is why I hate being around you!
You wanna sit with us?<eos> You supposed to be drinking?<eos> No, I'm supposed to be dead.<eos> Kind of hard to care about things like drinking.<eos> You know what I like about you and me, Danny, is that we can lay all our cards on the table.<eos> You know, there's no bullshit.<eos> What's going on, Pop'?<eos> Well... I want you to go.<eos> I want you to leave and not come back.<eos> It's never worked out with you being here, has it?
I'm sorry.<eos> - You're okay?<eos> - Yes, thank you, Marco.<eos> Take care of my girl.<eos> Hey, come over here.<eos> Hey, Meg, is everything okay?<eos> - You need to stop.<eos> - I heard about your father.<eos> I've been trying to reach you.<eos> I told you I cannot talk to you right now.
- Yes, thank you, Marco.<eos> Take care of my girl.<eos> Hey, come over here.<eos> Hey, Meg, is everything okay?<eos> - You need to stop.<eos> - I heard about your father.<eos> I've been trying to reach you.<eos> I told you I cannot talk to you right now.<eos> I just wanna make sure you're okay.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
- How could I follow that?<eos> - You don't fucking believe that.<eos> - You're full of shit.<eos> - It was beautiful.<eos> You are so full of shit.<eos> That was disgusting.<eos> That was horrible, man.<eos> My father would've fucking hated it.<eos> It would've killed him.<eos> Hey, I danced with you one time.
- It's been a while.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Got an old case to check on, if that's all right.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Morning.<eos> I'm headed back north.<eos> I just wanted to say goodbye.<eos> - Okay. Mom is in the house.<eos> - I wanted to talk to you, I--
It's not about my condition.<eos> I went to the Military School for Independence.<eos> Get me my Thompson and the bombs Duk-sam left.<eos> And close the cafe tomorrow, you stay out of sight.<eos> Miss!<eos> What are you doing at this hour?<eos> There are only two nights left before your wedding.<eos> Get a good night's sleep.<eos> I will.<eos> Oh, and I found the girl who looks just like you.
The witness is dead!<eos> Due to a lack of evidence, the charges leveled against defendant Yem Sek-jin are formally dismissed.<eos> He gets a 20,000 won fine for contempt of court.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Attention, salute!<eos> Congratulations, sir!<eos> I'll drive you home. No, no.<eos> It's a beautiful world.<eos> I'd like to walk.<eos> Then I'll join you.
Please, please.<eos> - What are you doing here, man?<eos> - I ha-I have nowhere to go, OK?<eos> They will kill me.<eos> Well, move fast and get away from here.<eos> Go on.<eos> - Get out of here.<eos> - No.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I have done everything I can do for you.
We?<eos> I guess that'd be me, sir. I hired the wrong team for the Afghani job.<eos> Shut up, Colt.<eos> We need to sort this shit out.<eos> Get Van Horn on the phone.<eos> Look, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.<eos> The Afghani job was going smoothly.<eos> Until three of my men, all of a sudden, got jumped, in a bar.<eos> Well, that sounds like a bad day, all around, now, doesn't it?<eos> Do you have any idea how quickly I can get rid of you and your men?
- Alright, listen, I'm gonna give you this.<eos> - John, no, please.<eos> Just listen to me and do what I say.<eos> That was the deal we made.<eos> Take this. Go on.<eos> Point it and you shoot.<eos> Stay in the car.<eos> Don't get out of the car for nothin', you hear me?<eos> So, I finally get to meet, Chi.<eos> And I finally get to meet you, Van Horn.
- What secret?<eos> - Yeah, your little secret, bitch.<eos> You know, the one that you recorded on your camera, that you always record on your camera?<eos> All the bad habits that you have and you record on your camera.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I wanna see you in person.<eos> I wanna see you in person.<eos> You know?<eos> That'll be good for business, won't it?<eos> Be good for you, good for me.
I wanna see you in person.<eos> You know?<eos> That'll be good for business, won't it?<eos> Be good for you, good for me.<eos> Yeah, I'm good with that.<eos> What about my nightclub, two hours.<eos> - Right back where it all started.<eos> - Fuck you, bitch.<eos> John.<eos> I got something for you.
Lord Tian is here.<eos> Come here, boys!<eos> Sit.<eos> All of you.<eos> Rise!<eos> Clear this away.<eos> Reporting, sir!<eos> Commander Tian reached his post.<eos> And Provost Nie is recovering from his wounds.<eos> He remains weak, but will report to you himself tomorrow.
You want more of this, brother?<eos> Or maybe the sports page?<eos> "Game Six of the World Series went scoreless for 13 innings before a rain delay that turned an already epic evening into one for the history books."<eos> We need a doctor in room three-one.<eos> Douglas?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> I want you to blink if you can hear me.<eos> Again.<eos> My name is Dr. Lanjwani.<eos> The president's office asked me to look after you personally.
How's your mood been?<eos> Any episodes?<eos> No. The meds are working.<eos> You just telling me what I want to hear? No.<eos> I feel good.<eos> Okay. I'm gonna sign your release today.<eos> But it's important you take it easy at first.<eos> Everything's gonna be much harder in general.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you have someone who can look after you?
You want me to go?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thanks for everything.<eos> Okay. I mean, I'm just a phone call and a plane ticket away.<eos> Safe travels.<eos> Uh... Take care.<eos> Hey, Gary, I...<eos> Send me some pictures of the kids.<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> But one of the things I admire about you is that in Washington, DC, which is so gridlocked, you get things done.
Not by linking arms with the president's wife.<eos> If I'm a disaster, it makes for a good campaign ad.<eos> If I do a good job, nobody can fault you.<eos> Either way, it doesn't hurt your chances in 2016.<eos> Well, I appreciate you coming by before going public.<eos> It is classy, and thoughtful.<eos> I won't actively block you.<eos> The rest is on your shoulders.<eos> Thank you, Senator.<eos> Tell the president I'm doing this out of respect to you.
Sure, what about?<eos> About the damn bomb in my truck, Harold.<eos> I-I don't know anything about this.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Don't make me subdue you again, Harold.<eos> Next time, I won't be so gentle.<eos> He tripped and fell.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Franklin made the bomb, and you or somebody who works for you planted it in my truck.
To help us extract meaning from these conventions, two of America's most eloquent and most decided commentators have joined us this year.<eos> They are Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley, Jr.<eos> Can Mr. Vidal assess the Republicans for us?<eos> Can a political party based almost entirely upon human greed nominate anyone for President for whom a majority of the American people would vote?<eos> May I comment, Mr. Smith?<eos> - Please do. - Yeah.<eos> It seems to me that the author of Myra Breckinridge is well acquainted with the imperatives of human greed.<eos> Well, I would like to say, Bill, if I may--<eos> If I may say, Bill, before you go any further, I would like to say if there were a contest for Mr. Myra Breckinridge you would unquestionably win it.<eos> I based her entire style polemically upon you:
Father was from the frontier.<eos> We didn't belong to Long Island society, nor did we wish to.<eos> This has always been an anti-intellectual country.<eos> These days, anybody who spoke like those two men in public would be seen to be heartless.<eos> In fact, they're supposed to be what American mass audience despises.<eos> They're intellectual.<eos> They sound like elites.<eos> But people warmed to it.<eos> Mr. Buckley, do you think miniskirts are in good taste?<eos> On you I think they are.
Every painter has a flashlight.<eos> I imagine most people do.<eos> I don't know where it went.<eos> I'm sure it'll turn up.<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> He was right here.<eos> Not there?<eos> It kind of looks the same in the dark.<eos> Did you have a flashlight?<eos> Is this a game to you?
You're looking good.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Take care, Larry.<eos> - See you, buddy.<eos> The strawberries are really plump.<eos> I bet you they're organic.<eos> - I'm so sorry. So sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I ran right into you.
- You too.<eos> Hello?<eos> Is anybody out there? Hello?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Ah, great.<eos> Hey, buddy, you think you could see if there's a... a roll of toilet paper in one of these stalls? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure.<eos> Oh, thanks, man.<eos> What was that?<eos> Uh, I got a nice big roll for you.
- That's a good idea.<eos> Creating a distraction.<eos> Yeah, I wasn't even thinking about that.<eos> - Then they'll just, you know...<eos> - What a good idea.<eos> - Yes, it's a distraction. - Yeah.<eos> - That's what we need.<eos> - Yeah, it's... it's not going take time to distract a bunch of hipsters.<eos> Just put on some Weezer or Grizzly Bear and they'll be distracted like that, you know?<eos> Look at you, so cool.
Okay.<eos> So what happens, you know, what?<eos> Am I just gonna, like, say everything I wanna say and do everything I wanna do?<eos> - And then...<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because I have responsibilities, I have things to keep up, and I've made commitments to people...<eos> - So you lie.<eos> So that's good.<eos> - And, yeah, so I lie.<eos> And that makes you happy.
- Daddy. Honey.<eos> Pull, pull, pull.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Yeah. Yeah. See?<eos> That's going nowhere.<eos> - Daddy, really?<eos> - That hair is locked in.<eos> You have the stuff? - No.<eos> Well, your mother does.<eos> We have a surprise for you.
And you got this salt-and pepper-vibe.<eos> It's... it's really cool.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Can I ask you a question, David?<eos> Sure.<eos> Are we good?<eos> Are we, uh, good?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Michelle is very inspired by you, and I know you have a very deep connection.
- Six weeks in Hong Kong, I was just fine.<eos> Twenty minutes here, I'm running in a forest getting shot at.<eos> Did you call anyone from a plane?<eos> Boyfriend?<eos> A girlfriend?<eos> Seriously?<eos> No. No boyfriend or girlfriend.<eos> I'm on my own.<eos> All I have are the clothes on my back.<eos> And now you.
Told you to run back there.<eos> Something you should know about me by now.<eos> I don't listen too well.<eos> Can you pass me one of the clips?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - You would have done the same.<eos> Hey. I found this.<eos> See if you can get a signal on it.<eos> No, there's no signal, but I'll keep trying.<eos> I should have trusted you. I should have just trusted you from the start.
- You would have done the same.<eos> Hey. I found this.<eos> See if you can get a signal on it.<eos> No, there's no signal, but I'll keep trying.<eos> I should have trusted you. I should have just trusted you from the start.<eos> - Hey. - I walked into that police station.<eos> - Don't.<eos> - They're dead. - That's on me.<eos> - No.<eos> It's on the people who sent those bastards after you.
It's good to hear your voice.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> Very much.<eos> To think we were just getting to know each other.<eos> - Is the girl with you?<eos> - Here's the thing, Simon.<eos> She's not your problem anymore.<eos> I am.<eos> I've noticed.<eos> If I were you, I'd actually keep an eye on Smith.
Now.<eos> We're going for a little walk.<eos> Now!<eos> Keep moving.<eos> What makes you think that when I'm dead you're not next?<eos> Genesis has a way of tying up loose ends.<eos> That's why you're gonna give me all the dirt you have on them.<eos> That information is my insurance policy.<eos> Move.<eos> You're too late.
This isn't a good idea. She's not trained for this, sergeant.<eos> We'll have eyes on her in the restaurant, he's not gonna try anything in public.<eos> It's not him I'm worried about. I have no idea what she'll do from one moment to the next.<eos> She's completely unreliable.<eos> - Reckless?<eos> - Yes.<eos> That's why I like her.<eos> Reminds me of myself at that age.<eos> You're not gonna ruin my little trip down nostalgia lane, are you?<eos> There's nothing nostalgic about you, sergeant.
- I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> 'Cause that's not his choice.<eos> It's mine.<eos> Hamish Stone, owner and publisher of Reconnoiter Media.<eos> I know who you are, and I'd describe you as more of a gossip profiteer.<eos> And you're the hacker who dropped out of MIT when you sister disappeared, moved to the Big Apple to look for her, and here we all are, getting acquainted.<eos> Correct me if I'm wrong, but hackers don't usually work with the police, do they?<eos> Especially when they've got a record.<eos> Then again, this case is rather personal for you, isn't it?
It's a celebration for the people of New York, to show this lunatic that he can't hold the city hostage.<eos> By throwing a party in protest, you're simply provoking him... apart from not being in exactly good taste.<eos> I'm sure that's not the first time you've been accused of that.<eos> That is you, isn't it?<eos> Leaving the crime scene?<eos> - Didn't you date Reese Hennessey?<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> That's what I do.<eos> I dig up the truth.<eos> It's becoming clear to people that the killer is obsessed with you.
Let's see.<eos> That's weird.<eos> The apartment network is protected.<eos> Really protected.<eos> So how do we get a closer look?<eos> Both:<eos> Fibertap.<eos> (Dialing) (Line ringing) Hello?<eos> Uh, delivery.<eos> I've got flowers for you.
It'll all be gone but...<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> See, I never do anything without a parachute.<eos> I found a clue that'll lead you to the killer.<eos> How can I be sure?<eos> You strike me as a gambling man.<eos> Come on, you'll get the biggest lead you'll ever get and I walk free.<eos> Seems like a fair trade.<eos> Fair?<eos> It's gonna hurt me a lot more than it's gonna hurt you.
- I pressed something... - Here, no problem.<eos> - I'll get it right back.<eos> - Please. - There it is.<eos> Forget it. - Just...<eos> I don't... - Is that better?<eos> Are you sure? - No, no.<eos> - You can see it.<eos> Please.<eos> Well, right here, he says how he likes doing things the old-fashioned way, face to face.<eos> Reminds me of you, Bill.
I know, right.<eos> Right.<eos> I don't know what to say, Bill.<eos> I mean, I am so sorry.<eos> I never meant for it to go this far.<eos> You know what's funny?<eos> I actually liked Drazen.<eos> I did, too.<eos> Yeah, and, I don't know, it just felt good, you know, chasing the big fish again, you know.<eos> He liked you, Bill.
In Vojens.<eos> They heard it on the radio.<eos> - Dismount.<eos> - Keep quiet about it.<eos> - Get that verified.<eos> - All the telephone lines are down.<eos> Find another telephone or a radio.<eos> Colonel Hartz?<eos> Second Lieutenant Sand, 4th Company, 2nd Platoon.<eos> Lieutenant Colonel Hintz asked me to report to you.
He needs you to take responsibility for all of Wayward Pines.<eos> Pamela Pilcher to the CRU. Pamela Pilcher... to the CRU.<eos> Duty calls.<eos> Pamela Pilcher?<eos> - Are you his wife?<eos> His sister.<eos> He got mother's good looks. I got her courage.<eos> David will be back with you in a moment.<eos> Who knows, perhaps by the end of the day you'll see things in a whole new light.<eos> I don't think he likes you.
Their minds couldn't handle the shock of this new reality.<eos> It was too jarring.<eos> They'd emerged from Plato's cave into the light. It had blinded them.<eos> People are fragile.<eos> They need time to adapt.<eos> They accept change gradually.<eos> But I had been too distant, too remote... blind.<eos> I'd failed them.<eos> I can't change what has happened, but I can strive for a better future.<eos> These are the dark ages, but enlightenment is coming... and I need you to keep Wayward safe until it does.
They've tried to escape before.<eos> They're prepared to do something reckless.<eos> They're gonna take down the fence.<eos> - If they succeed...<eos> - They're not going to succeed.<eos> We can't let them.<eos> I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to make sure that nobody gets killed.<eos> Not by this reckless group, and not by whatever's beyond that fence.<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> And not by you.
Armani shirt right there.<eos> What?<eos> I think you get lucky.<eos> Not because you trust people, but because you're just really good-looking, man.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> But then, as people get to know you, I think you get very unlucky.<eos> Which is how you ended up here in Battle Creek, and not Washington or New York or even Detroit.<eos> - I go where I can help. - Oh, yeah?<eos> Omar, excuse me.<eos> We have a couple questions for you.
I'm gonna go to jail.<eos> Yeah. Now the only question left is whether this bastard lives or dies.<eos> Of course it matters.<eos> We cannot be defined by our mistakes.<eos> We cannot let one thing, no matter how horrible, overpower everything else that we do in our life.<eos> And the only way to do that is to make sure that everything else overpowers that mistake.<eos> We have that chance. As long as we're alive, we have that chance.<eos> So it's your choice, Ricky.<eos> Are you a killer?<eos> Does this ever work for you?
"Bless me with courage."<eos> "O Lord..bless me with your grace." "..and unite me with my desires."<eos> "Unite me."<eos> Mister, can I be of some service?<eos> You know no one buys your bread.<eos> Please lease this place to my brother.<eos> At least we'll get some rent.<eos> Again you mentioned about your brother.<eos> I don't want to sell this bakery.<eos> I'm fed-up of you and your bakery.
Myself, Advocate Kanar Singh Chima from Kasoli.<eos> Yes?<eos> Well, actually I wanted to give you a small trouble.<eos> Your dear father, the very respected Mr. Bhajanlal Bhalla.. ...Is tired of working hard..and wants to retire.<eos> It's his life, he can do anything he likes with it.<eos> Wonderful!<eos> What a great son Mr. Bhalla has.<eos> Super!<eos> But the problem is that the bakery.. ...Is on your ancestral land.<eos> And your grandfather willed this land.. ...to you and your father.
What kind of a son is he!<eos> He refused to work at the bakery!<eos> What is it, Mr. Bhalla?<eos> Did he disappoint you?<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> What do you want to do in life?<eos> I don't want to live in this country.<eos> I want to go abroad.<eos> What's he saying?<eos> He sounds like those people are waiting for you.. "With a Welcome' board.
- Kasoli.<eos> Why are you after me?<eos> Chill.<eos> I'll take another cab.<eos> No, no, sir.<eos> Gurdaspur is on the way.<eos> We can drop her on the way and continue to Kasoli.<eos> You see..this way I'll get two fares.<eos> "You're the one.. I prayed for."<eos> Taking a single step without you..is impossible.
Blessings?<eos> Once you meet them. ...It will shatter all your illusions about marriage.<eos> Most welcome.<eos> Come.<eos> - Sir..are you lnder Bhalla?<eos> Foreign return?<eos> Yes.<eos> You see..your father is at the lawyer's place.<eos> And he's called you there too.<eos> And the lawyer has even sent a car for you.
Did he put them in the oven and make biscuits?<eos> Tell him..his mother kept all the jewelry at his uncle's place.<eos> Because she didn't trust me.<eos> Ask him..why doesn't he tell mother to get those jewelry back?<eos> I can't tell her that.<eos> Tell him, daughter-in-law.<eos> Tell him..you're not his daughter-in-law.<eos> I am not your daughter-in-law.<eos> - Fine.<eos> You're not my daughter-in-law, good for you.
Hey SHOW--<eos> It'll take three of you to dance with me.<eos> Get that?<eos> Pay first..and eat later.<eos> We don't take credit cards.<eos> What's the bill?<eos> - 4560 rupees.<eos> Why so much?<eos> Because singing and dancing comes free with the meal.<eos> Well.. Jeeto's special offer for you.
Nimmi's here.<eos> Look.<eos> Nimmi's back.<eos> Come, Nimmi.<eos> They are all wearing same glasses.<eos> No need to worry.<eos> I just need to inject her.<eos> And she'll be fine.<eos> Allopathy is useless.<eos> I've brought Ayurvedic powder for you.
He'll only get spoilt out there.<eos> He'll be so rude.. ...that he won't stop the car even if you have to pee.<eos> No, papa.. I will stop the car.<eos> I swear.<eos> Lucky..how can you stop the car.. ...when you find out that your father's borrowed money from everyone.. ...and goons are chasing you for recovery.<eos> How will you stop the car?<eos> What?<eos> When did I borrow any money?<eos> Remember, sir.<eos> He'll forget all about you instantly.
- Finish the fritters.<eos> Come on, come quickly.<eos> Inder, if he goes..the jewels are gone too.<eos> It's time.<eos> What happened?<eos> It's time..it's time.<eos> Bhalla.<eos> - Kirpal.<eos> Inder.<eos> - He's calling you.
You'll have to wait little longer because of us.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Inder.<eos> Come here.<eos> You want this?<eos> There's the crocodile with the heart.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Inder, you're here.<eos> You made me really happy.<eos> Your uncle really loved you.
Inder, you're here.<eos> You made me really happy.<eos> Your uncle really loved you.<eos> He used to say lnder earns in Dollars.<eos> Listen to me, son.<eos> Your uncle had a wish.. ...that we throw a big feast for everyone.<eos> And son, we left no deanh.<eos> We made sweetmeat in organic ghee.<eos> And fritters fried in olive oil.<eos> And your uncle's left this for you.
We made sweetmeat in organic ghee.<eos> And fritters fried in olive oil.<eos> And your uncle's left this for you.<eos> Son, I have just one request.<eos> Lend me 300,000 rupees.<eos> I'll install three benches at the station in your uncle's memory.<eos> And it will also bear your name.<eos> "NRl lnder".<eos> Here you go, son.<eos> This is for you.
I am sure he never told you this.<eos> He divorced your mother, I've got proof.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> You divorced mother?<eos> What?<eos> Brother lnder!<eos> Brother lnder!<eos> What happened?<eos> Move..move back.<eos> Papa has left this key for you.
Come soon.<eos> - Okay.<eos> If you are marrying him then tell him the truth.<eos> No need to lie.<eos> One has to make excuses, Inder.<eos> Because life has given us excuses for staying together.<eos> As you can see..first in the plane.<eos> Then we had to run away together.<eos> You even dropped me home.<eos> But Chima brought me to you again.
Mother?<eos> We need a marriage certificate.<eos> If mother remarries.<eos> ...we'll get a new marriage cenificate along with her new husband.<eos> She..<eos> - And the bank will have to open the locker.<eos> Sit.<eos> Sit.<eos> Now take a good look at him.<eos> I've chosen him for you.
I never thought.<eos> ...about the conditions.<eos> ...and difficulties you'd be facing.<eos> Or how's mom?<eos> In fact.. I came here for my own selfish gains.<eos> I couldn't be a good son.<eos> I am sorry, Papa-<eos> Come here.<eos> No, son.<eos> Thanks to you..for the first time in my life I'm looking good.

Name your price.<eos> You're gonna get me fucking killed with these meetings.<eos> You better have some kind of Witness Protection Program to put me in.<eos> Do you even know who these people are?<eos> What they're capable of?<eos> If anybody gets wind of this now, I'm a gonner.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> It's not the first time we've done this.<eos> Now, you tell us what we want, and you can put this entire process behind you.<eos> - Like promised, we'll take care of you.

He facilitates it through the Mexican border.<eos> Everyone's in on it.<eos> Everyone gets paid.<eos> It's basically foolproof.<eos> We already know all this, Mrs. Garcia.<eos> We need to know how.<eos> Now, I can't offer you immunity if you don't cooperate.<eos> So you tell us what we want, we'll give you what you need.<eos> It is as simple as that.<eos> Don't get too cocky, Mrs. Garcia, you need us more than we need you.
Did you ever think that maybe I pay him well?<eos> You ever think that maybe I know exactly what he makes?<eos> I'm sure you do.<eos> But do you know how much money I clean for him?<eos> Everybody has their cleaners.<eos> Not like me.<eos> And what makes you so special?<eos> I can not tell you that.<eos> I work for Rosco.<eos> Not you.
Not like me.<eos> And what makes you so special?<eos> I can not tell you that.<eos> I work for Rosco.<eos> Not you.<eos> Hundred grand, right?<eos> - What's the turnaround?<eos> - 48 hours.<eos> The return?<eos> 120 back to you.

120 to you is all that matters.<eos> You're being paid to launder your own money.<eos> What do you care what I make?<eos> Fair enough.<eos> 120, like promised.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Here's 200, let's see what you do with it.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Where've you been?<eos> I've got more product for you.
Impressive.<eos> Here's 200, let's see what you do with it.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Where've you been?<eos> I've got more product for you.<eos> - I've been busy.<eos> - Busy with what?<eos> Bigger transactions.<eos> How big?<eos> Bigger than what I've been doing for you.
- Who are you?<eos> - I just wanna make you an offer.<eos> - Nothing to worry about.<eos> - I worry about everything.<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name's John Doe.<eos> All right, John Doe.<eos> How would you like a bullet to your face before I get out of this car?<eos> Now, I know all about you.
Now, I know all about you.<eos> That's why I've asked you for this meet.<eos> How'd you get in my car?<eos> Come on, you're a cop.<eos> You know how that works.<eos> So what's your offer?<eos> Put the gun down first.<eos> Put the gown down now, I know your reputation.<eos> So let's hear about your offer.<eos> I got a job for you.
And he took it all.<eos> My love, my life, my money.<eos> And ultimately my freedom.<eos> Now his time has come.<eos> Who is this mystical man you speak of?<eos> Sonny "Sundown" Garcia.<eos> Do you have any idea how long they been trying to get this guy?<eos> Not likely.<eos> You don't know him like I know him.<eos> I can serve him up on a plate to you.
How do you get away with a perfect crime?<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> How do you get away with a lifetime of crime?<eos> That's simple.<eos> Make 'em think you haven't.<eos> I knew the feds were minutes away from getting their man.<eos> So what did I do?<eos> I gave 'em what they wanted.<eos> You don't know him like I know him.<eos> I can serve him up on a plate to you.
It's very simple.<eos> I want you to join my council and learn the business of my government.<eos> You might even be my First Minister one day and be as dear to me as he was.<eos> I'm waiting for your answer.<eos> Still waiting.<eos> This is an extraordinary honour, sire, but one I must decline.<eos> Whatever ability I have is better employed with the Musketeers.<eos> Come now, Captain.<eos> This is no time for modesty.<eos> The King needs you.
You would be wise to listen...<eos> Who do you think you are talking to?<eos> Never insult the King again in my presence.<eos> Will you let this outrage pass?<eos> Frankly, I wish I'd done it myself.<eos> You're a dangerous man, Rochefort, but an entertaining one.<eos> Now, what is this urgent news of yours?<eos> If I might speak to Your Majesty in private?<eos> Constance, I'm so glad you're here.<eos> D'Artagnan speaks of you in glowing terms.
You don't need to remind us of our duty.<eos> And if I tell you to shoot, you do it.<eos> We should take their horses, too. Give ours a rest.<eos> What about D'Artagnan?<eos> If he's alive, he'll find us.<eos> Please don't be alarmed.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Don't worry, I'm a gentleman.<eos> You're undressed!<eos> Not for your benefit, I can assure you.
A hundred?<eos> One.<eos> One?<eos> - Where is Rochefort now?<eos> -I heard shooting,<eos> I have no idea what happened to him or my friends.<eos> - So, they might all be dead?<eos> Something is wrong, General?<eos> You do not like chess?<eos> On the contrary, I don't like you.
To answer a summons from the Cardinal.<eos> I should have nailed down the coffin lid myself.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Well, what is this message?<eos> You're looking at it, monsieur.<eos> I didn't know Adele was dead.<eos> The last I heard, she'd gone to the Cardinal's country estate. I...<eos> I thought she'd made her choice.<eos> She did, monsieur.<eos> She chose you.
His father will be there.<eos> Captain!<eos> Why was the King taken?<eos> Between ourselves, no need to worry the Queen any more than necessary.<eos> The man who abducted the King is a convicted criminal.<eos> He sells his captives to the Spanish, to be used as galley slaves.<eos> We suspect he has no idea who he's taken.<eos> You don't suspect the Spanish themselves?<eos> In this case, no.<eos> I have complete faith in you, Captain.
Pepin, get up!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> After them!<eos> I thought you'd never stop running.<eos> Quickly, we must hurry.<eos> Find LeMaitre!<eos> No-one gets away!<eos> No-one gets away.<eos> It is the right decision for you and France.
- Hi.<eos> -How you doing?<eos> - Alright.<eos> How are you?<eos> Charlie Skoller. -Bill Genovese.<eos> - How are you, Bill?<eos> -Nice to meet you.<eos> Going around here is anxiety provoking.<eos> - Are you sure you wanna do this?<eos> This has to be very difficult for you.
- Yeah, I, uh..<eos> ...I see how you feel about, uh, what happened.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - When I was 7 years old.<eos> - Oh. No, I know.<eos> I don't hold the son responsible for the father's deeds.<eos> Your dad won't talk to me.. ...and I'm, uh, trying to find a way in my own heart to forgive him.<eos> - Can -- can I explain to you what forgiveness does?<eos> When you forgive people, it's for yourself.<eos> It's for you. - Yeah.
Got you a cup of tea here.<eos> You fancy it?<eos> Yeah?<eos> No?<eos> What's this?<eos> The old Dagenham Anglia?<eos> Naught to 60 in, what, 40 minutes, something like that?<eos> Phwoar!<eos> It's a bit of you, that, innit, all black and cramped and very sharp.<eos> This one's really milky, for you.
These are the Kray twins.<eos> Ronald and Reginald.<eos> Yes, I've, heard of them.<eos> You'll find them useful friends.<eos> What's this about, Mr Payne?<eos> This is about a gambling casino in Knightsbridge called Esmeralda's Barn.<eos> - I'm not familiar with it.<eos> - Really?<eos> Well, you'll be shocked to learn that you earned Ł24,000 from it in the last three months.<eos> My friends and I would like to purchase it from you.
Well, Mr Lansky might want to know that we happen to have a casino of our own.<eos> Really?<eos> Your own casino?<eos> Well, you see, we own Las Vegas.<eos> But here, the Atlantic Ocean is in our way.<eos> So Mr Lansky lacks the ability to, ensure the physical security of his property, from both outside muscle and the cops.<eos> He thinks the Kray family could help.<eos> London is going to be the Las Vegas of Europe.<eos> We need someone to front and someone to muscle for us.<eos> I mean, look, we can do your security, right, that's not a problem, you know, but we don't want to work for you.
Some Hollywood film star was supposed to have bought it, but no, it's Mr and Mrs Owen.<eos> You've met them?<eos> No, everything by letter.<eos> An island?<eos> By the sea?<eos> Islands are generally by the sea.<eos> The box, if you please, Audrey.<eos> Erm... I...<eos> I don't... Maybe I'm not suited...<eos> You are who she wants.
Good little secretary.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We've got off on the wrong foot, haven't we?<eos> But you do have very pretty legs.<eos> - It would have been remiss not to admire them.<eos> - Mr Lombard... ..you seem to be under the impression that I am a particular kind of woman.<eos> And I assure you that I am not.<eos> I do not like to be looked at.<eos> I get instincts about people.<eos> I've an instinct about you.
Not that there's going to be a next one.<eos> There's always a next one.<eos> So, how about it?<eos> A bet?<eos> The odds are too short.<eos> Listen to them.<eos> Clinging on.<eos> They think they still mean something but nobody at all would notice, or care, if they just...<eos> I'm going to be exceptionally charming to them.<eos> Oh, all right, Miss Claythorne. If it'll make you happy, I'm sorry for staring.
Dr Armstrong. I heard you get up.<eos> Has Mrs Rogers got worse?<eos> Somewhat.<eos> She's dead.<eos> - Dead?<eos> - Died in her sleep.<eos> It was quite peaceful.<eos> Nothing to be alarmed about.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait, I, er... I came down here to wait for you and I saw this. Please.
Pablo was making a killing in the smuggling business.<eos> Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, you name it.<eos> At the time, Pablo owned half the police in Medellín.<eos> But DAS was Colombia's version of the FBI.<eos> They didn't play by the same rules.<eos> Pablo Escobar?<eos> Where's Felipo?<eos> Felipo's been arrested.<eos> Bullshit. Felipo works for me.<eos> He used to work for you.
Hide from your sins in a temple?<eos> Your sins are a part of you.<eos> How can you hide from yourself?<eos> Kneel before the Buddha.<eos> Did that hurt?<eos> Yes!<eos> You feel pain.<eos> Good.<eos> Now repent.<eos> Ask yourself if you were doing good or evil.
This breaks when I pull it then I've to stop the play and glue it.<eos> Who told you to pull it like Lord Rama?<eos> Adjust!<eos> Help boss!<eos> These shoes are tight!<eos> The nails hurt!<eos> Instead of laughing in the scene they make me cry!<eos> The actor who {flayed Raven before you had a smaller shoe size.<eos> Inflation is on a rise.<eos> If I had bought new shoes for you I couldn't have afforded food... and we would've had to eat your shoes for dinner.
No I don't want anything.<eos> Thank you sir.<eos> Have some guava, really sweet.<eos> Sorry sir.<eos> I didn't have any other way to impress you.<eos> Please, arrange a small meeting with the Princess.<eos> We've come from really far facing many difficulties to meet Princess Maithili.<eos> Sir, just a brief meeting.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I'll arrange a meeting for you.
Even Kanhaiya has never loved me so much.<eos> So Bhaiji what can we show you?<eos> The plays of Chota Bheem, Bal Hanuman or the Ladies' Special...<eos> No...do you have a CD or something?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> We do have a CD.<eos> - We do have a CD.<eos> We'll show him the best one...how about this?<eos> No... I had a viral during the performance.<eos> This is our interpretation of Vrindavan's 'Raas-Leela' for you.
Yes.<eos> You'll get 24 hours room service too.<eos> Love you Bhaiji.<eos> - Sir how about a demonstration?<eos> "Radha said..."<eos> No I don't want to see anything.<eos> I've some work.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> No problem, you go freshen up.<eos> We'll recreate Vrindavan for you right here.
And what did the elder son do?<eos> He rejected every bill, like one does with contractors!<eos> Today for the first time I have given something ...without his permission.<eos> Enjoy!<eos> Sir, if the younger prince finds out that his elder brother passed all his bills and it was you...?<eos> Sameera, these Kings don't have time to check every cheque book and voucher.<eos> That's our job.<eos> We can shake the very foundation of these palaces.<eos> And this is just the beginning of my plan and your gifts, Sameera.<eos> Let's take a nice picture of you...
He used to spend quality time with the Queen here.<eos> Oh...how sweet.<eos> Bapu.<eos> - What?<eos> Quality time out here?<eos> Weren't there enough rooms in the palace?<eos> Keep quiet!<eos> But Bapu...<eos> - Now shut up!<eos> That night I had arranged a special barbeque for you there.
- Yes, Bapu?<eos> Take this.<eos> - Oh a book?<eos> The "History of Our Kings".<eos> Your speech today will be in pure Hindi.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Yes, memorize it.<eos> Today's protocol, first your speech followed by classical music after that classical dance and then finally lunch!<eos> Oh... lunch Bapu.<eos> Boiled for you.
You just need to kick the ball.<eos> They don't remember birthdays, anniversaries, or love!<eos> Sir, goalkeeper.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Masoorie uncle...backward.<eos> - No, no, forward.<eos> Forward.<eos> Referee...full on cheating, or else...<eos> How was my acting?<eos> I couldn't take my eyes off you.
He already has high sugar the doctor has advised him rest.<eos> We added to his tension didn't we?<eos> Deewan Saheb, I'll find the Prince and bring him back he'll be fine.<eos> I know the Prince will be fine.<eos> Chuttan is in our custody Ajay knows if he hurts the Prince then we'll make Chuttan confess in public his secret will be exposed.<eos> Your Majesty, in order to save one of your sons we'll have to strike a deal with the other.<eos> Forgive me Your Majesty, I couldn't unite your children you always wanted them to stay together you built the Sheesh Mahal (Palace of Mirrors) with that dream...<eos> Kids have a look!<eos> Gifts for all of you!<eos> This is for you...for you... and for you!
I want the children to keep visiting this Sheesh Mahal and every mirror here should reflect their golden childhood to them!<eos> "Where is the home of my dreams?"<eos> "Mirror, take me back to my childhood."<eos> "Where is the home of my dreams?"<eos> "Mirror, take me back to my childhood."<eos> "Life was simple."<eos> "Mirror, take me back to my childhood."<eos> "Where is the home of my dreams?"<eos> "Mirror, take me back to my childhood."<eos> "Without you, darling, everything seems unreal."

Raia Bhaiya!<eos> 'Congratulations Prem Dilwale!<eos> ' 'Now the Princess can be yours.'<eos> 'The Princess can be yours.'<eos> 'The Princess can be yours.'<eos> Dilwale...the Princess can be yours.<eos> My not trusting you...means your death.<eos> Aren't you scared of death?<eos> If I had made a mistake... I would be scared.<eos> I've come to take you back to your Princess where your sisters are waiting for you your family is waiting for you.
Thank you.<eos> Deewan Saheb, send him in.<eos> Your Majesty, before anyone discovers our secret Dilwala has come to take your leave.<eos> Okay... Papa's car will go drop him Deewan Saheb.<eos> Yes.<eos> Goodbye Sir.<eos> Dilwale, you've broken many traditions you made the royal guests play football you told everyone that I used to bathe naked in the lake!<eos> And you didn't keep a moustache either why?<eos> Sir, it made your Princess happy!<eos> Thank you... I can't stop you from leaving but tell me, what can I do for you.

He's got a gun?<eos> I carry it everywhere.<eos> And it was implied that I might need it.<eos> Implied by whom?<eos> My client needs a good man who can handle situations.<eos> Who's your client?<eos> Mr Owen.<eos> Ulick Norman Owen.<eos> Never heard of him.<eos> But he has heard of you.
(Whispers) There's something going on between them.<eos> Sealed...and untampered with.<eos> - (Thunder) BLORE: What's that for?<eos> A chandelier, maybe.<eos> Like downstairs.<eos> A chandelier?<eos> In the bedroom?<eos> Well, it's posh people, isn't it? They'd put a chandelier anywhere.<eos> They'd put a chandelier in a pigsty ifthe fancy took them.<eos> I'm becoming very fond of you, Tubs.
It's them.<eos> - It's them. - (Blore mutters)<eos> (Mutters)<eos> BLORE: I'm going to bed.<eos> This party's over.<eos> BLORE: Now, look here, sunshine, you've been pinched. And we know what for.<eos> Lurking about in a gentlemen's public convenience in the bogs.<eos> What am I? Born yesterday?<eos> Now, you're lucky you got me, not some other copper who might have been a bit heavy-handed.<eos> There's nothing of you.
Weaklings, frauds, liars.<eos> Ned Low, whatever he is, he's none of those things.<eos> The men saw him as an answer.<eos> But now I fear they cannot see that by supporting him, they may be sowing the seeds of their own destruction.<eos> Mr. Meeks, your men can't possibly be that stupid.<eos> Are they unaware of the profits he cost them with the Good Fortune prize?<eos> Or the future profits he's costing them with me?<eos> Ma'am, I'm uncertain of my footing on this subject.<eos> Suffice it to say, the Good Fortune yielded up a unique item of great value.<eos> The men know where their next distribution is coming from and it isn't you. Item?

Item?<eos> What kind of item?<eos> I really cannot say.<eos> Well, Mr. Meeks, I'm not exactly sure what it is you think I can do for you,
Well, Mr. Meeks, I'm not exactly sure what it is you think I can do for you,<eos> - but I've got business...<eos> - I hear you depose captains.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I'm told you have that power.<eos> I'm told you've done it before.<eos> That was a special case and something I nearly paid for at the cost of my livelihood.<eos> Simply incompatible with the role I play here now.<eos> He is a mad man.<eos> And he's fixed on you as an object of his ire.
The part you and I have yet to discuss.<eos> I didn't think we had one of those.<eos> These past few months I have come to trust you.<eos> Very much.<eos> Which is why I feel I can ask for your help.<eos> When my father arrives, I intend to propose something to him which could be very dangerous politically.<eos> What is it you want me to help you with?<eos> I want you to try to talk me out of it.<eos> Yes?<eos> Ma'am, you're needed.
Why do you think they went up that hill?<eos> Beg your pardon?<eos> If we're to stop any more men from joining his side, isn't it a prerequisite that we try and understand the thinking of the men who have already joined him?<eos> Sorry, are you asking my opinion?<eos> Oh.<eos> I suppose one could argue that it's simple fear.<eos> Their fear of losing the fort being greater than their fear of Vane remaining in it.<eos> But then again, it's possible this has nothing to do with the fort.<eos> Nor with Vane.<eos> Perhaps it's just them expressing their opinions about you.
Their fear of losing the fort being greater than their fear of Vane remaining in it.<eos> But then again, it's possible this has nothing to do with the fort.<eos> Nor with Vane.<eos> Perhaps it's just them expressing their opinions about you.<eos> So you think that they see me as the villain in this particular story?<eos> I think that would explain their decision, yes.<eos> And you?<eos> What do you think? You see me as the villain here?<eos> I see you as the agent most likely of securing my share of the gold on that beach.<eos> As long as that remains true, I am not bothered in the least by whatever labels anyone else decides to affix to you.
Richard Guthrie sat on the throne of commerce when I arrived.<eos> Made men rich, they said.<eos> Then his daughter took his place, made Nassau strong.<eos> Everyone knows this.<eos> I wonder how many know that there was one man standing behind them.<eos> Standing behind both thrones, keeping the world spinning.<eos> You're as invested in the future of this place as any.<eos> What would you do?<eos> I know Eleanor's argument.<eos> And I know why you think it is weak and I do not disagree with you.
Not you.<eos> Now your cowboy antics... has taken away two of my top fighters.<eos> - Top fighters?<eos> - Street trash.<eos> They say every dog has his day, and today is your day, street dog.<eos> Today we found out whether yesterday was truly skill... or if you just got lucky.<eos> - Thanks, but I'll pass.<eos> - Nyet. You will step into that ring, and we will find out what you're really made of.<eos> I'm not your dog.<eos> I don't fight for you.
Jazz, something's come up.<eos> Oh, Jazz is, uh, Jasmine?<eos> That's your girlfriend?<eos> James's daughter?<eos> - Yeah, now gimme my phone.<eos> - Hey, you fight then you get phone.<eos> Or, maybe I keep it.<eos> Call Jasmine myself.<eos> Yuri, please, man. I can't do this tonight.<eos> Any other night I'll fight for you, just not tonight.
No one was supposed to be in there. The place was supposed to burn down.<eos> I was gonna pay him some money, and just buy some time, figure it out!<eos> - No, you've done it this time, James. - We go way back.<eos> You can't do this to me.<eos> - They're gonna kill me!<eos> - Then you better pray they're fast.<eos> - Yuri! - Ah!<eos> Street, my good friend.<eos> We had a deal, Yuri, and I lived up to it.<eos> You said if I fight for you, you won't hurt my family.
- Why?<eos> - Well, over the next 10 years, we plan on expanding in this area, and your land... well, that's an important part of the process.<eos> Uh... What if I choose not to sell?<eos> Well, you do know that CamSET Holdings owns the mortgage on your home.<eos> You're behind on your payments, and foreclosure...<eos> That could affect your ability to send your kids to college or...<eos> Well, I would need to see a number first. Of course.<eos> Yeah. Of course.<eos> Why don't you take that?<eos> We'll get the ball rolling and have you and your family out of here in no time.
No.<eos> There's an entire carcass?<eos> I mean, its value to science is... is just incalculable.<eos> What's your name, please?<eos> Jason.<eos> So... put a precise number on incalculable for me, Professor.<eos> How do you mean?<eos> What's it worth?<eos> It's priceless.<eos> No, I mean what's it worth to you?
Eric took me up onto the glacier in a tent... or more a bivouac, really.<eos> And the temperature fell to minus-30, so that night, we saw the most spectacular aurora borealis I'd ever seen, the fireworks of the gods, as we call it, the heavens singing.<eos> You can actually hear them, you know, the northern lights outside the city.<eos> And now we are building a hideaway in the ice.<eos> We are building a hotel hewn into the glacier itself, where lovers of the wilderness, lovers of the northern lights, or just lovers can witness the wildest things they'll ever see from the safest place on Earth.<eos> I'm quite proud of that line, actually, so I don't mind if you want to use it in your brochures.<eos> And here it is.<eos> Excavation's scheduled to begin in two weeks' time, and in six months, we would be ready for our very first guests.<eos> So thank you, and enjoy.<eos> Sheriff Anderssen for you.
Karen Alvarado.<eos> That's such a pretty name.<eos> An architect and an artist.<eos> You guys are like the perfect couple.<eos> And she's so hot.<eos> You must have sex, like, all day.<eos> - Bel!<eos> - What?<eos> I would.<eos> That's Belly for you.
To vanquish phantoms, he prays.<eos> Whatever his faults, the bond between the throne and temple serves order.<eos> And order serves the preservation of our people.<eos> Please, sir.<eos> Allow me.<eos> Please, sir.<eos> Greetings.<eos> Greetings.<eos> Greetings, sir.<eos> Greetings to you.
They believe hes everywhere.<eos> Everywhere?<eos> But cannot be seen?<eos> How do they know he exists?<eos> Maybe he doesn't.<eos> Come on, children.<eos> Ah, he's here.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Our cousin Elizabeth has not seen you since you were a baby in arms.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
Yeah, I've been asked to analyze this<eos> By the governor and DCI Morton.<eos> And?<eos> It's a mammoth's tooth.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Radio carbon dating puts it at 32,000 years old.<eos> So where'd you get it?<eos> You mean is there more than just a tooth?<eos> Is there?<eos> What would it be worth to you if there was, Natalie?
- I think me and my small batch whiskey... are gonna go try and find the little boy's room.<eos> You okay?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> Linda.<eos> - Linda.<eos> - Oh, hi. Oma.<eos> How are you?<eos> Oh, I like you, you know?<eos> Even though you ran off on my son.<eos> - I always liked you too, Oma.
- I always liked you too, Oma.<eos> - Between you and me... I don't like Peter's new wife.<eos> Peter and Maureen are happy.<eos> Maybe now. It's only been a few weeks.<eos> No, it's been many, many years.<eos> I've been looking for you.<eos> Why don't we go find our seat, okay?<eos> Jeff. Will you show Oma to her seat?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Jeff will take you.
We made our way down to the ridge and watched while they ferried it all into their holds.<eos> Watched that gold disappear from that beach piece by piece, and watched them weigh anchor and set sail.<eos> When it was all clear, we walked the beach.<eos> Not a fucking piece left behind.<eos> Not a fucking piece.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's happening out there?<eos> They've called council to debate how they wish to proceed.<eos> That should be productive.<eos> The good news for you is Hornigold's support has disappeared completely.
On account of the confusion.<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am, but may I ask, how did you arrive in this place?<eos> My father brought me here when I was a child.<eos> Was he one of them?<eos> No, he was most assuredly not one of them.<eos> I remember when my father... told me he was leaving for Carolina.<eos> He left me behind.<eos> He said Charles Town was far too coarse and violent a place to bring a child into.<eos> But you seem a formidable woman, ma'am.<eos> Perhaps it was exposure to the challenges of this place that made you the person you are.
It's getting late.<eos> So, who among you has a complaint tonight?<eos> Step forward and challenge your opponent.<eos> From the shadows you attack me?<eos> Master Ho will challenge any of you to step in the ring and fight me with honor.<eos> I'll take all of you on.<eos> Who among you wants to take on Master Ho?<eos> Fools.<eos> Show me your face.<eos> I came here for you, Master Ho.
My name is Thaddeus.<eos> You fight for the side of good men?<eos> What I did in my past, and what I do in my future are two different things.<eos> I no longer have desire to fight.<eos> I'm on a quest for inner peace.<eos> Well, you came to the wrong town for that.<eos> I have to move you to a safer place.<eos> Master Ho, the man who owns the mines, rules this town.<eos> He is a ruthless man.<eos> And if he knows of your special gift, he might have other designs for you.
I don't like Ho any more than you do, but I answer to that monster directly.<eos> And you have a target on your back.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Go back to representing the miners.<eos> And let me work on Ho for concessions.<eos> But be forewarned, don't push Ho.<eos> Ho can make things difficult for you and me.<eos> And your family.<eos> You may answer to Ho, but I don't.<eos> Not to you, not to anyone.
No!<eos> Thaddeus!<eos> Help!<eos> No!<eos> I'm here.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Innocence!<eos> She's alive!<eos> Well, brother Kung, the winds of change are upon you now.
Now, please, come with us.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's start over.<eos> You know my name.<eos> What do I call you?<eos> Caleb.<eos> All right, Caleb.<eos> Can I get some water?<eos> You're gonna have to help me with that.<eos> I didn't come here to hurt you or anyone else.
( without accent ) You do?<eos> I just want to confirm.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Someone's got good news.<eos> Someone does.<eos> Jackie detoxed and joined a rehab program.<eos> Everything we did, it worked.<eos> You deserve a lot of credit.<eos> Aw, I was just trying to help.<eos> Zoey, I've come to rely on you, which is why I have decided to make you... head ER nurse.
Zoey, I've come to rely on you, which is why I have decided to make you... head ER nurse.<eos> What?<eos> We've never had an official head ER nurse before.<eos> Not even Jackie.<eos> Exactly.<eos> After everything that's happened, I'm gonna start doing things differently around here and I need you to do it with me.<eos> Oh, I did tell you she's in rehab, right?<eos> She seems to be taking it very seriously.<eos> We're not talking about Jackie.<eos> We're talking about you and the future of this ER.
_<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Oh, I was just going to get some fresh air.<eos> Pastor Billingham says I'll be learning a very important part of the ritual tonight.<eos> I didn't know what to expect, and just nervous I guess.<eos> Well, you'll do fine.<eos> You're very strong.<eos> You're very brave.<eos> Everyone here loves you.<eos> I was just hoping I could look at you if I get scared.
Would have been a little heavier, only she taxed us over the state of the containers.<eos> Are they still in there?<eos> Far as I know. Door hasn't opened all morning.<eos> When she finally emerges, tell her I've left.<eos> I'll make contact with Captain Hornigold, inform him of our arrival, and arrange safe passage into harbor.<eos> I'll then attempt to persuade him to assign the bulk of his crew and his ship to sail in consort with us.<eos> With a little luck, we'll be on our way back to the Urca wreck within a matter of days.<eos> And how do you plan to answer the question?<eos> What question is that?<eos> Why is this request coming from you, Captain Flint, and not from Mr. Gates?
So they had that in their favor.<eos> Jesus.<eos> I thought we needed to get back to the ship as quickly as possible.<eos> You're bringing something to read?<eos> It isn't for me.<eos> Strange.<eos> You and I have never shared more than a few words, and yet I feel like we're old friends.<eos> Do you?<eos> Of course.<eos> James talks about you all the time.
Do you?<eos> Of course.<eos> James talks about you all the time.<eos> Captain Flint.<eos> He's told me what you've accomplished in this place.<eos> With those men.<eos> In spite of them.<eos> It's no small feat.<eos> And I admire it.<eos> Do you know what he told me about you?
At that point, Mr. Gates' faith in our mission... his faith in me was lost.<eos> I had to use my judgment whether to let him abort our entire endeavor and see my plans, your plans, evaporate or to stop him.<eos> I stopped him.<eos> What did you do?<eos> What was necessary.<eos> Because I knew that the future of this place is everything.<eos> And that there is no sacrifice too great to secure that future.<eos> I thought you and I were in agreement about that.<eos> I'm sorry you were put to that choice.<eos> I know what he meant to you.
In my experience, there is an inverse relationship between the degree of one's happiness and the concern one suffers for what the neighbors think.<eos> This isn't an abstraction, ma'am.<eos> - Were your husband to hear...<eos> - I love my husband.<eos> I know what's said about me behind my back.<eos> Whispers of infidelities.<eos> My husband's heard them.<eos> And I suspect, given the look on your face, you've heard them, too.<eos> Thomas and I are not bothered by them.<eos> The only question that remains is... are you?
What do you know about this?<eos> About what?<eos> About what the paper says:<eos> A girl disappeared from a neighboring town.<eos> It's worrying.<eos> Has it happened before?<eos> Yes.<eos> Unfortunately it's becoming more common.<eos> I forgot.<eos> It's for you.
You poor kid!<eos> First things first.<eos> Don't hurt the baby.<eos> You can hurt me, but don't hurt the baby!<eos> Abigail, I'm not going to do anything at all unless you're too tired to keep on pushing.<eos> We're here to help.<eos> Has another midwife just arrived?<eos> She said her name was Nurse Crane. Oh, that's all you need, her galumphing about in her great size nines.<eos> I'll send you out a cup of tea.<eos> ~ Oh. ~ This is for you.
~ Hot's been off all week.<eos> ~ Perhaps you'd boil a kettle.<eos> ~ Run around after the likes of her? ~ Who do you think I am?<eos> ~ Someone who seems to care very little.<eos> ~ CRIES IN PAIN ~ See to that water, would you?<eos> We need to move her to the London after she's delivered.<eos> You carry on here, I'll telephone the surgery. The defendant will rise.<eos> Anthony Luke Amos, you admit to an act of sexual perversion and moral corruption.<eos> This is an offence which carries a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment.<eos> Your doctor sees in you something I do not - a man who wishes to be cured.
Where is your husband?<eos> Where is he living?<eos> A seamen's hostel.<eos> Shad Thames.<eos> Do you know it? Can you find it, bring him here?<eos> Men ain't allowed here. Rules is rules.<eos> Superintendent Ginson, you've given us cause to believe you have a heart after all.<eos> Don't disappoint us in our diagnosis.<eos> Find him!<eos> Please! ~ Dolores, you want your husband to see baby, don't you?
Oh!<eos> Legs up.<eos> She's too advanced to move her back to the maternity home.<eos> Bridget, we're going to have to deliver your baby here. ~ Knees down.<eos> ~ If she hasn't finished her treatment, we have to assume the syphilis is still contagious.<eos> ~ My back is killing me. ~ Well, let's get you onto your hands and knees - ~ that'll ease the pressure.<eos> ~ BANGS DOOR ~ Help! Is anyone there? I need a midwife!<eos> ~ BANGING ON DOOR ~ I need some help!<eos> ~ What are you about?<eos> ~ It's you! This is no night to be abroad! Can I see a midwife?
GC. Lock the doors.<eos> HOW'D THE LAUNCH GO?<eos> WATNEY<eos> SOL 186<eos> Commander Lewis, I may need you to do something for me.<eos> If I die, I need you to check in with my parents.<eos> They will want to hear all about our time here on Mars.<eos> I know that sucks, and it will be hard talking to a couple about their dead son.<eos> It's a lot to ask.<eos> Which is why I'm asking you.
Good, good.<eos> Just a little bit more.<eos> And done.<eos> He'll be in for a few days, at least.<eos> - You have some rest.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> It's seeing him in pain I can't bear.<eos> He'll need his boyfriend healthy.<eos> If the lung doesn't stick, it's going to need to be surgery, but only when he's strong enough.<eos> He'll need you.
There's a lot of big stone, difficult to move, move up<eos> You have plenty of gravel outside the city<eos> What?<eos> Small stones Gravel<eos> Do you understand?<eos> He said there are a lot of small stones outside the city<eos> How do you build a city wall with gravel?<eos> Huo An listen to me<eos> It'll be a mistake to listen to them<eos> He trust you
Now Huo An<eos> Pledge your allegiance to me and I will let you live<eos> How can you be so blind<eos> Dare to speak about truth<eos> I'm Huo An work so hard in the Silk Road<eos> I'm the one who should be a Chief<eos> -What are you doing<eos> Get back here<eos> How can you give Yin Po the Chief position?<eos> You think he will hand over the border to you Just so he can be a chief?
Fear<eos> Terror<eos> Humiliation<eos> When they raze that city<eos> Rebuild it<eos> Whoever shares that city with me is forever my friend<eos> Huo An<eos> Huo An<eos> First Centurion<eos> I entrust my troops to you
Because your father knew of your evil plan<eos> So let me ask you on behalf of your father and brother<eos> What was on your mind when you ended their lives<eos> It's never too late to turn back<eos> Give me your sword<eos> A real hero remains accountable until the end<eos> Right<eos> I did it<eos> Let's resolve this<eos> If I made a mistake in this game of chess It'd be that I looked down upon you
Previously on The Americans...<eos> Directorate S undercover agents supposedly hiding all over the US.<eos> Super-secret identities--<eos> No one has any idea who they are.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> You came!<eos> Just for a second, to, uh, bring over brownies and welcome you to the neighborhood.<eos> What do you do, Stan?<eos> I'm an FBI agent.<eos> Swedish intelligence needs you.
Yes, and I have to preserve the integrity of the...<eos> And it's Petra, right, isn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm here because Professor Stoddart was a British citizen and a wicked person did a terrible thing.<eos> And I want to catch them, same as you.<eos> I have no other agenda.<eos> This is my job, and I'm very good at it.<eos> Now, you are in control of this crime scene, and I will not question that for a second.<eos> Not for a second.<eos> However, I will interpret it for you, and I promise I will tell you absolutely everything that I see.
I give her a lot of credit.<eos> It can't be easy, huh?<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Mr. Proctor.<eos> - Sheriff, Deputy.<eos> Charging me with unlicensed firearms.<eos> That was the best you could do?<eos> Eh, just getting the ball rolling till I can charge you - with the Longshadow murder.<eos> - I'm sure you are, but thanks to you I have an airtight alibi, don't I?
- Is he serious?<eos> - We're on the same side here.<eos> - Get off the res, Billy.<eos> - If Yaz finds out that you're out here...<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who's Yaz?<eos> Karl Yazzie. Chief of the Kinaho PD.<eos> Sounds like someone I should meet.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> I'll take you.<eos> - No, you should probably get in your car and drive away if you know what's good for you.
We have received information... concerning your involvement in espionage.<eos> You can either cooperate with us right now, or, you will be under arrest.<eos> Do you understand, Colonel?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Why do you keep calling me "Colonel"?<eos> You need to get dressed.<eos> We have to search your apartment.<eos> Would you mind if I cleaned my palette?<eos> The paints, it will be ruined otherwise.<eos> It is just behind you there.
As you see.<eos> Of course! I cannot endorse that.<eos> I feel duty-bound to urge you, to cooperate with the U.S. government.<eos> I said no.<eos> Perhaps you could relay to your friends at the CIA that I meant it.<eos> No, no, no. I am not.<eos> I do not work for the agency.<eos> I do not work for the government.<eos> I am here to offer my services as your legal counsel.<eos> If you accept them as such, I work for you.
Do not worry.<eos> I am not afraid to die, Mr. Donovan.<eos> Although. It would not be my first choice.<eos> You left this behind.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much!<eos> You have never asked me, if the charges were true.<eos> If I am indeed a spy.<eos> This is how we do it.<eos> The case against you matters.
He did not kill himself and he let the commies parade on television.<eos> He is the most hated man in America.<eos> After Rudolf Abel, maybe.<eos> And me.<eos> Now wake up!<eos> I have to sleep.<eos> I just have to sleep.<eos> I told you could sleep. Once we talk what need to talk.<eos> You must focus on me.<eos> Your government does not care about you.
I just have to sleep.<eos> I told you could sleep. Once we talk what need to talk.<eos> You must focus on me.<eos> Your government does not care about you.<eos> You know that.<eos> Any of you.<eos> You know that 12 U-2 pilots incurred brain damage.<eos> They are vegetables because of altitude, insufficient oxygen.<eos> They keep you flying, Gary.<eos> You and your friends.
In fact you should not go.<eos> In fact, you cannot go.<eos> We set with the Soviets.<eos> We do not want to screw it up.<eos> - I am not going to screw it up.<eos> - You are not going!<eos> Do not be a pain in the ass.<eos> I ordered.<eos> Enjoy your big American breakfast.<eos> I thought it should be negotiated. At the highest level as a courtesy to you.
Please go.<eos> Walk across.<eos> I can wait.<eos> It is something.<eos> I am not sure yet.<eos> Hang on!<eos> We got him!<eos> I sent you a gift, Jim.<eos> It is a... It is a painting.<eos> I hope it has some meaning to you.
Where do we have next?<eos> Ross-Loma Capital.<eos> Should I keep doing it?<eos> Should I keep negging?<eos> No, no, I'll handle this.<eos> If they want to negotiate using hostility and rudeness... well, they picked the wrong guy.<eos> Well, you see, our main concern is how you're going to achieve escape velocity on your growth rate... hit critical mass.<eos> I'm sorry. What...<eos> What's funny?<eos> It's just that painting behind you.
See, but I really like the job I had.<eos> You know, I was perfectly happy there.<eos> It was kind of the perfect level of involvement for me, I think.<eos> And also' that other guy, Bannerchek, he did not really seem to like me very much.<eos> Oh, he does not. And he wanted you to know that he moved four school-aged children and his elderly mother across the country in order to run Hooli XYZ on his own.<eos> He was very clear about that. And he wanted me to convey that to you.<eos> Have I done that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, what is my job exactly?<eos> Well, that's actually... That's up to you.
We are on schedule, yes?<eos> Because based on your assurances, we've staked substantial resources on its performance.<eos> Gentlemen of the board, and Rachel, listen to me very carefully.<eos> Nucleus is on track. And you have my word that if it fails to be everything we need it to be, someone will be held responsible.<eos> Me?<eos> You want me to come back to Hooli?<eos> No way.<eos> It's too late.<eos> I've accepted MIT's offer of tenure. My wife, my children, and my mother are already back in Boston.<eos> I'm here because I believe in you. And because I believe we didn't believe in you enough before.
No way.<eos> It's too late.<eos> I've accepted MIT's offer of tenure. My wife, my children, and my mother are already back in Boston.<eos> I'm here because I believe in you. And because I believe we didn't believe in you enough before.<eos> Yeah, you did not.<eos> XYZ was beneath your talent.<eos> Surely you felt it.<eos> I did. Why else would I lay it off on Bighetti?<eos> XYZ is about the distant future.<eos> But we can't wait for you.
- Giddy up!<eos> - You in?<eos> -Almost.<eos> - Let's do this, Richard. - Okay.<eos> Shit. "D".<eos> Drive!<eos> Come on, fuck you!<eos> Drive!<eos> Which is why I counsel any young founder today to pursue your dream not for profit or valuation or material wealth, but for the good of humanity.<eos> Which is easy for you to say, being a billionaire.
Uh, that's less than 1% return.<eos> Inflation is, like, 1.7.<eos> I think CDs are 2%. So that's less than a CD.<eos> Well, no one ever got laid putting money in the bank. Am I right?<eos> Those bad boys right there, they're all you.<eos> You gotta flip 'em over.<eos> That side's done.<eos> Listen, Richard, I want to back you.<eos> You build whatever the fuck you've got going in that crazy, fucked-up, genius brain up there.<eos> It's all up to you.
Where are we going?<eos> To execute the third option.<eos> Persuade Captain Vane to surrender the ship.<eos> Governor Ashe?<eos> He's coming here?<eos> Plans are underway as we speak.<eos> When he arrives, I propose that you and I greet him together and we explain to him our joint venture to reclaim Nassau.<eos> My ships, your sugar.<eos> The return of legitimate commerce and the return of law.<eos> For so many years I have watched you and your kind thieve and whore and kill like a plague upon this island, doing whatever you please because you can.
You think I'll be invited to the wedding?<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> I think I want to move this right here, yeah.<eos> Well, if I was you, my son, I would take this one and move it right here.<eos> Because see, you don't want these mens to get over on your side.<eos> You have to protect your queen and your king, so if I was you I would have done that one, that way you can save them.<eos> Hey, Bobby.<eos> Go on over with Leon.<eos> For you, boss.
You know what keeps me up at night?<eos> Knowing that when this cock sucker's done testifying, we're gonna place him in witness protection and buy him an Escalade.<eos> So when no one's looking, why don't you just plant one in the back of his fucking head?<eos> Noah, you do realize we're no longer in Iraq, right?<eos> But the guy they're really after, the big prize, Demetrius Flemmings.<eos> Very popular with the DEA Special Operations Division.<eos> Now, from what I'm told, the only thing more important to Flemmings than money is his family.<eos> Two million dollars cash to whoever finds my nephew.<eos> And that's why I have this.<eos> Let me play it for you.
Louisiana needs the oil industry and the oil industry needs Louisiana.<eos> That was true 100 years ago and it will be true in another 100 years.<eos> The spill was a tragedy, but it is in everyone's best interest to keep American oil healthy.<eos> My husband isn't doubting how reliant our local economy is on industry.<eos> My fund runs a diversified energy portfolio with an emphasis on Gulf producers.<eos> I know you've leaned left on energy in the past, but I'm looking to back a horse that will support our interests.<eos> You can find a lot of politicians around here in the party whose interests align with yours.<eos> - Why me?<eos> - You're a winner.<eos> People are talking about you, Congressman.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.<eos> All right, good job, girls.<eos> Good job. Lucy Hall?<eos> - Kara, take over for a couple minutes, okay?<eos> No problem. I'm a reporter for the Lafitte Gazette.<eos> As uncomfortable as this is, I got to ask about your relationship with Congressman Pryce.<eos> There must be some mistake.<eos> Honestly, I have no idea who you're talking about.<eos> You've been elected twice in a district that is 60 percent African-American and one that has historically elected black officials since the Seventies.<eos> What do you think that says about you?
Hell, fuck the people.<eos> This spill will be over soon, and they'll forgive you.<eos> You just got to fight through it like a man.<eos> - Something funny about what I said?<eos> - Like a man? We're in the middle of a disaster here.<eos> People are suffering and I can't even leave my house.<eos> I've already left these people out to dry.<eos> This ain't about you doing your job...<eos> Of course not.<eos> It was never about that for you.
Chris Wilcox is not going to win.<eos> You can bet on that.<eos> What makes you think I'd do this?<eos> You're standing here.<eos> You want to know how I rationalize it?<eos> I ask myself, would I rather that claims money be in the hands of a bunch of podunk fishermen or invested back into the economy by a corporation who's been creating jobs down here since before I was born.<eos> As for a moratorium, that is just not economically sound for anyone.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> You know what I always found most interesting about politicians is that they're so blinded by delusions of grandeur that they forget who they really are.<eos> In your case, the only thing anyone is going to remember about you is that you fucked a fisherman's wife.
Yeah, it's kind of what we do here.<eos> The exhibit opens to the public in three weeks.<eos> Mr. Masrani wanted me to consult with you.<eos> You wanna consult here or in my bungalow?<eos> That's not funny.<eos> A little funny.<eos> We'd like you to evaluate the paddock for vulnerabilities.<eos> Why me?<eos> I guess Mr. Masrani thinks, since you're able to control the Raptors...<eos> It's all about control with you.
Yeah, definitely him.<eos> Hey! Right here.<eos> Right here.<eos> She looks at what she wants.<eos> Usually what she wants to eat.<eos> The mother hen has finally arrived.<eos> Get the hell out of here and stay away from my animals.<eos> Hoskins, you wanted this to happen, you son of a bitch!<eos> Jesus!<eos> How many more people have to die before this mission starts to make sense to you?
Well...<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Great.<eos> Great.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Are you gonna be okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Where's Hoskins?<eos> He's sending you and the assets to a secure location.
Welcome.<eos> Oh no...<eos> Mufasa!<eos> Wonderful!<eos> Wonderful!<eos> Calm down!<eos> Calm down!<eos> Punjab, the land of Lions!<eos> And especially from Africa..<eos> We've brought a lion for you, which will.. Make you hold your breaths.
Lion, sir.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Come, Mufasa.<eos> Come.<eos> You climbed on the table out of fear.<eos> Don't be scared, sir.<eos> He's a very tame lion, even I was scared of him first.<eos> Why did you bring him here?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Look at him, he already likes you a lot.
You've grown old, dad.<eos> That's why you're happy with the little you have.<eos> But I want to make it big, dad.<eos> I want total control, dad.<eos> Dad!<eos> Hey dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> It's best you die, dad.<eos> Good for you.
Get lost.<eos> Go back to Punjab.<eos> Back to Punjab!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I do know English.<eos> A to Z.<eos> Good.<eos> Keys to the Panjim bungalow.<eos> I'm giving you this because I trust you.
Got her!<eos> Tell her she's very beautiful.<eos> Jesus, what did you get me into?<eos> Come on... tell her now.<eos> Tell her...<eos> Tell her.<eos> He says you're very beautiful.<eos> If he flirts with me... I will kick him.<eos> What did she say?<eos> She expects a lot from you.
"Now you got to tell him something too."<eos> "In every way, I just want to say." "That you are the one, baby I love you."<eos> "Hearing you agree..." "My heart goes..."<eos> "My heart goes..." "My heart goes..."<eos> "My heart says..." "My heart says..."<eos> "My heart says..."<eos> "Bro..."<eos> "You seem like an angel to me."<eos> "Your voice casts a spell on me."<eos> "I just see an angel baby, whenever I look at you."
"My heart says..." "My heart says..."<eos> "My heart says..."<eos> "Bro..."<eos> "You seem like an angel to me."<eos> "Your voice casts a spell on me."<eos> "I just see an angel baby, whenever I look at you."<eos> "When I hear your magic it's making me crazy too."<eos> "I'm going to hold you tight in my arms."<eos> "Just keep staring at me with a smile."<eos> "After falling in love with you.."
I'm having fun.<eos> - Who's the girl?<eos> - Sara.<eos> Huh?<eos> Mom, don't you have anything better to do?<eos> I'm here to work, not to stare at girls.<eos> I'm your mom.<eos> You're away from my sights, but not my thoughts.<eos> Amazing, mom.<eos> I can never hide anything from you.
Come.<eos> Stop this nonsense.<eos> Let me sleep in peace.<eos> Don't you want to go out?<eos> We've been waiting for so long.<eos> I'm not in the mood, nor is Sara.<eos> Hey... what's wrong with you?<eos> It's a pulled muscle.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Now I don't need to be scared of you, Sara's with me.
From today you're my right-hand.<eos> If he's your right-hand, what am I?<eos> Last.<eos> Any problem?<eos> No problem, I just wanted to confirm.<eos> I should know what my position is.<eos> Raftaar.<eos> Raftaar.<eos> Sir.<eos> Should I book a ticket for you to Canada?
I cannot sleep in the new room.<eos> Imli.<eos> Coconut.<eos> - We'll get cramps again.<eos> - Run.<eos> "I strode through your lanes.."<eos> Sorry, sorry... it was a mistake.<eos> Did you find my mother?<eos> It wasn't intentional, I swear.<eos> You don't have to swear, I trust you.
"Come sweetheart and... let me take you in my arms."<eos> "Come sweetheart and... let me take you in my arms."<eos> "Come sweetheart and... let me take you in my arms."<eos> "All I want is you baby, so come and give your love to me."<eos> "This moment feels alright." "Tonight's the night."<eos> "All I want is you baby, so come and give your love to me."<eos> "This moment feels alright." "Tonight's the night."<eos> "You're my life, you're my destiny."<eos> "I am your Romeo, and you're my Juliet."<eos> "How do I convey my love for you?"

It's not safe here.<eos> Till things get sorted out, please lie low.<eos> Take her.<eos> Kirpal.<eos> Yeah, Kirpal.<eos> I want to meet Mark, ASAP!<eos> Brother's back.<eos> Brother Raftaar's back!<eos> Brother Raftaar's back!<eos> Brother, the village felt lonely without you.
You brought her home inside.<eos> Naughty boy.<eos> No, no... stop... stop.<eos> Now sleep.<eos> 'My Sweety is here.' 'My Sweety is here.'<eos> You cured my pain instantly.<eos> Come, sit.<eos> Sit, sit.<eos> So tell me... are you really a guest.<eos> Or is there something cooking between you and my son?
Take her along.<eos> Babli, come here.<eos> Quickly..<eos> Look, you need to... You don't need to take sister around.<eos> Because I will take her sight-seeing.<eos> You just concentrate on your studies.<eos> Go and study.<eos> Naughty boy.<eos> "Sweetheart, your beauty's like the rainbow." "Even the moon...<eos> looks useless when compared to you."
"From 9 to 12, honey."<eos> "When it'll be dark night."<eos> "My heart... will beat gallantly." "I'll hold you in my arms tight."<eos> "O beloved, what did you do?"<eos> "Come in my arms, let me kiss you."<eos> "Come, honey."<eos> "Let's watch a film, honey."<eos> "From 9 to 12, honey."<eos> "I want to climb the mountain and yell out loud..."<eos> "... I want to make you a Punjabi daughter-in-law."
Sara.<eos> My baby...<eos> My sweety...<eos> I love you I missed you so much.<eos> Mom!<eos> I've missed you mom.<eos> I missed you baby.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I was unfair to you.<eos> My work drove me away from you and our daughter.
My baby...<eos> My sweety...<eos> I love you I missed you so much.<eos> Mom!<eos> I've missed you mom.<eos> I missed you baby.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I was unfair to you.<eos> My work drove me away from you and our daughter.<eos> I was still had the wrong opinion about you.. That you got married again.
Sara finally admitted that she loves me.<eos> And even I told her.<eos> I am really happy- Raftaar... very happy.<eos> Bless you two.<eos> Bless you too, mom.<eos> "Come sweetheart and... let me take you in my arms."<eos> "Come sweetheart and... let me take you in my arms."<eos> "You're my life, you're my destiny."<eos> "I am your Romeo, and you're my Juliet."<eos> "How do I convey my love for you?"

Tell me what this means?<eos> Moron... I'll learn your language too.<eos> I am not too great.<eos> Yeah, mom.<eos> Yes, everything's fine out here.<eos> Romania looks really nice from here.<eos> Mom, for the sake of God I'll call you later.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> I'll tell you later.<eos> Will you just keep talking... or pull me up?
"You that-ish..."<eos> "K.I. N.G... We're the kings, with a big heart and bigger courage."<eos> "I squander B.I.G money." "The papers talk only about me."<eos> "I have many sycophants like you back home."<eos> "Come to my home and take a look."<eos> "I even show hospitality to my enemy."<eos> "I am quite capable alone.." "... I can face a million enemies."<eos> "My heart's filled with courage."<eos> "I rule everyone's heart."<eos> "I am different from you baby."
A small fall ... but now it's all right.<eos> You'd better rest.<eos> I'm fine, thanks.<eos> We leave the city.<eos> Oh, very good.<eos> Thank you for everything you have done for Anouk and also for the other children.<eos> Also the parents of Lola move.<eos> Soon there will be no one in the city.<eos> I'm sorry to tell you, but ... but you should leave too.<eos> I know it is difficult for you, but ... we could accommodate you and Chloe.
Number 18.<eos> My name is Audrey Sabatini.<eos> - That's in the submerged zone, isn't it?<eos> . - Yeah.<eos> Where are your parents?<eos> At home.<eos> - Street Jean-Jacques Rousseau is impossible.<eos> - They must have been evacuated.<eos> Evacuated where?<eos> Come with me, I'll deal with you.
So that's it.<eos> You believe you can leap into Miss Guthrie's shoes and lord over what remains of their family's enterprise.<eos> I have no interest in making the same mistakes Eleanor did.<eos> No interest in fencing their plunder.<eos> No interest in lording over them in any way.<eos> For people like us, power in this place is most effective when it is least perceived.<eos> That is my offer to purchase your inherited interest in this tavern.<eos> It is more generous than any of the others received by your colleagues.<eos> I will expect your response by nightfall.<eos> Why is this so important to you?
It caused a little, uh, static with the philosophy department at Adair.<eos> - This is my husband, Paul.<eos> - Hey, how you doin'?<eos> - This is Abe Lucas, philosophy department.<eos> - Good to meet you.<eos> - Yeah. - How you doin' on that?<eos> I'd like another one, please.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Vodka martini, extra olives.<eos> - Anything for you?
You know Abe's mother committed suicide?<eos> Abe again?<eos> I mean, can you imagine?<eos> He was 12.<eos> She drank bleach!<eos> It's so sad.<eos> You know, Simone de Beauvoir pointed out, and quite correctly, that in a society shaped by men, women are seen as relative beings existing only in relationship to men.<eos> - Hmm. - You agree with that?<eos> - I agree with that completely. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> I'm sure you've heard the rumors about you.
If I met someone now, I'm too far gone to appreciate her.<eos> I have to go to my piano lesson.<eos> What are you doing on Friday night?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I think you should come to a party.<eos> - Uh... - I do.<eos> Roy and I will take you.<eos> We can go and it'll...<eos> There'll be music and it'll be fun.<eos> There's a lot of students that like you.
I don't think that's healthy.<eos> You should think about it.<eos> You want to come out?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Hi.<eos> I'm sorry for dropping in so suddenly but, I was shopping today at the liquor store, and, I came across these two very fine bottles of single malt scotch, and I got one for Paul and myself.<eos> And I know how much you love single malt scotch.<eos> Oh, that was very thoughtful of you.<eos> How much do I owe you?<eos> Oh, God, no, I bought it for you.
Have you tried any of the impotence drugs?<eos> It's not physical.<eos> And don't take it personally.<eos> I haven't been able to perform in nearly a year.<eos> Have you seen a shrink?<eos> 'Cause I know a good one for that problem.<eos> I keep hoping it'll come back as mysteriously as it left.<eos> I'm sorry I let you down.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sure it's hell for you.
What, and hide for the rest of your life?<eos> You'd be a fugitive.<eos> I feel for you, Carol, I do.<eos> And you're such a good mother.<eos> I hope the judge gets cancer.<eos> He won't get cancer.<eos> Because wishing doesn't work.<eos> If you want him dead, you have to make it happen.<eos> But you'd never be able to pull it off, and even if you did, you'd be a prime suspect.<eos> On the other hand, I could kill him for you, lady, and no one in the world would dream I did it.
It's one of my favorite places in the world.<eos> Oh, it's so beautiful here.<eos> I can't help thinking of that phrase by Emily Dickinson,<eos> "Inebriate of air."<eos> To be drunk on air.<eos> Not to have to rely on single malt scotch.<eos> You know, you once said that you used to fool around with poetry.<eos> Mmm. Yeah, I destroyed all my poems in a fit of rage, when my funny, sweet friend, this guy I grew up with my whole life, stepped on a fucking land mine in Iraq.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> But you know, maybe if you like, I could try writing again for you.

Saturday mornings, he jogged at Lippitt Park.<eos> He was not well-thought of as a judge and had been censured once or twice, but had never been reversed on appeal because he was smart and also one of the boys.<eos> Why continental philosophy?<eos> Because, you know, continental philosophy deals with problems much more exciting and, and personal than the analytic tradition.<eos> You know, the existentialists were tryin' to find out not just what does something mean, but what does it mean for me?<eos> I never thought I would get you to go to an amusement park.<eos> Where's Roy tonight?<eos> Studying.<eos> Well, I'm mellowing in my old age.<eos> And now that we're here, I'm determined to win you a prize.
God, but, look.<eos> Even in the distorting mirror, you look good.<eos> I hope you don't think I'm some middle-class drone.<eos> I might surprise you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> No, it's a bad idea.<eos> It's a bad idea.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I think it's a little late for that.<eos> You have a terrific boyfriend and he's obviously crazy about you and don't...
I think it's a little late for that.<eos> You have a terrific boyfriend and he's obviously crazy about you and don't...<eos> I know.<eos> And I love Roy.<eos> But it doesn't mean I'm ready to commit to him and give up...<eos> Listen to me, listen to me.<eos> You don't want to get involved with an extremist like me.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I can be just as risk-taking as you.
That wouldn't be fair.<eos> It's too bad.<eos> We had a good thing goin'.<eos> Hey, it's my fault, Roy.<eos> I'm just really not ready to commit to one person.<eos> Dinner was delicious.<eos> And this pie...<eos> - It's so nice of you to have me over.<eos> - Well, we're happy to.<eos> Particularly since Jill always speaks so highly of you.
And then a week later, I got a chance to hear Rita Richards' theory firsthand.<eos> I ran into her in a local bar where she had been sitting alone and drinking, and was a little drunk and talkative.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - How are you, Miss Pollard?<eos> - Great.<eos> - Hi, Kim.<eos> How's it goin'?<eos> Uh, can I catch up to you?<eos> - Hello.<eos> - I was just thinking about you.

- Carlo de' Medici.<eos> We are the Labyrinth.<eos> The servants of the Horned God will seize their opportunity!<eos> You're the Labyrinth?<eos> - Clarice. - Carlo?<eos> You took long enough.<eos> 500,000 florins was withdrawn from the bank.<eos> Now Carlo has gone, someone will have to assume the blame.<eos> Bastard!<eos> Clarice has gone, which makes you, as his mother, the regent head of the House of Medici.
The captor, now the captive.<eos> I see the prisoner has escaped.<eos> Aided by someone within my household.<eos> My dear brother wants my head on a platter and his wearing the Papal crown.<eos> And would endanger his very soul to do so, lying down with those damnable Turkish dogs.<eos> And now, the Prodigal returns.<eos> Planning your escape, Father?<eos> How dare you call me that?<eos> Holy Father I am so very sorry.<eos> I prostrate myself before you.
Anything his heart - or other organs desired, I suppose.<eos> My husband kept a suite here, I believe.<eos> I-I don't know what you mean, signora.<eos> A place of respite during those long banking excursions to Rome, Naples...<eos> I swear to you...<eos> A place where he could bring one of his whores for a good fuck.<eos> This way.<eos> We haven't had the pleasure of his company for some time.<eos> Neither have I.<eos> Will he be joining you?
Coach, I'm writing a story about legendary Texas football players, and you're a legend yourself.<eos> Was I a player?<eos> Why, yes.<eos> You were a great football player for the Oklahoma Sooners in the late 1940s.<eos> I'll be doggone.<eos> I knew that.<eos> But you coached UT and won three national championships.<eos> Yes.<eos> Texas had 30 All-American players while you were coaching.<eos> Which one had the greatest impact on you and the program?
No, sir.<eos> What is it, son?<eos> Well, every other coach just thought I was too small to play.<eos> Too small.<eos> Well, I'm 5'10".<eos> I was an okay college football player.<eos> Okay?<eos> He quarterbacked the University of Oklahoma to an undefeated season in 1949.<eos> Mike.<eos> You want me to play here for you?
Looks like we're the only ones left on the team that still get our hair cut every week.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> You could be right.<eos> Who is that young woman I see you with all the time?<eos> That's Linda, my girlfriend.<eos> We've been together since her junior year.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I first laid eyes on Edith in high school.<eos> Fell in love faster than a hiccup.<eos> Well, I hope we end up together as happy as you and Mrs. Royal.
Yeah, you live it, I write it.<eos> - Welcome. - Hello.<eos> - All moved in? - Hello. Yes.<eos> - Was the move good?<eos> - Yes, thank you.<eos> Well done.<eos> It's a pretty house.<eos> Not as big as ours, of course, but then you're unattached.<eos> No, it's attached to the house behind.<eos> I mean you.
- The hamster.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> We were just saying how grateful she'll be.<eos> Put the van in your drive?<eos> That never occurred to me.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know. It might not be convenient.<eos> No, I've thought it over.<eos> Believe me, Miss Shepherd, it's all right. Just till you sort yourself out.<eos> Well, not convenient for you!
Have you insured it?<eos> I don't need insuring.<eos> It's like the van, I'm insured in heaven.<eos> So, who pays if you have an accident, the Pope?<eos> I shan't have an accident.<eos> Well, what if you run into something?<eos> I shan't run into anything.<eos> I'm an experienced driver.<eos> I drove ambulances in the blackout.<eos> Well, what if someone runs into you?

We all have names.<eos> Perhaps if you called her by her name and she called you by yours,<eos> "Alan! "Mary", you never know, it might be easier to talk things through.<eos> Through?<eos> There is no through.<eos> How do you talk things through with someone who has conversations with the Virgin Mary?<eos> You talk things through with Isaiah Berlin, maybe, who, in comparison with Miss Shepherd, is a man of few words.<eos> You do not talk things through with her because you don't get through.<eos> Alan, I'm getting a bit of hostility here.<eos> I realise for you this may be a steep learning curve. No.
- Not upset about your play? - No.<eos> I read a good review the other day.<eos> - I was told they were all good.<eos> - They are, I'm sure.<eos> We enjoyed it.<eos> Though I hadn't realised it was just going to be you and nobody else.<eos> Well, yes. It's a monologue.<eos> Yes, I suppose.<eos> I'm just amazed how you remember it all.<eos> The review I read was particularly perceptive about you.
- Why not? It's a public place.<eos> Hey... How long before your flight leave?<eos> Fly out of Bangkok?<eos> How many days you have to wait?<eos> Three days.<eos> Take it, go get yourself a decent room,<eos> Order in, stay in until you have to leave for the airport, understood?<eos> Take it.<eos> Take it and go.<eos> What can I do for you, gentlemen?
Jojo's Japanese.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm gonna ask you a few questions, and you're better give me straight, you understand?<eos> - What was your relationship with Angel?<eos> - I'm in love with her.<eos> You're married.<eos> You love your wife too?<eos> Was Angel in love with you?
This isn't a good idea. She's not trained for this, sergeant.<eos> We'll have eyes on her in the restaurant, he's not gonna try anything in public.<eos> It's not him I'm worried about. I have no idea what she'll do from one moment to the next.<eos> She's completely unreliable.<eos> - Reckless?<eos> - Yes.<eos> That's why I like her.<eos> Reminds me of myself at that age.<eos> You're not gonna ruin my little trip down nostalgia lane, are you?<eos> There's nothing nostalgic about you, sergeant.
Wow, that's a great indoor activity.<eos> - Yeah. - You...<eos> You look amazing.<eos> He's on fire, huh?<eos> He's so excited.<eos> The pirate looks perfect, thank you very much.<eos> And we'll see you tomorrow, yeah?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Happy Halloween!<eos> Happy Halloween to you, too, Rosa.
We've been tricked!<eos> About-face... Head back!<eos> There is no army here... It's just cattle!<eos> We have managed to trick them!<eos> Their cannons have been swerved.<eos> Mastani, reach inside the fort through the secret tunnel... And signal me once inside.<eos> We'll be ready for attack.<eos> Mastani!<eos> The Maratha army is here, father.<eos> Bundelkhand is forever indebted to you...
Mastani, reach inside the fort through the secret tunnel... And signal me once inside.<eos> We'll be ready for attack.<eos> Mastani!<eos> The Maratha army is here, father.<eos> Bundelkhand is forever indebted to you...<eos> - There is no debt in duty, father.<eos> Go ahead and declare war, I'll signal the Peshwa.<eos> Attack!<eos> Congratulations on your victory, Peshwa.<eos> I wish you and Mastani the same.
To others, this may be a battle scar... But for me, you are the moon bathed in colour.<eos> The poison had to be stopped from spreading.<eos> I've seen your wounds, Mastani... You are no longer a Rajput.<eos> What you see is merely the mark of your sword.<eos> But it is my heart that bleeds.<eos> Even the Peshwa has a heart!<eos> " On this festival of colours "<eos> Paint me red in the colour of love.<eos> Oh you playful one, like Lord Krishna.<eos> I'm mesmerised looking at you...
The Peshwa gave it to me!<eos> Dear God!<eos> And you accepted it?<eos> Don't you know that as per the custom in Bundelkhand... A girl is married to a man by accepting his dagger!<eos> Did you accept it?<eos> I accepted it.<eos> And he?<eos> Your paan.<eos> And if I weren't awake?<eos> I would will the night to go on for eternity... And gaze upon you forever.
My lady, it was unwise to send our soldiers home.<eos> We are in a strange land, surrounded by strangers.<eos> You never know what problems might arise.<eos> What kind of people would house a guest amongst courtesans.<eos> And that too the daughter of King Chatrasaal.<eos> Swords would be raised in Bundelkhand if they caught wind of this.<eos> Yet you sit here silently...<eos> I know you feel humiliated, My Lady.<eos> Let us return home rather than be insulted here.<eos> If he truly loves you, the Peshwa will come after you, to Bundelkhand.
A splendid dancer like Mastani to entertain us!<eos> Chimaji, see to it our hospitality towards Mastani Saheba is in no way lacking.<eos> Of course... Rest assured I will.<eos> She's lodged at Hirabagh Palace.<eos> Send a messenger to tell her I shall visit this evening.<eos> That won't be possible.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you must leave for the capital today, My Lord.<eos> I can do that tomorrow.<eos> His Majesty awaits you, you must present yourself there on time.
Reign in your tongue...<eos> Understood?<eos> To the capital!<eos> Welcome, Bajirao.<eos> You were impatiently awaited.<eos> You summoned and here I am, Your Majesty.<eos> Congratulations on Bundelkhandl<eos> I had this sword of Afghan iron forged in your honour.<eos> I am honoured.<eos> My King, now permit me to use this sword to bring Delhi to its knees before you.
What is this Bajirao!<eos> The power of your love Mastani!<eos> I wish you on your victory.<eos> And I wish you a happy Eid.<eos> Your face is glowing Mastani.<eos> Because you have returned.<eos> It's like the glow in the sky, just before sunrise...<eos> We'll have to think of a name for our to-be born child!<eos> My Lady!<eos> There's a message for you from the Peshwa's mother...
Never mind, we can invite them back tomorrow and celebrate twice over.<eos> Why twice?<eos> Mastani is about to become the mother of my child.<eos> If the Brahmins walked out because you chose to celebrate Eid with her... What'll they do when this news gets out, Bajirao?<eos> Mother...<eos> Don't interrupt me!<eos> I suggest, we don't tell Kashi.<eos> What is there to hide mother?<eos> The truth is, what it is!<eos> Kashi... I have been looking for you all over and here you are.
Jhumri...<eos> My Lady!<eos> What news have you brought, Veer Singh?<eos> I couldn't deliver your message to the Peshwa even today...<eos> News is that he is very ill and unable to meet anyone.<eos> Get the palanquin ready.<eos> I shall go to meet him right away.<eos> This news could be false, My Lady...<eos> It could be true!<eos> Going to Shaniwar Wada at this hour could be dangerous for you.
Who is it?<eos> It is Ambaji Panth's daughter-in-law.<eos> So where is Gopikabai's palanquin... They had left together.<eos> Shall I find out?<eos> No, I'll go myself.<eos> Mastani Saheba, please wait at the Palace of Mirrors... I shall inform the Peshwa.<eos> Mastani, what brings you here at this hour?<eos> Bajirao.<eos> You shouldn't have risked your life by coming here.<eos> There's no bigger risk to my life than spending a moment without you.
You fight Muslims and yet fell in love with one of them?<eos> I fight the Mughal dynasty, not their religion.<eos> I ask you one last time...<eos> Bajirao shall remain Peshwa only if Mastani is accepted...<eos> Agreed?<eos> No.<eos> It's yours!<eos> Bajirao<eos> Kashi!<eos> I've been looking for you all over.
We've been related for years -<eos> What relation?<eos> Say?<eos> The man you are married to, is my husband as well.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> But as far as I know, when a married man.. ...takes another wife, she's known as a concubine...<eos> It is such a heavy word...<eos> There is a simpler term for it...<eos> Mistress<eos> Such mockery is unbecoming of you.
Rao's happiness lies with you and mine with his...<eos> That's my purpose.<eos> Here, put.<eos> This is the hand he holds...<eos> He prefers holding his sword to my hand...<eos> But he holds your hand dearer than any sword.<eos> He has held my hand without letting go of yours...<eos> He has loved me, but not broken ties with you.<eos> He may call me his inspiration, but you remain his strength...<eos> His love for you has not withered.

Who is not?<eos> Everyone is intoxicated.<eos> By wealth, religion, power... Pratinidhi, Krishna Bhatt are all intoxicated.<eos> So am I...<eos> I am intoxicated by love!<eos> You are unsteady, My Lord!<eos> My feet may be unsteady but my grip is firm.<eos> What say, Malhar Rao?<eos> Look!<eos> That is why we need you to win this battle for us, Peshwa.
What say, Malhar Rao?<eos> Look!<eos> That is why we need you to win this battle for us, Peshwa.<eos> I am no longer the Peshwa!<eos> But you are our Commander.<eos> I am not a Commander either.<eos> When you first learnt to ride, we ran alongside your horse.<eos> We put in as much sweat as your steed.<eos> Malhar Rao fought battles beside you, suffered injuries to uphold your honour.<eos> Tukoji nursed you despite being wounded himself.
You don't know when it hits you!<eos> My Lord!<eos> What are you doing here, Veer Singh?<eos> Nana Saheb has arrested Mastani Saheba!<eos> Bajirao!<eos> Go with Bajirao.<eos> Prepare for attack!<eos> It's your last chance to return to Bundelkhand.<eos> I wouldn't have allowed these shackles if I planned to return.<eos> My hatred for you goes beyond its very essence, Mastani.
-Alan, tell me what's going on.<eos> -Is everything all right?<eos> I'd like to get back to work.<eos> What do these carvings mean?<eos> They don't mean anything.<eos> Then why'd you run out of here as soon as you saw them?<eos> You say you want to stop an outbreak.<eos> How do I know you're telling the truth?<eos> You don't.<eos> Then why should I believe you?
I used to know people like you.<eos> People who thought they were better than me.<eos> But Michael's opened my eyes so I can be free of your judgment.<eos> I thought you deserved to know the truth.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's Soren's bear.<eos> You said he took it with him.<eos> -He did.<eos> -Then why did I find it with another child?<eos> I don't believe you.
Well, many of our followers come here trying to escape their past.<eos> We offer them a fresh start.<eos> No judgment.<eos> Does that include terrorists?<eos> This man is a wanted criminal.<eos> Our gates are open.<eos> We turn no one away.<eos> Did you have any of these problems before Jerome arrived?<eos> These problems began when you arrived.<eos> Doesn't make you a terrorist, does it?
I am Mademoiselle Durant.<eos> I never could get used to the contact lenses.<eos> Don't be so surprised.<eos> You know we come in all sizes.<eos> I hear you met that little shit who calls himself "The Scythe."<eos> I did.<eos> It's because of people like him that there are people like me and Madame Wallenberg.<eos> What kind of people are you?<eos> The kind who know damn well you cannot change the system from within.<eos> A young person's mistake, but there's hope for you yet.
You have to believe me.<eos> Actually, I don't.<eos> See, that's the beauty of me standing here and you being locked in there.<eos> Look, you want to find Dr. Jordan, right?<eos> -I can tell you where she is.<eos> -What do you know?<eos> -Let me out and I'll tell you.<eos> -Tell me and I'll think about letting you out.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> I like you better under glass.
We need to get in, find Michael and the infertility biotech quickly and quietly.<eos> And what if Michael doesn't want to cooperate?<eos> Then we reason with him.<eos> I haven't heard from Peter in five days.<eos> Who knows what we're walking into?<eos> I don't want to use force unless it's absolutely necessary.<eos> It might be.<eos> Dr. Jordan, I thought I might find you here.<eos> The curious scientist.<eos> Is this some kind of game to you, you crazy bitch?
And your opinion is noted.<eos> Anyway, it didn't work.<eos> They lived a few weeks, which isn't bad but ultimately a dead end.<eos> You see, he could only use the jar for a baby that never grew.<eos> One frozen in its development.<eos> As if it were immortal.<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Look, I don't care about you or your little tadpole.
-Sorry, fresh out.<eos> Try some.<eos> Smells great, but I'm not hungry.<eos> I see.<eos> You're too good to eat at my table?<eos> Got one of the good bits.<eos> The eyes are the best part.<eos> Really, I couldn't.<eos> Well, that's it.<eos> I said I'd look after you but if you're gonna bad-mouth my cooking....

Booby trap.<eos> We are getting close.<eos> Closer than you think.<eos> I doubt the Mycotics are into Juicy Fruit.<eos> It worked.<eos> I did it.<eos> Now we transfer it to a clean syringe and when you're ready, we reverse the procedure and inject it into your spine.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> This was what you wanted.<eos> I'm not sure I trust you.

Blue's my favorite color.<eos> Tastes great with honey.<eos> You eat the honey?<eos> Of course we do.<eos> -Isn't that dangerous?<eos> -No.<eos> I keep a jar of it all to myself.<eos> Don't tell Caddie.<eos> That's- - That's funny.<eos> He said the same thing about you.
I really wish you had come to me first.<eos> Anne is prone to delusions.<eos> You can't believe a word she says.<eos> Really?<eos> She told us the only way to replicate your apples is by grafting a special root-stock you call Mother.<eos> Be honest with me.<eos> Why is Mother so important to you?
-You failed.<eos> Look at him.<eos> He can't even talk.<eos> And I need to talk to him.<eos> I can't treat unless I can diagnose what's wrong.<eos> And I can't do that unless I have an EEG, or scan.<eos> You're boring me.<eos> Just fix him.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Then I see no reason for keeping you or your child alive.
I need guarantees concerning the origins of your fortune.<eos> And Valeria told you... how much I am going to donate?<eos> - No, no--<eos> - Look, I am not a politician.<eos> I am not a successful lawyer like you.<eos> I come from the street... brother.<eos> I want to reassure you that you will receive your piece.<eos> - It's not about that--<eos> - Assuming your piece is ten percent, your piece would be what?<eos> $300,000 just for you.
- How long have you had this picture?<eos> - That's classified.<eos> And what am I doing here?<eos> It's not America's role to get involved in other countries' elections.<eos> Once again, the hand of the United States remains invisible.<eos> Your party took money from Escobar.<eos> I should think you'd want to get ahead of this.<eos> Everyone took money.<eos> By the way, it's all American money, so why don't you take this to the press?<eos> It should come from you.
We want you to record a conversation.<eos> It's very simple, nothing to worry about.<eos> All right.<eos> - How are you feeling?<eos> - I'm...<eos> I'm very happy.<eos> Thank you very much for the opportunity, Don Pablo.<eos> Seriously.<eos> And for the clothes.<eos> Really, for me, it's an honor to work for you.
How would I know?<eos> Who are you?<eos> You work for Escobar?<eos> You can call me Gorilla.<eos> Gorilla.<eos> Very well...<eos> Gorilla.<eos> Where's my crew?<eos> Did you bring them here as well?<eos> I'm here to guard you.
Just put it on.<eos> Pleasure to finally meet you, Ms. Turbay.<eos> Sit down, please.<eos> I suppose you want me to interview you?<eos> No, even better.<eos> I'm going to interview you.<eos> So you can tell the world about the humane treatment you've received here.<eos> Don't you want your parents to know you're well?<eos> That you're alive?<eos> I don't want to become a piece of propaganda for you.
María Clara, connect me with DAS, immediately.<eos> - No. No.<eos> - Cancel the call.<eos> - This time, we will not negotiate.<eos> - I don't understand, Mr. President.<eos> If Sandoval dies... I will have it on my conscience for the rest of my life.<eos> But my country comes first, and I will not empower Escobar.<eos> Send in the Special Forces... and finish this, once and for all.<eos> I just realized something.<eos> The president didn't just betray me... he also betrayed you.
We spoke with Pablo, and he is willing to negotiate.<eos> Ten of my men have just been killed.<eos> Is that how you guys begin negotiations?<eos> Two things, Pacho.<eos> First... Mr. Galeano and I had nothing to do with those deaths.<eos> And the second thing... this is war, Pacho.<eos> There are deaths everywhere, and we have casualties as well.<eos> We are willing to pay three million dollars - to settle the dispute in Los Angeles.<eos> Pablo won't accept anything under $12 million, Pacho.<eos> Twelve million is nothing to you.
It's over.<eos> What's over?<eos> - The Medellín cartel.<eos> No, you're wrong, Pacho.<eos> We export twice the amount you do.<eos> You invited me here to give me this line of bullshit?<eos> Pablo put a war tax on the two of you for $250,000 a month.<eos> That's how he treats his friends and associates?<eos> Don't forget that, thanks to Mr. Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, extradition was abolished.<eos> That serves you very well, doesn't it?
You act as if I'm asking you to do something you don't feel comfortable with.<eos> Clearly, your track record speaks otherwise.<eos> Why me?<eos> You have the skills of a cop and the constitution of a cold-blooded killer.<eos> What better combination could there be?<eos> Besides, I think we both can agree that we share at least one common goal, don't we?<eos> Out with the old, in with the new, and all that.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Let's shake and make it official.<eos> First, I need something from you.
Do what?<eos> You take care of yourself.<eos> I apologize that you've had to spend some time down here.<eos> After all, it was all about maintaining appearances, am I right?<eos> Indeed, I am.<eos> I heard you put on quite a show.<eos> Still, while we have an agreement, I can't have you...<eos> We have no agreement.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I don't need you anymore.
- Are you threatening me?<eos> - Do you feel threatened?<eos> You're a dead man, Danvers.<eos> - You know that, right?<eos> - From day one.<eos> I believe an apology is in order.<eos> So...<eos> Go on.<eos> Danvers.<eos> I placed an official transfer request for you this morning.
Not her.<eos> She's remarkable.<eos> You're enjoying your work.<eos> Oh, I'm so grateful for this chance.<eos> Such a rare specimen.<eos> The opportunities to study mutation...<eos> Don't confuse your true purpose, nurse Sondra!<eos> What we need from her is her wolf blood.<eos> Of... of course.<eos> Everything I do is for you.
Clearly you don't have kids, Agent Rollins.<eos> Has she said anything?<eos> We were waiting for your expertise.<eos> You guys don't have a lot of time.<eos> The grandmother has given us permission to question the girl, but the dad's on his way back from a trip, so...<eos> Let's get started.<eos> Rollins, a word, please?<eos> Sir.<eos> I know there's some talk going around about Agent Bennigan.<eos> I'm gonna take a guess and say it's the same folks talking about you.
-Okay.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm not disagreeing with you.<eos> In fact, there have been a number of class action lawsuits against Clonestra, but they have been in regards to the nuclear and the chemical plants.<eos> And those cases, have mostly been settled.<eos> Okay, and why not their food?<eos> Well, with Clonestra's production of agent orange, for example, if the people in the town where the plant is based have an overwhelming propensity towards cancer, it can be directly correlated to the plant producing known<eos> Okay, and if my son has a rare disease that can be traced back to GM food, how is that any different?<eos> Because GM foods in this country do not require labeling.<eos> So, from a legal standpoint, it would be incredibly difficult for you to prove an illness and trace it back to the GM process.
What the hell is going on here?<eos> Just give me a second.<eos> -I've never been shown these documents.<eos> I understand the corn was long before your time.<eos> But the chicken?<eos> Do you really feel that that's ready to be sold in supermarkets?<eos> Well...<eos> Look, I think modern industrial farming helps farmers.<eos> No!<eos> With all due respect, modern industrial farming helps you.
Dan... this is classic activist rhetoric.<eos> She's hysterical.<eos> She's a hysterical woman with a sick son.<eos> She has no arguments that we haven't heard before.<eos> Those tests were disregarded for a reason... as are the speculations about the chicken.<eos> That's all they are, speculation.<eos> It's not science.<eos> The press is waiting.<eos> In the meantime,<eos> The first transgenic chicken is headed to a supermarket near you.
Your son is a magnificent young man, had you noticed?<eos> What you mean?<eos> Mr Vedder, my offer...<eos> Fifty.<eos> This bill of exchange for a few thousand. Any bank will cash it.<eos> See it as an advance and move house.<eos> Please, there's no time left.<eos> Who says I am going to sell?<eos> Send Henkenhaf and I will deal with him.<eos> Mr Henkenhaf has no time for you, I'm sorry.
I presume that Mr Ebert has been sacked.<eos> And that Henkenhaf himself will appear.<eos> They have no choice.<eos> They've got simply no choice.<eos> I'm moving in with relatives near here.<eos> And your shop?<eos> - What shop?<eos> I have zero customers now.<eos> I will badly need that money soon.<eos> Parcel for you.
Applied for a passport?<eos> What a lot of noise!<eos> Doesn't it trouble you?<eos> - No, not really.<eos> I am g0ir19--- ...to America.<eos> On behalf of all Amsterdamers I wish to thank Dr Cuypers for his unique creation.<eos> This magnificent building will be the entrance gate to our city.<eos> I hereby solemnly declare the Amsterdam Central Station opened!<eos> STUBBORN BOARD OF DIRECTORS<eos> Mr Vedder, mail for you.
Ubi bene ibi patria.<eos> Go with God.<eos> Thank you for everything, Doctor.<eos> - I'm glad I could help.<eos> Will you think of me sometimes?<eos> Look what I've got for you.<eos> This is for all of you, on the way.<eos> It's against sea-sickness.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We've also got something for you.
We all went in different directions.<eos> We were now in the land of unlimited possibilities.<eos> Some went to Michigan, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma.<eos> We stayed in New York.<eos> Look, Dad'.<eos> - We changed our name to Benjamin.<eos> That was my grandfather's name whose mohel box is now yours.<eos> I've found employment now and the first thing I bought...<eos> We will never forget the person to whom we owe all this.<eos> To you, Doctor Anijs and Mr Vedder.
Jane!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Jane!<eos> Hey, Jane!<eos> Don't go in there!<eos> Jane!<eos> Get back over here!<eos> I'm not armed.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I can help you and your brother.
Well, I'm a student of the form.<eos> Just wanted to shake your hand.<eos> You think I'm a fraud.<eos> I don't think you're a fraud.<eos> You are a fraud.<eos> You might just be looking at your reflection in a mirror.<eos> Then make a prediction for me.<eos> So you can mock it?<eos> Maybe.<eos> There's a thing inside you.
Are you arresting me?<eos> If that's how you want it.<eos> Gabriel, is everything all right?<eos> Call my sister.<eos> Hey.<eos> I heard you had a spell.<eos> How are you feeling now?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I get tired but I'm okay.<eos> There's something different about you from the last time we talked.
Do you know where?<eos> Did he say anything to you?<eos> Elena?<eos> I need you to answer me.<eos> Last night, I saw Morton.<eos> And he was pulling up the carpet in his room.<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> He can't prove anything.<eos> I don't want your protection, Dan.<eos> I don't want anything from you.
Hildur?<eos> Things happened last week That were unacceptable on a professional level.<eos> And I, too, feel bound to air them to the mainland.<eos> What?<eos> Like what?<eos> Sheriff Anderssen was out of control, And you covered for him.<eos> I treated Frank Sutter after Dan arrested him.<eos> Anywhere else but here there would be an inquiry And he would lose his job.<eos> Oh, so y-you want Dan to lose his job or what?<eos> That is up to the mainland to decide, and not you And not those cozy circles that you foster in this town.
You used that phone, and you called London.<eos> You told him I murdered Stoddart.<eos> Just as I murdered Pettigrew.<eos> I told you About my feelings for Elena.<eos> I trusted you with that.<eos> The same day, Morton brings her in for questioning.<eos> Threatens to ruin her whole life.<eos> Just to get at me.<eos> No, that's not right.<eos> I trusted you, Henry.
I've been told it's family only.<eos> Just you and your wife?<eos> That's right.<eos> What shall I say to the Spanish girl If she comes back?<eos> She said she was a friend of the family.<eos> She was here?<eos> Yes, last night.<eos> Liam was asleep.<eos> She just talked to him.<eos> To be honest, we did feel sorry for you, Me and Pettie.
You told me all about it once.<eos> You mean a tupilaq. That's it.<eos> A tupilaq.<eos> If I was a shaman, I would tell you that there is no such thing anymore.<eos> If I was a shaman,<eos> I would tell you that to complete a tupilaq according to all the old rituals, the creature must be finally baptized in the blood of a murderer.<eos> Do you follow me?<eos> Otherwise it will have no power.<eos> Now... where would a shaman lay his hands on half a pint of murderer's blood?<eos> May I join you?
So you brought them here. That's right.<eos> But now you and your wife are separated.<eos> And that's none of your business.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> You know, I look at pictures of, uh, Helicopter squadrons in the British army,<eos> And I see all these white, freckled... Uh, hooray harry... Or Henry or whatever-whatever it is...<eos> Fellas, you know, British army officer class.<eos> But what I... You know what I don't see?<eos> I don't see black faces.<eos> I don't see you.
No.<eos> No, I did none of this.<eos> You what? I did none of this.<eos> Billy Pettigrew.<eos> When I asked you, the other day, If he had stayed at that hotel-- The day I met you--<eos> Billy Pettigrew.<eos> He was eaten by a polar bear.<eos> You knew him, though.<eos> Why is he asking her this?<eos> I served him coffee like I serve you coffee.
Now, this little fellow here has great power.<eos> He's a tupilaq.<eos> My God.<eos> I think there's something very bad going on in this place. I...<eos> I'm going to leave here, and you should, too.<eos> Leave?<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Henry?<eos> I'll tell Liam about you.
By confirmation bias.<eos> What's-what's that?<eos> It's where you look for results to suit your theory because your self-esteem has become more important than a scientific truth.<eos> Okay, we won't know until we do the procedure on the child.<eos> Thank you. Don't thank me. It's the truth.<eos> I was being ironic.<eos> You mean sarcastic.<eos> All right. Enough.<eos> Everything I do from now on is breakage and loss.<eos> Less of you left.
I'll get you home.<eos> No.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We'll stay here.<eos> Someone else will come.<eos> Do you know that?<eos> Tell me.<eos> What?<eos> Truth.<eos> I think about you all the time.
And you can't even see it.<eos> 0-1-6-9...<eos> Hey, hey, hey...<eos> Yuri. Drinks!<eos> Drinks!<eos> Elena.<eos> Hey.<eos> Your boys need putting on the ferry.<eos> Sort yourself up.<eos> Look at you.
Destroy me.<eos> I'd never hurt you.<eos> I would never hurt you, you hear me?<eos> You are in here.<eos> You're part of me.<eos> I would never hurt you. I would never hurt you.<eos> I would kill anybody who hurt you.<eos> I'd kill myself if I hurt you.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Forgiveness for what is inside you?
It's a long way to the Rhine and it's my job to make sure these boys get home safe.<eos> That's really sweet of you, Sergeant.<eos> Your orders are simple, you just follow mine.<eos> We clear?<eos> Crystal.<eos> Tomorrow we prepare for that mission, soldiers.<eos> So you can get us all killed?<eos> Lieutenant, Lieutenant...<eos> I guess tomorrow you formally join the U.S. Army for the first time, Sergeant.<eos> Soldiers, 0500 hours tomorrow, be ready. That includes you, Sergeant.
Last season on Penny Dreadful...<eos> Do you believe there is a demimonde?<eos> A place in the shadows, rarely seen, but deeply felt.<eos> I believe in curses.<eos> I believe in demons. I believe in monsters.<eos> Do you?<eos> What might I do for you?
Women.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Like the others?<eos> Those with the creature we killed?<eos> Not by a long shot.<eos> Miss Ives.<eos> Vanessa.<eos> Can you speak to me?<eos> Mr. Chandler.<eos> Can I do anything for you?
Now!<eos> - Let her live, now!<eos> - Now!<eos> Now!<eos> Now! - Now! - Now!<eos> Now!<eos> Now!<eos> Master.<eos> My beloved Lucifer.<eos> I have found her for you and she shall be yours.
Do you know what that's like?<eos> No.<eos> But I understand the fear of twisting things that move at night.<eos> Tell me I deserve peace.<eos> I'm a poor minister for that, Vanessa.<eos> That's not been my life.<eos> But this I do know.<eos> I'll not leave your side.<eos> Wherever we walk, we walk together.<eos> I don't know what I would do without you.
Well, who's good at puzzles?<eos> Doctor?<eos> Down here.<eos> Cosmetically, she is transformed.<eos> Who could recognize the woman she was?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Language came back quickly.<eos> - Her memory?<eos> No. I don't remember you.
Leave everything you were outside this door.<eos> Everything you are, bring with you.<eos> Clean that off your face.<eos> Makes you look like an animal.<eos> I know you been with a man so you're closer to the beasts than the angels, yeah?<eos> Why are you on the moor?<eos> No one come here without they want to see me. Unless you're a poacher, which you don't look.<eos> I came to see you.<eos> You can sit.<eos> Even where I come from, we've heard of you.
Ah, Mr. Clare... it hurts me to create them.<eos> Like I'm bringing them to life and then torturing them.<eos> Like some sort of terrible African voodoo doll.<eos> They're all fresh when they come out of the molds... and then I make them suffer.<eos> Some people think that's what life is.<eos> Born fresh to suffer.<eos> Do you think that?<eos> Uh... I did.<eos> Now I'm not sure.<eos> There's hope for you anyway.
Do I look like a scholar?<eos> No, you look like a...<eos> I don't know what you look like.<eos> A train robber.<eos> Have you ever been out West?<eos> You mean like California?<eos> - And the New Mexico territory.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Adventures to come.<eos> Then he must have come to see you.
Not a one.<eos> Well, then, I'm not quite sure what I'm doing here, Inspector Rusk.<eos> Because... you're a mystery.<eos> - And you don't like mysteries.<eos> - I like order.<eos> And peaceable streets upon which to walk.<eos> As do I.<eos> There was something different about the Mariner's Inn.<eos> There was a survivor.<eos> That must be useful to you.
Well, people who were there seem to have a way of forgetting things.<eos> Well, it was a forgettable place.<eos> Not to me.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - You know my name.<eos> I know your stage name.<eos> We've been cabling our American colleagues for information on an "Ethan Chandler" with few useful results thus far.<eos> I have reams of documents on a farmer in Iowa, and a cotton grower in Louisiana... and... a chemist in New York.<eos> All men... without mystery.<eos> That must be frustrating for you.
I saw your eyes light on hers.<eos> It's the oddest thing, Miss Ives.<eos> My whole life, I thought I was bound to live with exceptionality.<eos> I was not like my brothers.<eos> I was resolutely this disjointed thing, this freakish thing.<eos> So, I came to celebrate what uniqueness I had.<eos> And now?<eos> I wear a flower.<eos> I find, lo and behold I'm just like everyone else.<eos> Then I'm glad for you.
No more than a touch of warmth in the winter of his years.<eos> I've known him for some time and never like this.<eos> You're a friend of his late-daughter, I believe.<eos> And his late-wife.<eos> Such a tragedy.<eos> Life does batter at us.<eos> But we must persevere with spirit for as long as we possibly can.<eos> It's the trick to staying young, don't you think?<eos> That's not a trick I seek.<eos> He speaks very highly of you, Mrs. Poole.

A dizzying panorama, isn't it?<eos> All toys of love out of the box and scattered around the floor.<eos> And at the end of the night to be put carefully away.<eos> These terrible games.<eos> And do you ever play?<eos> Or only spectate?<eos> I never learned the rules.<eos> The complications, as Dr. Frankenstein said to me like the workings in a watch.<eos> My dear Miss Ives, will you let me escort you home?<eos> This place isn't safe for you.
Would you think it bold... - ...if I compliment your eyes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Be still your heart, doctor, Mr. Gray is being a proper host to a new guest.<eos> You're smarter than that, Miss Ives.<eos> I believe we make ourselves who we are.<eos> The blood's on our hands, not God's.<eos> Whoever you have made yourself, I'm here to accept you.<eos> We're together for a reason.<eos> Will you let me escort you home?<eos> This place isn't safe for you.
The leopard consumes the monkey and becomes leopard and monkey.<eos> The crocodile consumes the leopard and becomes crocodile and leopard and monkey.<eos> I have seen this.<eos> The shamans in my mountains call it Uchawi Mabasiliko the changing from one skin into another.<eos> The ones so cursed do not always fully remember it this becoming.<eos> Is it a sickness?<eos> Or is it something else?<eos> Is it a blessing the purpose of which we cannot yet see?<eos> I say this is what it is for I know you, my friend, Ethan Chandler.<eos> I see inside you past the crocodile and the leopard and the monkey. And the wolf.
Then why trust Mr. Chandler to go with you?<eos> Because he wasn't there.<eos> You were all in the room with me, and yet the lions still hunted.<eos> We'll leave immediately.<eos> Yes.<eos> Doctor, may I have a word?<eos> I want to tell you alone where I plan to go.<eos> - Are you sure that's a good idea?<eos> - Someone has to know.<eos> I trust you.
Wood betony attracts bees for honey crushed and put into your pillow, it prevents nightmares.<eos> - Get a lot of that.<eos> When I was with Miss Croft I was more content than I ever thought I could be.<eos> For once in my life, I didn't feel like running away.<eos> I felt I had a place to belong.<eos> She was your moors your solitude.<eos> In a way.<eos> Sir Malcolm's just looking for where he belongs now.<eos> Without Mina.<eos> Without you, even.
She was meant to come home and...<eos> You made her for me.<eos> She is mine.<eos> She is not yours.<eos> She is not his.<eos> She is mine.<eos> I will take her!<eos> And when we are gone, far away from this place to a place for she and me alone,<eos> I will return... Creator.<eos> I will return to you.
Did you catch one?<eos> Come in.<eos> There's a gentleman here for you... from Scotland Yard.<eos> How do you do, Sir Malcolm?<eos> My name is Inspector Bartholomew Rusk, Scotland Yard.<eos> Inspector, to what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> You have a martial sense in decoration, Sir Malcolm.<eos> Apparently, I do.<eos> Please, take a seat.<eos> What can I do for you, Inspector?
Previously on Penny Dreadful...<eos> You let her go out with a man!<eos> - What have you done?<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Did you enjoy your evening?<eos> Never again... will I kneel to any man.<eos> Now they shall kneel to me.<eos> Is it a blessing, the purpose of which we cannot yet see?<eos> I know you, my friend, Ethan Chandler.<eos> What can I do for you, Inspector?
And then he disappeared.<eos> Was he taken?<eos> Mr. Lyle doesn't think so.<eos> And where has he gone?<eos> Into the Witch's castle.<eos> Did you imagine it?<eos> When you came across my emaciated corpse, crawling with the creatures of the earth, flesh eaten hollow. Did you imagine my slow death? Feeling the bugs crawling over my face?<eos> Oh, Peter, my outrage takes pride of place.<eos> Our father left you to die from neglect and his lust for glory... but with me, he actually looked into my eyes and pulled the trigger.<eos> With my arms outstretched, defenseless before you.
Hello, Mr. Clare.<eos> - Why am I here?<eos> - It's your new home.<eos> Albeit a bit on the wee side... but you'll soon have compatriots to ease the boredom.<eos> It's where he belongs.<eos> Animals are right in cages.<eos> There, there, Mrs. Putney.<eos> Have you puzzled it out?<eos> You're to put me on display.<eos> Not just you, pet.
I shall in time.<eos> He's lost his power to entertain me.<eos> When men become mad, they quite lose their dignity.<eos> And without that, well... what are they but throbbing vermin made to procreate and expire?<eos> Come this way.<eos> My sister was always a bit of an embarrassment to me.<eos> Very headstrong, wasn't she?<eos> She could have had the world and all its riches, instead, she chose that grotesque little hovel and her abortionist knives.<eos> Did you enjoy watching her burn?<eos> Not near as much as I enjoyed watching you branded.
I have faced eyes more cruel than yours, woman.<eos> Then face mine.<eos> Face yourself.<eos> There is no more powerful inducement to me than this:<eos> Know yourself.<eos> Like a lamb I was, Victor.<eos> How could you let me be hurt?<eos> Hm.<eos> It was him.<eos> What am I but an extension of you?
Go!<eos> Go!<eos> This monster egg...<eos> Is... mine!<eos> Luogang,<eos> You're robbing me again.<eos> How can we work together?<eos> You lied to me.<eos> Cheater.<eos> Behind you!

All good.<eos> Niuniu, you should come out.<eos> Wait.<eos> Oops, Madam faints again.<eos> What's wrong with you today?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Wow, really?<eos> They are monsters?<eos> Definitely.<eos> If you want, I can capture them for you.
We are doing everything for him.<eos> Are you sure you do not There's nothing I can do ...?<eos> To upload the list donor?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You can not do anything.<eos> If it were me, Christopher would be high on the list.<eos> Unfortunately we have policies in the hospital to follow.<eos> I know.<eos> I get it.<eos> All you can do is see to continue with medication, you are comfortable and you, try to rest.
So many things to do before we head out west.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You can't leave before your present. No,<eos> - I couldn't.<eos> - Shut up and sit down.<eos> You deserve this.<eos> What's gotten into you?<eos> Come on, Richard, open it.<eos> I thought about you long and hard when I made this.
You're booked for this festival.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> That's a point.<eos> Actually, maybe you could help me.<eos> I need a support act for Sunday.<eos> OK. Well, the Barrellers are a good band.<eos> Traditional.<eos> But Frank... Frank always a crowd pleaser.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I was thinking of you.
Did you know Toby Winning?<eos> I do supply sound equipment for the festival venues.<eos> We received a call the day he died.<eos> It was made from a phone box next to that cottage.<eos> So?<eos> So I was wondering if you had any idea who might have made the call.<eos> Look... that cottage was Johnny's.<eos> I only got it after he died.<eos> Got no interest in going near that place.<eos> Does anyone check on it for you, anyone visit it regularly?
Why didn't you contact her when you first arrived here in Lower Crosby?<eos> ~ I was worried about Danny.<eos> ~ And why was that?<eos> I walked out when Melody was three months old.<eos> Maybe he's still angry.<eos> There's no "maybe" about that.<eos> You've been staying up at the old cottage since you arrived?<eos> For the first few days, and then Frank persuaded me to come here.<eos> Did you see anyone at the cottage?<eos> I saw you.
~ Uh, Dr Wilding.<eos> I hate you.<eos> Toby Winning.<eos> Brian Grey.<eos> Frank Wainwright.<eos> All dead.<eos> All of them knew about Johnny's master tape.<eos> So?<eos> Whoever killed them did so to stop Johnny's recording being heard.<eos> And that brings us to you, Danny.
Call--<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll just call Rocky's office.<eos> That's what I'm gonna do.<eos> Henry, I want to go home.<eos> Babe, look at me.<eos> You're gonna be just fine.<eos> Afternoon.<eos> Wyatt called from the service station.<eos> We've got our best available for you.
- What's up, man?<eos> - What are you doing Saturday?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Nothing. Why?<eos> - You wanna make some cash?<eos> Doing what?<eos> Hey, can you play Drunk in Love?<eos> Please?<eos> Yeah, sure, I'll try to work it in.<eos> For you, sir, from James.
Yes? Do you work with pigs?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> And you eat pork?<eos> Very sharp.<eos> - A real killer.<eos> - That's a new one.<eos> Can't devour your colleagues.<eos> I hate judges.<eos> Honestly.<eos> But I like you.
We have to make do. We're looking for training.<eos> Malony thought of doing tattoos, but there aren't many around here.<eos> He could color this crappy thing.<eos> Driver is out until he can get his license.<eos> - That's talkin'.<eos> - What's wrong, Malony?<eos> I wasted 6 months, now I gotta start all over.<eos> The JRF was a waste?<eos> After all we just said?<eos> The efforts, the shrink, staying in line, thinking things over... It's for you, my mother, the counselors...
Like cops who beat you in custody.<eos> They say it's not true and they're believed.<eos> You don't give a shit about us.<eos> You really think that?<eos> Please leave us. I want to speak to Malony off the record.<eos> I'll be outside.<eos> When you're of age, for what you did today, you'd be tried immediately.<eos> And then straight to the penitentiary.<eos> Between us, do you really think the juvenile court here doesn't care?<eos> I don't trust you.
Test!<eos> - Shit!<eos> - Darling... darling!<eos> Even if cellular regeneration is programmed, length of life depends on unforeseeable factors. It's random.<eos> It's impossible for it to be predetermined.<eos> 12 years, 4 months.<eos> And you?<eos> 64 days.<eos> It's not fair!<eos> I've been taking care of you for years, and you'll live longer than me.
They become parents.<eos> Somtimes.<eos> - What became of your mother?<eos> - She died.<eos> Why did she die?<eos> Because she was old.<eos> - What becomes of old people, then?<eos> - They die.<eos> Your music is 'Le rappel des oiseaux' by Rameau.<eos> He says he likes you.

Excuse me ...<eos> I love you.<eos> I've never loved anyone.<eos> I'm married, I don't love my wife.<eos> I don't love my son, either.<eos> I never loved my parents. I've never loved anything, anyhow.<eos> Except you.<eos> I love you and I will always love you.<eos> If you don't love me, it's fine.<eos> I'll go live alone, waiting for death, thinking of you every day.
You have very beautiful eyes, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's your name?<eos> I'm called Philippe.<eos> Oh, yes...<eos> Don't look.<eos> When I see people, I hear their little music.<eos> Everyone has their own little music.<eos> You... have circus music.<eos> He says he likes you.
When we were alone my mother used to look at me.<eos> A funny look. Like I was a box of tacks still lying around after she'd just cleaned house.<eos> Then she said I looked like hell.<eos> - You look like hell.<eos> - And that I should keep calm.<eos> You have to keep calm.<eos> And then she gave me that darned injection.<eos> Deep inside, something told me all was not right with my mother's injections.<eos> Can we increase the dose?<eos> I know it's difficult for you. You're doing all you can.
I know you were trying to save this case, Angela.<eos> Now you might have to save your ass.<eos> When did you first see the gun?<eos> After she pulled the trigger. And you followed her up the stairs even though she was armed?<eos> Maybe I thought I could catch her.<eos> Just an instinct.<eos> Most people's instinct when they see danger is to head in the opposite direction.<eos> One last question.<eos> The waitress standing next to you was hit.<eos> What if that bullet was meant for you?
You are?<eos> So glad, you hit me with a bat?<eos> Next time, ring the fucking doorbell.<eos> Who's this?<eos> My daughter.<eos> _ _<eos> Thanks.<eos> Her mother's idea.<eos> Why don't we skip the formalities here?<eos> I know all about you and your track record on this Lobos case.
The night we had dinner at my house... such a spirited discussion...<eos> I reached out to your landlord the next morning and paid him 10% over market.<eos> All he had to do was agree not to say a word to you.<eos> It was worth it just to see the look on your face right now.<eos> Adorable.<eos> The force majeure clause.<eos> You terminated my lease.<eos> Isn't that what you would do in my shoes?<eos> You've already gotten the space reinspected. The board sign-off will trigger the liquor license.<eos> It's all done thanks to your hard work. I'm ready to reopen Truth with or without you.
Well played, Simon.<eos> Thing is, James, you're actually better than I am.<eos> You're more creative. You're faster.<eos> You're... younger.<eos> But you're not focused.<eos> If you were, I could never have beat you this way.<eos> A man with more ready capital would have walked away, opened a new club.<eos> But you killed yourself to get Truth open again.<eos> It shows me you have too much invested financially and emotionally to walk away now.<eos> Come work for me, James, and I will make you the man you always wanted to be.
Just came to see how poor Annabel was feeling after her dreadful shock.<eos> ~ I'm fine, thank you, Mrs Soane.<eos> ~ Oh, well...<eos> I see everything is in train for tonight. Jolly good.<eos> (Chuckles)<eos> So, tell me what you have planned.<eos> And give away our secrets?<eos> ~ You can trust me, you know that.<eos> ~ Can we?<eos> Of course we trust you, Mrs Soane.
Yes, thank you.<eos> Really, I'm fine.<eos> Good.<eos> Magnus will be up a little later, but I wanted to see you first.<eos> Because this tragedy must make no difference.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> It has to be tonight.<eos> Earth magic and fire magic combined at midsummer.<eos> The power of the wizard harnessed to the service of the goddess!<eos> ~ I know how much this means to you, but...
Annabel begged me not to have anything to do with you and your pathetic cult.<eos> Luke could have died.<eos> ~ Why are you not arresting her?<eos> ~ Because she's not guilty.<eos> All the victims had a link to Mrs Soane and paganism.<eos> But that was just a classic piece of misdirection.<eos> They all had something much more important in common.<eos> They all posed a threat... to Gideon.<eos> I barely knew Hannah, or Andrew Maplin!<eos> But Hannah knew all about you from her husband.
Maybe.<eos> I'm sorry, who are you here to see?<eos> I know I need to apologize, but "I'm sorry" feels a little inadequate.<eos> That baby's got my daughter out to here and it's too late to Dyson it out of her.<eos> So I hope you're here for more than a clean conscience.<eos> I'm a concerned grandmother just like you are.<eos> Although you look nothing like a grandmother.<eos> Hispanic women have amazing skin.<eos> Let's hope the baby gets my complexion.<eos> What's it gettin' from you?
Yes!<eos> Do you think that this is what I want?<eos> To be here in this, um...<eos> In this grocery store?<eos> I'm sorry I sold you the fruit.<eos> And, yes, fine.<eos> I will admit it. I knew it was bad.<eos> I did.<eos> But I wanted my power back, too.<eos> Because I wanted you back.
Door hinge, door hinge, flusher, tap, faucet.<eos> Got this place wired.<eos> After you.<eos> Sure.<eos> So you guys fired the warden.<eos> That was a surprise.<eos> Yeah. Well, we absorbed the position.<eos> Whatever that means.<eos> Like we had soaked him up or something, but, uh...<eos> Good news for you though is, uh, you know, you're our main man on the ground.
It takes forever, you know what I mean?<eos> Just like, everyone wants to be the alpha dog.<eos> This time!<eos> That time! Woof!<eos> But, uh, I'll make the call on it soon.<eos> - You'll make the call?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'll let you know.<eos> Mr. Caputo?<eos> I made these for you.
Pouring rain, nobody seemed to care.<eos> And people just kept wandering around.<eos> They were dancing completely naked, filthy with the mud.<eos> It was, like, unbelievable.<eos> Were you at Woodstock?<eos> Somewhere upstate.<eos> Plus, somebody stole my Johnny Unitas football.<eos> I never wanted to be home so badly.<eos> You guys understand that, right?<eos> Sounds like it was very traumatizing for you.
Hey, lady, that new chapter, che figata!<eos> I really love how Edwina outsmarted the orgasmator.<eos> It's like a shout-out to Barbarella, but still totally new.<eos> Yeah... meant to do that.<eos> She has a beautiful mind.<eos> Yeah, sick as fuck, but beautiful.<eos> Is it really possible to live on nothing but cum?<eos> Only if it's Admiral Rodcocker's cum.<eos> Oh, yeah, you know, and that dude has some extra protein.<eos> It's gonna be a long day for you, Rabbi.
But also not, you know.<eos> I mean, there is some legal gray area, and I love me some gray area.<eos> Yeah, you're one giant gray area.<eos> Acting all chummy, all big brother, but actually, you're... Big Brother.<eos> You are really stuck on this hierarchy stuff, Joe.<eos> Someone must have really done a number on you.<eos> Yeah, she sure did.<eos> You're okay now, buddy.<eos> You're on the MCC team.<eos> I'm gonna be watching out for you.
Yeah.<eos> - No, I guess it does.<eos> - I have to be honest. This whole corporate structure thing, I... I find it confusing.<eos> It's actually really simple.<eos> So, here. You mind if I...<eos> So, you got the... board, right?<eos> And then you got the CEO. You got the CFO. You got the various departments.<eos> We're on the same level.<eos> You don't seem to have to check with me to do anything.<eos> Because it actually flows this way through me... to you.
She's been really dedicated.<eos> Why she wants to go from being a hated minority to a double-hated minority is beyond me, but she's for real.<eos> We've been studying, arguing.<eos> Hey, uh, you wouldn't happen to be related to Aimee Tatelbaum, would you?<eos> She's my cousin.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> We were at Penn together.<eos> Wait, Alan?<eos> Cousin Alan?<eos> I know some things about you.
Oh, my God!<eos> We were at Penn together.<eos> Wait, Alan?<eos> Cousin Alan?<eos> I know some things about you.<eos> Oh, Alan.<eos> You'd better Beit Din this woman before I start to talk.<eos> -Well, Aimee's full of shit.<eos> -Oh, is she?<eos> Like the story about you and the Berkshires with Samantha Gottleib - and the mushrooms, that's bullshit?
Mmm-hmm. Hey.<eos> -Can I be a Jew?<eos> -No.<eos> Can I be a Jew?<eos> No.<eos> Can I be a Jew?<eos> You really want this?<eos> Sincerely?<eos> Not because this one's trying to blackmail me for something stupid when I was 19 or for broccoli with your dinner?<eos> What is this for you?
Are you in on that?<eos> It's not a matter of being in on it or not.<eos> You want employees to show up and do a good job, you... - you gotta take care of them.<eos> - I get it.<eos> I mean, everybody has a right to organize, but if MCC has to start covering benefits, the whole venture's gonna fold.<eos> I mean... it's shortsighted, you know?<eos> We're all gonna be out of work.<eos> Are you being straight with me?<eos> Or is that just union-busting jargon?<eos> I don't know about you, but I like having a job, Joe.
I mean... it's shortsighted, you know?<eos> We're all gonna be out of work.<eos> Are you being straight with me?<eos> Or is that just union-busting jargon?<eos> I don't know about you, but I like having a job, Joe.<eos> I respect that you look out for the underdog.<eos> It seems like you're the kind of guy who does that a lot, but... how's that working out for you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Have you seen my car?<eos> Maybe it's time you stopped worrying about everybody else and did something for you.
You ain't thinking about killing him, are you?<eos> Nah, that shit's too messy.<eos> Nope, I got a better idea.<eos> We are gonna go full-on Girl with the Dragon Tattoo on this guy.<eos> What's us getting tattoos gonna teach him?<eos> No.<eos> See...<eos> Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, it's Swedish.<eos> It means, "We're gonna rape him back."<eos> Whoa, got it all lubed up for you there, Rodcocker.
That and a token will get you on the subway.<eos> That's really great, baby. Really great.<eos> We gotta go now.<eos> Jazmina needs her car back so she could sell the radios out of the trunk.<eos> - I'm gonna miss you.<eos> - I'm gonna miss you, too.<eos> You're not supposed to be in here.<eos> We're not supposed to do a lot of things, but... business is business, right?<eos> Is this about earlier?<eos> Look, this may be weird for you.
Previously on "how to get away with murder"...<eos> Yeah, he's the freak who lived here before you.<eos> Come on. We had fun.<eos> You had fun.<eos> Rebecca goes to trial unless we get the charges against her dismissed.<eos> We have to prove that my husband murdered lila stangard.<eos> Would be a gross miscarriage of justice.<eos> Whatever his wife told you, my brother is no murderer.
You think it's press?<eos> Rubbernecker, more likely.<eos> Do you want me to get rid of her?<eos> No. We can use some fun around here.<eos> What precinct gave you the d.U.I.?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> D.U.I.S are issued With paperwork from the precinct that pulled you over.<eos> You don't have it?<eos> Can we talk alone?<eos> No, because I don't believe you.
Take it easy, Annalise.<eos> It's not like we're the only clients in your book.<eos> Right now you may as well be!<eos> Listen.<eos> Whatever is going on with me is not gonna affect your case.<eos> I guarantee it.<eos> Just like I guarantee you that I will kick the living crap out of the FBI in the courtroom, but only if you trust me.<eos> It's up to you, Paul.<eos> Do you want to fire me?<eos> You do know she lied to you, right?
Heartless.<eos> A sociopath.<eos> Is that about right?<eos> You said you'd protect us.<eos> - Aren't I?<eos> - How could we know?<eos> I mean, you...<eos> You only talk to us in code.<eos> You expect us to continue going to class and work your cases, even though nothing makes any sense anymore.<eos> I want to trust you.
Right.<eos> There was also a fingerprint on the ring.<eos> Do you know who it belongs to?<eos> We're giving you an opportunity to come clean here, Annalise.<eos> I don't need to tell you the benefits of helping us do this the easy way.<eos> Detective, I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Why don't you tell me whose fingerprint it is?<eos> Nate Lahey, you're under arrest for the murder of Sam Keating.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
- Kevin, I'm sorry.<eos> - I need to say goodbye to your family.<eos> - Get out.<eos> Get the fuck out of my family's house.<eos> - How's your mother?<eos> - She's not so great.<eos> She's got tubes coming out of her nose, wheeling a tank like a poodle on a leash.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - She would've liked to have been here.<eos> Wouldn't have been fair to you. She'd be hammered by now, so...
Be sure to check into that.<eos> You never know.<eos> You miss working?<eos> I do a little Pl stuff part-time.<eos> Keeps me busy.<eos> You know, I think I...<eos> I became a policeman because of you.<eos> - You're blowing smoke.<eos> - No, no, no, my...<eos> You know, my dad talked about you a lot.
You want some blow, really?<eos> No, I don't want any fucking blow.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> - What's that have to do--?<eos> - Prick.<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - Fuck off.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> What happened with you and my father?
In addition to testing, it denies that its drug is bad?<eos> We are still investigating this video.<eos> He was fully aware of the truth of that video.<eos> You asked for proof and Chase Carter ... He risked his life to give that test.<eos> And now he prefers to let a lot of innocent people die,<eos> - To admit he was wrong.<eos> - My priority ... It is the security of this country.<eos> We held an outbreak.<eos> This quarantine is successful.<eos> General... Does this seems a success to you.?
You seem to be suggesting I killed Javier for money.<eos> He was my friend, Detective.<eos> You were in love with his wife.<eos> I believe Lola deserved better.<eos> Maybe you killed him because he knocked up your teenage daughter.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Javier was like an uncle to Becca.<eos> Yeah, there was love there, but it wasn't... Oh, come on.<eos> You expect us to believe you didn't know?<eos> Did Javier seem like the uncle type to you?
Lola! Stop!<eos> When I got back from the ATM, there you were, 30 minutes late and practically hyperventilating.<eos> Remember?<eos> I reached up with my napkin to wipe what I thought was red paint from your cheek.<eos> When we found Javier dead, I knew it was you.<eos> And you somehow knew I would cover for you.<eos> You used me.<eos> He was leaving me to start a family with an 18-year-old girl.<eos> CLIVE: Lola Abano, you have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Yeah, you can help me.<eos> You can all help me.<eos> Why don't you step into my office, and I'll tell you a bit about what we do here and we can talk about some of your personal fitness goals?<eos> You can take a seat, if you like.<eos> You don't have to, though.<eos> Fear excuses surrender?<eos> No.<eos> It's...<eos> No fear.<eos> What can we do for you?
I can't believe I haven't earned your trust by now.<eos> So.<eos> Well, listen... this is an intro session, and it's really just about me getting to know you and you getting to know me - and sort of starting on a plan together.<eos> - All right.<eos> So, what I'd like you to do is... keep a food log.<eos> That means, you know, writing it down on a piece of paper, e-mailing it to me, or now some of my clients, they'll take a picture of the food they're eating and send it to me.<eos> So, anything that goes into your body that isn't water, we track it.<eos> - That's intense.<eos> Payment... you could either pay by...<eos> We usually bill monthly, but we can schedule it however works for you.
Keep the change.<eos> Let's talk about food.<eos> I think that it's really great that you were honest about what you ate.<eos> But... if it wasn't hunger, what do you think was going on there?<eos> - Boredom.<eos> - Boredom, okay.<eos> Well, maybe you could've invited somebody over to share the pizza with you.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Yeah, maybe or maybe not.<eos> It's up to you, right?
It will die. Just like some ugly fat man who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day.<eos> I mean, it's okay, but I do not call it perfect.<eos> No. No, you know what? I think the only time I heard you say the word "perfect"<eos> was that one time that you called that guy...<eos> What was his name, that CrossFit guy?<eos> You called him the perfect asshole.<eos> Well, sometimes, I'm not so clear as I need to be.<eos> - No, I know exactly what you meant.<eos> - Yeah, I think you're perfectly clear.<eos> And... you know, hearing it from you, hearing this stuff from you, it's really inspiring.
First day of the month!<eos> Pay up!<eos> Make your payments!<eos> Pay up!<eos> Pay your respects to Sir Horsa.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Please, sir.<eos> Here's your blood money.<eos> And much good may it do you.
What?<eos> No.<eos> Please, sir.<eos> Here's your blood money.<eos> And much good may it do you.<eos> - Watch your mouth!<eos> Pay up!<eos> Come on, pay up!<eos> Coins.<eos> What good will a few coins from a poor man do you?
Come on.<eos> The code.<eos> When Drago regained his form, could that have been your doing?<eos> Me?<eos> How?<eos> Well, you upheld the code.<eos> You came back.<eos> And to my recollection that was the precise moment Drago appeared.<eos> You share feelings, pain.<eos> Perhaps he can feel the valor in you too.
It's not so long.<eos> Can I get a hug?<eos> What do I have to do to get a hug?<eos> Mom, Elliot has eaten something!<eos> - What did he eat?<eos> - Mom!<eos> How many did you eat?<eos> Elliot. Open your mouth.<eos> Is this Elliot?<eos> The doctor is ready for you in room six.
"Your children live in safety though."<eos> He says that if they go back, they will be killed.<eos> "Take care of the children, and I'll leave."<eos> His children will be killed.<eos> We have to go to the village in the morning anyway...<eos> Stop that right now.<eos> "What should I do?"<eos> We will be there tomorrow.<eos> We'll secure the area, and force the Taliban out.<eos> We'll protect you and your family.
Okay good.<eos> In this court, we have heard the sound from a video clip, in which you pass on orders from the defendant to bomb Compound 6.<eos> At the time, did you know the reason for that order?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> It was me who told Claus, that I could see muzzle flashes from Compound 6.<eos> Will the audience please refrain from commenting?<eos> Could you repeat that?<eos> I told Claus that I saw muzzle flashes coming from Compound 6.<eos> This is completely new to me.<eos> How is it possible for you to provide that information to the defendant from your location behind the wall?
May I just point out to the court, that testimony is not signed.<eos> - Is that true?<eos> - That is correct.<eos> It is exhibit 23.<eos> There is nothing odious about it not being signed.<eos> The witness was on his way to patrol, when he testified.<eos> It was written on a laptop in the camp and it was read through on the screen.<eos> I was just pointing it out.<eos> - It has been noted.<eos> - But back to you, Kenneth.
Jerusalem and a tiny one on Beer Sheva.<eos> 100,000 dead, half a million wounded.<eos> Diseases, global mess.<eos> Won't look good.<eos> -Timetable<eos> -It'll take him 8-10 days to get ready.<eos> 8 days?<eos> Why didn't you tell me that earlier?<eos> How did you let this primitive grow so big and pose a threat to our country?<eos> He doesn't give a damn about you, Sir.
Whats your name?<eos> Open the door.<eos> Why the door is locked?<eos> I must go.<eos> Spike commander, do you hear me?<eos> Over, spike commander.<eos> Am about to go to sleep.<eos> Over, remember I am here with 200 nails, all starving.<eos> Datum Point 691731252996<eos> Over, spike commander, on the way to you.
Yes, come to Oranienburger Strasse in Berlin, and you will get potatoes, meat and gravy.<eos> The best. Yes, the best.<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> Go.<eos> Sit down.<eos> What do you want?<eos> We need more experienced people at Skallingen.<eos> Yes, but I need them at Ringkobing.<eos> Yes, please.<eos> It's not you, I'm talking about.
Afternoon, Deputy.<eos> Can I get you something?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Have you seen the sheriff?<eos> - He missed his shift today. - No.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> But he'll turn up.<eos> He always does.<eos> You know him pretty well, huh?<eos> I could say the same about you.
Make sure the safety is off, one goes into the chamber and just point, squeeze.<eos> Repeat as necessary. Hood, the basement.<eos> - What about it?<eos> - The exterior doors don't have gates on them.<eos> - Bunker, through the range down the stairs.<eos> - I'm on it. Sir. - Alison, with him...<eos> - I'm not going anywhere with that guy. With all due respect, ma'am, I understand my physical - appearance may be alarming...<eos> - Save it.<eos> I've known men like you.<eos> - I know everything about you.
Oh, I see, sir.<eos> Um... how am I supposed to help you with this Sam Adams problem?<eos> Well, I need you to take care of him.<eos> You need me to take care of him.<eos> Sir, why don't you just arrest him?<eos> Mr. Hancock, I've been quite kind to your family's enterprises, especially in terms of lax enforcement of certain customs duties.<eos> Wait... with all due respect, sir, we pay handsomely for those privileges.<eos> That, you do.<eos> I merely wish to make the point that if tensions in the colony continue to escalate, it won't be good for me.<eos> And what's not good for me is not good for you and is certainly not good for business.
I don't know what you're doing here. Well...<eos> Could we talk in private?<eos> Would you mind?<eos> Stretch your legs, lads.<eos> Oh, no, there's really no need to clear the establishment.<eos> I... thank you very much.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you, my good man.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Adams.<eos> I say, it was quite the show you put on the other night with all of those men all following you.
_<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Lord North, I have an urgent letter from the Colonies.<eos> Get me Benjamin Franklin.<eos> Come in.<eos> Oh, heavens.<eos> Is there a problem, Mrs. Stevenson?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Not at all, Dr. Franklin.<eos> What can I do for you, Mrs. Stevenson?
You are playing a very dangerous game.<eos> You are headed down a road that you will not be able to come back from.<eos> I strongly advised you not to do this.<eos> Your advice was respectfully noted.<eos> Everything needs to calm down here, Mr. Adams.<eos> All of this violence and unrest... it is bad for business.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Let's just get the business up and running again.<eos> Then we can get the cargo flowing, and we can get back to making a profit.<eos> It's all money for you.
Good.<eos> Regiment, halt! Turn!<eos> Present arms!<eos> - General Gage.<eos> - Shoulder arms!<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I'm Governor... Men!<eos> At ease.<eos> I'm Governor Thomas Hutchinson.<eos> I've heard much about you.
Regiment, halt! Turn!<eos> Present arms!<eos> - General Gage.<eos> - Shoulder arms!<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I'm Governor... Men!<eos> At ease.<eos> I'm Governor Thomas Hutchinson.<eos> I've heard much about you.<eos> And I you.
Didn't mean to startle you.<eos> You didn't.<eos> I was just out for a ride, and my horse threw a shoe.<eos> My name is Joseph Warren.<eos> We met briefly the other day.<eos> Yes, I remember.<eos> How is he?<eos> The man from the square.<eos> Oh, he'll be all right.<eos> At the very least he'll survive, thanks to you.
General Gage, perhaps we could come... okay, take your ha... unhand me.<eos> Gentlemen, unhand me.<eos> Do not... this is outrageous.<eos> General...<eos> The king thanks you for your service.<eos> Good evening, gentlemen.<eos> Mr. Adams.<eos> Mr. Adams,<eos> I am in. Whatever you want, whatever you need...<eos> I am with you.
Mr. Adams.<eos> Mr. Adams,<eos> I am in. Whatever you want, whatever you need...<eos> I am with you.<eos> And why should we trust you? How do we know you're not working for Gage now?<eos> I resent that.<eos> Why the sudden change of heart?<eos> He took my house.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> Look at you, still only out for yourself.
I'm sure the good doctor has a remedy.<eos> Yes, I have a tonic that might help.<eos> Aren't I the lucky one.<eos> Just a few drops.<eos> Tell me, do you have a wife at home?<eos> She died three years ago.<eos> I'm sorry to hear of your suffering, but a handsome, educated man such as yourself must never be lonely.<eos> I have my work.<eos> Ah, well, doctor, you and I aren't so different.<eos> Mrs. Gage, is there anything I can do for you?
- Previously on sons of liberty...<eos> - Taking your ship, you loyalist bastard.<eos> - All of this violence and unrest, It is bad for business.<eos> - It's all money for you.
If it wasn't for sam adams and his thuggish friends, We wouldn't be in this position.<eos> We would be living our lives, Content... And british.<eos> You, sir, Have escalated this situation. You and your band of rebels.<eos> - You weren't there.<eos> None of you! None of you have seen What has been happening in boston.<eos> Good men have lost their lives, And you are sitting here and arguing And look for someone to blame.<eos> Well, here I am!<eos> I am here. I'm here to work with you.<eos> I am here to work with you towards a solution.<eos> - To a problem you created.
- I'm sorry, mr. Adams, but that's just a bridge too far.<eos> - I understand your trepidation, But a vote from you--<eos> - That's treason.<eos> - Is there something funny, mr.<eos> - You still think you have a choice, Do you, mr. Rutledge?<eos> They will take your possessions.<eos> They will rip you from your home.<eos> And they'll kill you.<eos> Sure as I'm standing here right now.<eos> I would think about it, if I were you.
- So we have most of the room.<eos> Just a few holdouts.<eos> - Yes, we're close.<eos> Very close.<eos> - It's time to write it down.<eos> A document, A declaration of our independence.<eos> - The writer should be someone from outside the boston circle.<eos> - A southerner. They're the ones holding us back.<eos> Someone young, someone likeable.<eos> - Exact opposite of you.

~ Mr Grove, how nice to see you.<eos> How's your leg?<eos> I heard you were injured in France.<eos> Entirely healed, thank you.<eos> I was fortunate.<eos> Unlike so many others.<eos> I was sorry to hear about Florian.<eos> Thank you for your letter.<eos> It was very kind.<eos> I had been hoping to hear from you regarding your situation.
Thank you for your letter.<eos> It was very kind.<eos> I had been hoping to hear from you regarding your situation.<eos> Your leave of absence is about to end.<eos> Yes. Could we discuss that another time?<eos> I'm here to see Miss Towler.<eos> ~ Yes, of course.<eos> ~ Thank you.<eos> Miss Mardle, I thought we were meeting at the church.<eos> This came for you, from France.
Miss Mardle, I thought we were meeting at the church.<eos> This came for you, from France.<eos> France?<eos> 'Henri is on his way to London.<eos> Discharged from hospital...'<eos> Why's he been in hospital?<eos> ~ Do you like it?<eos> ~ I adore it.<eos> And the person in it.<eos> I know today's going to be hard for you, without Ma beside you.
But... with Rosalie getting married and friends like you back amongst us, well, things can only get better. (CHUCKLES)<eos> It's great to have you back, and if there's anything I can do...<eos> Mr Leclair!<eos> Mr Leclair!<eos> ~ Oh, Mr Crabb.<eos> ~ How splendid to see you.<eos> (LAUGHTER)<eos> Oh, what a show you've put on, sir!<eos> It really is very generous of you.<eos> Family means the world to me, as I'm sure it does to you.
Because it's all about survival now.<eos> At any cost.<eos> People out there are always looking for an angle.<eos> Looking to play on your weakness.<eos> They measure you by what they can take from you.<eos> By how they can use you to live.<eos> So bringing people into a place like this now...<eos> Are you telling me not to bring your people in?<eos> Are you alreay looking after this place?<eos> Aaron says I can trust you.
You want to en up on your ass again?<eos> - Aien: Cool, all right?<eos> - Rick: aryl.<eos> I want everyone to hear me, okay?<eos> Rick an his people are part of this community now in all ways as equals.<eos> Unerstoo?<eos> Unerstoo.<eos> All of you, turn in your weapons.<eos> Then you two come talk to me.<eos> I tol you I ha a job for you.
Come on in.<eos> I don't know about this.<eos> They have beer.<eos> I'm gonna try.<eos> You're Rick.<eos> Rick, this is my husband Reg.<eos> You're a pretty remarkable guy.<eos> Well, how's that?<eos> I watched the tapes, all of them.<eos> The things those people said about you.
Letting him go makes this place vulnerable.<eos> You really want to wait till someone in that tower has to take care of it?<eos> - And that's if we're lucky.<eos> - We are not... executing anyone.<eos> Don't ever suggest it again.<eos> That sort of thinking doesn't belong in here.<eos> People die now, Deanna.<eos> They do.<eos> There's times like this you can decide who and when.<eos> Or it can be decided for you.
We can cut up these seats.<eos> What the hell are you oing?<eos> You nee to check on Tara.<eos> You treate her.<eos> You're a surgeon. You nee to o that.<eos> Get out.<eos> I coul kill you right now.<eos> I coul.<eos> I will.<eos> An then who woul believe I i it because I in't like you?
It was him, I swear.<eos> It was the lawyer.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> Why are you after me?<eos> - I can explain.<eos> You're gonna laugh, it's so...<eos> I'm a lawyer. Check my ID, okay?<eos> - I was running a scam...<eos> - On my abuelita? !<eos> Not on your abuelita. Not on you.
We could go that way, but we were talking about breaking.<eos> - We're heading in the wrong direction.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Break their legs.<eos> - How many legs?<eos> - Two. They got two legs.<eos> - One leg each.<eos> One leg each?<eos> One leg each. Total of two legs.<eos> Hey, look, they can't skateboard for six months and they're scared of you forever.
For you, a customer. Waiting now.<eos> Sure, sure. Give me a minute.<eos> Welcome, welcome.<eos> My office is being painted.<eos> Excuse the temporary quarters.<eos> Cosy.<eos> Just me.<eos> Tuco freaked you out, huh?<eos> It's cool. He doesn't know I'm here.<eos> So what can I do for you?
Easy. Easy.<eos> - It's his lawyer.<eos> - Whose lawyer?<eos> You sure he asked for me?<eos> Going in or what?<eos> Hey.<eos> You asked for me and I have come.<eos> I want to tell you, this was a wise move.<eos> Very smart, because I'm here to help.<eos> Everyone, all parties, but mostly you.
Here's what I understand, counsellor.<eos> I told my plan to one other person.<eos> One.<eos> You.<eos> Now here I am under arrest.<eos> Go figure.<eos> I don't know anything about a setup or another crew.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't even care.<eos> The cops are out there now poking into my business and if they find something on me or my partners, for real it's gonna be bad for you.
We're just gonna go.<eos> - Let's go dance.<eos> Come on, let's go to the bar. - Who the fuck are you?<eos> It's just a fucking haircut.<eos> Keep telling yourself that. Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> See you, Kev.<eos> Mandy, you sweet, sweet girl.<eos> That's still a sin of the flesh.<eos> But God wants my mouth on you.
Oh, that is not sleep... it's passing out.<eos> And you don't get to nag me anymore. You left.<eos> Yeah, 'cause I got tired of nagging.<eos> Heads up for old times' sake... there are inconsistencies in your officer-involved shooting.<eos> How?<eos> It's simple... a very bad man shot Gravely, then he shot me, then I shot him.<eos> The shooting board said I'm a hero.<eos> Cops investigating cops and making them heroes is why chief Cervantes formed civilian oversight.<eos> God, it really is good to see you.<eos> She likes you.
Mr. Cropper, I'm Detective Nicole Gravely.<eos> We need to ask you a couple of questions.<eos> We compared footage of everyone who came and went in the 24 hours before and after Emma's death to the security guard's log book.<eos> Henry doesn't use logs.<eos> He's a level four... perfect recall.<eos> Even a level four needs a cheat sheet.<eos> He writes the initials V.C. at the exact times you came and went.<eos> "V.C., 12:07 a.m."<eos> Ooh, that looks bad.<eos> Looks even worse for you.
Death is not to be feared. It's just a doorway to another room.<eos> But who amongst us isn't sad... when a loved one leaves the room?<eos> I am...<eos> The center.<eos> Lieutenant Backstrom...<eos> I'm sure you can understand that this is our private way to mourn the loss of Emma Germain.<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> I get it.<eos> My condolences.<eos> I got nothing against you or your church.
God, can you imagine having to process the violent death of your own child?<eos> "A," "process" is an unnecessary word, like "hydrate."<eos> "B," if she's such a great mother, why did her daughter run away to join a cult?<eos> I'll have someone take you to the morgue.<eos> She hadn't seen her daughter in over five years, but she says that Emma was calling her regularly the last few weeks, hanging up and not saying anything.<eos> If she wasn't saying anything, how does she know it was her daughter?<eos> She's a mother. She knows.<eos> Oh, mystic mother power, huh?<eos> What say the three of us put our heads together for a minute or two?<eos> Right behind you, chief.
How old was Emma Germain six years ago?<eos> You can't get someone one way, you sidle around and you get them another.<eos> Tactics, Gravely, from the Backstrom playbook.<eos> Statutory rape.<eos> What is the cruelest possible way that we can do this?<eos> I am the center.<eos> There's a reason for these banners, and there's a reason why all of our tenets...<eos> Portland Police.<eos> You are under arrest for statutory rape.<eos> You have the right to remain silent. Everything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Me.<eos> I shot me...<eos> Before I shot him... it was an accident.<eos> You need to get some sleep.<eos> Here's your prescription.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Detective Backstrom... we are more than meat.<eos> We are spiritual creatures who need something larger than ourselves to believe in...<eos> God, love, art.<eos> All your difficulties spring from denying the fact that part of you is divine, the part of you that connects all of us.
- Thanks.<eos> - ...for questions like that. - I'm up for this.<eos> There's an interesting recurring theme to the stories you cover.<eos> - People abusing their power.<eos> - I don't like bullies.<eos> Tell me about your work.<eos> You wanna know if I'm responsible for what happened.<eos> - Aren't you?<eos> - Look, I did my job. Believe me.<eos> I don't have to believe you.

I saw it.<eos> I saw it with my own two eyes.<eos> Those parts of Bush's file they didn't like...<eos> - ...they tossed in the wastebasket.<eos> - Do you have these?<eos> Bill tried to talk about this in 2000, someone ran us off the road one night.<eos> - I ain't scared of them.<eos> - Well, I am. I am scared.<eos> All right, let's say I have the documents.<eos> Why should I show them to you?
You guys feel like pizza?<eos> I really feel like we should start thinking about pizza.<eos> Hello?<eos> - General Hodges?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This is Mary Mapes with 60 Minutes.<eos> I'd like to speak with you about some old memos...<eos> I've come across from the 187th Fighter Interceptor Squadron.<eos> They appear to be... from the personal files of Jerry Killian.<eos> Well, I'd like to read them to you, if that's okay?
Okay. "Staudt has obviously pressured Hodges more about Bush.<eos> I'm having trouble running interference and doing my job.<eos> Harris gave me a message today from Group regarding Bush's OETR... and Staudt is pushing to sugarcoat it.<eos> Bush wasn't here during rating period... and I don't have any feedback from 187th in Alabama.<eos> I will not rate.<eos> Austin is not happy today either.<eos> Harris took the call from Group today.<eos> I'll backdate but won't rate.<eos> Harris agrees."<eos> Sir, are these memos familiar to you?
With Burkett, there needs to be a line of questioning about his motives.<eos> His political leanings, his views on the president, why he lied.<eos> People will cover how we cover this.<eos> We need to inoculate ourselves.<eos> Thou shalt always protect the company.<eos> I want Dan to survive this.<eos> Why wouldn't he survive this?<eos> If Dan feels like this is corporate positioning, he won't do it.<eos> He won't for me.<eos> He will for you.
Excuse me.<eos> How's Bill?<eos> Oh, don't you dare ask how Bill is.<eos> Bill is sick.<eos> He's a sick man.<eos> You don't give a damn about him.<eos> You just spent two hours trying to destroy him.<eos> You made him crawl on camera.<eos> You made him say again and again that he lied.<eos> And that still wasn't enough for you.
You don't give a damn about him.<eos> You just spent two hours trying to destroy him.<eos> You made him crawl on camera.<eos> You made him say again and again that he lied.<eos> And that still wasn't enough for you.<eos> You wanted more.<eos> You wanted to blame him for all the things you did wrong... putting this story together.<eos> You wanna wrap it in a neat package, say "It's Bill Burkett's fault."<eos> Well, it's not, and you know it.<eos> You promised when we came here to do this... that we would get a fair shake, and we got nothing from you but lies.
Because that's what people do these days if they don't like a story.<eos> They point and scream.<eos> They question your politics, your objectivity.<eos> Hell... your basic humanity.<eos> And they hope to God the truth gets lost in the scrum.<eos> And when it is finally over... and they have kicked and shouted so loud... we can't even remember what the point was....<eos> But you didn't prove it.<eos> You didn't prove Ben Barnes got the president into the Guard.<eos> You didn't prove the memos are real.<eos> The burden of proof is on you.
Would you really just have walked away?<eos> If that's what you want.<eos> What if it isn't?<eos> Then we leave together.<eos> You want me to get that?<eos> I just wanted to say good-bye.<eos> Thank you for showing such compassion for my mother...<eos> Emily.<eos> I should have been there to say good-bye.<eos> The morphine was affecting her speech, but I do know that in her final moments she was thinking of you.
We open up in two hours. Come on.<eos> Put some polish on those poles.<eos> I want them to shine.<eos> She can polish my pole.<eos> Is there a problem over here?<eos> - No, ma'am.<eos> - There are two cases of vodka out back.<eos> - Bring them to the bar.<eos> - You know, I would, but<eos> I don't work for you.
Please, have a seat.<eos> - Where is Mr. Proctor?<eos> - Tending to other business.<eos> I'll be speaking on his behalf.<eos> We're accustomed to dealing direct with your boss.<eos> And we're accustomed to dealing directly with your boss,<eos> Mr. Frazier.<eos> But seeing as you drove all the way from Philadelphia,<eos> I'm willing to make an exception.<eos> How about you?
Sure.<eos> What is it?<eos> I have a problem.<eos> Do you think you should talk to Gwen, or my mom?<eos> No, it's not really about work.<eos> It's for me.<eos> Well, for my cousin Carlos.<eos> You remember him?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> He liked you.
That man owed me money, and I was drinking, and I was drunk.<eos> And I lost my temper.<eos> I did this, but I didn't hurt anyone.<eos> It wasn't me, it was the drinking and I've stopped.<eos> Yeah, he goes to meetings every day now.<eos> That's good. That's an important step.<eos> I could show proof of the meetings. I can take a test, blood, whatever.<eos> Did you tell the public defender?<eos> - He doesn't listen. He doesn't care.<eos> - That's why we need you.
- Got a new boat.<eos> - Nice.<eos> Thought I wasn't supposed to be talking to you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm looking for Cristina Colon?<eos> I'm Cristina.<eos> We spoke on the phone.<eos> I'm Detective Rayburn.<eos> You're a detective?<eos> I don't remember you.
That is the term I'm looking for.<eos> You are a dirty double mother suckler.<eos> Now that we have the terminology straightened out how dare you?<eos> Not in a rush.<eos> We'll set a date when the time's right.<eos> It doesn't matter, sweetie.<eos> The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord.<eos> Ugh.<eos> "Ugh"?<eos> The Bible is "ugh" to you?
- Looks good.<eos> Look at that, you cleaned it up all by yourself.<eos> Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself.<eos> Honestly, I don't know why you complain...<eos> Okay, maybe I missed one spot.<eos> Just leave.<eos> I'm so glad you and I were able to bury the hatchet.<eos> Me too.<eos> And I respect your right to your beliefs.<eos> And I will pray for you.
I will stay with him through the night.<eos> You'll need your strength, come.<eos> I will send for you, should he awaken, or there be any need.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt your prayers.<eos> I wasn't exactly praying, I was...<eos> Just sitting here alone, trying to clear my head.<eos> Were you indeed alone?<eos> Please.<eos> Would you like me to hear your confession?<eos> I'm not sure any of it would make any sense to you.
Always.<eos> The laudanum, please. No.<eos> I want to be awake when you cut him out of me.<eos> And get on with it.<eos> I'll miss you, mistress.<eos> We shall never find another healer the likes of you.<eos> Thank you, Willie.<eos> You're a true friend.<eos> I doubt everyone is as sad as you are to see us go.<eos> Well, it's nothing personal, mistress, but keeping you and Jamie out of harm's way proves to be a full-time occupation. That's very true.
- Yeah, I know.<eos> The things people do, huh?<eos> They decide to go camping right after I run my little offer by you?<eos> Could be argued that all of life is one great coincidence.<eos> Somebody told those people to go camping.<eos> Somebody warned them.<eos> They're very woodsy.<eos> And between you and me they're rash when it comes to the decision-making.<eos> They're not really the plan-ahead types.<eos> Yeah, I'd cut the cute attitude right about now if I were you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Martin is not picking up.<eos> Please wait in the lobby.<eos> I'll keep trying.<eos> Thank you.<eos> God bless you.<eos> God owes me nothing.<eos> You sisters have paid for everything.<eos> It's just what people say.<eos> Here you are, sister, one with just mustard.<eos> For you, sister, one ketchup and mayo?
No, I look like a young Paul Newman dressed as Matlock.<eos> Where's my guy?<eos> - Say hello to Barney Fife.<eos> - Wrong show, but thanks for playing.<eos> So, what happened?<eos> Mayor didn't give you enough stickers?<eos> You wanna tell me what we're doing here?<eos> Oh, here's your coffee.<eos> Hope it's good to the last drop because I'm billing you the full hour for it.<eos> That's for you.
Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice...?<eos> No, I'm fine...<eos> I just want you all to myself.<eos> I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen, First of His Name.<eos> King Tommen...<eos> it still sounds strange to me.<eos> Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.<eos> - That's Moat Cailin.<eos> - Yes.<eos> A bit shabby, isn't it?<eos> You've been here before.<eos> On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and...<eos> - Where are you taking me?<eos> - Home.<eos> The Boltons have Winterfell.<eos> The marriage proposal... It wasn't for you?
He kept his house in power through sheer will.<eos> Without him,<eos> Jaime has one hand and no allies,<eos> Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.<eos> The Queen will be enraged.<eos> Queen Margaery adores Sansa.<eos> Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.<eos> And yet she still has friends.<eos> men in important places, whom she can ask for favours.<eos> A message for you, from Cersei Lannister.
Silent sisters raped.<eos> Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.<eos> Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods.<eos> Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own.<eos> In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.<eos> Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago.<eos> If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you find worthy.<eos> An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.<eos> An army and service to the Gods themselves.<eos> And to you, of course.
Come.<eos> Let me show what you're fighting for.<eos> You're gonna show me some vision in the fire.<eos> Forgive me, my Lady.<eos> But I don't trust in visions.<eos> No visions.<eos> No magic.<eos> Just life.<eos> Do you feel my heart beating?<eos> This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake.
- He was going for his gun.<eos> - I was going for my badge.<eos> Oh, why won't you shut up, freak?<eos> Don't touch me unless you love me, all right?<eos> Hey, lieu, can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> That shafe kid...<eos> You volunteering to give him the buzz cut?<eos> No.<eos> So wait.<eos> I report to you?
Previously on Aquarius...<eos> - I'm Charlie Manson.<eos> - How do you know my name?<eos> My daughter, Emma, she's gone.<eos> If you can keep it quiet, there are people who'd appreciate it.<eos> Get my little girl back. What, are you afraid of the cops?<eos> Relax.<eos> I want him, not you.
May we speak with you? Uh, in a second, guys.<eos> We're just in the middle of...<eos> We know what you're doing, Officer, and it's now over.<eos> Go inside, baby.<eos> We're investigating a murder here.<eos> Ma'am...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Couldn't have been easy for a woman like that to age, married to a younger guy.<eos> Thing is, Leo, you never called the cops.<eos> The only calls to the police involving you and your wife - were from your neighbors... - No...
Walk with me.<eos> My lawyer.<eos> What, you don't shake hands?<eos> Hey, ow, ow, ow. You and me, we're gonna sit in your front window, and I'm gonna meet all your customers.<eos> - You can't do that.<eos> - I can't? I did it all the time when I did Narco.<eos> I watched guys like you just dry up and blow away.<eos> What do you want?<eos> First, you two walk back whatever you said about me to whoever you said it to.<eos> Next, the guy above you, the guy above him, the guy above that.
But I also don't want another open homicide on my desk.<eos> I will give you my word of honor that you will never see the inside of a jail or a court.<eos> - Can I talk to you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Outside.<eos> - No.<eos> Outside, just a second.<eos> Leo, you know how much you hate the coloreds?<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Well, not half as much as they hate you.
No, you promised.<eos> And wives can be a lot of things, but we don't get to beat them to death. Come on.<eos> - I'm gonna tell. - Where is that thing?<eos> All right?<eos> I'm gonna tell.<eos> I'm gonna tell my lawyers what you did.<eos> Yeah, you do that.<eos> You take it all the way to the Supreme Court.<eos> Speaking of which, you have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can be used against you in court.
- The guy had rights!<eos> - Not today.<eos> - Back up.<eos> - What?<eos> Back up.<eos> You think all you did was lean on a perp?<eos> When you haul in an innocent man... Bunchy?<eos> On some trumped-up obstruction beef you know he had nothing to do with...<eos> Child, he didn't know that.<eos> He's just a dumb spade to you, right?
Jamie?<eos> Jamie!<eos> Does anyone know where I would find Jamie Fraser?<eos> Not in here.<eos> Try down below.<eos> That's where they keep those of us that hanging's too good for.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> I won't surrender.<eos> To you or any man.
Yes.<eos> Can you feel that?<eos> No.<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> Can you feel that?<eos> It's all right.<eos> I could take you right now.<eos> No.<eos> I will not give in to coarse passion.<eos> If you'd only stop resisting me I could make this so much easier for you.
Take her away.<eos> No. No, no!<eos> No, let me say goodbye!<eos> I can't leave you.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> Do as I say.<eos> I love you, mo nighean donn.<eos> I shall return shortly.<eos> Walk.<eos> I recently heard an extraordinary rumor about you.
Scott.<eos> So, after work on Friday,<eos> Matt's like, "come on out and get a beer."<eos> And getting beers on Friday, that's, uh... that's what me and him did<eos> Friday before that, Friday before that.<eos> So I figured, "what's - what's the big deal?"<eos> You know, one Friday we don't go for beers.<eos> And then I come in work Monday morning, and I find out he's dead, and... and Gwen's...<eos> I'm sorry as hell, Mr. Skokie.<eos> You know, you should know he was all about you.
You know what?<eos> We recovered a large quantity<eos> - of crystallized...<eos> Various charges you're facing in the county...<eos> Transporting stolen property, accessory after the fact...<eos> They're being set aside.<eos> So, what does that mean?<eos> I get to walk?<eos> Local charges are secondary.<eos> A warrant's come up for you.
- That's not true.<eos> - They're blaming my son.<eos> They're trying to blame my son.<eos> I'm...<eos> - I'm tired.<eos> I'm... I'm tired.<eos> You... you need to know what's ahead of you.<eos> It's gonna be slow, long.<eos> Might be a year, maybe even more than a year before the case even goes to trial.<eos> The other side will do anything, say anything about your son, you, your family to walk away from what they did.
Reverend Laurence's grandson is going to get the lute-playing angel because he was in the choir.<eos> Very sharp, Mr. McGill.<eos> And here I thought all lawyers were idiots.<eos> No, only half of us are idiots.<eos> The other half are crooks.<eos> - Aren't you a spicy one.<eos> - Well...<eos> If I were 40 years younger, I'd have you buy me a piña colada.<eos> Well, if you want me to draw up a DNR I'll bring a blender and some pineapple.<eos> I knew I'd like you when I saw how you saved that poor man on the television.
What do we do now?<eos> I think I just hand this to him to sign.<eos> Holy fuck.<eos> ♪ those were our times ♪<eos> I'm looking for Diamond Appreciations.<eos> Clearly, I'm in the wrong place.<eos> Maybe there's an office upstairs or-- or--<eos> Frank.<eos> Buddy?<eos> Now I understand this was personal for you.
It's no big deal.<eos> Brave boy.<eos> I'm Buddy Diamond.<eos> I founded this organization.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Your name is Diamond?<eos> Come this way.<eos> Fuck.<eos> As you know, most insurance plans have a cap on what they'll pay for prosthetic limbs.<eos> But thanks to you, these homeless children will live normal lives, play in the school yard, ride bikes, run for the sheer joy of it.
- No, it was her. I saw her.<eos> She left, Arthur, and she's not coming back.<eos> It's just you and me now, son, and I'm not going anywhere.<eos> These photos of Arthur Curry are proof positive - of everything I've been working towards.<eos> - I'm very pleased for you, doctor.<eos> The world will have to believe me now.<eos> They'll know what I know.<eos> - Call me after you've made contact. - I will.<eos> Congratulations, David.<eos> I could not have found him without you.
I think I'd better tell you now.<eos> Cashier's check?<eos> It's a nice touch, but I think you should put me on retainer.<eos> Tommy's out free and clear, till they catch him reoffending.<eos> But the feds, they still want to nail Lobos, which means you're still vulnerable to charges.<eos> And your girlfriend, the prosecutor...<eos> - Angela.<eos> We blew her up in court.<eos> I doubt she's gonna have that job much longer.<eos> And if I were her, I'd want to nail you on my way out the door.
Name you as a witness at least, but probably as a defendant.<eos> Angela wouldn't do that.<eos> I've considered all the angles.<eos> I'm going legit. Trust me, I'm good.<eos> You're right. You are good. But you don't have eyes in the back of your head.<eos> You want out?<eos> You want to walk away? Clean?<eos> You've got to cut ties with everybody who knows who you are.<eos> Including you?<eos> If I need you, I'll call you. But don't wait up. I've got everything under control.
Oh, let me guess. You bought Truth back from her.<eos> And Verbatim and Syrup.<eos> See, I think it's time for me to expand.<eos> - Take care of yourself, James.<eos> - You, too.<eos> It was a pleasure doing business with you both.<eos> This isn't over, James.<eos> Yes, Simon, it is.<eos> But you were right about one thing.<eos> Because of you, I'm now exactly the man I always wanted to be.
Looks like she needs a little help.<eos> I'm gonna make sure she finds it.<eos> Yeah, she's a little retarded.<eos> You're fucking with the wrong motherfucker, man.<eos> You have an important call.<eos> Who the fuck is this?<eos> Thomas?<eos> How is the girl, hmm?<eos> A-and the dog?<eos> Look, jefe, I didn't say shit about you to any-fucking-body.
Suit yerself then.<eos> Stuffed cabbage, Claire?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> - We're right pleased to have you back, my laird.<eos> We hope you both bide at home for a good long while now.<eos> As do we, Robert. Thank you.<eos> I brought this small gift for you, mi'lady.<eos> Oh, how lovely, thank you.<eos> It looks delicious.<eos> I brought these for you, mi'lady.
- He shot himself in the heart.<eos> It's easier to do that with your right hand than your left.<eos> We photographed the entire room, over 400 pictures.<eos> I want copies.<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> Why weren't you and your father close?<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> Because the usual reaction I see when someone's parent is killed is different than yours.<eos> - You've seen a lot of that?<eos> My heart weeps for you.
You say you'll help everyone?<eos> I will.<eos> Well, then, prove it.<eos> And how do you suggest I do that?<eos> You're wasting doses here on healthy people.<eos> Let me out into the street with what I have left ... save people who are already sick.<eos> What, you think I'm gonna try to escape?<eos> I think it's silly.<eos> And given the state of the world, I think it's small.<eos> But if that's what's important to you...
She's gonna see your dad, and they'll be right back.<eos> Sit him down.<eos> Where'd you stash it, big man?<eos> I know it had to be you.<eos> Even if I did... Why would I tell you?<eos> God damn it.<eos> You tell me, or I'm gonna blow your ...<eos> Nothing they can do to you, Quincy.<eos> They need both you and Dr. Scott.<eos> Got a present for you.
I just wanna say excellent work.<eos> Top notch.<eos> - What we asked of you was not easy.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You enjoy yourself because you deserve it.<eos> I... I am.<eos> Unfortunately, it is about time for me to head out.<eos> - No!<eos> - Becky leaves for work in 45 minutes, and she'll be disappointed if I don't see her off.<eos> Listen, good for you.
And we will be happy to help you find one.<eos> Great.<eos> Just as soon as I get you the benefits.<eos> After a six-year hiatus, I found the idea of returning to school charming.<eos> No doubt it would provide the spark of inspiration I needed.<eos> Vending machines and bathrooms are down the hall.<eos> Good luck with your career paths.<eos> In this three-part series, we'll teach you how to find a job using the Internet.<eos> Raise your hand if you've ever used a computer before.<eos> Good for you.
A coffee here.<eos> Working on your MBAs?<eos> Uh, yeah, we have a big exam tomorrow.<eos> Look at that, profitability ratios.<eos> That's my specialty.<eos> Need any help?<eos> Thanks, but it's pretty complicated.<eos> Aw, I wouldn't say that.<eos> I used to be in the business myself.<eos> Good for you.
Quality control.<eos> Surely, you can't be that naive.<eos> Those criteria are about eliminating the competition, not about bolstering the ranks.<eos> If it was that easy, there'd be a Papa's every three feet.<eos> Do you think I actually put in 1,000 hours?<eos> I believed everything you said.<eos> You let me sell my house.<eos> And you never intended for me to acquire the restaurant in the first place.<eos> That is not true.<eos> In you, I saw an ambitious young man who wanted to buy one of my stores, and if it would have worked out, I would have sold it to you.
See you soon.<eos> Bye!<eos> Hi!<eos> Hi!<eos> I like your place!<eos> You haven't actually been inside before.<eos> Nope!<eos> Well, if you come to the kitchen, here's where your surprise is.<eos> OK!<eos> This reminded me of the one you were wearing the other night, so I had to buy it for you.
Your house sold quickly.<eos> I'm pretty much giving the keys back to the bank, anyway.<eos> Movers are coming tomorrow.<eos> You must be keen to put all of this behind you.<eos> Did they find anything out about your friend's murder?<eos> No, nothing at all.<eos> They said it could've been a robbery, but they don't know for sure.<eos> Yeah. You've had a tough couple months.<eos> I'll be sorry to see you go.<eos> But getting some distance will probably be the best thing for you.
I mean, I run a $100 million business.<eos> I can't have people thinking that I'm some sort of a freak.<eos> I mean, not, you know, the general public.<eos> Well, I guess you'll just have to choose between your reputation or your life.<eos> Stop being so melodramatic.<eos> Look, it's the first time she's ever done anything like this.<eos> Do you know what my wife does when she gets angry?<eos> - She shops.<eos> - Your point?<eos> My point, I don't want to read about you in the obituary column.
Her jaw was broken.<eos> She broke her ribs.<eos> - She broke her arm.<eos> - She reeked of gin, Mr. Novack.<eos> And this wasn't the first time that she's fallen.<eos> She was hospitalized just a couple of weeks ago after collapsing.<eos> Look, you're some interesting people, and I know you have a flair for the dramatic,<eos> but sometimes an accident is just an accident.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Novack.<eos> Benny, have I got something for you.
Dad always rolled with lots of cash.<eos> He was always waiting for that mint 1940 number one Joker edition to walk through his door.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you know if your father had any enemies?<eos> I guess he had some people that didn't like the way he handled himself sometimes.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Just one minute, May, okay?<eos> - Mrs. Novack.<eos> - Yes?<eos> I was just talking to May, and given the brutality of this crime, I'd like to assign an officer to you and your daughter, just to be safe, just for a few days, until we get a better handle on all of this.
Different ones?<eos> Yes.<eos> And isn't that wonderful?<eos> Team up on some, split up on others,<eos> Come back and get us if you need any help.<eos> But don't need too much help, that would be disappointing.<eos> Are you sure we're ready for this?<eos> I think that if we've learned anything it's that Whatever fate has in store for us, we should meet it head on.<eos> Trust me, you'll be fine. I've seen it.<eos> Carsen, I found this letter in the library From charlene to you sir.
Just had a...<eos> Well, she fell is all.<eos> Something about the pills they gave her.<eos> What do you mean she fell?<eos> Where's Molly?<eos> She's here at home.<eos> We all are.<eos> Your missus is sleepin', and the girl right there with her.<eos> She's stubborn, all right, your daughter.<eos> Your wife says she gets that from you.
For a bride?<eos> Nearly put a gun to his head myself when I heard.<eos> But we've come to know Claire.<eos> She's a decent woman.<eos> We don't mind her English-ness so much.<eos> Pleased to make yer acquaintance, mistress.<eos> I'm Taran MacQuarrie.<eos> You'll excuse my confusion.<eos> I thought yer husband was intending to rob the place.<eos> No, Taran, we like to leave the robbing to you.
What do you want, Horrocks?<eos> To sail to the colonies.<eos> Boston, I fancy.<eos> Then go.<eos> Scotland won't miss you.<eos> I'm gonna need money for my venture.<eos> You'll have plenty in your pockets after the raid on the rent party.<eos> It's a start, but not much of one, not after I divvy the pot with the others.<eos> My thinking was maybe you'd be willing to help a fellow.<eos> Same way as I'm helping you by keeping my mouth shut.
When you're arrested, then I'm your first call.<eos> And when I get you off, I'm the guy that got an acquittal for kid-killer Ben Crawford,<eos> Joining the ranks of the Simpson and Anthony defenders.<eos> It gives me my next 50 paying clients.<eos> You're a jerk.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Right, ha-hang on a s... wait a second.<eos> You seem like a decent guy.<eos> Danny likes you, so I'm gonna give you a little free advice.

But she does talk to you.<eos> So...<eos> You'll tell me If there's anything I need to worry about, right?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> Yeah, buddy. I got your back.<eos> Okay?<eos> You want a beer?<eos> It's like 8:30.<eos> Is it?<eos> Mr. Crawford, what can I do for you?
He got drunk and boosted a car.<eos> Got on a plane to Bangkok.<eos> He's going to be here in 17 hours.<eos> You have a son? Yeah.<eos> OK, good.<eos> I wait here for you, OK? What? You're not going to come?<eos> What about your sense of sanuk, huh?<eos> Sanuk OK, but if I die, many, many unhappy ladies!<eos> Me too!<eos> Hey, for you.
Sanuk OK, but if I die, many, many unhappy ladies!<eos> Me too!<eos> Hey, for you.<eos> For me?<eos> Yeah, too many people here don't like to pay.<eos> Exactly what kind of monk were you?<eos> Angry kind.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> I've put a dozen bodies in here myself.<eos> I made you a rich man.
I am from the State Security Department<eos> I don't care who you are<eos> I want to see my son<eos> It is not often we have poeple sneaking into our country<eos> We have those who sneak out, defectors I believe you call them<eos> Sometimes they bring with them terrible tales of our nation<eos> One person claimed she has been forced to drink water Until her belly was swollen and aching<eos> And when it was so bloated she might burst open She claimed men stand down on her stomach<eos> Now I have never heard, or seen such thing in my life<eos> If you help us If we let you and your son free
Let him go Let him go<eos> This has nothing to do with him!<eos> Let him go!<eos> Captived men don't debate<eos> They either agree, or not<eos> Let him go!<eos> He's a kid!<eos> Don't fucking touch him<eos> Do you recognise him?<eos> Perhaps we all look the same to you
He was a soldier you spared from your escape from the trainyard<eos> Killing your own people<eos> It's the act of a true patriot<eos> And where is your own country in your hour of need?<eos> He had a chance to stop you, he failed<eos> At least now he has played some part<eos> Did you feel helpless thinking you were watching your son die?<eos> You shouldn't<eos> You're not helpless<eos> Because it is all up to you
"I'll call you"<eos> But the phone, it never rings<eos> And that would justify leaving him in North Korea to rot<eos> To be beaten and tortured Nina<eos> See? This is why I like you<eos> You think like a woman too<eos> You have contacts on the Russian-Korean border<eos> Access to vehicles, equipments...<eos> Colonel, it took me years to build up those contacts<eos> When I realised we'd need help, you were the first name I thought of
A million man army...a million?<eos> And we just waltz in here and we just fucked it up in a matter of hours.<eos> I mean that's really rather embarrassing isn't it?<eos> Perhaps you need me to start the countdown from three?<eos> Go ahead He's not my kid, I don't care<eos> I think you do care<eos> Otherwise you wouldn't come here with him<eos> That's my job<eos> It's called being professional<eos> But for you

I need that.<eos> All right.<eos> You got it.<eos> I promise.<eos> Let's see if Myshkin's phone has what we need.<eos> Dansky said there was a meet tomorrow at 11, involving Kwon.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Oppenheimer.<eos> What is it?<eos> The name, does it mean something to you?
- How am I doing?<eos> - Not bad.<eos> Not sure that changes the fundamentals of this, though.<eos> You need to run along now, sonny.<eos> I'm the one with the gun.<eos> Yeah, and I'm the one holding the remote control trigger.<eos> That's right, soldier, there's a bomb here.<eos> I click this pen, ten seconds later, boom.<eos> Or I can disarm it.<eos> Simple as that, up to you.
Out now! Shit.<eos> Move!<eos> Up.<eos> Nina.<eos> - Nina! - That didn't sound too good.<eos> It's two clicks north of here.<eos> Keep on this road. It's on the right-hand side.<eos> If you would be so kind, Mr Hauser.<eos> It doesn't matter if I open the door. I can't open the vault itself.<eos> Don't need you for that.
Deleted everything from it.<eos> You don't have the translated codes?<eos> - Given me a pen and paper.<eos> - In there.<eos> - Is this the way to the hospital?<eos> - You've memorised them?<eos> Don't insult my intelligence, this was child's play.<eos> Oh, and by the way, those Russian guys you had guarding me - useless.<eos> One of them practically rolled over and gave up.<eos> I'd look into my employment practices if I were you.
Hands where I can see them.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Did you kill my son?<eos> - You're asking all the wrong questions.<eos> - Did you? ! Philip, I set the charge, I pushed the button.<eos> But it wasn't about your family.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> For yours sins.<eos> It was about you.<eos> You were the one I was meant to kill to keep my cover intact.
But it wasn't about your family.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> For yours sins.<eos> It was about you.<eos> You were the one I was meant to kill to keep my cover intact.<eos> Your cover?<eos> My name is Christopher Desmond.<eos> I worked for the British, same as you.<eos> The British government sanctioned my murder?<eos> - I don't believe you.
The program, dubbed "America Works," was developed in secret.<eos> Any details are the by-product of speculation, but sources suggest it will have elements from both liberal and conservative agendas.<eos> What remains to be seen is whether a Republican-controlled Congress will cooperate in pushing the program forward.<eos> The White House has faced significant opposition from the G.O.P since Congress began its current session, and many speculate that the President's liberal application of veto power may leave congressional leaders disinclined to support this new jobs program...<eos> Additionally, many Democratic supporters of President Underwood from his days as House Majority were voted out of office in November, diminishing his personal influence over legislature.<eos> Low approval ratings are a continuing concern for the Underwood administration, and congressional sources suggest that the choice to tackle unemployment may be part of a campaign strategy for 2016.<eos> ...and if today's announcement is received well, President Underwood's campaign certainly has an opportunity to benefit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sir?<eos> We're ready for you in five seconds.
Please.<eos> Congressman's what the interns call me.<eos> All right.<eos> Brad it is.<eos> Now as for your title, I was thinking Special Advisor?<eos> - Title doesn't matter to me.<eos> - You pick what you want.<eos> And you make your own hours.<eos> Come and go as you like.<eos> Uh, compensation, would 220 a year work for you?
Ladies and gentlemen, the session is over.<eos> Please, right this way.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> I hear you've recently taken up surfing.<eos> We have a few spots on the Black Sea.<eos> It's mostly so I can pose for the photos.<eos> Yes, I've seen them.<eos> It plays well with the young people.<eos> It's important they see their president has some fun, doesn't take himself too seriously.<eos> I have a gift for you.
Welcome.<eos> - Mr. Vice President.<eos> Thank you.<eos> President Petrov, welcome.<eos> It's a pleasure.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Oh, it's serviceable.<eos> - You look fantastic, as always.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> All eyes at the table will be on you, not them.
So, to President Petrov, and all of the great things that our great nations will do together.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - Hear, hear!<eos> Which is Russian for, "Never trust the French."<eos> And thank you to the president and First Lady for your grace and hospitality.<eos> Now, a little more recently than de Tocqueville, about, uh, 30 years ago, Mikhail Gorbachev came to this very house and talked of an end to our "winter of discontent."<eos> I think it's safe to say that that winter seems far gone now.<eos> And here, on this beautiful May evening, I welcome a "spring of enchantment."<eos> Now we all know which of you brings the enchantment to the table.<eos> To you, Mrs. Underwood.
- Don't say, uh...<eos> Tolstoy?<eos> - Pushkin.<eos> "A deception that elevates us is dearer than a host of low truths."<eos> He didn't make that toast.<eos> - No, he didn't.<eos> Tell me, do you actually know your Pushkin, or did you just study up before I arrived?<eos> Does it really matter?<eos> So, this is what he does?<eos> He leaves the seduction to you.
- "Pimping," yes?<eos> He's pimping you out.<eos> How charming you are.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And you make a much better First Lady than ambassador, from what my people tell me.<eos> Only teasing.<eos> More wine... for the ambassador.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm gonna have to go in a couple minutes.<eos> Mr. President, my gift for you.
She looks like a Svetla.<eos> Well, I don't think we can end the evening on a higher note, so I want to thank you all for coming, for the singing and the dancing and the vodka.<eos> But most especially to my friend, Peter Cincotti.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Coming all the way here to the White House.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Thank you for a wonderful evening.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> And thank you to you, Mr. Cincotti.
The same thing as you do:<eos> Mr. Corrigan's release.<eos> If I withdraw the resolution.<eos> I think Moscow would certainly see it as a sign of goodwill.<eos> Well, we don't barter goodwill for the freedom of American citizens.<eos> I actually advocated for his immediate deportation.<eos> I agree that tossing him in jail is counterproductive, but my superiors are adamant.<eos> Save Petrov from himself.<eos> It's not my place to question him.<eos> Unlike you, I'm not married to my boss.
Punishing a member of the press.<eos> Collusion.<eos> Pay for play.<eos> And I'll deny.<eos> And do you think the head of the association is gonna admit anything?<eos> You don't have any friends, Ayla, on either side of the fence.<eos> The president just made a statement about free speech.<eos> Now you're gonna start kicking reporters out of the White House?<eos> - No.<eos> Just you.
I've never had anything but his best interests at heart.<eos> You don't care about Robert.<eos> You wanted to sideline me.<eos> So you actually think you have a shot at this office?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> And so does the leadership.<eos> You're in over your head, Heather, no matter what Birch and Womack are telling you.<eos> Why should it concern you, Mr. President?<eos> You've announced that you're not running.<eos> - Is this personal for you?
- Howard, I get it.<eos> Your brother's very important to the firm.<eos> Sorry I called you a pig fucker.<eos> Well... We owe you some money, don't we?<eos> The of-counsel fee.<eos> I think we discussed 20,000.<eos> That and whatever the common-fund proceeds of Sandpiper ultimately adds up to, you'll receive 20 percent of that.<eos> Should be a very nice payday for you when it comes.<eos> Yep.<eos> I've got something for you too.
The New York Times. The Wall Street Journal. They're a must.<eos> There's a newsstand on Eubank that has both of them at 6 a.m.<eos> Which is good. He's an early riser.<eos> The Albuquerque Journal gets delivered. But somebody still has to bring it in for him.<eos> You've been doing all of this every day?<eos> For over a year?<eos> - You'll take care of this?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> I'll get it done and done right.<eos> I always liked you, Jimmy.
I've had dozens of them.<eos> I want to take our message on the road.<eos> Rather than follow Europe, I want to lead them for a change.<eos> Bring eugenics to the continent.<eos> Teach them a little something about American scientific discovery.<eos> Precisely.<eos> And who better to deliver that message than a strong, handsome man such as yourself?<eos> I'm flattered, but...<eos> But what?<eos> You'd prefer to stay here and be the subordinate to a Negro? And to the man who chose that Negro over you?
Hey, chubby, keep my name out of your mouth.<eos> I'm not your braces. Enough.<eos> Nelson, zip it.<eos> Krumitz, game face.<eos> A baby's life's at stake.<eos> Focus.<eos> That's the guy that busted me?<eos> Krumitz-- he's the best white hat hacker in the world.<eos> You hack it, he will come.<eos> So is that why the judge sent me to you?
All right, let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> FBI! Police! Freeze!<eos> Drop it!<eos> On the ground!<eos> Line 'em up.<eos> Find the computers. Get into 'em.<eos> Where's Caleb Reynolds?<eos> Why you ask me?<eos> Every guy here keeps sneaking a peek at you.
- That's beyond our means.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> It's a drop in the bucket from your estate.<eos> You said you wanted in because you believed in this campaign.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Sounds like it's more about money.<eos> It's about being valued.<eos> Two-fifty and the points is a bargain.<eos> I want to work for you, just not as a beggar.<eos> We don't trust you yet, Doug.

Did you get it?<eos> Thank you. Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for your support.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> - I liked your speech, Ms. Dunbar.<eos> - And I've heard more than a few.<eos> - I appreciate you saying that, sir.<eos> I know Iowans aren't easily impressed.<eos> What you said about integrity? Well, if you can bring that to Washington, I'll caucus for you.
Thank you for releasing Mr. Corrigan.<eos> It means a great deal to us.<eos> And I'm sure a great deal to his loved ones.<eos> We all want the same things.<eos> This is just a first step.<eos> Mr. Litsky, my chief of staff, will escort you to the facilities.<eos> - Shall we?<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - After you.
When I lie to you, you'll never know it, and it will be for a good reason.<eos> Corrigan doesn't fall into that category.<eos> I should never have invited you here.<eos> You and I can work together.<eos> This afternoon is proof.<eos> I would've been better off holding my ground.<eos> And forcing us to pass the resolution?<eos> The United Nations?<eos> They mean nothing to me.<eos> If they meant nothing to you, you would have held your ground.
You want change?<eos> Then learn how to compromise.<eos> - Be a fucking adult about this, Michael.<eos> - I need to think.<eos> Okay? I need time.<eos> The plane leaves tomorrow.<eos> You should go back.<eos> I need time to think alone.<eos> - Clear my head.<eos> - I'm not leaving here without you.
Mr. Shepard, the President needs you right now!
I've got one last plane to be still taken.<eos> It's an old one.<eos> We call her Bessy.<eos> We still use her for training.<eos> This is it.<eos> I've gotta go.<eos> Sergeant Rock will take care of you from here.<eos> Be safe.<eos> Good luck.<eos> The General speaks very highly of you.
100 miles?<eos> We're less than 100 miles from there.<eos> That's right.<eos> We are.<eos> Of course, the weather along the eastern aboard from Canada to the Carolinas continues to be downright apocalyptic, with a massive low-pressure trough dominating the region.<eos> Gilbert, I got your message.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Brian "Jonesy" Jones, NASA Administrator, meet my son Finlay.<eos> Mr. Shepard, heard a lot about you.<eos> The Colonel can't stop talking about you.
Queen Medea.<eos> Home sweet home.<eos> Priest!<eos> Tie her to the mouth.<eos> These dreams don't seem to be leading us to the Lexicon.<eos> What else do you see?<eos> An old man, grey hair.<eos> A beard.<eos> I think he might be drowning.<eos> Oracle... my mother died before she could explain the riddle of my life, so I come to you, great Oracle of Gaia.
Goodbye, Oracle.<eos> I'm not leaving you!<eos> You won't like the forest of Troezen.<eos> No, we are not going to the forest of Troezen!<eos> His son?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> The visions were very clear.<eos> You bled him?<eos> Just to see if he was genuine.<eos> Once I'd established that, I intended to bring him to you, of course.
- This doesn't prove anything.<eos> - We'll subpoena the contract.<eos> Handwriting analysis will prove that Nasim signed it.<eos> You switched out those contracts, Mr. Prasad.<eos> Nasim also told us that you brokered the deal with Navilet, that you met with Gordon Sloane a half a dozen times.<eos> You cooked up this scam together, didn't you?<eos> - This is ridiculous.<eos> - It was a win-win.<eos> Sloane sells a warehouse full of drugs that nobody wants, and you get a big kickback.<eos> It's only a matter of time before we find that offshore account and link it back to you.
Hold on.<eos> If you were willing to consider the older drug, I might be able to offer you... An incentive.<eos> How much?<eos> $100,000 to make sure the contract went through.<eos> But I knew the consul wouldn't sign the contract.<eos> He had all of my research on the vaccines.<eos> So you and Sloane made the consul think he was buying the new vaccine.<eos> Then you switched out the paperwork to cover your asses, so it looked like he knowingly bought the older drug.<eos> You and Nasim were already in a relationship.<eos> She was in love with you.
We're very sorry.<eos> My children had been vaccinated.<eos> They were supposed to be safe.<eos> The reporter told you that the vaccine the consul supplied was out of date, didn't he?<eos> I can only imagine how you felt.<eos> And then when you found out that the man you worked for was responsible...<eos> You must've been outraged.<eos> That's why you told us about the reporter...<eos> So that we'd uncover this awful crime.<eos> But you didn't mention your children because you knew that would make you a suspect.
Don't move, Chayton!<eos> Fuck you, cop.<eos> The next shot will blow your fucking face off.<eos> There are no guns allowed in here.<eos> We're cops, asshole.<eos> This man is wanted for murder.<eos> Not here, he's not.<eos> Here, that man is under my protection.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll shoot you, too.
Portland firehouse No.41.<eos> Okay.<eos> One more time.<eos> Judge issued a warrant for you to search firehouse 41?<eos> Yep.<eos> Based on the fact that you got bullied as a kid?<eos> No.<eos> Based on probable cause and general jerk-holery.<eos> You know, boys are pretty rough-and-tumble growing up, especially sons of cops and firefighters.<eos> You ever think that that's all that was going on between you and the D'Agostinos?
Tripped me, beat me, squirrelled me, shaved me, burned me, tied me up, and took my most valuable possession.<eos> Is that enough for you?<eos> What's "squirrelled"?<eos> Exactly what you think it is.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Ugh. That's why cops hate firemen.<eos> Makes me want to vomit.<eos> Out of the way.<eos> Official police business.<eos> You said the D'Agostino brothers also stole something from you.
The canary sings.<eos> You willing to testify?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> 'Cause I want my old man to be proud of me.<eos> Nick and Sam say you're a coward...<eos> That you're a dirty cop. Yeah, okay.<eos> All right, so, what,<eos> - you want to know if you can trust me?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> I got no choice but to trust you, 'cause I'm placing my life in your hands.
You started in Seattle, where the arson investigator discovered your jug-and-flare system.<eos> Then you moved to Portland, where you were the arson investigator, so you could falsify your own repots, say the arsonist used an electric ignition.<eos> This guy hates women.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> - Why do you help him? - This guy?<eos> Oh, yeah, no, he is the worst.<eos> But, uh, I don't actually think he hates women more than he hates men.<eos> Thank you, Detective Gravely.<eos> He hates everybody.<eos> But he really hates people who try to get away with murder, and he hates you.
And I'm guessing we find something interesting in her trunk.<eos> Chop chop!<eos> Cooch County's a two-hour drive.<eos> - You already owe me for gas. - Whoa!<eos> You don't want to make the arrest?<eos> She's your collar, Gravely.<eos> Make the girl scouts proud.<eos> Samantha Orland, you are under arrest for arson.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Everything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
It was a crime of passion.<eos> They've heard the word before.<eos> Fine.<eos> I want new work fast.<eos> Problem solved.<eos> May I help you?<eos> Is Sally home?<eos> I'm a friend of hers.<eos> Sally.<eos> There's a young man here to see you.
Yeah, just finished my freshman year up at Purchase.<eos> That's supposed to be very good.<eos> I'm actually going back to school myself this fall.<eos> Very cool.<eos> Can I have some actual money to take to Playland?<eos> What?<eos> Of course.<eos> Go get my pocketbook.<eos> Can't you?<eos> Sorry for running past you.
Yes, you do.<eos> Create something of lasting value.<eos> In advertising?<eos> This is supposed to be about my job, not the meaning of life.<eos> So you think those things are unrelated?<eos> I didn't know you'd be in a mood.<eos> Do you want me to do this or not?<eos> Why don't you just write down all of your dreams so I can shit on them?<eos> Where the hell were you?<eos> Good morning to you, too.
You must have go everywhere, huh?<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Are you the driver of that vehicle?<eos> Oh. Is it the meter?<eos> I have change.<eos> Sir, are you aware that vehicle was reported stolen earlier today?<eos> Stand up, sir.<eos> I'm placing you under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law.
To:<eos> Nate Adamson Subject: how is the vow working?<eos> Send.<eos> Mr. Nilson is ready for you.<eos> Hey Viv, I got to go.<eos> - I heard.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - Thank you baby.<eos> I'll call you after.<eos> The problem with Terrance Robb is that he's represented by you.

Is he really?<eos> I never thought.<eos> I could fall for you.<eos> I didn't think.<eos> You were my type.<eos> But it looks like<eos> I could be wrong<eos> Baby,<eos> Excuse me, ma'am,<eos> I have an urgent call for you.
He thinks someone's out to destroy his business.<eos> My mother has angina and the doctors think it made her vulnerable to the effects of the poison.<eos> I really should be at the hospital with her.<eos> Just a few questions, then we can let you go.<eos> How long have you been running the vineyard?<eos> 15 years.<eos> We wanted to build something that we could pass on to our son.<eos> It has perhaps been a little harder than we thought.<eos> But our first wine was a hit and, in my opinion, this new wine is even better.<eos> But you think someone's taken against you and your vineyard?
I'd very much like to know why.<eos> Well, just business.<eos> He offered to buy the vineyard.<eos> Er, but for half of what the place is actually worth.<eos> Obviously, he'd heard about our recent problems and decided he could capitalise.<eos> ~ He thought you were desperate?<eos> ~ Well, we weren't that desperate.<eos> And for the record I'd just like to say that I was just as angry as William was when I heard.<eos> I thought Louis was a friend.<eos> He thought a great deal of you, didn't he?
Obviously, he'd heard about our recent problems and decided he could capitalise.<eos> ~ He thought you were desperate?<eos> ~ Well, we weren't that desperate.<eos> And for the record I'd just like to say that I was just as angry as William was when I heard.<eos> I thought Louis was a friend.<eos> He thought a great deal of you, didn't he?<eos> Louis?<eos> I suppose so.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Did Mr Paynton's feelings towards you go beyond friendship?
Why?<eos> Because you knew you were responsible for a little girl's death or because you thought it might be bad for business?<eos> You watched our family go through hell and you didn't raise a finger to help us.<eos> Can we go now, please?<eos> We don't have to stay here another second.<eos> The Carnarvons are terrible people, aren't they?<eos> Isn't that obvious?<eos> I certainly understand why you didn't want your daughter near them?<eos> Just like Kevin understood.<eos> And that's why he kidnapped Tina for you.
I just wanted to protect you.<eos> Like I should have protected Jessica.<eos> Please.<eos> Please tell me that you understand.<eos> Please!<eos> ~ I do.<eos> ~ Stay away from her.<eos> ~ She needs me.<eos> ~ No.<eos> You need her to need you, so you don't feel like a monster.
Smellsgoodtoo.<eos> Fine.<eos> An audience is given only by proving oneself worthy.<eos> What are we talkin'?<eos> Slaying a dragon?<eos> Swallowing a centipede?<eos> Was that there before?<eos> You and only you can enter.<eos> Tamsin:<eos> Your test awaits you, ms. Dennis.
We have to find it.<eos> We can't see anything.<eos> Spencer, we have to find it.<eos> What can I do for you? I'm looking for a Detective Holbrook.<eos> I'm his father.<eos> Who are you?<eos> A friend of his.<eos> Is he around?<eos> Haven't seen him in weeks.<eos> I thought he was taking care of you.
Beat his father while he watched.<eos> Jesus.<eos> I knew the kid would still be alive.<eos> At least until they took him out of the city.<eos> I tracked the Russians to a warehouse not far from here.<eos> Thought I was being smart, how fast I found them.<eos> Turns out, I wasn't.<eos> They were waiting for you.<eos> And I walked right into it.<eos> So, they took this kid just to get to you?
No... sorry.<eos> Just being thorough.<eos> You have a good night, ma'am.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You, too.<eos> See?<eos> No reason to get all stabby.<eos> Boy, were you right about that cologne.<eos> What, does he dip himself in that crap?<eos> He didn't believe you.
Do you have somewhere you can go?<eos> I'm cat-sitting for... a woman I work with.<eos> Her brother's sick. She's in Oklahoma.<eos> What's the address?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm thinking if I make it through the night, I may need some help getting patched up.<eos> Tenth and 54th.<eos> Apartment 412, um, in the building above the liquor store.<eos> Thank you, Claire.<eos> I don't believe you.
- Stop!<eos> - Rubbing up on me?<eos> Got ya.<eos> Officer Tully, would you make some more coffee?<eos> The pot's empty.<eos> - I was going to.<eos> - Oh, thank you very much.<eos> Your Highness.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Call for you.
Come on, hurry!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on Anthony!<eos> Come on, hurry!<eos> Come on Anthony!<eos> And on the day he's crowned 19 times champion jockey Tony McCoy gets home in the first.<eos> So, yes, I would like him to retire this year, mainly because of safety reasons, and to get him in one piece,<eos> I don't want to have a husband that you have to help out of bed every morning, and, you know, ideally, that would be...<eos> Erm, yeah.<eos> Can you sum up what 19, what number 19 means to you?
- Was there anything else?<eos> - Okay, no thanks, bye.<eos> That's what's got him where he is, the fact that people know that he will always ride everyday if it's physically possible, and that is the difference.<eos> Yeah, very well, no, that's fine for AP tonight.<eos> Getting to the tally of 4,000, that's probably a lot to do why he's got there, 'cause either he'll go racing when a lot of people, years ago, wouldn't have done.<eos> They would've took days off, but not him, no.<eos> Rushing round these little tracks, riding winners for a couple of thousand, and that... Are those basically, are those his championship months, aren't they?<eos> Yeah, they are.<eos> I think what makes it extraordinary is he's only got to compete against himself. Yeah, he's still willing to get in the car, drive five hours up to Newcastle for one ride, turn around and then do it all over again.<eos> Thank you very much, sir, and the best of luck to you.
That's the idea. So you tell me as and when that's gonna be...<eos> - That's the million-dollar question.<eos> - Absolutely! - I'm not going to make you answer.<eos> - We need to get on with this...<eos> We need to get going.<eos> - Right, we're ready to go.<eos> - Super.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - Just give me a smile there.<eos> Okay, we'll keep them nice and white for you.
Good Answer in fourth.<eos> And it's Mr Mole, messed around at the start, but he will give AP McCoy his two hundredth winner of the season.<eos> 200 of the season for Tony McCoy, it's doubtful he's ridden many more dramatic races this year.<eos> I'm going to read off a stat here.<eos> I know.<eos> I hope you don't just take it lightly but it's your tenth time that you've brought up a double century of winners.<eos> That is quite an incredible achievement.<eos> I'm going to tell you something else, it's going to be the last time I ride 200 winners.<eos> Because, I'm going to be retiring at the end of the season,<eos> - so there's a bit of news for you.
- Hello!<eos> How are you?<eos> - Good. Thank you.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> The last fence in sight, tomorrow, the 4:25 at Sandown, so, for the last time as a full-time jockey.<eos> Evening, AP McCoy.<eos> Good evening, how are you?<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - I'm okay. Thanks. Good.<eos> AP, we've got a little surprise for you,
Welcome back.<eos> How was Gaffney?<eos> Do we have a time set for Ambassador Caspi yet?<eos> Her office is stalling.<eos> Get her schedule.<eos> We'll go wherever she is.<eos> I think she'll be at the cocktail reception tonight - at the Mexican Consulate.<eos> - I'll call and find out.<eos> What's that?<eos> It came in for you this morning.
We wouldn't be talking about thousands of jobs.<eos> We'd be talking about millions.<eos> Later this afternoon, I will visit FDR's memorial to pay my respects to the man who ushered in Social Security 80 years ago.<eos> We honor the dead for giving us the world we inherited.<eos> However, we must recognize we are doomed if we allow the dead to govern us.<eos> Thank you, and God bless the United States of America.<eos> From NBC News in Washington, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.<eos> Good morning and welcome to Meet the Press.<eos> I have with me Congresswoman Huntley and Congressman Greer.<eos> Congresswoman, let me start with you.
You weren't bothered to let him pay for your first campaign?<eos> Well, that's politics.<eos> It's different.<eos> You take money wherever you can get it.<eos> No, this was our first home.<eos> - Was it a happy home?<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> I thought you brought me here because we were gonna cut through the bullshit.<eos> This book is supposed to be about America Works.<eos> There is no book without you at the center of it.
- So act like it.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> My husband formally approved our own humanitarian package for eighty million.<eos> Zimbabwe will be withdrawing the amendment tomorrow.<eos> And when the resolution goes to a vote, I expect Israel to support it like the loyal ally she is.<eos> Not lie to us.<eos> That's not the way to solicit our support.<eos> I'm not soliciting.<eos> I'm demanding.<eos> I feel sorry for you, Claire.
- Better.<eos> - It doesn't hurt as much?<eos> No, it's worse.<eos> But now I've got a weapon.<eos> Let's dispense with the formalities shall we, Ambassador?<eos> Very well.<eos> What do you propose?<eos> In return for Samara and our Musketeer, France will hand over Tariq Alaman.<eos> - And the cipher?<eos> - That's between you and him.
Where are you going?<eos> My husband sent for me.<eos> I didn't want to disturb the Queen.<eos> Off you go, then.<eos> My poor husband, Lord de Winter, died in England and left me penniless.<eos> On my way home, I was taken hostage by those villains.<eos> The rest, Your Majesty knows.<eos> Well, I sensed you were high born.<eos> Breeding shows even in the vilest company.<eos> I have something for you, Sire.
My ring!<eos> You kept it safe.<eos> My company does not please you.<eos> I shall withdraw.<eos> No.<eos> You are the one thing keeping me sane.<eos> It is my son.<eos> He's very ill.<eos> Perhaps dying.<eos> I knew there was a sadness in you.
No. But I'll learn.<eos> And it will be my children's home.<eos> They will belong there.<eos> You should search for your own home, too, one day.<eos> You're looking at it.<eos> These are not your people, Porthos.<eos> However hard you try, you will never truly be one of them.<eos> I'm a Musketeer.<eos> That's home enough for me, hmm?<eos> I have something for you.
What gives you the right to bring me back?<eos> We need your help.<eos> You don't need a lord to tell you how to work the fields.<eos> ~ You've always done it.<eos> ~ It's not us.<eos> It's Baron Renard.<eos> He burns the crops and poisons what's left.<eos> He wants your land for himself.<eos> We need the protection of our liege lord, the Comte de la Fere.<eos> ~ You.
~ Them! Don't fret.<eos> When this is over I'll make sure they're well looked after.<eos> They're my people now after all.<eos> I'm pleased to hear you say so.<eos> The thought of wearing this again.<eos> I cannot tell you how that makes me feel.<eos> What you've done for me, it means so much.<eos> I've done nothing for you.<eos> Catherine, what are you talking about?<eos> The others are asking for you.
You should all try reading the Bible once in a while.<eos> All right, Aramis, as you're the expert on God, you can deal with her.<eos> Go to the camp tonight.<eos> Gain her trust, find out what her weaknesses are.<eos> I didn't become a Musketeer to destroy an honest woman's reputation.<eos> Would you rather see her march thousands of innocent people to a Spanish slaughterhouse?<eos> What does the King say about all this?<eos> Will he meet her?<eos> The King, he is busy with affairs of state.<eos> I have a present for you.
And you should do yours.<eos> The Dauphin is with his nurse.<eos> We still have an hour or two yet.<eos> How many men do you have guarding him?<eos> - Two.<eos> - Should be at least four.<eos> You should have four guards outside this room at all times.<eos> Aramis...<eos> Do you love me?<eos> You know I'm very, very fond of you.
- Should be at least four.<eos> You should have four guards outside this room at all times.<eos> Aramis...<eos> Do you love me?<eos> You know I'm very, very fond of you.<eos> Dear God, I have given my honour and my body to a notorious womaniser.<eos> I'm a complete fool.<eos> Marguerite...<eos> One day soon you must marry a man of your own rank.<eos> I'm a soldier, I'm beneath you.
- I'm French!<eos> They've sent him to kill you.<eos> No.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I've deserted to join your cause.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Milady.<eos> Let go!<eos> You're not like the other court ladies.<eos> I can smell it on you, Like a sour note in a fine perfume.
When she was a child, they threw rocks, cursed her.<eos> Now? They worship her as a prophet.<eos> It must have been hard back then.<eos> We were hated and cursed wherever we went.<eos> I'm never going back to that life.<eos> Emilie is an innocent.<eos> God gave her to me to protect.<eos> And I won't let anyone hurt her.<eos> I had a vision.<eos> I saw you and me with the King.
Just put on the dress!<eos> This has got a rip in it.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Who told you to do this?<eos> Who ordered my death?<eos> Tell me and I will spare your life.<eos> Perales.<eos> It was Perales.<eos> Ambassador.<eos> This was just delivered for you.
Remarkable that a street slut can bear herself with such arrogance.<eos> Did the Cardinal teach you that?<eos> The Cardinal taught me a great deal.<eos> Be careful I don't show you how much.<eos> Perhaps I should give the King that list of your crimes.<eos> How many men did you kill, exactly?<eos> I lost count.<eos> I am finished with that life.<eos> Not quite.<eos> I have a job for you.
No.<eos> I... I'm here to see the King.<eos> You liar!<eos> Traitor!<eos> There will be blood for this!<eos> Your blood!<eos> The King is willing to let me handle this in my own way?<eos> His only concern is to see the mob pacified.<eos> Emilie's own fate is unimportant.<eos> He has complete faith in you, Treville.
We know you didn't kill him.<eos> Then why am I here?<eos> We want to help you.<eos> Your visions are from soup, not God.<eos> We think you've been drugged.<eos> Perhaps for a long time.<eos> Your mother's been poisoning you.<eos> My mother?<eos> My mother loves me.<eos> She would never hurt me. I don't believe you!

If I needed a blessing from the pope, I'd climb into Castel Sant'Angelo and see a prisoner there.<eos> I'm afraid you would find only an empty cell.<eos> Will you excuse us, my child?<eos> Your Holiness.<eos> Is this the da Vinci you spoke so highly of?<eos> The architect of war?<eos> Signora Cereta of Venice.<eos> The architect of the pope's crusade.<eos> Well, if you want to take on the force of the Ottomans, you should stay, hear what I have to say.<eos> I don't need you to talk to heaven.

'Cause I asked how can you be arrested for doing an abortion you didn't do on a girl who wasn't with child.<eos> Got him thinking about them loopholes.<eos> Well, it's not unusual for cops working with Mr. Comstock to set traps such as the one that snared you.<eos> Mr. Comstock's a pain in my arse.<eos> His Society for the Suppression of Vice does keep me in business, but those arrests rarely end in a conviction.<eos> So I've asked the judge to schedule an immediate hearing to decide if the case should be dismissed before ever going to trial.<eos> See?<eos> Me and him, we're gonna have you out of here in no time.<eos> Now I just need to get some information.<eos> The charges against you were filed under the name Rose Dolan.
It's how a man survives in the city.<eos> But the two who drag me into serious malfeasance are a society lady and a fucking nun.<eos> How is Harry doing?<eos> You ever been inside of a jailhouse?<eos> Well, it ain't exactly the Waldorf.<eos> After a while, those walls, they start whispering at you, telling you you ain't never gonna get out.<eos> I've known a few tough lads turn to jelly after a while in a place like that.<eos> Now, Harry, she's tougher than all of them. But not for much longer.<eos> She's starting to go.<eos> She's lucky to have you.
She needs more than me, miss.<eos> What can I do?<eos> Well, I did get her one of them good old lawyers.<eos> Upper-class like you.<eos> Problem is, can't afford him.<eos> But you can.<eos> I can't ask my family...<eos> You have a boat in every port from here to Persia.<eos> You must have something set aside.<eos> Especially after what she did for you.
The Carr surgery.<eos> I know it was you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because there's no chance you would ever make a mistake?<eos> No, because there is no chance that you are a better doctor than I am.<eos> Oh, for God's sake. Shut up, both of you.<eos> Everett, you're supposed to be on the ward.<eos> Have I missed the twins?<eos> Just.<eos> They asked after you.
Now, if the board sees fit to prevent me from practicing in New York, there are hundreds of other institutions and doctors whom I'm sure would welcome me.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Gallinger.<eos> Dr. Edwards, how much have you studied the eugenics movement?<eos> I've read several articles in "Lancet" and in other medical journals.<eos> And you believe that's enough to discredit an entire field of study? A field which is now being taught in hundreds of medical schools and universities?<eos> This isn't about a field of study. It is about intention.<eos> But Dr. Gallinger's intentions were, in his words, for the greater good.<eos> Yes, but for the greater good of whom?<eos> Himself?<eos> You, Dr. Phelps?
Well, you concealed it well.<eos> He's letting me know that I'm going to have to earn my way into the operating room and letting them know that he's going to ease me into the fold.<eos> There's thought in everything he does.<eos> He's a very deliberate man.<eos> Is that why he has you taking notes of his meetings?<eos> Why, because I couldn't possibly be a surgeon like you?<eos> No, I just meant... no, I'm sorry, I... you're a surgeon.<eos> I...<eos> I hadn't...<eos> Look at you.
You brighten their day.<eos> Well, how could you not?<eos> Were you referring to the comatose patient?<eos> The men who were delirious on morphine?<eos> Or the ones who were asleep?<eos> Then you brighten mine.<eos> Don't you believe me?<eos> I'm holding a full bedpan, so it's harder to believe than you realize.<eos> Look, you're a quick and clever girl and I like that, but when will you stop being clever and give me a chance?<eos> There's no shortage of not so clever nurses around here all hired by you who've already given you a chance and then some.
Yale built theirs down the street.<eos> It's almost 12 stories.<eos> But you'll see ours is far more tasteful.<eos> Is this how I used to do it?<eos> Of course.<eos> It looks wrong to me.<eos> It looks lovely.<eos> I can start again.<eos> Are you all right, Ellie?<eos> I just want everything to be right for you, Everett.
- I made promises I knew I would never keep.<eos> - Amen.<eos> I hurt anybody who ever loved me and I never felt a moment of regret.<eos> Amen, brother.<eos> Instead, I felt a vain glory for having succeeded in it.<eos> Amen.<eos> But I succeeded nothing outside of destroying myself.<eos> I know that God is punishing me, but I hope,<eos> I pray that He can see just how much I've changed.<eos> Stay on the path and His forgiving light will soon shine down upon you.
And sliced me up good.<eos> Bellevue boys sewed me up like a rag doll.<eos> But here I am.<eos> And here you are.<eos> Jimmy, please...<eos> I ain't here to bust you up.<eos> I'm just delivering a message.<eos> You got to come to Tammany Hall and make your accounts for this here building.<eos> You work for Tammany? Yeah.<eos> And I ain't Jimmy to you no more.
I'm Mr. James Fester.<eos> You'd do well to remember that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. Barrow gave me very specific instructions that I must have a written report of the patient's ailment before I can dispense any of the narcotics.<eos> And only to a doctor or a nurse.<eos> Answer me this, then.<eos> How am I supposed to write a report from Houston Street or wherever when I've just picked up a body that's been kicked in the chest by a mule?<eos> Now, having those drugs on the ambulance could be the difference between putting them on the ward or putting them in the morgue.<eos> Good news, Herman.<eos> I was at the club last night carousing with the fellows and we got to talking about you.
I was at the club last night carousing with the fellows and we got to talking about you.<eos> I've now got enough backers to bring you in to interview for membership.<eos> Really?<eos> Not to worry.<eos> I'll be by your side the whole time trumpeting your worthiness.<eos> Least I can do.<eos> - Thank you. - You're welcome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I didn't want to keep you waiting.<eos> I had to finish my school studies and do my hair just right for you.
I didn't want to keep you waiting.<eos> I had to finish my school studies and do my hair just right for you.<eos> I hope you'll forgive me.<eos> Excuse me, I am next.<eos> Hermie, sorry.<eos> I didn't see you.<eos> Apparently not.<eos> Hello, Judge Corwin.<eos> Herman.<eos> It's just that I've been so distracted with my school studies and doing my hair just right for you.
Hello, Judge Corwin.<eos> Herman.<eos> It's just that I've been so distracted with my school studies and doing my hair just right for you.<eos> Please don't be mad, Hermie.<eos> You know how special you are to me.<eos> And to the judge and to that fat fellow before him and to the Spaniard before him.<eos> Yes, I have been waiting that long.<eos> Ever since you obtained a new boss, it seems harder than ever to see you.<eos> Did he take out an advertisement in "The Morning Telegraph"? Hmm?<eos> Is there a billboard of you on Broadway?
Ever since you obtained a new boss, it seems harder than ever to see you.<eos> Did he take out an advertisement in "The Morning Telegraph"? Hmm?<eos> Is there a billboard of you on Broadway?<eos> Are you jealous?<eos> I just thought you would always want me at the head of the line.<eos> I do.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> They make me do it that way.<eos> I am not an idiot, Junia.<eos> I'm well aware this is a job for you.
Our syphilitic sow is now three degrees above normal.<eos> We have no idea if quinine will even cure malaria in a pig.<eos> Well, in five more degrees, we'll load her up with it and find out.<eos> In the meantime, we let the fever rage.<eos> You've got a visitor.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> I need to begin a full dissection of this girl's body.<eos> And I'll return in an hour and take the pig's temperature.<eos> You know, if people actually knew what you did in here, they wouldn't trust you to give them a fucking aspirin.
I'm not well at all.<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> Let me handle this.<eos> Forgive me. My wife and I were overcome by the news.<eos> I was just telling the detective a little of your history with Dr. Cotton.<eos> Remarkable man.<eos> What's more, I'm proud to say, a real bond of friendship developed between us during his treatment of my wife.<eos> Milk and sugar?<eos> Milk, please.<eos> This one's for you.
Four times already.<eos> Headaches are constant.<eos> She's in the throes of it now.<eos> My big concern is the jaundice.<eos> Do you think it's cirrhosis?<eos> That's incredibly rare.<eos> Afraid so.<eos> We thought all we had to deal with was a hurricane, but now we've added a twister in the mix.<eos> Dr. Gallinger.<eos> There's an urgent call for you downstairs.
This is Henry Robertson. Hello.<eos> Look, we have an emergency.<eos> We need all nurses here immediately.<eos> You live with Nurse Nash, don't you?<eos> No need to get changed.<eos> Report directly to Nurse Taylor.<eos> She'll tell you where you're most needed.<eos> And don't bother with normal admissions protocol.<eos> Just sign them all in as John Doe and we'll sort it out later.<eos> Nurse Taylor, I have four more sets of hands for you.
Neither can I.<eos> Seems to reach a part of the brain that isn't physical.<eos> If one could suggest to someone who was hypnotized to do all sorts of humorous feats, then why not use it for something more practical?<eos> Change people's perception.<eos> Curb their addiction.<eos> I've heard crazier ideas.<eos> In this room, actually.<eos> What habits does your subject have?<eos> Simple, direct instructions.<eos> - Mr. Cleary... - Mm. ...when I blow on you, you will wake and you will no longer be interested in smoking your pipe.
Go on, get out.<eos> I wanted to present something to you.<eos> Are you familiar with Garrison Carr?<eos> No.<eos> He's a bit of an established thinker in certain communities.<eos> He's in need of a hernia repair and I'd like to perform it.<eos> Which communities?<eos> Little Africa.<eos> Harlem.<eos> Perhaps if the request to the board came from you.
I want to see what bones and organs they might share.<eos> If you want them to take their clothes off, that'll cost more if that's what you want them for.<eos> No, that is not what I want them for.<eos> Many men do.<eos> Not a one ever said it wasn't worth the money.<eos> If you want to wait in the lobby, I'll be about an hour.<eos> If you'll just follow me.<eos> All the modern gadgets... electric toaster, gas stove.<eos> They're even installing a dumbwaiter all the way from the service entrance for ice and food deliveries.<eos> I could learn to cook for you, Hermie.
He was a prick.<eos> The world's a better place.<eos> Are we not talking to each other now?<eos> So this was you, was it, during the war?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Happens.<eos> That doesn't make it OK.<eos> Listen, I liked Nevins but he was gonna turn.<eos> Your boyfriend.<eos> He came here for you.
Archer, come on.<eos> You got Sadie's stuff.<eos> Just make sure it gets out.<eos> No.<eos> Archer!<eos> Come relax at our spa with our hot-stone massage...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - You left me.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> When you run, everybody runs.
- We've seen everything after 3:00 yesterday.<eos> Helle Anker's car never passed the tollbooth.<eos> So she was abducted in Sweden.<eos> We must search for the car.<eos> It's done.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hans Pettersson.<eos> I'm the boss here.<eos> Good to meet you.<eos> Lillian has spoken highly of you.
Maybe a little.<eos> - It's Natalie Anker, Helle's wife.<eos> - I know.<eos> What do you want?<eos> It's maybe nothing, but Morten was just here.<eos> He said that he never touched her, but that someone else did it.<eos> - We'll go see him tomorrow.<eos> Good.<eos> Is there anything new?<eos> - Andersen T and L, does it mean anything to you?
- No, why?<eos> - It was there that Helle was killed.<eos> Did Morten or anyone else ever call her heartless?<eos> - Why do you ask?<eos> - Just answer the question.<eos> - Why do you ask?<eos> - Just answer.<eos> Did someone take her heart?<eos> Did someone take her heart?<eos> So Andersen T and L means nothing to you.
Broken down... $1,000, resisting without force,<eos> $1,000 for the D.U.I., and $500 for the expired driver's license.<eos> Raynard Waits.<eos> Is there anything else before me involving Mr. Aronson?<eos> - No, Your Honor.<eos> - That's me.<eos> My name is Ms. Kell. I'm with the public defender's office, and I'll be representing you in this proceeding.<eos> I want to plead not guilty.<eos> Well, you don't enter a plea tonight.<eos> Uh, the prosecutor will read the charges against you, and the judge will ask you if you understand those charges.
Keep this between us, subordinate?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Now, discovery doesn't begin until you enter a plea.<eos> But based on what we know from the arrest report, the preliminary observations by the coroner, and the charging documents, I think we can start formulating a strategy.<eos> Can I get copies of all that?<eos> Uh, I would recommend against it.<eos> You don't want this floating around in jail.<eos> The wrong person gets a look at it, they'll snitch you off in a heartbeat, make it sound like you gave up every detail.<eos> I didn't kill that young man.<eos> A man was found dead - in a vehicle owned and operated by you.
And you, of course.<eos> But mostly me.<eos> Deal with it.<eos> It's like you grabbed a handful of fairy dust and threw it everywhere.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse me, is that a ring I see on your fairy dust hand?<eos> You leave the country for two years and the gays are tying knots.<eos> Call for you, Jackie.<eos> (English accent) Hello, Carrie Roman, MD.<eos> Of course, I remember you, Dr. Roman.
With perfect clarity, Your Majesty.<eos> A solar eclipse is like God putting his hand over the sun.<eos> Can't help being nervous.<eos> There's nothing to be scared of.<eos> I know that.<eos> It's just a feeling.<eos> Protection for your eyes, Your Majesty.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - How wonderful.<eos> Now I can stare at you without being dazzled, Sire.
They can bring each other comfort.<eos> We'll get out of here, all right?<eos> Do you think he means to kill the King?<eos> God knows.<eos> But whatever he wants, he's been planning this for a long time.<eos> Can you move?<eos> Stop!<eos> It's no good.<eos> Can't you Musketeers do anything useful?<eos> Of all the people in all the world, I've got to be chained to you.
I'd follow him to hell if he asked me.<eos> Hell is where you're going for this.<eos> I've been there already, My Lady.<eos> It doesn't frighten me any more.<eos> No matter what you intend to do, please don't hurt my son.<eos> He's an innocent baby.<eos> Innocent now, but what will he be when he's a king?<eos> Get this stuff on the wagons.<eos> NOW!<eos> Let us go free and there'll be another one of these for you.
The King is in terrible danger, but, by all means, let's discuss my moral character. We have all day.<eos> I'll gather the men.<eos> If they see a troop of Musketeers, he will kill the King.<eos> - How many men does he have?<eos> - Ten that I saw.<eos> Possibly more.<eos> - We need to surprise them.<eos> - We?<eos> I know the way in.<eos> - I'll lead you.
Get much worse.<eos> Mr. Gallagher?<eos> How you feeling, Frank?<eos> I've felt better.<eos> I would hope so.<eos> We've started you on Prednisone to decrease the inflammation in your liver, also Lasix to bring down your fluid levels.<eos> You were quite jaundiced when you arrived.<eos> Have you been taking your antirejection meds as prescribed?<eos> My bitch of a newfound daughter hasn't been giving them to me.<eos> Your daughter has been keeping your medications away from you?
That will come.<eos> Are you absolutely sure that he trusts our support?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Lykos can't see what's coming.<eos> I suppose... if he knew we were planning to expose his treason to the court, so that, finally, once and for all, we can bring his mother down, he never would have sent that pigeon.<eos> Indeed.<eos> What about the scribe?<eos> Can we trust him, his lover?<eos> Kimon's love for me outweighs his love for Lykos.<eos> Timing is critical for you, Lord Pallas, to snatch the throne.
You'd better have a good story, or I'll start screaming.<eos> Just let me borrow the tunic, and I promise to come back and tell you everything.<eos> I'm a better king than I am a father.<eos> If you want to open the door to Olympus and become an immortal, you must learn to be both.<eos> Tell us where you've hidden our ring, or we will kill him.<eos> They are the Magi.<eos> Go on... cut me.<eos> Timing is critical for you, Lord Pallas, to snatch the throne.
I am your king!<eos> Let him go.<eos> So, Hero... what did you do?<eos> I made up my mind.<eos> Unless I can find the courage to face this beast myself... I will pass the curse on to my son and destroy my future wife as he destroyed my mother.<eos> I will not do that.<eos> You give yourself willingly?<eos> I do.<eos> Unless you trust me completely, this will not work.<eos> I trust you.
- Just wanna talk to whoever's in charge.<eos> - Shut the fuck up and sit down.<eos> You in charge?<eos> Or just an asshole with a gun?<eos> You in charge?<eos> You just- - Who's in charge?<eos> You got a lot of questions.<eos> A man can't even take a shit without some stranger walking in.<eos> So who the fuck are you?<eos> - I work for you.
I'm Jenna Rose.<eos> He wants me dead.<eos> I'm a sex-starved wife with a half-hidden wild side and an Ivy League husband who's smart enough to see the truth about me.<eos> That's him, isn't it?<eos> You have to say it out loud.<eos> That's the man who hired me to kill Jenna Rose. Thank you.<eos> [Sighs] [Doorbell rings]<eos> Henry Han, you're under arrest for the murder of Jason Rose.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You're coming.<eos> - Uncle Burt, come on.<eos> - We're in a pinch here, Roth.<eos> It's only seven days.<eos> Now gear up.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I really don't believe this.<eos> So I know you don't mind helping your uncle, and the hike's a piece of cake for you, so what's up?<eos> I don't know, Aunt Summer.<eos> I'm not trying to be difficult for you or for Burt.
The wild appetite of Eros?<eos> Your love will rob me of my gift, Majesty.<eos> Yes, the virgin soothsayer.<eos> You're not in the least bit curious about the most divine gift of all?<eos> My passions are sacrificed so that mortal men may see their destiny.<eos> And what is my destiny, aside from your freshly laid snow?<eos> Humiliation.<eos> Humiliation?<eos> What nonsense is this?<eos> Would you like me to look behind the veil and see what the gods have in store for you?
See?<eos> We are alone.<eos> I am indeed fortunate to lose my virginity to one so skilled in the art of love.<eos> What?<eos> I've heard many stories.<eos> Your... reputation is legendary...<eos> The Sabine women, the Nymphs of Amnisus.<eos> Leda and the Swan.<eos> That was Zeus.<eos> But if Zeus is only in my imagination, then I shall replace him with you,
Her face turned white like I had slapped her, and I was so relieved.<eos> I knew that if she's hurt by that, then she's still a girl, and she's still my little girl.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> We're gonna find her, all right?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I made this for you, Charlie.<eos> For me?<eos> That makes me know you love me like I love you.<eos> - What can I do you for?
If you're lucky.<eos> Oh, by the way, Rachel told me to tell you... Mmm.<eos> She really enjoyed talking to you.<eos> Is that right?<eos> It's very interesting, because she spent the whole time crying.<eos> It was cathartic.<eos> Mrs. Gladner, comes to lying, I teach a master class, and you flunk.<eos> Lucky for you, I don't give a rat's ass about drugs.<eos> Double lucky the la Narco Squad couldn't tie a known monkey to a kilo of bananas.<eos> But don't let anybody drop dead near you again, or I'll be on you before the body hits the ground.
All state and local uniforms are on alert.<eos> I'm confident, sir.<eos> He can't hide too long.<eos> And Agent Bennigan where's her head on this?<eos> Well, she hasn't come in.<eos> She hasn't answered her phone.<eos> But if... But if I may be frank, sir...<eos> You think she's a liability.<eos> I think any involvement would be seriously imprudent.<eos> I'm not gonna disagree with you there.
I have you for a 72-hour hold.<eos> I plan on us spending every minute of that together.<eos> Cruel and unusual punishment.<eos> Do you believe in love at first sight?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah. Except it's not love, is it?<eos> You don't know how to love.<eos> You've never loved anything more than yourself.<eos> You'll never have a wife, never have a child.<eos> Look at you.
You know, a ventilation pipe or air shaft.<eos> We should've been looking for graves.<eos> You see, if talia's dead, It doesn't matter how long it takes for us to find her.<eos> But if she's alive, it matters.<eos> She might be running out of air.<eos> So if you tell us Where talia is before she dies, You'll just be charged with kidnapping and you'll live.<eos> But if we dig up your entire property -- And, oh, we will -- and we find her dead, Lethal injection.<eos> If shdies, it's on you.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> I'm me -- worse than you.
No Papers!<eos> Back on the ship.<eos> Goofy Smile, load the prisoner.<eos> Hot Hands, you're with me.<eos> Belay that!<eos> What's the issue?<eos> - It's your new warrant.<eos> And this one ain't optional.<eos> Your daughter's safe for now, Madam Mayor.<eos> She'll come back to you... if my brother walks.
In there. Hey.<eos> Front-door-only access, reinforced walls... not the easiest place to recon...<eos> You wanna make some sketches?<eos> Look, you have your specialties, I have mine.<eos> Breaching a fortified position with opposed entry takes a little finesse.<eos> Scavenger!<eos> Cheeky!<eos> This ought to be interesting.<eos> Keep your hands where I can see 'em, ma'am.<eos> We're not here for you.
- Sir.<eos> Yes, my son?<eos> Is no soldier willing to fight Goliath?<eos> Not now.<eos> I'm not in the mood to have you play the harp for me.<eos> We have urgent business here.<eos> So please leave.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - What is he doing here?<eos> - He played the harp for you once, you don't recall?
That's disgusting!<eos> Have you gone mad?<eos> Come here!<eos> Come back!<eos> Mrs Petek!<eos> Girls!<eos> Mrs Petek's at the market.<eos> Lale!<eos> Mrs Petek!<eos> Do your shit-coloured clothes make you everyone's moral judge?
See?<eos> Yeah. Sure.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Transaction numbers.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> Okay, a business this size would never have so many transactions, so this is how we know there are illegal goings-on.<eos> So, you bought the wheel from the victim?<eos> From his sister, Celia, two weeks ago.<eos> I still have the receipt.<eos> Why would she sell it to you?
You can't tell Ruth.<eos> She's suffered enough.<eos> - Who made the call, Mr. Goldman?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Did you make the call?<eos> - He doesn't want a priest.<eos> - Who made the call?<eos> - He doesn't want a priest.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll pray for you, Mr. Goldman.
You've heard of my son's abduction.<eos> Yes.<eos> Last night, the kidnappers contacted the media.<eos> This morning, they demanded $5 million in ransom.<eos> Don't you think that's strange?<eos> - Could be.<eos> - You've dealt with this thing before.<eos> - Kidnapping.<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, I assume you're too busy saving people from themselves... covering things up, huh?
- get started on the shopping?<eos> Okay, Gin?<eos> - Okay.<eos> You can't guilt me into this, Mom.<eos> I've got business in town.<eos> Henry, she seems lovely. But let her get back to her family.<eos> That's not the business I meant.<eos> - I'm not judging, you know that...<eos> - I know.<eos> Anything goes with you when it comes to that stuff.
C'mon, get in there.<eos> Nora, c'mon.<eos> Alright.<eos> Everybody smile.<eos> Everybody smile.<eos> OK, that's... that's great.<eos> Not big on good-byes, huh?<eos> Not when you've said as many as I have.<eos> Well, good luck getting your book, Professor.<eos> Good luck to you too, Doctor.
We hope to depart within the hour.<eos> Welcome, Professor.<eos> I'm glad to see you made it.<eos> It's gonna be a good time.<eos> But first I'm gonna ask you and your friend here to check all your weapons.<eos> You'll get it back at the end.<eos> Here.<eos> Now, how about a drink?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Alright, I'll have one for you.
Here is my account information, which all will be verified.<eos> - This transaction is much too important.<eos> I will have the honour of acquiring the "Lumen".<eos> Abraham, how ironic that our duel should end not with a fight but with a simple transaction in gold.<eos> I assure you, Eichorst, our duel shall end with a transaction in silver.<eos> So, the Master passed you over for Bolivar.<eos> A third-rate musical act.<eos> Does it hurt at all to be bound by loyalty to one so obviously unimpressed by you?<eos> Four, nine... one...<eos> Does it not pain you to tally all the things that I have taken from you already?

The German's access to the Swiss bank account has been rescinded.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Obviously a mistake has been made.<eos> It's not a mistake.<eos> They checked twice.<eos> Access to the gold account is withdrawn.<eos> Sorry, you're out of luck.<eos> I guess this is yours, old man.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I was rooting for you.
Try me, big boy.<eos> You're lucky I don't shoot you for making me walk through that sewer.<eos> Back off, man.<eos> Just walk away.<eos> I'm talkin' to Mr. Setrakian.<eos> You made a deal, old man.<eos> I'm here to see that you honour it.<eos> Who the hell is this guy, anyway?<eos> Former customer.<eos> I am not giving this book to you, or to the Ancients, or to anyone.

Tell the doctors to do something.<eos> There's nothing to do.<eos> They worked on him.<eos> Well, go t-tell them to do something else.<eos> Doctors say people are dead all the time, and they're not.<eos> Go tell them to do something!<eos> Didn't matter what I confessed to.<eos> You wanted him.<eos> You happy now?<eos> - I'm sorry for you.
- I can do that.<eos> My son is here, too.<eos> - Good. The three of you need to show the judge what kind of family you are...<eos> Good people with strong family values.<eos> You want to wear a dress or a skirt and a blouse with classic lines and your true colors.<eos> Don't wear a suit.<eos> It's too severe.<eos> You're there as a mother.<eos> It makes a difference.<eos> Did it for you?
Nick:<eos> Will you please take your seats?<eos> This is my first meeting.<eos> ( pounds ) What do you do with this?<eos> Any idea?<eos> Here's your Pampers, baby mayor!<eos> Yeah, I'm talking about you!<eos> Man #2: Try this on for size!<eos> Remove him! What are you waiting for?<eos> Mr. Mayor, I think this was meant for you.
Yeah, I'm talking about you!<eos> Man #2: Try this on for size!<eos> Remove him! What are you waiting for?<eos> Mr. Mayor, I think this was meant for you.<eos> - ( cheering ) - Thank you, Hank.<eos> We've had it with what you're doing here!<eos> The hell with you!<eos> Officers, officers, could you please take care of this?<eos> Don't you build those projects!<eos> That's enough of you! - ( gavel pounding )
Okay?<eos> Do you understand?<eos> About 50 protesters from the Save Yonkers Federation greeted New York's Cardinal John O'Connor this afternoon when he rived at the gate of Saint Joseph's Seminary in Dunwoodie.<eos> The group objects to the New York Archdiocese's agreement to give some of the seminary's land to the City of Yonkers for public housing. Woman on TV:<eos> We're urging Catholics all over the city, especially the parishioners of St. John the Baptist, to withhold their donations from the church and from the cardinal's appeal.<eos> He needs to remember who the people are who are in his archdiocese.<eos> Prenatal clinic.<eos> Is there a Doreen Henderson here?<eos> Me.<eos> Nurse: Miss Henderson, I have a call for you.
Yeah, well, the law is the law, and the judge ordered it and the court upheld it and the law's the law.<eos> Well, why can't you say that you think it's wrong?<eos> At least let the people know that.<eos> Because that's not what a leader is supposed to do.<eos> A leader is supposed to lead, and that's what I'm trying to do.<eos> You threw me out of the last council meeting.<eos> Which one were you?<eos> I have gray salt-and-pepper hair. I have-- wear glasses.<eos> I was standing right at the railing.<eos> Yeah, I remember you.
- I haven't been in their homes, but I've driven them home up in, uh, Runyon Heights.<eos> So, it's not about race?<eos> No, no.<eos> What is it, then?<eos> It's an economic issue.<eos> People are worried about their property values.<eos> They're worried about the drugs and crime that are in the projects.<eos> Have you seen those pictures that Councilman Spallone has?<eos> Yeah, I heard about them.<eos> But does Mr. Spallone speak for you?
Maybe that'll change some minds.<eos> What about the Supremes? What do you think?<eos> Don't hold your breath.<eos> - All right.<eos> That's something. - Yeah.<eos> MAN: Oh, here's the baby mayor.<eos> Wasicsko!<eos> Hey, hey, hey- No, Pete. It's all right.<eos> Let them come.<eos> Hey, what can I do for you?
I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, that's 'cause you're gutless.<eos> I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> What's your name?<eos> - Oh, like you care.<eos> - Bobby.<eos> Bobby Amalfitano.<eos> - I live over on Nevada Avenue.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And I voted for you.
I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> What's your name?<eos> - Oh, like you care.<eos> - Bobby.<eos> Bobby Amalfitano.<eos> - I live over on Nevada Avenue.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And I voted for you.<eos> - We all voted for you.<eos> I trusted you.
- I live over on Nevada Avenue.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And I voted for you.<eos> - We all voted for you.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> Thank you for your vote, Bobby.<eos> Now explain to me what I've done to let you down.<eos> Explain to you what you've done to let me down.<eos> - Are you serious? - You ran against the housing, and we thought you'd fight for us.<eos> - We believed you.
Nobody sensible would ever put themselves through this.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> HANK: This question of individual right is being trampled on by an unfairjudge.<eos> Judge Sand's this...<eos> (SCOFFS) This philosopher king.<eos> Now it's time we restored - the people's government to Yonkers.<eos> - (SCATTERED APPLAUSE) And I promise you, I will continue to appeal against this off-the-wall judge's decision to the Supreme Court, and I will unconditionally oppose construction of public housing.<eos> We've all seen what this mayor has done.<eos> It's time you recognized your failure as a leader.<eos> And if the good people of Yonkers vote for you again... - MODERATOR: Time.
Oh, am I-- sorry to disturb you.<eos> No, no. Oscar, please come in.<eos> I want you to meet Bob Mayhawk.<eos> I was telling you about his program.<eos> - You're the consultant.<eos> - As are you. I'm an admirer of most of what you've done with these housing units.<eos> The emphasis on ownership and personal responsibility is essential here.<eos> We're gonna start with that.<eos> I'd better go brief my team.<eos> The only thing I'll need from you will be a list of the most vocal opponents to the housing.
I'd be pissed off, too.<eos> This shit is no oversight, okay?<eos> I've paid more politically for that housing than he'll ever know, but Terry Zaleski wants the credit all to himself.<eos> Today I need a tall fucking drink.<eos> I'll buy.<eos> Good, it's about time you pulled out that fat, Republican wallet.<eos> What?<eos> "You have been selected for the opportunity to move into the new housing and have been assigned a handicapped apartment."<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - "Congratulations to you and your family.
Nah, I don't know anything about that.<eos> You got the wrong unit.<eos> He-- hello, ma'am. I'm so sorry to bother you.<eos> Uh, my name is Nick Wasicsko.<eos> I was the mayor when these houses were approved, and I just-<eos> - I was in the neighborhood, and I just wanted to see how the residents were doing here.<eos> - What'd you say your name was? - Wasicsko.<eos> Nick Wasicsko.<eos> Yes.<eos> I remember you.
On the chocolate part.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Don't report me.<eos> Desperate measures.<eos> They finally called back.<eos> And?<eos> Evidently it was too late.<eos> What do you mean too late?<eos> Ms. Person said the deal had already gone through.<eos> I got a call for you, Sheriff.
We got our man, Sondra.<eos> Holden admitted it.<eos> Twice now.<eos> If you want to delve into that girl's reputation or the reputation of a now-middle-aged family man, do so at your own peril.<eos> Is that a threat, Senator?<eos> Hardly.<eos> I'm done here.<eos> As they say, I feel complete.<eos> The peril I'm speaking of, Madam District Attorney, goes with the territory of your job and the territory of where you do your job.<eos> Is there still peril for you here, Senator?
I don't really have context yet, Jon.<eos> Okay.<eos> Would this be considered a shitty view?<eos> Within the norm of shitty views?<eos> To me, it qualifies.<eos> I'm still outside the norm, then.<eos> You are that, buddy.<eos> You have to report to Nashville probation in four days.<eos> Understood.<eos> How's the view for you now, Mr. Stern?
He can't get down there, Trey.<eos> The river's too high.<eos> I'm telling you, that is where George was at...<eos> Right there... and his gun.<eos> We'll just have to wait till the river goes down to come back.<eos> Oh, that'll take a while.<eos> Like finding a needle in a haystack anyhow.<eos> Trey Willis, you're under arrest for the murder of George Melton.<eos> You have the right to remain silent. Jesus, Carl!<eos> Anything you say can and will be held against you...
I'm afraid I'd only step on your toes.<eos> Another time, perhaps.<eos> Oh, no, we're supposed to be upstairs.<eos> I'm looking for Mr. Raymond.<eos> I have something I'd like to sell.<eos> First door on the right.<eos> Thanks, sugar.<eos> Mr. Raymond, is this a bad time?<eos> We'll only know after it's over.<eos> Bring the rest of you in here.
I want you to meet her real quick.<eos> She's a fabulous publicist.<eos> I got two minutes, so make it fast.<eos> Where's the capers?<eos> I asked for capers on the damn bagel.<eos> Um, Dominique, this is Cookie Lyon.<eos> She's my mother-in-law. Lucious Lyon's ex-wife.<eos> (laughing): Oh, Cookie.<eos> It's amazing to meet you.<eos> I've read all about you.
Um, Dominique, this is Cookie Lyon.<eos> She's my mother-in-law. Lucious Lyon's ex-wife.<eos> (laughing): Oh, Cookie.<eos> It's amazing to meet you.<eos> I've read all about you.<eos> I love your pumps.<eos> (gasps) They're fabulous.<eos> Oh, thank you, sister girl.<eos> Sister girl.<eos> (laughing) I love you.

He's doing all the work for us.<eos> ...the joke's on y'all 'cause Barack Obama ain't nothing but a sellout. It's gone viral.<eos> What's viral?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That's what they said on the news.<eos> Oh, so the po po comin' to shoot me now?<eos> There ain't nothing funny about that.<eos> It is funny.<eos> Mr. President, I am so, so sorry.<eos> You know how he feels about you.
And our target?<eos> Missing.<eos> The remaining sisters have all gone underground.<eos> They won't even reply to The Nine.<eos> If she won't talk to her employers, then how are we supposed to find her?<eos> With a little help from our friends.<eos> _<eos> Where's your I.D., scarback?<eos> Enjoying your work, Officer?<eos> I'll be praying for you tonight.
- My lady was very clear.<eos> - We have a valid Rack warrant.<eos> Which is why your ship is still intact.<eos> Get back on board or I'll splatter this grass with gray matter.<eos> - That's a bit extreme. - I liked it.<eos> Felt like it came from a real place.<eos> We're just here to drop off some precious cargo.<eos> Delle Seyah Kendry, of Land Kendry may I introduce the latest Qreshi citizen.<eos> Trueborn, on mother soil.<eos> Your soil. Thanks to you, the Lahani line lives on.
The warrant was technically sabotaged by an agent either too stupid or too arrogant to know her place.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> I don't give two wet shits they canceled the warrant.<eos> The Company was the client.<eos> You work for us.<eos> That means you play by RAC rules.<eos> Understood.<eos> We are a single body, with no allegiance to anyone but ourselves.<eos> We offer one simple service to all of our clients.<eos> We will cross contested jurisdictions for you, find who or what you're looking for, and bring it back to you in the condition requested.
- Killjoy.<eos> On an official warrant.<eos> Well, I guess the migrant worker that broke in here and attacked you was too stupid to know any better.<eos> Pity about the blood on my nice rugs.<eos> Do it.<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> How about your rug, your blood?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I wanted a holiday.<eos> I have a lot I'm dealing with right now, so unless you want me to vent my frustration by frying the crap outta you, tell me: where's my partner?
- Who put out the warrant?<eos> - N'oa.<eos> His wife. You remember her?<eos> - I didn't know she cared so much.<eos> - She kinda has to.<eos> She co-signed your work-contract.<eos> If you go AWOL, she does your time... and I'm not gonna let that happen.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm not going back to Westerley.<eos> N'oa should have made better choices.<eos> Now I gotta get rid of you.
What is this?<eos> I wouldn't try to... the battery's dead.<eos> I think my niece has one.<eos> It's neat.<eos> I can...<eos> -yeah, I'll take that.<eos> -Thanks Martha. It was really great.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, I cleaned it for you.
So dark, and so mysterious. Yet, still real.<eos> I don't even know why we broke up.<eos> Can't imagine why.<eos> "Say hello to my little friend."<eos> You like that?<eos> You think you're so tough?<eos> She's looking at me over there. -Yeah. -She doesn't like that one.<eos> I... no, no, no, no.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Nothing against you.
That was just for...<eos> Actually, those two guys might have been gay.<eos> -Yeah, I think they were gay. -Yeah.<eos> Hey, Ronnie. I got it.<eos> -Eat your sandwich.<eos> -Hey.<eos> -Hey.<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> I came in about a month ago. Yeah.<eos> Definitely remember you.
Natalie!<eos> At this rate, you're gonna run out of people to accuse.<eos> Dave's a jackass, not a pervert.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> You've known him since high school.<eos> People change.<eos> So, he did it, just like that?<eos> Mrs. Crawford.<eos> I was just starting to miss you.<eos> Shame, I'm not here for you.
She apologized for everything.<eos> She didn't say a damn thing. Clammed up the minute Cornell walked out.<eos> Do you think... is Nat a suspect?<eos> No.<eos> I'm pretty sure Cornell's just screwing with me.<eos> Again.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna find out what else our daughter lied about.<eos> Scott Murphy's been cleared by police for Tom's murder.<eos> Have you?
Maybe I am.<eos> Someday you'll tell me that story.<eos> Right after you tell me the story about those.<eos> Well, those are, uh, mine.<eos> It's just...<eos> There's...<eos> I don't care about your past.<eos> Everybody on the Cant is hiding from something.<eos> Yeah, I appreciate the offer, Cap.<eos> Hey, boss, we need you out here.
- Purge the logs.<eos> We never received that signal.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> Little lost daughter case.<eos> So what's my contract exactly?<eos> Find Julie Mao. If she's still here on Ceres, detain her and ship her home.<eos> Kidnap job.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Anybody grew up this far from the sun won't give a good goddamn what planet you're from.<eos> Real sky over your head and real gravity holding you on the ground, they don't trust you.
You'll get there.<eos> _<eos> Is it true that you had a Belter up on hooks for 20 hours?<eos> He's an O.P.A. smuggler and a terrorist.<eos> The Secretary-General...<eos> He didn't want to talk...<eos> The Secretary-General has publicly disavowed gravity torture.<eos> If you want to talk to that Belter, you put him in the tank.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> I've heard of you, yes.
It's worse.<eos> Captain was pissed you weren't around.<eos> She wanted this dealt with.<eos> Yeah, it must be my week.<eos> New Earth partner.<eos> Drawing all the "hot" cases...<eos> Your attention, please.<eos> The Air, Water and Power...<eos> Well, it's about time.<eos> Expected you an hour ago.
- Go!<eos> - Pressurizing.<eos> What the hell did you do to me?<eos> You saved my hide, partner.<eos> You crazy son of a bitch.<eos> Ah, no problem.<eos> I need him sent to Luna for deeper interrogations.<eos> Let the team here go another round, they'll break him.<eos> They have a budget, it's already shot to hell.<eos> And unlike you, I have to grovel and promise and deliver to get reappointed.
What?<eos> Two advanced degrees in fusion drive design.<eos> You never wondered why someone of such obvious intelligence was wasting her life sealing cracks and fixing gauges on an ancient, crumbling ice hauler?<eos> I never asked.<eos> Based on the desperate condition of your shuttle, it clearly required extraordinary improvisational expertise for you and your crew members simply to survive, let alone restore your antenna array.<eos> These are the hallmark skill sets of terrorists.<eos> Did Naomi Nagata effectuate those repairs?<eos> It's not impossible, is it?<eos> Naomi's not OPA.<eos> I don't believe you.
Have I answered all your questions, Detective?<eos> You haven't answered any of my questions.<eos> You took a young, naive, rich girl with daddy issues. Stop.<eos> And got inside her head... Stop.<eos> Now I'm getting choked up.<eos> Other than the money, what do you care?<eos> You didn't know her.<eos> Nah.<eos> But you did.<eos> I'll ask around for you.
The Nauvoo's engines have all been tested and certified, and we've been able to continue laying down the hull at the same time.<eos> Which means, everything is proceeding on schedule and on budget, which I'm sure you're pleased to hear.<eos> Mr. Johnson.<eos> The Latter Day Saints took a considerable risk hiring you to build the Nauvoo.<eos> I know.<eos> Tycho spins up asteroids.<eos> We don't build ships, not till now.<eos> But trust me, it'll be a ship no one will ever forget.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> I meant you.
I can't give you any details, but just use your imagination, all right?<eos> I know you can be a devious son of a bitch when you want to be.<eos> I'd do the same for you.<eos> Oh shit! Shit!<eos> I'll get help!<eos> Somebody help!<eos> This officer needs help!<eos> Help me!<eos> Let go.<eos> Don't make me shoot you.
If only that company could be Will Graham.<eos> Is Will Graham still alive?<eos> Will was not a suitable substitute for therapy.<eos> What have you done, Hannibal?<eos> Abigail...<eos> I didn't know what else to do, so...<eos> I just did what he told me.<eos> Where is he?<eos> You were supposed to leave.<eos> We couldn't leave without you.
I knew.<eos> It was the best moment of my life.<eos> A moment of epiphany that made me famous and then ruined me.<eos> In the haste and the heat of ambition, the Questura nearly destroyed the young man's home, trying to find evidence.<eos> - He doesn't leave evidence.<eos> - No, he doesn't. He eats it.<eos> Another man, not an innocent man, but innocent of those crimes, was a dream suspect.<eos> He was convicted on no evidence except his character.<eos> Blame has a habit of not sticking to Hannibal Lecter.<eos> It has a habit of sticking to you.
Hannibal doesn't pray.<eos> But he believes in God.<eos> Intimately.<eos> I wasn't asking Hannibal Lecter.<eos> I think my prayers would feel constricted by the saints and the apostles<eos> and Jesus Pantocrator.<eos> How do your prayers feel?<eos> I hope my prayers escaped, flown from here to the open sky and God.<eos> Praying you catch him?<eos> You should be praying he doesn't capture you.
I...<eos> I can't see.<eos> Technically, you killed him.<eos> No longer interested in preserving the peace you found here?<eos> You cannot preserve entropy.<eos> It gradually descends into disorder.<eos> Two men from the Capponi are dead.<eos> I can only claim one.<eos> Technically.<eos> You're drawing them to you, aren't you?
I understand why he's done it.<eos> Mischa doesn't explain Hannibal.<eos> She doesn't quantify what he does.<eos> He does what was done to her.<eos> How do you know it was your prisoner who killed Mischa?<eos> Hannibal told me so.<eos> Hannibal took someone from you.<eos> Are you here to take someone from him?<eos> If I were like Hannibal I would've killed you already.<eos> Cooked you, ate you and fed what was left of you to him.
Cooked you, ate you and fed what was left of you to him.<eos> That's what he would do.<eos> You've given that some thought.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> Why are you looking for him after he left you with a smile?<eos> I've never known myself as well as I know myself... when I'm with him.<eos> You won't find Hannibal here.<eos> There are places on these grounds he cannot safely go.<eos> Bad memories.<eos> What do these grounds hold for you?
I'm sorry.<eos> You did this.<eos> You set him free.<eos> It was you I wanted to set free.<eos> You said Hannibal was curious if I would kill.<eos> You were curious, too.<eos> - I didn't want this.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> You were doing what he does.<eos> He'd be proud of you, his nakama.
This is exactly how he intended me to live.<eos> I know somewhere Dr. Lecter is going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it, and very likely having a good, fun time.<eos> How do you relieve the agony of waiting for Dr. Lecter's capture?<eos> What do you fantasize about? I wonder what would happen if Hannibal Lecter was in your hands.<eos> I worry we're heading into territory not secured by your fee.<eos> I think I need to look elsewhere for somebody to tend to my emotional well-being.<eos> Good-bye, Dr. Chilton.<eos> Happy hunting.<eos> You were supposed to leave.<eos> We couldn't leave without you.
He set us up and knocked us down.<eos> What bothers me the most is, I think it was easy for him.<eos> Shooting monkeys in a barrel.<eos> You had encephalitis.<eos> I do not know what my excuse was.<eos> Compulsive imitation.<eos> How dull!<eos> But maybe.<eos> I am learning all sorts of new things about myself these days.<eos> I'm learning new things about you, too.
Shooting monkeys in a barrel.<eos> You had encephalitis.<eos> I do not know what my excuse was.<eos> Compulsive imitation.<eos> How dull!<eos> But maybe.<eos> I am learning all sorts of new things about myself these days.<eos> I'm learning new things about you, too.<eos> Imitation allows us to better understand the behavior of others.<eos> I have great empathy for you, Will.
We have matching scars.<eos> You need a friend... friend.<eos> You will leave this hospital under a cloud of suspicion.<eos> Not a cloud, a fog.<eos> I can help you get Hannibal Lecter out of your head.<eos> And into your hospital.<eos> There's opportunity here... For both of us.<eos> We can catch the man who framed and maimed us.<eos> There's no opportunity here, Frederick.<eos> Not for you.
You say that like I broke them.<eos> You got yourself to the window, Dr. Bloom, if not through it.<eos> They told me a lot of marrow got into my blood and that I should expect to find myself thinking differently.<eos> Hallelujah!<eos> I do not mean to kick you when you are down.<eos> I'm just reminding you how you got down.<eos> And who I'm down with.<eos> We could all use a little group therapy while we're down here.<eos> There's only one "we"<eos> you're really interested in, Frederick, and that "we" isn't really interested in you.
It was my salvation.<eos> Have you accepted Jesus, Dr. Bloom? Do you have faith?<eos> I was raised in a religious atmosphere, Mr. Verger, but whatever that left me with, it's not religion.<eos> Left me with more.<eos> You see, I'm free, Dr. Bloom.<eos> I'm right with the Risen Jesus and it's all OK now.<eos> And nobody beats the Riz.<eos> He will rise me up and smite mine enemies and I shall hear the lamentations of their women.<eos> That was once you, I'm told.<eos> Dr. Lecter got deeper inside you than he did any of us.
It's as though Hannibal Lecter has dropped off the earth.<eos> Hannibal obviously has good papers and money.<eos> Europe is where a man of his tastes would settle.<eos> Well, his tastes are very specific.<eos> And that's how you'll find him.<eos> - The wine, the truffles...<eos> Taste in all things will be a constant between Dr. Lecter's lives.<eos> His name will change, but his taste will not.<eos> Of course you know what he would favour.<eos> Tell me, Dr. Bloom, does he favour you?
And that's how you'll find him.<eos> - The wine, the truffles...<eos> Taste in all things will be a constant between Dr. Lecter's lives.<eos> His name will change, but his taste will not.<eos> Of course you know what he would favour.<eos> Tell me, Dr. Bloom, does he favour you?<eos> I think I amused him.<eos> Things either amuse him or they don't.<eos> Well, you didn't.<eos> Do you feel he ever genuinely cared for you?
I've waited my whole life to breathe fresh air.<eos> That's Emerson.<eos> Let's get back to this secret army that she claims to have.<eos> She tell you anything that might help us find it?<eos> Stop drilling, please.<eos> The window for extraction after death is incredibly short.<eos> I only need a minute.<eos> No, sir.<eos> Nothing about the army.<eos> She did say she was coming for you and that if we let her people go she'll let our people live.
Emori was telling the truth.<eos> We are so close.<eos> You wanted a sign?<eos> There it is.<eos> We have to push forward.<eos> What about the mines?<eos> We were meant to be here, John.<eos> These mines, they're just another test of our faith.<eos> Yeah, well, I was always crap at tests, so... please.<eos> After you, Chancellor.
We're the good guys here, not you.<eos> Tell me, if we released your people and theirs, what would've happened to mine?<eos> Can you get us into the command center?<eos> We need to see what's happening on level 5.<eos> - No problem.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> You're gonna help us, whether you like it or not.<eos> That's...<eos> John, let me help you.<eos> I don't want anything from you.
No, sir, this is Elon Musk.<eos> For some reason, he's sharing a console with Homer Simpson.<eos> His mind is as rich as an Italian wedding soup.<eos> Homer, what are you thinking now?<eos> Uh, Pittsburgh 35, Dallas 31!<eos> Pittsburgh steel, Dallas Cowboys...<eos> Robotic cattle herding!<eos> Thank you, Homer.<eos> Sorry, that's something I'm working on so that I don't have to display facial expressions.<eos> Young man, I look at you and I see myself.
- Beth Mackey?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> John Rayburn.<eos> You guys don't look anything alike.<eos> Oh, we take after different sides of the family.<eos> How do I know you're his brother?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How's that?<eos> John Rayburn.<eos> Yeah, he talked about you.
Just wait here for me, okay?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I give you a key piece of evidence, and you're not interested?<eos> A blue jacket with a blood stain...<eos> I'm very interested.<eos> Now, I don't know how Matt got it, but I'd assume that the jacket would have Tom's killer's DNA on it.<eos> - Was this your jacket?<eos> - What? !<eos> How do you know Tom's killer had a blue jacket?<eos> From you!
You didn't even know he was in the river.<eos> Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> My mom is doing the best she can.<eos> If she says that Matt wasn't with Tom, then he wasn't.<eos> Like she said that you weren't home?<eos> Yeah, that's about me, not Tom.<eos> - Tyler, don't.<eos> - No, enough!<eos> And I know about the rehab.<eos> Good for you!
I think you're losing your mind.<eos> It was raining the night Tom was killed.<eos> So?<eos> According to Lisa Daly, you know that Matt is terrified of the rain.<eos> He hates the way it feels pelting his skin.<eos> If it's raining, he won't go outside.<eos> That's your proof?<eos> Rain?<eos> And Matt's GPS bracelet has him at home in bed when Tom was killed.<eos> That good enough for you?
That swill they bring me, hardly fit for the mother of the king.<eos> I wouldn't know. I don't eat.<eos> If you please, I have my orders.<eos> Oh, you poor dear man.<eos> Guthre, is it?<eos> Terrified of displeasing him, aren't you?<eos> I know how my son can be.<eos> You're all scared spitless.<eos> Still, a boy listens to his mom.<eos> I'd be happy to put in a good word for you.
The great Castiel never stoops to such selfishness.<eos> So, what is it, then?<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> I'm betting you didn't tell Ingrid about him.<eos> Hello. Sam.<eos> Here to kill me?<eos> Lovely room.<eos> It's where you bring the kinky chicks, am I right?<eos> I'll ask the questions here.<eos> You. Your only job is to provide information.
Screw the Mark, let's just kill him.<eos> Boy, he really is a mess.<eos> Who knew the Mark was so toxic?<eos> Well, actually, I did.<eos> You know it is going to own you sooner than later.<eos> Yes, so how do we get rid of it?<eos> What, just like that? Social hour's over?<eos> Yes, and now we're moving on to our keynote speaker.<eos> Which is you.<eos> With us asking the questions. And me taking the personal pleasure of carving the answers out of you. Just-
The Blade might be powered down, but the Mark is not.<eos> I'm doing everything I can to keep it together.<eos> You think the body count is high right now?<eos> Wait till Hal takes over.<eos> We figure you stashed the Blade somewhere--<eos> Damn right.<eos> It's in a crypt with my bones.<eos> All right, well?<eos> I hate Guam this time of year.<eos> And why is this imperial communique coming through you?
I've got it.<eos> That's good to hear.<eos> Of course, I'm gonna hang onto to it... until you work out how to get that thing off your arm.<eos> I'm guessing you're not here to reminisce.<eos> All right, we did what you said.<eos> We have the First Blade.<eos> Not here?<eos> Not on your person.<eos> Not saying.<eos> So back to you.
They threatened me both verbally and physically.<eos> So... you say you... didn't know or have never met Mr... Prohaszka<eos> - prior to last night?<eos> - No... but I do regret any injurious consequences my actions may have caused.<eos> You have quite the legal vocabulary, Mr. Healy.<eos> Am I right in assuming this isn't your first rodeo?<eos> I had issues.<eos> I'm better now.<eos> On second thought...<eos> Mr. Healy, uh... perhaps our firm isn't the right fit for you.
Another chit in our favor.<eos> Plus Healy's pretty banged up.<eos> Argue defensive wounds, which makes it look more like a fight and less like an execution.<eos> So, you open, I'll sum up.<eos> And we should cash that check, have Karen see what she can find out about Confederated Global.<eos> Right.<eos> Where the hell is she?<eos> It's a fairly simple form.<eos> Here you agree, in writing, to never again disclose information regarding your former employer, the dissolved entity known as Union Allied Construction, or any of its affiliates.<eos> Upon execution of this agreement, the corporate interests, as they currently exist, agree not to pursue legal action against you.
Everybody did.<eos> Not everyone broke that agreement and distributed confidential information.<eos> I...<eos> I exposed criminal activity.<eos> And had you taken that information to any law enforcement agency, your rights may have been protected, but instead... you went to the New York Bulletin, a privately-owned news organization.<eos> I had nothing to do with that article.<eos> So the file you illegally removed from the premises of Union Allied wasn't the same one Mr. Urich refers to in this?<eos> You see how this complicates things, yes?<eos> Daniel Fisher was murdered and your clients...<eos> I assure you that any illegal activity associated with Union Allied has been dealt with, thanks very much to you.
You're welcome.<eos> If you'd like, you can take these to your own representatives, but I'm fairly certain they'll advise you to sign it.<eos> And as a show of good faith, my clients would like to offer you a lump sum of six months' salary.<eos> For what?<eos> For all your help in the matter and for any stress these events may have caused.<eos> Stress?<eos> Someone tried to kill me.<eos> And while my clients acknowledge no involvement with that individual or claim legal responsibility for his actions, they do feel it's their non-binding moral obligation to offer you a chance at rebuilding your life.<eos> As long as I keep my mouth shut?<eos> It's a clean slate, Miss Page... a chance to put it all behind you.
Hit him again!<eos> Gimme a chocolate glaze and... and a... an ole fashion.<eos> An ole-- an ole fa-- an ole fashion.<eos> Come on. Get some zip in ya.<eos> It's on them.<eos> Well, it's a war.<eos> Nixon declared it.<eos> The war on cancer.<eos> As long as it's not a war on me.<eos> No, no, it's not a war against you.
Hold up.<eos> Who's the dumbass?<eos> Go around to the passenger seat.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Well, what's the holdup?<eos> Think maybe I flooded it.<eos> Take him inside!<eos> Joe Bulo says hi.<eos> Your counter has been rejected, and now we're lowering our price by $2 million.<eos> But because I respect you and your family, I'm gonna give you the night to think it over.
Not sure how it falls to us.<eos> Ma'am we found the murder weapon at the scene.<eos> Prints came back this morning.<eos> And?<eos> We're gonna have to talk to Rye.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> Mrs. Gerhardt, if either of these men draw, I'm gonna be forced to shoot some people, and I don't want to do that.<eos> Now, your son's wanted in connection with three murders.<eos> And I'm guessing that's not the first time you heard somebody say that, so however it is you want to handle this, you need to handle it now, or it'll get handled for you.
The resurrection.<eos> It's like why everyone loves Rocky, even though it's a boxing' picture.<eos> The comeback.<eos> Except, he loses in the end.<eos> Well, now you ruined it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Just kiddin'.<eos> Oh, here's Ed now.<eos> Sorry, was just in the middle of a hog.<eos> So, what can I do you for?
These, too.<eos> Yep, just you and the moose.<eos> Yeah. Just us and the moose.<eos> Going crazy down there, to be honest.<eos> I bet.<eos> How about a pack of cards?<eos> Just 39 cents.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> You know what? On the house.<eos> For you and the missus.
That's real good.<eos> Uh, meet me in Sioux Falls tomorrow morning, 8:00.<eos> There's a motel off the interstate here.<eos> Motor Motel, I think.<eos> It's two stories.<eos> 8:00 AM.<eos> Yeah, and no funny business, either, you hear?<eos> 'Cause I've killed people before, and I'm not afraid to do it again.<eos> Maybe you heard of me-- the Butcher of Luverne.<eos> I have heard of you. And may I say, brother, I like your style.
They shot him in his own home.<eos> These Kansas City hosenscheisser.<eos> Children sleeping' upstairs-- savages.<eos> My wife passed last summer.<eos> We were up in Brainerd, visiting' my sister.<eos> Last thing she said to me--<eos> "Do you smell toast?"<eos> Different roads, same destination.<eos> I suppose.<eos> But the question is-- for you, I mean-- how far does it go?
♪ I once ♪<eos> ♪ Was lost ♪<eos> ♪ But now ♪<eos> ♪ I'm found ♪<eos> ♪ Was blind ♪<eos> ♪ But now ♪<eos> ♪ I see. ♪<eos> Peter Moore, you're under arrest for the murder of Sam Murphy.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
The image is... disturbing.<eos> And I've been trying to understand what...<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Because if you really need some help,<eos> - let me refer you to someone. - I'm here because you're my sister!<eos> And I need your help.<eos> So, later today, you will be extradited back to Arkansas.<eos> As your attorney, I strongly recommend that you plead guilty to the murder charge.<eos> Hear me out.<eos> In the face of the overwhelming evidence against you, I believe it's the most prudent thing to just...
Lifelong depression, suicide attempt, rejected from foster home after foster home.<eos> What does that have to do with any of this?<eos> Anger issues, too.<eos> Look, my point is, it all paints a very sad story which should help garner sympathy from the DA.<eos> I'm hoping I can talk them down to 30 years.<eos> 30 years?<eos> If this goes to trail, you can get life.<eos> You killed someone, Peter.<eos> There's no getting around that.<eos> It's part of you now.
I'm here now.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're safe.<eos> There's no danger anymore.<eos> Just relax.<eos> I'm sure you are mistaken, Miss Kortus.<eos> The Colonia Dignidad is a long established and completely respectable enterprise.<eos> With full government approval.<eos> We here at Amnesty International have no further information.<eos> If I were you, I'd stay in touch with your embassy.
Yes.<eos> You're an attractive woman.<eos> You must have a boyfriend.<eos> Someone who loves you.<eos> No.<eos> I want to follow the way of the Lord.<eos> You're not telling the truth.<eos> I can see it in your eyes.<eos> I see it in your soul.<eos> Is Satan inside you?
Take off you apron.<eos> Take off you apron.<eos> Open your blouse.<eos> Open your blouse.<eos> Just what I thought.<eos> Gray rags on the outside, the instruments of the harlot beneath.<eos> I smell the beast of hell.<eos> Did you touch yourself?<eos> No.<eos> Is Satan inside you?
No.<eos> Do you renounce Satan, the beast of hell?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you renounce the sins of the flesh?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you renounce all lies and deceit?<eos> Yes!<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I'm here for you Pius.
Do you renounce Satan, the beast of hell?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you renounce the sins of the flesh?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you renounce all lies and deceit?<eos> Yes!<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I'm here for you Pius.<eos> I need you, that's why.
I don't see a frigging crown on her head.<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> You're not the queen of the witches.<eos> You don't speak for all of them.<eos> You know, I can't believe I dressed up and learned how to play Beethoven.<eos> I hate Beethoven.<eos> And what do you like, young lady?<eos> If not for Beethoven, then what?<eos> Eddie South.<eos> That makes you a true jazz girl.
I much prefer vampire blood, but after so long a slumber, one needn't be so picky.<eos> I believe this belongs to one of your mangy spies.<eos> Klaus is gonna kill you.<eos> Is... that... so?<eos> Leave him, father.<eos> Bloodshed is merely a distraction.<eos> We have important matters to attend to.<eos> Thank you.<eos> One of the witches that escaped the Fauline cottage is of particular importance to my family.<eos> My request to you...
Normally, I could listen to it all day long, but I grow tired of this.<eos> My mind remains unchanged.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> She puts on a talent show, he has every vampire in the quarter kissing you ass, and your final answer is "screw you"?<eos> - Hayley.<eos> - Back off.<eos> We came here to honor the alliance between us.<eos> If this is something you wish to rescind, so be it.<eos> Don't you dare walk into my house and threaten me.<eos> I am not the one that needs you, Elijah Mikaelson.
So how does this work?<eos> Do we vote?<eos> Has the jury reached a verdict?<eos> It has.<eos> - Guilty.<eos> - I guess that means no, then.<eos> You were expecting something different?<eos> What, that you'd have some measure of common sense?<eos> Yes.<eos> You really thought we'd thrown in with you.
- I guess that means no, then.<eos> You were expecting something different?<eos> What, that you'd have some measure of common sense?<eos> Yes.<eos> You really thought we'd thrown in with you.<eos> After what you did to Thea, to Sara, to Oliver.<eos> - To save your precious city, yes. - Well, that's the thing.<eos> Once we let the ends justify the means that's just the first step.<eos> Towards what?<eos> Becoming you.
- What happened to your face?<eos> - Is it all there?<eos> Yeah, 50,000 in hundreds.<eos> You went after Kendrick Weller.<eos> What did you do?<eos> You killed him. And now you're running?<eos> We can... We can cover this up.<eos> I can't stay here.<eos> I can't pretend to be something that I'm not.<eos> - Your son needs you. - Not like this.
- Any luck finding Oliver? - Not yet.<eos> But I have every reconnaissance satellite I could hack looking for him.<eos> So the second he steps outside, we'll know.<eos> If he steps outside.<eos> - It's what we were all thinking.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> It's only been three days.<eos> I have to head to my other office for a bit.<eos> Okay, I know it's only been three days but how much longer before we actually have to start worrying?<eos> I expected this kind of blunder from Mr. Queen, but not from you.
Together, not only will we make a lot of money we will make history.<eos> Together, we are gonna take over the Glades.<eos> You think Brick's crazy?<eos> Take over a whole section of town?<eos> I know he's crazy.<eos> I don't know what he's got planned, but whatever it is, I'm in.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm the justice you can't run from.<eos> Well done, Mr. Queen.<eos> I'm glad to know my investment in you hasn't entirely been for naught.
- She'll be fine.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Because you, Diggle and Felicity are gonna take her home and she will recover.<eos> - Felicity...<eos> - No, this is wrong.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> What is happening here is perverse.<eos> What you're doing to Oliver what you're making him do, I'm not going to let it happen.<eos> You can leave us.<eos> You have a great fire within you.
- I can't ask you to come with me.<eos> - You didn't ask me.<eos> Besides, you don't own a jet anymore.<eos> In 1854, I encountered an illusionist in Vienna and he was dazzling, magnificent, powerful.<eos> And then, nearly half a century later, I stumbled upon this man again.<eos> He was withered broken dyifl9-<eos> You see, a magician can cheat many things, except one.<eos> Please.<eos> I was your horseman.<eos> Let me hunt for you once more.
I expect you to marry Al Sah-him because it is my will.<eos> You defy that and I will see you suffer the pain of a thousand deaths.<eos> I am sorry to intrude.<eos> Mr. Merlyn said that I would find you here.<eos> That might be the only thing he's ever said that isn't a lie.<eos> I did not come here to convince you of the threat to your home.<eos> There is nothing I can say that you will believe, more than what you have seen.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> To speak with you about Oliver.<eos> During his recuperation, Oliver spoke of you.

You had nothing to offer then and you have nothing to offer now.<eos> I have the name of the person who betrayed you to Al Sah-him's friends.<eos> It wasn't Maseo Yamashiro, it was Oliver Queen.<eos> Heh. He's been lying to you all along.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - I'm sorry, Oliver.<eos> - My name is Al Sah-him.<eos> - Not according to Mr. Merlyn here.<eos> You see, he claims that you've been deceiving me the entire time.<eos> I have killed for you. I have severed all ties to my past. I have hurt people who were friends to Oliver Queen.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Sorry to interfere with your wedding night.<eos> Yeah, I doubt that.<eos> Five hours ago, there was a terrorist attack in the Republic of Kaznia.<eos> Hospital was supposed to serve and unite Kaznia's dissident ethnic faction.<eos> Wait, is that... Senator Joseph Cray.<eos> This hospital was something of a pet project for him.<eos> Of course, he insisted on being at the ceremony.<eos> Agent Michaels, you'll lead Task Force X on the extraction;<eos> I'll have a plane ready for you in 30 minutes.
And these will help you keep those fears in check.<eos> It's my understanding that due to the lack of credible evidence, the people wish to drop all charges against Miss Godfrey.<eos> - We do, Your Honor.<eos> - So ordered.<eos> And as to the challenge of guardianship filed by Roman Godfrey, the court has found it without merit.<eos> Young lady, would you approach the bench, please?<eos> Miss Godfrey, I'm releasing you into your mother's care.<eos> Do you understand what I'm telling you?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I should warn you that even a legal finding of fact won't make your troubles disappear, and due to the notoriety of this case, there may be individuals who harbor anger towards you.
Just do what she says.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> I'm going to sedate you.<eos> You won't feel a thing.<eos> Isn't this the way it should be, children being sacrificed for their parent?<eos> I'm pretty sure it's the other way around.<eos> Look straight ahead.<eos> I'm going to unlock you.<eos> Run to the module.<eos> I'll be right behind you.
[ Voice breaking ] WHEN HE PUSHED ME OUT OF THE VAN AND I HEARD THE CARS COM-- COMING TOWARD ME... [ SNIFFLES ]<eos> IT'S OKAY, TASHA.<eos> YOU'RE SAFE NOW.<eos> I'LL NEVER FEEL SAFE.<eos> NOT AS LONG AS HE'S STILL ALIVE.<eos> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MS. OGDEN.<eos> WAIT.<eos> CAN I SAY SOMETHING?<eos> GO AHEAD.<eos> I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU.
I'M GONNA BE HAPPY AND HAVE LOVE IN MY LIFE.<eos> AND NO ONE IS GONNA STOP ME FROM GETTING WHAT I WANT.<eos> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.<eos> OHH, NO, NO, NO, NO.<eos> THANK YOU, TASHA.<eos> YOUR COURAGE REALLY INSPIRED THE JURY TO VOTE FOR THE DEATH PENALTY.<eos> I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE FORWARD OF ME, BUT CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?<eos> TASHA, I'M - - I'M -- I'M VERY FLATTERED, BUT, UH, I'M ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED.<eos> [ Laughing ] OH! YEAH.<eos> I-I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.
And what if he did it?<eos> Well, then he'll face the consequences, but with a mental-health diagnosis, it could be taken into account at sentencing.<eos> OKAY, DANIEL.<eos> I'LL ADMIT HIM.<eos> 24-HOUR OBSERVATION, BUT THAT'S IT.<eos> I'M SORRY, DOC, BUT SHE SAID IT WAS URGENT.<eos> CAMPUS SECURITY CALLED, SAID THAT THEY SPOTTED YOU LEAVING THE CAMPUS WITH JESSE BRANSON. WHERE IS HE?<eos> HUBBARD MEMORIAL, PSYCH WARD.<eos> WHERE LEGALLY, I CAN'T TOUCH HIM.<eos> YOU KNOW, THIS MORNING I FELT REALLY BAD FOR YOU AND YOUR BUDDY THE DEAN.
- Oh, happy to.<eos> Although, to be totally up front, If this is about the resume I mailed in to s.T.A.R. Labs, I've already accepted a position at mercury labs.<eos> - No, actually, I wanted to talk to you about F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M.<eos> - I'm sorry. This was a mistake.<eos> I have to go.<eos> - No, look, someone I care about is in trouble, And you're the only clue I have to help him.<eos> Please.<eos> - What's the line?<eos> I never got paranoid till they started plotting against me?<eos> - Why would they be plotting against you?
I definitely know her.<eos> I thought about nothing else for almost four years.<eos> When's the last time you talked to her?<eos> High school.<eos> But most of those conversations happened in my head.<eos> Do you really think she, uh, had something to do with this pipeline bomb?<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> If she's capable of that kind of violence, Maybe it's a good thing she never knew I existed.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Guys like you never wish for things to not happen With girls like sabine.
Yeah, the peace-giving courts.<eos> Do you believe in restorative justice?<eos> I don't much trust our system.<eos> They can't do worse.<eos> You won't mind if I tell the lieutenant, would you?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Hell, send him a picture.<eos> Good to see you, captain.<eos> Then you're an even bigger idiot than I thought, niedermayer.<eos> I think that he is trying to smooth things over Between you and the tribe.
Why would I wipe up spills With the bleached skin of a murdered tree?<eos> I had no idea she was there.<eos> Then you have the worst-kept secret fugitive safe house In all of portland.<eos> She must have found it during the scholarship tea party.<eos> Liar.<eos> If you're withholding any information from us --<eos> Ask her about the second bomb.<eos> I am weeks away from historic fossil-fuel legislation.<eos> Why would I risk it all by harboring a fugitive?<eos> Because to you, she's not a fugitive.
Find the next target before somebody dies.<eos> Is this seat taken?<eos> You don't remember me.<eos> We've never met.<eos> I'm crushed.<eos> "grilling for gas guzzlers."<eos> The fundraiser to fight Eleanor deering's mpg legislation.<eos> A mutual friend introduced us.<eos> I'm sorry -- who are you?<eos> I remember you.
You don't remember me.<eos> We've never met.<eos> I'm crushed.<eos> "grilling for gas guzzlers."<eos> The fundraiser to fight Eleanor deering's mpg legislation.<eos> A mutual friend introduced us.<eos> I'm sorry -- who are you?<eos> I remember you.<eos> I was mesmerized by -- by the way you spoke Of courage and righteousness. Oh, and -- and you wore<eos> And I gushed at how well it fit you.
You used to be a better liar.<eos> You got kids?<eos> Uh, no, sir.<eos> Not yet. I got lots.<eos> Everett's my youngest.<eos> Their mother died on me And forced me into becoming a real dad.<eos> I'm good with the others, give or take.<eos> But, uh, I could never reach that boy.<eos> Couldn't then, can't now.<eos> You know, I think you're asking him to trust you When his earliest memory of your relationship Is being pistol-whipped when he was 10.
Oh, right.<eos> Oh, 'cause your trust instincts are so good?<eos> Eleanor deering lied to your face.<eos> And the only reason sabine got away Is because you wanted to believe in her More than you wanted to stop her.<eos> Listen, if you want to believe A single-ply toilet paper can save the planet, fine.<eos> But false hope in the line of duty can get you killed,<eos> Or worse -- me!<eos> Being wrong about sabine isn't gonna make me a cynic.<eos> Hope is what drives me to be a cop, And hope's what's gonna drive me to catch her.<eos> What drives you?
I am a deputized u.S. Marshal.<eos> You might want to stand back, son.<eos> Sabine: Stay back.<eos> That's enough, now.<eos> [ sighs ] I can kill us all with one twitch.<eos> The thing is...<eos> I can't let you get back in that plane.<eos> Now, that leaves me killing you... Or you killing yourself.<eos> Or all these people get a chance To live and fight another day --<eos> Including you.
Better to be where your prey is going Than where it's been.<eos> I was the beater, Rattling the bushes to drive the prey out.<eos> How do you like that?<eos> I thought you were always too busy wise-cracking To ever learn anything from me.<eos> John almond.<eos> Been a while.<eos> You can score one more for the good guys.<eos> You played your own son?<eos> I offered him my hand. He refused it.<eos> Backstrom got to her before you did.
We're talking the equivalent of four Hiroshimas.<eos> To be used without the launch of a nuclear device.<eos> The ultimate chemical attack.<eos> We need to know who's behind this, and we need to know now.<eos> There's only one man who can answer all of our questions.<eos> Sean Bennigan was there on someone's direct orders.<eos> Question him, break him, and we'll get our answers.<eos> Where's my son?<eos> They should be bringing him in now.<eos> Mrs. Bennigan, we ran a thorough series of tests on you and your son.
Doctor privilege?<eos> He might speak to a prospective client.<eos> Yeah, but where will we find someone who seems maladjusted to women, unable to commit to an intimate and loving relationship, and uncomfortable with sex outside the type that requires financial remuneration?<eos> Dr. Fleck, I have a problem.<eos> I'm afraid to get undressed.<eos> Before sex?<eos> Before, during.<eos> Spiders and bacteria, microscopic vermin... they... they get inside.<eos> So far, so good.<eos> Inside you?
That lie tells you nothing 'cause it was a lie.<eos> You've gone through life unloved, and thus unable to love.<eos> You boast of your prowess as a lover.<eos> Well, that is true.<eos> Boasting of sexual prowess is a statement of pure ego based on competition with other males... nothing to do with women.<eos> - Wait, no.<eos> - Sexual stimulation and other - physical outlets... - I... okay.<eos> Eating, drinking, drugs... are your coping mechanisms to disconnect from your emotions.<eos> Pleasure without vulnerability, fun without feeling.<eos> For you, sex is not a form of connection.
- Oh, here we go.<eos> Has diminished the full range of your sexual response.<eos> Now, a few more sessions with me...<eos> Did she say "more sessions"?<eos> And your response could be deeper, more meaningful, more erotic, more human.<eos> You'd stop saying that you like hookers and say that you like women. Oh.<eos> He likes hookers.<eos> Can we talk about Larissa?<eos> Frankly, Larissa would never have been a truly successful surrogate because she used her beauty.<eos> But if it was Dr. Fleck referring clients and he preferred Larissa to you, oh, that would cut into your income.
The next words out of your mouth better explain why your blood was on the board that caused that crash.<eos> I-I guess because I must've made it?<eos> Uh, the tools are sharp, the components are small.<eos> I prick my fat fingers, like, all the time, man!<eos> And I make a lot of boards for people.<eos> Who'd you make this one for? I have no idea.<eos> I swear.<eos> It's an all cash business.<eos> No names... no addresses, no phone numbers.<eos> Unlike you, I don't ask questions.
Lucky girl gets pinned, huh?<eos> So what'll it be?<eos> The usual?<eos> Thanks, Lucille.<eos> Jimmy Too!<eos> - Lucille.<eos> - Hey, handsome.<eos> You look... muah, muah.<eos> - Welcome back.<eos> - Look at you in that dress.
Hard working businessman.<eos> Credit to his race.<eos> Hey, listen, wise guy.<eos> When I was a rook, Cass and I were buddies.<eos> He used to keep a bottle of Jack Daniel's for me and we'd bitch about... everything.<eos> Remember Bunchy Carter?<eos> He calls himself a Black Panther now.<eos> All Bunchy and the cat people want to talk about is Michael Younger, so I figure if I can turn the corner on that, then maybe I can catch some goodwill on Cass.<eos> 'Cause I need it and Cass deserves it.<eos> I can look into Younger for you.
What do you want from me?<eos> I want you to have a story, whether it's the truth, or...<eos> He say anything to you, Manson?<eos> - He thanked me.<eos> - That must have felt nice.<eos> He owes me now.<eos> And I can use him to get in with Butano.<eos> Skip the pushers, get to the supplier... my job, yeah?<eos> And I can use him to get to Emma.<eos> For you.
Every night.<eos> But I get to it last.<eos> It's all the way in back behind Miss Ball's offices.<eos> And by the time I got there...<eos> Who would do that?<eos> All right, all right, step back, away from the gate.<eos> Hey, Hodiak! Was Raymond Novo murdered?<eos> Is his body still inside?<eos> Thank you, Francine.<eos> I'll have a prepared statement for you in an hour.
Maybe now you feel different.<eos> A little more... open to things that can benefit you, and I hope that you're more disposed to seeing me for what I am.<eos> You want a rabbi.<eos> That is so cute.<eos> Would you please go get me a cup of coffee?<eos> Okay.<eos> Charmain.<eos> Bring back the, uh, minutes from those meetings, and we'll go through them together.<eos> Ah, thanks for holding down the fort.<eos> Call for you about the Raymond Novo murder.
You might be right.<eos> And i'll need things, like the address Where you and marvin met.<eos> Stone trail dog park.<eos> The kind of car you were driving at that meeting.<eos> Silver, luxury, electric.<eos> Might even help if i knew You were wearing a blue button-down shirt.<eos> Seems pretty specific. It is.<eos> But probably the most helpful bit of information Is the conversation our witness overheard.<eos> What witness?<eos> The witness who picked both you and marvin Out of a photo lineup.
Well, you never know.<eos> Might just surprise yourself someday.<eos> Everything working out with the seafood?<eos> Oh, yeah. Deliveries have been fresh, they've been on time.<eos> How about bait and tackle?<eos> Keeping you busy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tourist season's in full swing.<eos> In fact, we're looking to run four charters this week.<eos> That gonna be a problem for you?
I need a consult.<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> You ready?<eos> Alprazolam, one milligram, four times a day.<eos> Metoprolol, 10 milligrams, once a day.<eos> It's going great with your mom.<eos> Is it possible I might get an advance on next week's?<eos> And possibly the week after?<eos> I won't be needing you that long.
I'm sorry, I can't...<eos> She can barely talk, it hurts so much.<eos> And what's your mom's name?<eos> Susan Kim.<eos> Susan Kim?<eos> Wear the Dunks, please.<eos> What you wear signals something to others, Zoey.<eos> I think speed and comfort are two very good signals.<eos> I want to be very clear, and to that end one of the rules of diversion for Jackie is that she will have a designated monitor.<eos> That must be very hard for you on top of everything else you're doing.
Quick question, is Jackie still a nurse?<eos> She is a nursing assistant.<eos> So we're pretending she doesn't know anything.<eos> Got it.<eos> Do I have to comply?<eos> With all the shit work I'm gonna throw her way, Jackie won't last a week.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is all feeling very weird and personal.<eos> Of course it's personal, Zoey.<eos> It should be personal for you, too.
Maybe it's better not to have friends at work.<eos> Coop just asked me to be the godfather for his kid.<eos> I have to say yes, right?<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Poor Coop.<eos> Oh, Coop is not poor.<eos> He just bought a surprise house.<eos> Paid for it in cash.<eos> Can he get his money back?<eos> I have a question for you.
Previously on "Nurse Jackie"...<eos> Help, my wife!<eos> Please help!<eos> I need help!<eos> Officer: Ma'am, are you in any way impaired?<eos> Diversion is gonna be hell.<eos> You may not touch patients, and just so nobody mistakes you for a real nurse, lose the blue scrubs.<eos> Miscarriages, especially in the first trimester, are very, very common.<eos> One of the rules of diversion for Jackie is that she will have a designated monitor.<eos> That must be hard for you.
Will you tell him?<eos> Why don't you just dump him in a place somewhere where he don't know nobody and nobody knows him?<eos> That's what the people who love me are doing.<eos> Oh, my God, that is so perfectly sad.<eos> Hello?<eos> Vivian, hi, it's Jackie.<eos> I need you to look straight ahead.<eos> I need you to listen to me, and I need you to not get angry.<eos> You are such a fighter.<eos> That's what I like most about you.
Prices begin at $3.5 million.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - It looks like a very intriguing plan, but what about public pressure to keep the hospital open?<eos> Uh, we have a wonderful conflict resolution team that specializes in smoothing out any potential opposition.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Shoot me now.<eos> Any other follow-ups? Jackie, you should not be here.<eos> Um, I was just leaving...<eos> Ms. Chow.<eos> This is for you.
Brutal.<eos> I'm drunk, sir.<eos> I'm- - I'm drunk right now.<eos> This girl really meant something to you, didn't she?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She did.<eos> I've been working for Dunbar.<eos> I pushed myself too much.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> It was for you.
My parents sent me to learn from Lady Murasaki when I was just a girl.<eos> I learned from Hannibal, too.<eos> He comes in the guise of a mentor, but it's distress that excites him.<eos> I'm not in distress.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You had a strict rule about taking life. And you broke it.<eos> Is it on your mind?<eos> Do you see yourself killing him over and over?<eos> No.<eos> I see you.
With lepre.<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> A table setting from the home of Dr Hannibal Lecter.<eos> The silverware is 19th-century Dutch from Christofle.<eos> The plate is Glen French china from Tiffany.<eos> The table linen is damask cotton. Also from Christofle.<eos> You've got to hand it to the man, he has the most marvellous taste.<eos> I've discovered a pattern of purchases.<eos> An echo of the life he lived in Baltimore.<eos> He likes music, he likes wine, he likes food and he likes you.
To tell you the truth, I don't care with vanessa gone.<eos> Well, listen, do you think Your wife maybe was having an affair with sampson And then released the video when everything went south?<eos> No. No, my wife would never cheat on me.<eos> Well, you have been sick for a long time.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> Well... Do you want to look at your dream board<eos> While I take some blood?<eos> No. There's too many pictures of vanessa.<eos> What's this?<eos> Someone force a bunch of kids to make this for you?
No. Near the hotel vivienne.<eos> When was the last time you did that?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> Why spend 50 bucks to avoid a $15 ticket?<eos> So there's no record of him ever being there.<eos> He's having an affair with our victim.<eos> I knew it.<eos> To the bat cave, robin.<eos> Wait a minute. Robin rides shotgun like you do.
[ sighs ] [ gasps ] You are really gonna need my help.<eos> Will you or won't you?<eos> I will if I can be your rich-bastard date.<eos> Sure.<eos> Oh, wow! Up until now, The fanciest thing I'd ever been to<eos> I don't think we should drink.<eos> Mmm. We're undercover.<eos> And this is not the cheap stuff.<eos> There we go.<eos> For you, madam.
At 2:15, a confirmation e-mail was sent from flashcar, And at 2:20, she logged out.<eos> You are a very naughty nurse.<eos> You're done.<eos> You can get dressed now.<eos> Your liver tells me you haven't quit drinking,<eos> Your pallor tells me you aren't sleeping, And I have seen with my very own eyes<eos> That you haven't stopped smoking. When you finally fall of a heart attack or stroke Or whatever inevitable malady takes you,<eos> They will turn to me and say,<eos> "how could you find him fit to work?"<eos> Oh. So it's about you.
That you haven't stopped smoking. When you finally fall of a heart attack or stroke Or whatever inevitable malady takes you,<eos> They will turn to me and say,<eos> "how could you find him fit to work?"<eos> Oh. So it's about you.<eos> The worst part about your world view Is that it's contagious.<eos> Those of us around you Begin to see ourselves as yosee us.<eos> You think I'm a terrible doctor, I become a terrible doctor.<eos> No, not so terrible. I got 10,000 steps, right?<eos> My feet are killing me.<eos> It's merely a machine that counts What the machine part of you is achieving.
It measures activity. You like activity Because it allows you to avoid reflection.<eos> It is reflection which leads us to our true best selves,<eos> Not activity. So, the pedometer is stopping me From reaching my true best self.<eos> Perhaps another doctor would have better luck.<eos> I don't want another doctor.<eos> You joined a program?<eos> I didn't want to come see you Until I could prove beyond a shadow of a doubt That you had, in fact, helped me become my true best self.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good for you.
How come we got you?<eos> Well. I've been pestering the secretary for some time for a case, and I don't suppose everybody can afford to take the time off.<eos> Are you rich?<eos> PEGGY: Janet Hodgson, what sort of question is that?<eos> You mind your manners. Get in that bath.<eos> Oh, kids, eh?<eos> - You got any, Mr Grosse?<eos> - Three.<eos> That's nice.<eos> I'm making Johnny's bed up for you, if you ever want to kip down.
Oh, God.<eos> - My first ever cover story...<eos> - PEGGY: Oh. - Thank you very much.<eos> - Well. - JANET:<eos> Let's have a look. - PEGGY: Ooh.<eos> I don't think they messed around with your quotes too much, Maurice.<eos> And look...<eos> Oh, there we are.<eos> - DOUG: Nice one of you, Janet. - (EVERYONE LAUGHS)<eos> BILLY: Look at you!
- Give me back my ten pence piece! - (GROWLS)<eos> What's he done with my ten pence piece?<eos> (DISTORTED VOICE) Come here and I'll give you ten pence. - PEGGY: Janet!<eos> GUY: Was it more than one entity?<eos> Did you get a sense of who any of them were?<eos> One thing I have clear, this is not something you should communicate with.<eos> And did any of the things that came out of Mrs Craine's mouth, did they mean anything to you? GUY:<eos> The playground chants or...<eos> This is a house of death.<eos> For you.
Who wants to know?<eos> Well, I'm trying to track down the Tony Watson that grew up in 284 Green Street.<eos> He did die at that house, 1961.<eos> Brain haemorrhage.<eos> Nobody knew 'til they saw the flies against the window.<eos> That's how popular he was.<eos> I don't think it's the same chair, mate.<eos> Not unless someone gave it a good shampoo.<eos> Can you think... Can you think of any reason why your dad's spirit might still be there?<eos> I was wondering if perhaps he had a... Perhaps he had a message for you or if your presence there would somehow help him move on.
Mom, Dad, please just get along.<eos> Thousands of people are about to lose their only hospital.<eos> I'm gonna do something about it.<eos> Let's not get distracted.<eos> We still have a hospital to run.<eos> This will be demo'd completely, obviously.<eos> 40 feet up this way, the atrium.<eos> So much light coming... And, uh, will you excuse me for a moment?<eos> I heard your speech last week.<eos> That must have been very difficult for you, publically changing your opinion.
Thank you, thank you.<eos> The union now officially has your backs and great lawyers!<eos> - Save our Saints!<eos> - Save our Saints!<eos> Save our Saints!<eos> Save our Saints!<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Zoey got on top of a cop car and everybody started chanting.<eos> I'm surprised you weren't out here today.<eos> I could say the same about you.
What's wrong with you?<eos> You're keeping us from living our lives!<eos> I gave up my career, Everything that i knew, To be at home with amy.<eos> We're prisoners here. I can't<eos> Take it anymore. (shouts)<eos> Don't you understand How much i love you?<eos> I'm tired of running.<eos> You don't deserve this.<eos> It's not fair,<eos> For you or your child.
But if Leland's not here, then...<eos> He could be anywhere.<eos> Here we are.<eos> You sure you want to go in there?<eos> It doesn't look too friendly.<eos> I'm not here to make friends.<eos> I'm here to get my money.<eos> Is money all you care about?<eos> What else is there?<eos> If he's defrauded all those banks, he may be worth more to you alive then dead.
- Yeah, we got it.<eos> Claire, we saw him.<eos> What do you mean, you saw him?<eos> On the thermal camera, he was...<eos> he was with Henry.<eos> - Is he still?<eos> - No, he's... he's gone.<eos> Do you know what this means?<eos> Agent Bennigan?<eos> I have a message for you from Drill.
Stop me if I ever say "growthfulness."<eos> Jackie, even though you are a great nurse, you've got to admit you have some baggage.<eos> - Drug addiction.<eos> - I'm just gonna let her answer everything.<eos> Gloria...<eos> I am trying to reconcile all this rigidity.<eos> Where is the warm woman I karaoked down Electric Avenue with at the Christmas party?<eos> Here's what I'm reconciling... how to work with an addict who I thought was my friend.<eos> All right, I... I hear that.<eos> Did someone close to you turn into a junkie?
Flush 'em?<eos> Eh, it'd make the fish happy.<eos> - Shall we? No.<eos> - We should.<eos> Seduced and abandoned.<eos> I took his last name, but screw the bastard.<eos> Wait, I did.<eos> You know what you needed?<eos> Couples counseling.<eos> Not from you.
- There's that word again.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> It's too much Verdicchio on an empty stomach.<eos> A little bit.<eos> Doctor, the poulet roti.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Madam, may I bone your branzino?<eos> Actually, I would prefer to bone it myself.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Look at you.
That life would be easier... his life, my life.<eos> God, I'm terrible.<eos> Maybe you're more ready for this than you care to admit.<eos> Hey, I spoke to Natalie.<eos> We need to help them.<eos> Yeah, that is what I'm trying to do.<eos> Bernie, they're both ready to let go.<eos> This is not some medical mystery you're gonna solve, at least not today.<eos> I'm not gonna give up on my patient.<eos> It's not about you.
I didn't want to spend my last few months just lying in bed feeling sorry for myself.<eos> I'd rather go out in a blaze of glory and run a kick-ass ER.<eos> I like your attitude.<eos> Hey, how's Eddie?<eos> I love that guy.<eos> Me, too.<eos> He's picking me up for dinner tonight.<eos> You can say hi.<eos> Thanks for doing this.<eos> I... I know it's risky for you.
You can have it.<eos> I'm just giving you assistance.<eos> I'm not touching anyone.<eos> Sorry, honey.<eos> So you know you need regular checkups, right?<eos> This is my checkup.<eos> I work 16-hour days.<eos> I got no time for doctors.<eos> Well, you're in luck.<eos> We have a great new doctor for you today.
Just drive.<eos> Well, I'm trying, but this situation's very stressful.<eos> Yeah, I didn't ask you to come, you volunteered.<eos> Well, I know, but now I'm in the middle of a big family drama.<eos> If you don't want to be in the middle, don't answer Grace's phone calls.<eos> If I didn't answer her calls, you wouldn't know where your daughter is right now.<eos> Congratulations on your secret engagement.<eos> No, no music, I'm merging.<eos> History of hypothyroidism, hypertension...<eos> - Look at you go.
I... I...<eos> I can't.<eos> Okay?<eos> We just need... You just to trust me a little while longer.<eos> Okay?<eos> You take care of everyone else.<eos> I can take care of our daughter.<eos> What do you hope to learn from me?<eos> I have spent my whole life posing questions about the universe, Captain Bennigan... about the possibility of a higher intelligence somewhere out there.<eos> Because of you, I finally get a chance to answer them.
Tawney, do you want to save your marriage?<eos> You're gonna have to trust someone...<eos> At some point.<eos> I feel so guilty.<eos> About what?<eos> When I had my miscarriage...<eos> Part of me was relieved.<eos> You're not the first woman to have had that experience.<eos> And you won't be the last.<eos> And from what little I know about you already, it's not that surprising, you know?
You shouldn't have gone inside without a warrant.<eos> I realize that now.<eos> Not even your jurisdiction.<eos> You're state.<eos> Ma'am, I've been thinking, we could bring in the GBI on this end, let them oversee things here in Paulie if it'd make you feel better.<eos> - And what would that be saying? - It would be saying that we're doing everything on the level.<eos> It would be saying that things are already tainted here.<eos> Are things tainted here, Sheriff?<eos> Not by me.<eos> And/or that there's no faith that the investigation can be handled by you, the Sheriff, or me, the District Attorney.
There's no way.<eos> We can't be 100% sure about anything, Benji, unless we see it with our own eyes.<eos> Well, where's the gun then?<eos> See, you don't get it, Sheriff.<eos> George didn't have no backbone.<eos> Ever since he was a little boy, you could see that.<eos> And there was nothing I could do to give him one neither.<eos> Well, I appreciate you talking with me under these circumstances.<eos> And, again, I'm awful sorry for your loss.<eos> I'd check in on Trey Willis if I was you.
No, no, no!<eos> Thomas!<eos> Open this door, Janson!<eos> You really don't want me to.<eos> Open the damn door!<eos> Listen to me! I'm trying to save your life.<eos> The maze is one thing, but you kids wouldn't last one day... out in the Scorch.<eos> If the elements don't kill you, the Cranks will.<eos> Thomas, you have to believe me.<eos> I only want what's best for you.
That's what's causing shortness of breath.<eos> They'll need to drain her stomach and analyze the fluid for infection... cancer.<eos> Well, there is a 12-hour wait for the OR today.<eos> Motherfuckers.<eos> All right, let's, um... let's just keep her in here... so she doesn't get overwhelmed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, you need to watch where you are going.<eos> Oh, yes, these peonies are very delicate.<eos> No, I was talking about not running into other human people.<eos> But I can see how keeping flowers safe is a priority for you.
She is not having any affair, sexual, with you.<eos> I'm sorry, I thought that you knew.<eos> Uh, "Sex in the City."<eos> You girls talk with one another about the sex.<eos> You have brunch, no?<eos> Gloria's voice: You've reached the voicemail of Gloria Akalitus.<eos> - This better be important. - ( line beeps )<eos> Hi, Gloria, Um... it's Jackie.<eos> I heard that you were sick.<eos> I'm calling to check on you, see... ( exhales ) See if there's anything I can say to make you... make your flu go away.
It's not a fanny pack.<eos> No, it's a utility belt.<eos> No, I won't be taking it off.<eos> Let's give him a cortisone shot.<eos> One cc, it'll help with the pain in his legs until we transfer his crazy to Ortho downtown.<eos> Uh, okay, I don't feel pain.<eos> I do understand you have a job to do, but so do I.<eos> There's a lot of people out there in the city that need protecting.<eos> Yes.<eos> We need you.
No, it's a utility belt.<eos> No, I won't be taking it off.<eos> Let's give him a cortisone shot.<eos> One cc, it'll help with the pain in his legs until we transfer his crazy to Ortho downtown.<eos> Uh, okay, I don't feel pain.<eos> I do understand you have a job to do, but so do I.<eos> There's a lot of people out there in the city that need protecting.<eos> Yes.<eos> We need you.<eos> We all need you.
You should be off your feet.<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> I... I can't be tied down.<eos> I'm not going back to another hospital.<eos> I've got things to do.<eos> I've got a job.<eos> Okay, but first you got to rest.<eos> No, there are people out there that need me.<eos> I... no, hold on... I understand that.<eos> Wait, I need you.
I'm not crazy.<eos> I... I can't be tied down.<eos> I'm not going back to another hospital.<eos> I've got things to do.<eos> I've got a job.<eos> Okay, but first you got to rest.<eos> No, there are people out there that need me.<eos> I... no, hold on...

Psychical research. It's a group of people who are interested in this sort of thing.<eos> How come we got you?<eos> Well, I've been pestering the secretary for some time for a case and I don't suppose everybody can afford to take the time off.<eos> Are you rich? Janet Hodgson, what sort of question is that?<eos> You're going to your Nana's.<eos> Get in that bath.<eos> Kids, eh?<eos> Have you got any, Mr Grosse?<eos> Three. That's nice.<eos> I'm making Johnny's bed up for you if you ever want to kip down.
Janet! Oh, God!<eos> My first ever cover story! Oh!<eos> Thank you very much!<eos> Well.<eos> Let's have a look! Ooh!<eos> I don't think they messed around with your quotes too much, Maurice.<eos> And look.<eos> There we are!<eos> Nice one of you, Jan, look!<eos> Look at you!
Give me back my ten pence piece!<eos> What's he done with my ten pence piece?<eos> Come here and I'll give you tenpence.<eos> Was it more than one entity?<eos> Did you get a sense of who any of them were?<eos> One thing I have clear.<eos> This is not something you should communicate with.<eos> And did any of the things that came out of Mrs Crane's mouth, did they mean anything to you, the playground chants or...?<eos> This is a house of death.<eos> For you.
Who wants to know?<eos> Right, I'm trying to track down the Tony Watson that grew up in 384 Green Street.<eos> He did die at that house.<eos> 1961. Brain haemorrhage.<eos> Nobody knew till they saw the flies against the window.<eos> That's how popular he was.<eos> I don't think it's the same chair, mate.<eos> Not unless someone gave it a good shampoo.<eos> Can you think of any reason why your dad's spirit might still be there?<eos> I was wondering if perhaps he had a message for you or if your presence there would somehow help him move on.
This is a house of death for you.
Woe to them that are mighty men of strength to mingle with strong drink.<eos> Nothing he says will be admissible.<eos> This is a waste of time.<eos> All right.<eos> Let us make a covenant that shall serve as a witness between us.<eos> What are you trying to tell me, old man?<eos> Yeah, good luck with that.<eos> All right.<eos> You know what, he knows something.<eos> I was just thinking about you, Deputy Mayor.
- Gonna go see Q-Dubs? - Yeah.<eos> By yourself?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, if you want me to be your wingman, I'll go with you, I don't care.<eos> Be good to see the old neighborhood.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Jamie?<eos> Yes?<eos> Mrs. St. Patrick, your husband requested an in-room deep-tissue massage for you.
Fuck you.<eos> I had some bad luck.<eos> I'm still not signing my club over to anyone.<eos> And I get that.<eos> I do. But sometimes we all just need a push...<eos> Bullshit, this contract's filled with all sorts of operational covenants.<eos> You and I both know that. There's no way I meet all those restrictions.<eos> Now you see that?<eos> You gotta believe in yourself more.<eos> I have faith in you.
The bill took a while to find us here.<eos> When I paid it, they gave me the contents.<eos> You settling in okay?<eos> What's it mean?<eos> Looks like a party.<eos> Did you follow up with Sheriff's?<eos> They got nothing.<eos> I hear nothing.<eos> I didn't want to hand this over.<eos> I thought... When we talked, I thought I could trust you.
Home movies.<eos> A hard drive full of them.<eos> If you're interested in doing something for us, it could put you back in the corridor.<eos> Somebody's got that hard drive.<eos> I know the police never found it in either of his houses.<eos> What about the Mexicans? Did Caspere?<eos> I'm no detective, but it might be a good place to start.<eos> If you believe they're the ones that did it.<eos> Five parcels, gifted, I find that hard drive.<eos> Oh, yes, I remember you. Correct?

Spit.<eos> A Buddhist singing bowl.<eos> The gong represents the start of a new day.<eos> Buddhists don't eat meat.<eos> This isn't meat. This is man.<eos> Papa always used to say meat was a people business.<eos> He was a pioneer in livestock production, I'm sure he's eaten someone.<eos> I must admit, I tremble at the notion myself.<eos> I find there's something reassuring about you eating Dr Lecter.<eos> It makes you the apex predator.
And what condition is that, Mrs Fell?<eos> I get confused.<eos> Oh, please!<eos> You need to get over yourself, whatever self that is, Bedelia.<eos> My name is Lydia Fell.<eos> You expect us to believe that you somehow lost yourself in the hot darkness of Hannibal Lecter's mind?<eos> That Lydia Fell is some construct?<eos> - It's you, isn't it?<eos> - Well, now, I'm really confused.<eos> I don't believe you.
Previously on Hannibal...<eos> You won't be coming back here for a long time.<eos> There's something reassuring about you eating Dr. Lecter.<eos> It makes you the apex predator.
There will be no warrant and there will be no warrant forthcoming.<eos> I appreciate wanting to kill Hannibal Lecter and I'm not without benefit from that.<eos> He can't make good on his promise to murder you if he's dead, now can he?<eos> But he's not dead.<eos> Play with your food, Mason, and you give it the opportunity to bite back.<eos> Oh, I'm not playing, Dr. Bloom.<eos> Hannibal is.<eos> He's always playing.<eos> I snatched Will Graham right out of your mouth.<eos> There is an inescapable parallel between you and Jezebel, Mason.
It's foolish to dilute such ecstatic time as this with fears about the future.<eos> Uh, Cordell, Mr. Graham is looking very dry.<eos> - A little moisturizer, please.<eos> - I'm curious, what will be the first cuts of me you'll serve?<eos> The first course, of course, will be your hands and feet, sizzling on a Promethean barbecue.<eos> The coal is white and very hard, makes a clear ringing sound when struck.<eos> You've thought of everything.<eos> And after that, we'll have a little pajama party, you and I. You can be in shorties by then.<eos> Cordell is going to keep you alive for a very long time.<eos> Well, no pajama party for you, Mr. Graham.
I'll boil it and slice it very thin, marinate it in olive oil, garlic, parsley and vinegar.<eos> Simple and clean... and delicious.<eos> Have they told you the drill?<eos> The drill is, in a few hours, I'll come down here and remove all you've got below the elbows and knees.<eos> I'll keep you going with IVs and tourniquets until the very last.<eos> Some things are best saved for last.<eos> Once you're dead, I'll prepare your loins and ribs, aged.<eos> Meats are aged not only for tenderness, - but mainly for flavour.<eos> - And flavours change.<eos> Every day I'll feed Mason some new part of you.
What are you doing here?<eos> I'm Mason Verger's psychiatrist.<eos> Oh... That part of his therapy or yours?<eos> I think we're all working through some issues.<eos> I'm putting an emphasis on self-preservation.<eos> Jack's alive.<eos> Good for Jack.<eos> You helped Mason Verger find us.<eos> I helped Mason find Hannibal.<eos> We followed Bâtard-Montrachet when we should have just followed you.

Mason promised to give something back to me.<eos> Something that he stole.<eos> There was a surrogate all along.<eos> It's a Verger baby.<eos> It's my baby.<eos> Mason will deny you.<eos> He will always deny you.<eos> You know you'll have to kill him.<eos> You saying you'd do it for me?<eos> I could never trust you.
Some beasts shouldn't be caged.<eos> Your obsessive and successful hunt, whose plight was it driven by?<eos> Yours?<eos> Mischa's.<eos> Did you eat her?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I did not kill her.<eos> The most stable elements, Chiyoh, appear in the middle of the periodic table, roughly between iron and silver.<eos> Between iron and silver...<eos> I think that's appropriate for you.
It shares some rooms with my own.<eos> I've discovered you there, victorious.<eos> When it comes to you and me, there can be no decisive victory.<eos> We are in zero-sum game?<eos> I miss my dogs.<eos> I'm not going to miss you.<eos> I'm not going to find you.<eos> I'm not going to look for you.<eos> I don't want to know where you are or what you do.<eos> I don't want to think about you anymore.
Previously on Hannibal...<eos> I'm going to cut off your face without anesthesia, Mr. Graham.<eos> I was trying to save Willfrom you.
In this case, a local cow.<eos> And when you last made it for me?<eos> The blood was from a cow, only in the derogatory sense.<eos> Blood and chocolate.<eos> That should have been the subtitle of my book.<eos> But I promised myself I would never use colons in my titles.<eos> Colons lose their novelty when overused.<eos> You'll have to write another book.<eos> I am.<eos> But not about you.
Two families killed in their homes a month apart.<eos> Similar circumstances.<eos> Not similar.<eos> The same.<eos> You ever think about giving me a call?<eos> No.<eos> You know what it is?<eos> I didn't call you because<eos> I didn't want to.<eos> I don't think I can be of any use to you, Jack.
Release him!<eos> The boy belongs to the goddess Artemis, who stalks these woods with a vengeful heart.<eos> She's brought us meat.<eos> Enough for a month.<eos> I am the Oracle of Gaia, so be warned,<eos> I am protected by Poseidon and Keto and carry the mark of Keres.<eos> Mm. Let us see this mark.<eos> It's on my heart.<eos> Ah, then we will search for it once we taste your pretty flesh.<eos> Your mother, Rosemary, calls to you.
That message was intended for me.<eos> It has I... your son, who was been negotiating terms of surrender with the enemy, not Pallas.<eos> Why?<eos> At the time, I still believed I carried the Lexicon.<eos> Giving myself up to Minos seemed a price worth paying for peace.<eos> But that's treason.<eos> Treason that saves our city from destruction, that keeps our citizens alive... and you on the throne.<eos> Pallas was right.<eos> The olive tree was sick, and its fruit was starting to poison us all.<eos> Every new order from you, our king, has brought us closer to the abyss, so I acted in secret.
You screwed a tree?<eos> Still picking the splinters out.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> - Lady in a little car.<eos> - Recognize her?<eos> Yeah, I seen her waitressin' over at Sullivan's.<eos> Helps out with the kids at the elementary school, too.<eos> Which one of you is Whizzer?<eos> - Help you?<eos> - Guy named Scotty work for you?
Why?<eos> He's been causing trouble for the... girl here.<eos> Where would you go to find him?<eos> No place.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know Heidi.<eos> I substitute at her school sometimes.<eos> - You know my daughter?<eos> - She's a real nice girl. My name's Lillian.<eos> She's mentioned you.
Yes, we get caught up in what we're doing... who we think we are.<eos> So... who are you, Wilson?<eos> Tonight, I'm just a man... enjoying the company of a captivating woman.<eos> I told you he's indisposed.<eos> Sir, I need to speak with you.<eos> What is this?<eos> We need to go... now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I want to tell you, my brother and I, we gratefully accept...<eos> Wesley will take care of you.
But you can do something about it... for all of us, Mike.<eos> Matthew.<eos> My name is Matthew.<eos> Will I see you again?<eos> I don't usually date customers.<eos> You came out with me tonight.<eos> And here we are, so...<eos> I can... return the painting, and then I'd no longer be a...<eos> I'm not interested in gestures, Wilson, or your money, or... whatever that was all about at the restaurant.<eos> I went out with you because... there's something different about you.
We are?<eos> Why not?<eos> My dad owned a hardware store for 12 forevers, picked up a few things.<eos> At least get the ball rolling.<eos> - And your cousin's a drywall guy, right?<eos> - That he is.<eos> And Matt and I fished an electrician out of the drunk tank.<eos> Owes us a favor.<eos> We're gonna talk to your neighbors, too, okay, Mrs. Cardenas?<eos> We're gonna take care of you.
It's right here.<eos> Here we go.<eos> You okay, Mr. Crawford?<eos> You're sweating.<eos> Yeah, I just came back from a run.<eos> It's nice you can keep up with your routine.<eos> Most people wouldn't.<eos> I know it's in here somewhere.<eos> Well, I don't want to take up too much of your time.<eos> I can do that for you if it's easier.
Christy, I've screwed up...<eos> A lot.<eos> But I need you to stand by me on this, and if you won't do it for me, then can you please do it for our girls?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I am.<eos> And I will.<eos> I'm late.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Ben Crawford.<eos> Mr. Crawford, I've got a job for you. - Really?
Yeah, I'm, I'm real grateful you weren't scared off, so...<eos> Believe me, I get it.<eos> You know, when we were getting divorced, my ex... she suddenly remembered that I sexually assaulted her.<eos> One of those nightmare custody fights you hear about.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I found out right then how fast people rush to judgment.<eos> It's like I woke up one day and suddenly, I was the bad guy.<eos> You know?<eos> It's pretty surreal.<eos> Bad as it is for me, I can't imagine how terrible it was for you to find that little boy out there.
Places that were hit, all controlled by the Russians.<eos> Ben! Ben!<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I'll let him know.<eos> - Vladimir is in the wind.<eos> - How?<eos> Our friend in the black mask, he was beating on him, but stopped Officer Corbin and his boys from finishing him off.<eos> Then he wasn't trying to kill Vladimir.<eos> Based on what we know, probably trying to get him to talk... about you.
Hey! Hey!<eos> I got an elderly woman over here and she's bleeding bad!<eos> - Where's she hurt?<eos> - Are you a nurse?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Pretty bad laceration.<eos> - What's her name?<eos> - Mrs. Cardenas.<eos> Elena.<eos> We'll wait here for you, Mrs. C!
The second you call your lawyer, We are going to offer the buyer of these drugs a deal In which we drop possession charges<eos> What buyer? Sebastian?<eos> He's dead!<eos> Why do you want a name?<eos> So that you can drop another customer in the quarry?<eos> I had nothing to do with sebastian's death!<eos> [ sighs ] That was police endangerment.<eos> Gravely, drive the cart back.<eos> I need to talk to kobrine alone.<eos> Someone bought these from you.
I had nothing to do with sebastian's death!<eos> [ sighs ] That was police endangerment.<eos> Gravely, drive the cart back.<eos> I need to talk to kobrine alone.<eos> Someone bought these from you.<eos> We don't know who.<eos> You need to tell us.<eos> Why would I incriminate myself?<eos> Sebastian was killed by someone he thought was a friend.<eos> That friend bought these from you to give to him.
You sent your partner away so you can swallow these pills.<eos> You should get help.<eos> Kobrine sold the pills to the drummer.<eos> He admitted that?<eos> He did this.<eos> Stand back. Coming through.<eos> Here. Go arrest the drummer.<eos> Some of these pills are missing.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> We have a sworn statement from dr. Alan kobrine Implicating you in the sale of this oxycodone.
Why?<eos> How's valentine?<eos> He got what he deserved.<eos> Why are you rechecking alibis?<eos> Because as it turns out, Everyone in the band hated sebastian.<eos> Only lara hausberg was personally sorry that he's gone. What's this?<eos> Oh, that's just niedermayer's little game,<eos> No, this is good.<eos> Everyone in the band hated sebastian, Just like all of you hate me.<eos> I like you, sir.
Who the hell can do that?<eos> Very few people are capable of covering their tracks this well.<eos> We also weren't able to trace the real source of the text I received from your number.<eos> Why would someone do this?<eos> Public perception is that you murdered a child.<eos> Yeah, because that's what you wanted them to think.<eos> Dead children tend to elicit a heightened emotional response.<eos> Whoever did this, they watched, they waited.<eos> You have a stalker, Mr. Crawford.<eos> You mean aside from you?
But here I am.<eos> Yeah, for drugs, in case you're wondering.<eos> What about rehab?<eos> My father asked the same question.<eos> Andrea wouldn't budge.<eos> The law's the law.<eos> There's got to be something you can do.<eos> I'm doing it.<eos> With good behavior, I'm out in 18 months.<eos> What is she coming after you for?
It might help you if you talk about it.<eos> Ben Crawford.<eos> Right now?<eos> Fine.<eos> Ben, you need a lawyer.<eos> Just think... when she arrests me, I'll get one for free.<eos> So, you have two options... confess and spare your family the horror of a high-profile murder trial...<eos> I didn't kill Tom.<eos> Or brace yourself for a full-court press.<eos> 'Cause they'll not only follow you, they'll follow your kids, your wife, your kids' friends.

It's done.<eos> And then Christy was standing there waiting when I came back.<eos> So what?<eos> You were taking a leak, right?<eos> That's what I said, but...<eos> She doesn't know anything, right?<eos> Does she know anything?<eos> Ben?<eos> You lying bitch.<eos> You know, my mom felt sorry for you, and you screwed us.
It's all your fault!<eos> Why do you keep coming here?<eos> It'd probably be best if you take your family inside.<eos> He didn't do anything wrong!<eos> Abby, stop.<eos> We can't leave dad alone with her.<eos> Honey, it's okay.<eos> You guys go in.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you.
It's only effective if you speak.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - No.<eos> John, I still can't pay you.<eos> I got a cashier's check for 25 grand with your name on it last week.<eos> I don't have that kind of money.<eos> All right, we'll deal with that later.<eos> I still want to know why we're here.<eos> Ask Cornell.<eos> No, I'm asking you.
You'd know better than I would.<eos> Wait.<eos> Time's up.<eos> It's open.<eos> Mr. Fenton.<eos> You really have a thing for me, don't you?<eos> You here to gloat, Mr. Crawford?<eos> You compromised my lab and my cases... just to get back at me?<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Reina. What are you doing here?<eos> Can't I just pop in for a visit?<eos> I'd invite you to stay, but it's not my house, and Genevieve hates it when I have guests.<eos> Mm-hmm. Well, good thing she's in Mykonos.<eos> I didn't even realize you had a sister.<eos> She's an evil bruja.<eos> You're a leech, and I want nothing to do with you.<eos> Aah! Zoila!<eos> And you'll need to stay off that ankle for a couple of weeks.<eos> Do you have anybody who could take care of you?
Already did.<eos> Zoila, I don't understand.<eos> If your sister's here, why did I need to fly across the world?<eos> Because... you've been much more of a sister to me than Reina's ever been.<eos> I'd much rather have you around.<eos> Oh. Well, that's lovely.<eos> It's how I feel.<eos> So...could you ask her to leave?<eos> What?<eos> It's your house. It'd be so much easier coming from you.
Did Zoila put you up to this?<eos> Well... she's very grateful to you for all your efforts, just not grateful enough to let you stay.<eos> I don't know why I'm surprised.<eos> Zoila has always been extremely selfish.<eos> Now, now. That's not fair.<eos> Oh, it's not?<eos> You think she considered your feelings when she dragged you back here from your big vacation?<eos> She needed me.<eos> You may not know this, but we have a very special bond.<eos> Some bond. She complained about you the entire time you were gone.
A week ago, but you didn't call for my help until you couldn't stand your sister anymore.<eos> Okay, that's...true.<eos> But I really am glad you're here.<eos> You tricked me into coming back so I'd get rid of Reina.<eos> But she's a very nice person.<eos> And I won't do it.<eos> I'm not your puppet.<eos> Okay, this is what Reina does.<eos> She turns people against each other. She told me you'd say that.<eos> She's taking advantage of you.
Mango lollipop.<eos> I hope you like it.<eos> It was my favorite when I was growing up in México.<eos> You had these before?<eos> Mm-hmm. I love them.<eos> But they don't have these in Argentina.<eos> You grew up in México, didn't you, Katy?<eos> Mm. _<eos> _<eos> I have something for you, too.
Whoa.<eos> Hold on. That's just rude.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> Stars aren't scared of success.<eos> They're not always the most talented or the most beautiful, but they're hungry.<eos> That's what separates them from the nobodies.<eos> They don't care what stands in their way or whose throat they have to cut.<eos> They will do anything to be famous.<eos> That's what a star is, Carmen.<eos> But obviously, that's not you.

Javi's never been married.<eos> He didn't tell you.<eos> God, this is awkward.<eos> [Sighs] I should go.<eos> I don't suppose you could leave the crab cakes?<eos> [Ringing]<eos> - Hello? - Hi, Gail.<eos> - Hey, Marisol.<eos> How are you?<eos> - Good. Listen, I think I may have found another housekeeper for you.
- What do you mean?<eos> - Well, you got to understand, she was in a coma for four months.<eos> Her condition is really delicate.<eos> The hospital released her.<eos> Yeah, but the shock of seeing you could send her right back.<eos> I mean, my God, she thinks that you're dead.<eos> You can't keep me away from Rosie forever.<eos> It's not forever.<eos> Just... just...<eos> for a little while. Give me some time to figure out how to tell her about you.
Well, I'm sure it does.<eos> It's just that, Genevieve, I was hoping to talk to you alone.<eos> I'd prefer it if she stayed for emotional support.<eos> Okay, it's just that this isn't the sort of thing that I would normally discuss with company.<eos> I can wait out in the hall. No!<eos> I need her.<eos> So, whatever you have to say, go ahead and say it.<eos> She's not leaving my side.<eos> All right.<eos> The truth is, I called you in today because... you are the most beautiful woman I have ever met and I think I have fallen in love with you.
I didn't -- i didn't mean to wake you.<eos> [ sniffles ]<eos> Are you sad again?<eos> Uh, katy, sweetie, i-i need to --<eos> I need to finish this call, and, uh, And then i'll tuck you into bed again, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's my daughter.<eos> No, because i don't believe you.
Now electrocute me!<eos> Ique viejo verde asqueroso!<eos> Shame i didn't understand that.<eos> Sounded positively scathing.<eos> Mr. Powell, i'm no expert, but doesn't this seem dangerous?<eos> Extremely.<eos> That's the point.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> I'm gonna punish you by not doing this.<eos> You've been naughty, so no shock for you, niño.
[ sniffles ] There were times i thought everything would be easier<eos> [ inhales deeply ] But when i thought i might lose it...<eos> Her.<eos> When i thought something was gonna happen to her today... I realized...<eos> You love her.<eos> [ cries ] Here you go.<eos> [ chuckles ] oh, my god!<eos> She's perfect. All right, no more surfing down the stairs, please?<eos> And you'll need to stay off that ankle for a couple of weeks.<eos> Do you have anybody who can take care of you?
Hey, jesse.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Is this about the other night? Yes.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> I made... An advance on you.<eos> Are you serious? I thought we were having a moment, And i got carried away.<eos> I hope you will accept my apology, and we can move on.<eos> No. I don't accept.<eos> I'm trying to make things right here, jesse.<eos> [ sighs ] If anything, i was afraid of taking advantage of you.
Nonsense.<eos> If anything, it deserves an "ooh, la, la, la, la."<eos> Oh, my god. I made it worse.<eos> Made what worse?<eos> Dr. Neff, it seems like you say "ooh, la, la" a lot.<eos> Nobody's ever told you it's a little... Ridiculous?<eos> On the contrary -- everybody loves it.<eos> In fact, genevieve finds it very endearing.<eos> You don't think so?<eos> Look, genevieve is crazy about you.
You don't?<eos> Well, it's a little flat.<eos> Didn't your mother teach you how to attract a man?<eos> Mother was blind.<eos> Oh. Because of her diabetes.<eos> That must be very challenging.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Marisol said the nicest things about you.<eos> Oh, she said...<eos> Things about you, too.
You want me to put a stop to it? Get them to take it inside?<eos> How?<eos> I'm the greatest housekeeper who ever lived.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> Can i help you?<eos> Well, i hate to ask you this,<eos> But would it possible to bring the dog inside?<eos> I'm trying to rest before my due date.<eos> Oh, i'm so sorry.<eos> Look at you and your tiny, little miracle.
Now just hold on.<eos> There must be something we can do.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Yes, Deion.<eos> I took funny pictures of you.<eos> Not now, sweetheart.<eos> No, no, look, she was acting all weird.<eos> I think your boss would like to see these pictures.<eos> Deion, give that to me. Not so fast.<eos> We'll keep them safe for you, provided Deion can remain in our custody.
We pay extra for the smell.<eos> You have a very refined palette.<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Powell.<eos> You know, you don't have to call me "Mrs. Powell."<eos> Why don't you call me "Mom"?<eos> Okay, Mom.<eos> Mr. Dresden?<eos> Adrian Powell.<eos> How's the P.I. business? Good.<eos> Good, good, good. Listen, I have a job for you.
I'm docking your pay.<eos> - You can't do that.<eos> - Oh, yes, I can. I'm subtracting a substantial yet arbitrary amount of money from your check.<eos> So, you can punish me and not your kid?<eos> And now I'm doubling the amount for talking back to me.<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Hello, Rosie. Mr. Michael, I didn't know you'd be coming over today.<eos> Well, I'm checking out of the hotel tomorrow.<eos> I just needed to pick up a few things.<eos> Oh, uh, Rosie, this is Olivia Rice. Oh, yes. I have... heard about you.
I'll handle it.<eos> Deion, why don't you get washed up for lunch?<eos> I'm talking to you, young man.<eos> Mother...<eos> Carmen, I need you to punish Deion for me.<eos> I heard him cursing at one of his video games.<eos> - Mrs. Powell...<eos> So, here's an artisanal lemongrass body bar. - Huh?<eos> - I want him to learn his lesson. But I see no reason he shouldn't have the best.<eos> If you want Deion to learn a lesson, it has to come from you. Oh!
Me neither.<eos> - Here and here. - Mm-hmm.<eos> He's written out the check to cash,<eos> - and not mentioned it to me. - Right.<eos> Do you think I'm overreacting to this?<eos> Unfortunately, no, I don't think you are, actually.<eos> Oh. What do I do now?<eos> Well, you know what, I'll give it to someone, someone the pastor doesn't know, someone he won't recognize.<eos> Yes, but... but when they report, they'll give the information back to you first?<eos> They'll talk to me, I'll tell you, and we'll figure it out, okay?
Anybody know a Wanda Hartley?<eos> Here I come to save the day.<eos> Detective Squad.<eos> What? This one she one's from eight years ago.<eos> How long has this girl been missing?<eos> - Well, here's another girl arrested in the same wagon as Caroline.<eos> Black hair, brown eyes, gives her address as 2800 Fountain.<eos> Tattoo of a butterfly on her shoulder.<eos> Also known as Laney Watson and Lois Miller.<eos> Does that mean something to you?
Previously on Power...<eos> When Nomar was dying, he told me who stabbed him.<eos> Angela, a federal prosecutor.<eos> A goddamn United States Attorney.<eos> I know about you and your track record on this Lobos case.
Previously on Power...<eos> When Nomar was dying, he told me who stabbed him.<eos> Angela, a federal prosecutor.<eos> A goddamn United States Attorney.<eos> I know about you and your track record on this Lobos case.<eos> You're not only no longer leading the Lobos task force, you're not on it at all.<eos> Angela, there was a shooting tonight at the club.<eos> - Oh, my God, Jamie, are you...<eos> - I'm okay.<eos> What if that bullet was meant for you?
Except, you know, technically I would be in charge.<eos> What do you want from me in exchange for your generosity?<eos> You'll run the place just like you did when you owned it outright.<eos> You know, what you do with the music and the mix of people.<eos> Except now you'll report directly to me.<eos> Mmm, Simon.<eos> Or I can terminate your lease and you can take the Truth name and find another space, build it out, get it permitted if you have the money to do that.<eos> But I think we both know that you don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll work for you.
Maybe you should get that approved by Stern first.<eos> Stern doesn't know what the fuck he wants until you give it to him.<eos> I'm making Stern all the money he wants while getting my fucking club back and shoving my foot up his ass.<eos> You good with that?<eos> Sure thing, boss.<eos> Okay, how do you want me to go at him?<eos> I don't want you to do anything at all.<eos> What are the charges?<eos> We both know what you do.<eos> But I'm not here to talk about you.
You're all responsible.<eos> His feet were on the ground.<eos> He could have stood up, saved himself.<eos> No second thoughts.<eos> He's been waiting for this day for 20 years.<eos> And it finally came.<eos> Detective Bosch, want to make a statement?<eos> - Stay back from him, please.<eos> - It's all right. Yeah.<eos> Thanks to you and your story, - Trent killed himself.
No second thoughts.<eos> He's been waiting for this day for 20 years.<eos> And it finally came.<eos> Detective Bosch, want to make a statement?<eos> - Stay back from him, please.<eos> - It's all right. Yeah.<eos> Thanks to you and your story, - Trent killed himself.<eos> - Are you saying that he wasn't a suspect?<eos> - That he was innocent?<eos> - I'm saying that thanks to you and your irresponsible reporting, we may never know what happened to that little boy up on the hill.
In any other of our subjects this might be called treason!<eos> It was Rochefort who advised the Queen to write to Spain.<eos> This girl is either a fantasist or a liar.<eos> Your Majesty, she was there, she witnessed every word.<eos> Your Majesty should listen to the Queen.<eos> You can't trust this man.<eos> He is the only one I can trust.<eos> Now go.<eos> ~ But... sire...<eos> ~ I can hardly bear to look at you.
Tell them.<eos> Not here.<eos> I have found nothing to incriminate Aramis and the Queen.<eos> Then you haven't been looking hard enough.<eos> But it no longer matters.<eos> I have everything I need.<eos> Some new fashion I missed?<eos> I'm not sure it'll catch on in the salons of Paris.<eos> You think me a suitable target for your humour?<eos> Hmm? I am ridiculous to you?
Any one of these charges would carry at least 15 years.<eos> How much time you'd serve would depend on if the sentences were consecutive or concurrent.<eos> Some drug dealer was attacking Carter. I was defending him.<eos> The D.A.'s office wants Carter Nix for the murder of Matt Skokie.<eos> They're willing to discuss a plea deal with you in exchange for testimony against Carter.<eos> The co-conspirator, Hector Tontz...<eos> He's already cut himself a deal.<eos> Aubrey, it's not just murder.<eos> They're calling what your boyfriend did a hate crime.<eos> You have got to help yourself while you can.
All right, get him up.<eos> Real stupid.<eos> Why are you hounding my son?<eos> - That's not what we're doing.<eos> - No, I watch the news.<eos> You messed everything else up with that boy who got killed, and now you wanna make yourselves look good by making my son look like a thug.<eos> - Mr. Gutiérrez...<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> You won't get away with this.<eos> I'm taking you all to court, and I'm coming after you personally.
Originally?<eos> Oklahoma.<eos> Well...<eos> I'm sure Mark must have, uh...<eos> Well, I'm not sure what he's told you about me.<eos> He's told me a lot.<eos> He was very specific.<eos> You should know that I love my son, but he's distressed.<eos> We're going through a difficult time right now.<eos> The things he... said about you, he was saying them way before Matt was killed.
And I believe a preliminary examination has been scheduled, and your brother's lawyers will be able to make all the arguments you brought up.<eos> After that, there'll be a trial.<eos> They'll be opportunities for appeals.<eos> So, sooner or later, the courts might get it right?<eos> The mayor, all of us in his office, are informed but objective.<eos> It's the obligation of your brother's defense to argue against the new evidence.<eos> What new evidence?<eos> Any relevant information will be made available to both parties.<eos> This is a county matter, not a city matter.<eos> Other than being sympathetic, I... I'm not sure what the mayor's office could do for you.
But she... she hears that from me, and...<eos> Right now I'm doing everything I can to keep my daughter well and healthy, and I'm not getting involved in your trouble.<eos> Now wait a second.<eos> Wait a second here. When you want... you wanted Matt's body buried in Oakland, damn it, I got involved, and that put me in a bad space.<eos> You lied to me about your son. Oh, come on.<eos> I...<eos> You lied about his drug use, about his issues.<eos> You lied on your job application.<eos> I needed a job to pay for a lawyer so I could fight for my own son's body...<eos> For you. I did that for you and your family.
He used it to control me.<eos> You know, it all started with fear.<eos> He liked to get me drunk, said I seemed happier like that.<eos> He liked to make me happy, he said.<eos> He kept me wasted so I couldn't do anything when his friends came over.<eos> I would get passed around, and I couldn't defend myself.<eos> I begged for them to stop.<eos> But they covered my mouth and laughed while they pounded away.<eos> This happened all the time.<eos> Carter got you drunk, and he and his friends sexually abused you?
Without her, I'd be just another black man thrown in prison and forgotten.<eos> She got you to come here, right?<eos> Kind of blows my mind what she and the people she's working with are doing for me.<eos> Your sister plans to hold a march in downtown Modesto tomorrow, just ahead of your preliminary examination, which will determine whether or not your case goes to trial.<eos> Is your sister trying to sway opinion?<eos> She's just showing support.<eos> She claims city leaders are conspiring to prevent the rally.<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If hundreds of African-American protestors get arrested, it's news, and that's good for you.
They're going to convict him.<eos> His sister's gonna flood this town with people.<eos> They aren't gonna kill Carter.<eos> They can't kill him.<eos> The city is willing to allow for a legally permitted free-speech rally in Gallo Park for up to 150 people.<eos> Gallo Park?<eos> That's outside the city.<eos> It's a well-known area, easily accessible, lots of parking for the press and for participants.<eos> You would have full use of city and county facilities.<eos> Less work for you, lower cost, safer, and you could avoid arrests.
- Who tipped you off?<eos> - Jim Matthews' flack.<eos> Matthews is turning on us? What's it say?<eos> "President Underwood has undermined the separation of powers and put the fate of the entire East Coast in Hurricane Faith's hands.<eos> I am joining with the Governors of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland--"<eos> That's enough.<eos> I don't need to hear any more.<eos> See how many governors you can get on the phone in 30 minutes.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - I've got something else for you, sir. The AmWorks case studies.
And if she can't be trusted, I can't force her to reveal things she doesn't want to.<eos> You convinced me to make the deal with her in the first place.<eos> We needed information.<eos> She had access.<eos> And now she's lying to us.<eos> Maybe you should speak with her before we consider this a crisis.<eos> I don't like your tone, Remy.<eos> - You're blowing this out of proportion.<eos> - Watch yourself.<eos> When I worked for you in Congress, you always told me to be straight up with you.
You owe your staff that same respect.<eos> I gave you a position in the White House when no one would touch you. I don't owe you a damn thing.<eos> How long you gonna hang that over my head?<eos> - Oh, it's like you want me to fire you.<eos> - You couldn't, and you know it.<eos> Not right now.<eos> Seth and I are the only two soldiers you have.<eos> - Get Jackie on the phone.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Sir, Congresswoman Sharp calling for you.
I mean, h-hold it.<eos> L-l-let me see it again. The fact that you lied about this...<eos> Now... n-n-now hol...<eos> Hold up. Everything else that you said is inadmissible.<eos> I mean, I-I-it looked like that, all right?<eos> I-I...<eos> I mean, you're coming up here in the middle of the night. - Come on.<eos> - The deal is off.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no.<eos> - The charges against you in Sinaloa are being reinstated. No, no, y-you signed the papers.
He had to get you to do it?<eos> We want my brother fully exonerated. We want him released right now.<eos> You understand there's going to be civil action against this office.<eos> If a mistake's been made, it will be corrected.<eos> But a murder was committed, and someone will be punished.<eos> You have a confession.<eos> From here on, Carter is being falsely imprisoned.<eos> Aubry Taylor, you're under arrest for the suspicion of murder.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
I wanted to warn you.<eos> They're going to say more things about your brother.<eos> I don't know if you care anymore, but I wanted you to be ready.<eos> They may let the man out again.<eos> I've begged your father not to bother you, but...<eos> I'm around.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mr. Gutlérrez.<eos> Mr. Hall.<eos> What can I do for you?
Wasn't a real good system, the one I was in.<eos> Do you need me to get graphic about the abuse?<eos> Did you abuse yourself?<eos> I had people doing it for me.<eos> Did you abuse yourself with drugs or alcohol?<eos> Did I put my brain to sleep so I didn't have to be aware of the... that was happening to me?<eos> You were taken out of the system by the Taylor family?<eos> - Did the abuse continue?<eos> Are you talking about my brother?<eos> I'm talking about you.
You got it on you?<eos> Of course. Yeah.<eos> (Clears throat) Glenn?<eos> Glenn, you're gonna want to get out here.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I...<eos> Hi, um...<eos> Uh, do you mind if I come in real quick?<eos> I think this is for you.
Glenn, you're gonna want to get out here.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I...<eos> Hi, um...<eos> Uh, do you mind if I come in real quick?<eos> I think this is for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sorry about this.<eos> It's not that I don't trust you, just... I want to be sure.
Ah, there's no point.<eos> He just wants to screw me.<eos> -He's dying to screw me...<eos> -(Speaking Spanish)<eos> (Speaking Spanish)<eos> Salazar is a self-righteous prick, but he's not wrong.<eos> You should probably tell everyone the truth.<eos> -Woman:<eos> Sam. -Yeah.<eos> Call for you.
Rampart's got a call they say is ours, 704 bus to echo.<eos> Another robbery?<eos> Unis there now!<eos> Did you get a call about this too, lieutenant?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He killed her this time.<eos> Punk shot her for five bucks.<eos> -Get over there right now, cut. -(Phone rings)<eos> This is not rampart's problem, this is our mess.<eos> Charmain: Joe, it's for you.
Not him.<eos> They were intimate.<eos> Like lovers.<eos> But you yourself were also the Musketeer's lover?<eos> We must hear you.<eos> I was.<eos> Did that affair begin when you first came to court?<eos> Soon after.<eos> When I was appointed Royal Governess to the Dauphin.<eos> His romantic interest in you only coincided with your appointment?
Mere pain is nothing.<eos> ~ I will never betray my country.<eos> ~ You already have.<eos> ~ What do you mean?<eos> ~ Does King Philip want to see his own sister murdered?<eos> Rochefort intends to kill her.<eos> She may only be hours away from her execution.<eos> The King loves his sister.<eos> If she dies, he'll want revenge.<eos> And he'll come to you first.
~ You need a friend.<eos> ~ I have many friends.<eos> And they will come for me as they did for Constance.<eos> Oh, they will not come.<eos> There is only you and I now.<eos> In Spain, there was a man who led my torture.<eos> Every day, Vargas and I would cross new thresholds of torment together.<eos> Do you know why it took so long for him to break me?<eos> You.<eos> The mere thought of you was a refuge from my agony.

I did not think of you once.
Now you know something of the agony I endure every minute of every day.<eos> God, if you spare her and by some miracle, I'm allowed to live, I vow to devote all my remaining days to your grace.<eos> I will renounce all worldly temptations. I will...<eos> Even my duty...<eos> I'm not worthy... of your mercy.<eos> My soul is prepared.<eos> God works in mysterious ways, does he not?<eos> The Queen?<eos> Alive.<eos> No thanks to you.
Cover!<eos> Come on!<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee...<eos> Hello?<eos> Holy Mary, Mother of God... .. pray for us sinners... .. now... and at the hour of our death.<eos> Amen.<eos> Guards?<eos> If this is to be my end, I would rather be shot than stabbed.<eos> It's the end, Your Majesty.<eos> But not for you.
Or the Lady Marguerite?<eos> She took her own life because of you.<eos> It is finished.<eos> The French King knows everything.<eos> You have betrayed me?<eos> You left me no choice.<eos> Surrender.<eos> Liars.<eos> Yours are the lies, Rochefort.<eos> And they will join you in your grave.
I'd need a mirror to find a better likeness!<eos> And you have been grievously wronged, Aramis.<eos> ~ And I'm sorry for it.<eos> ~ You have no cause to apologise, Sire.<eos> I am... your humble servant.<eos> Spoken like a true soldier of France.<eos> We have urgent business to discuss, Treville.<eos> You are safe now, Majesty.<eos> ~ You're both safe.<eos> ~ Thanks to you.
Your I.P. address was embedded in the firmware update.<eos> It's shocking, I know.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I-I... We also know why you started those fires.<eos> You were recently fired as an I.T. professor there.<eos> And now you work here.<eos> Oh. Y-You're looking for Dave.<eos> I-I think he might be in the back...<eos> Yeah, I wouldn't try that, Dave.<eos> If you do make it past us, there's a SWAT team outside, and they will shoot you on sight.
- What's your name?<eos> Deva Hopewell.<eos> - You the mayor's kid?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Miss Hopewell.<eos> Hey, hey, stop.<eos> Miss Hopewell, you are under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say or do will be held against you in a court of law.
Look, there are higher forces at work here, Liv.<eos> If you don't stay out of it, you're going to wind up getting hurt.<eos> Hey.<eos> Ravi, right?<eos> We, uh, kind of met last week.<eos> Of course.<eos> Uh, Liv's ex-fiance.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Is that gonna be weird for you, by the way?
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'<eos> The novelty of Hannibal Lecter has waned.<eos> This fellow, there is something so universal about what he does.<eos> This freak is in phase with the moon.<eos> We might have a little more than three weeks before he does it again.<eos> I don't think about this anymore.<eos> I don't think I can be of any use to you, Jack.
- You've read about it.<eos> - I've read the papers.<eos> I can't clip them.<eos> They won't let me have scissors, of course.<eos> You want to know how he's choosing them.<eos> I thought you would have some ideas.<eos> You just came here to look at me.<eos> Came to get the old scent again.<eos> Why don't you just smell yourself?<eos> I expected more of you, Doctor.
We can detect each other from smell alone.<eos> You recognise this?<eos> My father made it. Out of bone.<eos> Your father never wished for anything but your happiness.<eos> - My father cut my throat.<eos> - Out of love.<eos> That wasn't love.<eos> Every family loves differently.<eos> Every love is unique.<eos> You deny your love for your father because of what it might mean about you.
What do they have in common?<eos> They were both happy.<eos> I sat here. And I watched them.<eos> Now are you just keeping America clean or is that evidence?<eos> You're trespassing, Freddie.<eos> I was trespassing before the blood dried.<eos> - When did they call you in?<eos> - I'm not talking to you.<eos> We're co-conspirators, Will.<eos> I died for you and your cause.
How much room does Will have, Jack?<eos> Hello?<eos> 'They know.'<eos> They're coming.<eos> Are we going?<eos> We're waiting for Will.<eos> It's important that he sees you.<eos> I want you two to be together.<eos> They'll catch us if we stay.<eos> I'm on my honour to look after you, Abigail.
And I have a complete collection of your press notices.<eos> Actually,<eos> I think of them as unfair reviews.<eos> As unfair as yours?<eos> They like to sling demeaning nicknames, don't they?<eos> Tooth Fairy.<eos> What could be more inappropriate?<eos> It would shame me for you to see that, if I didn't know that you have suffered the same distortions in the press.<eos> You've read Freddie Lounds' latest?<eos> It's not a good picture of you.

That was a very elegant gesture.<eos> Eloquent, too.<eos> Maybe the most eloquent thing I ever heard of.<eos> That tiger, this house...<eos> You're full of surprises, D.<eos> I don't think anyone at Gateway knows you at all.<eos> - Did you ask them?<eos> - No.<eos> Then how do you know nobody knows me?<eos> Because they wonder about you.
' Graham.<eos> Will Graham.<eos> 'Have you had any contact with him?<eos> ' 'He sends me greeting cards on Christian holidays and my birthday.<eos> 'He always includes a recipe.'<eos> If he does end up eating you, Bedelia, you'd have it coming.<eos> I can't blame him for doing what evolution has equipped him to do.<eos> If we just do whatever evolution equipped us to do, murder and cannibalism are morally acceptable.<eos> They are acceptable, to murderers and cannibals.<eos> And you.

I am not firmly convinced it would be in your best interest.<eos> I am not firmly convinced you give a rat's ass about my best interests!<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> I believe you are experiencing a lack of insight.<eos> I am trying to assist you in regaining enough insight that you realise that you require medication.<eos> What medication would you prescribe, Dr Du Maurier?<eos> I would prescribe exactly the medication Dr Lecter prescribed and you refused.<eos> You know, whatever this is, whatever this is, this is why Scientologists hate psychiatry.<eos> What do you think this is?<eos> Of course he would refer me to you!
Blake's Dragon stands over a pleading woman caught in the coil of its tail.<eos> Few images in Western art radiate such a unique and... nightmarish charge of demonic sexuality.<eos> The man who killed the Jacobis and the Leedses saw something in them that drew him and drove him to do it.<eos> He chose them, because something in them spoke to him.<eos> The Jacobis were the first to help him, the first to lift him into the glory of his becoming.<eos> The Jacobis were better than anything he knew.<eos> Until the Leedses.<eos> As the Dragon grows in strength and glory, there are families to come.<eos> I have to believe there is a common factor and we will find it... soon.<eos> Otherwise you have to enter more houses and see what the Dragon has left for you.
May I ask what you're researching?<eos> A paper on Butts.<eos> On Thomas Butts?<eos> You only see him in footnotes as a patron of Blake's.<eos> - Is he interesting?<eos> - I'm just beginning.<eos> We have to keep it in this box because light will fade it.<eos> That's why it's not on display often.<eos> You're not allowed to touch it.<eos> I'll display it for you.
'Previously on "Hannibal"...'<eos> You're full of surprises, D. I find you very mysterious.<eos> I am delighted that you have taken an interest in me.<eos> - I want to be recognised by you.
- He ate it?<eos> He ate it up.<eos> The Art Squad in New York snapped to it when they found out what he ate.<eos> They pulled two partial prints from the plastic pass he used.<eos> No ID, but it's still the same thumb that was on Mrs Leeds' eye.<eos> What about the docent at the museum?<eos> He had a sweet touch with her.<eos> She had to have four stitches. - Mild concussion, but he didn't kill her.<eos> - Why?<eos> He'd have been better off killing her. And you.
You must know something about him otherwise you wouldn't have found him.<eos> Jack Crawford fisher of men, watching my cork move against the current.<eos> You got me again.<eos> Hannibal told me where to find him.<eos> He knows.<eos> He knows who the Dragon is.<eos> He probably treated him.<eos> It stunned me the first time I saw it.<eos> Like Blake peeked in your ear and saw the Red Dragon there.<eos> Coiled inside you.

Is it true?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> It bothers you, finding that out?<eos> Because I married your mum?<eos> Then you shouldn't put this guy in a mental hospital, you should kill him.<eos> I want to watch baseball.<eos> His team playing?<eos> He read about me in a Freddie Lounds article.<eos> I had to justify myself to an eleven-year-old.<eos> Resentment's raising a blister in you, Will.
I had to justify myself to an eleven-year-old.<eos> Resentment's raising a blister in you, Will.<eos> You think you might lose me after this, Jack?<eos> You think I might go back to my family?<eos> - For a minute, I did.<eos> - Right...<eos> Then you realised what I realised, which is I can't go home.<eos> And neither can Molly and Walter, not until the Red Dragon is out of the way.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> You have a telephone call.
How's the wife?<eos> I look at my wife and I see her dead.<eos> I see Mrs Leeds and Mrs Jacobi lying where Molly should be.<eos> Do you see yourself killing her?<eos> Yes. Over and over.<eos> It's hard to predict when brittle materials will break.<eos> Hannibal gave you three years to build a family, confident that he would find a way to take them from you.<eos> And he has.<eos> What's he going to take from you?<eos> Is it important to you that he take something from me?
If you play you pay.<eos> You have paid dearly.<eos> It excites him to know that you are marked in this particular way.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why do you think?<eos> Bluebeard's wife.<eos> Secrets you're not to know, yet sworn to keep.<eos> If I'm to be Bluebeard's wife, I would have preferred to be the last.<eos> Is Hannibal in love with me?<eos> Could he daily feel a stab of hunger for you and find nourishment at the very sight of you?
What's got your attention, Doctor?<eos> God, the Devil and the Great Red Dragon?<eos> Lest we forget the Lamb.<eos> Will is the Lamb of God?<eos> Hide us from the wrath of the Lamb.<eos> Who's "us"?<eos> You, me and the Great Red Dragon.<eos> The Lamb's wrath touches everyone who errs.<eos> His retribution is even more deadly than the Dragon's.<eos> It is for you.
No.<eos> Nemesis?<eos> No.<eos> - You refuted my entire book.<eos> - It didn't hold up to scrutiny.<eos> Of course it didn't, I was lying!<eos> On your behalf!<eos> To save your life!<eos> You refuted your insanity defence.<eos> I went out on a limb for you and you climbed up there and sawed it off!
"and a man becomes famous because he has the proper stuff in him."<eos> You don't have the proper stuff, Frederick.<eos> I am a best-selling author.<eos> The journals only still publish your writing for the freak value of your by-line.<eos> The attention given to you is dwindling since you have been overshadowed by another creature.<eos> That book is writing itself.<eos> I think I'll call it The Dragon Slayer.<eos> All I need is the ending.<eos> Fate has a habit of not letting us choose our own endings, Frederick.<eos> This is the ending fate has chosen for you.

Your teeth will go and your strength.<eos> Nobody will be afraid of you anymore.<eos> After Dr Bloom's reign, you will be out in the ward.<eos> The young ones will push you around and use you for sex.<eos> All you'll get to read is what you write on the wall.<eos> You have seen the old ones.<eos> They cry when they do not like the stewed apricots.<eos> I'm just going to leave an extra copy of my book right over here.<eos> Thank you, Frederick.<eos> I've personalised it for you.
By refuting him, you orchestrated his end by proxy.<eos> You orchestrated his end, Alana.<eos> You saw the hole and let him roll right into it.<eos> That's professional discourtesy.<eos> 'I have had a great privilege.<eos> 'I have seen with wonder and awe 'the strength of the Great Red Dragon.<eos> 'All that I said was lies from Will Graham.<eos> 'I have blasphemed against the Dragon.<eos> 'Even so, the Dragon is merciful.<eos> 'Because I was forced to lie, 'he will be more merciful to me than to you, Will Graham.

Do you have to wonder?<eos> No.<eos> What did you think the Great Red Dragon would do?<eos> You were curious what would happen, that's apparent.<eos> Is this what you were expecting?<eos> I can't say I am surprised.<eos> Then you may as well have struck the match.<eos> That's participation.<eos> Hannibal Lecter does have agency in the world.<eos> He has you.
I've been with a few.<eos> The blind attract them.<eos> Not just the blind.<eos> Ding-dong, the Dragon's dead.<eos> - Are congratulations in order?<eos> - I didn't kill him.<eos> Suicide.<eos> Then he wasn't as strong as the Dragon after all.<eos> He was trying to stop.<eos> I was rooting for you, Will.
He was trying to stop.<eos> I was rooting for you, Will.<eos> It's a shame.<eos> You came all this way and you didn't get to kill anybody.<eos> Only consolation is Dr. Chilton.<eos> Congratulations for the job you did on him.<eos> I admired it enormously.<eos> What a cunning boy you are.<eos> Are you accusing me of something?<eos> Does the enemy inside you agree with the accusation?
I don't intend Hannibal to be caught a second time.<eos> Can't live with him.<eos> Can't live without him.<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> I guess this is my Becoming.<eos> What you are "becoming" is pathological.<eos> Extreme acts of cruelty require a high degree of empathy.<eos> You've just found religion.<eos> Nothing more dangerous than that.<eos> I'd pack my bags if I were you, Bedelia.
Just enough to hang me.<eos> Who does Will Graham have you roping now?<eos> Hannibal.<eos> Tethers, if I had them, I would burn the man alive.<eos> Though, maybe I would rather have his skin.<eos> I've been getting grafts.<eos> How I would love to count Hannibal among my donors.<eos> You were never comfortable in your own skin, Frederick.<eos> You wouldn't be comfortable in Hannibal's.<eos> There's a deal for you, Hannibal.
Was it Will's idea?<eos> Yes.<eos> That worked out so well for Frederick Chilton.<eos> Do please tell Frederick, if you see him, I wish a speedy convalescence and hope he won't be very ugly.<eos> I've been on the phone for hours on your behalf, and this is what you get...<eos> Any rational society would either kill me or give me my books.<eos> If you cooperate in the capture of Francis Dolarhyde, you get your books, your drawings.<eos> Your toilet. All privileges will be restored.<eos> You trust Will with my well-being?<eos> As much as I trust you with his.
That little extra bit at the end.<eos> What was that you said?<eos> You'd never have turned yourself in unless I rejected you.<eos> Yes. That extra bit.<eos> I believe that's what they call a "mic drop."<eos> You dropped the mic, Will, but here you are having to come back and pick it up again.<eos> I knew you would keep running if I kept chasing you.<eos> I knew you wanted me to know exactly where I could find you when I needed to.<eos> And you did.<eos> I need you, Hannibal.
And you did.<eos> I need you, Hannibal.<eos> Ding-dong. The Dragon's not dead.<eos> He told you he wanted to meet you.<eos> Maybe that was a serious invitation.<eos> After the big escape, you send a message to the Dragon in the personal ads, - ask him for a rendezvous.<eos> - He won't go near a mail drop.<eos> He might be curious enough to look at one, see if you sold him.<eos> We chose a drop that can be watched only from a few places a long way off, and we'll stake out the observation points.<eos> It sounds weak to you, even as you say it.
And the bluff is still eroding.<eos> You and I are suspended over the roiling Atlantic.<eos> Soon all of this will be lost to the sea.<eos> You're playing games with yourself in the dark of the moon.<eos> Wasn't surprising that I heard from the Great Red Dragon.<eos> Was it surprising when you heard from him?<eos> Yes and no.<eos> You intend to watch him kill me?<eos> I intend to watch him change you.<eos> My compassion for you is inconvenient, Will.
Suicide is the enemy.<eos> You were seized by a fantasy world with the brilliance and freshness and immediacy of childhood.<eos> It took you a step beyond alone.<eos> I'm going to film your death, Dr. Lecter,<eos> as dying, you meld with the strength of the Dragon.<eos> It's a glorious and rather discomforting idea.<eos> Watching the film will be wonderful, but not as wonderful as the act itself.<eos> It really does look black in the moonlight.<eos> See.<eos> This is all I ever wanted for you, Will.
The power is certainly still in there.<eos> You know, I read his book in high school.<eos> We all read his book.<eos> His book was bullshit.<eos> Let me know if he says anything new at the next awake and aware period.<eos> I thought it was a good book.<eos> Tell her I'm not a criminal!<eos> Are you not a criminal?<eos> You ran from the police.<eos> You said that I could trust you, and then you sold me out to the cops.
Now, hold up, hold up, hold up!<eos> What the fuck is going on here? This.<eos> This is what's going on.<eos> That supposed to mean something to me?<eos> It would if you could read.<eos> You know how many lives I've saved?<eos> How many cops I've saved?<eos> Don't flash that crackerjack shit at me.<eos> It's a party, so ease up on the kid.<eos> I got some crackerjack shit for you.
Hiding under your bed?<eos> If you were half the king Jason was, you would govern from your throne, not your bed!<eos> My father's bed!<eos> Your throne...<eos> Come on!<eos> Put it back!<eos> You knew it was here?<eos> How did you solve its riddle?<eos> You, Father, lie in your bed, but you sit on the throne of the first King of Athens.<eos> His ashes may have been scattered on the wind, but he lives on through his descendants, through you, through this throne.
Trust me, you will talk.<eos> You'll both talk.<eos> Damn!<eos> you can hold your hokk for a Qreshi!<eos> - No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> Are you a born Westie?<eos> Fifth generation.<eos> Wow, so your grandkids are seventh gen?<eos> Good for you!
Are you a born Westie?<eos> Fifth generation.<eos> Wow, so your grandkids are seventh gen?<eos> Good for you!<eos> Damn right.<eos> They'll be making the jump to Leith when they open the gates.<eos> Got a nice little plot picked out for them there already.<eos> Company's been good to me in that way.<eos> They should be.<eos> Can't be easy for you, putting on that uniform, policing your own people for them every day.
Town didn't lose my father.<eos> I killed him to protect it.<eos> So if the reason you're here is to see how I'm doing since the dome came down, ridding myself of my father was the best thing I've ever done.<eos> Now, if you don't mind...<eos> I'm just curious.<eos> If ridding yourself of your father is the best thing you've ever done, why haven't you sold his house?<eos> Lady, why do you even care?<eos> Because like it or not, James Rennie, you belong here.<eos> You're part of this town.<eos> You're part of a community that needs you right now.
To earn... your forgiveness.<eos> Her name's Angie.<eos> You haven't said her name once.<eos> It's Angie.<eos> And you killed her.<eos> - Joe, I-I...<eos> - No.<eos> You don't get to speak.<eos> It's my turn.<eos> I didn't come here for you, or to hear about how you're getting on with your life...
- But you were not affected by the spores?<eos> No, sir.<eos> These microbes, or spores, as you call them, have been definitively confirmed as alien life-forms?<eos> Yes, Senator, and without a doubt, there is life out there.<eos> How can you be certain that the threat to Earth has been contained?<eos> When the Seraphim exploded, the alien microbes were destroyed in space, and no longer pose a threat to us.<eos> So, to your best knowledge, no alien life-forms have set foot on the planet Earth?<eos> No ETs running around trying to phone home?<eos> That is correct.<eos> Well, thanks to your efforts, Dr. Woods, we owe you a debt of gratitude for showing extreme bravery in terrifying circumstances.
Several drunk and disorderlies.<eos> Well, I call that a good time but... whatever.<eos> Burning down your house.<eos> Not the whole house.<eos> And I have learned my lesson about playing with matches.<eos> Never do that when you're angry.<eos> Attacking a Ms. Julie Gelineau with a shovel.<eos> Well, she screwed my husband and then had the nerve to show up to his funeral.<eos> Now, I think I should be committed if I didn't smack her.<eos> Molly, we know this has been a profoundly difficult year for you.
I'm not sure you grasp the gravity of Ms. Wood's condition.<eos> I'm not gonna ask her to operate heavy machinery.<eos> You do realize... that you are taking an unstable woman into custody.<eos> She's an arsonist, escape artist, prone to violent outbursts.<eos> Sounds like my ex-wife.<eos> Well, she's on a prescriptive schedule that'll require strict supervision.<eos> You got it.<eos> Blues at 10:00, reds at 7:00.<eos> I'll have her back in 72 hours, no worse for the wear.<eos> Molly Woods. After you.
Doing... Photography.<eos> Then he killed himself.<eos> That tell you enough?<eos> Were you molesting Brian Kamens?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Father Bernard confronted you about what you did to Brian, - and he was gonna report you.<eos> - I did not touch that boy.<eos> You had to silence father Bernard because he knew your dirty little secret.<eos> How dare you?<eos> I humiliated myself in court for you, father.
No. Andrew, ple... don't. Please.<eos> I'm sorry. It's done.<eos> You can fix this still, right?<eos> Agnes, stop.<eos> I love you. That is what's...<eos> It's done.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I don't love you.<eos> I made my decision, so please just leave.<eos> Sorry I couldn't be a better client for you.
- Teen offenders with multiple arrests... - Why Rebecca's DNA...<eos> - The photos of Sam to pin the murder...<eos> Wes...<eos> I don't have anything.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> He saw Rebecca the night Lila was killed wet, and... and she dosed him with PCP because she knew he was a potential witness.<eos> PCP doesn't put you in a mental institution.<eos> Rebecca's right.<eos> And where's the actual evidence that this was a crime of passion?<eos> Or are we supposed to just trust you, Mr. Walsh?
He came to us so innocent.<eos> And he believed you when you said you didn't do it.<eos> But now he's grown up.<eos> You and I have made him grow up.<eos> Rebecca, tell me what happened that night.<eos> That's all you need to do to do right by him.<eos> I did it.<eos> I killed Lila.<eos> Or maybe Sam did it.<eos> That'd be easier for you, right?
But you need another shot.<eos> What is it for? .<eos> Tetanus shot.<eos> How's your wound? .<eos> Getting infected. But I'll survive.<eos> I heard you need some shots.<eos> Two of them.<eos> Thank you, Captain. For?<eos> .<eos> If not for you, things might not turn out this way.
Well, I'll need to use your phone then to call my family and tell them that I'm safe here and make sure they're okay.<eos> Michelle, they're not okay.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Everyone outside of here is dead.<eos> But what about you?<eos> Don't you have a family?<eos> Who's that?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What did you do?<eos> You know what, Michelle? I'm gonna tell you what I told him.
You should go to your room now.<eos> This next part isn't something you need to see.<eos> Michelle?<eos> Hey.<eos> I thought we'd change things up tonight and have dessert before dinner.<eos> After all, we can do whatever we want now.<eos> Would you like a cone or a bowl?<eos> Megan always wanted hers in a bowl.<eos> She said the cones were too messy.<eos> I know that this isn't the life you'd prefer, that it isn't easy for you living down here, but I want us to be a happy family.
- Oh, this is you?<eos> - It was nice to see you again.<eos> - Nice to see you too.<eos> Hey, if you're not doing anything... ..get a coffee?<eos> We're looking at your numbers.<eos> Hey.<eos> There he is.<eos> There's the man.<eos> Nate. Let me ask you a question.<eos> Mmm? If there was this girl and you wanted her to notice you...
- Hi.<eos> Anywhere?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Anywhere is fine.<eos> - Just...<eos> - OK. Thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm Holly.<eos> I'll be taking care of you today.
Apple pie.<eos> How's it going over here?<eos> - Seth.<eos> - What's that?<eos> Seth.<eos> My name is Seth.<eos> How's the food, Seth?<eos> It's good.<eos> It's quality.<eos> Actually, I had a question for you.
Just gonna leave this here.<eos> - Thanks for coming in.<eos> - Hang on... a second.<eos> But, like, when they do speak, you know you're in trouble.<eos> Hey.<eos> - There's a guy out there.<eos> - Ooh. Is he hot?<eos> - I'm serious, Claire.<eos> - Don't get paranoid on me, Hol.<eos> You're no fun when you're paranoid.
You're no fun when you're paranoid.<eos> Never mind.<eos> 10 bucks says it's him.<eos> - Yes, Eric.<eos> - Hey, babe.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Jesus!<eos> What's with the attitude?<eos> I just wanted to talk.<eos> - I've been thinking about you.
Jesus!<eos> What's with the attitude?<eos> I just wanted to talk.<eos> - I've been thinking about you.<eos> - Is he drunk and weepy again?<eos> A little bit.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> You with someone?<eos> Don't get paranoid on me, Eric.<eos> You're no fun when you're paranoid.
He's gonna kill you.<eos> But you know that.<eos> Maybe he'll lose his nerve, huh?<eos> Chicken out.<eos> - Or maybe he'll just get bored.<eos> - You're not helping.<eos> He won't even need a gun, Holly.<eos> All he has to do is walk away.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Look at you.
I might not be able to save you.<eos> What is this, some kind of fucking religious thing?<eos> Did God tell you to punish all the whores, something like that?<eos> It's a different kind of saving.<eos> - And no.<eos> - So, what?<eos> You're just a sick fuck?<eos> This is how you get your kicks?<eos> I'm not doing this for me.<eos> Doing this for you.
Good girl.<eos> It's a real page-turner.<eos> You're a hell of a writer.<eos> You know that?<eos> You're a thief.<eos> And now what?<eos> Suddenly, you've got me all figured out?<eos> I wish.<eos> No.<eos> Mostly, I just felt sorry for you.
You know who believes that?<eos> People who hate themselves.<eos> Who are alone, depressed.<eos> Just like you.<eos> - Think I hate myself?<eos> - I know you do.<eos> You hate yourself so much, you can't even imagine how fucked up someone would have to be to love you back.<eos> So you convince yourself that love is this thing that you can buy!<eos> That all you have to do is keep giving.<eos> Well, like I said, I just feel sorry for you.
The way you do two voices scared the hell out of me at first.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I know more than you think.<eos> Is she here right now?<eos> No.<eos> She's not real.<eos> You don't think I know that?<eos> I think you're starting to forget.<eos> Don't get paranoid on me, Eric.<eos> You're no fun when you're paranoid.
We're gonna be OK.<eos> We're gonna be fine.<eos> And you think that's what?<eos> A confession?<eos> I'm a writer, Seth.<eos> Fiction's kind of what I do.<eos> That's why I didn't go straight to the police.<eos> I had to be sure.<eos> I thought I'd follow you around for a few days, but you didn't make me wait long.<eos> It was a risky move, even for you.
And the Oscar goes to...<eos> He wants to save me.<eos> I have to let him think there's a chance.<eos> So that was all an act?<eos> You were just humouring him?<eos> Playing along?<eos> If you've got something to say...<eos> I'm just making sure your head's still in the game.<eos> I don't need another useless pep talk, Claire.<eos> And I don't need you.
Hey, Seth, I got your pay cheque.<eos> Still here, huh?<eos> Where's the rest?<eos> There is no rest.<eos> This is what happens when you start acting like you're in control.<eos> - That's not enough.<eos> - You don't get to decide that.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Fuck me?<eos> I go through hell for you and you threaten me?
- OK, that's great.<eos> - OK, on three. Alright?<eos> One, two, three!<eos> Fuck.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Do you know what real love is, Nate?<eos> - What?<eos> - You know, real love.<eos> Say you loved somebody but she got sick.<eos> And then someone came along one day to pull the plug on her, to take her away from you forever.
And all of a sudden, you start thinking... ..maybe it doesn't have to be this way.<eos> Maybe I don't have to be alone.<eos> And so you let go of the rope.<eos> Because this person, he's not gonna let you fall.<eos> He's gonna catch you.<eos> You know it.<eos> At least, that's what you keep telling yourself.<eos> The whole way down.<eos> Don't come back.<eos> If that's all I am to you, if I'm just a pet... ..then don't come back for me.

- What are you doing?<eos> - Open the fucking door!<eos> You're already down a finger, Seth.<eos> How much more are you ready to lose?<eos> Get back!<eos> Holly.<eos> Holly.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I believe you.
I'm not saying I'm not excited.<eos> It's, like, great to get that call.<eos> I just...<eos> Figured you'd be more psyched about this.<eos> It's a big deal, getting published.<eos> It's just a vanity press.<eos> It's not exactly the 'New Yorker'.<eos> Screw that.<eos> It's still awesome.<eos> I'm proud of you.

Just a great play.<eos> Unable to get around that defender.<eos> Colin Spencer, once again, involved in that tackle.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Thank you, babe.<eos> Hi.<eos> I had another bad day with Eric.<eos> He's still fooling around with other girls.<eos> This morning, I almost... hurt him.<eos> But then I thought of you.
- Life without my work...<eos> - Is still life.<eos> This isn't the end.<eos> There are other things that can give your life meaning.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like you?<eos> This is the part where you apologize.<eos> This is the part where you leave.<eos> Fine, I can't watch you do this to yourself anymore.<eos> Too difficult for you, is it?
Yes, it is.<eos> It breaks my heart to see you this way.<eos> - No, don't pity me.<eos> - I'm not pitying you.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Then what are you doing here... Bringing cheese and wine like we're old friends going for a picnic?<eos> We are not friends, Christine.<eos> We were barely lovers.<eos> But you just love a sob story, don't you?<eos> Is that what I am to you now?
But you will suffer.<eos> Pain's an old friend.<eos> Dormammu... I've come to bargain.<eos> End this!<eos> Dormammu... dormammu...<eos> Dormammu...<eos> You will never win.<eos> No...<eos> But I can lose... Again and again... And again...<eos> And that makes you my prisoner.
But we're looking for my father.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> So if you found Odin... You'd all return to Asgard promptly?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Promptly.<eos> Great!<eos> Allow me to help you.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> They carried you into kamar-taj on a stretcher.<eos> Look at you now, pangborn.
At least you're not wearing trousers.<eos> Oh, I would if I could.<eos> I know.<eos> Well?<eos> Rather lovely.<eos> "Rather lovely."<eos> What is it?<eos> What's amiss?<eos> You got the deer.<eos> All eyes will be on you this evening.
But this may be our final chance.<eos> lord Bernard.<eos> Secretary Bryce, this is Major Fawcett.<eos> - Major.<eos> - It's an honor, Sir.<eos> Honor's mine, Sir.<eos> May I introduce Secretary Bryce.<eos> Secretary Bryce, Mrs. Bellamy.<eos> Major and Mrs. Percy Fawcett.<eos> They're toasting the kill without you.
The jungle is about years of practice... Training, the art of soldiering.<eos> I have that.<eos> It is about maggots in your skin.<eos> It is about deadly snakes and disease that make you vomit blood.<eos> You could not bear it.<eos> And I could not bear that either.<eos> Somehow I managed to bear the dangers you faced, the years you were gone.<eos> This way at least we might be able to be together for some of our lives.<eos> You are my wife.<eos> I need you here.
Not as a tent mate in need of constant care.<eos> And in this fantasy of yours, what happens to the children?<eos> Shh. Please, try to be reasonable.<eos> You will throw "reasonable" in my face?<eos> Was it reasonable to stay here and struggle to provide for the children while you wandered the jungle?<eos> Now, you have given no thought, not one thought to my aspirations as a woman.<eos> Have you thought about that?<eos> Men and women have performed their roles since the beginning of time!<eos> It is the cornerstone of our civilization.<eos> I must say, I did expect more understanding from you, and I am disgraced by your ignorant posture.
Yes, Sir.<eos> How did you find us here?<eos> Your son, colonel.<eos> He wrote us a letter.<eos> Didn't he tell you?<eos> Good shot, Jack.<eos> Thank you, father.<eos> Getting quite expert with that rifle.<eos> Practice makes perfect, you know.<eos> I have something for you.
We leave for Portugal on the 7th, and then we meet again in Brazil.<eos> No one can best us now.<eos> Remember, the code with the coordinates is in my desk, and Mr. Costin has a copy in safekeeping.<eos> Yes, you've told me a thousand times.<eos> Now run along, or you'll miss your boat.<eos> You're a man now, responsible for your mother and sister's care.<eos> It's a fine calling, no less and perhaps even more virtuous than ours.<eos> All right?<eos> Good-bye, father.<eos> I shall indeed miss you, as I always have.
Oh, my God.<eos> - Fired!<eos> After years, years of hard work.<eos> And ass-kissing.<eos> God, I kissed so many different kinds of asses.<eos> Erin, we're sorry that you lost your job.<eos> But, I mean, there is kind of a glass is half full aspect of it.<eos> I mean, we saw a real ghost.<eos> You know, and she was beautiful.<eos> Till she dislocated her jaw and ecto-projected all over you.
Okay, we are on the cusp of something here, a real discovery.<eos> Unlike Columbia, this institute is 100% behind us.<eos> Really?<eos> Erin, this is what we have dreamed about since we were little kids.<eos> I know that if you come and join us here, they are gonna be so pumped.<eos> We just have to go upstairs and ask for more money.<eos> I just honestly didn't realize your department still existed.<eos> - What?<eos> - Come on, ghosts?<eos> I will not let the 12-year reputation of this fine institution be besmirched by you! Come on!
- We'll take it.<eos> - Great. - The rent is $21,000 a month.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - Excuse me? - I'm sorry.<eos> That's the rent? - Yeah.<eos> - Who can afford that?<eos> All your friend said was that you were looking for a place to explore the unknown.<eos> Okay, we need to explore something a lot cheaper. There's an upstairs!<eos> Are you offended by the smell of Chinese food?<eos> I have now moved above you, and you still can't help me out.
Really?<eos> When I was eight years old, the mean old lady that lived next door died.<eos> And that night, I woke up and she was standing at the foot of my bed, just staring at me.<eos> She did that every night for almost a year.<eos> What?<eos> And I told my parents, and they didn't believe me.<eos> Still don't believe me.<eos> I had to go to therapy for years, and the kids at school found out, and they would laugh at me and make fun of me, call me "ghost girl."<eos> Abby was the only person who believed me.<eos> Kids is mean, man. But I believe you.
And leave it to us.<eos> We're the big dogs.<eos> - Hey, come on, man.<eos> - I'm sorry. Sorry.<eos> Meatheads.<eos> - Unlock it.<eos> Unlock it.<eos> - Okay, wait. Hold on.<eos> Roll your window up.<eos> I'm watching you.
Missed me!<eos> Thanks, Patty.<eos> Not you guys again!<eos> Say hello to my little...<eos> What the hell?<eos> Forgot about my new toys.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You just got Holtzmanned, baby!<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm glad I didn't know any of you when you were alive, 'cause I don't enjoy any of you, especially you. Okay.

Okay.<eos> All right, Abby, let's reel it in tighter.<eos> - I don't like you either!
I was a saucier there for five years at the best restaurant.<eos> Sometimes after work, a rich woman would take me up to her room, and...<eos> The older ones, they taught me how to fuck.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> So I liked that hotel.<eos> - Stop.<eos> - "Stop"?<eos> I'm just letting you know that I have fucked some very beautiful women. Good ones.<eos> They don't worry their mommy is gonna steal me away from 'em.<eos> Two hours ago, I would've crawled through glass for you.
His wife said to me that if I... got an abortion... if I left France immediately she was going to write me a check for $400,000.<eos> So I came here a week later... and that's when I met you.<eos> And that morning... he called me, and he was begging me to let him apologize.<eos> And I had...<eos> I had no intention of fucking him.<eos> And then I... I think...<eos> I think I shut down.<eos> I just let him do it.<eos> And when it was over...<eos> I started to panic... because all I could think about was you... and what I just destroyed.
- What's your business here?<eos> - I'm here to see Madame Le Tellier.<eos> - Then give her a call.<eos> - No, it's okay. I know him.<eos> If I knew we would be talking about that troublesome little girl, I would not have invited you in.<eos> I understand.<eos> - Because you don't trust her?<eos> - Because I need to know that I can.<eos> And if I don't want to discuss it?<eos> That's up to you.
Make sure there's a martini waiting for her.<eos> I want everyone to stop for one second and just look up here, pay your respects to the man who made this all possible.<eos> Frank Riley, everyone.<eos> Raise a glass.<eos> Frank, you've really outdone yourself. Cheers.<eos> Thank you, Frank.<eos> All right, now, you just gotta do it, right?<eos> Just toss it in there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Look at you.
All right, now, you just gotta do it, right?<eos> Just toss it in there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Look at you.<eos> This is pretty cool, Frankie.<eos> This is pretty fucking cool.<eos> - Yeah, it's all right.<eos> - I'm sorry that I'm late.<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> - They need you back there.
This is pretty fucking cool.<eos> - Yeah, it's all right.<eos> - I'm sorry that I'm late.<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> - They need you back there.<eos> - Yeah, I gotta...<eos> Go.<eos> I know.<eos> We can talk later.<eos> Hazel will take care of you.
I'm back to being me.<eos> That psycho... I sent him home.<eos> That's 'cause I'm not around.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Lola...<eos> Why do you want me back?<eos> Because all the reasons to stay away... they don't work.<eos> And every day I tell myself, "Yeah, you blew it."<eos> "Get over it."<eos> And every morning when I wake up, first thing I think of is you.
Hi.<eos> Oh, when's your wedding?<eos> Eighteen months after I meet the right guy.<eos> Okay.<eos> And a wrong way to be single.<eos> And then there's this guy.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Hi. You want a hand with that?<eos> We're embarrassed to admit we're single, and try to pretend that we're not.<eos> We need you in Exam Room 3.
Yeah.<eos> Or are we just boring?<eos> I'm not boring. I'm fucking fun.<eos> I say I'm gonna do things all the time, and I never, ever do them.<eos> Like, I'm gonna learn to cook, or take a self-defense class or I'm gonna hike the Grand Canyon, and I never, ever do it.<eos> That's not my fault.<eos> You said the boots made your feet hurt.<eos> Look, if we really want this to work long term, I need to know who I am alone and I don't want to spend my life wondering "What if?"<eos> This is stupid.<eos> The minute you walk out of here you're gonna realize how much shit I do for you and how great I am and how much you need me, and you're gonna start stalking me.
That was a really bad idea.<eos> This is stupid.<eos> I should probably just go home.<eos> It's better.<eos> No, are you kidding?<eos> You have a small window in which to bang your way through New York City.<eos> No, Josh and I didn't break up so I could see other people.<eos> I'm trying to figure out who I am.<eos> Then why don't you take this, go home and stare at your beave?<eos> Look, I'm just gonna choose for you.
Yeah.<eos> Germs are little bugs, like little microbes that get into your mouth, and they make you sick.<eos> So, you eat your shoe.<eos> You are not winning me over.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Why do you put everything in your mouth?<eos> Hello. Hi.<eos> And so we're clear, there are a lot of people in this world who need things like you in their lives, to feel complete.<eos> I am not one of them.<eos> I am fine without you.
No, but... Wait, when do you meet him?<eos> That's the best part.<eos> I never, ever have to meet him, or any of his family.<eos> There's no strings attached at all.<eos> Nothing. Is that crazy?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, my God, you're gonna have a baby.<eos> I know!<eos> You're gonna have a baby!<eos> I'm so happy for you.
And now I don't know what the world would be like if it wasn't in Spanish.<eos> It's pretty easy, you know, it's...<eos> Alice.<eos> You're so handy.<eos> Alice.<eos> Michelle is a really lucky girl.<eos> I didn't expect for this to happen.<eos> I just...<eos> I stopped comparing everyone to you and then I met someone pretty great.<eos> I'm super happy for you.
No, you'll be fine, just don't hit your drink number with him.<eos> What's my drink number?<eos> In every male-female friendship, there's a total number of drinks and if you hit that, it means you will definitely have sex.<eos> So, how many drinks does it take to get you wasted?<eos> Two and a half, but maybe three, if I've eaten.<eos> Three.<eos> Okay, and Tom's is eight.<eos> So, you can't hit eleven drinks between the two of you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not one for you, 10 for him.

The slider guy.<eos> Please blink, so I know you're in there.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> God. I just have blood pumping through my body in an uncomfortable way and it feels like it's all accumulating right here.<eos> Don't touch yourself like that in my workplace.<eos> I need a man.<eos> A man?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I don't know what's happening. It's, like, the hormones or something.<eos> Actually, the new guy has sort of been checking you out.
Really, it's just a little thing that... Oh.<eos> Open it now, yeah.<eos> Whoa!<eos> These are pictures of us.<eos> It's memories of all our time together.<eos> Yeah, there's three weeks of photos.<eos> That's...<eos> And then we can fill in the rest.<eos> Oh, so...<eos> Look, Lucy, I... I really care about you.
Oh, that was terrible.<eos> You scared all the kids, terrified a lot of parents.<eos> But it was also kind of awesome.<eos> I'm George.<eos> Lucy.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi. Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Oh, thank you.
Why do people always say that?<eos> The holidays is he best time to be single.<eos> Parties every night, free-flowing booze.<eos> Mmm-hmm. Santa's beard tickling your inner thigh.<eos> What?<eos> Night.<eos> Yeah, take your jacket...<eos> Here, you want me to get your...<eos> Thanks for having us.<eos> Yeah, sure. I know it's been tough for you.
I just thought you were divorced.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> It's just been two years, okay?<eos> Phoebe's not ready for all that.<eos> I have no idea what it's like to be a parent.<eos> But, I feel like you have to open up to Phoebe about her mom.<eos> Look, Alice.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know I'm not supposed to need you anymore, but...
I feel like I don't even know who I am anymore.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I have to warn you, I have this weird farting thing happening.<eos> I don't know if it's me, or the baby farting through me, or what, but...<eos> Let me see.<eos> Hi, you stinky little baby.<eos> You know you're not gonna be able to hide this for much longer.<eos> You need to tell him.<eos> I love you, monkey.<eos> I love you.
Mom! You need to go inside.<eos> I know you've said it a million times.<eos> All right. There you go.<eos> Take her inside, and then take her home.<eos> Great to see you again.<eos> Great to see you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye, guys.<eos> It's great to see you.<eos> It's great to see you.
Actually, technically, we would have a four-year-old daughter, in which case, her name would be Rihanna.<eos> What?<eos> We haven't known each other four years.<eos> No, not you.<eos> Josh. Oh, right, yeah.<eos> But, exactly.<eos> It's the same thing with me and Lucy.<eos> It's like, if I go to work, and she's not there, I'm like mad or something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Which is nuts, because she's not completely disgusted by you.
Come here.<eos> Um, Tom is here, and David, and Josh.<eos> And David. Did I say David?<eos> Yeah, I know, because I invited them.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Because I thought it would be funny.<eos> For me.<eos> And good for you, emotionally, to have guys fighting over you.
But, probably not. So, don't be offended.<eos> I'm glad we had this talk, man.<eos> Whoo!<eos> You trying to hide from me?<eos> Are you hiding from me? Hi.<eos> Huh?<eos> Hi. I didn't see you, right over there.<eos> It's a good hiding spot.<eos> Uh, listen.<eos> I've been thinking about you a lot.
You're not gonna find the right guy by bumming free drinks and slutting it up.<eos> Where is this coming from?<eos> This whole time, you've been the one that's like,<eos> "Oh, yeah, parties and dicks and shots.<eos> "Let's put shots all over our bodies."<eos> "More sparkles, bitch!"<eos> It's about me being sick of you just meeting guys and falling into their dick-sand.<eos> Falling into their what?<eos> Their dick-sand.<eos> It's like, every time a guy just looks at you, you just forget who you are, and, like... "Oh!"
No, it's not cheating, since we've already been together.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Wait, just...<eos> You told me you missed me!<eos> I... That's the whole point, I miss you all the time.<eos> I saw you and you were so beautiful, and you are so beautiful.<eos> And I just need closure.<eos> I think we need...<eos> Is that what this...<eos> This is closure for you?
You don't need me anymore.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Okay. I'm scared.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Hi.<eos> I called him.<eos> Look, I know you don't want me here, but just listen to me, okay?<eos> You like me.<eos> And I like you.
I wanted to tell you that I know that I can do a lot of things on my own.<eos> And I can unzip my own dress, but I want you to do it for me.<eos> That sounded really weird.<eos> Um... I want you to watch me unzip my dress.<eos> No, sorry.<eos> That sounded really sexual.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> What I meant is I want to unzip my own dress and I just want you to be around, because you're my best friend.<eos> And I love you.<eos> And I'm totally in love with you, too.
Me.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Mommy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A lot of good memories in here.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> ♪ But if you feel like I feel ♪<eos> ♪ Please let me know that it's real ♪<eos> ♪ You're just too good to be true ♪<eos> ♪ Can't take my eyes off of you ♪

No, thanks.<eos> So, what is it you wanted to see me about?<eos> I don't know about that.<eos> If you want to be there, you should be.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> What you did was wrong.<eos> But are you sorry about it?<eos> Then He forgives you.<eos> No.<eos> No matter what you've done... if you need Him, He has to be there for you.
Goldman as Martha: My husband and I felt that something should be done.<eos> Refugees in the Sudetenland had been murdered, and people had been imprisoned and hurt.<eos> We had two small kids, including a very tiny daughter.<eos> I said, "How many men have you offered this to?"<eos> "17," he said.<eos> I said, "Do I understand they've all turned you down?"<eos> They think a war is definitely coming, and they don't want to be in danger."<eos> I reassured Martha, "Missionaries leave their children.<eos> "I'm sure ours can be left in good hands.<eos> I want to go, but I won't go without you."
"That's you, ever my beloved madam.<eos> Your most fortunate servant Waitstill."<eos> Hanks as Waitstill: "173 Boulevard Saint-Germain,<eos> "Dearest Martha, These long silences surely "are trying.<eos> "Why don't you write, "even if you send no more than a postal card?<eos> "I shall certainly hope for a word from you tomorrow.<eos> "I think I shall have to try out for the wounded love section "at the Paris Opera.<eos> "Now do, please, write me.<eos> Ever yours, Waitstill."<eos> Goldman as Martha: "My darling Waitstill, "I am terribly lonely without you,
- Shit.<eos> Yeah, that's what he said.<eos> I liked that guy.<eos> I bet you did.<eos> - I can't have that.<eos> - Not right now.<eos> Maybe later.<eos> I'll come find you later.<eos> I'm gonna keep your 20.<eos> Keep the 20, that's for you, doll.
Is that Shakespeare?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shakespeare.<eos> - All right. All right.<eos> - You can see yourself out over the wall.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, be like that.<eos> Hey, Abreu.<eos> You trust this guy?<eos> As much as I trust you.
Come on, man.<eos> Come on, pick up.<eos> Pick up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> These fucking things are so fresh, man.<eos> Hey, I got a bigger connect.<eos> - These guys are the biggest of the big.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> You need to trust me on that.<eos> Trust you, man?
Shut the fuck up!<eos> - What the hell happened back there?<eos> - What were you so pissed off about, man?<eos> - What am I pissed off about?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Don't worry, man.<eos> I called your wife and told her you were gonna be late for dinner 'cause you were locked in a closet, you know.<eos> Bob, we're all waiting for you to come out the closet.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> So, this is all just a joke to you?
- Right, so what do you want, Bob?<eos> - When you cooperated before, it led to drugs off the street, and a lot of punks right here in this shithole that you call your home.<eos> - Sorry, Bobby, I can't rat.<eos> - I'm not asking you to rat.<eos> Can't do it.<eos> I'm asking you to just act.<eos> - Like fucking what?<eos> - Like you.<eos> Just be yourself.<eos> I need you.
- It's fine.<eos> Really.<eos> - It matters.<eos> It's a special occasion.<eos> - I know.<eos> - And I want it to be special, okay.<eos> I'm just wondering where my little Bobby the accountant went?<eos> - Nowhere, I'm right here.<eos> - Kinda liked him.<eos> Hey. Kinda like you.
All of us.<eos> And Nancy Reagan with her holier-than-thou "just say no to drugs" bullshit.<eos> Ronny, you know, he should've stayed the Gipper.<eos> He's nothing but a two-faced drug pusher.<eos> Whatever happened to good old integrity?<eos> Do you think that half homo Ospina knows what's coming?<eos> Good luck.<eos> You, me and every other prick is sucking on the tit of that golden calf.<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> If one of those bullets was meant for you, I wouldn't be talking to you now, would I?

Come on, you knew that was the deal.<eos> That's the max.<eos> You want more money, get a fucking law degree.<eos> - No, no, man.<eos> - No?<eos> - It's not like that.<eos> - So, what is it like?<eos> You pay me or I rat.<eos> I'll fucking tell them you're a piece of shit...<eos> I can't believe that Bob warned me about you, you know that?
- This is a fucking cop!<eos> The money's right there.<eos> There you go.<eos> I don't have anything.<eos> - Whoa. Whoops. - Fuck.<eos> What is that?<eos> Green shit?<eos> This is your fucking money!<eos> Fucking asshole!<eos> I'm so scared of you with your dick hanging out like that.
Fucking asshole!<eos> I'm so scared of you with your dick hanging out like that.<eos> Bang!<eos> I love you, man.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - Fuck me?<eos> Then fuck me. Oh, yeah.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - To fucking me.<eos> You know, I really like you, man.
Man, they cut open your fucking eyes so you can't shut them, and then they're gonna bring in your little fucking family.<eos> They'll cut your son's head off with a cheese wire.<eos> They'll do the same to your little girl.<eos> And then, they'll cut your wife's tits off right in front of you and they won't feel a fucking thing.<eos> Last but not least, they're gonna cut your fucking head off and send it to your buddies down at Customs.<eos> You could have retired, couldn't you?<eos> You made a choice.<eos> And this is mine.<eos> Now, I hope you don't mind, but I got you something.<eos> I saw these and, of course, I thought of you.
Police!<eos> Get down!<eos> Get down!<eos> God pours his infinite benevolence on Bank of Credit and Commerce International,<eos> because we have the humility to receive it.<eos> Gloria.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Bob.<eos> Okay, it's all right.<eos> Roberto told me you are the only one I can trust.
You have to live a life of adventure."<eos> So... here I am.<eos> Good morning.<eos> We're starting over, in every way.<eos> I'll have to figure out where to live, how to live... who my friends will be.<eos> It's like the first day of school.<eos> If the school bus took 120 years to get there.<eos> We're creating a culture...<eos> You are funny.<eos> Do you ever read something... and feel like it's written just for you?
All the other passengers will sleep... for another 90 years... while I live out my life on this ship... traveling forever... never arriving.<eos> My only companion, a total stranger.<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> Do what?<eos> Emigrate.<eos> Leave Earth.<eos> I'm interviewing you.<eos> You're what?<eos> You were the first hibernation failure... in the history of space travel.<eos> That makes you a story.
Mmm-hmm. I'm getting a lot of dirty looks.<eos> Very popular, tonight.<eos> So, how's your book coming?<eos> I don't really know what it is, yet.<eos> My dad, he used to always write about his life... but he had stories.<eos> He'd sailed around Antarctica.<eos> He was a war reporter.<eos> He had lovers.<eos> He wrote about his daughter.<eos> He wrote about you?
I cut them myself.<eos> You know, for two unlucky people... we sure got pretty lucky.<eos> Attention.<eos> You may wish to proceed to a viewing area.<eos> The Avalon will slingshot around the star Arcturus.<eos> Look!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> That was amazing.<eos> A red giant.<eos> The universe's present to you.
Can I talk to you?<eos> Aurora... I know nothing I can say will make this okay.<eos> But please, listen.<eos> I was so alone... for so long.<eos> It felt like I was disappearing.<eos> The night I first saw you, I was ready to...<eos> You saved my life.<eos> And I know that's no excuse for what I did.<eos> I read everything you wrote... and I fell in love with your voice... and with the way your mind works.<eos> I fell in love with you.
Arthur!<eos> Tuesday's my day with Arthur.<eos> It's Wednesday.<eos> The bar's all yours.<eos> What'll you have?<eos> Whiskey?<eos> Coffee.<eos> Aurora!<eos> We love you!<eos> What are we gonna do without you?
What'll you have?<eos> Whiskey?<eos> Coffee.<eos> Aurora!<eos> We love you!<eos> What are we gonna do without you?<eos> We'll miss you so...<eos> You're the bravest woman I know.<eos> Bye, Aurora!<eos> I promise that I will think of you every day.
Whiskey?<eos> Coffee.<eos> Aurora!<eos> We love you!<eos> What are we gonna do without you?<eos> We'll miss you so...<eos> You're the bravest woman I know.<eos> Bye, Aurora!<eos> I promise that I will think of you every day.<eos> When you wake up, I'll be gone... but just know that I will never forget you.

Nothing was ever enough for you.
You can talk to me through this.<eos> What happens to you when that door opens?<eos> Heat shield.<eos> It might help.<eos> You might need this.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> I better go.<eos> Jim?<eos> Jim... come back to me.<eos> I can't live on the ship without you.
"We are not sure when we shall return."<eos> The Bingleys just closed down the house and left?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why would he not know when he is to return?<eos> According to Caroline Bingley,<eos> "Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister.<eos> "My brother admires her greatly already.<eos> "He will now be seeing her frequently and on the most intimate footing.<eos> "Am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event "which will secure the happiness of so many?"<eos> Obviously, she knows her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.
- Charlotte?<eos> I didn't know you were coming to visit.<eos> I have some news.<eos> I'm engaged to be married to Mr. Collins.<eos> You must be surprised.<eos> I'm not. I'm relieved.<eos> I believe that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most women can hope for.<eos> And that's all you expect?<eos> At 25, it's more than I expect.<eos> Charlotte, if you're happy for you, then I am, too.
You must be surprised.<eos> I'm not. I'm relieved.<eos> I believe that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most women can hope for.<eos> And that's all you expect?<eos> At 25, it's more than I expect.<eos> Charlotte, if you're happy for you, then I am, too.<eos> Well, I am to be presented to Lady Catherine and if I am to stay the night at Mr. Collins' rectory,<eos> I will require a chaperone.<eos> - Charlotte...<eos> - She's said to be quite an imposing figure. And the thought of facing her without you makes me deathly nervous.
So it is.<eos> - Rider!<eos> - Wait!<eos> Lydia, where are the others?<eos> You fool.<eos> I've been one of them all along.<eos> If I had the living your father intended me, I never would have been in the army, I never would have been infected.<eos> This is your doing, Darcy!<eos> Suppressing my hunger was easy.<eos> They needed God, I had my hatred of you to sustain me.
It's got a little bit of pasghetti in there.<eos> Toenails.<eos> Rat shit.<eos> Everything a growing fella needs, like you.<eos> Come here.<eos> Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a secret?<eos> Yeah.<eos> One day...<eos> Somehow, some way, I'm gonna get outta here.<eos> And I'm gonna rain down on you like the holy ghost.
Come on, guys.<eos> Don't waste my time.<eos> Sector C! Pull your heads out of your ass!<eos> The boss is on deck!<eos> Open it!<eos> Bravo 14 open perimeter fence.<eos> Stay back.<eos> If she moves, fire her up, all right?<eos> You gonna come down from there or what?<eos> Yeah. Look at you.
So we watched her and waited.<eos> You should talk to mama more.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I know.<eos> Mama stays in bed a lot.<eos> Yeah. She's still going out at night?<eos> Dad, it's okay.<eos> I can take care of her.<eos> I know how to make pancakes now.<eos> Hey babe, that's beautiful.<eos> She's supposed to be taking care of you, you know.
Mag full of dummy rounds.<eos> If I pull the trigger, nothing happens.<eos> You're absolutely right.<eos> Why would we give a loaded weapon to an infamous hitman?<eos> Go ahead, pull the trigger.<eos> Empty it.<eos> Don't empty nothing.<eos> You don't even know this lady.<eos> I've known you, like, nine months.<eos> Remember when I brought you that cookie?
In World War 2, the US Navy made a deal with the mafia to protect it's ships on the waterfront.<eos> This ain't World War 2.<eos> It's World War 3.<eos> What are you really up to?<eos> It's a "need to know", and, all you need to know is you work for me.<eos> That can change with a phone call.<eos> I have friends too, you know.<eos> There you go.<eos> Call'em.<eos> But without you minding her, your lady friend stays here strapped to a board in a drug-induced coma.
- Location verified.<eos> - Oh. - Next!<eos> Oh, you deaf.<eos> You one of them deaf hoes.<eos> - All right, all right. Come on.<eos> Shut up, and get it done.<eos> Listen, you're being transferred.<eos> I don't know where you're going.<eos> It's from Mr. J.<eos> You gonna tell him I took care of you?
We're about to enter the building.<eos> Get that chopper ready.<eos> What do say we get this over with?<eos> What the hell? Deadshot.<eos> Fall back.<eos> You mind if we tag along?<eos> Looks like we have a spot of luck, eh?<eos> Be a walk in the park.<eos> Easy peasy.<eos> Don't make me shoot you.
I missed.<eos> Good one, mate.<eos> It's Waller.<eos> Savior 1-0's been hijaked.<eos> Shoot it down.<eos> Rager that, ma'am.<eos> Going hot.<eos> Puddin'!<eos> You got all dressed up for me?<eos> Oh, you know I'd do anything for you.
Worst part of it is, they're gonna blame us for the whole thing.<eos> And they can't have people knowing the truth.<eos> We're the patsies.<eos> The cover-up.<eos> Don't forget, we're the bad guys.<eos> For about 2 sweet seconds... I had hope.<eos> You had hope, huh?<eos> Hope don't stop the wheel from turning, my brother.<eos> You preaching?<eos> It's coming back around for you.
I never been with a witch before.<eos> What's that like?<eos> Apparently that's why the creatures chase him all the time.<eos> 'Cause the witch is scared of him.<eos> The only woman I ever cared about... Is trapped inside that monster.<eos> If I don't stop the witch, it's over.<eos> Everything is over.<eos> Everything.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Your daughter writes you everyday.
Man, look, if this is about that poker game. I told Howie, I told him that...<eos> Okay, look, just take whatever you want.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Sir, before you do anything to him, do you mind if I get a big tip?<eos> Jeremy, is it?<eos> Wade.<eos> Wade Wilson.<eos> That is a no go on the tiperoo, Jer.<eos> I'm not here for him.<eos> I'm here for you.
I don't really know what that means.<eos> I don't have a cat.<eos> Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?<eos> Anyhoo, tell me something... what situation isn't improved by pizza?<eos> Do you happen to know a Meghan Orflosky?<eos> Getting that right?<eos> Orflosky? Orlovsky?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Good.<eos> Because she knows you.
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.<eos> Negasonic Teenage...<eos> What the shit?<eos> That's the coolest name ever!<eos> So, what, you're like, his sidekick?<eos> No.<eos> Trainee.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> X-Men left you behind on what? Shit detail?<eos> What does that make you?
Quite unfortunate.<eos> That does it!<eos> Canada!<eos> That's not good.<eos> Wade, please.<eos> Cock shot!<eos> Your poor wife.<eos> You really should stop.<eos> All the dinosaurs feared the T. rex.<eos> I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!
He got "Ajax" from the dish soap.<eos> F-R-A-N-C-I...<eos> Snagged the dry cleaning tag off your lab coat.<eos> FYI, I could probably get you the superhero discount.<eos> You are so relentlessly annoying.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Never heard that before.<eos> Why don't you do us all a favor and shut the fuck up?<eos> Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Your face is the stuff of nightmares.<eos> Like a testicle with teeth.<eos> You will die alone.<eos> I mean, if you could die.<eos> Ideally, for others' sake.<eos> That'll do.<eos> All you need now is a suit and a nickname... like Wade the Wisecracker... or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie.<eos> Shit.<eos> What?<eos> I put all my money on you and now... I just realized I'm never gonna win the...
Can I help you ladies?<eos> I do hope so.<eos> I heard you might be able to point me in the direction of a friend of mine.<eos> Name of Wade Wilson.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I don't know the name.<eos> Hey, you're not supposed to be behind the bar.<eos> I've seen this girl.<eos> This must be Vanessa.<eos> I've heard so much about you.
Especially from this angle.<eos> You can't buy love, but you can rent it for three minutes.<eos> You weak motherfucker!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, get it together.<eos> This isn't about me, this is about Vanessa.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Maximum effort.<eos> Vanessa.<eos> Someone out back asking for you.
Wade...<eos> I'd go with you, but I don't want to.<eos> Listen, Al... if I never see you again, I want you to know that I love you very much.<eos> And also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere in the apartment... right next to the cure for blindness.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You wanna get fucked up?<eos> Put her down over here.<eos> Go on then.<eos> Thanks, dickless.<eos> And I mean you.
No.<eos> Super-penis.<eos> Come on, Wade. Language.<eos> Young one is present.<eos> What are you still doing?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Go make yourself useful!<eos> You, go be a really big brother to someone.<eos> Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.<eos> And you, chicken noodle... nothing compares to you.

That's all right.<eos> You're cool.<eos> What in the ass?<eos> That was not mean!<eos> I'm proud of you!

- Charlie got a job today.<eos> - McDonald's or Taco Bell?<eos> Middle school chemistry teacher.<eos> I weep for our future.<eos> Fuck me in the ass!<eos> Fuck me!<eos> Hey, Brian.<eos> Hey, Will.<eos> Looking good, buddy.<eos> We don't have a job for you.
- Go! Go, go, go... - Still here?<eos> And I better fucking win!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - I need a sexy video of you.<eos> - Yeah, I don't think so.<eos> I made an appointment to donate sperm.<eos> Your best idea for making rent is masturbating into a cup?<eos> I'm an accomplished masturbator.<eos> Will, I don't know what's going on with you.<eos> At school, you always had a million different things going on. Your energy was contagious. It's what I loved about you.
All right, that's enough! I'm coming in!<eos> Got it!<eos> Hi-ho, Silver.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Man, I should get a job more often.<eos> - Fuck, yeah!<eos> - Fuck, yeah!<eos> That was awesome.<eos> I have something else for you.
- Yes, they do.<eos> Sophomore year. We're running Ultimate Frisbee drills down in the lounge.<eos> Ethan comes in and says that there's a situation that I need to handle downstairs.<eos> So, I go downstairs, and I see this tiny little person in pajamas and slippers, and she is so, so angry.<eos> I was trying to study.<eos> The moment that I saw you, I knew that you were someone to take seriously.<eos> What are you gonna do about work, Will?<eos> Have a nice day, boys!<eos> Ooh, it's coming down.<eos> - Look at you.

Check in with the front desk, please.<eos> Oh, right, right.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll take care of that this afternoon.<eos> All right, bye-bye.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Roger Davis here to see James Gentry.<eos> You could sign in.<eos> Sir?<eos> I'm going to need you to exit the building.
For turning you into the responsible little worker bee that you are.<eos> - It was very nice to meet you.<eos> - You, too.<eos> Enjoy the party, dears.<eos> - I know. But she's making me Vice President.<eos> All signed.<eos> Just got to turn it in.<eos> Where did you find that?<eos> I called Lon Zimmet.<eos> He went on and on about you, and used the word "cock" like, 1,000 times.
Thank you.<eos> All clear!<eos> Watch the door!<eos> We got it.<eos> It's breached the containment chamber.<eos> So, what did you do at N-Tek, then?<eos> Your father was the true visionary, not me.<eos> Miles rebuilt N-Tek. He runs it now.<eos> Well, our facility is nothing like it was when Jim was there.<eos> Behind you!
Off, off, off!<eos> You like Thai food?<eos> I can't hear what you're saying.<eos> What?<eos> She said the Thai place on Main Street.<eos> Do you know where that is?<eos> I'll find it.<eos> They're out in force tonight.<eos> Did you find anything good?<eos> Well, I didn't find anything bad. Hey, I unpacked the cutest baby pictures of you today.
Why does everybody in this town know more about Dad than I do?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I talk about your dad all the time.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I don't know anything about his past 'cause you never talk about it.<eos> I don't know about his work, or his family...<eos> Or how he died.<eos> Listen, bud...<eos> I want you to know your father.<eos> I see so much of him in you.
It's such a treat.<eos> Frita.<eos> What?<eos> I named my truck Frita.<eos> Oh. Frita.<eos> Wow, that is... Yes, and that's privileged information by the way, so.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> You don't have to worry.<eos> Good.<eos> Because, you know, I know a secret about you, too.
No! I can do my own laundry from now on.<eos> You are so weird sometimes.<eos> And you're gonna be late.<eos> I had a dream, too, Max.<eos> There was explosions and screaming.<eos> Oh! Oh!<eos> I got it.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get off me!<eos> Why did you do that? There was another buildup of energy within you.
You have to remember something. I don't know.<eos> I told you everything I remember.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, I remember something else.<eos> The Ultralinks are closing in!<eos> What was that?<eos> What was that?<eos> I... I saw it, too.<eos> I was in like a building.<eos> It was like I was remembering, but I saw you.<eos> I saw a reflection of you.
No, I will not cut it out.<eos> When you get worked up, you generate energy.<eos> Clearly, "my mom" makes you upset.<eos> No, she's just...<eos> It just sucks. What?<eos> Everything that happened with my dad, she just kept moving us from place to place.<eos> I know.<eos> Yeah, no, I get it, right.<eos> Why am I telling you this?<eos> Because I'm here for you, Max.
Yeah, wow. Steel! Yes!<eos> Just seeing if anything reminded me of anything. Uh, coming.<eos> We're good.<eos> No Ultralinks in there.<eos> Hey, look, I'm in the kitchen.<eos> You've reached Molly McGrath. Please leave a message.<eos> Miles.<eos> He was there that night.<eos> Let's go talk to Miles.<eos> Okay, so, apparently, my dad, who I thought was a scientist, knew you, an alien, which is nuts. And the two of you were attacked for some reason by a wind-monster thing.
I kind of like it.<eos> What is that?<eos> Uh, not sure.<eos> Wait, that's you.<eos> Why is that you?<eos> Steel, hold off the Ultralinks while I power the core. You got it.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You've altered the power core!<eos> Steel, please!<eos> I trusted you! No!
Why is that you?<eos> Steel, hold off the Ultralinks while I power the core. You got it.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You've altered the power core!<eos> Steel, please!<eos> I trusted you! No!<eos> You're one of them.<eos> You're an Ultralink.<eos> I mean, I guess that I am, but I am not like them.<eos> I can't trust you.
Weapon initiating.<eos> The Ultralinks are closing in!<eos> They're through the outer walls, but the chamber's holding.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> Hurry, Mk'Rah.<eos> How did they get through so fast?<eos> Something's wrong. The outer defenses have been sabotaged.<eos> Steel!<eos> Miles, look out!<eos> Behind you!
Did you know that?<eos> Miles, listen to me.<eos> Go for a walk.<eos> I chose the wrong partner, Jim. Miles.<eos> Miles, why are you doing this?<eos> You don't know what they are.<eos> They'll consume everything.<eos> I made a deal.<eos> I eliminate you and the Ultralinks let me have your energy.<eos> I trusted you. No!
You know, at first, I wasn't even sure that you had begun to generate the energy.<eos> Till that little monster woke up.<eos> It was your father who convinced Steel to rebel against the Ultralinks.<eos> His own kind!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Just what I've been waiting for.<eos> The entire time I worked with your father and his machine, I was exposed to that energy and it was exhilarating.<eos> So, piece by piece I built a suit that could absorb the energy like the Ultralinks do.<eos> The Ultralink. You wanted it to kill me.<eos> To kill you?
Don't be so dramatic, half-breed!<eos> You think you're a warrior like your father was?<eos> You're nothing like him!<eos> And you're all alone and you cannot win.<eos> You are alone!<eos> Now step inside that core!<eos> Step inside the core!<eos> Okay, okay!<eos> I'm sorry, Steel.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.
He was my friend.<eos> We chose Earth to protect together.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> That's too much energy!<eos> That's too much energy!<eos> Hey, you were wrong.<eos> I'm not alone.<eos> It's not possible.<eos> Steel, now!<eos> He trusted you.

Max, are you okay? Careful steps, careful steps.<eos> Hey, I wanna introduce you to somebody.<eos> Steel, you're alive.<eos> Hi, Molly.<eos> We have a lot to talk about.<eos> You totally married an alien.<eos> Hey, what's wrong with that?<eos> The night your father died, I didn't know what to do.<eos> The whole town thought it was an accident, a freak storm.<eos> But I knew the Ultralinks had come for them and I was afraid they would come for you, too.
To different towns, different doctors.<eos> 'Cause I didn't know if you would blow up, or something.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> But I thought you were too young to understand.<eos> And believe me, I never suspected Miles.<eos> Yeah, just 16 years in a tank, Molly. No big deal.<eos> I said I'm sorry, Steel.<eos> If I had known you were still alive, you know I would have never let that happen.<eos> I would have kicked anyone's butt who tried to hurt you.<eos> So, it was Miles who suggested we come back to Copper Canyon in case the energy manifested in you.

'Cause I was afraid you'd end up like your dad.<eos> But now I couldn't be prouder that you did.<eos> What's your name?<eos> So, are there more Ultralinks out there?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why do you think I watch the stars so much?<eos> Why haven't they come for me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe because you didn't have the power yet.<eos> But you're a threat now and they'll come for you.
Maybe because you didn't have the power yet.<eos> But you're a threat now and they'll come for you.<eos> I thought I could protect you, but I can't.<eos> You know you're not exactly making me feel any better.<eos> But I do know one thing, okay?<eos> You will not have to do this alone.<eos> I love you, bud.<eos> I love you, too, Mom.<eos> I've held on to this for too long.<eos> Now it belongs to you.
There you are.<eos> Around this time, 43 years ago ...<eos> I ate Indian lamb in an attempt to chase you out.<eos> A delivery of 23 hours.<eos> It's down there never been more right.<eos> It's a miracle, bring a child into the world.<eos> - Here he comes. The son of Penny-Husband Bosworth sells his sperm on the internet.<eos> You do not even need a man.<eos> People have a great life without them.<eos> Look at you.
No more time.<eos> - Complete.<eos> Shortly, please, Minister.<eos> - It's complicated.<eos> A 'yes' or 'no'.<eos> Make sure that the last answer.<eos> - Let's hope so.<eos> We conclude with.<eos> Thank you for coming today.<eos> Back to you, Toby.
Then we have not met.<eos> - No, okay.<eos> Hey, you here.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> - Also good to see you.<eos> I wanted to look up to say hello, but you know how chaotic live TV.<eos> There are easier ways to get in touch with me except me on national TV ... ask about my sperm. - What?<eos> No, that's not what ...<eos> I'd like to hear from you.

I am pregnant.<eos> - Wow. Okay.<eos> It's ... much better than you are mentally unbalanced.<eos> I'm about twelve weeks pregnant.<eos> Okay. Right.<eos> So you mean that it was the music?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's quite a surprise.<eos> Yes but... it goes well with me, you should know that ...<eos> I want nothing from you.
She means nothing to me.<eos> And then I'd ... Swedish furniture bought to assemble.<eos> If we get through this, we can do anything.<eos> I would be pathetic if your neck is blotchy when you are nervous.<eos> And I know you would be the best mother to my child.<eos> Oh no, can not fall in love with a radiant new American.<eos> Tomorrow I tell them both, definitely.<eos> I just wanted to know how to recover the presentation.<eos> Yes, I'm full, I blender me all the way through.<eos> I trust you, Bridget.
What single.<eos> You are today our second set of the same sex.<eos> No, actually we're ...<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> The baby gift will make us feel complete.<eos> You are then the surrogate mother?<eos> - Indeed yes.<eos> I help this great bunch to come out of their dream.<eos> Mark is here very nervous about it.<eos> Completely new to you, anyway, lamb chop?
You have inspired me.<eos> - Still so long.<eos> However, you were right.<eos> This place is full of single mothers, single fathers, bisexuals, surrogates.<eos> And they are all so sweet and so normal.<eos> I even have two gay men in the team.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> Who would have expected now?<eos> - Everybody.<eos> I'm so proud of you, honey.
Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner!<eos> Come on!<eos> Golden Jet! Golden Jet! Golden Jet!<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Wow! Wow, guys-<eos> Hey! How about a hand for Principal Kent, huh?<eos> Honestly, if my mom was into white guys, it would be you.<eos> I know it would, okay?<eos> Well, as we all know, this is our last assembly, which means this is the last time in front of you guys that I'll be able to tell the most beautiful girl in the world...<eos> I'm talking about you, Maggie Johnson, that I love you.
No, I'm working on a new sexting app.<eos> Okay. It's kind of like lnstagram, right?<eos> But, instead of filters, it just makes yourjunk look huge.<eos> Like, three to six inches bigger.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> It's called "Junk Mail." Clever, right?<eos> You know, right now, this little walk right here?<eos> I kinda just want to take it away from my life.<eos> Why are you all cranky-pants this morning, huh?<eos> It's because Ethan got promoted instead of you?
Why are you all cranky-pants this morning, huh?<eos> It's because Ethan got promoted instead of you?<eos> Ethan got promoted?<eos> Youngest senior associate in the history of the firm.<eos> Corner office, the whole deal.<eos> Didn't he used to be your assistant?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Hey, you should come to lunch with us.<eos> We're gonna be celebrating his pro-mosh!<eos> It'll probably be good for you to kiss the ring a bit.
We're gonna be celebrating his pro-mosh!<eos> It'll probably be good for you to kiss the ring a bit.<eos> "Kiss the ring a bit"?<eos> Hey, you play your chessboard however you like, okay?<eos> Me, lunch today?<eos> I'm gonna French kiss that thing.<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm taking my wife to lunch today, so...<eos> All right.<eos> Bummer for you.
Okay.<eos> How about we change the topic to something a little more fun?<eos> Anything else, please.<eos> Oh, how about...<eos> This is the dress that I'm thinking about wearing.<eos> Honey, I want every single girl to be jealous tomorrow night.<eos> What?<eos> I just... I just don't want to go.<eos> Calvin, it's our 20-year high school reunion.<eos> I'm not gonna go without you.
We go to barbershops.<eos> That's where we talk out our problems.<eos> Or we watch the movie Barbershop.<eos> One or the other.<eos> Look, my parents were really unhappy for a long time before they got divorced.<eos> And maybe if they saw someone sooner, they would still be married.<eos> I just want to nip this thing in the bud, whatever it is.<eos> I don't want to end up like my parents.<eos> VVassup?<eos> Please, just do it for me, if not for you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Calvin.<eos> It's me, Bob.<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Do you know...<eos> Robbie Wheirdicht from high school!<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> What?<eos> - Wait, you're Robbie Wheirdicht?<eos> God, man, look at you!
No, you're just sexy as dick right now.<eos> You don't look somebody in the eyes and say that.<eos> Hey, let's get hammered.<eos> I got an early clay at work, so I'll probably--<eos> No, come on, I'm buying!<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> I am blown away right now.<eos> Dude, you used to be Fat Robbie.<eos> Look at you!
She was 14, but somehow she was a senior.<eos> She wore a cape.<eos> - Darla McGuckian.<eos> - Darla McGuckian.<eos> "Yucky Gucky."<eos> - Didn't she have a lazy eye or something?<eos> - Two of 'em.<eos> Right.<eos> Hey, but listen, I don't wanna talk about me.<eos> I wanna talk about you.
I'm not... I'm not talking about Twilight, Bob, okay?<eos> I'm talking about the fact that I don't feel like I'm the hero of my own story. That's...<eos> How are you not the hero of your own story?<eos> No one else can be!<eos> Yo, CJ, I gotta be honest with you, man.<eos> I mean, all this talk about Calvin Joyner not feeling like he's a hero...<eos> That's crazy talk, man.<eos> No. No, it's not.<eos> You were the best thing about high school.<eos> I'll always believe in you.
Hey, Jet!<eos> Man, I had a great time tonight.<eos> You know what?<eos> I had a good time, too, man.<eos> I feel like I needed this, you know?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My pleasure, amigo.<eos> Any time.<eos> Hey, if there's ever anything I can do for you, just say the word.
Get Larry on it.<eos> Car, car, car!<eos> All right, here's the dilly-o, Jet.<eos> About three weeks ago, an enemy of the state codenamed "The Black Badger" stole the encryption keys to the entire US spy satellite program which he's gonna sell to a buyer from that auction site on your computer last night.<eos> Bob... If we lose control of our satellites, we're completely vulnerable to any terrorist attacks.<eos> That's why I had to go back to your office and get you, Jet.<eos> I need your super sweet accounting skills to help me figure out the last piece of this puzzle which is the transaction number from the winning bid.<eos> That'll tell us where the deal is going down.<eos> That way, we can get The Black Badger.<eos> I can't do it without you, Jet.
Don't tell your wife shit.<eos> All right.<eos> I just don't know what's wrong.<eos> I mean, the man that I married, the person I knew in high school, he was filled with drive and desire. I mean...<eos> We used to sneak off every lunch hour and make out under the gym bleachers.<eos> Like, that guy, back then, -he wanted things, you know? - DR. DAN".<eos> Hmm.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. I couldn't find parking.<eos> Hi, no, no, it's okay.<eos> We got started without you.
You know what, Calvin?<eos> If you can't commit to working on our marriage, then you need to let me know.<eos> Maggie, you--<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> You're-<eos> - Something's not right.<eos> Come on, Jet, listen.<eos> Come on, come on, Jet!<eos> Now, I know things got a little rough there at the end.<eos> But the truth is, with all the heat that you have coming down on you, Maggie is definitely safer without you.
Don't bullshit me!<eos> Of course not, dude.<eos> Hey, hey, come on!<eos> Of course I don't have the codes.<eos> Why would I go through all this trouble, then?<eos> I need your skill set, Jet, to help me get the bank transaction numbers to the winning bid.<eos> We already know it's going down tonight from the countdown on your computer.<eos> Now, all we need is the "where."<eos> And the bank transaction numbers will give us the "where."<eos> That's why I need you.
You're making a big mistake, Mr. Joyner.<eos> That's only if I'm wrong.<eos> Come on, Bob.<eos> Let's go!<eos> What're you doing?<eos> Come on, man!<eos> Okay, listen to me.<eos> Bob, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I double-crossed you.<eos> You hear me? I should've believed you, I should've trusted you, and I didn't.
Yeah!<eos> Yeah! Yeah!<eos> - Come on!<eos> Follow me! - Let's do it!<eos> No!<eos> What am I doing? Here!<eos> You go!<eos> You bigger.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> - I'm behind you.
Oh, my-- on!<eos> We're going down, Jet!<eos> There's nothing I can do!<eos> - Oh, shit!<eos> - Really quickly...<eos> What's the one thing you wish you'd done in your life?<eos> The one thing I wish I hadn't done is not get in a plane with a guy who didn't check the goddamned fuel!<eos> - Why wouldn't you check the fuel?<eos> - No, something that's real.<eos> What's the one thing you regret not doing for you?
You can't go with me.<eos> The smarter play is if we split up.<eos> Smarter play for who?<eos> Do you know what happens when people split up, Bob?<eos> Somebody dies!<eos> I'd be the one to die.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because I don't have a bulletproof vest and I don't have a gun!<eos> Which means that you are my bulletproof vest!<eos> My little black ass is gonna stay behind you, you're not leaving me!
I'd be the one to die.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because I don't have a bulletproof vest and I don't have a gun!<eos> Which means that you are my bulletproof vest!<eos> My little black ass is gonna stay behind you, you're not leaving me!<eos> That's exactly why you should stay up here.<eos> Look, if you went down in that garage and you got shot to death, you know how hurt I would be?<eos> I'd be super bummed out!<eos> I don't want that.<eos> It's safer for you up here.
Just because I shot him does not mean I trust you.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> Stop!<eos> I said, "Stop."<eos> Aw, whoopsie.<eos> Nice throw, bitch.<eos> You wanna know why your pal Bob could never have been The Black Badger?<eos> It's because he's too weak.<eos> And if I had to hear another goddamned story about Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner and how awesome you were in high school and how you were this big idiot's best friend, I was just gonna lose it.<eos> Looking at you right now, you don't seem so cool.
- Yeah.<eos> - Hi, Brian.<eos> - Hi, Gail. Guys, this isn't a good idea.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll just meet you later.<eos> I shouldn't have come.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Bob, calm down, okay?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Tonight is not gonna be how high school was for you 20 years ago.
Oh, my God!<eos> Bob just went commando!<eos> Yes! Yes!<eos> Way to go, Bob!<eos> 5e you!<eos> Robbie! Robbie! Robbie!<eos> ALL". Robbie! Robbie!<eos> 'Hey, man!<eos> Dude, this is amazing!<eos> I'm so happy for you!
- Excuse me.<eos> Hi, Robbie.<eos> - You probably don't remember me.<eos> - Is that Darla McGuckian?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wow! She looks great!<eos> Didn't she used to have a lazy eye?<eos> - Two of them.<eos> - Wow. I can't believe you remember me.<eos> Remember you?
Okay, I'm not sure if that's racist or not, but I'll take it as a compliment.<eos> All right, cool.<eos> Yeah, come on!<eos> Okay.<eos> All right. Don't be nervous.<eos> You are gonna do great.<eos> They're gonna love you!<eos> Oh, Jet, Jet, Jet!<eos> Um, before we go, man, uh...<eos> I got a surprise for you.
- I don't know.<eos> No, no, no, no, no!<eos> If you wanna stay here, you go ahead. Please, Lane, don't!<eos> No, please don't!<eos> These people are gonna die. And they're gonna be here forever.<eos> Not me!<eos> Not me!<eos> Lane!<eos> Talia.<eos> We're just gonna go sit by a fire and we'll set up a tent for you, okay?
I don't like to fight women.<eos> I can see why.<eos> Get in the game!<eos> You and I aren't done yet.<eos> Looks like we are.<eos> You follow us and you die.<eos> - You're not gonna kill her.<eos> - I'm a freedom fighter, not a murderer.<eos> But you said you'd murder me.<eos> For you, I will make an exception.
- I know.<eos> - In the head.<eos> - It's not even...<eos> How did you get here?<eos> Did anyone spot you?<eos> Well, why don't you take a look at me, and then take a look at everybody else who lives here?<eos> I'm gonna say, yeah, I think I was spotted.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I could've done that myself.<eos> I opened it for you.
That's right, Juan.<eos> The plan is in motion.<eos> Tomorrow I'll be in position to take out el Presidente.<eos> But there is one catch.<eos> - Anton Masovich is trying to kill us.<eos> - The Russian Moby?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Screw him.<eos> If you want me to take out the president, I need your men to keep us alive.<eos> - Anything for you, friend.
- Anton Masovich is trying to kill us.<eos> - The Russian Moby?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Screw him.<eos> If you want me to take out the president, I need your men to keep us alive.<eos> - Anything for you, friend.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Anything.<eos> - All right.<eos> Anything for you.
- De nada.<eos> Let's get a move on, cupcake.<eos> From my private collection.<eos> Listen, I know you don't need the luck.<eos> But I will say break a leg.<eos> The president's leg.<eos> Then, his other leg.<eos> And then, carefully but painfully, rip out his still beating heart, and hoist it above his corpse like this for the entire party to see.<eos> I was thinking something maybe quicker.<eos> Whatever works for you.

I'll take that, sir.<eos> Juan.<eos> How did you get in?<eos> - I'm more capable than El Toro thinks.<eos> - I'm glad you're here, man.<eos> - I'm freaking out.<eos> - You will kill the president tonight.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> - Otherwise, I will.<eos> And then I'll kill you.
¡El Toro!<eos> Ghost, you did it.<eos> - El Toro, what are you doing here?<eos> - There is nothing to worry about.<eos> I have made a deal with General Ruiz.<eos> And Juan here, he has something to tell you. Oh.<eos> No, no, hey.<eos> - We don't need to do this. - Tell him.<eos> Tell him.<eos> I doubted you the whole time, but... I was wrong.
Either way.<eos> I'm really sorry to do this, Fantasma.<eos> What...?<eos> What about the whole us-riding-together thing?<eos> You know too much.<eos> Now you must die. But... you will live in our hearts and minds forever.<eos> But I'll be dead.<eos> But you will live forever.<eos> You will be a legend.<eos> We will write songs about you.
What do you mean?<eos> His book.<eos> It was bullshit.<eos> He's not the Ghost.<eos> He's just some... loser.<eos> I tried to tell you.<eos> You lied to me?<eos> No, you...<eos> You just assumed, you know.<eos> I was gonna write songs about you.
- She's making a mess.<eos> Why do you think we made the last DEA agent assigned here eat a C-4 sandwich?<eos> My parents died when I was a little boy.<eos> In many ways, El Toro has been like a father to me.<eos> Just as you will be to all of our people.<eos> This country needs a change.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Thanks for waiting.<eos> If you actually want my help... it was worth the wait.<eos> I can assure you that my plans won't work without you.
Note for chapter in new book:<eos> What's more important in a man, the mental or the physical?<eos> Idea for chapter in next book:<eos> Can you truly be an adult without experiencing sex?<eos> Another chapter: Can a person be truly happy without sex?<eos> - Hey, Josh.<eos> So I took your advice and invited Becky to a movie, and she said yes.<eos> - That's great.<eos> - She brought a friend. Ooh.<eos> Well, doesn't mean she doesn't like you.
They don't just call anybody!<eos> I submitted you, you nutty genius.<eos> You and your marvelous book.<eos> I would've told you earlier, but I was afraid they would reject you.<eos> And there was a very strong possibility of that.<eos> But they didn't.<eos> They accepted us.<eos> - Oh, my god. - Wow!<eos> This so amazing for me!<eos> And for you!
- Yeah.<eos> But if he keeps making you feel unnecessary?<eos> God, ask me to make a great paella and I'll blow your fucking mind, but treat me like a doormat, and I'm obviously falling to pieces.<eos> I know what I need now.<eos> - Some more wine?<eos> I need to become a chef.<eos> I need to transfer all of this energy and this sadness into something that I know that I really want... And I know that I can do.<eos> That's a fucking great idea.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I don't know what I would do without you.
- I figured he wouldn't be lying.<eos> - But what's the vibe? -Well, it's kinda casual.<eos> Like, not very fancy.<eos> So they're not at a fancy restaurant out there?<eos> No, she's not dressed up or anything.<eos> I just really needed to talk to somebody, and... I really only wanted to talk to you.<eos> So I really appreciate that you were there.<eos> And sorry if, you know, things got weird, and, you know, like, we kissed and stuff,<eos> - or whatever.<eos> - I'm here for you.
Oh, yes, you will, if you ask.<eos> You haven't taken a vacation since I've known you.<eos> Besides, it's not a vacation, it's the start of your career.<eos> Now you sound like Pete.<eos> He'd be so thrilled if I did this.<eos> - Okay, about Pete...<eos> I think he's a serial killer. I do.<eos> He's always 'round here mincing around with that small waist.<eos> Creepy.<eos> And the way he looks at you, that's not love.
Yes.<eos> C-u-m.<eos> It's c-o-m-e.<eos> Recovery should be fairly quick. But you'll have to take a few weeks off work.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> There's nothing to worry about.<eos> Actually, more like champagne grapes.<eos> Yeah, I'm still feeling great.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> We're here for you.
You're gonna be okay.<eos> There's nothing to worry about.<eos> Actually, more like champagne grapes.<eos> Yeah, I'm still feeling great.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> We're here for you.<eos> I'm sorry we let you down.<eos> We're not doctors so, you know, how could we...?<eos> How you feeling?<eos> When rich told me that the tumor had kept you trapped inside the body of a 7th-grader and that's why you've never had sex or an erection, I felt so happy for you.
And good luck with that.<eos> I'm channeling from your spirit guide.<eos> May the great goddess shakti... Inspire this blessed heart... And may the universal energy...<eos> Thank you to our brothers and sisters of the Pleiades.<eos> Namaste.<eos> Thank you, mom.<eos> I really like recouping here.<eos> We all love you, honey.<eos> We all love you!<eos> Look at you!
I just saw them, but you didn't sign the card, silly.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You wanna come over?<eos> - I can put them in some water.<eos> There's something different about you.<eos> I don't know, maybe it's your hair, it's longer or something, I don't know.<eos> But you look good.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> It's good to see you, too.
Are you kidding me, rich? Really?<eos> I've been waiting my whole fucking life for this moment!<eos> Things change when you have children, okay?<eos> You're the one who chose to have kids. - Right?<eos> - Yes, and I love them.<eos> But right now, I'm not a father,<eos> I'm just a guy who wants to violate their mother. You know what, rich?<eos> I wanna do something for myself for once!<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Good for you, buddy.
- Then it's perfect.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> What's the name, please?<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir? !<eos> - It's the mix I made you. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> You really have a thing about making scenes in restaurants.<eos> - Just hear me out. - No! No!<eos> I'm busy!<eos> Are you too selfish to realize that this is a very, very important night for me and that whatever you're doing, whatever this is, this is obviously about you?
Us. Let's give these people what they came a thousand miles to see. A show!<eos> And go!<eos> You ain't seen nothin' yet.<eos> Whales, I need whales.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you?<eos> This ain't Orlando.<eos> Act real.<eos> Oh, not that real.<eos> Oh, that's the fourth time this month.<eos> Norm, I need you for the finale.
Wow, that actor actually smells like a bear.<eos> I haven't smelled anything that foul since-- wait a minute.<eos> Has he spoken again?<eos> Uh, nope.<eos> Something felt a little too real with that bear.<eos> The only thing that looks like a bear, sounds like a bear, and smells as bad as a bear is a bear.<eos> I knew it!<eos> You think you're real slick, don't you, old bear?<eos> You thought you could send one of your bear operatives to take me out?<eos> Well, I got news for you, gramps.
Vortex. That storm brought all the smells of winter right to our doorsteps.<eos> "Real bear," huh?<eos> You know what? Just forget the whole thing.<eos> Some guy from a cola company approached me at kozawa's.<eos> Said they needed a bear for a holiday thing.<eos> Because of me, your ratings just jumped 20%.<eos> Imagine what I could do for a real company.<eos> Norm, wait.<eos> If you let him walk out that door, we are back to square one.<eos> Norm, norm, norm. Um, I am so sorry i shot at you.
And on top of all that, Mr. Greene is watching us, so act natural.<eos> Not that natural.<eos> - Okay- okay, look--<eos> okay, look, we need someone to provide cover while I go investigate that shelf that smelled like grandpa.<eos> I think I know just the guy.<eos> Look, all you have to do is go up there and pretend to be me.<eos> The lemmings will let you in.<eos> There's plenty of salmon in the minibar, so help yourself.<eos> Brilliant. Thank you, kind bear.<eos> We'll leave the lights on for you.
- Not yet. The houses are being transported tonight.<eos> If we can stop them, maybe we can stop this whole operation.<eos> Then what the heck are you doing here?<eos> Norm, don't worry about me.<eos> It's your time now.<eos> Leave me.<eos> Go!<eos> Save the arctic! Save our homes.<eos> You are the arctic, grandpa.<eos> Hmm. I must have weakened them for you.
- and dump 'em in the ocean.<eos> - Wait! Wait! You guys think we're bears?<eos> You hear that, grandpa?<eos> Talking polar bears in Manhattan?<eos> Now, come on, guys.<eos> Yeah, maybe our friend the easter bunny's around here, too.<eos> Are you sure they're bears?<eos> Theysound likehumansto me .<eos> - I didn't sign up toshootrealpeople.<eos> Norm, no matter what happens, just know that I'm proud of you.
Every time I see you, you've fallen on your butt.<eos> I march to the beat of my own drum. You know that.<eos> When everyone else stands, I sit.<eos> Ta-da!<eos> Lemmings! You made it!<eos> Where's grandpa?<eos> Did he--? We've searched everywhere, norm.<eos> No.<eos> Norm, you saved our home.<eos> I'm sorry i didn't realize until now, but we are so proud of you.
I don't know. It wasn't me.<eos> Derek.<eos> Derek.<eos> Ghost of Matilda?<eos> Is that really you?<eos> Yes, Derek.<eos> I'm sorry I haven't been in touch, but I've just been so dead.<eos> Listen.<eos> You must love our son.<eos> He needs you.
And you are the most narcissistic, self-involved person I've ever met!<eos> But that's not how I think of me.<eos> I'm going back to school.<eos> Little Derek, come back here!<eos> I thought we were gonna give each other facials!<eos> Wait.<eos> How did you learn to speak Italian?<eos> Because I'm smart!<eos> Mom was smart, too.<eos> The only stupid thing she ever did was fall in love with you.
Oh, my gosh.<eos> Okay!<eos> Check and mate, Mugatu.<eos> Your move.<eos> You really are an idiot, aren't you?<eos> Like, super, super white hot, blazingly stupid.<eos> For ten long years... I've been plotting my escape from this dreadful place. For ten long years.<eos> For ten long years.<eos> Ten years spent creating some of the most realistic and lifelike masks... evermade.<eos> One for you.
How dare you?<eos> They murdered him inside the jail.<eos> These people can get to anyone.<eos> How dare you keep that from me?<eos> You had no right!<eos> The children?<eos> The ceremony at the Capitol... I took them out the front door.<eos> Are you... This is all insanity!<eos> You and your brother. All these years, all your goddamn secrets!<eos> Caroline and John are all I have left, and I put them in danger because of you.
Exactly as you imagined it.<eos> I wish Jack...<eos> Who knows if he would have cared?<eos> I lost track, somewhere... What was real.<eos> What was performance.<eos> Well, he was a president.<eos> You were right earlier.<eos> I'm not going to march tomorrow.<eos> I won't put people in danger on account of my vanity.<eos> I was scared for you.
We teed it up for him.<eos> He gets to knock it down.<eos> I shouldn't have pushed him so hard on Castro.<eos> You can't do that, Bobby.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> What's wrong with me?<eos> History is harsh.<eos> There's no time.<eos> We're ridiculous.<eos> Look at you.
No, I'm hungover.<eos> There's a huge difference.<eos> Well, you smell like liquor.<eos> And you smell like Rhode Island.<eos> What?<eos> You've never had a big night before?<eos> No.<eos> I don't drink.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Good for you.
At all.<eos> Look, I don't need to cut corners, Kev.<eos> I can make weight.<eos> No, maybe you're at your weight.<eos> Cutting corners is what you've been doing.<eos> I won my first world title...<eos> As a lightweight, I know.<eos> The first time I got laid was in my high school parking lot.<eos> You see me taking my wife there every time I want to get my rocks off?<eos> Look at you.
How is this supposed to help anybody?<eos> I could ask you the same question.<eos> It's 9:30.<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> Kev, look.<eos> I get it.<eos> You need this win as much as I do.<eos> You're damn right I need this win.<eos> But this isn't about me.<eos> It's about you!
I just want to say thank you, it really means a lot.<eos> To Vinny!<eos> Cheers!<eos> All right!<eos> This whole thing's a machine.<eos> When the machine runs, it feeds everybody.<eos> When it's down, when it ain't running, nobody eats.<eos> You understand?<eos> The machine, it don't stop for nobody.<eos> Not for me, not for Don King, not even for you.
Or any of them.<eos> I can't be part of you getting hurt no more.<eos> Why are you doing this right now?<eos> I should have done it a long time ago.<eos> All right.<eos> Vinny!<eos> You got a second?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's up, Lou?<eos> I got a hell of an offer for you.
A Harvester Ship conquered our planet... and extracted its molten core.<eos> They use them to refuel their ships... and grow their technology.<eos> They have done this to countless civilizations.<eos> We fought them for thousands of years... but they destroyed all of our ships.<eos> I am the sole survivor.<eos> I am so sorry to hear that.<eos> Do you have a plan?<eos> My system holds the key to superior technology.<eos> And there is a hidden planet... where I teach refugees from other fallen worlds... how to build weapons that will defeat them... once and for all.<eos> That's why they're afraid of you.
Tom, it looks like the plan is working.<eos> She thinks you've got the Sphere.<eos> - She's only going after the fighters.<eos> - We gotta get these kids to cover. Go, go!<eos> It's good to see you flying again.<eos> Your place is in the air.<eos> You should've let me do this.<eos> You saved the world once before, Dad.<eos> I'm not saving the world, Patty.<eos> I'm saving you.
Enchantée.<eos> I'm Catherine Marceaux.<eos> - Could you give us a second?<eos> - I was never here.<eos> Listen, maybe you guys should stay with me for a while...<eos> I think that we'd really like that.<eos> Yeah, so would I.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I am.<eos> Thanks to you.
This is Madison.<eos> Are you good with kids?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Can you watch her for me?<eos> I'll pay you.<eos> I have to go out tonight, and I...<eos> I can't take her with me.<eos> I'm a little nervous about her being with somebody else, but she seems to be comfortable with you already.<eos> So, I think it's okay...<eos> Lucy, sweetie, I really need you right now.
That was rude.<eos> No, it's...<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> I don't care.<eos> My husband doesn't know I'm here.<eos> He wouldn't let me go to Cancun, he said it was too dangerous.<eos> Too dangerous!<eos> Well, I don't care.<eos> I have his credit card, and if it wasn't for her...<eos> But now I have you.
To be honest, I'm not usually alone with her.<eos> God, it's tiring!<eos> You can keep a secret, can't you?<eos> I'm meeting this man tonight.<eos> My husband can never know.<eos> This man just looks at me, and I get wet.<eos> I just have to see him.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Don't worry about her.<eos> I need you right now.
I need to just rest.<eos> Yeah, I don't really know how to do that kind of stuff.<eos> Oh, for fuck's sake!<eos> There, there's your tip.<eos> Has anyone ever tipped you a hundred bucks before?<eos> Uh, no!<eos> Now put some fucking makeup on my face.<eos> - This thing?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> I need you.
You think he'll want me?<eos> Uh... Give me my purse.<eos> You know what?<eos> You two should go swimming in the pool today.<eos> That would be fun.<eos> - It's cold.<eos> - No, it'll be fun!<eos> Here you go, some bathing suits.<eos> How cute!<eos> And now, something for you too!
When I was six, my mom took me to this weird apartment building, and she sat me up on the stoop, and told me to wait.<eos> And she was just gonna go run some errands, and come back.<eos> And, um... I sat there for hours, and it got really cold, and then, this old Buick pulls up and this tall skinny guy gets out.<eos> A guy I'd never even seen before, and he was like, "Hey, I'm your dad and you're gonna come home with me."<eos> Um... and then I never... I...<eos> I never saw her again.<eos> But I wouldn't have cared if I hadn't needed her.<eos> So...<eos> I just think it's better to not be needed.<eos> She needs you.
Let's go, right now.<eos> - Right now?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What's stopping us?<eos> Come on, stand up, let's go.<eos> - You have to say goodbye.<eos> - Fuck that!<eos> To your mom?<eos> You can't leave her alone.<eos> They're coming for you, Lu.
Lu, look at me.<eos> I need the whole story.<eos> So what, I'm a thief?<eos> I'm a liar?<eos> You don't ask, you just assume?<eos> What am I supposed to think?<eos> I know you're hiding something.<eos> - I've known since you showed up.<eos> - I don't have to tell you.<eos> I took care of you.
You've done a really bad thing.<eos> I thought it was the right thing, that's the only reason I did it.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Okay. We got her.<eos> Let's get somebody over there now.<eos> Lu, what are you doing?<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> I got you.
This is a very special Trollstice... As there is one amongst us who has never tasted a Troll.<eos> Me!<eos> She is talking about me!<eos> Prince Gristle... The time has come.<eos> It's okay, son.<eos> I remember being nervous my first time.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> It is my sacred duty... To initiate you in the ways of true happiness.<eos> I have chosen an extra-Special Troll, just for you.
The craziest party ever!<eos> Big?<eos> Loud?<eos> Crazy?<eos> You're just gonna lead the Bergens right to us!<eos> Are you sure you wanna invite this party pooper to poop on your party?<eos> Yes.<eos> I think everyone deserves to be happy.<eos> I don't do happy.<eos> Branch, I know you have happiness inside you.
Which is why I have to ask you.<eos> Will you go to Bergen Town with me and save everyone?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Branch, you can't say no.<eos> They're your friends.<eos> They're your friends.<eos> I'm staying right here in my bunker where it's safe.<eos> That's great.<eos> You're the one guy who knows more about Bergens than anyone... But when we finally need you, you just want to hide here forever?
Good night, Satin.<eos> Good night, Chenille.<eos> Good night, Biggie.<eos> Good night, DJ.<eos> Good night, Guy Diamond.<eos> Good night, Creek.<eos> Boop.<eos> And good night, Poppy.<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> Stars shining bright above you
Todd.<eos> Chef, where did you come from?<eos> My father banished you 20 years ago.<eos> Have you been standing behind that plant this whole time?<eos> If only, sire.<eos> No.<eos> I've been out in the wilderness... Thinking of nothing but how I let you down.<eos> If only there was some way I could make you feel better.<eos> Well, fat chance!<eos> The only way I'll ever be happy is by eating a Troll... And that ain't gonna happen, thanks to you.
What exactly are you proposing?<eos> Bringing back Trollstice?<eos> For everyone?<eos> Yes!<eos> That's exactly what I'm proposing.<eos> Great idea, sire.<eos> Absolutely brilliant.<eos> Aren't you smart?<eos> I guess I am.<eos> And I, your loyal Chef, will be right behind you.
- No!<eos> Why not?<eos> Why won't you sing?<eos> Because singing killed my grandma, okay?<eos> Now, leave me alone.<eos> My uncle broke his neck tap dancing once.<eos> How did singing kill your grandma?<eos> What song was she singing?<eos> I was the one singing.<eos> And I need you now tonight

Lady Glittersparkles!<eos> I'll see you at Trollstice, yeah?<eos> I miss you already.<eos> Ow!<eos> I think the king really likes us.<eos> I know, right?<eos> That was the greatest day of my life!<eos> Thanks, Poppy.<eos> Thanks to all of you!<eos> Even you, I guess.
There must be some other way.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> No!<eos> Creek, please don't do this.<eos> Believe me...<eos> I wish there was some other me-not-getting-eaten way.<eos> But there isn't.<eos> And now I have to live with this for the rest of my life.<eos> At least you get to die with a clear conscience.<eos> So, in a way... You could say... I'm doing this for you.
You were right, Branch.<eos> The world isn't all cupcakes and rainbows.<eos> Poppy.<eos> You with the sad eyes<eos> Don't be discouraged<eos> Oh, I realize<eos> It's hard to take courage<eos> In a world full of people<eos> You can lose sight of it all<eos> The darkness inside you
Happiness isn't something you put inside.<eos> It's already there.<eos> Sometimes you just need someone to help you find it.<eos> Can I really be happy?<eos> - I want to be happy!<eos> - And me!<eos> And what about me?<eos> Do you really think I can be happy?<eos> Of course!<eos> It's inside you!
The room on lock the way we rock it<eos> So don't stop<eos> Under the lights, when everything goes<eos> Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close<eos> Can't stop, won't stop<eos> When we move well you already know<eos> Let's go, let's work<eos> So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine<eos> Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance<eos> Feel the good-good creeping up on you so just dance, dance, dance, come on
So keep dancing, come on<eos> Yeah, I can't stop the...<eos> My eyes!<eos> Let's do it!<eos> I can't stop the...<eos> I can't stop the...<eos> I can't stop the...<eos> I can't stop the... I can't stop the...<eos> I can't stop the feeling<eos> Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
My eyes!<eos> Let's do it!<eos> I can't stop the...<eos> I can't stop the...<eos> I can't stop the...<eos> I can't stop the... I can't stop the...<eos> I can't stop the feeling<eos> Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance<eos> I can't stop the feeling<eos> Feel the good creeping up on you so just dance, dance, dance
Donkey fucker!<eos> Frank!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Bro!<eos> Douche down!<eos> I'm out of my fucking box!<eos> Cream of Mushroom?<eos> Are you there?<eos> Wake up!<eos> I'm nothing without you!
Look out!<eos> No!<eos> Attention, shoppers.<eos> The store's closed.<eos> - You saved me!<eos> - Well, yeah. Had to do something.<eos> I can't believe you got out of your package.<eos> You would have gone to the Great Beyond.<eos> You'd be there now.<eos> There is no Great Beyond without you, Frank.
That actually makes me feel a little better.<eos> - We must never give in to them.<eos> - That's the opposite... - ...of what I thought you'd say.<eos> - Yes. The gods are always watching, even when we cannot see them.<eos> You think it's too late for me?<eos> Do not worry, bun. I will get you home.<eos> Can I ask why you're helping me?<eos> When I saw you, I felt inside myself a tingling-lingling sensation.<eos> I am sure it was the gods telling me to help you.<eos> It was as though I saw myself in you.

Yeah, I guess I kind of see myself in you too.
You gotta be kidding me, dude!<eos> Toma la pinche douche de la chingada de mierda pendejo son of a bitch!<eos> Yeah!<eos> What she said!<eos> Ay, mi gordita, let's not start eating each other's boxes just yet.<eos> We are still not safe here.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Screw you!<eos> I'm gonna get you, my pretty!<eos> I'm gonna get you and your little sausage too!
Brenda!<eos> Oh, Brenda, there you are!<eos> - Frank!<eos> - You feel so good.<eos> I was afraid you left me because I wasn't fresh.<eos> I was attacked by a douche. He's trying to kill us!<eos> Douche?<eos> Oh, my God, Brenda!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did he come at you?
What are you saying?<eos> I should believe in nothing?<eos> That everything is pointless?<eos> Better than believing bullshit that you can't explain!<eos> Maybe I don't need to explain it because it's something I feel.<eos> Well, I feel like that makes it hard to have a rational conversation.<eos> Eff you, Frank.<eos> You know what?<eos> I was wrong before.<eos> There is a Great Beyond without you... and I'm gonna go there and fill myself with something else!
Let's just stop this, okay?<eos> Okay? You're my bun.<eos> Oh, don't "You're my bun.<eos> Hey, trust me!<eos> Hey, guys, come over here, follow me!"<eos> You're basically saying you don't care about me.<eos> What?<eos> No, I'm not!<eos> Well, actions speak louder than words, and your actions, sir, are deafening.<eos> I can't believe I got out of my package for you... and you won't get back in one for me.
Please don't kill me!<eos> Please, just wait!<eos> What are you?<eos> Are you some kind of magical sausage?<eos> No, no. No, I'm just Barry.<eos> I'm just Barry.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> You can actually understand me?<eos> And I can actually understand you?
Goodbye, Teresa Del Taco.<eos> So long, Bagel.<eos> Traveling with you was... - ...tolerable.<eos> - Oh, you're so sweet.<eos> Later, you flappy fuck.<eos> Well, Teresa, you've done as much as you promised.<eos> You got me back to my aisle safely.<eos> I really can't thank you enough.<eos> Look, Brenda, I'm going to come clean.<eos> I have feelings for you I can't deny.
Hey, fellas. You thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> Pretty fucking sure I am.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Now it's on.<eos> Excuse me. Excuse me.<eos> Can I get by?<eos> Yeah, I just came over here. I couldn't help but notice... you're a little smushed or something.<eos> You have a kind of abnormality.<eos> - Did you get...?<eos> Somebody sit on you?
Eugene Gant is me!<eos> And my mama is Eliza, and my papa is W.O. Gant.<eos> We'll get into all that.<eos> I know it's too long.<eos> I know it's too long.<eos> My lord, you don't know how I struggled to cut the gorgon down.<eos> You don't know how I fought with her.<eos> But I'll cut anything you say.<eos> You just give me the word.<eos> Tom... the book belongs to you.
Oh, mighty.<eos> Oh, indeedy.<eos> "Mr. Wolfe, we intend to publish your book."<eos> No!<eos> Tom!<eos> Oh, my angel, thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, my lover, my love.<eos> I'm so...<eos> I'm so happy for you.
General Grant's memoirs.<eos> Do you know how he came to write them?<eos> This is interesting.<eos> He was dying of throat cancer... and he wanted to leave something behind for his family... so he started writing his autobiography.<eos> He worked every day for hours and hours.<eos> He was in great pain, anguish... but he just kept on writing.<eos> And in the end, he produced the most astounding book.<eos> So very beautiful.<eos> Just a little velvet to see you through.<eos> I'll write you a great book.
Aline!<eos> It's what I do. It's my job.<eos> And this is my job.<eos> When will you ever learn how much an opening night means to me?<eos> Is this all right?<eos> Yes, you look lovely.<eos> Could you please put the scarf on your downstage shoulder when you enter?<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's an important night for me.<eos> I need you here.
You don't understand. You don't understand.<eos> We are at a moment of radical crisis with my book!<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop it! I've never known you not to be at a point... of radical crisis about something.<eos> You really ought to be on the stage.<eos> Max says if we push through...<eos> There we go. "Max says!<eos> Max suggests!<eos> Max instructs!"<eos> He can have you every other day of the week... but I need you tonight.
They interpret the song... letting the music pour on out, riff upon riff... just like I do with words.<eos> To hell with standard forms.<eos> To hell with Flaubert and Henry James.<eos> Be original. Hmm?<eos> Blaze new trails.<eos> That's the whole ugly gorilla.<eos> Ugly gorilla.<eos> Of course.<eos> There.<eos> That's Henry James for you.
I think I'll go rambling.<eos> Maybe Europe.<eos> Don't want to be around when the reviews come out.<eos> What?<eos> There's one paragraph I have to add to the book.<eos> - By God!<eos> - I have to add it.<eos> If you start adding paragraphs, we're sunk.<eos> One paragraph will lead to two and then we'll be here for another year.<eos> Shall I read it to you?
You've never been alone.<eos> First you had your family, then you had me... then you had Max.<eos> You need to spend time alone.<eos> You need to look at how you move through your life.<eos> You hurt me.<eos> You're going to hurt Max.<eos> You shouldn't hurt anyone else.<eos> Human beings aren't fiction.<eos> You have no idea what I had to go through... to get to where I am now.<eos> So I can look at you... and feel... nothing.
Do you know how much you hurt him?<eos> We hurt each other.<eos> Don't be glib with me, Tom.<eos> You don't know what he did to me.<eos> What he did to you?<eos> What did he do?<eos> He made all your dreams come true.<eos> He gave you a career, a life!<eos> There. The Scribner party line.<eos> I expected more from you.

The plural of "myriad" is "myriads", by the way.<eos> Mr. Wolfe?<eos> Pencil.<eos> Oh, no, Mr. Wolfe, I'm sorry, you just lie still.<eos> I'll get the doctor.<eos> Pencil.<eos> Afternoon, Mr. Perkins.<eos> Afternoon, James.<eos> Dear Max...<eos> I've got a hunch. And I wanted to write these words to you.
Afternoon, Mr. Perkins.<eos> Afternoon, James.<eos> Dear Max...<eos> I've got a hunch. And I wanted to write these words to you.<eos> I've made a long voyage and been to a strange country... and I've seen the dark man very close.<eos> And I don't think I was too much afraid of him.<eos> But I want most desperately to live.<eos> I want to see you again. For there is such impossible anguish and regret... for all I can never say to you... for all the work I have to do.<eos> I feel as if a great window has been opened on life.<eos> And if I come through this... I hope to God I am a better man... and can live up to you.

Funds are a little tight, but... It feels good to be free.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right. Thank you for this.<eos> - Hey, J.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I got you for Secret Santa again.<eos> I know.<eos> I got you, too.<eos> Oh, sweetie, that is so great!<eos> Mummy's so proud of you.
All right, it's cancelled.<eos> Clay!<eos> I mean it.<eos> Me, too, Carol.<eos> Guys, the holiday mixer is cancelled. Yes.<eos> Hey! It's cancelled, Clay!<eos> The thing is not happening at all.<eos> I'm not messing with you.<eos> Hey! Stop doing that!<eos> Hey, idiot, I'm looking right at you.
And to complete...<eos> We're closing Walter Davis, you know?<eos> It's going really, really well.<eos> - Hmm. - Phase one's complete.<eos> Why don't you come on in?<eos> I thought you were going to London.<eos> I was on my way to the airport, but I thought I would stop by and have a tour of your bachelor pad.<eos> Well, that didn't take long.<eos> How did you know about my divorce?<eos> Oh, you changed your emergency contact to "self."
Not much.<eos> Merry Christmas!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You got it.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Hi. Eight years - I've been working here.<eos> - Turn around. What are you hoping to find anyway, Carla?<eos> What's your dream contraband?<eos> I just like making you my bitch.
Well, I guess that depends on your homework.<eos> I bet you'd make me brush my teeth so I don't get any cavities.<eos> Oh, we're still doing this. Okay.<eos> I've been a bad boy, Mummy.<eos> Okay, um, do you have some kind of weird fetish?<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> No, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to give you that impression.<eos> - I just got carried away. - Oh.<eos> I just really like you.

Tracey!<eos> Tracey! Hey.<eos> Tracey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Tracey?<eos> Tracey, are you in here?<eos> Oh, pardon me.<eos> Hello? Oh.<eos> Josh, it's happening.<eos> Good for you.
She offered you a job?<eos> - Yeah. Triple the salary. An apartment overlooking Central Park.<eos> I got double and moving costs.<eos> The real difference is I said no.<eos> Listen, I'm not fighting with you about this.<eos> It's silly.<eos> I didn't take the job. Yeah. But you didn't not take it, either.<eos> Because you need a safety net.<eos> Hey, that's who you are.<eos> I'm happy for you.
What?<eos> Yeah, he's broke. Clay is broke.<eos> Who do you think paid for that bouncy house in accounting?<eos> Training that dog to deliver the mail?<eos> The zip-line?<eos> Doughnut Fridays?<eos> It was all Clay!<eos> He spent all of his money trying to keep this branch afloat.<eos> And whenever I questioned him about it, he would say,<eos> "Treat your employees like they're your family "and they'll do great things for you."
Come on. Quickly?<eos> Because I don't know what's gonna happen in there.<eos> Last year I filed a sexual harassment complaint against myself.<eos> - Against yourself. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Andrew, in the copy room, he was changing the toner.<eos> And I pretended to drop something on the ground so that I could bend over and graze his butt with my nose.<eos> And I did.<eos> - That doesn't seem that bad.<eos> - And then I said,<eos> "If you don't fuck me, buster, I will ruin you."
- You did it!<eos> Work never stops. You see that?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hello, yes.<eos> I am happy for you, but I do need you to sign a personal relationship disclosure form before this rounds first. No.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Hey, Mary, sign this.<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> Um, I really like you, um, but maybe we could get, like, a cup of coffee first, or something?
Um, I really like you, um, but maybe we could get, like, a cup of coffee first, or something?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Totally.<eos> That's what I meant by, "Sign this."<eos> - You know what? Forget it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Glass of wine in a family photo?<eos> Look at him in that suit.<eos> What a stud.<eos> He wore that better than you.
Well, it looks like we just hired Walter Davis.<eos> Well, he'll fit right in.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Oh. - What are you doing?<eos> - Winner!<eos> - We weren't racing.<eos> - Well, you weren't.<eos> Why do you think they always make you leave a hospital in a wheelchair?<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> Well, we can't go to breakfast without you.
No, his hands are tied.<eos> I can't get him.<eos> Get him out the car, Mike.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> How's it look?<eos> It ain't good, man.<eos> He ain't gonna make it.<eos> Russell.<eos> I'm going to take care of you now.
Don't tell him your name, homie.<eos> You that cop who busted up Luis the other day?<eos> That was a misunderstanding.<eos> Like, why don't you go bother some other homies, know what I'm saying?<eos> Why don't y'all go to school, you know what I'm saying?<eos> Man, this homie's getting homeschooled, bro.<eos> BY Who?<eos> By me. Teaching 'em mad skills, yo.<eos> For real?<eos> Well, I got a question for you.
Yeah, see, there is Elena.<eos> No, no, no, Irina.<eos> We're doing the job.<eos> We're doing the job.<eos> She has a very nice ass, my sister.<eos> So, this is the objective.<eos> The security key and gate codes you will need.<eos> The case arrives tomorrow night, is there for 24 hours, then it ships.<eos> We meet one more time after this.<eos> How that goes is up to you, and then we decide when Felix comes home from vacation.
And he knows it all.<eos> I ain't asking you.<eos> Do something about Gabe.<eos> Mike...<eos> You see what you made me do, man?<eos> You see what you've made me do?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Mike, Mike, Mike.<eos> Please, don't. You're out, Gabe!<eos> I'm through with you!
You...<eos> So does anyone believe maybe something very big is about to go down?<eos> Sure, boss.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> So, does anyone believe that maybe it's better to do something more than sitting around giving me a bunch of "I don't fucking knows"?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Right.<eos> Give a holla if anything changes.<eos> Surveillance lost Gabe last night.<eos> And Major Crimes is looking for you.
Atlanta Police Department. Put your gun down!<eos> Put it down!<eos> Put it on the ground, man. Wait, wait.<eos> Put it down on the ground.<eos> You're a mark. I'm going to shoot you.<eos> Drop the fucking weapon.<eos> I will shoot you. Will you please shut up?<eos> You're a mark...<eos> Drop it on the ground.<eos> Behind you!
Gabe Welch's girlfriend, my CI. Took two in the chest and one in the back of the head.<eos> I should have seen that coming.<eos> Somebody's cleaning up after himself and my bet is he wears a badge.<eos> Boss?<eos> I need a favor.<eos> Anything-.<eos> I need a hard copy on Leah Green's murder.<eos> I need the name of the lead cop on the scene when they found the body.<eos> Sure, it has to be our little secret though.<eos> Look at you.

It's a locker in the North Station in Paris.<eos> What will you do with that much money?<eos> What will we do.<eos> We'll see.<eos> He won't be out for a while.<eos> We have plenty of time to think about it.<eos> I'll be back in a month.<eos> Judge Ferrer will call you to testify.<eos> Don't worry, everything's in order.<eos> What if she asks me about you?
- They could be your friends.<eos> Go down and ask them.<eos> They won't be very friendly.<eos> - Who sent them?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Anyone looking for Roldan, dead or alive.<eos> That's why we're safe here.<eos> - Where is Roldan?<eos> - I can't tell you.<eos> - You'd be in trouble if you knew.
- Thank you.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Shall I take your plate, sir?<eos> I'm finished, thank you.<eos> I changed the route.<eos> It's all in there.<eos> No, not here.<eos> Put it away.<eos> You leave at dawn.<eos> You'll fly in a private jet and you're the pilot.
We have a deal. I signed an agreement with the Spanish government.<eos> Francisco Paesa has emerged as the Judas who turned the fugitive over to the police, but Minister Belloch chose not to reveal his possible involvement in Roldan's capture.<eos> The Spanish government has never made any deal.<eos> We don't make deals and we don't negotiate.<eos> And I think it's good news that our institutions work.<eos> In less than a year,<eos> Paco had gotten everything back.<eos> He could have stopped there, but Paco would never do that.<eos> LAOTIAN GOVERNMENT SPANISH GOVERNMENT<eos> This came for you.

I got somebody very, very important that I want you to meet.<eos> The best trainer in the history of boxing.<eos> Ray Arcel.<eos> He has trained more world champs than anyone else in boxing history.<eos> Relax.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I told you I would bring you to the Madison Square Garden.<eos> Have I ever said anything that didn't happen?<eos> This man can make you world champ.
What's wrong with you guys?<eos> That's Ray Arcel<eos> Ray Arcel... 18 championships of the world.<eos> Plomo Quiñones... cero.<eos> Now you got two trainers.<eos> You got Panama.<eos> Our Panama.<eos> And you got the man who knows...<eos> You really have balls, Eleta.<eos> I'm trying to make you world champ.
Come here!<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> It's okay, I don't bite.<eos> You are nuts.<eos> Marry me!<eos> I don't even know you!<eos> Exactly!<eos> We'll get the rest of our lives to know each other.<eos> You are really crazy.<eos> Crazy for you.
How's the wife?<eos> She's good, thanks.<eos> 20 years since your heroic mission to expand boxing to the nation.<eos> Boxing expanded.<eos> I wasn't wrong.<eos> Yes and no.<eos> But yes, the sport makes for fantastic television.<eos> And now you're back.<eos> Sort of.<eos> I like you, Ray.
Durán may punch himself out.<eos> Don't rush in.<eos> You got him.<eos> Just keep on him.<eos> Remember the strategy.<eos> He wants you to get tired.<eos> I don't care about the strategy.<eos> - I'll kill him.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> If you don't go in with a feint and a jab, he's going to nail you on the way in.

Fighter of the year?<eos> This clown?<eos> He hasn't fought a man in his life.<eos> He is the symbol of American sports.<eos> My balls.<eos> He's the symbol of American Sports.<eos> If you want your Torrijos-Carter treaty... to mean anything for this country... before 1999... destroy their idol and make them respect Panama.<eos> That idol goes down in one round.<eos> Let me see it.<eos> For you I got 15 rounds or more.

- Well, it has to do...<eos> - You know, you want to be, you want to be, you want to be a warrior, you want to avenge your people, fine by me.<eos> Avenge your people.<eos> Be a warrior.<eos> But real warriors do not do what you did.<eos> They don't mess with women the way you just did.<eos> And if you want me in your corner, you cannot do that again.<eos> Well, well, okay, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry to him.<eos> I say I'm sorry to you, but I'm not gonna say I'm sorry to him.
...in what must be startling for Leonard, who, in this very stadium surprised the planet by winning Olympic gold.<eos> It's a wonderful day.<eos> That's okay, baby!<eos> It's your night tonight!<eos> You're dead meat, Durán!<eos> - That's right.<eos> - You're nothing.<eos> Keep him close to your body.<eos> Don't chase the lady.<eos> Let her come to you.
He doesn't know that even for himself.<eos> That the money is the least important thing.<eos> He's a professional fighter.<eos> He can lose that weight.<eos> Three months to lose almost 40 pounds.<eos> You know what that does to a fighter?<eos> I want what's best for him.<eos> - I want us to do what is best for him.<eos> - That's not best for him.<eos> That's best for you but not for him.
- You want to rest?<eos> - I'm tired, man.<eos> - You want to rest?<eos> - Yes.<eos> To rest is to rust.<eos> And you know that.<eos> You're the kind of fighter that's gotta stay on your toes and if you don't stay on your toes, then you're gone, that's it.<eos> And you can do this.<eos> But you're going to have to decide to do this.<eos> Nobody can do it for you.
The Zone police used tear gas and fire hoses to drive off the demonstrators.<eos> I understand that.<eos> I can try to convince Don King to delay the fight.<eos> But we got to be ready to fight in case you have to.<eos> Okay.<eos> You still mad?<eos> Don't know what to tell you.<eos> Forgive me?<eos> Okay.<eos> I need you.
Yet here we were, reminding him that he didn't matter.<eos> That decisions were made in the back room and he was only a circus animal we needed for ticket sales.<eos> Approved.<eos> You're going to see blood in this fight.<eos> I don't like clowns.<eos> When you come into the ring, you come to fight, not to dance or to clown.<eos> He's imitating Ali all the time, that's what he does.<eos> He doesn't have any style.<eos> I'm going to knock you out, 'cause imitators are losers.<eos> And I don't like you.
- You're let...<eos> - I'm chasing the motherfucker.<eos> You're let...<eos> L-Look at me.<eos> You don't need to do that, all right?<eos> You're about to be welterweight champion of the world.<eos> Get out of your head!<eos> You're not doing what you should be doing.<eos> You know how to do it, get out there.<eos> I want to be proud of you.
And it has nothing to do with you.<eos> We're talking about me now.<eos> I'm old. I'm tired.<eos> You don't need me.<eos> You never really did.<eos> You're a naturally great fighter.<eos> You have great fighter's instincts.<eos> I was just there to support you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I need you in my corner, Ray.
You're an adult now.<eos> You have children of your own.<eos> You don't need a father.<eos> You need somebody to bring the street back into you.<eos> - Talk to Plomo.<eos> - Plomo?<eos> He knows you better than anybody.<eos> He's been with you from the beginning.<eos> I'll help you get a fight.<eos> I'll be watching you all the time.
- Okay.<eos> - And please, always remember. The American you're talking to now? He gave you the best years of his life.<eos> Schmuck.<eos> You have no reason to feel guilty here.<eos> Well, he's my fighter, so...<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> You need to do what you think is best for everyone.<eos> What do you think is best?<eos> It depends.<eos> You think that he's the one that needs you the most right now?
Merry fucking Christmas.<eos> ♪ When you pine for the sunshine Of a friendly gaze ♪<eos> ♪ For the holidays You can't beat home sweet home ♪<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> Willie?<eos> It's me, Thurman.<eos> Willie, what are you doing?<eos> Did you get yourself stuck up there?<eos> Okay, I'll go.<eos> But this package came to my house for you, Willie.
No!<eos> Fuck no!<eos> But you said that when I was 21 that you'd pop my cherry.<eos> I said I'd get it done by somebody else.<eos> Besides that, I'm a fucking guy.<eos> You didn't turn funny, did you?<eos> Am I funny?<eos> So you haven't done it with anybody yet.<eos> Not a man or a woman or an animal or anything.<eos> No, I waited for you.
That's the bulls-eye.<eos> Then you just start tugging on your little soldier.<eos> Wait till he gets to attention, then poke him in there.<eos> Keep poking it in there till he spits up.<eos> You're gonna need a raincoat.<eos> She'll have one, so don't worry about that.<eos> As soon as you're done, run to the bathroom, wash your crotch.<eos> That way, you don't wake up wondering why you got oatmeal in your carpet.<eos> Breathe through your mouth so that you don't puke.<eos> Shouldn't be a problem for you.
Randall sounds Irish.<eos> I want something whiter.<eos> I'm Davis, you're Cook.<eos> End of fucking story.<eos> You got one job this time.<eos> Open a safe.<eos> Till then, just keep your drunken deviant fucking mouth shut.<eos> You know what you need?<eos> You need some pussy.<eos> I'll see if I can find you a cat somewhere.
Bringing food and shelter to those in need."<eos> Hold the fucking phone.<eos> I traveled all the way across the country to rob a goddamn charity?<eos> Why?<eos> You got a problem with that?<eos> Yeah, you damn right I got a problem with it.<eos> No way these assholes have 2 million bucks.<eos> Will you keep it down, man.<eos> I don't know.<eos> - I see they made you some chairs already.
Just did a little digging, a little Googling, a dry hand job to Isaac in Accounting.<eos> Boom.<eos> The concert's in five days.<eos> Meantime, we wear the suit, hit the pavement, we ring the bell, just like the rest of the volunteers.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, it looks to me like you jackals already got the whole job figured out.<eos> What do you need me for?<eos> You can crack a fucking safe.<eos> Well, I'd like to say it's because I've missed you, my angel.<eos> But I got a touch of the Parkinson's and my hearing ain't what it used to be, so I'm gonna need you on the safe.

And when do you pull your little Roy Rogers pistol out on me again?<eos> I said I was sorry.<eos> You gotta let that shit go, Willie!<eos> No, I think I'll hang on to it.<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> If I cut ties with every numbnut who tried to shoot me, I never would've gotten pregnant with you.
Be just like old times.<eos> - Old times?<eos> - Mm-hmm. You mean a living fucking nightmare?<eos> Why didn't you say so?<eos> You gotta be shitting me.<eos> Good luck with the shakes.<eos> Willie, come on.<eos> What, you don't trust your mother?<eos> Yeah, I trust her about as far as I can throw you.<eos> And I trust you about as far as I can throw her.
I get it.<eos> You're mad at me.<eos> You think I was really ready to be a mom at 13?<eos> We were gonna wait at least another year.<eos> I mean, the one time your son of a bitch father didn't put it in my ass, I had to go and get pregnant.<eos> - Shit happens.<eos> - That's fucking beautiful.<eos> Look, I'm not gonna pretend I was a perfect mother.<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> You made me take the fall for you when I was 11.
Well, you shave a minute off that, you may be good for something.<eos> - What about the alarm system?<eos> - It's a Centaur 2100.<eos> We power it down, we have ten minutes before it reboots.<eos> But I'm gonna need a key to the electrical room to access it.<eos> - It's the only way in.<eos> - Ah, shit, how are we gonna get that?<eos> Don't even think about it, Willie.<eos> That big bitch is mine.<eos> He should show you some respect.
Hey, Greta.<eos> Could you, uh, get me a rag and a real drink, please?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Put a fucking diaper on.<eos> - Hey, you're wet.<eos> - No shit.<eos> What can I do for you?
Rigor mortis just make the pussy tighter.<eos> Where's Cook?<eos> You see that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - We still got it, kid.<eos> - Yeah, I guess so.<eos> It was always supposed to be this way, William.<eos> You, me.<eos> Before I fucked it all up.<eos> But even when I was in the joint, I thought of you.
- Fourth?<eos> And August.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, fuck a duck.<eos> Anyway, uh, the point is that I miss this.<eos> Just think of the damage we could do.<eos> Just the two of us.<eos> All the time.<eos> Hey. You know what?<eos> I got you a gift.
Yeah.<eos> I found this in the bedside table.<eos> Think fast.<eos> The fuck?<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> - Oh, that's for me.<eos> Shut up.<eos> - Pew-pew. - Don't touch me with the fucking thing.<eos> No, seriously.<eos> I did get you a gift.
I fucking told you that I ain't that guy.<eos> Life sucks a big, giant dick, kid.<eos> But you're a fucking man now and you gotta face up to it.<eos> Welcome to the shit show.<eos> - But you're my family.<eos> - No, I'm not your family.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'll try to be a man. For you.<eos> - No, not for me.<eos> For you.
The plan.<eos> - Cutting her out after the grab.<eos> Right?<eos> - Yeah, yeah. We're good.<eos> Come on, shitstick.<eos> Bring it on home to Mama.<eos> Goddamn.<eos> Hey, Cook!<eos> Hey, Cook!<eos> Mind if join you?
Now we're gonna get this party started with an old favorite.<eos> - This is all your handiwork.<eos> The money you helped us raise, it gave Christmas to these kids.<eos> You're part of the family now.<eos> Boring.<eos> Ooh, no teeth.<eos> That's hot.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Who's got the pussy lips now, motherfucker?<eos> - I never gave you this. - Thank you.
Yeah, I'm real proud of you.<eos> Well, you know something, Mama?<eos> Maybe you're not as smart as you think you are.<eos> Did you forget about this?<eos> Oh, how could I have forgotten?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Shoot me, shitstick.<eos> They're blanks, Willie.<eos> You really think I'd be dumb enough to put real bullets in that gun?<eos> Well, I ain't afraid of you, bitch!
Mother lode! Today be the day.<eos> Geological reports on this are highly encouraging. We're taking a very aggressive look.<eos> Prospectus?<eos> Of course. I can have my secretary send you one right out.<eos> But I gotta tell you, this offering is already oversubscribed.<eos> But we can always try and get you in on the next one.<eos> Oh, no, no. Yeah, I understand.<eos> You watchin' the time?<eos> It's 7:15, Kenny. Oh, Christ!<eos> What would I do without you?
The fire's gone out of that one.<eos> Well, what are you talkin' about?<eos> In the opinions of my fellow esteemed geologists. The whole thing I'm quoting here, it's a crock of shit.<eos> Well, what the hell, you know?<eos> You called it wrong. What are you going to do?<eos> There's no right or wrong in this business.<eos> Some have hits and misses.<eos> There's gold here.<eos> I'm glad you said that, Mike.<eos> I truly am, because I believe you.

Said the right things but, in here, you never fuckin' believed it, did ya?<eos> You never believed in me, did you, Katie?<eos> Hmm? You like to be losin', don't ya?<eos> Damn, you don't know.<eos> Come on, admit it.<eos> Does it feel comfortable Kay?<eos> These people are using you.<eos> They don't care about you!<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> And they certainly don't believe in you.
I got gold.<eos> Now, can we win?<eos> Baby, could you just let me have the win?<eos> We're winning!<eos> Did it ever occur to you that I know what I'm doing?<eos> I hope you do.<eos> I do.<eos> I love what's in there.<eos> More than you'll ever know.<eos> These guys are gonna tear you up.
It was April... of '88, when I was on the balls of my ass... scrambling.<eos> Not exactly uncharted waters for me.<eos> I was in deep.<eos> I think it's pretty unlikely we'll ever see your partner again.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> A lot of very powerful people are very angry at Michael Acosta.<eos> What happened?<eos> What happened?<eos> 17 billion dollars of value disappeared overnight.<eos> Mike Acosta waves goodbye to you in the ballroom downstairs... and goes back to Indonesia on a jet chartered with Washoe funds.
It's been goin' on for fuckin' centuries!<eos> Were you aware Mike Acosta was salting the Washoe core samples?<eos> No.<eos> You had no knowledge Mike Acosta was perpetrating a fraud?<eos> No.<eos> You were not in collusion with Mike Acosta on the Kencana gold strike?<eos> No, I fuckin' thought I won I won the lottery.<eos> Did you profit from the Kencana fraud?<eos> No.<eos> Did anyone close to you profit?
Mr. Kenny Wells.<eos> You are free to go.<eos> Well, looky there!<eos> Somebody believes me.<eos> I wouldn't go overboard.<eos> In fact, I wouldn't leave the state... or start buying new stuff or chartering any more jets.<eos> I gotta sneak by the guy at the Front Desk 'cause I can't pay the hotel bill.<eos> I can't be a party to that information.<eos> Good luck, Mr. Wells.<eos> We'll be keeping an eye on you.
Yeah, I know, Hart.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Good to see you too, Kenny.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> You want coffee?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> The place looks great.<eos> So do you, Kay.<eos> I made curtains. My fabric.<eos> Some stuff came for you, some mail.
She was the love of my life. I'll miss her every goddamn day.<eos> But she told me on her deathbed, "You get back out there again."<eos> I haven't had sex in 15 years, Jason, and I want to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!<eos> So that's what this is all about? This whole thing.<eos> You didn't want to be with me.<eos> You wanted me to drive you down to Boca so I could be your fucking wingman?<eos> Obviously I made a bad decision because you're nothing but a cock-blocking machine. I don't know what you are.<eos> You're like the Israeli Iron Dome defense system, - but with vaginas instead of missiles. - What?<eos> You're like some sort of Cock-blocking Terminator sent back from the future to cock-block humans.<eos> The robots should have sent you instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger, you could have cock-blocked John Connor's parents and he would never have been born!
- Yeah, I know.<eos> Clearly.<eos> Which is why I don't understand how we got so far off schedule.<eos> Sometimes life is just a fart zone, and you enter at your own risk.<eos> Have you been reading shit off the shot glasses and the shirts in here and just saying it like it's wisdom?<eos> I was seriously trying to talk to you, man.<eos> Do you realize the stakes here?<eos> - You're ridiculous! - Smile.<eos> You've had a phone this entire fucking time?<eos> What else don't I know about you?
Do you realize the stakes here?<eos> - You're ridiculous! - Smile.<eos> You've had a phone this entire fucking time?<eos> What else don't I know about you?<eos> How the hell do you know how to speak Arabic?<eos> Dad's never said anything about that.<eos> That's because your dad doesn't really know much about me.<eos> I was away with the army during most of his childhood.<eos> So we were never that close.<eos> Is that why he doesn't like you?
What do I have?<eos> A dead wife, dying friends.<eos> A few fucking good years left if I'm lucky.<eos> And you know what? It fucking freaks me out!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, I don't expect you to understand.<eos> You're young.<eos> You have a long, long time before you have to look into that abyss.<eos> But the way I see it, having sex with that girl is my last stand.<eos> And I can't do it without you. So I'm asking you.
You know the song.<eos> You know every word.<eos> You're going to make me do it all alone?<eos> Fine.<eos> For all those times you stood by me<eos> For all the truth that you made me see<eos> For all the joy you brought to my life<eos> For all the wrong that you made right<eos> For every dream you made come true<eos> For all the love I found in you
- What the fuck did you Google?<eos> - Okay, well... there's another best part then.<eos> "Jason Patrick Kelly will wed Meredith Miriam Goldstein "at Jericho Temple on Saturday, March 27th."<eos> Wait, that's... next Saturday.<eos> Wait, you're grandfather and grandson?<eos> That is so fucked up. That is so hot.<eos> I mean, that is so fucked up.<eos> So...<eos> Are you getting married next weekend? I was.<eos> I was getting married... - but then I met you, and now I don't...
- Bingo-bango.<eos> - OMG.<eos> - What the fuck? That's not mine!<eos> - "What the fuck?" - That's not mine!<eos> - The fuck?<eos> Well, it looks like Spring Break is finally drug free!<eos> Come on, let's go. Let's go, pretty boy. Shall we?<eos> No, it doesn't go down that way.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - I'll wait for you, Grandpa.
Don't you fucking judge me. You have no idea what I had with your grandmother.<eos> And everything I've done these last few days I've done for a reason.<eos> You were about to fuck up royally by getting married, and you fucking know it! Yeah?<eos> What the fuck am I supposed to do now?<eos> Chase around some college girl that doesn't even want to fucking talk to me?<eos> Not know what the fuck I'm doing for the rest of my life?<eos> Yeah, because at least you'd be thinking for yourself for a change.<eos> - What the fuck does that even mean?<eos> - Your father has lorded over every decision you've made in your adult life, and Meredith is just the latest example of that!<eos> She's not right for you, Jason.

It was a "fuck rampage" for you. - How?
Let's find out.<eos> - Don't be a jerk, Andrew.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Hey, Mikey. Mikey.<eos> Did you know the Indians that used to live around here thought this place was haunted?<eos> Legend says, that the guardians of their spirit world lived in the rocks and the trees, and that one day they're gonna come back into our world.<eos> And when they do, it means the whole world's gonna end.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They're right behind you!
- I'm sorry, Dad.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Can I go for my driving test soon?<eos> A promise is a promise in this family, right?<eos> You know your mom and me are not the enemy, right?<eos> We just want you to get healthy and happy and strong.<eos> Get through this crap and put it all behind you.<eos> We only want you better, sweetheart.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look at you!
One, two, three.<eos> Mikey.<eos> One, one...<eos> Who are you talking to, honey?<eos> The Sky People.<eos> They want us to come and live with them now.<eos> Our time here is over.<eos> The Sky People...<eos> Where are they?<eos> They're right behind you.
A week later, he's better.<eos> There's like life in his eyes again, and then four weeks later, he's playing baseball.<eos> So, is that a miracle?<eos> I don't know what you call it.<eos> Tell Bronny to call Wendy.<eos> She'll tell her more about it.<eos> But you've got to call this woman, I'm telling ya.<eos> Sometimes the answer you're looking for is gonna come from someplace you're not looking.<eos> Anyway, you get back, all right?<eos> I need you, hombre.

And the only one who could handle either of us was Dad.<eos> I hate you.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey. Dad had a nearly impossible task.<eos> Having to manage us both.<eos> I know kids can be mean.<eos> But if you get a chance, fart into their backpacks.<eos> I wish you were small.<eos> Then I'd at least have one person to have lunch with.<eos> Instead, the most attention I got at school was from these three.<eos> Nobody likes you.
Excuse me.<eos> And then, out of the clear blue, an angel appeared.<eos> Can you move, please?<eos> She was dressed like a small elderly gentleman. And her breath smelled of SweeTARTS.<eos> You want to hold him?<eos> But don't squash him.<eos> Hi, guy.<eos> If you want, you could be his other mom with me.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm gonna be your other mom and take such good care of you.
I accidentally suffocated him two hours later in my pencil box.<eos> But I had finally made my first friend.<eos> We told each other things we never thought we'd say out loud.<eos> Once, my grandpa's pajama flap accidentally came open, and I saw his wiener and got real sad.<eos> My mom has to take medicine, or she'll get upset and buy too much at the mall.<eos> It's true.<eos> It turned out Krista's life wasn't perfect either. Why, this pudding is delicious!<eos> I'm walking away.<eos> What am I, your mother?<eos> Am I supposed to babysit you?
- Yeah. Thanks for driving, by the way.<eos> I don't have a license 'cause I'm like, "Why not just have people drive you?"<eos> People make such a big deal about being able to do things for themselves.<eos> - That was a joke.<eos> I failed the test. - Oh.<eos> Hello.<eos> You can get that.<eos> Uh, no. It's cool.<eos> Um, hey, look, there's no line at the Ferris wheel.<eos> So, tell me something I don't know about you, Erwin.
This has been a really fun night.<eos> I'm sorry if I flipped out on you on the Ferris wheel earlier.<eos> Oh.<eos> No, my timing was just bizarre.<eos> I'm going through a lot of shit right now.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> I'm sorry you're going through stuff.<eos> You're a really great guy, Erwin.<eos> Aww. No, I'm serious.<eos> I look at you and I just see this really, really, really old man.
They literally have a seizure if you take their phone away for a second.<eos> They can't communicate without emojis.<eos> And they actually think that the world wants to know that they are,<eos> "Eating a taco, exclamation point, smiley face, smiley face." Like we give a fuck.<eos> I am an old soul.<eos> I like old music and old movies and even old people.<eos> Bottom line is I have nothing in common with the people out there, and they have nothing in common with me.<eos> Nadine?<eos> Max?<eos> Maybe nobody likes you.
- Mmm.<eos> All right, you know what?<eos> Here's something you're not gonna guess. Hmm.<eos> Your dad would be so disappointed in the way you're turning out.<eos> Did you just take my keys?<eos> Nadine.<eos> Don't you take that car!<eos> I will call the police!<eos> "Nick, I'm just gonna say it.<eos> "I like you.

But look where it led me.<eos> This is the face of hope.<eos> All right.<eos> Good night.<eos> - I'll be in, in a minute. - All right. Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Say, "Night-night."<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Night-night, Daddy. Night-night.<eos> I think that's for you.
You don't need to pretend to give a shit about me just because people are watching.<eos> Oh, give me a break. Oh, face it.<eos> You can't wait to take me home so you can be Mom's little hero.<eos> You live for that shit.<eos> Just let it go. Darian.<eos> Darian?<eos> Hey, I just want you to know you're right, Nadine.<eos> - Darian, we don't need to do this...<eos> - You're right about everything!<eos> I don't give a shit about you.
But I think we both know what needs to be said right now, so I'm just gonna come right out and say it.<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - See you Monday.<eos> Hey.<eos> Look, I just wanted to say that<eos> I'm sorry for being a bitch tonight.<eos> For the past couple weeks.<eos> And the past 17 years before that.<eos> I know this isn't any easier for you. I know that.
Oh, thanks!<eos> And I got the message, all right?<eos> I know...<eos> I know she's me.<eos> But I already figured out how great you are.<eos> You're so fucking great.<eos> You're like the best person I know.<eos> What?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Um, the film wasn't about you.
I won't stand for this.<eos> Liz, the boy's gotta learn how to shoot. I won't stand for this. Liz, the boy's gotta learn how to shoot.<eos> I won't have it. Liz, the boy's gotta learn how to shoot. I won't have it.<eos> Well, he's gonna do it anyway. I won't have it. Well, he's gonna do it anyway.<eos> Better here than sneaking off somewhere else.<eos> You're scaring your mother.<eos> She ain't my mother.<eos> Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing...<eos> For inwardly, they are ravening wolves.<eos> Jesus is the Shepherd who protects you and your family from those wolves.
This afternoon, what were you and the Reverend talking about?<eos> Did he talk about me?<eos> Mama, are you evil?<eos> The reverend said you murdered a man.<eos> He says he's here to punish you.<eos> To take you back where he came from.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she loves you.<eos> Shoot me.<eos> Behind you.
My name is Joanna.<eos> Frank!<eos> Frank!<eos> Meng!<eos> Meng, you prosperous fucker, you.<eos> Look at you.<eos> And what do we have here?<eos> My name's Joanna.<eos> Well, it is a pleasure to meet you.<eos> Come on now, spin around, let me get a look at you.
I...<eos> Dance...<eos> On Tuesday?<eos> I only drink on Tuesdays.<eos> I only drink on Tuesdays.<eos> I...<eos> Kill...<eos> Frank?<eos> That's suicide.<eos> But they'll come after you.
How old are you now, child?<eos> Thirteen.<eos> A full-grown woman has...<eos> Has duties in life that a young girl can't fulfill.<eos> Duties imposed by our Lord himself.<eos> Come with me, please.<eos> Your mother does not always assume responsibilities the way she should.<eos> She does not comply with her natural duties.<eos> Do you understand what I mean?<eos> God has made you a woman so soon for a reason.
I'd rather die first.<eos> The serpent said to the woman,<eos> "you surely will not die!<eos> "For God knows that in the day you eat from it,<eos> "your eyes will be opened,<eos> "and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."<eos> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate.<eos> And then the Lord God said to the woman,<eos> "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.<eos> "In pain you will bring forth children, "yet your desire will be for your husband. "And he will rule over you."
Mama!<eos> No, Mama!<eos> Mama!<eos> No!<eos> Mama!<eos> Mama!<eos> I will do to your daughter exactly as I did to you.<eos> I am going to hurt you as much as I can.<eos> I will leave the door open.<eos> I brought you this.
You leave footprints on the beach and somehow they are gone.<eos> Like its just today, over again.<eos> They say that your teen years are for making friends and having fun.<eos> Which made me feel even worse.<eos> Hey, Amy.<eos> It's Jake. I'm in your math class.<eos> - Hey do not forget your adult diapers.<eos> - Yeah right.<eos> Jake.<eos> Its a phone for you.
I thought I could protect you.<eos> I should have told you years ago.<eos> Grandpa!<eos> Tell me... tell me what?<eos> GRANDPA!<eos> Shelly behind you!<eos> There was no one there.<eos> May I say Jake... that considering this was only a month ago I think you're doing exceptionally well.<eos> Apart from being crazy?<eos> Having nightmares and anxiety doesn't make you crazy.
Right on time.<eos> Ms. Peregrine.<eos> Delighted to meet you.<eos> I do hope I'm not going to have the pub landlord knocking on my door with the police again?<eos> I've had to kill them twice this month.<eos> Its been terribly inconvenient.<eos> We may have broken some things, that's all.<eos> And Olive may have started a tiny fire.<eos> But they were going to hurt Jake.<eos> Look at you!
The fact we are not all eight years of old's seems to have eluded Ms. Peregrine.<eos> You can borrow some of Abe's clothes.<eos> His room's in the attic<eos> Jake.<eos> Come meet Enoch, properly.<eos> Well, you must feel pretty out of place.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I am used to it.<eos> I wasn't worried.<eos> Some advice for you though.
Why would I be jealous?<eos> All of you can go marry Jake for all I care.<eos> Do not be mean, Enoch.<eos> She doesn't want to.<eos> She's just excited to have a visitor.<eos> Nobody is marrying anybody.<eos> Now eat up your food before it gets cold.<eos> Hugh.<eos> Where's your net?<eos> It must be very strange for you Jake.
Ms. Peregrine, if my grandpa was involved with dangerous people I need to tell the police.<eos> To the police?<eos> Are you implying Abe died an unnatural death?<eos> I found him in the woods with eyes missing.<eos> I'd say that was pretty unnatural.<eos> Unless essential. I don't discuss unpleasant matters.<eos> An Ymbryne's is a duty to protect children, Jake.<eos> I am not a child.<eos> He wanted you to tell me everything.<eos> How frustrating for you.
Well, here we all are.<eos> Move, Olive.<eos> If you're going to be like then I do not want to be your friend.<eos> Enoch!<eos> Leave Victor alone.<eos> It really upsets Bromwyn.<eos> Stop fussing, Fiona.<eos> Don't you think Jake should meet everybody?<eos> He's trying to frighten you away, Jake.<eos> He was always jealous of Abe and now he's jealous of you.

- Loop entrances can be anywhere.<eos> The one in london is in a subway tunnel.<eos> - Sure, this is it?<eos> - I think so<eos> Miller, there's something I need you to do first.<eos> Alright, I know.<eos> Look!<eos> There's the tower.<eos> Its not far.<eos> Easy for you say!
I go to this guy in Beverly Hills.<eos> - Andrew.<eos> - Dr. Andrew.<eos> - She is in love with him.<eos> - Of course I love him.<eos> Look at me.<eos> He calls me The Bionic Woman.<eos> Is that a compliment?<eos> I hear your parents are dead.<eos> That must be really hard for you.
Because you can always tell when beauty is manufactured.<eos> And if you aren't born beautiful, you never will be.<eos> - That's terrible.<eos> - No, it's true.<eos> I don't think you can always tell.<eos> Dean, we're having a little debate over here, and we need your expertise.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know Gigi, right?<eos> Well, I mean, we just met.<eos> Will you stand up so that he can take a look at you?

Please.<eos> Your mother is waiting for you.<eos> Mr. Hughes!<eos> Mr. Hughes, we have wonderful news!<eos> The court of appeals has reversed the TWA judgment.<eos> You get all the money back!<eos> Levar!<eos> Are you actually so bird-brained you think I didn't know that?<eos> I get up earlier than you do.<eos> Hey, look at you.
Frank, where do I put it?<eos> - Do I pin this on?<eos> That goes around my neck?<eos> We are being told we will hear from Howard Hughes immediately.<eos> We are standing by.<eos> I think that's the man I'm gonna be talking to,<eos> - but we'll see... - Frank!<eos> This belongs to him.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Matt, I'll wait for you in the living room.

I'm really fun.<eos> Everybody says that about me.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Say hello to Red, everyone.<eos> Hello!<eos> Hi, Red.<eos> Hello, birds I won't get to know well.<eos> Hey, apparently somebody didn't get the memo that we like to start on time because you're about two minutes late.<eos> Don't let it happen again. Hi, my name is Chuck. I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.<eos> I like you a lot. I can tell.
Terence?<eos> Put on your seat belts, everyone.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Well, this is dynamite.<eos> There you are.<eos> Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!<eos> Delicious bird eggy-weggy.<eos> You can't eat eggs!<eos> What are you gonna do? I'm a foodie.<eos> It's over. You're finished, Eyebrows.
So, what do you teach?<eos> Oh. It's so boring.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Poetics.<eos> Poetry isn't boring.<eos> It is when you study it under a microscope.<eos> Then why do you do it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Lack of imagination.<eos> I don't believe you.

- Hey.<eos> - Emilio Del Oro.<eos> How do you know Dima?<eos> Oh, we met on holiday.<eos> How do you feel about Paris?<eos> How long are you gonna stay?<eos> How long are you in town for?<eos> Oh, we leave the day after tomorrow.<eos> Okay, so tomorrow we play tennis.<eos> I'll beat the shit out of you.
- Good morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Too early for a glass of champagne?<eos> Never too early for me.<eos> Professor!<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Gail, you beautiful woman.<eos> - Everything okay?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I've got clothes for you.
- I've never been here before.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - Shall we have a seat?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did you have a good night, Professor?<eos> Great.<eos> And yours?<eos> Shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> After you.
No one to move until then.<eos> This... Pen doesn't work.<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> One last signature here transferring all remaining funds to the Arena Bank.<eos> The only time my father ever hit me...<eos> I remember that story.<eos> I also remember when you were a little child, Kolya, and your father and I took you hunting.<eos> You were 12, maybe 13 years old and you were so excited.<eos> You couldn't wait to kill something.<eos> And then we saw this buck and you raised the rifle, but the buck just looked at you, kept on grazing.

What, so we're still taking orders from the Kremlin?<eos> Where are you hiding them?<eos> We have a meeting with the secretary tomorrow.<eos> You'd better convince him what Dima has to offer is worth the grief.<eos> Hector.<eos> You look ravishing.<eos> It's really noisy.<eos> Time for bed, my sweet.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll read to you.
I'm going to make sure that your plan to help your Russian friends doesn't go as smoothly as they expect.<eos> And then I'll watch them fuck you up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Andrei?<eos> Yes.<eos> I tried to call you so many times.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Everything will be okay.<eos> I'll look after you.
But I skip the big ticket items, and look for the small-ball shit that giant defense contractors ignore.<eos> Everybody's fighting over the same pie.<eos> But they're ignoring the crumbs.<eos> I live on crumbs, like a rat.<eos> And when you're dealing with the Pentagon, crumbs are worth millions.<eos> These listings seemed to go on forever.<eos> And according to Efraim, they did.<eos> - Thanks, man.<eos> So, I don't get it.<eos> If there's an entire defense industry, why would the Pentagon want to buy anything from you?
- I make them on my laptop.<eos> Now you're just making shit up.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I kept everything, you dumb fuck!<eos> I even have copies of the bank statements that we photoshopped and sent to the government.<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> I can bury you.<eos> Us.<eos> I think you meant to say, you can bury us.<eos> Because anything that implicates me, implicates you as well.
Yeah, but still.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Sure.<eos> When we met in Vegas at the blackjack table, was that a coincidence?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Can I ask you another question?<eos> My driver in Albania went missing.<eos> Do you know what happened to him?<eos> It's a piece of my end on the Afghan deal.<eos> It's for you.
I've heard we have crippled the Japanese Imperial Navy. Well...<eos> Much in large part to the men of the USS Indianapolis.<eos> Hear, hear!<eos> Do you think the war's going to continue, son?<eos> I don't really know, sir.<eos> Do you have a son in the military?<eos> Heavens no, son.<eos> He's got money in steel.<eos> That's right, war is good for business, and business is good for America.<eos> - We're proud of you, son.
How we doing here?<eos> The Japs put a pretty big hole in the ship, but the big guns are fine, sir.<eos> Sir?<eos> Lieutenant Standish reporting for duty again, sir.<eos> Ready to turn these sailors into a lean, mean fighting machine.<eos> And may I say, my father, Admiral Percy Standish, sends his regards.<eos> Looks like you got the damage from that Zero - repaired pretty quickly.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> We finished it today.<eos> The fact that you lost only nine men is a solid testament to you and your crew.
Maybe we shouldn't. Shut up!<eos> Shut up, Quinn!<eos> Back up, boys.<eos> I said back up now!<eos> All right.<eos> Fair fight.<eos> You and me.<eos> You don't know nothing about fair.<eos> You ain't on a ship now, peckerwood.<eos> If they move, cut 'em. If you don't, I cut you.
- Am I understood?<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> The Indianapolis is a heavy cruiser designed to take out enemy ships and aircraft, but our guns are useless against submarines.<eos> That's why normally, we are sent out with an escort of destroyers in front of us that act as blockers.<eos> Their job is to detect and destroy enemy subs with depth charges before they can get to us.<eos> Many of the crew are mere boys with no idea of the danger we face out here at sea.<eos> If we are fired upon by an enemy sub and if miraculously we spot it early enough, we have at maximum four minutes before the torpedo arrives.<eos> Our main defense is to get the ship watertight point station zebra so any hull rupture doesn't spread and sink us.<eos> For the secret mission, we are in effect a glorified postal service delivering two packages with no protection, but mine is not to reason why.<eos> Hey, W Division was seven seconds faster than everybody else, even without you.
For he's a jolly good fellow<eos> Which nobody can deny.<eos> Congrats on your last tour, chaps.<eos> Thanks, boys.<eos> I think I'm gonna take this one back in my quarters.<eos> Come on, short timer, stay with us.<eos> I do appreciate Deuce for not sneaking any unclothed women in here tonight.<eos> Listen up, Standish is on the prowl, all right?<eos> So keep it down.<eos> Alvin, I know that's tough for you.
Night watch is that way.<eos> - He took the ring.<eos> - What?<eos> The engagement ring, Deuce took it when he pulled me out of the fight,<eos> - pickpocketing son of a bitch.<eos> - Come on, Deuce?<eos> Ugh, you smell like a distillery.<eos> Might as well go on and admit. You was scared, boy.<eos> Scared?<eos> Of you?
Not with him, no.<eos> Keep playing.<eos> Keep playing.<eos> Theo, What in the hell you writing in that book now, boy?<eos> "Dear Mama, I should've learned how to swim.<eos> But now my black ass gonna drown."<eos> What are you all laughing at, huh?<eos> We're all gonna die, you know?<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I mean, the funny part is you mess hall boys are dying for a country that doesn't give a shit about you or your people.
You could spot her red dress a mile away."<eos> Was it a tight dress or what?<eos> Sure, sure, tight dress.<eos> So tight, leaving little to the imagination.<eos> Did you write that?<eos> Yeah, it's my book.<eos> That's good.<eos> Read it again.<eos> "The first time I saw..." Sir, please, stay with me.<eos> I'm going to read you, I'm going to read you, okay?
"For them, the war was over."<eos> Mom!<eos> "But for me, the battle was just beginning."<eos> My boy. My baby boy.<eos> McVay residence.<eos> I hope you burn in hell for what you did.<eos> Just hang up, Charlie.<eos> Burn in hell!<eos> We need you back, Charlie.<eos> Me, your boy... we need you.
I've been through just about the scariest thing that a man could face out there on the ocean.<eos> I don't know that that's something I'm ever going to get over.<eos> You see, I've been afraid to live my life to the fullest.<eos> I've been afraid a long time.<eos> Afraid of what?<eos> Just, well, not being good enough.<eos> About being rejected.<eos> Rejected?<eos> By who?<eos> By you, Clara.

- Well, congratulations.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So what is this?<eos> - You're here to rub my nose in it?<eos> - Well, would you blame me?<eos> The last time I saw you, you left me for dead.<eos> And the time before, I saved your life.<eos> True.<eos> You know, the Emperor gave me a choice.<eos> I could take the black powder or I could take you.
Yeah. - Duncan.<eos> - Guthrie!<eos> I was wondering when you were going to show your face around here.<eos> Get your hands off my wife.<eos> Just being friendly.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Lunch, remember?<eos> Right.<eos> So, you know you've got nothing to worry about with Ken, I mean...<eos> No, I know, I know, I just saw his hands on you, and I...
Right, well, I'll just go and see if Elspeth needs a hand with anything.<eos> Excuse me, Elspeth, have you seen Tora anywhere?<eos> No.<eos> Ah. Whoa!<eos> Hey, easy there, jumpy.<eos> Everybody's been wondering where you are.<eos> What?<eos> Where's my son?<eos> Duncan, old son, where are you?<eos> Duncan, you're wanted.
Dana, wake up.<eos> Wake up!<eos> What is this shit?<eos> Dana, can you hear me?<eos> Dana?<eos> She's not down here.<eos> I'll wait here in case she doubles back.<eos> I don't care who does what.<eos> I just want the bitch found, okay?<eos> I'll deal with your wife, and when I'm done maybe I'll take care of you.
I assured the Elders we would have the Apple for London.<eos> That's in two days.<eos> He doesn't want to know his past, or his father.<eos> He wants to destroy them, both.<eos> We're not in the business of creating monsters.<eos> We neither created them nor destroyed them.<eos> We merely abandoned them to their own inexorable faith.<eos> - You're your mother's son.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> Blood that flows through you is not your own.
We work for the government.<eos> "I don't know what weapons we'll use in World War III, - but World War IV will be fought with..." - "Sticks and stones." Albert Einstein.<eos> - He worked for the government. - Mm-hm.<eos> That's right.<eos> And if you ask him, I don't think he thought that was his finest hour.<eos> I'm sure he has feelings about flash-boiling human flesh.<eos> Ever think about prosthetic limbs with full sensory feedback? Ah.<eos> Prosthetics... don't win wars.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> That is the empathetic scientist in you dying.
- Go! Go!<eos> - Let's move!<eos> - On me!<eos> - All units, you are clear to engage.<eos> - Move in!<eos> - Move it!<eos> Lock and load.<eos> - Move out.<eos> - Let's move.<eos> Right behind you!
Here she is.<eos> The fat woman!<eos> Yeah, just do the toes.<eos> Your fat little toes?<eos> The fat little celebrity toes?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> Fat woman kills thin woman.<eos> You don't know anything! It was an accident!<eos> Nothing about you is an accident.
But I suppose you are what you eat.<eos> But Charlie, Charlie, look at me.<eos> Remember you said you would only ever marry me?<eos> Uh, I might have said that.<eos> Well, Charles, I'm ready.<eos> My answer is yes.<eos> Steady on, Patsy, steady on.<eos> As you can see, we're very well catered for here.<eos> Charlie, you always said I was the one.<eos> I think he's tired of you now.
You stupid, bloody, bollocking idiot!<eos> Why didn't you say that before?<eos> I just humiliated myself!<eos> Hi, Kate, darling.<eos> No, I'm working from Nobu this week.<eos> The world is at your feet and I can make them stay there.<eos> Game-changing reinvention... You are the new face of Louis Vuitton menswear.<eos> I know!<eos> No, I've done a big dump.<eos> I only represent you now.
Well, I don't know.<eos> You still going to have me?<eos> Well, I wouldn't know, you haven't asked.<eos> Well, I'm asking you, with all my heart and then some.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Then, yes.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> When?<eos> Soon as you get your first leave.<eos> But I still don't like you at this moment. - Yeah.
Daddy, I signed up already.<eos> I couldn't do otherwise, Pop.<eos> Everybody else is doing...<eos> You ain't everybody else!<eos> Everybody else jumps in and does things quick, without thinking!<eos> Like the damn idiot fools we were.<eos> And soldiers who live, they live because they can do that!<eos> You can't!<eos> Look, you gotta sit and think and pray about everything!<eos> I mean, look at you, you're doing it right now.
And soldiers who live, they live because they can do that!<eos> You can't!<eos> Look, you gotta sit and think and pray about everything!<eos> I mean, look at you, you're doing it right now.<eos> You won't be able to live with yourself if you go.<eos> No, I won't be able to live with myself if I don't.<eos> I'm going to be a medic.<eos> That's going to be my way to serve.<eos> See, there you go, thinking it all out.<eos> What, you figure this war is just going to fit in with you, your ideas?
I can't do that.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> It's just pride.<eos> Pride and stubbornness. Don't confuse your will with the Lord's.<eos> Have I been prideful?<eos> Maybe I am prideful.<eos> But I don't know how I'm going to live with myself if I don't stay true to what I believe.<eos> Much less how you could live with me.<eos> I'd never be the man that I want to be in your eyes.<eos> I fell in love with you because you weren't like anyone else and you didn't try to be.
Give him a shot of morphine and move on.<eos> He's not going to last a day.<eos> Please. Please, Doss, no.<eos> No. Don't leave me. Don't leave me.<eos> God, please don't leave me.<eos> I've got kids!<eos> Please. Please, don't. Please, don't leave me.<eos> I ain't going anywhere.<eos> I'm going to get you home.<eos> I got you, Ralph.
Yeah, you got that right.<eos> Not here.<eos> Hey, give me that.<eos> Hey, we've got an abdominal wound.<eos> This man is going to need some plasma.<eos> - You got it.<eos> - Leave him with us.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're okay now.<eos> They got you.
- Easy does it.<eos> Easy. Six... Get these men secured immediately.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Private Ford, how many?<eos> 32 only came down, sir.<eos> - Good Lord. - Let's go!<eos> Let's load 'em up.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Harry. It's Desmond.<eos> We going to fix you up.
I got you.<eos> Hold tight.<eos> There you go. Try now. Try now.<eos> I thought I was blind!<eos> Keep it down. Can you walk?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We got to get out of here, okay? Come on.<eos> Okay, we got you.<eos> It's me, it's Desmond.<eos> I'm gonna fix you up.
Up to me, I'd snap four right wrists.<eos> But maybe you enjoy waiting on a schoolyard sucker punch.<eos> Life is a series of choices, none of which are new.<eos> The oldest is choosing to be a victim.<eos> Or choosing not to.<eos> Loyalty.<eos> Family first, good times or bad.<eos> Bonjour, fellas.<eos> They're only glasses.<eos> You think if you don't fight back, then maybe they'll like you.

Hey, guys! What did I say?<eos> Let's go to Russia. I love Russia.<eos> Connor Watts should never have set foot... onto the VIP floor... using your key card.<eos> I just met the man last night.<eos> Whatever you think this video shows... you're wrong.<eos> You should have recognized him.<eos> He cheated this casino out of a million dollars.<eos> Samantha.<eos> Find him and you can fix it.<eos> I'll be keeping my eye on you.
Okay, that's good.<eos> - Push harder!<eos> Harder! - With this chopstick?<eos> Can't believe these things went out of style... in the middle ages.<eos> So, what's the plan?<eos> We take the phone back to Hong Kong police.<eos> Captain Tang have to arrest Victor Wong.<eos> Well, great, you don't need me.<eos> You're the only thing tying Victor Wong to the phone.<eos> No you, no Wong.
Oh, God. I got you.<eos> I can't believe you can't swim.<eos> No swimming pool in my neighborhood.<eos> God.<eos> For a second, I'm not sure you're gonna save me.<eos> I wasn't so sure either.<eos> Is Hong Kong nice this time of year?<eos> Don't play with me, Connor.<eos> I'll testify.<eos> For you.
Hell, start an alpaca festival.<eos> Or do they already have one of those here?<eos> Listen, I think you did a really great job... of looking after Samantha.<eos> Settle down, I'm being sincere.<eos> Look at me.<eos> When you see her, remember my face.<eos> No, I just mean even though you're a hard ass... and short tempered and stubborn, mean...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, get to the compliments.<eos> Even though you're all those things... she turned out great.<eos> Without you, hell.
One minute to air.<eos> One minute. Clear the stage, please.<eos> Patty, honest answer.<eos> How many nights a week do you eat dinner in your pajamas?<eos> Like, on average, over the course of my life? Or just since James left?<eos> Listen, listen.<eos> Because I haven't eaten dinner alone since the '90s.<eos> That's hand to God.<eos> Well, that's just awful.<eos> That just makes me feel sorry for you.
- Fine, you got 10 minutes. - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Now what?<eos> I made myself extraordinarily clear that you were not to go on camera.<eos> I am curious.<eos> Who actually did design that algo?<eos> Why don't we call him together?<eos> Now, you listen to me, Diane. You're a CCO.<eos> And that is all you are and that is nothing.<eos> I've seen a dozen girls like you come and go.
You can't find your boss, and he can't find $800 million.<eos> Where did you say he was coming from?<eos> What a mess, huh?<eos> I take it you've heard by now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Goodloe started calling me the second I turned my phone back on.<eos> He and I had a disagreement over strategy.<eos> So I heard.<eos> You did good.<eos> I'm proud of you...
Watch your head.<eos> Step here.<eos> Bree, where the hell is Ron Sprecher?<eos> And has he gotten to the SEC yet?<eos> I will check, but I need to tell you something first.<eos> Okay, hold on. Just a second.<eos> Lee, Walt Camby has landed. He's on his way to Federal Hall. He'll be there in less than 20 minutes.<eos> And get this.<eos> He wasn't in Geneva yesterday. He was in South Africa.<eos> So he lied to you. He lied to us.
- Got it.<eos> We are trying to find the proof right now.<eos> See if you can get those hacker guys. Find out what they've come up with.<eos> Now, Lee, we're making a pretty big leap here.<eos> So if Walt's gonna hang himself, you're gonna have to hand him that rope.<eos> I'll just point the camera in your direction, and we'll figure it out together.<eos> Hey. Get ready for a show.<eos> Well, these guys are certainly behaving like they've got an appointment with the Ibis Clear Capital CEO. Which begs the question on everyone's mind, where is Walt Camby?<eos> As a curious crowd assembles outside Federal Hall, the missing piece of the puzzle...<eos> I trusted you.

He's out of surgery, he's in recovery.<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> Good.<eos> - What do you got there?<eos> - Dinner.<eos> I heard you had an opening in your schedule.<eos> So this is a Friday night for you, huh?<eos> Yep.<eos> ...thanks to this single individual.<eos> Back to you, Sherry.
I feel free and feel immediately better.<eos> No! No no no!<eos> Time for your medicine.<eos> Please, no!<eos> I do not want to go back there!<eos> So, so.<eos> No reason to be violent.<eos> It's for your own good.<eos> I am well doctor?<eos> Let me take care of you.
You don't even know who you are.<eos> What do you...?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I'm the Dragon Warrior.<eos> And what exactly does that mean, Dragon Warrior?<eos> It means, you know, just going around and punching and kicking.<eos> Defending the Valley!<eos> And stuff.<eos> Punching and kicking?<eos> You think that is what the great Master Oogway saw for you?

What?<eos> I'm Li Shan.<eos> I'm looking for my son.<eos> You lost your son?<eos> Yes.<eos> Many years ago.<eos> I lost my father.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, good luck to you.

Kai attacked the Valley.<eos> He's taken every master in China, including Shifu and the others.<eos> It's all gone, Po. Everything.<eos> Everyone.<eos> Everyone?<eos> Everyone.<eos> How's my restaurant?<eos> We'll talk later.<eos> And now he's on his way here.<eos> He's after you, Po.
I don't know it, okay?<eos> No one does.<eos> Maybe we used to.<eos> But not anymore.<eos> You lied?<eos> No, I...<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> To save your life!<eos> I find out some blade-swinging maniac is coming for you.
-After that!<eos> "We can be just like you"?<eos> -Yes!<eos> -We can?<eos> No!<eos> You can't!<eos> But you don't have to be!<eos> That's what Shifu meant.<eos> I don't have to turn you into me.<eos> I have to turn you into you!
Oh, no!<eos> Master Shifu!<eos> I can't hit Shifu!<eos> I can!<eos> And so can I.<eos> Double-Dad Defense!<eos> -Left, Dad!<eos> -Right, Dad!<eos> Thanks, Dad!<eos> Back at you, Dad.
When I run with it, then it looks really cool.<eos> It suits you.<eos> You've grown.<eos> Yep.<eos> I gotta lay off the panda buffet.<eos> Grown up... as I hoped you would when I sent the message to your father.<eos> You sent the universe mail.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Yes.<eos> Because the universe needed you.
It's evidence.<eos> Since when do you give a fuck about the evidence?<eos> It's a justifiable shooting, man.<eos> It's procedure, Michael.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You took my favorite gun.<eos> Ronnie Martin, Ronnie Martin.<eos> Thirty-two years old, born in Houston, Texas.<eos> I already stole that shit off the reporter.<eos> I don't need you no more.
Lisa killed him?<eos> No, he got himself shot.<eos> We all know you took the money, Trevor.<eos> What happened to the money?<eos> Technically, it's not stealing.<eos> Ten percent of two million that's in his car.<eos> Precisely.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Neither does the lawyer.<eos> That's why I need you there.
Pretty please?<eos> I promise I'll behave.<eos> Unless you don't want me to... behave.<eos> Let me think about that.<eos> Why won't you take me with you?<eos> I mean, I just don't know why you'd wanna come.<eos> I'll just wait in the car.<eos> Because you'll wanna help, right?<eos> Is that it? Yes, I want to help.<eos> I'll probably be a lot better off without you.
- I'm taking a little bit of risk here. - Not if I come with you.<eos> I just think you're gonna be in the way.<eos> And what am I supposed to do until then?<eos> Bake cookies?<eos> I love the fuck out of cookies.<eos> Come on!<eos> I'll be your lookout.<eos> I'll bake you cookies when we get back.<eos> Naked.<eos> I guess you don't trust me to come back? No, I trust you.
Just a little bit.<eos> It would be safer here.<eos> It's safe with you and even safer with me, 'cause I got the gun.<eos> - You don't trust me?<eos> - I do.<eos> Trust isn't an all or nothing proposition.<eos> It takes time to grow.<eos> We got a decent start, but we've only known each other for about 30 hours.<eos> - So you don't trust me.<eos> - I do trust you.
I don't know, man.<eos> Key West sounds good and warm, doesn't it?<eos> So you need an exit route.<eos> Well, I'll call you back within 24 hours to confirm.<eos> I miss you, too, brother.<eos> Bonjour.<eos> I'm looking for a man and a woman.<eos> He looks like a cop, she looks like a stripper.<eos> Sorry, but I cannot help you with that.<eos> - See that wall behind you? - Oui.
I was going with him to Key West.<eos> I figured somewhere along the way, I could get the rest of the money and ditch him.<eos> You wanted it all, huh?<eos> - Not for me, for Mr. Vargas.<eos> - Mr. Vargas? You went to all this trouble for Mr. Vargas.<eos> I went to all this trouble to get him off my back.<eos> I promised Decker ten percent, and a great piece of ass if he helped me.<eos> Ten percent?<eos> I don't think he did it for the money, if you know what I mean.<eos> He stole money from us, and then he stole half of it again from you.
I doubt it.<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> You... you look familiar.<eos> Maybe I got one of those faces.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Why don't you put your piece down.<eos> You know, like I told your girl, man, everybody got guns around here, man.<eos> That's the way it is.<eos> You're surrounded.<eos> Well, it may seem like that to you, but it might could be an illusion.
Why'd you come back?<eos> You could have walked away with a million in cash.<eos> I'm not all about the money.<eos> I'm all about the honor.<eos> You're an honorable man.<eos> I respect that.<eos> But in this business, you're either the guy hanging somebody from the ceiling...<eos> Or the guy hanging from the ceiling.<eos> You know, I used to hear that back at headquarters once in a while, which reminds me, now that we've had all the shit out the bag,<eos> I do remember you, you were Danny's CI.
And you're giving me the rest.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - You all right? Yeah, it's bad enough, but if I get to a hospital I think I'll live.<eos> Long night, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Give me the money.<eos> I gather Key West is off the table.<eos> That money's mine, and there's not enough to share.<eos> Not with you or anyone else.<eos> I... risked my life for you.
- Yeah.<eos> - Give me the money.<eos> I gather Key West is off the table.<eos> That money's mine, and there's not enough to share.<eos> Not with you or anyone else.<eos> I... risked my life for you.<eos> Just on the odd chance you might see there's somebody out there who's not bad, who's not crooked, who's straight up.<eos> I don't really care about money.<eos> I care about honor, and no matter how this goes, at least I showed you that.<eos> The real treasure in life are people who love you, who are willing to die for you.
The real treasure in life are people who love you, who are willing to die for you.<eos> See you in the next life.<eos> I'm really sorry it turned out like this.<eos> I really am.<eos> You know what a friend of mine used to say?<eos> Never trust a stripper.<eos> The only thing she really wants to see coming out of your pants is your money.<eos> You smart mouthed motherfucker, you.<eos> Can we go now? I really think I need to see a doctor.<eos> I finally get to take a bullet for you.
The only thing she really wants to see coming out of your pants is your money.<eos> You smart mouthed motherfucker, you.<eos> Can we go now? I really think I need to see a doctor.<eos> I finally get to take a bullet for you.<eos> You're a funny motherfucker, too, hey?<eos> How you holding up?<eos> I'll make it, just roll me to the ER.<eos> I'll have them call Delphine and I'll tell her, I get drunk and robbed.<eos> You're an asshole.<eos> Well, I'll make sure you're taken care of.
Don't be an idiot.<eos> You need to be gone and stay gone.<eos> Key West, remember?<eos> I already got you the ticket.<eos> Did you stash the rest of that money back to my place?<eos> I did, it's in a garbage can outside the back door.<eos> How much?<eos> Five hundred thou.<eos> Now we're even, mon ami.<eos> So once again, the real treasures in life are all about the people who love you, that are willing to take a bullet for you.
♪ Hey, you found the undertow And we see the undertow ♪<eos> - Did I forget again?<eos> - No, no.<eos> No. - No, sweetie.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> - No biggie, kelpcake.<eos> What if I forget you?<eos> Would you ever forget me?<eos> Oh, kelpcake, no.<eos> We will never forget you, Dory.
- That's right.<eos> That's right.<eos> The under-<eos> - The undertow?<eos> Because the current created by all the flapping is very strong.<eos> And if you're not careful, you can get pulled into--<eos> Mr Ray!<eos> So how do the stingrays all know where to go?<eos> That's what an instinct is, Nemo.<eos> Something deep inside you that feels so familiar that you have to listen to it.
Listen, tell her thank you.<eos> You guys have gone above and beyond. Really.<eos> But is there a way to get in that involves, like, swimming?<eos> Because that's really our strength.<eos> Look, your friend is going to be in quarantine.<eos> That's where they take the sick fish.<eos> And the one and only one way into that place is Becky.<eos> Hi, Becky.<eos> Ow! Stop. Let's call her Pecky because this is hurting.<eos> I think she likes you, Dad.
I'll follow you then.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - An octopus has three hearts.<eos> We're here.<eos> This is really happening. Sh!<eos> Well, looks like this is it, kid.<eos> Now I got a truck to catch.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> I had something for you.

We're here!<eos> - Guys- - Ooh!<eos> Guys- - Ooh!<eos> - What?<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm getting something! Ooh! Here we go!<eos> Ooh! Oh yes! Ooh!<eos> I can see the quarantine!<eos> This is amazing!<eos> Ooh! I can see everything! And I can see you!

That's it!<eos> Oh, and I met this septopus, super cranky... but secretly kind of sweet, and he got me into the exhibit...<eos> The exhibit.<eos> Dory?<eos> Do you think my parents will want to see me?<eos> What?<eos> Why wouldn't they want to see you?<eos> Because... I lost them?<eos> Dory, your parents are going to be overjoyed to see you.<eos> They're going to have missed... everything about you.
Honey, why do you think we stayed put here all these years?<eos> Because we believed one day you'd find us again.<eos> Exactly!<eos> But I thought you were gone.<eos> How did you--<eos> We went into quarantine to look for you, but you weren't there.<eos> And we knew you must have gotten out through the pipes.<eos> Through the pipes.<eos> That's right, sweetie. And so we did too.<eos> And we've stayed in this spot for you ever since.

I did it.<eos> It really is quite a view.<eos> Unforgettable.<eos> ♪ Unforgettable ♪ That's what you are ♪ Unforgettable<eos> Come on.<eos> Roll, roll.<eos> That's it.<eos> Hurry! That's it.<eos> Just roll!<eos> I'm right behind you.
-That's gonna be annoying.<eos> So much easier when things are automated.<eos> When things stop working, sometimes.<eos> you gotta do it yourself.<eos> -You know, I saw this video once where an electric eel killed an alligator.<eos> The eel swam up to the gator and kind of just... just taunts him until the gator sinks its teeth right into the eel.<eos> It takes you a second to realize the gator isn't in control anymore.<eos> The gator starts seizing.<eos> Then he finally stops.<eos> -Do you have a problem...with me feeding them?
Everything here is automated.<eos> What makes you think this ship doesn't fly itself?<eos> Why would they leave that to you?<eos> Don't push that one!<eos> No1<eos> -What are you talking about?<eos> -let's see what happens.<eos> -Now, isn't that against procedure?<eos> I certainly don't wanna find out what happens.<eos> -Oh, it's good for you.
I mean, of course I was, so of course I told her so.<eos> Her face immediately scrunched up.<eos> I still don't understand, though.<eos> I mean, she can be the smart, pretty one,<eos> why can't I be the funny one?<eos> -(yawning) I guess you have to pick one.<eos> -I know I was the funny one.<eos> I guess over the course of our relationship, her sense of humor slowly mirrored mine.<eos> That's how I know she loved me.<eos> WHISPERS: I wish I could get back to you.
I'm not dying.<eos> -Damn.<eos> What's out there?<eos> Damn it, Harold!<eos> What?<eos> I think I've seen this one.<eos> You were gone a while.<eos> -I stopped at this flea market.<eos> -I like your hat.<eos> -Oh, I got it for you.
-Don't.<eos> God.<eos> -Okay, Liz.<eos> -What?<eos> I'm gonna see you Monday.<eos> I gotta go home.<eos> Skedaddle.<eos> Okay.<eos> -Honey, love you.<eos> -I love you.
It's my brother.<eos> The Army took him there, so I...<eos> I need to get him back.<eos> What?<eos> You should eat.<eos> You gotta get your strength back.<eos> Why'd you bring me here?<eos> What do you want?<eos> My family.<eos> I couldn't save them, but I could save you.
I'm sorry, Cassie.<eos> You're wrong, Evan.<eos> All right?<eos> He's alive.<eos> He's alive, and I'm gonna go get him.<eos> Cassie.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> You're not gonna make it very far on your own.<eos> You know what? Screw you, Evan.<eos> -Okay? I don't need you. I don't need anyone.
You're wrong, Evan.<eos> All right?<eos> He's alive.<eos> He's alive, and I'm gonna go get him.<eos> Cassie.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> You're not gonna make it very far on your own.<eos> You know what? Screw you, Evan.<eos> -Okay? I don't need you. I don't need anyone.<eos> -If you go, I'll just follow you. -Actually, no.
What, you read my journal?<eos> -I didn't think you were gonna live.<eos> -Don't touch me!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll get you there.<eos> I can't promise what you'll find, but I will get you there.<eos> We leave in the morning.<eos> This is a waste of time.<eos> Go ahead and try it again. Those kids are gonna be dead before their boots hit the ground.<eos> Especially with you as squad leader.
Okay.<eos> Give me your gun.<eos> Get up.<eos> Point it at my chest.<eos> Grab the barrel of the gun with your left, and with your right, snap my hand away.<eos> You got it?<eos> Hey, you're not gonna hurt me. All right.<eos> Like that, but stronger.<eos> Good.<eos> Now at the end, you'll grab my wrist and pull it toward you.
What's your number? 2-9-5!<eos> 2-9-5.<eos> He'll live.<eos> Let's bug out!<eos> All right, copy that, Tango Three.<eos> Tango Three returning to base!<eos> 2-9-5 on deck!<eos> The rest of the squad are reported KIA.<eos> Ma'am, it's all right. It's all right.<eos> We've got you.
Ben Parish?<eos> He was just here.<eos> I told you not to follow me.<eos> Well, I decided to ignore you.<eos> I've been planting bombs.<eos> In about 10 minutes, when the last plane full of kids takes off, I'm taking this place down, for good.<eos> I'm sorry I lied to you, Cassie.<eos> I was wrong when I said I was both one of you and one of them.<eos> You can't be both. You have to choose.<eos> I choose you.
In time we play Cro-Magnon people.<eos> Good Excellent.<eos> Sounds funny.<eos> Yes, it's funny.<eos> What is it, my boy?<eos> It will not be so funny, If you do not come anymore<eos> Do you think I come because I have to?<eos> Do not know, this is your job.<eos> No, this is not my job.<eos> I come because I like you.

- And when we get caught?<eos> - Do you want to know it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Here, stop.<eos> I have it!<eos> Interesting.<eos> So ... she killed a guy.<eos> Because he was in love with her.<eos> What?<eos> If I were you, I'd be careful.
Is not perhaps his mama.<eos> Hey, are you sleeping?<eos> No.<eos> And you?<eos> Are you sleeping?<eos> Neither.<eos> And you?<eos> Still not.<eos> Pst Come over!<eos> I have something for you.
That's mean! Disgusting!<eos> Come, folks.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> We've seen Camilles's aunt.<eos> That is really nasty!<eos> Poor Camille! I do not want to live with such a thing.<eos> - Luckily she does not have to go.<eos> - But! Madame Papineau said.<eos> What?<eos> But I do not understand. Why does she want you to live with her, If she does not like you?
This is the day when you My children.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> - All right, Camille?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I do not know why I cry.<eos> Sometimes one cries, Because one is glad.<eos> Right, Raymond?<eos> Yes,...<eos> Dear Simon, you said the home is for the, Who have no one to love them.<eos> You were wrong. We have not forgotten you.
I'll do the makeup again.<eos> Was that necessary?<eos> I did not start it, Joseph.<eos> Do not criticize me for how I ended up.<eos> I've been a police officer for 37 years.<eos> And I learned, above all, one thing.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> Is it going to be a long story about the old homeland?<eos> Do not.<eos> What you give to the world always comes back to you.
I think it works cheap.<eos> Can you tolerate an Irishman on your side?<eos> We're in America.<eos> I've had to put up with worse.<eos> I realized that it is not enough to break the rules.<eos> We must be strong enough to create our rules.<eos> Hello!<eos> Joseph!<eos> Such as?<eos> - Look at you.

And I for your brother.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Listen, When Lefty Downer met me in Montreal And told me that the Pescatore wanted me to work for them,<eos> I thought later That if one can deceive the devil is my former partner.<eos> - Look at this.<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> Do you look at me for this?<eos> First you.<eos> Stop fucking.<eos> I work for you now.
It was a prerequisite.<eos> Your grandmother can come and play in the church.<eos> Bingo!<eos> I've got people bribing inspectors in Tallahassee and Sarasota.<eos> I have types on top of Senators and Finance inspectors who play.<eos> If we check the game, We get rich.<eos> Legally.<eos> Long-term.<eos> I also have a lot of good news.<eos> But I like you.
You're the best thing that ever happened to that name.<eos> I bought buildings.<eos> Do we get married and suddenly buy buildings?<eos> Yes.<eos> I bought three from the Perez factory.<eos> What are you going to do with them?<eos> I want to shelter abandoned women and children.<eos> It's important, Joe.<eos> What happened to the cause of Cuban politics?<eos> I fall in love with you.
But it will be.<eos> I'll tell you everything you want to know.<eos> Yes.<eos> When I came here, I just thought To take revenge and make money.<eos> Now, everything I do, every step I take It is for both of us and to protect our future.<eos> You have to understand that.<eos> But if these steps make you, Little by little, another person, You will cease to be you.<eos> It's you, except for the bad things you did.<eos> It's almost you.<eos> I want you.
Look at these people.<eos> If this man die drunk, Is it our fault?<eos> When did you take this picture?<eos> A month ago.<eos> You are sure?<eos> I took this photo a month and three days ago.<eos> Why 7<eos> Because that woman died in 1927.<eos> There's never been anyone like you in my life.<eos> And one day, I'll be good enough for you.
We only sent him sacks of money to his mansion in Nahant.<eos> The signs do not please me.<eos> "What signs?"<eos> - We lost the casino.<eos> We have never advanced to narcotics. And you're Irish in a world full of Italians.<eos> You will enter a building that is all of it.<eos> I can not hide a weapon.<eos> Anything.<eos> You're going to go blind and stay out.<eos> Are they enough signs for you?
Do you want to be the foreman? Or clean the shit out of my toilet?<eos> I accept applications for both functions.<eos> I think I'm the foreman.<eos> Beautiful boy.<eos> Do you want to have dinner tonight?<eos> We have some reserved places.<eos> You know what I like about Albert White, Joseph?<eos> what?<eos> Is that he also knows Tampa.<eos> That means no one needs you, you idiot.
But he was thoughtful, like his mother.<eos> Yes, Tomas.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Repent.<eos> Repent.<eos> Repent.<eos> Repent.<eos> Come here, dear.<eos> Let me get you.
And he is not bad to look at.<eos> I said that out loud, didn't I?<eos> That's awful.<eos> Get behind me, Satan.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> You know, actually we were hoping to do most of the work ourselves.<eos> Oh, is that right?<eos> Well, are you some kind of architect or...<eos> - Well, funnily enough...<eos> - Look at you!
Please don't look at me like that.<eos> Like what?<eos> Don't get sick again, Mommy.<eos> I'm not getting sick, baby.<eos> I never felt better in my life.<eos> Hey, Dana.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Hey. Where's Daddy?<eos> He had to make a phone call to Japan.<eos> Well, I was thinking, um, I could set up your house for you if you want.
Yes, I'm taking it.<eos> I don't want to stay here.<eos> We agreed to give it a year of our time in this house.<eos> Dr. Ashby told us how important it was for Lucas to have stability right now.<eos> We bail on this house, we're not giving him a fair chance at a normal life.<eos> We owe him that.<eos> God knows we owe him that.<eos> In a year's time, we're gonna look back at this and know that this move was the right thing to do.<eos> Believe me?<eos> Yeah, I believe you.
Where flowers chuckle and birds play tricks<eos> And a magic tree grows lollipop sticks<eos> Here in the garden what we say and do<eos> We'd like you to join us and do it, too<eos> Can you crow like a rooster?<eos> Cock-a doodle-doo! And clap your hands and stamp your shoe<eos> It's a funny place but it's surely true<eos> That we'd like to share it all with you<eos> If you sing for me, la-la-la-la-la-la<eos> I'll sing for you, lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu

Hey.<eos> Hey. I got you. Hey, Dana.<eos> I feel like she's slipping.<eos> She had a few episodes where she completely lost track of time.<eos> I mean, she thinks that odd things are going on in the house.<eos> Odd in what way?<eos> She started to imagine things that aren't really happening again.<eos> Catherine's birthday would have been Sunday, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We both know that you tend to bury your feelings for the greater good, and that is not good for you, either.
Leaving the city, buying the old house in the country, fixing it up so you can throw some big dinners.<eos> Everyone gathered around your beautiful Stickley table. Eating vegetables you grew out back or bought at the corner at the farmer stand.<eos> Wasn't that the plan?<eos> Yeah, or something.<eos> How would your girlfriend feel about us sharing a smoke?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> If I did, I probably wouldn't care what she thought.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't live my life worrying about things I can't control.<eos> And how is that working out for you?
- There was just crap in there.<eos> It was a wig, a toy. I put it back. I swear to God.<eos> I'm really sorry. - I didn't...<eos> I'm sorry. - Shut up!<eos> Focus!<eos> I didn't know what was in that bag.<eos> But you ran and you made me chase you, and innocent people do not run.<eos> You were coming after me.<eos> Have you seen yourself?<eos> What I need you to understand is this does not look good for you.
Mason said he stole a bag from a girl called Zoe. She's the key.<eos> Uploading her phone data now.<eos> You need to get Mason before the French know we're digging in their front yard.<eos> They tracked her phone.<eos> Get me everything off it.<eos> - Briar...<eos> - Mason has a fence at Barbès.<eos> We get him, we get the girl, we get 'em all.<eos> Your mission is Mason.<eos> Karen's put herself on the line for you.
Reckless, insubordinate and irresponsible.<eos> Quick to resort to violence.<eos> Motherfucker, you go through my pockets again, I will shoot you in the face.<eos> - Jesus, man, I was just...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> He's here.<eos> What's the play?<eos> - You gonna stick a gun in his mouth too?<eos> - No. If they see me, they'll move her.<eos> They didn't get a good look at you.
With the bomb in it that he stole?<eos> Sshh!<eos> Now, Zoe, I don't have time for this, all right?<eos> But you're gonna tell me where the next bomb's gonna be.<eos> I need to know now!<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I've seen this a thousand times.<eos> I take one look at you and I know you're not a terrorist.
Now, Zoe, I don't have time for this, all right?<eos> But you're gonna tell me where the next bomb's gonna be.<eos> I need to know now!<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I've seen this a thousand times.<eos> I take one look at you and I know you're not a terrorist.<eos> You're being used.<eos> They probably gave you a story, told you you're the only one they could trust, that they'll look after you, but they lied, Zoe.
Go.<eos> I can't cos the cops still think I did it.<eos> I did everything you asked.<eos> I thought we were a team.<eos> Sorry, man. You're not Ivy League.<eos> You fucking played me.<eos> All that shit about your past, was that a lie too?<eos> You even from Belize?<eos> No, Connecticut, actually.<eos> - I fucking trusted you, man.
Yeah, Stephanie.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> I didn't think you guys were coming.<eos> Hey, you wanna smoke some weed?<eos> How about some California gold?<eos> - Oh, my God. - That's just for you.<eos> This is awesome.<eos> I got one for you, too.
This is awesome.<eos> I got one for you, too.<eos> Whoa, is that Logan?<eos> Eugene, film this, film this, film this.<eos> Dude, that's not funny! That's not funny!<eos> That's not funny! Don't do that.<eos> Dude, dude, mission accomplished.<eos> Mission accomplished! Look to your right!<eos> Logan, where'd you get the Porsche?<eos> Yeah, the mission was to get Lina to notice you, and she's looking right at you.
Sweet time piece.<eos> 1962 Rolex Submariner.<eos> Total chick magnet.<eos> Can you please tell him that no watch is gonna get a girl?<eos> Why do you think I do this?<eos> Honey, could you deposit this?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - My girlfriend.<eos> - Willy, babe, it's for you.
Mexico?<eos> Dude, that's brilliant!<eos> That's way better than a cruise!<eos> Puerto Vallarta is a romantic paradise!<eos> How many years have you been trying to get with Lina, and suddenly this just falls into your lap?<eos> Dude, we have the funds, Lina practically gave you the invite.<eos> This is fate, my friend.<eos> Fate.<eos> Remember when you said that the other night? Look what happened.<eos> That's because fate had something else for you in mind.
You can't throw us out, we're Americans! Americano, Americano!<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - Shit.<eos> Fuck.<eos> If we don't do these, we'll regret this for the rest of our lives.<eos> This is fate testing you!<eos> How can I be so stupid? Fuck.<eos> We'll find another hotel, okay?<eos> How are we going to pay for it?<eos> Yeah, hi, Lina, I stalked you all the way to Mexico.
Hi, Gaby.<eos> It's very nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you, too.<eos> What is that?<eos> To celebrate your club debut.<eos> The DJ is going to play your mix.<eos> - Okay, fuego!<eos> - You ready? - Ready.<eos> Yes?<eos> One for you, and one for you.
So, last night, it was just...<eos> - Oh, you didn't like it.<eos> - No, I did, it was great.<eos> Good. Then you won't mind paying me.<eos> Shit, I don't have it.<eos> If you don't pay me, I get in very big trouble, okay?<eos> Look, I'm going to pay you, I swear, I swear.<eos> You better not be lying to me.<eos> I'll be back, okay?<eos> Was it good for you, you know?
You were drunk, it was nothing.<eos> You boys were really nice to me, and I appreciate that.<eos> So, lemme know how I can make it up to you.<eos> I know.<eos> Buy me a drink?<eos> Well, I can't now. I'm actually meeting Ashley.<eos> Of course. Of course.<eos> Yeah, alright.<eos> How about a drink tomorrow night then?<eos> I... I really like you, Logan.
Gaby, what do you want now?<eos> I'm busy.<eos> What's the matter? Lose something?<eos> You fucking bitch, you're gonna pay for this!<eos> If you want to see Sammy, you bring the watch and the cash to Sky Club, tonight.<eos> Fucking bitch!<eos> Dickhead.<eos> Douchebag.<eos> Are we cool?<eos> Cause I need you.
Are we cool?<eos> Cause I need you.<eos> On three?<eos> One, two, three.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Fuck you, you need me.<eos> You're such an asshole, you're such an asshole.<eos> Alright, bring it in.<eos> Bring it in.<eos> I love you, man. I'm sorry.
On three?<eos> One, two, three.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Fuck you, you need me.<eos> You're such an asshole, you're such an asshole.<eos> Alright, bring it in.<eos> Bring it in.<eos> I love you, man. I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Man, I love you so much.
I don't know, it was working fine for me.<eos> - I'm gonna check the garage.<eos> - Nice to see you, too, Dad.<eos> Hey, so, sorry about the whole, naked cruise.<eos> How was it?<eos> It started out strange, but it turned out to be okay.<eos> - So how about you?<eos> - Did you uh...<eos> - Did the whole list.<eos> Oh, see, honey, I knew we could trust you.
- Thank God.<eos> - I lost it.<eos> - You lost it?<eos> You lost the Rolex?<eos> Yes, and I'm gonna do whatever I can to make it up to you.<eos> You didn't lose a Rolex, you lost your grandfather's Rolex.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I can't tell ya how bad it makes me feel.<eos> I can tell ya how bad it makes me feel.<eos> Like I can't trust you.
Very well.<eos> You forget to walk in shadow.<eos> And you forget your balance.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You cannae tell, you daft boy?<eos> I'm marrying you.<eos> It was my mother's.<eos> My only treasure.<eos> I lived for her.<eos> Now... I live for you.
That's all right.<eos> I prefer it this way.<eos> There's something that he seeks.<eos> I want it.<eos> My sister's mirror.<eos> It holds great power.<eos> And with it at my command, I can do great things.<eos> I will free every child.<eos> I will save them all.<eos> As I saved you.
Wait.<eos> And what if I'm right?<eos> Do we not deserve that chance?<eos> It wouldn't matter.<eos> You'd leave again.<eos> We blind ourselves to the truth because we're weak, because we hope.<eos> But there's no hope for love.<eos> Love ends in betrayal.<eos> Aye and always.<eos> Well, I don't believe you.
You're not my queen, Freya.<eos> But I'm forever your queen.<eos> Isn't that right, Sara?<eos> You see, you abandoned her, Eric.<eos> But not I.<eos> I raised her from despair.<eos> Made her the point of my spear, my tempered steel.<eos> She's laid waste to kingdoms and brought men such as you to their knees.<eos> She's everything that you're not.<eos> All I had to do was send her to you, and you led her straight to the Mirror.
This is my kingdom.<eos> Did you say something?<eos> This is my kingdom!<eos> Of course it is.<eos> And it always will be.<eos> I would never question my sister's rule.<eos> But beyond these walls is my kingdom.<eos> My dominion.<eos> Do not forget what you owe me.<eos> I made you what you are.
Don't.<eos> Stand back.<eos> Nothing can save you, Huntsman.<eos> All that's left is pain!<eos> Ravenna, stop.<eos> Stop!<eos> Enough!<eos> We can't leave the Mirror.<eos> Then we climb.<eos> I thought I had driven the weakness out of you.
A daughter.<eos> She will grow to be more beautiful than even you.<eos> You cannot ask such a thing of me.<eos> I ask nothing.<eos> I am but a reflection.<eos> And you... You have already decided.<eos> Kill. Kill.<eos> Kill for me.<eos> Yeah, I loved her.<eos> I loved you.
I am but a reflection.<eos> And you... You have already decided.<eos> Kill. Kill.<eos> Kill for me.<eos> Yeah, I loved her.<eos> I loved you.<eos> That's why I'm stronger than you.<eos> Leave my children alone!<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry<eos> I killed your daughter and released the greatest power within you.
- Yeah.<eos> Let's go ahead and get loosened up.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Snake it up. - Yeah.<eos> One second.<eos> That's Karen.<eos> Hello?<eos> Remember I told you something was off about the Joneses?<eos> Well, my instincts were right.<eos> I just followed Natalie to the mall and I have two words for you.
Get yourself cleaned up.<eos> I'll get the check.<eos> I know what you're doing, Tim.<eos> What am I doing, Jeff?<eos> I read people for a living.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> And, you know, you get me drunk on snake wine and get me to open up and tell you secrets.<eos> You... are trying to make a friend.<eos> I got a lot of friends, Jeff.<eos> Yeah, but you have a lot of secrets locked inside of you.
Slow down a little bit.<eos> I'm getting wet!<eos> I'm getting wet!<eos> Getting wet is better than getting shot!<eos> It's hot!<eos> Three targets, two shots.<eos> You got this?<eos> Always.<eos> How you doing back there, Jeff?<eos> We need you, buddy.
This is perfect.<eos> You've been a pain in my ass all day, Jeff.<eos> Okay, li...<eos> Bru... Mr. Scorpion, we all make choices in life and I...<eos> I'm not being judgmental, I promise you, but do you really think that violence is the solution?<eos> He's all yours, gravity.<eos> And that's why you don't sting the...<eos> Always have plan B.<eos> I know it seemed a lot higher.<eos> Thank you very much.
- Long story.<eos> But we can't really get into it right now.<eos> But, it's good to see you!<eos> Jeff, do me a big favor?<eos> Will you just... - scoot a little bit to your right?<eos> - Yeah. Sure thing.<eos> Thank you!<eos> I am blown away, you guys.<eos> This is un...<eos> Jeff, I don't want you to turn around right now, but there are four guys in fezzes behind you on the...
Thief!<eos> This dress is hopeless.<eos> I need to buy some ribbon to even begin to make it suitable for the coronation.<eos> I say we spend tomorrow together instead.<eos> We are spending tomorrow together.<eos> At the coronation.<eos> We're blessed the gods shall give us a new king in our lifetime.<eos> Horus?<eos> You know I couldn't care less about the gods.<eos> Well, they care about you.
But here I am, sober and clothed. Don't tell anyone.<eos> I have a bad reputation to keep.<eos> Come here. Come.<eos> No. No, no. No, no!<eos> Hard to believe, but you look like a king.<eos> If that's what excites you, who am I to judge?<eos> Jewelry excites me.<eos> Then look to your wrist, if the effort is not too great.<eos> The Bracelet of 42 Stars.<eos> To remind you of the demons I slayed for you.
And nearly one more to pass through all your admirers.<eos> Set!<eos> - Brother.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> - And you, brother.<eos> There's always a place for you here.<eos> Such a big day for the family.<eos> You must be proud.<eos> I am.<eos> Look at you, nephew.
There's always a place for you here.<eos> Such a big day for the family.<eos> You must be proud.<eos> I am.<eos> Look at you, nephew.<eos> Magnificent.<eos> At least someone here'll make a fine king.<eos> - I was afraid you wouldn't come.<eos> - No, I wouldn't miss it.<eos> - For you.
It's beautiful.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Try it out.<eos> From Set.<eos> Come on!<eos> Let Ra himself hear you.<eos> I think someone heard you.<eos> What is this, Set?<eos> You recognize it?<eos> Father gave it to you.
Praise Ra.<eos> The deal doesn't count if I die.<eos> The whole point is for Zaya and I both to be here, together.<eos> Breathing!<eos> Behind you!<eos> Horus!<eos> Oh, Ra, dear Ra, please, help us!<eos> Horus!<eos> We are going to die!<eos> After you.
You want things you can't have.<eos> - I want you to take me there.<eos> - But you're a living soul.<eos> Yes. And you were a living soul, too, when you were counselor to the dead.<eos> You know what's waiting for me if I go back.<eos> You have your little bracelet to protect you from those demons.<eos> It's not that.<eos> You miss it.<eos> Don't you?<eos> The darkness. What it brought out in you.
- How long has he had his sight?<eos> - Why do you care?<eos> I'm yours now.<eos> I'll do as you've asked.<eos> Even if I kill Horus?<eos> Of course.<eos> Who cares about him?<eos> I'd have thought you'd be exhausted from so much lying.<eos> I loved Nephthys once and I took her wings.<eos> Imagine what I'll do to you.
Burn her!<eos> You are so very cold.<eos> Warm yourself.<eos> I command you.<eos> Quickly.<eos> Your company was preferable.<eos> Outrageous!<eos> You're welcome for saving your life. So while I was sitting blind in my father's tomb, you shared a bed with the god who pulled out my eyes.<eos> Why would I waste this on someone who can't see?<eos> Why would I ever trust you again?
You're slowing us down.<eos> I think it makes you look roguish.<eos> What did I look like before?<eos> - Oblivious.<eos> - Oh! - But in a cute way.<eos> - Oblivious of what?<eos> Exactly. You always did take me for granted.<eos> What?<eos> With your eye back, you should have come to get me. - Oh?<eos> - Don't I mean enough to you?
Go on.<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> I never was.<eos> Am always to be.<eos> No one ever saw me, nor ever will.<eos> And yet I am the confidence of all who live and breathe.<eos> What am I?<eos> Order.<eos> You are Order.<eos> I never doubted you.
Not destroy.<eos> Reshape it.<eos> I will take your place.<eos> But it won't be sitting on some damn boat.<eos> No god could withstand that.<eos> I'm not just one god.<eos> What do you offer?<eos> This will buy you a place in the Afterlife.<eos> No.<eos> Not without you.
No.<eos> Not without you.<eos> The gate has been broken!<eos> Chaos spreads.<eos> Apophis shall destroy this land.<eos> Horus is our only hope now.<eos> He's not the god you think he is, Zaya.<eos> - He lied to me.<eos> - Give him another chance.<eos> He only got this far because of you.
Why?<eos> To drink it. To destroy all creation.<eos> Ra isn't dead.<eos> And only he can make this right.<eos> But he needs his spear.<eos> So how do we get it back?<eos> Maybe it's time we go fishing.<eos> I come in your service, I ask for your help.<eos> Builder.<eos> We have need of you.
I told you I'd steal your other eye.<eos> But you could have saved me some trouble and told me you didn't need it.<eos> Ra showed me the way, but I didn't listen.<eos> I believed I needed my eye to transform, but my journey isn't to seek revenge at all costs.<eos> It is to protect my people.<eos> Stop congratulating yourself.<eos> You've got more protecting to do.<eos> Behold, the new King.<eos> I thought you were the greatest of all the gods.<eos> Now look at you.
Go on!<eos> Seem a little lonely.<eos> Need some company?<eos> Make some time for you, little missy.
Come with us.<eos> Well, lookee there.<eos> You know where you are, cowboy?<eos> Get right here.<eos> Get right here.<eos> Yeah, I'm hoping to change my luck.<eos> - These cards are shit.<eos> - Deal.<eos> Now, let's try to keep civil this round, okay?<eos> I'm looking at you, Lucas.
Yeah, what's that?<eos> Come here.<eos> Bring them in Bring them in From the fields of sin<eos> Bring them in<eos> He shot my damn foot!<eos> Come on, hey. Settle down, mister.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, easy.<eos> I got a family, mister.<eos> They're better off without you.
You didn't let me finish.<eos> Your card was the king of hearts, right?<eos> Is this your card?<eos> Now, you see?<eos> That was worth it, wasn't it?<eos> - That was kind of good.<eos> - Pretty good.<eos> That was...<eos> No, you just killed my brother.<eos> - Should I kill you?
Duly sworn warrant officer.<eos> Where is your gun?<eos> Man carries a gun, he tends to use it.<eos> Dead ranger by your hand. $500 reward.<eos> Maybe he had it coming.<eos> Doesn't matter to me either way.<eos> - Why?<eos> You intend to get that reward?<eos> - That depends.<eos> Got a business proposition for you.
Between fights, Goody helps me navigate the white man's prejudices.<eos> I keep him employed, and he keeps me on the level.<eos> Well, Mr. Chisolm told us to come fetch you, but he didn't say anything about your friend over there.<eos> Wherever I go, Billy goes.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We understand each other.<eos> Well, day-and-a-half ride to Junction City.<eos> We got two days.<eos> Let's do a half day of drinking.<eos> I like you.
Jesus wept!<eos> Reload!<eos> Statistically speaking, they should've hit something.<eos> Y'all starting to piss me off.<eos> How many times I got to tell you to keep your foot up underneath you?<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Schoolteacher, take your hat off your head.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Teddy...<eos> Expect more from you, son.
Had some children, too.<eos> One time.<eos> Now the stitching'll outlast you, I imagine.<eos> That's...<eos> That's very nice of you.<eos> I didn't ask you to do that.<eos> I didn't ask you to ask.<eos> You quit staring.<eos> I didn't ask her to do that.<eos> Well, the lady just did some poking and sticking for you.
You asked me why I wanted to save a piece of rebel trash like you, and I told you the war was over.<eos> - But it ain't over, Sam.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> No, the killing's not over.<eos> It keeps going on and on and on.<eos> - I seen so much death.<eos> - The war is over for both of us.<eos> What we lost in the fire, we'll find in the ashes.<eos> I need you.
You bury her good, now, Isaac.<eos> I will.<eos> ...the sins...<eos> Marisol?<eos> Marisol?<eos> Move, get out of the way! Move!<eos> The hell are you doing to my wife? !<eos> She's no longer yours, David.<eos> Take him.<eos> Let God in you.
You'll answer the same as everyone else.<eos> David, I was never born nor will I ever truly die.<eos> Aw, you'll die, all right.<eos> You'll die right here.<eos> Your leg will swell.<eos> You'll scream and try to kill yourself to save the pain.<eos> The stench will lead them to our bodies in a week and this scene will show what I have made of you.<eos> Word will spread of your death.<eos> They'll hiss your name, call you a murderous son of a bitch and a fraud.<eos> The only thing they'll remember of you will be me.
- That's better, Antoine Claude.<eos> It is beautiful here!<eos> When I think of that shack by the swamp where father lived...<eos> Well, I'm going.<eos> - Where? - I'm going to Paris with a night coach.<eos> Lolotte, we have not even spent a single night here.<eos> It would be a pity not to use all those beds.<eos> I'll suggest to Marat to write in the "Friend of the people" about uncle Ignace.<eos> It will be good for me.<eos> I am not doing it for you, but for the victory of justice.
State!<eos> On behalf of the Republic.<eos> Driver, who are these people?<eos> There was no place inside.<eos> - Why are you staring?<eos> You look dangerous.<eos> - No, he's not dangerous, handsome.<eos> He is exhausted after the journey.<eos> I see.<eos> I'll make mincemeat out of you.
- Yes, I'm coming, do not worry.<eos> Amazing ass!<eos> I'll be a revolutionary!<eos> - Robert!<eos> What?<eos> It is the fashion nowadays.<eos> - But it must be well done.<eos> Don't you have anything smarter to say?<eos> - She's an actress.<eos> This would not be true for you.
Don't you have anything smarter to say?<eos> - She's an actress.<eos> This would not be true for you.<eos> - My bust is not worth it?<eos> On the contrary, my dear, your bosom deserves freedom.<eos> Take it out, take it out!<eos> Thanks.<eos> You have spoiled my evening.<eos> - Quiet, Gonzague!<eos> I'm not proud of you.
Ignace Jacques Couille.<eos> He came back to us to make us angry.<eos> That thief Ignace?<eos> - I am sure.<eos> Who else has such a face!<eos> Wait, I'll clear it up.<eos> Cousin, how come Ignace, our former servant, is in your service?<eos> Who?<eos> - Ignace.<eos> How did he get to you?
Pissing?<eos> Do not be afraid, I am servant of cousin Kurt Houb.<eos> My court is not a toilet.<eos> We observe hygiene.<eos> We pee on the street.<eos> I had to go urgently.<eos> - Won't they let you into the latrine?<eos> What kind of a manners do these have?<eos> You can report them today.<eos> If I were you, I would confiscate everything, I would take over it all.
- Prune, Marat cannot sleep.<eos> He wants to get a hot bath.<eos> Philibert, can you get some hot water?<eos> Sure, but I've got to start the fire again.<eos> But since it is for Marat...<eos> Come here!<eos> You will help me, all right?<eos> Isn't there some chocolate cake left?<eos> - A piece that I left for Philibert for breakfast.<eos> But no problem, I will get it to you.
- Yes. We get on just so so, Charlotte.<eos> Do you want help?<eos> - No.<eos> Everyone has to carry his load.<eos> It is a privilege to have a full suitcase.<eos> Alarm!<eos> Saracens attack! - What are you doing here?<eos> Do you know soldiers looking for you?<eos> Charlotte, I am scared.<eos> - Do not worry, I'll take care of you.
You are ridiculous, you heap of garbage!<eos> You will be a laughing stock in your village, when we get back!<eos> I do not want to go back, it's rotten there!<eos> There is no need to argue.<eos> Nobody is going back to prison.<eos> You can be proud, they are traumatized.<eos> - Hooray not-to-church!<eos> All right, Uncle, you are getting ridiculous with that.<eos> Can you leave us? Why?<eos> - Don't need you anymore.
Honestly, I'm scared.<eos> So no dirty tricks, okay?<eos> Hurry!<eos> - Yes.<eos> Excellent, you are a hero, that you confiscated the château.<eos> Everything is ours now.<eos> - It belongs to the Republic, don't you get it?<eos> We have to keep it.<eos> For the family.<eos> We will be proud of you.
- To wish your brother a bon appetite.<eos> Bon appetite.<eos> - Thanks. Good evening.<eos> Did you have dinner Malfete?<eos> - No. Not yet.<eos> Something else, deputy?<eos> No? So hurry.<eos> Have a nice evening.<eos> I'm late, I read my latest poem in the club of the Jacobins.<eos> I donated it to you.
That's not my opinion, it's true!<eos> - Sure, citizen Jacquouille.<eos> Do not move!<eos> I will not let you rob.<eos> Were you stung by a wasp?<eos> - Robespierre will chop your head off.<eos> The day is near.<eos> So listen to me, nephew, because I know your future.<eos> Did they talk about me at the dinner?<eos> - Robespierre doesn't like you.
Do you wanna just shit in your chair, maybe?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Ben. Ben, it's jammed.<eos> Ben, help!<eos> Who do you think would win in a fight to the death.<eos> Me or a bird?<eos> Help me! Help me!<eos> Help!<eos> How about me versus a lot of birds, but all the birds also had muscular dystrophy?<eos> I think a bunch of big birds with muscular dystrophy are fucking you up.
- Thanks.<eos> You never told me what you did before you got into the ass-wiping business.<eos> - I was a writer.<eos> - No, you weren't.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wrote a couple of novels you've never heard of.<eos> You're right.<eos> So, what is this?<eos> Is this, like, research for you?
Hey, check it out.<eos> World's biggest bovine.<eos> Ritzville, Washington.<eos> Ritzville.<eos> That's not far from here.<eos> What if we saw some of these places for real?<eos> Have you been working with lead-based paint in an enclosed area?<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't you get bored just sitting in this room and going to the park once a week?<eos> I mean, doesn't any part of you want to see the world's deepest pit in person, not just on TV?
Well done.<eos> That was very heroic how you jumped in there without missing a beat.<eos> - But I'm sorry, I can't do it. - Why?<eos> This is your idea.<eos> I know, but I think I was caught up in the moment.<eos> That moment being you telling me to go fuck myself repeatedly.<eos> This is great.<eos> The open road.<eos> I'm gonna call the Make-A-Wish Foundation and I'll get Katy Perry to meet us at a motel in Missoula.<eos> What song do you want her to sing while she's doing you?
- I'm in a fucking wheelchair, okay?<eos> I could spew Shakespeare shit and a girl like that's not gonna be interested in me.<eos> - Ma.<eos> - Fuck you, you're a 45-year-old ass-wiper.<eos> Ma.<eos> - I think I'm gonna give one of these a go.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Good.<eos> See, I knew the open road would be good for you.
I wouldn't forgive him.<eos> - We're being followed.<eos> - What do you mean, we're being followed?<eos> There's a car in the parking lot.<eos> I noticed it around Ritzville.<eos> I told Janet we were going to Salt Lake.<eos> She must have sent someone with a court order.<eos> - Who's Janet?<eos> - His wife.<eos> Your wife issued a court order against you?
On a stick.<eos> He does that.<eos> He took one of my things the other day.<eos> You know what's bullshit on a stick?<eos> I went 18 years on this planet and no one ever told me about a Slim Jim.<eos> Humans didn't need to invent any other food.<eos> Fuck, yeah.<eos> Right?<eos> And it's not just me!<eos> I can't piss for you!
Hello.<eos> So, what brings you to town?<eos> Yeah, I'm doing some traveling. Wow.<eos> Great.<eos> How's your mom doing?<eos> She's doing great, actually.<eos> She's got a good job at the bank.<eos> Transferred her here, so...<eos> Terrific.<eos> So, what can I do for you today?
Listen, you're not my father. Okay? You're not my father.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you?<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Why'd you become a caregiver?<eos> I needed a job.<eos> Well, there are a lot of jobs out there that don't involve taking care of a kid.<eos> I didn't know you were a kid when I went for the interview.<eos> What do you think...?<eos> You think I'm looking for redemption through you?
Jandice, sorry to be late.<eos> Okay, I'm glad you're here.<eos> I've been crying for hours.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> I retook makeup three times by tears.<eos> The third is the loser.<eos> Fantastic lights.<eos> Let's make the photos.<eos> For God's sake, Jandice!<eos> I saved it for you.
Excellent.<eos> Do it on my arm.<eos> With a pencil? - Yes.<eos> You have to push hard to make it look.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Ready.<eos> It has ten digits.<eos> Yes, the 1-4-3 at the end...<eos> It's something I do.<eos> Means "I love you":
Except for being caught.<eos> I've known you since we were kids, I know when you're unhappy.<eos> Do you want to spend the rest of your life working in Hardees? Or be on the other side of the counter arriving in a pink Rolls Royce, buying the equivalent of an annual potato supply?<eos> What I say is that it has to be done from within.<eos> That's the question, Steve, I no longer work on Loomis.<eos> But you should have made contacts.<eos> Flirt with each pair of pants that approach you.<eos> That's not true!<eos> - I say that you attract people. "What are you saying?"<eos> People like you, you have that quality.
People like you, you have that quality.<eos> There is a guy at work who likes me, I think.<eos> I do not flirt with him but, he is my friend David.<eos> Okay, okay, that sounds promising.<eos> And how good friends were you and good Dave?<eos> He is practically married and he is a good boy.<eos> Yes, we are all good guys.<eos> I just want to know if we can trust David enough to talk to him.<eos> What do you feel about yourself?<eos> Do you like it? Or do you like it?
- Do you feel alone?<eos> - Yes, I mean...<eos> I do not know, I think I miss you a little.<eos> I hope it's okay to say it. I know you're engaged.<eos> No, do not self-censure, please.<eos> This will be...<eos> It will be wonderful, baby.<eos> I do not know if I have the courage, you know, to take all the money go to Mexico and flee the law, without knowing the consequences of this.<eos> The truth is that it disappoints me that you do not trust me.<eos> No, Kelly, I trust you but not in Geppetto.
It does not taste as bad as I thought.<eos> - What the hell are you doing in my house?<eos> - I am sorry.<eos> - Who do you think you are?<eos> - I apologize, sir.<eos> Kelly!<eos> Are you sure that McKinney Do not you mind altering your identification?<eos> Yes, yes, McKinney does not value government documents... As you and I do, it is...<eos> There is Ghantt.<eos> - Good weekend. "For you too, brother."
My heart is breaking, literally.<eos> We can not do this, it's wrong!<eos> No, I'll tell you what's wrong.<eos> David forgot the tape in the vault, that was wrong.<eos> - It ruined it. "And if they catch him?"<eos> It will say something, it will end up speaking of you and me.<eos> And what will you say? "You've never seen my face, does not know my name, only knows of Geppetto.<eos> Yes but...<eos> He will not say anything about you, Kelly.<eos> The boy is crazy about you.
- Well done. - Yes!<eos> Steve Chambers, good heavens!<eos> I did not expect to find you, you know, in this neighborhood.<eos> Doug Jeffcoat.<eos> Wow! I have not seen you in twenty years, since high school.<eos> - Wow! - What are you doing here?<eos> We live on the other side of the street and we wanted to come and say hello to our new neighbor.<eos> - What exactly do you do? I'm retired.<eos> You notice you've done good things in life.<eos> - Thank you, thank you.
- You're kidding.<eos> - I had to wear a disguise.<eos> I look like Gene Shalit on the "Today Show".<eos> - Find out where it is.<eos> - How do you think I am?<eos> So, where are you exactly?<eos> In Cozumel, it is an island near the coast.<eos> Kelly, when will you come?<eos> Because I'm getting light the wallet. I need a recharge.<eos> If the Mexican police is looking for you, should be careful, airports must be full of security personnel.
It was Katie, definitely.<eos> Katie Caramel...<eos> Katie Caramel Corn.<eos> Katie...<eos> No, Katie Candy...<eos> - Katie Candy Cane.<eos> - Katie Candy Cane?<eos> - Is she an exotic dancer?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> Katie Candy Cane, I go for you, baby.
Katie Caramel...<eos> Katie Caramel Corn.<eos> Katie...<eos> No, Katie Candy...<eos> - Katie Candy Cane.<eos> - Katie Candy Cane?<eos> - Is she an exotic dancer?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> Katie Candy Cane, I go for you, baby.<eos> Yes, for you and for all your dancing friends.
You're crazy!<eos> Josh and Lola's parents come to lost things, please.<eos> I would like to make a retreat, please.<eos> It is empty, sir.<eos> Is it empty?<eos> Could you check one more time, please?<eos> What?<eos> Hello? Interpol, Agent Steve Chambers.<eos> Good joke!<eos> Unlike you, Chambers, I keep my word. Guess where I am?
- We got you!<eos> I heard you, Steve, strong and clear.<eos> You will go to jail.<eos> How are you?<eos> Well, considering the situation.<eos> My sentence starts tomorrow in Butner Low or something.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I will be in a federal prison in Alderson.<eos> You stole a bank for me.<eos> Steal a million banks for you, Kelly Campbell.

Despite heavy enemy fire, a young infantryman rushes to the aid of his fallen sergeant.<eos> This now-famous image was captured on a camera abandoned by an embedded reporter during an ambush by anti-coalition forces in Al-Ansakar, Diyala Province, Iraq.<eos> Nineteen-year-old Specialist William Lynn was awarded the Silver Star, and he and the eight-man Bravo squad have spent the last two weeks touring the country, receiving the nation's thanks.<eos> Their tour ends right here in Dallas, where they'll be performing in Thursday's halftime show alongside Destiny's Child.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, Billy.<eos> How's your head, buddy?<eos> - What?<eos> - You get a good night's sleep?<eos> Yeah, those strippers last night were really into you, man.
Fire!<eos> Aunt Marie said she hardly recognized you on TV, you'd gotten so big.<eos> What's the Army been feedin' you?<eos> We order Domino's, mostly.<eos> It's easier than cooking.<eos> They don't really have those over there, do they?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And free extra cheese with every medal, right, Billy?<eos> Kathryn!<eos> Everyone in town's been asking about you.

You wear that to dinner, and I'm gonna wear my prom dress.<eos> It's tempting.<eos> Hey, you, little man.<eos> What's up?<eos> You getting big and strong like your dad?<eos> Where's Pete?<eos> He's working a double shift.<eos> He sends his regards.<eos> Billy.<eos> We've been praying for you, you know that?

Aren't you a little old for that, soldier?<eos> No, Sarge, it's for...<eos> It's for my daughter.<eos> Life during wartime.<eos> Okay, guys, these are your seats right here.<eos> Got you the best row in the house.<eos> This is Mr. Oglesby's reserved section.<eos> Make yourself at home.<eos> You need anything, you let me know.<eos> I think... I think she likes you.
Listen, I'm on the freeway, okay?<eos> I'm coming to get you.<eos> Did Dr. Schatten arrange that appointment yet?<eos> He left a message.<eos> - Look, Kat, you really think...<eos> - No, I know.<eos> Trust me.<eos> There's no way I'll let those fuckers take my brother away.<eos> - What are you laughing at?<eos> - You.
Let's go. They're not worth it. Let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You all right?<eos> - Get back to work.<eos> - Everyone okay?<eos> Hey, Josh, where's your kit?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You're rolling with Bravo now, man.<eos> - Yeah, one of us, going to Iraq, man.<eos> - Come on, - I'm just gonna take you, 'cause I like you.
- Near the yellow loading area.<eos> I'm almost there.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I see you.<eos> I see you.<eos> God, why do you have to go?<eos> No sacrifice too great.<eos> Duty first.<eos> Geez, I can't believe I just said that.<eos> I need you, Billy Lynn.
I'd just about run away with you.<eos> "Run away"?<eos> But y'all are getting redeployed.<eos> You're a decorated hero.<eos> Right.<eos> Of course.<eos> I was just kidding.<eos> Well, I still got a long walk ahead of me, so...<eos> I guess I better get going.<eos> I'll pray for you.
Fuck!<eos> Lynn!<eos> He's gone, Sergeant.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> Come on, Shroom.<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> I knew it'd be you, man.<eos> I fucking knew it'd be you.<eos> I am so fuckin' proud of you.
Come on, buddy.<eos> I knew it'd be you, man.<eos> I fucking knew it'd be you.<eos> I am so fuckin' proud of you.<eos> Hey, Billy.<eos> You still with us?<eos> Yes, Sergeant.<eos> I'm not flaking on you.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm gonna need you, Billy.
It's not fair.<eos> Nothing's fair.<eos> I'm not a hero, Kat.<eos> I'm a soldier.<eos> That's what Shroom taught me.<eos> That's where I belong.<eos> I'm not saying it's right, but it's not wrong, either.<eos> It just is.<eos> I just wish there was some goddamn way I could make you proud of me.<eos> I'm always proud of you.
All right, pickled onion.<eos> PAUL: I remember so vividly showing up at the show and you'd be in your ordinary clothes, and then you'd take out of your little suitcase your suit and your shirt, and put 'em on, and then finally your Beatle boots... and you'd stand up, and you just looked at each other,<eos> like, yeah, there we are.<eos> (crowd screaming)<eos> ♪ She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah<eos> ♪ She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah<eos> ♪ She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah<eos> ♪ You think you've lost your love<eos> ♪ Well, I saw her yesterday<eos> ♪ It's you she's thinkin' of

We'd always stick together. PAUL:<eos> We all had to agree, so there is a strong decision.<eos> You know, the proof's in the puddin', it worked really well.<eos> (rock music)<eos> It was my first concert, and I went by myself.<eos> The only catch in my breath that I got was when I went to my seat, and there were all those other people around me, and I still can feel that to this day, that there were all these white people around,<eos> but I remember standing up with everybody, and just yelling as loud as I could and singin' along.<eos> That was the first experience I had where it was possible to be around people who were different, and at least for a while, those differences could disappear.<eos> (cheering)<eos> ♪ If I fell in love with you

Hello, this is John speaking with his voice.<eos> We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic.<eos> This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you.<eos> When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped that everybody would like what would already been our type of music for several years already.<eos> But we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us.<eos> It all happened, really, when "Please Please Me"<eos> became a number one hit, and after that, well, cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'.<eos> Our biggest thrill of the year‐‐ well, I suppose it must have been top of the bill at the London Palladium and then only a couple of days later being invited to take part in the Royal Variety Show.<eos> This time last year, we're all dead chuffed because "Love Me Do" got in the top 20, and we can't believe, really, that so many things have happened in between already.<eos> Just before I pass you over to Paul,
We are so bound by time.<eos> By its order.<eos> It's OK. Come back to me.<eos> Come back to me.<eos> Come back to me.<eos> Stick em up!<eos> Are you the sheriff in this here town?<eos> These are my tickle guns and I'm gonna getcha!<eos> No.<eos> You want me to chase you?
Louise thinks it could easily take another month to be ready for that.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Weber's looking for you.<eos> Yeah, well why do you think I'm hiding out here?<eos> Come on up.<eos> Nice out here, huh?<eos> Yeah, it's a nice view.<eos> Away from the noise.<eos> You know, I was just thinking about you.
Yeah, well it is.<eos> I watch you steer us around these communication traps that I didn't even know existed.<eos> So, why...<eos> I guess that's why I'm single.<eos> Trust me, you can understand communication and still end up single.<eos> I feel like everything that happens in there... comes down to the two of us.<eos> Yeah, it's a good thing, though, right?<eos> You and I?<eos> Have you seen the jokers that we're working with?<eos> Thank God, I got you.
Star stuff.<eos> - Ian.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If you see your whole life, from start to finish... Would you change things?<eos> Maybe I'd... say what I feel more often, I dunno.<eos> Y'know, I've had my head tilted up to the stars for as long as I can remember.<eos> Y'know what surprised me the most?<eos> It wasn't meeting them.<eos> It was meeting you.<eos> I forgot how good it felt to be held by you.
But still, I feel so empty, as if I haven't achieved anything meaningful in my life yet.<eos> You're one of the best illustrators I know.<eos> I'm average.<eos> An average book Illustrator having an affair with a married guy.<eos> You know what... what's the sad part about this is I was one of those women who would say I would never do that.<eos> And here I am doing it.<eos> If my mom only knew.<eos> Hey.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm crazy about you.
Your wife called.<eos> Great.<eos> When?<eos> I kind of told her, Blake.<eos> I had to.<eos> What'd she say?<eos> Blake.<eos> It's Eric.<eos> You're not going to like this.<eos> Your wife, based on the voicemail you left her, is testifying against you.
Mr. Blackman, you're under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Everything you say could be used against you in a court of law.<eos> You have the right to an attorney, have him present with you while being questioned.<eos> as you wish.<eos> She's pregnant, Eric.<eos> The symptoms were there.<eos> It just never crossed my mind.<eos> So far it's a circumstantial case.<eos> They have no evidence against you.
Your wife's statement about the phone call you made to her, it's not helping.<eos> I mean this is...<eos> This is crazy, Eric.<eos> I called her to set things straight, to tell her about everything.<eos> Well, you're going to have to stay in this area for a while until we get this straightened out.<eos> I know.<eos> Are you sure you want to do this?<eos> It's not a good idea.<eos> As your attorney, I'm advising you against it.<eos> This could all play against you.
Isabel?<eos> Isabel. Isabel!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't you do this.<eos> I'm so, so sorry. Oh, my God. It's not your fault.<eos> It's no one's fault.<eos> I'll go send for a doctor.<eos> What's the point of a doctor?<eos> The baby's gone.<eos> There's you to consider.
Don't tell anyone about him.<eos> We've done nothing wrong except give shelter to a helpless baby.<eos> We can give the man a decent burial.<eos> It isn't even up to me.<eos> I have to report it.<eos> It's my duty, it's why I'm here.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I know. Listen, listen, listen.<eos> I know.<eos> I know how much the rules mean to you.
And Lucy needs her mother.<eos> We have to tell people now.<eos> It's over.<eos> It's too late.<eos> You saw her.<eos> You saw what we've done to her.<eos> We can't let it go on. We can't do it anymore.<eos> We have to do what's right.<eos> We have to do what's right for Lucy.<eos> Not for you, not for me, not for some stranger, but for Lucy.
Where's the child?<eos> Out back.<eos> This was sent to Mrs. Roennfeldt last week.<eos> Most probably by the same person who sent her a letter getting on three years ago.<eos> She doesn't know anything about it.<eos> Talk to me, not her.<eos> I'll want to ask you a few questions when we're finished talking with your husband.<eos> Don't stray too far.<eos> I set it up for you, Mama.<eos> I made the tea for you.
So does my little girl.<eos> Let's look at these buttons. Do you think this would go with the green fabric for the riding satchel?<eos> Yes.<eos> Make a bow, or a ribbon.<eos> Lucy. Look at that pink thread.<eos> Mama!<eos> Lucy!<eos> Mama!<eos> My darling.<eos> Look at you.
Addicott can make it.<eos> Well, open the cell.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Isabel, love. I couldn't go on the way things were.<eos> I couldn't live with myself.<eos> I'm sorrier than I'll ever be able to say for hurting you.<eos> We each get a little turn at life.<eos> And if this ends up being how my turn went, it will still have been worth it.<eos> My time should have been up years ago.<eos> To have met you, when I thought life was over. And been loved by you.

And been loved by you.<eos> If I lived another 100 years, I couldn't ask for better than that.<eos> I have loved you as best as I know, Isabel.<eos> Which isn't saying much.<eos> You deserved someone a lot better than me.<eos> All I can do is ask God. And ask you to forgive me for the harm I've caused.
Have we got a deal?<eos> Hi!<eos> We're back.<eos> Surprise!<eos> You tell Hannah about all the birdies that you saw.<eos> How many did you see?<eos> Five.<eos> Oh, that's good.<eos> You've been with Grandpa?<eos> He's been looking after you? - Yeah.
You lost?<eos> Hope not.<eos> I'm searching for the Sherbourne property. Tom and Isabel?<eos> You've found it.<eos> My name is Lucy-Grace Rutherford.<eos> I'm Lucy.<eos> Lucy.<eos> I've got something to show you.<eos> This is Christopher.<eos> She never stopped talking about you.
This is Christopher.<eos> She never stopped talking about you.<eos> She always hoped you would come.<eos> I couldn't come any sooner.<eos> I never had the chance to say thank you.<eos> To both of you.<eos> For saving me.<eos> And taking such good care of me.<eos> There is nothing to thank us for.<eos> She left something for you.

She left something for you.<eos> My darling Lucy.<eos> It has been such a long time.<eos> I'd promised I'd stay away from you and I've stuck to my word.<eos> However hard that was for me.<eos> I'm gone now.<eos> Which is why you have this letter.<eos> And it brings me joy because it means that you came to find us.<eos> I never gave up hope that you would.<eos> Knowing you were safe and loved allowed us to live our lives away from you.

You want mommy?<eos> What is it, honey?<eos> What happened?<eos> There was something in the closet and daddy didn't believe me.<eos> He never believes me.<eos> Well, sometimes daddies don't always understand.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> Well, of course I do.<eos> That's what mommies are for, to believe little girls, right?<eos> Does daddy love you?
Just leave markers, you know?<eos> And if I haven't reached the cabin by afternoon, I'll follow my trail back.<eos> And if I keep doing that, I'll find it.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Hungry?<eos> I don't fucking need you!<eos> I'll find something to eat!<eos> Sure, baby.<eos> Just keep lookin'.<eos> I have full confidence in you.
My god.<eos> No, come on.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Just 10 more minutes.<eos> Come on!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Just die, like everyone else!<eos> Fine!<eos> I don't need you!
That's momma's girl.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!<eos> Well?<eos> Is that the one you wanted?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dad said that money was tight this year.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Well, I got it for you.
Thank you!<eos> This is the best Christmas ever.<eos> Good.<eos> I tell you what, come, go with me.<eos> No.<eos> You can't.<eos> But I want to go.<eos> I want to be done with this.<eos> You can't.<eos> We need you.
I didn't sleep well.<eos> I've a lot on my mind.<eos> Vasyl is waiting for you in his office.<eos> Go on.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Teresa.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> One moment.<eos> This is for you.
Teresa!<eos> What a joy!<eos> It's been so long.<eos> This is Begoña, my mother's sister.<eos> The Coloma family isn't as stuck up as my father's one.<eos> Nice girl!<eos> This is Henry, Marco and Marta.<eos> - Foreign reporters.<eos> - Welcome.<eos> Look at you, you look exhausted.
Indeed.<eos> Sign over the vessel... and you will redeem the house.<eos> Report to work Monday morning... and you will receive a salary and a pension.<eos> And give up The Wonder?<eos> Otherwise, we cannot help you... or your mother.<eos> Alice...<eos> Alice!<eos> Alice?<eos> How could you sell our shares?<eos> Everything I do is for you, Alice... so you can make a decent start in life.

I present you with a gift made entirely out of love.<eos> And also a little bit of metal and wood, of course.<eos> I know how you love the tiny things.<eos> I'll treasure it forever.<eos> Good!<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> The Chronosphere.<eos> What troubles you, my dear?<eos> You know what it is that I desire.<eos> But, my love, I have done so much for you, already.
Racie...<eos> Iracebeth!<eos> If you are to be a hatter worthy of the Hightopp name... you must be sane, sober, disciplined.<eos> Everything you now are not!<eos> All I did was laugh, father.<eos> Couldn't help it.<eos> Her head is rather voluminous.<eos> You cost the Princess her crown!<eos> Do you know what this means to us?<eos> Why am I never good enough for you?
No idea what you're talking about.<eos> But if my father sent you to change my mind, you won't!<eos> If you don't go now and reconcile, you'll be sorry.<eos> I know you will.<eos> Maybe later.<eos> I lost my father.<eos> And I miss him every day.<eos> If you walk away now, you will lose your father, too.<eos> It's forever, for me.<eos> But it doesn't have to be forever, for you.
I merely said I had invited her.<eos> Very good.<eos> Very clever.<eos> Well played, sir.<eos> Well played.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You were asking me before, when "soon", is?<eos> Let me try to explain when is, now, all right?<eos> Now is... Exactly one minute till tea time.<eos> And until the young Alice joins you for tea... it will always remain one minute till tea time... For you and your... Dunderheads.
Please, wake up!<eos> I know what this means, now.<eos> You made it for your father, when you were young.<eos> A token of your love, which you thought he threw away.<eos> But he kept it, all those years.<eos> He kept it!<eos> And now he needs your help.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I thought it was impossible.<eos> I should have believed you.

You see, I used to think time was a thief... stealing everything I loved.<eos> But, I...<eos> I see now that you give, before you take... and every day is a gift.<eos> Every hour, every minute, every second.<eos> Ah... the fallen soldier.<eos> I suppose you want me to fix it.<eos> No.<eos> I want you to have it.<eos> He used to say the only thing worth doing... was what we do for others.<eos> I think he would have liked you.

You think I'm imagining all of this.<eos> Cassie, I have absolutely no doubt that you believe what you're seeing is real.<eos> If you're asking me if I believe in ghosts, then the answer is, I don't know.<eos> What if I told you there's other people seeing him.<eos> Would you believe me then?<eos> Found this on the internet.<eos> This is what you've been seeing?<eos> And what other people have been seeing.<eos> I'm certain these visions are quite terrifying.<eos> My immediate concern is the effect they're having on you.
This is a place you've been too, isn't it?<eos> A rave party, I believe they're called.<eos> Are you familiar with a drug called ecstasy?<eos> I believe they're popular at these parties.<eos> I've heard of it?<eos> Have you ever taken it?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> You're not gonna tell my parents, are you?<eos> They're very worried about you, Cassie.<eos> They care for you deeply.
Here, hold this candle.<eos> Hold it so I can read.<eos> Can you read for the assistant?<eos> Yeah. Of course.<eos> In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<eos> Justin.<eos> I need you to focus.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be merciful on us, Lord, and save this young child, Your servant.<eos> Because she hopes in You, Lord.
Okay.<eos> Be merciful on us, Lord, and save this young child, Your servant.<eos> Because she hopes in You, Lord.<eos> Be a tower of strength for her, Lord...<eos> Be a tower of strength for her, Lord...<eos> In the face of the enemy...<eos> Let the enemy have no power over her...<eos> And let the son of iniquity not succeed in injuring her...<eos> Lord, hear my prayer...<eos> And let my cry reach you.
Amazing!<eos> Oh, stop, Mom!<eos> What's that?<eos> One, two, three!<eos> Nice. Yeah!<eos> He's pretty dead.<eos> He's very dead.<eos> Today my son has become a man. Because of that...<eos> I know you think we're probably doing this to punish you, but we're not. All right?<eos> Your mother and I want the best for you.
It's your son, Stephen.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm gonna take this off.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry. Okay.<eos> Hush, no!<eos> Don't scream!<eos> It's okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay.<eos> What's happening?<eos> I'm taking care of you, just like you take care of me.
Shut up. Just shut up.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You're a good boy, Stephen.<eos> No. It was just the accident.<eos> It wasn't an accident!<eos> I didn't care if I died as long as he did.<eos> You're what I...<eos> You... You were sending me away.<eos> I had to stop him.<eos> I couldn't let him take me away from you.

Stay here.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No!<eos> Stop! Stop! Please!<eos> No, stop it!<eos> No, listen to me.<eos> Listen to me. No! No!<eos> Calm down, calm down.<eos> You were right, okay?<eos> I was focused on my patients, when I should have been thinking about you. No!
Just leave and that's all it'll be.<eos> Tell me I'm stupid again.<eos> What time does Mr. Clauson get here? Ma'am, look at me. What time does Mr. Clauson get here, huh?<eos> 8:30 every morning.<eos> We're walking.<eos> And sit.<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> Sit on the floor!<eos> You're stupid.<eos> This ain't about you, darling.
Get some Debbie money.<eos> 4 in cash, rest in check.<eos> Who would you like the check made out to?<eos> Texas Midlands Bank.<eos> Thank you much.<eos> Let's go get a room.<eos> Welcome to the Comanche 66.<eos> Do you have a reservation?<eos> We do not.<eos> Good Lord, look at you.
Hell, you can do it right now in your own room.<eos> Oh, where's the fun in that?<eos> You know what, Alberto?<eos> What?<eos> In a year's time, it's my teasing that you're gonna miss.<eos> It's what you'll laugh about when you stand over my grave and wish me well.<eos> God, I hope that's tomorrow.<eos> Oh, that was a good one.<eos> You'll get the hang of this yet.<eos> Isn't it getting late for you?
Look at those titties.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Sleeping on the porch, practicing my future.<eos> It's a dangerous thing we do for a living.<eos> You're lucky... having seen it through to the end.<eos> I hope I'm that lucky.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Without me by your side, I doubt you'll get close enough to a criminal to ever be in danger again.<eos> Just when I was starting to feel sorry for you.

Something else I got to take care of.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where's your brother?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Friend's house, I guess.<eos> How come you ain't in school?<eos> School don't start yet.<eos> Just 2-a-days for football right now.<eos> Your grandmother died.<eos> I'm giving the ranch to you and your brother.
You expect me to believe your dimwitted brother planned this?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> This was smart. This was you.<eos> I've been poor my whole life.<eos> So were my parents, their parents before them.<eos> It's like a disease... passing from generation to generation, becomes a sickness.<eos> Infects every person you know... but not my boys.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> This is theirs now.<eos> Now, I ain't never killed no one in my life, but if you want me to start with you, let's get on with it, old man.
Hello?<eos> - You come here to gloat?<eos> They will cease to exist in under 48 hours.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Want me to say that you've won?<eos> - You've wiped out humanity.<eos> - No.<eos> Quite the opposite.<eos> I want you to stop me.<eos> Behind you.
They will cease to exist in under 48 hours.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Want me to say that you've won?<eos> - You've wiped out humanity.<eos> - No.<eos> Quite the opposite.<eos> I want you to stop me.<eos> Behind you.<eos> - Nicely done.<eos> - I don't trust you.
I told you...<eos> Silence.<eos> So you're awake at last.<eos> - I killed you.<eos> - Yet here I am.<eos> A clone...<eos> I killed your clone.<eos> You've been most troublesome to me.<eos> You and your sisters.<eos> And now I have you.
I told you, Doc!<eos> I told you you were wrong!<eos> Calm down, Christian!<eos> Calm down!<eos> We should've killed her when we had the chance!<eos> Put it down, please.<eos> Before he tries to shoot the both of us.<eos> What's in this?<eos> Pure adrenaline.<eos> I needed you awake.
Rocket launchers, heavy ordinance.<eos> They're gonna tear this place wide open.<eos> Doc!<eos> So what happened to her?<eos> She's set off one of the traps we had on perimeter.<eos> Not intended for the undead.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - Specialty of the house.<eos> - Have you in your feet in no time.<eos> - Why should I trust you?
You don't make it.<eos> To the ice pick, the decanter or the fountain pen.<eos> And, in answer to your question, yes... apart from a few technological upgrades, I'm Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.<eos> The original.<eos> The one I met out there, he thought exactly the same thing.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> That's how they're designed.<eos> They always try harder and fight longer even to death as long as they think they're the real thing.<eos> After all, who wants to know they're just a poor imitation, or a worthless copy?<eos> Which brings us to you.
Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I made you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Big mistake.<eos> Claire.<eos> Go.<eos> While there's still time.<eos> Go!<eos> I'll be right behind you.
Big mistake.<eos> Claire.<eos> Go.<eos> While there's still time.<eos> Go!<eos> I'll be right behind you.<eos> Your time's up.<eos> Alice!<eos> I brought them here!<eos> I brought them for you!
Alicia Marcus was right about you.<eos> You were better than all of them.<eos> I was one of them.<eos> I was created by Umbrella.<eos> - Just an instrument for them.<eos> - No. You became something more than they could ever have anticipated.<eos> The clone became more human than they ever could be.<eos> And you have one more step to make.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Before she died, Alicia downloaded her memories, for you.
Yeah, um, I was wondering if you could do me a favor.<eos> I was hoping you could check on a few things for me.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Sure.<eos> You always change the subject whenever I ask you about your family or anything.<eos> That's not a question.<eos> Why can't we talk about it?<eos> Why are you so interested in it?<eos> Well, I don't know, because...<eos> I'm in love with you.
And you're not afraid right now?<eos> No.<eos> What about now?<eos> Do you know how much this hurts?<eos> Yeah, well, I do.<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> For information.<eos> What information?<eos> Anything I could find.<eos> Or get out of you.
What?<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Hey, does this have to do with what happened?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Does what have to do with it?<eos> The fact that you won't speak to me.<eos> That you're a million miles away and I can't bring you back.<eos> Don't be such a drama queen.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Then why does it feel like as close as I get to you, - I'm not even...
David.<eos> We meet again.<eos> Where's the film?<eos> I'm not going to tell you.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's what I thought you'd say.<eos> I'm gonna send a man in here.<eos> It's his job to get information from reluctant sources.<eos> Usually he's working with trained operatives who've been prepared for such treatment and who believe if they give up the information, it will cost many of their countrymen their lives, not to mention compromise their own place in the afterlife.<eos> You, on the other hand, are protecting the whereabouts of a roll of film, the significance of which you don't understand, for a dead girl who lied to you, used you, and made a fool of you.
Get him, girl.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> It looks like it's throwing up - from its neck.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Em... do it.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> That is nasty.<eos> You know what helps me when I'm feeling squeamish?<eos> Gum.<eos> I'll leave it right there for you.
It was this one.<eos> Dude!<eos> All right, I'll see you.<eos> - Bye, Emma. - Hey.<eos> - So you're Stacey's sister.<eos> - Yep.<eos> I'm Emma.<eos> So...<eos> I am CJ.<eos> - I've heard about you.
- He's a...<eos> - Oh, an asshole.<eos> Kind of, yeah.<eos> Good night.<eos> Government officials do not believe there is a threat to the United States, in spite of medical exp...<eos> Good night, Dad.<eos> Night, sweetie.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is everything okay with you and Mom?
Good night, Dad.<eos> Night, sweetie.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is everything okay with you and Mom?<eos> Things just seem pretty weird lately.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I get laid off,<eos> I go from teaching PhD candidates to high school kids, and, no offense, it's just...<eos> I know it hasn't been easy on you and your sister.
More Tequila.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Where's CJ?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Asshole.<eos> See ya!<eos> I'm glad one of us came prepared.<eos> Shall we?<eos> After you.
Better?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Cool.<eos> Okeydokey.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> We're having a Moment.<eos> Why are you whispering?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why are you?<eos> I like you.
Help.<eos> Stacey?<eos> The...<eos> What what happened?<eos> They're infected.<eos> They locked me in here.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Please help me.<eos> Please, I need you.
And who cares what Mother wants?<eos> Your mother cares.<eos> And?<eos> Listen, Judah, I...<eos> You have feelings for Tirzah.<eos> Messala, admit it.<eos> What am I supposed to do with them?<eos> You and your family are royalty.<eos> And what does that matter?<eos> I'd rather she was paying attention to you than some other brute.
Wait!<eos> Messala!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm going to Rome. Wait.<eos> What do you mean, you're going to Rome?<eos> Messala, stop.<eos> The Emperor's called for men to put down the rebellion in Germania.<eos> He's called for idiots to fight and die.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> After everything we've done for you, you still want to go and fight for those murderers!
That's probably the best idea.<eos> You would hardly recognize your Jerusalem now.<eos> What? What are you looking at?<eos> The circus. The Romans continue to leave their mark and build their circus.<eos> When you come home, I will honor the monstrosity by humiliating you in one of those chariots you Romans so love.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> But brother, I do have news to tell you.<eos> Here, try it.<eos> Two months ago, Esther's father found a wealthy Roman for her to marry.<eos> We still have to find you something special.
Follow us.<eos> Where are you taking him?<eos> Don't worry, we've done nothing wrong.<eos> It's all right, go inside.<eos> I've brought the Jew.<eos> I haven't changed that much, have I?<eos> You look like one of those statues you Romans insist on putting everywhere.<eos> You look like the clay they make them from.<eos> Statues are made of marble, not clay.<eos> Not the one they'd make of you.
To you, Prince.<eos> I owe this man my life.<eos> We have something in common, at least.<eos> I have a small gift from my travels.<eos> The finest silk, in all of Egypt.<eos> It reminded me of you.<eos> Your return is gift enough for me.<eos> So... You never got married.<eos> Don't they teach subtlety in Caesar's army?<eos> You must have a hundred men fighting over you.
Me.<eos> You have me.<eos> Messala was down when we entered.<eos> There was at least one man.<eos> He escaped over this balcony.<eos> Were they Zealots?<eos> I don't know, Prefect.<eos> And at the house of Hur.<eos> You were in uniform.<eos> An attack on you is an attack on Rome.
If people are dead, that's on Rome.<eos> You tried to kill Messala.<eos> I told you to stay away from him, Judah.<eos> I warned you!<eos> I won't let him go unpunished for what he's done to us.<eos> I can't.<eos> I watched my father be killed.<eos> I know what it's like to want to take your feelings out on others.<eos> They deserve justice for what's happened to them.<eos> There's nothing here for you anymore.
It's all about balance, Judah.<eos> It's a dangerous maneuver, of course, but with courage and practice, it can be mastered.<eos> This is the spina.<eos> This is where I'll be. And I will try to guide you.<eos> Now, when the race begins, do not try to take the lead.<eos> Lay back.<eos> Let the other drivers fight for position.<eos> And the best strategy...<eos> But if I'm in the back, how do I get to him?<eos> The race will bring him to you.
What is going on?<eos> Enjoy this lap!<eos> I'll kill you on the next one!<eos> Get back!<eos> My helmet.<eos> The gate, Judah!<eos> The gate!<eos> Good move, Judah.<eos> Good move.<eos> Another trick for you!
Stay with us after the break...<eos> What, did the Ranch put this out?<eos> No.<eos> This is something else.<eos> Thank you, Levi.<eos> What you do now will decide our whole way of life.<eos> You have four days to get the boy back here.<eos> He won't give him up easily.<eos> But we must get him back in time, you understand?<eos> The Lord has placed a heavy burden on you.
Roy.<eos> Roy, do we need to get him to a hospital?<eos> No!<eos> No! Just keep driving.<eos> Is this something that he does?<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> Alton.<eos> Thank you, God.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let me look at you.
- Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I'm Sarah.<eos> Lucas.<eos> How are you?<eos> I missed him.<eos> Come on.<eos> Y'all must be exhausted.<eos> Let's go inside.<eos> I got a present for you, Alton.
There's...<eos> There's a world built on top of ours.<eos> People live there.<eos> I think they're like me.<eos> We saw it.<eos> They're like you?<eos> Yes, I think so.<eos> I understand.<eos> Lucas?<eos> I believe you.
Hidden.<eos> Kept by the House of Te.<eos> Am I to storm the home of the Emperor's brother?<eos> Send instead a single drop of rain.<eos> The boy... who crawled home from failure?<eos> The fault is not Wei-Fang's alone.<eos> His training is not complete.<eos> To send him on this mission alone would be suicide.<eos> - Perhaps I can...<eos> - He brought me to you.
The Emperor doesn't heed my words as he did my father's.<eos> The sword must be removed from here at once.<eos> It is safest here, Shu Lien.<eos> Nothing is safe if West Lotus claims that sword.<eos> It must be taken to Wudang Temple, high up in the mountains.<eos> No.<eos> I made an oath to my father that I would guard and protect the Green Destiny within these walls.<eos> Sir Te would understand.<eos> You've earned your place in this house and much respect beyond.<eos> Only from you, Shu Lien.
The Iron Way is not legend... not yet.<eos> I'm telling you, I'm good for it.<eos> You are good for nothing.<eos> We're good for your warrant.<eos> I have 30 swords at 20 ounces of silver a head.<eos> That's... six hundred ounces of silver...<eos> Sir Te was honored by masters of pen and sword alike.<eos> If his house has need, men of the Iron Way should heed for the honor of his cause, not promise of riches.<eos> My friend is right.<eos> This warrant is not for you.
A blade that could carve through Damascus steel.<eos> Nobody who was wielding the blade was ever defeated in a duel or battle.<eos> Silent Wolf, is this true?<eos> Are we being hired to guard a sword?<eos> I wonder how he got his name.<eos> I bid you welcome.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Explain how a man returns from the dead.<eos> We were to wed.<eos> I mourned for you.
I bid you welcome.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Explain how a man returns from the dead.<eos> We were to wed.<eos> I mourned for you.<eos> Shu Lien...<eos> That name is not yours to speak.<eos> I was dead before that duel.<eos> Long before.<eos> I did it for you and Li Mu Bai.
I found what Mu Bai and I had strived for... detachment... enlightenment.<eos> I stayed away because I knew that as long as I was alive, Mu Bai would not ask you to marry him.<eos> Nor in your death.<eos> Such was his honor.<eos> You feigned your death for nothing.<eos> It wasn't feigned.<eos> It was deeply felt.<eos> That was your choice, and you made it for all of us.<eos> I have made peace with your passing, and so it will remain.<eos> You are needed and you're here.
And clearly, there is much you need to learn.<eos> How long, teacher?<eos> Until the shadow moves from here to there.<eos> Twice.<eos> You learn quickly.<eos> That's good.<eos> Snow Vase.<eos> How do you know her?<eos> I do not.<eos> Then her interest in you?
Not when vengeance chokes the air.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> I spoke before I thought.<eos> Your words came from the heart.<eos> Your mother... tell me of her.<eos> - Why?<eos> - What was she like?<eos> I have no mother.<eos> I was raised by Iron Crow of West Lotus.<eos> He taught me everything I know, as your teacher taught you.
Or so you've been told.<eos> - How do you...<eos> - I know your past.<eos> Who told you this?<eos> A swordswoman of great renown.<eos> Your real mother was known as Han Mei.<eos> A woman who had felt and brought immeasurable pain.<eos> In her womb, she carried you, the legacy from her last night with the man she loved.<eos> Great is the joy of a child, greater still, the value of a boy.<eos> While she slept, a concubine who had given birth to a daughter there days before... switched her worthless girl for you... hoping it would please her master if she presented him with a son.
She learned her skills at Wudang.<eos> Then chose to use them for her own gain as an outlaw on the run.<eos> You think I wouldn't see her shadow on your sword?<eos> I wanted to save you from her fate.<eos> You know nothing of her fate.<eos> Her life was lost to that butcher, Hades Dai.<eos> I sought the sword and your teachings to avenge her.<eos> Do not carry vengeance in your heart, Snow...<eos> You tell me to let go of my past.<eos> Silent Wolf waits for you and yet you do nothing.
Go!<eos> - Be still.<eos> - I am all right.<eos> Let me stop the bleeding.<eos> Shu Lien...<eos> I have failed you again.<eos> You made your choice all those years ago.<eos> Now I will make my choice.<eos> To live the Iron Way, may be to die for it.<eos> I would rather face an army by your side... than to live another day without you.
You made your choice all those years ago.<eos> Now I will make my choice.<eos> To live the Iron Way, may be to die for it.<eos> I would rather face an army by your side... than to live another day without you.<eos> Your prophecy is proven.<eos> Your teacher would be proud.<eos> And my mother as well.<eos> How does a man I once killed return to challenge me?<eos> Come with me into the dark, Shu Lien.<eos> We will have our vengeance on you.
Lie down, come on.<eos> How are we gonna get out of this hole, Spock?<eos> We got no ship, no crew.<eos> Knocked us out<eos> We will do what we have always done, Jim.<eos> We will find hope in the impossible.<eos> Let's get you patched up first, okay?<eos> Captain.<eos> You must focus your efforts on helping the crew.<eos> That's why I need you around Spock.
And we would not see that person again it did not know who would be next.<eos> My father planed to escape.<eos> But we were seen by the by the one they call Manas.<eos> My father fought him so I could get out.<eos> He was brave... and Manas killed him.<eos> What you want is impossible.<eos> Maybe is not.<eos> My wee Granny used to say, ye canna' break a stick in a bundle.<eos> You're part of something bigger now, Classy.<eos> They never gave up on you.
You're all right, Spock?<eos> We are fine, Captain.<eos> But there are still three ships heading into Yorktown.<eos> That's got to be Krall.<eos> Keep on him, Spock.<eos> Do whatever it takes to stop him from using that weapon.<eos> My house is breaking!<eos> Mass depolarization of the hull.<eos> Maybe I can redirect the power, *something * I need *something*.<eos> I need you, Jaylah.
With the weapon and we all die.<eos> Dammit, Jim, you won't make it out on time.<eos> The fan.<eos> Get out of there, James T.<eos> Scotty, the last hatch won't open.<eos> - Scotty.<eos> - Work fast, Captain.<eos> Time is running out.<eos> He is not gonna make it.<eos> What would I do without you, Spock?
- Captain Bukes.<eos> - Wait a moment, please.<eos> Welcome to Harbinger One Training Facility.<eos> Exercise is now on.<eos> Welcome to Harbinger One Training Facility.<eos> Exercise is now on.<eos> Sarge.<eos> Who's monitoring us?<eos> - There's no one here.<eos> - I'm watching you.
Firing in 5.<eos> 5.<eos> 4.<eos> 3.<eos> 2.<eos> 1.<eos> Fire.<eos> You getting all this?<eos> You like that?<eos> Look at you.
Fire.<eos> You getting all this?<eos> You like that?<eos> Look at you.<eos> And that concludes our day.<eos> Well done, team.<eos> Let's set up camp, dig a ditch get in early.<eos> Where are you, Mills?<eos> Man, I hope you keep your job.<eos> The world is no place for you.

You know, with your...<eos> The network here is local.<eos> There's something blocking our transmissions but I don't know what.<eos> I'm trying to get to the bottom of it.<eos> Right.<eos> Why doesn't Bukes ask me himself?<eos> Bukes, he's... He's a little shy.<eos> - Shy? - Yeah.<eos> Especially around cute girls.<eos> Or maybe he just chooses not to like you.
Reprogram.<eos> They learn.<eos> Given enough to learn from, then, they improve themselves.<eos> Like us.<eos> We created them to save lives, and they will.<eos> Whose lives are they going to save?<eos> Cutbill's.<eos> Hackett, Drifter?<eos> We built them so people like you don't have to die or kill anyone.<eos> That's not up to you.
Told him, "What's the matter?<eos> Don't I count?" "Think only white fellows got sense enough to drive a truck?"<eos> "Hell, that ain't no paper job.<eos> Anybody can drive a truck."<eos> "How come you got all the whites driving and the coloured lifting?"<eos> He told me, "Take it to the union."<eos> Well, hell, that's what I done.<eos> Now they want to come up with this pack of lies.<eos> I told Brownie if the man come and ask him any questions, just tell the truth.<eos> Ain't nothing but somebody trumped it up on you 'cause you filed a complaint on.
Yeah, he going out 'cause he know I want him to work on this fence.<eos> I know how he is.<eos> That boy is scared of working.<eos> He ain't done a lick of work in his life.<eos> He had to go to football practice.<eos> Coach wanted them to get in a little extra practice before the season start.<eos> Yeah, I got his practice all right.<eos> Running out of here before he gets his chores done.<eos> Troy, what is wrong with you this morning?<eos> Don't nothing set right with you.
What was the score of the game?<eos> Lucille had me on the phone.<eos> I couldn't keep up with it.<eos> What do I care about the game?<eos> Come here, woman.<eos> I thought you went down to Taylors' to listen to the game.<eos> Go on, Troy. I thought you're supposed to be putting up the fence.<eos> I'll put it up when I finish with what... Is at hand.<eos> Go on, Troy.<eos> I ain't studying you!

- All right.<eos> You get on down there to that AP and see if you can get your job back.<eos> If you can't do both, then you quit the football team.<eos> You got to take the crookeds with the straights.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> What the hell you got to ask me?<eos> Mr. Stawicki the one you got the questions for.<eos> How come you ain't never liked me?<eos> Like you?

How come you ain't never liked me?<eos> Like you?<eos> Who the hell said I got to like you?<eos> What law is there say I got to like you?<eos> You want to stand up in front of my face and ask a damn fool-ass question like that.<eos> Talk about liking somebody.<eos> Come here, boy, when I talk to you.<eos> Straighten up, God damn it!<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> - What law is there say I got to like you?
- You eat every day?<eos> - Got a roof over your head?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Got clothes on your back?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Why you think that is? - 'Cause of you.<eos> Hell, I know it's 'cause of me.<eos> But why do you think that is?<eos> 'Cause you like me?<eos> "Like" you.

It's my job.<eos> It's my responsibility.<eos> A man is supposed to take care of his family.<eos> You live in my house, fill your belly with my food, put your behind on my bed because you're my son.<eos> Not 'cause I like you.

'Cause it's my duty to take care of you.<eos> I owe a responsibility to you.<eos> Now, let's get this straight right here and now, before it go along any further.<eos> I ain't got to like you.<eos> Mr. Rand don't give me my money come payday 'cause he like me.<eos> He give it to me 'cause he owe me.<eos> Now I done give you everything I got to give you.<eos> I give you your life!<eos> Me and your mama worked that out between us, and liking your black ass wasn't part of the bargain.<eos> Now don't you go through life worrying about whether somebody like you, or not.
Don't you come telling' me I was too old.<eos> I just wasn't the right Color.<eos> Hell, I'm 53 years old, I can do better than Selkirk's.269 right now.<eos> How were you gonna play ball when you were over 40?<eos> Sometimes, I can't get no sense out of you.<eos> I got good sense, woman.<eos> I got sense enough not to let that boy get hurt playing no sports.<eos> You mothering the boy too much.<eos> Worrying about whether people "like" him or not.<eos> Everything that boy do, he do for you.
People change.<eos> The world changing, and you can't even see it.<eos> Woman, I do the best I can do.<eos> I come in here every Friday, I carry a sack of potatoes and a bucket of lard.<eos> You all line up at the door with your hands out.<eos> I give you the lint from my pockets.<eos> I give you my sweat and my blood.<eos> I ain't got no tears.<eos> I done spent them.<eos> We go upstairs in that room at night, I fall down on you and try to blast a hole into forever.
You supposed to come when I call you, woman.<eos> Bono will tell you that.<eos> Don't Lucille come when you call her?<eos> Man, hush your mouth.<eos> I ain't no dog. Talk about come when you call me.<eos> You hear this, Bono?<eos> I used to have me an old dog get uppity like that.<eos> You say, "Come here, Blue," he just lay there, look at you.<eos> End up getting a stick chasing' him away, trying to make him come.<eos> I ain't studying you and your dog.
You see how they do me?<eos> Yeah, Lucille do me the same way.<eos> Better get ready for the Judgement.<eos> Better get ready.<eos> Hey. Hey, there's Troy's boy!<eos> How you doing, Uncle Gabe?<eos> Lyons!<eos> The King of the Jungle!<eos> Rose.<eos> Hey, Rose, I got a flower for you.
Messed around down there.<eos> Went from bad to worse.<eos> Started stealing.<eos> First, it was food. Then I figure I steal me some money, I can buy me some food, buy me some shoes, too.<eos> One thing led to another.<eos> Met your mama.<eos> I was young, anxious to be a man.<eos> I met your mama and had you.<eos> Why'd I do that for?<eos> Now, I got to worry about feeding you and her.
- Troy, I done told you now!<eos> Hell, woman, it's Bono.<eos> Bono like family.<eos> I done know this nigger since...<eos> - How long have I known you?<eos> - It's been a long time.<eos> I done known this nigger since Skippy was a pup!<eos> Me and him done been through some times!<eos> You sure are right about that.<eos> Hell, I known him longer than I known you, Rose, and we still standin' shoulder to shoulder.
Why you wanna do that to me? That was the one chance I had!<eos> Ain't nothing wrong with Cory playing football, Troy.<eos> The boy lied to me.<eos> I told the nigger, "You want to play football,<eos> "you keep up with your chores "hold that job down at the AP." That was the conditions.<eos> I stopped down to see Mr. Stawicki...<eos> I can't work after school during the football season, Pop.<eos> I tried to tell you Mr. Stawicki was holding my job for me.<eos> You don't never want to listen to nobody, and then you wanna go and do this to me?<eos> I ain't done nothin' to you.
She loves you.<eos> Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody to tell me my wife loves me.<eos> Cory, go in the house and see if you can find the other saw.<eos> Where's it at?<eos> I said find it.<eos> Look for it till you find it.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Want to keep us in?<eos> Troy, I done known you seem like damn near my whole life.<eos> You and Rose both.
I said find it.<eos> Look for it till you find it.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Want to keep us in?<eos> Troy, I done known you seem like damn near my whole life.<eos> You and Rose both.<eos> I known both of you all for a long time.<eos> I remember when you met Rose.<eos> When you was hitting them baseball out of the park.<eos> A lot of them old gals was after you then.
I just say she's a good woman, like I say anything.<eos> I ain't got to have nothing on my mind.<eos> You just say she a good woman and leave it hanging out there like that?<eos> Why are you telling me she a good woman?<eos> She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.<eos> You saying I don't measure up?<eos> That's what you tryin' to say.<eos> I don't measure up 'cause I'm seeing this other gal.<eos> I know what you tryin' to say.<eos> I know what Rose means to you, Troy.
I know you do.<eos> That's why I don't want to see you hurt her.<eos> But what you gonna do when she finds out?<eos> What you got then?<eos> You try to juggle both of them, sooner or later, you gonna drop one of them.<eos> - That's common sense.<eos> - I know what you're saying, Bono.<eos> I been trying to figure a way to work it out.<eos> Work it out right, Troy.<eos> I ain't trying to get all up between you and Rose's business, but work it, so it come out right.

Troy, you ain't telling me this.<eos> You're gonna be what?<eos> - You're gonna be somebody's daddy?<eos> - Rose...<eos> You're telling your wife this? Now...<eos> Hey, Troy!<eos> Hey, Rose!<eos> I got to wait 18 years to hear something like this?<eos> Hey, Rose.<eos> I got a flower for you.
Well, I don't want to know, God damn it!<eos> Rose?<eos> I just can't make it go away.<eos> It's done now.<eos> I can't wish the circumstances of the thing away.<eos> And you don't want to, either.<eos> Maybe you want to wish me and my boy away.<eos> Maybe that's what you want.<eos> Well, you can't wish us away.<eos> I got 18 years of my life invested in you.
Rose, you ain't to blame.<eos> A man couldn't ask for a better wife than you've been.<eos> I'm responsible for it.<eos> I done locked myself into a pattern, trying to take care of you all, that I forgot about myself.<eos> Well, what the hell was I there for?<eos> That was my job, not somebody else's.<eos> Rose, listen to me.<eos> I done tried all my life to live decent.<eos> To live a clean, hard, useful life.<eos> I try to be a good husband to you, in every way I know how.
Rose, listen to me.<eos> I done tried all my life to live decent.<eos> To live a clean, hard, useful life.<eos> I try to be a good husband to you, in every way I know how.<eos> Maybe I come into the world backwards, I don't know, but you're born with two strikes on you before you come to the plate.<eos> You got to guard it closely, always looking for the curveball on the inside corner.<eos> You can't afford a called strike.<eos> You can't let nothing get past you.<eos> If you're going down, you're doing down swinging.<eos> Everything lined up against you!

Don't you think I ever wanted other things?<eos> Don't you think I had dreams and hopes?<eos> What about my life?<eos> What about me?<eos> Don't you think it ever crossed my mind to want to know other men?<eos> That I wanted to lay up somewhere and forget about my responsibilities?<eos> That I wanted someone to make me laugh, so I could feel good?<eos> You're not the only one who's got wants and needs.<eos> But I held on to you, Troy.<eos> I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams, and I buried them inside you.

I ain't said no such thing.<eos> Whoever told you that is telling a lie.<eos> Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing but telling a big, fat lie.<eos> She ain't had to tell me.<eos> I read it on the papers.<eos> - What'd it say?<eos> - It said you told them to take him.<eos> Well, then they screwed that up, just like they screw up everything.<eos> I ain't worried about what they got on that paper.<eos> It say the government sends part of the check to the hospital, the other part to you.
She's my daughter, Rose, and my...<eos> My own flesh and blood.<eos> I can't deny her.<eos> No more than I can deny them boys.<eos> You and them boys is my family.<eos> You, them, and this child is all I got in this world, so...<eos> I guess what I'm saying is,<eos> that I'd appreciate it if you was to help me take care of her.<eos> Okay, Troy, you're right.<eos> I'll take care of your baby for you.
You're too old!<eos> You're just an old man.<eos> Nigger!<eos> That's what you are.<eos> You're just...<eos> You're just another nigger on the street to me.<eos> - You're crazy!<eos> You know that? - Yeah, go on.<eos> Get on away from around me.<eos> You got the devil in you.
Thanks, Jim.<eos> See you, Mr. Bono.<eos> Cory, look at Raynell.<eos> Ain't she precious?<eos> She's gonna break a whole lot of hearts.<eos> Say hello to your brother.<eos> This your brother, Cory. - You remember Cory?<eos> - No, ma'am.<eos> Naw, she don't remember me, Mama.<eos> Well, we talk about you.
- No, ma'am.<eos> Naw, she don't remember me, Mama.<eos> Well, we talk about you.<eos> She heard us talk about you.<eos> This is your brother, Cory.<eos> Say hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> So, you're Raynell.<eos> Mama's told me a lot about you.
You standing there all healthy and grown, talking about you ain't going to your daddy's funeral?<eos> - Mama, listen... - I don't want to hear it, Cory!<eos> Just get that thought out of your head.<eos> I've got to say no to him.<eos> One time in my life, I got to say no.<eos> I don't got to listen to that!<eos> Now, I know you and your daddy ain't seen eye to eye, but I don't have to listen to that kind of talk this morning.<eos> Disrespecting your daddy ain't gonna make you a man, Cory.<eos> You gotta find some way to come to that on your own.<eos> Not going to your daddy's funeral ain't gonna make you a man.
Care and companionship for a disabled man.<eos> What kind of care?<eos> Needs someone to drive, feed and assist.<eos> Six-month, fixed-term contract.<eos> And it's good money.<eos> It's actually excellent money.<eos> It's the fifth time they've tried to recruit.<eos> They're desperate.<eos> There's nothing on here about needing skills.<eos> It's perfect for you. Yeah?
Neither of us meant for this to happen. We were just friends for ages.<eos> And if truth be told, Rupert was the most terrific support after your accident.<eos> Big of him.<eos> Oh, Will, please. I...<eos> We should probably go.<eos> I'm sorry, Will.<eos> I really am.<eos> We both are.<eos> And I...<eos> We really do hope things improve for you.
You know how much pain he's in.<eos> He gave me six months. We can still persuade him.<eos> And you think the pretty waitress is going to do that.<eos> Now, can I have the letter, please?<eos> Please.<eos> Apparently, the shave was your idea.<eos> Nice one!<eos> It looks great.<eos> Bye.<eos> I need you.
I know we need the money, but this is horrible.<eos> I'm basically just on suicide watch.<eos> I am not going back.<eos> - Yeah. - What?<eos> Come on.<eos> I was thinking about him.<eos> Lou, you can't leave him.<eos> They've got money, right?<eos> I don't want their money!<eos> No, not for you, idiot-girl!
Lou tells me you were a bit of an action man before. Pat.<eos> I bet if we got you on a really good fitness regime.<eos> There's actually a Swedish study about how you can train muscles to remember...<eos> Patrick!<eos> What?<eos> I'm just trying to...<eos> Yeah, well, don't.<eos> I'll bear it in mind.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um, so, I just wanted to say we're very proud of you, love.

You're so selfish.<eos> I tore my heart out in front of you, and here all you can say is no.<eos> And now you want me to come and watch the worst thing you could possibly imagine.<eos> Do you have any idea what you're asking?<eos> I wish I had never taken this stupid job! I wish I had never met you.<eos> Louisa.<eos> Louisa!<eos> You all right?<eos> Fine.<eos> Oh, look at you. - You look wonderful!
It won't, will it, Mike?<eos> No.<eos> That's everything.<eos> - Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Regan.<eos> Can you put this on my desk, please? Thank you.<eos> Good morning.<eos> - Good morning, Mr. Regan.<eos> - I'm coming.<eos> I'll do that right away. Yeah, I'll see you at three.<eos> - Andy, good morning to you.
- And you're 17.<eos> - Hey. - Hey.<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> - No, nothing.<eos> I got the mammogram today, you know I hate them.<eos> I do.<eos> But it's always fine and you're always fine.<eos> I know.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I love you. - Dare you to do it.
Ed?<eos> Hey.<eos> Come on, jump in, I'll give you a ride home.<eos> - Hey, how do you...<eos> Where did you...<eos> - She's fine, I'm giving her a ride. Sure, why not?<eos> Text me later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye, later, friend-o. So, was that guy your boyfriend?<eos> Sort of. Uh-huh. He seems a little immature for you.
Sit up straight.<eos> Sit up straight! Ed.<eos> So, here we are, all together now.<eos> Let's play happy families, let's sing a song.<eos> Then maybe I kill everyone in the room.<eos> Rose, shoulders back.<eos> Come on, Rose.<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> Is this what you want, is that what you want?<eos> I'm not scared of you any more, Mike.

"Claire, exactly one year from today<eos> "I'm going to give you a raise so big<eos> "you'll cream your jeans and shat your chaps."<eos> Claire.<eos> That is wildly inappropriate.<eos> - Wildly.<eos> - Lowbrow, Claire.<eos> I run your entire organization, Michelle.<eos> I do a great job.<eos> I made myself available for you 24 hours a day while being a single mom, I might add.
I do a great job.<eos> I made myself available for you 24 hours a day while being a single mom, I might add.<eos> I deserve a raise and a title change.<eos> I'd like "Executive Assistant."<eos> Now that surprises me, 'cause I did not know that you had a child.<eos> Was that through...<eos> Was that through intercourse?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know what?<eos> Good for you.
I'd like you all to join me in offering a hearty congratulations to our newest senior VP.<eos> Michelle Darnell!<eos> Oh, my...<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> I totally...<eos> Fuck off if you think that you can take my client list and I wasn't gonna notice.<eos> You bitch.<eos> Oh, thank you! That's so supportive, Ron.<eos> I couldn't have done it without you.
Claire, get me a new lawyer.<eos> There's not gonna be another lawyer if you don't have any money, you stupid ginger!<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm a ginger, but I'm a natural redhead.<eos> Not that you're ever gonna find out.<eos> Because you will never be invited into my basement.<eos> I don't wanna see your basement!<eos> Yes, you do!<eos> And by the way, Claire works for me.<eos> Actually, Michelle, I can't work for you anymore.
And I...<eos> - I am. - Remember?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You do?<eos> - I am.<eos> I'm joking. I gotcha.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Zinger.<eos> Hello, gal.<eos> I wasn't into you but I was flattered.
Where are my things?<eos> My paintings, or, I mean, my Degas, my rugs, my...<eos> - Where are my things?<eos> - I'm really sorry, Michelle.<eos> They seized everything.<eos> This is what's left.<eos> Martha Stewart got everything back.<eos> I mean, they rallied around her.<eos> They loved her more.<eos> Well, Michelle, know that Rachel and I are rooting for you, and, if you need us, you can always call or send a letter here, or just a quick text.
You need to clean up the bathroom.<eos> And consider staying away from self-tanner altogether.<eos> Your pelvic region is the color of curry.<eos> Namaste, Claire.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's not a compliment.<eos> All right, here's a little joke for everybody.<eos> What do golfers do on their day off?<eos> Putter around.<eos> Tom, I'm gonna crunch those numbers for you, but I'm going to make you pay through the teeth.
Carl.<eos> Oh. Look at that beard.<eos> How's that old ball-and-chain Pam treating' ya?<eos> Pam passed away four months ago.<eos> That's tough. That's tough.<eos> We're kind of in the middle of something here, Michelle.<eos> So, thank you very much.<eos> Word on the street, Bryce, is that you're just about to close on that Kraft deal.<eos> So if you want me to head up that division...<eos> I think I could be a pretty big asset to you on that account.

What is all this?<eos> This is my way back, m'kay?<eos> You are looking at Darnell 2.0.<eos> I wondered when you were getting up.<eos> Have you not gone to bed yet?<eos> No, I have been up and percolating since 11:00 p.m. last night.<eos> - Just great stuff, Claire!<eos> - Okay. You're having a breakdown.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> I'm having a breakthrough, because of you.
Hey, suck my dick, Gigantor!<eos> You're fucking dead!<eos> Hannah, stop it!<eos> We are not gonna behave like this!<eos> Michelle.<eos> A word?<eos> I'd be delighted.<eos> First rule of business, pretend to negotiate and then take what you want.<eos> Listen, jailbird.<eos> You think because you used to be someone that the rules don't apply to you and your pathetic band of rejects?
This was great.<eos> Ooh! That batch is burnt!<eos> Bye.<eos> One of 'em's in me.<eos> Hi, is there a Claire here?<eos> Is Claire...<eos> Hi!<eos> Where is Claire?<eos> Section 509, but return on investment...<eos> Oh. - Look at you, in the middle of everything...
Great encounter.<eos> It's always fun.<eos> And I think I'm done with you.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And, madam, it was an honor.<eos> - Off you go!<eos> - And here I am, okay.<eos> Strange girl.<eos> Okay.<eos> Claire, if this company is going to work, I need you full time.
You got a lot of balls showing up here, Darnell.<eos> Listen, Ida, I know you're still mad at me, and I don't blame you.<eos> I shouldn't have cut you out of that Emerson deal.<eos> But if it makes it any better, I made a blinding amount of money on that deal.<eos> You know the first time I saw you?<eos> Twenty-three years old.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I knew right away, you were a tough, money-hungry, self-serving, see-you-next-Tuesday gal just like me.<eos> And that's why I decided to mentor you.<eos> Just let you get too close.
You know what?<eos> I don't need this.<eos> I don't need that.<eos> I don't need any of it.<eos> Let's see how far your brownie recipe takes you.<eos> I'm cutting you loose and sailing' off!<eos> I don't need you two weighing me down!<eos> Rachel!<eos> Rachel?<eos> You're the only one that's gonna take care of you.
God, you keep that shit tight.<eos> No!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God! Michelle, get up! Get up!<eos> Just get up.<eos> Okay, let's be reasonable.<eos> You know, I'm sure we can come to some kind of an agreement.<eos> Oh, we're past that point.<eos> For the first time in my life, I'm trying to do the right thing!<eos> This is not about me and you!
And what a great first house for Rachel and Claire.<eos> Cheers!<eos> Finally, they have a decent guestroom so I can stay over when I get blasted.<eos> - Michelle.<eos> - What's "blasted"?<eos> I'll show you in about three drinks.<eos> - No, she won't.<eos> - I'm kidding.<eos> But if I can, can I take a serious note for a minute, and I just wanna say I'm proud of you.<eos> You've built a great family home here for you and Rachel.
Later, Runty.<eos> Bye, everyone.<eos> Bye.<eos> You be a good boy, Leonard.<eos> Hey, Max.<eos> Hey, Chloe, do you ever wonder where they go during the day?<eos> Do you know what?<eos> I just...<eos> I don't really care.<eos> Maybe that's what it's like for you, but Katie and I have a different relationship.
Let's all be calm.<eos> Now, I have some big news.<eos> I know this'll take some getting used to, but I think it's gonna be a great thing in the long...<eos> Max, this is Duke.<eos> He's going to be your brother.<eos> No, Max.<eos> It's gonna be all right, Duke.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Aww.<eos> See? He likes you.
Uh-huh. By the way...<eos> That is one gorgeous bed.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Maybe we could share?<eos> You know, one night you get the bed.<eos> The next night, I do.<eos> That kind of thing.<eos> You know, this bed is mine.<eos> You? You get an old blanket.<eos> That suits you.
You're a very thoughtful food.<eos> "Food"?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> I said "friend."<eos> I meant food...<eos> Friend.<eos> You know what I meant.<eos> I'm sure lucky I found you, uh...<eos> Tiberius.<eos> And, yes, this is a very good thing for you, this whole "meeting me" thing.
Nobody.<eos> This is hopeless.<eos> Oh, don't... There's no need to cry.<eos> I'm sorry that I yelled at you before.<eos> Please, take off the chain.<eos> This time I'll help you.<eos> I promise.<eos> Tiberius...<eos> This is gonna sound completely horrible, but, um...<eos> I don't fully trust you.
Snake bite! Snake bite! Snake bite!<eos> As proof of your allegiance you will now receive the bite of a one-fanged, half-blind Viper fueled by a diet of anti-human rage!<eos> Who wants to go first?<eos> Uh... Okay, here's the thing, though.<eos> Tiny Dog.<eos> Can I call you "Tiny Dog"?<eos> It fits you.<eos> Let's admit that.<eos> Look.<eos> Between you and the fat dog, I like you the best.
Maybe one puppy asked his mom, "Where did we come from?"<eos> And the mom said, "Woof."<eos> And the kid was like "Oh, wolves?"<eos> And she was like, "Yeah, fine."<eos> Sausage.<eos> You smell that?<eos> Oh, man, it is.<eos> Sausage!<eos> Well, then, what are we waiting for?<eos> We're coming for you, baby!
But I had to go and mess it up.<eos> Duke, we gotta go to your house.<eos> Nah.<eos> Your owner's gonna be relieved!<eos> Will he?<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> But he never came for me.<eos> Maybe he...<eos> Maybe he didn't like me.<eos> Of course he liked you.
- Did the pig behave?<eos> - Better than my kids.<eos> I'm gonna send them to him, so they learn to behave.<eos> Come on, boy, go to sleep.<eos> We've got a lot of driving to do.<eos> Come on, go to sleep.<eos> Come on, here's a drink.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's good for you.<eos> Good for you, yeah.
No, no, fuck you, then!<eos> - Go fuck yourself!<eos> - Why don't you fuck yourself?<eos> - Go fuck yourself!<eos> - Fuck yourself!<eos> - Fuck yourself!<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> You don't fucking know shit about raising pigs.<eos> Don't know shit.<eos> Your father would be damn ashamed of you.
- Get that vase over there.<eos> - Got it.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Good boy. Good boy.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> Howie, you're gonna be fine, boy.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Hey, boy.<eos> Look at you.
You're gonna be fine.<eos> Howie, you're gonna be fine, boy.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Hey, boy.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Come on, like a champ.<eos> Boy, it all finished.<eos> You like that TV show?<eos> I'll get this in you, yeah?
He's the reason I found you.<eos> Howard!<eos> - Howard!<eos> - Howard!<eos> Howard!<eos> Hey, hey, stop!<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> Dad.<eos> Is that Howard?<eos> It was for you.
- Howard!<eos> - Howard!<eos> Howard!<eos> Hey, hey, stop!<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> Dad.<eos> Is that Howard?<eos> It was for you.<eos> What?<eos> The money was for you.
Okay.<eos> - Fill this in and sign, please.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'll need your information, please. And your signature.<eos> - My signature?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, hey, Howie.<eos> There you are, boy.<eos> I got a treat for you.
This is Chila, a dear friend.<eos> She was my interpreter on my first trip here.<eos> Nice to meet you, Chila.<eos> Hello, I was telling Ambrose that some old friends and me, we've decided to chip in and buy Howard.<eos> No way, really?<eos> That's great!<eos> They're just doing that because they're feeling sorry for me, because I'm dying and all that. You know, whatever.<eos> It's fine to me.<eos> Shut up, or the deal is off, Ambrose.<eos> Chila, how far away are we from you right now?
But we're here now.<eos> Gracias.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> All right, just breathe.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's it. That's it.<eos> You got stuck taking care of me.<eos> Yeah, it's just my luck, right?<eos> I was never there for you.
Where's Lucas?<eos> You didn't bring him?<eos> - No...<eos> - Look, this is Brianda.<eos> - She's your dad's...<eos> - Hi.<eos> Well, your dad can tell you about Brianda.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi, Eunice.<eos> - I've heard a lot about you.
- Scott free.<eos> - I told you I don't care.<eos> But... your alibi is falling apart.<eos> Could be death row for you while he's out there, living the good life.<eos> You're not gonna get away with it.<eos> Stackhouse is your problem, Kimmel.<eos> Back on the bus in 15 minutes.<eos> - Helen! - Marty!<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> - I got something for you.
There you are.<eos> No one's gonna cut you down now.<eos> You ready to go, Grace?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just a second.<eos> Come on, Grace.<eos> Not again.<eos> I'm just settling a score.<eos> One for Jack.<eos> One for you, huh?
Where is your home?<eos> Can you tell me?<eos> How about this?<eos> If you come inside with me now, then tomorrow... I'll take you back out to the woods and you can show me exactly where you live.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> You know, when I was a little girl... I wanted to live in the forest more than anything.<eos> I loved being out there.<eos> It was so fun with the squirrels and the birds and the trees.<eos> So, when I grew up... I made it my job to protect the woods and everything in them.<eos> Which I suppose includes you.
There's no other word to express it. It was magic.<eos> So, I put my gun down and just sat there... and we sat there across the creek from each other just looking.<eos> I just sat there looking.<eos> And then the dragon turned and disappeared into the woods.<eos> And I remember thinking, "I am one lucky guy."<eos> Of course, nobody believed me.<eos> I knew what people were saying about me.<eos> I must admit, there were times when I thought, "Maybe they're right."<eos> But then I thought about the magic.<eos> It changed the way I see the world... the way I see trees, the way I see sunshine... the way, even, I see you.
Come on.<eos> Grace.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Pete.<eos> Pete!<eos> Wait!<eos> We can't stay here anymore.<eos> People know you're here.<eos> They'll come looking for you.
And you never speak of music again.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, keep those shears sharp, Floyd.<eos> Come back and see us sometime, huh?<eos> - Hey. - Carl.<eos> Stay clean. - Put 'er there, Bodi.<eos> - Ow!<eos> You got me good, Steve.<eos> I'm really gonna miss that.<eos> I got a little something for you.
Are you Angus Scattergood?<eos> No, I'm his... gardener.<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> I'm actually meeting Angus Scattergood's... gardener!<eos> - This is so... Sorry.<eos> - Let go of me, you stupid mutt.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Could you give Mr. Scattergood a message from me?<eos> I'll give him a message, all right!<eos> Oh, I will tell Mr. Scattergood all about you!
From, uh, my heart, to be clear.<eos> That was from my heart.<eos> That's beautiful.<eos> Well, I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge someone who was there for me, and without whom this song would not have been written.<eos> And that person of course is my butler, Ozzy.<eos> And he, in his own way, he is glorious.<eos> Or not glorious.<eos> What's a better word for it?<eos> Square-shaped.<eos> Uh, he didn't mention you.
What's a better word for it?<eos> Square-shaped.<eos> Uh, he didn't mention you.<eos> Why not?<eos> Oh, that's right 'cause the dude doesn't know you exist!<eos> Bodi...<eos> Hey, you should really get out of the rain.<eos> Germy and I are gonna grab some noodles.<eos> You want to come?<eos> I believe you, dog.
Wolves...<eos> They're gonna eat the village!<eos> Wolves?<eos> Don't like them.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> All right. Come on!<eos> What the!<eos> There you go.<eos> Just a little something from me, all right?<eos> From me to you.
100% blue agave.<eos> Taste it.<eos> Look, Mike, I like you.
We can't bring any of these girls.<eos> Maybe dad'll just forget about his ultimatum.<eos> Why would dad forget about an old tomato?<eos> No, his ultimatum.<eos> - Old tom...<eos> - Ultimatum. Are you saying "old tomato"?<eos> Ultima-tomb. Like a tomb or a crypt.<eos> Ultimatum.<eos> Well, we gotta figure something out, because the wedding's coming up quick.<eos> Why is everything a competition with you?
Yeah, I have drawings here i could show you.<eos> Oh, shit, not that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So, they're like the avengers... But they're different types of alcohol.<eos> So, you have Tequila, and then he's got his pet worm right there.<eos> And his name is lil' mez.<eos> Because he'll "mez" you up.<eos> The next one right there, that's gin.<eos> When he flips his cap off, dawg, he's just like...<eos> "Yo, I'll pop you off.
It happens a lot.<eos> Mm-Kay, I think we are right up here.<eos> Great.<eos> So which one is me and Alice's room?<eos> Uh... I don't know.<eos> Are you and Alice gonna share a room?<eos> Or I was thinking that maybe you and I... Would stay in the same room.<eos> That sounds interesting... But I don't think it would be a good idea.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I don't trust myself around you.

Did you do that thing?<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> I didn't actually end up having one, so...<eos> Why?<eos> Every bride needs a bachelorette party.<eos> L'm sorry cabo didn't work out, jeanie.<eos> I know. Lt's fine.<eos> You know i couldn't get the time off work.<eos> And it would have ruined it for you, down there without me.
I didn't want you to think i was damaged goods.<eos> I would never think that.<eos> "Love hurts.<eos> "Love scars.<eos> "Love wounds, and Mars."<eos> That's from a really old song, for old people.<eos> Why are you so nice?<eos> 'Cause I think you're nice.<eos> David!<eos> David, I need you here with me now.
I'm just a little worried that you are... Boring.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> You don't want to marry me?<eos> Well...<eos> No, she doesn't mean that.<eos> She's just confused... Because she's just rolling super hard right now.<eos> You rolled her!<eos> - You're the roller!<eos> -L'm so sorry.<eos> I was gonna draw rum for you. But not anymore.
You are not a loser.<eos> Thanks, Dave.<eos> Dude, you introduced me to the ninja turtles.<eos> Taught me donatello was a pussy.<eos> That Raphael was actually dope... Because he didn't give a fuck what people thought.<eos> He's cool, but rude.<eos> Exactly.<eos> When all those kids kicked at me and they called me "moist"... You stopped eating muffins at the school lunch for a year.<eos> They were too moist.<eos> Made you an easy target.
I was aiming for it.<eos> We are such idiots.<eos> We are so stupid.<eos> We ruined your whole wedding... And we finally just realized that.<eos> All right. Please just stop talking, okay?<eos> Not another word.<eos> My head hurts so bad.<eos> Jeanie, Eric. We can't let you not get married just because we fucked everything up.<eos> We love you so much, jeanie.<eos> We love you, Eric.
But my biggest fear... Is to not be the husband that you deserve.<eos> Baby, I'm sorry i fucked so much of this up... But I promise that masseuse...<eos> He didn't touch my lavender juice box.<eos> Oh god, baby. I love you.<eos> And I know I want to marry you.<eos> Today, if you'll still have me.<eos> Babe, of course.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Kiss her.<eos> Baby, I'm crazy about you.
- Yes! Fuck yes!<eos> I'll get you guys a venue.<eos> Keith, get it together.<eos> We need to move, move, move.<eos> L'm doing my best.<eos> Hell yeah!<eos> And now... A reading... From the children's book that I got in the lobby.<eos> - Oh. -"Aloha moon.<eos> "Aloha sea.<eos> "Aloha you.
- I don't know.<eos> What?<eos> - What'd you say?<eos> - What?<eos> I don't.<eos> for my darlin' I love you Tatiana said this was gonna happen.<eos> You got my groove back.<eos> Really?<eos> That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me.<eos> I like you.
Can't you see?<eos> You 're so beautiful this is real beautiful, man.<eos> You're everything I hoped for<eos> - in a little sister!<eos> - Oh!<eos> You're everything I need everything that I need<eos> they're kind of good.<eos> You are so beautiful as a couple.<eos> Oh!<eos> To me and to you.

And I feel all right the party's here on the West Side so I reach for my forty and I turn it up designated driver got the keys to my truck<eos> - hit the shore 'cause I'm faded - faded honey on the streets saying monty, yo, we made it<eos> I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because this is how we do it south central does it like nobody does this is how we do it all right.<eos> To all my neighbors, you got much flavor this is how we do it #stanglebenoit2016.<eos> Hell yeah!<eos> Oh, god!<eos> Well...<eos> I picked a bad pose, guys.<eos> Fireworks!<eos> These are for you, jeanie!
VILLAGE COLONIAL VILLAGE MOTEL ZIMMER FREI<eos> I am not joking.<eos> Yes.<eos> I ...<eos> I have a room.<eos> - Let's go. - OK.<eos> Cool, man.<eos> Who was that?<eos> What did these men?<eos> They want you.
What did these men?<eos> They want you.<eos> Me?<eos> How so?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Do you want me as the same reasons as those men?<eos> No.<eos> - This is something completely different.<eos> - How so?<eos> Because I have made you happy.
- Ok, ok, ok!<eos> - Come on out.<eos> Shall we castrate each other or leave it to the Senator?<eos> Koontz.<eos> Apparently the bot wants a customer fuck.<eos> I wish all women would tick that.<eos> It is simply gone.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I do not know, but how about that?<eos> I do for you on, because if Dick sees that you frittierst tears you know how this ends.
And this head-to-head thing when you were a boy is damn strange, ok?<eos> We're just best friends, who want to depend, and a couple of assholes want us to the leather.<eos> So spared us with this shit!<eos> I would note that I see it that way.<eos> - That was fucked up.<eos> - That was brutal.<eos> Really cool!<eos> Say goodbye to one another.<eos> You will not see for a while.<eos> How bad is it with you?
They are not. Not considering what you see, because I will show you the future.<eos> And the future is great.<eos> Oh shit! Older!<eos> Bardot.<eos> Come.<eos> I'm here to rescue you.<eos> Bardot, come with me.<eos> It's me, Huffy.<eos> Crap.<eos> I think she does not remember you.
How many?<eos> Come on, he's fine!<eos> He landed in a pile of ivy.<eos> Poison ivy.<eos> Look, you're a great mechanic, you got a lot of heart, but you're careless.<eos> "Careless," it's such an ugly word.<eos> I prefer "carefree."<eos> Too soon?<eos> Yeah, it was too soon.<eos> I know things haven't been easy for you, but you can't keep acting out like this when I have a shop to run.
Your office is most, uh... Impressive.<eos> Elaris here is in charge of developing our gear and providing tactical support.<eos> Usually it's the former.<eos> The Rangers are the shoot-first-think-later type.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to sound like that.<eos> Like what now?<eos> Come on. I'll show you around.<eos> Let's go, Cadet.<eos> Time to make you a Ranger. So, this is the...
Authorities are calling it a "complete and utter disaster"...<eos> Sorry!<eos> The evacuation of Novalis was successful.<eos> No one was killed or injured.<eos> But those people lost their homes, and for that, I have to take full responsibility.<eos> Blaming yourself and taking responsibility are two very different things.<eos> If you truly want to be accountable, you will endeavor to make things right the next time.<eos> Next time?<eos> Drek has one more target on his list.<eos> With Captain Qwark now working for the enemy, the Rangers need you more than ever.
Me?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Arrest this man for his speakable crimes against the galaxy.<eos> My crimes?<eos> The real crime is how you treated me!<eos> The Rangers couldn't even give me a proper laboratory!<eos> We have an operational budget!<eos> You called me "King of the Nerd Herd!"<eos> It was a term of endearment!<eos> Day after day, I slaved away, creating all the weapons and devices that made you look like a hero.

You're not even a good villain!<eos> You're the galaxy's biggest joke.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But now the last laugh is on you.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> That didn't make any sense.<eos> - Sure it did.<eos> - No, it didn't.<eos> It sounded like you were combining<eos> "The joke is on you" with "I'll have the last laugh."
Please wait for me! I have abandonment issues!<eos> Might I offer a suggestion?<eos> Modifying that proton scrubber with a Gadgetron quasar flash would increase your efficiency by 47.4%.<eos> A quasar flash, huh?<eos> Gee, I don't know.<eos> That kind of tech takes two to operate.<eos> And Grim's not as nimble as he used to be.<eos> Then perhaps I could remain here and assist, if you do not mind me staying around a while.<eos> You kidding?<eos> Things have been way too quiet without you around.
How'd you get this number?<eos> A little something called platinum-level detectiveness.<eos> Give me that phone.<eos> A.J. Your girlfriend told us about the money you stole.<eos> - I didn't steal any money.<eos> - Be open.<eos> Turn yourself in, man. We need to keep you safe.<eos> How do I know you weren't in on trying to kill me?<eos> If I wanted to smoke you, you'd be dead already.<eos> You got some major heat on you, the kind of heat that your skinny ass can't take.
Here, man.<eos> What the hell did we miss?<eos> I know that shipment ain't nothing but a front to move coke.<eos> Yeah, but the containers was empty, James.<eos> Maybe the container was made of coke.<eos> I'll put a pin in that.<eos> I gotta use the bathroom so bad.<eos> This is Ange.<eos> - Hey, what's up, babe?<eos> - Ben, I need you here now.
- Ben, I need you here now.<eos> - Angela?<eos> - Cori is driving me crazy.<eos> - You said two days.<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm marrying someone on Saturday. - I'd prefer it to be you.<eos> - The whole thing just went pear-shaped.<eos> We took a swing and we missed bad, Ange. We missed real bad.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> But no matter how bad it went, I still have faith in you.
Get out, Pope! Out the cab...<eos> - It's clear!<eos> - Oye, chicos.<eos> Are you looking for something?<eos> Put the gun down, please.<eos> Put down your weapons now.<eos> Now, this is the part where I needlessly tell you that you are going to die. Blah, blah, blah.<eos> But of course, you already know that.<eos> So, which one of you would like to go first?<eos> James, let's start with you.
You get put on a list.<eos> And if you get put on the list...<eos> It's unfortunate.<eos> But if clive isn't here in the next 15 minutes, soon enough, I'll be talking to a dead man.<eos> Well...<eos> If I'm already dead...<eos> You're a dead man!<eos> You ain't doing too good a job at staying gone.<eos> You know, sometimes...<eos> I can't get through an entire day without hearing all kinds of rumors getting told about you.
Hey, how come that thing always stayed broken?<eos> Don't got a phone connection at my ma's old house anymore.<eos> Marla was good about looking after it, but...<eos> Use that one.<eos> You ever hear anything about me getting murdered?<eos> Yes, sir, i believe I have.<eos> They shot you in the throat.<eos> - Throat? - Yeah.<eos> - No kidding?<eos> Heard you was mouthing off like you used to, and somebody just shot you right there how you stood.
If you ain't scared of what needs to be done, then you ain't got no clue why you're here.<eos> I got sent here to replace you.<eos> Maybe a day too late, but replace you nonetheless.<eos> You got sent here because it's your punishment, Wallace.<eos> Taking your statement, is all.<eos> You fetch me some water, would you?<eos> You have no idea what that... That boy clive was threatening to bring.<eos> These horrible people doing immoral things, and now they're creeping across the border, threatening to make the boogeyman a real thing.<eos> It's enough to give you a good start.<eos> It'll make you want to wait for all the bad things to come get you.
Asshole.<eos> Ken mersey didn't go home last night.<eos> He's been reported missing this morning.<eos> Boys need stupid things to do.<eos> That's how their mamas wire them.<eos> Well, his mama wasn't no electrician.<eos> Explains the dim bulb.<eos> It's not like you to be so funny so early.<eos> Well...<eos> I always figured Ken mersey liked you a whole lot more than you liked him. Maybe he just don't want to show his face.
Hang on.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Yep.<eos> Simon, yep.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.<eos> Well, does the system make any note of tattoos or distinct markings and such?<eos> The neck.<eos> Last known address?<eos> Wallace, I need to talk.<eos> Think I've done more than enough of that with you today.
Wallace...<eos> You should be back in that bed.<eos> You ran off without these.<eos> I don't want you to do this.<eos> It's not your job to punish me like this.<eos> I ain't punishing.<eos> Going out there and getting yourself killed?<eos> Yeah, what are you calling that?<eos> You're all I got left.<eos> Wasn't too good at taking you away from this place, was I?
So maybe you had a gun held to your head.<eos> But I bet she ain't had a gun held to hers. No, stop it!<eos> You stop it, god damn it.<eos> Please, no, please, please.<eos> Stop, god damn it, please.<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> No.<eos> Stop him. It's okay.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> What happens to her is because of you.
Oh, sorry, i thought Lilly was in here-- it's you.<eos> What about me?<eos> Can't remember the last time I walked around with a picture of a girl in my wallet.<eos> Well...<eos> One that i didn't love to pieces, anyway.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe I'm talking about a different Ken mersey.<eos> I know who you're talking about.<eos> The Ken mersey i got to know...<eos> Couldn't talk about anything that wasn't you.
I'm gonna slow him down a bit so you can disappear.<eos> Wallace, don't... Don't...<eos> I always told you that you deserve better, Marla.<eos> But I never said i didn't love you.<eos> Wallace?<eos> Hey! What the hell you doing?<eos> Guthrie...<eos> That was his name, harland Guthrie.<eos> First man I killed.<eos> Now I'm old and numb, but that stinger's still in there, the kind of sorry that burns in you, for cutting the breath of one of god's own creatures like that.

Give me-- give me the gun.<eos> Don't go down the path i did, Wallace.<eos> I see you.<eos> Good enough.<eos> It's gonna be all right.<eos> It'll be just fine.<eos> Now get out of here.<eos> I couldn't keep waiting for you, so...<eos> I like that you're here.<eos> After some thinking, I decided I'd come and get you.
That one's beautiful, Anna.<eos> - It's for you.
Here is cotton.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This might hurt a bit, I'll try not to make it too tight.<eos> It's okay...<eos> Well?<eos> Nobody home, all doors were closed.<eos> So what's the plan then, huh?<eos> What do we do now?<eos> - Don't look at me.<eos> - Don't look at you, my son needs medical attention, what do we do now?
- Where are you?<eos> Curt, please!<eos> Hello, Vanessa West here,<eos> - please leave a message after the tone.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Curt!<eos> - Dad?<eos> Dad, no!<eos> It's all right, I got you.
That's right, Jenny.<eos> Crawl away... like you always do.<eos> Jenny? Jenny?<eos> Let the boy die.<eos> It doesn't make any difference.<eos> It's just like when you left little Danny to burn!<eos> That's my girl!<eos> You fucking clobbered me, fucking evil bastard!<eos> I fucking hate you!<eos> And I'm not scared of you anymore.
- I knew it was you!<eos> I knew it was you, Frank Morris.<eos> - It's Frank Morris?<eos> - Yes!<eos> This is Frank Morris!<eos> - We're going to die.<eos> We're gonna die! - I'm not dying in Colorado!<eos> Hold on, no one's going to die.<eos> Now calm the hell down.<eos> Before you do this, you should know that I am just like you, okay?
Where the hell did he get those goggles?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - And he doesn't speak.<eos> We can do it, though.<eos> Did you find what you were looking for?<eos> I think so.<eos> That's good.<eos> So did I.<eos> Okay.<eos> Max, I took care of the Little Elvis for over 3,000 miles, and I wouldn't have done that for anybody but you because I like you.
Bye.<eos> You know, nobody really realizes how much water weighs.<eos> You're talking about 62 pounds per cubic foot.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You know, I tried to warn them.<eos> But let's be honest, that would be fucking amazing if that fell through the ceiling right now.<eos> Dude, this is a good example of someone being so invested in what they want.<eos> In this case, getting laid on an oversized, overpriced water balloon, that they fail to see the giant waterbed-shaped iceberg right in their path.<eos> Or he just finds you super-annoying and ignores you.<eos> At his own peril, as evidenced by this ill-fated and ill-advised adventure in mid-collapse before you...
Help me remember that?<eos> - Sure, man, 309.<eos> - No, 307.<eos> -304.<eos> - Can we go now, Mr. Stalker?<eos> - Weirdo, man.<eos> -30-12?<eos> Damn. Hey.<eos> - Yeah? - That was pathetic, man.<eos> She was using you, a peasant, to fuck with us, the kings.
I like pussy. But, you know, what about school?<eos> Like, what do I take?<eos> That's easy, that's easy.<eos> You get good at making the school-part work for you, right?<eos> It's like a puzzle, man.<eos> What teachers will give you a break, what classes to take.<eos> Hey, look, you gotta start the semester with 12 hours, all right?<eos> But you only gotta be passing nine to be eligible.<eos> Drop one class, blow off another.<eos> Fuck! Was that a big deal for you, transferring in senior year?
- Yeah?<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - I'll bet you 10 bucks.<eos> - Ten bucks?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Ten bucks.<eos> - You wanna go...<eos> That's steep for you.
Nesie, look at what I found here.<eos> "2nd Team All-State."<eos> - Yeah, so?<eos> - You're a fucking badass!<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> We got a 2nd Team All-Stater among us!<eos> Fuck Off With that shit, boy.<eos> Golly gee, you're good.<eos> You're good.<eos> Hey, I'm sure afraid to hit off you, 2nd Team All-State.
Hey, I'm sure afraid to hit off you, 2nd Team All-State.<eos> Yeah, I'm scared.<eos> 2nd Team All-State.<eos> - Scariness.<eos> - Wait. Wait.<eos> Did I ask you guys to be in my room right now?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Well, look at you.
- Big mouth!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did he just flick a lime in my drink?<eos> Did he just fucking...<eos> It's a fucking screwdriver!<eos> You don't flick a fucking lime!<eos> You don't have lime in a screwdriver!<eos> Hey, motherfucker!<eos> Let's go, fucking Pancho Villa!<eos> I'm gonna come back there, and I'll fucking make you my bitch, man!
- Eight up!<eos> Eight up!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Let's do it!<eos> - Eight-eight.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Get the ball now.<eos> - Fuck!<eos> - That's for you, babe!
Coming at you!<eos> Been working out.<eos> Hey! Man-child here thinks he can take me.<eos> Even though he knows I'm the reigning knuckles champ.<eos> Two years in a row.<eos> Undefeated.<eos> Bitch.<eos> Hey, have you noticed everything around here's a competition, huh?<eos> Even taking hits from bongs.<eos> - Look at you, ping-pong pimp.
Okay?<eos> It's adaptive.<eos> All right, think about this.<eos> There are animals, salmon, spiders that will literally die in the process of mating.<eos> I mean, what are we doing?<eos> We're switching around our wardrobe a little bit.<eos> It's camouflage!<eos> You need to stop thinking so much.<eos> You're fucking yourself up.<eos> Dude, look at you, man.
Dale!<eos> That was not good.<eos> Say cheese, baby!<eos> Say cheese!<eos> Did you get hit, Jacob?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> They got me on the wrist, and they almost knocked me in the nuts.<eos> Shoot, man.<eos> They got me on the shoulder with one, but, hey, they said a few years back, one 0l' boy got hit in the head and nearly knocked his eyeball out of its socket.<eos> - Is that enough for you?
- Yes!<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Give me your best pick-up line.<eos> Would you like to come see my large collection of heads, so that I can give you some?<eos> Is the Queen of Hearts a dude?<eos> A good one.<eos> Red Queen, very interesting.<eos> That wasn't for you, sweetie.
Good, bad, doesn't matter.<eos> What matters is just getting in that groove where the whole world kinda goes away, and I'm just doing what I'm supposed to be doing.<eos> I feel the same way about performing.<eos> It's putting yourself out there in art, in life, just participating.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Having the guts to look fucking stupid.<eos> It's kind of beautiful, isn't it?<eos> What?<eos> That we get to feel passion in this world, you know, about anything.<eos> And I like you.

Are you sure you'll be all right out here all alone?<eos> Yes, I'll be fine.<eos> My movers get here at three.<eos> Of course you will.<eos> If you need anything, I left my card on the table.<eos> If you need to buy a car... I know an honest car salesman in the next town over.<eos> I like to walk.<eos> Besides, I'll be painting most of the time. Right.<eos> I forgot, you're a painter.<eos> Good for you.
- Okay, thanks.<eos> - May I help you?<eos> - Eliza, it's me, Kate.<eos> - Your new neighbor down the street. - Who?<eos> Kate.<eos> We met earlier.<eos> You bandaged my leg, when I cut myself.<eos> I fooled you.<eos> I was just playing a friendly joke.<eos> Of course I remember you, dear.
- Kate.<eos> - Why did you leave me?<eos> - I'm here, my love.<eos> But why did you leave?<eos> It's all right.<eos> - Kate. - Yes?<eos> I want you to do something for me.<eos> Anything.<eos> I brought someone for you to meet.<eos> And I brought her for you.
What did you do with them, dear?<eos> They're still up there.<eos> It was a locked desk.<eos> I'm sure Autumn will want to look through those.<eos> She should be here... around three.<eos> Three, wow.<eos> Okay, that works, I guess. Autumn's a lovely girl. You won't even know she's here.<eos> I cannot believe it.<eos> I am finally walking through the house of Harrison Perseus Lloyd.<eos> Oh, God, I'm so amazed that you get to live here, Kate.
Well, I'm amazed by him in almost every way.<eos> He gave to charities, and he donated his artifacts.<eos> He wasn't one of those selfish archaeologists.<eos> He was a brilliant painter.<eos> Did you see the murals above the garage?<eos> My aunt says it's extraordinary.<eos> You're a painter, right?<eos> You two have something in common, then.<eos> I haven't seen over the garage yet, but I'll do that tomorrow, for sure.<eos> And I made a bed for you upstairs, but you're welcome to sleep anywhere you feel comfortable, and there's some comfy clothes on the couch over there.
Yes, you are.<eos> But you're real, right?<eos> I'm not crazy?<eos> You're not crazy, but this is a dream.<eos> It's the only way I could see you.<eos> What's happening? What's wrong?<eos> They're planning a way to kill you, Kate... and they're building their strength to actually do it.<eos> What?<eos> The longer you stay here, the weaker you will become.<eos> They can invade your thoughts, and your dreams, it's not safe for you here.
They can invade your thoughts, and your dreams, it's not safe for you here.<eos> - Why do you they want to kill me?<eos> - Because they know you're a threat.<eos> They exist to keep me in this place, do you understand?<eos> Walk with me.<eos> - They're here. They can hear us now.<eos> - I'm frightened. It's too late now.<eos> I need you to wake up. Kate, wake up! I need you to wake up!<eos> Pop, how could you do that to me? How could you do that to me, Pop?<eos> I know I crossed the line a little bit, but what I was doing was what's good for you.
Why don't you do it, Autumn? You know more about this stuff than I do.<eos> And I'm gonna get in there and panic and I'm gonna forget what I'm supposed to do. Kate, you're gonna be all right.<eos> And I'm gonna do everything I can to get you back safely.<eos> Wouldn't you want someone to save you from a place like that?<eos> - When do we do this? - Now.<eos> Now?<eos> Why now?<eos> We can't let Harrison be in a place like that for another minute.<eos> Come sit on the sofa, please.<eos> I can't believe I just met you, and now I'm trusting you with my eternal soul.
And just when you think it can't get any worse, it starts all over again.<eos> How have you not lost your mind?<eos> I don't know. Because I've never totally lost hope.<eos> I don't know how I'm gonna make it 24 hours.<eos> What do you mean, 24 hours?<eos> Autumn says she'll bring me back in 24 hours.<eos> Kate, time's not linear here.<eos> We need to exert if we're gonna give this plan of yours a go.<eos> I still cannot believe you're here, risking your life for me.<eos> I couldn't save my husband, as God as my witness, I can save you.
Instead, I can be an astronaut.<eos> I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore.<eos> Today, I can hunt for tax exemptions.<eos> I'm gonna be an actuary!<eos> And I can make the world a better place.<eos> I am going to be... a police officer!<eos> Bunny cop?<eos> That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard.<eos> It may seem impossible to small minds...<eos> I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.
This has been my dream since I was a kid.<eos> It's a real proud day for us little guys.<eos> Bellwether, make room, will you? Come on.<eos> Okay, Officer Hopps.<eos> Let's see those teeth!<eos> - Officer Hopps, right here!<eos> - Look this way please!<eos> Hold still.<eos> Smile!<eos> We're real proud of you, Judy.
Anyway, according to your tax forms... you reported, let me see here... zero!<eos> Unfortunately, lying on a federal form is a punishable offense.<eos> Five years jail time.<eos> Well, it's my word against yours.<eos> 200 bucks a day, Fluff!<eos> 365 days a year, since I was 12.<eos> Actually, it's your word against yours.<eos> And if you want this pen, you're going to help me find this poor, missing otter... or the only place you'll be selling popsicles is the prison cafeteria.<eos> It's called a hustle, sweetheart.<eos> She hustled you.

- Is that him?<eos> - No!<eos> That's got to be him.<eos> Stop talking, stop talking, stop talking!<eos> Mr. Big, sir. This is a simple...<eos> This is a simple misunderstanding.<eos> You come here, unannounced, on the day my daughter is to be married.<eos> Well, actually, we were brought here against our will, so...<eos> The point is, I did not know that it was your car... and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding.<eos> I trusted you, Nicky.
Will more mammals go savage?<eos> What is being done to protect us?<eos> Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators?<eos> Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.<eos> That's all the time that we have.<eos> No more questions.<eos> Was I okay?<eos> You did fine.<eos> That went so fast.<eos> I didn't get a chance to mention you, or say anything about how we...
They thought it would be better... if a predator such as myself wasn't the first face that you see... when you walk into the ZPD.<eos> What?<eos> They're gonna move me to records.<eos> It's downstairs.<eos> It's by the boiler.<eos> Hopps!<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Our city is 90% prey, Judy... and right now they're just really scared.<eos> You're a hero to them.<eos> They trust you.
They're toxic flowers.<eos> I think someone is targeting predators on purpose and making them go savage!<eos> Isn't that interesting?<eos> Wait!<eos> I know you'll never forgive me! And I don't blame you.<eos> I wouldn't forgive me either.<eos> I was ignorant... And irresponsible and small-minded.<eos> But predators shouldn't have to suffer for my mistakes.<eos> I have to fix this.<eos> But I can't do it without you.
Yes!<eos> Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.<eos> Cut through the Natural History Museum!<eos> There it is!<eos> Judy!<eos> Mayor Bellwether!<eos> We found out what's happening.<eos> Someone's darting predators with a serum.<eos> That's what's making them go savage.<eos> I'm so proud of you, Judy.
Predators.<eos> They may be strong and loud... but prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.<eos> Think of it.<eos> 90% of the population... united against a common enemy.<eos> We'll be unstoppable.<eos> Over there!<eos> Help!<eos> Well, you should have just stayed on the carrot farm, huh?<eos> It really is too bad.<eos> I did like you.
We got it up there, thank you, Yakety-yak!<eos> You laid it all out beautifully.<eos> What?<eos> Are you looking for the serum?<eos> Well, it's right here.<eos> What you've got in the weapon there?<eos> Those are blueberries. From my family's farm.<eos> They are delicious.<eos> You should try some.<eos> I framed Lionheart. I can frame you, too.
BELGIUM, NOVEMBER 1918<eos> Alexander Luthor, your security override has been accepted.<eos> Genesis Chamber ready to analyze genetic sample.<eos> Acknowledging presence of genetic material.<eos> Analyzing.<eos> I've identified the host as General Zod of Kandor.<eos> Acknowledging presence of foreign genetic material.<eos> - Oh. - Analyzing.<eos> You flew too close to the sun.<eos> Now look at you.
Little red notes, big bang.<eos> You let your family die!<eos> And now, you will fly to him, and you will battle him, to the death.<eos> Black and Blue.<eos> Fight night!<eos> The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world.<eos> God vs man.<eos> Day vs night.<eos> Son of Krypton vs Bat of Gotham.<eos> You think I'll fight him for you?
We're no getting any answers.<eos> We're still right outside the containment center.<eos> A dangerous situation.<eos> Military and police personnel surrounding the area.<eos> Luthor.<eos> He wanted your life for her's.<eos> She's losing time.<eos> The scout ship seems to be drawing power from the city.<eos> It's got to be Lex.<eos> They need you at that ship.
You got to take it, Alfred.<eos> Ah. Right.<eos> Commencing drone mode.<eos> Thermal imaging is showing me two dozen hostile's on the third floor.<eos> Why don't I drop you off on the second?<eos> Drop it.<eos> I said, drop it!<eos> I'll kill her.<eos> Believe me, I'll do it!<eos> I believe you.

I tell you how to get out.<eos> Everything in between is on you.<eos> So we just gotta trust you.
Cate...<eos> What, are you kidnapping me?<eos> I'm not kidnapping you. Parents kidnap kids all the time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We gotta go quick.<eos> Let's go.<eos> No, fuck this.<eos> I'm not moving until you tell me what's going on.<eos> Cate, trust me. It's a long story, but if you want to live, you'll start listening.<eos> Trust you?
Because I certainly haven't had any of that up until now.<eos> Goddamn it! Cate, this isn't safe!<eos> Now, I'm done playing around with you.<eos> Get your ass in this car right now.<eos> What's up?<eos> Mama.<eos> Welcome home, Oscar.<eos> You have a beautiful family.<eos> I know you work with the Atlanta police department.<eos> There is something i need from you.
We can talk in the hallway.<eos> All right, just don't-- please, don't touch anything.<eos> Who's the-- what-- who's the girl?<eos> Never you mind.<eos> His daughter.<eos> His daughter?<eos> You didn't tell me you had a daughter.<eos> What's your name, sweetheart?<eos> Fuck off.<eos> I need to know everything you do about how this trick came to you, Jimmy.
Sure.<eos> Hold on.<eos> All right.<eos> First one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sheriff!<eos> Sheriff, these guys aren't cops!<eos> Sheriff, please.<eos> Nick...<eos> I no longer care about you, Nick.
Oh, you could have fooled me.<eos> I can't do this if i know you're in danger.<eos> And as long as you're with me-- you're starting to become-- what?<eos> I'm starting to become what?<eos> Too involved.<eos> I want to be involved!<eos> What if you got hurt?<eos> Everything I would have done would have meant nothing.<eos> Everything you've done?<eos> Everything I've done has been for you.

The hiding!<eos> All of it has been for you!
Most people pay cash so the cash register's gotta be completely full, and I already have a good out.<eos> Okay, the place next to it?<eos> Went out of business.<eos> They're completely vacant.<eos> No one's in the area.<eos> I could get in and out of there so quickly.<eos> Okay, let's just take it one step at a time here, please.<eos> Focus on graduating high school.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> I have something for you.
And you may find yourself looking for your large automobile.<eos> And you may find yourself without a beautiful house.<eos> Without a beautiful wife.<eos> And you may ask yourself...<eos> "Well, how did I get here?"<eos> Same as it ever was, same as it ever was.<eos> Same as it ever was.<eos> Same as it ever was.<eos> Welcome to the Hyatt Jeddah.<eos> I need you shiny and bright here, Alan.
Without a beautiful wife.<eos> And you may ask yourself...<eos> "Well, how did I get here?"<eos> Same as it ever was, same as it ever was.<eos> Same as it ever was.<eos> Same as it ever was.<eos> Welcome to the Hyatt Jeddah.<eos> I need you shiny and bright here, Alan.<eos> Look, we both know the only reason you got this job... is your connection to the king's nephew.<eos> You're in charge of a deal that's pivotal for the company... which makes it even more pivotal for you.
- Bullshit!<eos> Just sell it, for Christ's sakes.<eos> Then pay for your daughter's education.<eos> College is your thing.<eos> - Welcome to the Hyatt Jeddah.<eos> - Good night, guys.<eos> See you in the morning.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hi, Alan.<eos> I've got Eric Randall for you.
I'm so sorry, Kitty.<eos> It's actually doing me good.<eos> Dad.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I can use the break to rack up some extra tip money.<eos> I mean, I'm good at this.<eos> Yeah, but don't get used to it.<eos> You're going to college.<eos> Listen, Dad.<eos> I trust you.
Yeah, but don't get used to it.<eos> You're going to college.<eos> Listen, Dad.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Don't listen to Mom.<eos> She said, "What's he doing in the desert?<eos> His problems are here."<eos> I told her that you know what you're doing.<eos> And then she gets on me for taking your side.<eos> She says I'm like you... can't see the big picture, lacking ambition.
That's all Mr. Al-Ahmad told you?<eos> I didn't meet with him.<eos> I will tomorrow, hopefully.<eos> So, should we set up today?<eos> Yes.<eos> Unpack the rest of the gear.<eos> Check that we're ready for showtime.<eos> I think we should expect the unexpected.<eos> - This is Alan.<eos> - I've got Eric Randall for you.
- I did?<eos> - Yes, I was on a late shift.<eos> I had just finished an operation.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Alan!<eos> Alan.<eos> Yousefi<eos> - Salaam alaikum.<eos> - Alaikum salaam.<eos> - Oh, God, I called you, too.
Good.<eos> Hey, Kit.<eos> I'm writing to tell you that I'm postponing... my return to the United States... and I don't know for how long.<eos> The deal I was working on here in Jeddah didn't happen.<eos> A competitor from China offered the same technology a lot faster... and at half the price.<eos> I shouldn't have been surprised... but there I was, surprised.<eos> So, Kit, the money part of our lives is not solved just yet... but I'm working on it.<eos> I've taken a new job here which pays pretty well.<eos> It should be enough even to get you back into school next semester.<eos> Keep believing, Kit, 'cause I believe in you.
What are you doing out there?<eos> You ain't smoking again, are you?<eos> No, come on, Mom.<eos> You know I'm off that now.<eos> It just gets a bit stuffy in my room.<eos> Getting a bit of fresh air.<eos> Ain't you forgetting something?<eos> Head's up me ass today.<eos> Here, I've even given them a clean and all.<eos> Thanks, darling, I don't know what I'd do without you.
And sleeping next to you, of course.<eos> We gonna go to the Chelsea Ball next week?<eos> No.<eos> Come on...<eos> Do you actually ever stop to think about why I hate those events?<eos> They worship you and...<eos> Don't even notice me.<eos> Well, it is those events that pay the bills.<eos> This is new.<eos> Look at you, man.
What are you listening to?<eos> Here you are.<eos> Hey, what?<eos> Nina Simone, yeah?<eos> All right.<eos> This is my mom's kind of shit, you know.<eos> "Please don't let be misunderstood."<eos> Written for her in 1964.<eos> I was 10.<eos> I say what you need is a room of one's own, somewhere to write, somewhere where you can be inspired.
Breathe from deep within.<eos> All right.<eos> See you later, yeah?<eos> - What's this then, bruv?<eos> - Move, man. - Was that a love letter, fam?<eos> - My business.<eos> Your business is my business, cuz.<eos> - Big man Jules wants to see you anyways.<eos> - What?<eos> Why's he telling you?
No, no, no.<eos> No way.<eos> Look, I've known Daniel my entire life.<eos> He's a lot of things, but he ain't no snitch.<eos> It's a fact, and this ain't some muggy 9:00 to 5:00 where you can just hand in your notice.<eos> You can try and leave this life, but this life will never leave you.<eos> Very poetic.<eos> Thank you, Vincent.<eos> Hey, look, I've got a soldier who's ready to step up.<eos> Nothing will change for you, man.

Yeah?<eos> What, you sure he's gonna trust me?<eos> Yeah, man, don't watch that.<eos> He knows you've been my boy for a time.<eos> Nice.<eos> You're gonna be on your own now, though.<eos> You sure you're gonna be cool with that?<eos> Yeah, man, I've been on my own for time.<eos> No more looking in the rearview.<eos> Your man's got a future on you now.
Yeah, man, I've been on my own for time.<eos> No more looking in the rearview.<eos> Your man's got a future on you now.<eos> What about Daniel?<eos> Yeah, I've still got to take care of that, man.<eos> Man should've known who he's dealing with!<eos> Oh, shit, what brings you round these days, cuz?<eos> I thought you got chucked out.<eos> Yo, Jules wants you gone, fam.<eos> He don't trust you.
What are you fucking saying?<eos> It's all my fault?<eos> You wouldn't have gotten pregnant by that fucking...<eos> It's yours, Max.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I didn't take any risks.<eos> It can only be yours.<eos> I told you to be gone, man.<eos> Time moves on, and you ain't nothing but a dumb relic now.<eos> Vincent told me if I don't get rid of you, then we're both done.
I told you to be gone, man.<eos> Time moves on, and you ain't nothing but a dumb relic now.<eos> Vincent told me if I don't get rid of you, then we're both done.<eos> Go on, fucking do it, then!<eos> Go on!<eos> Do it!<eos> You have to end this now.<eos> You have to make a decision.<eos> What do you really, really want?<eos> What's important to you?
You have to make a decision.<eos> What do you really, really want?<eos> What's important to you?<eos> You're not even gonna do it, are you?<eos> He's a fucking pussy, yo!<eos> Hey, step aside, Kings.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Think about your children.<eos> Think about Leo and Evie.<eos> They need you.
Kathy?<eos> Kath!<eos> - Here you go, mate.<eos> Here's your drink. - Cheers, man.<eos> Surprise!<eos> Happy anniversary, babe!<eos> Come here, silly bollocks.<eos> If we get a kid, he's gonna play rugby.<eos> A game for gentleman, not hooligans.<eos> - I've got something for you.
Yeah.<eos> It's moving.<eos> There's some kind of storm out here!<eos> We just took off the ship's raincoat.<eos> Warning, unstable electromagnetic activity!<eos> Final systems offline.<eos> Transfers done.<eos> What next?<eos> Send that data across to me.<eos> What do you mean, just send it to you?
Not with you, anyway.<eos> There's something I got to do for someone and... I don't have much time.<eos> Hatch.<eos> The crash?<eos> it was Hatch, wasn't it?<eos> You know, this isn't the first time he attacked us.<eos> Before attacking prisons, he was raiding convoys and colonies.<eos> He kills a lot of people.<eos> It's what he does.<eos> Or did he fail to mention that to you?
Evac in 30 minutes.<eos> You came.<eos> I heard from the ship. They're leaving.<eos> Now.<eos> So are you coming?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you?<eos> Not leaving without us.<eos> I meant what I said back there. About your clothes?<eos> They see you like that they shoot you in the spot.
Son of a bitch!<eos> REEF ?<eos> How long to Liberation Day?<eos> 76 days until Liberation Day.<eos> You hear that?<eos> We're getting out of here.<eos> What about Oleander?<eos> Can't come with us.<eos> What?<eos> I remember you.
Not really.<eos> You're not a kid anymore.<eos> You're old enough to protect yourself.<eos> I'm not asking you to protect me.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> The man I remember wouldn't just leave somebody to die.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> But I do remember that you used to be funny.<eos> You used to smile at us just to see us laugh.<eos> I'm looking at you now, Kye and... your eyes, they're different.
We can't be here.<eos> I'm not okay, you're not okay.<eos> We can't be here!<eos> You!<eos> You think you know him, you think you know Hatch,<eos> you think you know him.<eos> Just lie down.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Now do something!<eos> He'll come after you!
I'm not okay, you're not okay.<eos> We can't be here!<eos> You!<eos> You think you know him, you think you know Hatch,<eos> you think you know him.<eos> Just lie down.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Now do something!<eos> He'll come after you!<eos> He'll come after you and there'll be no place for you to hide!
Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> It's time.<eos> It's happening.<eos> Kye, your routine should not be broken.<eos> You must stay within the perimeter today.<eos> No way I'm missing it again.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> I'm sorry her ID badge was taken.<eos> I know what it means to you, Kye.
All I wanted was the Arrowhead data.<eos> You're gonna kill me for it.<eos> No.<eos> I just always have a "plan B".<eos> Research data, Kye.<eos> Where'd you dump it?<eos> it's on the wrist link.<eos> In the shuttle.<eos> Wrong answer.<eos> You know what I don't like about you?
That's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> You got through to me.<eos> REEF did most of the work.<eos> He said he'd try.<eos> REEF.<eos> Look at you!
You still can't get this through your thick skull?<eos> This place... we can't let it fall under the wrong hands!<eos> We're gotta do this together, Kye!<eos> But you're weak!<eos> You're nothing!<eos> This war has no place for people like you.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> You're recruited me.<eos> Are you bringing my levotator, Kye?<eos> We'll get you a better one.
- Where were you?<eos> - Who's there?<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Mommy's here.<eos> Mommy's here.<eos> There's someone in the house!<eos> My name is Jan. Jan Strook.<eos> My cybername is Dutchman.<eos> I am now the sole administrator for Vigilant Shield, the Emergency Command and Control System for the United States.<eos> I brought you in, I made you my partner.
Still, I saw you first.<eos> Not the other way around.<eos> But you didn't say anything.<eos> You were dancing with Peter Reinke.<eos> And then you went with him to the chestnut tree.<eos> You with your crown of flowers. Laughing, as if he was incredibly funny.<eos> Reinke... with his stupid haircut.<eos> He's bald now and a member of the Party.<eos> I would have danced with you, too, but you didn't ask.<eos> You knew the way I looked at you.
- Nothing happened?<eos> Did you see who they arrested?<eos> A bum.<eos> He probably stole something.<eos> It has nothing to do with us.<eos> That's the husband of our postmistress!<eos> What makes you think it has nothing to do with us?<eos> They're divorced.<eos> That doesn't mean anything, damn it!<eos> I was so afraid for you.
Ami, what's happening?<eos> The red flower.<eos> Everybody, get to the river!<eos> Red flower.<eos> Pups, come on.<eos> Stay close.<eos> Is that Mowgli?<eos> Shere Khan!<eos> Shere Khan!<eos> I'm not afraid of you!

It's just you and me now!<eos> Break, break!<eos> You've got nowhere to go, man-cub!<eos> Did you think I would let you grow old?<eos> Either I'll devour you or the red flower will.<eos> It's just a matter of time.<eos> How long did you really think you'd survive against me?<eos> Longer than your father did?<eos> Longer than... akela?<eos> I'm not afraid of you!

Love awakens the soul to act.<eos> That's not fair.<eos> Quoting Dante to me.<eos> But it's beauty, not love.<eos> What?<eos> It's a minute to midnight.<eos> Sooner than I expected.<eos> Where're we going?<eos> I see.<eos> We planned it together, we designed it together, but this part only belongs to you.
I see.<eos> We planned it together, we designed it together, but this part only belongs to you.<eos> It's just safer if you don't know where.<eos> What if they find you first?<eos> What then?<eos> If you want to know, you're not alone.<eos> You got to start by trust me.<eos> Unless we take bold immediate action the sixth extinction will be our own.<eos> You were right.<eos> I'm going to make you another path.

Is that a regret?<eos> Only when I think about it.<eos> Would you have say the same things happened in doorways, at the borders, right along the edges.<eos> Ancient fishermen learned to sail where the warm water met the cold.<eos> The little fish would reach the edge of the warm water and they stopped.<eos> And the big fish would come out of the cold water and they eat them.<eos> And the fishermen.<eos> Well, they caught everyone.<eos> Doorways.<eos> Not one part of you has changed, Robert.
So, what will happen to the...?<eos> We'll take it back to Geneva for test, there will be an annunciation.<eos> We'll have to generate another gene sequences first to get an idea what we are dealing with.<eos> There' a lot of work to be done.<eos> And you, Cambridge?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dr. Sinskey?<eos> Life tore us apart again.<eos> Like Dante and Beatrice.<eos> I have something for you.

And now, all this is happening on top.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The timing isn't a coincidence.<eos> Negative entities often feed off emotional distress.<eos> They like to kick you when you're down.<eos> That hardly seems fair.<eos> No, it really isn't.<eos> Do you know when the voice is gonna speak?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> And when it does, does it feel like it's coming from inside you?
They like to kick you when you're down.<eos> That hardly seems fair.<eos> No, it really isn't.<eos> Do you know when the voice is gonna speak?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> And when it does, does it feel like it's coming from inside you?<eos> No.<eos> More like it's coming from behind me.<eos> Like I'm being used.<eos> Does it ever say things just to you?
I'm not sensing anything.<eos> We could be looking at hysterical neurosis.<eos> That would explain the multiple personalities and hallucinations.<eos> That doesn't feel right, either.<eos> Well...<eos> I can't explain it.<eos> My heart is telling me to believe them.<eos> I heard that voice with my own ears, but all I can sense is their own fear.<eos> I can't seem to see beyond that.<eos> I don't think I can sleep this far away from you.
It helps me sleep.<eos> At least I know I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I didn't smoke, Mum.<eos> Eh?<eos> That day with Camilla at school.<eos> I was holding the cigarette, but I wasn't going to take a puff.<eos> I just wanted to look cool in front of her.<eos> It was stupid.<eos> Oh, love.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
No!<eos> I got you.<eos> Come on.<eos> No!<eos> Janet.<eos> Ed! Ed!<eos> Ed!<eos> Lorraine!<eos> Ed!<eos> Your name gives me dominion over you, demon.
You all right?<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> - Does she look all right?<eos> - Yeah, she's fine.<eos> You saved her.<eos> No.<eos> You saved us.<eos> Didn't I tell you it was meant to be?<eos> But you believed in me.<eos> I couldn't have done it without you.
- Yes. Welcome back to the Beast, Jonathan.<eos> My strategy for the night is make the big moves, the risky moves that get the big points.<eos> Even though I'm tired and beat up, I'm ready to fight again.<eos> This is great.<eos> Jonathan is a force to be reckoned with in this competition.<eos> He is a decathlete who's trained with Olympic athletes, but he's also here to battle the Beast for another reason.<eos> I'm here for my kids to show them what life can be like with passion.<eos> If I can win and my kids can be inspired at who their dad is, and that can shape them to believe they can be something more, that's the biggest win for me.<eos> He wants to translate his decathlon skills to the big screen and become the ultimate superhero for movies.<eos> Terry, you know a few people in the business.
No, it's not.<eos> It's not. It's early.<eos> But with only 50 points, he's going to need a lot of luck to move on.<eos> Up next is Steven Tucker from the United States.<eos> To be the Ultimate Beastmaster means a lot.<eos> It's getting to beat all these people, competing against the best on a harder course now.<eos> I think it'll just be, you know, amazing.<eos> Tonight, Steven made it further on the Energy Coils than he had in his previous run.<eos> Oh, great, great jump.<eos> You're making me nervous! You're making me nervous, Steven.
There's the wind up, and the pitch!<eos> Aah! That was not a good jump.<eos> David Manthei fell.<eos> David scored 40 points, and with three finalists left to run, he is officially on the bubble and in danger of being eliminated.<eos> That's shocking to me.<eos> Wow! It gets interesting, because the man who could knock David out happens to be his fellow countrymate, break-dancing sensation Phillip Meyer.<eos> He's almost as good a break-dancer as I am,<eos> - which is saying a lot.<eos> - Terry, I mean...<eos> I don't know why you tell lies.
Whoa! That was precarious.<eos> He's relieved. Even he's shocked.<eos> And this is it.<eos> Steven Tucker's fate hangs on this last jump.<eos> He does it!<eos> But unfortunately for Steven Tucker, that means he is eliminated.<eos> To the Mag Wall he goes.<eos> Heeyong Park finished this the last time.<eos> Is he going to be our third finalist to finish Level 1 tonight?<eos> You're talking about an ice climber.
But unfortunately for Steven Tucker, that means he is eliminated.<eos> To the Mag Wall he goes.<eos> Heeyong Park finished this the last time.<eos> Is he going to be our third finalist to finish Level 1 tonight?<eos> You're talking about an ice climber.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is right in his wheelhouse.<eos> Just sit back like you're at the movies. Get comfortable.<eos> Is he gonna go for that Point Thruster?<eos> You know he's going for that Point Thruster.
Let's see if this time he's got it.<eos> Oh, man. Those handles are falling in the blood.<eos> No!<eos> And he falls into the blood!<eos> Oh, it's all right.<eos> He knows he's moving on to Level 2 of the finals.<eos> The German is out! We have to pack our bags.<eos> Yes, our presenter job here is over.<eos> Whoo! I love you!<eos> You're the man!
- Good, good.<eos> - Good.<eos> Look how he uses those leg muscles to pull himself up!<eos> And there he is!<eos> All right.<eos> He's struggling here.<eos> He's... up there!<eos> Heeyong Park!<eos> He made it!<eos> You know Katie's down there jumping around.
There's gotta be more to this than just falling past these cables.<eos> You've gotta make sure that you have control.<eos> If you want that Point Thruster, you need to make sure you have enough cable to hold yourself with as you go for it.<eos> Doesn't look like he's going that direction.<eos> Oh, now he's kind of making his way back.<eos> Oh, and he's got it!<eos> He struggled on Stomach Churn last time, and now they're going 15 percent faster.<eos> He fell off this thing.<eos> Oh, look... Yeah, his nerves are getting him.<eos> When you have fallen off one of these things...

Yeah, his nerves are getting him.<eos> When you have fallen off one of these things...<eos> This is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder right here.<eos> - You cannot...
Yeah! Now, people have to understand, Stomach Churn in the finals is going 15 percent faster.<eos> - I mean...<eos> - It couldn't get any more rough!<eos> Look at him.<eos> He's trying to shake cobwebs off.<eos> You cannot let yourself get dizzy on this thing.<eos> See, right when he spins, right there. You gotta jump, right?<eos> - Your disorientation skills...<eos> - 'Cause the longer you stay... on the spinning gears, the dizzier you get, as he tries to regroup.<eos> And it's going faster than you remember!
Despite that injury, Air Force Ken still managed to get 160 points, and that puts him in fourth place on the leader board.<eos> Oh, he is in pain.<eos> He is wincing in pain, reaching down for his right quad.<eos> We do have an EMT staff rushing to his aid right now.<eos> - Look at him.<eos> Good news, good news!<eos> - Yeah, he's walking.<eos> Good!<eos> Come on, Ken!<eos> You got it, Ken!
What happened?<eos> A bad jump, my Roberto.<eos> Ken Corigliano is in!<eos> In!<eos> The angels!<eos> That was unbelievable!<eos> What went wrong here?<eos> Oh, what happened?<eos> He just was too disoriented.<eos> - Did you try too hard?
I swear, I'm in shock.<eos> I wasn't expecting that.<eos> No, it's not possible.<eos> All right, Terry, unfortunately we have some bad news for Ken Corigliano.<eos> Those injuries have officially removed him from the competition.<eos> He has been through a lot of stuff.<eos> That fact he's here when doctors told him he couldn't walk again...<eos> If there's ever a guy that can overcome some physical pain, it's Ken Corigliano.<eos> Ken! We love you, Ken!<eos> We love you, brother!
He's going to Prism Strike!<eos> Going for the Point Thruster!<eos> With one hand!<eos> I mean, this guy is literally the textbook on how to approach all these challenges.<eos> And this is what he does.<eos> Look at this man as he goes through Coil Crawl.<eos> Look at the way he...<eos> Now he's just showing off.<eos> That's a technique.<eos> You just learned it.
- He's very wobbly. - Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, man. Oh, oh, oh...<eos> Careful.<eos> Good job.<eos> - He got it!<eos> - He got it!<eos> He's in second position right now.<eos> He has secured...<eos> But wait! Are you gonna go for it?
Careful.<eos> Good job.<eos> - He got it!<eos> - He got it!<eos> He's in second position right now.<eos> He has secured...<eos> But wait! Are you gonna go for it?<eos> If he doesn't succeed, he loses 40 points.<eos> Yeah, forget it.<eos> You can't risk that.
This is insane.<eos> - Look! How evenly matched!<eos> - Absolutely incredible.<eos> They're hitting these Energy Taps at the same exact time.<eos> - Let's go, Felipe! Losing his footing a little.<eos> Heeyong Park kind of breaks away in the lead.<eos> - My goodness!<eos> - They're evenly matched.<eos> Look at that.<eos> You can see Heeyong is way ahead.
Just better not to get you guys involved in case I'm wrong.<eos> And how may I help you?<eos> For starters, you can tell me how you sleep at night.<eos> I...<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Using city trucks to move drugs.<eos> Blackmailing your assistant to take the fall for you.<eos> Listen, young man, I don't know what you're trying to insinuate, but...<eos> How's it work?<eos> You sentence rival crews to harsher sentences while you control the streets?

Well, it looks like your gamma frequencies are still lagging behind.<eos> I got some meds that should be able to help with that.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Whatever he gives you, don't take it.<eos> Clem, what are you not telling me?<eos> We need to get out of here.<eos> These are not good people, and they're not with the IADG.<eos> Who are they?<eos> They're Shepherds.<eos> Who are you?
He doesn't deserve to be called a man, not after what he did.<eos> A little dramatic, don't you think?<eos> Shut up.<eos> His name is Greg Mansdale.<eos> He's a Shepherd.<eos> For the last three months, he's been giving me information, information I use against the other Shepherds.<eos> He's one of the people who poisoned the planet, sterilized humanity.<eos> He's one of the people who took Mitch from us.<eos> Do you know anything about my father?<eos> You're Mitch Morgan's girl.
You, your lions and that adorable little girlfriend of yours have been chasing after me.<eos> You have something of mine.<eos> The disc.<eos> Consider it a gift.<eos> So you'll remember me when your world crumbles around you.<eos> Who do you think you are?<eos> 96 people are dead because of you.<eos> You understand that?<eos> - I always imagined you were smarter than you appeared.<eos> Who are you?
- You either!<eos> Dad, I know this is hard to understand right now.<eos> - Stop talking.<eos> - Don't listen to her.<eos> Stop talking, both of you, stop talking.<eos> - Don't do it, Dad.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Why don't we all just take a breath, and put the guns away.<eos> You first.
No.<eos> No. - I can prove<eos> - I'm your daughter.<eos> - Keep your hand out...<eos> Stay the hell out of this.<eos> No, Dad!<eos> My parking ticket.<eos> Dad.<eos> I didn't know you had it in you.<eos> Who are you?
I stopped by this morning with coffee and donuts.<eos> Todd wasn't exactly having the easiest time with his recovery, so I try to stop by once a day.<eos> Stacy, can you think of anyone who might want to hurt Todd or these other two men?<eos> It may be nothing, but... a few times that I was here, a couple of guys came by.<eos> They didn't say much.<eos> They just went and talked to Mark, the counselor here.<eos> They never stayed long.<eos> Ten minutes, tops.<eos> And Mark said that they were recovering addicts and that he was trying to help them, but...<eos> But you didn't think so.
But what we do care about is catching whoever gunned down three innocent people in pursuit of that inventory.<eos> So, who ripped you off, Makoa?<eos> What makes you think I know?<eos> Come on.<eos> You're a smart guy.<eos> A criminal mastermind like yourself, you must have some kind of a theory.<eos> How about a rival gang or something?<eos> I got no idea who did this.<eos> And we don't believe you. So, you can either give us a name or we will bust that ass right now for using Clear Path as a stash house.<eos> I'll beat that, and you know it.
Leave a message.<eos> Yeah, hi... I'm, I'm looking for a date.<eos> 555-0178.<eos> How long till they get back to you? A date.<eos> Is that what you call it?<eos> How long until they get back to you?<eos> A few minutes.<eos> Sometimes longer.<eos> Help me out here.<eos> What's a guy like you, with everything... A good job, a nice home, a loving family...
She said she enjoyed what she did.<eos> She said that.<eos> And you believed her?<eos> Do you think those girls do what they do out of choice?<eos> Or out of survival?<eos> They're slaves.<eos> They're beaten and brutalized like slaves.<eos> They're branded like slaves.<eos> Girls as young as seven.<eos> Made to service a dozen guys like you every day, seven days a week.
According to him, it was first turned on in a convenience store in Waikiki.<eos> HPD talked to the manager there.<eos> They checked the sales record and the security footage and were able to I.D. the buyer.<eos> Well, look at that.<eos> You guys know her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Stacy.<eos> You're a pretty smart girl there, baby Stace.<eos> 'Cause as far as we can tell, none of the folks who came through Clear Path had any idea there was meth in the walls.<eos> But you figured that out, didn't you?
Well, look at that.<eos> You guys know her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Stacy.<eos> You're a pretty smart girl there, baby Stace.<eos> 'Cause as far as we can tell, none of the folks who came through Clear Path had any idea there was meth in the walls.<eos> But you figured that out, didn't you?<eos> What'd you do, see all those dehumidifiers and the two guys and put it together?<eos> Or did you just, hear a little something through the grapevine?<eos> The trouble is, you may be an ex-junkie, but you're not a killer.
The trouble is, you may be an ex-junkie, but you're not a killer.<eos> Which is where your boyfriend comes in.<eos> And we're not talking about Todd.<eos> We're talking about Calvin.<eos> We know you've been seeing him on the side while Todd has been trying to put his life back together.<eos> I got some bad news for you, Stace.<eos> Five-O!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Calvin didn't make it.<eos> And we found a bunch of guns in the house that lab is running ballistics on right now, and if one of those weapons is the murder weapon, you're going to prison as an accessory.
You're coming with me, you're coming with me.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Move, move, HPD. Go, go, go.<eos> Hold. Hands.<eos> Let me see your hands.<eos> Right now.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Aren't you gonna take me to the doctor or something?<eos> Yeah, that's, that's one of our top priorities.<eos> You're Emilio's right hand, aren't you?

And then you locked her in a closet to starve, but we found her, and you know what?<eos> She's a tough kid.<eos> She's gonna testify and after she does, all those other girls, they're gonna follow suit.<eos> Let me break it down for you, Tori.<eos> Tonight you're gonna stay at the women's correctional facility.<eos> We know a lot of inmates there.<eos> Some of them owe us favors, other ones looking to get on our good side.<eos> You see where I'm going with this?<eos> Those women will do to you whatever we ask, and the guards will look the other way.<eos> So, this is how you want to play it, that's fine 'cause tonight you're the one that's getting the beatdown.

Do you know that scene in the casino we always wait for?<eos> Him dressed in a tux, playing a high-stakes game of baccarat.<eos> You see Idris Elba walking over to the bartender now to place that iconic order.<eos> "Bartender, I'll take my martini shaken, not stirred.<eos> The name's..."<eos> "James Bond. I know."<eos> "I'm sorry, mate, have we met?"<eos> "No.<eos> I just heard there was a spy in town.<eos> Figured it was you."
"James Bond. I know."<eos> "I'm sorry, mate, have we met?"<eos> "No.<eos> I just heard there was a spy in town.<eos> Figured it was you."<eos> "What gave me away?<eos> Is it the way I dress?"<eos> "Oh, there's just something about you."<eos> "Something like what?"<eos> "You know...
Modern cities are miracles Of design and engineering, They come with consequences.<eos> Energy consumption, Overcrowding, These problems plague The modern metropolis.<eos> Ancient designers built Shelters that complemented. Nature, not Battled against it. And now we are looking To the past to solve.<eos> From About ad 600 to ad 1300, The ancestral pueblo People lived here.<eos> It would have taken a lot Of social organization to. Build a village like this one.<eos> Over 150 different rooms, Probably that many People coming together.<eos> People were living in what Amounts to apartment buildings.<eos> All together, stacked one On top of one another.<eos> We're in a shelter that's A societal shelter.<eos> You would be buffered Against risks, So if your farm plot Didn't pan out for a year, You had neighbors who Could help you out.
This whole notion Of the american dream is tied. To being able to have a Single family home, a yard, A place of your own.<eos> What was incredible About levittown was it.<eos> Was made possible.<eos> Because of all these great Advances to be able to. Construct materials Cheaply so that the, The pieces would come in A kit of parts that were,<eos> It was a confluence of Technology and desire coming.<eos> Together and so it spread Like wildfire all over. The united states, This notion of a suburb.<eos> Can we afford it?<eos> Veterans Program, we can.<eos> Then we Can get married.<eos> You'd have a garage.
Okay?<eos> Well, my captain disagrees.<eos> He's concerned for your well-being.<eos> Well, he needn't be.<eos> Clay Maxwell's in jail.<eos> And after tomorrow, he will have exhausted all of his appeals.<eos> I got no reason to be looking over my shoulder.<eos> It's not Clay my boss is worried about.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well you probably too young to know who Clay Maxwell is.
And after tomorrow, he will have exhausted all of his appeals.<eos> I got no reason to be looking over my shoulder.<eos> It's not Clay my boss is worried about.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well you probably too young to know who Clay Maxwell is.<eos> He was my ex-partner and he killed his wife of 20 years... so if somebody down at the force has a problem with me going after him, then perhaps they shouldn't be cops.<eos> Well, he's not in prison for murder, though, is he?<eos> No, he's not.<eos> He's in prison because he stole some money from a crime scene, and he wasn't as good at covering that up as he was about covering up killing his wife.<eos> No, he's there because you turned him in.
No, he's not.<eos> He's in prison because he stole some money from a crime scene, and he wasn't as good at covering that up as he was about covering up killing his wife.<eos> No, he's there because you turned him in.<eos> Look here, young fella.<eos> Your youth is showing right now.<eos> See, you look confused about the code between guys like us.<eos> That code doesn't apply to guys who murder their wives in cold blood.<eos> That code doesn't apply to a guy who would send a dope dealer and a bent FBI agent after his ex-partner and his family to kill them.<eos> That's right.<eos> That was a special day out in the jungle, probably could've used a tough guy like you.

Grab your coat.<eos> We're leaving.<eos> We didn't even get the pizza yet.<eos> Will, we're leaving.<eos> You still want pizza, they're telling me the place delivers.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Guys, looks like they're almost finished.<eos> If we're gonna make a move, we need to make it now.<eos> Yeah, you.
Love you, too.<eos> Hey, don't go crazy on this room service. All right?<eos> This ain't Home Alone and you ain't Macaulay Culkin.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, good morning, Officer Bennett.<eos> Captain.<eos> You ready to go?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> But you're not coming.
Well, good morning, Officer Bennett.<eos> Captain.<eos> You ready to go?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> But you're not coming.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You heard me.<eos> My voice carries.<eos> I'm going down to the courthouse.<eos> You're gonna stay here.
You know where he had his bar mitzvah?<eos> In the jungle, getting chased and shot at, thinking his old man was gonna die.<eos> He didn't deserve that.<eos> Nobody deserves that.<eos> Least of all, him.<eos> He's 15.<eos> After that whole ordeal, I'm thinking this whole thing with Clay Maxwell, it's over now, but it's become clear to me that it might never be over.<eos> So... get this and get it straight:<eos> if anything and I mean anything happens to my boy because somebody's got a problem with something that I did, I will come back to this city and I will rain down holy hell on the Chicago Police Department, the likes of which they've never seen.<eos> The first person I'm coming after is you!

I think you're much smarter than your father.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I agree.<eos> Sticking around instead of taking off somewhere else to hide, that was very smooth.<eos> She wasn't just hiding, she was operating under our noses for almost a year.<eos> I came in here to tell you-- I think it's important. I know for a fact that you're planning on going to the U.S. District Attorney's Office.<eos> Cut a deal, give 'em some information about other clans, get a lighter sentence.<eos> Whatever it is, you need to know... that I'm gonna do everything in my power to stop that happening.<eos> There's not gonna be any deals, okay?<eos> You came after us, and you came after our families.

Thank you.<eos> You mean, uh, as opposed to you?<eos> Yeah. I heard you been asking around about me.<eos> I have. Hmm.<eos> Wow, that must have taken some pull to get those files unsealed.<eos> But as far as the brass is concerned, you know, it's like they say-- what happens in Afghanistan stays in Afghanistan.<eos> I got to be honest with you.<eos> Whatever happened in Afghanistan is not my concern.<eos> When banks on this island start getting robbed, and innocent people start getting killed, that gets my attention.<eos> I know you and your crew were behind these jobs.
No.<eos> No, I don't think you do.<eos> Because if you did, I'd be sitting in a jail cell right now.<eos> Not here, finishing up my loco moco.<eos> You know, that car you guys smashed into yesterday, the passenger didn't make it.<eos> He was navy.<eos> As a matter of fact, he was one of the last remaining survivors of the USS Arizona.<eos> His name was Leonard Patterson. He was 92 years old.<eos> He was a legit war hero... who served his country with honor and with valor.<eos> But those two things are not things that you'd really know about, are they, Campbell?

They investigated us.<eos> Yeah, our military investigated you 'cause you ran your crew like a death squad.<eos> You murdered innocent people.<eos> No, we did what we needed to do to protect our own.<eos> Enough.<eos> There you go.<eos> You're welcome for the coffee.<eos> You know, war is messy, McGarrett.<eos> Always has been, always will be.<eos> And I would have thought you, out of anybody else, would have understood that.
Just didn't know how you'd be more comfortable.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I know I'm supposed to be happy now... that we're all safe.<eos> Cheryl, those people are safe because of you.<eos> You were brave, you didn't lose your cool.<eos> I just keep thinking about all of the millions of things that could have gone wrong.<eos> Yeah, but they didn't.<eos> So, what? I'm just supposed to move on now, act like nothing happened.<eos> Something did happen.<eos> You found out when the stakes are at their highest... you're at your very best.
Somebody made it through security without a full screening.<eos> It happens every now and then.<eos> Rebecca Larmont?<eos> Rebecca Larmont?<eos> - Did you order a pizza?<eos> - No.<eos> Stop where you are!<eos> - Not until I make my delivery.<eos> - Stop him. Oh!<eos> Rebecca Larmont, you've been served.
Special Agent Sam Hanna.<eos> NCIS. Nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> We're investigating Rebecca Larmont.<eos> Is she okay?<eos> Oh, yeah, she's fine.<eos> How well do you know her? Extremely well.<eos> That's mi novia.<eos> That's my girlfriend.<eos> You recently purchased her a car.
It's not my kind of place.<eos> You know Rebecca's husband works there.<eos> I've never met him, but I...<eos> I know he's desperate for money.<eos> Think he'll buy it? It's all about misdirection.<eos> He'll never realize he's the suspect if he thinks he's working for us.<eos> Here we go. Victor?<eos> Hey. Hi.<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> Well... You were right.
That's an interesting combination.<eos> Pad of paper.<eos> Sometimes you got to ask yourself WWCD?<eos> What would Colombo do?<eos> Oh. Winner, winner, TV dinner.<eos> Alonzo.<eos> Hey, I'm late for a meeting. I...<eos> That's okay.<eos> We just wanted to ask you about this.<eos> What about it? You met with Perez Bianco outside The Oriana.
I don't know, this is crazy.<eos> Maybe you should try that one-time pad thing.<eos> No, no, no, Sam was a mathlete, he can do it in his head.<eos> All right, go ahead.<eos> Math-a-lete. Math-a-lete.<eos> Let's see what you got.<eos> W-i-l-l...<eos> Mm-hmm. Y-o-u.<eos> "Will you." SAM:<eos> Will you. Will you...

You're a angel.
You can't calculate traffic patterns in a vacuum without accounting for human error.<eos> Ah, the mighty Sam Hanna is human.<eos> I didn't err, G.<eos> Took a principled stance not to use Waze.<eos> I know, that's why we're late.<eos> NCIS Agent Callen.<eos> This is my partner, Agent Sam Hanna.<eos> Ah, NCIS in the flesh. Mmm.<eos> I just found out you guys existed.<eos> And you are?
I just found out you guys existed.<eos> And you are?<eos> Not allowed to let you inside, but also extremely, incredibly sorry about it.<eos> Well, Agent Morris, inside of Bryant's house is a critical part of our investigation into his kidnapping.<eos> Which is why you'll have full access the millisecond we close ours.<eos> You know, we could work together.<eos> That would be amaze-balls.<eos> What do you guys have?<eos> Nothing. Which is why we need to go inside.<eos> You owe us one. Rude.
It has been eye-opening.<eos> Anytime.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay. Yeah, um, sir.<eos> Could you, um...<eos> I think he needs his nose packed again, but really, like, get-- really-- get it in there.<eos> Okay? 'Cause it's...<eos> Actually, am I allowed to leave now?<eos> Well, I, um... Oh.<eos> You wish.
Well, I, um... Oh.<eos> You wish.<eos> Oh, you think you got FOMO?<eos> You don't even know FOMO.<eos> Robert Bryant, you're under arrest.<eos> Guys, take him away.<eos> You want to tell me why? Man up.<eos> We found those "lost" patient records from the VA that you had stashed at your house.<eos> Hi.<eos> And you are?
I thought that would be like a catalyst for a whole new culinary Kensi. Right.<eos> First of all, that's not cooking, that's baking, and second of all, what, you want cookies for dinner?<eos> Sure, I love cookies for dinner.<eos> Okay, fine, I'll make cookies for dinner.<eos> - Great, we're having cookies for dinner. - Mm-hmm. Yaniv!<eos> This is taking too long.<eos> Hello?<eos> We're coming in. We got that search warrant to your very, very, large house.<eos> Evidently paid for with pawnshop money.<eos> Oh, there you are.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Time out.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Well, that gold ain't gonna find itself.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> It has become painfully obvious that the three of you cannot be trusted on your own, so...<eos> Sam?<eos> I'll take Bridges.<eos> All right.<eos> Admiral Chegwidden, you're with me.<eos> Leaves you and me, Langston.
This is where it goes from bad to life in prison.<eos> You understand?<eos> Start with his thumbs.<eos> - Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. - What are you doing?<eos> Whoa.<eos> Bridges, Bridges. Hey, hey! Where'd you take Asher, punk?<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> ! Where'd you take him?<eos> ! Bridges, enough! This is a country mile from enough.<eos> - Hey! - You, too.
He needs to go to the hospital.<eos> My tetanus is up to date.<eos> Yeah, and I just dewormed him.<eos> He still needs to be looked at by a physician.<eos> Look, he's been shot before, but for real.<eos> Five times to be exact.<eos> Closing in on Suge and Fiddy.<eos> Almost there.<eos> Mm-hmm. Mr. Beale.<eos> Uh... you scared me.
Your friend, he insults me.<eos> Who says he's my friend?<eos> You boys seem pretty jumpy.<eos> Might want to cut back on the tea.<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh, that?<eos> That is a transcript of conversations and e-mails that tie you to a bunch of criminal organizations.<eos> You know... these are trying times for Muslims in this country.<eos> Especially those involved in illegal activity.<eos> I suggest you and your non-friend leave before I call the police.
Sam!<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Guys, you okay?<eos> Here, I got you.<eos> - You okay? You all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Think so.<eos> I need a drink.<eos> Mr. Beale, come on.<eos> You're gonna pour.
And you kind of had your shot.<eos> Not to be a stickler for detail, but I've actually proposed three times, if you count the very romantic version I did while you were in a coma.<eos> Baby, what are you doing?<eos> Life is really short, Deeks.<eos> I mean, we saw that today, and we see it every day.<eos> And I don't know how much time either one of us has left, but I do know this:<eos> I want to spend the rest of what I have with you.<eos> ♪ Ooh... ♪ So what's it gonna be?<eos> ♪ Ooh... ♪ I mean, I don't know, I mean, this is it's a lot for a girl to process.<eos> You're such an idiot.
What a pleasant surprise.<eos> How are you?<eos> Honestly, I've been better.<eos> Do you have time?<eos> Leonard says you're very busy these days.<eos> Oh, I just say that because he prattles.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room, and it's brought up a lot of negative feelings for me. Mm.<eos> Well, what do you think the loss of your room represents?<eos> Beverly, you know I hold you in high esteem.

I'd write that down, but I can't now, can I?<eos> I mean, they didn't say anything, but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel.<eos> Huh, so you can tell what that feels like.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Anyway, I figured I can hang out with my friends and have fun, too.<eos> Well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to Target for diapers, things are about to get nuts.<eos> Oh, it's just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around.<eos> Isn't that right, Halley?<eos> Well, at least someone had the courage to say it.<eos> Thank you, you are a good citizen.

- Oh, you see?<eos> You see?<eos> - Do it again.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> That's enough!<eos> [sobbing]<eos> Sir, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm having trouble understanding you.<eos> Did you say you wanted three burritos?

- Huh?<eos> Nurse, get me another scalpel!<eos> I'm not losing another child.<eos> Oh, we don't have a scalpel.<eos> Okay, so I'll see you soon, sir.<eos> Bye... bye now.<eos> What the [bleep], man?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I got caught up in the scenario.<eos> Who asked for you to make noises at all?

You're my...<eos> And by the way, I'm not a jock, Dad.<eos> I'm obviously a Znorver, but you wouldn't know that because you're never here!<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> [relaxing opera music playing] [sighs]<eos> This is bliss.<eos> So this guy, Jeff... he's the most important guy on the entire planet.<eos> - It's... it's very meaningful work.<eos> - Ooh.<eos> But that's what you get with me, a hardworking, high-profile, humble scientist...

Turn off the music.<eos> Okay, so the whole country's out of food.<eos> We just need... [gasps] I got it.<eos> Jerry, what's the best food in the world?<eos> Mexican food, ma'am, hands down. [laughs]<eos> Exactly.<eos> Get me Mexico.<eos> [laughing] Yeah, yeah, yeah?<eos> And then the guy turns to his friend, and he says, "Butthole?<eos> You damn near killed him!"
- [both laugh]<eos> Oh, Mr. President, I could do this all day, but look, the reason I'm calling is to put in a little order for some Mexican food.<eos> Uh, nothing crazy.<eos> Just, like, 6 million quesadillas.<eos> - What?<eos> - Uh, 12 million chicken tacos.<eos> Ooh, and what about Mexican pizzas?<eos> Hey, wait, wait.<eos> Uh, Ma...<eos> Madam President, uh, you can't just call me up and be like, uh,
- What?<eos> - Uh, 12 million chicken tacos.<eos> Ooh, and what about Mexican pizzas?<eos> Hey, wait, wait.<eos> Uh, Ma...<eos> Madam President, uh, you can't just call me up and be like, uh,<eos> "I am a fat American, and I want a billion tacos."<eos> Whoa!<eos> What?<eos> You're the one that was like,

No, no, no, I just need you to not screw up the punch line.<eos> You're like... [both blabbering indistinctly] [dramatic news music]<eos> My fellow Americans,<eos> I tried to speak reasonably with the Mexicans, but there is no reasoning with Nazis, so we're going to war, baby!<eos> [people cheering]<eos> Time to get those Nazis!<eos> Oh, [bleep].<eos> - [horn honks]<eos> - Come on, come on!<eos> What are you doing?
- [horn honks]<eos> - Come on, come on!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What is going on here?<eos> Why can't anybody drive?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> How the hell am I gonna get in there?<eos> Let's go live now to the U.N., where the Mexican and American ambassadors are trying to figure this [bleep] out, man.<eos> Well, the U.S. has been very aggressive...<eos> Not as bad as you!

Lewis said that?<eos> That piece of [bleep].<eos> Hey, Lewis!<eos> So, uh, on Earth, everybody carries a phone.<eos> And they use it all the time, for everything.<eos> - Like, they're always...<eos> - News flash, Dad!<eos> No one cares!<eos> - [sighs]<eos> - Now, now, Znarx, you shouldn't talk to your father that way, but, sweetie, maybe you could try to tell some more interesting stories, you know what I mean?
- Hello!<eos> - Ah, Zerk!<eos> Oh, hey, Zerk.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, let me feel those muscles.<eos> You've been working out, huh?<eos> Look at you!<eos> - Aw, man, I...<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> Didn't... didn't see you there, boss.<eos> Uh, you must be Jimmy.

Uh, you must be Jimmy.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Uh, this is Zerk.<eos> He's a new neighbor.<eos> He's been helping us out while you've been gone with, uh, repairs and stuff.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Like what kind of repairs?<eos> Well, I fixed the bathtub last week.<eos> Now two people can fit in it.<eos> Why would you need that?
- Yes.<eos> - Uh, this is Zerk.<eos> He's a new neighbor.<eos> He's been helping us out while you've been gone with, uh, repairs and stuff.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Like what kind of repairs?<eos> Well, I fixed the bathtub last week.<eos> Now two people can fit in it.<eos> Why would you need that?<eos> You know what?
- I'll see you soon. - [giggles] Yeah.<eos> [whimpers] [mellow guitar music]<eos> Mmm-mmm-mmm.<eos> Now, that's what I call a fruit salad.<eos> [groans] Guys, this is my vacation.<eos> You know, I always said if Sammy ever showed his weaselly little cheating, no-good, grifting ass around here again,<eos> I'd cut his little purple nipples off, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.<eos> [stammers] Wait.<eos> Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.<eos> Don't you see?

Ah!<eos> [bleep] you, mother[bleep].<eos> La-la-la-la-la-la-la!<eos> [bombs whistling through air, explosions]<eos> - Ay!<eos> Dios mio!<eos> - Boom!<eos> [laughs]<eos> Holy [bleep], that was awesome.<eos> Oh, you better serve up those quesadillas, mi amigo, or we're gonna nuke your faces off.

[groans]<eos> You think you know how to run the country better than me?
You think you know how to run the country better than me?<eos> - You think I'm a loser?<eos> - What?<eos> No, this isn't about... [groans]<eos> You want me to totally waste this guy, Madam President?<eos> Please say yes.<eos> Please say yes.<eos> No, I wanna beat the [bleep] out of this guy myself.<eos> - [grunts] - [groans]<eos> Don't you see?

Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> W-we don't want any trouble, now.<eos> You too, buddy.<eos> Listen.<eos> I've had a really rough couple days, okay?<eos> Just shut your mouth and... [screaming] [grunting] [grunts] [yells]<eos> Nobody [bleep] my wife, okay?<eos> Jeez, take it easy, buddy!<eos> You made your point!

[laughing] That was awesome!<eos> I didn't realize I had such a cool dad.<eos> Really?<eos> You think I'm cool?
I am so glad to be off that [bleep]-hole planet.<eos> What the...<eos> Looks like Jeff must have monkeyed around with the therapy machine.<eos> [beeping] [whooshing]<eos> Suck my [bleep], you [bleep]!<eos> [whooshing]<eos> Oh, my God, I am so sorry.<eos> I...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Who are you?
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.<eos> I...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Oh, [bleep].<eos> [panting]<eos> Ugh, smells like marijuana and... body odor in here.<eos> - Oh, I missed you guys so much.<eos> - Easy, buddy!<eos> And you were right.
Not sure.<eos> I'll let you know when I do.<eos> Captain, my research theorizes that rogue singularities can pass through realities move from universe to universe.<eos> Spock, what do the logs show?<eos> They are encrypted.<eos> But from what we've managed to decipher ...apparently the Defiant discovered this so-called "black hole" as it phased into our reality.<eos> The ship, however, is unable to complete its transfer.<eos> So she's stuck.<eos> Half here, half there.<eos> And you say she can manage warp 15?
And you say she can manage warp 15?<eos> According to the engineering logs her engines have been modified over a LONG period of time.<eos> But we just saw her a year ago.<eos> Time is not an absolute, captain.<eos> It is, as Einstein surmised, relative.<eos> In whatever space the Defiant has been time obviously moves more rapidly.<eos> But if the man we found was the only one alive on the ship, then who overhauled the engines?<eos> He insisted on seeing everyone.<eos> Scotty.<eos> Cap'n... is that really you?

That would never happen.<eos> I don't expect a hug.<eos> Is this really necessary?<eos> It is for now.<eos> Jim?<eos> Avi?<eos> Avi Samara?<eos> Ms. Samara arrived a few days ago.<eos> I'd given up hope of seeing you all of you... a long time ago.<eos> But you're HIM.
Avi?<eos> Avi Samara?<eos> Ms. Samara arrived a few days ago.<eos> I'd given up hope of seeing you all of you... a long time ago.<eos> But you're HIM.<eos> How?<eos> No clue.<eos> I thought I was abandoned.<eos> Nobody was abandoned...<eos> as you can see for yourself.
I was put in cryo most of that time.<eos> PUT in cryo?<eos> How could you be "put" in cryo?<eos> Bridge to Captain Kirk.<eos> Kirk here.<eos> Go ahead, Sulu.<eos> Captain, a Klingon vessel has just entered the system.<eos> Go to yellow alert.<eos> Spock.<eos> You and Scotty get to the nuclear electronics lab.
Close channel.<eos> Spock?<eos> Ms. Samara's hypothesis was correct.<eos> The Defiant is a precise duplicate of the vessel we previously encountered, as is the other James Kirk.<eos> He is, for all intents and purposes, real.<eos> Sir, we can't stay here too long.<eos> We're being bombarded by Hawking radiation.<eos> Kirk to Scott.<eos> Can we allocate more power to the shield grid?<eos> Aye, but I found something I think you should see.
I... will... not...<eos> Please tell me he's not dead.<eos> No, just a bad headache.<eos> A Trojan horse program!<eos> You never intended to send him back.<eos> How long before the Defiant's auto-diagnostic restarts the computer?<eos> Usually about an hour.<eos> Uhura, all senior officers to the briefing room.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> You too, Samara.
So that's how we discovered distant islands like Australia.<eos> And what makes it particularly interesting wasn't just that they crossed quite a lot of open ocean, but they were doing it without any certainty that there was anything on the other side.<eos> And that the indigenous people, the aborigines, they were doing it thousands of years before people were supposed to be undertaking those kinds of trips.<eos> Why people would take that kind of risk is something I just cannot imagine.<eos> The power of human curiosity is simply a wonder.<eos> Most of us, if unleashed into the arid desert of Australia, would die within a few hours. And so the people who walked in had to work out how to exploit the local plants and animals, how to seek shelter, how to make the instruments they could use to kill animals.<eos> We've occupied nearly every habitat on Earth.<eos> We're an extraordinarily successful species.<eos> Humans are what are known as a supertramp species because we can adapt at the cultural level.<eos> Humans, in general, they're very well-suited for this planet Earth, and when you launch them into space, there are automatically changes that start happening to your biochemistry in your body.
Ah.<eos> Do you understand there's no way we can distribute this amount?<eos> I do.<eos> And do you understand that if we don't get that first payment, a fleet of El Santo's hit men are gonna be on the next flight to Dallas.<eos> El Santo gave us no choice.<eos> I don't remember asking you a damn thing.<eos> He said take a metric ton or nothing.<eos> I understand it put us in danger.<eos> So why'd you do it?<eos> Because now you have a choice.
It was a gamble.<eos> I made it alone.<eos> Well done, Teresa.<eos> Gonna need a word with you, James.<eos> Why is he still alive?<eos> He saved my life when he didn't have to.<eos> Teresa made a direct connection with El Santo.<eos> We take out our man, we risk losing our only supplier.<eos> You're making judgment calls now?<eos> Teresa makes 'em, you pat her on the back.

We got work to do.<eos> Epifanio.<eos> Isabela received a necklace with El Santo's logo on it.<eos> Now, she has no clue what it is, but we do.<eos> Why is El Santo threatening our daughter, Camila?<eos> El Santo's my new supplier now.<eos> I have a payment due to him in a week, so I guess the necklace is a reminder.<eos> _<eos> You went into business with this religious lunatic?<eos> You destroyed everyone I did business with then left me nearly with nothing.
_<eos> You went into business with this religious lunatic?<eos> You destroyed everyone I did business with then left me nearly with nothing.<eos> You really think I was not going to rebuild?<eos> She's our child, Camila.<eos> Listen, how much is the payment to this man?<eos> $3 million.<eos> Listen, I'm gonna get the cash to cover your first payment.<eos> Then I'm gonna take the coke you got from them, move it myself, and pay off that psychotic zealot.<eos> And you are finished in this business forever.

Don't let those bad guys get you.<eos> I won't.<eos> Bye, Teresa.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Salud.<eos> This is probably the best thing I've ever tasted in my life.<eos> Well, at $2,000 a bottle, it should be.<eos> _<eos> I remember that first time Epifanio and I could afford a bottle like this.<eos> You think it's a better drink.
No adulterants, incredible euphoria, absolutely no come down.<eos> - They can't get product because we blew up Epifanio's tunnel.<eos> Good.<eos> I've set up a meeting with a man that controls the largest region in the Southwest.<eos> Ki-Moon Kim.<eos> He distributes northern Arizona to Houston.<eos> 400 kilos a week.<eos> He looks like a kindly grandfather, but don't let that fool you.<eos> He came up in the Korean mob, deadly and ruthless.<eos> This is how you turn $1 million a month into $5 million a week, if we succeed.
He came up in the Korean mob, deadly and ruthless.<eos> This is how you turn $1 million a month into $5 million a week, if we succeed.<eos> And Teresa... we will succeed.<eos> I need 3 million cash, and I need it immediately.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> This is your father.<eos> Does she think that I don't know she's with that pinche Kique Jimenez?<eos> You have more pressing family issues.
Do what you gotta do to stop Camila's business.<eos> But don't touch my wife.<eos> Is that understood?<eos> Claro, compa.<eos> Claro.<eos> _<eos> She is respectful.<eos> She is.<eos> So the merchandise is of the highest quality, Mr. Kim.<eos> And unlike Epifanio's product, it can be delivered to you today.
Claro.<eos> _<eos> She is respectful.<eos> She is.<eos> So the merchandise is of the highest quality, Mr. Kim.<eos> And unlike Epifanio's product, it can be delivered to you today.<eos> I was assured that Epifanio's delivery issue will resolve itself shortly.<eos> No, his delay's costing you millions of dollars.<eos> And he's charging you 30,000 a kilo.<eos> You can get ours today at 25,000.
You'd be getting a better product for half a million dollars less.<eos> And at what price does loyalty become for sale?<eos> All this talk about money.<eos> I apologize profusely.<eos> Teresa's young.<eos> I have high hopes for her.<eos> It's difficult to teach this business to those whom you love.<eos> My own son, Ki-Wan...<eos> My wife and I worry.<eos> Well, you're fortunate to have the relationship you have with your son.

If Camila knew I let a snitch watch her stash, she'd kill us both.<eos> Take the truck out front.<eos> Watch yourself.<eos> Will do.<eos> After the little stunt Epifanio pulled on us,<eos> I need to send a message.<eos> Well, I'll do what I can, but I don't usually handle divorce settlements.<eos> Well, I don't trust anybody else digging about my business.<eos> Can I count on you to protect my interests?<eos> That you can.
Well, I'll do what I can, but I don't usually handle divorce settlements.<eos> Well, I don't trust anybody else digging about my business.<eos> Can I count on you to protect my interests?<eos> That you can.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Can we continue this later?<eos> - Same room, same time? - I'll be there.<eos> Not to talk business, though.<eos> Devon, thank you so much for coming.<eos> From here on out, you'll be reporting to me.
It makes your cellular and data web communications untraceable.<eos> So you can talk all your crazy gangster shit with your crazy gangster friends, and motherfreaking Columbo could be right outside your door.<eos> He'd be like, "Listen to them nice boys talking about they moms and shit."<eos> - Nice.<eos> - I also got some primo police scanners on.<eos> Little bit of everything.<eos> Just depends on what you're looking for.<eos> All right, yeah, man.<eos> Um, yeah, gimme four of these - and six of the scanners.<eos> - You a wise man, dude. You a wise man.
Uh, P.S., got a little side hustle if you hungry.<eos> Got a little white girl burning a hole in my pocket looking for a party, man.<eos> Thanks, man. I think we're good on coke.<eos> Shit.<eos> Alpha 33 to five, I need all additional units to Hickory and Pearl Stone. Fugitive fleeing on foot.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, how's my favorite executive consultant?<eos> This is Kelly Anne Van Auken.<eos> We met at the benefit party a while back. Yeah, hi.<eos> How are you? Oh, ha.
I'm supposed to meet her at the gallery right now.<eos> We'll deal with it.<eos> There's no dealing with Camila, you know that.<eos> You need to leave Dallas.<eos> Teresa, listen to me.<eos> We went to Bolivia.<eos> You got her a new supplier with my connect, all right?<eos> Camila, she might be cruel, but she's a businesswoman first.<eos> She needs us, and she knows that.<eos> But the DEA... you're a fugitive.
I married your mother.<eos> And for the first time since I lost my parents, I didn't feel alone.<eos> I took over the farm.<eos> And when the Crocodile came around to collect his money, I had to beg for the life of my family.<eos> The only reason he spared them was because I agreed to grow marijuana on our farm.<eos> Whatever happened to the Crocodile?<eos> The Federales ran him out of the country.<eos> I got into this life so you wouldn't have to come home and see your mother and father hanging from a tree.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> You do.

_<eos> _<eos> We still have Camila to deal with.<eos> I have a call into the U.S. Attorney.<eos> We'll let the DEA handle her.<eos> I spoke with General Macintosh...<eos> our Drug Czar... and, well, he isn't sure how the U.S. will benefit from a joint Texas-Sinaloa task force.<eos> Well, I'm sure he's aware of the successful strikes I've ordered against the cartel in my state.<eos> He is.<eos> And he's also aware of the rumors swirling around you and your own involvement in the cartel.
We have a common problem.<eos> And I'm offering you a solution.<eos> Think it over.<eos> In a series of gangland killings, the brutality and carnage of which authorities are saying is unprecedented in the Dallas area.<eos> the following images are very graphic.<eos> Ki-Moon Kim... the owner of the Golden Palace Hotel... and four of his associates were found brutally murdered. Both local...<eos> Epifanio did this.<eos> And then he tried to have us killed.<eos> I never thought it would come to this.<eos> You saved my life.
So...<eos> let Guero live.<eos> $3 million, courtesy of Epifanio Vargas for our payment to El Santo.<eos> Epifanio's gonna be contacting you to arrange the pick-up of the coke.<eos> That should be an enjoyable phone call.<eos> I'm gonna need a minute.<eos> Come on.<eos> Denny's contact at the Dallas P.D. said he was almost caught today.<eos> So the cops know he's in town.<eos> You were right.
I'm gonna need a minute.<eos> Come on.<eos> Denny's contact at the Dallas P.D. said he was almost caught today.<eos> So the cops know he's in town.<eos> You were right.<eos> I should've taken care of it in Bolivia.<eos> He can't stay here.<eos> I'm not ready to make that decision yet.<eos> We first have to move the product.<eos> You're not giving it to Epifanio.

I just wanted you to know that we ain't perfect.<eos> There's a lot of skeletons in these walk-in closets.<eos> What's yours?<eos> My skeleton?<eos> How much time do you have?<eos> I think your boss, Camila, is sleeping with my husband.<eos> So that's why you asked me here?<eos> I know the position that puts you in.<eos> She's your boss.<eos> But I hope, as a woman, you understand the position that puts me in.
We have a meeting with a potential distributor.<eos> You need to look presentable.<eos> Here.<eos> What did Cole's wife have to say?<eos> Nothing, some boring stuff about wine and yogurt.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> Guero needs to leave Dallas as soon as possible.<eos> We're letting him live, as long as he goes away.<eos> I understand.<eos> And I understand you love him, but I'm not gonna allow matters of the heart to risk my business.
We're letting him live, as long as he goes away.<eos> I understand.<eos> And I understand you love him, but I'm not gonna allow matters of the heart to risk my business.<eos> Epifanio, hello.<eos> I trust you have received the money I sent for your payment.<eos> We need to make arrangements for me to pick up El Santo's product.<eos> Yes, thank you so much for the payment.<eos> But I'm not shutting down.<eos> If you want your metric ton, you're welcome to come and pry it from my cold, dead hands.<eos> You'll see what I'm capable of when the safety of our daughter is at stake.
I know what it's like for a family to live in fear of a madman.<eos> I'm not afraid of crocodiles.<eos> And I'm not afraid of you.<eos> I choose war.<eos> Or did you forget that?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry El Santo threatened your daughter.<eos> Don't be.<eos> She was never at any risk.<eos> You sent her the charm.
Bristol dropped by 16, check on that pharma short with Stu.<eos> $250,000 buy me a hello but not a meeting.<eos> If you're looking to invest, I'm afraid my broker days are over.<eos> But I can refer some people.<eos> Stock is not a stable commodity.<eos> But I believe a private jet company is.<eos> My company's not for sale, and I'm not looking for a partner.<eos> If you're looking to buy in aviation, I'd suggest Delta.<eos> Does Delta fly to Bolivia?<eos> Because I have about 30 million reasons why you should.
Previously on Queen of the South...<eos> You're not going with your father.
You're not going with your father.<eos> I don't want to be with you!<eos> How many have we lost?<eos> All of them.<eos> Camila needs product.<eos> Entonces vamos a hacer un trato.<eos> About those funds you requested, I think I may have a work-around.<eos> Teo was a risk to both of us.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You left me.
Let's stay in bed all day.<eos> This is Marbella, in la Costa del Sol de Espana.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> You ever been?<eos> Yeah, I flew a little hash there once from Morocco.<eos> Never stopped thinking about this place.<eos> Let's go right now.<eos> Screw Epifanio.<eos> Screw Epifanio.<eos> You know how to fly. Let's go.
I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Stay.<eos> I can't.<eos> Hey, Chino, we gotta move that coke fast, man.<eos> You done cutting it yet?<eos> Okay.<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out the plane.<eos> Who the hell are you?
You done cutting it yet?<eos> Okay.<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out the plane.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Move!<eos> Si­?<eos> You don't know me, Teresa.
Get in the car.<eos> Move!<eos> Si­?<eos> You don't know me, Teresa.<eos> Guero's dead.<eos> Get out of the house now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She must be really special.<eos> She is.<eos> Epifanio blew up your plane because you were stealing from him. Yep.
We followed him.<eos> In my experience, men are the weaker sex when it comes to matters of the heart.<eos> What do you want?<eos> For you to cooperate in our investigation of Camila Vargas.<eos> Miss Mendoza, I know you're a good person in a bad situation.<eos> And you're going to save me?<eos> Camila Vargas is a cold-blooded criminal who uses loyalty as her currency.<eos> Only way out is with a bullet.<eos> It won't even be her that pulls the trigger.<eos> I'd wager you've already got blood on your hands for her.
United States government will keep you safe and sound.<eos> Like you did in Culiacan?<eos> If we didn't have surveillance on Epifanio Vargas, your boyfriend would have been blown to pieces.<eos> The fact is, the DEA doesn't have anything concrete on you.<eos> But my buddies over at ICE would love to toss your illegal ass back to Mexico.<eos> I wonder how long it'd take Epifanio to find you.<eos> I'd give you 48 hours.<eos> Understand this:<eos> those people are not your friends.<eos> And you can't afford any more enemies.

But one thing's for certain, we cannot allow them to reach Texas.<eos> If we cut off their transport route, his distributors will come crawling back to us.<eos> We just need to confirm that his tunnel's active.<eos> Well, if it is, destroy it.<eos> Take Teresa with you to the border.<eos> Why?<eos> Leave me in the kitchen like a pinche vieja?<eos> I'll go instead of her...<eos> I need all my security at hand for protection.<eos> Teresa, you'll be less conspicuous with James.
We got a long drive ahead of us.<eos> We should get moving.<eos> Thank you, Pote.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I'll start tomorrow.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> If the tunnel is still active, it'll be surrounded by Epifanio's men.<eos> You know he still wants to kill me.<eos> You escaped my husband's wrath since you fled Culiacan.<eos> I have no doubt your wits will keep you safe once more.
And if they don't?<eos> We lost everything and everyone that meant anything to us.<eos> You mustn't question your value.<eos> We only have each other now.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> And, Teresa, acuerdate,<eos> We're the same. Never forget that.<eos> Reynaldo,<eos> and we have done very well together.<eos> And you keep getting more and more handsome, and I just get older and fatter.
Reynaldo,<eos> and we have done very well together.<eos> And you keep getting more and more handsome, and I just get older and fatter.<eos> You look as strong as ever.<eos> Tell that to my wife.<eos> She took me off meat.<eos> I can't have salt. I can't have sugar.<eos> If she cuts me off the cerveza, I'm not gonna have a reason to wake up in the morning.<eos> I know about wives trying to take things away.<eos> I have you beat, my friend.
I gotta look respectable.<eos> I'm a daughter of a governor now.<eos> Bela, I know you are excited about the birthday, but<eos> I'm in a business meeting.<eos> Hello, Olivia.<eos> Happy birthday, mi'ja.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love it.<eos> Mm. Only the best for you, but, please, keep the music down, okay?<eos> Does he think you're having tea with the Queen of England?
Border Patrol, militiamen, coyotes, real coyotes.<eos> There it is.<eos> It looks deserted.<eos> Tunnel?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's under the van.<eos> Is it active?<eos> There's only one way to find out.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll wait for you here.
No, come.<eos> Alto.<eos> They're not just cartel guys.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> That search, it's sharp and efficient.<eos> And their weapons are military issue.<eos> Epifanio has the Mexican army working for him.<eos> Shh. Keep your voice down.<eos> Just take deep breaths.<eos> You're gonna be okay.
Well, I don't mean to speak ill of the dead, but Teo was screwing the help.<eos> Jailbait, no less.<eos> Tell you that himself?<eos> Teo asked for my advice.<eos> I told him get his house in order.<eos> That boy was a hot mess.<eos> I mean, I'm not surprised that he decided it was time to meet his maker.<eos> What can you tell us about his work for Camila Vargas?<eos> Well, I was concerned, given Teo's lack of judgment and Epifanio Vargas' reputation, that something may have been done to jeopardize my firm.<eos> By "something," you mean one of your attorneys facilitating the sale and distribution of illegal substances?

But in light of Teo's passing, I'd like to be transparent with your agency.<eos> Here are the files for your review.<eos> Ready to roll.<eos> Like you read my mind.<eos> Well, if there's nothing else, I have a meeting in five.<eos> Sir,<eos> I appreciate your help. Anything for the government.<eos> Oh, damn it.<eos> Still no service.<eos> You should just leave me behind and get back to the truck.
Drop your weapon!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Put the gun down!<eos> Hands behind your head!<eos> Where's the girl who was with you?<eos> What girl?<eos> Hey. Wake up, asshole.<eos> David Lee Autrey?<eos> My ass.<eos> You're just some pinche puto.
Put the gun down!<eos> Hands behind your head!<eos> Where's the girl who was with you?<eos> What girl?<eos> Hey. Wake up, asshole.<eos> David Lee Autrey?<eos> My ass.<eos> You're just some pinche puto.<eos> Is that what they call you down in Mexico?<eos> Who the hell are you?
What happened to you there?<eos> Oh. Nasty bite.<eos> Main road's just up ahead.<eos> Let me get you to a hospital.<eos> I'm so tired.<eos> Like I said, you're a good person in a bad situation.<eos> Come with me, this all ends.<eos> Take my hand.<eos> Snakes eat rats.<eos> Only you can save yourself.
We'd have to get bigger drones.<eos> If they can work as spies, they can also work as mules.<eos> An inspired idea.<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> Bueno?<eos> Gracias, Comandante.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> It appears we have a breach at the tunnel.<eos> Why are you still standing here? Go.<eos> You were in the service, right?
What's wrong?<eos> It appears we have a breach at the tunnel.<eos> Why are you still standing here? Go.<eos> You were in the service, right?<eos> 27th Engineer Battalion out of Fort Bragg.<eos> I was 1st Cav.<eos> Help a soldier out and untie me.<eos> I'm a US citizen and a vet.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> You're a coyote.

Please?<eos> You looking for your coyote?<eos> That's enough, Pete.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Let's just get her to the tent. Anything happens to this woman in our camp, the Feds will shut us down for good.<eos> Stand down.<eos> That's a serious mustache.<eos> He's very intimidating.<eos> I choose to surround myself with strong people.<eos> Hm. You backed down the DEA.

You're one of the richest men in Texas.
When you're up and walking, I'm gonna have to call Border Patrol, turn you in to custody.<eos> You started this group to protect your county?<eos> Something like that.<eos> We have a common enemy.<eos> That's hard to believe, honey.<eos> I used to work for a cartel.<eos> They forced me to be a mule.<eos> When I tried to escape, they killed my entire family.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> You got my attention.
Go on.<eos> There's a tunnel at the border.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> We were doing surveillance.<eos> I can take you there right now.<eos> You can tell the Border Patrol all about the tunnel.<eos> You know the cartels control everyone, even the Border Patrol.<eos> There's another way.<eos> This whole country's getting soft.<eos> You can barely touch a girl without some feminazi whining about harassment.

Back off!<eos> Cut him loose.<eos> Now.<eos> What's going on, Carl?<eos> Cut him loose right now.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Back off, back off.<eos> Just cool it.<eos> Move it!<eos> Are you okay?
Cut him loose.<eos> Now.<eos> What's going on, Carl?<eos> Cut him loose right now.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Back off, back off.<eos> Just cool it.<eos> Move it!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I thought I told you to go.
I thought I told you to go.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> Come on.<eos> How the hell did you find me?<eos> Followed the tire tracks.<eos> You needed an army?<eos> I got us one.<eos> The tunnel is under the van on the left.<eos> Damn.<eos> You weren't lying.
I got us one.<eos> The tunnel is under the van on the left.<eos> Damn.<eos> You weren't lying.<eos> Coke comes from Mexico through the tunnel and then the vans take it to Dallas.<eos> God damn.<eos> Not gonna happen today.<eos> If you're thinking what I'm thinking, darling, I love the way you think.<eos> Let's blow up the tunnel.<eos> You need papers?
Just don't make a decision about the DEA till we talk, okay? Please?<eos> I love you.<eos> How's the leg?<eos> I'll survive.<eos> Good.<eos> Carl gave me his number.<eos> Should I call him?<eos> Eh. I'd hold off.<eos> Play hard to get.<eos> Look, you shouldn't have come back for me. It was stupid.
The tunnel's gone.<eos> An explosion.<eos> We lost three men.<eos> I don't care about your men.<eos> Who did it?<eos> We captured this image off of one of the surveillance drones.<eos> Teresa.<eos> That's unacceptable.<eos> They are making me look like a fool.<eos> You assured me that Don Reynaldo's product would be protected.

Now, go and fix your mess.<eos> Please.<eos> Bela, you look wonderful.<eos> That dress and those shoes, aren't they a little too grown-up?<eos> Mom sent me the shoes and I love them.<eos> More than the pearls?<eos> I love the pearls.<eos> This isn't a competition, papi.<eos> Okay. A toast to my daughter!<eos> I love you more than life itself.
This car is a symbol of my trust.<eos> I'm giving you your freedom.<eos> Don't make me regret it.<eos> I checked the car for GPS trackers.<eos> It's clean, for now.<eos> There's an old saying.<eos> The fish only sees the bait, never the hook.<eos> I know you lied to me about your car overheating, Teresita.<eos> Whatever you're hiding better be worth it.<eos> Wasn't quite sure if you'd show.
I bet him you'd never say yes.<eos> You seem to be feeling better, Felix.<eos> I am. I am.<eos> But I can't stay long.<eos> I'm supposed to come to my boss with an emergency so he can leave in 20 minutes.<eos> Leave Felix to me.<eos> Now is the only time I have with you two.<eos> I'm not letting you out of my sight.<eos> Hello.<eos> You again.
Nevertheless, I've been greatly inconvenienced.<eos> Now, if the secretary of state were to put in a word on my behalf, I'm sure DOD would shake loose a jet.<eos> And then I might be inclined to help you with your request.<eos> So... if I call DOD, you will pass the emergency waiver?<eos> I'll put your waiver up for a vote this morning.<eos> I'm sure it will pass with bipartisan support.<eos> We all like to help out when we can.<eos> Don't we?<eos> You know, I-I'm just curious.<eos> Where are you going on your fact-finding trip?
Pirosmani makes a huge effort to stay out of our crosshairs.<eos> Who knows?<eos> He might welcome the opportunity to have us in his debt.<eos> And, as my mother always said, no harm in asking.<eos> Let's reach out to any foreign officials who might have a way to contact him.<eos> We're doing this.<eos> Mr. Brennan, hi.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Madam Secretary.<eos> Last time you contracted with Vesuvian, you dealt with my former partner, Isaac Bishop.

This e-mail from Rafferty is the most important thing on her mind right now, trust me.<eos> I sincerely doubt that, but okay.<eos> I actually made sure she won't flake.<eos> How'd you do that?<eos> So in exchange for your help, the CIA would immediately shelve its undercover investigation into your business dealings.<eos> Jay, what was it called?<eos> Operation Top Gun.<eos> I am willing to speak with friends in the Somali Independence Front and the Revolutionary Army of Somalia, make them to stop fighting and release the American aid person.<eos> Excellent.<eos> It's, all well and good, but... how you say... hypothetically, it'll cause loss to business for me.
Hypothetically.<eos> I am a legitimate businessman with interests all over world.<eos> I must have compensation.<eos> Yes, but as I already explained,<eos> I can't pay you cash.<eos> It... could be considered illegal.<eos> That is the second time you use this word, "illegal."<eos> I think we're done here.<eos> Better luck next time catching Dito.<eos> You know, Mr. Pirosmani, back in the States, we have a word for what you are, and it isn't "businessman."
Yes, but as I already explained,<eos> I can't pay you cash.<eos> It... could be considered illegal.<eos> That is the second time you use this word, "illegal."<eos> I think we're done here.<eos> Better luck next time catching Dito.<eos> You know, Mr. Pirosmani, back in the States, we have a word for what you are, and it isn't "businessman."<eos> It's "omnipreneur."<eos> It's like entrepreneur, only global.<eos> You go where the action is.
- That's all right.<eos> You were saying you had a proposal for me.<eos> Call it a gesture of good faith.<eos> A 360-foot mega-yacht.<eos> Christened the Frisky Business, it boasts...<eos> It's the most bang for a buck.<eos> Two helipads, three swimming pools.<eos> And a submarine that doubles as an escape pod.<eos> I know.<eos> So in exchange for helping us, you want...?
Sure.<eos> It's a little bit colder than I expected.<eos> It's windy, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Garçon?<eos> Un autre café, s'il vous plaît.<eos> Oui, Monsieur.<eos> Merci.<eos> So, enjoying the Riviera?<eos> Oh, you know, these conferences.
Not at the moment, ma'am, no.<eos> There's a bit of a problem.<eos> What?<eos> How?<eos> You should never have betrayed me.<eos> Who is this?<eos> I was your friend.<eos> Now I am your enemy.<eos> Dito, what's this about?<eos> You have till end of business tomorrow to release my assets.
_<eos> Tell Mr. Soroka his private account in Cape Verde, where we know Dito Pirosmani does business... that was our first clue.<eos> Would he like to hear a list of the payments he's received over the last 18 months?<eos> Your boss say to me,<eos> "Help save starving Africans."<eos> I'm undone by my own heart!<eos> Mr. Pirosmani, my boss did not screw you.<eos> Oh, no?<eos> I help her, she takes my money and hunts me like an animal.<eos> 'Cause you put stolen M16 rifles in the hands of terrorists.
She wants to hear you.<eos> I'm here, ma'am.<eos> Dito, let me be clear.<eos> This is not a negotiation.<eos> Then I waste my time.<eos> You have an American hostage.<eos> There are consequences to that.<eos> We cannot unfreeze your assets.<eos> But you took my money for something that I didn't do.<eos> Based on your known criminal history and a great deal of evidence, yes; however, we have new evidence that seems to show that you did not steal U.S. military weapons.
But the key in this Transportation revolution. Of course is the Combustion engine, Horsepower of Our own creation.<eos> The engine changes everything.<eos> From the moment the first Automobile was revealed. To the world, everyone wanted To get behind the wheel and go.<eos> In that moment, all We needed was roads.<eos> Nebraska, 1919.<eos> A u.S. Army convoy Reaches the halfway point. Of an epic mission.<eos> In 1919, the Us army actually sent.<eos> A convoy from washington D.C. To san francisco, A fleet of 81 vehicles because They just wanted to see. How difficult it would Be to move that many trucks.<eos> There's Just no infrastructure.<eos> There's also the lack of the Support system around it, So you don't have the garages, The gas stations that you need, So they're moving at This incredibly slow pace.
Run!<eos> So, yes.<eos> I haven't been completely honest.<eos> The police did find evidence of what happened to belle.<eos> I just wanted to save you and Gideon the heartbreak.<eos> Well...<eos> She wanted to see the world.<eos> Just not with you, it would appear.<eos> Look, I must be frank with you, for your sake as well as Gideon's.<eos> You're the one that caused him all this pain, not belle.
She'd tell you that she shed her dark past when she moved to this country, but it never went away.<eos> You're hustling me, aren't you?<eos> - Nobody hustles like a lawyer.<eos> - Mnh-mnh. Just because I'm better at pool than you thought I'd be doesn't mean that I'm playing dirty.<eos> Rematch?<eos> No. I have to get back to reading the intel report.<eos> What intel report?<eos> About the cache?<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, I've never worked with Nimah before, just read her file, like you.
And what's the other name for it...<eos> The Farm? The CIA is up to something, and either you can tell me what it is or you can read my column online tomorrow.<eos> It's all about how dapper you and your fellow Agency operatives looked at the Gregory Investment Partners party.<eos> Well, now you're fishing.<eos> You got nothing.<eos> Henry Gould...<eos> long time. Our mutual friend in St. Petersburg tells me you have a job for us.<eos> Uh, well, I don't, but my associate, Reema Sethi, here<eos> - does, actually. - Hello.<eos> You look familiar.
Try Special Agent.<eos> And I will have your badge for breakfast if you don't let this EPA worker go back to doing her job right this second.<eos> - I'm sorry. I'm just doing my job.<eos> - Your job?<eos> Your job is to help the citizens of this town get back into their homes.<eos> That's our job, too. Yes, of course.<eos> Uh, here are your credentials.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Shelby and I are en route.<eos> Who are you, and why do these private contractors want to kill you? My name is Malory Haynes.
How many days you get?<eos> - Four.<eos> - Respect.<eos> Hey, remember when we drove that old Buick Skylark from Denver to Salt Lake with nothing in the tank?<eos> Well, to be fair, we were going down a mountain.<eos> Mountain my ass, it was a miracle.<eos> Adam's phone.<eos> Danielle.<eos> Could I please speak with Adam on Adam's phone?<eos> Oh, Adam was right, you really are a hoot.
If you're looking for your drink, I moved it over there.<eos> How thoughtful.<eos> Oh, I see we lost Adam.<eos> Yeah, opiates and alcohol will do that to a person.<eos> Not me or Keith Richards, but we're gifted that way.<eos> You can run along now, I'll put him to bed.<eos> No, I promised him I'd stay and I would never break a promise.<eos> Unless it was a marriage vow.<eos> - So that's how you're gonna play it?<eos> - I'll play it any way you want.
- You have enough pillows?<eos> - Yep. - You love me?<eos> - I do.<eos> Then why am I not your emergency contact? !<eos> Okay, Danielle, here's the deal.<eos> I'm going to hire someone to take care of Adam.<eos> Ideally, a large Filipino man.<eos> Are you really so threatened that you'd rather have a stranger tending to him?<eos> I'm not threatened.<eos> You're threatened.
That their murders should go unsolved?<eos> Is that what you're saying, officer Winchell? Hmm?<eos> You're messing with me, right?<eos> No, I ain't messing with you.<eos> It was a pleasure to meet you, officer Winchell.<eos> Special agent Julian Gale.<eos> Now I'm gonna need some space.<eos> Everybody!<eos> I want this site cleared.<eos> Yes, you.
My ma had dementia before the cancer got her.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> It's a terrible, terrible thing.<eos> The whole family's been frantic since she disappeared.<eos> She was okay last I saw her.<eos> Yes?<eos> Where was that, exactly?<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> I'd like to enquire about one of your previous guests.<eos> And you are?
One who understands and appreciates the importance of strong family bonds and the critical role these milestones play in forging them.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> It's the small things.<eos> Mmm?<eos> Like bricks in a fortress.<eos> And well worth defending, by the way.<eos> Or hiring someone to defend.<eos> Like, ah, Philomena, for instance.<eos> Can you give us a moment?<eos> Who the hell are you?
Yes, of course.<eos> It's the small things.<eos> Mmm?<eos> Like bricks in a fortress.<eos> And well worth defending, by the way.<eos> Or hiring someone to defend.<eos> Like, ah, Philomena, for instance.<eos> Can you give us a moment?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> You engaged Philomena to compromise a certain tennis instructor at the town and country racquet club who was carrying on a long-term fervid affair with your wife, thereby preserving your marriage for this happy occasion.
Hello?<eos> Bronwyn? It's just...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> My husband, um...<eos> - My ex-husband.<eos> - I...<eos> I left him and we're in a custody battle.<eos> He's trying to steal my little girl.<eos> And if he found out that I caused an accident...<eos> Honey. You were on a bicycle.
But I need to talk to you, just for a minute.<eos> How did you know where I work?<eos> You were wearing the shirt when I hit you.<eos> Listen.<eos> I know how hard it is to be a young working mother.<eos> No, this is just temporary.<eos> I mean, I... you know, to show the courts that I have a stable job.<eos> I'm gonna go back to school.<eos> My point exactly.<eos> To be doing all that alone, and fighting a spiteful husband in court, you need help.
A whole life waiting.<eos> What do you have now, Marvin?<eos> Alone, on the run, until you die?<eos> Unless you help yourself.<eos> I'm not turning state's evidence against him, no way.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that, Marvin.<eos> I'm so honored that you could meet me here.<eos> Just to be considered for this...<eos> Katai fellowships are designed to groom members of law enforcement to become policy leaders on a broader scale.<eos> Now, you've written extensively about islamophobia in law enforcement.
You ever think about government work?<eos> I have a feeling I'm about to do some for you.<eos> So your last event with the Secret Service was two years ago?<eos> How does one of America's heroes wind up doing protective detail for the First Family?<eos> I decided to pursue a life that was a little less, um, involved.<eos> Aren't you bored?<eos> That wasn't a real question. You're bored.<eos> I can tell.<eos> I speak eight languages, three of them well, and number one is body language.<eos> You have to be able to tell from across the room if it's working, and you are not comfortable here.

As long as I have breath in my body, I will strike you down!<eos> Long live the glory of Aku!<eos> You are very troubled.<eos> And very confused.<eos> Aku is the evil one, not me.<eos> I've met machines that are programmed with such hate and lies, but never a human.<eos> Deceiver!<eos> Worm!<eos> Scum!<eos> Now you're just repeating yourself.
Aku is the evil one, not me.<eos> I've met machines that are programmed with such hate and lies, but never a human.<eos> Deceiver!<eos> Worm!<eos> Scum!<eos> Now you're just repeating yourself.<eos> I wonder if it is possible for her to ever believe - that Aku is the evil and not me?<eos> - Lecherous snake!<eos> Mm, perhaps not.<eos> Are you kidding me?
I wonder if it is possible for her to ever believe - that Aku is the evil and not me?<eos> - Lecherous snake!<eos> Mm, perhaps not.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Whew.<eos> My Lord and master, Aku, may it please you for all eternity ... the samurai is dead.<eos> Um...<eos> I'm right here. Fool!<eos> We've been swallowed by a monolithic creature.<eos> You're dead.
I'm right here. Fool!<eos> We've been swallowed by a monolithic creature.<eos> You're dead.<eos> I've been inside giant creatures before.<eos> I'll find a way out.<eos> Stop.<eos> Enough! No!<eos> I will never stop!<eos> Yes, yes, I know ... till your dying breath.<eos> But once you see how misguided you are, you will see the truth about Aku.
Can you not see that I am saving your life?<eos> Aaaaaagh!<eos> Uh, hello?<eos> Ashi?<eos> Ashi? Ashi? Kill the samurai!<eos> Jack?<eos> What are we doing, Jack?<eos> Waiting.<eos> Waiting for what?<eos> You know the way out.
Ashi? Ashi? Kill the samurai!<eos> Jack?<eos> What are we doing, Jack?<eos> Waiting.<eos> Waiting for what?<eos> You know the way out.<eos> Let's just go. No.<eos> She's another innocent.<eos> "Innocent"?<eos> Are you mad?

- She's gone.<eos> - What?<eos> Okay, well, that's that.<eos> Lets get out of here.<eos> No.<eos> Ugh, you're going to save her life again, aren't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I'd be happier as that creature's excrement than be grateful to you.<eos> What did you expect, a hug and a kiss?

Al?<eos> Nicole Silver.<eos> You've been following her for two weeks.<eos> The last I checked, taking pictures wasn't a crime.<eos> Aggravated sexual assault...<eos> last time I checked, that's a Class 1 felony.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's sad news.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> We've got witnesses saying that you were stalking her.
It was... it must have been later.<eos> We were... we were in the car.<eos> I was waking up.<eos> I was sick.<eos> There were sparks in the sky.<eos> They were coming from the train.<eos> Denise was screaming.<eos> That's what woke me up.<eos> She was screaming, and she was pulling me from the car.<eos> Okay, so you and Denise...
I mean, this whole "consent" thing is a mystery to me.<eos> I mean, how do you tell if a woman's just pretending to resist?<eos> You're asking as a cop?<eos> No.<eos> Man to man.<eos> Well, if that's all you're interested in, stick around for the seminar.<eos> I'll comp you.<eos> I can tell that you're intrigued.<eos> But even for an expert like you, the line's got to get fuzzy.<eos> You were accused of rape last year.

She'll tell you.<eos> All I did was drive her home.<eos> You sure you drove her home?<eos> We were gonna drop them off at the L, but she... she jumped out of the car.<eos> Do you have any idea why?<eos> You'll have to ask her.<eos> Yeah, we can't ask Denise Miranda, because she died this morning.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She had a really bad reaction to that kamikaze you gave her, and after she escaped your car, she froze to death, so you're not just an accessory to a rape.
I will.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Mom?<eos> - Hi.<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> Knew I'd see you again.<eos> We arrested two of your disciples for sexual assault.<eos> Wow. That's horrible.<eos> But that has nothing to do with me.<eos> You teach men how to rape.
Please make me stop talking.<eos> Come and sit down with us.<eos> Yeah, come on.<eos> Let's chat.<eos> So, you like Rick and Morty, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got into it because of my son, but now I love it, too.<eos> Wubba-lubba-dub-dub.<eos> What's happening?<eos> And when I close this door, you will wake up, feel refreshed and like me.
And when I close this door, you will wake up, feel refreshed and like me.<eos> Ooh, Mr. Munson, hang on, let me get that bicycle out of your way.<eos> Oh, well, uh, thank you, Bonnie.<eos> That's what I'm here for.<eos> Uh, everything okay in your apartment?<eos> You need anything fixed, replaced, hauled off?<eos> What's wrong with you, you back on the drugs?<eos> No, sir, I'm just trying to do my job.<eos> This have something to do with that tenant evaluation they called me about?<eos> Did you talk to them?
What?<eos> The murder, the trial.<eos> You work for, wait... I told you people. I won't testify.<eos> I gave you my word.<eos> Mr. brujo, I've been asked by some very important people to make sure you have no memory whatsoever of the events surrounding the death of Nicholas drucci.<eos> And I will do that.<eos> Take him to the stage three.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Who the hell are you?
Enough with the reven Wright thing. Come on.<eos> You have no power to interfere with my investigation.<eos> No power? Really?<eos> I'm white house national security advisor.<eos> My interference is the least of your problems.<eos> See, if I choose to, I'll simply remove you from the equation.<eos> Do I make myself clear?<eos> Let it go, agent ressler.<eos> I'm not going anywhere without my witness. Damn it.<eos> I don't want to hurt that girl. But you, in your pursuit of another boy scout honor badge, have forced my hand, and now I have no choice.

Liz. Hang on.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Come on. You are FBI.<eos> You think I actually believe you're going to inject that needle?<eos> You know, unfortunately, I don't know much about propofol.<eos> I think it's a general unaesthetic.<eos> Can you even inject this directly into the arm?<eos> Stop it.<eos> No, no, no, you tell me.<eos> You're the doctor, Princess.
Just not this way.<eos> Ressler, look at your hand.<eos> You were drugged.<eos> Propofol.<eos> Tramadol.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You're the victim here.<eos> He's the victim.<eos> I'm... Yes.<eos> And you're a murderer.
He wants to talk to you.<eos> He's holding on four.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> - You're not supposed to be in here.<eos> I'm sorry. Okay?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> This is good.<eos> I, I need help moving this guy. I'm with Five-O.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> I need you to...
Hello? We found your ambulance and we've got you surrounded.<eos> No one else has to get hurt.<eos> We just want Makino.<eos> And if you don't bring him out, we're gonna have to come in and get him.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, good luck with that. Come on.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> All right. I think there's only three of them.<eos> We're gonna stay inside. They want to come in, we'll pick them off when they do.<eos> You get over there with him.
This... this a bad time?<eos> They told me I could come say hello now.<eos> No. Go ahead. I'm...<eos> I'm finished.<eos> And he never complains about visitors.<eos> All right.<eos> So you're good.<eos> Hit the call button if you want a Jell-O or something.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Hey, you... you, risked your life today for, someone you didn't know.
But yeah.<eos> 'Cause, come to think of it, if it wasn't for you, I never would've met them.<eos> And this... this, island never would have felt like... home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You!<eos> Hands up!<eos> Don't move! Hey.<eos> Who are you?
'Cause, come to think of it, if it wasn't for you, I never would've met them.<eos> And this... this, island never would have felt like... home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You!<eos> Hands up!<eos> Don't move! Hey.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are you?
Okay.<eos> - How did he seem?<eos> Happy.<eos> He was talking about which dorm he wanted at New Haven, right?<eos> Did he say where he was going after dinner?<eos> He didn't.<eos> Why isn't Area Central Homicide investigating this case?<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> - If we could get access to your son's call logs, it would really help with the timeline.<eos> You pay the bills, Mr. Dowd. So you're in control of the account.
Lucky?<eos> Look, I've been rotting in here like meat for 17 years.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm glad you came by.<eos> So I can finally tell you in person to kiss my ass.<eos> Now get me out of here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, Jo Jo.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Who are you?
And that's bad, how, exactly?<eos> 'Cause you'll get arrested.<eos> As opposed to us just giving you a ride to the station and letting you answer some questions voluntarily.<eos> Listen, it's your call.<eos> And tell us about your relationship with Richie Dowd.<eos> To be honest with you, I'm not in any big hurry to revisit what happened, okay?<eos> It's upsetting to me and my family.<eos> We understand that.<eos> Okay, we do.<eos> But the fact remains that Richie was murdered and you were one of the last people to talk to him.
Because how could he have gotten into the store that quickly?<eos> And what about the white guy?<eos> Detective Woods said that happens sometimes on the heels of a trauma.<eos> The mind plays tricks on you.<eos> - I'll see you soon.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mr. McKinnon.<eos> You better have a damn good reason for bringing me down here.<eos> I already told you everything I know.<eos> You left out the part where you went to Richie Dowd's house the day after Jo Jo's pictures showed up online.
- I'll see you soon.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mr. McKinnon.<eos> You better have a damn good reason for bringing me down here.<eos> I already told you everything I know.<eos> You left out the part where you went to Richie Dowd's house the day after Jo Jo's pictures showed up online.<eos> I wish you people would've worked this hard<eos> - when I needed your help.<eos> - No, man.<eos> Now's the part where we move on to you telling us why you went to Richie Dowd's house the day before he was murdered.
Was Richie home when you got there? No.<eos> I got back home, my blood stopped boiling,<eos> - and that was that.<eos> - Mr. McKinnon,<eos> - do you own a gun?<eos> - I don't.<eos> So Richie was shot?<eos> - I'm asking.<eos> - Don't play with me.<eos> You know Richie got shot.
His dad probably bought him a burner phone.<eos> Well, we can triangulate the signal.<eos> See if you can pinpoint his location.<eos> Do it.<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> It's that one, down there.<eos> Second floor, apartment 25, end of the hall.<eos> Eric Scalise, Chicago PD.<eos> Who are you?
Son of a...<eos> Look, Eric, as far as we know, you were just defending Jo Jo's honor.<eos> I mean, you don't have a record.<eos> You probably didn't mean for anything to happen.<eos> I mean, we're thinking you went home, you dug up one of your dad's guns and you went to see Richie.<eos> And that's when things fell apart.<eos> Okay, so, now here's the problem.<eos> This is your dad's gun, right?<eos> All right, so see, him and your mom they're responsible for providing a weapon that was used in the commission of a crime.<eos> Just because it was in the house, where you could have access to it.
Just to, show him I was serious.<eos> And, and he said, "Bitch, you gonna bring a gun?"<eos> "You better be ready to use it."<eos> And I don't even remember pulling the trigger.<eos> But after it went off, I dropped it and ran.<eos> - This is what?<eos> - Your son's confession.<eos> For the murder of Richie Dowd.<eos> Voight's offer still stands, but only for about two more minutes.<eos> What decides this is whether or not you're willing to clear up what happened 17 years ago.
But that's not life.<eos> Your son says that Richie came at him.<eos> He brought the gun to protect himself.<eos> So?<eos> Nick Ruffalo.<eos> If he'd just given up the money, nothing would have happened.<eos> But I was high, and... he just... didn't move fast enough.<eos> I called Woods after to clean it up.<eos> I was so wigged out, I couldn't find the pistol, I...<eos> The gun that you and Woods put on Valentine,

That's Curtis.<eos> My baby boy!<eos> Ma'am, um, I'm Detective Jay Halstead.<eos> This is Detective Erin Lindsay.<eos> We're so sorry for your loss.<eos> If you're able, we'd like to ask you a few questions about Curtis.<eos> Which one of you killed him?<eos> Ma'am, I'm sorry.<eos> Your son was armed, and...<eos> It was you!
We're so sorry for your loss.<eos> If you're able, we'd like to ask you a few questions about Curtis.<eos> Which one of you killed him?<eos> Ma'am, I'm sorry.<eos> Your son was armed, and...<eos> It was you!<eos> He was only 14!<eos> - Okay, hold on, hold on.<eos> - And you took him from me!<eos> You killed my child!
- Yes, we do.<eos> We've got him contributing to the delinquency of and distributing alcohol to a minor.<eos> These were taken by Detective Olinsky on a surveillance operation. Let me get this straight.<eos> We're sending Lavar Spann, the man who masterminded all of this carnage, back to prison on a parole violation?<eos> Either way, if we can get Lavar Spann off the street for however long, I'd consider that a win.<eos> Might not be worthy of a press conference, but it's a win nonetheless.<eos> We should take another run at Corey Jenkins. - Won't talk.<eos> - Well, make him.<eos> That's what you do, isn't it, Sergeant?<eos> You were banging co-eds in law school when I was in the Gang Unit, so I understand how this works.
All for $272.57.<eos> In Greek Town?<eos> Well, yeah, I was working Robbery-Homicide.<eos> Sergeant, I've never met you as a cop, but I did meet you as a little girl.<eos> The owner was your father, and you were with him.<eos> I used to work the register after school, help my parents close up.<eos> The offender broke my father's eye socket, gave him 96 stitches, and then stuck a gun in my face and stole the night's receipts.<eos> Yeah. I remember this.<eos> I spent the whole night at your desk until you caught the guy.<eos> I was so scared through all that, worried if my dad was gonna make it, but you made me feel safe.
Right here.<eos> Jay, you're over there.<eos> Guys, guys, I'm getting an emergency alert from CPIC.<eos> Yeah, I'm on. Feed it to me.<eos> All right. OEMC received multiple 911 calls alerting them to this private Facebook user group.<eos> Yeah, I got it.<eos> It's streaming live.<eos> Yeah, we're watching it.<eos> I'm gonna stay on the line while you triangulate the signal.<eos> Who the hell are you?
Tough background and whatnot.<eos> Seemed to overcome it.<eos> Real shame how it went sideways on him.<eos> His aunt said he was railroaded.<eos> Folks loved Elijah when he was scoring touchdowns, but they turned on him when they thought he crossed the line.<eos> You mean when he slept with his white girlfriend?<eos> Parents found out what was going on, and they lost it.<eos> Beth testified against Elijah.<eos> For my money he never should've been arrested, much less put away.<eos> Well, it says here you were the arresting officer.
Elijah Hendricks, you recognize him?<eos> No friend of mine.<eos> He was murdered yesterday.<eos> What? I'm supposed to shed a tear?<eos> Well, are you aware that, in high school, Elijah was convicted of raping your girlfriend?<eos> I guess he got what he deserved.<eos> Did he? To be burned alive?<eos> That wasn't me.<eos> No?<eos> 'Cause I've seen Beth. You're clearly the jealous type.
- It's about your latest. Perv Hunters video.<eos> Familiar with the First Amendment?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is that the 14?<eos> 14 words?<eos> What would you know about it?<eos> "We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."<eos> Fourteen.<eos> Hey, he can count.<eos> No, you're... you're doing great.
They're all watching this.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Don't talk, listen.<eos> The guy you targeted? Metcalf?<eos> He was just murdered.<eos> But I was here.<eos> You know it couldn't have been me.<eos> Yeah, well, here's the thing.<eos> Even if you didn't do it personally, you incited somebody to violence.<eos> And, because you admitted to posting that video that IDed him, I can charge you as an accessory to murder.
Hey, you, sick bastard.<eos> Like diddling little boys, do you? Get out.<eos> Get...<eos> Get away from me.<eos> - Sicko.<eos> - Get...<eos> Get away from me!<eos> You perv!<eos> Yeah, keep walking.<eos> - We know exactly where you live. - Back off!
I mean, just disappeared, gone.<eos> And the not knowing what happened to her is what always gnawed at me and what gnaws at her family.<eos> If this man is what I think he is with kids, this feels very personal.<eos> Why don't you tell us about Detroit?<eos> That was a false accusation.<eos> That's not what the Detroit Police Department has to say.<eos> I was never charged.<eos> That doesn't mean you didn't do it.<eos> That just means they couldn't convict you.<eos> You were the person of interest.
It broke my heart.<eos> What did happen in Detroit, Jeremy?<eos> I was coaching a youth hockey team, and there was this boy, Joshua,<eos> who had a lot of raw talent, but he was in foster care.<eos> It was a terrible situation.<eos> And so I took him under my wing.<eos> His death was a total shock to me.<eos> It was awful.<eos> I miss him to this day.<eos> It says in here that you were in foster care.
Yes, I was.<eos> Did someone hurt you there, Jeremy?<eos> I learned to take care of myself.<eos> What happened to your wrists?<eos> It was an accident.<eos> On both wrists?<eos> I said it was an accident.<eos> You're a shrink, right?<eos> I'm a psychiatrist, yes.<eos> What you do, Doctor, I don't believe in it.
Erin, don't do this.<eos> Haley, get out!<eos> Give me a reason.<eos> Detective Lindsay.<eos> You admit to shoving your fully loaded service weapon down the victim's throat?<eos> A repeat violent sexual offender who targets tender-age children.<eos> He knew the location of a boy that he raped who we believed to be clinging to life.<eos> That boy is the one and only victim here.<eos> I have spent my entire adult career training to sit across from liars and scum and get the truth out of them, and I do not regret what I did here.<eos> What you did is official misconduct.
Eighteen overdoses.<eos> Two kids ID'd you as the guy who sold them these pills.<eos> Cell tower history puts you at the scene of the truck robbery.<eos> You're cooked, buddy.<eos> Come on.<eos> You got all that on me, but you can't place me anywhere near Martelli's murder.<eos> All right, so, then, how did Martelli get killed?<eos> Fifty years on Earth as a guy no one likes didn't help.<eos> Plus he was dealing, too.<eos> But you know that.
You save the unit?<eos> If Bunny Fletcher doesn't turn up, we're gonna need a whole new plan.<eos> Detective Upton is aware if she doesn't answer your questions, she can be fired.<eos> She's here today to cooperate.<eos> We'd like the record to reflect that.<eos> Noted.<eos> Haley Upton, made Detective meritoriously following actions of some heroism on an undercover assignment whose details are opaque, even to this board.<eos> She's an exemplary police officer.<eos> Not finished.<eos> Not a month into your time in Intelligence before you wind up here.
They secured 39,000 painkillers, and Bunny Fletcher has agreed to testify against Pollack in the robbery.<eos> Are you saying we're just gonna sit out a murder investigation?<eos> I guess they'll look into that, too.<eos> I want the job.<eos> And here I was prepping my sales pitch.<eos> On one condition: My mother doesn't do time on this narcotics beef.<eos> No charges, no paper on her being detained.<eos> She gave up the real bad guys.<eos> They used her.<eos> And she's not who you want.
- [Eep gasps] Good idea, Thunk.<eos> We shouldn't be fighting, we should be tickling.<eos> [Thunk] Of course! Watch out, Eep, here comes the tickle monster!<eos> [Eep] Don't! No, not me, tickle him.<eos> [Grug] Tickle, tickle.<eos> - [growling laughter] [retching] [grunting]<eos> Show no mercy!<eos> [groans] Next time I choose death.<eos> Where's Thunk?<eos> How'd you get out of the...
You can't hear them, but, um, they are.<eos> - Gotta go!<eos> - [Snoot] What?<eos> You can't leave us in here!<eos> The whole valley is in here and I hate making small talk.<eos> Look, Amber no happy about this, but at least Grug no leave us somewhere dangerous.<eos> Amber take back Amber last statement.<eos> What the...?<eos> [groans] [laughing] Eep, what are you doing here?<eos> You're supposed to be tyrannaconda food.
Ha! You think you can ignore us?<eos> Try this on for size.<eos> ♪ I'm Gran, I'm Gran You have to look at me ♪<eos> - ♪ 'Cause I have no shame ♪<eos> - Close your eyes and plug your ears.<eos> - This will show them.<eos> Well, they're out of our hair.<eos> No need to thank me.<eos> Actually, I take it back, thank me.<eos> You made the whole valley hate us, even Lerk.
No need to thank me.<eos> Actually, I take it back, thank me.<eos> You made the whole valley hate us, even Lerk.<eos> [bawling] He even made 'em hate me, and I'm downright adorable.<eos> Grug, I know I say this a lot, possibly to the point that it's lost all meaning, but this time I really mean it:<eos> this is bad!<eos> Family, I can't believe you don't see how great this is.<eos> We're back in the valley like you wanted, except now the only person to bother us is nobody.<eos> Ooh, an entire girelephant, and it's all mine.<eos> Oh, that is, unless you demand a cut, nobody.

Let's give up!<eos> - Let's give up!<eos> - What are we gonna do, Dad?<eos> I think there's only one way out of this.<eos> Of course.<eos> Step one, develop flying powers.<eos> Step two...<eos> The only way out of this is together.<eos> What?<eos> You're the one who wanted nothing to do with us.
No?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Bye.<eos> [cheering and laughing] [laughing] I'm so glad we're friends again.<eos> [chortles] Me, too.<eos> I was getting tired of my other friend.<eos> She can be super clingy.<eos> Geez, give me some space!<eos> - [gasps] You came back.
Yeah, okay.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Bye.<eos> [cheering and laughing] [laughing] I'm so glad we're friends again.<eos> [chortles] Me, too.<eos> I was getting tired of my other friend.<eos> She can be super clingy.<eos> Geez, give me some space!<eos> - [gasps] You came back.<eos> I almost forgot you broke my heart.
Amber also want welcome Croods back to community.<eos> Shun is done!<eos> We're glad to be back.<eos> You know what they say.<eos> There's no place like... uh, this place.<eos> But you heard the Broods.<eos> They'll be back, so we gotta be ready.<eos> Now, it's gonna take a lot of effort, a lot of thinking, and coordination.<eos> Boy, that sure sounds like a lot of work.<eos> How about just you do it?
What about you? What important save-the-world work are you doing at MIT?<eos> I'm creating a map of space.<eos> Professor Croft, it's Liam.<eos> There's something there that was - not there three months ago.<eos> - Really?<eos> People need to see this immediately.<eos> 911?<eos> My professor, he disappeared.<eos> I'm onto something that someone, somewhere doesn't want public.<eos> The sky is falling, and you may be the only person that can do something about it.
the gravity tractor.<eos> Send it up, do a fly-by, the mass of the GT pulls the asteroid off its trajectory.<eos> No muss, no fuss,<eos> - no loss of life.<eos> - Darius,<eos> I just said, we don't have - the technology...<eos> - Not yet.<eos> All we need is a working EM drive, and I can build it.<eos> An electromagnetic drive?<eos> You're insane.
Yeah. Nobody ever gets that.<eos> I like surprising people.<eos> You're a reporter.<eos> I should've told you at the embassy, but I didn't want to ruin the moment.<eos> We were having a moment?<eos> I thought so.<eos> Anyway, I want to do a piece on Darius Tanz.<eos> Something splashy to earn my keep at Capitol Eyes.<eos> You think you could grease the wheels for me?<eos> You don't have clearance to be in this area.
Probably.<eos> Unless I can figure out a way to stop it somehow...<eos> She's still happy.<eos> Why should she have to carry around this burden?<eos> - This burden sucks.<eos> - Liam... Liam,<eos> I'm carrying on as if, and so should you.<eos> As if what?<eos> You're actually doing something to help?<eos> 'Cause last time I checked, it is... it is me and Croft and a bunch of your minions sweating it out in the trenches while you're out eating tacos with my girlfriend.
Damn, you're good.<eos> You got this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Security, please report to the lobby.<eos> Security, please report to the lobby.<eos> Don't make me ask you this again.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - All due respect, sir, Mr. Tanz doesn't permit me to give out his schedule.<eos> Okay, nothing's private as far as the Patriot Act's concerned.<eos> So with as much respect as I can muster, you will tell me where he is.
I don't bark on command.<eos> Six foreign corporations have sued you for industrial espionage.<eos> Hacking proprietary technology.<eos> If you know that, you'd also know I countersued, because those companies stole from me.<eos> The drives we took from Tanz this morning were wiped clean.<eos> That's fairly incriminating, don't you think?<eos> They have an automatic kill switch.<eos> Just smart tech designed to prevent espionage.<eos> You're wasting time...<eos> Time you don't have.
"It's not over.<eos> I have one more move left."<eos> What did you mean by that when you texted Grace Barrows?<eos> Hacking NASA?<eos> That was your move, wasn't it?<eos> Amazing how quickly people are willing to believe the worst about others.<eos> Narcissists.<eos> When they fail, first they deny it, then they make sure no one else succeeds.<eos> Darius, I suggest you talk while you still have the ability.<eos> Never seen him like this, have you?
The deputy secretary is gonna want to see this.<eos> He told me to jack up the power.<eos> That's what made this mess.<eos> Do you think Darius did it, that's he's a... that he's a traitor?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I should have...<eos> I should have listened to you, not-not him.<eos> No, no, according to these readouts, the drive was gonna fail anyway.<eos> The microwaves were going out of alignment even before you dialed it up. Why?
Me?<eos> Other than the world ending, what do I have to be afraid of?<eos> Of yourself, discovering you're capable of things you couldn't have imagined a few weeks ago.<eos> You mean like trusting someone who turned out to be a liar and a traitor?<eos> I know the uranium wasn't for the EmDrive.<eos> I never move a piece on the board unless it's for a good reason.<eos> I'm not a pawn you can sacrifice; this isn't a game.<eos> I didn't do this, Grace.<eos> What reason would I have?<eos> Only you can answer that.
What about a crystalline lattice? Right?<eos> Crystals are highly reflective.<eos> I tried that years ago.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm afraid... we're looking for a substance that doesn't exist.<eos> Oh, Pentagon.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Liam.<eos> Darius?<eos> Are you okay?
The government is done with Tanz Industries.<eos> We've lost control of space.<eos> We're out of options.<eos> Darius is our best hope right now.<eos> Our best hope?<eos> He squandered a billion dollars.<eos> The EmDrive project crashed and burned spectacularly.<eos> And now we find out that NASA was hacked by one of his own people.<eos> Am I missing something here, Ms. Barrows?<eos> You've already helped him drain this task force of time and money.

Soon as I get my "Sorry I let them waterboard you" card in the mail.<eos> Darius, I'm sorry. I...<eos> I'm desperately sorry for what happened, and I want to believe you, but right now, I have too many questions and not enough answers.<eos> I can't go back to the Pentagon without proof the EmDrive works.<eos> Okay, follow me.<eos> You want proof?<eos> You want answers?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Get in.<eos> Who are you?
Then we'll approach them about a collaborative mission.<eos> But we still don't know who was behind the hack.<eos> How do we know who we can trust?<eos> We don't.<eos> It's a process.<eos> And what do we say?<eos> "Pardon me, but do you mind if we destroy your billiondollar space toy for no apparent reason?"<eos> It'll look like an accident.<eos> By then, it's too late for anyone to object.<eos> Claire, you were a little rough on Grace Barrows this morning.
Nothing we do matters, because someone will always be sabotaging us.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Laz uploaded something onto a private remote server in the last moments of his life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Probably all of Tanz Industries' secrets.<eos> Or the answer to his murder.<eos> This is where he lived?<eos> He was a quiet man.<eos> With demons.<eos> Is this you?
Tess.<eos> Thank you... for taking care of Laz for all of these years.<eos> I'm sorry I...<eos> I couldn't protect him.<eos> You did.<eos> You saved his life, Darius.<eos> And whoever did this... find them.<eos> I promise.<eos> That photo of you in front of the tree house...<eos> That was you with Lazlo and Tess?
Who is this?<eos> A friend with the same agenda.<eos> And what agenda is that?<eos> Atlas.<eos> Check the message.<eos> - What am I looking at?<eos> - Zoom in.<eos> Here's the billiondollar question:<eos> What is Tanz technology doing fused inside this rock?<eos> Who are you?
We tracked the SUV for 30 miles northnorthwest before the satellite moved out of range.<eos> You sure you can't pick them up somewhere?<eos> We hooked into traffic cams, but they left the grid over an hour ago, the trail is cold.<eos> Okay, we have the SUV's license plate number.<eos> Let's put out an APB.<eos> We don't have time for that.<eos> Dexter, we have the license plate.<eos> Can you get the VIN number from the DMV?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Excuse me, you're not in charge here.
So, did you get the answers to your questions?<eos> Some.<eos> Tess... was the love of my life.<eos> I broke her heart and, as it turns out, my own.<eos> She's my biggest regret, and now Lazlo.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> How could I have been so stupid?<eos> Croft...<eos> He's the only person I haven't vetted in all the years I've let people through these doors.<eos> Darius, no one can see everything coming, not even you.
Look, it's the first step in a long road.<eos> Really, I'm just getting started.<eos> You've also passed orders to strengthen the military, increase border security, and you've asked Defense Secretary Howell to draft a memo on how to defeat the Islamic Front.<eos> Can you talk more about that?<eos> We have never been more vulnerable in this country than we are today.<eos> We've suffered significant intelligence failures, both foreign and domestic, under the Haas administration.<eos> The CIA failed to prevent an Islamic Front attack at the G20.<eos> And just a few days ago, he FBI suffered an attack... in their own backyard.<eos> You have to stop calling me.<eos> - And you have to get me out of here.
A partnership is built on goodwill.<eos> "The Commander Star" has left his First House.<eos> His life has run its course.<eos> It wasn't my call to make.<eos> Deputy Chief Wang.<eos> Come with us.<eos> Please.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Who are you?
How's it going?<eos> Huasheng.<eos> How have you been?<eos> I can't believe we're meeting again.<eos> Where is he?<eos> What's the rush?<eos> I've waited ten years for you.<eos> Cut the crap.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I kept him alive for ten years so that you would come back.
Why did you come here?<eos> Are you cashing in a favor? Huh?<eos> Chela, calm down.<eos> This lady's in my house, man.<eos> Don't tell me to shut up.<eos> -I had nowhere else to go.<eos> -You just happened to pass through Tepito?<eos> Dolores told me to come here. She said you'd help me.<eos> I also know that the police don't come to Tepito.<eos> Neither do people like you.
Excuse me.<eos> Hello?<eos> Who is this?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know who you are.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Canek?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What happened to my son?<eos> Who are you?
Wait!<eos> We have a problem.<eos> Emilia, why did you get in the way?<eos> -[Zyan] Hold on.<eos> -I don't have a clear shot. Move, damn it.<eos> I said to get on your knees!<eos> Get up, Emilia Urquiza.<eos> Go see what's happening!<eos> Go! Go find out what the hell that is!<eos> [Chela] Maybe you can just pretend it's one of those computer games you like.
Don't worry.<eos> The situation is under control.<eos> Where am I?<eos> You're in a safe place.<eos> [Canek] You wanted to redeem yourself.<eos> Tell us who's behind the C1, man.<eos> What are you going to do to me?<eos> [Canek] We're going to help. Then tell us. Juan.<eos> I just need to talk to you.<eos> I know who you are.
I'm just the messenger.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I was just leaving.<eos> Aguirre.<eos> You have him.<eos> Thanks for confirming it.<eos> I understand what you're doing.<eos> The general has put many people on alert, and I'm sure he's willing to talk.<eos> I also understand the general's perspective.<eos> You're a neutral party. You've got contacts, but you aren't in the executive branch or military.
And I think that only by working together, even if they don't want to, will we be able to get rid of scum like you.<eos> Not just a whore, but a traitor, too.<eos> How would you like it if someone else knew about this?<eos> You wouldn't act like such a big shot then.<eos> [chuckles] At this point, anyone could tell you're clutching at straws, General.<eos> I have two minutes left.<eos> What will it be?<eos> Mexico or death?<eos> Sometimes what you know is so bad... so rotten... that it's better to go with the unknown.<eos> So... fuck your boss, fuck your offer, and fuck you!
Emilia!<eos> Where is she?<eos> -Who is this?<eos> -Where's Emilia?<eos> I want to speak with Patricia Lieberman.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Put Patricia Lieberman on the phone, right now.<eos> She's dead.<eos> They're all dead.<eos> You killed them.
Let me help you with those.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> That's so sweet.<eos> You're the first person who looks anything like my husband who's offered to help in any way.<eos> Oh, you must be Peter's wife, Lois.<eos> I'm Larry.<eos> It's nice to meet you, Larry.<eos> Weird hands-full pinky shake?<eos> I got to tell you, it's so strange, you look so much like Peter when I first met him.<eos> Well, I'm guessing you look exactly the same, too.
All of which have caused massive population displacements.<eos> And don't even get me started about Darfur.<eos> Seriously, don't.<eos> It's bad.<eos> Then, of course, there's South Sudan.<eos> Jessica?<eos> All we're trying to do there is end a civil war and a famine.<eos> Easy-peasy.<eos> The point is, Mr. Mitchell is, regrettably, one small piece of a very large, very complicated web.<eos> I understand that, but do you know if there's any truth to the rumor that Sudan is looking to make a deal for him?

Thanks for holding the event.<eos> My daughter Chloe loves music.<eos> Indeed.<eos> There is so much more that unites us than divides, no?<eos> Let's hope so.<eos> Here you go, honey.<eos> Just fry your brain while Daddy talks to this nice man.<eos> To the matter at hand.<eos> Again, I return to what unites us.<eos> We are as sincere in our desire to release Mr. Colin Mitchell as you are in your desire to bring him home.
Get inspired, okay?<eos> People are counting on you.<eos> Right.<eos> Congressman, this is Matt Mahoney,<eos> Secretary McCord's speechwriter.<eos> Mr. Mahoney, pleasure.<eos> Thank you for taking the time to see me on such short notice, sir.<eos> Given the circumstances, it's the least I can do.<eos> Please, take a seat.<eos> So you want to write a speech about, Colin Mitchell.

Was I the Antichrist?<eos> Could there be two?<eos> A dozen?<eos> In the Book of Revelation...<eos> I know what it says.<eos> Everything's happening according to God's plan.<eos> Your doctor said that the bullet that blew through your chest missed your heart by a millimeter.<eos> I believe God's grace can be one millimeter wide.<eos> And I think you were saved to bring salvation to the world.<eos> You, Andrew.

Even Salnikov raised his glass.<eos> You are good, sir.<eos> I worked with two speechwriters and practiced in front of a mirror for an hour.<eos> Mr. President, ma'am.<eos> We just got word from our Biological Response Force.<eos> They didn't find any virus at the drone crash site.<eos> It wasn't armed with a bio-weapon?<eos> It was a head fake.<eos> "Head of the infidels."<eos> It's you, sir... and the other leaders.
I'll be in the car.<eos> You know what?<eos> I, um, just realized something.<eos> I don't want to go.<eos> Why the hell not?<eos> I mean, um, I don't want to go to Harvard, or any law school.<eos> I just, it's... if I go,<eos> I'm gonna be ditching the opportunity to-to help my family while Mom is still one of the most powerful people on the planet, and Dad is working the War College and doing all this other secrety stuff that I know he does and... they need me.<eos> Well, I mean, maybe then, I need you, or, um...<eos> I think you need me.
Bisexual.<eos> I know. You're probably like,<eos> "What?<eos> Why is he telling me this now?"<eos> And I can't say for certain, um, but it definitely has to do with an old boyfriend who can be kind of a jerk, but makes good points.<eos> One of them is about what I always considered my right to privacy, which, of course, I still believe in.<eos> It's in the Constitution, for God's sake.<eos> But, um, I realize now my right to privacy is different than me choosing to be private and really has more to do with trusting people with my private business, which is hard for me, because I've experienced a lot of weird bi-phobia<eos> from everyone... I mean, straight people, gay people.<eos> Not that I think that you're bi-phobic or homophobic or phobic about anything.
Nope.<eos> So I guess that means that's his business.<eos> President Perrin, this is an offthebooks conversation.<eos> About an ongoing Interpol investigation into your son, Michel.<eos> Securities fraud, bribing a French market official.<eos> I'm... I think you know the details.<eos> Are you threatening me?<eos> Not at all.<eos> The U.S. has a lot of sway over Interpol, and I am confident that we can find a way to make Michel's problems go away.<eos> Go with us on Article 5, which you know is the right thing to do, and your son will have a future.
They signed a nonproliferation agreement to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.<eos> Because of NATO we were able to say to our allies, you don't need to build up your military, or nuclear arsenal, to feel safe from Russia or any other enemy, because we have your back.<eos> Our army is your army.<eos> And your conflict is our conflict.<eos> If NATO fails, the European nations will be on their own.<eos> And then everyone jumps back into an arms race.<eos> And I truly believe that that is the end of our western democracy as we know it.<eos> And Mrs. Stewart,<eos> I can't believe that's what your son would have wanted.<eos> Do you?
And I truly believe that that is the end of our western democracy as we know it.<eos> And Mrs. Stewart,<eos> I can't believe that's what your son would have wanted.<eos> Do you?<eos> I understand why you want the world to hear your story.<eos> But please, give me some time to make this right.<eos> Checking the obituaries, Oleg?<eos> None of your compatriots died today.<eos> Yet.<eos> Who are you?
The power to raise and give money to political candidates, who, in turn, will at least give them a hearing and at best do their bidding.<eos> Roger was one of the inventors of the modern political system.<eos> The PACs, the super PACs.<eos> That is where Roger has made his influence, and it continues to be felt.<eos> I'm convinced that at some point, with these types of programs, you could elect Mickey Mouse to the House or the Senate.<eos> Ronald Reagan for president.<eos> He'll make America great again.<eos> The district we're in is Congressman Gary Lee.<eos> After this, we go to the 32nd District, where those guys just got knocked off the ballot.<eos> You're good at this.
Come on!<eos> You know who's accused in court papers of being a rapist?<eos> - Donald J. Trump!<eos> - By Jane Doe.<eos> By Jane and Tiffany Doe.<eos> - Jane Doe. Who's Jane Doe?<eos> - It's in court papers.<eos> -You're a sick man, Roger Stone.<eos> -No.<eos> You're a liar. Stone-cold liar.

Blowjob!<eos> Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!<eos> You're a hatchet man.<eos> I don't know why anyone in the media takes you seriously.<eos> You're a lightweight. You don't know anything.
But here's the thing: Rafael wanted to be with Petra, but Petra was hesitant, because, well...<eos> We were terrible together. And now we have these two happy kids.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Plus, she had this new thing going with Chuck, the owner of the Fairwick Hotel next door.<eos> But eventually, Raf won her over.<eos> Yeah, he can be pretty relentless.<eos> Which brings me to his sister, Luisa.<eos> See, he didn't quite trust her, or her new girlfriend, Eileen.<eos> If you want to be in my sister's life, we need to do some medical tests.<eos> And it turns out, Raf was right to be suspicious, because...<eos> You do realize, when you pass this medical exam, you leave the country.
But, of course, this isn't a fairy tale, it's a Telenovela.<eos> So let's dive in.<eos> Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness a rite of passage.<eos> By now, you know that the Villanueva women have been by each other's side, in sickness and in health, for richer and poorer...<eos> It's my dream.<eos> _<eos> Through first loves...<eos> His name is Adam, and he's kind of artistic.<eos> And first heartbreaks...<eos> I promise, you will fall in love again.
Okay! I'm ordained!<eos> That was so easy.<eos> _<eos> No, but their swag game is on point.<eos> Ooh, for $9 more, I could get the "Tell It On The Mountain" package.<eos> It comes with a parking placard and a bumper sticker.<eos> (laughs) Do you think I need a tote?<eos> _<eos> Hmm. Shouldn't there be some kind of template for what to say at the wedding?<eos> Actually, your dad and I were kind of hoping that you'd come up with something personal.

Of course. Of course.<eos> Since you're a writer, right?
- Okay. Time to ditch the rain contingency Plan B binders, and go back to the original checklist.<eos> Did you call the Palapa Yacht Club and confirm our final head count?<eos> - Done.<eos> - Programs?<eos> - Printed.<eos> - Paparazzi?<eos> "Accidentally" tipped off.<eos> Enemies list?<eos> All your ex-wives and ex-agents send their regrets.<eos> Marc Anthony is attending, and per your instructions, he will be be asked "Who are you?

- You're on fire!<eos> I know, right?<eos> No, you're actually on fire!<eos> Oh. Not again.<eos> I have everything under control!<eos> (chuckles): Don't worry.<eos> I'm totally panicking.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, almost everything.<eos> I keep trying to write the ceremony, and... I just feel stuck.<eos> So, I was thinking that maybe you could help me with the structure, as a colleague.

But maybe also around a central unifying theme, which you can suggest.

But maybe also around a central unifying theme, which you can suggest.<eos> You know what?<eos> Here's an assignment:<eos> think about your parents, why they're marrying, why they're meant to be.<eos> Write it down, don't censor yourself, for ten minutes.<eos> I'm thinking a theme will emerge.<eos> You're always giving me writing assignments.
Write it down, don't censor yourself, for ten minutes.<eos> I'm thinking a theme will emerge.<eos> You're always giving me writing assignments.<eos> _<eos> Wait, a writing assignment? FATHER GUSTAVO:<eos> A small one.<eos> I always recommend couples write a letter to each other before the wedding. To read later when times get tougher and you need to remember how you feel about each other right now.<eos> I love that idea.<eos> It's so romantic.<eos> Well, that's 'cause you're a writer; it's easy for you.

He showed it to me.<eos> It was one of the most beautiful love letters I've ever read.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I-I never got it.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: A letter out there?<eos> About "meant to be"?<eos> Sounds pretty "meant to be" to me.<eos> Then again, what do I know?<eos> Dad!<eos> You're back from the spa.
Oh, my God.<eos> I-I never got it.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: A letter out there?<eos> About "meant to be"?<eos> Sounds pretty "meant to be" to me.<eos> Then again, what do I know?<eos> Dad!<eos> You're back from the spa.<eos> ROGELIO:<eos> Yes. And I'm confirming you will be at rehearsal at 5:00.
Just me freaking out.<eos> I, uh, should go and learn this dance.<eos> I will see you two lovebirds at the wedding.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<eos> A slight overcompensation. Nothing he'd notice.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Oh. (scoffs) What else? My sister.<eos> - (thunder rumbles)<eos> - She's, uh, getting out of jail, and with this weather, she can't get a flight out, so she's stuck here.<eos> Trust me, I know how you feel.
Ma, don't worry, wedding Plan B is officially in play.<eos> It's all good.<eos> XIOMARA:<eos> You're sure? I'm freaking out.<eos> JANE: Don't.<eos> I got this.<eos> We're gonna just move the party inside.<eos> I already spoke to the manager.<eos> But I have to go now, okay?<eos> Love you.
(chuckles nervously) Why?<eos> It's your dad's.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, my God.<eos> I know the timing is terrible.<eos> I wasn't even gonna tell him about it, but some tabloid got wind of my pregnancy, and it's only a matter of time until they put two and two together, and I don't want Rogelio to find out that way.<eos> Yeah, no, that-that would be terrible.<eos> I've been trying to tell him myself, but whenever I get close, I just... chicken out.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, that explains the creepy stalking.<eos> So, what do you think?

Can you do it?
this baby...<eos> And then a million other things, including, "maybe it's all meant to be."<eos> But in the end, he returned to... JANE:<eos> Mom?<eos> Last fitting.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Is the train too long?<eos> I went big, like Diana.<eos> No, it's perfect.<eos> You look beautiful.
Then I don't even have to have anything to do with the baby.<eos> Stop.<eos> PETRA: Just stop.<eos> You don't have to keep thanking me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's only that I am so grateful to beautiful sister for all of your help in getting me out of jail.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: She wouldn't be so grateful if she knew "beautiful sister" set her up in the first place.<eos> Here's how you can thank me:<eos> don't leave your room until you get on your flight first thing tomorrow.<eos> CHUCK: You like 'em?
CHUCK: You like 'em?<eos> Look...<eos> I meant what I said.<eos> It's over.<eos> We've been over a bunch of times now.<eos> It's different this time.<eos> I'm giving things a try with Rafael.<eos> - Chuck.<eos> - What?<eos> You told me you always feel like you're in second place with that guy.

You haven't even talked to Darcy yet.<eos> And we need to give ourselves time to figure out what it means for us.<eos> I want to marry you, but not like this.<eos> RAFAEL: Wait, what?<eos> Yes!<eos> I'm getting out of jail.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<eos> Wow. The bad news keeps coming.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You have been on the run with a fugitive.
Yes!<eos> I'm getting out of jail.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<eos> Wow. The bad news keeps coming.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You have been on the run with a fugitive.<eos> I'm getting immunity for my testimony against Rose, since I know where all the dead bodies are buried.<eos> Literally.<eos> I think some of them are on the island that we stayed on.<eos> (thunder rumbling) So when are you getting out?
- So what's the treatment plan?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I'm, uh, I'm getting a second opinion.<eos> But you know what, I really don't want to talk - to you about it.<eos> - I'm just worried about you.<eos> If you were so worried about me, then you wouldn't have brought a mass murderer into my home.<eos> We've hammered out the final detail.<eos> (thunder rumbling) LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now.<eos> To the final detail.<eos> You lied to me.
So, someone who looked exactly like your Eileen face just happened to be in the Marbella that night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Eileen!<eos> The real Eileen must have killed him.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<eos> Which is true, for the record.<eos> Come on! Eileen?<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Let me explain.<eos> _<eos> Didn't I just see you, like, two seconds ago with Chinese food in the lobby?

Eileen?<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Let me explain.<eos> _<eos> Didn't I just see you, like, two seconds ago with Chinese food in the lobby?<eos> You remember that Rose had just threatened to kill her if anyone figured out their scheme.<eos> Oh, you have a twin or something?
Oh, you have a twin or something?<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It was her or Scott.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So she ditched him.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Do not touch the prisoner.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - GUARD: Time's up.<eos> I told you you could trust me.<eos> The person you shouldn't trust is your brother.
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Do not touch the prisoner.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - GUARD: Time's up.<eos> I told you you could trust me.<eos> The person you shouldn't trust is your brother.<eos> What?<eos> Come on!<eos> You really think his cancer is back?
(thunder rumbles) I still have some friends at the hospital and made some calls.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<eos> Oh, right! Luisa used to be a doctor.<eos> Well... it was the only way to get Rose back.<eos> How could you lie to me about something like that?<eos> You were dating the woman that killed our father and kidnapped my son!<eos> And that was bad.<eos> But it was in the past;<eos> she wanted to change.<eos> Oh, my God, you are completely delusional.
_<eos> _<eos> Whoa, look at this.<eos> We'll just have the landlord fix it.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> It's, like, the best hiding spot ever.<eos> Makes me want this place even more. Yeah?<eos> What are you gonna hide in it?<eos> Your spy decoder ring?<eos> How do you know about my spy decoder ring?
ROGELIO: Thank you for doing this.<eos> We thought it would be a good idea if we all sat down and talked.<eos> To put your mind at ease, I don't want any money.<eos> I will support her myself.<eos> (gasps) We're having a girl?<eos> Yes.<eos> Rogeliana.<eos> We didn't agree on Rogeliana.<eos> You said you were open to it.<eos> That was just to get you to sign the contract.
- name our daughter Rogeliana!<eos> - You are clinically insane!<eos> Oh... Can we just table the names for the moment?<eos> Agreed.<eos> I want to confirm that we'll share custody, per our previous agreement.<eos> No. I want primary custody.<eos> What?<eos> The previous agreement was made when we were gonna do this together and we actually liked each other.<eos> Everything is different now that I hate you.<eos> Well, I hate you, too, but you're the mother of my child. So I will keep that very real, intense, and almost violent hatred inside, because I want to be involved in my child's life.

No.<eos> I want more.<eos> And you should want him to have more.<eos> He's a great father; you know that.
Who am I kidding?<eos> I'm not gonna walk away from you; you're it for me.<eos> Really?<eos> Really.<eos> So let's just get married.<eos> Today, like we planned.<eos> But we canceled everything.<eos> All we need is you, me, Mom, Jane and Mateo.<eos> And 42 backup dancers, 12 doves and three costume changes.<eos> Darcy, you'll be hearing from our attorney.
What?<eos> My parents' wedding is back on. In two hours at the Marbella.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I have to get a car.<eos> Uber, Lyft... they're both out 'cause of the storm.<eos> A taxi.<eos> I'm pretty sure we got you the last taxi out there, Miss Alver.<eos> And I apologize, but it's a ride share, - so someone's joining you.<eos> - ANEZKA: It's me! Hi, there.<eos> Oh, you must be Petra's twin sister. I'm Luisa.
We're just grabbing your dress.<eos> Yes, I will be careful. Love you.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Oh, and be careful with the train.<eos> I am being careful.<eos> Go write your ceremony.<eos> Dearly beloved, meant to be, and all that.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What did you do?
I need more colors to work with.<eos> (gasps) Mateo, run over to Abuela's room and borrow her foundations.<eos> Go!<eos> Hurry!<eos> One?<eos> (chuckles) Dad says Mateo's being a good wingman. Ha!<eos> Scared about what that means.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that's when...<eos> - Oh, my God. - (sighs)<eos> You're famous.
Next time, maybe choose a hotel that has a safety plan.<eos> Wait. We can't do this.<eos> We have to keep this room clear for the Villanueva wedding.<eos> We're in the middle of a hurricane.<eos> Rafael was very clear. He promised Jane.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> JANE: My dress is in my backpack, so...<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I feel terrible.<eos> Are you okay, Mom? ALBA:
Of course my dress in ruined.<eos> Look around.<eos> We're getting married in the middle of a hurricane.<eos> Oh, who cares?<eos> I just want to marry your father.<eos> Okay. Well, then we'll make do.<eos> Hey, we got the hookup at the gift shop.<eos> Oh, and you know what, I won't even wear my dress, so that I don't distract from the bride.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> You're the officiant, so you should stand out.
And by the power vested in me by the Circle of Life Sacred Church, I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> Dad, kiss Mom. - Yeah.<eos> Pretty weird wedding.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> My hotel was evacuated, remember?<eos> (thunder rumbling)<eos> And I was looking for you... 'cause that ceremony, it reminded me...<eos> Look, we break up, we make up.<eos> We always come back together.<eos> I was watching you all night long.
And all I kept thinking was,<eos> "Is she gonna turn around and look at me? "<eos> Rafael, I'm sorry.<eos> That was a mistake.<eos> It didn't mean anything.<eos> We've been back together for a week.<eos> I know!<eos> I was just feeling very insecure, and-and he was saying all the right things, and it just happened.<eos> Insecure about what?<eos> You and Jane.

You're going to say you're just best friends, but that's not it.<eos> She looks at you like...<eos> like that's not it.<eos> Okay, you are way off.
And you chose her before. A long time ago.<eos> That's not what's happening.<eos> So you're saying if you found out Jane had feelings for you, that wouldn't change anything?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I don't know that I believe that.<eos> And, regardless, this is why I didn't want to get back together with you.<eos> I was past this.<eos> I-I don't want to be worried about you and Jane.<eos> And, friends, at this moment, all Petra wanted was for Rafael to say no, to choose her, and to keep choosing her.<eos> Yeah, maybe you were right.

So let's just... go back to how things were.<eos> Daddy!<eos> - Family dance! - Okay.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah. Just, um...<eos> I just broke things off with, uh, P-E-T-R-A.<eos> I want to be down.<eos> What happened?<eos> Well, remember all those reasons you said we shouldn't date?<eos> You were right.
Yeah. Just, um...<eos> I just broke things off with, uh, P-E-T-R-A.<eos> I want to be down.<eos> What happened?<eos> Well, remember all those reasons you said we shouldn't date?<eos> You were right.<eos> We bring out the worst in each other.<eos> No. No, I was wrong, remember?<eos> What?<eos> Petra freaked out because she thinks that you still have feelings for me.

I'd choose you.
Well, that's crazy.<eos> That's what I said.<eos> Yes!<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: "Destiny is a series of detours," a wise man once said.<eos> Finally stopped raining.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... talk to me about Rafael.<eos> What?<eos> As a married lady...<eos> I am an expert in hot and bothered, and you looked pretty hot and bothered.
Do you?<eos> It's a step backwards.<eos> Or forwards.<eos> Did you even listen to yourself up there?<eos> How your dad and me kept choosing each other.<eos> Maybe he's your destiny.<eos> I don't believe in destiny. LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<eos> She will before the night is over.<eos> At least talk to him.<eos> So, you're a love guru.
Jane, I've been looking for you.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Maybe it'll make more sense to you.<eos> A couple from your old apartment got in touch with the tenant from before them, and then something about a floorboard.<eos> Some guy brought it.<eos> He's waiting on the south patio.<eos> MICHAEL: Dear Jane, first, sorry for being goofy in the priest's office.<eos> I was just nervous, because I was scared about writing something for you, a writer.<eos> And I've been thinking about what to say, which got me to thinking how lucky I was to have met you at all, and all the small twists of fate that led me to you in the first place...<eos> Krishna, have you seen Rafael?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Raf?<eos> Where is my phone?<eos> Raf?<eos> Hello, beautiful sister with the ugly heart.<eos> Wh-What's going on?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I stole Rafael's phone, just like you stole my Scott's phone that night. - What?
I stole Rafael's phone, just like you stole my Scott's phone that night. - What?<eos> I...<eos> - Stop lying!<eos> I know all of what happened.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: This is true, for the record.<eos> Remember the fateful taxi ride, when I told you it'd make a big mess of things?<eos> Trust me.<eos> I know alcohol.<eos> There is no way anyone goes into a drunken blackout off a little peach schnapps. You were roofied.<eos> The night my beloved Scott died, you text me from his phone.
So now, I play same phone trick on you.<eos> And it all comes kruh Se uzavrel.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or, "full circle," as it were.<eos> Which unfortunately brings us here.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I told you to leave.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> I am thinking we were meant to be in car ride together.<eos> You helped me, now I can help you.
I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> I am thinking we were meant to be in car ride together.<eos> You helped me, now I can help you.<eos> My dead husband found addition to your father's will.<eos> Rafael gets nothing.<eos> Zero.<eos> Zilch.<eos> Which means the hotel, the trust, everything is mine.<eos> Which means you're the one that needs to get out.
- I'd picked up a shift for my buddy whose kid was playing in a recital.<eos> And then I was technically off, but I took a detour and stopped for a burger a few blocks away.<eos> And I was heading back to the precinct when...<eos> DISPATCHER (over radio): We've got a noise complaint on 25th.<eos> Any units nearby who can check it out?<eos> Yeah, I'm right there.<eos> MICHAEL: If not for that recital and that burger, I might not have ended up on the doorstep of a drunk 21-year-old girl.<eos> That's not just a series of coincidences.<eos> It's destiny.<eos> And I never doubted you were mine.

Not one student showed up to school just because a pack of ferocious, masterless dogs are roaming the playground.<eos> Ow! Damn it!<eos> I thought we sent Willie out there to deal with them.<eos> I did.<eos> But he, uh, hasn't returned.<eos> I've finally been accepted for who I truly am.<eos> How come I don't get a dog-proof suit?<eos> Because I smell like lamb, Lou.<eos> Very well.<eos> You were right and we were wrong.
I like it precisely enough to not kill myself.<eos> It's an option, though.<eos> It's totally an option.<eos> I mean, I'm 49.<eos> I have two kids.<eos> I've flipped through the brochure a few times.<eos> I've thought of killing myself just to win an argument.<eos> Not supposed to talk about suicide, even to your shrink.<eos> You ever go to a shrink and they're like, "Have you had thoughts... of suicide?"<eos> And you're like, "No, because if I say yes, you'll press a button, and folks will run in and hold me-- "Hold him down!"
And you eat it, you bite off its screaming face while it's alive.<eos> And every turtle you eat is the last of his species."<eos> I can't wait to eat that fucking turtle.<eos> I'm going to end his people with my mouth.<eos> The best, I'll try it.<eos> If somebody was like, "We have a guy here, he has the best dick.<eos> The best dick ever.<eos> His dick has been soaking in olive oil since he was five years old.<eos> We've been feeding him nothing but butter and penises his whole life.<eos> He has the best dick, and you can suck it right now."
But it shows what you know, because it's only accessory after the fact.<eos> We were merely using this poor pre-deceased young woman to fake my death.<eos> - What?<eos> - Why?<eos> She's trying to get out of a quasi-incestuous home-life situation.<eos> How quasi?<eos> Like, a four?<eos> - Meh. - Put a ham in it, Poovey.<eos> What's your story, lady?<eos> Who are you?
- Keep it up, and you will. - Wait.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not accustomed to being stood up,<eos> Mr. Archer, and yet once again...<eos> I know, and I'm sorry.<eos> It's just... Well, she isn't just some chippie.<eos> She's actually Charlotte Vandertunt.<eos> I... you mean, the heiress to the vast Vandertunt Publishing Fortune?<eos> - Zerp. Then do tell.<eos> What's a nice heiress like you - doing in a joint like this?
What a load of shit.<eos> I should be looking for my partner's killer, but instead I'm looking for a damn finger.<eos> [sighs] [speaking German] [air-raid siren in distance] [sighs]<eos> [sighs]<eos> Well,<eos> I hate to say I told you so. Do you?<eos> No.<eos> It's one of the few great pleasures in life.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Do you live in here?
Honestly?<eos> Hardy-har-har.<eos> If you need a finger, just take one.<eos> - No, I'm not cutting off her... [snoring loudly]<eos> Man, that septum is deviated, huh?<eos> That's not her.<eos> [Archer] Poovey? Mm-hmm.<eos> Tried to break into the club first thing this morning.<eos> I assume looking for Drooling Beauty over there.<eos> Yeah, you really threw a monkey wrench into Figgis' plan.
No, not you.<eos> Wha... wha... then who?<eos> No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You. He wants to kill you.<eos> The good news is, without my help, he'll be dead in...<eos> Ten hours. Okay, well, my house is a fortress.<eos> I got a ton of guys.<eos> We'll outlast him.<eos> Yeah. You say that...
Shut up.<eos> Look, tonight your brother is going to drop the ransom money at the Griffith observatory.<eos> Archer is going to retrieve it and bring it to me.<eos> And if nobody screws up, once I have the money, you're free to go. Well, but that's my whole point.<eos> Go where?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Maybe a handsome young Nazi scientist will take you in.<eos> - What the hell are you doing?<eos> Just filling the coolers with ice.<eos> You know, normal bartendery stuff.
Must've brought the cops, and then they double-crossed him and stole the ransom.<eos> So I chased them, but then Figgis shot out my tire, and...<eos> Figgis?<eos> Yeah. Him and Poovey, they...<eos> Tell me this doesn't have anything to do with Trexler's missing whores.<eos> Okay.<eos> Although, come to think of it...<eos> If Figgis doesn't square things with Trexler, he's walking around dead and just doesn't know it yet.<eos> Not unlike Frankenstein's monster!<eos> Or you.
- You shot me. - In your chest plate.<eos> You're lucky that's all I did.<eos> - I had him.<eos> - Like hell you had him.<eos> How many fingers I got up, huh?<eos> That's what I thought. You pull that shit again,<eos> I'll kill you in half a heartbeat.<eos> Always gotta be the hero, huh?<eos> I'm not trying to be anybody's hero. You did this.<eos> You're completely out of control.
[Eep] Who's the cutest carnivore in the cave?<eos> - Is it you? - [giggles]
No.<eos> Each one of these is important, Eep.<eos> After all, someday we might want to remember that time when Sandy stared at nothing.<eos> Well, how do I look?<eos> Whoa! Ooga booga la la!<eos> Alpha male coming through.<eos> Nice power carcass, Dad.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I want to look dominant for my first full day as Valley leader.<eos> And what says that better than "I wear more dead animals than you"? Ha.
So after a lot of thought, I've decided we'll start by picking up the, uh... big stuff, then work down to the... less big stuff.<eos> - All right.<eos> All right. - Less big stuff sounds good.<eos> Ooh, ooh, Grug, Grug, okay, are you sure this is the best way?<eos> What if we worked... Wait for it...<eos> Backsies to frontsies?<eos> Yeah, or bottom to top.<eos> I got it.<eos> I think we should split the work based on our strengths.<eos> Like, you're good at cleaning and I'm good at sitting in shade, so...
[growls] [sniffs]<eos> [Thunk] Oh, good. You two met.<eos> Sandy, say hi to the newest and third-hairiest member of our family.<eos> [Ugga] Newest member?<eos> Thunk, is that a monkhuahua?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can he live with us, Mom?<eos> He's really nice, and I already gave him a name.<eos> Not Food.<eos> So you-know-who doesn't forget.
So you-know-who doesn't forget.<eos> We got to take away Gran's rock stash.<eos> Sorry, Thunk, but we just can't take in a wild animal.<eos> He's just too... adorable!<eos> Oh, goochy goo.<eos> [Eep laughs] Here, Not Food.<eos> What a cave wall moment.<eos> We don't need all these.<eos> [sneezes] [gasps] Oh, it's like his little nose just said<eos> I wuv you.
See how great we're doing?<eos> Can't see a thing, Grug.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yeah, well, just get excited.<eos> I can get excited on cue.<eos> Excited, Munk, not crazy.<eos> Mom, could we build Not Food a comfy little nest to sleep in?<eos> Sorry, we have more important things to do.<eos> Like making him little pelts to model for us.<eos> [squeaks] Not Food, is that you?
[squeaks] Not Food, is that you?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Where'd he go?<eos> - [grunts]<eos> He... he ran away?<eos> Mom, come quick!<eos> Sandy's mouth grew an arm.<eos> [spits, laughs] Not Food is not food, young lady.<eos> Go to your shame corner.<eos> [Thunk] You okay, fella?
[laughs] Nice try, Grug, but we know you're just testing to see if we'll remove our blindfolds again, you big silly billy.<eos> What? No!<eos> This is...<eos> Okay, whatever.<eos> Just kick, punch...<eos> No, Teena, kick that one's shins.<eos> Oh, forget it.<eos> Follow me.<eos> [sighs] [whimpers] [Ugga] Sandy!<eos> Sandy, where are you?
Follow me.<eos> [sighs] [whimpers] [Ugga] Sandy!<eos> Sandy, where are you?<eos> Oh, no, she must've run away because we big people didn't give her enough attention.<eos> Good thing we have Not Food as our new baby.<eos> Yep, Sandy doesn't matter anymore.<eos> Not Food is the chosen one.<eos> [Ugga] Sandy!<eos> Sandy!<eos> Where are you?
Now start with the biggest ones and... [screams]<eos> Oh, actually, just do it however you want to.<eos> [Teena pants] I'll start at the backsies, and work to the frontsies.<eos> And I'll go bottom to top.<eos> And do not worry about this area.<eos> I've got it covered.<eos> Ooh. Way to go, guys.<eos> Now charge!<eos> Death to monkhuahuas!<eos> Oh, you're too cute to smash.
Work hard for your mom, kids.<eos> - [muffled screams] - [Grug shouts] [both sigh] We almost have everything on teacher's list.<eos> Jackrobat, pig rat, jumbo pig rat, my hand.<eos> How did that get in here?<eos> Just need that bug and we're done.<eos> It stinks having so much stuff to do.<eos> And not even fun stuff.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so busy, what with my private not dying lessons after this.<eos> Now, you find this strange, possibly dangerous fruit.

Sure.<eos> The way of the slak is a gift to us all.<eos> It solves everything.<eos> Have boring chores to do?<eos> The slak teaches us, don't do them.<eos> [Eep] Stressful afterschool activities?<eos> Like, yawn.<eos> [all shout] [Eep] Don't do 'em.<eos> [Thunk] Tired?<eos> Instead of walking, you guessed it.
[muttering continues] What?<eos> That's never not worked before.<eos> Okay, um...<eos> You covered yourselves in goo?<eos> I like to think the goo covered itself in us.<eos> A-ha! Come on, think, Grug.<eos> The answer's in your head somewhere.<eos> Just gotta knock it out!<eos> Is that it? Nope, just a bug.<eos> You seem stressed, Dad.
Is that it? Nope, just a bug.<eos> You seem stressed, Dad.<eos> Of course I'm stressed.<eos> On top of hunting and the family, now I'm Valley leader.<eos> Everyone's counting on me, and all this extra thinking I've been doing takes a real toll on my head.<eos> We know how you feel.<eos> [Ugga] Grug?<eos> Grug, honey.<eos> [all gasp] Oh, yeah.<eos> You were supposed to stop them, not join them.
[grunts] We're stuck.<eos> Who knew covering ourselves with purple goo could have a downside?<eos> I know. We'll use our arms.<eos> [groans] They're all weak from not being used enough.<eos> Yeah. Also, mine were pretty weak to begin with.<eos> You know, I'm starting to think that all this slakking wasn't a great idea.<eos> Or rather, it was a great idea with a bad part that we didn't think of.<eos> [Eep] We did it!<eos> Now, let's move.<eos> How'd you get clean?
That's why I prefer close friends, ya know? Close friends? [gasps, yells]<eos> Class, today I'll show you how to handle a buzztle nest with the help of my volunteer, Shouty.<eos> [pops, buzzing] [screams] How did I not see this coming? [yelps] I wonder if my pit pal sent me any more messages.<eos> I should go check. - [screaming continues] - [gasps]<eos> So as you see, not one sting... on me.<eos> [groans] [mumbling]<eos> Now that I've shown you how to avoid getting stung with one weird trick,<eos> Oh, who, me? [screams] It gets better after a while, but then, it gets way worse, so you kinda break even in the end.<eos> There you are. Why didn't you come home after school?<eos> I thought you'd been eaten or at least chewed up a little. Eep?
You were right.<eos> I was too caught up in my pit pal. And I should've paid more attention to my close pal.<eos> [gasps]<eos> And her creepy lizvult stalker. [both chuckling]<eos> "This has been great, but I need to take a break from messaging to spend more time with my close friends." Hmm. I understand, but hope to keep in touch with you always.<eos> I told you, Belt, she's real. She's not fishcatting me.<eos> [sighs]<eos> This girl seems so cool.<eos> Da-da-da!<eos> You always say that.
Mommy, yeah. [sighs] [mutters]<eos> Don't judge me, Sandy. You know you wanna see Gran's treasure, too.<eos> [babbles]<eos> All right, Thunk, let's settle this once and for all. Get counting.<eos> Okay, I'll just start at the top wrinkle and work my way down.<eos> I don't believe it. Just give it to me straight, boy.<eos> I can take it.<eos> Ah, who am I kidding?<eos> No, I can't. Keep your mouth shut.<eos> No, it turns out you don't have tons of wrinkles.
Ah, who am I kidding?<eos> No, I can't. Keep your mouth shut.<eos> No, it turns out you don't have tons of wrinkles.<eos> You have one big wrinkle covering your whole body. [gasps] One wrinkle?<eos> [hoots]<eos> Thunk, do you know what that means? I'm only one moon old.<eos> Why, I'm practically a baby.<eos> No wonder I like being carried around.<eos> Uh, that can't be right. I'm older than that.<eos> - You're way older than...
- You're way older than...<eos> - I'm... one... moon... old.<eos> Now let's go.<eos> Baby Granny's hungy.<eos> Yes, Grandmother.<eos> Gran's death gift has gotta be down here. Dah-hh!<eos> Egg marks the spot! [squeals]<eos> I don't care what Mom said. She treats us like babies.<eos> [Sandy grunts]<eos> Okay, you're a baby, but I'm not.

Ugh!<eos> I should've just made "don't" your middle name because you're always walking right into... [rumbles] trouble. [gasps]

You gotta cut it.<eos> But... what if I cut your vine?<eos> I can't.<eos> You were right.

- [grunting] [giggling]<eos> Later.<eos> I got plans for you first.<eos> My dad had a saying.<eos> "Do it yourself or die trying."<eos> And he always did do it himself.<eos> Well, except that one time.<eos> You guys aren't even listening.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we are.<eos> You said a bunch of words.
- [Eep] About time.<eos> So, take out all your seeds, you know, so you can show me how.<eos> [both scream] [in slow-motion] No!<eos> Yes!<eos> Our seeds!<eos> Oh, I feel naked without 'em!<eos> What's gonna happen to us if we can't quicktogram for help?<eos> Oh, I know, I know. I'll quicktogram someone to ask.<eos> Wait.<eos> - [screams] - [whimpers] Sometimes, you are a good parent. Sometimes, you're the best parent.

I did what I had to, to get back to my family.<eos> My family.<eos> [Eep] Things sure changed after we lost Dad.<eos> Like, I started wasting my time, hanging out with Old Man Root.<eos> Without a strong male role model,<eos> Thunk got his head stuck in a hole and never came out.<eos> And the less said about Sandy, the better.<eos> - [growling] - No!<eos> I must get out of here.<eos> You're not slowly eating me today!
Thunk got his head stuck in a hole and never came out.<eos> And the less said about Sandy, the better.<eos> - [growling] - No!<eos> I must get out of here.<eos> You're not slowly eating me today!<eos> What's that?<eos> Quicktogram for help?<eos> But I don't have any seeds.<eos> No, Blue, I can't.<eos> You're my best friend.
[hisses] - No, I say! - [groans]<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> You'll put the whole valley at risk.<eos> When super bugs hatch, they breed like crazy.<eos> Day one, they jump from person to person.<eos> Day two, the whole valley's got 'em.<eos> Day five, everyone goes mad from itching'.<eos> Day seven, there's an avalanche for some reason.<eos> But, by day 17...<eos> Well, you'll beat the Broods, but at what cost?
But, by day 17...<eos> Well, you'll beat the Broods, but at what cost?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I get it.<eos> Yeah, that gibberish makes total sense.<eos> [chuckling] I cannot wait to see the looks on the Broods' faces.<eos> They'll be like, "Ooh!"<eos> And... ♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪ Wait.<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> Munk, get out of here!<eos> No, you get out of here, you big kook.
[screaming] [screaming continues] What's going on?<eos> We heard yelling.<eos> What?<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Now, go inside the cave and don't come out.<eos> - [scoffs] Because reasons. That's why.<eos> [screaming continues] Munk, I can fix this.<eos> No need to panic.<eos> And if you must panic, can you do it a little quieter?<eos> Let's try that old saying, "You catch more bugs with soogar."
This!<eos> This?<eos> [whining] Hey, uh, now, it seems like you're just throwing stuff at me to see what sticks.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> - It's okay, buddy.<eos> We tried. - [whining]<eos> - Hug? - Whoa-ho!<eos> No touching.<eos> In fact, the only good news is, you haven't made contact with anybody else today.

Munk, what did you do?<eos> [scoffs] You just had to go see the hunters while I was using the bushes.
Ooh, hey, what's this?<eos> This looks promising.<eos> I think it's working.<eos> It's all over now, you smug super bugs!<eos> Don't move, thief, or I'll nail ya.<eos> Whoa, easy.<eos> It's me!<eos> [chuckles] Crazy story. Uh...<eos> Some bugs of the super variety may or may not have escaped.<eos> - You...
Eh, really not sure why I kept that around.<eos> - Oh, fine, I'm a hoarder. - [buzzing]<eos> - [screams] - [screaming] - Mama!<eos> - Uh... you keep working on that cure, okay, buddy?<eos> Ooh, guys, things seem better up here, hmm?<eos> Or worse.<eos> Looking like worse.<eos> [grunts] Poison ivy sweet relief compared to agony of super bugs.<eos> [sighs] [gasps] Today's top story: super bugs.<eos> Should you be worried?
Grug dead man!<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> Ah, that's good.<eos> [chuckles] Wait again!<eos> I'll fix this.<eos> Old Man Root, buddy.<eos> Gee, what a mess we've gotten ourselves into, huh?<eos> You're right.<eos> It's my mess.<eos> I should've listened to you.
Anything to help the valley.<eos> And, hey, if it turns me into a pigrat like those guys, I can live with that.<eos> [all cheering] Either way, buddy, I forgive you for releasing the super bugs.<eos> I know you never imagined all of this would happen.<eos> Well, here goes.<eos> - Wait!<eos> - [all jeering] Come on!<eos> I want to find a cure, but... not if it means melting my friend's head.<eos> I got us into this itchy mess, so I will test the cure myself.<eos> [Old Man Root moaning] You gotta rub it in.

Wow!<eos> The itching stopped!<eos> You're a genius, Root!
Just take this rock and go for it.<eos> Doesn't seem completely dreadful.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> You get another.<eos> Okay, how many points is that worth?<eos> - [growling] [grunting]<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> Go!<eos> Get 'em!<eos> - [grunting] - You lowered your shoulder too much!
Okay, how many points is that worth?<eos> - [growling] [grunting]<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> Go!<eos> Get 'em!<eos> - [grunting] - You lowered your shoulder too much!<eos> There.<eos> I win.<eos> That's now how it works.<eos> Pfft. You said this was fun.
They're not really at their best in water, but I pushed him in and so it's too late to change it now.<eos> Teacher Squawk, is this necessary?<eos> I know we hurt your feelings, but...<eos> Hurt my feelings?<eos> When?<eos> Oh, when you pretended to be my friends, then stomped on my heart till it was dust?<eos> I'd forgotten about all that.<eos> Now, into the death hole with you!<eos> [grunting, screaming] [students] Teacher Squawk!<eos> Teacher Squawk, are you okay?
You're not my friends.<eos> You're just some children I torment from time to time.<eos> Everyone, link up.<eos> We've got a teacher to save.<eos> Teacher Squawk, here.<eos> Got it!<eos> Pull us up!<eos> You saved me.<eos> Even after I was gonna chuck you in that pit and tell your parents you all got lost on a field trip.<eos> We may not be your friends, but you're our teacher.
It's settled.<eos> Squawk Junior and I will be best friends forever.<eos> And as for our final?<eos> Do we still have to take it today?<eos> No.<eos> School's cancelled.<eos> I've got a best friend to play with.<eos> You'll take it tomorrow.<eos> Oh, Junior!<eos> Oh, you.
Mmm! Thanks, Eep's mom!<eos> I mean, mold's okay and everything, but this is meat and it's so good!<eos> Moldy meat would be good.<eos> Lerk grew up in total darkness, so she sometimes forgets people can see her when she eats.<eos> - Please pass the water.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Oh, whittled sticks.<eos> The water was even good today.<eos> Yeah, yeah, it reminded me of that happy fruit I ate that one time.<eos> You mean that fruit that made you see things and think we were all... [hissing]
- Yeah.<eos> Better test it to make sure.<eos> - No, Lerk, no!<eos> It'll make your mind all weird... er.<eos> Who did this?<eos> The Broods?<eos> But we defeated you.<eos> Once and for all, I assumed.<eos> Oh, don't you know the saying?<eos> When you assume, you make an enemy for life!
- Oh, that's not food.<eos> Hey, as Valley leader, I demand you return our food this instant.<eos> - [chikuna clucking] - Don't you cluck at me.<eos> Wait.<eos> Stop 'em.<eos> Everyone.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I didn't drink any water.<eos> I'll get our food back.<eos> Will you be okay?
Then we'd be in serious trouble.<eos> Cave people, relax.<eos> The monsters are not real.<eos> You have nothing to fear.<eos> [roaring] [screaming] [sighing] I've failed my people as leader, haven't I, Talking Hole?<eos> Sure have, Gruggy, my man.<eos> We need a new leader to get us through this.<eos> Someone bigger and smarter.<eos> But mostly bigger.<eos> Like you.
But mostly bigger.<eos> Like you.<eos> O merciful giant, I yield to your immense bigness.<eos> Behold our new giant leader!<eos> [all] All hail the new leader!<eos> Talking Hole has a bad feeling about this.<eos> We need to distract them with this.<eos> Now to resume eating the food that I can only assume is still there.<eos> ♪ Whose bravery runs through and through? ♪<eos> ♪ It's the one and only you... ♪
Now to resume eating the food that I can only assume is still there.<eos> ♪ Whose bravery runs through and through? ♪<eos> ♪ It's the one and only you... ♪<eos> Sorry.<eos> Think they heard us?<eos> [Blurg] I think I heard them ask if we heard them.<eos> I smell Eep.<eos> And I wanna say sweaty hair.<eos> I will find you, Eep.<eos> You too, Sweat Hair.
Lerk!<eos> Stop it.<eos> Classic Eep.<eos> Too humble to take a compliment.<eos> No.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Stop singing and talking to worms and getting your head stuck in trees.<eos> Okay, sorry.<eos> Last one, I promise.<eos> - Look, you're my best friend... - [giggling]

No.<eos> You're as right as you are awesome.<eos> I'll cool it with the Lerkiness.<eos> [monotone] I feel nothing.<eos> Let us walk home.<eos> Which way is home again?<eos> O great massive towering leader, please show us the way to peace.<eos> Uh, did I miss something, people?<eos> Why are you bowing to a baby?<eos> Our leader says you need a sitter.
How uninteresting.<eos> Hm. A worm.<eos> How uninteresting.<eos> [groaning] Lousy darkness.<eos> We're going in circles.<eos> Hm. A worm.<eos> How uninteresting.<eos> Let us keep walking.<eos> Preferably in silence.<eos> Wow. Lerk, you are crushing not being you.
Also, a winged cheetah will come save us at any moment.<eos> Okay, so not that moment, but I did say any moment.<eos> It could come at a different one.<eos> Like this one!<eos> Thanks for trying, but I guess we can't weird our way out of this.<eos> [laughing] Lerk, your crazy idea, it worked!<eos> If you thought that was crazy, wait till you see how I ride.<eos> On, Nightbreaker!<eos> Yeah!<eos> How are you...
Hoorah.<eos> Lerk, that was amazing!<eos> I'm sorry I asked you to crank down your youness.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> We all need more Lerk, not less.<eos> [gasping] Really?<eos> Aw! That calls for a song.<eos> It sure does.<eos> ♪ Who's the bestest, tell me who ♪<eos> ♪ It's the one and only you! ♪
Let's get Logan to do it.<eos> I don't care if the closest neighbor is a mile away, I want to talk to them.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Detective Hale, can I interest you in a bear claw?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> My wife won't allow me to touch sweets, but, I have a 100mile rule.<eos> Whenever I'm more than 100 miles from home, I can eat whatever I want.<eos> My weakness is Boston cream.<eos> Great, I'm happy that I know that now.<eos> What do you want?
You have a history with the hybrids.<eos> Ten years ago, you were on an island facing down razorbacks before the rest of the world - knew they existed.<eos> - Really?<eos> I think you got some bad intel there.<eos> Detective, please, I'm well aware of your former life.<eos> Fine.<eos> Still not interested.<eos> Tarapoto, Peru.<eos> That's where your teammates will find the next hybrid they're looking for.<eos> And how the hell did you know about that?
I don't need you going all Kill Bill on her ass.<eos> Jamie?<eos> Logan, I got her.<eos> Southwest staircase, heading up.<eos> Mitch.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> That's the least of the things I know.<eos> Okay, wait.<eos> Uh, b-before you do that, let's, uh, let's talk this out.<eos> You're bound by the edicts of the old order, but I'm going beyond.

This is for Elizabeth.<eos> I need you to look at a body.<eos> Okay, uh, Mr. Cooper, are you ready?<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Raymond notified me that the bureau may require my assistance.<eos> You're wanted for crimes ranging from kidnapping to murder.<eos> We are not offering you a deal in exchange for your assistance.<eos> Understood.<eos> You're targeting me because I'm targeting Raymond.<eos> You targeted Donald Ressler.
Well, Donald was the public face of the manhunt for Raymond when he was on the run with Elizabeth Keen.<eos> Everyone in my world knows Donald Ressler.<eos> We're here to make a deal with you.<eos> If there's a deal to make, I'll make it with agent Ressler.<eos> Yeah, that's not happening.<eos> During the manhunt, I watched agent Ressler's press briefings.<eos> He was smug, arrogant, and professional.<eos> You, my friend, just seem smug and arrogant.<eos> You may go.<eos> - Listen, pal, you don't get to decide who stays, who goes.
Okay, Julian?<eos> I shot a secret service agent because of it, and they've been holding me.<eos> That's where I've been.<eos> Do not doubt me.<eos> You got that?<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> Elizabeth Keen.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Burning in hell, for all I care.<eos> Who are you?
What the hell is going on with Bank Rheinfelden?<eos> Confirmation of the funds transfer.<eos> For what it's worth, I can assure you there have been no security breaches on our end. In the event Mr. Reddington would reconsider--<eos> He won't reconsider.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yes. Yes. Von Hauser is gone, which is unfortunate, but indicative of nothing.<eos> I can assure you the passage is safe and the documents are clean.<eos> I've got Rice on the line.<eos> He's--<eos> Your only risk is if you step out now and your clients end up with inferior material or worse yet, end up in custody.
Phillip Roque.<eos> I understand he used to be your driver.<eos> If I get to him, I get to Kaplan.<eos> Can't help you.<eos> Can't or won't?<eos> Seems this Mr. Kaplan pays well.<eos> I'm told that Roque recently bought a Porsche.<eos> That's all you know?<eos> No.<eos> That's all you need.
Hell yeah, I confirmed.<eos> My apologies for the forced introduction, Mr. Prescott, but I require some information.<eos> On November 19th, 2015, your services were engaged to pick up a package in dupont circle.<eos> I need you to tell me the exact disposition of that package.<eos> I don't need to tell you anything.<eos> Come now.<eos> If you don't give me the information I've requested, it'll all be over.<eos> What are you gonna do? Shoot me?<eos> I don't have to.<eos> To be effective, people like you must operate from the shadows.

That's not easy.<eos> I see.<eos> Then we've wasted your time and ours.<eos> I do wonder what else Donald's men will find in your nightstand.<eos> Are you a vibrator kind of gal, Laurel?<eos> We'll see.<eos> If I do this, you don't mention me and reven Wright in the same sentence again.<eos> Say it.<eos> Deal.<eos> Not you.
- I'm... I don't need to explain myself.<eos> Your wife promised Isla I'd be kept on.<eos> This is a Christian household.<eos> - I don't understand. I...<eos> - Have you listened to that?<eos> - Some of it.<eos> - So, Isla's nine.<eos> We were talking about harmony.<eos> It's filth.<eos> And you're a hypocrite.
He needs power but...<eos> - We all need power.<eos> - But this guy's different.<eos> The thing with the brain, he's overdoing it.<eos> More than power, he needs to be admired.<eos> And you hold a press conference to tell him how much you admire him?<eos> Look, I'm talking about saving lives, OK?<eos> By giving him what he craves, we satiate him for a while.<eos> Maybe long enough to give us an advantage.<eos> And you get what you crave.
If you saw someone, maybe they put it there after you'd gone.<eos> I didn't see anyone.<eos> Wait there.<eos> Do you believe her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Am I off the case?<eos> I'm going to let her go, but I strongly recommend she does not leave the area.<eos> Right.<eos> DCI Quigley, am I...<eos> What are you at this moment?
- No.<eos> D.C.I. Quigley released you on condition that you stay in the area.<eos> But you will catch him.<eos> Won't you?<eos> If they give me the chance.<eos> Good of you to join us.<eos> I'm early.<eos> Our man on license, Leighton Thomas, who knows about him?<eos> Three people... myself, Chief Inspector Smilie, and his probation officer.<eos> You socialize with him.
I bet they didn't give their name.<eos> But why would someone do that?<eos> Some people think I'm damaging the local economy.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I tell the truth.<eos> I tell tourists there is no monster.<eos> I wish that was the case.<eos> Why don't you just lock me up?<eos> Listen, I know what I was, and I know who I am now.<eos> What were you?
I don't know.<eos> No, wait.<eos> It must have been my phone.<eos> I couldn't get a signal, so...<eos> You teach classes, as well as run the college?<eos> Yeah, I teach whenever I can.<eos> I still love it.<eos> I interviewed some of your students about their practical joke.<eos> Okay.<eos> You encourage them?
These premises will have to shut until Food Standards get here.<eos> Food Standards see that, it's game over.<eos> Their call.<eos> Some idiot let it out the Wildlife Center.<eos> What's it got to do with your investigation?<eos> What, he's your mate, so I should turn a blind eye?<eos> You still operate like that?<eos> You report this, he's finished.<eos> I'm not going to do that.<eos> You are.
I'm married to one.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I suppose we all have our crazy beliefs.<eos> What are yours?<eos> Your husband?<eos> Come to save me.<eos> I'm D.S. Redford.<eos> Right.<eos> - Blake Albright...<eos> - I know who you are.
And D.S. Redford's last case involved the theft of an inflatable Nessie.<eos> You know Dr. Marr sacked Niall Swift the morning of his murder?<eos> D.S. Redford got the information from his daughter.<eos> - Her local knowledge...<eos> - We better bring him in, then.<eos> - The point I'm making is...<eos> - I know the point you're making.<eos> Her daughter and her pals left the bones on the beach.<eos> Until I'm convinced they know nothing about the heart, D.S. Redford is compromised.<eos> Plus, you fancy her.
Leighton Thomas, Petrie, Marr.<eos> I want to know why Petrie needs a locked room.<eos> Look.<eos> Page opposite the crossword.<eos> Can you see that?<eos> Yeah, sort of.<eos> If we can get that enhanced, we could have the killer's handwriting.<eos> His first mistake.<eos> Tell him about your encounter with Nessie.<eos> I'm still gonna live here when you've fucked off.
- No, no, no, no, no.<eos> - It's not been confirmed.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> I want him gone! Do you hear?<eos> I had no idea he was...<eos> Hijacked that for his own agenda.<eos> Supposed to be restricted bloody parking!<eos> This is Loch bloody Ness we're talking about!<eos> Thanks to Albrighton, you're going to be operating
Sees his sister's face in every victim.<eos> My advice, get rid.<eos> Bring in somebody with two feet on the ground.<eos> - Before you go into...<eos> Looks like it was parked by the blind one from Peters and Lee. - Who?<eos> - Doesn't matter who.<eos> Sort it out.<eos> I make one call, forget promotion.<eos> - You don't dump this on me.<eos> - You brought him in here.

Are you here about the newspaper?<eos> Yes.<eos> We're in the middle of processing it.<eos> Is it working?<eos> You can enhance the letters?<eos> Are you police?<eos> Hm. I read one of your books.<eos> So you know how important it is that I see the process.<eos> That way you get the credit you deserve.<eos> You are full of shit.
Light the blue touch paper and run like fuck.<eos> My boss has just been on the phone.<eos> He wants you gone. But he's left it up to me so he's got deniability.<eos> Call me as soon as you get this.<eos> You said you might have found something to link the heart to the Swift murder.<eos> Might have.<eos> A number of tests are being rerun.<eos> The blood in the bag didn't match the brain.<eos> What does it match?<eos> What I'm hearing, your psychologist bod is being a dick, Frank is waving the claymore, and you are piggy in the middle.

You don't play piano, do you?<eos> No.<eos> But you did know Niall Swift?<eos> Have you any idea the damage you've done?<eos> I've just been to see Ken and Nicole Patterson.<eos> You not give a thought for their feelings before spouting off?<eos> A reporter asked me a legit question.<eos> - I answered it.<eos> - Wasn't your job to answer it!<eos> I've still got to live here when you've fucked off.
Restart the plane.<eos> Mitch?<eos> Mitch, do you copy?<eos> Restart the plane.<eos> Mitch?<eos> The master switch is still in the off position.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Manual restart required.<eos> This is a story you're all too familiar with, isn't it, Jackson?<eos> You failing to save the ones you love.
This is why I believe you could never have an Indian Bond villain.<eos> 'Cause Bond villains are always eating or drinking something while they say some genuinely badass shit.<eos> "Greetings, Mr. Bond.<eos> You should not have come here today.<eos> Tonight you die."<eos> "Bonsoir, Monsieur Bond.<eos> We have been expecting you.<eos> Tonight you die."<eos> Indian food.

We'll be back to take you to Belle Reve after we finish off the robots.<eos> You will be finished, supers!<eos> Ooh-ooh!<eos> Ooh-ooh!<eos> Ooh-ooh!<eos> Nice work, Blackfire.<eos> That was some pretty great super-heroing, Batgirl.<eos> Hello?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Oh, you're still alive.
"Yes, I know everything you're telling me."<eos> "Daffy Duck told me that when I was a little kid.<eos> I know all about how gold is valuable."<eos> There's one that I don't understand, but it's kind of...<eos> It's called "reverse mortgage."<eos> I had never heard of one of these things.<eos> It has a guy on it, and he goes,<eos> "I'm a guy..." And I want to tell you about reverse mortgages.<eos> "You've probably never heard of them, but you all know what a mortgage is."<eos> "That's when you and your loved one," you get together a grubstake - you know, a little bit of money - and, by God, you put it down on a piece of land or a house, you know?
- My son was imprisoned too.<eos> - Says your son died - of a heart attack.<eos> - There's something - they're not telling me.<eos> - That kid? He didn't just up and get in a fight without good reason.<eos> - You don't know what you talking about.<eos> - Look, are the guards corrupt? - No!<eos> He just died! - I need Mike to drop that case.<eos> - You telling me to go back on my word because your client's bullying you?
- What kind of best man would I be if I didn't offer for you to have it here?<eos> - Pretty shitty one, if you ask me.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - You sure he's not in?<eos> I hate to walk in on the man in his tighty-whities.<eos> I don't think Harvey wears tighty-whities.<eos> - Oh, Jesus Christ, Rachel.<eos> I don't wanna think about what the man wears.<eos> - Well... what do you think?<eos> - This is great! If you're a... Bachelor pushing 50 and you need to impress women.

Bachelor pushing 50 and you need to impress women.<eos> - No, no, no, no. - What are you doing?<eos> - Don't go in his fridge!<eos> - Rachel. The man gave us his keys.<eos> Trust me. He knows we're gonna go through his shit.<eos> - So basically you came here to look at what he eats and to say that this is a "no" for the wedding.

He knows we're gonna go through his shit.<eos> - So basically you came here to look at what he eats and to say that this is a "no" for the wedding.<eos> - Of course it's a no.<eos> - But the fact is... why are we even talking venue at all when you don't even have a date?<eos> - We're gonna get around to that.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Just like you... got around to the announcement?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your mother said that she arranged for a photographer, but you cancelled.
- Your mother said that she arranged for a photographer, but you cancelled.<eos> Same with the florist.<eos> - What's going on? - Nothing is going on.<eos> Mike and I are both really busy getting our careers off the ground right now.<eos> - Rachel, that's just it.<eos> If you can't focus on your wedding, how are you gonna make time to focus on your marriage?<eos> - Now, that's why you came here, isn't it?<eos> To give me sweet advice like that.<eos> - Well, that, and to tell the mighty Harvey Specter I took his toilet bowl for a test drive.<eos> - Dad... you're not doing that.

She was working for me on Delta Securities, - and I need her back.<eos> - Okay, Louis, I'm not getting her back.<eos> What kind of message does that send<eos> - to the other associates? - Better than the one we're sending out now which is that this firm<eos> - is a Goddamn joke. - Louis, you need to calm down right now before this goes in the wrong direction, 'cause this isn't about Stephanie.<eos> This is about Tara and the fact that you<eos> - haven't been dealing with her. - This has nothing to do with Tara.<eos> This is about Harvey running this firm into the ground.<eos> - And how exactly has he been doing that? - Let me run it down for you. - I'm pissed at him.<eos> Mike's pissed at him. And the last time I saw you, you were pissed at him.
- And how exactly has he been doing that? - Let me run it down for you. - I'm pissed at him.<eos> Mike's pissed at him. And the last time I saw you, you were pissed at him.<eos> So instead of telling me that you're not gonna hire Stephanie back, why don't you go tell the lord God almighty that if he is not careful, he's not gonna have a kingdom to rule over anymore!<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Harvey, I'm sort of busy, so if you're here to shoot the shit...<eos> - I'm here to give you this.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - It's my way of saying thanks.<eos> - For what?<eos> - You know what.
- with Alex, Harvey.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Sure?<eos> - Good. Yeah.<eos> - All good?<eos> - You should go.<eos> - Let me guess.<eos> You're bored being C.O.O., you miss me, and you want back on my desk.<eos> - I never want back on your desk, Harvey, and I'm here to tell you that your honeymoon as Managing Partner is over.<eos> - Is this about me not calling a vote after you undermined me in that meeting?
- You sure?<eos> - Sure?<eos> - Good. Yeah.<eos> - All good?<eos> - You should go.<eos> - Let me guess.<eos> You're bored being C.O.O., you miss me, and you want back on my desk.<eos> - I never want back on your desk, Harvey, and I'm here to tell you that your honeymoon as Managing Partner is over.<eos> - Is this about me not calling a vote after you undermined me in that meeting?<eos> - I'm gonna let that go because you need to understand that right now

- No.<eos> - No. Harvey, my advice is to give a big piece of new business to the person least likely to let anything go.<eos> - Louis.<eos> - Nine times outta ten.<eos> - I can't just manufacture that overnight.<eos> - Harvey, do you remember that time we poached Trotter Systems from Zane?<eos> - That was a prearranged deal?<eos> I worked my ass off to get Trotter.<eos> - You did.<eos> - And you completely forgot that you were pissed at me about some bullshit neither one of us can remember anymore.
- The truth is, Harvey, you don't need to come to me anymore. You just do it 'cause you miss me.<eos> - Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> - Yeah. But I only have a few minutes.<eos> I have court.<eos> - I met with my dad at Harvey's apartment this morning.<eos> - Don't tell me. - He said a bachelor pad is no place for his special little girl to celebrate the biggest day of her life.<eos> - Well, Mike, you have to admit the only reason that we changed it from the Plaza in the first place was because we didn't want the attention.<eos> But now that you're a legitimate lawyer... we don't have to worry about that.<eos> - Rachel, it's okay.<eos> - I just want you to be happy.

- Rachel, it's okay.<eos> - I just want you to be happy.<eos> - So you're not mad. - Not at all.<eos> - Good.<eos> Because now that it is at the Plaza,<eos> I called and made an appointment with the wedding team for us to go over some menu options.<eos> - Wait, wait, wait. - You made an appointment in between when I said it was okay a second ago and now?<eos> - Yeah, y-you didn't just notice me do that?<eos> - It was crazy fast!<eos> - You're fast.
- Yeah, y-you didn't just notice me do that?<eos> - It was crazy fast!<eos> - You're fast.<eos> - Mike, seriously, I appreciate you being so understanding.<eos> The appointment is tonight at 7:00.<eos> - Rachel, I have a meeting tonight with my pro bono, and I can't put it off.<eos> Can you do this one without me?<eos> - Of course I can, but I wanted us to do it together.<eos> - Rachel, listen to me.<eos> I know you... right?
- Rachel, I have a meeting tonight with my pro bono, and I can't put it off.<eos> Can you do this one without me?<eos> - Of course I can, but I wanted us to do it together.<eos> - Rachel, listen to me.<eos> I know you... right?<eos> You're gonna have a thousand questions. You're gonna want to narrow down the choices.<eos> I promise you I will be at every other meeting.<eos> - Okay. - I'll take care of it.<eos> - All right.<eos> Love you. - Love you, too.
The guard says they had to call him.<eos> I asked for surveillance video to see if he was already there.<eos> They said they can't disclose it because it would violate HIPAA rules.<eos> - Shit. - What about surveillance - of the parking lot?<eos> - They're saying - that footage is gone.<eos> - Then they're definitely<eos> - hiding something. - But I can't prove it.<eos> And if I don't get something,<eos> - Listen, Oliver, like I said, I can't discuss this case.<eos> What but what I can tell you is that if you can convince someone that you already have something, that's the best way to get them in the room.
Louis, whatever you're doing to keep Delta Securities, take a breath.<eos> I need you to listen - to what I have to say.<eos> - Oh, I'm done listening to you.<eos> You wanna manage this firm into the ground, you go right ahead.<eos> But when your bullshit puts one of my biggest clients on the block, that's when I'm done playing good soldier.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> - Bratton's not just coming after our clients... they're trying to divide and conquer.<eos> - What are you, Caesar now? - This isn't the Roman Empire.<eos> - I don't care what it is.<eos> - You think it's a coincidence they're forcing you to close on one of your clients while suing one of mine for patent infringement?
- and play to your strengths.<eos> - Pass! - Look, I get it... - You don't want Harvey's help because you're mad at him.<eos> But the least you can do is to go Alex.<eos> He came from Bratton.<eos> - He knows their playbook. - I don't need their playbook. And he's the reason they're coming after us<eos> - in the first place. - Okay, Louis, do it your way. But you better be good and ready, because Bratton knew enough to come after a client you almost lost a year ago and to sue mine for something<eos> I don't know anything about. Which means they've got someone inside this place telling them what to do.<eos> - Louis, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> - No, you can't, because right at this moment...<eos> - I know, you're gonna meet Delta Securities.
I don't know anything about. Which means they've got someone inside this place telling them what to do.<eos> - Louis, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> - No, you can't, because right at this moment...<eos> - I know, you're gonna meet Delta Securities.<eos> And Harvey already made it clear you don't want my help trying to keep them.<eos> - But I have something...<eos> - No buts, Alex. I don't want your help.<eos> I don't want whatever you have,<eos> - because I don't trust ya. - Trust me? What the hell<eos> - are you talking about? - For all I know, you were the one who gave Bratton the inside information on us in the first place.
- This is Alex Williams, our newest senior partner, and he was just stopping by.<eos> Alex... - I'm not just the newest senior partner, Tim. I'm also the partner that Bratton Gould just lost.<eos> - Your Honor, they entered into a fee-waiving partnership agreement yesterday with a company that's suddenly claiming infringement against one of our clients today.<eos> - Your Honor, their client caused real damages.<eos> - If that's true, those damages will still be there in eight weeks, which means the only reason you'd be upset right now is if this action is nonsense.<eos> So which is it...<eos> Eight weeks or drop the case?<eos> - Morelli's expense reports for the last three years.<eos> The guy spends more time in Vegas than David Blaine.<eos> And now you know.
Thinking it's time I got a raise.<eos> - Easy, tiger.<eos> Mike, seriously,<eos> I thought you were busy with that pro bono.<eos> - I am. Donna said you needed my help, so... I gave it to you.<eos> - Thanks, Robin.<eos> - Ah, you're welcome, Batman.<eos> - Louis, really... - you didn't have to do this.<eos> - What, are you kidding?<eos> You saved me after I was an asshole.
- Thanks, Robin.<eos> - Ah, you're welcome, Batman.<eos> - Louis, really... - you didn't have to do this.<eos> - What, are you kidding?<eos> You saved me after I was an asshole.<eos> - You didn't have to do that. - Yes, I did.<eos> Because I don't care how you acted.<eos> We're all in the same boat now.<eos> - I guess we are.<eos> Boy, you really... have no love for your old firm, do you?
- If I'm being truthful with you, I was never gonna get where I wanted to be as long as I was there.<eos> - Name partner.<eos> - Name partner.<eos> - You know, I thought of leaving Pearson Hardman - at one point.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - No, it's the truth.<eos> I even got a headhunter and everything.<eos> - I thought you loved it there.<eos> - I do. Doesn't mean that I didn't feel unappreciated and overlooked.<eos> - I find it hard to believe anyone could overlook you.

- Okay. - What's going on?<eos> - Harvey took a chance on me, Rachel.<eos> He went out on a limb, and now I have been promoted to a position that people think I'm not ready for.<eos> - I didn't mean it when I said that.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - But if one of the first things I did ends up giving Bratton a roadmap to picking this firm apart, I will never forgive myself.<eos> And Stephanie might not talk to you, but I know she won't talk to me.<eos> - Okay. I'll go see her, Donna.<eos> - Anything else you want me to fix for you - before I get back to my case?<eos> - I'll let you know - after I see Louis. - What do you mean?
- Anything else you want me to fix for you - before I get back to my case?<eos> - I'll let you know - after I see Louis. - What do you mean?<eos> - I mean if he couldn't stop Bratton from poaching his client, us doing what we just did<eos> - But you said Louis made it clear he doesn't want your help.<eos> - He may not want it, but if that shit's not taken care of, he's getting it whether he likes it or not.<eos> Louis, before you jump down my throat again...<eos> - Relax, Harvey, I'm not upset with you anymore.<eos> In fact, I even came to an agreement with Alex after he locked up Delta Securities.<eos> - Good. - What about you?<eos> Do you need my help with your lawsuit?
- He may not want it, but if that shit's not taken care of, he's getting it whether he likes it or not.<eos> Louis, before you jump down my throat again...<eos> - Relax, Harvey, I'm not upset with you anymore.<eos> In fact, I even came to an agreement with Alex after he locked up Delta Securities.<eos> - Good. - What about you?<eos> Do you need my help with your lawsuit?<eos> - It's taken care of.<eos> - Don't tell him I said this, but Mike jumped inside his phone booth and put on his Superman outfit.<eos> - Oh, that's great.<eos> - So I guess... this means there's only one thing left for you to do.

I see you got your own office.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I know that you didn't feel valued at Pearson Specter, and I wanted to apologize for my part in that.<eos> I wanted you to know that it was never my intention to get you fired.<eos> - I hope you're not here to offer me my job back.<eos> - And what if I said I was?<eos> - I'd say I wouldn't take it.<eos> - in that case, I am here to find out if you're giving your new firm privileged information.<eos> - Let me get this straight.<eos> You have... the nerve to fire me and then come here and accuse me of breaking attorney-client privilege?
- I'd say I wouldn't take it.<eos> - in that case, I am here to find out if you're giving your new firm privileged information.<eos> - Let me get this straight.<eos> You have... the nerve to fire me and then come here and accuse me of breaking attorney-client privilege?<eos> - How else is your firm getting so much information<eos> - on our on-going cases?<eos> - You think I'm the only person with a grudge against your firm?<eos> Harvey Specter declared war on this place long before I got here.<eos> And not only am I not giving them information, they don't need my help, and they didn't ask for my help.<eos> - Just to be clear, Stephanie, you've lied to me before.
And not only am I not giving them information, they don't need my help, and they didn't ask for my help.<eos> - Just to be clear, Stephanie, you've lied to me before.<eos> And breaking attorney-client privilege is a dis-barrable offense, and if we find out that's what's been<eos> - happening here... - No, Rachel, I didn't lie to you.<eos> Like you said, I used a loophole.<eos> 'Cause I'm a good lawyer, and I'm also an ethical lawyer.<eos> So if this firm is getting inside information from Pearson Specter, they're not getting it from me.<eos> - Hey, Mike, wait up.<eos> - Oliver, what are you doing here?<eos> - I was just waiting for you so we can grab that beer - like we talked about.
Trust me... it wasn't her.<eos> - Rachel... look, I didn't mean that stuff that I said before about not caring about your appointment. - I know.<eos> - Well, did you make it?<eos> 'Cause I'd hate to think you missed it for nothing.<eos> - I'm walking in right now.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> Hi. I'm so sorry.<eos> Rachel Zane.<eos> - Deborah Kaplan.<eos> Did my assistant give you the wrong time?
- Oh, he's doing great.<eos> 'Cause we just shut down your pathetic assault on our firm. - Is that so?<eos> - You're Goddamn right,<eos> - that's so. - Then might I ask what exactly<eos> - are you doing here?<eos> - We're here to tell you that if you try this shit again, the same thing's gonna happen, only next time, we won't just play defense.<eos> We'll hit you with a tortious interference suit in the neighborhood of a billion dollars.<eos> - Well, you better get ready, 'cause next time... starts right now.<eos> What, are you kidding?<eos> You already threw everything you had at us once. - Didn't make a dent.

Lawyers grow on Goddamn trees.<eos> I want my clients back, and I want the 30 million in billables that come along with them, hand-delivered... by you.<eos> - That's never gonna happen.<eos> - What do you think, Harvey?<eos> Do you think that's "never gonna happen"?<eos> - Like I said, whatever you throw at us, we'll throw it right the hell back.<eos> - With what manpower?<eos> You wanna pick a fight with a little regional law firm to flex your muscles, go ahead.<eos> But we're five times your size.<eos> This is a fight you started. And this is a fight that you cannot win.

- happened to other people? - It's not a feeling.<eos> It's an instinct that comes from working on hundreds of cases like this.<eos> And if you take this deal, you're never gonna get the answers you want.<eos> You'll never know what happened to your son.<eos> - And I have another son and two daughters, and this changes their lives.<eos> - Mr. Reyes...<eos> - Are you telling me that you can prove they had something to do with my son's death?<eos> - Yes. I believe - that Oliver can get enough to...<eos> - No, not Oliver. You.<eos> Because you're the one who took my case,
- And I have another son and two daughters, and this changes their lives.<eos> - Mr. Reyes...<eos> - Are you telling me that you can prove they had something to do with my son's death?<eos> - Yes. I believe - that Oliver can get enough to...<eos> - No, not Oliver. You.<eos> Because you're the one who took my case,<eos> - I told you, - there was a conflict.<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> - Then listen to me right now.<eos> I know that you know my parents died in a car accident. But what you don't know is that after they did, a lawyer... came to my grandmother and made her an offer.
It's about stopping other people like him from dying.<eos> And I think it can be done, but... even if it can't... we gotta try.<eos> - Tell them no.<eos> - Harvey, how'd it go? - Listen to me.<eos> I didn't think it mattered before, but they've got someone feeding them inside information. I need to know who it is.<eos> - I'm already working on it, Harvey.<eos> - Good. 'Cause this is your chance to prove to everybody I made the right decision giving you that promotion.<eos> Robert. - We need to talk.<eos> - From what I hear, you need to spend less time talking and more time looking over your firm.<eos> - And you said if I needed help doing that to let you know.
- Tell them no.<eos> - Harvey, how'd it go? - Listen to me.<eos> I didn't think it mattered before, but they've got someone feeding them inside information. I need to know who it is.<eos> - I'm already working on it, Harvey.<eos> - Good.

- We already used that line of credit last year when we expanded the 42nd floor. - Harvey, what the hell are we gonna do?<eos> - I don't see a way out of this.<eos> - I have a way out.<eos> - I'm not giving up your clients, Alex. I do that, I might as well let you go.<eos> - Then let me go, because I'm not gonna be responsible for driving you in the ground.<eos> - No, I'm not gonna do that.<eos> - Why the hell not?<eos> - Because you're one of us now. - And I agree.<eos> Well, what are we gonna do?<eos> - You're gonna go back to finding out who's feeding them inside information, and you two are gonna figure out who they're coming after first.
- Because you're one of us now. - And I agree.<eos> Well, what are we gonna do?<eos> - You're gonna go back to finding out who's feeding them inside information, and you two are gonna figure out who they're coming after first.<eos> And I'm gonna figure out how to beat this son of a bitch.<eos> - Mike, hey.<eos> - How'd it go? - He turned the offer down.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> - I thought you'd be disappointed.<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> - You were right.
Oliver, this...<eos> - There's only one problem.<eos> I don't have the resources to handle this alone.<eos> - Oliver, we've been over this.<eos> I signed an agreement that said I wouldn't touch it. - I can't cross that line.<eos> - Jesus Christ, Mike.<eos> You're telling me you care more about some piece of paper you signed than about these men's lives?<eos> - No, I don't, but I signed it.<eos> Which means if I get involved and they find out, the case gets tossed, and Oscar gets nothing.<eos> - You lived a lie for years. - You're telling me you can't keep a secret about working one Goddamn case?

I am not giving up you or your clients.
- Because whatever it is, he's got the same damn thing on you.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> You should have told me this before. - I couldn't.<eos> - You never would've hired me.<eos> - I meant when they started coming after us.<eos> - I was hoping I wouldn't have to use it. - Well, now I do. - What is it?<eos> - I can't tell you.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - As long as I don't tell you, you're not party to it.<eos> I'm not gonna expose you like that.
- That's not good enough.<eos> - You go over there and do this, you sure as hell better make it work.<eos> - All right, good.<eos> - We'll wrap this up tomorrow.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - I was wondering when you'd come crawling back.<eos> - I'm back, but I'm not crawling.<eos> I'm here to tell you you're backing the hell off my firm.<eos> - I know what you're here to do, but let me ask you this.<eos> Does your firm know what it is that you did?

What you did.

What you did.<eos> - I let this shit go, and it comes back and hits you in the ass.<eos> You're gonna sign something saying I had nothing to do with this.<eos> - I already did.<eos> Just like I also prepared something for you to sign saying you won't so much as look at any of our clients for the next ten years.
- It's on you now.<eos> - Yes. It is.<eos> - Is it done?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - I think you probably went in there and said something like, "You're gonna drop these lawsuits<eos> "and you're gonna forget about coming after any of our clients."<eos> And he said, "Our clients? Don't you mean my clients?"<eos> - And I said, "No, motherfu... er, I don't.<eos> "Because I'm at Pearson Specter now, and he's not getting my clients."<eos> - You're twice the man he is, Alex.

You are one of us now.
- So you don't wanna have it at the Plaza anymore?<eos> - No, that's not it.<eos> - Mike, what's wrong with us?<eos> We can't even find the time to keep one appointment.<eos> - Rachel, come on, our schedules are crazy right now.<eos> - And that's exactly what I told my dad when he brought it up.<eos> - Brought what up?<eos> - He said that if we can't make time for each other right now, how are we gonna make time for our marriage?<eos> - Hey.<eos> You are the most important thing in my life.
- That means that I care about what I do too.<eos> And right now I gotta go take care of something that I should have taken care of before, but... when we get home, we're gonna crack open a bottle of wine, and we're gonna talk all night<eos> And then we are gonna pick a date.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> - Harvey, I know you're coming in here to... - I came over here to tell you that it's over.<eos> Why don't you go home and get some rest?<eos> I know you've been working around the clock on this thing.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - You promoted me.

I let you down.<eos> - Donna, you haven't let me down in 12 years, and you didn't start now.

I let you down.<eos> - Donna, you haven't let me down in 12 years, and you didn't start now.<eos> Besides, whoever it was... doesn't matter anymore.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - It was you, wasn't it?
You called Tommy Bratton and gave him the roadmap to me and Louis, and I wanna know why.<eos> - If you figured that out, - then you already know why.<eos> - I want an answer.<eos> - You came to me saying that your house was divided.<eos> And whether you like hearing it or not, Harvey, nothing unites a divided house<eos> - That doesn't mean you pick up the phone and call him.<eos> - I didn't call him. - He called me.<eos> He was coming anyway, Harvey.<eos> All I did was mention that...<eos> I didn't like the way I was treated on my way out the door, and if he wanted to get to you, he should play you against Louis.
- Well, look who it is. - What are you doing?<eos> - Just getting ready for trial tomorrow.<eos> - It never stops, does it?<eos> - What's that?<eos> - The work of being a lawyer.<eos> - Doesn't mean you can't make time for... - The more important things.<eos> I set a meeting with the planner at the Plaza.<eos> It's gonna be wonderful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Aw, you don't have to thank me, Rachel.

- Aw, you don't have to thank me, Rachel.<eos> All I want is for your wedding to be exactly what you want.<eos> - And what I want is gonna take some time, because, Dad, you were right.<eos> I want to... enjoy it and make time for it.<eos> So Mike and I are gonna set a date, but it's not gonna be for a while.<eos> - Well, it doesn't matter when it is. As long as you're happy.<eos> - Good. Because there's something else I wanted to say.<eos> I heard this idea of a fake merger - between us was floated.<eos> - Let me guess.<eos> You think I should have helped Harvey out. - No.

Don't hurt them!<eos> They don't understand!<eos> Who's she talking to?<eos> I believe she's exhorting Satan not to take revenge on us, which I suppose is almost commendable, for a witch.<eos> Perhaps I'll say a prayer for her.<eos> A small one.<eos> I know it's not your fault, but... if you can hear... they don't know what they're doing.<eos> Be better than them.<eos> Please!<eos> Are you Mr. Tepes?
If I was that kid, I'd be like, "We have to stop them."<eos> And I'd be outside there protesting.<eos> So, I went outside, and I just wanted to say hi and show a warm, friendly face to baby murderer.<eos> And I said, uh, "Hey, hi.<eos> Isn't it great...?<eos> I just wanna say, isn't it great that we live in a country where I can put on this show because it's something that I believe in, and you can protest this show because of what you believe in,<eos> and we can occupy the same space peacefully?"<eos> And he said, "God, you're totally right."<eos> I'm just kidding.<eos> He goes, "You're going to hell."
That's true.<eos> And you know what that means.<eos> That means that sperm is life.<eos> And you know what that means.<eos> We've gotta legislate that shit.<eos> We have to protect the babies.<eos> I... I just wanna save the unborn babies.<eos> That's all I'm worried about, and this is what we're gonna do.<eos> The next time you feel like you're gonna jerk off into a gym sock or down your shower drain or, uh...<eos> I don't know why, I peg you as an "on the belly" guy.
The next time you feel like you're gonna jerk off into a gym sock or down your shower drain or, uh...<eos> I don't know why, I peg you as an "on the belly" guy.<eos> It doesn't matter, though.<eos> It doesn't matter. Whatever your jerk-off style, there is no judgment here.<eos> I was right, wasn't I?<eos> I have a sense.<eos> If only that was a superpower that could help the world. But...<eos> This is what we're gonna do. Before you do jerk off, whatever style it is...<eos> I feel like keeping going.<eos> Like... you are like a hands-free fucking the mattress.
And under that it said, "L/H."<eos> And my dad didn't know what that meant. But he was too embarrassed to ask anybody.<eos> So, he just used his logic, and he's like, "Okay.<eos> It comes after bathroom, so it must mean... 'loose or hard.'"<eos> So, for a summer... my dad had his campers come get him... after they took shits... so that he could go look at them... and make a rough guesstimate... if it was indeed loose or hard.<eos> I love that so much.<eos> It just means there's, like, a generation of old men in therapy... who are like:<eos> "Well, I did have a camp counselor that was, like, obsessed with my shits.<eos> Is that...?"<eos> You were sexually abused.
I pulled my hand out and then I, like, served it to John.<eos> And then, another time, like, my hands were tied down.<eos> That I served it?<eos> And then, um... He was like:<eos> In my mind.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Oh, another time...<eos> I was told, a nurse was in the room, and I, somehow, like, even though I had no mouth or hands, but I, like, made it clear to her, like, it was an emergency. I had to tell her something. And they had given me paper and a pencil.<eos> And I'm writing, and it's, like, so important.<eos> And I finally finish, and then I show it to her, and she looks, and it just says, "Do you live with your mother?"
It's okay.<eos> I raised my hand voluntarily.<eos> What did you say your name was?<eos> Troy?<eos> - Troy.<eos> - Oh, okay. That's fun.<eos> All right, Troy.<eos> I'm dying to ask this question.<eos> I'm so excited there's a God person here.<eos> All right, you're a Christian.
No.<eos> That's mind-blowing to me.<eos> And yet not unique.<eos> Not a unique answer, I'll tell you that.<eos> I would say the answer has to be yes.<eos> Um, but I will tell you that as I've been touring the country, 80 percent, at least, of men say no, like Troy.<eos> So, congratulations on not being unique.<eos> And yet being wrong, in my opinion.<eos> That is, uh, so petty, I think.<eos> You know, it's like, up until now, Troy, you're saying, "God... I know that there's AIDS and rape and famine and genocide and murder.
- Where?<eos> - Home.<eos> Jillian... nobody outside the Pentagon knows about this,<eos> - and if word got out... - Screw you.<eos> Who is this?<eos> A friend... with the same agenda.<eos> Atlas.<eos> Check the message.<eos> All roads lead to Tanz.<eos> Who are you?
Is the president going to give a statement to the American people?<eos> When the president has something to say, she'll say it.<eos> What alternatives are being considered, Grace?<eos> All options are on the table.<eos> We returned from London at 0700 hours this morning in possession of a rare crystal needed to reconstruct a new fullscale EmDrive.<eos> Which will propel a gravity tractor to the asteroid in time to divert it?<eos> It's a bold move, Harris.<eos> And done without my advice - or my authorization.<eos> - Sometimes, it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.<eos> You taught me that, sir.
- Thank you, Claire, but I don't need to be schooled in my job duties.<eos> I'd hardly call you objective when it comes to Grace.<eos> And, Harris, if she doesn't have an outstanding reason why she left this key piece of information out of her debrief, not even you will be able to protect her.<eos> For a country that outlawed religion not so long ago, there's a hell of a lot of churches around here.<eos> You're sure this is the right one? Yeah.<eos> When I visited last year, she took me here.<eos> Grace.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Darius Tanz.<eos> I know who you are.
That is the question.<eos> I always say if you have to ask, you probably need one.<eos> Something bad's going down, otherwise Harris wouldn't risk outing himself to Zoe.<eos> You've never talked to her about Harris?<eos> Not until last night.<eos> So, you've gone public with it?<eos> To a point.<eos> Not Calhoun or Claire.<eos> I feel privileged to be among those in the know.<eos> You don't like him.
Do they have fountain soda?<eos> 'Cause I don't like cans.<eos> Yeah, this is it.<eos> - I love it, yeah.<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> But my point is, if I got an indoor ball... a woman's ball... and I was at the top of the key, I'd sink more threes.<eos> Yeah, but we're not allowed at that Y anymore.<eos> No, but I'm saying if...<eos> Look, you don't have...<eos> You can go in disguises to any place you want, if you know what you're doing on the hard court.
Look, you don't have...<eos> You can go in disguises to any place you want, if you know what you're doing on the hard court.<eos> - I'm nervous about tonight.<eos> - Why? 'Cause we're filming it for the TV thing.<eos> I'm gonna get high before... ♪ Tonight when I chase the Dragon ♪<eos> - It's show time! - It's show time!<eos> [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Lyceum Theater.<eos> Unfortunately at this performance, the roles of Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland will be played by Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland.<eos> Let's do Broadway.<eos> I'll see you after the show.

I know you.
You guys are the reason we do this show!<eos> But we will be making eye contact solely with the orchestra.<eos> We are gonna have so much fun tonight because theater is the hot, new thing right now.<eos> There's Hamilton and no other examples.<eos> Now, speaking of theater being hot, you'll notice that we are filming the show tonight.<eos> Yes. You see cameras all over the place.<eos> We're filming this as a special for Investigation Discovery.<eos> No, it's for Netflix.<eos> It's a binge-watch. It's a binge-watch.<eos> You watch an episode of a show, then you wait a week, and then you binge-watch another episode.

Some of our accolades:<eos> We are the recipients of a 1997 restraining order.<eos> Keeping us 100 feet at all times from America's greatest actor,<eos> Mr. Alan Alda.<eos> Alan Alda, double A, beep, beep!<eos> "Get off my property!"<eos> But who are we really? You know?<eos> What is our essence?<eos> How to describe?<eos> You know when you get to the bottom of a tub of hummus. And you can't fit your carrot in there, so you gotta use your fingles to scoop it out?

But I've made the most of my living as a voice-over artist.<eos> I was very nearly the official voice of CBS.<eos> Yes he was... I'm sorry, I did not mean to interrupt you, but you did such a beautiful audition for CBS.<eos> Would you do for them tonight your CBS audition?<eos> I don't know if the audience wants to hear it.<eos> I was gonna do it regardless, you know.<eos> This was my audition for CBS.<eos> Charmed, I'm sure, this is Gil Faizon represented by Don Buchwald Associates. Reading for the role of CBS.<eos> This is CBS, baby!<eos> Fun and flirty, but am I nuts, did you do like a second alternate take?

It's a buffalo chicken wrap.<eos> - It's so cold...<eos> - It's 90 percent romaine lettuce.<eos> It's a cold wrap, a warm Sierra Mist, - it's on a Saturday, it's 900 dollars. - Yeah...<eos> It really is, it really is, OK.<eos> This is take two, Gil Faizon, charmed, I'm sure, formerly represented by Don Buchwald and Associates, reading for the role of CBS.<eos> CBS?<eos> [high pitched] All right!<eos> Perfect!<eos> And let me say something, I am like, Raven-Symoné level upset that you did not get that job.

You are the strongest actor in New York?
And those that understood English, it was like, they didn't like it.<eos> Most of our plays had been mounted in hospitals, or kill shelters or as a skit during break at AA.<eos> Which is why it is such an honor to be here tonight.<eos> At the Winter Garden Theater!<eos> No, no, the Lyceum Theater!<eos> I thought we booked the Winter Garden Theater.<eos> Have you fucking tried dealing with the Shubert Organization?<eos> I mean, this is a historic theater.<eos> Liza Minnelli mounted her iconic Liza with a "Z" on this very stage, directed by the great Bob Fosse.<eos> And if you listen very closely, you can hear in the rafters the ghost of Bob Fosse, snorting Dexedrine and drinking Visine.
Also, we have free Wi-Fi for everyone here tonight.<eos> The network is "Kimpton Hotels," and the password is "guest."<eos> If you have winter hats and coats, put your shit wherever you want.<eos> Treat this theater the way an Ultra-Orthodox Jew treats an airplane.<eos> Spread out!<eos> That chair is for your hat, baby.<eos> Perhaps you didn't have time before the show to eat at Guy Fieri's Great American Garbage Fire.<eos> - Eat food in the theater.<eos> - Eat a meal during the play.<eos> Even if you're like a Jamaican nurse, and you brought your dinner in a big weird Tupperware.

Thinking they'll make less noise, whereas this will make so much more noise.<eos> Really, indulge the crinkle as you undress your Swedish Fish, the Lamborghini of the gummies.<eos> Or perhaps you brought yourself a Werther's Original, the AMBER Alert of caramels.<eos> Now, those of you familiar with our oeuvre, which means eggs, will recognize this play. It's a little more autobiographical than our other plays.<eos> - That's right.<eos> Oh, Hello.<eos> - Oh, Hello.<eos> We draw on 70 years of a life lived.<eos> A first job, a second marriage.<eos> When you open your cab door into a city biker as a silent protest against Mayor De Blasio.

George's daughter?<eos> Her head ended up where?<eos> - Are they talking...<eos> - I'm on the phone, I'm on the phone, man.<eos> OK, yeah, I'll tell him.<eos> Oh, charmed, I'm sure.<eos> Hey, George, my friend of all friends.<eos> Look at me!<eos> I have awful, simply horrible news, but that was a one-sided telephone call!<eos> [airhorn sounds] [applause] You are so stupid.
He's not well.<eos> That guy is sick as a dick.<eos> - Audiences like to be screamed at.<eos> - Correct.<eos> The backbone of contemporary American theater is screaming stuff.<eos> For starters, it wakes the audience up towards the end of the third act.<eos> But also it reveals things from the past.<eos> My father was my brother and that's why we can't go to lunch today.<eos> Do you want to know why?<eos> Do you want to know why, Karen?
Do you want to know why?<eos> Do you want to know why, Karen?<eos> Because I could not afford Adobe Photoshop!<eos> My baby.<eos> My chair baby.<eos> He killed you.<eos> Why?<eos> That is of course, from Ionesco's Chairs.<eos> Let's talk endings.<eos> I like when a character says something mildly significant, and then the lights dim, and you're sitting in your seat, you're like...
May I demonstrate one of these awful dim lights?<eos> - Porcupine please.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Is there a center mark for me to stand?<eos> OK, that'll do.<eos> Ravi, can you write a "G" on that so I know it's for George and not Gil?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ravi, hit me with the spotlight.<eos> By the way, Ravi, way too loud with the intro music. Way too loud.<eos> You bring the house to half, then you do the announce.
- Yes. I like when a play ends just a sentence.<eos> That naturalistic thing, where the playwright is trying to say, there's no good dialogue in real life,<eos> - Mother, may I?<eos> - Speak in plain, child.<eos> Oh, waiter, I'll have one more root beer, please.<eos> Man... [laughter and applause]<eos> I got the chills.<eos> I got the chills.<eos> [yelping in delight] - I got the chills.<eos> - You got the chills, man?
Man... [laughter and applause]<eos> I got the chills.<eos> I got the chills.<eos> [yelping in delight] - I got the chills.<eos> - You got the chills, man?<eos> You got the chills, are you sick?<eos> No, I got the chills from your magnificent performance.<eos> - Though I do have pneumococcal pneumonia. - All right.<eos> You know, I have mesothelioma.<eos> How did you get it?
That made it a billion times worse right there.<eos> We are about to get started.<eos> - No, fucking...<eos> No. - What?<eos> Not in life or in the play ever, ever put your nail in between my nail.<eos> In my fingie meat.<eos> For real, don't ever do that ever again, for real.<eos> - This... That's a protected settlement. - Yeah.<eos> Then I'm Netanyahu, baby!<eos> - 'Cause you're my little Bibi.
I don't know.<eos> George is hung like a hotel painting, in that it's crooked and has seen awful things.<eos> He speaks on the phone.<eos> Well, I'm doing pretty well, considering I'm a 72-year-old novelist, and I live with my best friend Gil and he's an actor.<eos> OK, bye.<eos> Just then, Gil Stone, aged 40, enters.<eos> - Are you sure you can play 40? - [high pitched] Yes!<eos> Gil Stone, aged 40, enters.<eos> He is soaked from the rain.<eos> No matter what health food store you go to,

There like a brush on a tight snare drum.<eos> And the honking of the horns.<eos> Oh! That's like Miles, baby.<eos> And for the subway?<eos> You got yourself a xylophone.
Whoa! The water spray is the fucking strongest part of the show.<eos> Makes my glasses all watery.<eos> Look, I know that, OK?<eos> You know, Mark and Judy came with their adult son last week, they told me they love the water spray.<eos> But Mark and Judy like Stomp.<eos> - You know, I like Stomp.<eos> - I love Stomp.<eos> They bang everything.<eos> It's the new...<eos> You have got to go see Stomp on tour.
You have got to go see Stomp on tour.<eos> - It's the same. - Ah!<eos> So tell me, Gil, how was your meeting today with your agent?<eos> - It was horrible.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I mean, he doesn't get me at all. You know?<eos> I'm a serious theater actor.<eos> He's got me going out for commercials.<eos> Can you imagine me, Gil Stone, hocking Scotch Tape?<eos> There you go again with that artistic integrity.
- I can't do it anymore, George.<eos> - Gil.<eos> - I got to get out of this rat race.<eos> - Be pragmatic.<eos> I walked out of an audition today.<eos> For Clamato, I mean...<eos> We're talking about Clamato, George.<eos> The number one clam/tomato juice operation in the country today.<eos> Some would say the only.<eos> How could you walk out of that?
- It's got to be Steely Dan, right?<eos> Oh, it's a billion percent Steely Dan.<eos> Remember seeing Steely Dan at the Beacon Theater, nine nights in a row?<eos> I love the Beacon Theater.<eos> Oh, the Beacon Theater, it's like the Apollo Theater for people who are scared to go into the Apollo.<eos> Walter Becker from Steely Dan, playing his guitar like he's in the band at the end of a Lunesta commercial.<eos> Donald Fagen on the keys looking like if Ray Charles played the organ at a reformed synagogue.<eos> George, did you know the name Steely Dan originated as a dildo in a William Burroughs novel?<eos> Of course, I know that.<eos> You and I know a lot about Steely Dan.
But we've been living in this apartment for 40 years, paying $75 a month.<eos> It's our God-given right to pay the same amount of rent regardless of property value or inflation.<eos> This is an outrage.<eos> Ravi, I need that chair to shatter.<eos> Let me see this.<eos> "Your rent is being increased to $2,500 a month."<eos> Twenty-five hundred dollars for a measly five-bedroom with office, crown molding, and fireplace?<eos> How much money do I even have on me?<eos> What is this?<eos> "Remember, you have Alzheimer's."
Gil, is there a...<eos> Fucking wait!<eos> Say, Gil, is there a third letter from my publisher?<eos> Maybe if they sent a big enough advance, we don't have to worry about the new rent.<eos> - Give me the fucking letter.<eos> - Just ask for the letter.<eos> - Are we on the same team?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> The '86 Mets.<eos> - You're all right, you know that?
It's true.<eos> He was. He really was.<eos> Flash forward to the oft forgotten and rarely discussed decade, the 1960's.<eos> - Ravi?<eos> - Cue music.<eos> Ravi, music.<eos> [music starts]<eos> [George] Ravi, goddammit! Late!<eos> Late! Ravi, late! Excuse me.<eos> As soon as he says "1960's," you come in fast with the groovy music.

- Oh, a peace, Oh, hello.<eos> - '60s peace Oh, hello to you.<eos> Marijuana.<eos> I just heard about this really groovy new apartment on 73rd Street.<eos> - You want to be room mates?<eos> - I do want to be room mates, new friend.<eos> But I should warn you, I may have to move out soon, 'cause I'm engaged to this girl who will not shut up.<eos> Well, I should warn you that I am afraid of raccoons.<eos> These guys are crazy, they got these little shoulders and that big belly like a furry jar, you know?<eos> Watch out, raccoons, they'll steal your food, but next thing you know, they'll steal your heart.

- I know it is.<eos> We modeled it after...<eos> Well, it's Chris Christie's gunt, is what it is.<eos> I don't know if you saw when Chris Christie wore a baseball uniform, but he really squeezed into it just like that.<eos> I wish the audience could see what I'm seeing.<eos> It's like the Kandinsky is painted on two sides.<eos> Yeah, it's a Kandinsky.<eos> Pretty smart, huh, Steve?<eos> The play and the painting.<eos> Do you like tuna fish?

It was a one-man show, though.<eos> It was a one-man show called The Color Purple where I just wear a cock ring.<eos> And then remember when I directed that version of Bye Bye Birdie sponsored by Grindr called Bye Bi-Curious.<eos> Maybe Steve would help us out with our Terri Schiavo musical.<eos> - You mean You Snooze, You Lose?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Let me get the phone.<eos> [laughs] [mock sobbing] Oh, hello?<eos> The head of New York One?<eos> That's who you are.

Lisa is pregnant and it's my raccoon baby.<eos> You didn't wear any protection?<eos> She said she was on the pill.<eos> Think back, did she?<eos> It's possible that I just saw her eating Advil out of a puddle.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Kill her, skip town?<eos> No!<eos> I'm gonna marry her, George!<eos> But you're Jewish and she's a raccoon.
That's like every New Yorker cartoon pushed together.<eos> - I'm happy for you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> It's just, I've never had money before and I want some.<eos> There's things I want to buy.<eos> [melodramatic music] Things I've never told anyone about before.<eos> Like what, George?<eos> I want to lease on all-new Kia Sorento.<eos> I want to buy a ThunderShirt.<eos> It's a shirt you wrap around a dog who's freaking out, and the dog stops freaking out, for the most part.
Oh, George, I had no idea.<eos> How can I ever tell anyone?<eos> Growing up in my family, boys didn't lease Sorentos.<eos> 'Cause Kia wasn't a car brand yet.<eos> It's such a recent brand.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> All right, I'll do Too Much Tuna on New York One with you.<eos> All right, Gil...<eos> But wait a moment.<eos> You're so quick to leave the park.
But wait a moment.<eos> You're so quick to leave the park.<eos> Is everything OK with Lisa?<eos> George, I just got a text message.<eos> It turns out that Lisa is a possum with a burglar mask on!<eos> - Again?<eos> - Thrice!<eos> Thrice I've been doped by false possums.<eos> Cheer up, Gil, 'cause we're gonna be on New York One.<eos> The channel that comes on automatically when you restart your cable box.

Mother, Father.<eos> Mother, Father.<eos> And baby?<eos> We see a tuna baby, we must go to it.<eos> We go to care for our tuna baby, but... [tuna laughs]<eos> The baby is demonic. The baby is possessed by the devil like when Mia Farrow had that evil child.<eos> - Soon-Yi?<eos> - Correct.<eos> After a solid Soon-Yi burn, we run.<eos> - Gil, where are you?

George can finally afford to fly JetBlue Mint from JFK all the way to LaGuardia.<eos> And Gil fulfills his life-long dream of trying biscotti, and it is not worth it.<eos> George re-enters in a look that can only be described as pussy safari.<eos> We are now on the set of the corporate and successful Too Much Tuna.<eos> God, people treat me so differently now that I'm famous.<eos> It's like suddenly, jewelry stores do have a bathroom I can use.<eos> Hey, what's up, everything?<eos> - Hey, space grandma.<eos> - Oh, hi.<eos> Oh, good you got the craft services that I like.
Jesus! It's that new girlfriend of his.<eos> She's helping him do the cocaine.<eos> - 'Cause he ain't got no arms.<eos> - Who, Tony?<eos> - No, he's a sandwich with eyeballs.<eos> What?<eos> No, New York One, please, that's unacceptable.<eos> What?<eos> This isn't a cellphone?<eos> Did you hear what New York One is gonna do to our show?
- No, he's a sandwich with eyeballs.<eos> What?<eos> No, New York One, please, that's unacceptable.<eos> What?<eos> This isn't a cellphone?<eos> Did you hear what New York One is gonna do to our show?<eos> They want to turn us into clam show called "That's A Lot-o Clamato"?<eos> Which is a terrible title.<eos> I would call it, "You Got Clam Juice, You White Trash Idiot."<eos> George, uh, I don't know if you remember but I said, I got to be Gil, I got to get out of this rat race.
- Hold?<eos> Shit!<eos> Matthew, no. Don't come out.<eos> We're on a hold.<eos> What's the hold?<eos> I got to go to the bathroom.<eos> - No, you're gonna hold it.<eos> - I've been holding it since Steve Martin.<eos> Please. Please, do not do this to us, OK?<eos> You're an adult.
- I've been holding it since Steve Martin.<eos> Please. Please, do not do this to us, OK?<eos> You're an adult.<eos> You can control your bowels.<eos> No, it's getting pointy.<eos> Can we just take an intermission?<eos> No!<eos> No fucking intermission!<eos> They ruin the flow of the show.<eos> Would you stop the Super Bowl halfway through to do a bunch of bullshit?

Come here.<eos> Did you just take a shit in your show corduroys?
Did you just take a shit in your show corduroys?<eos> Did you just take a shit in your show corduroys?<eos> No!<eos> Goddammit!<eos> We don't have doubles of those!<eos> Lights, Ravi.<eos> What?<eos> George Reddington wouldn't call for the lights.<eos> I am not George Reddington anymore.<eos> I am George St. Geegland and you are Gil Faizon, and this is over because you ruined it!

No, I'm just delirious.<eos> I'm so sick.<eos> That's not gonna work on me.<eos> I know that's sheep dog blood.<eos> OK, if I were you, I would just drop this right now.<eos> How can I drop this, George?<eos> It was a life-changing opportunity for me.<eos> Just drop it, before I have to start screaming revelations.<eos> - I can handle it.<eos> - You booked it!

And I took the message and I lied to you!<eos> I lied to my best friend and I loved every second of it!<eos> Is that what you wanted to hear, huh?<eos> You wanted to hear how fucked up I am inside?<eos> Which take?<eos> - Why does it matter?<eos> - George?<eos> At least do me the service of telling me, which take the CBS higher ups responded to?<eos> The first or the second, George?<eos> Only because I know how much you appreciate feedback.

You go too big.<eos> You've always gone too big.<eos> You would have embarrassed yourself.<eos> - And I was protecting you.<eos> - Protecting me, from what?<eos> I'm the strongest actor in New York, your words.<eos> I was lying to you, Gil.<eos> You thought you were the strongest actor in New York?
I was lying to you, Gil.<eos> You thought you were the strongest actor in New York?<eos> There's like seven guys ahead of you.<eos> - Name one.<eos> - Bobby Cannavale, Stanley Tucci,<eos> Oliver Platt, Liev Schreiber,<eos> Vincent D'Onofrio, Nathan Lane, Griffin Dunne.<eos> No, excuse me.<eos> Griffin Dunne is not New York-based.<eos> What the fuck did you just say?
Vincent D'Onofrio, Nathan Lane, Griffin Dunne.<eos> No, excuse me.<eos> Griffin Dunne is not New York-based.<eos> What the fuck did you just say?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, 'cause the last time I checked,<eos> Griffin Dunne lived in Rhinebeck and could be in Manhattan in an hour and 15 minutes!<eos> And every fucking casting director in town knows it, so how dare you pretend not to?<eos> How dare you fucking pretend not to know where goddamn Griffin Dunne lives?<eos> No. No.<eos> George, if you... [groans]
Thanks for coming to the show.<eos> It's nice you guys are holding hands like that.<eos> You don't have to stop holding hands.<eos> My guess is, you made the choice to hold hands a long time ago, and then you're like, "How do we break this holding hands thing?"<eos> Bye.<eos> I look out in the crowd, I thought Dr. Ruth was dating Bill Clinton.<eos> Goodbye, thanks for coming. Sorry.<eos> Goodbye. Steve, an honor, truly.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - How old are you?

Oh, my sweet Juliet hath died.<eos> I shouldn't check to see if she's just sleeping.<eos> I guess I'll kill myself too.<eos> Nobody else says it, but Shakespeare is a fucking hack, all right?<eos> Yes, hello, ASPCA?<eos> Hi, I was wondering.<eos> Who do I call, if I know an adult man who fucks raccoons?<eos> Oh, that's what 3-1-1 is for? Oh, OK.<eos> ♪ I just met a raccoon named Lisa ♪<eos> Hey, young lady, you're 14?

'Cause a bunch of the play...<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Hey, Ravi, what are you doing after the show, you want to hang out?<eos> We could go to your dorm room at NYU Tisch and talk about gender fluidity.<eos> [Gil] Oh, no.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> [George] The original 1964 Fiddler on the Roof curtain.<eos> [Gil] Have we owned this the entire time?<eos> [George] Faizon.<eos> Random to see you here.
Random to see you here.<eos> [Gil] What's up, G St. G, how's your phone call?<eos> They were good.<eos> Made a lot of friends in the audience.<eos> There's no one out there for me.<eos> The world just passes me by.<eos> Like I have a clipboard for gay rights.<eos> Yeah, well the band 311 called me and said I can't fuck raccoons anymore.<eos> This play is a disaster.<eos> You realize the audience doesn't even know who Steely Dan is.
Here, help me make amends.<eos> It's never too late.<eos> - Ravi, hey, it's George.<eos> - And Gil, charmed I'm sure.<eos> Ravi, we were just talking.<eos> I hate to think that what I thought was our funny banter, ever came off like racist abuse.<eos> If it did, we're simply so sorry.<eos> Would you please lift the Fiddler curtain?<eos> [both] Thank you.<eos> Ravi, you're a good dude.

Like when your housekeeper brings her son.<eos> Gil and George haven't seen each other in many years.<eos> Gil's been hanging out a lot more with Tony Tuna these days.<eos> Even though Tony's in and out of rehab, but...<eos> Gil doesn't judge him.<eos> 'Cause I'm the one selling him the cocaine.<eos> Oh, no, that's OK, waiter.<eos> I bring my own chair places.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Has anyone ever told you that you look an awful lot like Gil Stone?
Yeah, I get that sometimes. [chuckles]<eos> - George?<eos> - George Reddington.<eos> - We were... - [both] roommates for 40 years.<eos> Tony Tuna is here.<eos> He's got a mustache now.<eos> To show that time has passed.<eos> Wow, Gil Stone.<eos> Hey, you remember all those years ago when we confronted Matthew Broderick who's still waiting right behind that door.<eos> And look at you now, you're in Hollywood and you're a big star.

But me?<eos> You, you're the number one novelist in America.<eos> I guess my young adult vampire series, Skateboard Dracula is doing pretty well.<eos> Pretty well, 15 million copies in one day ain't too shabby.<eos> Yeah, but most of those teens only bought the book because in it, I explained how to make a bomb.<eos> - Is that your new novel?<eos> - This?<eos> No.<eos> A new play I'm working on.<eos> Frankly, it's about me and you.
Well, I'll have two more root beers, please.<eos> Ravi in the booth.<eos> Mr. Steve Martin.<eos> Great.<eos> That was great.<eos> - Could you get us a couple of slices?<eos> - Get one for yourself.<eos> - Pizza you want?<eos> - Pizza is nice.<eos> You want pizza?
P.C. Denny?<eos> According to your statement, your wife dropped you at college at 8:00 a.m.<eos> Lots of witnesses.<eos> You were there till 5:00.<eos> And then you walked to town for a meditation session?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I run guided meditation sessions twice a week.<eos> The well-being of the town is important to me.<eos> A year ago, Jonjo tried to set fire to a classroom.<eos> The governors wanted to expel him, but you intervened.
- Look, mate.<eos> I only ever do this when I need a favor.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I need a bit of advice.<eos> Wee fiberglass issue.<eos> What do you think... replace or repair?<eos> To be honest with you, mate, I'm not too sure.<eos> It'd be cheaper to repair it, but if you want a proper job, replace it.<eos> We've watched some of your counseling sessions with Jonjo Patterson.<eos> You told him his mental-health issues were due to the repression of his desires.

Get the alibi for Leighton Thomas verified.<eos> - Absolute priority.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He's enjoying this.<eos> You wanted in.<eos> You're in.<eos> Got Niall Swift's phone records.<eos> Looks like he had Petrie on speed dial.<eos> Mr. Petrie, I'm a criminal psychologist helping with...<eos> I know who you are.
Don't let the bastard get to you, Blake!<eos> Why did you let him in?<eos> !<eos> Shit!<eos> If I complain, they'll just increase the dose.<eos> Do you regret that you didn't do more to help?<eos> Kind of, yeah.<eos> It's no secret that Baxter's behavior towards you has been concerning to staff.<eos> He thinks it's funny.<eos> Well, imagine for a moment that it was you, that you were able to fight back.
I was treated like shit.<eos> I was assaulted in one of your interview rooms.<eos> - I'll take it from here.<eos> - Ah, there she is!<eos> You need to make a statement.<eos> You need to make it clear that I am not a suspect!<eos> - You need to calm down.<eos> - I've just been shot at!<eos> I was out for a run.<eos> And someone was trying to kill me because you have made me a target.
Radioactive isotopes told us its owner was born in 1964.<eos> They also indicated the area in which our missing person grew up.<eos> I want a list of men born on this stretch of the coast in 1964.<eos> The hair found in the van driven by this man matches the heart found on the beach.<eos> This isn't the killer.<eos> I think this is the killer's first victim.<eos> I'm not getting in there.<eos> If I was gonna kill you, do you think there'd be a better place than this?<eos> What did I do to make you hate me so much?<eos> You're sick.
You're sick.<eos> What did I do?<eos> Tell me.<eos> You touched my breasts.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> That was a routine examination.<eos> No, you took too long.<eos> I was being thorough.<eos> You're a pervert.
Things have changed.<eos> This in an emergency.<eos> You're lying.<eos> I can make sure you go to prison.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'm not gonna lie anymore.<eos> I've got a witness in the car.<eos> Her?<eos> You brought her?<eos> - You're not pregnant.
You're pregnant.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I never meant it to get to this.<eos> No.<eos> No, he's lying.<eos> Your daughter needs to go to hospital.<eos> You think I've gone through this for nothing?<eos> That baby is mine.<eos> This was our agreement!<eos> You took advantage.
Answer your phone!<eos> I saw him in the house, I don't know about Dessie's room.<eos> Not exactly...<eos> I got some help.<eos> Stop lying, for God's sake!<eos> You knew what he'd do if he got off the leash.<eos> The evidence was wrong!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This is exactly why I could never tell you.<eos> I will make sure everybody knows how much you fucked this up.
A monster!<eos> Five dead.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You think it's gonna get easier.<eos> It never gets easier.<eos> Mhari Toner's refusing to speak to me.<eos> I need you to talk to her.<eos> Find out what she knew, if she was covering for him.<eos> Her son murdered four people.<eos> You're a mother.
It's Lauren.<eos> Alan, I can't get hold of Evie.<eos> Can you keep trying her for me?<eos> I need to speak to her and Kieran.<eos> It's urgent.<eos> I've just come from your house, where one of my colleagues has been attacked.<eos> One of mine, so I don't want any more bullshit!<eos> Your son stabbed a soldier, didn't he?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you were keeping him sedated, weren't you?
Evie.<eos> Can you identify this person by name?<eos> Okay.<eos> If I get any details wrong, please correct me.<eos> This is your son Jordan Whitehead, 24 years old.<eos> Two years ago, taking his brother's identity, he posed as a 17yearold to gain entry to Lochnafoy College.<eos> Bea.<eos> Listen.<eos> I know what it's like to pray for a second chance.<eos> And that's all you wanted for your oldest son.
This is your son Jordan Whitehead, 24 years old.<eos> Two years ago, taking his brother's identity, he posed as a 17yearold to gain entry to Lochnafoy College.<eos> Bea.<eos> Listen.<eos> I know what it's like to pray for a second chance.<eos> And that's all you wanted for your oldest son.<eos> He'd suffered so much.<eos> And your youngest son had an aneurysm that left him paralyzed.<eos> The doctors said he'd never recover.<eos> And you're looking at two wasted lives.
Niall gave him a lift back from college a few times.<eos> Did they get on?<eos> At first, I think so.<eos> But after his father came back, Jordan changed.<eos> In what way?<eos> He became suspicious of people.<eos> He said Niall's friendship wasn't real... that he just wanted to get inside his head.<eos> Then your other son started to recover.<eos> I didn't know what Jordan would do if his brother woke up.<eos> So you sedated him?
Not really...<eos> I would've run away already but I'm afraid you'll stab me in the butt.<eos> Now, let us see what they have.<eos> What is this?<eos> A storybook about me?<eos> This can only be a wonderful thing and in no way menacing.<eos> Okay, maybe a little menacing.<eos> Once upon a time, a cat was trapped in a book.<eos> Hello?<eos> Where are you?
It means that sometimes I'm going to let you choose what will happen.<eos> And now your first choice.<eos> Choose now!<eos> Will you fight a god, or would that be rather odd?<eos> If so, perhaps you'd rather be in pitched battle with a tree?<eos> Are you kidding? Why would I choose to fight a god?<eos> You choose to fight a god?<eos> So be it.<eos> What?<eos> ! Who are you, Storyteller?
You choose to fight a god?<eos> So be it.<eos> What?<eos> ! Who are you, Storyteller?<eos> I must know.<eos> - I must know your true identity.<eos> - I'll never tell.<eos> Wait, I have to fight a god?<eos> What if I do not want to?<eos> You have no choice.
I have your magic wheel.<eos> Whoa. Oh, no.<eos> Without it, I am powerless.<eos> I know.<eos> Curse you, cat-fox.<eos> Curse you!<eos> I am calling that a victory.<eos> I cannot be beaten.<eos> Oh, no?<eos> You will see, Puss in Boots, that you are at the mercy of my whims.
You will see, Puss in Boots, that you are at the mercy of my whims.<eos> And the only way to escape from this book in which you've found yourself so disastrously trapped...<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Is...<eos> Yes?<eos> To get to... the end!<eos> The end?<eos> The end.<eos> I accept your challenge, Storyteller.<eos> So, Puss in Boots, will you with a giant talk, or will you now be Goldilocks?
I accept your challenge, Storyteller.<eos> So, Puss in Boots, will you with a giant talk, or will you now be Goldilocks?<eos> How can I possibly make such a difficult decision?<eos> I do not want to wear that wig.<eos> But that giant, he looks somehow familiar.<eos> I'm going to say this very clearly.<eos> - I choose the giant.<eos> - Your choice is made.<eos> Fee, fi, fo, fum! I smell a cat and I want some gum.<eos> Toby, why are you a giant?
Your choice is made.<eos> Well, hello, there!<eos> We've got company!<eos> Is that a friend for me to play with?<eos> Howdy there, amigo.<eos> Samuel T. Bearinger.<eos> - My wife, Gladys.<eos> She's a peach.<eos> - Who's my cuddle bunny?<eos> Oh, you simply must play with Sam Junior.
Howdy there, amigo.<eos> Samuel T. Bearinger.<eos> - My wife, Gladys.<eos> She's a peach.<eos> - Who's my cuddle bunny?<eos> Oh, you simply must play with Sam Junior.<eos> Hello, friend for me to play with.<eos> We gonna play horsey rides.<eos> Do not make me the horsey.<eos> You the horsey!
What is this?<eos> What are we doing?<eos> I am not even in this.<eos> I kinda like that.<eos> Obviously I am just messing with you.<eos> I'm sorry, was that not clear?<eos> Fine.<eos> I will watch their ridiculous dancing.<eos> But this must be just as painful for you as it is for me.<eos> Ugh, you're right.
This part is actually pretty good.<eos> I like that.<eos> Well, surely that is it.<eos> You'll let me go now. Yes?<eos> What?<eos> No. This is a book of stories, plural.<eos> You have to get to the end of all the stories to get out.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> Who are you, villain?
You have gone too far, Storyteller.<eos> Magic mirror over there, who's the fairest of the fair?<eos> So we're doing this routine again, are we?<eos> Yes, we are. Because I am vain as well as evil!<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I'm so evil. Like, really evil.<eos> I'm so evil I don't even have my book.<eos> Yes, whatever, fine.<eos> Of course you're the fairest of the fair.<eos> You're always...
Yes, whatever, fine.<eos> Of course you're the fairest of the fair.<eos> You're always...<eos> Ay, chihuahua.<eos> Mama like.<eos> What?<eos> Fairest art thou not, forsooth.<eos> Not pretty as that cat in boots.<eos> We say "handsome."<eos> You must be destroyed!
Not pretty as that cat in boots.<eos> We say "handsome."<eos> You must be destroyed!<eos> I do not want to hurt you.<eos> You're not going to.<eos> Demon wing and hangman's tree, let there now a dragon be.<eos> No matter how bad a day is, it can always get worse.<eos> Aw, is the pretty kitty in trouble?<eos> Handsome!<eos> You're pathetic!
Aw, is the pretty kitty in trouble?<eos> Handsome!<eos> You're pathetic!<eos> You should just go live in a barn and catch mice.<eos> How did you know my retirement plans?<eos> You are nothing but a sad little kitten with an adorable accent and tacky boots.<eos> No one speaks ill of my boots!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> You!

No one speaks ill of my boots!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> You!<eos> What have you done?<eos> That mirror was the source of all my power.<eos> It's not right.<eos> You're fairer than me so you have to die!<eos> Pay no attention to the words of the magic mirror, Dulcinea.<eos> You, my dear, are the fairest I have ever seen.
This guy.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Who is he, anyway?<eos> I do not know.<eos> But I will find out.<eos> This I swear!<eos> Not likely, me Bucko.<eos> And now, I think it's time to give you a choice.<eos> Will you kiss the Evil Queen, or would a handshake be more keen?
Well, the handshake would be more gentlemanly.<eos> But, no.<eos> A kiss.<eos> A kiss would make a better story.<eos> Very well.<eos> Before we do this, there are some things you should know.<eos> Yes?<eos> Yes.<eos> Eh... First, I ate some blue cheese earlier today, so I apologize for my breath.<eos> Second, I am real and you are not.
I demand it!<eos> What?<eos> Oh, uh... Don't bother looking in there.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> You... Wait a minute, this is just a painting.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Well, well, so you've found me, Puss in Boots.<eos> And now you know that I am...<eos> Fartholomew Fishflinger!<eos> It has been you this whole time?
I'm a goody-two-shoes and I don't know my book is dumb.<eos> Uh, I'm Steve and I smell like old dumplings.<eos> Okay, if you knew Steve, that was so totally him.<eos> Wait, when we last fought, you had turned from a mouse into a disembodied soul.<eos> - Why are you back in mouse form?<eos> - Oh, I'm so glad you asked.<eos> It all began months ago.<eos> As my soul floated up from San Lorenzo, I saw before me a...<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> Do you really care, or are you asking out of politeness?
Next time you're at the airport and you step into that Stargate machine, look at the person on the other side and be like,<eos> "I guess Los Angeles, 1984, please."<eos> "Sir, please come out."<eos> "Oh. How long was I gone?"<eos> Do all that. "Sir, you can step out."<eos> "How long was I gone?<eos> Where am I?"<eos> "Very funny, sir.<eos> Please go, get on your flight.<eos> You, ma'am, with the baby formula, why are you here?"
The EmDrive, it works.<eos> Someone here hacked us and killed Lazlo to cover their tracks.<eos> The EmDrive is no longer safe at Tanz.<eos> Neither are you.<eos> Grace, this is Theresa,<eos> Lazlo's sister.<eos> It's Tess.<eos> You can call me Tess.<eos> You were in love with her, weren't you?<eos> God, it was you?

God, it was you?<eos> You're the mole?<eos> You are like the son I never had.<eos> It was Croft.<eos> That son of a bitch, they took everything.<eos> Who?<eos> The Russians.<eos> And then you had the kinetic impact...<eos> Croft!<eos> It was you?

Tell your pilot to follow those, and our contact at MI6 will make sure the Royal Air Force turns a blind eye.<eos> You are full of surprises.<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll be careful.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Putting yourself in harm's way isn't gonna bring Jillian back.<eos> This is your fault.<eos> You brought her here.
I'll be careful.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Putting yourself in harm's way isn't gonna bring Jillian back.<eos> This is your fault.<eos> You brought her here.<eos> I had my reasons.<eos> I don't care about your reasons.<eos> I told you I didn't want to have to lie to her, but you didn't give a crap.<eos> You destroyed us, Darius.

I wish I had somewhere to go to like this where I grew up.<eos> - Where are you from?<eos> - Oh, I don't like to talk about myself.<eos> Why don't you let me push that stroller?<eos> I mean, that's why I'm here!<eos> You're supposed to be relaxing with your friends.<eos> There's a certain way she likes to be pushed and I'm the only one who knows how to do it. It's like this.<eos> I understand.<eos> Every parent has different ways they like things done.<eos> But I think you and Ben are doing a really great job.
We want you to be our sperm donor.<eos> Oh, you guys are going to do artificial insemination?<eos> No, there's... there's no time for a clinical procedure... 'Cause I'm ovulating right this very moment.<eos> Victor, if we are going to have our baby, we need you to have intercourse with Donna tonight.<eos> You think about it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good. Okay.<eos> Bye-bye now.<eos> - Is that you?
- Thank you.<eos> Hello.<eos> - I think I know why you're here.<eos> - Why am I here?<eos> - It's about him, isn't it?<eos> - Him who?<eos> Hello?<eos> - Hi, hon.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> Who are you?
Um, would you excuse us for just a second?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Of course.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What did I tell you right before I left?<eos> Would you like a wafer?<eos> Bathroom.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Do you have to go to the bathroom?<eos> You do.
It was all a game.<eos> - So none of this was real?<eos> - Nope.<eos> We wanted to teach you a lesson.<eos> And I thought you could use a little of the old spirit of Camp Firewood back in your lives.<eos> And I think we succeeded.<eos> Don't you think, Ron?<eos> Ab-so-tutely.<eos> So, hold on.<eos> You and President Bush staged a nuclear crisis to bring us all together and teach us about friendship?
Just let everything really churn, you know?<eos> And... then at 10 p.m., our counselor was like,<eos> "All right, kids, get to bed."<eos> I got all cozy in my bunk.<eos> And I remember thinking, "Um, I think I'm gonna like it here."<eos> Went to bed.<eos> Couple hours later, I woke up.<eos> I don't know if this is a universal thing.<eos> Has anyone woken up in the middle of the night and known you had ten seconds... before you just shit all over yourself?<eos> You?
'Cause I know...<eos> Sorry.<eos> I should have put a sign on the door or something.<eos> This is really... It's really unprofessional.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> Cool.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Package.<eos> "Dear Joe, As I watched The American Humour Awards on TV the other night, I was shocked and saddened to see that you did not end up the chosen winner.
Oh, hi.<eos> Cool.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Package.<eos> "Dear Joe, As I watched The American Humour Awards on TV the other night, I was shocked and saddened to see that you did not end up the chosen winner.<eos> In my humble opinion, you were robbed!<eos> You did everything right:<eos> the intro, the outfit, the applause breaks.<eos> Your special was perfect!<eos> It breaks my heart you did not go home with the trophy.
- Be nice.<eos> Never been my speciality if I'm honest...<eos> Really?<eos> Never would have guessed, man.<eos> You still looking for pointers?<eos> - It's that way back to England.<eos> - Hey, shut it.<eos> Hey, why don't you order another one?<eos> They have no idea, do they?<eos> You're the guy who struck the first 90 meters at Copper Peak, with no headwind, in 1970 Opening Trials, and they think you're just some old drunk.
Wow.<eos> - Is this not theft?<eos> - It's the Lost and Found, man.<eos> Some guy dropped 10 bucks on the street and you pick it up would that be theft?<eos> Yes.<eos> - What if he didn't know it was missing?<eos> - Then I'd give it to charity.<eos> Eddie, you are a charity.<eos> Your needs are much greater.<eos> What about you?
I literally got down on my knees and I begged him to let me jump again.<eos> You wanna know what his last words to me were?<eos> "You will never take jumping seriously 'cause you do not take yourself seriously."<eos> Okay.<eos> Are they gonna be your last words to me, too?<eos> Don't make the same mistake, Eddie.<eos> Okay? I'm begging you.<eos> Do it right or don't do it at all.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> This time a year ago you were plowing snow.
I made that cloth!<eos> That's my loom!<eos> No! No! Ma'am.<eos> Ma'am, stop it.<eos> -That's for my baby!<eos> -That's not what babies- we're just taking what's rightfully ours.<eos> -Please make them stop.<eos> - You got the court order?<eos> - Yes, but-- what did the court order say? We will take 10%.<eos> You're taking everything!
-We'll get you more cornmeal.<eos> -Of course we will.<eos> Well, that ain't the point. I grew that corn.<eos> Everybody know how to blow one of these?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Now, look here, they come back, I want you to blow that as loud as you can as soon as you hear 'em riding' up.<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> -I'm just over this ridge here.<eos> I'll be here soon.<eos> You got any more of those?
Easy, girls.<eos> Well-- what do we have here?<eos> Stop.<eos> Beg your pardon?<eos> I said stop walking.<eos> It's quite an army you got there.<eos> Three little girls with guns.<eos> It's more like eight.<eos> How come you ain't up north fighting'?<eos> How come you ain't?
I know you.<eos> I'm here to show you through.<eos> Come on.<eos> You all right to walk?<eos> Yeah. Just slow.<eos> All right.<eos> Now, walk where I walk.<eos> Out there is deep. Through here is shallow.<eos> Careful now.<eos> You got it. Let's go.
You all right to walk?<eos> Yeah. Just slow.<eos> All right.<eos> Now, walk where I walk.<eos> Out there is deep. Through here is shallow.<eos> Careful now.<eos> You got it. Let's go.<eos> They gonna fix you.<eos> They runaways?<eos> Ain't you?
Did you get him?<eos> Get him again.<eos> Jasper, it's all right.<eos> Come on out now.<eos> You ain't the only one.<eos> Will?<eos> Raise your hand.<eos> That stuff don't belong to you.<eos> Unhitch that wagon and head off down the road.<eos> Who are you?
The free men of Jones county?<eos> That's what he said.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna concern myself with five or six deserters hiding out in the swamp who don't have the courage to show their face.<eos> Sir-- you've got a quota to meet.<eos> You're dismissed.<eos> What do you say, sumrall?<eos> Well, there will be no more dry firing' for you.<eos> How you doin', Charles?<eos> That's good, son.<eos> Are you Newton Knight?
Your corn. Where's your corn?<eos> Field's picked clean.<eos> Oh, yeah. We picked it.<eos> So where is it?<eos> Good morning!<eos> Step on down, lieutenant.<eos> Hold on, all right?<eos> Just-- just hold on.<eos> Hey, I know you.<eos> Yeah, you the one that stole our corn and our mule.
I got plenty for everybody now.<eos> There we go. That fat, that's where all the flavor is-- in that fat.<eos> Who wants that? Get right here.<eos> It's falling right off the bone.<eos> You don't even need those knives.<eos> What are you doin', nigger?<eos> That ain't for you.<eos> Put it back.<eos> Put it back, nigger.<eos> How you ain't?
Who wants that? Get right here.<eos> It's falling right off the bone.<eos> You don't even need those knives.<eos> What are you doin', nigger?<eos> That ain't for you.<eos> Put it back.<eos> Put it back, nigger.<eos> How you ain't?<eos> What?<eos> I said, how you ain't?
What?<eos> I said, how you ain't?<eos> How I ain't what?<eos> What he says, ward, is how you ain't a nigger.<eos> I mean, they just pick cotton for 'em.<eos> You--<eos> you was willin' to get killed for 'em.<eos> For lord's sake, play somethin', will you, Lucas, before a whole new war breaks out here.<eos> Colonel?<eos> You Sally?

I know. They're rich.<eos> So what?<eos> Are we gonna start killin' rich people?<eos> It's why they're rich, ward.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> You, me, all of us.<eos> We're all out there dying so they can stay rich.<eos> You own any slaves, ward?<eos> You got any negroes to fight for?<eos> No. But it sure looks like you do.
-Absolutely.<eos> Jasper, let me see that paper there.<eos> From this day forward, "we declare the land north of the pascagoula swamps, south of enterprise and east of the Pearl river to the Alabama border to be a free state of Jones."<eos> "And as such, we do hereby proclaim and affirm the following principles.<eos> Number one:<eos> No man oughta stay poor so another man can get rich."<eos> "Number two:<eos> No man oughta tell another man what he's gotta live for or what he's gotta die for."<eos> "Number three:<eos> What you put in the ground is yours to tend and harvest, and ain't no man oughta be able to take that away from you."
Eakins. He gets to come back?<eos> -Yeah, if he takes an oath.<eos> -What kind of oath?<eos> Swearing to be loyal to the union.<eos> Ain't no union, man.<eos> No? I can take an oath swearing to be a canary, -it don't mean I can fly.<eos> -That's it.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Are we free or we ain't free?<eos> You understand.
A what? Apprenticeship?<eos> What is a lawful apprenticeship, lieutenant?<eos> To quote the statute on apprenticeship...<eos> "If any apprentice shall leave the employment of his or her master without consent, said master may pursue and recapture the apprentice and bring him before any justice of the peace, whose duty it shall be to remand said apprentice to the service of his or her masters."<eos> -You done yet?<eos> -You, sir, are out of order.<eos> No, I'm not out of order, lieutenant.<eos> I understand this quite clearly.<eos> Y'all get your land back.<eos> Then you go and work up some fancy law just last week that gets this boy back in the fields picking cotton for you.
Election day, ain't it?<eos> Sure is.<eos> We'd like republican tickets.<eos> We ain't got those yet.<eos> Just the democrat tickets.<eos> We'll wait.<eos> Might be a pretty long wait.<eos> Let me explain something to you.<eos> These men are here to vote.<eos> And they mind dying a whole lot less than you do.
-I'm just looking for [ indistinctly ]...<eos> -You're crazy.<eos> Okay, bingo.<eos> I need you to listen very carefully, Claire.<eos> Top-secret data has been hacked from the Vice President's office.<eos> It's information about our friend Zaifuddin.<eos> It puts him in very hot water.<eos> Why didn't you warn him? .<eos> Oh, we did, but we need to do more.<eos> So you're getting on a plane.
Check it out.<eos> What's this? .<eos> It's my weapon.<eos> Black Tiger Unit.<eos> The target is on the move.<eos> I'm on them.<eos> Black Tigers? .<eos> They're our friends, aren't they? .<eos> They used to be, but no more.<eos> You're a tough one, huh, Sirin? .
What are you doing? .<eos> Step back, Mazaru.<eos> You've only got 1 0 minutes to move your ass away from here.<eos> This fucking place is gonna be blown.<eos> You must be crazy, Claire.<eos> Don't do it, all right? .<eos> Think of the people and your relatives.<eos> Shall I care? .<eos> It's my work.<eos> And you are fired from this mission.
And that's if we're talking about weapons that we know of.<eos> Russians are developing some nasty stuff.<eos> And if the martians finally figured out a way to get here, their weapons will make the Russkies' look like sticks and stones.<eos> Luckily,<eos> I've prepared for this.<eos> Well, I'll need to use your phone then to call my family and tell them that I'm safe here and make sure they're okay.<eos> Michelle, they're not okay.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Everyone outside of here is dead.<eos> But what about you?
I would look like a circus freak, or something. I'd just be covered head to toe.<eos> Tattoos all over my... You know, everywhere.<eos> Face? Sure. Right there.<eos> Across my forehead.<eos> Just my name. "Emmett."<eos> Or, you know,<eos> "thug life."<eos> "Yolo."<eos> I don't even know what that means, but, you know, I hear people saying it all the time, so, it must be cool.<eos> Hey, what about you, Howard?
What did they do?<eos> 11 stainless steel pins in the bones.<eos> Multiple torn ligaments... Severe nerve damage in both hands.<eos> You were on the table for 11 hours.<eos> Look at these fixators.<eos> No one could have done better.<eos> I could have done better.<eos> No.<eos> Give your body time to heal.<eos> You've ruined me.
Pass a stent down the brachial artery into the radial artery.<eos> It's possible.<eos> Experimental and expensive, but possible.<eos> All I need is possible.<eos> Up.<eos> Up.<eos> Show me your strength.<eos> This is useless.<eos> It's not useless, man.<eos> You can do this.
Let's go!<eos> All day!<eos> All day!<eos> Yeah!<eos> All day.<eos> Come on, man!<eos> Talk a lot.<eos> Jonathan Pangborn...<eos> C7-c8 spinal cord injury, complete.<eos> - Who are you?
Partial paralysis in both hands.<eos> - I don't know you.<eos> - I'm Stephen Strange.<eos> I'm a neurosurgeon.<eos> Was a neurosurgeon.<eos> Actually, you know what, man, I do know you.<eos> I came to your office once.<eos> You refused to see me.<eos> I never got past your assistant.<eos> You were untreatable.
A paralyzed man?<eos> In a way.<eos> You helped him to walk again.<eos> Yes.<eos> How did you correct a complete c7-c8 spinal cord injury?<eos> I didn't correct it.<eos> He couldn't walk.<eos> I convinced him that he could.<eos> You're not suggesting it was psychosomatic?<eos> When you reattach a severed nerve... Is it you who heals it back together or the body?
It's really good.<eos> It's just, I've seen it before... In gift shops.<eos> And what about this one?<eos> - Acupuncture, great.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> What about that one?<eos> Showing me an MRI scan.<eos> I do not believe this.<eos> Each of those maps was drawn up by someone... Who could see in part, but not the whole.<eos> I spent my last dollar getting here, one-way ticket... And you're talking to me about healing through belief?
What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses?<eos> At the root of existence... Mind and matter meet.<eos> Thoughts shape reality.<eos> This universe is only one of an infinite number.<eos> Worlds without end.<eos> Some benevolent and life giving.<eos> Others filled with malice and hunger.<eos> Dark places... Where powers older than time lie ravenous...<eos> And waiting.<eos> Who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. Strange?
The source code that shapes reality.<eos> We harness energy... Drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse... To cast spells...<eos> But even if my fingers could do that... My hands would just be waving in the air.<eos> How do I get from here to there?<eos> How did you get to reattach severed nerves... And put a human spine back together bone by bone?<eos> Study and practice, years of it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Mr. Strange.<eos> Stephen, please.<eos> And you are?
Only certain practices.<eos> Those books are far too advanced for anyone other than the sorcerer supreme.<eos> This one's got pages missing.<eos> That's the book of cagliostro.<eos> A study of time.<eos> One of the rituals was stolen by a former master.<eos> The zealot, kaecilius.<eos> Just after he strung up the former librarian... And relieved him of his head.<eos> I am now the guardian of these books.<eos> So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again... I'd know it... And you'd be dead before you ever left the compound.
Our universe grows cold and perishes.<eos> But the dark dimension... It's a place beyond time.<eos> That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.<eos> This world doesn't have to die, doctor.<eos> This world can take its rightful place alongside so many others... As part of the one.<eos> The great and beautiful one.<eos> We can all live forever.<eos> Really?<eos> What do you have to gain out of this new age dimensional utopia?<eos> The same as you.
The same as everyone.<eos> Life.<eos> Eternal life.<eos> People think in terms of good and evil... When really time is the true enemy of us all.<eos> Time kills everything.<eos> What about the people you killed?<eos> Tiny.<eos> Momentary specks within an indifferent universe.<eos> Yes.<eos> You see.
Still seeing through me, are you?<eos> I see what I've always seen:<eos> Your over-inflated ego.<eos> You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything... Even death... Which no one can control.<eos> Not even the great doctor Stephen Strange.<eos> Not even dormammu?<eos> He offers immortality.<eos> It's our fear of death that gives dormammu life.<eos> He feeds off it.<eos> Like you feed off him?
Major!<eos> Major!<eos> Good boy.<eos> He got him.<eos> - Superb horsemanship, Major.<eos> - Excellent shot, Sir.<eos> These woods have been deadly to horses.<eos> To death...<eos> The best sauce to life.<eos> You'll be the toast of the gala.
What is it?<eos> What's amiss?<eos> You got the deer.<eos> All eyes will be on you this evening.<eos> Well, my darling,<eos> I will be the only man there tonight of my rank whose uniform is unadorned.<eos> Oh, how can that matter now?<eos> The great Secretary Bryce will be at the gala.<eos> "Oh, Major Fawcett."<eos> "You've no medals?"
No more than 20 cases, Clive.<eos> Hurry along, men.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, put your backs into it.<eos> Fawcett!<eos> Put your backs into it.<eos> Hurry it along.<eos> Come on, men.<eos> - Sir?<eos> - You're off to London tomorrow.
But there are Rubber plantations all over Amazonia.<eos> Very profitable.<eos> There is now considerable argument between Bolivia and Brazil as to what constitutes their border.<eos> So fantastically high is the price of rubber that war could arise.<eos> Do you follow?<eos> - I do, Sir. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Although I'm not sure what this has to do with me.<eos> I'm getting to that.<eos> Neither country will accept mapping done by the other, so they've requested us to act as referee.<eos> As you completed your mapping here with distinction, you came under our consideration.
- I see. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Sirs, may I speak candidly?<eos> - Please.<eos> My survey work was long ago, and to be quite honest, I was rather hoping for a position where I might see a fair bit of action.<eos> Major, this is far more than just survey work.<eos> This is exploration in the jungle.<eos> The environment's brutally difficult...<eos> Terrible disease, murderous savages.<eos> The journey may well mean your life.<eos> At the very least, you will be gone for several years.

Don't be sad.<eos> I'm an independent woman.<eos> I had noticed.<eos> Cheeky.<eos> Darling... I know this is a sacrifice for all of us.<eos> But it will be worth it.<eos> I have no doubt.<eos> Come here.<eos> Listen to me!<eos> You've been cheating me?

To map the Verde river.<eos> Please!<eos> Find its source.<eos> It forms a critical part of the border between Bolivia and Brazil.<eos> Our survey route is to begin at a place called Fazenda Jacobina, which does not appear to be on this map.<eos> I know Fazenda Jacobina.<eos> It's an old rubber town.<eos> It's meant to be quite enchanting.<eos> Really?<eos> You may not be completely useless after all.

Lost and waiting for you.<eos> Go!"<eos> Twenty-nine degrees, 16 minutes south of the equator.<eos> Twenty-nine...<eos> Sixteen.<eos> Rather deadly looking snake here.<eos> We might be a little bit too English for this jungle.<eos> Strangers in a strange land.<eos> Major Fawcett?<eos> Is that you?
Go on.<eos> They strongly advise you to...<eos> Abort the mission.<eos> It's become far too dangerous, Sir.<eos> They're already fighting...<eos> Where are the government offices?<eos> Sir?<eos> Government, Sir?<eos> I'm afraid you've left "government" behind a long time ago.<eos> In that case, you had better send them a telegram informing them that we will not stand down and we shall proceed as planned.

Good evening, baron.<eos> Thank you for seeing us.<eos> We're from the British army.<eos> We are to be venturing up the Rio Verde and find ourselves in need of some of your men.<eos> In exchange, I promise very favorable treatment from my country.<eos> Keep him chained up.<eos> He can't be trusted.<eos> He needs a good beating every now and again.<eos> Por favor.<eos> You're goin' upriver, are ya?
Por favor.<eos> You're goin' upriver, are ya?<eos> Yes.<eos> For surveying.<eos> Well...<eos> Ain't nobody comes back from up there.<eos> Ever.<eos> Is this slave good enough for you?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Do you speak English?

Yes.<eos> - Do you speak English?<eos> - He understands.<eos> We taught him.<eos> What will you take for him and any four men of his choosing?<eos> It offends you to negotiate with me.<eos> - No, not at all.<eos> - Please.<eos> Do not embarrass yourself.<eos> You come here to make maps.
- Please.<eos> Do not embarrass yourself.<eos> You come here to make maps.<eos> Why is that?<eos> So that there may be peace.<eos> What is peace?<eos> Peace means my business will flourish.<eos> I will flourish.<eos> Peace means only that nothing will change.<eos> I will help you because you will make sure that nothing will change.

All right, pull it in.<eos> We'll try again further up.<eos> Major Fawcett?<eos> What on earth is she doing all the way out here?<eos> Come to load rubber, no doubt.<eos> Or maybe she's looking for the gold of El Dorado.<eos> It's German.<eos> Trunk says "Hamburg".<eos> There's someone aboard.<eos> Hey, are you German?
Stay down!<eos> Where's Fawcett?<eos> Fawcett!<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Are we close?<eos> Even the Indian's gone mad now.<eos> He was talking to me about gold cities today... Like a little child.<eos> He thinks we're conquistadors to be led to our death.<eos> Those Indians seemed a bit mad to begin with.<eos> I'd like you to read this to me if you can.
If we are to meet our end here, what difference does it make?<eos> I'm afraid it would be quite unbearable for me to read it myself.<eos> Feel free to summarize.<eos> Right you are, Sir.<eos> Your wife has moved the family to Devon.<eos> She's given birth to a boy named Brian.<eos> Your oldest boy, Jack, is excelling in all ways, she says.<eos> I see my son's face in my dreams now.<eos> What kind of fool am I to leave my family for this place?<eos> What did you hope to achieve out here?
One piece.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Give me that!<eos> Control yourselves!<eos> We are not savages.<eos> We're leaving our bones here, Major.<eos> And for what?<eos> A map?<eos> Even if we get there, we're not making it back without any food.<eos> Have you ever thought about that?
Couldn't have done that better myself, Sir.<eos> What is it, chief?<eos> It's pottery...<eos> In the ground.<eos> Look, it's all over.<eos> Look at this.<eos> They're ancient.<eos> Christ, he was right.<eos> The Indian was right.<eos> You said no one had been here before.

There must have been dwellings here.<eos> Thank god that boar has more meat on it than we do.<eos> All right, easy, easy, easy.<eos> The exit from hell is always difficult, Mr. Costin.<eos> And we will get back.<eos> The world will know what we have found here.<eos> - Let us keep going.<eos> - Vámonos.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Can you see him?

- Mrs. Fawcett.<eos> - Evening.<eos> Percy, we're all so excited to hear your speech to the RGS.<eos> Listen to them, will you?<eos> They're all talking about your mission.<eos> Extraordinary.<eos> I'm just honored to be here, Sir.<eos> I read your article in the times this morning about the slave trade in the Americas.<eos> It's, uh...<eos> You're an enlightened man.
You're an enlightened man.<eos> Poor savages.<eos> The native does deserve our sympathy.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think we have only just scratched the surface of Amazonia.<eos> Most certainly.<eos> I was, um...<eos> Well, I'm a biologist, but I'm also somewhat of an explorer.<eos> I was second-in-command under Shackleton in the Antarctica.<eos> Did you know that?
Yes.<eos> I think we have only just scratched the surface of Amazonia.<eos> Most certainly.<eos> I was, um...<eos> Well, I'm a biologist, but I'm also somewhat of an explorer.<eos> I was second-in-command under Shackleton in the Antarctica.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> I don't think there's anyone here who's not well aware of your accomplishments, Mr. Murray.<eos> Hear, hear.<eos> You have distinguished yourself with great bravery.
I witnessed several archaeological discoveries that I believe may have enormous significance.<eos> Such as?<eos> Pottery in the jungle...<eos> Where no white man has ever been before.<eos> My friend, a word in your ear, please.<eos> Um, your...<eos> Your exploits have opened every door for you, but I would suggest keeping such findings to yourself, hmm?<eos> It is one thing to defend the primitive jungle men.<eos> It is quite another to elevate their capacity beyond reason.<eos> I mean, no one here would dispute that you believed what you saw, but, uh...
It's... It's men only, I'm afraid, madam.<eos> My esteemed colleagues, it is now my firm belief that Amazonia is far more than the green desert which many of us had supposed.<eos> I am proposing that Amazonia contain a hidden civilization.<eos> One that may well predate our own.<eos> Major Fawcett,<eos> I am Mr. William Barclay, of Bedford.<eos> And I have been to south America.<eos> Please, Mr. Barclay, I'm sure we'd all be thrilled to hear about your holiday.<eos> But we are currently discussing exploration.<eos> Now, to be clear, are you insisting on mythical kingdoms of gold?
Please, Mr. Barclay, I'm sure we'd all be thrilled to hear about your holiday.<eos> But we are currently discussing exploration.<eos> Now, to be clear, are you insisting on mythical kingdoms of gold?<eos> Now...<eos> Now, those fantasies lured the conquistadors to their destruction.<eos> Sir, it was the conquistadors and we who have been destroying Amazonia.<eos> I have seen with my own eyes evidence of their civilization, and I assure you, Sir, it is real.<eos> Perhaps it is too difficult for some of you to admit.<eos> We, who have been steeped in the bigotry of the church for so long cannot give much credence to an older civilization, particularly one created by a race the white man has so brutally condemned to slavery and death.<eos> Are... Are you insisting that these savages... They're our equals?
What, El Dorado?<eos> No, gentlemen!<eos> No!<eos> - I call it Z. - Z?<eos> The ultimate piece of the human puzzle!<eos> It is there, and we must find it!<eos> Mr. Fawcett!<eos> Mr. Fawcett, I say we return!<eos> I say we go and find the glory!<eos> What say you?
The ultimate piece of the human puzzle!<eos> It is there, and we must find it!<eos> Mr. Fawcett!<eos> Mr. Fawcett, I say we return!<eos> I say we go and find the glory!<eos> What say you?<eos> What I say, Mr. Murray... Is I accept that challenge!<eos> Mr. Costin!<eos> I see you seated there!<eos> Will you return with us?
I must say, I did expect more understanding from you, and I am disgraced by your ignorant posture.<eos> - Mother!<eos> - It's all right, darling.<eos> I'm sorry we were shouting.<eos> Run along, I'll come in...<eos> Mother, please don't fight.<eos> It's all right, Jack.<eos> Go.<eos> One hundred twenty-one miles to Oviedo's last marking!<eos> You should put some grease on that.
It's all right, Jack.<eos> Go.<eos> One hundred twenty-one miles to Oviedo's last marking!<eos> You should put some grease on that.<eos> Will do.<eos> Where's Mr. Murray?<eos> He's bringing up the rear, chief.<eos> Mr. Murray!<eos> Yes?<eos> How are you managing?
Will do.<eos> Where's Mr. Murray?<eos> He's bringing up the rear, chief.<eos> Mr. Murray!<eos> Yes?<eos> How are you managing?<eos> I am managing well, thank you.<eos> My pack is just a little heavy, it seems.<eos> Perhaps I shall rid myself of the unnecessary accouterments, yes?<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you.

But you must keep one spare set of clothing and, of course, your mattress.<eos> I believe I shall go naked as Adam in this infernal heat.<eos> What a sight that would be.<eos> Let's keep going.<eos> That bugger wishes he was back on the south pole.<eos> He'll pull his weight soon enough.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Shall we treat ourselves to the mail, gentlemen?<eos> We've still got the sacks from San Carlos.<eos> You got two from your wife and son, Major.
Mr. Costin, come and sing with me.<eos> Come!<eos> Are you ready?<eos> And... amigos.<eos> Amigos.<eos> Amigo!<eos> Amigo!<eos> Amigo!<eos> Boys, boys.<eos> If the red man attacks, you rally to me at all costs.
Amigo!<eos> Amigo!<eos> Boys, boys.<eos> If the red man attacks, you rally to me at all costs.<eos> Rally to me at all costs.<eos> Oh, good god.<eos> His hat.<eos> We're safe.<eos> The chief has invited us to be his guest.<eos> Are you all right?
That is remarkable.<eos> That substance only stuns the fish.<eos> They don't kill more than what they have to.<eos> Remarkable.<eos> These so-called "savages" have cultivated the jungle... where no one thought it could be done.<eos> We've been so arrogant and contemptuous...<eos> I no less than others.<eos> Look how it's all laid out.<eos> It's mathematical in its precision.<eos> Well, it's what you've been saying.
- Come.<eos> - No.<eos> We must keep moving.<eos> I think I have a bit of a fever coming on.<eos> Mr. Manley, help me clean all of this up.<eos> This was in my bag.<eos> It was a gift from my wife and children for all of us to share.<eos> I know, I was just very... Hungry.<eos> I'm feeling a bit tired.<eos> If you don't mind, I'm going to rest for... A while longer.

Murray, stay on the ground!<eos> Swim to shore.<eos> We'll bank further down.<eos> Swim to shore.<eos> Let go!<eos> Swim to shore!<eos> - Please.<eos> - Let go!<eos> - No!<eos> - You're tipping the raft!
I said let go, you pink-eyed weakling!<eos> Let go!<eos> Mr. Manley, help me!<eos> Help me get to shore!<eos> I'll grab him.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Chief, we've lost a third of our rations.<eos> I was drowning.<eos> There was no chance of that!<eos> And this, after you stole our food!
Is that what you want?<eos> You want me to die?<eos> Please slow down.<eos> Give a dying man a chance.<eos> I just want to be dead.<eos> The effrontery of that young upstart, his vulgar quest for glory... like a Judas, he has delivered me... into this jungle.<eos> Well, we're two weeks behind, according to the sextant and the charts.<eos> Chief...<eos> This leg wound of his is becoming more infected.<eos> You delivered me...

There's a slim chance.<eos> Was I weak then?<eos> He is not worth kissing the hem of your garment, as I am not worthy of yours.<eos> Give me strength to survive.<eos> He is not worthy.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Yes, what is it?<eos> There are mining encampments south of us on the river.<eos> In the morning, you will be on your way to them.

You don't even care about going home.<eos> You only care... About your lost city.<eos> I'm going to see if there's a path through!<eos> Chief!<eos> Chief!<eos> Chief!<eos> I saw it!<eos> We're getting close.<eos> Keep going.<eos> You need to come back.
Hey, hey, come on!<eos> Gentlemen, welcome to our new home.<eos> Thank you for coming at such short notice.<eos> - Sir John.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Professor.<eos> Please, will you step this way.<eos> Congratulations on your knighthood.<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> I think that you know everybody here.
Professor.<eos> Please, will you step this way.<eos> Congratulations on your knighthood.<eos> Ah, thank you.<eos> I think that you know everybody here.<eos> Mr. James Murray arrived in London just this morning.<eos> We felt it critical to assemble as soon as possible.<eos> Congratulations on your safe return.<eos> It's a remarkable effort.<eos> Mr. Murray contends that you abandoned him.
Congratulations on your safe return.<eos> It's a remarkable effort.<eos> Mr. Murray contends that you abandoned him.<eos> Is this correct?<eos> No, it is not.<eos> He was given money and food.<eos> It was an unfortunate but necessary maneuver in order to save lives.<eos> Sir George, we spent all our time... Playing around in the mud with the savages.<eos> And I never saw any evidence of a lost city.<eos> You were the reason we did not reach our destination, Mr. Murray.

Of the wrongs... That you have done to me.

To my men.<eos> I'm sorry I ever considered Mr. Murray worthy of your company... And that I ever mistook a man's rank for his mettle.<eos> But I shall not make that mistake again.<eos> What your purpose is in this ambush I cannot say.<eos> But you need fear no more embarrassment from me.<eos> I hereby resign from this institution, and I shall proceed on my own.<eos> No, please, Major.<eos> Please.<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> Please, you must reconsider!
Welcome to the world beyond.<eos> Time's up.<eos> Come on.<eos> - It's the Major's turn.<eos> - Go on.<eos> Let's hear the Major's fortune!<eos> Excellent.<eos> We will be in battle soon, madam.<eos> Any spiritual aid would be greatly appreciated.<eos> You are the explorer?
We will be in battle soon, madam.<eos> Any spiritual aid would be greatly appreciated.<eos> You are the explorer?<eos> I was...<eos> As were these fine men, who have transferred here so we could all be together.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Feel my hand.<eos> Listen to my voice.<eos> Is it a forest?<eos> You dream to be in a forest.

The rest of the men?<eos> - Costin?<eos> - Mr. Costin was unharmed.<eos> Your brigade suffered many losses, but it was the only one that did not retreat.<eos> Thanks to your bravery, they are raising your rank to lieutenant colonel.<eos> Lieutenant colonel?<eos> After all that he has done?<eos> Jack.<eos> I think I was dreaming... About Amazonia.<eos> I'm afraid you may never be able to return to your jungle.
You cannot think of these things right now.<eos> I'm going to take the children for some air.<eos> Come along.<eos> Father.<eos> Jack.<eos> Jack.<eos> America has quite a fascination with you.<eos> Our readers have been asking where you've been since the war.<eos> I'm grateful for their interest.<eos> You may tell your readers I've recovered from my wounds and have been adapting to home life.
Your pursuits in south America have led to a tremendous interest in exploration in the United States.<eos> There have been many new voyages planned.<eos> - Have there?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Dr. Hamilton rice leaves for Brazil soon with radio and airplanes.<eos> He's taking a large and very well armed party.<eos> Well, let us hope that Dr. rice, with all his arms, does not destroy what he wishes to discover.<eos> Allow me to ask you a question.<eos> Yes, Sir.<eos> How did you find us here?
Here they are, chief.<eos> These are the last of my notebooks.<eos> I hope they'll be helpful.<eos> Can I truly not persuade you to come?<eos> We came so close, Henry.<eos> Think of what it would mean... To finally find it together.<eos> Chief, I have a wife and child now.<eos> My own children were younger than yours is now when we went on our first trip.<eos> I can't say it was not a sacrifice.<eos> But if you could see my boy now, his vim and vigor... I guarantee, it would tear down your resistance in an instant.
But if you could see my boy now, his vim and vigor... I guarantee, it would tear down your resistance in an instant.<eos> Would you like some more Brandy, Sir?<eos> No, thank you, Nigel.<eos> - For yourself, Sir?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> Chief, please, don't misunderstand me.<eos> I'm...<eos> Best sympathy for... This search for Z.<eos> I can no longer bear the cost.<eos> You've come to doubt its existence?
No, thank you, Nigel.<eos> - For yourself, Sir?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> Chief, please, don't misunderstand me.<eos> I'm...<eos> Best sympathy for... This search for Z.<eos> I can no longer bear the cost.<eos> You've come to doubt its existence?<eos> No.<eos> I only doubt that Z can provide all the answers you seek from it.
I wish you success, my dear friend.<eos> This will be no pampered expedition.<eos> Top-heavy missions get nowhere.<eos> They linger on the fringe of civilization and bask in publicity.<eos> We will not.<eos> We will be in the field for three years... standing on our own two feet, surviving by our wits.<eos> Tribesmen shall take our dispatches to be delivered for publication as often as possible.<eos> But who's going to finance this latest journey of yours?<eos> The money is generously being supplied by a consortium of American newspapers and Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr.<eos> Are you aware the royal geographical society has just offered to help with the financing?
When we reach Z,<eos> I shall send it to you as a sign...<eos> Just in case I decide not to come back.<eos> Oh, nonsense, nonsense.<eos> Oh, now, we... We...<eos> We have something for you.<eos> Mr. Barclay, please.<eos> The society's highest honor...<eos> The founder's gold medal.<eos> You are truly deserving, colonel.
Sir John, I confess that the brutal wear and tear is great.<eos> And I suffer with heart and soul.<eos> It has taken...<eos> All my strength of will to push horrors from my mind, but I beg you...<eos> Not to lose confidence.<eos> I cannot doubt...<eos> After so many years of sacrifice.<eos> It has become my own life's work.<eos> The Brazilian gave me this to give to you.<eos> He said Percy told him you would understand.
I'm with her right now.<eos> I'm sure she'll be relieved.<eos> - May I speak with her?<eos> - By all means.<eos> Who is it?<eos> You.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm calling from the concierge desk at the hotel.<eos> A guest said his girlfriend left her phone in his suite.<eos> Is that you?
Bon courage.<eos> - Truffle?<eos> - Oui.<eos> Smell it.<eos> - Great. - Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, chef.<eos> Roast chicken?<eos> Oui.<eos> You know where you are, right?
Alan.<eos> Keith.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - So what brings you to Paris?<eos> I was on vacation with my girlfriend.<eos> She left.<eos> I stayed.<eos> Well, you don't seem too broken up about it.<eos> These things happen, I guess.<eos> Yeah, I guess you're right.
Women have been doing this for thousands of years, okay?<eos> How many babies have you had?<eos> Well, I've delivered about 3,000 of them.<eos> Didn't you want one?<eos> You know what?<eos> I just felt like society doesn't let you pursue your dreams once you have children.<eos> And I didn't feel like I wanted to give up my identity to be a slave to some tiny little love-terrorist.<eos> Plus, your body falls to shit, and you have no time to exercise and forget about sleep for the rest of your life, right?<eos> Oh, no, honey!<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no. You can do it!
I don't think it's coming out like it's inside your head.<eos> Josh. I want to be alone.<eos> I know that I've said that a lot.<eos> But, for the first time in my life, I really, really, truly mean it.<eos> Congratulations on your engagement.<eos> Where to?<eos> Home.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> Woman!<eos> I don't know where the fuck you live.
Talkin' won't help.<eos> Well, you're hangin' there like a shirt on a hook, so you got somethin' in mind.<eos> Words, kid.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want you to hurt him.<eos> You know, it's a sin just to ask me that.<eos> I know, but he sins, too.<eos> He sins worse, and he's got it comin'.<eos> Well, in that case...<eos> People said before you came back here... before you were a preacher... you did things.
I figured you might want to talk to her.<eos> I'll listen to a formal complaint should the victim come forward.<eos> Well, that's unlikely, ain't it?<eos> These kinds of situations?<eos> She's probably scared to.<eos> I will listen to a formal complaint.<eos> 'Course.<eos> You don't want to lose the wife-beatin', squirrel-murderin' redneck vote.<eos> I imagine that's a key demographic for you.<eos> You know, Preacher, when I heard that you was comin' back here to your daddy's... I must confess to a portion of unease on it.

We're workin', Miles.<eos> No, yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> Yeah. Get to it.<eos> I... Yeah. That's...<eos> Why are you like that to him?<eos> Three years since Kevin passed.<eos> No shame in makin' yourself available.<eos> I'm completely available.<eos> Not completely like a... you know.
Well, what about your boyfriend or someone?<eos> Get him to come help. A girl doesn't always need some stupid guy helping her.<eos> That's right.<eos> A woman needs to know how to be strong and stand on her own.<eos> Thanks for these, guys.<eos> Of course, boy or girl, if you're lucky enough to fall in love, you have to be even stronger.<eos> Fight like a lion to keep it alive.<eos> So that...<eos> So that on the day your love is... weak enough or... selfish enough or frickin' stupid enough to run away, you have the strength to track him down... and eat him alive.<eos> You're funny.
Yesterday, after he came home from work, he scalded me with the tea kettle.<eos> You think you could tell the Sheriff what you just told me?<eos> The Sheriff?<eos> It's the only way we're gonna get him to stop hurtin' you, Betsy.<eos> I don't... I don't want that.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> You know, takin' your life back... It can be scary sometimes. Uh, no.<eos> -But I'll be there, okay?<eos> I understand...<eos> No, you don't understand what's goin' on with us!
Never mind, Padre.<eos> As you were.<eos> Preacher!<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> How'd it go?<eos> We win this time?<eos> Nice try.<eos> And it's General.<eos> Talk to my wife without talkin' to me first?<eos> Whole town's been hearin' stories about, uh, you're a tough guy.
Donnie... don't do this.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You... You... You got me curious now.<eos> Let's just say, for the sake of argument, that, uh, that I don't listen.<eos> What then, huh?<eos> You'd hear a noise.<eos> Ooh, golly gee.<eos> Oh, a noise? A high-pitched, kind of... bunny-in-a-bear-trap sound.<eos> You'll know it when it comes.<eos> 'Cause you're the one who will be making it.
